RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 6th 2024.  
Dr. Patrick Hassan is a Lecturer at the School of English, Communication and Philosophy at Cardiff University. His primary areas of interest are moral and existential philosophy. Currently, he works on 19th century philosophy (particularly Nietzsche and Schopenhauer), ethics and its relation to aesthetics, and environmental philosophy. He is the author of Nietzsche's Struggle against Pessimism.

In this episode, we focus on Nietzsche's Struggle against Pessimism. We start by talking about pessimism and its varieties, and also a bit about its history. We discuss pessimism in the 19th century, with a focus on Schopenhauer. We talk about Nietzsche’s first engagement with pessimism, and the questions we grappled the most with. We discuss pessimism in “Human, All Too Human”, and a psychological critique of pessimism. We talk about the relationship between pessimism and nihilism. We discuss hedonism, and the value of suffering. Finally, we talk about Nietzsche’s antidotes to pessimism.
