RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 20th 2025.  
Dr. Joshua Glasgow is Professor in (and Chair of) the Philosophy Department at Sonoma State University. Dr. Glasgow works on a variety of topics in moral, political, and legal philosophy.  His publications have covered a variety of issues concerning ethics, the good life, race and racism, language, law, mind, and more. His latest book is The Significance Impulse: On the Unimportance of Our Cosmic Unimportance.

In this episode, we focus on The Significance Impulse. We discuss what the “significance impulse” is, and what it means for something to be important or ordinary. We talk about nihilism, pessimism, and absurdism. We discuss how most achievements are collective and not individual, fame and wealth, and whether it is possible to be remembered forever. We talk about whether the lives of important people are better than ordinary lives. Finally, we discuss things that are “worthwhile in themselves”, what makes life meaningful, how our unimportance relieves us of anxiety, and how to avoid mediocrity.
