Dr. Gregory Retallack is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Oregon. His research has examined the fossil record of soils through major events in Earth history, extending back some 4.6 billion years. He is the author of books like “Soils of the past: an introduction to paleopedology”, and “Soil grown tall: the epic saga of life from earth”.

In this episode, we talk about paleopedology. We start by talking about what it is, how we analyze fossil soils, what information we can get from them, and the factors that play a role in soil formation. We discuss the coevolution of life and earth, the study of the soils of barren planets, the biosignatures of life that we can find geologically, and the evolution of plants. We also talk about studying climate change over the course of Earth’s history through the soil, and what we can learn about paleoenvironments. Finally, we discuss the effects of soil on the taste of wine and other aspects of agriculture.
