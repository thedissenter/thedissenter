Dr. Laura Betzig is a Ph.D. in anthropology at Northwestern University; she’s held research and teaching positions at Northwestern, the University of California, and the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History.  She’s lectured all over the US and Europe in departments of biology, anthropology, history, economics, philosophy, political science, psychology and religion; at interdisciplinary conferences; and to general audiences.  She’s also the author of four books, the latest one being The Badge of Lost Innocence: A History of the West.

In this episode, we focus on The Badge of Lost Innocence. We first discuss how to understand human history as natural history, hunter-gatherer societies, and celibates and sterile castes in Neolithic societies. We then delve into the Roman empire, and talk about the role of eunuchs, emperors and their concubines, and the lives of slaves. We also talk about Medieval Europe, the roles of unmarried and celibate people in the Holy Roman Empire, what happened to bastards, Women’s rooms in royal estates, the role of the Church, and the crusades. We discuss Magna Carta and the parliament in England, and how unmarried women were treated in England. We then explore the decline in promiscuity, and people writing against celibacy, as well as colonization and migration. Finally, we discuss what all of this tells us about the history of inequality, and the social role of monogamy.
