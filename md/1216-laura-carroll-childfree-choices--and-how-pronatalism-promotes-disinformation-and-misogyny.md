RECORDED ON OCTOBER 28th 2025.  
Laura Carroll is a nonfiction author, expert on the childfree choice and pronatalism, and a passionate reproductive rights and ethics advocate. She is the author of The Baby Matrix: Why Freeing Our Minds From Outmoded Thinking About Parenthood & Reproduction Will Create a Better World.

In this episode, we talk about childfree choices and pronatalism. We first get into what it is to be childfree, why people morally condemn childfree choices, whether most people without children are “childless by circumstance”, whether people with children are happier, whether we have evolved to want children, and whether people want large families. We also discuss whether we are headed toward “population collapse”, whether aging populations need more babies, the link between pronatalism and eugenics, and whether pronatalism is a threat to women’s reproductive rights.
