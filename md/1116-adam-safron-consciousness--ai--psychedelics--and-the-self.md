RECORDED ON JANUARY 17th 2025.  
Dr. Adam Safron is Research Fellow at the Allen Discovery Institute at Tufts University, and is leading an interdisciplinary research program at the Institute for Advanced Consciousness Studies. Most of his work has focused on characterizing the nature of preferences and motivation from mechanistic, developmental, and evolutionary perspectives. He has also studied the effects of brief mindfulness interventions on cognition and well-being. While conducting this research, he developed a neurophenomenological model of sensory absorption and ecstatic states via neural entrainment, which eventually led to developing a synthetic theory of consciousness attempting to integrate across seemingly conflicting perspectives.

In this episode, we start by talking about a multidisciplinary approach to the mind. We discuss the study of consciousness, theories of consciousness, the relationship between consciousness and intelligence, and AI. We discuss psychedelics: what they are and how they work; and modern applications of psychedelics. Finally, we talk about the self.
