In this episode, we focus on Blunt Instrument. We start by discussing why we need to know about economic theory, whether economics is a science, and how it is theory-driven. We also discuss whether Homo economicus exists, explanation and prediction in economics, and whether it is ideology-driven. We talk about game theory, why we can’t do without economic theory, and institution design. Finally, we discuss economics and political activism.
