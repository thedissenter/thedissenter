RECORDED ON OCTOBER 8th 2025.  
Dr. Allen Buchanan is James B. Duke Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Duke University, and Laureate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Arizona. He has written six books covering such topics as Marx, applied ethics (especially bio-medical ethics), social justice, and international justice, including the foundations of international law. His latest book is Ideology and Revolution: How the Struggle against Domination Drives the Evolution of Morality and Institutions.

In this episode, we focus on Ideology and Revolution. We first talk about how to understand social change, and the conflict between hierarchs and resisters. We discuss hierarchy and domination, and the role of morality and ideology in the struggle between hierarchs and resisters. We talk about revolution, when it is successful, whether the French Revolution failed, whether revolutionary ideologies play a causal role in revolutions, and just and unjust revolutionary violence. Finally, we talk about moral progress, and discuss whether hierarchy is unavoidable.
