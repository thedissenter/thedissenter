RECORDED ON JANUARY 12th 2026.  
Dr. Paul Eastwick is Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Davis. Dr. Eastwick’s research investigates how people initiate romantic relationships and the psychological mechanisms that help romantic partners to remain committed and attached. One of his research programs examines how the qualities that people say are critically important to them in a romantic partner—their ideal partner preferences—direct romantic partner selection and retention.

In this episode, we focus on Bonded by Evolution. We talk about the science of close relationships, and common misconceptions about attraction and relationships. We discuss how we have evolved to bond, what makes relationships successful, and short-term and long-term mating. We talk about compatibility, and compatibility-driven bonding. We discuss whether dating apps are realistic. We talk about the toxicity and misogyny of the red pill community and the manosphere. Finally, we discuss dating and relationships in the 21st century.
