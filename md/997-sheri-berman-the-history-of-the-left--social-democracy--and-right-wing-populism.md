RECORDED ON APRIL 11th 2024.  
Dr. Sheri Berman is a Professor of Political Science at Barnard College at Columbia University.  Her research interests include European history and politics; the development of democracy; populism and fascism; and the history of the left.  She has written about these topics for a wide variety of scholarly and non-scholarly publications, including the New York Times, The Washington Post, Foreign Policy, Foreign Affairs, and VOX.  She is the author of several books, including Democracy and Dictatorship in Europe: From the Ancient Regime to the Present Day.

In this episode, we start by exploring the history of the left, and we talk about three main strands: socialism, communism, and social democracy. We talk about labor movements, and progressive neoliberalism. We discuss the current state of democracy across the globe, the recent rise of right-wing populism, and the relationship between populism and fascism. We also talk about how we can avoid democratic erosion, and the future of leftism.
