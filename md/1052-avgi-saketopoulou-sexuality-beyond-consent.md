Dr. Avgi Saketopoulou is a psychoanalyst in private practice in NYC and a member of the faculty at the NYU Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis. She is the author of Sexuality Beyond Consent: Risk, Race, Traumatophilia.

In this episode, we focus on Sexuality Beyond Consent. We start by talking about the psychoanalytic theory of Jean Laplanche, and how psychoanalysis approaches trauma. We discuss traumatophilia and traumatophobia. We also talk about consent, limit consent, and how it applies to therapeutic approaches. Finally, we discuss the phenomena of racialization, sadism, and exigent sadism.
