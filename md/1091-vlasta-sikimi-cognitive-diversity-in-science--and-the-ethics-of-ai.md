RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 7th 2025.  
Dr. Vlasta Sikimić is an Assistant Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Her research focus is on Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of AI, Empirical Philosophy, Logic, Science Policy, and Animal Ethics.

In this episode, we start by talking about cognitive diversity in science. We discuss what it is, as well as epistemic diversity. We discuss whether political diversity is important, and how to achieve cognitive diversity. We then delve into the ethics of AI, and talk about ethical principles and guidelines for AI, high-risk AI systems, and robust and accountable AI.
