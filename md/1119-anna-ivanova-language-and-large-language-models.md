RECORDED ON APRIL 25th 2025.  
Dr. Anna Ivanova is Assistant Professor in the School of Psychology at Georgia Tech. She is interested in studying the relationship between language and other aspects of human cognition. In her work, she uses tools from cognitive neuroscience (such as fMRI) and artificial intelligence (such as large language models).

In this episode, we talk about language from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience. We discuss how language relates to all the rest of human cognition, the brain decoding paradigm, and whether the brain represents words. We talk about large language models (LLMs), and we discuss whether they can understand language. We talk about how we can use AI to study human language, and whether there are parallels between programming language and natural languages. Finally, we discuss mapping models in cognitive neuroscience.
