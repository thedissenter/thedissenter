RECORDED ON MARCH 13th 2024.  
Dr. Robert Vinten is a postdoctoral research fellow within a project on epistemic injustice and previously a postdoctoral research fellow within a project on the epistemology of religious belief at the NOVA University of Lisbon. He is the author of Wittgenstein and the Social Sciences (2020) and of numerous journal articles about Wittgenstein’s philosophy. He is also the editor of Wittgenstein and the Cognitive Science of Religion: Interpreting Human Nature and the Mind.

In this episode, we focus on Wittgenstein and the Cognitive Science of Religion. We first discuss Wittgenstein’s ideas about religion, the cognitive science of religion, and critiques of it by Wittgensiteinians. We discuss whether religion is a natural phenomenon, and issues regarding reductionism, scientism, and the cognitive science of religion as a reaction to cultural relativism. We talk about Dr. Vinten’s criticisms of Pascal Boyer’s approach to religion, and theory of mind. Finally, we talk about a new project on epistemic injustice that Dr. Vinten is involved in.
