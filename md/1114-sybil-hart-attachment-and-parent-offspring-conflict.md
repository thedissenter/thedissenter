RECORDED ON APRIL 17th 2025.  
Dr. Sybil Hart is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Human Development and Family Sciences at Texas Tech University. Dr. Hart focuses on psycho-social development in infants and young children in the context of their relationships with parents and siblings. She is the author of Attachment and Parent-Offspring Conflict.

In this episode, we focus on Attachment and Parent-Offspring Conflict. We first talk about attachment theory. We then discuss the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, the evolutionary pressures infants go through in the first 3 years of life, undernutrition and close birth spacing, behaviors on the part of infants that protect them against these risks, and maladaptive behaviors. Finally, we talk about the role of fathers, and love relationships with nonmaternal caregivers.
