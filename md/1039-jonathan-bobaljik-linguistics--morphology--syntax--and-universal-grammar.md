RECORDED ON JANUARY 30th 2024.  
Dr. Jonathan Bobaljik is a Professor of Linguistics at Harvard University. He specializes in morphology, syntax, and typology. He is the author of Universals in Comparative Morphology: Suppletion, Superlatives and the Structure of Words, which was awarded the Linguistic Society of America's Leonard Bloomfield Book Award.

In this episode, we talk about morphology, morphosyntax, and universals in language. We start with morphology, and we talk about morphemes, and what we can learn about language by studying morphology. We also talk about morphosyntax, and the relationship between morphology and syntax. We then discuss Universal Grammar and Noam Chomsky’s work, what we currently know about human universals in language, and how morphology is compared across languages. Finally, we discuss whether the aspects of our cognition that are associated with language are domain-specific or domain-general.
