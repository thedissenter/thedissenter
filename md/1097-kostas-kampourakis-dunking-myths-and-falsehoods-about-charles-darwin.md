RECORDED ON MARCH 10th 2025.  
Dr. Kostas Kampourakis is author and editor of several books about science. He works at the Teacher Training Institute and the Section of Biology at the University of Geneva. At the Section of Biology, he teaches the courses “Biologie et Société” and “Comprendre l’évolution”. He is the author and editor of several books, including Darwin Mythology: Debunking Myths, Correcting Falsehoods.

In this episode, we focus on Darwin Mythology. We start by talking about the problem with hero-worshipping in science, and what is a myth. We then go through several myths and falsehoods associated with Darwin, including whether his ideas were original to him; the Galápagos Islands and the finches; whether Darwin was an armchair theoretician; his reaction to Lamarck’s ideas; Alfred Russell Wallace; whether Darwin’s opponents had good arguments; the origins of the phrase “survival of the fittest”; essentialism; African human origins; whether Darwin’s theory was revolutionary; and whether it makes sense to question Darwin. Finally, we talk about what we can learn about how science works by debunking such myths.
