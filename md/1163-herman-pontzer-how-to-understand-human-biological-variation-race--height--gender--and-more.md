RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 29th 2025.  
Dr. Herman Pontzer is Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology and Global Health at the Global Health Institute at Duke University. Dr. Pontzer investigates the physiology of humans and other primates to understand how ecology, lifestyle, diet, and evolutionary history affect metabolism and health. He is particularly interested in cardiometabolic disease and the lifestyle factors that protect against obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other noncommunicable diseases that are common among industrialized populations but rare or absent in non-industrialized societies. His latest book is Adaptable: How Your Unique Body Really Works and Why Our Biology Unites Us.

In this episode, we focus on Adaptable. We start by talking about how we should understand biological variation in humans, and whether “race” is a scientific concept. We discuss when life starts in intrauterine development, and what a “person” is. We talk about variation in height and in nose shape, how to understand population differences and local adaptations, and the role of the environment. We discuss heritability, IQ and intelligence. We talk about what we have evolved to eat and digest. We discuss variation in sexual development, gender, and trans people. We talk about how vaccines work and why they are important. Finally, we discuss whether we could live forever.
