RECORDED ON OCTOBER 14th 2024.  
Dr. Vivek Venkataraman is Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology and Archaeology at the University of Calgary. He is an evolutionary anthropologist who is broadly interested in the evolution of the human diet and food systems, and their relation to life history and behavior. He is assistant director of the Guassa Gelada Research Project, and also the co-founder and co-PI of the Orang Asli Health and Lifeways Project (OAHeLP).

In this episode, we first talk about human tree climbing, its functions, how good we are at it, and whether bipedalism had a negative impact on it. We then discuss different running techniques across human societies, and the influence of footwear or running barefoot. We talk about the determinants of reproductive success in non-industrial societies, before discussing hunting; the idea of “Man the Hunter”; when and how women hunt; cultural restrictions on female hunting; the issues with some studies on female hunting, as well as their merits. We also talk about sexual divisions of labor.
