RECORDED ON July 15th 2025.  
Dr. Mark Wicclair is Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at West Virginia University and Adjunct Professor of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. His primary research and teaching interests are in bioethics and applied ethics. He is the author of Conscientious Objection in Health Care: An Ethical Analysis, Ethics and the Elderly, and more recently, Conscientious Objection in Medicine.

In this episode, we focus on Conscientious Objection in Medicine. We start by discussing what conscientious objection is, and the concepts of conscientious provision, conscience, moral complicity, and moral integrity. We then get into ethical controversies surrounding conscientious objection in medicine, with a focus on whether conscientious objection is compatible with physicians' professional obligations, requirements to inform and refer patients, and an asymmetry between responses to conscientious objectors and conscientious providers. We talk about what happens when there is conflict between patients’ interests or wellbeing and physicians’ self-interest. Finally, we discuss how we should evaluate ethically the beliefs and reasons of objectors, and the implications of these debates for institutions and society more widely.
