RECORDED ON OCTOBER 11th 2024.  
Dr. Kathryn Nave is a Leverhulme Trust early career research fellow at the University of Edinburgh. Her research focuses on developing a realist account of autonomy and agency, grounded in the uniquely metabolic existence of living systems, and upon critiquing the machine concept of the organism in light of this distinctive material instability. She is the author of A Drive to Survive: The Free Energy Principle and the Meaning of Life.

In this episode, we focus on A Drive to Survive. We first discuss enactivism, and the notions of intentionality, autopoiesis, autonomy, adaptivity, and predictive processing. We then get into the Free Energy Principle, and talk about generative models, Markov blankets, living agents, purposiveness and goal-directedness, and biological survival. We discuss the limitations of the Free Energy Principle in differentiating between living and non-living systems, the instability of living systems, and how we can go beyond the Free Energy Principle framework.
