RECORDED ON JUNE 10th 2024.  
Dr. Paul Penn is Senior Lecturer in the School of Psychology at the University of East London. His interests revolve around cognitive psychology and understanding how we can best use psychological knowledge to improve the way people learn, communicate and collaborate. He is the author of The Psychology of Effective Studying: How to Succeed in Your Degree.

In this episode, we focus on The Psychology of Effective Studying. We discuss what it means to study effectively, metacognition, the Dunning-Kruger effect, and the difference between remembering and understanding. We talk about procrastination and how we can deal with it. We discuss note-taking, summarization, and the 3R method: read, recite, and review. We talk about academic integrity, the issue of plagiarism, writing assessments at degree level, the challenges of working collaboratively in academia, and common mistakes in delivering presentations. Finally, we address a question from a patron as to whether going to college makes a big difference in a person’s intelligence and professional skills.
