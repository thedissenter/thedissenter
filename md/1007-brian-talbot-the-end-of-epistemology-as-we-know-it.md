RECORDED ON MARCH 26th 2024.  
Dr. Brian Talbot is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Colorado, Boulder. His work is on epistemology, ethics, and the intersection of ethics and epistemology. He is the author of The End of Epistemology As We Know It.

In this episode, we focus on The End of Epistemology As We Know It. We start by talking about epistemic norms, and the standard epistemic norms that most philosophers follow. We discuss why epistemic norms matter, and what happens when there is conflict between epistemic norms and moral norms. We talk about the difference between knowledge and true beliefs, and we also discuss pointless beliefs, mundane beliefs, and interesting beliefs. We then talk about nonstandard epistemic norms, and Dr. Talbot’s methodology to get at replacement norms. Finally, we discuss whether epistemic norms are categorical.
