RECORDED ON MAY 21st 2025.  
Dr. Sam Carr is Reader in the Department of Education at the University of Bath. He has a particular interest in exploring human relationships and their role in shaping our psychological experiences through the lifespan. He is equally intrigued by (a) the impacts of our close attachments on our existence and (b) the impacts of broader social and political structures upon our attachment bond formation and psychological experiences. He is the author of All the Lonely People: Conversations on Loneliness.

In this episode, we focus on All the Lonely People. We first discuss what loneliness is, the Loneliness Project, and why loneliness matters. We talk about the loneliness epidemic, loneliness in a pandemic, loneliness after a breakup, loneliness after losing a loved one, and loneliness in old age. We also discuss the circumstances where people seek isolation, how and when people deal well with loneliness, whether it is possible to avoid loneliness, and how can people deal with it.
