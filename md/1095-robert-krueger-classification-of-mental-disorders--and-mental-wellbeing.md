RECORDED ON MARCH 7th 2025.  
Dr. Robert Krueger is Distinguished McKnight University Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Minnesota. His specialties include behavior genetics, clinical and personality psychology, quantitative psychology, personality disorders, aging, and health. He is one of the most highly cited psychologists in the world. He is part of the leadership of an international project, The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP), which aims to articulate a taxonomy of symptoms that provide researchers and practitioners with a means to describe an individual’s mental health issues, as well as their major and minor symptoms, along a spectrum.

In this episode, we start by talking about how psychiatric disorders are classified in the DSM and the ICD. We discuss what a mental disorder is, and the relationship between personality traits and psychopathology. We then talk about The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology, the relationship between symptoms and traits, etiology and causal influences, and how disorders are classified within this framework. We also talk about a general factor of psychopathology, and personality disorders. Finally, we discuss subjective wellbeing, and how it relates to personality traits.
