RECORDED ON APRIL 16th 2025.  
Dr. Agustín Fuentes is Professor of Anthropology at Princeton University. His research focuses on the biosocial, delving into the entanglement of biological systems with the social and cultural lives of humans, our ancestors, and a few of the other animals with whom humanity shares close relations. His latest book is Sex Is a Spectrum: The Biological Limits of the Binary.

In this episode, we focus on Sex Is a Spectrum. We start by discussing why sex has evolved; isogamy and anisogamy; what is a male, and what is a female; patterns of sexual and reproductive behavior; hermaphrodites; and “monogamous” primates and naked mole rats. We talk about why humans are “biocultural”, intersex people, comparisons with other primates, and why not all sex is reproductive and why that matters. We then talk about the differences between sex and gender, and the relationship between the sex chromosomes and primary and secondary sexual characteristics. We discuss what a spectrum is, and why a binary approach to sex can be problematic. Finally, we address some arguments against sex being a spectrum, and a nonbinary definition of sex.
