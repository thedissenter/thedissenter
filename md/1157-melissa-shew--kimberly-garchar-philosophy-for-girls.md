RECORDED ON JULY 2nd 2025.

Dr. Kimberly Garchar is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Kent State University.

In this episode, we focus on Philosophy for Girls. We talk about the premise of the book, what a philosophy for girls is and why it matters, the difference between sex and gender, the issue of under-representation of women in philosophy, and the gender gap in academic philosophy. We also discuss whether the way philosophy is done is gendered, the topics of the book, whether women can be empowered through philosophy, and how the gender gap can be addressed.
