RECORDED ON JUNE 10th 2025.  
Dr. Brian Lerch is a theoretical ecologist and evolutionary biologist who just received a PhD from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. He is primarily interested in understanding feedbacks between ecology, evolution, and behavior.

In this episode, we first talk about same-sex sexual behavior and the evolution of homosexuality. We then talk about indiscriminate sexual behavior and how it relates to the evolution of discriminate sexual behavior. Finally, we discuss the evolution of mate attachment, and the evolution of divorce.
