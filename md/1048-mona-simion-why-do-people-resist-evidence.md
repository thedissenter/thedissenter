RECORDED ON MAY 24th 2024.  
Dr. Mona Simion is Professor of Philosophy and Director of the COGITO Epistemology Research Centre at the University of Glasgow. Her research interests include epistemology, philosophy of language, moral and political philosophy, and feminist philosophy. She is the author of several books, the latest one being Resistance to Evidence.

In this episode, we focus on Resistance to Evidence. We start by discussing what resistance to evidence is, the phenomenon of epistemic vigilance, and positive epistemology. We then discuss what evidence itself is, the normative aspects of resistance to evidence, when it is permissible for people to suspend their judgment, and virtue responsibilist approaches to resistance to evidence. We talk about resistance to evidence as input-level epistemic malfunctioning, the phenomenon of defeat, epistemic dilemmas, and skepticism. Finally, we discuss misinformation and disinformation, and an approach to disinformation as ignorance-generating content.
