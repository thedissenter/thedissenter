RECORDED ON JUNE 6th 2025.  
Dr. Kevin Mitchell is Associate Professor of Genetics and Neuroscience at Trinity College Dublin. He is interested in the development of connectivity in the brain, specifically in how this process is controlled by genes and how mutations in such genes affect the connectivity of neuronal circuits, influence behavior and perception and contribute to disease. His latest book is Free Agents: How Evolution Gave Us Free Will.

In this episode, we start by talking about free will. We discuss free will at the molecular level and the different levels of analysis. We discuss top-down causation and process philosophy. We talk about decision-making, why certain possibilities spring to mind and not others, and why it can pay off to behave randomly sometimes. We also discuss whether AI could have free will. We then talk about Dr. Mitchell’s debates with Dr. Robert Sapolsky, and how we should reframe the free will debate within science. We discuss the genomic code, and how the genome instantiates a generative model of the organism. Finally, we talk about the science and ethics of human embryo editing, and the trouble with eugenics.
