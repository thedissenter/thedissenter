RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 25th 2025.  
Dr. Karoline Wiesner is Professor of Complexity Sciences at the University of Potsdam. Interested in the sciences of complexity, Dr. Wiesner began to work on information theoretic representations of complex systems as a PostDoc at the Santa Fe Institute (USA) and the University of California, Davis. Her work centered around information theoretic representations of quantum dynamical systems. Her research focuses on the use of information theory in the study of formation, maintenance and stability of complex systems. She is co-author of “What Is a Complex System?”.

In this episode, we focus on “What Is a Complex System?”. We start by talking about the history of complexity science, the features of a complex system, and emergence. We then go through examples of phenomena and scientific disciplines complexity science applies to, including physics, climate science, the eusocial insects, and neuroscience. We discuss whether the behavior of a complex system can be predicted, and whether complexity science is one single scientific theory. Finally, we talk about the future of complexity science.
