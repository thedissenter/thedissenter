In this episode, we talk about what game theory is, and how it works; conflict between the mother and the fetus in the womb; walk away vs the traditional tit-for-tat cooperative strategies; the osotua system of the Masai, a need-based cooperative system; principles that rule interactions from the cellular to the societal levels, and how they can be applied to develop better tools to fight cancer.
