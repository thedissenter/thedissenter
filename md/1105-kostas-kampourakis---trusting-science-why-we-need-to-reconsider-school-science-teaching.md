In this episode, we focus on Trusting Science. We talk about the importance of trust in science. We delve into the COVID-19 pandemic and the mRNA vaccines. We discuss whether taking a vaccine is a matter of individual liberty or collective responsibility. We explore the case of abortion. We talk about how science works, evidence, and uncertainty. We also talk about calculated risk in medicine, and the case of cancer. We discuss how important it is to trust the experts, and skepticism. We talk about the relationship between science and policy, and the case of eugenics. Finally, we discuss the limitations of science, and what should be taught in schools about science.
