RECORDED ON APRIL 24th 2025.  
Dr. Peter Adamson is Professor of Philosophy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and at King's College London. He has written articles, monographs and edited books, mostly on philosophy in the Islamic world and ancient philosophy. He is the host of the weekly podcast "History of Philosophy without any gaps". He is the author of several books, including Heirs of Avicenna: Philosophy in the Islamic East, 12-13th Centuries.

In this episode, we focus on Heirs of Avicenna. We start by talking about Avicenna and his main contributions to philosophy, the relationship between philosophy in the Islamic East and the scholastic tradition in Europe, the relationship between Avicenna and the traditions of falsafa and kalam, and how the book was organized. We focus on the topics of metaphysics in the Islamic East, and the issues that best characterize the philosophy of the Islamic East. We discuss whether the thinkers from this time period were philosophers of “paraphilosophers”. We talk about the most prominent philosophers, including al-Suhrawardī, Abū al-Barakāt al-Baghdādī, Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī, and al-Ṭūsī, as well as their legacy. Finally, we discuss what we can learn from studying philosophy beyond Europe.
