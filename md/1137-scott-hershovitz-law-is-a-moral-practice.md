In this episode, we focus on Law Is a Moral Practice. We start by talking about rules, law, and morality. We discuss how laws are developed, and whether law and morality are separate things. We talk about law as a moral practice, what lawyers argue about, natural law, and how the law is constituted by different sets of norms. Finally, we discuss whether people are obligated to obey the law, what kind of work lawyers do, and why sometimes people find lawyers repugnant.
