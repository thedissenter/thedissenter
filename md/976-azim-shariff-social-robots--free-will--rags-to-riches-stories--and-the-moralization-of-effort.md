RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 20th 2024.  
Dr. Azim Shariff is Professor and Canada Research Chair at the University of British Columbia, Canada. He is a social psychologist whose research focuses on where morality intersects with religion, cultural attitudes and economics. Another rapidly expanding part of his research looks at human-technology interactions and the ethics of automation, including self-driving cars.

In this episode, we start by talking about cultural differences between East Asia and North America in how people react to robots, algorithms, and AI. We talk about the example of robot preachers and credibility enhancing displays. We discuss people’s belief in free will, and how it varies according to the situation and some individual traits. We discuss whether people always follow their own self-interest in politics. We talk about why people in the US love rags-to-riches stories, and whether people who became rich or the born rich support social welfare more. Finally, we discuss the phenomenon of moralization of effort, and what displays of effort signal socially.
