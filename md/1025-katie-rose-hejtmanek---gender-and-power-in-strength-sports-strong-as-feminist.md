In this episode, we focus on Gender and Power in Strength Sports. We discuss the link between sports and politics, and an interdisciplinary approach to strength sports. We talk about what “strength” means, the connection between muscularity and masculinity, biological differences between men and women, and the history of women in strength sports. We discuss the topic of trans women in sports, and categories other than gender. We talk about the challenges of pregnancy in strength sports, and the connection between strength sports and women empowerment. Finally, we talk about Dr. Hejtmanek’s experience as a female weightlifter.
