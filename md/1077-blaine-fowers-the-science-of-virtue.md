RECORDED ON JANUARY 28th 2025.  
Dr. Blaine Fowers is Professor of Counseling Psychology at the University of Miami. He is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association. His primary scholarly interest is in exploring the ethical dimension of psychology, both in research and practice.

In this episode, we focus on The Science of Virtue. We discuss virtue theory, what the virtues are, how to develop a science of virtue, and how virtues vary cross-culturally. We talk about whether there is a list of virtues, moral values in science, eudaimonia, and the STRIVE-4 model of virtue. Finally, we discuss the intellectual and practical goals of the science of virtue, and its future.
