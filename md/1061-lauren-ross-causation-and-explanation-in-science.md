RECORDED ON DECEMBER 4th 2024.  
Dr. Lauren N. Ross is an Associate Professor in the Logic and Philosophy of Science Department at the University of California, Irvine. Her research concerns explanation and causation in biology, neuroscience, and medicine. This work involves interrelated projects that address: the nature of explanation in these sciences, different causal structures and explanation types, and the rationale that guides particular forms of causal reasoning in these domains.

In this episode, we talk about causation and explanation in science. We start with causation, its different meanings, and different types of causation. We then talk about scientific explanation, the link between causation and explanation, and causal complexity in psychiatry. Finally, we discuss how to communicate about causality to the general public.
