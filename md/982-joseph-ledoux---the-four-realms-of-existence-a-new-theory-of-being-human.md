RECORDED ON MARCH 5th 2024.  
Dr. Joseph LeDoux is the Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, Professor of Neural Science, Professor of Psychiatry, and Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at New York University. His work is focused on the brain mechanisms of emotion and memory. He’s the author of many books, the most recent one being The Four Realms of Existence: A New Theory of Being Human.

In this episode, we focus on The Four Realms of Existence. We talk about the idea of mind-brain dualism. We go through Dr. LeDoux’s work on split-brain patients, emotion, and cognition. We talk about the four realms of existence (bodily, neural, cognitive, and conscious), and how they relate to one another. We discuss how we go from the cognitive realm to the conscious realm, how to understand consciousness, and the different kinds of consciousness. Finally, we discuss how ideas like the self are barriers to discovery and understanding, and how we have hit an epistemological wall.
