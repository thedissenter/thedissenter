RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 15th 2025.  
Dr. Eric Sprankle is a Professor of Clinical Psychology at Minnesota State University, Mankato. He is also a licensed clinical psychologist and AASECT-certified sex therapist affiliated with the Minnesota Sexual Health Institute. He is the author of DIY: The Wonderfully Weird History and Science of Masturbation.

In this episode, we focus on DIY. We start by discussing why a book on masturbation is important. We then talk about masturbation in animals, masturbation in early civilization, and when masturbation was turned into a sin and a disease. We discuss masturbation in utero and the development of childhood masturbation. We debunk claims made by the NoFap movement and people who promote semen retention. We talk about what science really says about masturbation. We discuss whether there is such a thing as masturbation addiction. We then get into claims made by anti-porn feminists, and discuss whether porn addiction is real, whether porn is psychologically harmful, and whether it is harmful to children. Finally, we talk about the importance of sex education.
