RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 23th 2024.  
Dr. Robert Borofsky is the Director of the Center for a Public Anthropology and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Hawaii Pacific University. He is the author or editor of eight books dealing with constructions of knowledge in the Pacific islands—such as Making History (1987) and Remembrance of Pacific Pasts (2000)—and the current state of cultural anthropology, including Assessing Cultural Anthropology (1994) and Yanomami (2005).

In this episode, we focus on An Anthropology of Anthropology. We start by discussing what an anthropology of anthropology is. We talk about the importance of outcomes and the results of publications in Anthropology. We discuss whether anthropology can be apolitical. We talk about culture, what cultural anthropology studies, and the challenges of ethnographic fieldwork. We discuss how the academic context shapes the practice of cultural anthropology, the drawbacks of specialization, and postcolonialism. Finally, we talk about public anthropology, and ethics for anthropology, the importance of collaboration across anthropological subfields, and obstacles to public anthropology.
