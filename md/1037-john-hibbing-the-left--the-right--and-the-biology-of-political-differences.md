RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 5th 2024.  
Dr. John Hibbing is the Foundation Regents University professor of political science and psychology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He has been named a Guggenheim Fellow, a NATO Fellow in Science, and a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is the author of Predisposed: The Left, The Right, and the Biology of Political Differences.

In this episode, we focus on Predisposed. We start by discussing the views people commonly have about political orientation, and the left/right divide. We discuss whether politics is just about personal preferences; whether these differences are evolved; and five social dilemmas that people on the left and the right answer differently. We define “predisposition”, and talk about personality traits, moral foundations, differences in cognition (perception, responses to threats, and disgust sensitivity), and physiological responses. We discuss behavior genetics, and what we know about the relative role of genes and the environment. Finally, we talk about the practical applications of this knowledge, with a focus on political polarization; and the future of the field of biopolitics.
