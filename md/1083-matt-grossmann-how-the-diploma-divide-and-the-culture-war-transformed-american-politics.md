RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 12th 2025.  
Dr. Matt Grossmann is Director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research (IPPSR) and Professor of Political Science at Michigan State University. He is also a Senior Fellow at the Niskanen Center in Washington, DC, host of The Science of Politics Podcast and a regular contributor to FiveThirtyEight’s online political analysis. He is the author (with David A. Hopkins) of Polarized by Degrees: How the Diploma Divide and the Culture War Transformed American Politics.

In this episode, we focus on Polarized by Degrees. We talk about the diploma divide, and trends that led to it since the 1980s. We discuss the demographics of the diploma divide, the “culture war” and how it manifests politically, the contrast between Obama and Trump, the divide between your men and young women, differences between Democrats and Republicans, and attitudes toward experts and institutions, the media, and corporations. We also talk about how the divide manifested in terms of policymaking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we discuss whether there is a solution to this divide.
