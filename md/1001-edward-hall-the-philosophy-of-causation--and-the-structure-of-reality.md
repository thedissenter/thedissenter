RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 11th 2023.  
Dr. Edward Hall is Norman E. Vuilleumier Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University. He works on a range of topics in metaphysics and epistemology that overlap with philosophy of science.

In this episode, we talk about the philosophy of causation, and the structure of reality. We start by discussing different approaches in the philosophy of causation, and how to think about causation across different fields of science. We also discuss the metaphysical status of causation, and how it relates to the compositional structure of reality, and the concept of fundamental laws of nature. Finally, we discuss whether the causal structure of a process is intrinsic to it.
