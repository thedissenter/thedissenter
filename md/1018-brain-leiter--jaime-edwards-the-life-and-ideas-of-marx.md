In this episode, we focus on Marx. We start by talking a bit about Marx’s background and intellectual development. We then go through some of his main ideas, including historical materialism; class, class struggle, and class consciousness; the positive and negative aspects of capitalism; communism; human nature and the good life; alienation; and culture and ideology. We also talk about Marx’s legacy and influence, and discuss the Frankfurt School, Feminist Marxism, and  aspects of Marxism that are still worth considering.
