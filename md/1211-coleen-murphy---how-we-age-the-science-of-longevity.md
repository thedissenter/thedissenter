RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 3rd 2025.  
Dr. Coleen Murphy is James A. Elkins Jr. Professor in the Life Sciences, and Professor of Molecular Biology and Director of the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University. She is the author of How We Age: The Science of Longevity.

In this episode, we focus on How We Age. We discuss the science of aging, what we can learn from it, why we age, and what we can learn from animal models and centenarians. We also talk about longevity pathways, and transgenerational effects. We discuss whether intermittent fasting works. We talk about the role of DNA repair and cell replacement. We discuss whether the gut microbiome plays a role in aging. Finally, we talk about the current state of longevity biotech, and how to approach new developments.
