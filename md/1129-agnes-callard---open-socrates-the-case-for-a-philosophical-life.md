RECORDED ON MAY 16th 2025.  
Dr. Agnes Callard is an Associate Professor in Philosophy at the University of Chicago. She received her BA from the University of Chicago in 1997 and her PhD from Berkeley in 2008. Her primary areas of specialization are Ancient Philosophy and Ethics. She is the author of Open Socrates: The Case for a Philosophical Life.

In this episode, we focus on Open Socrates. We talk about Socratism, Tolstoy’s untimely questions, how we should live, and the values and paradoxes of inquiry, open-mindedness, and truth-seeking. We discuss the ethics of Socrates, and Socratic ignorance and expertise. Finally, we talk about the art of love, the craft of politics, preparing for death, and making a case for a philosophical life.
