RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 23th 2025.  
Dr. Vibeke Ottesen is a Norwegian criminologist with an interest in how nature and nurture combined create human behavior. She has a popular science blog – Biosocial - where she comments on news, scientific findings and literature relevant to her subject – more often than not with an evolutionary informed approach to understanding the subject matter. She has held numerous lectures on the benefits of an evolutionary informed approach to understanding the cross-cultural sex and age differences in anti-social and criminal behavior. 

In this episode, we talk about political violence from an evolutionary perspective. We discuss several theories that explain why someone would commit political violence. We talk about the role of political ideology, mental health factors, notoriety and copycat effects through the media. We also talk about female terrorists. Finally, we discuss how people react to political violence.
