In this episode, we talk about scientific integrity and scientific fraud. We start by defining the terms, and then talk about factors behind scientific fraud, including individual incentives, how science as an institution works, and the publication system. We also discuss plagiarism, fake images and AI, and how Dr. Bik discovers scientific fraud. Finally, we talk about what happens to fraudsters, the correction and retraction of scientific papers, and what would be the best ways of combating fraud.
