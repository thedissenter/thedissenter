RECORDED ON JANUARY 15th 2025.  
Dr. Steven J. Heine is Distinguished University Scholar and Professor of Social and Cultural Psychology at the University of British Columbia. Dr. Heine’s pioneering research has challenged key psychological assumptions in self-esteem, meaning, and the ways that people understand genetic constructs. He is the author of many acclaimed journal articles and books in the fields of social and cultural psychology including Cultural Psychology, the top-selling textbook in the field. In 2016, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. His latest book is Start Making Sense: How Existential Psychology Can Help Us Build Meaningful Lives in Absurd Times.

In this episode, we focus on Start Making Sense. We start by talking about the discipline of existential psychology, and how we have evolved to seek meaning. We discuss our need for stories, the importance of social relationships, religion, and how we deal with our awareness of our own mortality. We also talk about cross-cultural variation in what people find meaningful, and strategies to increase meaning in our lives.
