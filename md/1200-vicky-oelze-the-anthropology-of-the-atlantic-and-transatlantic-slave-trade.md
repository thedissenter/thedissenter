RECORDED ON OCTOBER 17th 2025.  
Dr. Vicky Oelze is an Associate Professor in the Anthropology Department and Director of the Primate Ecology & Molecular Anthropology Lab at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Her research interests include mobility and dietary adaptations in archaeological human populations; African strontium isoscapes and isotopic investigations of the Atlantic and transatlantic slave trade; the dietary ecology of extant African great apes; great ape breastfeeding and weaning; and chimpanzee tool use and termite-chimpanzee interactions.

In this episode, we talk about the study of the Atlantic and transatlantic slave trade through African strontium isoscapes and isotopic investigations. We focus specifically on a mass burial site at Vale da Galfaria, in Portugal. Finally, we discuss how scientists should deal with human remains, and whether they should go back to their communities.
