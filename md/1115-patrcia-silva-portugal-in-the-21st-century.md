RECORDED ON MARCH 28th 2025.  
Dr. Patrícia Silva is an Assistant Professor at the University of Aveiro and a researcher at the Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policies Research Centre (GOVCOPP) of the University of Aveiro, where she has developed research work on political parties, the politicization of recruitment of appointed elites, public administration, and local governance. She is the editor (together with Pedro Magalhães and Nuno Monteiro) of Portugal in the 21st Century.

In this episode, we focus on Portugal in the 21st Century. We start by talking about some historic background, including the transition from dictatorship to democracy, the democratization process, and the accession to the European Union. We then discuss the impact of the 2008 economic crisis, the formation of a Portuguese national identity, the welfare state, the political system (including the electoral system, party representation, and recent party dynamics), and the Portuguese economy in the 21st century. We also talk about social attitudes toward women, immigrants and minorities; the state of science and academia; the production and consumption of art; and the “Europeanization” of Portugal.
