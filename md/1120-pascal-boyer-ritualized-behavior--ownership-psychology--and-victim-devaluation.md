RECORDED ON MAY 1st 2025.  
Dr. Pascal Boyer is the Henry Luce Professor of Individual and Collective Memory in the Departments of Psychology and Anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis. He was a Guggenheim Fellow and a visiting professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Lyon, France. He’s also the author of books like Religion Explained; Memory, Mind and Culture; and Minds Make Societies.

In this episode, we start by talking about religions “in the wild”, and how they relate to the study of misfortune. We ask whether religious beliefs differ from other kinds of beliefs. We talk about ritualized behavior, and the study of OCD and anxiety. We discuss ownership psychology, and how we can understand the abolition of slavery and the phenomenon of “cultural appropriation”. Finally, we talk about victim-devaluation.
