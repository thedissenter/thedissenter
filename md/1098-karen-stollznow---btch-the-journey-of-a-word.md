RECORDED ON MARCH 11th 2025.  
Dr. Karen Stollznow is a researcher at Griffith University and a host of Monster Talk, an award-winning science-based podcast. She is a linguist and the author of On the Offensive, Missed Conceptions, God Bless America, and Language Myths, Mysteries, and Magic. She writes for Psychology Today, Scientific American Mind, and The Conversation and has appeared on the History Channel’s History’s Greatest Mysteries and Netflix’s The Unexplained Files.

In this episode, we focus on Bitch. We start by talking about the origins of the word “bitch”, how it relates to dog and slut, how it acquired the meaning of “unpleasant woman”, and how meanings in general change over time. We also discuss how it has been used as a pejorative against feminists, and how the word was reclaimed by them. We talk about the sexist ideas it is associated with, how it relates to the c-word, how it is used to insult men, and how it ties to gender roles. We also talk about the expression “son of a bitch”, and how people use the word “bitch” today.
