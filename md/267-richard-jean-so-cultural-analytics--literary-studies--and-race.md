In this episode, we talk about the new and emerging field of cultural analytics, and how it applies to literary studies. We discuss what we can gain from computer analysis approaches in the humanities. We also talk about integrating the humanities with the sciences; race and racism; and the cultural transmission through the internet and social media.
