RECORDED ON JUNE 21st 2024.  
Dr. Peter Etchells is Professor of Psychology and Science Communication at Bath Spa University, UK. His research looks at the behavioral and wellbeing effects of playing video games, and he is also interested in metascientific issues regarding best practice in digital technology effects research. He is the author of Lost in a Good Game, and more recently, Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time (and how to spend it better).

In this episode, we focus on Unlocked. We start by talking about moral panics surrounding new technologies and where they stem from. We discuss what screen time is, the link between social media use and mental health, whether screen-based technologies affect our sleep or our ability to focus, and whether they can be addictive. Finally, we talk about how we should approach screen-based technologies.
