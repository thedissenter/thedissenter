RECORDED ON OCTOBER 22nd 2025.  
Dr. Jakob Norberg is Professor of German Studies at Duke University. His research explores conceptions of community in German thought and literature. He is the author of three books, the latest one being Schopenhauer’s Politics.

In this episode, we focus on Schopenhauer’s Politics. We start by talking about the most common ideas about Schopenhauer as a political philosopher. We then discuss his ethics of compassion, his historical and political context, and his relation to the political thinkers of his time. We then go through his ideas about the role of the state; religious institutions; the connection between the rational governance of society and the rational self-control of the individual; his philosophy of sociability; his engagement with Kant and Hegel’s political philosophy; his thoughts on liberalism, conservatism, nationalism, and socialism; his thoughts on aristocracy and epistocracy; the US and republicanism; and China’s political system.
