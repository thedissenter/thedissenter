We talk about what it means for women to be degraded, and whether there is such a thing as feminist porn. We discuss the psychological effects of porn, including porn addiction and sexual violence. We talk about the case of OnlyFans, and whether there is consensual porn. We discuss the social stigma associated with porn performers, and how difficult it can be for them to leave the industry.
