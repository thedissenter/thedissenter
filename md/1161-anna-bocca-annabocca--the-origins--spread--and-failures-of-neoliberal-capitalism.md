Anna Bocca is a YouTuber (@annabocca). She makes videos about the scams of the corporate world, our economy, society, and other topics.

In this episode, we talk about neoliberalism. We start by discussing what it is, its origins, and how it got spread through propaganda and interventionism. We talk about Italian fascism and austerity measures, FDR’s New Deal, and Keynesianism and the post-war consensus. We discuss the 1970s and the rise of neoliberal capitalism, the influence of Milton Friedman, and whether greed is the primary human motivation. We also talk about Margaret Thatcher and the consequences of neoliberal policy. We discuss whether meritocracy is real. Finally, we talk about self-improvement, the rise of hustle culture and the manosphere, and the marketization of mating and dating.
