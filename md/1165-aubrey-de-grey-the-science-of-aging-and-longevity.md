RECORDED ON JULY 18th 2025.  
Dr. Aubrey de Grey is a biomedical gerontologist. He is the author of The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging (1999) and co-author of Ending Aging (2007). Dr. de Grey is known for his view that medical technology may enable human beings alive today not to die from age-related causes. As an amateur mathematician, he has contributed to the study of the Hadwiger–Nelson problem in geometric graph theory, making the first progress on the problem in over 60 years.

In this episode, we talk about the science of aging and longevity. We first talk about what got Dr. de Grey interested in aging, and what aging is and its causes. We talk about the concept of longevity escape velocity, the 7 deadly things, how to combat aging, and biomedical approaches to aging, including metformin and rapamycin. We discuss how close biomedical technology is to significantly postponing aging, and how we could end menopause. Finally, we talk about issues pertaining to overpopulation and retirement, and the anti-aging industry.
