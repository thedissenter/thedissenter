RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 18th 2024.  
Dr. Karl Friston is Professor of Imaging Neuroscience and Wellcome Principal Research Fellow of Imaging Neuroscience at University College London. Dr. Friston is a theoretical neuroscientist and authority on brain imaging. He invented statistical parametric mapping (SPM), voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and dynamic causal modelling (DCM). His main contribution to theoretical neurobiology is a free-energy principle for action and perception. He is the author of several books, including Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior.

In this episode, we explore the Free Energy Principle, and how to go from physical systems to brains and cognition. We start by discussing what the Free Energy Principle is, the history behind its development, and concepts like Markov blankets, internal and external states, blanket states, circular causality, and autonomous states. We talk about the differences between living and non-living systems, and the existential imperative to reduce predicting error. We also discuss concepts like self-organization and hierarchy in nervous systems. We discuss what we can learn about the brain through neuroimaging, and how specialized the brain is. Finally, we talk about how we can integrate the microscopic aspects of brain physiology with a more abstract understanding of the mind, like what we have in psychiatry and psychology.
