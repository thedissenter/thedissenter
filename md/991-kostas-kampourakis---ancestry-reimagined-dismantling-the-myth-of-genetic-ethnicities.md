RECORDED ON JUNE 13th 2024.  
Dr. Kostas Kampourakis is author and editor of several books about science. He works at the Teacher Training Institute and the Section of Biology at the University of Geneva. At the Section of Biology, he teaches the courses “Biologie et Société” and “Comprendre l’évolution”. He is the author of several books, the latest one being Ancestry Reimagined: Dismantling the Myth of Genetic Ethnicities. He is also the Editor of the book series Understanding Life, published by Cambridge University Press.

In this episode, we focus on Ancestry Reimagined. We talk about DNA ancestry testing, and common misconceptions people have about it. We discuss issues with terms like “nationality”, “ethnicity”, and “race”, and the idea of biological essentialism. We discuss whether it makes sense to talk about genes being from particular groups of people or regions of the globe. We talk about human populations, and the concept of cline. We discuss the differences between genetic ancestry and genealogical ancestry. We talk about how much human groups really differ genetically, and how we are all ultimately African. Finally, we discuss the idea of a “natural order”, the social consequences of genetic essentialism, and also the positive effects of learning about ancestry.
