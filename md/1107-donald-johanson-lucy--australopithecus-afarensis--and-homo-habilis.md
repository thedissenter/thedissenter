RECORDED ON MARCH 27th 2025.  
Dr. Donald Johanson is the Virginia M Ullman Chair in Human Origins in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change and the Founding Director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University. For the past 30 years, he has conducted field and laboratory research in paleoanthropology. Most notably, he discovered the 3.18-million-year-old hominid skeleton popularly known as "Lucy." Dr. Johanson has carried out field research in Ethiopia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Tanzania.

In this episode, we first talk about the discovery of Lucy’s fossil remains, what we know about Australopithecus afarensis, and how it relates to other hominin species. We then talk about Homo habilis. We also discuss what was the first species of the Homo genus, and questions to be answered in paleoanthropology in the near future.
