RECORDED ON JUNE 11th 2025.  
Dr. Javier Suárez is Lecturer in the Department of Philosophy at the Universidad de Oviedo. He is a philosopher of biology interested in the study of symbiotic interactions, and their implications for philosophy of biology (the concept of natural selection, the definition of species, etc.), and general philosophy of science (explanation, modelling, methodology of science, etc.). He is the author (with Elisabeth A. Lloyd) of Units of Selection (Cambridge University Press).

In this episode, we focus on Units of Selection. We start by discussing the debate surrounding units of selection in evolutionary biology. We talk about the Adaptationist and Evolutionary Change Schools, and the Disambiguation Project and the Unitary Project. We discuss three different concepts of “unit of selection”: interactor, replicator/reproducer/reconstitutor, and manifestor of adaptation/type-1 agent. Finally, we talk about the Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality framework.
