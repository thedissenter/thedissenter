RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 27th 2024.  
Dr. Susan Charles is Professor of Psychological Science and Nursing Science in the School of Social Ecology at the University of California, Irvine. Her research examines emotional processes across the adult life span. She is interested in how affective experience varies across the life course, and how differences in affective experience may be related to differences in cognitive and health-related processes. Dr. Charles is also interested in the interplay between health and emotion, including the relationship between physical health factors (both health behavior and health status) and emotional processes, and how these relationships may vary as a function of age.

In this episode, we focus on affective well-being across the lifespan. We start by discussing what it is, how emotional function changes across the lifespan, biological changes that affect emotional processes, emotion regulation, and cognitive and health-related processes. We also talk about the role of individual differences, and the relationship between physical health and emotion. We discuss daily stressors, affective reactivity, and physical health. We talk about affective responses to negative social interactions, the role of rumination, and emotional memory. Finally, we discuss how social relationships change with age, the health benefits of close social ties, and loneliness among old people.
