RECORDED ON MAY 22nd 2025.  
Dr. Laurie Mintz is an Emeritus Professor at the University of Florida, where she teaches the Psychology of Human Sexuality. She is the author of two books: Becoming Cliterate: Why Orgasm Equality Matters and How to Get It (HarperOne, 2017), and A Tired Woman’s Guide to Passionate Sex: Reclaim Your Desire and Reignite Your Relationship (Adams Media, 2009).

In this episode, we focus on Becoming Cliterate. We talk about the orgasm gap between men and women, cultural influences, how porn can influence it, the importance of sex education, and the importance of foreplay and communication during sex. We discuss whether penis size matters, the different ways women can achieve orgasm, how men and women feel about hookup sex, and the evolutionary origins of the female orgasm. Finally, we talk about what women can do to improve their own pleasure, and what men can do to improve the sexual experiences of their partners.
