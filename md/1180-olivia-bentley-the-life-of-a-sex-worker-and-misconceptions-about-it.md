RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 20th 2025.  
Olivia Bentley is a porn star, high end escort, fitness influencer, and she has a master’s degree in education. She is passionate about health, sex and helping others. Having been a teacher, Ms. Bentley likes to learn new things and having substantive conversations. Her own publicity experiences include The New York Post, Charly Arnolt on Fox Sports Outkick, InStyle, The Candace Owens Show, Maxim, & many more articles & podcasts.

In this episode, we talk about sex work and misconceptions people have about it. We start by talking about Olivia’s background and how she got into sex work, and the types of clients she has. We discuss the pros and cons of sex work, and the traits that make people successful in sex work. We talk about common assumptions people make about sex work, including it being exploitative, the traits of people who are against sex work, whether porn stars are “damaged goods”, transactional sex, relationships with clients, and whether we live in a promiscuous culture. We discuss the attitudes feminists have toward sex work, whether sex work can be empowering, and the role sex plays in Olivia’s life.
