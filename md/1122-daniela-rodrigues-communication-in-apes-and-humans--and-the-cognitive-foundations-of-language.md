RECORDED ON MAY 6th 2025.  
Dr. Evelina Daniela Rodrigues is an invited assistant professor at Universidade Católica Portuguesa, where she teaches Master’s students about the cognitive foundations of language. She studies gestural communication in human and non-human primates. Beyond communication, she is also interested in other aspects of social development and cognition, including interactions among social partners (such as hierarchy and social bonds), social learning and culture, object manipulation and tool use, and theory of mind.

In this episode, we talk about communication in apes and humans, and the cognitive foundations of language. We start by talking about the apes and types of communication Dr. Rodrigues studies. We talk about gestures in non-human apes, greetings and leave-takings in chimpanzees, greetings and leave-takings in humans, and how apes and humans adjust their communication during development. We also talk about child-directed communication in chimpanzees and humans, and we discuss whether “motherese” is a human universal. Finally, we talk about the link between gestures and language, and the cognitive foundations of language.
