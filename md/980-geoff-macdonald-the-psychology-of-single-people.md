Dr. Geoff MacDonald is a Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto. In general, his research focuses on issues of social connection and disconnection. One emerging theme of his lab’s work is the intersection of singlehood and sexuality. He is trying to understand what predicts well-being in singlehood. Some broader issues that interest Dr. MacDonald now include thinking about attachment theory in light of longitudinal findings on the relatively small role of childhood treatment in adult attachment security, the role of Big 5 personality traits in attraction and maintenance of relationships, and better understanding what people are doing psychologically when they let go of a close relationship.

In this episode, we talk about the psychology of singlehood. We start by discussing what singlehood is, and what counts as long-term singlehood. We talk about the relationship between singlehood and attachment style, and the factors that play a role in the well-being of singles. We discuss how many people want to remain single, why people want romantic relationships, how hard it is for some people to let go of their ex-partners, necessities and luxuries for singles, and what it is like being single in old life. Finally, we also discuss whether singlehood is on the rise worldwide, whether people care more about missed opportunities or rejection, and whether people are less judgmental of their partners when already in a relationship.
