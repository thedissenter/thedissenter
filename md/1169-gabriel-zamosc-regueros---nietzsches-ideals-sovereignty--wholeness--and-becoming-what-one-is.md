RECORDED ON JULY 24th 2025.  
Dr. Gabriel Zamosc-Regueros is Associate Professor of Philosophy in the College of Liberal Arts and Science at the University of Colorado, Denver. His areas of expertise include ethics, Nietzsche, 19th-20th century continental philosophy, and philosophy of Action.

In this episode, we talk about three of Nietzsche’s ideals: becoming what one is, sovereignty, and wholeness. We start with the ideal of becoming what one is: what it is, what one's own uniqueness is, Nitzsche’s takes on the drives and free will, and the mechanisms to become what one is. We then talk about sovereignty: what a morally responsible agent is, and the role of moral guilt. We also discuss wholeness: what it is, and social integration. Finally, we talk about the pathos of distance and aristocracy, and whether it is compatible with democracy.
