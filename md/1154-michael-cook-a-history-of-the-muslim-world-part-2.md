In this episode, we start by talking about the Caliphate from the 7th to the 9th century, and how it spread across the Middle East, Iran, North Africa and Spain. We also talk about Muslims in China, and the Muslim world in the Middle Ages compared to Europe. We then discuss the Ottoman empire, Muslims in India and Southeast Asia, and Muslims in Africa. Finally, we talk about the Muslim world in the present day, the impact of Western countries on the Middle East, and the divide between Sunni and Shia Muslims.
