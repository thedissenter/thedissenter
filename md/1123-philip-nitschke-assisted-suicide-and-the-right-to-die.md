RECORDED ON JULY 3rd 2025.  
Dr. Philip Nitschke is an Australian humanist, author, former physician, and founder and director of the pro-euthanasia group Exit International. He campaigned successfully to have a legal euthanasia law passed in Australia's Northern Territory and assisted four people in ending their lives before the law was overturned by the Government of Australia. Nitschke was the first doctor in the world to administer a legal, voluntary, lethal injection, after which the patient activated the syringe using a computer.

In this episode, we talk about assisted suicide and the right to die. We start by defining assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia. We talk about Dr. Nitschke’s personal journey in the advocacy for assisted suicide. We discuss arguments for and against assisted suicide. We talk about palliative care. We discuss the right to die, Exit International, euthanasia laws in the Netherlands and Switzerland, criteria to have access to assisted suicide, the “peaceful pill”, and the sarco pod. We talk about conscientious objection and autonomy. We discuss how mental capacity is assessed, and whether suicide should be prevented. Finally, we talk about the future of assisted suicide in terms of law and technological advancements.
