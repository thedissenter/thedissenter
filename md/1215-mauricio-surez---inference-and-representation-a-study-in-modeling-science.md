RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 4th 2025.  
Dr. Mauricio Suárez is Full Professor (catedrático) in Logic and Philosophy of Science at Universidad Complutense de Madrid. He is also a life member at Clare Hall at Cambridge University. His main research interests lie in the philosophy of probability and causality, the history and philosophy of science (mainly physics, chemistry and biology), modeling and idealization, the aesthetics of scientific representation, and general epistemology and methodology of science. He is the author of Inference and Representation: A Study in Modeling Science.

In this episode, we focus on Inference and Representation. We start by talking about modeling in science. We then explore the concept of representation. We talk about the flaws of reductive naturalist theories of scientific representation, and an inferential conception of scientific representation. Finally, we discuss how our exploration of scientific representation connects to debates on artistic representation.
