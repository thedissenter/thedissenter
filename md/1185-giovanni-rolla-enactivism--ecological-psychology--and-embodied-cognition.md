RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 10th 2025.  
Dr. Giovanni Rolla is Professor of Philosophy at Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), Brazil. His research is about enactivism, ecological psychology and radically embodied cognition in general (sometimes he deals with traditional epistemology as well, especially know-how, normativity and rationality). He is also a founding member of the Enactive Cognition and Narrative Practices research group (University of Wollongong), and a founding member of the Cognition, Language, Enaction and Affectivity research group.

In this episode, we start by talking about enactivism, and how it differs from cognitivism and other traditional approaches in cognitive science. We talk about combining enactivism, ecological psychology and embodied cognition. We discuss what information is in cognitive science, what know-how is, and the enactivist conception of “bringing forth a world”. We talk about the relationship between enactivism and evolutionary dynamics, and evolution as natural drift. We discuss whether pre-linguistic infants have representational abilities. Finally, we talk about Radically Enactive Cognition, and how rationality is approached from this perspective.
