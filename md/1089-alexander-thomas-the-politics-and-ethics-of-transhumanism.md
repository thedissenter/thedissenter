RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 26th 2025.  
Dr. Alexander Thomas is a Senior Lecturer in Media Production and Film at the University of East London. He is the author of The Politics and Ethics of Transhumanism: Techno-Human Evolution and Advanced Capitalism.

In this episode, we focus on The Politics and Ethics of Transhumanism. We start by discussing what transhumanism is, its tenets, different kinds of transhumanism, enhancement, hierarchy and elitism, and arguments against transhumanism. We delve into advanced capitalism, longtermism, accelerationism, effective altruism, TESCREALism, the politics of transhumanism, and eugenics. We also talk about data totalitarianism, the consequences of a cybernetic approach to the human mind, artificial general intelligence (AGI), and posthumanism. We discuss whether transhumanism can be a religious movement. Finally, we talk about the risk of dehumanization, and how we can ethically approach a potential transhuman future.
