RECORDED ON MAY 7th 2025.  
Dr. Miguel Segundo Ortín is a Ramón y Cajal research fellow in the Philosophy Department at Universidad de Murcia, Spain, and a member of the Minimal Intelligence Lab (MINT Lab). His research focuses on the philosophy of the cognitive sciences, with a particular emphasis on ecological (neo-Gibsonian) psychology and other embodied and situated theories of cognition.  
Dr. Vicente Raja is a post-doctoral researcher at the MINT Lab, a research fellow at University of Murcia (Spain) and external affiliate faculty of the Rotman Institute of Philosophy at Western University (Canada). His research lies at the intersection of philosophy, cognitive science, neuroscience, and the history of the sciences of the mind.  
They are the authors of Ecological Psychology.

In this episode, we focus on Ecological Psychology. We start by talking about what ecological psychology is, as well as its history. We discuss how it relates to gestalt psychology, phenomenology, and behaviorism. We talk about the study of perception and action, and some of the main concepts in ecological psychology, with a focus on affordances. We discuss embodied cognition, 4E cognition, and dynamical systems theory. We also talk about the current status of ecological psychology, as well as its future. Finally, we discuss how it can be integrated with neuroscience, and the study of social coordination and culture.
