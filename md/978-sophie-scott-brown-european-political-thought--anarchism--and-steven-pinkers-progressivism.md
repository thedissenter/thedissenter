RECORDED ON JUNE 27th 2024.  
Dr. Sophie Scott-Brown is a Research Fellow at the University of St. Andrews, and Future Fellow at Remarque Institute, NYU. She is also Founder of the Everyday Democracy project with Open Society Foundation. She is well-known for her historical work on left-wing politics, especially the post-war British left, and for her intellectual biography of Raphael Samuel entitled The Histories of Raphael Samuel - A Portrait of A People’s Historian (2017).

In this episode, we first talk about the history of European political thought, how old it is, and how it changed with the advent of modernism. We discuss the origins of “left-wing” and “right-wing”, and why these terms are problematic. We talk about the main tenets of anarchism as a political ideology, and focus on the topics of liberty and whether society needs hierarchy. We discuss the relationship between history and politics. Finally, we discuss some of the issues with Steven Pinker’s take on the Enlightenment and progressivism.
