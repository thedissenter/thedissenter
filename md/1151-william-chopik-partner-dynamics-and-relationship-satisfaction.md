RECORDED ON JUNE 23rd 2025.  
Dr. William Chopik is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at Michigan State University. He is a social-personality psychologist interested in how relationships and the people in them change over time and across situations. His research focuses on how factors both inside (biological, hormonal) and outside (social roles, geography) of people influence their approach to social relationships. His work examines phenomena as broad as how relationships and social institutions shape development and as focused as the hormonal mechanisms that underlie love and intimacy.

In this episode, we talk about relationship science. We discuss the link between partner’s optimism and health, the link between happiness and health, and the link between marital quality and sleep quality. We talk about the psychological effects of spousal bereavement. We discuss the relationship between singlehood and life satisfaction. Finally, we talk about attachment theory, and the link between attachment style and relationship satisfaction.
