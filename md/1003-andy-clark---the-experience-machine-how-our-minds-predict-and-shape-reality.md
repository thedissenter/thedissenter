RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 24th 2024.  
Dr. Andy Clark is Professor of Cognitive Philosophy at the University of Sussex. His academic interests include artificial intelligence, embodied and extended cognition, robotics, and computational neuroscience. He is the author of several books, the latest one being The Experience Machine: How Our Minds Predict and Shape Reality.

In this episode, we focus on The Experience Machine. We start by exploring the ideas of the brain as a prediction machine, and perception as controlled hallucination. We talk about the relationship between perception and objective reality, the role of expectation, illusions, and 4E cognition and the extended mind. We discuss implications that this framework would have for psychiatry and how we understand mental illness. We also talk about emotion, and the hard problem of consciousness. Finally, we discuss ways by which we can take control of our own experiences, and the effects of psychedelics and meditation.
