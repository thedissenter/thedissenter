RECORDED ON JULY 14th 2025.  
Dr. Rafael Núñez is a Professor of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Núñez investigates cognition from the perspective of the embodied mind. He is particularly interested in high-level cognitive phenomena such as conceptual systems, abstraction, and inference mechanisms, as they manifest themselves naturally through largely unconscious bodily/mental activity (e.g., gesture production co-produced with a variety of conceptual mappings). He is the author of Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being.

In this episode, we talk about embodied cognition, time and space, and mathematics. We first discuss embodied cognition. We talk about how we process time and space cognitively. We then get into what numbers are, and how numerical cognition develops. Finally, we discuss where mathematics comes from.
