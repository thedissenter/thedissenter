RECORDED ON DECEMBER 11th 2025.  
Keegan Kjeldsen is the host of the YouTube channel essentialsalts (@untimelyreflections), a doom metal guitarist, and host of The Nietzsche Podcast.

In this episode, we talk about aspects of Nietzsche’s philosophy, and discuss whether he was an irrationalist; truth, perspectivism, and science; Nietzsche’s approach to politics; authenticity, and whether someone who embraces slave morality can be authentic; and Nietzsche's moral project. Finally, we talk about how we can psychologize Nietzsche.
