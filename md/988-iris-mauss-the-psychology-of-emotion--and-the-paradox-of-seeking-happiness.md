RECORDED ON MARCH 14th 2024.  
Dr. Iris Mauss is a Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley.  Her research focuses on emotions and emotion regulation, with an emphasis on their links to psychological and physical health. In her research, she uses measures of emotion experience, behavior, and physiological responding, and combine laboratory, daily-diary, and longitudinal survey approaches.

In this episode, we explore the psychology of emotion. We first discuss what emotion is, its importance to mental health, how emotion relates to cognition, and good and bad emotions. We then talk about emotion regulation, the factors that play a role in it, the role of context, and gender differences in emotion regulation. We discuss the role of culture in mental health, and how to improve emotion regulation, particularly through cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness. Finally, we discuss the paradoxical effects of valuing and seeking happiness.
