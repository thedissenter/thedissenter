RECORDED ON MAY 31st 2024.  
Dr. Cara Ocobock is Associate Professor and Director of the Human Energetics Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame. Her research program integrates human biology and anthropology, with a focus on the interaction between anatomy, physiology, evolution, and the environment. She explores the physiological and behavioral mechanisms necessary to cope with and adapt to extreme climate and physical activity. Dr. Ocobock’s research is at the intersection of metabolic physiology, evolution, culture, and behavior.

In this episode, we first talk about human energetics, how people adapt to extreme environments, the case of the reindeer herders from Finland, the role of the adipose tissue in metabolism, issues with BMI measurements, and sex differences in human energetics. We then explore the debate in anthropology about hunting, and whether women also participated in it, and we discuss “Man the Hunter”, evidence for women hunting, and the sexual division of labor. Finally, we talk about Drs. Ocobock and Roseman’s Scientific American article, “To Understand Sex, We Need to Ask the Right Questions”.
