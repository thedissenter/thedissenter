RECORDED ON MAY 28th 2025.  
Dr. Blake Roeber is the Michael P. Grace II Associate Professor of Philosophy at Notre Dame. He is also an Associate Editor at Philosophical Studies. He specializes in traditional epistemology, and he has further research interests in formal and social epistemology. His work focuses on the relationship between knowledge and rational action, the nature of belief, the value of knowledge, and issues in epistemology that shed light on fake news, political polarization, and related phenomena. He is the author of Political Humility: The Limits of Knowledge in Our Partisan Political Climate.

In this episode, we focus on Political Humility. We first talk about the main argument of the book, and discuss what is political knowledge, and what the terms “liberal” and “conservative” mean. We ask whether we should trust other people when they give us political information, and why we would need more political knowledge. We then talk about political humility, and why we are so confident in our own knowledge. Finally, we discuss on what epistemological grounds we can say that we have almost no political knowledge.
