RECORDED ON OCTOBER 2nd 2024.  
Will Storr is a British author, journalist and former photographer. He has been a contributing editor at Esquire and GQ Australia. He is the author of several books, including The Science of Storytelling, and The Status Game: On Human Life and How to Play It.

In this episode, we focus on The Status Game. We discuss what status is in human societies, the different ways it can manifest, and how we can acquire status through cooperation and prosociality. We then delve into an evolutionary account of status, as well as gender differences in how men and women compete for status, the psychological effects of low and high status, status games on social media, in-group/out-group competition, and how status works in egalitarian societies. We talk about how status games link to the development of personal preferences and social norms. Finally, we discuss seven rules to succeed in the status game, and whether we could create societies without status.
