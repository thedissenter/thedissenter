RECORDED ON JULY 16th 2025.  
Dr. Walter Scheidel is Dickason Professor in the Humanities and Professor of History at Stanford University. Dr. Scheidel's research ranges from ancient social and economic history and premodern historical demography to the comparative and transdisciplinary world history of inequality, state formation, and human welfare. He is particularly interested in connecting the humanities, the social sciences, and the life sciences. He is the author of several books, the most recent one being What Is Ancient History?

In this episode, we focus on What Is Ancient History? We first talk about the study of ancient history, and ancient history as a foundational phase. We then discuss how academics have approached ancient history, the focus on Greece and Rome, and the “Classics”, and ancient history in a multiethnic world. Finally, we talk about what can be done to improve the study of ancient history, the impact of ancient history on our lives today, and the future of ancient studies.
