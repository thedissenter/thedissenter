RECORDED ON AUGUST 26th 2024.  
Dr. Nadine Strossen is the John Marshall Harlan II Professor of Law Emerita at New York Law School and past President of the American Civil Liberties Union (1991-2008). She is also a Senior Fellow with FIRE (the Foundation for Individual Rights and Education) and a leading expert and frequent speaker/media commentator on constitutional law and civil liberties. She serves on the advisory boards of the ACLU, Academic Freedom Alliance, Heterodox Academy, National Coalition Against Censorship, and the University of Austin. Her latest book is Defending Pornography: Free Speech, Sex, and the Fight for Women's Rights.

In this episode, we focus on Defending Pornography. We start by defining “pornography”. We then go through the main arguments put forward by anti-porn feminists, and the counterarguments used by the anti-censorship feminists. We discuss whether pornography is harmful to the viewers, how censoring porn can also target sexual education in schools, as well as LGBTQ+ people. We talk about the traits of people who are against pornography. We discuss paternalism in the context of pornography, and how censorship can harm porn performers. We talk about approaches such as legalization and decriminalization, and how we can fight against trafficking. Finally, we discuss how important it is to hear from the performers themselves.
