This is our seventh talk. We first discuss how stories should be adapted to the screen, and to what extent the source material should be changed. We then talk about how to write proper characters, and how to thread the line between character development and making a character behave out of character. We also discuss how much a story needs to be planned. Finally, we talk about how to imbue stories with morality and politics.
