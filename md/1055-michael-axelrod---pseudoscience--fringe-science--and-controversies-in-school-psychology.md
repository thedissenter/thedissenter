RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 18th 2024.  
Dr. Michael Axelrod is Director of the Human Development Center and a Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire. He is a Nationally Certified School Psychologist and Licensed Psychologist. He is editor of Investigating School Psychology: Pseudoscience, Fringe Science, and Controversies.

In this episode, we focus on Investigating School Psychology. We first talk about what school psychology is, why such a book is needed, why school psychology is susceptible to pseudoscience, cognitive errors and fallacies, and historical examples of pseudoscience. We then explore contemporary examples, like zero-tolerance policies; prevention of suicide and risky behaviors; IQ tests; projective drawings; learning styles; and motivational theories. Finally, we discuss what educators can learn from this.
