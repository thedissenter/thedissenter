RECORDED ON OCTOBER 17th 2024.  
Dr. David Pinsof is a research scientist who received his PhD in Psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2018. David’s research focuses on evolutionary psychology, political psychology, public opinion, and sexual behavior. His empirical work explores individual differences in mating psychology and their relation to political attitudes, mathematical models of alliance formation, and the origins of political belief systems.

In this episode, we talk about incentives and opinions from an evolutionary perspective. First, we discuss how behavior is determined by incentives, where incentives stem from, and how we deal with conflicting incentives. We talk about our need to look virtuous while seeming humble, the tie between incentives and morality, our need for narratives, and what makes a person likeable. We then get into opinions, and discuss what they are; minority opinions; how opinions become norms; and opinion games in science and how science really works. Finally, we talk about how when we present arguments, we are trying to convince other people that we are right, and not really searching for truth.
