RECORDED ON APRIL 8th 2025.  
Dr. Vicky Oelze is an Associate Professor in the Anthropology Department and Director of the Primate Ecology & Molecular Anthropology Lab at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Her research interests include mobility and dietary adaptations in archaeological human populations; African strontium isoscapes and isotopic investigations of the Atlantic and transatlantic slave trade; the dietary ecology of extant African great apes; great ape breastfeeding and weaning; and chimpanzee tool use and termite-chimpanzee interactions.

In this episode, we talk about the diets of great apes and the evolution of the human diet. We start by talking about how we can study human diets through archaeological and fossil remains. We discuss the diets of other great apes, and what we can tell about our last common ancestor and the earlier hominins. We then talk about the human diet in the Paleolithic, and whether there really is a “paleo diet”. Finally, we talk about the changes to our diet that were brought about by agriculture.
