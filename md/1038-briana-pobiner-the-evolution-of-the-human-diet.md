RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 12th 2024.  
Dr. Briana Pobiner is a paleoanthropologist and educator at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Her research centers on the evolution of human diet (with a focus on meat-eating), but has included topics as diverse as human cannibalism and chimpanzee carnivory. She has done fieldwork in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, and Indonesia and has been supported in her research by the Fulbright-Hays program, the Leakey Foundation, the National Geographic Society, the National Science Foundation, Rutgers University, the Society for American Archaeology, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Wenner-Gren Foundation.

In this episode, we talk about the evolution of the human diet. We first explore the ways we study the diets of extinct species, and animal models like chimpanzees. We delve into the diet of H. erectus, and the evolution of meat-eating in hominins. We discuss how bone marks are interpreted. We talk about how our diet might have changed after H. erectus. We discuss whether there really is a “paleo diet”. We touch briefly on the topic of human cannibalism. Finally, we talk about the challenges of teaching human evolution.
