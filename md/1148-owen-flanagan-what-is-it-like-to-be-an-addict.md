This is our third interview. You can watch the first one, on The Geography of Morals, here: https://youtu.be/1jEyXTmzdzM. And our second one, on Against Happiness, here: https://youtu.be/zRR5UHiVACY

In this episode, we focus on What Is It Like to Be an Addict? We first discuss what addiction is, and the concepts of disease, disorder, and dysfunction. We talk about social stigma and whether it works in fighting against addiction. We discuss whether addicts can stop being addicts. We talk about subjective realism, and why a subjective account of addiction is important. We also talk about willing, unwilling, and resigned addicts, and whether addicts are responsible for their own behavior. Finally, we talk about treatments for addiction.
