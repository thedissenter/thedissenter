RECORDED ON DECEMBER 15th 2025.  
Rebecca Love is an adult film actress who has been in the industry since 1995. She furthered her career and had the opportunity to be in Erotica Films on HBO, Showtime and Cinemax. She is also the cofounder of “Adult Film Star Network” which educates people in the adult industry.

In this episode, we talk about how Rebecca got into pornography. We tackle assumptions people make about sex workers, negative attitudes toward sex and sex workers, what sex workers really need from society and politicians. We also discuss the behavior of hypocrites who say they are against sex work, patronizing attitudes toward sex workers, and how sex workers can be humanized. Finally, we talk about Rebecca’s Adult Film Star Network, sex education and female sexual pleasure, and whether sex workers need any saving.
