RECORDED ON JUNE 19th 2025.  
Dr. Hanna Schleihauf is Assistant Professor in the Department for Developmental Psychology at Utrecht University. She studies the roots of human diversity: although each of us shares 99.99% of our genes with every other human on the planet, there is massive variation in our socio-cultural practices driven by our ability to learn from and interact with others. Her research investigates socio-cognitive underpinnings of cultural learning, focusing on how cultural novices, children during early and middle childhood, grow into proficient cultural beings.

In this episode, we first talk about when and how children start considering other people’s beliefs, the kinds of beliefs people care about, fact-based beliefs and value-based beliefs, and intuitions about people’s control over their own beliefs. We then talk about belief revision and how it develops in children. We discuss what people consider to be good reasoning. Finally, we talk about recent exciting findings that suggest that chimpanzees respond to higher-order evidence.
