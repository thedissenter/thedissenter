RECORDED ON MAY 27th 2024.  
Dr. Mark Rank is Herbert S. Hadley Professor of Social Welfare at the George Warren Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Rank is widely recognized as one of the foremost experts and speakers on issues of poverty, inequality, and social justice. He is the author of several books, the latest one being The Random Factor: How Chance and Luck Profoundly Shape Our Lives and the World around Us.

In this episode, we focus on The Random Factor. We discuss what “randomness” means, how ancient people thought about chance and luck, the role of change in biological evolution, and whether randomness is studied in the social sciences. We talk about chance in human history; scientific discoveries and technological innovations; the lottery of life; the role of gender, race, and social class in life outcomes; poverty and economic inequality; and careers, marriage, and professional success. We discuss why many people dismiss the role of chance and luck in their lives, how individual agency fits into the picture, why politicians should keep randomness in mind when designing social policy, and reframing meritocracy.
