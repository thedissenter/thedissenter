RECORDED ON MARCH 24th 2025.  
Dr. Vanessa Christina Wills is Associate Professor of Philosophy at The George Washington University. Her areas of specialization are moral, social, and political philosophy, nineteenth century German philosophy (especially Karl Marx), and the philosophy of race. Her research is importantly informed by her study of Marx’s work, and focuses on how socioeconomic arrangements can inhibit or promote the realization of values such as freedom, equality, and human development. She is the author of Marx’s Ethical Vision.

In this episode, we focus on Marx’s Ethical Vision. We start by discussing Marxism and morality, and whether morality is a form of ideology. We talk about human nature, normativity, and the “rich individual”. We discuss “bourgeois” ethics, individuality, and human rights. We talk about the idea of abolishing morality, and how life would be like in a fully developed communist society. We also talk about the failures of neoliberal capitalism, the role of intellectuals, and intersectionality.
