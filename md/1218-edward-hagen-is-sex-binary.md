RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 24th 2025.  
Dr. Edward Hagen is Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at Washington State University. His research takes an evolutionary approach to non-infectious diseases, with a focus on mental health.

In this episode, we talk about Dr. Agustín Fuentes’ book Sex Is a Spectrum, and we discuss whether sex is binary. We start by discussing his main argument, and then talk about the evolution of sex and anisogamy, how to define “male” and “female”, the ratio of males to females, Thomas Laqueur’s account of Western ideas about sex, the use of the terms “3G males” and “3G females”, and the Bateman gradient. We also talk about sexual selection, behavioral sex differences, and the sexual division of labor. We discuss the idea of humans as a biocultural species, and the distinction between sex and gender. We talk about intersex people, trans people, and human rights. We discuss what science would be giving up if it ditched the binary sex concept, and whether the sex binary can be harmful. Finally, we discuss whether the idea that sex is a spectrum is pseudoscience.
