RECORDED ON AUGUST 8th 2024.  
Dr. Joel Marks is professor emeritus of philosophy at the University of New Haven and a Bioethics Center Scholar at Yale University. His main areas of scholarly interest have been theoretical and applied ethics, both having come together in recent years in thinking about animal ethics. Meanwhile a new area of interest is planetary defense (against comets and asteroids). He is the author of several books, including the latest one, The Spread: and other essays on moralism and guilt.

In this episode, we focus on The Spread. We start by discussing where morals stem from; the roles of blaming, guilt, and shame; and what “objective moral values” really mean. We talk about a scientific account of morality. We discuss whether if makes sense for atheists to believe in objective moral values. We talk about desirism, rationality, and analetheism (is truth real?). Finally, we discuss whether it would be feasible to abolish morality, and if amoralists would just be immoral people.
