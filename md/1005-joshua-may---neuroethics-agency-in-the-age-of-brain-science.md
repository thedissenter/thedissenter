RECORDED ON APRIL 24th 2024.  
Dr. Joshua May is Professor of Philosophy and Psychology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He works in ethics and cognitive science. His latest book is Neuroethics: Agency in the Age of Brain Science. 

In this episode, we focus on Neuroethics. We start by discussing what neuroethics is, and then we explore topics like free will; brain manipulation and medical interventions; mental disorder, stigma, and neurodiversity; addiction and brain diseases; moral enhancement; and neuromarketing. Finally, we talk about alarmism and neurohype, and how we can have a more nuanced and balanced approach to neuroscience and neuroethics.
