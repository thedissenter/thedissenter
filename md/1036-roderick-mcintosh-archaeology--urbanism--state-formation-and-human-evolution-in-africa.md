RECORDED ON JULY 10th 2023.  
Dr. Roderick McIntosh is Clayton Stephenson Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at Yale University, Curator of Anthropology at the Peabody Museum, New Haven, and Honorary Distinguished Professor of Archaeology at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. His interests are in African and Old World comparative prehistory, intellectual history of prehistoric archaeology, ethnicity and specialization and the origin of authority in complex society, urbanism, geomorphology and palaeoclimate, and more topics. Dr. McIntosh has been a Guggenheim Fellow, twice a Fulbright Senior Fellow (Senegal and Mali), and has held a fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (Stanford).

In this episode, we talk about archaeology in Africa. We start by discussing why Africa was dismissed for so long in Archaeology. We talk about urbanism and state formation in Africa, and the example of the Niger Bend. We discuss if West Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa was really culturally stagnant before interventions from North Africa. We talk about prehistoric migrations across Africa, and the origins of H. sapiens. We discuss what the study of Africa and African populations adds to Anthropology and Archaeology. Finally, we talk about African paleoclimate, and how Anthropology can contribute to the study of climate change.
