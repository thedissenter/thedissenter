RECORDED ON JULY 29th 2025.  
Dr. Mark Alfano is Professor of Philosophy at Macquarie University. Dr. Alfano uses tools and methods from philosophy and the sciences to explore topics in moral psychology, epistemology, and digital humanities. He studies how people become and remain virtuous, how values become integrated into people's lives, and how these virtues and values are (or fail to be) manifested in their perception, thoughts, feelings, deliberations, and behavior. He’s the author of books like Character as Moral Fiction, Nietzsche's Moral Psychology, and Nietzsche on Virtue.

In this episode, we focus on Nietzsche on Virtue. We start by talking about the premise and methodology of the book. We discuss what virtues are, the relationship between drives and virtues, types of people, how one can understand one’s own type, and how to deal with people who are of different types than us. We discuss the role of solitude, and amor fati. Finally, we discuss whether Nietzsche has a metaethical position.
