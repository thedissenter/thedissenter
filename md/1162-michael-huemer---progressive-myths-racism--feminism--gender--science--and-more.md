Dr. Michael Huemer is a professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado. He is the author of more than seventy academic articles in epistemology, ethics, metaethics, metaphysics, and political philosophy, as well as several books, like Skepticism and the Veil of Perception, Ethical Intuitionism, The Problem of Political Authority, Approaching Infinity, Paradox Lost, and Dialogues on Ethical Vegetarianism. His latest book is Progressive Myths.

In this episode, we focus on Progressive Myths. We start by discussing what a myth is. We talk about how criminal cases get portrayed on the media, whether the police are racists, what causes crime, and the idea of systemic racism. We discuss feminist myths like the gender pay gap, and campus rape culture. We talk about gender and trans people. We discuss generational wealth, and whether the rich are paying their fair share of taxes. We talk about what it means to trust the science, scientific consensus, and the case of climate change. Finally, we discuss whether political myths are widespread, whether political beliefs are different from other beliefs, and how people can find reliable sources of information.
