RECORDED ON AUGUST 28th 2024.  
Dr. L. Syd M. Johnson is a philosopher/bioethicist/neuroethicist, a Clinical Ethics Consultant, and Associate Professor of Bioethics and Humanities at SUNY Upstate Medical University. She is a member of the Neuroethics Working Group of the NIH BRAIN Initiative, Associate Editor for Neuroethics, and the co-founder of the American Society for Bioethics + Humanities Animal Bioethics Affinity Group. Her research focuses on ethical issues related to brain injuries, including sport-related neurotrauma, brain death, and disorders of consciousness. She is the author of Philosophical, Medical, and Legal Controversies About Brain Death.

In this episode, we focus on Philosophical, Medical, and Legal Controversies About Brain Death. We tackle the concept of “death” from a medical and legal perspective, and how it is commonly understood. We explore how the concept of “brain death” evolved over time, the different types of brain death, brain-body dualism in medicine, and the metaphysical and moral commitments behind brain death. We go through epistemic, medical, and ethical challenges to brain death. We discuss what happens when there is conflict in worldviews between patients and doctors, and the value of patient autonomy. Finally, we talk about reasonable objections to the medical view of death.
