RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 11th 2025.  
Dr. Nathan H. Lents is Professor of Biology at John Jay College. Dr. Lents is noted for his work in cell biology, genetics, and forensic science, as well as his popular science writing and blogging on the evolution of human biology and behavior. He is the author of several books, the most recent one being The Sexual Evolution: How 500 Million Years of Sex, Gender, and Mating Shape Modern Relationships.

In this episode, we focus on The Sexual Evolution. We first discuss what we can learn by looking at the natural history of sex, and how sex is defined. We talk about gender, homosexuality and same-sex behaviors, and whether reproduction is the only goal of sex. We also discuss monogamy and mating systems, and trans people from a biological perspective. Finally, we talk about where prejudice against diversity stems from.
