Dr. Ashley Randall is a Professor in the School of Counseling and Counseling Psychology at Arizona State University. She studies couples’ interpersonal emotion regulation. Although stressful experiences can have deleterious effects on individual well-being in a variety relationships and settings, romantic partners are in a unique position to regulate each other’s emotions during times of distress.

We talk about minority stress theory, how couples can deal with stress, and the relationship between sexual orientation discrimination and depression among same-sex couples. Finally, Dr. Randall gives some advice for couples who are facing stress.
