RECORDED ON OCTOBER 29th 2024.  
Dr. Thaís Pansani is an Associate Researcher at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Her main research questions are about human interaction with the Pleistocene megafauna in the Americas and the peopling of the Americas. She is interested in questions like: When did humans arrive in the Americas? Did humans interact with the Pleistocene megafauna? What were the environmental and ecological conditions in which these megamammals lived? What were the causes and consequences of the megafauna extinction in the American continent, especially in South America? How can we identify traces of human interaction in extinct animal bones through taphonomy and zooarchaeology?

In this episode, we focus on H. sapiens’ migrations to (and within) the Americas. We discuss the timing of the migrations, whether we were the only hominin species to get there, and why we migrate. We then talk about megafauna in the Americas; interactions between humans and megafauna (with a focus on hunting); zooarchaeology, and the study of marks on animal bones; and the extinction of megafauna might have been the result of human activity. Finally, we discuss some of the most interesting unanswered questions in paleoanthropology.
