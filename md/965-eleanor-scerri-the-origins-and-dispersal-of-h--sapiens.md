RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 5th 2024.  
Dr. Eleanor Scerri is Professor at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology, where she is the Head of the independent Max Planck Human Palaeosystems Research Group. She is an archaeological scientist interested in exploring the articulation between material culture, genetics, and biogeography to further theoretical, methodological and scientific advances in the field of human evolution. Her group is exploring the pan-African evolution of our species, Homo sapiens through a number of diverse projects.

In this episode, we talk about human evolution. We start by discussing how it is studied. We then get into debates surrounding the origins of H. sapiens, and whether we evolved in one single population or across subdivided populations in Africa. We tackle a paper about human origins in “a southern African palaeo-wetland” from 2019, and we discuss why questions surrounding human origins might be problematic, focusing on science communication and politics. We talk about how diverse were the landscapes we inhabited across Africa. We then get into ot-of-Africa migrations by H. sapiens, what accounted for the success of the last one, and the routes H. sapiens took out of Africa and their timings. Finally, we talk about H. sapiens in Saudi Arabia.
