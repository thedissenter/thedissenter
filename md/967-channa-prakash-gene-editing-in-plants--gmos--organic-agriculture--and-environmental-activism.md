RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 7th 2024.  
Dr. Channa Prakash is Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Tuskegee University (USA). His research expertise is on genetic improvement of food crops of importance to developing countries and training of scientists and students in plant biotechnology. Dr. Prakash has also been actively involved in enhancing the societal awareness of food biotechnology issues around the world. He has earlier served on the USDA's Agricultural Biotechnology Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee for the Department of Biotechnology for the government of India. He is a Fellow of the American College of Nutrition (FACN).

In this episode, we start by talking about gene editing techniques in plants, how they compare to GMOs, the goals of gene editing in plants, and its challenges. We discuss misconceptions surrounding GMOs, how the European Union deals with GMOs, the failed promises of organic agriculture, and the negative consequences of its adoption in Sri Lanka. Finally, we talk about environmental activism.
