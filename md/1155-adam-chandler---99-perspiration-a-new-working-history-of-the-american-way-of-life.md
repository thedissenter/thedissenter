RECORDED ON JUNE 30th 2025.  
Adam Chandler is a journalist and author based in New York. A former staff writer at The Atlantic, his work has also appeared in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, WIRED, Vox, Slate, New York Magazine, Texas Monthly, Esquire, TIME, and elsewhere. He is the author of Drive-Thru Dreams: A Journey Through the Heart of America's Fast-Food Kingdom; and 99% Perspiration: A New Working History of the American Way of Life.

In this episode, we focus on 99% Perspiration. We start by talking about American meritocracy, and where the ideas associated with it came from. We discuss whether anyone is ever self-reliant. We talk about how people tend to get rich. We discuss neoliberalism and the rise of hustle culture. We talk about the example of France, as a country with another type of work culture. We discuss whether we should tell people that hard work pays off. Finally, we talk about the future of work in the US.
