Dr. Daniel Silverman is an Assistant Professor of Political Science in the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy and Technology (CMIST) at Carnegie Mellon University. His research focuses on international security, political psychology, and the politics of the Middle East and the wider Islamic world. He is particularly interested in the psychological factors – including the biases and misperceptions – that drive violent conflicts, and how they can be mitigated or leveraged to promote peace. He is the author of Seeing Is Disbelieving: Why People Believe Misinformation in War, and When They Know Better.

In this episode, we focus on Seeing Is Disbelieving. We start by discussing why misinformation (in war) matters, and whether misinformation translates into actual behavior. We then talk about what makes people susceptible to misinformation, and methods to study this. We go through examples like the US drone campaign in the tribal regions of Pakistan, the Syrian civil war, and Ukraine and Gaza. Finally, we discuss what we can learn from this knowledge, and whether it could have policy implications.
