RECORDED ON JUNE 3rd 2024.  
Dr. Anna Puzio is a Researcher in the ESDiT Research Programme (Ethics of Socially Disruptive Technologies) at the University of Twente. She is a philosopher, theologian and ethicist. Her research areas include anthropology, anthropology and ethics of technology and environmental ethics.

In this episode, we start by talking about social robots: what they are, humanoid robots, the issues with anthropomorphizing them, and whether they can be moral patients. We then discuss how technological change can impact the way we understand human beings, digital identities and posthumanism, and implications for anthropology. We also talk about religious robots and their functions, and the ethics of transhumanism. Finally, we talk about digital afterlives and their ethical implications.
