RECORDED ON OCTOBER 31st 2025.  
Dr. Omer Bartov is Dean’s Professor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Brown University. Dr. Bartov's early research concerned the Nazi indoctrination of the Wehrmacht and the crimes it committed in World War II, analyzed in his books, The Eastern Front, 1941-1945, and Hitler's Army. He then turned to the links between total war and genocide, discussed in his books Murder in Our Midst, Mirrors of Destruction, and Germany's War and the Holocaust.

In this episode, we talk about the genocide in Gaza. We start by discussing how the concept of genocide was created, how it differs from the concept of ethnic cleansing, and how to prove intent. We then go through the main sources of evidence to claim that there is/was a genocide in Gaza. We debunk arguments and claims made by the Israeli government, Israeli spokespeople, and political pundits. We discuss how the Israeli government should have responded to October 7th, the current ceasefire, and whether the genocide is still ongoing. Finally, we talk about the state of Palestine, and whether a two-state solution is still possible.
