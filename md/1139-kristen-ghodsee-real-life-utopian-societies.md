Dr. Kristen Ghodsee is an award-winning author and professor and chair of Russian and East European Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. She also serves as a member on the graduate groups of Anthropology and Comparative Literature.

In this episode, we focus on Everyday Utopia. We first discuss what is a “utopia”, social experiments in the 18th and 19th centuries, and Pythagoras. We talk about family and gender roles, the cohousing movement in Denmark, the Israeli kibbutzim, matriarchal Colombian ecovillages, planned microdistricts in China, and monastic life. We also discuss the importance of education, communism, what we can learn by studying these societies, and the difficulties in implementing utopia.
