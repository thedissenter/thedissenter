RECORDED ON JANUARY 18th 2024.  
Dr. Tobias Gerstenberg is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Stanford University, where he leads the Causality in Cognition Lab (CICL). Dr. Gerstenberg's research is highly interdisciplinary. It combines ideas from philosophy, linguistics, computer science, and the legal sciences to better understand higher-level cognitive phenomena such as causal inference and moral judgment.

In this episode, we talk about causal cognition. We first discuss what it is, and what it means to attribute causality. We talk about counterfactual thinking, intuitive ideas about causality, causation by omission, and how people single out “the” cause. We also talk about causal learning in continuous-time settings, and then get into how causal cognition connects to attributions of moral responsibility, and how people deal with knowledgeable versus ignorant agents, and the role that intentions play. Finally, we discuss the relationship between intuitive physics and intuitive psychology, and moral judgment.
