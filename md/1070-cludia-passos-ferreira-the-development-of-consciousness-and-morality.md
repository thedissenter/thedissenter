RECORDED ON JANUARY 6th 2025.  
Dr. Cláudia Passos Ferreira is an Assistant Professor of Bioethics at New York University. Dr. Passos Ferreira has published on philosophy, psychology, and neuroethics.  She has collaborated in cross-cultural research on moral development and social cognition (on topics such as empathy, fairness, ownership, intersubjectivity). Her current research program focuses on the development of consciousness, including what theories of consciousness say about infant consciousness and machine consciousness, and how these theories shed light on ethical issues. 

In this episode, we first talk about consciousness, how to determine that a being is conscious, early conscious states in preverbal infantas, and self-knowledge and a first-person perspective. We then discuss moral development, and the importance of empathy.
