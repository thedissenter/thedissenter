RECORDED ON JUNE 9th 2025.  
Dr. Gül Salali is Assistant Professor in Evolutionary Anthropology at University College London. Her research focuses on human behavior and health using evolutionary approaches. Since 2013, she has been conducting fieldwork in the Congo rainforest studying Mbendjele BaYaka hunter-gatherers. Some of her most recent research projects include: social learning and cultural evolution; evolutionary approaches to health-related behavior and mental health; and hunter-gatherer diet, health and physical activity.

In this episode, we start by talking about the transition from small-scale human groups to large-scale ones, and cumulative culture. We discuss Dr. Salali’s work on the Mbendjele BaYaka hunter-gatherers, future discounting, Global WEIRDing, the social organization of hunter-gatherers, mental health in hunter-gatherers and industrialized societies, physical health, and alcohol consumption among hunter-gatherers. Finally, we talk about childcare networks and learning to parent.
