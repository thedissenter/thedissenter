RECORDED ON MARCH 21st 2025.  
Dr. Paul Seabright is British Professor of Economics in the Industrial Economics Institute and Toulouse School of Economics at the University of Toulouse, France. His research focuses on microeconomic theory, development economics, industrial policy in transition economies, and state aids to industry. He is the author of The Divine Economy: How Religions Compete for Wealth, Power, and People.

In this episode, we focus on The Divine Economy. We first discuss how economics applies to the study of religion. We talk about how relevant religions institutions are today, religions as businesses, how religions are so successful, how religion has evolved, whether women are more religious than men, abstruse aspects of theology and ritual, the success of religions without central authority, and the relationship between religious power and political power. We discuss if there could be a religious authoritarian backlash against equality, democracy, and rights for minorities. Finally, we talk about the future of religiosity and secularism, and how we can manage religious power for the good of everyone.
