RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 28th 2023.  
Dr. Sergio Almécija is Senior Research Scientist in Biological Anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History. He studies the key adaptations defining different stages of ape and human evolution (i.e., hominoid evolution). He pays special attention to the process leading and following the split between humans and apes (i.e., “non-human hominoids”). He is the editor of Humans: Perspectives on Our Evolution from World Experts.

In this episode, we focus on Humans. We start by talking about the story behind the book, and how Dr. Almécija came up with the questions asked to the experts. We discuss what the antecedents of human evolution are, and the relationship between primatology and anthropology. We talk about what it means to be human according to anthropology, and the insights we can get from other disciplines, like medicine, psychology, and philosophy. We discuss what were the questions the experts disagreed the most on, and the biggest known unknowns in human evolution. Finally, we discuss whether a scientific perspective on humans is compatible with religious or spiritual views.
