RECORDED ON MARCH 18th 2024.  
Dr. Monte Johnson is a Professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of California, San Diego. He teaches and researches Greco-Roman philosophy and its influence on the history of philosophy and science. His main projects involve reconstructing a lost dialogue of Aristotle (the Protrepticus), and demonstrating the influence of Democritus on Hellenistic ethics. He has a growing interest in comparing Greco-Roman philosophy with other ancient wisdom traditions and literatures.

In this episode, we talk about Aristotle, Democritus, and Greco-Roman philosophy. We start with Aristotle, and discuss scientific unity, mechanistic and teleological explanations, the meaning of life, and the relationship between biology and theology. In regards to Democritus, we talk about his cosmology, his sociopolitical philosophy, and his ethics. We discuss Greco-Roman philosophy, and how it relates to other ancient philosophical traditions. Finally, Dr. Johnson tells us about a project of his regarding the translation of Pierre Gassendi’s “Epicurus’ System of Philosophy”.
