RECORDED ON OCTOBER 3rd 2024.  
Andrea Zagaria is a PhD student at the University of Trento, Italy. His research interests include psychopathology and theoretical psychology. His research is informed by cultural evolutionary theory.

In this episode, we discuss whether evolutionary psychology is a scientific revolution, as claimed by David Buss. We start by talk about the trends and prominence of four major schools of thought in scientific Psychology (neuroscience, cognitivism, behaviorism, and psychoanalysis), and we discuss why scientific psychology is a nonparadigmatic discipline, and the issue of insularity of psychological subdisciplines. We then discuss what a scientific revolution is, and whether evolutionary psychology is one. We also talk about cultural evolutionary theory, and the study of meaning and sense-making. Finally, we discuss the primary topics of study in evolutionary psychology, and whether psychology can become a paradigmatic discipline in the future.
