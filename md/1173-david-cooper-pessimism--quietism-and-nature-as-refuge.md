RECORDED ON AUGUST 7th 2025.  
Dr. David Cooper is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at Durham University. He has published across a broad range of philosophical subjects, including philosophy of language, philosophy of education, ethics, aesthetics, environmental philosophy, animal ethics, philosophy of technology, philosophy of religion, history of both Western philosophy and Asian philosophy, and modern European philosophy, especially Heidegger, Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein. He is the author of several books, the most recent one being Pessimism, Quietism and Nature as Refuge.

In this episode, we focus on Pessimism, Quietism and Nature as Refuge. We start by discussing what is misanthropy, what is pessimism, and how pessimism combines with misanthropy. We talk about the human condition, and whether it can be improved. We then get into quietism, nature as refuge, and preserving nature.
