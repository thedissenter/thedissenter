In this episode, we focus on Your Brain on Altruism. We talk about individualism in the self-care industrial complex. We discuss altruism in moments of crisis and how we can maintain it. We talk about the neuroscience of altruism. We discuss systemic caring, and how we can build a society around it. We also discuss why there is burnout among caregivers. Finally, we talk about what people can do if they cannot give to others.
