RECORDED ON AUGUST 11th 2025.  
Dr. Matti Häyry is Professor of Philosophy at Aalto University School of Business, Finland. Dr. Häyry’s main fields of interest have been moral and political philosophy and philosophical bioethics. His practical topics in bioethics have ranged from abortion, euthanasia, and resource allocation to genetics, systems biology, and synthetic biology. Theoretically, his work has centered on the main normative doctrines of European moral and political philosophy. He is the co-author of Pure Cloning.

In this episode, we focus on Pure Cloning. We first define pure and impure cloning. We go through theological objections to human cloning; theoretical moralities, including utilitarianism, deontology, and teleological moralities; ideological rationalities, including the Georgetown principles, and the Barcelona Declaration; and feminist bioethics. Finally, we discuss the relationship between pure cloning and reproduction in general, and the link with antinatalism.
