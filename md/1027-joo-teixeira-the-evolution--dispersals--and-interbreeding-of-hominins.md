RECORDED ON DECEMBER 14th 2023.  
Dr. João Teixeira is Australian Research Council DECRA Fellow at the Evolution of Cultural Diversity Initiative, School of Culture, History and Language at the Australian National University & Scientific Vice-Coordinator at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies of the University of Coimbra. He is a population geneticist focusing on the evolution of humans and closely related species. His main research focus revolves around human evolution during the Pleistocene, in particular the admixture events between so-called modern and archaic humans after the out-of-Africa and before human colonization of Sahul. He is expert on uncovering signatures of natural selection in the genome, in particular balancing selection, and continue to study how advantageous genetic diversity can be maintained for millions of years in natural populations.

In this episode, we start by discussing what are modern and archaic humans. We talk about out-of-Africa migrations by H. sapiens and other hominins. We discuss how hominin species are classified. We talk about the Neanderthals and the Denisovans, and how they interbred with H. sapiens. We discuss whether the Neanderthals really went extinct. We talk about what we can learn from genetics about human evolution, and specifically admixture and human dispersals. Finally, we discuss balancing selection and trans-species polymorphisms, and the implications they have for how we understand human evolution.
