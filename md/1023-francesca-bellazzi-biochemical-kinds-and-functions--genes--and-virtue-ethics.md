RECORDED ON OCTOBER 15th 2024.  
Dr. Francesca Bellazzi is Postdoctoral Researcher in the ERC project Assembling Life at  the Centre for Philosophy and the Sciences (CPS) in the Department of Philosophy, Classics, History, Art and Ideas (UiO) at the University of Oslo, Teaching Fellow in Philosophy at the Department of Philosophy, Theology and Religion at the University of Birmingham, Honorary Research Fellow in Philosophy at the Department of Science and Technology at UCL, and Honorary Visiting Fellow in Philosophy at the University of Bristol. She is interested in the complexity of the interactions between different entities. In particular, she is fascinated by the interface between chemistry and biology. She also has several side projects that consider the ethical aspects of science, in particular focusing on virtue ethics and epistemic injustice.

In this episode, we talk about philosophy of science, with a focus on functions and kinds. We discuss what functions and kinds are, broadly speaking. We discuss natural kinds, and then we get into biochemistry, and talk about biochemical kinds, and biological and chemical functions. We discuss whether genes are natural kinds, and all the complexity of genetics, epigenetics, and the production of proteins. Finally, we talk about virtue ethics in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
