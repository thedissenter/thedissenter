RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 7th 2024.  
Dr. Mary Shenk is Associate Professor of Anthropology, Demography, and Asian Studies at Pennsylvania State University. She is a biocultural anthropologist, human behavioral ecologist, and anthropological demographer with interests in marriage, family, kinship, parental investment, fertility, mortality, and inequality. She has conducted field research on the economics of marriage and parental investment in urban South India, the causes of rapid fertility decline in rural Bangladesh, and the effects of market integration on wealth, social networks, and health in rural Bangladesh.

In this episode, we start by talking about an evolutionary account of the sexual division of labor. We then discuss the different kinds of kinships systems, and how they relate to the distribution of resources and the rise of gender disparities. We also talk about the link between religion and fertility. We discuss fertility decline across the world, and the different factors behind it, with a focus on women’s education. Finally, we talk about the evolution of social and economic inequality in human societies, and the transition from relatively equal societies to increasingly unequal societies.
