RECORDED ON JULY 7th 2024.  
Lawrence Anton has a YouTube channel on antinatalism - @LawrenceAnton.

In this episode, we discuss antinatalism. We start by talking about how Lawrence got into antinatalism. We then explore some of the most common arguments for antinatalism, like the asymmetry argument, whether we can say that life is objectively bad, whether death is a harm, and the argument based on consent. We also talk about the most compelling arguments against antinatalism. We discuss a thought experiment about being able to choose to never be born. We talk about the selfishness of arguments for having kids. Finally, we discuss extinctionism, whether human extinction would be good or bad, and arguments put forth by transhumanists and longtermists.
