RECORDED ON DECEMBER 10th 2025.  
Nina Hartley is a legendary pornographic film actress and sex educator. She has been described by Las Vegas Weekly as an "outspoken feminist" and "advocate for sexual freedom".

In this episode, we talk about Nina’s career in the porn industry. We talk about where people’s attitudes toward sex stem from, and how the porn industry has changed since the 1980s. We also discuss the feminist sexual revolution, the importance of sex education, sex-positive feminism, issues with feminists who are sex-negative, and whether sex should be part of healthcare.
