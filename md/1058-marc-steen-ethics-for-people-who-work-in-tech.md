RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 27th 2024.  
Dr. Marc Steen works as a senior research scientist at TNO, a leading research and technology organization in The Netherlands. He worked at Philips and KPN before joining TNO. He is an expert in Human-Centred Design, Value-Sensitive Design, Responsible Innovation, and Applied Ethics of Technology and Innovation. His mission is to promote the design and application of technologies in ways that help to create a just society in which people can live well together. He is the author of Ethics for People Who Work in Tech.

In this episode, we focus on Ethics for People Who Work in Tech. We talk about the ethics of technology, and a three-step approach to ethical reflection, inquiry, and deliberation. We discuss whether technology is neutral, what value is, the trolley problem, the importance of privacy for users, and responsibility. We talk about four different ethical approaches: consequentialism, deontology, relational ethics, and virtue ethics. We discuss where people can start when developing a new kind of technology, and we talk about three different methods: Human-Centred Design, Value Sensitive Design, and Responsible Innovation.
