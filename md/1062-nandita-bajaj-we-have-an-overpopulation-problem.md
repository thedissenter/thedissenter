RECORDED ON DECEMBER 5th 2024.  
Nandita Bajaj is the Executive Director of Population Balance, a US nonprofit that works to inspire narrative, behavioral, and system change that shrinks our human impact and elevates the rights and wellbeing of people, animals, and the planet. She also co-hosts The Overpopulation Podcast, a popular series that delves into the nuances of the drivers and impacts of human expansionism with expert guests.

In this episode, we start by talking about how we determined whether there is overpopulation or underpopulation. We discuss the factors behind birth rates, whether there is a relationship between childlessness and fertility rates, pronatalism, reproductive rights, environmentalism and climate change, a near-infinite economic growth mentality, and aging populations and social security.
