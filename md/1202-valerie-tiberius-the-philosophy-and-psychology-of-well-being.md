Dr. Valerie Tiberius is a Professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Minnesota. Her work explores the ways in which philosophy and psychology can both contribute to the study of well-being and virtue. She is the author of What Do You Want Out of Life?: A Philosophical Guide to Figuring Out What Matters.

In this episode, we focus on What do You Want Out of Life? We start by discussing well-being, what is intrinsically good for people, and how we decide our values. We also talk about reflective wisdom, what a good life is, how a good life relates to being moral, and the relationship between well-being and virtue. Finally, we talk about happiness, whether we should seek it, and the relationship between happiness and morality.
