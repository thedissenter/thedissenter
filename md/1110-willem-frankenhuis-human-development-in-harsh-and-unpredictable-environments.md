RECORDED ON APRIL 2nd 2025.  
Dr. Willem Frankenhuis is an Associate Professor of Evolutionary Psychobiology at the University of Amsterdam and a Senior Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Crime, Security and Law.  He studies how people develop in harsh and unpredictable environments. He also uses mathematical modeling to explore the evolution of plasticity, the ability of organisms to adjust to environmental conditions.

In this episode, we talk about human development in harsh and unpredictable environments. We start by defining harsh and unpredictable environments. We then talk about expected human childhood, repeated and chronic childhood adversity, strengths and abilities that develop in high-stress environments, hidden talents, enhanced emotion detection, adaptive impulsive behavior, present-oriented psychology, violence in deprived communities, and the development of resilience. Finally, we discuss phenotypic plasticity, and life history theory in psychology and biology.
