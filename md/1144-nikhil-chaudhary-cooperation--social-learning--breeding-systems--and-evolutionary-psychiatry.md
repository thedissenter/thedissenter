RECORDED ON JUNE 12th 2025.  
Dr. Nikhil Chaudhary is Lecturer in Human Evolutionary and Behavioral Ecology in the Department of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge. He is an evolutionary anthropologist interested in applying evolutionary theory to explain diversity in behavior and cognition across the entire spectrum of human societies. Currently, He is particularly focused on developing the field of evolutionary psychiatry. He is thinking about how evolutionary perspectives can advance our understanding of the etiology of mental illness.

In this episode, we talk about topics in evolutionary anthropology. We first delve into the evolution of human cooperation and relational wealth. We then talk about social learning processes and cumulative culture. We discuss cooperative and communal breeding systems. Finally, we talk about evolutionary psychiatry and evolutionary mismatch.
