RECORDED ON JUNE 6th 2024.  
Dr. Philip Cohen is Professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland. His research and teaching concern families and inequality. He writes about demographic trends, family structure, the division of labor, health disparities, and open science. He is the author of the popular textbook, The Family: Diversity, Inequality, and Social Change.

In this episode, we discuss whether it makes sense to talk about “generations”. We start by discussing what people mean by “generation”, and how generations are arbitrarily established. We talk about how many times people do not identify with their own generation, and the stereotypes associated with the silent generation, baby boomers, generation X, the millennials, and generation Z. We discuss cohort and life course research, and the use of cohorts instead of generations. We talk about sociological factors that make people from the same generation different from each other. We discuss negative stereotypes associated with Gen Z. Finally, we talk about how generation labels can affect research.
