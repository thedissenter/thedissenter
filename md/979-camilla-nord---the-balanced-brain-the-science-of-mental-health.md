RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 27th 2024.  
Dr. Camilla Nord is an Assistant Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Cambridge. She is currently particularly interested in understanding the overlap between homeostatic processes in the brain and body and mental health disorders. She is the author of The Balanced Brain: The Science of Mental Health.

In this episode, we focus on The Balanced Brain. We start by discussing why we should care about mental health, the idea of the “balanced brain”, what mental health is, the role of pleasure and pain, different routes to pleasure, and whether austerity is always the best route to mental health. We talk about connections between the brain and the body, focusing on the immune system, the gut, and the gut microbiome. We also discuss how expectations impact mental health, how motivation works, individual differences in responses to interventions, and placebos and nocebos. We discuss whether antidepressants work, what we know about psychedelics, whether and how psychotherapy works, electrical stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. Finally, we talk about what we ourselves can do for our mental health.
