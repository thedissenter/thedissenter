RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 4th 2025.  
Dr. Jonathan Ichikawa is a Professor of Philosophy and Department Head at the University of British Columbia. His main research areas are epistemology, philosophy of language, feminist philosophy, and ethics. He is particularly interested in connecting theoretical questions about the nature and significance of knowledge to moral, practical, and political questions, e.g. questions about structural oppression, rape culture, and the like. He is the author of Epistemic Courage.

In this episode, we focus on Epistemic Courage. We first talk about the ethics of belief and virtue epistemology. We explore what bad belief is, the negative bias, justification of belief, pragmatic and moral encroachment, and epistemic faith. We then delve into epistemic courage, and the example of testimony and rape culture. We talk about epistemic contextualism. Finally, we discuss how to approach misinformation and conspiracy theories.
