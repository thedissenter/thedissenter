RECORDED ON MAY 8th 2025.  
Dr. Daniel Fessler is a Professor of Biological Anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles. He is an evolutionary anthropologist whose principal focus is contemporary humans. His research currently focuses on a number of domains, including: emotions; disease avoidance; morality; prosociality and cooperation; conflict, aggression, and risk-taking; cultural transmission; food and eating; and sex and reproduction.

In this episode, we first talk about physical formidability: what it is, and how it is assessed in men and women. We then talk about preferences for male muscularity, and how men can overestimate the degree of muscularity women prefer. We also discuss moral parochialism and moral condemnation. We talk about ectoparasites, disgust, and pathogen-avoidance. Finally, we discuss the link between pathogen-avoidance and political and social conservatism, and what explains the reactions of liberals and conservatives to the COVID-19 pandemic.
