RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 28th 2024.  
Dr. Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen is Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature and French at the University of Washington in Seattle. His research interests include Critical Theory, French literary criticism, psychoanalysis, and psychology. He is the author of several books, his latest one being Freud’s Thinking: An Introduction.

In this episode, we focus on Freud’s Thinking. We start by talking about the premise of the book, and then go through some of Freud’s theories, including the unconscious; repression; trauma; hysteria; the Oedipus Complex; his theory of sexuality; drives, and the death drive; and his theory of culture. Then, we discuss whether Freud was a real scientist, the limitations of his clinical material, and how much credit we should give to him.
