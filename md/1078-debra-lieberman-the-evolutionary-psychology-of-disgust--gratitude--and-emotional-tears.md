RECORDED ON JANUARY 31st 2025.  
Dr. Debra Lieberman is Professor and has served as Associate Chair for Undergraduate Affairs and Research in the Department of Psychology at the University of Miami. Her research aims to understand how evolution has shaped the social mind and includes work on kinship, cooperation, sexuality, groups, morality, and emotions. She is the author of Objection: Disgust, Morality, and the Law.

In this episode, we talk about emotions from an evolutionary perspective. We discuss their functions, and the link between emotions and morality. We delve into disgust and its different types, social condemnation, how we go from emotions to social norms and law, and examples of laws based on disgust. We discuss the emotion of gratitude, and how it ties to cooperative relationships. Finally, we talk about the functions of emotional tears.
