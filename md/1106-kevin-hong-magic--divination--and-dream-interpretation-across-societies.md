RECORDED ON MARCH 26th 2025.  
Dr. Kevin Hong is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at The University of Macau. He is broadly interested in human behavior and culture, and currently has three lines of research: magic, divination, and epistemic norms in small-scale societies; reporting biases in the transmission of instrumental practices; and theoretical modeling of the transmission of culture. 

In this episode, we first talk about magic, divination and dream interpretation across human societies. We also discuss chance-based explanations. We talk about transmission biases in cultural evolution. Finally, we discuss taboos, and why there are so many of them in traditional societies.
