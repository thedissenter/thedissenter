RECORDED ON JANUARY 9th 2025.  
Dr. Todd May is Professor of Philosophy at Warren Wilson College. He is a political philosopher who writes on topics of anarchism, poststructuralism, and post-structuralist anarchism. He is the author of eighteen books of philosophy, most recently Should We Go Extinct?:  A Philosophical Dilemma for Our Unbearable Times.

In this episode, we focus on “Should We Go Extinct?”. We start by framing the debate between people who are in favor and against human extinction, and we talk about the different kinds of extinction, and arguments in favor and against human extinction. We also discuss the value that humanity brings to the world, as well as the harms. We talk about antinatalism, longtermism, and Dr. May’s own position.
