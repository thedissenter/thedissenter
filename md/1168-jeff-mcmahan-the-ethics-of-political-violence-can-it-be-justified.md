RECORDED ON OCTOBER 20th 2025.

He is editor of the Journal of Controversial Ideas. He’s the author of books like The Morality of Nationalism, The Ethics of Killing: Problems at the Margins of Life, and Killing in War.

In this episode, we talk about the ethics of political violence. We start by defining political violence. We then discuss when it is justified, and explore the specific case of political assassinations. We talk about Charlie Kirk’s assassination and its aftermath. Finally, we discuss whether people should be fired for their political opinions, and whether calling for political violence should be protected speech.
