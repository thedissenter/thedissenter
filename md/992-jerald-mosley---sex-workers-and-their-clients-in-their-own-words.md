Dr. Jerald Mosley is a former California Supervising Deputy Attorney General, and he has been researching, writing and speaking on law and sex work. He is the author of Sex Workers and Their Clients: In Their Own Words.

In this episode, we focus on Sex Workers and Their Clients. We start by discussing why it is important to consider the perspectives of sex workers and their clients, what a sex worker is, and the stigmatization of sex work. We then frame the debate between prohibitionists and some sex workers and sex-positive feminists, and explore claims surrounding the satisfaction and wellbeing of sex workers; whether sex work is a choice; sex trafficking; exploitation and empowerment; coercion and poverty; the prevalence of violence; objectification; and the claim that sex work is the product of patriarchy. We also talk about how sex workers describe their clients, and the role of sex-positive feminists who are not sex workers. We discuss common stereotypes about the clients, and the moralism of people who oppose sex work. Finally, we talk about approaches to sex work such as the “End Demand” approach, decriminalization, and how to prevent sex trafficking.
