RECORDED ON JANUARY 21st 2025.  
Dr. Kevin Lala is Professor of Behavioral and Evolutionary Biology at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He is one of the co-founders of niche construction theory and a prominent advocate of the extended evolutionary synthesis. His research encompasses a range of topics related to animal behavior and evolution; particularly animal social learning, innovation and intelligence; niche construction, inclusive inheritance, and the extended evolutionary synthesis; and human evolution, cultural evolution, and gene-culture coevolution. He is the author of several books including Evolution Evolving: The Developmental Origins of Adaptation and Biodiversity.

In this episode, we focus on Evolution Evolving. We start by talking about different types of explanations for the existence of traits. We discuss developmental biology, five principles of development, and how the evolutionary process itself evolves. We talk about developmental bias, plasticity-led evolution, nice construction, dynamic adaptive landscapes, and evolutionary innovation. We discuss the evolution of the human brain and cognition. Finally, we talk about the extended evolutionary synthesis.
