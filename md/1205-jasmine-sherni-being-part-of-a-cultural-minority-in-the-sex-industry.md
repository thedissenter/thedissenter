In this episode, we start by talking about how Jasmine got into porn. We discuss whether porn is for anyone, the fetishization of cultural minorities, and social stigma. We talk about assumptions people make about sex work and porn, sex education, whether sex work is a choice, whether it can be empowering, and hypocrisy coming from religious and conservative people. Finally, we talk about the role of sex.
