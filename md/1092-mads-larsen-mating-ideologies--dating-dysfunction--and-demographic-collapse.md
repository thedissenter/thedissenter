RECORDED ON MARCH 3rd 2025.  
Dr. Mads Larsen is a Postdoc and Researcher at the University of Oslo. He a is literary scholar who uses evolutionary perspectives to study cultural change. He is the author of Stories of Love from Vikings to Tinder: The Evolution of Modern Mating Ideologies, Dating Dysfunction, and Demographic Collapse.

In this episode, we focus on Stories of Love from Vikings to Tinder. We start by discussing the premise of the book, and talk about ideologies of love, human mating systems, the evolution of romantic love, and the methodology of literary analysis. We go through heroic love, the First Sexual Revolution, courtly love, the Second Sexual Revolution, libertine love, confluent love and the Third Sexual Revolution, and marriage patterns across history. We talk about issues with modern mating, namely singledom, sexual inactivity, and dropping fertility rates. We also talk about incels, insings, and the social consequences of high rates of bachelors. Finally, we discuss the potential Fourth Sexual Revolution, and solutions to modern mating problems.
