RECORDED ON JUNE 27th 2025.  
Dr. Nicole Prause is a neuroscientist researching human sexual behavior, addiction, and the physiology of sexual response. She is also the founder of Liberos LLC, an independent research institute.

In this episode, we first discuss whether pornography is a superstimulus, whether pornography changes sex scripts, the personality of porn users, and who the people who condemn porn the most are. We also discuss whether there is such a thing as dopamine addiction and dopamine detox. We talk about problematic porn use. We discuss NoFap groups and their claims, with a focus on semen retention. We talk about arousal and orgasm. We discuss whether women really have multiple orgasms. Finally, we talk about Dr. Prause’s early work on post-orgasmic syndrome.
