In this episode, we focus on Dr. Bot. We start by talking about medical error, whether doctors are essential, barriers in accessing medicine, and symptom denial. We discuss which are the better interviewers: doctors or computers. We talk about the limitations of doctors in diagnostics and treatment, and whether AI can do better. We discuss whether AI can be biased. Finally, we talk about the role that AI can play in medicine.
