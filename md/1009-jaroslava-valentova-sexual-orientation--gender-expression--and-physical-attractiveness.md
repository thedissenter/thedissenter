RECORDED ON MAY 3rd 2024.  
Dr. Jaroslava Valentova is a Professor Doctor at the Department of Experimental Psychology, Institute of Psychology, at the University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil. She has research experience in evolutionary psychology, anthropology and human ethology. Her primary research interest is human sexual orientation, and its proximate and ultimate causes. She further focuses on research of masculinity and femininity, differences between men and women in sexual strategies, sexual orientation attributions, mate preferences and mate choice and she has also been studying dynamics of long-term relationships, such as factors influencing relationship satisfaction, homogamy, complementarity, and jealousy.

In this episode, we first explore sexual orientation from an evolutionary perspective, and talk about the different sexual orientations, the evolution of homosexuality, and the link between sexual orientation and gender expression. We discuss sociosexuality, and facial sexual dimorphism. Finally, we talk about body modifications, and when and why people enhance their physical attractiveness.
