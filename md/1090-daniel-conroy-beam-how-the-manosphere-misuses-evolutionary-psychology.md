RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 28th 2025.  
Dr. Daniel Conroy-Beam is Associate Professor of Psychology in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). He uses an evolutionary perspective to understand how mate preferences are linked to actual mating outcomes. Specifically, he is interested in how mate preferences are integrated with one another computationally in order to make mating decisions.

In this episode, we talk about how the manosphere misuses evolutionary psychology research. We start by talking about what the manosphere is, and how they misappropriated Dr. Conroy-Beam's research. We discuss some mysoginist claims, why evolutionary psychology is so appealing to the manosphere, and evolutionary psychologists who align themselves with the manosphere. We talk about the motivations of people who have made a name for themselves in the manosphere, and how the manosphere also hurts the men who are attracted to it. Finally, we discuss what evolutionary psychologist should do to fight back against the misuse of their own research.
