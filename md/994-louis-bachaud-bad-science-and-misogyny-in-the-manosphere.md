RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 4th 2024.  
Louis Bachaud is a PhD student at the University of Kent and the University of Lille. His research investigates the history and sociology of science. In particular, he studies the contemporary (mis)understandings of evolutionary sciences and their appropriations in online debates around sex and gender.

In this episode, we talk about the misuse of evolutionary science in the manosphere. We start by discussing what the manosphere is. We then explore sets of claims about female sexuality, the ovulatory cycle, gender roles, and “alpha males”. We talk about the possible motives of people who produce content for the manosphere, as well as the consumers. We discuss why evolutionary psychology is so popular. Finally, we talk about some of the ways we can fight back against the misuse of evolutionary science in the manosphere.
