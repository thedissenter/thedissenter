RECORDED ON JANUARY 16th 2026.  
Patrick Foote is the creator of the YouTube channel Name Explain (@NameExplain), where he uncovers the origins of names and highlights many other aspects of language. He founded the channel in 2015 whilst working in retail, as a creative outlet and as a means to share his love of all things language. Since then, Name Explain has amassed hundreds of thousands of subscribers and millions of views. The channel’s success led Patrick to write his first book, The Origin of Names, Words and Everything in Between, in 2018. His latest book is Immigrant Tongues: Exploring How Languages Moved, Evolved, and Defined Us.

In this episode, we focus on Immigrant Tongues. We start by talking about how Patrick got interested in linguistics. We then discuss what a language is, and the ways languages migrate. We go through languages like Latin, the Bantu languages in Africa, English in Ireland, the colonization of the Americas, and languages in Antarctica and in space. We also talk about sign languages, how Mandarin is spreading across the globe, the concept of a “lingua franca”, and the future of language migration and evolution.
