00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:03.250
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.400
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs, and

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.670
today I'm joined by Doctor Shinobu Kitayama. He is

4
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.680
Robert B. Zayun, a collegiate professor of psychology and

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.680
director of the Culture and Cognition Program at the

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.479
University of Michigan. His research revolves around cultural differences

7
00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:26.000
and similarities in a variety of mental processes such

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.819
as self-emotion. And cognition. And today we're going to

9
00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:34.659
talk about topics like cultural neuroscience, cultural differences in

10
00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:40.099
psychological traits, the self, well-being, emotion norms, and other

11
00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:43.580
related topics. So, Doctor Kitayama, welcome to the show.

12
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.939
It's a pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:47.750
Oh, thank you very much for having me.

14
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.860
So what is cultural neuroscience?

15
00:00:54.119 --> 00:01:00.799
Well, uh, cultural neuroscience studies how cultural environment shape

16
00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.120
the brain and the cognition. It asks how history,

17
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.199
ecology, and social practices leave their mark on brain

18
00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:14.940
networks that support human cognition and behavior.

19
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.889
And in what ways does it relate to disciplines

20
00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:24.910
like cultural psychology and social neuroscience?

21
00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:32.110
Yeah, those are all related, obviously overlapping, but primarily

22
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.540
social psychology looks at social behavior, whereas cultural psychology

23
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.559
broadened that perspective by asking how history and ecology

24
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.529
shape behavior. Cultural neuroscience does the same for social

25
00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:53.650
neuroscience, showing how culture influences the neural processes behind

26
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.930
social behavior. It also deepens the cultural psychology by

27
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.209
uncovering the brain mechanisms behind cultural effects.

28
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.730
And what does it mean to say that the

29
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.970
functional organization of the human brain has a biosocial

30
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.509
nature?

31
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.509
Well, it means that the brain is built on

32
00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:23.610
an innate template, but also shaped by social experience.

33
00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:30.270
Through socialization, neural connections adapt so that the brain

34
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.199
becomes not just biological, but deeply social. So that's

35
00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:41.720
how the brain can become socio biosocial or socio-biological.

36
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.710
In your work, you explore how brain processes malleably

37
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.669
are malleably shaped by cultural tools and practices. So

38
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.529
how does that occur and could you give us

39
00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.210
some examples of it?

40
00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:04.410
Yeah, typical example we work on, uh, is reinforcement.

41
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.490
So behaviors are strengthened by positive feedback. The same

42
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.869
goes for brain networks. When the behavior is rewarded

43
00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:19.690
in a given cultural context, neural pathways supporting that

44
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.169
behavior grow stronger.

45
00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.669
Uh, YEAH, but, but, I mean, but in general,

46
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.490
I mean, how are brain processes shaped by cultural

47
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.229
tools and practices? I mean, in terms of how

48
00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:37.490
the brain operates, how does, oh yeah,

49
00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:41.110
so, so reinforcement is only one part of the

50
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.270
story. So once you get different cultural tools, you

51
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.809
know, those tools make use of different brain network

52
00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:56.520
or conversely, some tools. Essentially make it unnecessary to

53
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.860
have those networks. So for example, you know, uh,

54
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.600
navigation tools in, uh, in driving the cars, make

55
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.059
it uh unnecessary to use your own brain's hippocampus

56
00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:16.339
in navigating yourself, but before this invention, cultural tool,

57
00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.339
Uh, people, people needed to make use of their

58
00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.380
brain, some particular part of the brain and brain

59
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.500
network to navigate themselves in a very complicated city

60
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.179
like London.

61
00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:34.779
Mhm. So, but I asked you about cultural practices,

62
00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:38.720
but what is culture exactly? What counts as being

63
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.600
cultural?

64
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.040
Well, uh, culture in my mind is made up

65
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.440
of two things, one, practices, and two, meanings. Practices

66
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.109
are scripted daily behavior. Meanings are values, norms, and

67
00:04:58.109 --> 00:05:04.459
concepts that guide those behaviors, namely practices. For example,

68
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.040
Americans often say, when we meet each other, how

69
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.220
are you? And answer could be fine, thank you.

70
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.440
Now, this seems like such a trivial example, but

71
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.000
really reflects some very interesting possibility that American culture

72
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.059
offered the shared idea that the self's internal state

73
00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:32.489
is important, and also it is desirable to be

74
00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:32.880
fine.

75
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.320
OK. And with that in mind, how do we

76
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.880
go about integrating the mind, the brain, and culture?

77
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.709
Well, mind emerges from the brain and the brain

78
00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:53.190
is shaped by cultural practices and the meanings. So

79
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.790
culture, brain and mind form a group of mutual

80
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.470
influences.

81
00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:03.000
Uh, AND I mean, uh, uh, we're going to

82
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.799
get into some cultural differences in psychological traits, but

83
00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:10.220
how are these cultural differences studied?

84
00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:20.450
Well, interesting question. Uh, TRADITIONALLY, anthropologists use ethnography. Sociologists

85
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:26.609
have used surveys, and psychologists have used experiments. In

86
00:06:26.609 --> 00:06:31.850
cultural neuroscience, we add brain imaging and the physiological

87
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:38.450
method, brain imaging, including fMRI and EEG and physiological

88
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:44.279
measurement like uh measuring some You know, uh, enzymes

89
00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.540
and so on in the blood flow. And uh,

90
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.739
I believe that multiple methods and approaches are important,

91
00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:56.480
and we need to ensure that those things converge

92
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.160
and if not, investigating why.

93
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.209
Mhm But I mean, when it comes to cultural

94
00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:07.179
differences, if you were to ask people who, for

95
00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:13.500
example, study human universals or even, let's say evolutionary

96
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.540
psychologists, they would talk about uh some information processing

97
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.910
mechanisms that they would say are Universal or cross-culturally

98
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.350
found in the human species across human societies. I

99
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.109
mean, do you think that all of human psychology,

100
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:36.230
all of our psychological processes or mechanisms can be

101
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.190
shaped by culture, or are perhaps some of them

102
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.109
impermeable to culture?

103
00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:51.420
Well, uh, culture works on biological templates. No question

104
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:58.640
about this, and those templates are also prepared evolutionarily

105
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.660
with the assumption that they are going to be

106
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.700
shaped by culture. So biology and culture kind of

107
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.220
make each other up over a long span of

108
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:18.429
evolution now. Traditionally, some people argue that different cultures

109
00:08:18.429 --> 00:08:24.390
are incomparably, incomparably different, you know, simply comparison is

110
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:28.190
difficult because cultures are so different. I don't believe

111
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.549
it, but at the same time, it is not

112
00:08:31.549 --> 00:08:34.989
quite right to say that some elements are the

113
00:08:34.989 --> 00:08:39.770
same, when all the other elements are different because

114
00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:44.869
all the elements are integrated to form a network

115
00:08:44.869 --> 00:08:50.789
or system. So, I would say what is universal

116
00:08:51.049 --> 00:08:55.090
is the process of formation of human mind or

117
00:08:55.090 --> 00:09:00.630
formation of social brain, and resulting outcome out of

118
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:06.450
this universal process can be extreme diversity across societies,

119
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.349
across socializations, and across cultural groups.

120
00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:14.719
OK. So I would like to get now into

121
00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:18.760
the example of the self and how it can

122
00:09:19.099 --> 00:09:23.599
vary in different ways across human culture. So, first

123
00:09:23.599 --> 00:09:25.580
of all, what is the self?

124
00:09:27.909 --> 00:09:33.630
Well, interesting question. I would say self is the

125
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:39.229
source of behavior, source of initiating action, and which

126
00:09:39.229 --> 00:09:43.690
could be called agency. The perception of agency itself

127
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:49.609
becomes part of who we are. So, I'm paraphrasing

128
00:09:49.609 --> 00:09:54.630
traditional distinction by, say, William James between I and

129
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.369
me. So I refers to a whole bunch of

130
00:09:58.369 --> 00:10:04.400
psychological processes that make action possible. There's a dynamic

131
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.809
system producing action that is the self, but the

132
00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:10.989
self itself is perceived by the self, and this

133
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.530
self as perceived is integrated into this source of

134
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:15.010
action.

135
00:10:17.059 --> 00:10:21.979
When does the self or notions of self vary

136
00:10:21.979 --> 00:10:25.700
cross-culturally and what does it mean for it to

137
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.299
vary cross-culturally? In what ways does it vary?

138
00:10:30.419 --> 00:10:34.359
Well, we have argued that the Western cultures emphasize

139
00:10:34.359 --> 00:10:39.780
independence of the self, while many non-Western cultures emphasize

140
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.979
interdependence of the self with the other people. But

141
00:10:43.979 --> 00:10:49.340
interdependence itself takes different forms across cultures outside of

142
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.940
the West, which is really exciting agenda uh in

143
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.359
our recent research.

144
00:10:56.669 --> 00:11:01.049
In what ways is the self grounded socially?

145
00:11:02.859 --> 00:11:09.520
Well, through social feedback, I would say George Meade,

146
00:11:09.619 --> 00:11:15.440
uh, once called the generalized other. So basically, you

147
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.400
know, here's a community of people who share the

148
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.679
common sense about what the self is supposed to

149
00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:26.719
be, and this generates other is internalized and become

150
00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:31.760
the voice of the society that becomes really internalized

151
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.960
part of our mind, and that's how the self

152
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.280
is socially grounded.

153
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.880
What is self-relevant information and where do we get

154
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.500
it from?

155
00:11:46.219 --> 00:11:50.260
So are you asking cultural differences in the processing

156
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.520
of self-relevant information, right?

157
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:57.640
Uh, YES, I was first asking what is self-relevant

158
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.390
information. What, what does that mean?

159
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.020
Oh, I see, I see. Uh, YOU know, basically

160
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.539
there are so many things in the world, and

161
00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:10.820
depending on who you are, what your backgrounds might

162
00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:16.020
be, some part of social environment is more. RELATED

163
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:21.200
to associated with your sense of yourself, while some

164
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.640
other things are not. So for example, if you

165
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.640
are, well, you are a journalist, and if you're

166
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.640
a journalist and committed to good science, doing very

167
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.400
good job in the interview like this could be

168
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.760
highly, highly self-relevant, while something else like eating hamburger

169
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.000
as opposed to something else for dinner might be

170
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.159
much less relevant.

171
00:12:46.049 --> 00:12:50.359
And when it comes to self-relevant information, there is

172
00:12:50.359 --> 00:12:56.719
positive and negative self-relevant information. Are there cross-cultural differences

173
00:12:56.719 --> 00:13:03.179
in how people readily accept positive or negative self-relevant

174
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.080
information?

175
00:13:04.989 --> 00:13:10.979
Yes, uh, typically, European-Americans tend to focus more and

176
00:13:10.979 --> 00:13:18.340
elaborate more on positive self-information, where, whereas East Asians

177
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:22.020
do not show the same positivity bias.

178
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:28.940
And where, I mean, how do, where does this

179
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.549
difference come from? I mean, is it something that

180
00:13:32.549 --> 00:13:37.390
people acquire socially, the fact that they, uh, pay

181
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.989
more attention or accept more readily positive or negative

182
00:13:40.989 --> 00:13:44.510
self-relevant information? I mean, how, how does that happen?

183
00:13:45.299 --> 00:13:50.049
Well, we have argued that European-American culture share the

184
00:13:50.049 --> 00:13:55.219
assumption that the self is an independent entity that

185
00:13:55.219 --> 00:13:59.570
is positive. Positivity is the anchor of the self,

186
00:13:59.979 --> 00:14:06.020
while in East Asian culture, social relationships, social embeddedness

187
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.419
is far more important, and the positivity of the

188
00:14:09.419 --> 00:14:14.650
self itself may or may not be highly relevant.

189
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:19.880
And this can become part of you, and this

190
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.760
can surely be part of general society and therefore,

191
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.650
in that way, cultural assumptions about the role of

192
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.849
positivity of the self can shape the posit, the

193
00:14:32.849 --> 00:14:35.770
positivity of the self, uh, in, in, in any

194
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:36.630
given individual.

195
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.059
Mhm, I understand. And in what ways do construals

196
00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:46.580
of the self, of others, and of the interdependence

197
00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:51.580
of the two can influence the nature of individual

198
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.940
experience and things like cognition and emotion.

199
00:14:55.630 --> 00:15:01.270
Yeah, so you can conceptualize self-control as a mental

200
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.349
map, mental map that you utilize in navigating your

201
00:15:05.349 --> 00:15:09.150
own behavior. Also, you can use the same mental

202
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:15.219
map in Understanding and comprehending other people's behavior and

203
00:15:15.219 --> 00:15:19.020
mental map can be used to say reward or

204
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.299
punish and comment on others' behavior, and in that

205
00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:28.380
way, you know, self-construe can shape the social behaviors,

206
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:34.530
one through your self-guidance and, and second, by guidance

207
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.419
by other people.

208
00:15:37.349 --> 00:15:40.150
So in this sense, and still on the topic

209
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:45.030
of the self, how do individualist cultures differ from

210
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.590
collectivist cultures?

211
00:15:48.229 --> 00:15:51.630
Well, I would say, well, first of all, individualists

212
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:58.909
and the collectivists have different mental maps. Individualistic mental

213
00:15:58.909 --> 00:16:04.229
map is based on independent self, whereas collectivistic mental

214
00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:07.510
set or mental map is based on the assumption

215
00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:11.239
that the self is more interdependent. But above and

216
00:16:11.239 --> 00:16:17.409
beyond, it's possible that even though both personal goal

217
00:16:17.549 --> 00:16:22.570
and social guidance are involved, personal goal aspects may

218
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:27.710
be more relevant and more highlighted in individualistic societies

219
00:16:27.909 --> 00:16:32.070
where social guidance aspects may be more important, more

220
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.650
salient in collectivistic society.

221
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.330
So when it comes to construals of the self

222
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:45.679
as independent or interdependent, how are, how are these

223
00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:48.770
construals? How do they come about? I mean, how

224
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.950
are they constructed in a way?

225
00:16:53.130 --> 00:17:02.510
Excellent question. We have argued that behind self-construls you

226
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:08.750
identify today, there's deep history, ecology, geography, and so

227
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:14.368
on. So, different parts of the world are characterized

228
00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:19.729
by very different ecologies, which necessitate very different forms

229
00:17:19.729 --> 00:17:24.170
of subsistence, which in turn lend themselves to very

230
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:30.920
different social systems, out of which Culturally specific construals

231
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.310
of the self must have emerged.

232
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.959
Talking about well-being, but still on the topic of

233
00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:43.760
self, is well-being associated with the kind of control

234
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.439
of the self as independent or interdependent that people

235
00:17:48.439 --> 00:17:48.859
have?

236
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.119
Yes, uh, generally, uh, when you draw comparisons between

237
00:17:57.119 --> 00:18:03.760
Western societies and East Asian societies, independent selves find

238
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.719
the well-being in personal achievement, especially in Western societies,

239
00:18:09.079 --> 00:18:14.640
whereas interdependent selves in East Asia find well-being in

240
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.939
social harmony, social connection, and social embeddedness.

241
00:18:20.719 --> 00:18:24.079
And when it comes to how people approach well-being,

242
00:18:24.239 --> 00:18:29.319
there are linear approaches and dialectic approaches. Could you

243
00:18:29.319 --> 00:18:32.599
explain each of those approaches and how they vary

244
00:18:32.599 --> 00:18:33.560
cross-culturally?

245
00:18:34.599 --> 00:18:38.079
Yeah, that, that really points to something I've, I've

246
00:18:38.079 --> 00:18:42.479
been very interested these days, you know, time can

247
00:18:42.479 --> 00:18:46.910
run like an arrow, time can have one direction,

248
00:18:47.199 --> 00:18:53.540
alternatively, time can circle around, you know, seasons are

249
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:58.319
the example of the second form of time. Now,

250
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.660
everybody has those two forms of time, obviously, however,

251
00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.180
different cultures utilize one or the other more to

252
00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:13.859
conceptualize the nature of well-being. So American societies or

253
00:19:13.859 --> 00:19:19.459
American culture tends to use linear forms of understanding

254
00:19:19.459 --> 00:19:23.260
of time in conceptualizing well-being. So if you are

255
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.839
happy today, you are You imagine that you are

256
00:19:26.839 --> 00:19:30.400
going to be happier tomorrow, and society grows like

257
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.199
this, and of course, a tragic aspect of this

258
00:19:34.199 --> 00:19:37.040
is just the opposite, if you are unhappy today,

259
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.800
your well-being may continue to decline in the future.

260
00:19:41.459 --> 00:19:47.219
East Asians traditionally have cultivated very different forms of

261
00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:52.829
understanding of the relationship between time and well-being, and

262
00:19:52.829 --> 00:19:56.660
which is much more dialectic, seasonal, in the sense

263
00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.530
that excessive positive could be the beginning of having

264
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:04.300
negative, but having a negative state today could be

265
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:09.530
a beginning of getting something positive tomorrow. So essentially

266
00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:14.890
well-being is conceptualized as circular and more cyclic and

267
00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.030
more dialectic.

268
00:20:17.479 --> 00:20:22.400
You have also done work on how emotional experiences

269
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.699
change across the lifespan, and you've done work among

270
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.939
Americans and also among Japanese people. So how do

271
00:20:29.939 --> 00:20:33.719
they change across the lifespan among Americans and how

272
00:20:33.719 --> 00:20:37.439
does it compare to how they change in Japanese

273
00:20:37.439 --> 00:20:37.920
people?

274
00:20:39.609 --> 00:20:46.250
Well, one very robust effect, developmental psychologists have documented

275
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.729
in the United States and the Western societies is

276
00:20:49.729 --> 00:20:54.699
that older people become more positive. You know, they

277
00:20:54.699 --> 00:21:00.819
experience greater happiness and greater positivity, and in part

278
00:21:00.819 --> 00:21:05.339
because they don't have to worry about any negative

279
00:21:05.339 --> 00:21:09.260
consequences in their life in the future because their

280
00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:15.250
future is getting smaller, getting narrower, and getting Less

281
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:20.729
realistic, so to speak. Interestingly, East Asians don't show

282
00:21:20.729 --> 00:21:24.489
this effect as much. This positivity effect as a

283
00:21:24.489 --> 00:21:28.089
function of age is much less robust in East

284
00:21:28.089 --> 00:21:33.170
Asia, and sometimes East Asian older people show kind

285
00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:37.729
of growth of meaningfulness of the self. So for

286
00:21:37.729 --> 00:21:42.770
example, your understanding of the self as being, you

287
00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:48.780
know, You know, as a resource for next generation,

288
00:21:49.199 --> 00:21:53.680
meaning in life and you know, uh something that

289
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.719
makes your life worth living, those aspects of meaning

290
00:21:57.719 --> 00:22:02.160
aspects of well-being appears to grow in East Asia,

291
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.079
whereas those aspects go down in Western societies.

292
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.180
And do we have any explanation for that?

293
00:22:12.939 --> 00:22:18.619
Well, we, it's very hard to pin down exactly

294
00:22:18.619 --> 00:22:21.719
why that might be the case, but we suspect

295
00:22:21.939 --> 00:22:27.729
that this may also be related to typical self-construe

296
00:22:27.729 --> 00:22:33.099
as independent or interdependent. So in Western societies, yourself

297
00:22:33.099 --> 00:22:38.619
is atomic entity that is independent, not constrained by

298
00:22:38.619 --> 00:22:42.890
the society. Now that's fine, and that can be

299
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.969
very positive if you don't have to worry about

300
00:22:45.969 --> 00:22:49.209
other things, as may be true in later in

301
00:22:49.209 --> 00:22:53.089
life, but as they grow, people may find less

302
00:22:53.089 --> 00:22:58.189
meaning because it's so isolated from the surrounding. Whereas

303
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:02.890
in East Asia, self is perceived as embedded in

304
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:07.224
much broader con uh context, context not. Not, not

305
00:23:07.224 --> 00:23:12.704
just not just confined to your lifetime, but generation

306
00:23:12.704 --> 00:23:16.185
of people who may come after you. And as

307
00:23:16.185 --> 00:23:20.025
a consequence, people may have a better way to

308
00:23:20.025 --> 00:23:25.224
handling, to handle, you know, your older age, you

309
00:23:25.224 --> 00:23:29.464
become more embedded, more meaningful, but there's much less

310
00:23:29.464 --> 00:23:34.849
need to be hedonically positive. Mhm.

311
00:23:35.469 --> 00:23:37.910
What are emotion norms?

312
00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:45.689
Well, emotional, emotion norm is a societal expectations about

313
00:23:45.689 --> 00:23:51.760
which emotions are desirable to feel and express. So

314
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.569
for example, initial study focused on flight attendant in

315
00:23:56.569 --> 00:24:01.420
1960s, you know, whether you feel good or bad,

316
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.239
but it's your job and you are supposed to

317
00:24:04.239 --> 00:24:08.729
feel some emotions more than some others to serve

318
00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.959
the job, and this can apply to many other

319
00:24:11.959 --> 00:24:13.739
occupations and settings.

320
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:19.109
But then, do we have emotion norms in all

321
00:24:19.109 --> 00:24:20.910
human societies, is that it?

322
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.040
Oh yeah, yes, I, I, I believe so, I

323
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.150
believe so, and emotional norms can play a very

324
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.420
important role in shaping your emotions themselves.

325
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.030
In what ways?

326
00:24:35.989 --> 00:24:42.069
Again, two ways. One, self-guidance, you may have some

327
00:24:42.069 --> 00:24:45.209
understanding of the social norm, and you may try

328
00:24:45.209 --> 00:24:49.989
to feel those emotions which are considered desirable, but

329
00:24:49.989 --> 00:24:54.175
at the same time, Social guidance is important. So

330
00:24:54.175 --> 00:24:58.135
for example, we share some culture, and we understand

331
00:24:58.135 --> 00:25:01.895
some emotions are important. Now imagine that you experience

332
00:25:01.895 --> 00:25:04.974
that express that emotion and the thing that you

333
00:25:04.974 --> 00:25:08.584
are feeling in, and then I say, oh Ricard,

334
00:25:09.324 --> 00:25:12.574
you know, you are feeling that way, I completely

335
00:25:12.574 --> 00:25:15.015
understand blah blah blah. So in that way, social

336
00:25:15.015 --> 00:25:18.375
guidance may set in to shape your emotion.

337
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.800
Uh, AND I mean, emo do emotion norms vary

338
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.760
between individualist cultures and collectivist cultures, and are there

339
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.239
also differences in terms of how much people adhere

340
00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:34.199
to emotion norms or not?

341
00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:39.349
Yes, uh, actually, that's one of the topics we

342
00:25:39.349 --> 00:25:43.869
have investigated in the recent years. What, what we

343
00:25:43.869 --> 00:25:48.910
found was very interesting, essentially, what we found was

344
00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:56.150
that emotional norms are stronger in Western. Individualistic societies

345
00:25:56.369 --> 00:26:01.689
compares to non-Western more collectivistic societies. By the way,

346
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:05.369
we found that very interesting, and many people found

347
00:26:05.369 --> 00:26:11.530
it counterintuitive because typically, norms are stronger in collectivistic

348
00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:16.770
societies. So here, emotional norms just going the opposite

349
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:21.810
way. So, uh, we, we found this extremely interesting

350
00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:22.810
and informative.

351
00:26:24.099 --> 00:26:27.819
Uh, AND what explains that? Do we know that?

352
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.979
What explains the

353
00:26:28.979 --> 00:26:30.010
fact that the norm,

354
00:26:30.699 --> 00:26:30.939
yeah.

355
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:40.290
Yes, again, self-construal, so independent self-construal highlight internal aspects

356
00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:43.729
of the self. Those are believed to be very

357
00:26:43.729 --> 00:26:48.569
important. One aspect of internal experience is emotion, your

358
00:26:48.569 --> 00:26:53.739
passion. And your passion is what defines you, given

359
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.439
this independent self-construe, and as a consequence, so for

360
00:26:58.439 --> 00:27:02.560
example, if you show your emotions in such a

361
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.239
way that you don't know what you are feeling.

362
00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:10.569
My feedback, it would be very lukewarm, and your

363
00:27:10.569 --> 00:27:14.170
response may not be reinforced. But if you, if

364
00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:19.170
you say, I'm happy, I'm very excited, or when

365
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.130
you are not happy, you may say, I'm entirely

366
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:26.589
angry. Well, my response would be, yeah, I completely

367
00:27:26.589 --> 00:27:29.829
understand what's going on, explain, and that's a kind

368
00:27:29.829 --> 00:27:34.189
of social feedback you might expect in individualistic society.

369
00:27:34.589 --> 00:27:41.459
Now, in collectivistic society, Excuse me. Both joy and

370
00:27:41.459 --> 00:27:45.739
anger, those concepts exist, no question about that. However,

371
00:27:46.439 --> 00:27:50.949
much more important is social rules, social norms, uh,

372
00:27:50.959 --> 00:27:56.119
norms regarding social behavior. So people tend to disregard

373
00:27:56.869 --> 00:28:01.839
emotional expression, emotional, you know, information leaking out somebody's

374
00:28:01.839 --> 00:28:07.030
behavior, and as a consequence, emotional norms. TEND to

375
00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:11.650
be stronger as a consequence in individualistic societies.

376
00:28:12.839 --> 00:28:16.900
I understand. Uh, IN your work, you also explore,

377
00:28:17.079 --> 00:28:20.599
uh, how ecology also plays a role in how

378
00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:23.959
cognition evolves. So, could you tell us about the

379
00:28:23.959 --> 00:28:27.760
example of farmers and fishermen and how they are

380
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.819
more holistic than herders?

381
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.859
Yeah, so, Well, in terms of cognition, we found

382
00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:41.079
that farmers are more holistic compared to herders. That's

383
00:28:41.079 --> 00:28:46.020
interesting, and we believe that this difference happens because

384
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:51.959
farming requires much greater social coordination and social cooperation,

385
00:28:52.219 --> 00:28:57.859
which require people to have expanded range of attention

386
00:28:57.859 --> 00:29:02.660
to different parts of the social world, eventually leading

387
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:07.020
to more holistic habit of the mind compared to

388
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.194
people. For engaging in hunting, which require more focused

389
00:29:11.194 --> 00:29:16.064
attention to any given animal or to whatever you

390
00:29:16.064 --> 00:29:20.035
have to do because typically you act alone, you

391
00:29:20.035 --> 00:29:24.755
walk alone compared to farming, which requires much greater

392
00:29:24.755 --> 00:29:29.265
extent of social coordination, at least historically, you know,

393
00:29:29.354 --> 00:29:33.364
we are talking about several 1000 years of cultural

394
00:29:33.364 --> 00:29:34.354
evolution here.

395
00:29:35.349 --> 00:29:38.790
Uh, COULD you explain uh what holistic means in

396
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.770
this kind of context? I mean, what does it

397
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.729
entail in terms of how people think?

398
00:29:46.599 --> 00:29:51.359
Yeah, so holistic attention, we simply mean the spatial

399
00:29:51.359 --> 00:29:58.680
allocation of psychological resource. Sometimes we allocate resource broadly

400
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.380
to different elements in the environment. So for example,

401
00:30:01.569 --> 00:30:04.689
For example, imagine that you went into a dark

402
00:30:04.689 --> 00:30:07.939
forest and you don't know what may show up,

403
00:30:08.189 --> 00:30:14.290
your attention becomes very, very holistic, broad, just to

404
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:18.489
ensure that you will not miss anything. Whereas your

405
00:30:18.489 --> 00:30:21.369
attention could be more focused when you're working on

406
00:30:21.369 --> 00:30:25.810
some task, you know, 100% concentrating on it. Attention

407
00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:30.530
is very focused. Now, attention is the gateway of

408
00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:35.040
information. So when you are focusing on something and

409
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:40.140
filtering out all the other information, down downstream consequence

410
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.680
of this is that your cognition become more focused

411
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:50.680
too, because you fail to even Get Contextual information

412
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.520
in the beginning. But if your attention is more

413
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.000
holistic, lots of information comes in and your attention

414
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.479
tend to be holistic, but your cognition needs to

415
00:31:01.479 --> 00:31:07.069
be more holistic. Sometimes cognition can become More diffused

416
00:31:07.069 --> 00:31:11.989
or more ambiguous, but more positive take on this

417
00:31:12.109 --> 00:31:15.989
is that cognition becomes more holistic and more wise

418
00:31:16.349 --> 00:31:20.780
because you are predisposed to take into account a

419
00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.910
broader range of information.

420
00:31:23.939 --> 00:31:26.949
And what would be the opposite of holistic? Is

421
00:31:26.949 --> 00:31:28.150
it analytic?

422
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:37.849
Well, analytic thought typically involves identifying some piece of

423
00:31:37.849 --> 00:31:43.699
information. For example, oh here's a bird, OK. All

424
00:31:43.699 --> 00:31:47.050
right, so what does this mean? Well, this means

425
00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:51.670
that typically birds fly, and therefore this bird should

426
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:55.300
also fly. So what this means that you focus

427
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.530
your attention on a single piece of information, and

428
00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:04.079
then apply some reasoning rules. So cognition based on

429
00:32:04.219 --> 00:32:08.939
focused attention tends to be more analytic, whereas your

430
00:32:08.939 --> 00:32:13.709
cognition, if based on more holistic information, You know,

431
00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:17.670
your reasoning tend to be less analytic, that doesn't

432
00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:23.910
mean necessarily that your cognition is worse or irrational,

433
00:32:24.219 --> 00:32:28.869
simply cognition become more holistic, meaning that you tend

434
00:32:28.869 --> 00:32:32.510
to take into account various contextual information.

435
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.819
So I asked you about the example of farmers

436
00:32:36.819 --> 00:32:41.500
and herders. How about the example of harvesting rice

437
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:45.010
versus wheat in China? I mean, what are the

438
00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:48.699
differences in terms of what between people who harvest

439
00:32:48.699 --> 00:32:52.660
rice and people who harvest wheat in China?

440
00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:58.339
Yeah, well, it's, there's a very clear difference in

441
00:32:58.339 --> 00:33:03.140
farming uh rice as opposed to wheat, not necessarily

442
00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.319
today, but we are talking about several 1000 years

443
00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:12.140
of cultural evolution. So in traditionally rice farming regions,

444
00:33:12.439 --> 00:33:16.310
people still tend to be more collectivistic in believing

445
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:20.670
in interdependent self, and their cognition tends to be

446
00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:25.229
more holistic compared to people living in traditionally wheat

447
00:33:25.229 --> 00:33:28.670
farming region. Now, you might ask why that might

448
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:33.760
be the case, and we believe That's because farming,

449
00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:39.660
farming is farming, however, rice farming requires much greater

450
00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:44.369
degree of social coordination and also rice farming affords

451
00:33:44.369 --> 00:33:49.530
much greater calorie per square meter, lending itself to

452
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:54.819
greater population. DENSITY, greater population density lending itself to

453
00:33:54.819 --> 00:33:58.449
greater social coordination. So there's a cyclic process of

454
00:33:58.449 --> 00:34:04.790
reinforcements to create more tight and collectivistic social practices

455
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:08.780
in the region, which can be passed on across

456
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:08.800
generations.

457
00:34:10.549 --> 00:34:15.029
So when I asked you about differences between individualist

458
00:34:15.029 --> 00:34:21.349
and collectivist societies, sometimes you pointed to Western Europe

459
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:24.868
versus East Asia. What would you say are some

460
00:34:24.868 --> 00:34:29.888
of the main differences or more salient differences between

461
00:34:30.579 --> 00:34:34.888
incognition between Westerners and East Asians?

462
00:34:36.379 --> 00:34:40.389
Well, in terms of cognition, we already talked about

463
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:45.820
holistic analytic distinction. This shows up in several different

464
00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:51.418
ways. So for example, in causal attribution, well, what

465
00:34:51.418 --> 00:34:56.250
that means is that social explanation of somebody's behavior.

466
00:34:56.978 --> 00:35:02.260
Western Europeans and North Americans tends to exhibit what

467
00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:08.709
we call fundamental attribution error. Meaning that they attribute

468
00:35:09.209 --> 00:35:13.449
behavior to the internal traits of the person, even

469
00:35:13.449 --> 00:35:19.050
when there's obvious social factors influencing the behavior. So

470
00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.560
for example, if somebody is giving a seat to

471
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.810
somebody, maybe older person in a, in a crowded

472
00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:29.050
train, you may jump on the conclusion that he

473
00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:34.149
must be very kind, nice guy. Forgetting the possibility

474
00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.469
that there's a very strong social norm of doing

475
00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:40.550
this in a similar situation, so that's called the

476
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:44.689
fundamental attribution error. This fundamental attribution error is much

477
00:35:44.689 --> 00:35:48.290
less weak and sometimes do not show up in

478
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:49.090
East Asia.

479
00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:54.889
Uh, ARE there any other major differences in cognition

480
00:35:54.889 --> 00:35:57.429
between Westerners and East Asians?

481
00:35:58.209 --> 00:36:03.129
Yeah, another example would be to what extent people

482
00:36:03.129 --> 00:36:09.510
regard. Different sorts of information relevant in making judgment.

483
00:36:09.969 --> 00:36:16.530
So Westerners tends to screen out many pieces of

484
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:21.209
information simply irrelevant, focusing on something that's clearly irrelevant.

485
00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:26.870
East Asians tend to admit much broader range of

486
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:30.800
information in making judgment, and this can have very

487
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.679
significant influences and implications in, for example, judgment of

488
00:36:35.679 --> 00:36:41.419
morality, judgment of crime, judgment of, you know, criminality,

489
00:36:41.959 --> 00:36:42.879
uh, and so on.

490
00:36:44.939 --> 00:36:47.500
And uh I mean, and this will be the

491
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:51.070
last topic I would like to explore. Where does

492
00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:54.939
the, uh, do these differences come from? What explains

493
00:36:54.939 --> 00:36:59.000
these differences between Westerners and East Asians in terms

494
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.419
of cognition?

495
00:37:02.409 --> 00:37:09.889
So we believe that to understand this contemporary psychological

496
00:37:09.889 --> 00:37:14.219
differences, you have to go back at least several

497
00:37:14.219 --> 00:37:23.189
1000 years. Why? Because, you know, humans essentially settled

498
00:37:23.189 --> 00:37:29.949
and studying sedentary forms of living. You know, 10,000

499
00:37:29.949 --> 00:37:34.810
years ago, different parts of the Eurasian continent, and

500
00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:39.389
because farming became possible and herding became part of

501
00:37:39.389 --> 00:37:42.909
social life, which enabled people to settle in a

502
00:37:42.909 --> 00:37:48.669
given place. Once this happens, you know, ecology, geography,

503
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:57.340
those broad You know, sociological or geographic variables can

504
00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:01.080
influence forms of life. So I already told you,

505
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.330
once rice crop is discovered in some part of

506
00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:10.199
the East Asia, that really transformed the society, and

507
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:15.020
that society may now be called more collectivistic compares

508
00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.500
to form of society encouraged by, say, you know,

509
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:24.590
wheat farming or You know, uh, Harding, which you

510
00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:27.689
may now call more individualistic.

511
00:38:29.169 --> 00:38:31.409
Uh, IN your work, you talk about the social

512
00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:37.600
orientation hypothesis. Does that apply to explaining these differences?

513
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:45.659
Well, basically, social social orientation hypothesis simply is that

514
00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:52.260
your cognition may reflect your social behavioral patterns. So

515
00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.620
your social behavior tend to be independent, your cognition

516
00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:00.100
tend to be more analytic, your behavior is more

517
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.780
holistic, more interdependent, your cognition tends to be more

518
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:08.979
holistic. I think that's right. Within the confine of

519
00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:13.489
Western societies and the East Asian societies. Now, we

520
00:39:13.489 --> 00:39:17.260
are finding that the story may have to be

521
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:22.340
more nuanced if you expand your research beyond East

522
00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:27.050
and the West. So for example, in South Asia,

523
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.379
people are very, very collectivistic, and yet their thinking

524
00:39:31.379 --> 00:39:36.290
tend to be very analytic. Now, it posing a

525
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:39.719
very interesting question about why that might be the

526
00:39:39.719 --> 00:39:40.139
case.

527
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:45.110
Oh, OK. So if we look across all the

528
00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:49.149
other cultures, would you expect to find, uh, I

529
00:39:49.149 --> 00:39:53.659
mean, perhaps different sets of these kinds of, uh,

530
00:39:53.669 --> 00:39:55.550
cognitive differences occurring?

531
00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:02.540
Oh, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. Well, generally, I think it's

532
00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:08.080
right. Still, I. Go along with what we said,

533
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.800
that is interdependence tends to be, tends to foster

534
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.909
more holistic cognition. However, there are some important exceptions,

535
00:40:18.159 --> 00:40:22.080
and South Asia is one clear example and in

536
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:27.510
our recent research suggesting that there might be some

537
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.100
interesting exceptions in the Middle East too. So, uh,

538
00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:34.979
you know, we'll see how things go, uh, you

539
00:40:34.979 --> 00:40:40.699
know, in our field, our research effort was confined

540
00:40:40.699 --> 00:40:43.820
to East and the West, meaning that most of

541
00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:49.409
the East Asia and the Western societies for Some

542
00:40:49.409 --> 00:40:52.989
obvious reasons which have nothing to do with the

543
00:40:52.989 --> 00:40:57.030
substance of psychological theories, that is where you, you

544
00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:00.750
have data, where research can be done, all those

545
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:04.129
things. And now I think time is very ripe

546
00:41:04.389 --> 00:41:08.590
to go beyond East and West, incorporating information from

547
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:12.270
the Middle East, India, South, you know, South Asia,

548
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:16.350
uh, Sub-Saharan Africa, and so on, and that's exactly

549
00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:17.649
what we have tried to do.

550
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.300
And do you already have any hypothesis as to

551
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:26.360
why in, for example, in South Asia, as you

552
00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:30.800
say, people tend to be collectivist, but at the

553
00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.679
same time they are analytic. I mean, what would

554
00:41:33.679 --> 00:41:34.469
explain these

555
00:41:34.469 --> 00:41:41.540
exceptions? Well, uh, I would say that Well, first

556
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.620
of all, uh, I think we need to share

557
00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:49.649
some common understanding about the timeline of cultural evolution.

558
00:41:50.219 --> 00:41:55.959
So most non-Western regions evolved over several 1000 years.

559
00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:02.179
Western societies emerged in the last 1000 years. It

560
00:42:02.179 --> 00:42:07.110
evolved over the last several 100 years, right now.

561
00:42:08.479 --> 00:42:13.000
Non-Western societies, they tend to be more interdependent and

562
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.879
the collectivistic because in previous time prior to industrial

563
00:42:18.879 --> 00:42:22.800
revolution and all the wealth and all the efficiencies

564
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.989
that afford Living was hard, and you have to

565
00:42:27.989 --> 00:42:30.909
conform with the group, you have to survive by

566
00:42:30.909 --> 00:42:35.669
using group dynamics. So societies tend to be more

567
00:42:35.669 --> 00:42:44.030
collectivistic. Now, depending on geography, ecology, and potentially other

568
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:51.129
factors like migration. People or these different cultures came

569
00:42:51.129 --> 00:42:55.770
up with very different ways of forming groups, forming

570
00:42:55.770 --> 00:43:01.739
societies, forming communities to survive. East Asian way is

571
00:43:01.739 --> 00:43:05.969
one way, but not really even the dominant way.

572
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:11.179
So for example, South Asia is the hub of

573
00:43:11.179 --> 00:43:14.939
trade, commerce, and also it was a hub of

574
00:43:14.939 --> 00:43:20.459
many different ideas from adjacent regions. Which lend themselves

575
00:43:20.459 --> 00:43:25.399
to a practice of using argumentation as a form

576
00:43:25.399 --> 00:43:30.699
of forming meaningful social communication and social communities. So

577
00:43:30.699 --> 00:43:35.300
argument to become the hub of connecting people and

578
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:39.939
forming collectivistic society, which is very different from East

579
00:43:39.939 --> 00:43:45.429
Asian way. And the similar analysis could be Applied

580
00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:50.570
to different regions, Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin

581
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:54.350
America, and so on. And out of this, Western

582
00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:58.649
societies came out over the last several 100 years.

583
00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.179
So let me just ask you one last question

584
00:44:03.179 --> 00:44:06.500
then. Why is, why is it that people have

585
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.689
been focusing so much then on the differences, uh,

586
00:44:10.699 --> 00:44:15.840
cognitive differences between, uh, Western Europe or the West

587
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:19.020
in general and East Asia? I mean, is it

588
00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:23.979
because they are paradigmatic examples of individualist and collectivist

589
00:44:23.979 --> 00:44:27.419
cultures, or is it from for some other more

590
00:44:27.419 --> 00:44:29.000
arbitrary reason?

591
00:44:30.209 --> 00:44:34.570
Both, both. Let me start with the arbitrary reason

592
00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:40.439
part. Well, basically what happened was that in 1950s

593
00:44:40.439 --> 00:44:47.169
and 191960s, psychology was extremely cognitive, you know, people

594
00:44:47.169 --> 00:44:50.010
imagine that the human mind is like a computer,

595
00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.969
which was a, you know, a recent invention around

596
00:44:53.969 --> 00:44:57.719
that time. And if the human mind is a

597
00:44:57.719 --> 00:45:02.879
computer, no way, uh, you can expect a meaningful

598
00:45:02.879 --> 00:45:06.760
cross-cultural differences, and that was fine as far as

599
00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:10.919
it went, because all the subjects in psychology back

600
00:45:10.919 --> 00:45:16.600
then were coming from Western. Individuals. But then East

601
00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:22.330
Asia, Japan initially, immediately followed by Taiwan and Hong

602
00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:26.330
Kong, and eventually by China and Korea and so

603
00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:31.169
on, they became very wealthy, meaning that they became

604
00:45:31.169 --> 00:45:36.304
more interested in Mental health and mental well-being beyond

605
00:45:36.304 --> 00:45:40.725
survival, and that's where psychology came in and providing

606
00:45:40.725 --> 00:45:46.344
data. So that's a historical kind of sociological reasons

607
00:45:46.564 --> 00:45:50.564
which have nothing to do with substance of psychology

608
00:45:50.564 --> 00:45:54.570
or cultural psychology. But it seemed to me that

609
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:58.689
there's a substantive reason why initial focus on East

610
00:45:58.689 --> 00:46:01.169
and the West, that is East Asia and the

611
00:46:01.169 --> 00:46:05.850
Western societies made some sense. The reason being again,

612
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:09.330
you have to go back several 1000 years, and

613
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:12.979
then think about the Eurasian continent. You know, uh,

614
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:18.389
human, human civilization began to occur in several different

615
00:46:18.389 --> 00:46:24.610
places, and essentially East is defined by rice-based civilization

616
00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:28.459
in contemporary China, you know, several 1000 years, maybe

617
00:46:28.459 --> 00:46:33.364
8000 years ago. Now Western civilization happens in Western

618
00:46:33.364 --> 00:46:37.864
part of the Eurasian continent, and then eventually elaborated

619
00:46:37.864 --> 00:46:41.125
by a whole bunch of other things like Renaissance,

620
00:46:41.205 --> 00:46:45.294
Industrial Revolution, and so on, which eventually leads to

621
00:46:45.294 --> 00:46:51.340
contemporary individualism. Now, those two regions are so clearly

622
00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:57.459
separated, geography, geography separated, and, you know, obviously, people

623
00:46:57.459 --> 00:47:00.780
interacted with with each other, uh, you know, through

624
00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:05.600
commas, but genetic data is very clear, East Asia.

625
00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:10.100
WAS separated in terms of genetic interaction that is

626
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:14.820
reproduction uh from the rest of the Eurasian continent,

627
00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:19.780
whereas there's a much greater contact across different parts

628
00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:24.719
of the Eurasian continent through several 1000 years. So

629
00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:28.709
if you compare Western edge and eastern edge. Namely,

630
00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:31.969
East Asia and the West, West, you might end

631
00:47:31.969 --> 00:47:37.330
up having the sharpest possible contrast, and remaining regions

632
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:41.409
may show very interesting stories, but as an initial

633
00:47:41.409 --> 00:47:45.729
step, always it makes sense to focus on sharpest

634
00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:49.610
possible contrast, and that's exactly what the field have

635
00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:50.030
done.

636
00:47:51.649 --> 00:47:55.409
Great. So Doctor Kitayama, just before we go, would

637
00:47:55.409 --> 00:47:57.850
you like to tell people where they can find

638
00:47:57.850 --> 00:47:59.649
your work on the internet?

639
00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:06.159
Oh, I have a lab website. So that's called

640
00:48:06.159 --> 00:48:09.600
Culture and Cognition Lab at the University of Michigan.

641
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:16.679
And you know, that, that's available. Uh, AND, you

642
00:48:16.679 --> 00:48:20.199
know, if you are interested in our current work,

643
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:24.320
we have a paper available in Annual Review of

644
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:31.540
Psychology 2020. For last year, I think that's available

645
00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:34.389
free of charge. Uh, THAT'S, I think it's uh

646
00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:38.459
uh open paper. Uh, SO that may be the

647
00:48:38.459 --> 00:48:40.060
best source to look at.

648
00:48:41.399 --> 00:48:44.129
Thank you. Thank you so much, Doctor Kitayama for
