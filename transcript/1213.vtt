00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:02.930
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.860
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.819
today I'm here with a repeat guest, Dr. Nathan

4
00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:12.180
Lentz. Last time we talked about his book Human

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.210
Errors, and today we're talking about his latest book,

6
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.219
The Sexual Evolution How 500 Million Years of Sex,

7
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.579
Gender, and Mating Shaped Modern Relationships. So, Dr. Lentz,

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.579
welcome back to the show. It's always a pleasure

9
00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:26.190
to everyone.

10
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.020
Thanks very much, and it's a pleasure to be

11
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.420
back.

12
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.259
OK, so, I mean, you go through lots of

13
00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:35.779
different things in the booklet. I will try to

14
00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:38.139
focus just on a handful of them because we

15
00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:40.840
only have an hour today. So, uh, let's, uh,

16
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.220
let me start just with a general question. What

17
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.759
can we learn by looking at the natural history

18
00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:47.759
of sex?

19
00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:50.259
Well, uh, we can learn a lot, and I

20
00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:53.060
think that, um, only recently have we really begun

21
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.229
to appreciate. Uh, THE full diversity of sex in

22
00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.819
the animal world. And so we know that, um,

23
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.099
you know, sex evolved in microscopic organisms first, uh,

24
00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.870
simply as a way to combine two genomes. And

25
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.199
what that allows you to do, it seems simple,

26
00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:13.269
right? But you have to remember that prior to

27
00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:17.230
sexual reproduction, everything reproduced by some version of cloning.

28
00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:20.800
Basically 11 cell kind of splitting into two that

29
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.559
were more or less equal to each other and

30
00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:26.879
the same as what as what pre-existed, but sexual

31
00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:30.550
reproduction changed everything because when you combine the genome

32
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.290
of two individuals, it allows you to over time

33
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.680
select the best, the best versions of all of

34
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.919
the genes. So, you know, if, if a small

35
00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:42.480
bacterium has, I don't know, let's say 10,000 genes

36
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.879
or 5000 genes, there can be different versions of

37
00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:49.310
those genes. Circulating in a gene pool, right? And,

38
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.221
and we, we today, we take this for granted,

39
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:53.831
the idea that there's, uh, you know, different versions

40
00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:55.990
of genes circulating in a gene pool. But there

41
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.630
was a time on Earth when that was a

42
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.250
new thing, and you can imagine what a huge

43
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.250
advantage it was, because when you have two versions

44
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.151
of every gene, for example, in an individual, what

45
00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:09.311
that allows you to do is have a backup

46
00:02:09.311 --> 00:02:12.470
copy, right? So one copy can, can hold the

47
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.251
original function, and then the second copy is free

48
00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:18.942
to sort. Of take on different possible forms and

49
00:02:18.942 --> 00:02:22.022
different functions. And when you have that, that safety

50
00:02:22.022 --> 00:02:26.352
backup, that is the recipe for creative innovation. And

51
00:02:26.352 --> 00:02:28.621
so you can have, and it's random when it

52
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:32.132
begins, but then nature selects for those really good

53
00:02:32.132 --> 00:02:34.182
versions that occasionally come about. Now let me tell

54
00:02:34.182 --> 00:02:37.781
you why that's so powerful. Once you have creativity

55
00:02:37.781 --> 00:02:42.382
built in, every generation, you're constantly generating new combinations

56
00:02:42.382 --> 00:02:44.662
of genes, new versions of genes, and then nature.

57
00:02:44.923 --> 00:02:47.412
CAN act on it, and it allows evolution to

58
00:02:47.412 --> 00:02:51.533
really ramp up. And that's not long after sexual

59
00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:54.533
reproduction first emerged was when you saw creatures get

60
00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:58.152
much more complicated, much more complex, much more sophisticated,

61
00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:01.242
and that happened very quickly thereafter. And the key

62
00:03:01.242 --> 00:03:05.272
to that is diversity, right? Just having diverse versions

63
00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:08.253
of genes and combinations, and it allows all of

64
00:03:08.253 --> 00:03:12.692
this exploration. Now fast forward to the evolution of

65
00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:15.554
animals, right? And I do. Concentrate exclusively on animals

66
00:03:15.554 --> 00:03:17.843
in my book because even though, you know, plants

67
00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:21.524
and fungi reproduce sexually, they don't engage in what

68
00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:24.444
I call behavior, right? So they don't, they're not

69
00:03:24.444 --> 00:03:26.524
out there moving around and so the behavior of

70
00:03:26.524 --> 00:03:28.604
sex is really what, what I'm focusing on in

71
00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:31.044
my book. So fast forward from the invention of

72
00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:34.583
sexual reproduction to animals, and then what you have

73
00:03:34.764 --> 00:03:38.324
is something that we've always known, which is diversity

74
00:03:38.324 --> 00:03:40.563
is good for a population. It's good for a

75
00:03:40.563 --> 00:03:45.154
species, even though individuals. MAY or may not benefit

76
00:03:45.154 --> 00:03:47.794
from their particular kind of diversity. In fact, actually,

77
00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:50.115
when we're talking about genetic diversity, a lot of

78
00:03:50.115 --> 00:03:52.395
times it's bad, right, to have different versions of

79
00:03:52.395 --> 00:03:55.184
genes, but for the species overall, it's really good,

80
00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:57.794
and that's what allowed animals to go all different

81
00:03:57.794 --> 00:04:00.154
directions, you know. They went onto the land, they

82
00:04:00.154 --> 00:04:01.914
went back into the sea. Some of them came

83
00:04:01.914 --> 00:04:04.304
back on the land again, and, you know, they,

84
00:04:04.434 --> 00:04:06.634
you know, learned to fly. They all kinds of

85
00:04:06.634 --> 00:04:10.395
creative innovation comes about purely because we have sexual

86
00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:16.130
reproduction now. Unfortunately, when we have been studying sex

87
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.589
and and sex behaviors and sexual evolution, we've always

88
00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:23.149
been kind of with this lens of, well, we

89
00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:27.390
have males and we have females, and males have

90
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.269
this kind of strategy and they want to sort

91
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.470
of do this thing, and females have this strategy

92
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.190
and they want to be this or do this.

93
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.950
And that leads to what I call optimal thinking,

94
00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:39.480
where there's one best way to be a male

95
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.299
and all the males are trying to be this,

96
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.679
and there's one best way to be a female

97
00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:45.359
and all the females are trying to be this.

98
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.070
And of course competition is, is, is a thing.

99
00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:50.760
It's, it's certainly out there in nature. But what

100
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.649
we, we, but when you take your blinders off

101
00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:56.570
and stop thinking about archetypes, like stop, stop thinking

102
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.250
about optimization and just think about diversity, what you

103
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.929
really see when you look out in nature is

104
00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:06.149
a variety of kinds of males and different strategies

105
00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:08.822
that are successful when one is a male. And

106
00:05:08.822 --> 00:05:11.352
then there's a variety of strategies and ways to

107
00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:14.863
be successful as a female. And as animals explore

108
00:05:14.863 --> 00:05:17.472
these different ways of being, everything we thought we

109
00:05:17.472 --> 00:05:19.912
knew about sex roles or gender roles kind of

110
00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:21.833
goes out the window because we see examples of

111
00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:24.393
animals doing it all kinds of different ways. And,

112
00:05:24.542 --> 00:05:26.472
and this is important, and I'll finally wrap up

113
00:05:26.472 --> 00:05:30.153
this answer, the maleness and femaleness, the strategies start

114
00:05:30.153 --> 00:05:32.756
to overlap and you start to see. See that

115
00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:35.295
you can move in and out of various sex

116
00:05:35.295 --> 00:05:38.936
behaviors and find success. And there's, and I give

117
00:05:38.936 --> 00:05:41.196
lots of examples in my book of animals, um,

118
00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.726
taking on these sort of diverse strategies, diverse roles,

119
00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:47.735
diverse morphologies, meaning their physical appearance, and it's not

120
00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:51.295
tied to a specific way of being. That really

121
00:05:51.295 --> 00:05:54.555
creativity is rewarded by nature time and time again.

122
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.820
OK, so we're going to talk about some of

123
00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.940
those things and I want to get into the

124
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.250
topic of sex and gender and how they differ,

125
00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:05.619
but my first question is, because I want to

126
00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:09.859
take it step by step, what does biological sex

127
00:06:09.859 --> 00:06:13.019
mean for evolutionary biologists? I mean, how do you

128
00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:16.179
distinguish between male and females? Is it on the

129
00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:20.619
basis of gametes, Gnets, sex chromosomes, or some other

130
00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:21.420
criteria?

131
00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:24.179
You are getting at the heart of a. Really

132
00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:26.660
raging debate right now in the field of biology.

133
00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:27.390
How do we define,

134
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.149
I know, I know, I'm aware of that.

135
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.929
How do we define biological sex? And again, because

136
00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:37.540
of that kind of optimized thinking, um, there really

137
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.179
wasn't much controversy until about 20 or 30 years

138
00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:42.500
ago where most, you know, you think, well, males

139
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.739
make sperm and then everything else we associate with

140
00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:48.329
that, that's maleness, and then females make eggs and

141
00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:50.899
everything associated with that, um, is female. But what

142
00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:55.369
we're finding is Defining maleness and femaleness based purely

143
00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:57.420
on gametes, that's just one way to do it.

144
00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.299
And that's, we, we like that way because it's

145
00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:02.459
very binary. It's very clear, it's very simple. An

146
00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:06.059
animal either makes eggs or sperm or both. And

147
00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:08.619
by the way, lots of animals can make both

148
00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:12.100
or do make both, it's especially in invertebrates, but

149
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.660
even marine mammals, you see examples of hermaphroditism. So

150
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.690
that's the ability to make both gametes either at

151
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.690
the same time or at different times. In your

152
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.779
life history. So, by the way, that right off

153
00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:25.579
the bat, binary doesn't quite work, um, when you,

154
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.980
when you consider how common hermaphroditism is in the

155
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.940
animal world. So at least you have three sexes,

156
00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:33.380
right? If you're gonna use gametes. And we like

157
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.950
gametes because they are, you

158
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.859
would count, uh, sorry to interrupt you, but you

159
00:07:36.859 --> 00:07:40.799
would count hermaphroditism as a third sex. Oh, I

160
00:07:40.799 --> 00:07:42.420
think it has to be. If you're defining the

161
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.540
whole animal based on which gamete it makes, you

162
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.579
have sperm, egg, or both. So you could say

163
00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:50.899
that they're both male and female at the same

164
00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:53.970
time, but then you're not binary still, right? So

165
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.700
you could consider hermaphroditism a third kind of comedian.

166
00:07:57.016 --> 00:07:59.967
Sex and this introduces this term gametic sex. So

167
00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:03.657
an animal's gametic sex is which sperm, I mean,

168
00:08:03.777 --> 00:08:06.217
sorry, which gamete they make one, the other, or

169
00:08:06.217 --> 00:08:08.177
both. But that's just one way to define it,

170
00:08:08.256 --> 00:08:10.416
as you mentioned, we also define sex based on

171
00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:13.957
chromosomes. We also define sex based on certain genes

172
00:08:14.057 --> 00:08:15.777
which may or may not be on the sex

173
00:08:15.777 --> 00:08:19.096
chromosome. We can also define animals by their genital

174
00:08:19.096 --> 00:08:21.854
anatomy. We can define them by. Other anatomy throughout

175
00:08:21.854 --> 00:08:23.973
their body, which associates with one sex or the

176
00:08:23.973 --> 00:08:27.174
other, uh, their hormone levels, like, and, and ratios,

177
00:08:27.243 --> 00:08:29.503
there's lots of ways to define sex. And what,

178
00:08:29.574 --> 00:08:32.193
what we find when we measure these across animals

179
00:08:32.193 --> 00:08:35.212
is that besides the sperm and egg, it's not

180
00:08:35.212 --> 00:08:38.614
really that simple, right? Let's, let's take, um, let's

181
00:08:38.614 --> 00:08:42.013
take breast size in humans, because that is a

182
00:08:42.013 --> 00:08:45.370
very dimmorphic feature, meaning males and females have. Very

183
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.010
different averages when it comes to the size of

184
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.651
their breast. But if you map the size of

185
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:52.921
breasts of women on a bell curve and the

186
00:08:52.921 --> 00:08:54.960
size of breasts on a man and a bell

187
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.450
curve, you will find that they overlap, that they

188
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.931
overlap quite a bit. There are females who have

189
00:08:59.931 --> 00:09:02.890
smaller breasts than some males, vice versa, and you

190
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.080
have that. You have a bimodal distribution. OK, well,

191
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:09.969
that's breast size. What about genital anatomy? You actually

192
00:09:09.969 --> 00:09:12.059
end up with the same thing. And the degree

193
00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:14.659
of overlap can be different. Let's talk about hormone

194
00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:17.739
ratios. Once again, you get two bell curves that

195
00:09:17.739 --> 00:09:19.820
overlap. And so what you end up with is

196
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.820
this continuous spectrum. Sometimes, the two humps of the

197
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.224
curves are very obviously separated. Sometimes they bleed. Into

198
00:09:27.224 --> 00:09:29.094
one another. Like if you look at, for example,

199
00:09:29.174 --> 00:09:31.494
waist hip ratio, or if you look at body

200
00:09:31.494 --> 00:09:35.695
hair distribution, these things are not simply clear cut.

201
00:09:36.015 --> 00:09:38.895
Now, some, some would argue, well, that's just variation

202
00:09:38.895 --> 00:09:41.255
of sex-based features. It doesn't change the sex of

203
00:09:41.255 --> 00:09:43.775
the individual. Well, here's how I, here's my counter

204
00:09:43.775 --> 00:09:48.020
to that argument. Um, IF you put everything on

205
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.849
gametes, then you collapse all of that other diversity

206
00:09:50.849 --> 00:09:53.849
into two buckets, and not individuals don't always fit

207
00:09:53.849 --> 00:09:59.200
in their respective, respective bucket. And when, when they

208
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.200
don't fit into that bucket, you're forced to make

209
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.880
a decision. You say, well, this animal behaves like

210
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.520
a female, like most females, like typical females, has

211
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.679
the body shape of a female, the genital anatomy

212
00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:10.719
of a female, and you keep going through this

213
00:10:10.719 --> 00:10:13.349
list, but because they make sperm, they're in the

214
00:10:13.349 --> 00:10:17.320
other bucket, which doesn't make sense for 99% of

215
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.049
that animal's life history, what they're doing, how they're

216
00:10:20.049 --> 00:10:23.546
behaving. How other animals interact with them. There's a

217
00:10:23.546 --> 00:10:26.705
whole different, a whole group of ways in which

218
00:10:26.705 --> 00:10:28.745
they don't fit their bucket. And does it make

219
00:10:28.745 --> 00:10:31.265
sense to force them into a bucket simply because

220
00:10:31.265 --> 00:10:34.765
of the gametes? Why does gametes trump everything else?

221
00:10:34.866 --> 00:10:38.145
And I especially think this applies to humans, because

222
00:10:38.145 --> 00:10:39.906
I want you to think about your daily life,

223
00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:42.106
how you live your life, how you interact with

224
00:10:42.106 --> 00:10:45.932
others. Lots of things are. Sex different when it

225
00:10:45.932 --> 00:10:49.521
comes to that. But how often are the gametes

226
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:52.492
important for that? How often do the gametes affect

227
00:10:52.492 --> 00:10:55.052
your health and disease or your social interactions? There

228
00:10:55.052 --> 00:10:57.291
are diseases that women get far more often than

229
00:10:57.291 --> 00:10:59.242
men. There are diseases that men get more often

230
00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.911
than women. They have different health risks, different health

231
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.971
outcomes, and your physician, you know, really needs to

232
00:11:04.971 --> 00:11:07.081
know your biological sex in order to give you

233
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:09.211
the best care. None of that has to do

234
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:11.760
with sperm or eggs. Right, but it does have

235
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.799
to do with hormone ratios and red blood cell

236
00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:16.679
count and body fat distribution and, and all kinds

237
00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:18.880
of other things that, that show these sex differences.

238
00:11:18.989 --> 00:11:21.140
Those are much more important to your health, disease,

239
00:11:21.359 --> 00:11:24.559
your social interactions. And so acknowledging that sex exists

240
00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:28.710
on this continuous spectrum. Um, ALLOWS sort of people

241
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.159
to have a better fit with their biological sex

242
00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:34.119
and their, and better understanding of it. And remember,

243
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.200
there are people who are very much in the

244
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.229
middle, uh, on a lot of these features. We,

245
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.479
sometimes when it affects the genital anatomy, in particular,

246
00:11:41.599 --> 00:11:44.640
we call them intersex individuals, uh, because we really

247
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.239
focus on genital anatomy. That's all that matters, right?

248
00:11:47.479 --> 00:11:49.840
Um, BUT even if you just want to focus

249
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.020
on that. What do we do with intersex individuals?

250
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.989
Do we say they don't count? Do we say

251
00:11:54.989 --> 00:11:57.630
their sex is not important? Do they say ignore

252
00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.710
everything about them except just look at which sperm

253
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.510
they make or eggs? That's silly. That makes no

254
00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.150
sense. And it also erases them and forces them

255
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.630
into an existence that doesn't match what really matters

256
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.349
to their life, including their health. So acknowledging that

257
00:12:11.349 --> 00:12:14.784
sex is a continuous spectrum with these Bimodal distribution,

258
00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:19.784
it doesn't deny sex differences. It really elevates sex

259
00:12:19.784 --> 00:12:23.544
differences as important, important for us to understand. So

260
00:12:23.544 --> 00:12:25.945
how we define maleness and femaleness is not so

261
00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:28.505
simple, and we shouldn't be afraid of it just

262
00:12:28.505 --> 00:12:32.945
because it is complicated. People like simple categories with

263
00:12:32.945 --> 00:12:38.429
hard boundaries and definitions and clear separation. Sorry, that's

264
00:12:38.429 --> 00:12:41.630
not how life works. It just really doesn't very

265
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.229
often fit into these nice categories. So I opened

266
00:12:44.229 --> 00:12:47.190
my book with a story about why definitions and

267
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.440
categories often get in the way of our understanding.

268
00:12:50.549 --> 00:12:54.989
They collapse diversity and they erase variability and variation,

269
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.190
which, of course, to harken back to my first

270
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.880
answer is nature loves diversity and variety. It's the,

271
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.789
it's the secret to all innovation.

272
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.719
Yeah, you said that this is an ongoing debate

273
00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:09.849
about whether sex is binary or not, and uh

274
00:13:09.849 --> 00:13:12.320
I've had on the show Doctor Agustin Fuentes, who

275
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.200
released the book Sex Is a Spectrum. I talked

276
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.200
a lot about that with him and more recently

277
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.559
I've had Doctor Herman Ponzer on the show, a

278
00:13:20.559 --> 00:13:24.599
biological anthropologist, and he told me that he thought

279
00:13:24.599 --> 00:13:27.320
that uh the arguments put forth by people who

280
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.322
argue. That sex is non-binary are sound scientific arguments,

281
00:13:32.403 --> 00:13:34.723
but he doesn't agree with the conclusion because he

282
00:13:34.723 --> 00:13:37.603
thinks that it is not helpful to say that

283
00:13:37.603 --> 00:13:41.312
sex is non-binary because he says that there are

284
00:13:41.312 --> 00:13:44.723
two main paths in terms of sexual development. And

285
00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:47.963
then, soon I will also have on the show

286
00:13:47.963 --> 00:13:50.833
Doctor Edward Hagen because he wrote a critique of

287
00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:54.406
Doctor Fuentes's. Book Sex is a Spectrum and the

288
00:13:54.406 --> 00:13:57.325
10, I, I think he agrees mostly with Doctor

289
00:13:57.325 --> 00:14:00.916
Herman Ponzer even though Doctor Herman Ponzer also said,

290
00:14:00.926 --> 00:14:03.666
as you did, that it's very hard to precisely

291
00:14:03.666 --> 00:14:07.565
define femaleness and maleness. So, uh, I, I mean,

292
00:14:07.676 --> 00:14:07.726
yeah,

293
00:14:08.005 --> 00:14:09.875
and, and, uh, Augustine Fuentes is a friend of

294
00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:12.125
mine, and, uh, and we're working on an article

295
00:14:12.125 --> 00:14:14.606
together that I think outlines this, what we're saying

296
00:14:14.606 --> 00:14:16.690
and what we're not saying. Uh, A little bit

297
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.690
better, but I do acknowledge that there's different ways

298
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.690
of thinking about this, and some very, very smart

299
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.489
people disagree with me on this, and including, um,

300
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.710
you know, some biologists who study gender diversity, um,

301
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.280
the, the, what, what it comes down to, honestly,

302
00:14:30.289 --> 00:14:33.530
is semantics about what, what we mean when we

303
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.684
say biological sex. If you Define biological sex as

304
00:14:37.684 --> 00:14:40.325
which gamete you make, then it's simple. All we're

305
00:14:40.325 --> 00:14:44.164
arguing for is that biological sex is important in

306
00:14:44.164 --> 00:14:46.085
lots of things throughout your body and throughout your

307
00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:48.715
life. And so to make it all about gametes,

308
00:14:49.005 --> 00:14:52.484
to me, it becomes unhelpful as a category. And

309
00:14:52.484 --> 00:14:55.125
also there is already a term for that, gamedic

310
00:14:55.125 --> 00:14:59.440
sex. Right, we have chromosomal sex, genetic sex, genital

311
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.580
sex, gametic sex. That's already there. That's a term

312
00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.760
that already exists, and we can define people by

313
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.159
their gametic sex relatively neatly and cleanly. So that's

314
00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:12.119
fine. What we're saying is sex is much more

315
00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:14.200
interesting and complicated than just what goes on in

316
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.869
the gonads, right? There's sex biology all throughout our

317
00:15:17.869 --> 00:15:20.760
bodies and our social interactions, right? We are a

318
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.905
biocultural species and we navigate. THROUGH the world differently

319
00:15:25.905 --> 00:15:27.905
based on our sex, and none of that has

320
00:15:27.905 --> 00:15:29.744
to do with which gametes are being made, right?

321
00:15:29.794 --> 00:15:31.465
It has to do with how people treat you,

322
00:15:31.585 --> 00:15:33.784
how you understand your own body, how your body

323
00:15:33.784 --> 00:15:36.575
relates to other bodies, and that's all we're, that's

324
00:15:36.575 --> 00:15:38.945
all we're saying. And if we come back to,

325
00:15:39.065 --> 00:15:40.744
well, we're going to call, we're going to define

326
00:15:40.744 --> 00:15:44.424
things on more precise categories, gametic sex, chromosomal sex,

327
00:15:44.625 --> 00:15:46.625
and then that way we can acknowledge some of

328
00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:49.344
those categories are binary, some of them are continuous.

329
00:15:49.505 --> 00:15:51.505
If we do that, that's fine. We're happy with

330
00:15:51.505 --> 00:15:52.044
that too.

331
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.739
OK, so as an evolutionary biologist, how do you

332
00:15:56.739 --> 00:16:00.169
approach gender? What is gender? Because I've had this

333
00:16:00.169 --> 00:16:02.080
conversation on the show, but it was mostly with,

334
00:16:02.299 --> 00:16:06.900
uh, you know, evolutionary anthropologists, cultural anthropologists, anthropologists in

335
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.059
general. But as an evolutionary biologist, uh, what do

336
00:16:10.059 --> 00:16:11.260
you have to say about that?

337
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:16.659
So, um, there's again, very complicated because as we

338
00:16:16.659 --> 00:16:19.789
apply gender to humans and the anthropologists that you've

339
00:16:19.789 --> 00:16:21.950
interviewed, you know, would be, would be focusing on

340
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.469
the human experience of gender, um, yeah, it's this

341
00:16:24.469 --> 00:16:29.250
constructed reality regarding sex and one's one's relationship with,

342
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.580
with their body and their sex. AND their identity

343
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.700
and their outward expression, but in animals, you can't

344
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.580
quite ask that question of how they feel. But

345
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.679
what you can do is ask how they behave.

346
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.539
And a good another friend of mine, Joan Roughgarden,

347
00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:46.780
has advanced this idea that animal gender has to

348
00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:51.520
do with how an animal approaches reproductive biology. Um,

349
00:16:51.659 --> 00:16:53.619
AND, and, and it's not just their bodies. So,

350
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.140
so she is very willing to admit to simple

351
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.929
classifications based on sex and then much more complicated

352
00:17:00.929 --> 00:17:04.660
classifications based on gender. Only she'll agree with that

353
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.959
only if we apply gender to animals and recognize

354
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.098
that animals have been exploring different ways of being

355
00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:13.449
male and different ways of being female. They've been

356
00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:15.729
doing that for hundreds of millions of years, hence

357
00:17:15.729 --> 00:17:18.459
the title of my book. And, and so Joan

358
00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:22.214
Roughgarard advances the idea of sex. Gender are two

359
00:17:22.214 --> 00:17:26.255
different concepts even in animals and even invertebrate worms,

360
00:17:26.334 --> 00:17:29.574
for example, can have a sex biology which is

361
00:17:29.574 --> 00:17:32.775
focused on gametes, and then gender, which has to

362
00:17:32.775 --> 00:17:35.564
do with behavior, which has to do with mating,

363
00:17:35.734 --> 00:17:37.974
which has to do with parenting, which has to

364
00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:42.564
do with pair bonding, you know, parental relationships, sibling

365
00:17:42.564 --> 00:17:45.295
relationships. So that would be an animal's gender. And

366
00:17:45.295 --> 00:17:47.535
so she sees that an animal can be male,

367
00:17:47.854 --> 00:17:51.291
but there can be flavors of male. There can

368
00:17:51.291 --> 00:17:53.771
be 3 or 4 different kinds of males, and

369
00:17:53.771 --> 00:17:56.251
that would be their gender, right? So, their sex

370
00:17:56.251 --> 00:17:58.572
can be male because they make sperm, and their

371
00:17:58.572 --> 00:18:01.852
gender can be, um, you know, different varieties, and

372
00:18:01.852 --> 00:18:04.531
you would have to name these morphs, uh, you

373
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:07.452
know, something. So that's one way to, and I

374
00:18:07.452 --> 00:18:09.322
support that very much. I like the idea of

375
00:18:09.322 --> 00:18:13.621
applying gender to animals because it acknowledges that physical

376
00:18:13.621 --> 00:18:16.251
things like bodies are one thing, but how that

377
00:18:16.251 --> 00:18:19.131
gets expressed in a population and, and, and especially

378
00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:22.410
in regard to interactions. Um, THAT could be gender,

379
00:18:22.449 --> 00:18:24.250
and that, that would resolve this conflict as well.

380
00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:26.810
That's another way to sort of piece this together

381
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.130
in a way that we can all live with,

382
00:18:28.209 --> 00:18:31.489
I think, is acknowledging that sex and gender are

383
00:18:31.489 --> 00:18:34.770
different but related and that it does apply to

384
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.689
animals. And that's where you'll lose a lot of

385
00:18:36.689 --> 00:18:41.170
evolutionary biologists as well, because they, a lot of

386
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.709
evolutionary biology is in many ways the most conservative

387
00:18:43.709 --> 00:18:47.689
scientific discipline in the life sciences anyway, because there

388
00:18:47.689 --> 00:18:51.420
is this optimization thinking about male and female. So

389
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.339
that's baked into the field. It's changing. It's very

390
00:18:55.339 --> 00:18:57.579
much changing, but that, that's in there. And the

391
00:18:57.579 --> 00:18:59.739
other thing that's in there is that, oh, animals

392
00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:01.300
don't have anything to do with gender. That's a,

393
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.969
that's a human thing. Fine, humans can construct gender,

394
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.369
but animals don't. And what Joan Roughgarden has argued,

395
00:19:06.459 --> 00:19:09.724
I think very powerfully, is that animals. Construct gender

396
00:19:09.905 --> 00:19:12.744
as well. Their interactions with each other based on

397
00:19:12.744 --> 00:19:16.785
sex biology creates this, this diverse way of being

398
00:19:16.785 --> 00:19:20.224
male and female, and, and some of it is

399
00:19:20.224 --> 00:19:24.714
ingrained genetically. There are different forms of male sometimes.

400
00:19:24.984 --> 00:19:27.505
Some of it is behavioral, some of it is

401
00:19:27.505 --> 00:19:30.594
learned. So throughout the cultural history that an animal

402
00:19:30.594 --> 00:19:34.025
is experiencing, and to me and to Joan, that

403
00:19:34.025 --> 00:19:38.680
looks like gender. The interaction of physical, social, psychological,

404
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.579
you know, all of that mixed in creates this

405
00:19:41.579 --> 00:19:45.530
unified identity, diverse but unified, that's gender. And if

406
00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.819
we apply that framework to animals, you don't have

407
00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:49.760
to ask how they think or how they feel

408
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.180
or how they express. You can just watch what

409
00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.339
they do, and you'll see that that diversity naturally

410
00:19:55.339 --> 00:19:58.099
emerges when you're open to it. But if you

411
00:19:58.099 --> 00:20:00.699
view animals as if every male is trying to

412
00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:03.640
be the apex type of male. Then you're gonna

413
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.349
miss a lot of that diversity. You're gonna dismiss

414
00:20:06.469 --> 00:20:09.479
uh the others as suboptimal. I mean, uh, you

415
00:20:09.479 --> 00:20:11.719
should see the language that some biologists use to

416
00:20:11.719 --> 00:20:13.839
describe males that are just different, you know, they'll,

417
00:20:13.959 --> 00:20:17.260
they'll say that they're suboptimal, they're runts, they're imperfect,

418
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.680
um, sometimes they're female mimics, if, if some of

419
00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.640
their differences make them look a little bit like

420
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.400
females. Joan Roughgarten and I, that's all nonsense. What

421
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.439
you really see is diversity within the categories of

422
00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:35.839
sex, and that diversity often leads to success, right?

423
00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:39.400
These different forms persist. They're not just freaks. They're

424
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.640
not one-offs. They're a part of the natural diversity,

425
00:20:42.719 --> 00:20:46.680
the natural toolkit that an animal has to try

426
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.619
to be successful.

427
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.239
Uh, By the way, in regards to sex, do

428
00:20:51.239 --> 00:20:53.569
you, do you think that we should approach it,

429
00:20:53.699 --> 00:20:57.410
uh, uh, from an evolutionary perspective, perspective as if

430
00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:01.640
its own goal was to, uh, an individual to

431
00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.329
reproduce? I mean, is reproduction the only goal of

432
00:21:05.329 --> 00:21:05.910
sex?

433
00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.050
Absolutely not. Although only if you think in the

434
00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.290
broadest sense that everything you do is rep is,

435
00:21:13.489 --> 00:21:15.170
is having to do with sex, right, or having

436
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.410
to do with sexual reproduction, having to do with

437
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.010
creating the next generation. And in a sense, everything

438
00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.430
you do is designed to make you be successful,

439
00:21:22.619 --> 00:21:25.920
either in surviving, reproducing, whatever. But the sex, I

440
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.810
think you mean the sex act itself, it is

441
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.050
not purely about procreation, right? So two individuals coming

442
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.829
together and having sex, and this is true for

443
00:21:34.969 --> 00:21:39.359
animals and humans as well. Sometimes that is purposed

444
00:21:39.359 --> 00:21:42.699
towards procreation, but lots of times it is not.

445
00:21:42.959 --> 00:21:45.400
And if you consider in your own life, how

446
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.959
many times you've had sex, how many times of

447
00:21:47.959 --> 00:21:51.439
those were with the goal of procreation, right? Very

448
00:21:51.439 --> 00:21:55.359
few, many of us never. And, um, and that's

449
00:21:55.359 --> 00:21:57.239
true for other animals as well. They have sex

450
00:21:57.239 --> 00:21:59.439
for a variety of reasons. They have sex, you

451
00:21:59.439 --> 00:22:03.000
know, let's start with the non-controversial ones. Pair bonded

452
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.199
animals have sex with each other to strengthen the

453
00:22:06.199 --> 00:22:10.599
pair bond, to reduce interpair conflict, and to strengthen

454
00:22:10.599 --> 00:22:13.000
the attachment because we know that animals become attached

455
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.219
with one another for the same reason humans do

456
00:22:15.359 --> 00:22:19.920
through hormones in the brain, vasopressin, oxytocin, and other

457
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.760
ones as well, norepinephrine, serotonin. There are hormones involved

458
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.119
in attachment, and those operate in animals. In fact,

459
00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:28.000
we discovered. All that in animals and their attachment,

460
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.579
and we know that sexual activity strengthens that in

461
00:22:31.579 --> 00:22:34.849
certain contexts. So that's the simple non-controversial one right

462
00:22:34.849 --> 00:22:37.260
off the bat, we all know that sex does

463
00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.219
more for us as individuals than just create the

464
00:22:40.219 --> 00:22:43.540
next generation. But let's go beyond that. Animals also

465
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.859
have groups, also have sex in social groups among

466
00:22:46.859 --> 00:22:49.339
the members, and there's lots of examples of how.

467
00:22:49.439 --> 00:22:54.560
That sexual activity reduces aggression. It reduces conflict. It

468
00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:00.359
resolves conflicts. Sometimes it's even somewhat competitive, meaning it's

469
00:23:00.359 --> 00:23:02.920
used, sex can be used to establish a dominance

470
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.479
hierarchy, right? And if you look at the way

471
00:23:05.479 --> 00:23:08.000
that male lions, when male lions, many of them

472
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.920
exist in these multi-male coalitions, that's not just a

473
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.410
single male in every lion pride. Lots of. Lion

474
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:17.489
prides have multiple males, but they are ranked. Lions

475
00:23:17.489 --> 00:23:19.859
are an aggressive species, and they have sex with

476
00:23:19.859 --> 00:23:22.900
each other as a way to establish dominance, and

477
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.339
it kind of looks like a wrestling match, right?

478
00:23:25.619 --> 00:23:26.939
And you might look at that and you say,

479
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:30.140
well, that's not really sex then, that's a dominant

480
00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.290
struggle. It's both. How can you not call it

481
00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:37.640
sex when it's penetrative, it reaches climax. But people

482
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.400
don't want to consider it sex because it doesn't

483
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.640
lead to procreation. Well, if you define sex as

484
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.660
only that which leads to procreation, OK, then fine,

485
00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.040
but that means that I've never had sex in

486
00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:52.189
my life. I've, trust me, I have, right? Sex

487
00:23:52.189 --> 00:23:54.630
is sex, right? We know what sex is and

488
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.349
and the goal of it is not what makes

489
00:23:56.349 --> 00:23:59.510
it sex, it's the act itself. And so, uh,

490
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.390
animals have sex for a whole variety of reasons.

491
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.270
Some of them are, um, 00, and, and to

492
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.099
return to the lions one last moment, you might

493
00:24:06.099 --> 00:24:09.000
ask why they do that is, well, It sure

494
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.359
beats fighting to the death, right? Because when animals

495
00:24:12.359 --> 00:24:15.599
establish dominance by fighting to the death, even the

496
00:24:15.599 --> 00:24:19.119
winner will be injured, right? And potentially, and, and

497
00:24:19.119 --> 00:24:21.520
it's, it's, they're worse off if that's their way.

498
00:24:21.599 --> 00:24:23.839
But if they use sex as a way with

499
00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:26.160
an outcome that's very different, where everyone walks away

500
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.329
happy. The submissive, you know, the loser has to

501
00:24:29.329 --> 00:24:32.810
submit to the more aggressive male, so you still

502
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.719
establish the same goals, but you do that in

503
00:24:34.719 --> 00:24:37.189
a more pro-social way where everyone can walk away

504
00:24:38.219 --> 00:24:42.609
a winner, meaning alive. So that's just one small

505
00:24:42.609 --> 00:24:44.594
example. And then in the book, I Talk about

506
00:24:44.594 --> 00:24:47.525
lots of other uses for sex, and not all

507
00:24:47.525 --> 00:24:49.935
of them are prosocial. Some of times animals use

508
00:24:49.935 --> 00:24:52.885
sex to deceive other members of their group. They

509
00:24:52.885 --> 00:24:54.614
use sex to get an advantage. They use sex

510
00:24:54.614 --> 00:24:58.094
to tire them out. They'll even trade sex for

511
00:24:58.094 --> 00:25:01.270
resources. There are animals that will exchange sex. Um,

512
00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.060
FOR food, for example, or nest building materials or

513
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.380
whatever is valuable to that animal. So once, once

514
00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.089
there's a commodities market, sex is, uh, traded, uh,

515
00:25:12.099 --> 00:25:15.459
for those commodities. And, um, and, and, and that's

516
00:25:15.459 --> 00:25:17.739
normal and natural, right? So there's this tendency to

517
00:25:17.739 --> 00:25:21.359
want to judge that, but why? You know, why?

518
00:25:22.099 --> 00:25:23.640
Animals are just doing what they're doing.

519
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.689
So there's this, there's also transactional sex in non-human

520
00:25:28.689 --> 00:25:29.359
animals.

521
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.280
Oh yes, absolutely. And we've known this for a

522
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.040
long time in the very simplistic sense. You'll see

523
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.680
invertebrate animals, a lot of times, um, a male

524
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.219
will have to give a gift of sufficient quality

525
00:25:41.219 --> 00:25:43.290
in order to convince a female to mate with

526
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.030
him. So those are called nuptial gifts, and we've

527
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.160
known about this for a long time. Sometimes they

528
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.319
have to hunt and find something. Sometimes they make

529
00:25:49.319 --> 00:25:52.640
it themselves. They actually have secretions like that they

530
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.359
offer as payment for sexual acts. So we've known

531
00:25:56.359 --> 00:25:58.770
about that for a long time in invertebrates and

532
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.239
other simple animals, but what we also see in

533
00:26:01.239 --> 00:26:06.079
vertebrates, including our closest relative chimpanzees, chimpanzees will do

534
00:26:06.079 --> 00:26:08.800
favors for each other in the hopes of gaining

535
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.469
sexual activity, including exchanging meat, right? So chimpanzees are

536
00:26:13.469 --> 00:26:15.640
mostly vegetarian, you know, they eat leaves and sticks

537
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.520
and things, but they will occasionally eat monkey meat.

538
00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:21.810
They will hunt small monkeys and eat them. And

539
00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:25.060
it has been shown that chimpanzees, male chimpanzees can

540
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:28.750
buy sexual access from females by giving her gifts.

541
00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:30.770
So I talk about that in the book. I

542
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.989
talk about some baboons that will exchange grooming for

543
00:26:33.989 --> 00:26:36.290
sex, and then of course the famous one is

544
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:40.650
the penguins who will in Antarctica will exchange sex

545
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:43.449
for rocks that are used to build nests. So

546
00:26:43.449 --> 00:26:46.204
they're rocks. You know, are not all equal. Some

547
00:26:46.204 --> 00:26:48.364
rocks are very good for nest building, and those

548
00:26:48.364 --> 00:26:51.925
become, you know, a commodity that females can actually

549
00:26:51.925 --> 00:26:55.364
gain access to by offering sex in exchange for

550
00:26:55.364 --> 00:26:58.755
nest building material. So once sex becomes important to

551
00:26:58.755 --> 00:27:01.244
an animal, there will be exchanges, and there's a

552
00:27:01.244 --> 00:27:04.125
market for these exchanges, and humans did not invent

553
00:27:04.125 --> 00:27:07.864
sex work, the oldest profession indeed.

554
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.020
OK, so with uh all of what you said

555
00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:17.699
about um the non-reproductive goals of sex in mind,

556
00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:22.420
how should we approach homosexuality in animals from an

557
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.979
evolutionary perspective then?

558
00:27:24.709 --> 00:27:28.670
Right, well, when you consider that the only benefit

559
00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:31.890
of sex that wouldn't apply to same-sex sexual behavior

560
00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.060
is procreation, but all of the other forms, all

561
00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.390
of the other benefits, all the other gains that

562
00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.349
you can have from same-sex sexual behavior are still

563
00:27:39.349 --> 00:27:40.979
going to be there. It would be weird if

564
00:27:40.979 --> 00:27:43.329
an animal didn't ever engage in it. I mean,

565
00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.390
think about it this way I can gain an

566
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:51.250
advantage or a relationship or a dominance position. What

567
00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:54.040
if I don't engage in this activity, the only

568
00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.969
thing that I'm, the only thing that happens is

569
00:27:55.969 --> 00:27:59.329
the cost, right? I've, I've missed the opportunity to

570
00:27:59.329 --> 00:28:02.130
have this relationship with half of the group. But

571
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:05.630
if another individual will have sex with either sex,

572
00:28:05.969 --> 00:28:08.280
with either, with any animal, then they have a

573
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.770
natural advantage because they can build their, their social

574
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.819
network in more ways. That's just a simple example.

575
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.689
But when you consider that sex does perform lots

576
00:28:15.689 --> 00:28:18.140
of other functions and has many other benefits. It

577
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.209
would be weird if it was only purposed at

578
00:28:20.209 --> 00:28:23.099
50% of the population. And, but this, this introduces

579
00:28:23.099 --> 00:28:25.819
the idea of what we call strict homosexuality, where

580
00:28:25.819 --> 00:28:29.199
there's an aversion to opposite sex sex, and then

581
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.920
strict heterosexuality where there's an aversion to same-sex sex,

582
00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:35.880
and it's the aversions that you don't really see

583
00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.619
in nature the way you do in humans. Very

584
00:28:38.619 --> 00:28:41.900
few animals would be averse. So essentially what you

585
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.560
could call is all animals are a little bit

586
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.739
bisexual or pansexual, right, because they don't have a

587
00:28:47.739 --> 00:28:51.694
strict aversion, but they might have attraction. One more

588
00:28:51.694 --> 00:28:53.295
one way or the other, and this has been

589
00:28:53.295 --> 00:28:56.474
studied in great detail in bighorn sheep in the

590
00:28:56.474 --> 00:29:00.055
in the American Northwest. Charles Roselli and others have

591
00:29:00.055 --> 00:29:03.055
studied how that attraction takes shape in sheep, and

592
00:29:03.055 --> 00:29:05.895
it is fairly restricted. It's fairly defined. There are

593
00:29:05.895 --> 00:29:08.895
some animals who will really only engage with the

594
00:29:08.895 --> 00:29:12.375
opposite sex or with the same sex, and those

595
00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:14.084
are a minority. Most of them are somewhere in

596
00:29:14.084 --> 00:29:16.744
the middle where they might have one way or

597
00:29:16.744 --> 00:29:18.964
the other, but, you know, in a pinch, they'll

598
00:29:18.964 --> 00:29:21.229
have sex with anyone. Um, AND I think that's

599
00:29:21.229 --> 00:29:23.189
closer to the human experience, where more, more people

600
00:29:23.189 --> 00:29:24.910
are probably more in the middle than we want

601
00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:27.630
to admit, right? Because in, in polite society, we

602
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.949
don't really talk about, uh, sexual fluidity, although we're

603
00:29:30.949 --> 00:29:32.949
getting there. We, we are really starting to, and

604
00:29:32.949 --> 00:29:34.699
more and more people are starting to admit that,

605
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.109
well, I don't know if I'm perfectly straight or

606
00:29:37.109 --> 00:29:39.390
perfectly gay. I'm attracted to this, I'm attracted to

607
00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.719
that. But we, we live in a society that

608
00:29:41.719 --> 00:29:43.660
really forces you to pick a, pick a side

609
00:29:43.959 --> 00:29:46.800
and pick a team. And so those aversions do

610
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.760
get established in our childhood because if you're, let's

611
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.280
say you're mostly sort of heterosexually inclined, well, on

612
00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.920
top of that natural inclination, you have strong social

613
00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.280
consequences to expressing anything homosexual. So that affects how

614
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.420
your attraction. Take shape, right? Especially in a, in

615
00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.020
a childhood during your formative years, if you see

616
00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.540
nothing but harsh negativity applied towards same-sex sexual behavior,

617
00:30:12.619 --> 00:30:16.040
you will internalize that, right? So imagine a world

618
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.459
that was free of all that coercion. I think

619
00:30:18.459 --> 00:30:20.579
what you would see is that most individuals are

620
00:30:20.579 --> 00:30:22.300
sort of in the middle. You might, you know,

621
00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.420
go one way or the other, you know, or

622
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.780
different time periods, or maybe it's based more on

623
00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.930
the individual or whatever. And just to wrap this

624
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:34.579
up. There are some mammal species that we don't

625
00:30:34.579 --> 00:30:38.989
see any same-sex sexual behavior. And those are the

626
00:30:38.989 --> 00:30:43.670
solitary animals. There's not very many solitary mammals because

627
00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:47.810
we are naturally social. Social begins at birth with,

628
00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.869
with breastfeeding, right? So nursing is an inherently social

629
00:30:50.869 --> 00:30:53.189
act, right? So mammals are, are very social like

630
00:30:53.189 --> 00:30:56.930
birds, very social, but there are a few species

631
00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:01.020
that are solitary as adults. And in like orangutans

632
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.390
is the one that we're, we're closely, most closely

633
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:05.459
related to, but Tasmanian devils are the same. There's,

634
00:31:05.589 --> 00:31:07.619
there's a few mammals that are truly solitary as

635
00:31:07.619 --> 00:31:11.550
adults, and you don't see same-sex sexual behavior. So

636
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:15.189
to me, the exception proves the rule that when

637
00:31:15.189 --> 00:31:18.219
you're not a social species, well, there really isn't

638
00:31:18.219 --> 00:31:22.569
any benefit to sex besides procreation. Procreation, that's it,

639
00:31:22.989 --> 00:31:25.630
if you're not social. But if you are social,

640
00:31:25.829 --> 00:31:28.469
there's a whole variety of benefits that come from

641
00:31:28.469 --> 00:31:31.869
sexual activity. So, so that's why in basically all

642
00:31:31.869 --> 00:31:34.910
of those, we do see at least some same-sex

643
00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:38.699
sexual behavior because There's nothing gained by being averse

644
00:31:38.699 --> 00:31:42.400
to it, right? And there is potential gains by

645
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.439
being open to it. So that, that, that's, that's

646
00:31:44.439 --> 00:31:47.959
my theories on orientation. I really don't believe in

647
00:31:47.959 --> 00:31:52.449
sexual orientation as a natural phenomenon. It's certainly true

648
00:31:52.449 --> 00:31:55.680
as a social phenomenon in, in humans. Like we

649
00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.760
are, we are, we're all, you know, encouraged. TO

650
00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.939
check a box and be something clear and distinct

651
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.640
because that gains you a community, that gains you

652
00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.000
a solidarity that helps mark the borders of social

653
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.319
groups and humans do have this inherent inherent desire

654
00:32:12.319 --> 00:32:14.920
to put people into groups and categories that we

655
00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.510
can understand and define. We're back to that same

656
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.359
topic, but nature doesn't work that way.

657
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:28.199
OK, so we've already addressed homosexuality and same-sex behaviors.

658
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.699
Uh, WHAT would you say to people who, I

659
00:32:31.699 --> 00:32:35.380
guess most of them follow on the conservative end

660
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.310
of the political spectrum when they claim that, um,

661
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.260
something like permanent monogamous marriage is not only the

662
00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.479
proper way to make a family, but the bedrock

663
00:32:46.479 --> 00:32:49.300
institution around which society is built.

664
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.689
OK, well, to the latter question, marriage as the

665
00:32:52.689 --> 00:32:55.849
bedrock institution around society is built, can't argue with

666
00:32:55.849 --> 00:32:58.369
that. In a lot of cultures, um, you know,

667
00:32:58.849 --> 00:33:02.310
the, the primary social group is the natal family,

668
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.270
and, uh, the nuclear family is sometimes called. But

669
00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:09.430
that is a social development that that came across

670
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:14.670
over time, particularly after farming and after the development

671
00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:17.750
of civilization in the sense of where you had

672
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:23.270
property, land ownership, and commodities essentially. What, what we

673
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.069
see when we look across human cultures outside of

674
00:33:26.069 --> 00:33:30.270
industrialized societies, we see a whole variety of family-making

675
00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:33.349
behaviors. It's not a nuclear family as the only

676
00:33:33.349 --> 00:33:36.819
way to be. If you consider humans. In their

677
00:33:36.819 --> 00:33:39.579
pre-industrialized state, and that's what we see in other

678
00:33:39.579 --> 00:33:41.900
animals as well. We see a whole variety of

679
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.979
family structures. You see cooperative alloe parenting. That's one

680
00:33:44.979 --> 00:33:47.579
of my favorite examples. There are primates who really

681
00:33:47.579 --> 00:33:51.520
care for each other's children almost indiscriminately, almost indiscriminately

682
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.660
with regard to genetic parentage. They just, you know,

683
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.060
raise children as a group. You see other kinds.

684
00:33:57.192 --> 00:33:59.593
The structures where the males and females don't interact

685
00:33:59.593 --> 00:34:02.113
socially much at all. They come together for procreation

686
00:34:02.113 --> 00:34:04.552
and then they go back to their sex segregated

687
00:34:04.552 --> 00:34:07.192
groups. So there's no such thing as a nuclear

688
00:34:07.192 --> 00:34:10.632
family in those, in those animals. And so I

689
00:34:10.632 --> 00:34:13.433
think most people who are interested in, you know,

690
00:34:13.592 --> 00:34:17.232
permanent monogamous marriage, they're really only talking about humans.

691
00:34:17.433 --> 00:34:19.885
You don't see. Very many models of that in

692
00:34:19.885 --> 00:34:21.804
the animal world. There are a few. There are

693
00:34:21.804 --> 00:34:24.605
a few animals who really create, um, you know,

694
00:34:24.686 --> 00:34:27.284
a breeding pair and their children, and that's the

695
00:34:27.284 --> 00:34:30.966
group, right? So copperrititi monkeys in South America, you

696
00:34:30.966 --> 00:34:33.804
know, have that social structure, but that's not a

697
00:34:33.804 --> 00:34:36.766
good model for ours. You know why? That group

698
00:34:36.766 --> 00:34:40.125
does not interact with any other groups. They, that

699
00:34:40.125 --> 00:34:42.605
is, that is a group, and if there's another

700
00:34:42.605 --> 00:34:46.436
group, they are in conflict. There's territoriality. There's mutual

701
00:34:46.436 --> 00:34:49.719
aggression. So that's not how we live. We do

702
00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:53.478
live in families often, but those families aren't, aren't,

703
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.340
you know, isolated on a little island by themselves,

704
00:34:56.478 --> 00:34:59.379
right? They live in a very intricate social web

705
00:34:59.379 --> 00:35:03.310
of interactions, and individual members have their own relationships,

706
00:35:03.639 --> 00:35:06.320
groups that have relationships with each other, and that's

707
00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.790
closer to what you see in a lot of

708
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:11.040
other animals, even those that form a breeding pair.

709
00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:13.830
But let me talk about monogamy since it's come

710
00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:15.830
up a couple of times. So in humans, when

711
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.419
we talk about monogamy, we're mostly talking about sexual

712
00:35:18.419 --> 00:35:22.510
fidelity, so sexual exclusivity within a relationship. And in

713
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:25.110
lots of communities, you know, people talk about monogamy

714
00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:28.689
as just restricting sex between a pair. But that's

715
00:35:28.689 --> 00:35:31.929
sexual monogamy. Social monogamy is what we see in

716
00:35:31.929 --> 00:35:34.429
animals. We don't really see sexual monogamy that often.

717
00:35:34.729 --> 00:35:36.889
There are some examples, but very rare. What you

718
00:35:36.889 --> 00:35:39.919
see is social monogamy, which is the pairing up,

719
00:35:40.169 --> 00:35:45.570
the enduring pair bond around which family making takes

720
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.689
place, homesteading, you might say, like building a nest,

721
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.649
building a den, and sometimes that lasts for a

722
00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:54.290
breeding season if it's, you have seasonal behaviors like

723
00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:57.370
you do in most of the northern hemisphere. Um,

724
00:35:57.689 --> 00:35:59.810
BUT, or, or sometimes it lasts for a lifetime.

725
00:35:59.919 --> 00:36:01.709
There are birds that will mate for a lifetime,

726
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.050
and that pair bond endures even when they migrate

727
00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:07.129
separately. There are migratory birds where the males and

728
00:36:07.129 --> 00:36:09.489
females do not migrate together, but they still find

729
00:36:09.489 --> 00:36:11.729
each other when they get there, year after year

730
00:36:11.729 --> 00:36:14.169
after year. It's amazing, and, and, and they're, they

731
00:36:14.169 --> 00:36:18.000
are, birds are, are the role models of an

732
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.610
enduring pair bond. But it's not sexually exclusive. I'm

733
00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:24.399
sorry to tell you. Most of these birds are

734
00:36:24.399 --> 00:36:27.610
also engaging in sexual activity outside of that pair

735
00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:30.909
bond, and that doesn't necessarily threaten the pair bond.

736
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.139
In some species, they will try to prevent that.

737
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:37.459
There's still, you know, jealousy, if you will. It's

738
00:36:37.459 --> 00:36:40.250
still like a conflict. Um, YOU know, so they

739
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:43.290
might try to interfere with each other's extramarital sexual

740
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:45.770
activity, but the pair bond is still there, and

741
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.929
they still, you know, build their family together or

742
00:36:47.929 --> 00:36:50.370
whatever it is they do. And so sexual monogamy

743
00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:52.530
and social monogamy really have to be discussed on

744
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:55.250
different terms because they are different. Sometimes they go

745
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:57.610
together and in humans we've joined them like in

746
00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:00.040
this kind of permanent situation where they can't be

747
00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.889
extracted from each other. But the point I want

748
00:37:01.889 --> 00:37:05.689
to make is that's a relatively new phenomenon to

749
00:37:05.689 --> 00:37:08.649
join sexual and social monogamy as a As an

750
00:37:08.649 --> 00:37:12.699
imperative and the only way to live. I'm sorry,

751
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.219
that is not natural. I'm not saying there's anything

752
00:37:15.219 --> 00:37:17.860
wrong with it. It's fine. It's great, but to

753
00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.060
say that that's the only way that that is

754
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.500
not supported biologically because we see across all the

755
00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:28.620
other animals and including human societies that that are

756
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.780
free of this industrialized, you know, social norms, you

757
00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.719
see a whole variety of relationships and sexual monogamy.

758
00:37:35.979 --> 00:37:39.389
I'm sorry, it's pretty rare. Um, EVEN in other

759
00:37:39.389 --> 00:37:42.489
human groups, it's just not that common. And so,

760
00:37:42.729 --> 00:37:45.429
um, again, nothing wrong with it. One of the

761
00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:47.469
points I make in my book is that humans

762
00:37:47.469 --> 00:37:49.709
aren't really built for any one specific way of

763
00:37:49.709 --> 00:37:53.070
being, and we're, we're inherently adaptable and flexible, including

764
00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:57.495
socially, and we have evolved into this monogamy. You

765
00:37:57.495 --> 00:37:59.895
know, monogamous kind of marriage situation, and it works

766
00:37:59.895 --> 00:38:03.254
for many, many people. And I think that's, that's

767
00:38:03.254 --> 00:38:05.614
fine. That's great, and it's been a successful social

768
00:38:05.614 --> 00:38:08.435
structure, but it's not the only one that we're,

769
00:38:08.534 --> 00:38:10.925
that is congruent with our biology. We could do,

770
00:38:11.014 --> 00:38:12.564
we could make families in a whole variety of

771
00:38:12.564 --> 00:38:14.975
ways, and other human societies have been doing that,

772
00:38:15.175 --> 00:38:16.574
you know, since the dawn of time.

773
00:38:17.659 --> 00:38:19.899
Yeah, I've had this conversation on the show with

774
00:38:19.899 --> 00:38:23.219
many anthropologists by now. I mean, I remember, for

775
00:38:23.219 --> 00:38:26.419
example, my conversation with the late Doctor Helen Fisher.

776
00:38:26.459 --> 00:38:29.330
I mean, she falls more on the side of

777
00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:32.899
saying that mon uh at least serial monogamy probably

778
00:38:32.899 --> 00:38:35.739
is more natural, but then there are arguments in.

779
00:38:36.054 --> 00:38:39.004
OF polygyny and then we also have polyandry. I

780
00:38:39.004 --> 00:38:41.364
mean, it's all the evidence is all over the

781
00:38:41.364 --> 00:38:41.655
place.

782
00:38:41.814 --> 00:38:43.935
So, and I think that's the point that's telling

783
00:38:43.935 --> 00:38:45.844
us something. The fact that the evidence is all

784
00:38:45.844 --> 00:38:48.054
over the place tells us that there isn't one

785
00:38:48.054 --> 00:38:51.175
answer to this, that humans are flexible and adaptable,

786
00:38:51.254 --> 00:38:55.054
and that's our strength, actually, right? I mean, think

787
00:38:55.054 --> 00:38:58.580
about it this way. What animal can live in

788
00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:03.860
the desert, the tundra, the coastlines, temperate rainforests, tropical

789
00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.699
rainforest? We can live in every single kind of

790
00:39:06.699 --> 00:39:09.979
climate because we're not built for any one of

791
00:39:09.979 --> 00:39:12.659
those. We're built to create what we need to

792
00:39:12.659 --> 00:39:15.820
survive in any environment, and I would say socially

793
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.260
we have that same flexibility, and that's always been

794
00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:18.989
our strength.

795
00:39:19.939 --> 00:39:22.739
Yeah. So, of course, another topic that I want

796
00:39:22.739 --> 00:39:25.860
to address here and I think, uh, I'm not

797
00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.020
sure, but this is probably the first time I'm

798
00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.899
about to ask an evolutionary biologist about this topic.

799
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:35.620
So, uh how do you approach uh transgender people

800
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.340
from a biological perspective?

801
00:39:37.919 --> 00:39:41.800
Well, first of all, I think that transgender identity

802
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.520
and a feeling that one's gender expression doesn't match

803
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.120
with their biology at birth, I think that's normal

804
00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.149
and natural. I think that we see that in

805
00:39:49.149 --> 00:39:51.360
other animals in the way that they don't fit

806
00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:55.040
their box always in various ways. Animals, whether based

807
00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.679
on which gamete they make, they behave in ways

808
00:39:57.679 --> 00:40:01.020
that doesn't fit our expectations for that gamete, right,

809
00:40:01.429 --> 00:40:04.239
for that gamete producing body. Um, AND we see

810
00:40:04.239 --> 00:40:07.840
that all the time. Sometimes, um, it's not successful.

811
00:40:07.909 --> 00:40:10.260
It makes them not fit into the social group,

812
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.000
and so they, they wouldn't, you know, have offspring,

813
00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.879
and, and pass that on. In other cases, they

814
00:40:15.879 --> 00:40:20.669
do. Sometimes just being different is an advantage. Um,

815
00:40:20.679 --> 00:40:22.639
IT makes you stick out from the crowd and

816
00:40:22.639 --> 00:40:24.739
if everybody's trying to do one thing one way,

817
00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.760
and you have a different way. Of being sometimes,

818
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:30.669
not always, sometimes that can be an advantage. And

819
00:40:30.669 --> 00:40:32.469
so the way that I apply this to the

820
00:40:32.469 --> 00:40:35.429
human experience of being transgender is, well, we have

821
00:40:35.429 --> 00:40:37.310
sex biology. We have our, we have our bodies,

822
00:40:37.379 --> 00:40:39.219
we have our gametes, we have our gonads, we

823
00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:42.830
have our genitals. We also have behaviors, and those

824
00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:46.070
behaviors stem from some sort of inner identity or

825
00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:51.050
inner experience of our sexed body now. With nature

826
00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:55.290
constantly producing diversity, it would also produce diversity in

827
00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:59.010
that internal understanding. Why would that one thing be

828
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:02.530
spared from nature's tendency to create diversity, right? We

829
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:04.810
know that nature has created diversity with our sexed

830
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:08.090
bodies, so why not our sexed identities? Why would

831
00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.909
that be any different? And what we've seen across

832
00:41:11.409 --> 00:41:15.489
historical Periods and different geographic places all over the

833
00:41:15.489 --> 00:41:18.770
world and all time periods, there's always been a

834
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:23.120
small but persistent percentage of these populations that don't

835
00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.770
act in the expected way for their for their

836
00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.889
sex. That's just, it's just a fact. You see

837
00:41:28.889 --> 00:41:32.070
it everywhere. What we call transgender now has existed

838
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:35.500
in all times and places. It's a minority, but

839
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.860
it's there, and there also seems to be evidence

840
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.820
that it is somewhat genetic, but not purely. And

841
00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.820
so you have this diversity that pops up in

842
00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:48.060
people's inner understanding. Now, in our modern era, it

843
00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:51.929
will look different than how it's expressed. 2000 years

844
00:41:51.929 --> 00:41:55.530
ago in a hunter-gatherer tribe, because their experience of

845
00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:58.770
masculinity and femininity will be different. It will always

846
00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:02.409
be culturally dependent. What is masculine is besides our

847
00:42:02.409 --> 00:42:04.860
bodies is defined by the culture at the time.

848
00:42:05.139 --> 00:42:06.969
So in our current time and place when you

849
00:42:06.969 --> 00:42:11.040
have access to hormone replacement therapy and surgery and

850
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.050
also just clothing, makeup, all of that, when you

851
00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:16.860
have access to all of that. It's, to me,

852
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.199
it seems rather obvious that those with a discordant

853
00:42:20.199 --> 00:42:24.600
sexual identity, which we call gender identity, would explore

854
00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.040
that with the tools that they have available in

855
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.439
that culture. So, I gave one example, a very

856
00:42:30.439 --> 00:42:32.639
simple example of a trans, what I think is

857
00:42:32.639 --> 00:42:35.719
a transgender individual from 500 years ago. They didn't

858
00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:38.320
have hormone therapy or surgery or anything like that

859
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.399
because that wasn't in the cultural toolkit at the

860
00:42:40.399 --> 00:42:44.610
time, but they did. Um, CROSS-DRESS, if you will,

861
00:42:44.689 --> 00:42:48.010
and cross-present as the opposite sex because in the

862
00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:50.179
ways that were appropriate at that time and place,

863
00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.689
what they had access to. So what, what, what

864
00:42:52.689 --> 00:42:57.659
you saw was an internal gender identity or, or,

865
00:42:57.689 --> 00:43:01.469
or gender discordance, if you will, that then found

866
00:43:01.889 --> 00:43:05.929
expression. And this particular individual was able to live

867
00:43:05.929 --> 00:43:09.810
a life and be successful and, and have incredible

868
00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:12.209
adventures. She actually happened to be a pretty cruel

869
00:43:12.209 --> 00:43:16.560
person. But that was made possible by this inner

870
00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.959
gender identity. And you, before you say, well, then

871
00:43:19.959 --> 00:43:23.659
anybody could do that, but they don't, right? So,

872
00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:27.520
uh, the world for many centuries has been very

873
00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.639
much more easy to navigate as a male than

874
00:43:29.639 --> 00:43:33.040
a female, but you don't see droves and droves

875
00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.919
of females just pretending to be male in order

876
00:43:34.919 --> 00:43:37.679
to be successful. Because they don't have that inner

877
00:43:37.679 --> 00:43:40.600
experience of feeling like a male. They might lament

878
00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.560
the fact that they're females because females have so

879
00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.760
much, you know, oppressive, um, you know, social baggage

880
00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.560
put on them, but that doesn't make them feel

881
00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.159
like a man. It makes them feel like an

882
00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:51.959
oppressed female. But if you're a transgender individual with

883
00:43:51.959 --> 00:43:54.639
a transgender identity, you have a way out of

884
00:43:54.639 --> 00:43:57.419
that bucket into a bucket where you're more fit.

885
00:43:57.679 --> 00:44:00.679
And like I said, animals that experiment with their

886
00:44:00.679 --> 00:44:03.679
sex behaviors and sex biology is in line with

887
00:44:03.679 --> 00:44:07.340
that same kind of The the sex, the understanding

888
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.520
of your own sexed body doesn't always match with

889
00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:14.639
the sexed body, or there's variations thereof, and an

890
00:44:14.639 --> 00:44:17.139
individual will find the way in which they feel

891
00:44:17.139 --> 00:44:21.159
they most fit, human or animal, that transgender expression,

892
00:44:21.219 --> 00:44:24.100
we always see, you know, small amounts of it

893
00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.550
in basically every population.

894
00:44:26.929 --> 00:44:29.169
Yeah, I, I guess that's one of the strongest

895
00:44:29.169 --> 00:44:33.530
arguments in favor of there being, uh, I'm not

896
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:36.649
sure if it's a genetic predisposition or at least

897
00:44:36.649 --> 00:44:41.449
a biological predisposition or a biological basis to transgender

898
00:44:41.449 --> 00:44:44.729
identities is the fact that if, I mean, I

899
00:44:44.729 --> 00:44:49.510
guess that all people who are transgender were raised

900
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:52.300
by. Their families and and other people in their

901
00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:56.199
communities as the sex they were born as and

902
00:44:56.209 --> 00:45:00.340
and still they develop that sort of transgender identity

903
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:05.280
and that gender incongruence and they say they identify

904
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.729
as the opposite sex, right? So I mean it's

905
00:45:08.729 --> 00:45:12.280
a very strong feeling that people have.

906
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:16.290
Yeah, exactly. And that comes from somewhere, right? And

907
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:18.409
there are some who pathologize it and say that

908
00:45:18.409 --> 00:45:20.649
it's a problem that must be fixed. But my

909
00:45:20.649 --> 00:45:23.090
point is, why would you want to have that

910
00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:25.719
as a default assumption, especially when you see how

911
00:45:25.719 --> 00:45:28.639
common these things are throughout different societies and cultures,

912
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:31.294
when actually the easier thing to do is to

913
00:45:31.294 --> 00:45:32.925
just let people be who they want to be,

914
00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:37.294
right? And the, the pushback, sometimes, again, because we're

915
00:45:37.294 --> 00:45:39.175
designed to want to pick a camp and and

916
00:45:39.175 --> 00:45:42.054
find solidarity, sometimes the pushback, in my view, makes

917
00:45:42.054 --> 00:45:44.695
everything worse for everyone, because then you force people

918
00:45:44.695 --> 00:45:47.614
into a hardened sense of themselves that might still

919
00:45:47.614 --> 00:45:50.334
be taking shape. So one of the things, you

920
00:45:50.334 --> 00:45:53.375
know, if parents sometimes approach me and say, you

921
00:45:53.375 --> 00:45:55.415
know, my child might be transgender, I don't know

922
00:45:55.415 --> 00:45:57.814
what to do. And I always say, just let

923
00:45:57.814 --> 00:46:01.479
them be. Just let them be. This, this could

924
00:46:01.479 --> 00:46:04.040
be something that is fluid and, and, and, and

925
00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.510
they move in and out of it, they might

926
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:07.290
end up in a different place than you're imagining.

927
00:46:07.399 --> 00:46:10.439
Just let them be. And, and then without, cause

928
00:46:10.439 --> 00:46:13.280
then they're not reacting against an oppression. There's always

929
00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.239
a tendency to, to dig your heels in and

930
00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:16.959
push back when someone tells you that they know

931
00:46:16.959 --> 00:46:19.189
who you are more than you do, right? So,

932
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.199
let them be and let them explore who they're

933
00:46:21.199 --> 00:46:23.239
gonna be. And I think that we see much

934
00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:25.760
better outcomes in that way. Another thing I want

935
00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.830
to say, and I make this point in the

936
00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:29.929
book is that I think even further proof of

937
00:46:29.929 --> 00:46:33.379
this is what it means to be transgender has

938
00:46:33.379 --> 00:46:35.530
continued to evolve even over the last couple of

939
00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:38.979
decades. So through the, you know, trans, trans, we

940
00:46:38.979 --> 00:46:41.500
use the word transsexual through the 20th century, and

941
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:45.899
transsexuals actually were more accepted now than, excuse me,

942
00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:50.800
than transgender, than transgender individuals now because transsexual meant

943
00:46:50.844 --> 00:46:54.344
You really wanted to just be the other sex

944
00:46:54.485 --> 00:46:57.794
and fully conform to it, leave everything masculine behind,

945
00:46:57.804 --> 00:47:00.485
and adopt a fully feminine outward appearance. Well, what

946
00:47:00.485 --> 00:47:03.665
we see now in transgender individuals is much more

947
00:47:04.125 --> 00:47:07.205
fuzzy understanding of masculinity and femininity and kind of

948
00:47:07.205 --> 00:47:10.745
mixing and matching and playing around and getting creative

949
00:47:10.745 --> 00:47:14.419
with gender rather than just simply conforming. And that

950
00:47:14.419 --> 00:47:18.159
seems to upset people most of all. Why? Because

951
00:47:18.459 --> 00:47:20.899
the buckets, you don't fit in a bucket. A

952
00:47:20.899 --> 00:47:22.979
transsexual individual is like, oh, OK, you don't want

953
00:47:22.979 --> 00:47:24.699
to be in this bucket, so you're in that

954
00:47:24.699 --> 00:47:26.419
one, but we still have the two buckets, so

955
00:47:26.419 --> 00:47:30.419
everything's fine, everything's safe. Um, TRANSGENDER individuals are thinking

956
00:47:30.419 --> 00:47:32.699
outside of the buckets more and more, not all,

957
00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:33.939
right? I'm not, I don't want to paint them

958
00:47:33.939 --> 00:47:37.000
with one brush. That's what I'm reacting against. But

959
00:47:37.139 --> 00:47:39.360
the idea that Maybe some people don't fit in

960
00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.679
these neat buckets at all. And why is that

961
00:47:41.679 --> 00:47:43.399
a problem? Why not just let them be who

962
00:47:43.399 --> 00:47:46.360
they're going to be? Um, AND it also, I

963
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.229
think, changes our own relationship with masculinity and femininity.

964
00:47:49.399 --> 00:47:53.189
When you see, you know, otherwise masculine individuals playing

965
00:47:53.189 --> 00:47:55.959
around with feminine fashions, we'll say, it makes the

966
00:47:55.959 --> 00:47:58.790
whole category more expansive, and it gives that creativity,

967
00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.679
that license to explore and create. And I think

968
00:48:01.679 --> 00:48:04.489
that gender is One of the most fascinating things

969
00:48:04.489 --> 00:48:07.300
that humans do, and I don't want to eliminate

970
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.500
that. Some people are like, oh, just eliminate gender.

971
00:48:09.629 --> 00:48:11.899
No, gender is fun. You, you play around with

972
00:48:11.899 --> 00:48:13.280
it and you interact with each other in these

973
00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.020
cool and creative ways. And it's a, it's something

974
00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.840
that, that animals do as well, right? Brightly colored

975
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.219
and dramatic behaviors, courtship behaviors, you know, gender is

976
00:48:22.219 --> 00:48:24.370
one of those things that's, that's some of the

977
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:26.560
interesting, most interesting behaviors we do.

978
00:48:27.959 --> 00:48:30.370
OK, so we have around 10 more minutes. I'm

979
00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:32.520
going to ask you one question and if you,

980
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:35.449
if we still have time, another question. But let

981
00:48:35.449 --> 00:48:37.449
me ask you this because I'm very interested in

982
00:48:37.449 --> 00:48:39.689
your opinion. I mean, I, I've had a conversation

983
00:48:39.689 --> 00:48:42.689
back in 2022 with the late great Doctor Franz

984
00:48:42.689 --> 00:48:45.330
de Waal about his book Different Gender Through the

985
00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:48.250
Eyes of a Primatologist, a very interesting book, by

986
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.409
the way. And the very interesting thing that he

987
00:48:50.409 --> 00:48:53.969
told me is that uh there's only one species

988
00:48:53.969 --> 00:49:01.754
where he sees. Individuals discriminating against non-typical behaviors against

989
00:49:02.135 --> 00:49:07.294
same-sex behaviors against individuals who do not behave exactly

990
00:49:07.294 --> 00:49:09.455
the same way as the typical male or the

991
00:49:09.455 --> 00:49:11.935
typical female, and so on and so forth, and

992
00:49:11.935 --> 00:49:15.014
that's humans. Humans seem to be the only species

993
00:49:15.014 --> 00:49:19.655
that have that moralize these kinds of things and

994
00:49:19.655 --> 00:49:22.995
discriminate against these people. So where do you think

995
00:49:22.995 --> 00:49:24.635
that stems from?

996
00:49:25.469 --> 00:49:28.979
So that's a great point, right? Because other animals,

997
00:49:28.989 --> 00:49:32.469
we don't see, you know, policing around gender and

998
00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:34.639
other things, but you do in humans. So my,

999
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:37.550
my idea in this is that humans evolved. First

1000
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:40.229
of all, we have much larger brains, right? So

1001
00:49:40.229 --> 00:49:43.510
we are under social understanding, um, and, and complexity

1002
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:47.149
of thought obviously is greater, but humans evolved and

1003
00:49:47.149 --> 00:49:48.629
where they gained a lot of what we think

1004
00:49:48.629 --> 00:49:52.570
of as uniquely human. During about a million, 1.5

1005
00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:56.820
million years in which small groups were competing against

1006
00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:00.179
one another, right? And this goes back to our

1007
00:50:00.179 --> 00:50:03.139
understanding of how generosity and mutual aid really evolved

1008
00:50:03.139 --> 00:50:06.159
in our species is that within a small group,

1009
00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.820
a very selfish individual will not, you know, will

1010
00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.780
have a hard time taking over that group. But

1011
00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:14.030
if he does, what You have is a selfish

1012
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:17.149
group going against a cooperative group. The cooperative group

1013
00:50:17.149 --> 00:50:19.949
will win every time. So we're a species that

1014
00:50:19.949 --> 00:50:23.989
has evolved to be cooperative and to police selfishness,

1015
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:26.389
at least a little bit, and to try to

1016
00:50:26.389 --> 00:50:29.830
keep everybody on the same team. And same team

1017
00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:33.909
is solidarity, mutual understanding, and that sense of social

1018
00:50:33.909 --> 00:50:40.409
identity. But a cohesive social identity requires other. So

1019
00:50:40.409 --> 00:50:42.530
this is the group and that is not the

1020
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:44.850
group. So when these groups are competing against one

1021
00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:48.129
another, they establish an identity that's cohesive for this

1022
00:50:48.129 --> 00:50:50.889
group and exclusive of others, because remember, if everyone's

1023
00:50:50.889 --> 00:50:52.669
in the group, there isn't a group. A group

1024
00:50:52.669 --> 00:50:54.729
is defined by having some people in it and

1025
00:50:54.729 --> 00:50:57.510
not others. And so what that gave rise to

1026
00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:01.090
is racism, xenophobia, and all of that fear of

1027
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:03.489
others that this person is different. They're not in

1028
00:51:03.489 --> 00:51:05.850
our group, and therefore they're an enemy. They're to

1029
00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:08.211
be feared. They're to be fought. And so when

1030
00:51:08.211 --> 00:51:11.092
you have social groups that were competing against one

1031
00:51:11.092 --> 00:51:14.211
another, the most successful groups had the strongest sense

1032
00:51:14.211 --> 00:51:17.771
of solidarity. The members would die for each other

1033
00:51:17.771 --> 00:51:20.291
in battle, right? If you imagine like early civilizations,

1034
00:51:20.382 --> 00:51:22.291
right? You had to convince members of your group

1035
00:51:22.291 --> 00:51:24.632
that it was, that the group was so important

1036
00:51:24.892 --> 00:51:27.691
that you would be willing to sacrifice yourself for

1037
00:51:27.691 --> 00:51:30.211
the good of the group. That's how strong our

1038
00:51:30.211 --> 00:51:34.092
sense of solidarity and group cohesion is. The dark

1039
00:51:34.092 --> 00:51:39.533
side. Solidarity is othering, right, xenophobia. And when you

1040
00:51:39.533 --> 00:51:43.773
apply gender nonconformity in that, it's the same concept.

1041
00:51:43.854 --> 00:51:47.214
You're like this violates the social order. This breaks

1042
00:51:47.214 --> 00:51:50.553
down group cohesion, and therefore it is to be

1043
00:51:50.854 --> 00:51:52.773
feared, it is to be loathed, it is to

1044
00:51:52.773 --> 00:51:54.733
be eliminated. It is to be oppressed. It is

1045
00:51:54.733 --> 00:51:57.614
to be suppressed, right? The best outcome, of course,

1046
00:51:57.694 --> 00:51:59.513
is just suppress it and hope it goes away.

1047
00:52:00.134 --> 00:52:03.775
But in my view, that's Where our reaction against

1048
00:52:03.775 --> 00:52:05.976
people who are different, because it's, it's not just

1049
00:52:05.976 --> 00:52:08.535
gender expression, right? If people who are different who

1050
00:52:08.535 --> 00:52:11.775
stick out in almost any way, can be the

1051
00:52:11.775 --> 00:52:15.676
victim of social violence and social exclusion. And so

1052
00:52:16.535 --> 00:52:18.936
it's part of a larger pattern of, hey, you

1053
00:52:18.936 --> 00:52:20.976
can't be too different because then you're not one

1054
00:52:20.976 --> 00:52:23.815
of us, you're, you're something else. So that's in

1055
00:52:23.815 --> 00:52:25.575
my view, that's where it comes from, is our

1056
00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:29.315
social history of cooperation and cohesion and solidarity.

1057
00:52:30.379 --> 00:52:34.090
OK, so what would you like for people to

1058
00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:36.219
take from your book? I mean, what would you

1059
00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:38.959
say is the main take in terms of, uh

1060
00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.620
uh uh, I mean, uh, would you like for

1061
00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:44.620
example, for people to have a better understanding or

1062
00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:49.120
perhaps being more empathetic toward people who are different

1063
00:52:49.139 --> 00:52:52.100
in terms of their sexual expression and so on?

1064
00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:54.389
Yeah, the main theme of the book is very

1065
00:52:54.389 --> 00:52:59.649
simple. Nature loves wondrous variety, right? And that's true

1066
00:52:59.649 --> 00:53:03.550
in almost every aspect of animals, whether it's morphology,

1067
00:53:03.629 --> 00:53:05.790
you know, how they look, and, but also behavior,

1068
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:09.330
gender, sex, all of that, that variety is normal,

1069
00:53:09.469 --> 00:53:13.719
it's natural, and it's often adaptive. Um, SO I

1070
00:53:13.719 --> 00:53:15.439
go out of my way to choose examples in

1071
00:53:15.439 --> 00:53:18.860
the book where the diversity of a particular animal

1072
00:53:19.159 --> 00:53:21.479
makes that animal better in a sense. It makes

1073
00:53:21.479 --> 00:53:24.080
an animal fit in in a new way, right,

1074
00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:27.639
to offer something different to the group or have

1075
00:53:27.639 --> 00:53:30.239
a benefit for themselves. So the variety that we

1076
00:53:30.239 --> 00:53:32.100
see and that I talk about in the book

1077
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.719
isn't a disadvantage. It doesn't put an animal at

1078
00:53:35.909 --> 00:53:38.520
at a disadvantage that it actually gives the animal

1079
00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:43.580
an edge. And so variety and difference, diversity. IS

1080
00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:45.860
good for us and it always has been. It's

1081
00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:47.540
always been a good thing. It's always been a

1082
00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.719
strength of the species to have a diverse population.

1083
00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:54.340
So you may fit the mold very typically for

1084
00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:57.979
your sex. You're a very masculine presenting male, attracted

1085
00:53:57.979 --> 00:54:01.780
to females, interested in monogamous kind of relationship, and

1086
00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:05.739
that's fine. The, the, the, the individuals that don't

1087
00:54:05.739 --> 00:54:07.659
fit one of those molds are no threat to

1088
00:54:07.659 --> 00:54:10.500
you. That, that's what I hope everyone sees is

1089
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.739
that even if you're not a diverse individual, that's

1090
00:54:14.739 --> 00:54:16.260
a silly thing to say, but even if you're

1091
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:17.939
not an individual that you would think of as

1092
00:54:17.939 --> 00:54:21.139
diverse, you're still in a group that's better off

1093
00:54:21.139 --> 00:54:24.739
for being diverse, right? And that diversity is not

1094
00:54:24.739 --> 00:54:27.780
a threat, um, even to those who are normies,

1095
00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:30.169
as we might say. Um, SO just learn to

1096
00:54:30.169 --> 00:54:32.850
love your neighbor and appreciate them for the beautifully

1097
00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:35.449
diverse things that they are, um, and to see

1098
00:54:35.449 --> 00:54:37.879
that we, we can look to other animals for

1099
00:54:37.879 --> 00:54:39.370
all the proof we need that this is normal,

1100
00:54:39.449 --> 00:54:42.050
natural, and indeed adaptive quite often.

1101
00:54:43.469 --> 00:54:46.270
Great. So the book is again The Sexual Evolution

1102
00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:49.550
of 500 Million Years of Sex, Gender and Mating

1103
00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:52.389
Shape Modern Relationships. I'm leaving a link to it

1104
00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:55.149
in the description of the interview. And Doctor Lentz,

1105
00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.939
just before we go, apart from the book, where

1106
00:54:57.939 --> 00:55:00.550
can people find you and your work on the

1107
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:00.790
internet?

1108
00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:04.050
Um, I am, uh, online, on social media. I'm

1109
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.080
very easy to find. Um, SO if you just

1110
00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.340
Google Nathan Lentz, I think I'm the only one

1111
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:10.820
that has, uh, um, you know, social media accounts

1112
00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:12.580
and things, and I also answer emails. To be

1113
00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:14.139
honest, I, I, I, I'm not a fan of

1114
00:55:14.139 --> 00:55:15.659
social media. I, I, I, I, I kind of

1115
00:55:15.659 --> 00:55:17.929
wish, um, that we could move beyond it, uh,

1116
00:55:17.939 --> 00:55:19.820
as a way to interact. So, if you really

1117
00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:21.580
wanna get my attention, send me an email. I'm

1118
00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:23.419
easy to find that way too, and I respond

1119
00:55:23.419 --> 00:55:28.459
to all emails that are polite. Working in the

1120
00:55:28.459 --> 00:55:31.050
space, you get some nasty emails, but, um, uh,

1121
00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:32.860
yeah, I like to interact. I love to hear

1122
00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:34.560
what people think of my work and my book,

1123
00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:37.459
and, um, uh, please reach out and I, I,

1124
00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:39.320
I'm always looking to build new relationships.

1125
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:42.189
Great. Thank you so much for taking the time

1126
00:55:42.189 --> 00:55:44.669
