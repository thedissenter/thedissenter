00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:02.930
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.699
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:05.699 --> 00:00:08.420
today I'm joined by Doctor Michael Axelrod. He's the

4
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.060
director of the Human Development Center and the professor

5
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.420
in the Department of Psychology at the University of

6
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.059
Wisconsin, Wisconsin Eau Claire. He's he's editor of Investigating

7
00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:24.180
School Psychology, Pseudoscience, Fringe Science, and controversies. And that's

8
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.250
the book we're going to talk about today. So,

9
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.690
Doctor Axelrod, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure

10
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.139
to have everyone.

11
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.829
Thank you for having me.

12
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.580
So let me start by asking you perhaps a

13
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.540
general question. So in the book, you deal with

14
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.340
school psychology. What is school psychology exactly and how

15
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.689
does it relate to other subfields in psychology, like,

16
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.240
for example, educational psychology.

17
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.869
Mhm. So, school psychology is uh an applied field

18
00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:57.020
in psychology. And so, uh, what school psychologists generally

19
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.369
do is provide Um, different types of services to

20
00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:08.019
children or students, teachers, parents, um, even, uh, uh,

21
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.449
sort of even administrative level types of services. So

22
00:01:11.449 --> 00:01:14.519
some of the services that are most common. Our,

23
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.349
uh, assessment services here in the United States, for

24
00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:22.669
example, school psychologists often lead the assessment team to

25
00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:28.629
make decisions regarding students and uh the um eligibility

26
00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:32.309
for special education services. So assessment is a rather

27
00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:35.069
large part of a school psychologist's job, but school

28
00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:40.510
psychologists also provide uh intervention. Sometimes that's direct intervention.

29
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.660
Uh, COUNSELING, maybe some behavior intervention work, but also

30
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.019
school psychologists consult with others on general issues that

31
00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:58.620
students would experience academic, behavior, developmental, social, emotional, all

32
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.620
sorts of things. So, school psychologists are often consulting

33
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.440
with teachers and administrators and parents. And then finally,

34
00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:09.130
I think, uh, a more recent role for school

35
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.800
psychologists is looking at how schools can better teach

36
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.789
and educate students, so more of a systems level,

37
00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.440
if you will, approach to um making things better

38
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.270
for kids. So that may be in the area

39
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.789
of school discipline, that may be in the area

40
00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:33.485
of um different types of Uh, uh, curricula or

41
00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:38.164
learning approaches. So school psychologists generally cover the gamut

42
00:02:38.164 --> 00:02:41.895
as far as things that may be um expected

43
00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:45.684
of, of schools to provide students. And how is

44
00:02:45.684 --> 00:02:48.804
it different, uh, to other fields or other areas

45
00:02:48.804 --> 00:02:53.309
of psychology? Well, one is it's applied. Um, IT'S,

46
00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:56.639
uh, when you get a degree in school psychology

47
00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.279
here in the United States, and I think it's

48
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.960
generally consistent around the world. When you get a

49
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.720
graduate degree in school psychology, um, you, you're usually

50
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.835
going to be working in schools, um. Um, AND

51
00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:11.104
working with kids and teachers and administrators and parents.

52
00:03:11.354 --> 00:03:15.065
Um, IT'S not necessarily a research type degree, although,

53
00:03:15.434 --> 00:03:17.475
uh, and I'm sure we'll be talking about this

54
00:03:17.475 --> 00:03:20.005
today. Research plays a really important role in terms

55
00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:23.470
of what school psychologists do. Um, THE, the real

56
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.960
neat thing about school psychologists, elite school psychology, at

57
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.759
least for me, is it really integrates just about

58
00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:34.139
every aspect of the field of psychology. So, obviously,

59
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.699
um, child psychology, adolescent psychology, developmental psychology, um, learning,

60
00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:44.445
assessment, those are Uh, those are all aspects of

61
00:03:44.445 --> 00:03:48.115
school psychology that sort of draw from other areas.

62
00:03:48.514 --> 00:03:51.125
But there are also some pretty unique areas, uh,

63
00:03:51.205 --> 00:03:54.725
learning and behavior analysis, for example, is a common

64
00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:58.684
area in psychology, psychology that that school psychologists draw

65
00:03:58.684 --> 00:04:03.085
from, uh, certainly like clinical psychology and counseling psychology.

66
00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.740
Um, SOCIAL psychology, it's not uncommon for us to

67
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.339
talk about, um, so social psychological phenomena in, in

68
00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:15.380
schools. Um, SO, as a field, it's really broad

69
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.260
and I think that's one of the, the real

70
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.589
neat things about it. You mentioned educational psychology. Um,

71
00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:25.119
IT, it, that it, so that term is often

72
00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:28.450
used, um, in, uh, places outside the United States

73
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.309
to describe essentially what school psychologists can do. Um,

74
00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:36.640
SO oftentimes you'll hear an educational psychologist is working

75
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.429
in a school in Europe, for example, and doing

76
00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:43.769
these kinds of things that I described, um. Here

77
00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:46.649
in the United States, uh, educational psychology is more

78
00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:49.540
of a research degree or a research field where

79
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.529
it's looking at how do we best use the

80
00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:55.730
principles of psychology, all of those that I've already

81
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.450
mentioned, like development and learning and social psychology, but

82
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.010
how do we use all of the, the, the

83
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.369
knowledge that we have in psychology to uh best

84
00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:08.649
educate children. And in fact, if I could put

85
00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:11.010
a plug in, we're actually in the process of

86
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.799
working on a book that's very similar to the,

87
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.410
the school psych pseudoscience book. Uh, IT'S called Educational

88
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.049
Psychology, and it's more geared toward um those that

89
00:05:21.049 --> 00:05:25.529
are going into teacher education programs, uh, and, and

90
00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:29.049
those faculty that are teaching in teacher education programs.

91
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.739
And so why do you think that such a

92
00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:37.730
book investigating school psychology and it, the pseudoscience, the

93
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.809
for science, and the controversy surrounding it was needed?

94
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.480
Yeah, that's, I think that's a really important question.

95
00:05:44.609 --> 00:05:49.929
Um, THERE, there's a lot of observational data to

96
00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:52.670
suggest that many of the practices that are happening

97
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.529
in schools, either delivered by school psychologists or even

98
00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.730
delivered by uh others in schools, uh, teachers and

99
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.100
administrators. But there's a lot of, there's a lot

100
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.420
of observational evidence to suggest that many of those

101
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.079
things aren't very effective, or they don't work right,

102
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.859
or in some cases may be harmful. Um, BUT

103
00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:16.730
there's also some empirical evidence to suggest that as

104
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.059
well. When we look at things like how to

105
00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:22.339
best teach reading. There are lots of different approaches

106
00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:25.859
to teaching children to read and the when we

107
00:06:25.859 --> 00:06:28.820
sort of look at the data behind those approaches,

108
00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:31.975
we find that some are Very effective and some

109
00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:35.614
are not effective at all. And so we kind

110
00:06:35.614 --> 00:06:37.934
of have this sense from not just uh what

111
00:06:37.934 --> 00:06:41.894
we've seen, but also what we study that there

112
00:06:41.894 --> 00:06:43.654
are a lot of things that are happening in

113
00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:47.054
schools that, again, aren't effective and actually may be

114
00:06:47.054 --> 00:06:51.489
harmful. Um, AND then, as far as school psychology

115
00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:54.299
goes, um, cause I have always thought that, you

116
00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:56.899
know, I trained as a school psychologist, you know,

117
00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:59.260
almost 30 years ago. Uh, I thought, you know,

118
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.420
school psychologists, they're the, they're, they're in, in a

119
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.690
school setting, they're, they're trained to, to use evidence

120
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.470
and, and think critically and scientifically about, about the,

121
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.959
the practices that are happening. Um, BUT a few

122
00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:15.299
years ago, we did a study here at, at

123
00:07:15.299 --> 00:07:20.369
UWL Claire where we surveyed. Um, SCHOOL psychologists around

124
00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:24.850
the state and ask them, uh, about their beliefs

125
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:30.739
regarding common myths, uh, or common practices in schools

126
00:07:30.739 --> 00:07:35.559
and, and within child and adolescent psychology. And, um,

127
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:40.559
what we found was that Most of the myths.

128
00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:44.910
School psychologists were able to identify. That was really

129
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.109
encouraging. And, and many of the, the, the, the

130
00:07:48.109 --> 00:07:51.109
statements that were true, cause we also had some

131
00:07:51.109 --> 00:07:56.670
true statements in our survey, um, reassuringly, school psychologists

132
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.859
were able to say, yeah, that I believe that

133
00:07:58.869 --> 00:08:01.950
that's true. Um, BUT there were a few, a

134
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.940
few practices, a few myths that stood out that

135
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:10.179
actually the majority of school psychologists identified as true.

136
00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:13.040
Um, AND one of them is actually in the

137
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.559
book, and that is, uh, drawings, children's drawings can,

138
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.329
uh, give us a, a, a sense of a

139
00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:25.000
child's, uh, problems and sort of the underlying causes

140
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.410
of their problems. And so, um, that's something we

141
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.079
found in our, in our research, um, and I

142
00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:32.659
actually wrote a little bit about it in our

143
00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.789
book, and we have a chapter on it. Um,

144
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.590
BUT I was really discouraged by that finding. And,

145
00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:41.320
and what was even more discouraging, I think, was

146
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.359
that the, what we found was, cause we looked

147
00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:47.200
at, uh, school psychologists that had been trained more

148
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.440
recently versus school psychologists that had been in the

149
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.440
field for, say, 20 years or more. And what

150
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.349
we found was that there was no difference in

151
00:08:56.719 --> 00:09:01.070
the two groups with regard to how many um

152
00:09:01.359 --> 00:09:05.500
uh endorsed that particular myth is true. Suggesting that

153
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.460
even like newer school psychologists, folks that are that

154
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:15.099
are being trained now are still believing in practices

155
00:09:15.099 --> 00:09:18.739
that were, were commonplace 30, 40, or 50 years

156
00:09:18.739 --> 00:09:22.799
ago. And that was somewhat discouraging. The other discouraging

157
00:09:23.109 --> 00:09:27.690
finding was that the level of education didn't matter.

158
00:09:28.169 --> 00:09:30.809
So in the United States, you can have um

159
00:09:30.809 --> 00:09:33.809
a master's degree uh in school psychology and be

160
00:09:33.809 --> 00:09:35.989
in the schools, but you can also have a,

161
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:40.239
a, a doctoral degree, a PhD degree and work

162
00:09:40.239 --> 00:09:42.369
in the schools. And so we were expecting that.

163
00:09:42.919 --> 00:09:47.710
Uh, SCHOOL psychologists with more education would less likely

164
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.239
believe those myths, in particular this one about children's

165
00:09:51.239 --> 00:09:54.080
drawings, and we did not find that. We found

166
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.849
that uh the same percent of uh people that

167
00:09:58.849 --> 00:10:02.239
either had the master's or the PhD believed in

168
00:10:02.239 --> 00:10:05.440
that particular myth. And so, I think those sorts

169
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.559
of things came out of, uh, or, or really

170
00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:11.109
were the, the set the stage for this book.

171
00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:12.840
Um, BUT I got, I've got to give a

172
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.510
lot of credit to my co-editor Steve Hop, um,

173
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:22.320
who's written a lot on pseudoscience in psychology and

174
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.469
um pseudoscience and particularly child and adolescent psychology. And

175
00:10:27.469 --> 00:10:30.750
there's, there's a movement in, in, in the applied

176
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.309
psychology fields. So that would be school psychology, clinical

177
00:10:34.309 --> 00:10:38.799
psychology, and counseling psychology to really um work on

178
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:46.070
uh removing these, these ineffective, uh, harmful pseudoscientific practices.

179
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.830
And so, I hopefully we'll be seeing more of

180
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.340
this type of work out there.

181
00:10:51.729 --> 00:10:56.059
And uh what do you think makes education susceptible

182
00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:59.539
to pseudoscience? Are there particular factors that play a

183
00:10:59.539 --> 00:11:00.340
role in that?

184
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.390
Yes, I think there are, um, That, that Jason

185
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.429
Travers is a uh uh a, a, a researcher

186
00:11:08.429 --> 00:11:11.469
here in the United States and he's, he's referred,

187
00:11:11.549 --> 00:11:14.190
and, and others have done have referred to have

188
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.510
used this term as well, but he's referred to

189
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.330
uh education as a fad magnet. Uh, FOR pseudoscientific

190
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:27.640
practices. So that, uh, schools and educators are maybe

191
00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.400
more susceptible than other professionals to, uh, believing in

192
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.239
nonsense, if you will, or engaging in pseudo-scientific practices.

193
00:11:36.969 --> 00:11:40.179
And I think there's maybe two reasons behind that.

194
00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:43.380
I, and, and they're, they're very, um, you know,

195
00:11:43.609 --> 00:11:45.650
the, the people's hearts are in the right place.

196
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.030
Don't get me wrong. I don't want to vilify

197
00:11:48.489 --> 00:11:51.590
the, the educators that may be uh uh engaging

198
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.539
in pseudo-scientific practices because I, again, I think their

199
00:11:54.539 --> 00:11:56.729
hearts are in the right place. I think the,

200
00:11:56.739 --> 00:12:00.820
the first, uh, potential reason is that people are

201
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:06.719
looking for, um, approaches that work. And so they,

202
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.440
they're willing to try anything sometimes. And we find

203
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.659
that, for example, in uh in the, the area

204
00:12:13.659 --> 00:12:16.260
of autism. So, you know, working with children in

205
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.489
autism, with autism is very challenging. It's a very

206
00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:24.960
challenging uh proposition, um. Working with kids with autism,

207
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.320
there, there's no overnight fix, of course, and in

208
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.710
fact, there's no fix. It's really just teaching kids

209
00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:36.679
skills and, and managing their social emotional behavior. Um,

210
00:12:37.119 --> 00:12:41.260
BUT the field of autism is just, um, Proliferated

211
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.340
with these pseudoscientific practices. And so, again, what I

212
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.969
think it is is it's, it's parents and, and,

213
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.580
and school psychologists and educators and other psychologists that

214
00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.729
are really just, they want to help. And unfortunately,

215
00:12:56.739 --> 00:13:00.900
sometimes the help that they are giving isn't the

216
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.859
help that's needed. So I think that's the first

217
00:13:02.859 --> 00:13:07.599
reason. The second reason is there's just this antiquated

218
00:13:07.599 --> 00:13:11.039
ways of thinking. Um, THAT we've, we've been doing

219
00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:13.909
this forever and we're gonna continue to do this.

220
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.369
Um, THE, the, the, the first, uh, the first,

221
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.010
or I should say the second chapter in the

222
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.979
book is historical pseudoscience in school of psychology and

223
00:13:23.979 --> 00:13:26.729
education and, and we talk about things like Dunn's

224
00:13:26.729 --> 00:13:29.890
caps that That that goes back to, you know,

225
00:13:30.049 --> 00:13:33.119
the, the, the Renaissance, when you look at like,

226
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:37.409
where Duns caps came from, and, yeah, OK, we

227
00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:41.210
don't use Duns caps in schools today, but we

228
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:45.929
still shame children. And we still use those kinds

229
00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:52.239
of approaches to manage behavior, and shaming kids, uh,

230
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:56.840
particularly publicly is not only ineffective, it's also quite

231
00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.729
harmful. So I think there's this like, this, this

232
00:14:00.729 --> 00:14:05.669
historical or this, we've always done it. Kind of

233
00:14:05.669 --> 00:14:10.960
thinking that happens in schools, and things don't necessarily

234
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.659
change quickly sometimes.

235
00:14:14.099 --> 00:14:16.390
And in the book, you also talk about some

236
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:20.349
cognitive errors and fallacies that are relevant to school

237
00:14:20.349 --> 00:14:23.109
psychology. Would you like to tell us perhaps about

238
00:14:23.109 --> 00:14:25.750
one or two of them just to illustrate what

239
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.859
you're talking about here?

240
00:14:27.809 --> 00:14:30.169
Right, right. So there's, there's a whole host of

241
00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:33.690
these sort of cognitive errors that we make as

242
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:38.250
humans. Um, THERE are also heuristics or shortcuts that

243
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.010
we, we have as humans in our thinking that

244
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:45.369
lead us into um potentially believing things that we,

245
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.969
we shouldn't believe in. Um, BUT, but specific to

246
00:14:48.969 --> 00:14:52.849
like psychology or school psychology or the practice of

247
00:14:52.849 --> 00:14:56.900
psychology in education. Um, THERE'S a few that stand

248
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.580
out, and I'll highlight 21 is this, this what

249
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:06.369
we call diagnostic overshadowing, and that's where we interpret

250
00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:11.619
presenting problems based only on previous diagnoses. So, for

251
00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:14.309
example, if we're working with a kid with attention

252
00:15:14.309 --> 00:15:18.700
deficit hyperactivity disorder and we see uh a new

253
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:24.005
behavior emerge, Don't investigate it further on its own.

254
00:15:24.135 --> 00:15:26.534
We just sort of say, well, that's probably because

255
00:15:26.534 --> 00:15:30.505
the child has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. So, we

256
00:15:30.505 --> 00:15:35.255
almost like close ourselves off to understanding something in

257
00:15:35.255 --> 00:15:38.164
potentially a whole new way. So that's one aspect

258
00:15:38.164 --> 00:15:42.549
of diagnostic overshadowing. The other is, um, failing to

259
00:15:42.549 --> 00:15:47.880
interpret like other potential causes. And so, uh, very

260
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.789
similarly, if we sort of think about a kid

261
00:15:49.789 --> 00:15:54.080
with ADHD who may be um engaging in, um,

262
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:58.070
lots of avoidant behavior, uh, we, we quickly go

263
00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.950
to say, well, that's because the kid has ADHD

264
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.469
when in fact, well, we also know that avoidant

265
00:16:03.469 --> 00:16:07.390
behavior is common for kids that have anxiety. And

266
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:12.270
so, if we aren't open to these other possibilities,

267
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.000
I think we can, we can be really, um,

268
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.510
our, our, our assessment and our interpretation could, could

269
00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.010
have lots of shortcomings. The other one that I

270
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.849
think is really important is what we call pathology

271
00:16:24.849 --> 00:16:29.659
bias, and that's where we, there's a tendency to

272
00:16:29.929 --> 00:16:35.250
um over pathologize or, or even just pathologize relatively

273
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.270
common problems. And a really good example of that

274
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.169
is this idea of the terrible twos. I don't

275
00:16:42.169 --> 00:16:44.609
know if you've ever heard that term, the terrible

276
00:16:44.609 --> 00:16:49.919
twos. So, um, toddlers, 2 year olds are sometimes,

277
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:55.219
um, Difficult to to manage. Um, PARENTS, um, have,

278
00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.000
have used the term, the terrible twos to describe

279
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.799
these two year old kids that as they begin

280
00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:05.520
to develop language, some of the words they use,

281
00:17:05.729 --> 00:17:10.469
um, don't always meet with The cooperation standards that

282
00:17:10.469 --> 00:17:12.630
a parent may have. So they, they, you know,

283
00:17:12.989 --> 00:17:15.108
at about 1, between 1 and 2 years of

284
00:17:15.108 --> 00:17:19.069
age, the child learns the word no and they

285
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:22.868
learn the impact of the word no on their

286
00:17:22.868 --> 00:17:26.930
parents and the environment. So if the child has

287
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.650
a slice of cheese and, and is looking at

288
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.650
the parent and the parent says, you know, you

289
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:38.160
can't have that. The child says no and needs

290
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.349
it. Um. The, so there's this idea though that

291
00:17:42.359 --> 00:17:45.239
that there's some pathology behind that, that these are

292
00:17:45.239 --> 00:17:49.359
children that are on a trajectory that may uh

293
00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:52.829
lead to uh more significant behavior problems. And actually,

294
00:17:52.839 --> 00:17:55.319
what we find is that as I'm explaining this,

295
00:17:55.369 --> 00:17:57.750
you're probably seeing that this is a very common

296
00:17:58.079 --> 00:18:01.239
problem. Um, I'm not excusing the problem and there's

297
00:18:01.239 --> 00:18:03.333
ways. That parents can work with their 2 year

298
00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:07.322
olds and 3-year-olds to help them become more compliant,

299
00:18:07.613 --> 00:18:11.483
but to suggest, for example, that that behavior is

300
00:18:11.483 --> 00:18:17.203
indicative of a larger psychological problem is problematic. Um,

301
00:18:17.373 --> 00:18:19.733
THE other one that, that stands out in as

302
00:18:19.733 --> 00:18:22.363
a psychologist, one of the areas that I work

303
00:18:22.363 --> 00:18:26.115
in uh in Closely, uh, is, um, bed wetting.

304
00:18:26.345 --> 00:18:28.306
I work with a lot of children that wet

305
00:18:28.306 --> 00:18:30.426
the bed. I do a lot of research on

306
00:18:30.426 --> 00:18:32.985
that area. And that is a, it's a very

307
00:18:32.985 --> 00:18:35.306
common problem. If you look at in the United

308
00:18:35.306 --> 00:18:38.745
States, if you look at first grade students, so

309
00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:41.995
you look at, uh, 6 year olds, um, roughly

310
00:18:41.995 --> 00:18:44.306
25% of all boys will wet the bed at

311
00:18:44.306 --> 00:18:47.546
least 2 nights a week. Um, SO, so hardly,

312
00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:51.926
uh, uh, a unique problem, hardly a rare problem.

313
00:18:52.225 --> 00:18:55.380
Um, Yet, we, we look at bed wetting in,

314
00:18:55.699 --> 00:18:57.300
at least in our country here in the United

315
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.319
States, and we think, well, there's gotta be something

316
00:18:59.319 --> 00:19:02.660
wrong with the child. There's something psychologically wrong with

317
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.260
the child. Who would wanna wet their bed every

318
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.729
night, almost like they're doing it on purpose. And

319
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.270
And what's happened is that they're, you know, going

320
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.869
way, way back, uh, to even Freud, there are

321
00:19:14.869 --> 00:19:19.589
these very misleading interpretations of what, um, bed wetting

322
00:19:19.589 --> 00:19:23.430
is about. And one interpretation is that it's the

323
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.229
child trying to get back at the parent for

324
00:19:26.229 --> 00:19:30.650
harsh toilet training practices. Um, NO evidence of that

325
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:35.280
whatsoever. In fact, bed wetting is cause, it can

326
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.160
be caused, and this is rare, it could be

327
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.359
caused by um uh uh like a urinary tract

328
00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:43.420
infection. But really, what bedwetting is, is it's an

329
00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.439
immature set of muscles that surround the bladder. And

330
00:19:47.439 --> 00:19:50.640
so at night, those muscles aren't as strong as

331
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.160
the muscles of the, of peers who don't wet

332
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.310
the bed and so they relax enough that then

333
00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:01.520
the child um urinates uh when they're sleeping. Um,

334
00:20:02.089 --> 00:20:05.469
But we've over pathologized that. We've, we've, we've taken

335
00:20:05.469 --> 00:20:07.599
a, we've taken a problem that has a, uh,

336
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:14.130
uh, a physiological cause and we've created this. Psychological

337
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:17.329
cause that has no um no support in the

338
00:20:17.329 --> 00:20:20.930
empirical research. So, uh, that's the pathology bias, and

339
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.560
we see that a lot in schools as well.

340
00:20:22.729 --> 00:20:26.170
The examples I gave aren't necessarily, uh, school-based, but

341
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.839
we see that a lot in schools where, um,

342
00:20:28.849 --> 00:20:34.290
for example, it's not uncommon for uh kids uh

343
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.645
when they're learning to To write and read, to,

344
00:20:37.735 --> 00:20:41.855
um, mix B's and D's and P's and Q's.

345
00:20:41.975 --> 00:20:45.906
Um, THEY look so similar. Um, YET we've, we've

346
00:20:45.906 --> 00:20:48.375
gone off the rails there, and, and some people

347
00:20:48.375 --> 00:20:51.276
would suggest, well, then that child has some type

348
00:20:51.276 --> 00:20:55.015
of, uh, learning disability, when in fact, it's actually

349
00:20:55.015 --> 00:20:57.982
quite common for children under the age Under the

350
00:20:57.982 --> 00:21:00.131
age of about 10 or 11 to do that.

351
00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:03.182
In fact, it's not uncommon for people to do

352
00:21:03.182 --> 00:21:06.261
that even up into adulthood, where they are maybe

353
00:21:06.261 --> 00:21:08.781
thinking about something else and trying to write, and,

354
00:21:08.991 --> 00:21:11.102
and they maybe mix up their Ps and Q's

355
00:21:11.102 --> 00:21:13.541
and B's and D's. So, um, those are just

356
00:21:13.541 --> 00:21:16.661
two, I think that are pretty common, uh, at

357
00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:19.102
least in the practice of school psychology and clinical

358
00:21:19.102 --> 00:21:19.802
psychology.

359
00:21:20.339 --> 00:21:25.089
Right. So earlier you referenced the historical example of

360
00:21:25.089 --> 00:21:28.329
pseudoscience, the then SES. Let me just ask you

361
00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:30.810
about two more. So, can you tell us about

362
00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.260
the example of open classrooms? Yeah.

363
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.449
So, um, in the, I, I, I laugh at

364
00:21:37.449 --> 00:21:41.160
this because, um, I, I grew up in, um,

365
00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.609
outside of New York City, on the east coast

366
00:21:44.609 --> 00:21:48.540
of the United States, and um, I, I went

367
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.060
to a school that had, um, no, the classrooms

368
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.660
had no walls. Uh, THEY, they, the walls they

369
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.660
had actually were bookcases. Um, AND, and what's interesting

370
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.420
is the, the person who wrote that particular chapter

371
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.140
for us, Scott Bellini, he grew up in, in

372
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.030
Southern California, just, just near Los Angeles. And the

373
00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.750
school that he went to was the exact same

374
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.829
way, and we're the same age. We're, we're exactly

375
00:22:12.829 --> 00:22:15.869
the same age. And so, um, I just found

376
00:22:15.869 --> 00:22:18.310
that interesting cause I had thought, well, maybe this

377
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:21.270
is something that's very specific to certain parts of

378
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.989
the country, but no, it's not. It, it, it

379
00:22:23.989 --> 00:22:26.349
happened like all over the country, and it came

380
00:22:26.349 --> 00:22:29.994
from The idea that we should allow kids to

381
00:22:29.994 --> 00:22:34.435
sort of um learn based on just exploring their

382
00:22:34.435 --> 00:22:38.364
environment. And that if we put walls up in

383
00:22:38.364 --> 00:22:42.685
schools, that limits the environment. Um, AND it, it

384
00:22:42.685 --> 00:22:46.185
was, it was solely based on that, that theory.

385
00:22:46.555 --> 00:22:50.594
The theory had never been empirically supported, um, and

386
00:22:50.594 --> 00:22:54.155
in fact, the idea of open classrooms had never

387
00:22:54.155 --> 00:22:58.130
been studied. So nobody had ever done the research

388
00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.359
to say, well, yeah, open classrooms are actually more

389
00:23:01.359 --> 00:23:06.229
effective at at having kids achieve compared to traditional

390
00:23:06.229 --> 00:23:09.890
classrooms with walls. Um, BUT, you know, that this

391
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.290
is a great example of how, you know, an

392
00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.530
idea takes off and then, you know, things go

393
00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:19.400
crazy pretty quickly. And what happened was, schools, uh,

394
00:23:19.739 --> 00:23:22.420
Uh, this, this happened, it started about the the

395
00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.180
mid 1970s, and a lot of schools that had

396
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:29.170
been built before World War II were being demolished

397
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.380
in, in favor of new school buildings. Um, AND

398
00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.819
so what we saw was these new school buildings

399
00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:38.540
that were being built, were being built with this

400
00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:43.050
open classroom concept or, or, or classrooms without walls.

401
00:23:43.099 --> 00:23:46.040
And as I illustrated before, it was happening on

402
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.380
the West Coast and the east coast, and everywhere

403
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.500
in between. Um, WHAT actually ended up happening is

404
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:58.500
that naturally, teachers complained. Um, THE, the biggest complaint,

405
00:23:58.619 --> 00:24:01.930
there were two huge complaints. The biggest one was

406
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.380
the noise. They just, there was so much noise

407
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.579
that you couldn't, um, you couldn't really get, get

408
00:24:09.579 --> 00:24:12.479
the attention of the kids and teach. And the

409
00:24:12.479 --> 00:24:15.280
second complaint was that teachers didn't know where their

410
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.800
kids were. They were, so yeah, they're looking for

411
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.630
a kid, uh, maybe it's time to, to go

412
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.520
to the cafeteria for lunch and you're, you're lining

413
00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.040
your kids up, and there are 4 or 5

414
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.880
of them that are somewhere else. And they're in

415
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.560
this huge space, uh, but across the space. And

416
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.319
so teachers found this was a problem. What schools

417
00:24:35.319 --> 00:24:38.680
did was they uh first started putting these, as

418
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.349
I said earlier, bookcases to separate the different schools

419
00:24:42.349 --> 00:24:45.000
and the uh different classrooms, and then they were

420
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.280
getting, after that, they found that that wasn't very

421
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.170
helpful. So then they invested in um uh. Uh,

422
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.949
TEMPORARY partitions that they would put up, and then

423
00:24:55.949 --> 00:24:59.550
finally today, they've, they've had to do some major

424
00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.670
remodeling of those schools, or, or, or scrap them

425
00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:06.150
all together and build schools that actually had some

426
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.640
walls in the classrooms. So there's the open classroom

427
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.310
concept.

428
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.369
And what about the self-esteem movement? How did it

429
00:25:15.369 --> 00:25:17.630
impact uh school psychology?

430
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.569
Yeah, so the self-esteem movement's really interesting. It, it

431
00:25:21.569 --> 00:25:26.329
came from some researchers in the 70s that had

432
00:25:26.329 --> 00:25:31.199
found that um the self-esteem of children. Was it

433
00:25:31.199 --> 00:25:33.800
was kind of an important thing, kind of an

434
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:39.719
important concept. Interestingly enough, that the definition of self-esteem

435
00:25:39.719 --> 00:25:43.199
has never really been clarified in, in, you know,

436
00:25:43.359 --> 00:25:47.359
40, 50 years. Um THE way these researchers in

437
00:25:47.359 --> 00:25:50.760
the 70s thought of the, the idea of self-esteem

438
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.979
was, do you feel good about yourself? Um And

439
00:25:54.979 --> 00:25:58.050
so they found they, they hypothesized that if we

440
00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.329
have kids, we have children, students that are feeling

441
00:26:01.619 --> 00:26:05.300
good about themselves, then they're more likely to do

442
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.739
better in school. And again, there was no evidence

443
00:26:08.739 --> 00:26:13.969
of that whatsoever. Um So what happened was the

444
00:26:13.979 --> 00:26:16.180
the there was this self-esteem movement. Now, some of

445
00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.819
it also came out of the, the sort of

446
00:26:18.819 --> 00:26:23.430
self-help. Um MOVEMENT that was like the late 60s

447
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:27.589
and early 70s where adults who were sort of

448
00:26:27.589 --> 00:26:31.750
feeling the pressures of everyday life, um, you know,

449
00:26:31.869 --> 00:26:34.150
the, the, the advice to them was, you know,

450
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:38.310
really work on yourself and become, you know, uh

451
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.869
the best person you can be and, and feel

452
00:26:40.869 --> 00:26:43.150
good about yourself. And so there was some of

453
00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:47.510
that influence as well. Um, WHAT happened was that,

454
00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:53.660
that, uh, schools and school districts and states caught

455
00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.050
sort of wind of this idea that if we,

456
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.989
if we just boost kids' self-esteem, will impact their

457
00:26:59.989 --> 00:27:04.510
learning. In fact, the state of California spent millions

458
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:08.489
of dollars in the 70s to revamp their curricula

459
00:27:08.709 --> 00:27:14.609
to include self-esteem programming. And uh the, and now

460
00:27:14.609 --> 00:27:16.630
that we were, we were seeing that schools were

461
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:20.569
adopting these sort of self-esteem programs, we were able

462
00:27:20.569 --> 00:27:24.959
to look at the relationship between self-esteem and student

463
00:27:24.959 --> 00:27:27.969
achievement. And we, we found that either there was

464
00:27:27.969 --> 00:27:31.689
no relationship, um, or that there was a negative

465
00:27:31.689 --> 00:27:35.359
relationship. So that as kids' self-esteem was going up,

466
00:27:35.489 --> 00:27:40.150
their academic achievement was going down. Um, THE intended

467
00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:43.770
purpose of the self-esteem movement, at least in schools.

468
00:27:44.099 --> 00:27:47.260
The other thing that that we learned was that

469
00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.290
when we started to look at different groups of

470
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:53.890
people, um, different groups of, of kids and adolescents

471
00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:58.050
that had high self-esteem, we learned that the, the,

472
00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.219
the kids who had high self-esteem. We're not the

473
00:28:01.219 --> 00:28:04.140
kids we wanted others to be like. So, for

474
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:09.500
example, kids that were gang members, they were reportedly

475
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:14.060
had the highest levels of self-esteem, whereas then kids

476
00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:18.579
that were in um uh music and art, extracurricular

477
00:28:18.579 --> 00:28:23.380
activities, they tended to have the lowest self-esteem, um.

478
00:28:23.709 --> 00:28:26.520
But again, the, the definition of self-esteem was never

479
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.680
really um settled on. So, you know, how we

480
00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.829
even interpret that is, is up for grabs.

481
00:28:33.989 --> 00:28:37.750
Right, so that is about historical examples. Let's now

482
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.989
go through some of the domains, let's say that

483
00:28:40.989 --> 00:28:43.310
you cover in the book with your co-authors that

484
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:48.939
are more contemporary. So what are zero tolerance policies

485
00:28:48.939 --> 00:28:50.219
and do they work?

486
00:28:50.469 --> 00:28:54.380
Mhm. So zero tolerance policies are, there's different ways

487
00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.579
to sort of look at zero tolerance policies, at

488
00:28:56.579 --> 00:28:59.290
least in the United States. We're starting to see

489
00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:03.219
uh zero tolerance policies pop up in other parts

490
00:29:03.219 --> 00:29:05.180
of the world. In fact, I was at a

491
00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.699
conference this summer in Latvia and uh there was

492
00:29:08.699 --> 00:29:11.969
some researchers talking about Zero tolerance policies. And so,

493
00:29:11.979 --> 00:29:17.099
essentially what zero tolerance policies are, are, um, school-wide

494
00:29:17.099 --> 00:29:22.650
discipline approaches where, um, if you, if you violate

495
00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:26.979
the, the, the school discipline policy once, you're, you're

496
00:29:26.979 --> 00:29:31.339
done, that you're, you're suspended. Um, SO there's zero

497
00:29:31.339 --> 00:29:36.119
tolerance for misbehavior. Now, uh, you know, in, in

498
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:41.540
In theory, that there's some good ideas there that

499
00:29:41.619 --> 00:29:46.390
that kids that may be dangerous um in a

500
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:51.910
school environment or kids that repeatedly violate school rules,

501
00:29:52.189 --> 00:29:54.239
that may not be the best setting for them.

502
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.510
And so they're, they're in the United States, we

503
00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.640
have alternatives. Schools, or if a, a, a student

504
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.349
has some significant psychiatric problems, you know, then there's,

505
00:30:03.609 --> 00:30:07.010
um, residential programming for those kids. So, again, in

506
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.449
theory, this kind of makes sense. And again, I,

507
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.119
I don't know if I would say we'd want

508
00:30:11.119 --> 00:30:14.079
to expel the child. We would just wanna look

509
00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:18.859
for alternative placements for those kids. Um, Where the,

510
00:30:18.939 --> 00:30:21.800
where the zero tolerance goes off the rails is

511
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.839
when we have a blanket statement or a blanket

512
00:30:25.839 --> 00:30:30.000
um rule for everybody that if you engage in

513
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.760
these behaviors, you're out of the school. And so

514
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.609
there's just lots of these examples um where this,

515
00:30:36.719 --> 00:30:41.709
where zero tolerance policies are almost Um, ridiculed. So,

516
00:30:41.989 --> 00:30:45.790
for example, a student brought, there's an example of

517
00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:49.469
a student, uh, a first grader, um, brought a

518
00:30:49.469 --> 00:30:54.989
butter knife to school to, um, to butter something

519
00:30:54.989 --> 00:30:56.910
or to put cream cheese on a bagel. I

520
00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:01.810
don't remember the exact specifics. Um. And was, and

521
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:06.010
had no history of disciplinary problems before this, but

522
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:08.369
because the, the student, the first grader, brought a

523
00:31:08.369 --> 00:31:13.079
little butter knife to school, he was expelled. Um,

524
00:31:13.969 --> 00:31:17.680
THERE'S another example of, um, a, a, a child,

525
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:21.680
a young student, first, 2nd grader, who was, uh,

526
00:31:21.689 --> 00:31:25.050
using a pen or pencil as a play gun,

527
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.209
you know, so, cho choo choo che, like that

528
00:31:27.209 --> 00:31:31.229
kind of thing. Um, AND that kid was expelled

529
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.719
for that behavior. Now, I'm not suggesting that was

530
00:31:33.719 --> 00:31:37.239
an appropriate behavior, but I would argue that expelling

531
00:31:37.239 --> 00:31:41.130
that child for that behavior is probably extreme. Um,

532
00:31:41.239 --> 00:31:43.099
WHAT we find in terms of the research is

533
00:31:43.099 --> 00:31:45.380
really a couple of things. The first is that

534
00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:50.219
zero tolerance policies don't reduce problems in schools. I

535
00:31:50.219 --> 00:31:53.010
think that's the most important. I think the second

536
00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:56.099
most important aspect is that they, that zero tolerance

537
00:31:56.099 --> 00:32:03.069
policies um affect students disproportionately, meaning students of color

538
00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:08.020
tend to um be affected by zero tolerance policies

539
00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.459
more so than white students, and that's a problem.

540
00:32:11.839 --> 00:32:14.969
And then the third issue is that schools that

541
00:32:14.969 --> 00:32:21.479
have rather extreme zero tolerance policies also have poor

542
00:32:21.969 --> 00:32:27.329
school climates and cultures, meaning students, when there's a

543
00:32:27.329 --> 00:32:31.239
hot, when there's really extreme zero tolerance policies, students,

544
00:32:31.329 --> 00:32:33.250
students don't feel good about their school.

545
00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:38.229
Right. So now to get into a more delicate

546
00:32:38.229 --> 00:32:42.310
subject, uh, suicide is one of the leading causes

547
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:46.270
of death among teens. So what are the most

548
00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:49.869
common misconceptions about it and that would apply to

549
00:32:49.869 --> 00:32:53.709
a school context and in this particular cases do

550
00:32:53.709 --> 00:32:56.420
prevention programs work or not?

551
00:32:57.239 --> 00:33:00.119
Yeah, that's good. I think the, the biggest myth

552
00:33:00.119 --> 00:33:05.400
that I see schools uh and school personnel perpetuate

553
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.550
is the idea that talking about suicide will cause

554
00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:12.760
suicide. Um, AND so what that leads to in

555
00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.989
practice is we're just not gonna talk about it,

556
00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:21.199
um, when in fact, kids have questions, um, younger

557
00:33:21.199 --> 00:33:24.900
students have questions about what is it. Uh, OLDER

558
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.810
students oftentimes have questions about, um, you know, the,

559
00:33:28.859 --> 00:33:32.459
the, the, the services or, or, or, or programs

560
00:33:32.459 --> 00:33:35.489
that might be available for kids that are, um,

561
00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.099
thinking about suicide. So for, for me anyway, I

562
00:33:39.099 --> 00:33:42.500
think the, the, the biggest misconception in schools is

563
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.939
the idea that if you talk about suicide, it'll

564
00:33:44.939 --> 00:33:48.109
cause suicide, and there's no evidence of that whatsoever.

565
00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.839
Um, THE other piece, and it gets to your,

566
00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.189
your question about prevention and thinking about intervention, um,

567
00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:01.449
Generally speaking, universal suicide prevention programs are not effective.

568
00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.140
So when we sort of look at the programs

569
00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.859
that exist, uh, that are, that are delivered to

570
00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:10.860
all students, uh, what we find is that, that

571
00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:15.225
they, they're just not enough. To, um, decrease the

572
00:34:15.225 --> 00:34:19.514
rates of suicide among, among kids and adolescents. Um,

573
00:34:19.764 --> 00:34:22.205
AND when you think about that, that, that might

574
00:34:22.205 --> 00:34:26.675
not be that surprising because you're, you're targeting a

575
00:34:26.675 --> 00:34:31.114
large group of kids, many of whom have no

576
00:34:31.114 --> 00:34:35.004
issues with suicide whatsoever. Um, AND you're not doing

577
00:34:35.004 --> 00:34:38.774
enough perhaps for those kids that may be um

578
00:34:38.774 --> 00:34:42.978
at risk for suicide. And so, what's recommended in

579
00:34:42.978 --> 00:34:46.139
schools is a um is a couple of things.

580
00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:51.620
One is maybe not necessarily a universal suicide prevention

581
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:56.610
program, but rather a universal meaning delivered to everybody,

582
00:34:56.978 --> 00:35:03.459
um, social emotional learning program. So focusing on skills

583
00:35:03.459 --> 00:35:09.969
like resiliency, friendship. Um, MANAGING your emotions when you're

584
00:35:09.969 --> 00:35:13.409
angry or upset or frustrated, or disappointed or sad.

585
00:35:13.449 --> 00:35:17.129
So, something of that nature, that's not focused just

586
00:35:17.129 --> 00:35:21.330
on suicide, um, in fact, doesn't emphasize suicide in

587
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:24.050
the, in the programming, but rather, you know, how

588
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.080
do you, how do you become a resilient person

589
00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.459
and how do you ask for help and how

590
00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:32.750
do you develop positive relationships with, with peers and

591
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.959
How do you manage those emotions when they're really

592
00:35:35.959 --> 00:35:39.000
intense? Um, AND what we find is actually those

593
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.959
programs are quite effective, uh, for kids, and, and

594
00:35:41.959 --> 00:35:44.679
I'm saying delivered universally, so they're delivered to all

595
00:35:44.679 --> 00:35:48.229
kids. Um, SO I, I would advocate for that

596
00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:52.909
coupled with a really good screening program to, to

597
00:35:52.909 --> 00:35:55.949
be able to identify kids who are at risk

598
00:35:55.949 --> 00:36:00.580
for suicide and then funnel them to programs, uh,

599
00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.909
or services that we know are effective. And a

600
00:36:02.909 --> 00:36:05.189
lot of times those are gonna be more in

601
00:36:05.189 --> 00:36:10.620
the category of individual therapy or maybe even inpatient

602
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:14.379
hospitalization, for example, but The point is we need

603
00:36:14.379 --> 00:36:17.850
to have uh uh screening practices that are able

604
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.889
to identify those kids as early as possible. And

605
00:36:20.889 --> 00:36:24.010
we're starting to get better at, um, not just

606
00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:28.209
the implementation of those screening programs, but just finding

607
00:36:28.209 --> 00:36:31.679
screening programs that are, that are um effective at

608
00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:35.120
identifying those kids that, that need to be identified.

609
00:36:36.179 --> 00:36:39.820
And what about other less extreme risk behaviors like

610
00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:44.139
for example, alcohol use, tobacco use, uh risky sex

611
00:36:44.139 --> 00:36:48.709
behaviors, and the prevention practices associated with them. Uh,

612
00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.330
WHAT are some of the main problems with that?

613
00:36:51.949 --> 00:36:55.389
Right, right. So I think that that's again something

614
00:36:55.389 --> 00:36:58.659
that what we've found is that there are these,

615
00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:02.750
these programs that exist in these, uh, well, there's

616
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:04.959
two, there's 22 sort of examples here that I'll

617
00:37:04.959 --> 00:37:08.820
provide. The first is, um, programs that have been

618
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:13.229
in place for a long time and nobody's willing

619
00:37:13.229 --> 00:37:15.830
to really take a deep dive into the data

620
00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:19.709
and, and make decisions about whether the these programs

621
00:37:19.709 --> 00:37:22.540
are effective or not. Here in the United States,

622
00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.879
there's a program called DARE, and it's a drug

623
00:37:25.879 --> 00:37:31.080
and alcohol prevention program. It was designed um to

624
00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.760
be delivered by law enforcement officers, which may be

625
00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.560
the, like the first part of where it went

626
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:42.370
wrong, um. Uh, AND it was really a program

627
00:37:42.379 --> 00:37:45.409
designed to do two things. One is, um, teach

628
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.179
the, the, the, some of the negative, uh, effects

629
00:37:49.179 --> 00:37:53.409
of drugs and alcohol, particularly, um, long-term use or,

630
00:37:53.419 --> 00:37:57.659
or abuse. Uh, SO, so like teaching the, the

631
00:37:57.659 --> 00:38:01.669
long-term negative impacts, and then And this may sound

632
00:38:01.669 --> 00:38:03.919
silly to people who don't, who aren't from the

633
00:38:03.919 --> 00:38:07.199
United States or don't know dare, but encourage kids

634
00:38:07.199 --> 00:38:09.600
to just say no. And in fact, that was

635
00:38:09.929 --> 00:38:13.479
Nancy Reagan, Ronald Reagan's wife, President Reagan's wife in

636
00:38:13.479 --> 00:38:16.399
the 80s. That was her big thing. Her campaign

637
00:38:16.399 --> 00:38:19.189
was just say no. So it was these two

638
00:38:19.189 --> 00:38:21.909
parts. One is like, OK, here's the all the

639
00:38:21.909 --> 00:38:25.469
negative effects of drugs and alcohol, and then because

640
00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:27.899
of those negative effects, you should just say no.

641
00:38:28.229 --> 00:38:31.060
Um AND it was implemented starting in the, in

642
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.949
the um in the 80s. Um I was, I'm

643
00:38:33.949 --> 00:38:35.629
a little too old to have gone through a

644
00:38:35.629 --> 00:38:39.080
DARE program. Um, AS a kid myself, but I've

645
00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.800
seen the DARE program being implemented. Um, WHAT we

646
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.000
found in, in the research was that it just

647
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.719
wasn't very effective. Um, IN fact, what it actually

648
00:38:48.719 --> 00:38:52.000
did was when we did pre-post tests, we found

649
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.280
that use actually increased slightly after the delivery of

650
00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.219
a DARE program. Uh, WHY did it persist? Well,

651
00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:05.540
some suggest maybe there was some political pressure. This

652
00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:11.729
is being rolled out by law enforcement. Um, 111,

653
00:39:12.899 --> 00:39:16.409
idea is that nobody really rigorously evaluate. IT, and

654
00:39:16.409 --> 00:39:19.939
so all of the evidence was anecdotal, like, oh

655
00:39:19.939 --> 00:39:22.969
yeah, I think it works. Like administ principals, school

656
00:39:22.969 --> 00:39:25.929
principals saying, oh yeah, I think it works, when,

657
00:39:26.129 --> 00:39:28.679
when in fact, there was no like rigorous evaluation

658
00:39:28.679 --> 00:39:30.530
of whether it worked or not. So that's like

659
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:34.540
one example, the DARE program. Um, THE other one

660
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:39.629
is, uh, the, the use of infant simulator dolls

661
00:39:39.629 --> 00:39:42.550
in like sex education. Uh, I don't know if

662
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:45.110
they have that in, in Europe or around the

663
00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:50.469
world, but essentially, it's a mechanical doll that um

664
00:39:50.469 --> 00:39:53.419
is supposed to imitate what it's like to have

665
00:39:53.419 --> 00:39:57.196
to care for an infant. So, Um, at certain

666
00:39:57.196 --> 00:39:59.075
times of the day, it's all, it's, you know,

667
00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:02.996
all electronic and now with our high tech technology,

668
00:40:03.035 --> 00:40:07.025
it's even um more, um, incredible what they do,

669
00:40:07.035 --> 00:40:09.666
but at certain times of the day, the, the,

670
00:40:09.676 --> 00:40:13.115
in the simulator doll will cry, um, at certain

671
00:40:13.115 --> 00:40:15.595
times of the day, the infants, uh, and so

672
00:40:15.595 --> 00:40:17.676
the, the, the students, so these are given to

673
00:40:17.676 --> 00:40:20.402
high school. Students. And so the student then needs

674
00:40:20.402 --> 00:40:22.882
to sort of see, OK, is the, do I

675
00:40:22.882 --> 00:40:25.221
need to change the diaper? Is it time for

676
00:40:25.221 --> 00:40:28.961
feeding? And so, uh, kids are given these teenagers,

677
00:40:29.162 --> 00:40:30.961
uh, in the United States are given these infant

678
00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:35.572
simulator dolls, and they are, um, they're supposed to

679
00:40:35.572 --> 00:40:38.602
have them with them almost, uh, you know, all

680
00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:42.122
the time for, uh, some amount of weeks. Um.

681
00:40:43.139 --> 00:40:47.169
The the idea is, I think, in theory is

682
00:40:47.169 --> 00:40:49.929
actually not bad. Like, OK, this is what it's

683
00:40:49.929 --> 00:40:53.489
like to actually have a, a baby. It's and

684
00:40:53.489 --> 00:40:55.889
it's not easy, and you can't always give the

685
00:40:55.889 --> 00:40:59.040
baby to, you know, your parent to care for

686
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.179
her cause they are doing that. And then actually,

687
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.479
you'd have a lot of schools would have the,

688
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.820
these high school kids carry these these infant dolls

689
00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.659
around with them at school. Um, AND then what

690
00:41:10.659 --> 00:41:12.179
do you do if you play a sport and

691
00:41:12.179 --> 00:41:14.739
you've got practice after school, or, you know, or

692
00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:17.020
you play an instrument and you have lessons. And

693
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.060
so, it, it, it's really, it's, it's again, in

694
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:24.659
theory, there's some, uh, there there's some interesting ways

695
00:41:24.659 --> 00:41:27.919
to make sense of this, um. The, the problem

696
00:41:27.919 --> 00:41:31.870
is it's really it's, it's been tried as a

697
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:36.620
way to deter kids from having sex and then,

698
00:41:36.879 --> 00:41:39.120
uh, you know, one of the consequences of, well,

699
00:41:39.159 --> 00:41:42.080
unprotected sex could be having a baby. And so

700
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.750
that's where it's, you know, that's the, the, the,

701
00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.425
the bottom line. For these, these infant simulator dolls.

702
00:41:49.675 --> 00:41:52.864
Uh, WHAT we find is that with or without

703
00:41:52.864 --> 00:41:55.354
infant simulator dolls, at least here in the United

704
00:41:55.354 --> 00:41:59.344
States, teen pregnancy rates have actually gone down. Um,

705
00:41:59.435 --> 00:42:02.155
IS that what that's a function of, I don't

706
00:42:02.155 --> 00:42:05.754
know, but it's certainly not a function of infant

707
00:42:05.754 --> 00:42:09.570
simulator dolls. The, the, here's the interesting thing about

708
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:12.770
it, and it gets where I think sometimes schools

709
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:15.879
need to be very careful. Obviously, these things cost

710
00:42:15.879 --> 00:42:18.770
a lot of money. There's a lot of technology

711
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:20.649
in them and so they cost a lot of

712
00:42:20.649 --> 00:42:25.409
money. And so the companies that produce these infant

713
00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:30.229
simulator dolls, they promote them, right? They, they're these,

714
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:33.770
they will say in their literature, these are effective,

715
00:42:34.129 --> 00:42:36.439
this is, these are the outcomes. But when you,

716
00:42:36.489 --> 00:42:39.169
when you do some digging, what we find is

717
00:42:39.169 --> 00:42:43.090
that they're really just snake oil salesmen. Trying to

718
00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:47.280
make money off of uh what they believe are

719
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.409
education's deep pockets, meaning they've got education has lots

720
00:42:51.409 --> 00:42:53.570
of money and they can, they can make money

721
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:56.850
off of, of education. So, uh, those are two

722
00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:59.639
examples of those sort of the other risky behaviors

723
00:42:59.889 --> 00:43:02.939
and some of the pseudoscience behind them. Mhm.

724
00:43:03.389 --> 00:43:06.540
So now talking a little bit about cognitive assessment,

725
00:43:06.629 --> 00:43:10.629
IQ tests are of course very frequently used. So

726
00:43:10.629 --> 00:43:13.629
what would you say are the most common claims

727
00:43:13.629 --> 00:43:17.899
made about them that do not have much scientific

728
00:43:17.899 --> 00:43:18.139
support?

729
00:43:19.199 --> 00:43:23.360
Yeah, this is an interesting one because in recent

730
00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:28.959
years, it's the the research that's been um published

731
00:43:28.959 --> 00:43:32.600
really has made for some significant changes in how

732
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:37.830
we evaluate kids, particularly kids with um learning disabilities.

733
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.810
So, Um, IQ tests, uh, cognitive assessments, um, they,

734
00:43:43.929 --> 00:43:47.969
they, uh, generally speaking, there's lots of different types

735
00:43:47.969 --> 00:43:51.159
of them, but generally speaking, They they're, they're pretty

736
00:43:51.159 --> 00:43:55.080
good at predicting how, how you'll do in school,

737
00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:57.679
like in, in a, in a, in a kindergarten

738
00:43:57.679 --> 00:44:01.959
through 12th grade school environment. Um, BUT, but it's

739
00:44:01.959 --> 00:44:04.120
pretty rough. I mean, it's not gonna get a

740
00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.719
fine points as well. You'll get an A and

741
00:44:06.719 --> 00:44:09.310
you'll get a B and, you know, you'll struggle

742
00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:12.790
with math and you'll do really well with um

743
00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.120
language arts and it's, it's not that good. It's

744
00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:21.000
a, it's a crude instrument. Um. It's, it's used

745
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.639
to identify individuals with intellectual disability, um, and it's,

746
00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.000
and it's a good part of a, of a,

747
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:31.439
of a comprehensive evaluation. When, when we look at

748
00:44:31.439 --> 00:44:34.639
children and, and, uh, with intellectual disability, we wanna

749
00:44:34.639 --> 00:44:37.399
look, of course, at more than just their cognitive

750
00:44:37.399 --> 00:44:40.040
functioning or intelligence. We want to look at other

751
00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.560
things, um, you know, are they able to kind

752
00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.709
of uh care for themselves? What's their communication like,

753
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:49.520
those sorts of things. Um, WHERE it became problematic,

754
00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:51.290
uh, and, and this is not just in the

755
00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:53.090
United States, this was around the world, is when

756
00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:56.790
we started to look at using, uh, IQ tests

757
00:44:57.169 --> 00:45:02.389
to, um, identify kids with learning disabilities. IQ tests

758
00:45:02.389 --> 00:45:07.830
do not have in them, um, academic assessment. There,

759
00:45:07.909 --> 00:45:11.060
there, that's not part of an IQ test. Um,

760
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:14.139
IQ test does have vocabulary, uh, it does have,

761
00:45:14.389 --> 00:45:17.310
um, uh, which is, which is a, a predictor

762
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:19.979
of learning to read or reading well, but it's,

763
00:45:20.229 --> 00:45:24.500
they don't have academic assessments, yet we use them

764
00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:28.070
to make decisions about kids with learning disabilities. And

765
00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:31.320
moreover, what was going on was We would look

766
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.560
at subtests. So, uh, uh, an IQ test, for

767
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.280
example, may have 12 subtests. Um, AND what we

768
00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.439
would do is we would look at the specific

769
00:45:40.439 --> 00:45:43.840
subtests and make comparisons. So, you know, you might

770
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:48.000
have gotten a, a 6 on this subtest, but

771
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.600
a 10 on that subtest, and what, what, what

772
00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.120
school psychology and clinical psychology was doing was they

773
00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.909
were making claims about that difference. Now, there's a

774
00:45:58.909 --> 00:46:02.350
couple of problems. One is that there's no empirical

775
00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:05.620
support for a lot of what people were suggesting.

776
00:46:05.949 --> 00:46:08.550
Um, IN fact, they, they were, you know, as

777
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:12.350
I was talking earlier about the uh pathology bias,

778
00:46:12.629 --> 00:46:15.080
um, that, that sort of became a problem here

779
00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:18.030
where we would say, well, you got a 10

780
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:20.699
on that subtest and a 6 on that subtest,

781
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.550
that difference is a problem. When we'd look at

782
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:26.429
the population, we'd find that 50% of the population

783
00:46:26.429 --> 00:46:30.399
had a similar difference. Um, SO that was a

784
00:46:30.399 --> 00:46:32.780
problem. The other problem is as we get with

785
00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:36.280
IQ tests, as we look at the subtests, the,

786
00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:40.459
the reliability is, is problematic, um, to, to some

787
00:46:40.459 --> 00:46:44.060
degree, meaning that they're just less reliable when we

788
00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:47.419
start to dig down into these subtests. And so

789
00:46:47.419 --> 00:46:50.939
making decisions about subtests that may not have a

790
00:46:50.939 --> 00:46:54.699
lot of reliability can be problematic and And again,

791
00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:58.139
it was being used mostly for uh making decisions

792
00:46:58.139 --> 00:47:02.100
about kids uh and learning disabilities, when in fact,

793
00:47:02.139 --> 00:47:06.100
we have many, many other assessments that are way

794
00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:11.060
more helpful at determining whether a kid um is

795
00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:15.639
struggling academically in the school curriculum. Mhm.

796
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:20.100
So tell us now about projective drawings. What are

797
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:23.139
they, how are they used and what are some

798
00:47:23.139 --> 00:47:26.770
of the main and supported claims made about them?

799
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.860
Mhm. So that was one of the myths that

800
00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:33.100
we found that school psychologists were, were apt to

801
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.260
believing. So the idea that you can use children's

802
00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:41.340
drawings to um make inferences about them and to

803
00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:45.699
understand the underlying causes of their behavior. Um, PROJECTIVE

804
00:47:45.699 --> 00:47:49.500
drawings, um, and, and projective assessments in general. So,

805
00:47:49.659 --> 00:47:51.780
like the Rorschach, a lot of people are familiar

806
00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:56.320
with the Rorschach, um, the Rorschach and like inkblot

807
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.889
tests and the, uh, and, and drawings. They're, they're

808
00:47:59.889 --> 00:48:03.260
classified as this larger group of projective assessments. And

809
00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:06.709
so the the idea there is that Um, we

810
00:48:06.709 --> 00:48:10.860
wanna get information from a person about their psychological,

811
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:16.040
um, uh, functioning, and we assume that they can't

812
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.830
Tell us that information. It's not that they're nonverbal,

813
00:48:19.899 --> 00:48:24.540
it's that it's hidden deep somewhere inside them, and

814
00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:28.379
that, uh, because we can't get that information from

815
00:48:28.379 --> 00:48:31.580
an interview, uh, what we can do is we

816
00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:35.729
can provide them with these ambiguous stimuli, for example,

817
00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:39.020
an ink blot, or we can ask like a

818
00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.449
child to draw us a picture. Um, AND from

819
00:48:42.449 --> 00:48:45.929
those, their responses, so the, the responses to what

820
00:48:45.929 --> 00:48:48.250
you see in the inkblot or, or what the

821
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:53.689
child draws, we can make inferences about their, uh,

822
00:48:53.699 --> 00:48:59.330
psychological functioning and, and understand their, their behavior. Um.

823
00:49:00.909 --> 00:49:03.810
The, there's a couple of claims that are made

824
00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:07.330
about projective drawings with kids that that's probably worth

825
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:12.399
highlighting. Uh, THE first is that they are useful

826
00:49:12.399 --> 00:49:16.050
in, um, well, well, the first is that they,

827
00:49:16.169 --> 00:49:20.169
that they're, they're reliable, that, that the information you

828
00:49:20.169 --> 00:49:24.570
get from a child's drawings and the interpretations you

829
00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:28.520
make are reliable and Uh, what we find is

830
00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.750
that just not, is not the case. In fact,

831
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.959
when we ask kids to draw pictures, uh, say

832
00:49:34.959 --> 00:49:37.120
we ask them a common one is the house

833
00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.929
tree person. So, uh, we asked them to draw

834
00:49:39.929 --> 00:49:42.280
a house, a tree, and a person. And so,

835
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:44.840
what we find is that when we ask the

836
00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:47.620
the kids, uh, multiple times over the course of,

837
00:49:47.689 --> 00:49:51.610
say, two weeks to draw those pictures, uh, they

838
00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:55.520
draw different pictures. And so, the, the conclusion is

839
00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:59.810
that maybe it's not necessarily a psychological trait that

840
00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:02.969
you're assessing, but rather just sort of what they're

841
00:50:02.969 --> 00:50:05.449
thinking in that moment, right? Uh, uh, MORE of

842
00:50:05.449 --> 00:50:09.939
a, uh, a state characteristic. Um, THE other thought,

843
00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.679
one of the other examples is that If a

844
00:50:13.679 --> 00:50:17.679
child um draws a heavy line, like a dark

845
00:50:17.679 --> 00:50:22.850
line, it suggests aggression. Um, AND there's no evidence

846
00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:26.020
of that whatsoever, that you can have kids that

847
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:30.100
draw dark lines and light lines, and that there's

848
00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:33.260
no meaning in that necessarily, unless the kid makes

849
00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:36.820
meaning of it. Um, THE other claim is that

850
00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:41.389
these projective drawings, these, these drawings that children make

851
00:50:41.389 --> 00:50:46.189
are useful in diagnosis. And um they are not.

852
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:48.459
In fact, there was a study that was done

853
00:50:48.459 --> 00:50:53.370
in the, the mid um 70s, um which is,

854
00:50:53.429 --> 00:50:55.550
this is a good example of where we have

855
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:57.870
research, good research that comes out, but people ignore

856
00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:00.429
it. Um, A study was done in the 70s

857
00:51:00.429 --> 00:51:04.379
where they had children. Who had psychological disorders draw

858
00:51:04.379 --> 00:51:07.540
pictures, and they had children that did not have

859
00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:11.340
psychological disorders draw pictures. So they had two sets

860
00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:15.699
of pictures, the, the psychological problems and the non-psychological

861
00:51:15.699 --> 00:51:23.149
problems. And then they had um Experts in projective

862
00:51:23.149 --> 00:51:27.060
drawings look at both sets blind. They didn't know

863
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:31.149
which which uh which picture went with which, you

864
00:51:31.149 --> 00:51:34.330
know, what category. Uh, AND then they had hospital

865
00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:38.280
secretaries look at the pictures. So people who are

866
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.550
not experts. And what they were to do is,

867
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.040
when they looked at a picture, they were to

868
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.399
say, yes, this child has a psychological disorder. They

869
00:51:46.399 --> 00:51:48.919
didn't have to say what psychological disorder. They just

870
00:51:48.919 --> 00:51:51.560
had to say, yes, this child has a psychological

871
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.879
disorder, or no, this child, based on their picture

872
00:51:54.879 --> 00:51:57.280
does not have a psychological disorder. And you, you

873
00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.689
see where this is going, right? The experts, they

874
00:52:00.689 --> 00:52:04.120
had about a 45% hit rate. So less than

875
00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:07.850
50% of the time, they were accurate in identifying

876
00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:11.010
whether the picture was drawn by a kid with

877
00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:14.409
a psychological disorder or without a psychological disorder. The

878
00:52:14.409 --> 00:52:18.729
hospital secretaries, 67% of the time they were correct.

879
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:26.090
So, you know, is, are these projective drawings useful

880
00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:31.290
for diagnosis? No. Um, IN fact, how we even

881
00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:34.729
interpret these is, is up for a lot of

882
00:52:34.729 --> 00:52:36.729
debate at this point. Now, I will say we

883
00:52:36.729 --> 00:52:40.429
can, we can ask in a, in a school

884
00:52:40.429 --> 00:52:42.729
or a clinical setting, we can ask kids to

885
00:52:42.729 --> 00:52:46.330
draw pictures as part of a rapport building, but

886
00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:50.689
using the content of those pictures to make inferences

887
00:52:50.689 --> 00:52:52.669
is problematic. Mhm.

888
00:52:53.399 --> 00:52:57.260
So let's tackle now a very common one, learning

889
00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:00.379
styles. I mean, is there any evidence at all

890
00:53:00.379 --> 00:53:03.899
for the existence of different kinds of learning styles?

891
00:53:03.979 --> 00:53:06.760
Yeah, that's a really good one. AND, and, and

892
00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.870
here's one of the reasons why I'm assuming there's

893
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:11.610
sort of an international audience here. This is, this

894
00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:15.719
is a, this is not a um pseudo-scientific idea

895
00:53:15.719 --> 00:53:18.570
that's specific to the United States, probably like the

896
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:22.050
open classrooms, for example. Um, THERE was a, there

897
00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:25.209
was a study that was done, um, uh, and

898
00:53:25.209 --> 00:53:26.679
I'm looking at the number. I want to get

899
00:53:26.679 --> 00:53:31.280
the percent right, um. So looking at whether you

900
00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:34.040
use learning styles. So, so let me just take

901
00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.520
a step back, what learning styles are. So it's

902
00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:40.389
the idea that you, that you learn best visually,

903
00:53:40.639 --> 00:53:45.709
uh, auditorily, uh, kinesiology, like in terms of touch

904
00:53:45.709 --> 00:53:50.659
tactically. Um, AND so, so that, that, that based

905
00:53:50.659 --> 00:53:54.300
on your style, your preferred style, that's how you

906
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.409
should be taught. So if your preferred style is,

907
00:53:57.489 --> 00:54:01.739
uh, visual, then, you know, seeing lots of things

908
00:54:01.739 --> 00:54:04.139
is gonna be more effective in terms of your

909
00:54:04.139 --> 00:54:07.409
learning. Um. The, the, the, so let me just

910
00:54:07.409 --> 00:54:10.969
say just how widespread this belief is. Um, SO

911
00:54:10.969 --> 00:54:13.709
if you look at uh teachers in the United

912
00:54:13.709 --> 00:54:16.250
Kingdom, they, cause they survey teachers and they ask,

913
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:19.770
you know, do you use learning styles, um, in

914
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:23.290
terms of understanding your students and, and preparing lessons

915
00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:28.560
for them, um, just under 3 quarters, just under

916
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:33.750
75% said yes, they do. Um, AND, and that's

917
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:36.629
been replicated around the, the world in terms of

918
00:54:36.629 --> 00:54:40.270
teachers' use of, uh, learning styles. Uh, HERE in

919
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:44.870
the United States, you've got almost 30 states actually

920
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:49.389
in their teacher education standards, but learning styles needs

921
00:54:49.389 --> 00:54:51.689
to be taught. To students. I mean, that's, you,

922
00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:54.360
you know, you talk about a, a major problem,

923
00:54:54.489 --> 00:54:57.770
that's a major problem. Um, THE, the research is

924
00:54:57.770 --> 00:55:02.169
very, very clear. Uh, THE use of, um, of

925
00:55:02.169 --> 00:55:05.689
learning styles, it does not matter one bit in

926
00:55:05.689 --> 00:55:10.409
terms of effective teaching. Um, IN fact, it's best

927
00:55:10.409 --> 00:55:14.820
to provide kids with multiple mediums in terms of,

928
00:55:14.969 --> 00:55:17.290
you know, the content, so they, they should be

929
00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:19.850
able to hear it and see it, and, and

930
00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:22.770
manipulate it. Um, THAT tends to be the most

931
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:27.290
effective way to teach. And, um, saying that, well,

932
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:30.600
we, we, if we know a kid's preferred learning

933
00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:33.719
style or the learning style that maybe we think

934
00:55:33.719 --> 00:55:37.679
is preferred, um, and using that only as the

935
00:55:37.679 --> 00:55:41.110
only mechanism by, by which we teach that child,

936
00:55:41.399 --> 00:55:44.239
um, we're actually gonna do harm there because we

937
00:55:44.239 --> 00:55:47.979
know that a combination of approaches is most effective.

938
00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:52.770
So let me ask you now about motivational theories.

939
00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:55.489
I mean, what are motivational theories and what are

940
00:55:55.489 --> 00:55:59.689
some of the most common misconceptions and myths about

941
00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:01.570
them in the school context?

942
00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:05.209
Right. Yeah, there, there's lots of motivational theories and

943
00:56:05.209 --> 00:56:07.929
we could probably spend a whole, our whole, you

944
00:56:07.929 --> 00:56:10.889
know, time together talking about motivational theories. One of

945
00:56:10.889 --> 00:56:15.379
the common motivational theories is self-determination theory. That, uh,

946
00:56:15.389 --> 00:56:19.669
we're motivated to uh engage in different things in

947
00:56:19.669 --> 00:56:23.280
order to fulfill some sort of, uh, uh, um,

948
00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:25.669
goal. I mean, it, you know, it's very similar

949
00:56:25.669 --> 00:56:29.429
to what goal setting uh theory is very similar

950
00:56:29.429 --> 00:56:32.870
there. Um, SO there's lots and lots of motivation.

951
00:56:33.155 --> 00:56:37.594
THEORIES. What, what's relevant for schools and education and,

952
00:56:37.655 --> 00:56:41.125
and working with kids and adolescents is this, this

953
00:56:41.125 --> 00:56:45.905
idea that we have um this dichotomous uh notion

954
00:56:45.905 --> 00:56:50.554
of motivation in terms of intrinsic motivation and extrinsic

955
00:56:50.554 --> 00:56:55.469
motivation. Uh, INTRINSIC motivation is that internally, you're motivated

956
00:56:55.469 --> 00:56:58.909
to, to, to engage in a behavior or complete

957
00:56:58.909 --> 00:57:03.110
a task. Uh, EXTERNAL motivation is that it's external.

958
00:57:03.149 --> 00:57:07.189
You're getting something to, to do the task, right?

959
00:57:07.389 --> 00:57:09.604
So, you know, I go to work. Uh, uh,

960
00:57:09.695 --> 00:57:13.175
YOU know, Monday morning, and, um, I really love

961
00:57:13.175 --> 00:57:15.544
my job and I get a lot of, um,

962
00:57:15.784 --> 00:57:18.254
uh, reinforcement for my job, uh, but I also

963
00:57:18.254 --> 00:57:21.254
get paid to come, right? And so, the, the,

964
00:57:21.334 --> 00:57:24.135
the, uh, you know, the idea for, in the

965
00:57:24.135 --> 00:57:26.909
world of schools and with kids is that Uh,

966
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:31.389
intrinsic motivation is valued over, uh, extrinsic motivation. In

967
00:57:31.389 --> 00:57:35.350
fact, if we extrinsically motivate kids, uh, by giving

968
00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:39.100
them rewards, for example, for their performance or effort,

969
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:42.860
that we actually may be harming their intrinsic motivation,

970
00:57:43.229 --> 00:57:46.949
thereby creating problems as they, you know, get out

971
00:57:46.949 --> 00:57:50.110
of school and have to do things where maybe

972
00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:54.939
they aren't extrinsically motivated. The first problem with this

973
00:57:54.939 --> 00:58:00.030
whole line of thinking is that Nobody's really studied

974
00:58:00.159 --> 00:58:04.989
the idea of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation as actual

975
00:58:05.239 --> 00:58:10.689
uh theories of motivation, um. In fact, um, nobody's

976
00:58:10.689 --> 00:58:16.370
really defined, clearly defined these two terms. Um, IF

977
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:18.479
you look in the literature, there's going to be

978
00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:23.090
lots of references to intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, but

979
00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:26.649
people define them very differently. So that's the first

980
00:58:26.649 --> 00:58:29.770
problem. The second problem is, you know, especially with

981
00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:33.159
intrinsic motivation, how do we know? Like, how can

982
00:58:33.159 --> 00:58:37.360
we look into somebody. And see that they're intrinsically

983
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:40.600
motivated. And I would argue the same with extrinsic,

984
00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:43.550
like, you either do the task or you don't.

985
00:58:44.679 --> 00:58:46.560
What, what are we looking for in terms of

986
00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:50.439
this intrinsic and extrinsic thing that exists? And so

987
00:58:50.439 --> 00:58:54.949
there's lots of questions, uh, professionally and and and

988
00:58:54.959 --> 00:58:58.340
and scientifically about, like, where do these things actually

989
00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:02.639
lie? Like, how do I actually measure intrinsic motivation?

990
00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:06.280
Um, AND then third, this, this whole idea of

991
00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:10.239
intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, uh, came from a study

992
00:59:10.239 --> 00:59:14.909
that was done in 1973. Uh, THEY gave children,

993
00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:18.330
uh, the task of drawing something. So they got,

994
00:59:18.399 --> 00:59:20.830
they were doing some art, if you will. And,

995
00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:24.959
um, what they said, they had two groups, and

996
00:59:24.959 --> 00:59:29.510
one group, they said, just draw. The other group,

997
00:59:29.729 --> 00:59:32.889
they said, draw, and then how much you have

998
00:59:32.889 --> 00:59:36.360
on the page will determine some kind of reward.

999
00:59:36.689 --> 00:59:39.360
So there was this like promise for a reward.

1000
00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:44.159
Um, AND what the researchers found was that the

1001
00:59:44.159 --> 00:59:48.000
kids that were told to just draw. Produced way

1002
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.199
more content than the kids who were told, if

1003
00:59:51.199 --> 00:59:54.070
you just draw this much, you'll get a reward.

1004
00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.800
In fact, they, they just drew that much. Nobody

1005
00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.669
went above and beyond. Um, AND so based on

1006
01:00:01.669 --> 01:00:04.620
that one study, there was this idea that was

1007
01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:09.100
promoted that intrinsic motivation is better than extrinsic motivation,

1008
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:14.780
and in fact, extrinsic rewards can harm kids' performance.

1009
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:20.639
Now, it's one study. Um, IT'S, the kids were

1010
01:00:20.639 --> 01:00:24.479
told ahead of time what the standard was, and

1011
01:00:24.479 --> 01:00:26.320
that if they met the standard, they'd get the

1012
01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.280
reward. They weren't told anything about going above and

1013
01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.239
beyond the standard, meaning perhaps they got more if

1014
01:00:35.239 --> 01:00:38.159
they produced more, right? If they drew more on

1015
01:00:38.159 --> 01:00:42.260
the page, they'd get more of the reward. Um,

1016
01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.199
THAT was not part of this whatsoever. And so

1017
01:00:46.199 --> 01:00:49.360
there's a lot of questions about, you know, coming

1018
01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.719
up with conclusions about one type of motivation being

1019
01:00:53.719 --> 01:00:56.840
better than the other based on one study that

1020
01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:01.080
largely hadn't been replicated. And in fact, research comes

1021
01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:06.120
out pretty regularly that suggests that when we do

1022
01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:12.979
reward kids for particularly effort, Their effort improves, and

1023
01:01:12.979 --> 01:01:17.300
we know that when we reinforce kids' behavior, that

1024
01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:21.770
the behavior increases in its frequency or quality. So

1025
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:24.489
there's like all this other research out there that

1026
01:01:24.489 --> 01:01:28.969
really um uh supports the idea that, you know

1027
01:01:28.969 --> 01:01:32.530
what, rewarding kids isn't harmful at all, yet there's

1028
01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:36.090
this idea that rewarding kids is harmful, and it

1029
01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:40.919
comes from a couple of, of well spoken, um,

1030
01:01:40.929 --> 01:01:45.870
proponents of Doing away with rewards in schools, or

1031
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:49.429
doing away with rewards with kids. In fact, I

1032
01:01:49.429 --> 01:01:51.709
heard, I, I presented a conference a couple of

1033
01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:56.820
years ago. Um, THESE were all, um, uh, family,

1034
01:01:56.989 --> 01:02:00.719
uh uh uh social service workers, so like social

1035
01:02:00.719 --> 01:02:04.550
workers and, and counselors, and the keynote speaker was

1036
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:08.830
talking about kids or people are punished by rewards.

1037
01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:12.629
Um, AGAIN, not citing any research, and although he

1038
01:02:12.629 --> 01:02:20.429
did suggest that in businesses, when companies reward employees,

1039
01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:24.030
their, the employee's performance goes down, that he made

1040
01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:26.790
that claim in the, in the talk. Now, one

1041
01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:29.469
of the great things about having a, having a

1042
01:02:29.469 --> 01:02:32.110
computer in your hand at a conference is you

1043
01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:36.020
can Google something. So I, of course, Googled uh

1044
01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:41.310
rewards, uh, business, performance, something like that. I think

1045
01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:44.810
I had 3 terms. And then I put research

1046
01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:46.459
at the end. So I had 4 things in

1047
01:02:46.459 --> 01:02:49.899
my Google search, and I it came back, the

1048
01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:54.340
1st 3 things that came back were meta-analysis indicating

1049
01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:59.919
that businesses that reward performance or effort actually see

1050
01:02:59.919 --> 01:03:05.520
an increase in employee productivity. So, I, you know,

1051
01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:08.189
I, of course, I didn't raise my hand and

1052
01:03:08.199 --> 01:03:10.479
say, hey, I got, I got something here for

1053
01:03:10.479 --> 01:03:13.669
you, but that that person was speaking to an

1054
01:03:13.669 --> 01:03:17.439
audience of about 500 people and was speaking very

1055
01:03:17.439 --> 01:03:21.679
well. And my guess is that 499 people in

1056
01:03:21.679 --> 01:03:26.239
that audience left believing that rewards harm harm is

1057
01:03:26.239 --> 01:03:30.199
harm are harmful for children. When in fact, sometimes

1058
01:03:30.199 --> 01:03:33.000
that's what we have available to us. Not every

1059
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.919
kid goes to school and is willing to behave

1060
01:03:36.919 --> 01:03:40.350
the best they can. And so, the alternative is

1061
01:03:40.639 --> 01:03:43.679
we provide reinforcement. And, and I would advocate that

1062
01:03:43.679 --> 01:03:47.919
the rewards or the reinforcement should be acknowledgment. They

1063
01:03:47.919 --> 01:03:50.399
don't always have to be pieces of candy, uh,

1064
01:03:50.439 --> 01:03:53.439
but certainly attention and praise and those kinds of

1065
01:03:53.439 --> 01:03:57.540
things uh are important, as well as Not just

1066
01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:01.020
rewarding performance, but also rewarding effort. Like I, I

1067
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:02.739
see you worked really hard at that. I know

1068
01:04:02.739 --> 01:04:05.969
you, you didn't get all the questions right, but

1069
01:04:05.969 --> 01:04:09.939
your effort is something that I noticed. Great job.

1070
01:04:11.179 --> 01:04:14.699
Mhm. Great. So let me just ask you two

1071
01:04:14.699 --> 01:04:18.969
more general questions here before we wrap up. So,

1072
01:04:18.979 --> 01:04:22.389
what would you say that teachers, educators, and even

1073
01:04:22.389 --> 01:04:26.659
school psychologists can do with all this information? How

1074
01:04:26.659 --> 01:04:27.770
can they apply it?

1075
01:04:28.929 --> 01:04:31.290
Right, I, I, it's a great question. That, that's

1076
01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:33.969
the, like what, you know, so what's the point

1077
01:04:33.969 --> 01:04:35.810
of all this, right? And so I think there's

1078
01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:39.419
a few things. I think the first is, um,

1079
01:04:39.889 --> 01:04:44.899
You know, certainly taking the, the, the pseudoscientific practices,

1080
01:04:44.979 --> 01:04:50.340
the, the fringe science that we present, and re-evaluating

1081
01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:54.219
their own practice, right? So, for school psychologists, or

1082
01:04:54.219 --> 01:04:57.219
teachers or administrators, or anybody who, any of those

1083
01:04:57.219 --> 01:04:59.979
topics that are relevant, that they, they, they, they

1084
01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:04.379
evaluate their own practices with, with kids and adolescents

1085
01:05:04.379 --> 01:05:07.000
in a school context. I think that's the first

1086
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.260
thing I would say is important. The second thing

1087
01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:13.989
is taking a, uh, uh, a, you know, a

1088
01:05:13.989 --> 01:05:16.879
real deep look at the practices that that occur

1089
01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:24.889
in schools and Asking why are these pseudoscientific practices

1090
01:05:24.889 --> 01:05:32.439
continuing. Um, THE, the, there's a, um, Uh, a

1091
01:05:32.439 --> 01:05:36.120
researcher, Ian Ianides, who came up with the term

1092
01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:40.879
self-correction and suggested that psychology is not very good

1093
01:05:40.879 --> 01:05:47.229
at self-correcting, meaning practices continue despite research coming out

1094
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.879
that dispel the the uh veracity or validity of

1095
01:05:50.879 --> 01:05:55.689
those practices. Um, MEDICINE is very good at self-correcting.

1096
01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:58.179
Like, we, we don't, you know, we don't have

1097
01:05:58.179 --> 01:06:01.770
leeches anymore when we have a, a suspected disease.

1098
01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:05.179
Um, SCIENCE in general, like physics is really good

1099
01:06:05.179 --> 01:06:09.620
at self-correcting. Um, Newton came out with his, you

1100
01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:12.179
know, laws of motion and his theories of gravity,

1101
01:06:12.239 --> 01:06:16.500
and then Einstein came around later and added to

1102
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.820
that. But, but it made everyone sort of rethink

1103
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:23.290
things, and Psychology is not so great at that.

1104
01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:27.250
You know, we've been able to over a century,

1105
01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:32.020
determine that much of what Freud promoted um is

1106
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:37.459
not scientifically supported, yet, Freud lives on in our

1107
01:06:37.459 --> 01:06:41.449
textbooks, in our teaching, and our practices. So I,

1108
01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:45.260
I think what educators and school psychologists and school

1109
01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:49.310
administrators can do. I, again, take a deep look

1110
01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:52.820
at the practices that you're engaging in currently and,

1111
01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:58.310
and evaluate them. Uh, UNDERSTAND, OK, is this, does

1112
01:06:58.310 --> 01:07:01.429
this work and, and evaluating them in a rigorous

1113
01:07:01.429 --> 01:07:04.030
way, not just, well, what does the research say,

1114
01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:07.530
but also what's happening in my classroom or what's

1115
01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:09.790
happening in my school, or what's happening with my

1116
01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:13.699
practice when I evaluate what it, what I'm doing.

1117
01:07:14.129 --> 01:07:16.179
And then the third thing I think that's really

1118
01:07:16.179 --> 01:07:20.699
important is advocacy, you know, advocating for um the

1119
01:07:20.699 --> 01:07:24.459
use of evidence-based practices in schools. Um, YOU know,

1120
01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.100
we have a, a chapter in the book on

1121
01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:34.399
developmental disabilities, neurodivergence, and specifically that these, these, um,

1122
01:07:34.409 --> 01:07:38.820
dubious practices that are, um, used with kids with

1123
01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:44.179
autism. Mhm. And so we need to advocate for

1124
01:07:44.179 --> 01:07:47.709
the use of evidence-based practices and and it can

1125
01:07:47.709 --> 01:07:52.590
be sometimes a a difficult position to put yourself

1126
01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:54.989
in, uh, because these things have been going on

1127
01:07:54.989 --> 01:07:57.989
for a long time where people are very passionate

1128
01:07:57.989 --> 01:08:01.270
about what they're doing, and, and I think we

1129
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:04.790
still need advocates in in those in those places

1130
01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:09.889
to um promote. Effective evidence-based practices. So I think

1131
01:08:09.889 --> 01:08:12.290
those are the things I think that teachers and

1132
01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:15.850
educators can really do, uh, in school psychologists. And

1133
01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:18.410
then finally, I, I, you know, I, I, I

1134
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:20.330
presented on this just recently, and I talked a

1135
01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:25.009
lot about, um, just being critical thinkers. I think

1136
01:08:25.009 --> 01:08:29.959
that's important. And being um conscientious of those um

1137
01:08:30.209 --> 01:08:33.729
cognitive biases, those cognitive errors that we make, and

1138
01:08:33.729 --> 01:08:37.799
the heuristics that we practice, being aware of those

1139
01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:41.839
and checking those biases that you may have, um,

1140
01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:46.129
as you're evaluating evidence for different practices that happen

1141
01:08:46.129 --> 01:08:48.149
in schools. Mhm.

1142
01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:52.490
But because we're always learning new things about everything

1143
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:55.729
related to school psychology, I mean, new knowledge is

1144
01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:58.689
always getting developed and stuff like that. What are

1145
01:08:58.689 --> 01:09:05.330
the most reliable sources for school psychologists, teachers, parents,

1146
01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:07.850
and other people that might be interested in this

1147
01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:08.359
topic?

1148
01:09:09.417 --> 01:09:12.238
Yeah, that's a, that's a really, again, I think

1149
01:09:12.238 --> 01:09:13.798
about that question, I think we could do a

1150
01:09:13.798 --> 01:09:17.758
whole session just on that. Um, BUT, but to

1151
01:09:17.758 --> 01:09:21.679
boil it down, I think the, the most reliable

1152
01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:26.169
sources generally are um You know, if I think

1153
01:09:26.169 --> 01:09:30.529
about research, it's, it's research that comes from peer

1154
01:09:30.529 --> 01:09:37.770
reviewed, uh, places. So the journals, books, um, conferences

1155
01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:41.850
where there's, where there's a review process, a scientific

1156
01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:46.810
review process in place that is able to, um,

1157
01:09:47.288 --> 01:09:50.719
Uh one, provide feedback on, on the, on the

1158
01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:55.048
research, but also screen. But that doesn't mean there's

1159
01:09:55.048 --> 01:10:00.208
going to be nonsense that's promoted in these places.

1160
01:10:00.568 --> 01:10:03.769
Not all journals are created equally. There are not

1161
01:10:03.769 --> 01:10:07.369
all fields are created equally. Um, SO I think

1162
01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:10.849
it's, um, I think it's not necessarily just the

1163
01:10:11.609 --> 01:10:16.020
Sources that are important, but it's training yourself to,

1164
01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:19.209
to be, to have this sort of healthy skepticism.

1165
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:23.430
And, and as you begin to look at the

1166
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:26.620
evidence that's out there, and, and then the evidence

1167
01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:29.540
could be even on the internet, but, but evaluate

1168
01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:35.770
the evidence critically or skeptically. Think about how that

1169
01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:39.120
um think about what are the implications of these

1170
01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:43.330
of these different types of studies, um, but, but

1171
01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:49.200
also perhaps equally important is thinking about um What,

1172
01:10:49.209 --> 01:10:52.830
what, what's, what, who's speaking about this stuff and,

1173
01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:56.569
and being very, very cautious. Now, you can be

1174
01:10:56.569 --> 01:11:00.009
skeptical and then become cynical very quickly. So I

1175
01:11:00.009 --> 01:11:03.689
think that in, and Carl Sagan said this, it's

1176
01:11:03.689 --> 01:11:07.729
the balance between skepticism and openness. So that when,

1177
01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.600
you know, if you are if you've been doing

1178
01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.649
something for a long time, if you're a teacher

1179
01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:14.770
and you've been using a particular teaching approach for

1180
01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:18.020
a long time. And you begin thinking, well, I'm

1181
01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:21.319
a little skeptical about whether this is working, you

1182
01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:25.509
know, rigorously evaluate it and be open to the

1183
01:11:25.509 --> 01:11:30.850
possibilities that that rigorous evaluation may um may find.

1184
01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:35.339
Mhm. Great. So, the book is again investigating school

1185
01:11:35.339 --> 01:11:39.779
psychology, pseudoscience, science, and controversies. I'm, of course, leaving

1186
01:11:39.779 --> 01:11:41.819
a link to it in the description of the

1187
01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:45.569
interview. And Dr. Axelrod, just before we go apart

1188
01:11:45.569 --> 01:11:48.379
from the book, where can people find your work

1189
01:11:48.379 --> 01:11:49.410
on the internet?

1190
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.290
Yeah, I think, um, I've, I've done a lot

1191
01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:56.569
of research uh in child and adolescent psychology, particularly,

1192
01:11:56.689 --> 01:12:00.299
um, the evidence-based interventions. So I think in the,

1193
01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:05.259
uh, scientific literature around school psychology, clinical psychology, and

1194
01:12:05.259 --> 01:12:08.899
pediatric psychology, I think is really valuable. I'm at

1195
01:12:08.899 --> 01:12:11.830
the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. I direct something called

1196
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:16.450
the Human Development Center. We are an on-campus, um,

1197
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:20.259
clinic, so we provide clinical services to children, adolescents,

1198
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:23.629
and families in the community. Um, AND it's students

1199
01:12:23.629 --> 01:12:26.459
that are actually providing the services under the supervision

1200
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:30.020
of, uh, credential faculty. So hopefully, we're teaching them

1201
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:33.870
to, uh, use evidence-based practices, but, um, I bring

1202
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:36.270
that up because you can go to the UW

1203
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:41.109
Eau Claire website UWEC.edu um and you can Google

1204
01:12:41.109 --> 01:12:42.830
me and you can find a lot of the

1205
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:44.430
work that I've done and a lot of the

1206
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:45.629
work that my team has done.

1207
01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.799
Great. So, Doctor Axelrod, thank you so much for

1208
01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:51.479
