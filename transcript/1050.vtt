00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.940
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.719
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs sent

3
00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:08.899
to the MEN by Doctor David Henschel. He's professor

4
00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:12.020
of molecular physiology and neuroscience in the Department of

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.140
Physiology and Medical Physics at the Royal College of

6
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.180
Surgeons in Ireland. And we're, and today we're going

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.700
to talk about his book, FineTuning Life, A Guide

8
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.170
to MicroRNAs, your genomes master regulators. So, Doctor Henschel,

9
00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:29.299
welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure to

10
00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:29.440
everyone.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.959
Thank you very much for having me. I'm delighted

12
00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:32.590
to be here.

13
00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.580
Well, I guess that this, uh, interview is very

14
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.189
timely just because very recently, someone won the Nobel

15
00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:44.459
Prize in physiology or medicine due to the discoveries

16
00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:48.650
surrounding microRNA. So, uh, but before we get into

17
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.590
microRNA specifically, just to Perhaps familiarize the audience with

18
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.029
some of the basics here. What would you say

19
00:00:58.029 --> 00:01:01.220
are the most important things for people to understand

20
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.230
about DNA and RNA for them, for them to

21
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.339
then understand the rest of our conversation surrounding microRNA?

22
00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:15.510
So, yeah, we can start perhaps with DNA because

23
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.739
that's the the molecule that I think everyone is

24
00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:23.430
most familiar with. So DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid is

25
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.709
the genetic material that we have in all the

26
00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.099
cells in our, in our bodies. It's essentially a

27
00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:35.110
program instructions for building an organism. In our case,

28
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.550
so our DNA contains the information to build a,

29
00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:41.300
a human, and obviously, once that human is built

30
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.970
to keep it functioning the way it should. So

31
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.809
DNA is an extremely long molecule, but essentially it's

32
00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:53.319
um code if you like, the information is made

33
00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.129
up of one of four different chemicals we call

34
00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:01.860
bases. And they are given the short letters A,

35
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.000
C, G, and T. And essentially when we talk

36
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.559
about DNA, what we're really talking about is, is

37
00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:13.889
genes and genetic information. And what most people think

38
00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:18.729
of with genes are genes that contain the information

39
00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:23.899
to build proteins in cells. So proteins are really

40
00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:27.559
what cells use for the vast majority of their

41
00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.809
activities. An example of a protein would be hemoglobin,

42
00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:33.289
which of course carries oxygen in the blood, or

43
00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:37.699
insulin, which regulates our blood glucose levels. But actually

44
00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.619
cells use hundreds of different proteins to carry out

45
00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:45.940
all of their activities. Now the information to build

46
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.020
that protein is, is contained within DNA. So a

47
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.660
gene is really the instructions to make a, a

48
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.720
protein. But we don't jump straight from DNA to

49
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.679
protein. There's uh an intermediate molecule called RNA or

50
00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:09.669
ribonucleic acid. So information flows from, from DNA via

51
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.979
RNA to to protein. So how this all starts

52
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.360
is that the DNA, which is in a helix

53
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.250
normally, uh, within the nucleus of our cells. Opens

54
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.039
up, so it sort of unzips. And then the

55
00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.009
gene can be read, so the gene for that

56
00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.770
particular protein, let's say, say hemoglobin, can be red.

57
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.449
So what happens is an RNA copy is made

58
00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.570
of the DNA. So RNA is very similar to

59
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.649
DNA. It's a sort of chemical cousin. Called ribonucleic

60
00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:49.960
acid, or RNA for short. So this long sequence

61
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.279
of ACGT, ACGT GGG, CCT, TTT, this is the

62
00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:01.820
information within the DNA that is basically red, and

63
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.080
we generate an RNA for that gene. That RNA

64
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.160
now moves out of the nucleus of the cell

65
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.630
and moves into a different part of the cell

66
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.480
to build the protein. So that RNA eventually uh

67
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.720
gets sent to something called the ribosome, which is

68
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.660
a sort of protein production facility. And the RNA

69
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.220
gets threaded through this ribosome and as it does

70
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.170
so, amino acids are joined together. One after the

71
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.890
other and that long chain of amino acids becomes

72
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.700
our protein. Mhm. So, the DNA is the information

73
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.619
to build the protein. RNA is the molecule that

74
00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:48.140
takes that sort of information, and then that is

75
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.630
translated into this amino acid sequence that becomes uh

76
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.739
the, the protein.

77
00:04:54.739 --> 00:05:00.640
Right. Uh, AND so we have, uh, transcription, we

78
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.000
have translation, but I mean, uh, that is the

79
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.880
most, the simplest way of describing the, the, describing

80
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.399
the process, but then we also have things like

81
00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:15.040
gene regulation, right? And that's I think one of

82
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.950
the places where microRNAs play the biggest role, correct?

83
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.160
Yeah, absolutely, so. Genes are switched on and off,

84
00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:29.929
OK, and, and certain types of cells require certain

85
00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:32.519
types of proteins. So if you give the example

86
00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:34.970
of hemoglobin, our red blood cells want to be

87
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.130
packed full of hemoglobin, but red blood cells don't

88
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.109
need to produce, for example, say, neurotransmitters or or

89
00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:46.700
or insulin. So cells throughout the body produce different

90
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.579
types of protein for the for the jobs, the,

91
00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:52.260
the, the functions that they have. And this is

92
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.739
where gene regulation comes in. So DNA is the,

93
00:05:55.859 --> 00:05:58.730
it contains instructions for making all of the genes

94
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.420
that we need, but particular cells, particular tissues will

95
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.179
only select, they'll kind of pick and choose which

96
00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:08.209
genes are going to be switched on and off.

97
00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:12.790
Now, to switch a gene on. We actually require

98
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.589
something called a transcription factor, which is a particular

99
00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:20.059
protein or group of proteins that will bind onto

100
00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:23.989
a region of DNA near the gene, and it's

101
00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:27.230
sort of the on switch for that gene to

102
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.660
start getting um switched on and for RNA copies

103
00:06:32.109 --> 00:06:35.589
to be made of that of that gene. And

104
00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:40.739
then we have other types of regulators. That switch

105
00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:43.779
genes off afterwards. So a gene may be switched

106
00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:46.049
on for a, for a period of time and,

107
00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:49.019
and then switched off. Other, other genes may be

108
00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:52.160
switched on sort of almost continuously. Some genes are,

109
00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:54.380
are, are switched on and off very, very rapidly,

110
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.299
very dynamically.

111
00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:59.600
Uh, AND so, uh, I mean, uh, before we

112
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.630
get into microRNA specifically in that process that you

113
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.559
described earlier of first transcription and then translation, we

114
00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:11.959
also have particular kinds of RNA molecules playing roles

115
00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:15.309
in transcript. And we have uh MRNA and in

116
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:18.869
translation TRNA, right? I mean, I'm asking you that

117
00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:21.859
because I will also want to try to understand

118
00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:25.350
the different kinds of RNA molecules that are out

119
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.140
there and how they relate to one another.

120
00:07:29.609 --> 00:07:33.380
Yes, so there's actually lots of different types of

121
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.130
RNA. The type of RNA I've described so far

122
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.250
as, as you said, is mRNA or messenger RNA.

123
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.089
That's the RNA that, that, that carries the information

124
00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:45.859
uh to the ribosome to, to build the protein.

125
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:50.709
But our genome, the collection of all of the

126
00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:55.470
genetic information, our genome produces many other types of

127
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.350
RNA which are functional within the cell that do

128
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.670
other jobs. So one of the examples you just

129
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.709
gave was something called TRNA or transfer RNA. So

130
00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:10.019
this is a little RNA that works within that

131
00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:14.290
ribosome to bring the amino acids one at a

132
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.940
time in. As that chain is built. In fact,

133
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.149
the ribosome itself is made up of something called

134
00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:25.910
RNA or ribosomal RNA, which is another huge molecule

135
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:31.589
that helps form this protein production factory. What we've

136
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:35.349
discovered really over the last um couple of decades,

137
00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:37.989
and, and this sort of brings us closer to

138
00:08:37.989 --> 00:08:40.989
what microRNA's are, is there's all these other types

139
00:08:40.989 --> 00:08:45.549
of RNA. That get transcribed, don't code for protein,

140
00:08:45.669 --> 00:08:49.349
but that do other important jobs with how genes

141
00:08:49.349 --> 00:08:51.380
switch on uh and switch off.

142
00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:57.929
Right. And so, what are microRNAs then and how

143
00:08:57.929 --> 00:09:01.289
do they relate to these other different kinds of

144
00:09:01.289 --> 00:09:03.090
RNA molecules?

145
00:09:04.049 --> 00:09:09.059
So microRNAs are a class or a category of

146
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.780
short or small RNA. So these are not RNAs

147
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.780
that that code for protein. These are part of

148
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.700
the big sort of soup of RNAs that work

149
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:27.679
to regulate gene activity. And micro microRNAs are, are

150
00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:30.479
produced uh a little bit like um other genes.

151
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.609
They're, they're red from DNA. And a sequence is

152
00:09:34.609 --> 00:09:37.690
produced, quite a long sequence initially, a sort of

153
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:41.520
a precursor molecule of the microRNA. But as that

154
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.409
microRNA starts to move on its journey, it gets

155
00:09:44.409 --> 00:09:47.770
cut down to size. And so the the actual

156
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.559
functional part of the microRNA is actually quite short.

157
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:56.450
It's only around 20, about 20 to 22 nucleotides.

158
00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.609
Um, SO the nucleotides, that relates to what we

159
00:09:59.609 --> 00:10:02.469
said earlier about the, the, the chemical bases in,

160
00:10:02.489 --> 00:10:07.409
in DNA. RNA also has 4 types of chemical

161
00:10:07.409 --> 00:10:10.210
bases. Uh, THE A and the C and the

162
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.270
G are all the same, but it has a,

163
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.130
a, a slightly different 4th base instead of a

164
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.210
T that we have in DNA, it has a

165
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.820
U. Um, BUT, but otherwise it has this sort

166
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.940
of same four bases. So a microRNA when it's

167
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.500
produced, when it's functioning, is about 20 of these

168
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.460
nucleotides long, which is, which is really quite, quite

169
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:30.950
short.

170
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.500
Mhm. Uh, BUT, but then, I mean, because we

171
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:40.020
have these different kinds of RNA molecules, do they

172
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.419
have any sort of relationship between them just because

173
00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:47.309
they are all RNA molecules of different sorts or

174
00:10:47.309 --> 00:10:47.690
not?

175
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.219
So the main differentiator really is, is the sort

176
00:10:52.219 --> 00:10:54.929
of the length of the molecule and its specific

177
00:10:54.929 --> 00:11:00.250
chemistry. So a messenger RNA has some very specific

178
00:11:00.739 --> 00:11:04.890
uh regions within it. That um it has obviously

179
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.650
the region which codes for the protein, but it

180
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.169
also has a sort of a top and a

181
00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:13.580
tail, which contain information that tells that messenger RNA

182
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.650
where to go and to get threaded through the

183
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.450
ribosome and, and so forth. And all of the

184
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.890
other types of RNA that we have, the longer

185
00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:28.000
RNAs, the short RNAs, the microRNAs, they also have

186
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.640
information within that sequence that um it tells them,

187
00:11:31.729 --> 00:11:33.929
you know, where to be and how to work

188
00:11:33.929 --> 00:11:34.599
properly.

189
00:11:34.929 --> 00:11:40.989
Yeah. And how and when were microRNAs discovered?

190
00:11:41.969 --> 00:11:46.820
So microRNAs were discovered in 1993 in the back

191
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.299
to back papers in the journal Cell, which is

192
00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:53.340
one of the top journals in the world, and

193
00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.140
it was the discovery that was made at that

194
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.140
time that that recently just got the Nobel Prize

195
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.460
for the, for the two senior people on those

196
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.299
first two papers, uh, Victor Ambrose and Gary Rufkin.

197
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.539
So, what they were doing at the time was

198
00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:15.229
they were interested in understanding how organisms develop. And

199
00:12:15.229 --> 00:12:18.880
and they used an organism called C. ELEGANS, uh,

200
00:12:18.919 --> 00:12:22.320
which is a very small, quite a simple worm.

201
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.950
It only has about 1000 cells in the in

202
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.150
the sort of adult worm. And um the work

203
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.409
of, of themselves and others had been focused on

204
00:12:33.409 --> 00:12:36.030
thinking, look, if we can understand how a simple

205
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.390
animal develops from a single cell to its adult

206
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.989
form and understand the gene programs that switch on

207
00:12:42.989 --> 00:12:46.190
and off as that organism develops. Perhaps we'll learn

208
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.969
a little bit more about more complex organisms, including

209
00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:53.450
humans also develop and, and that turned out to

210
00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.409
be uh to be true in, in many different

211
00:12:55.409 --> 00:12:58.840
ways. So at the time of the discovery of

212
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.960
microRNAs, the two labs were trying to understand which

213
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.229
genes were switching on and off at the time

214
00:13:07.479 --> 00:13:11.820
that the worm transitioned from one phase to its

215
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.000
to another phase, sort of from its early development

216
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.580
to its adult form. And they'd zoned in on,

217
00:13:19.609 --> 00:13:22.559
on two different genes, LIN 4 and Lin 14,

218
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.690
and they were sort of playing around with, um,

219
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:31.140
worms that had mutations in these genes. And they,

220
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.809
they'd figured out that there was some. Interactions, some

221
00:13:35.809 --> 00:13:39.770
influence between these 22 genes, and then when they

222
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.210
looked at this LIN 4 gene, they found that

223
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.979
it, it didn't code for a protein. In fact,

224
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:51.909
it seemed to produce only short RNAs. And so

225
00:13:51.909 --> 00:13:54.820
they, they looked at these RNAs and then sort

226
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.750
of came this eureka moment where they managed to

227
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.080
align that short RNA to a region. Of the

228
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.239
messenger RNA for this other gene, Lin 14, and

229
00:14:07.239 --> 00:14:10.239
they found that it would stick onto it a

230
00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:14.969
little bit like sort of molecular Velcro. That there's

231
00:14:14.969 --> 00:14:19.659
certain pairing rules between these nucleotides. So, uh, a

232
00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:21.979
C and a G will always match and an

233
00:14:21.979 --> 00:14:24.020
A and a U will always match. So they

234
00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:28.330
found that this LIN 4 gene would stick on

235
00:14:28.739 --> 00:14:32.469
to LIN 14. And then they, they came to

236
00:14:32.469 --> 00:14:35.669
the realization that. This was maybe a new way

237
00:14:35.669 --> 00:14:40.109
that genes were being controlled. That some genes basically

238
00:14:40.109 --> 00:14:43.830
work by interfering with the production of the protein

239
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.669
and, and, and the idea from their, their discovery

240
00:14:46.669 --> 00:14:50.780
was that this short RNA stuck onto the messenger

241
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:56.330
RNA. And blocked that protein from being produced. And

242
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.119
it turned out that this was a really key

243
00:14:58.119 --> 00:15:02.250
event that this LIN 14 uh protein had to

244
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.919
be switched off in order for the adult animal

245
00:15:05.919 --> 00:15:09.969
to uh to, to develop. And so this, this,

246
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.609
this was basically a, a new type of gene

247
00:15:12.609 --> 00:15:15.409
activity control that had been er discovered.

248
00:15:16.979 --> 00:15:19.619
And so also for people to understand a little

249
00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:24.330
bit better, how we learn more about microRNAs. What

250
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.229
are the, perhaps the main tools that we have

251
00:15:27.229 --> 00:15:29.619
at our disposal to learn about them?

252
00:15:30.599 --> 00:15:35.280
So we can um detect the presence of microRNAs

253
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.159
uh within cells. We can um analyze RNA levels

254
00:15:40.159 --> 00:15:44.119
using a variety of experimental and sort of uh

255
00:15:44.119 --> 00:15:48.219
biochemical techniques quite, quite easily. And then we can

256
00:15:48.219 --> 00:15:51.580
begin to map these into the genome. So we've

257
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:56.020
been able over time to identify all of the

258
00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:00.270
microRNAs that are present within different organisms, including humans.

259
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.659
So you can, you can count the number of

260
00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:07.219
these microRNA genes and you can learn on which

261
00:16:07.219 --> 00:16:11.710
chromosomes they are in. And um you can also

262
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:16.159
study how they're produced. So there's a specific pathway

263
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.590
in terms of the, the sort of the reading,

264
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.640
uh, of the, the microA gene. The production of

265
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.559
the initial precursor molecule, the, the cutting down phases,

266
00:16:26.599 --> 00:16:29.880
all of these little steps have been worked out

267
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.159
all the way through to the point where we

268
00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:36.359
know how the microRNA finds its target and sort

269
00:16:36.359 --> 00:16:40.549
of locks on with the assistance of another protein

270
00:16:40.549 --> 00:16:43.919
that is called argonaut. And then even after the

271
00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:47.419
microA has done its job. Um, WE, we've learned

272
00:16:47.669 --> 00:16:50.270
how the, what happens to the mic RNA afterwards,

273
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:53.179
it's sort of end of life, uh, process.

274
00:16:54.049 --> 00:16:57.570
Mhm. And uh just to perhaps take a step

275
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.729
back, do we know how microRNA's evolved? I mean,

276
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.439
from an evolutionary perspective, where do they come from?

277
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.770
Yeah, this, this is a great question. So what

278
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:15.130
we've learned is that microRNA's evolved uh at the

279
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:21.420
very start of complex life on Earth. So we've

280
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:26.660
been able to trace microRNA genes throughout all of

281
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.939
the sort of evolutionary history of, of animals to

282
00:17:29.939 --> 00:17:33.569
some extremely simple, just a few sort of cells,

283
00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:41.180
uh, all together. And virtually every organism, every animal

284
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.459
organism that we've studied has some collection of microRNAs.

285
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.199
So what we think has happened is that microRNAs

286
00:17:49.199 --> 00:17:53.359
were really fundamental and critical to the development of

287
00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:56.560
complex life on Earth, simply because they were, they

288
00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.000
were present in some of the most simple forms

289
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.439
of life. And as organisms get more complex, we

290
00:18:05.439 --> 00:18:11.400
see the emergence of additional microRNA genes. So they've

291
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.180
looked, for example, at the uh animals that are

292
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.800
have this kind of bilateral body plan, which is

293
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.280
one of the, uh, you know, one of the

294
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:25.069
simplest uh advances in, in animal complexity. And there's

295
00:18:25.069 --> 00:18:27.829
a big stack of microRNA genes that are present

296
00:18:27.829 --> 00:18:30.109
in those animals. And then if you look later

297
00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:33.829
as vertebrates begin to evolve, you see another group

298
00:18:33.829 --> 00:18:36.900
of microRNA genes that were present at that point

299
00:18:37.189 --> 00:18:41.750
when vertebrate animals evolved, and then further still with

300
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.660
mammals and with placental mammals. So it seems that

301
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:50.260
the presence of microRNA genes are critical to the

302
00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.729
evolution of complex life on Earth.

303
00:18:54.699 --> 00:18:57.449
Mhm. But, but then, uh, let me just ask

304
00:18:57.449 --> 00:19:03.170
you then, they were already present in unicellular organisms

305
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:03.680
or

306
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:09.010
not? So they have been detected in unicellular organisms.

307
00:19:09.689 --> 00:19:12.609
But uh the numbers that seem to be present

308
00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:17.530
in multicellular organisms are, are much higher. We've also

309
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:21.770
detected microRNAs in plants, so they're not unique to

310
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:27.310
animals and in fungi. And in algae. But, and

311
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.880
this is the interesting thing, the the microRNA systems

312
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.699
in these other kingdoms of life are slightly different.

313
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.719
So what it looks like is uh an example

314
00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:43.439
of convergent evolution where these different kingdoms, these different

315
00:19:43.439 --> 00:19:45.920
branches of life have all come up with the

316
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.400
same solution. They've sort of come up with a

317
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:53.400
microRNA system to work within the genome. To, to

318
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.859
carry out critical functions. And so that, I suppose,

319
00:19:56.959 --> 00:20:00.859
leads to. The question, what is it that microRNAs

320
00:20:00.859 --> 00:20:04.380
do? What is, what are they needed for? What's

321
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.619
wrong with our genome that it needs this, this

322
00:20:07.619 --> 00:20:11.180
other system? Yeah. So the answer to that is

323
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:17.099
that gene activity is, is quite noisy and random.

324
00:20:18.339 --> 00:20:21.979
So the, the example I've been giving earlier sort

325
00:20:21.979 --> 00:20:26.060
of doesn't quite capture that as genes are switched

326
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.579
on and off, there's a an element of randomness

327
00:20:29.579 --> 00:20:34.699
in, in how much messenger RNA gets produced. Some

328
00:20:34.699 --> 00:20:39.689
genes are noisier than others, but generally speaking, there's

329
00:20:39.689 --> 00:20:42.780
a, there's a randomness, what we would call stochastic.

330
00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:48.540
Um, PRODUCTION of gene activity. So microA are thought,

331
00:20:48.589 --> 00:20:50.910
they're not their sort of first job or the

332
00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:55.339
first reason that they've evolved is a stabilizing system

333
00:20:55.949 --> 00:21:01.449
for noisy genes. So basically, microRNA's, when they're produced,

334
00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:05.569
they stick onto the messenger RNA and they reduce

335
00:21:05.569 --> 00:21:09.750
protein levels. And this seems to be a negative

336
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:14.949
feedback system that is ideally suited to noisy genes

337
00:21:14.949 --> 00:21:20.069
to sort of randomness within gene activity. So microRNA

338
00:21:20.069 --> 00:21:22.390
sort of work as this almost like a cooling

339
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.469
system for the genome. They, they reduce the production

340
00:21:26.469 --> 00:21:30.739
of proteins and and that helps reduce the noise

341
00:21:30.739 --> 00:21:35.390
of, of gene expression. So that's sort of their,

342
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.719
their number one job. But the other thing, and

343
00:21:38.719 --> 00:21:41.750
this comes back to what I said about organism

344
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:46.239
complexity, it seems that microRNAs are able to create

345
00:21:46.239 --> 00:21:52.619
or contribute to more complex organisms. Um, WHAT we

346
00:21:52.619 --> 00:21:56.369
think is happening is that microRNAs can take our

347
00:21:56.369 --> 00:22:01.540
list of protein coding genes and produce much richer,

348
00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:06.459
more complex patterns of gene activity. Than would be

349
00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:10.469
possible without them. So they're sort of taking the,

350
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.910
the, the thousands of protein coding genes and by

351
00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:19.030
acting on them, increasing and decreasing, they, they create

352
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:24.550
a richness. Of gene activity within cells that that

353
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.750
contributes to more complex organisms that that organisms can

354
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.630
be uh more complex, produce more different types of,

355
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.790
of cells that that uh is is is the

356
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:40.020
essence of, of complex organisms. So these are those

357
00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.260
two really important jobs. So first of all, kind

358
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.239
of creating more stability with gene activity, and secondly,

359
00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:51.459
creating more complex, rich genetic uh activity that that

360
00:22:51.459 --> 00:22:53.339
contributes to organism complexity.

361
00:22:54.449 --> 00:22:57.560
Great. And so, just for people to understand, how

362
00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:02.000
are microRNAs made? I mean, are they produced in

363
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.689
the cells themselves or are they narrated in some

364
00:23:05.689 --> 00:23:07.400
way? How does it work?

365
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.780
So microRNAs are, are produced from a, through a

366
00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.260
series of biochemical processes. The the first part is

367
00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.079
essentially the reading of the microRNA gene. Now some

368
00:23:19.079 --> 00:23:21.599
of our microRNA genes uh sort of sit on

369
00:23:21.599 --> 00:23:25.150
their own, uh, in the genome, and other microRNA

370
00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.430
genes are sort of slightly kind of embedded within

371
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.280
protein coding genes. So if we take the second

372
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.750
example, For the reading of a protein coding gene,

373
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:39.150
DNA opens, it unzips, and we get the first

374
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:43.300
processed transcription. We get this production of this long

375
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.630
RNA copy of the gene. And then that begins

376
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:50.430
to get cut up. So many microRNAs are actually

377
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:56.069
sort of sitting in that first early form of

378
00:23:56.069 --> 00:24:00.839
RNA and then there's an enzyme within the the

379
00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:06.020
nucleus called Drosha. That cuts out and starts to

380
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.939
shorten the original RNA to a, to a shorter

381
00:24:09.939 --> 00:24:12.979
form. So, that's the, the sort of first step.

382
00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:16.260
So there's the transcription by an enzyme called RNA

383
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:22.410
polymerase. That produces a primary microRNA and then this

384
00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:26.000
enzyme Droser makes a little cut. And then it

385
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.800
begins its journey. So the pre microRNA now moves

386
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.290
out of the nucleus. Into the cytosol. So it's

387
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:38.280
now heading towards the ribosome, the protein production factory.

388
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:44.089
Now it encounters a second enzyme called yer. Dyser

389
00:24:44.089 --> 00:24:49.670
snips. The precursor again, and you end up with

390
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:54.109
essentially two sort of strands of RNA about 20

391
00:24:54.109 --> 00:24:59.489
nucleotides each. Mhm. One of those strands gets selected

392
00:24:59.489 --> 00:25:02.770
to be the sort of the final microRNA and

393
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:08.180
it gets bound to this protein called argonaut. The

394
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.819
micronA bound to Argonaut now begins to search for

395
00:25:11.819 --> 00:25:16.500
targets, so it's really basically looking for messenger RNAs

396
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.540
that have a little region of complementarity to the

397
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.819
sequence of the microRNA. And when it finds enough

398
00:25:23.819 --> 00:25:28.630
complementarity, it'll stick on to the messenger RNA. And

399
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.180
this is when it really now does its job.

400
00:25:31.469 --> 00:25:34.189
So once a microRNA is locked onto a messenger

401
00:25:34.189 --> 00:25:38.520
RNA, it can either prevent the translation of the

402
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.589
messenger RNA. So it kind of prevents the messenger

403
00:25:41.589 --> 00:25:44.589
RNA being fed through the ribosome. So it's a

404
00:25:44.589 --> 00:25:46.719
little bit like if you imagine tying a knot

405
00:25:46.949 --> 00:25:50.469
in your shoelace, you can't thread the shoelace now

406
00:25:50.469 --> 00:25:54.359
through the boot. So with our microRNA locked onto

407
00:25:54.359 --> 00:25:57.400
our messenger RNA, the messenger RNA can't get threaded

408
00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.030
through the ribosome. We can't build our protein. The

409
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.270
other thing that can happen is that when the

410
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.550
microRNA locks onto the messenger RNA, it causes the

411
00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:11.589
active degradation of the messenger RNA sort of enzymes

412
00:26:11.589 --> 00:26:13.630
are attracted to this and they start to chew

413
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.510
up the messenger RNA. But either way, you get

414
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.709
a reduction in in protein levels of the messenger

415
00:26:20.709 --> 00:26:22.829
RNA that was targeted by the microRNA.

416
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:27.030
Mhm. But I mean, then their activity is also

417
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:32.000
always targeting MRNA molecules, right? Or do they have

418
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.959
some other functions?

419
00:26:35.189 --> 00:26:39.510
Principally, it's targeting mRNA. There are, there are one

420
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:44.069
or two other examples where we've discovered microRNAs doing

421
00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:48.069
something slightly different. There there's one or two studies

422
00:26:48.069 --> 00:26:50.430
that show them working in the nucleus, sort of

423
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.739
at the point of transcription, but by and large,

424
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:57.349
where microRNA's work is out in the cytoplasm at

425
00:26:57.349 --> 00:27:01.229
that step just before the translation of a protein,

426
00:27:01.239 --> 00:27:03.310
the, the building of the amino acid chain.

427
00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:06.920
Great. So, in the book at a certain point,

428
00:27:06.969 --> 00:27:13.050
you talk about how microRNA's confer robustness to biological

429
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.689
systems. What does that mean? Could you explain that?

430
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.790
Yes, so this comes back a little bit to

431
00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:22.739
what I was saying around how gene activity is

432
00:27:22.739 --> 00:27:27.099
quite noisy. So what microRNAs are doing is this

433
00:27:27.099 --> 00:27:30.780
sort of negative feedback where they, they dampen down

434
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:35.109
the normal natural noise of gene activity within the

435
00:27:35.109 --> 00:27:40.359
cell, and this seems to allow. Cells to, to

436
00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:43.000
perform better. Cells don't, don't do very well with

437
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.349
sort of noisy gene activity, so this is a,

438
00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:50.640
a dampening system. The second thing that microRNAs do

439
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.780
is seem to stabilize the gene programs that keep

440
00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.000
cells the way they are. So for example, you

441
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.619
know, a brain cell wants to remain a brain

442
00:28:01.619 --> 00:28:05.170
cell, it doesn't want to drift into other some

443
00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:09.609
uh cell type. So by producing a certain set

444
00:28:09.609 --> 00:28:16.359
of microRNA genes all the time, Cells maintain their

445
00:28:16.819 --> 00:28:20.920
their correct molecular environment that allows them to do

446
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.589
the job they're supposed to be doing. And this

447
00:28:23.599 --> 00:28:26.869
is what we've seen when we study microRNAs switching

448
00:28:26.869 --> 00:28:29.989
on and off as organisms develop. We find that

449
00:28:29.989 --> 00:28:33.270
there are groups of microRNAs that switch on at

450
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:36.550
certain phases of development, for example, as cells are

451
00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:40.300
dividing. And then as cells become more and more

452
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:46.060
specialized towards their sort of final features, other microRNAs

453
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:50.709
switch on that then keep those gene programs stable

454
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.459
and reduce sort of fluctuation, and this seems to

455
00:28:54.459 --> 00:28:56.939
be really important for that sort of robustness of

456
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.459
of cell type and function.

457
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:04.939
Mhm. And why do you call these molecules nature's

458
00:29:04.939 --> 00:29:06.939
fine-tuning system?

459
00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:10.569
Yeah, so I think the, the fine tuning comes

460
00:29:10.569 --> 00:29:15.140
from this idea that that microRNA's are, if you

461
00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:21.119
like, gently adjusting gene activity. So by, by certain

462
00:29:21.119 --> 00:29:25.829
types of experiment, we've learned that microRNAs don't absolutely

463
00:29:25.829 --> 00:29:29.150
flatten the level of gene activity. They actually reduce

464
00:29:29.479 --> 00:29:32.689
the level of their, their target protein by about

465
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.599
10 to 20%. So this is a sort of

466
00:29:36.599 --> 00:29:41.239
a a gentle adjustment of gene activity and so

467
00:29:41.239 --> 00:29:44.520
this gives rise to the idea of fine tuning.

468
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.540
But the fine tuning idea also relates to this

469
00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:53.829
sense that microRNAs are a little bit like conducting

470
00:29:53.829 --> 00:29:58.020
the molecular orchestra. This is one of the, the,

471
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.050
the phrases that's been used in the, in the

472
00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:04.050
past, so. One of the features of microRNA's is

473
00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:08.800
there isn't just one microRNA for one target. Each

474
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.530
individual micronA can actually stick onto dozens of targets.

475
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:19.349
So a single microRNA sort of controls the levels

476
00:30:19.349 --> 00:30:22.150
of lots and lots of messenger RNAs. So this

477
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.630
gives you a little bit more sense of, of

478
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.869
kind of conducting this molecular orchestra, or, or kind

479
00:30:27.869 --> 00:30:29.780
of a fine tuning system.

480
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.800
And so, in the ways they regulate the correct

481
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.229
proteins and amounts of each of them, I mean,

482
00:30:39.439 --> 00:30:42.040
how do they know, I mean, of course, I

483
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.270
don't want to anthropomorphize things very much here, but

484
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.959
how do they know where they get the information

485
00:30:47.959 --> 00:30:50.959
that they should regulate this or that kind of

486
00:30:50.959 --> 00:30:53.040
protein and the amounts?

487
00:30:53.719 --> 00:30:57.410
So the the particular protein they regulate is is

488
00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:02.449
really dictated by the sequence of the microRNA. So

489
00:31:03.089 --> 00:31:07.250
a microRNA will stick on to various different messenger

490
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:10.369
RNAs according to to the sequence. But in terms

491
00:31:10.369 --> 00:31:13.920
of knowing when to be made. So a lot

492
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:19.079
of microRNAs are actually made as the protein coding

493
00:31:19.079 --> 00:31:23.900
genes are also being transcribed. So when a protein

494
00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.130
coding gene is switched on, it's going to produce

495
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:31.219
an amount of a microRNA alongside it. So you

496
00:31:31.219 --> 00:31:33.260
sort of have the production of the protein coding

497
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.770
gene and then the microRNA is also being produced

498
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:41.199
to regulate that same gene. Now that's not true

499
00:31:41.199 --> 00:31:44.630
for all microRNAs. There are some micronNAs that sit

500
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:47.310
sort of as their own little island within our

501
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:50.869
genome. They have their own switch on and switch

502
00:31:50.869 --> 00:31:54.050
off signals that regulate them, but a lot of

503
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:57.469
microRNAs are being produced at the same time that

504
00:31:57.469 --> 00:32:00.150
we're transcribing the protein coding genes.

505
00:32:00.859 --> 00:32:05.170
Mhm. And what happens to them after they've finished

506
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:08.089
their job? I mean, what happens to the microRNA

507
00:32:08.089 --> 00:32:08.920
molecules?

508
00:32:09.449 --> 00:32:12.520
So this is actually something we don't know in

509
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:17.130
all that much detail, and it seems that individual

510
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:20.890
microRNA's, that sort of their end of life is

511
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:24.280
very specific to the cell type that we're studying,

512
00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:27.209
the, the type of process, what signals have been

513
00:32:27.209 --> 00:32:33.099
sent at a particular time. So there is evidence

514
00:32:33.099 --> 00:32:37.859
that the microRNA stays within the complex with this

515
00:32:37.859 --> 00:32:41.530
argonnat protein, and then the argonautt protein gets destroyed

516
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.189
within the cell, sort of gets turned over, and

517
00:32:44.189 --> 00:32:47.849
as that turnover process occurs, the microa gets released

518
00:32:47.849 --> 00:32:50.859
and then it sort of chewed up by enzymes

519
00:32:50.859 --> 00:32:54.099
within the cell. But there's also some evidence that

520
00:32:54.099 --> 00:32:57.880
there are other types of um mechanism that exists

521
00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:03.060
within cells that directly downgrade the microRNA after a

522
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.060
period of time. But we, we're still really at

523
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.619
a fairly early stage in understanding what are the

524
00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:12.380
rules with what happens to a microRNA after it's

525
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:13.140
done its job.

526
00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.410
Mhm. So, going back to evolution for a minute,

527
00:33:18.819 --> 00:33:22.619
uh, I mean, because of their functions, because they

528
00:33:22.619 --> 00:33:26.459
basically participate in the regulating the amounts of different

529
00:33:26.459 --> 00:33:31.489
kinds of proteins, do they participate in evolution itself?

530
00:33:31.599 --> 00:33:34.805
I mean, do they facilitate Tailor it because uh

531
00:33:35.155 --> 00:33:39.194
that way perhaps cells don't have to evolve completely

532
00:33:39.194 --> 00:33:44.104
new protein coding genes and do they participate in

533
00:33:44.104 --> 00:33:45.545
that as well or not?

534
00:33:46.194 --> 00:33:48.675
Absolutely. And, and I think you've just made the

535
00:33:48.675 --> 00:33:52.469
point really clearly there that It's quite difficult to

536
00:33:52.469 --> 00:33:57.630
evolve completely new protein coding genes, and even a

537
00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:01.760
single error or change in a in a nucleotide

538
00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.239
can can have a sort of catastrophic effect on

539
00:34:05.239 --> 00:34:08.188
a protein. This is why we have human diseases

540
00:34:08.188 --> 00:34:10.790
that are caused by sort of single mutations in

541
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:17.050
DNA. But microRNAs can evolve relatively easily. The the

542
00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:20.149
sort of requirements for a new microRNA gene are

543
00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:23.790
are are relatively easy to meet. So essentially you

544
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.188
just have to have an RNA that can form

545
00:34:26.188 --> 00:34:30.129
this sort of special hairpin structure. And RNAs are

546
00:34:30.129 --> 00:34:35.208
naturally quite good at doing this. So it's true

547
00:34:35.208 --> 00:34:37.679
that within our genomes, the, the production of new

548
00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:42.370
microRNAs seems to Uh, be found around the time

549
00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:47.199
of key evolutionary steps. And from a biochemistry point

550
00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:50.208
of view, it's a lot easier to generate a

551
00:34:50.208 --> 00:34:53.929
new microRNA gene than a new protein coding gene.

552
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:59.249
And one of the interesting facts about genetic complexity

553
00:34:59.249 --> 00:35:02.428
and and microRNAs is that if we look at

554
00:35:02.428 --> 00:35:06.138
the number of genes, protein coding genes that we

555
00:35:06.138 --> 00:35:10.779
have humans, it's about 20,000. This is actually the

556
00:35:10.779 --> 00:35:15.019
same number of protein coding genes as that simple

557
00:35:15.309 --> 00:35:20.009
worm, the C. ELEGANS worm that Ambrose and Ruin

558
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:24.639
discovered microRNAs and got the Nobel Prize for. So

559
00:35:24.639 --> 00:35:29.229
clearly Organism complexity is not a simple function of

560
00:35:29.229 --> 00:35:33.669
the number of protein coding genes. It's the other

561
00:35:33.669 --> 00:35:37.590
elements within our genome that take these sort of

562
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:42.739
protein coding genes and adjust how they're being used

563
00:35:42.739 --> 00:35:45.300
to create all of the complexity that we see

564
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.820
in, in life forms, such as, such as humans.

565
00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.790
And microRNAs are a really key part. And so

566
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:52.389
if you, if you were to sort of draw

567
00:35:52.389 --> 00:35:57.649
a graph of increasing organism complexity. With sort of

568
00:35:57.649 --> 00:36:00.770
single cell organisms at at one end and say

569
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.040
humans at the other end, then the number of

570
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.550
protein codeine genes wouldn't. Be very proportional to complexity

571
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:09.189
and, and, you know, as I said, the C

572
00:36:09.189 --> 00:36:11.909
elegans has about the same number of protein codeine

573
00:36:11.909 --> 00:36:14.030
genes as we do. But if you were to

574
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:18.679
plot microRNA abundance, you see a much more linear

575
00:36:18.679 --> 00:36:22.649
relationship. So as organisms are getting more complex, You

576
00:36:22.649 --> 00:36:26.600
see more microRNA genes. So microRNAs are, are thought

577
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.729
to, to, to produce greater complexity than would be

578
00:36:29.729 --> 00:36:32.169
possible simply through protein coding genes.

579
00:36:33.189 --> 00:36:36.790
It's very interesting that you establish that parallel between

580
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:39.919
us humans and C elegant in terms of the

581
00:36:39.919 --> 00:36:43.639
total number of protein coding genes. So does that

582
00:36:43.639 --> 00:36:48.149
mean that microRNAs also play a role in speciation

583
00:36:48.149 --> 00:36:52.510
because of with them, we don't really need different

584
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:56.340
and or more protein protein gene code uh gene

585
00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.659
coding, uh sorry, protein coding genes, but Uh, the

586
00:37:00.659 --> 00:37:04.100
same, or the sim similar genes can be expressed

587
00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.290
differently in different species.

588
00:37:06.899 --> 00:37:09.729
Yes, so what, what we do have evidence for

589
00:37:09.729 --> 00:37:14.500
is that um new microRNAs are contributing to, to

590
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.139
speciation, and this, this is quite difficult, as you

591
00:37:17.139 --> 00:37:19.739
can imagine, to prove in, in some species like

592
00:37:19.739 --> 00:37:23.500
humans, but if you use uh simpler organisms then

593
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.590
it's possible and one of the. Uh, ORGANISMS that's

594
00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:29.750
been studied is a, a, a certain type of

595
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.989
fish, a cilid fish, and they are a great

596
00:37:32.989 --> 00:37:36.790
model for studying speciation, and they found that there

597
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:41.110
are microRNA genes that are almost certainly responsible for

598
00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:44.590
contributing to, to the, the, the separation, the, the

599
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:47.709
development of, of new species, but we don't have

600
00:37:47.709 --> 00:37:50.870
so much evidence for that, uh, in humans. What

601
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.949
we do see in humans is the presence of

602
00:37:53.949 --> 00:37:58.989
microRNA genes that are not in any other. Organism.

603
00:37:59.629 --> 00:38:02.949
So there are some human specific microRNAs. There are

604
00:38:02.949 --> 00:38:06.750
also some great apes specific micronAs and then there

605
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:12.840
are some primates specific microRNAs. And while we haven't

606
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.679
yet figured out what these microRNAs that are unique

607
00:38:15.679 --> 00:38:18.439
to humans are doing, what we do know is

608
00:38:18.439 --> 00:38:21.040
most of them are present and made in the

609
00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.370
brain. And so this is very interesting to think

610
00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:28.669
about that, that microRNAs may have contributed to some

611
00:38:28.669 --> 00:38:33.500
of our unique to human uh uh intellectual brain

612
00:38:33.909 --> 00:38:34.590
functions.

613
00:38:36.179 --> 00:38:38.469
So, yeah, we're going to get a little bit

614
00:38:38.469 --> 00:38:41.879
more into that in a second, but what role

615
00:38:41.879 --> 00:38:46.169
do they play specifically in human development?

616
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:52.280
So microRNAs begin working from the moment of fertilization.

617
00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.760
In fact, there's studies showing that some microRNAs are

618
00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:00.639
actually carried within the cell, within the egg, and

619
00:39:00.639 --> 00:39:03.879
within the sperm cell that are basically getting to

620
00:39:03.879 --> 00:39:08.149
work at the first moment of fertilization. And as

621
00:39:08.399 --> 00:39:11.520
the fertilized egg is beginning to divide and divide,

622
00:39:11.639 --> 00:39:15.719
you see certain types of microns switching on. And

623
00:39:15.719 --> 00:39:19.000
then switching off again later. So we've, we've sort

624
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.679
of mapped out sets of microRNAs that are critical

625
00:39:22.679 --> 00:39:28.000
to the very earliest stages of human embryo development

626
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.439
and the development of other mammals and other organisms.

627
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.399
So microns get to work really early, switching on

628
00:39:36.399 --> 00:39:40.719
and off and and controlling the early gene programs

629
00:39:40.719 --> 00:39:43.199
that are critical for organism development.

630
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.239
And so, uh, I mean, I hope I didn't

631
00:39:47.239 --> 00:39:51.000
understand this wrong, but do they also contribute or

632
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.159
play a role in cell differentiation and I mean,

633
00:39:54.199 --> 00:39:57.120
the production of the different kinds of cells that

634
00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.239
we can find in our bodies and the bodies

635
00:39:59.239 --> 00:40:01.600
of other animals and organisms?

636
00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:07.719
Yeah, absolutely. So every phase of organism development involves

637
00:40:07.719 --> 00:40:12.610
actions of microRNAs. So we have identified microRNAs that

638
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:16.090
are important for cell division, for controlling the the

639
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:20.870
processes during cell division, but also the differentiation and

640
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:24.050
migration of those cells. So as, as we are

641
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:27.810
dividing and growing, cells begin to move into different

642
00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:33.169
places, they begin to develop more specialized features. And

643
00:40:33.169 --> 00:40:36.590
at each stage, microRNAs are switching on and off

644
00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:40.300
and controlling the the gene programs that, that, you

645
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:45.260
know, drive cells towards certain type of uh function

646
00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:49.080
and, and, and also their place within the organism

647
00:40:49.449 --> 00:40:51.129
is all controlled by microRNA.

648
00:40:52.179 --> 00:40:55.860
That's very interesting. So they, because we have different

649
00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:59.739
kinds of microRNAs that might be active in different

650
00:40:59.739 --> 00:41:03.540
steps of cell differentiation, they partic, they have a

651
00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:07.850
big role in the coordination of gene expression,

652
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.419
correct? Yeah, absolutely, and, and they're working in, in

653
00:41:12.419 --> 00:41:15.449
different ways, so there isn't a single way, but,

654
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.620
uh, for example, some microRNAs are switched on to

655
00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:23.429
help shut down genes that are no longer needed

656
00:41:23.429 --> 00:41:27.629
beyond a certain stage of development. Whereas other microRNAs

657
00:41:27.629 --> 00:41:30.909
are producing more sort of subtle effects on on

658
00:41:30.909 --> 00:41:35.310
gene activity, increasing or decreasing levels of particular transcription

659
00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:40.310
factors and other genes that are critical as cells

660
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:44.429
begin to go down uh particular lines of differentiation

661
00:41:44.429 --> 00:41:46.469
into specialized cell types.

662
00:41:47.229 --> 00:41:49.429
Uh, COULD you give us perhaps a, a couple

663
00:41:49.429 --> 00:41:54.149
of examples of microRNAs that we know are unique

664
00:41:54.149 --> 00:41:57.709
to humans and perhaps uh the roles they play?

665
00:41:58.879 --> 00:42:01.620
So at the moment, the functions that we've been

666
00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:05.419
able to determine for microns are quite limited, but

667
00:42:05.419 --> 00:42:10.229
they're mainly around functions within the brain. What we've

668
00:42:10.229 --> 00:42:15.270
learned about unique to human microRNA's is that they're

669
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:20.030
at the moment expressed at quite low levels. Now,

670
00:42:20.389 --> 00:42:25.840
this is important because. MicroRNAs that are expressed only

671
00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.560
weekly within cells, sort of at low levels, probably

672
00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:34.469
don't have a very strong effect on gene activity.

673
00:42:35.689 --> 00:42:38.909
And what you tend to see is that these

674
00:42:38.909 --> 00:42:42.229
new, if you like, unique to human microAs are

675
00:42:42.229 --> 00:42:45.149
still expressed at quite a low level within the

676
00:42:45.149 --> 00:42:48.590
cell. We think over time, over evolutionary time, the

677
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:52.510
expression of some of these will increase and become

678
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:56.110
more and more important for that organism. So it's

679
00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:59.219
still quite early days to to know for certain

680
00:42:59.219 --> 00:43:02.020
what these unique to human microns are are doing,

681
00:43:02.229 --> 00:43:05.399
but it seems to be. Uh, IN terms of

682
00:43:05.399 --> 00:43:08.719
the brain, it seems to be to affect the

683
00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:11.429
number of cells that we have within the brain

684
00:43:11.919 --> 00:43:16.639
and the complexity of the brain cells themselves. So

685
00:43:16.639 --> 00:43:19.399
what we've learned from neuroscience over the last few

686
00:43:19.399 --> 00:43:23.260
years is that a number of cell types within

687
00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:28.629
the brain are, are more complex, more elaborate than

688
00:43:28.629 --> 00:43:33.610
we see in lower organisms. And it's possible that

689
00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:36.050
some of these unique to human microAs are, are

690
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:41.360
contributing to those very elaborate brain cells that are,

691
00:43:41.389 --> 00:43:44.929
are particularly important for some of the functions that

692
00:43:44.929 --> 00:43:46.239
are unique to humans.

693
00:43:46.689 --> 00:43:51.370
Mhm. And uh are there specific aspects of, let's

694
00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:55.929
say, brain physiology and brain brain cell structure that

695
00:43:55.929 --> 00:43:59.459
we already know microRNAs participate in?

696
00:44:00.189 --> 00:44:04.620
Yeah, there are actually dozens of examples where we've

697
00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:08.689
learned in really great detail what the microRNA is

698
00:44:08.699 --> 00:44:12.379
is doing, what its target is, and by targeting

699
00:44:12.379 --> 00:44:15.899
a particular protein coding gene, how that's affecting the

700
00:44:15.899 --> 00:44:19.659
structure of brain cells. So one of the best

701
00:44:19.659 --> 00:44:23.820
understood functions of microna within the brain is is

702
00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:28.300
controlling the contact points between one brain cell and

703
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.830
another. So if you imagine a cell within the

704
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:36.790
brain. It receives information from other brain cells. It

705
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:39.149
talks to other brain cells at these little points

706
00:44:39.149 --> 00:44:43.060
we call synapses. And the synapse is a little

707
00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:46.770
structure where the input from one cell, the axon

708
00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.939
comes into very close proximity to the surface of

709
00:44:50.939 --> 00:44:53.139
the next neuron. And on that surface there's a

710
00:44:53.139 --> 00:44:57.139
little protuberance we call a dendritic spine. And this

711
00:44:57.139 --> 00:44:59.860
is really where the input signal is coming from

712
00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:04.010
one brain cell to another. And microRNAs are busy

713
00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:09.399
inside that little structure, that dendrite. Producing the right

714
00:45:09.399 --> 00:45:13.520
shape and even adapting that shape according to the

715
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:17.520
signals that are received. So microRNAs, for example, contribute

716
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.439
to kind of building up the the spine, the

717
00:45:20.439 --> 00:45:24.639
dendrite, to make it bigger. That's thought to be

718
00:45:24.639 --> 00:45:28.520
important for plasticity within the brain, how we learn,

719
00:45:28.679 --> 00:45:31.639
how we remember. But there are also microns that

720
00:45:31.639 --> 00:45:36.469
contribute to these spines shrinking in size. And sometimes

721
00:45:36.469 --> 00:45:38.310
we want to remove things. We want to get

722
00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:43.070
rid of contact points between brain cells. And so

723
00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:46.939
there's a group of microRNAs that act on the

724
00:45:46.939 --> 00:45:51.110
structural elements, so proteins that actually produce these little

725
00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:55.340
shapes, but also the enzymes that work within them.

726
00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:59.030
So within one of these dendritic spines, you would

727
00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:04.040
have receptors on the surface for neurotransmitter. And the

728
00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:07.239
amount of those receptors on the surface would be

729
00:46:07.239 --> 00:46:12.169
controlled by the microRNAs within. And they've even learned

730
00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:15.370
that as one signal from one nerve cell to

731
00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:20.280
another passes through that structure, it stimulates the local

732
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:24.850
production of microRNAs that then regulate the levels of

733
00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:28.620
the proteins within that structure. So microRNAs are absolutely

734
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:33.510
critical for, first of all, Producing the structure of

735
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:39.229
brain cells, but also making them plastic, allowing synapses

736
00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:42.500
to change, to adjust to incoming information.

737
00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:46.939
Mhm. So, yeah, so they play an active, a

738
00:46:46.939 --> 00:46:51.260
very active role in cell communication, particularly in the

739
00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.290
brain, correct.

740
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:55.649
Yeah, I, there are very few processes, in fact,

741
00:46:55.719 --> 00:46:59.229
that haven't been. Linked in some way to to

742
00:46:59.229 --> 00:47:02.870
microRNAs. So as I was saying um with that

743
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:06.030
example earlier, the, the, the input from one cell

744
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.830
to another, the end of that is called the

745
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:12.260
axon terminal. So that also has some very specialized

746
00:47:12.479 --> 00:47:17.840
uh receptors and proteins, and those are also. Regulated

747
00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.989
by microRNAs. So almost all of the structures and

748
00:47:20.989 --> 00:47:24.870
functions of neurons are regulated to some degree by

749
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:28.360
microRNAs, and the estimate is that more than half

750
00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:31.120
of all of the genes within our genome are

751
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.879
regulated to some degree by microRNA, and there's there

752
00:47:34.879 --> 00:47:39.540
probably really isn't a process. Within the cell that

753
00:47:40.179 --> 00:47:42.540
isn't in some way impacted by microRNA.

754
00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.149
But you mentioned the receptors, uh, what about the

755
00:47:47.149 --> 00:47:51.330
neurotransmitters? I mean, do we know if microRNAs participate

756
00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:55.330
in any way in the production and release of

757
00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:58.169
neurotransmitters into the synapse or?

758
00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:02.689
So what we know is that the machinery that

759
00:48:02.689 --> 00:48:06.139
sort of loads up the neurotransmitter and has it

760
00:48:06.139 --> 00:48:09.449
ready to be released, the machinery for that process

761
00:48:09.449 --> 00:48:14.929
is also regulated by microRNAs. So the neurotransmitter molecule.

762
00:48:15.235 --> 00:48:17.205
It itself is a is a small, uh, is

763
00:48:17.205 --> 00:48:20.225
a small chemical, it's not a protein, so it's

764
00:48:20.225 --> 00:48:23.705
not directly regulated by micron, but the, the machinery

765
00:48:23.705 --> 00:48:27.064
that gets that neurotransmitter ready for release, all of

766
00:48:27.064 --> 00:48:31.344
those stages can be modulated and adjusted by microRNA.

767
00:48:32.739 --> 00:48:36.260
So perhaps talking now a little bit about some

768
00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:40.300
higher level processes we read in the domain of

769
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.760
psychology here. Do, do, do we know if they

770
00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.300
play role, specific roles in human cognition and, and

771
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.129
intelligence?

772
00:48:50.209 --> 00:48:52.399
Yes, so we've learned that there are a number

773
00:48:52.399 --> 00:48:56.159
of microRNAs that are important for the the structure

774
00:48:56.159 --> 00:49:00.290
of the brain, and as mentioned already, there are

775
00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:03.439
human specific microRNAs. So we're at the point where

776
00:49:03.439 --> 00:49:07.250
we're trying to learn what particular micronAs do in

777
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:11.969
terms of influence particular functions of the brain. And

778
00:49:11.969 --> 00:49:13.689
one of the ways that we can learn what

779
00:49:13.689 --> 00:49:17.439
they do is to to study a model organism,

780
00:49:17.729 --> 00:49:22.239
for example, a mouse. Where you can adjust the

781
00:49:22.239 --> 00:49:24.540
gene more easily than you could have, you know,

782
00:49:24.639 --> 00:49:26.669
you could do in a in a human model.

783
00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:32.520
And by studying microRNAs in these organisms, we've been

784
00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:36.110
able to learn what that microRNA does in terms

785
00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:39.629
of, of shaping brain function and, and shaping cognition.

786
00:49:39.659 --> 00:49:42.639
And so we've identified micronAs that are important for

787
00:49:42.639 --> 00:49:46.810
learning and memory. So perhaps an experiment. Interferes or

788
00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:50.010
removes the microRNA gene and you then find that

789
00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:54.169
uh the mouse can't learn properly to navigate through

790
00:49:54.169 --> 00:49:58.840
a maze. And we can integrate that understanding from

791
00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:03.530
how model organisms work to humans by looking for

792
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:10.399
human diseases in which we might find microRNA variation

793
00:50:10.399 --> 00:50:13.760
or mutation. And there have been a number of

794
00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:18.080
human brain diseases in which levels of particular microRNAs

795
00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:20.840
are found to be altered or there are perhaps

796
00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:24.290
a mutation in the gene for a particular microRNA

797
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:27.709
and then By understanding and studying that more, you

798
00:50:27.709 --> 00:50:29.270
can, you can learn a little bit about what

799
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:32.189
that micron a gene is normally doing based on

800
00:50:32.189 --> 00:50:34.709
what it's not doing in the disease setting.

801
00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:37.750
Uh, COULD you give us an example of one

802
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:40.750
of those brain diseases that we already know we

803
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:44.620
have some association with microRNA malfunction?

804
00:50:45.719 --> 00:50:49.290
Yeah, so, so far, most brain diseases that have

805
00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:52.120
been studied have have been found to have some

806
00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:55.639
kind of a microRNA link. Now that might be

807
00:50:55.639 --> 00:50:58.439
that the activity of microRNA genes is a little

808
00:50:58.439 --> 00:51:00.639
bit higher or a little bit lower, or it

809
00:51:00.639 --> 00:51:04.090
might be a sort of genetic variation in a

810
00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:07.870
microRNA gene that, that, that may be responsible for

811
00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:10.770
that brain condition. And so there are examples, for

812
00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:14.719
example, motor neuron disease. This is also known as

813
00:51:14.719 --> 00:51:18.530
ALS. So in motor neuron disease, people have identified

814
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:22.969
a microA that's particularly abundant in our motor neurons.

815
00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:26.050
They're the neurons that, that produce contraction of our

816
00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:30.479
skeletal muscle. And in those patients, they found that

817
00:51:30.479 --> 00:51:34.229
there were lower levels of this microRNA than normal,

818
00:51:34.399 --> 00:51:37.639
and that that seems to disturb gene activity in

819
00:51:37.639 --> 00:51:40.320
motor neurons, and that if you can kind of

820
00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:44.149
rescue that by putting the microRNA gene back in,

821
00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:47.360
then you can recover some of those functions, and

822
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.800
this is obviously experimental work, but, but has the

823
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.320
potential to go into humans in in the future.

824
00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:57.250
My area of most influence is around the brain

825
00:51:57.250 --> 00:52:01.540
disease epilepsy, and we've identified a number of microRNAs

826
00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:04.179
that are either at higher levels or lower levels

827
00:52:04.179 --> 00:52:08.340
than normal within the brain tissue that is triggering

828
00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:12.850
seizures, which are the defining characteristic of of epilepsy.

829
00:52:14.199 --> 00:52:16.770
And so at this point in time, is it

830
00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:21.500
already possible to use microRNAs for diagnosis?

831
00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:25.149
So at the moment, there are 1 or 2

832
00:52:25.149 --> 00:52:28.540
diagnostic tests out there, really in the cancer field,

833
00:52:28.629 --> 00:52:32.510
which are based on measuring levels of microRNAs, for

834
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:35.530
example, in the, in the blood. So it turns

835
00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:37.639
out that you can actually pick up, you can

836
00:52:37.639 --> 00:52:41.469
detect levels of dozens of different microRNAs within the

837
00:52:41.469 --> 00:52:45.439
blood. It's they're sort of normally circulating around and

838
00:52:46.209 --> 00:52:48.649
One of the features of microna is that in

839
00:52:48.649 --> 00:52:53.090
the adult organisms, some of them are expressed uniquely

840
00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:55.649
in different parts of the body. So there are

841
00:52:55.649 --> 00:52:58.370
a set of microna that are only ever made

842
00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:01.050
in the brain, microna that maybe only ever made

843
00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:05.409
in the liver. So if you can detect those

844
00:53:05.409 --> 00:53:08.770
microRNAs sort of circulating around in the blood, then

845
00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:11.250
it might be an indication that that organ or

846
00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:15.000
that system is, is malfunctioning. So at the moment,

847
00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:18.370
most of the tests that have begun to be

848
00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:22.010
used in, in the clinic are tests for microna

849
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:25.899
that have been linked to cancer. It's possible in

850
00:53:25.899 --> 00:53:27.580
the future, and this is one of the areas

851
00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:29.820
we're working on and and many others, that some

852
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:34.330
of the brain diseases that have a microRNA link

853
00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:37.550
may also have a sort of a blood signature.

854
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:41.659
Of the disease based on, on particular levels of

855
00:53:41.659 --> 00:53:44.530
microRNAs within the blood. We, we're still working on

856
00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:46.669
that and it's not all the way there yet,

857
00:53:46.899 --> 00:53:49.540
but that we're optimistic that that there will be

858
00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.459
a signal from brain diseases that can be picked

859
00:53:52.459 --> 00:53:55.699
up within the blood, um based on the combination

860
00:53:55.699 --> 00:53:57.330
of micronA levels that are there.

861
00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:03.350
And are there already any therapeutic applications for microRNAs?

862
00:54:03.409 --> 00:54:05.810
I mean, is it already possible to use them

863
00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:07.379
to treat diseases?

864
00:54:08.229 --> 00:54:11.949
Yeah, so interestingly enough, the search to develop a

865
00:54:11.949 --> 00:54:15.510
microRNA medicine began within just a few years of

866
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:20.030
discovering microRNA genes in humans. So microRNA genes were

867
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:21.709
first found in humans in the, in the year

868
00:54:21.709 --> 00:54:27.120
2000. And then in 2005, uh, a team discovered

869
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:30.229
that there was a, a virus, the virus for

870
00:54:30.229 --> 00:54:36.179
hepatitis C. Sort of hijacks one of the microRNAs

871
00:54:36.179 --> 00:54:38.260
that we normally make at high levels in our

872
00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:43.020
liver. So there's this micronic called microna 122. The

873
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:45.909
microns are all numbered rather than given a name

874
00:54:45.909 --> 00:54:49.469
like a traditional protein coding gene. So microny 122

875
00:54:49.469 --> 00:54:52.350
is uniquely made in the liver and the hepatitis

876
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:58.840
C virus. Replicates and infects liver cells by using.

877
00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:04.379
The, the microRNA within the liver. So shortly after

878
00:55:04.379 --> 00:55:06.739
that discovery was made, somebody thought, oh, hang on

879
00:55:06.739 --> 00:55:10.379
a sec, if we can block that liver microRNA

880
00:55:10.379 --> 00:55:14.479
maybe we can stop the virus from replicating. So,

881
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:17.929
this triggered um a program of research in a

882
00:55:17.929 --> 00:55:20.689
couple of different companies to try to develop a

883
00:55:20.689 --> 00:55:24.649
medicine that would block this microRNA to treat hepatitis

884
00:55:24.649 --> 00:55:28.510
C. And one of those medicines got all the

885
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:31.270
way through to human clinical trials, was shown to

886
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:34.659
be safe and effective. In fact, if you, if

887
00:55:34.659 --> 00:55:38.149
you injected this microRNA inhibitor, you could see levels

888
00:55:38.149 --> 00:55:42.090
of the hepatitis C virus dropping in these patients.

889
00:55:42.989 --> 00:55:47.830
So microRNAs. Have already, if you like, reached human

890
00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:52.080
clinical trials as, as medicines. However, we don't yet

891
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.310
have a medicine that is on the market for

892
00:55:55.310 --> 00:56:00.040
microRNA's. There are a number of companies around the

893
00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:04.669
world, biotechs and pharma companies that are designing either

894
00:56:04.669 --> 00:56:07.959
a microRNA inhibitor or a way to produce more

895
00:56:07.959 --> 00:56:12.080
of a particular microRNA to treat different diseases. In

896
00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.620
fact, there was a recent acquisition. Uh, FOR a

897
00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:20.060
heart-based treatment that was targeting a particular microRNA. So

898
00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:23.100
it's an area of very active research, but yeah,

899
00:56:23.219 --> 00:56:26.090
there is not yet a human micro medicine in,

900
00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:29.060
in regular use, but I'm optimistic that uh, that

901
00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:30.659
there will be in the, in the very near

902
00:56:30.659 --> 00:56:31.020
future.

903
00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:35.570
So, let me just ask you one final more

904
00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:40.729
general question. So, with microRNA's, uh, and together with

905
00:56:40.729 --> 00:56:44.530
perhaps some other forms of gene regulation that we've

906
00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:46.610
talked a little bit about at the beginning of

907
00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:51.120
our conversation and things related to epigenetics, for example,

908
00:56:51.409 --> 00:56:55.919
doesn't it complexify the picture of genetics in the,

909
00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:58.949
in the way that, OK, it's not just That

910
00:56:58.949 --> 00:57:03.149
we have particular protein coding genes that produce particular

911
00:57:03.149 --> 00:57:06.570
kinds of proteins. And so whatever genes we have

912
00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:10.709
are directly associated with particular kinds of phenotypes, but

913
00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.830
because we have molecules like microRNAs that participate in

914
00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:18.909
regulating particular uh the levels of particular kinds of

915
00:57:18.909 --> 00:57:22.350
proteins and they participate in things like, as we

916
00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:26.879
talked, as we talked about speciation. And, and, uh,

917
00:57:26.889 --> 00:57:29.370
development and stuff like that. I mean, the, the

918
00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:33.570
picture is much more complex than simply having uh

919
00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:37.889
the, the sequence of DNA that produces those specific

920
00:57:37.889 --> 00:57:41.010
kinds of proteins and that lead to a particular

921
00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:42.040
phenotype.

922
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:45.689
Right. Yeah, absolutely. I think over the last few

923
00:57:45.689 --> 00:57:50.489
decades, there's been a complete rethinking of how genomes

924
00:57:50.489 --> 00:57:54.469
are really working. That for, for, for a long

925
00:57:54.469 --> 00:57:57.510
period of time, the focus was exclusively on protein

926
00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:02.090
coding genes, and now we know that. The vast

927
00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:05.929
majority of the, the genome is, is active in

928
00:58:05.929 --> 00:58:09.469
a way. So. If you actually just look at

929
00:58:09.469 --> 00:58:12.580
the sequences that code for protein, it's only around

930
00:58:12.629 --> 00:58:15.590
2 to 3% of the, all of the DNA

931
00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:17.889
that we have, you know, so only 2 to

932
00:58:17.889 --> 00:58:21.600
3% of our genome is really dedicated to producing

933
00:58:21.909 --> 00:58:27.760
proteins. But 70, 80% of the remainder of the

934
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:32.120
genome is actively transcribing RNAs and these RNAs are

935
00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:35.719
influencing how genes are switched on and off, how

936
00:58:35.719 --> 00:58:39.320
they're red, how active they are, and microRNAs are

937
00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:42.560
a really important component of that one. A world

938
00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:47.120
of RNA, which is how our genomes really work,

939
00:58:47.159 --> 00:58:51.770
and in particular, how complex genomes, such as the

940
00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:56.409
human genome work. They're basically covered in these other

941
00:58:56.409 --> 00:59:00.080
types of genes that produce RNA. And that RNA

942
00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:02.520
doesn't cope with protein, it remains as RNA. It

943
00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:08.479
functions structurally, it functions as enzymes, regulating, fine tuning

944
00:59:08.479 --> 00:59:11.560
the activity of genes and, and giving rise to

945
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.439
the, to the wondrous sort of complexity of, of

946
00:59:14.439 --> 00:59:15.870
organisms such as ourselves.

947
00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:20.239
Great. So the book is again fine-tuning life, a

948
00:59:20.239 --> 00:59:24.399
guide to microRNAs, your genomes, master regulators. I'm leaving

949
00:59:24.399 --> 00:59:26.439
a link to it in the description of the

950
00:59:26.439 --> 00:59:30.040
interview, and Dr. Henschel, apart from the book, where

951
00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:32.739
can people find your work on the internet?

952
00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.239
So the easiest way to search for research by

953
00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:40.030
my lab would be to use PubMed, which is

954
00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:42.320
the, the, the main way that uh most of

955
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.199
the people in, in our field would search for

956
00:59:45.199 --> 00:59:49.100
new publications. So if you look up PubMed, um,

957
00:59:49.139 --> 00:59:51.100
and then you just, you would type in my

958
00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:54.459
name or my name plus microRNA, then you'll see

959
00:59:54.459 --> 00:59:57.100
some of the research that we've published. And equally,

960
00:59:57.139 --> 01:00:00.290
if you're interested in other aspects of microRNA research,

961
01:00:00.379 --> 01:00:03.100
you know, maybe microRNAs and and evolution, you can

962
01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:07.534
also find. That uh through PubMed. Also, the book

963
01:00:07.534 --> 01:00:10.415
itself contains a long list of references to all

964
01:00:10.415 --> 01:00:12.854
of the key points that we've discussed today, as

965
01:00:12.854 --> 01:00:15.885
well as some of the aspects of microRNAs that

966
01:00:15.895 --> 01:00:17.975
that um that that weren't covered. So there's a

967
01:00:17.975 --> 01:00:20.895
rich source of references and reading material within the

968
01:00:20.895 --> 01:00:21.175
book.

969
01:00:22.449 --> 01:00:25.229
Great. So, look, Doctor Henschel, I really love the

970
01:00:25.229 --> 01:00:27.770
book. I can't recommend it enough to my audience,

971
01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:30.709
so I hope that everyone after they've watched or

972
01:00:30.709 --> 01:00:33.219
listened to this interview, runs and buys the book.

973
01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:35.389
So thank you so much for the interview. It's

974
01:00:35.389 --> 01:00:36.860
been very fascinating.

975
01:00:37.189 --> 01:00:39.229
