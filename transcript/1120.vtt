00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:03.039
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:06.199
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.199 --> 00:00:08.949
today I'm joined for a second time by Doctor

4
00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.319
Pascal Boyer. He is the Henry Lus Professor of

5
00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.880
Individual and Collective memory in the departments of Psychology

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.030
and Anthropology at Washington University in Saint Louis. I'm

7
00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:22.825
Leaving a link to our first interview in the

8
00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:25.784
description down below and today we're going to talk

9
00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:31.975
about religions in the wild, ritualized behavior, ownership, psychology,

10
00:00:32.293 --> 00:00:37.185
victim devaluation, and other related topics. So Dr. Boyer,

11
00:00:37.264 --> 00:00:39.305
welcome to the show. It's a huge pleasure to

12
00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:39.854
have you back.

13
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.869
Thank you for having me, and it's a great

14
00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:45.159
pleasure to talk again. Thanks.

15
00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:48.930
OK, so, uh, I would like to uh to

16
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.479
start by asking you a little bit about religion,

17
00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:54.090
which was the topic we ended on in our

18
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.889
first interview. And just to go back to it

19
00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.880
a little bit, uh, now I have, uh, just

20
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.610
a couple more questions about it, 3 or 4

21
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.889
questions. So, first of all, what are religions in

22
00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:10.089
the wild? What does that mean and, and what

23
00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:12.209
can we learn from studying them?

24
00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:16.750
Well, this is a, um, a notion, you know,

25
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.150
we talked, we talk about wild traditions or religions

26
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.309
in the wild, um, which is a way of

27
00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:26.870
emphasizing a very strong difference, that important difference there

28
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.769
is between Uh, two kinds of religious traditions. So

29
00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:35.809
when we talk about religion in general people think

30
00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:41.220
of various things they're particularly familiar with like a

31
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.900
religion is something that has its specific doctrine. It

32
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.389
says things about the world. It has certain concerns

33
00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:49.470
like morality, the end of the world, you know,

34
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.709
that sort of thing. But also religion comes with

35
00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:57.220
a certain organization and with, uh, specialized personnel like,

36
00:01:57.269 --> 00:02:00.589
you know, Olama in, in, uh, in Islam or

37
00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:06.069
priests in, um, in Christian denominations or ministers. And,

38
00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:09.669
um, also there is a certain identity that follows

39
00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.190
from being a, uh, an adherent to a particular

40
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.059
religion, like you're a Christian or a Muslim. Um,

41
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.649
NOW, many of the world's religious traditions are not

42
00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:24.899
at all like that. Um, THEY don't have a,

43
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.240
uh, specified explicit, and, um, articulated doctrine. They have,

44
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.729
um, rather sort of, um, loosely organized sets of

45
00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:38.479
ideas, but more importantly, they don't have real, um,

46
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.679
organized specialists. Um, AND finally, they don't really have

47
00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:45.800
an identity. So I need to give examples because

48
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.110
otherwise that's very abstract, but, um, People who consult

49
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.470
a shaman in most of the cultures that have

50
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.240
shamanism or healing or practices of this kind, um,

51
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.630
go to see a specialist who is not a

52
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.990
member of an organization really in most cases, and

53
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.809
he's not really someone who Uh, whose function is

54
00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:13.669
to, um, broadcast the particular doctrine. Um, THESE people

55
00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.100
want to see a specialist that has, who has

56
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.889
a certain sort of technical ability to address particular

57
00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:25.059
problems. And in fact, if we look at religions,

58
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.979
religious traditions or in in the world in small

59
00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:34.539
scale societies before large scale societies and also before

60
00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:39.270
states and before literacy. We see that most of

61
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.500
these, uh, religious traditions were of that kind, that

62
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.470
is, um, individual specialists who address particular problems rather

63
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.619
than a doctrine sustained by organization. But also if

64
00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:56.610
you look at many of most of the um

65
00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.699
uh religious traditions in the modern world, you see

66
00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:03.220
that you still have a lot of what we

67
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.289
call wild traditions. So, uh, for example, in, um,

68
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.619
in Islam, you have a certain core of religious

69
00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.660
practice that's sustained by the doctrine, um, you know,

70
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.470
of Islam. And is sustained by the um by

71
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.510
the Oma, the specialists of those texts of Quran

72
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.549
and hadith, but you also have all sorts of

73
00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:32.989
practices like for example, you know, curing people's problems

74
00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:37.309
or misfortune by various kinds of magic. You also

75
00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:42.470
have, um, excuse me, saints that is particular, individuals

76
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.700
who have a particular power. Uh, TO address people's

77
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.730
problems or to solve conflicts and things like that.

78
00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:52.920
So you have these two things in parallel. Um,

79
00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:54.929
IF you look at Hinduism, of course it's an

80
00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:57.450
even better example in the sense that the religion,

81
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.660
the official religion, the doctrinal religion is not really

82
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.380
concerned with all the stuff people do that has

83
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.170
to do with minor gods or goddesses rather, um,

84
00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:12.049
witchcraft and things like that. So, um, the wild,

85
00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.160
uh, tradition is a bit like the weeds in

86
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.040
the gardens. Uh, YOU know, it's something that's always

87
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.690
there, that keeps growing there, and that is, uh,

88
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.429
quite important to people's religious activities. And to pursue

89
00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:30.109
this, you know, analogy with weeds, if you do

90
00:05:30.109 --> 00:05:32.459
any gardening, you know that weeds will come back,

91
00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:35.390
whatever you do to get rid of them. And

92
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.790
I think it's very much the same, except, you

93
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.140
know, we don't want to have the negative connotation

94
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:46.589
of weeds that's invasive and parasitic. Wild traditions, that

95
00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:49.899
is the idea that some specialists are personally different

96
00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:53.579
from other people, and that can help you address

97
00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:58.649
problems like Accidents, illness, misfortune in general, that is

98
00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:02.119
an idea that will come back whatever the doctrinal

99
00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:06.029
religion tries to do. In many, in many cases,

100
00:06:06.049 --> 00:06:11.649
the religious organizations try to disparage or derogate these

101
00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:16.970
wild traditions by saying that they're just magic or

102
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.559
there's popular superstition or things like that. And what

103
00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:24.640
we were trying to do, and when I say

104
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.450
we, is because this is a project that was

105
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:33.279
sustained by cooperation with Harvey Whitehouse at Oxford and

106
00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:37.369
Claire White, who is at California State University, Northridge,

107
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.119
we tried to say that we should systematically study

108
00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:45.359
those features of wild traditions, so to speak, that

109
00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:49.059
are not quite represented in doctrinal religion. So what

110
00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.059
we were trying to do was to sort of

111
00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:52.980
make the picture a big balance when we talk

112
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.619
about religion, to not focus just on the stuff

113
00:06:56.619 --> 00:07:00.420
we're familiar with, but also these um more sort

114
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:06.380
of, um, um, more sort of informal forms of

115
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.579
religious traditions.

116
00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:14.290
And are there specific features of religion that the

117
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.489
study of religions in the wild sheds light on?

118
00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:21.299
Yes, so the, the, the main thing, and that's

119
00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:25.000
the sort of um. Main concern of most of

120
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.679
those traditions is that they are there to, um,

121
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.399
to address misfortune. They're mostly about that. So if

122
00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.440
you talk about, um, doctrinal religions, you have all

123
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.839
sorts of concerns like, um, how is the world

124
00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:43.519
created, uh, where does evil come from? Where is

125
00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:46.779
the world going to, um, how can you, how

126
00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:50.119
could the soul be saved? That sort of preoccupation.

127
00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:53.329
Now, in wild, in what we call white traditions,

128
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.119
these are absolutely not the questions that are, um,

129
00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.660
of, um, that are, um, addressed. The main question

130
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.299
that is addressed repeatedly is why this, why did

131
00:08:05.299 --> 00:08:09.339
misfortune happen and in particular, why did this particular

132
00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:12.459
misfortune happen to this particular person at this particular

133
00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:15.730
time? Uh, SO the question is not, um, as

134
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.230
it, as it were, a sort of theodicy question,

135
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.950
you know, why is there bad stuff in the

136
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.130
world? It's more a question of why did I

137
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:27.130
get this particular, um, uh, disease, catch this particular

138
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.839
disease, why this person, uh, lose their jobs? Why

139
00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:36.130
is this, um, uh, person, uh, this, um, um,

140
00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:40.669
This person, why did my crops suffer from, you

141
00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.619
know, some light or something like that, whereas others

142
00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:48.508
did not. So it's intensely focused on explaining, but

143
00:08:48.508 --> 00:08:53.708
also, of course, palliating or avoiding this kind of

144
00:08:53.708 --> 00:08:55.068
misfortune. That's the main thing.

145
00:08:55.719 --> 00:08:59.200
Mhm. And I mean, more broadly speaking, how do

146
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.239
you approach the study of misfortune from a scientific

147
00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:06.450
anthropological perspective?

148
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.000
Well, the, the good thing about working on misfortune

149
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.119
is that there's a lot of it, uh, so

150
00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:14.309
it's not something that's, you know, we're not gonna

151
00:09:14.309 --> 00:09:17.619
run out of, uh, things to talk about. Um,

152
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.479
THE way we, we, we've decided to, to, to

153
00:09:20.479 --> 00:09:24.039
work on this was, um, of course, to study

154
00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:29.239
not misfortune, um, as such, but more, um, the,

155
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.969
the kinds of reactions people have, the psychology of

156
00:09:32.969 --> 00:09:36.159
explaining misfortune on the one hand, but also the

157
00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:39.159
way these things become what's called cultural products, that

158
00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:42.030
is common ideas within a group or a community.

159
00:09:42.359 --> 00:09:47.000
So, It's interesting that in, um, any place you

160
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.090
go in the world, people will have some kinds

161
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.440
of ideas about what brings about particular misfortune to

162
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.000
particular people. Um, SO one example could be it's

163
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.200
witchcraft. Uh, THAT means there's some other person in

164
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.200
your social environment who, whether they, they're aware of

165
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.919
it or not, um, is, is actually, uh, bringing

166
00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:13.039
misfortune to you in some mystical ways. Um, SO

167
00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:16.950
that's the, the witch. Um, THERE could be, um,

168
00:10:17.239 --> 00:10:20.909
another interpretation, which is that, um, you are, uh,

169
00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:23.469
sick or you, you, you lost your job or

170
00:10:23.469 --> 00:10:27.239
whatever because the gods or some spirits are not

171
00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:31.229
pleased with you, uh, because you've, um, committed some,

172
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.119
uh, you've, you, you've breached some taboo or violation

173
00:10:35.119 --> 00:10:38.359
or something like that, or for some reason you

174
00:10:38.359 --> 00:10:42.830
didn't perform sacrifices in a proper way. Uh, YOU

175
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.669
could have another explanation which is karma. That's a

176
00:10:45.669 --> 00:10:49.309
sort of popular theory in in many cultures that

177
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:56.590
somehow through, you know, accumulation of good deeds and

178
00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:00.469
bad deeds you've brought about some misfortune because your

179
00:11:00.469 --> 00:11:03.390
account is very much in the red in moral

180
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:07.109
terms. Um, YOU can have another, and in many

181
00:11:07.109 --> 00:11:10.070
modern societies, we have another kind of explanation, which

182
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.739
is that, uh, people bring misfortune onto themselves. Uh,

183
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.070
THAT is, you know, you were actually, you know,

184
00:11:18.229 --> 00:11:20.789
in a way you had it coming as as

185
00:11:20.789 --> 00:11:24.549
people would say. Um, SO, um, the idea would

186
00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:26.789
be that, well, you got mugged, uh, you know,

187
00:11:26.869 --> 00:11:28.830
in the street, but after all, what were you

188
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.549
doing walking out in that street, you know, late

189
00:11:31.549 --> 00:11:33.950
at night, you know that neighborhood is not very

190
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.960
safe. Uh, THAT'S the kind of explanation we, we,

191
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.950
we like to favor. So what we were interested

192
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.849
in was, um, The kinds of explanations that you

193
00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:49.840
find, particularly in what we call wild religious traditions,

194
00:11:49.849 --> 00:11:53.969
like it's mostly about either the spirits or the

195
00:11:53.969 --> 00:11:56.489
gods are not really happy with you or they

196
00:11:56.489 --> 00:11:59.849
want to hurt you, or some other person wants

197
00:11:59.849 --> 00:12:03.969
to, to, to hurt you. That's witchcraft. And what

198
00:12:03.969 --> 00:12:07.099
we thought was remarkable in those things was that

199
00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:13.219
In all these cases, um, the responsibility is very

200
00:12:13.219 --> 00:12:17.059
focalized on a particular person, either the witch or

201
00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:21.460
the victim themselves. Um, THAT is, uh, misfortune is

202
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.580
not, people are not interested in explaining misfortune in

203
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.500
very generic terms. Um, AND in fact, people in

204
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.780
many places have. A combination of two kinds of

205
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.760
explanation of misfortune. Like, for example, if I have,

206
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:42.809
um, you know, if they, um, say a common

207
00:12:42.809 --> 00:12:46.299
problem in many, um, uh, cultures, a woman is

208
00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:48.690
not, uh, bearing any children, she seems to be

209
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:54.820
sterile. And people will, of course, in many places

210
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.340
go consult Western style or, you know, modern doctors

211
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.340
of some kind who will say that there is

212
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.460
a problem of, you know, conception and people accept

213
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.020
that entirely. I mean that's, you know, this person

214
00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.539
does not have children because something's wrong with her

215
00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:12.380
body. That's not a problem at all. But the

216
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.890
thing is, why did that problem with her body

217
00:13:15.219 --> 00:13:18.869
occur? In that person at that time, you know,

218
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.549
that is what we need to explain is the

219
00:13:21.549 --> 00:13:25.179
particulars of the case. Um, TO which, of course,

220
00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:28.309
um, any sort of scientific perspective on the world

221
00:13:28.309 --> 00:13:32.309
has no particular answer. Uh, YOU know, you, you

222
00:13:32.309 --> 00:13:36.669
caught this disease because the virus is multiplying inside

223
00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:40.190
your body. Well, why you? Well, the, the virus

224
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:44.320
doesn't mind which bodies it's invades really. Uh, SO

225
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.479
it's not against you in particular. Now, these wild,

226
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.530
uh, religious traditions, um, are there to answer a

227
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.690
particular question, which is why you, why now? Why

228
00:13:54.690 --> 00:14:00.349
in this particular case? One thing that, um, we've

229
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:06.369
realized in, you know, um, uh, comparing, uh, doctrinal

230
00:14:06.369 --> 00:14:08.570
religions on the one hand and the sort of

231
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.489
white traditions that, uh, doctrinal religions have very little

232
00:14:12.489 --> 00:14:16.580
to offer to answer that question. Uh, SO, you

233
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.469
know, to take a Christian sort of, uh, perspective,

234
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.830
that's most familiar to many people, um, why did

235
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.349
you get, why did this person get cancer and

236
00:14:26.349 --> 00:14:31.549
not that that other person? Well, basically, in a

237
00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:35.349
Christian perspective, this is either part of a plan

238
00:14:35.349 --> 00:14:40.190
that we cannot understand, or, um, it's just there

239
00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.169
and we all have our, you know, uh, crosses

240
00:14:43.169 --> 00:14:45.650
to, to, to bear and things like that. And

241
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.929
what matters is your relationship to God, which is

242
00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:51.130
a very general thing that is not about you

243
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.239
in particular, you know, not, uh, not explaining the

244
00:14:54.239 --> 00:14:57.969
events in your life very much. So it's no

245
00:14:57.969 --> 00:15:03.679
surprise in, you know, our perspective is that It's

246
00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:07.369
no surprise that the wide religions keep coming back

247
00:15:07.369 --> 00:15:11.520
like weeds in the sense that people are faced

248
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.479
with people who have questions like, you know, why

249
00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:17.030
did it happen to this person at this moment?

250
00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:21.719
The doctrinal religion says almost nothing about that. It

251
00:15:21.719 --> 00:15:27.000
says things about You know, evil or, uh, suffering

252
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.570
in general, but it doesn't say anything about you

253
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.419
now. Um. So the white tradition has a sort

254
00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:37.010
of market advantage in a way because it addresses

255
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.969
something that the consumer really wants, which is, um,

256
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.880
some way of thinking of this particular case, um,

257
00:15:45.099 --> 00:15:47.619
in its particulars, like, you know, why did it

258
00:15:47.619 --> 00:15:51.859
happen now and not in another way. So, we,

259
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.929
we think that, you know, very often you'll find

260
00:15:54.929 --> 00:16:00.799
that, um, wild developments, wild religious traditions development, um,

261
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:05.969
occur, um, are more likely to occur in, um,

262
00:16:06.609 --> 00:16:11.080
In traditions that don't really have much of an

263
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.309
explanation for a particular misfortune. Um, SO for example,

264
00:16:15.479 --> 00:16:18.679
you know, um, in, in many places where people

265
00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:21.960
would identify as Buddhists or would say they follow

266
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.390
the Dharma, you know, the the Buddhist way or

267
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.580
tradition. Uh, YOU'LL find that lots of, um, um,

268
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:34.599
people, of course, have to resort to, um, To

269
00:16:34.599 --> 00:16:38.190
local specialists to address disease, misfortune in general, and

270
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.140
all that. Um, FOR example, I, I, in one

271
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.750
of the articles I, I cited this example of

272
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:48.549
people who are Buddhists, they're perfectly fine with Buddhism

273
00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:52.109
and the entire sort of thing. Um, HOWEVER, they

274
00:16:52.109 --> 00:16:56.510
want um lamas, you know, to come over and

275
00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.940
bless their fields. To get rid of pests, you

276
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:05.020
know, like caterpillars and things like that. So that's

277
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.060
a particular problem they want to address. And if

278
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:12.739
the official doctrinal religion does not address them, then

279
00:17:12.739 --> 00:17:14.699
they'll resort to specialists who do.

280
00:17:15.948 --> 00:17:19.739
Mhm. So, uh, I'm also interested in the kinds

281
00:17:19.739 --> 00:17:24.698
of psychological mechanism mechanisms that are behind the different

282
00:17:24.698 --> 00:17:28.029
kind of anthropological phenomena that we can study in

283
00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:30.259
the, in this particular case when it comes to

284
00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:33.538
religions in the wild, in one of your papers

285
00:17:33.538 --> 00:17:37.060
you present. The model to account for the gross

286
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.939
cultural recurrence of the themes that you talked about

287
00:17:40.939 --> 00:17:44.099
there that is based on two main features of

288
00:17:44.099 --> 00:17:49.459
human psychology, namely epistemic vigilance and threat detection psychology.

289
00:17:49.579 --> 00:17:52.010
So could you explain that model?

290
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:57.250
Right. Well, so the model is, um, um, first

291
00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.839
of all, the model is a model about the

292
00:17:58.839 --> 00:18:04.630
interpretation of misfortune that's, um, that's, um, based on

293
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:09.500
a strategy in evolutionary, uh, psychology, which is to,

294
00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.069
um, try and reverse engineering, this sort of phenomena

295
00:18:13.069 --> 00:18:16.150
we see in, um, happening in, um, uh, in

296
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.069
minds and, and saying what is this for? What

297
00:18:20.069 --> 00:18:23.339
does it do? So, in order to do that,

298
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:27.819
you have to start with the conditions of, um,

299
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:33.939
the conditions under which people lived in, um, throughout

300
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.439
millennia of evolution, uh, you know, of, um, evolutionary

301
00:18:38.439 --> 00:18:43.180
history, so say for. Um, FOR modern humans, it

302
00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.209
would be 200 to 300,000 years, but it's much

303
00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:49.180
more, of course, if we count erectors and other,

304
00:18:49.359 --> 00:18:53.219
um, um, pre-modern humans. Now, the thing is that

305
00:18:53.219 --> 00:18:57.020
these people were mostly, um, foragers who lived in

306
00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:02.469
small communities. And had a um technology that is

307
00:19:02.469 --> 00:19:06.229
not negligible, but that has, um, that can be

308
00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:11.209
said to be relatively simple. And the life of

309
00:19:11.209 --> 00:19:13.890
hunters gatherers, we know that from prehistory and we

310
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.650
know that from current from anthropology, is not an

311
00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.969
easy one. That is, people have to deal with

312
00:19:20.969 --> 00:19:27.290
all sorts of problems like parasites, that is microbes

313
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:34.140
and infections, congenital diseases. Accidents are very common in,

314
00:19:34.209 --> 00:19:37.280
of course, the hunting and gathering life. So this

315
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.510
life is not as, you know, some romantic description

316
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:43.880
of, um, ancestral life would, would have it. It's

317
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.599
not an easy one. It's one in which there's

318
00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:48.800
a ton of, uh, problems to do with accidents

319
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.390
and diseases and illness. So that's one thing, and

320
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.550
we know that from prehistory because we know that

321
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.109
from the bone record that people had all sorts

322
00:19:58.109 --> 00:20:02.140
of problems of this kind. We know that from

323
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:07.020
contemporary hunters gatherers. Another thing we know about that,

324
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:11.510
and, and that's a very, very important feature is

325
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:17.349
that lots of people received help. That is to

326
00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.339
say we have evidence, for example, of people who

327
00:20:19.339 --> 00:20:25.229
are born with congenital diseases who survived those those

328
00:20:25.229 --> 00:20:27.989
insults for a long time. We have evidence of

329
00:20:27.989 --> 00:20:33.579
people who had fractures or partial paralysis who survived.

330
00:20:33.869 --> 00:20:37.550
Now, and we know also from contemporary small scale

331
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.150
societies that this is something that happens now with

332
00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:45.780
that. Uh, SUGGESTS is that there was, uh, help

333
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.170
provided to those people. And as I said, uh,

334
00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.930
these are societies of simple technology, which means that

335
00:20:52.219 --> 00:20:55.729
there isn't that much to do to address, um,

336
00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.739
disease or accidents, um, except social support, which means

337
00:21:00.739 --> 00:21:04.900
you keep feeding and you keep protecting someone who

338
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.839
cannot contribute as much as the others to. Um

339
00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:12.689
TO production or to protection of the group. And

340
00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:15.930
that's very important because, um, and there we're getting

341
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.689
into a sort of evolutionary model, uh, because the

342
00:21:20.689 --> 00:21:23.170
thing is that all this in the end has

343
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.520
to, uh, be, um, those behaviors have to in

344
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.699
some sense be, um, in some way, sorry, be,

345
00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.010
uh, fitness positive. They have to be good for

346
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.689
the reproductive potential of the people who engage in

347
00:21:35.689 --> 00:21:42.130
those, uh, behaviors now. Um, PROVIDING support to people

348
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:45.780
who are the victims of misfortune. Uh, CREATES a

349
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.260
real dilemma. Uh, IT'S a real dilemma because of

350
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.339
the way cooperation works between humans. Um, AND our

351
00:21:53.339 --> 00:21:56.699
cooperation is based, um, and that's true for the

352
00:21:56.699 --> 00:21:59.459
smallest group and the largest societies, it is based

353
00:21:59.459 --> 00:22:04.650
on two major features. Um, ONE is partner choice,

354
00:22:04.989 --> 00:22:07.339
uh, which means that you are not forced to

355
00:22:07.339 --> 00:22:09.900
cooperate in the same way with everyone. You choose

356
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.140
the people who are more, um, beneficial to you

357
00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:18.449
as cooperators. Which, as many, uh, evolutionary anthropologists or

358
00:22:18.449 --> 00:22:22.369
psychologists agree, um, uh, argue, sorry, um, is the

359
00:22:22.369 --> 00:22:25.089
reason why we have standards of fairness. You know,

360
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.329
you do not want to, um, have, uh, too

361
00:22:28.329 --> 00:22:31.890
much exchange with people whose norm of behavior is

362
00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.810
to exploit you. On the one, on the other

363
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:37.050
hand, you don't want to be overgenerous all the

364
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:40.410
time because, uh, that is bad for your fitness.

365
00:22:40.449 --> 00:22:44.739
It might be good for others. So we have

366
00:22:44.739 --> 00:22:47.300
partner choice, which means we choose people. And there's

367
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.140
a second part of the second sort of phase

368
00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:56.819
of this, of this cooperation, psychology is reputation, you

369
00:22:56.819 --> 00:23:00.280
know, the, the way you choose between, uh, people,

370
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.420
uh, is based on information you have about their

371
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:07.239
behavior. And we know that again from the smallest,

372
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:11.810
uh, um, foraging societies where people have very clear

373
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.689
ideas about who is better at exchange in a

374
00:23:14.689 --> 00:23:19.689
particular domain. And we know that from, um, um,

375
00:23:19.739 --> 00:23:22.689
you know, um, modern places, and we know that,

376
00:23:22.699 --> 00:23:25.770
for example, one of the ways in which, um,

377
00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.500
internet, uh, exchange works is that it has reputation

378
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.459
mechanisms, you know, you can complain about people exploiting

379
00:23:33.459 --> 00:23:35.459
you in some way or other. You can rape

380
00:23:35.459 --> 00:23:38.229
them, you can, etc. So we have partner choice

381
00:23:38.229 --> 00:23:40.250
and we have reputation. Now the, the, the, the,

382
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.900
the, the, these two are important because to go

383
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.819
back to someone who's a victim. A once someone

384
00:23:47.819 --> 00:23:49.939
is a victim of misfortune, they can't produce as

385
00:23:49.939 --> 00:23:53.579
much as the others. They can't protect you because

386
00:23:53.579 --> 00:23:57.140
they're, you know, weakened by their problems. Also, it

387
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.540
may be that some of their misfortune is due

388
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.349
to incompetence, in which case they're not great as

389
00:24:03.349 --> 00:24:08.310
cooperation partners, you know. Now, that faces people that,

390
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.270
that creates a dilemma in the sense that you

391
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.839
should limit your support to such people. You should

392
00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:19.479
limit your support to victims simply because helping someone

393
00:24:19.479 --> 00:24:24.199
who cannot really reciprocate that much is a loss.

394
00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:26.160
So in terms of your own fitness, you should

395
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.530
not help them too much or you should limit

396
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:32.270
your health. However, limiting your help is a way

397
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.390
to lose reputation as a cooperator, as a generous

398
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.920
cooperator, and that reputation we know independently is a

399
00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:42.530
very important aspect of human cooperation. So you're faced

400
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.930
with a dilemma which is if I help this

401
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.729
person too much, I'm losing. If I do not

402
00:24:47.729 --> 00:24:50.849
help that person and it's known in my group,

403
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:55.209
I'm losing, um, fitness. So you can't be, you

404
00:24:55.209 --> 00:24:57.560
know, the, the, the, that's the dynamma which are

405
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.650
you, whatever you do, you know, it's, um, it's,

406
00:25:00.729 --> 00:25:04.920
it's not great. So what we thought was, well,

407
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.390
um, there is a way out of that dynamo.

408
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.079
And a way out of that dilemma is to

409
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:18.449
think and to have others think, agree that the

410
00:25:18.449 --> 00:25:23.609
person who is um um has experienced misfortune might

411
00:25:23.609 --> 00:25:28.089
be partly responsible for their misfortune. Which means that

412
00:25:28.089 --> 00:25:30.420
they might be partly in a position where they're

413
00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:34.410
exploiting you by requiring your help. So that may

414
00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.969
be a bit surprising because we don't think people,

415
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.410
you know, break their legs just to be to

416
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.650
exploit others. But there is an element of suspicion

417
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.849
that if you were more careful about not, you

418
00:25:45.849 --> 00:25:51.000
know, treading on banana peels, you would not create

419
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.819
this problem for others. So it's partly your, um,

420
00:25:55.250 --> 00:26:01.020
it's partly on you. And um so the, the

421
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:06.219
sort of evolutionary interpretation of this cooperation dmma would

422
00:26:06.219 --> 00:26:09.459
say, well, in this case we should see that

423
00:26:09.459 --> 00:26:13.060
people are strongly motivated to think and to have

424
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:19.030
others think that the victim is partly responsible or

425
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.780
at least that some person is responsible, but not

426
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.589
me, as it were, you know, so. Um, AND

427
00:26:26.589 --> 00:26:31.219
that would be, um, and, um. A sort of

428
00:26:31.219 --> 00:26:36.339
elegant explanation, it seems. Um, TO the, to one

429
00:26:36.339 --> 00:26:39.660
very common feature of those explanations of misfortune which

430
00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:44.060
I mentioned before, which is that they're always concentrated

431
00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.619
on particular individuals. So it's not the structure of

432
00:26:47.619 --> 00:26:51.900
the world that made you sick. It's not in

433
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.859
personal forces. It's someone, a god, a spirit, a

434
00:26:55.859 --> 00:26:59.819
witch, or yourself by your, by your own um

435
00:26:59.819 --> 00:27:03.709
negligence. So what we've been doing is trying to

436
00:27:03.709 --> 00:27:06.150
see, well, is it the case that in the

437
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:11.380
world's cultures, Explanations of misfortune tend to focalize on

438
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:16.339
particular individuals as opposed to generalize the responsibility. And

439
00:27:16.339 --> 00:27:18.219
is it the case that this has to do

440
00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:22.060
with the, um, um, help that can be provided

441
00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.939
to people? And you know, so we've done cross

442
00:27:25.939 --> 00:27:28.349
cultural studies of that on the one hand, but

443
00:27:28.349 --> 00:27:32.219
also experimental studies on the psychological mechanism of explaining

444
00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:32.699
misfortune.

445
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.939
Yes, and we're going to come back to the

446
00:27:35.939 --> 00:27:39.219
topic of victim devaluation toward the end of our

447
00:27:39.219 --> 00:27:42.459
conversation today. But just to close off the topic

448
00:27:42.459 --> 00:27:45.300
of religion, uh, let me ask you one more

449
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:51.060
question. Do religious beliefs psychologically differ in any fundamental

450
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.939
way from other kinds of beliefs? Is there anything

451
00:27:54.939 --> 00:27:55.939
special about them?

452
00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.640
So I think, you know, the anthropologist Morris Brock

453
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.859
said that religion is often central, but it's nothing

454
00:28:03.859 --> 00:28:06.390
special, and I think that's a very good slogan

455
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.930
for the sort of psychological approach to those things.

456
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.260
No, I mean the, the, um, you know, over

457
00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.859
the last sort of 40 years or so, people

458
00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:19.339
have done cognitive studies of religion or cognitive science

459
00:28:19.339 --> 00:28:23.219
of religion, and in many cases what this shows

460
00:28:23.219 --> 00:28:26.880
is that The, the, the, the mechanisms, the processes

461
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.439
you have, um, in terms of acquiring beliefs, maintaining

462
00:28:31.439 --> 00:28:35.969
beliefs, um, and using them in explanatory ways. They're

463
00:28:35.969 --> 00:28:38.750
the same you can find in other domains. So,

464
00:28:39.079 --> 00:28:42.280
um, it's, it's not special. So in a way,

465
00:28:42.319 --> 00:28:47.000
you could say that, um, um, You know, um,

466
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.910
most of what we know that explains religious beliefs

467
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:54.630
is not about religion at all. It's about more

468
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.579
general sort of psychological processes.

469
00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.920
So, moving on to the topic of ritualized behavior.

470
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.199
Of course, this is something that we can also

471
00:29:05.199 --> 00:29:10.520
find in religions, but what is ritualized behavior? What

472
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.760
characterizes it?

473
00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:17.160
Well, this is, um, um, research that, um, I

474
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.699
did some time ago in collaboration with Pierre Leonard,

475
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.839
who's so sadly died a few, uh, a couple

476
00:29:23.839 --> 00:29:27.520
of years ago, and we, um, and it was

477
00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.609
mostly Pierre Leonard who had this, um, who started

478
00:29:31.609 --> 00:29:36.000
this, um, um, research, this program in which we're

479
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.609
trying to say, why is it? THAT there are

480
00:29:39.609 --> 00:29:44.089
common features in ritualized behavior in many domains like

481
00:29:44.089 --> 00:29:47.770
for example, the behavior of obsessive compulsive patients on

482
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.489
the one hand, but also the rituals that you

483
00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:56.569
find in religious practices in many places seem to

484
00:29:56.569 --> 00:30:02.170
have common features like the rigid sequence of actions

485
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:05.689
that you must follow. Um, NO explanation for the

486
00:30:05.689 --> 00:30:08.050
components of these actions, you know, you must follow

487
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:09.849
them in a particular order, but each of the

488
00:30:09.849 --> 00:30:14.020
sub-actions, so to speak, is not really explained. BUT

489
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.619
also a sense of compulsion that you must do

490
00:30:16.619 --> 00:30:21.339
it, otherwise bad things could happen. And, um, and

491
00:30:21.339 --> 00:30:26.099
also an extreme attention to performance when you're, when

492
00:30:26.099 --> 00:30:29.140
you're performing it, that is when you're in the

493
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.209
middle of the of this kind of ritualized behavior,

494
00:30:32.579 --> 00:30:36.810
either as an OCD patient, an obsessive patient, or

495
00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:41.260
as a religious practitioner, you're very much focused on

496
00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:45.599
the exact Uh, performance of, uh, particular actions that

497
00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:50.160
are typically complex enough that you couldn't perform them

498
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.239
automatically, like you do your shoelaces or you, you

499
00:30:53.239 --> 00:30:58.619
know, or things like that. Um, SO, um, that

500
00:30:58.619 --> 00:31:01.569
problem, of course, was not something that we discovered

501
00:31:01.569 --> 00:31:07.020
because even Sigmund Freud, uh, uh, uh, said, uh,

502
00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.290
talked about that, and he had a short article

503
00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:13.599
called, um, uh, uh, Neurosis of repetition and religious.

504
00:31:13.989 --> 00:31:17.609
Um, uh, BEHAVIOR and, uh, but it was very

505
00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:21.339
disappointing. I remember reading it and thinking he must

506
00:31:21.339 --> 00:31:24.380
have some crazy idea about how that connects to

507
00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.979
sexuality or something else or something like that, but

508
00:31:26.979 --> 00:31:28.939
not at all. The, the, the, the, the small

509
00:31:28.939 --> 00:31:31.739
article sort of concludes by saying that maybe religions

510
00:31:31.739 --> 00:31:35.800
are in a sense the obsessive compulsive, um, condition

511
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.260
of an entire group. And that OCD or he,

512
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:42.989
he called that repetition and neurosis, is in a

513
00:31:42.989 --> 00:31:45.410
way a religion of the individual, a sort of,

514
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:50.439
uh, you know, individual, individualized, um, religious tradition. Which

515
00:31:50.439 --> 00:31:53.959
is very disappointing because it's saying these things. ARE

516
00:31:53.959 --> 00:31:57.079
similar because they're very similar and they might be

517
00:31:57.079 --> 00:32:00.760
more or less the same thing. So, um, what,

518
00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:05.959
um, What Pierre and and I as a sort

519
00:32:05.959 --> 00:32:08.839
of follower of that same model we tried to

520
00:32:08.839 --> 00:32:13.469
explain was what is the cognitive structure that's um

521
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.199
what is the cognitive mechanism that's involved in these

522
00:32:16.199 --> 00:32:21.699
kinds of behaviors and We first tried to, to

523
00:32:21.699 --> 00:32:24.780
show that, um, ritualized behavior in this sense of

524
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:30.760
exact attention to particular action. IS something that exists

525
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.410
in particular contexts, but it's not rituals. Rituals that

526
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.040
the, the, the term ritual is a very wide

527
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.280
term that has been used in many contexts in

528
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.520
different ways. There is no point in trying to

529
00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.719
find whether there is what is the definition of

530
00:32:47.719 --> 00:32:50.199
rituals or the characteristics of rituals. It's a bit

531
00:32:50.199 --> 00:32:53.069
like religion. It's a term we have because we

532
00:32:53.560 --> 00:33:00.989
inherited this concern from previous traditions, you know, classicists

533
00:33:00.989 --> 00:33:03.599
talked about ritual because they were faced with Greek

534
00:33:03.599 --> 00:33:06.920
and Roman religion, which was not all like Christianity

535
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.760
in many respects. So then anthropologists found rituals in

536
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.949
other places. Um, NOW, Pierre and I published an

537
00:33:14.949 --> 00:33:18.349
article a few years, uh, back in the, um,

538
00:33:18.829 --> 00:33:21.589
um, you know, collection on rituals to say this

539
00:33:21.589 --> 00:33:23.670
concept is not a proper one, you know, this

540
00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.949
is not, it's a bit like, you know, having

541
00:33:25.949 --> 00:33:30.069
a theory of, uh, white objects, white objects or

542
00:33:30.069 --> 00:33:34.900
a theory of, uh, of, uh, red, uh, things.

543
00:33:35.109 --> 00:33:37.150
It's, it's not going to work because that's not

544
00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:40.430
natural property. Uh, Richard's behavior on the other hand,

545
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.510
that is something special. It's a special state of

546
00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:48.390
mind. And we find it in both OCD pathology

547
00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:52.069
but also in some aspects of religious practices sometimes.

548
00:33:53.439 --> 00:33:57.609
And it's, um, it's based on a, it seems

549
00:33:57.609 --> 00:34:00.160
to us, it's based on a sort of special,

550
00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:06.530
uh, use of our threat detection psychology. Uh, AND,

551
00:34:06.569 --> 00:34:08.889
you know, as a result of evolution, we have

552
00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:12.489
a special psychology to deal with threats like contagion,

553
00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:19.330
contamination, uh, predator invasion, um, enemies, um, things like

554
00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:26.168
that. Um, SOCIAL strife and problems, and the idea

555
00:34:26.168 --> 00:34:30.850
there was that the things that prompt you to

556
00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:33.889
engage in ritualized behavior are very often phrased in

557
00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:36.969
the same way as those threats. Like for example,

558
00:34:36.978 --> 00:34:40.129
there is you must do this or that to

559
00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:43.889
purify your soul, which is a clear sort of

560
00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:49.000
metaphorical transfer from the domain of contagion. And contamination

561
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.469
and how do you purify your soul? Typically you

562
00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:56.389
perform actions that are to do with washing, uh,

563
00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:00.120
you know, cleansing, getting rid of, um, of, um,

564
00:35:00.129 --> 00:35:04.159
dirt and impurities and things like that. It's, um,

565
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.810
so it seemed to us that a lot of

566
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:11.850
this, um, the saliency of these ritualized, um, actions

567
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:15.800
sort of recipes that are offered to people, um,

568
00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:20.620
is it stems from the, the this connection to

569
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:24.010
threat detection. So you're, you're given something that is

570
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:27.530
extremely easy to understand, you know, uh, so for

571
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:30.500
example, your, your soul. Uh, WHEN you commit bad

572
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:35.649
actions, your soul becomes impure. Um, IF you, uh,

573
00:35:35.699 --> 00:35:38.939
go and, um, uh, bathe in, in, in, in,

574
00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:42.100
in, uh, the sacred river, your soul will be

575
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:46.300
purified. None of that is difficult to, to represent

576
00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.820
for people because they already have that psychology, which

577
00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.909
is the psychology of contagion and contamination. Um, SO

578
00:35:52.909 --> 00:35:55.189
we, we, we tried to say that this would

579
00:35:55.189 --> 00:35:59.149
explain both the sort of special concern people have,

580
00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:01.350
you know, people are in a special mental states

581
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.919
when they perform these actions. But also the, the,

582
00:36:04.969 --> 00:36:07.639
the, the, the sort of repertoire of uh of

583
00:36:07.639 --> 00:36:11.840
themes, the fact that it's always about purity, impurity,

584
00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:17.120
about boundaries, um, uh, about defense against invisible enemies

585
00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:21.120
and things like that. That does not explain all

586
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.409
the features of rituals, but it's in our, in

587
00:36:24.409 --> 00:36:27.250
our view, it explains one part that is really

588
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:31.929
important, uh, which is the Um, which is ritual

589
00:36:31.929 --> 00:36:35.530
behavior itself and the themes that it conveys.

590
00:36:37.139 --> 00:36:41.479
So does this approach that you explained there, uh,

591
00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:45.030
could, could it apply also to the study or

592
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:49.110
to psychiatry more generally and specifically the study of

593
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:53.270
mental conditions like you mentioned there, OCD or obsessive

594
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:56.699
compulsive disorder and anxiety.

595
00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:02.270
Yes, so, um, in our um um description of

596
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:06.689
um ritualized behavior, we owe a lot to uh

597
00:37:06.689 --> 00:37:10.399
models that were developed to, to, to, to describe

598
00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:14.610
the OCD pathology and in particular proposed by Henry

599
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:18.840
Seshman and Eric Woody. Um, IN a model where,

600
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:23.449
um, what they try to emphasize and they tested

601
00:37:23.449 --> 00:37:29.020
it, um, On, um, animal models and, um, uh,

602
00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.850
and you know, in, in other ways was that,

603
00:37:32.179 --> 00:37:42.360
um, um. Ritualized behavior happens in patients not because,

604
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:46.909
not just because of an exaggerated concern with threats

605
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.590
like, you know, washing your hands 10 times because

606
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.719
they may still have germs. It's not just that,

607
00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.800
but it's also a failure of a system to

608
00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:03.270
close this anx anxiety provoking thoughts. In non OCD

609
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:07.610
individuals, uh, if you fear that you have germs

610
00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:10.520
in your hands, you wash your hands, and then

611
00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:14.929
the anxiety about that goes down. Um, IN many

612
00:38:14.929 --> 00:38:17.810
of these patients, the anxiety level remains the same,

613
00:38:17.899 --> 00:38:20.860
and that is why they repeat those actions, because

614
00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.699
the, the, the, the motivation for those actions is

615
00:38:23.699 --> 00:38:27.419
still there. Now, uh, was Saman and Woody and,

616
00:38:27.469 --> 00:38:30.760
um, um, also that was tested on animal models,

617
00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:35.000
on animals by, um, on rodents by David Ela

618
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.479
in Israel. Um, THE, the idea was that this

619
00:38:38.479 --> 00:38:43.100
failure to close, um, the, the, the action, uh,

620
00:38:43.149 --> 00:38:49.209
was characteristic of OCD, um, in general, in more

621
00:38:49.209 --> 00:38:54.060
global terms, This was part of a general movement

622
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:58.530
which has become more and more, um, extensive over

623
00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:01.659
the last 10 to 20 years, uh, which is

624
00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:05.100
to, to think of psychiatry in terms of evolutionary,

625
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.899
um, um, um, in an evolutionary perspective as having

626
00:39:09.899 --> 00:39:12.159
to do with the way minds are designed. So

627
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:16.709
for anxiety, it's, it's, it's, um, it, it's, it's

628
00:39:16.709 --> 00:39:20.060
quite clear that most of the targets of anxiety

629
00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:24.469
are things that are of evolutionary relevance like germs

630
00:39:24.469 --> 00:39:28.429
contamination, but of course most crucial is social anxiety,

631
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:34.229
the fear that others are not, um, um, the

632
00:39:34.229 --> 00:39:39.360
fears the fear that others are not prepared to

633
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.530
see you. As a valuable sort of exchange and

634
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:46.590
cooperation kind of person. The fear that they might

635
00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:49.989
gang up against you also things like that are

636
00:39:49.989 --> 00:39:55.699
quite clearly related to our evolved motivations to have

637
00:39:55.989 --> 00:40:00.669
social support and to have cooperation. Now for other

638
00:40:00.669 --> 00:40:04.070
conditions, of course it's much more mysterious and I'm

639
00:40:04.929 --> 00:40:07.110
In a sense, relieved that I don't have to

640
00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.429
explain that because I'm an anthropologist and I don't

641
00:40:09.429 --> 00:40:13.669
do that work because um in other conditions it

642
00:40:13.669 --> 00:40:16.750
may be more, more complex, but you know there

643
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:21.229
are evolutionary psychologists or evolutionary psychiatrists who are doing

644
00:40:21.229 --> 00:40:25.270
lots of work on, on that, especially Randolph or

645
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:29.110
Randy Nassi, who's been publishing a lot on this

646
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:34.129
sort of Darwinian approach to mental condition. This is,

647
00:40:34.209 --> 00:40:40.590
it's a pretty difficult, um, um. Kind of enterprise

648
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:45.530
because the taxonomy and the causality in psychiatry are

649
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:49.209
very much, uh, contested and, and, and, and in

650
00:40:49.209 --> 00:40:54.290
fact, very problematic. Um, AND it's always difficult for

651
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:57.409
an evolutionary model if you start with something that's

652
00:40:57.409 --> 00:41:03.260
vaguely defined or vaguely understood. Excuse me. For example,

653
00:41:03.989 --> 00:41:06.070
it makes no sense in a way to say

654
00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:08.750
that you want an evolutionary theory of religion because

655
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:10.939
religion is a term that's applied in such a

656
00:41:10.939 --> 00:41:13.750
vague and confusing way to so many different things

657
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.780
that what is it exactly you're trying to explain?

658
00:41:16.969 --> 00:41:20.590
And that's why in our wide tradition we said,

659
00:41:20.669 --> 00:41:22.870
well, we'll focus on one thing that we can

660
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:28.020
precisely define which is Explanations of particular misfortune in

661
00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:32.020
terms of mystical processes that people cannot actually observe.

662
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.060
And that's why also in the case of OCD,

663
00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.060
we said, well, we'll focus on one thing which

664
00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:39.979
is ritualized behavior in the sense of attention to

665
00:41:39.979 --> 00:41:42.419
detailed sequencing and all these things because these are

666
00:41:42.419 --> 00:41:45.139
things that are easy to define. But if you

667
00:41:45.139 --> 00:41:48.100
said, I want an evolutionary explanation of madness, then

668
00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.489
it's going to be a very confusing kind of

669
00:41:50.489 --> 00:41:52.870
operation because you don't know where to start. Um,

670
00:41:53.169 --> 00:41:56.139
WHAT is the exact phenomenon to explain.

671
00:41:57.649 --> 00:42:00.979
So, shifting gears a little bit now, uh, tell

672
00:42:00.979 --> 00:42:05.969
us about ownership psychology. What is ownership psychology? What

673
00:42:05.969 --> 00:42:07.610
exactly do you study there?

674
00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.770
Well, this is a project that uh started a

675
00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:16.209
few years ago when, um, The idea was just

676
00:42:16.209 --> 00:42:19.810
that, um, ownership is universal, you know, everywhere people

677
00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:22.159
have ideas about ownership, you know, this is my

678
00:42:22.159 --> 00:42:26.189
thing, this is my. This is your thing when

679
00:42:26.189 --> 00:42:30.629
we transact, uh, when you, when we exchange that

680
00:42:30.629 --> 00:42:33.149
thing that was mine is not mine anymore and

681
00:42:33.149 --> 00:42:35.189
so on so forth. This is something that's extremely

682
00:42:35.189 --> 00:42:38.989
easy for human minds, uh, but also as psychologists

683
00:42:38.989 --> 00:42:43.389
have pointed out, it's interesting because it's invisible. There's

684
00:42:43.389 --> 00:42:46.300
nothing about, you know, this, uh, pen that shows

685
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.830
that it's mine. It's not a physical property of

686
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:53.270
that of that pen. So it's interesting because it's

687
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:56.790
something that the mind has to project onto objects

688
00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:00.429
and relations between people and objects. So how does

689
00:43:00.429 --> 00:43:03.469
it do it? Now, um, one way to study

690
00:43:03.469 --> 00:43:08.389
that, that was very, uh, very fruitful, very, very

691
00:43:08.389 --> 00:43:13.340
productive was, let's see how children acquire those notions.

692
00:43:13.669 --> 00:43:17.540
Because after all, you know, uh, notions, these notions

693
00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.709
appear, uh, in children's behavior pretty early, but they

694
00:43:20.709 --> 00:43:22.320
appear in a way that is not quite the

695
00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.030
same as what we, um, uh, what adults in

696
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:30.409
their communities would, uh, would, would do. And some

697
00:43:30.409 --> 00:43:34.409
psychologists like Cori Friedman in the states, but others

698
00:43:34.409 --> 00:43:37.929
as well have done lots of extremely good research

699
00:43:37.929 --> 00:43:41.889
showing that young children, sure they don't have the

700
00:43:41.889 --> 00:43:44.969
same database of how property works, you know, the

701
00:43:44.969 --> 00:43:49.689
same explicit principles as it were as adults, but

702
00:43:49.689 --> 00:43:53.889
they do think about ownership in terms of implicit

703
00:43:53.889 --> 00:43:58.000
principles that are very, are very, um important and

704
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.770
appear. APPEAR very, very early. One principle like that

705
00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.770
is that all else being equal, the first possessor

706
00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.639
of an object is the owner of the object.

707
00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.250
Like, you know, if I pick a flower in

708
00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:13.929
a meadow, it's my flower, now it's not yours.

709
00:44:13.969 --> 00:44:16.610
We were walking together and you picked another flower

710
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:20.310
and it's yours, it's not mine. Um, SO that's

711
00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:24.860
the first possession principle, but also, um, children have

712
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:30.419
rather sophisticated, um, um, ideas about, uh, about ownership.

713
00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:35.300
Like, for example, if, um, I have a blob

714
00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:39.409
of potty or play dough as we call it

715
00:44:39.409 --> 00:44:43.540
in America, and I, it's mine, you know, I

716
00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.739
have it and it's in my hands and stuff.

717
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.429
Then I put it on the table and then

718
00:44:47.429 --> 00:44:50.340
you create something really nice out of it, you

719
00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:54.060
know, like some statue or something. Well, now, even

720
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.260
though I was the first possessor, you are the

721
00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.939
owner in the sense of this statue because you've

722
00:44:58.939 --> 00:45:01.939
put work in it, work in it. Um, NOW

723
00:45:01.939 --> 00:45:04.929
this is something that is not just in 3

724
00:45:04.929 --> 00:45:09.199
year olds, ideas of ownership, but it's, it's also

725
00:45:09.489 --> 00:45:13.330
something that um philosophers like John Locke had, you

726
00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:17.320
know, described as one of the foundations of property.

727
00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.929
It's the work that is put into. So I

728
00:45:20.929 --> 00:45:24.250
was wondering where do these ideas come from, and

729
00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:27.370
it seems that there are two sources for these

730
00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:32.300
ideas. Um, THE sort of sophisticated adult ideas about

731
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:36.459
ownership. First of all, I'm talking about intuitive ownership,

732
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.179
you know, your sense that it's mine, it's not

733
00:45:38.179 --> 00:45:40.020
yours, or, you know, that sort of thing. I'm

734
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.610
not talking about the laws, the legal system, um,

735
00:45:43.709 --> 00:45:47.659
or the um or other social norms like that.

736
00:45:47.699 --> 00:45:50.659
I'm talking about individual intuitions that just show up,

737
00:45:50.739 --> 00:45:54.409
you know, when Someone, if someone takes something out

738
00:45:54.409 --> 00:45:57.439
of my pocket, everyone around will have the assumption,

739
00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:01.810
the, the intuition immediately that, uh, they acquired something

740
00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:07.689
that was not that. Now, um, so, uh, it

741
00:46:07.689 --> 00:46:10.010
seems that there are two sources to that. One

742
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:16.169
is the, the psychology of, um, possession and competitive

743
00:46:16.169 --> 00:46:19.530
acquisition that we have in many species, including humans.

744
00:46:20.189 --> 00:46:23.629
That is, for example, your territory is yours because

745
00:46:23.629 --> 00:46:27.020
you occupy it and because you defend it. And

746
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:31.750
once someone is trying to intrude into your territory,

747
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:34.629
you try to attack them and you know there's

748
00:46:34.629 --> 00:46:37.389
a lot of game theory about those things that

749
00:46:37.389 --> 00:46:42.959
was initiated by John Maynard Smith. And other people,

750
00:46:43.129 --> 00:46:47.050
um, after that, of course, that, um, models the

751
00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:50.889
fact that for example, in, um, in most cases,

752
00:46:50.969 --> 00:46:57.050
it's worth um combating, combating intruders fighting them and

753
00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:01.219
um so that one should expect that. Previous possessors

754
00:47:01.219 --> 00:47:04.370
of something will put more energy in defending it

755
00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:08.820
than intruders will put into taking it. However, this

756
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:15.260
creates situations of equilibrium in which what the biogists

757
00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:18.620
would call a bourgeois equilibrium in which you defend

758
00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:21.820
what you possess, but you do not intrude on

759
00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.780
other people's possessions, and they defend what they have,

760
00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.419
but they don't intrude on others. Now that's one

761
00:47:27.419 --> 00:47:31.560
source of our intuitions, but it's not, um, it's,

762
00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:37.020
it's, it's, it's important. And it certainly has influenced

763
00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:41.070
our intuitions, but there's another component to that. Um,

764
00:47:41.199 --> 00:47:43.959
THAT is just as important or perhaps more important

765
00:47:43.959 --> 00:47:47.290
in human behavior, which is the psychology of cooperation.

766
00:47:47.879 --> 00:47:51.370
She is that, um, to some extent this bourgeois

767
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:55.520
equilibrium. Only predicts that I failed to attack you

768
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:59.030
when, when you don't, um, sorry, that I do

769
00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:01.560
not attack you because you would defend your property.

770
00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:06.080
And it doesn't predict something that we find in

771
00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:09.149
most human groups, which is I just do not

772
00:48:09.149 --> 00:48:12.550
attack you because that would be something even if

773
00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:14.719
you were not defending your territory, that would be

774
00:48:14.719 --> 00:48:18.840
something that would be losing all reputation in terms

775
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.840
of cooperation. So I would be a net loser

776
00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:25.280
even if I acquired things. In most cases, all

777
00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.709
else being equal as usual. Um, SO that comes

778
00:48:28.709 --> 00:48:31.209
from the psychology of cooperation and in particular from

779
00:48:31.209 --> 00:48:33.669
the, the idea that people are trying to exchange

780
00:48:33.669 --> 00:48:38.879
to, to, to create mutually beneficial. Uh, EXCHANGES with

781
00:48:38.879 --> 00:48:42.989
others. Uh, THE clearest expression of that psychology, I

782
00:48:42.989 --> 00:48:47.959
think, uh, is a series of models proposed by

783
00:48:47.959 --> 00:48:51.580
Nicolas Beaumar and Jean Mattiste Andre in France, um,

784
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.439
um, that are trying to to propose evolutionary models

785
00:48:55.439 --> 00:48:59.709
of this kind of fairness-based mutual, uh, mutually profitable,

786
00:48:59.879 --> 00:49:04.739
um, exchanges now. Respect for property, so to speak,

787
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:08.540
is something that comes with the psychology of cooperation.

788
00:49:08.709 --> 00:49:12.060
It could not come from the mere bourgeois equilibrium

789
00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:15.350
because the bourgeois equilibrium will predict that the minute

790
00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:19.949
someone fails to defend their territory, I should immediately

791
00:49:19.949 --> 00:49:22.479
have the motivation to invade it or take their

792
00:49:22.479 --> 00:49:24.760
possessions, but that's not what we see in human

793
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:28.629
societies. So basically the idea was how do we

794
00:49:28.629 --> 00:49:33.030
explain some paradoxes of property. And the main answer

795
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:36.429
is that some of the non-paradoxical sort of features

796
00:49:36.429 --> 00:49:39.659
of property are easily explained in terms of, um,

797
00:49:39.669 --> 00:49:44.620
evolved competitive equilibria. Uh, BUT some of the interesting,

798
00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:50.209
uh, specifically human and Sometimes surprising aspects of our

799
00:49:50.209 --> 00:49:54.760
ownership come from our country of cooperation. Um, I,

800
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:58.030
I, you know, there are many examples of that

801
00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:00.070
kind of stuff, but I, I, you know, since

802
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:03.050
we're not talking for, you know, a few, we

803
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:05.540
don't have more than a little bit of time.

804
00:50:05.709 --> 00:50:07.989
I think just one that I used in one

805
00:50:07.989 --> 00:50:11.870
article, which is that, um, you tell me a

806
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:15.120
very funny joke. And I tell that very funny

807
00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:18.270
joke to my friends. Now, did I steal someone

808
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:20.719
something from you? Everyone would say, Well, no, I

809
00:50:20.719 --> 00:50:25.879
mean that's the way it is. Then we're both

810
00:50:25.879 --> 00:50:29.600
going to a party and you wish to impress

811
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.169
people by having a super funny joke and you

812
00:50:32.169 --> 00:50:34.159
tell me the joke and we arrive at a

813
00:50:34.159 --> 00:50:36.560
party and I tell the joke. Now did I

814
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.209
take something from you? Yes. Um, AND the final

815
00:50:40.209 --> 00:50:42.810
example is you're a comedian, I'm a comedian. You

816
00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:44.489
have a very funny joke, and I use it

817
00:50:44.489 --> 00:50:47.209
in my show. Now people are totally definite. I

818
00:50:47.209 --> 00:50:50.600
stole something from you. Now, it's not the case

819
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.959
that there are official norms about how to share

820
00:50:53.959 --> 00:50:56.030
jokes and stuff like that, or if you, if

821
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:57.520
we say that we'll have to have a norm

822
00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.919
for every single thing in the world. But what

823
00:51:00.919 --> 00:51:05.159
we see in those examples is that um in

824
00:51:05.159 --> 00:51:09.439
the first case, We had no sort of cooperative

825
00:51:09.439 --> 00:51:12.350
exchange, you know, it was just, you know, information

826
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:15.000
is free and it's, it's not very important. You

827
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.040
gave me a joke, I give it to others.

828
00:51:17.239 --> 00:51:19.800
In the second one, I was a bad cooperator

829
00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:23.040
because you were about to gain some social status.

830
00:51:23.709 --> 00:51:27.899
By telling a joke, and I stole this. I

831
00:51:27.899 --> 00:51:30.500
got that social status instead of you. So I

832
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:36.250
damaged you, I damaged your sort of welfare without

833
00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:39.379
any reason for that. So that's a clear violation

834
00:51:39.379 --> 00:51:42.780
of cooperation. So there are lots of informal aspects

835
00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:47.260
of ownership in everyday life that I think can

836
00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:51.580
be explained by cooperation and not by competitive equilibrium.

837
00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:56.260
Right. And I mean, there are several different applications

838
00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:59.459
of this approach to ownership psychology that you talk

839
00:51:59.459 --> 00:52:04.020
about in your papers. There's, for example, understanding disputed

840
00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:07.129
ownership in the case of indigenous rights, for example,

841
00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:11.260
historical changes like the evolution of slavery, and cultural

842
00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:14.260
appropriation, slavery, and so on. I mean, would you

843
00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:18.020
like to tell us about one of these examples

844
00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:20.300
just to illustrate what you're talking about?

845
00:52:21.159 --> 00:52:24.719
Right, well, OK, so one that is very easy

846
00:52:24.719 --> 00:52:26.979
because in a way it's already, it's been explained

847
00:52:26.979 --> 00:52:29.949
already in by other people and, and, and, and,

848
00:52:29.959 --> 00:52:36.750
um, is slavery, um. So, um, slavery existed in,

849
00:52:36.879 --> 00:52:40.600
in most societies beyond a certain level of complexity.

850
00:52:40.679 --> 00:52:43.590
You have slavery in Native Americans in Africa, in,

851
00:52:43.639 --> 00:52:51.250
in Asia, in Europe, etc. um. When slavery became

852
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:56.659
something contested, uh, when, um, um, English or British

853
00:52:56.659 --> 00:53:01.780
and then American, um, um, movement started that said

854
00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:06.120
that slavery was, um, was something that should be

855
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:10.739
abolished in principle, the entire thing. Um, WHAT did

856
00:53:10.739 --> 00:53:13.770
they say? What were their, their arguments? The arguments,

857
00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:19.250
the ones that moved the political sort of atmosphere

858
00:53:19.899 --> 00:53:24.060
were not really that it's logically impossible to own

859
00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:27.929
a person or that owning a person. IS a

860
00:53:27.929 --> 00:53:30.409
concept that we should change. No, it was that

861
00:53:30.409 --> 00:53:33.729
slaves are treated in a very cruel manner and

862
00:53:33.729 --> 00:53:36.979
that the life of slavery is not dignified, etc.

863
00:53:37.129 --> 00:53:40.449
ETC. So in a way what they were appealing

864
00:53:40.449 --> 00:53:44.409
to was that these people that you have enslaved

865
00:53:44.409 --> 00:53:48.419
actually should be. In your domain of cooperation, and

866
00:53:48.419 --> 00:53:51.580
since they're in your sphere of cooperation, you have

867
00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:54.860
to uh engage in mutually profitable exchanges with them

868
00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:59.770
like trade, like employment, but not forcible, uh, work,

869
00:53:59.889 --> 00:54:05.409
um, um, without compensation. So, um, in a way,

870
00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.860
slavery was, um, the, the, the, the notion that

871
00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:14.530
slavery was something that should not, uh, persists. WAS

872
00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:18.479
done not because people changed their concepts of ownership,

873
00:54:18.729 --> 00:54:22.570
but it's because they changed their appreciation of others

874
00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:26.689
as moral uh um actors and moral patients. Uh,

875
00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:30.530
SO it's widening the sphere of cooperation and morality

876
00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:33.770
is what happened. Um, BUT, you know, there are

877
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:36.409
many other examples like that. I mean, cultural appropriation

878
00:54:36.409 --> 00:54:41.149
is kind of Um, uh, a fun example because

879
00:54:41.479 --> 00:54:45.280
usually both sides argue in a way that, um,

880
00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.719
is based on intuitions of ownership that cannot be

881
00:54:47.719 --> 00:54:54.540
reconciled. Um, IF you start, you know, um, Making,

882
00:54:54.699 --> 00:54:58.340
uh, I, I don't know, hot dogs, uh, people

883
00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:01.500
will say you're appropriating something that is genuinely American

884
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:04.219
and it's, you know, Americans invented it first and

885
00:55:04.219 --> 00:55:07.340
stuff like that. So Americans will protest this cultural

886
00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:10.919
appropriation. You're in Europe and you would say, who

887
00:55:10.919 --> 00:55:14.209
cares we had sausages and bits of bread long

888
00:55:14.209 --> 00:55:17.679
before you guys, you Americans called it a hot

889
00:55:17.679 --> 00:55:20.689
dog. And both sides in a way are talking

890
00:55:20.689 --> 00:55:25.280
at cross purposes because that is not the point.

891
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:29.520
The reason why Americans would protest that this is

892
00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.570
a cultural appropriation is not a question of who

893
00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:36.209
did it first. The question is by using a

894
00:55:36.209 --> 00:55:40.090
term that is specifically American, you're diluting the value

895
00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:42.810
of our cultural norms, and of course no one

896
00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:44.669
will do that about hot dogs because no one

897
00:55:44.669 --> 00:55:48.100
cares. But it can be sort of a hairstyle

898
00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:51.850
that's, you know, some people, some African Americans, for

899
00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:53.709
example, in the US would say it comes from

900
00:55:53.709 --> 00:55:57.189
Africa, it's us, and of course the people against

901
00:55:57.189 --> 00:55:59.790
that were on the other, you know, in the

902
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:01.750
other camp would say no, no, no, you know,

903
00:56:01.909 --> 00:56:04.280
Europeans did it, you know, the Vikings did it

904
00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.540
and stuff like that. Uh, BUT that's not the

905
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.100
point. The point is that people are saying we

906
00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.580
have something that is a cultural marker, an ethnic

907
00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:15.689
identity marker. Uh, IF you can use it all

908
00:56:15.689 --> 00:56:18.850
the time, then we've lost something. We've lost, um,

909
00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:22.659
uh, a signal of identity. We'll have to invent

910
00:56:22.659 --> 00:56:24.870
a new one. So you've created a cost in

911
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:27.989
us, whereas we didn't create a cost for you.

912
00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:31.340
That's a violation of cooperation. That's why we find

913
00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:34.699
it really annoying that you are, um, you know,

914
00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:37.590
doing those things that are kind of African style.

915
00:56:38.939 --> 00:56:41.610
OK, so for the last part of our conversation,

916
00:56:41.699 --> 00:56:45.280
let's go back to the topic of misfortune and

917
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:49.260
victim devaluation. So who do we consider to be

918
00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:52.860
victims of misfortune? How do we determine that?

919
00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:57.449
Well, OK, so people determine it very, uh, clearly

920
00:56:57.449 --> 00:56:59.969
in their, in everyday life in the sense that

921
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:03.360
There are lots of situations in which people will,

922
00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:07.669
um, uh, will request help from others and will

923
00:57:07.669 --> 00:57:12.909
need social support. And in these situations, people, I

924
00:57:12.909 --> 00:57:19.699
think, intuitively identify the dilemma of cooperation, so. As

925
00:57:19.699 --> 00:57:22.659
I said, in, in many, um, uh, religious traditions,

926
00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:27.179
you vocalize the, the, the responsibility on, um, another

927
00:57:27.179 --> 00:57:30.810
person like the witch, another agent, like a spirit,

928
00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:34.850
or the person themselves. You violated some, um, some,

929
00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:40.889
um, ritual sort of, uh, uh, prescription. So what

930
00:57:40.889 --> 00:57:43.899
we tend to do in our sort of modern

931
00:57:43.899 --> 00:57:47.899
societies is mostly the last one that is focalized

932
00:57:47.899 --> 00:57:51.780
responsibility in the victims themselves, and this is what's

933
00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:56.860
called blaming the victim or victim blame. Um, THIS

934
00:57:56.860 --> 00:58:01.229
has been studied by psychology mostly, mostly. Um, IN

935
00:58:01.229 --> 00:58:07.209
the context of sexual assault in which people would

936
00:58:07.209 --> 00:58:10.689
typically say, Well, this woman was assaulted by some

937
00:58:10.689 --> 00:58:13.570
guy's boss, and then you have this series of

938
00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:16.489
things, but she was wearing this, she was behaving

939
00:58:16.489 --> 00:58:20.449
in a particular way. She was because it's usually

940
00:58:20.449 --> 00:58:25.280
she, she was in a way inviting a certain

941
00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:29.860
behavior. And what I thought was interesting was to

942
00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:34.169
see, you know, does this. Um, SO, first of

943
00:58:34.169 --> 00:58:36.129
all, the, the, the, the, the study of this

944
00:58:36.129 --> 00:58:38.050
kind of thing has been done in that particular

945
00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:41.280
top on that particular topic of sexual assault, mostly,

946
00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:43.530
and psychologists have really done a lot of work

947
00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:47.530
on that. Now, the a problem possible difficulty is

948
00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:50.949
that This is a very special context in which

949
00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:55.020
there is of course misfortune and victimhood and responsibility,

950
00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:59.459
but there's also notions of mating psychology, you know,

951
00:58:59.739 --> 00:59:04.020
sex psychology, etc. THAT may be combined with our

952
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:08.260
notion of misfortunes. So what we thought was, well,

953
00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.449
we should first study things that are more banal,

954
00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:14.260
like in one of our studies, you know, you're

955
00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:17.370
frying some something in your kitchen and the pan

956
00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:20.969
catches on fire and your kitchen is more or

957
00:59:20.969 --> 00:59:23.379
less destroyed and now you have to pay for

958
00:59:23.379 --> 00:59:28.070
that. Now, um, And the question is, you know,

959
00:59:28.290 --> 00:59:31.750
how do other people react to this situation. Now,

960
00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:37.129
if our model of the dilemma of cooperation is,

961
00:59:37.209 --> 00:59:41.540
is, um, is valid, uh, we should predict that

962
00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:47.489
people, for example, um, would be more willing to

963
00:59:47.489 --> 00:59:50.810
blame the victim if they think the victim has

964
00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:53.620
no value to them as a cooperator. And the

965
00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:56.379
reason for that is that if the victim has

966
00:59:56.379 --> 00:59:59.379
value to you as a culprit, then helping them

967
00:59:59.379 --> 01:00:04.290
would be profitable, would be a good strategy, whereas

968
01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:06.820
in terms both of reputation, you're helping someone in

969
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:09.899
need, but also in terms of future cooperation, whereas

970
01:00:09.899 --> 01:00:13.330
if the person is a poor cooperator. Uh, THEN

971
01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:15.969
what's the point? But the problem is that if

972
01:00:15.969 --> 01:00:19.379
you say, well, she or he burned his kitchen,

973
01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:22.919
that's his fault. Then you sound like a bad

974
01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:26.070
cooperator. However, if you say, Well, he did that,

975
01:00:26.159 --> 01:00:30.110
but note that as he was frying that food,

976
01:00:30.399 --> 01:00:33.229
he also went to the living room to watch

977
01:00:33.229 --> 01:00:37.590
some TV. Then you are clearly sort of providing

978
01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:40.879
a version of events in which not helping them.

979
01:00:42.189 --> 01:00:44.300
It is OK because it's not a violation of

980
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.979
cooperation, you know, you're just sort of saying that

981
01:00:46.979 --> 01:00:50.889
these people, if this person, if they do that

982
01:00:51.139 --> 01:00:54.530
and they receive my help, well, they're exploiting me

983
01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:58.219
because they could have saved me that cost. So

984
01:00:58.219 --> 01:01:01.219
we, we run quite a few experiments to see,

985
01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.530
well, is it the case that people, for example,

986
01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:09.379
um, will blame the victim. More if the victim

987
01:01:09.379 --> 01:01:12.270
seems to be a poor cooperator like for example,

988
01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:14.780
if it's a selfish person, and that seems to

989
01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:18.659
be the case that really works. Um, ANOTHER aspect,

990
01:01:18.929 --> 01:01:22.040
another consequence of that model would be that, um,

991
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:27.169
very simply, the amount of resources you're willing to,

992
01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:32.340
to, to, to. To sacrifice to help someone should

993
01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:35.729
be proportional to the degree to which you blame

994
01:01:35.729 --> 01:01:39.310
them or you find them of bad character. And

995
01:01:39.449 --> 01:01:43.030
also that's also what happens in, in experiments. Now,

996
01:01:43.209 --> 01:01:45.050
now the thing is that now we're trying to

997
01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:48.090
do two things. One is to extend this to

998
01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:50.689
other places because we've done that mostly in sort

999
01:01:50.689 --> 01:01:55.429
of modern American contexts. But also, um, what would

1000
01:01:55.429 --> 01:01:58.629
be interesting is to see, does it extend to

1001
01:01:58.629 --> 01:02:02.229
those more dramatic cases? Like, um, I think it

1002
01:02:02.229 --> 01:02:06.429
extends very easily to things like, uh, you, someone

1003
01:02:06.429 --> 01:02:09.030
was mugged in the street and we say, oh,

1004
01:02:09.149 --> 01:02:12.419
but He was work, it was, you know, that

1005
01:02:12.419 --> 01:02:15.489
was a bad neighborhood, he should have known. Um,

1006
01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:18.250
I don't know to what extent that will also

1007
01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:21.620
um be relevant to sexual assault, but the idea

1008
01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:25.939
is to say, well, maybe. Our reaction to misfortune

1009
01:02:25.939 --> 01:02:32.010
in general is that we immediately identify misfortune of

1010
01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:34.929
others is that we immediately identify that there might

1011
01:02:34.929 --> 01:02:38.030
be costs for us, but if we don't pay

1012
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:40.129
those costs, there may be a reputation cost for

1013
01:02:40.129 --> 01:02:43.610
us, and we have to navigate this. Um, YOU

1014
01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:46.399
know, in one of the articles I cited this,

1015
01:02:46.409 --> 01:02:49.889
uh, sort of wit the epigram, um, by Larou

1016
01:02:49.889 --> 01:02:52.860
Foucault, who was a moralist, French moralist. You know,

1017
01:02:53.419 --> 01:02:59.290
16th century, 17th century, who said that we bear

1018
01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:03.979
the misfortune of others with great courage and fortitude,

1019
01:03:04.219 --> 01:03:06.179
and that's very funny, but at the same time

1020
01:03:06.179 --> 01:03:09.020
it's false. The misfortune of others is a big

1021
01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:11.840
problem for for us because we are a cooperative

1022
01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.810
species. The misfortune of others is a cost to

1023
01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:19.129
us in many possible ways. One is reputation, one

1024
01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:20.699
is the direct cost of helping them.

1025
01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:27.250
Mhm. But how do people evaluate the victims' cooperation

1026
01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:27.649
potential?

1027
01:03:28.629 --> 01:03:32.149
Well, uh, what we did was to just do

1028
01:03:32.149 --> 01:03:34.810
it for them, so to speak, because we manipulated

1029
01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:38.090
the fact that this person gives signals of being,

1030
01:03:38.419 --> 01:03:41.270
um, either a good cooperator or a bad cooperator.

1031
01:03:43.659 --> 01:03:47.540
Now, there are um many ways in which you,

1032
01:03:47.669 --> 01:03:52.949
um, evaluate the value of a potential, the potential

1033
01:03:52.949 --> 01:03:58.040
cooperation value of a person. In many cases, excuse

1034
01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.760
me, um, one of them might be just their

1035
01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.510
group identity. Um, YOU expect more cooperation from members

1036
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:07.709
of your ethnic group than from members of other

1037
01:04:07.709 --> 01:04:12.620
groups, and that is why, for example, Uh, cooperating

1038
01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:16.070
with people who have a very strange accent or

1039
01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:19.419
are clearly ethnically different from you would be something

1040
01:04:19.419 --> 01:04:22.979
that people sort of gauge. We know that there

1041
01:04:22.979 --> 01:04:29.919
are striking experiments like, um, uh, Katie Kinsler did

1042
01:04:29.919 --> 01:04:34.399
that a while ago showing that young children. American

1043
01:04:34.399 --> 01:04:39.709
children, like that's like 33 year olds. If I

1044
01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:45.959
remember correctly, um, would have no racial preferences, you

1045
01:04:45.959 --> 01:04:48.159
know, that's sort of like white kids do not

1046
01:04:48.159 --> 01:04:50.879
mind if a kid is black or white. And

1047
01:04:51.239 --> 01:04:53.860
when it comes to choosing a play partner, you

1048
01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:58.320
know, playmate. However, they tend to be reluctant to

1049
01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.149
play with someone who is the same race, so

1050
01:05:01.149 --> 01:05:04.280
to speak, uh, but has a different accent. Like

1051
01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.000
a British kid will have problems in on an

1052
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.070
American playground because they speak in a different way.

1053
01:05:10.479 --> 01:05:12.199
So why would that be the case? Well, it's

1054
01:05:12.199 --> 01:05:17.179
because accent is very clear indication of group identity,

1055
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.879
and it seems interesting that even young children have

1056
01:05:19.879 --> 01:05:22.399
this notion that accent is a good predictor of

1057
01:05:22.399 --> 01:05:26.739
thought, whereas skin tone isn't. Then they grow up

1058
01:05:26.739 --> 01:05:29.659
in a society where it is, and they acquire

1059
01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:32.659
this idea that skin tone is a predictor of

1060
01:05:32.659 --> 01:05:36.780
cooperation, but ethnic group would be one, personality would

1061
01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:39.100
be another one, and of course past behavior and

1062
01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:42.739
reputation, you know, I know about this person, but

1063
01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:45.620
I also know what people say about that person.

1064
01:05:45.929 --> 01:05:48.120
I know that people who interacted with that person

1065
01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.199
and so so on and so forth, and that

1066
01:05:50.199 --> 01:05:53.800
gives me an idea of how valuable cooperation would

1067
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.600
be with them. There's also the history of cooperating

1068
01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.629
with me in the sense that to the extent

1069
01:06:00.629 --> 01:06:06.120
that someone was not a great cooperator in the

1070
01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.520
past, you infer that it's their sort of cooperation

1071
01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.540
profile. That's the way they behave, at least with

1072
01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:18.459
me. Um, AND therefore I cannot expect great benefit

1073
01:06:18.459 --> 01:06:21.500
from cooperation with them. So that would be typically

1074
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.379
the kind of person that I would say was

1075
01:06:24.379 --> 01:06:27.739
responsible for whatever misfortune happens to them because I

1076
01:06:27.739 --> 01:06:30.780
don't want to be caught in that dilemma of

1077
01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:32.780
having to to support them to help them.

1078
01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.510
Uh, OK, so I was looking at the questions

1079
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:40.590
here you've already talked about witchcraft and karma earlier.

1080
01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.669
So let me just ask you one more question.

1081
01:06:42.719 --> 01:06:46.159
You've already mentioned also sexual assault. So in the

1082
01:06:46.159 --> 01:06:52.110
case of more modern industrialized societies, uh, OK, how

1083
01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:56.399
can we understand the phenomenon of victim devaluation in

1084
01:06:56.399 --> 01:06:59.459
the context of accidents, for example?

1085
01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:04.500
Well, That's a very good example because an accident,

1086
01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:08.239
um, the, the interesting thing about situations of accidents,

1087
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:10.780
but, you know, lots of other things will happen,

1088
01:07:11.229 --> 01:07:15.310
is that, um, part of the causation, part of

1089
01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:18.989
the causal chain that led to that particular event,

1090
01:07:19.459 --> 01:07:22.909
um, uh, some parts of it are opaque. Um,

1091
01:07:23.149 --> 01:07:26.040
SO if I have a car crash, you know,

1092
01:07:26.229 --> 01:07:30.120
um, Even if we exclude the obvious thing, like

1093
01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:33.520
I'm, you know, I wasn't wearing my, my glasses.

1094
01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:37.149
I was drunk, uh, the, the car didn't have

1095
01:07:37.149 --> 01:07:39.600
brakes or stuff like that. Even if we exclude

1096
01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.239
all this, there's a whole domain of possible collision

1097
01:07:42.239 --> 01:07:48.189
that imply my responsibility more than others. So, um,

1098
01:07:48.389 --> 01:07:52.439
um. And it's quite interesting that uh when people

1099
01:07:52.439 --> 01:07:58.379
are afflicted by misfortune, accidents or illness, um, people

1100
01:07:58.379 --> 01:08:07.510
spontaneously, um, Generate hypothesis about possible responsibility. Um, YOU

1101
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:09.629
know, if you hear about someone, this is something

1102
01:08:09.629 --> 01:08:11.830
that I want to test them. We haven't tested

1103
01:08:11.830 --> 01:08:16.589
that systematically, but It's a familiar phenomenon, um, you

1104
01:08:16.589 --> 01:08:21.410
know, anecdotally that, um, You know, someone tells you

1105
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:26.359
that someone got a particular, you know, illness, diseases,

1106
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:32.169
cancer or something. Very often people will ask questions

1107
01:08:32.169 --> 01:08:36.330
about their lifestyles, about things like that, and I

1108
01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:40.729
think it's not, it's related to this question of

1109
01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:44.529
to what extent is something that would be partly

1110
01:08:44.529 --> 01:08:47.959
their responsibility, you know, did she smoke a lot?

1111
01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:51.560
Did you eat lots of, you know, bad food,

1112
01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:54.950
uh, stuff like that? Why would people be interested

1113
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:57.209
in that? I think it's not just for the

1114
01:08:57.209 --> 01:09:00.649
epistemic interest of understanding the world around you. There's

1115
01:09:00.649 --> 01:09:04.770
also, um, a rather sort of motivated aspect to

1116
01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:08.969
that which is that Well, to the extent that

1117
01:09:08.969 --> 01:09:13.729
this person, um, got that, um, caught that disease,

1118
01:09:13.769 --> 01:09:16.328
and it's a disease that typically is related to

1119
01:09:16.328 --> 01:09:20.858
something they could have avoided. Then that is um

1120
01:09:20.858 --> 01:09:23.499
precious for us to know because it calibrates the

1121
01:09:23.499 --> 01:09:26.818
level of help that others could expect us to

1122
01:09:26.818 --> 01:09:30.140
provide to that person. Um, I think it's, it's,

1123
01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:34.220
um, it's something that's very common. It's not easy

1124
01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.479
to, um, to, it's not very easy to, to,

1125
01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:40.979
to put that in sort of, um, uh, clear

1126
01:09:40.979 --> 01:09:43.850
experimental protocols where we could sort of see, uh,

1127
01:09:43.899 --> 01:09:47.379
see what happens. Um, BUT it's true that, um,

1128
01:09:47.819 --> 01:09:50.729
uh, and I'm sure you've experienced that, that everyone

1129
01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:53.580
experienced that, that, you know, you, uh, you had

1130
01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:56.490
some problem, you, I, I failed at a particular

1131
01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:59.339
thing. And then immediately people are wondering, well, did

1132
01:09:59.339 --> 01:10:01.899
you prepare, you know, did you take all the

1133
01:10:01.899 --> 01:10:04.390
precautions? Did you do all that was supposed to

1134
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:08.100
be done? Um, AGAIN, these questions, and it's a

1135
01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:11.859
general sort of point about doing evolutionary psychology or

1136
01:10:11.859 --> 01:10:15.970
anthropology, is that All those things are completely obvious

1137
01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:19.259
to us that people would ask those questions and

1138
01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:23.410
we would ask those questions. Um, BUT precisely they're

1139
01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:25.959
obvious to us because we share the same psychology.

1140
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:29.410
We are the same species. And, um, from the

1141
01:10:29.410 --> 01:10:31.970
point of view of, you know, natural selection, there's

1142
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:35.930
nothing natural about these questions. Um, THAT'S the, it's

1143
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:38.609
just, I mean, nothing natural. What I mean is

1144
01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:42.209
nothing self-evident about those questions. Um, IT'S the same

1145
01:10:42.209 --> 01:10:46.279
as, um, You know, in the case of, uh,

1146
01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:49.629
disease and witchcraft, uh, people say we have to

1147
01:10:49.629 --> 01:10:53.160
understand why this person got sick at this point.

1148
01:10:54.359 --> 01:10:56.620
All of us think that is a very natural

1149
01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:59.390
question to ask, so we think it's self-evident that

1150
01:10:59.390 --> 01:11:02.750
we should ask that question. However, that question carries

1151
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:09.790
almost no, no lesson for that would be useful

1152
01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:12.270
to us. That is, if I'm telling you that

1153
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:17.430
this person got sick because her grandmother was had

1154
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:21.299
bewitched her. How does that help you in any

1155
01:11:21.299 --> 01:11:25.339
of your, you know, uh, endeavors? It doesn't. So

1156
01:11:25.339 --> 01:11:27.580
there must be another reason for those questions for

1157
01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:31.259
the, and it's general in, in, in, in evolutionary

1158
01:11:31.259 --> 01:11:35.970
psychology that what you end up doing is making

1159
01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:40.669
the very obvious, completely unobvious or unintuitive or certainly

1160
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:41.740
not self-evident.

1161
01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:46.740
Great, so just before we go, Doctor Boyer, would

1162
01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:49.259
you like to tell people where they can find

1163
01:11:49.259 --> 01:11:50.939
your work on the internet?

1164
01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.370
Oh well. I think these days it's very easy

1165
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:58.169
to find anything you want on the internet, so

1166
01:11:58.729 --> 01:12:02.580
they should just go to the webpage of, of,

1167
01:12:02.589 --> 01:12:07.439
um, the webpage that have, which is best cowboyer.net,

1168
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:11.339
and, um, and so there's all these articles, the

1169
01:12:11.339 --> 01:12:13.850
references to all these things, but, you know, Google

1170
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:16.209
Scholar or, you know, all these things can give

1171
01:12:16.209 --> 01:12:18.479
you those that same information.

1172
01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:22.069
Great, so thank you so much for taking the

1173
01:12:22.069 --> 01:12:23.750
time to come on the show again, as I

1174
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:25.950
said at the beginning, it's always a pleasure to

1175
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:26.580
talk to you.

1176
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.410
Thank you, thank you, and it's always a pleasure,

1177
01:12:29.419 --> 01:12:33.100
and I would um tell people who just watched

1178
01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.259
