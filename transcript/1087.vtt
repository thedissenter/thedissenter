All of that I'm leaving in the description down

10
00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:37.229
below. So, Doctor Groski, welcome to the show. It's

11
00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:38.639
a huge pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:41.259
Thank you for having me, Ricardo.

13
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.540
OK, so today we're going to go through some

14
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.830
topics related to men's sexuality like erectile dysfunction, premature

15
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.740
ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, and we're also going to talk

16
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.069
a little bit about pelvic health. So to start

17
00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:02.069
off with, let me ask you about erectile dysfunction.

18
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.540
So, first of all, what counts as erectile dysfunction?

19
00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:08.699
How is it diagnosed basically?

20
00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:14.349
Yeah. So erectile dysfunction is a persistent and consistent

21
00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:20.389
inability to Achieve or maintain an erection, and it

22
00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:24.110
also has to be distressing for either the individual

23
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.480
experiencing these changes and or for their coupleship or

24
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.489
their partner. I stress persistent and consistent because on

25
00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:37.169
the occasion of having waxing and waning erections is

26
00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:40.500
no pathology, right? So, any person with a penis

27
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.889
at any point in their lifetime may experience a

28
00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:46.089
waxing and waning of an erection, but that doesn't

29
00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:50.970
mean that they have erectile dysfunction. Now, there are

30
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.489
a few categories of erectile dysfunction. You have vasculogenic,

31
00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.129
which is predominantly a blood flow issue. Then you

32
00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:03.889
have a psychogenic, which is more of the mental

33
00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:10.839
emotional components that can impact sexual function. Both of

34
00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.598
which can be occurring at the same time, right?

35
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:18.238
So it's important to have a medical team that

36
00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:21.078
can rule in or rule out the multiple contributing

37
00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:23.348
factors to sexual dysfunction.

38
00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.669
And, and what, what causes it basically, I mean,

39
00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.860
what are the main factors behind erectile dysfunction?

40
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.309
So the biggest items that impact sexual function for

41
00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:43.360
men are cardiovascular disease. Diabetes, cardio metabolic uh syndrome,

42
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.619
which is, you know, the increase in abdominal visceral

43
00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:53.619
fat, uh, sedentary lifestyle, uh, changes within the blood

44
00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:56.949
sugar levels, cardiovascular health, etc. It's just an umbrella.

45
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.649
Term for, hey, we're going down a path that

46
00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:03.410
might not be conducive to optimal erectile function, in

47
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.169
addition to other other things. But the bigger, the

48
00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.880
big two items are cardiovascular disease and, uh, diabetes.

49
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.399
And in fact, having persistent ongoing reduction of erectile

50
00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:17.720
function. Uh, HAS been said by the literature to

51
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.809
be an indicator of an adverse cardiovascular event within

52
00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:25.800
3 years. So it's really important to get your

53
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.880
heart health checked in order to preserve your heart

54
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.619
health.

55
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.339
Uh, CAN it be caused simply by aging? Is

56
00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:39.740
the simple process, the simple and normal process of

57
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.300
aging, can it also contribute to erectile dysfunction in

58
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.850
any way?

59
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.220
Right. That's a really good point that you're bringing

60
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.660
up. So, in my experience, yes, that can be

61
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.399
a factor, right? As we age our Body changes.

62
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.839
And so do our, our nerves, our vasculature, the

63
00:03:55.839 --> 00:04:00.039
tone of our muscles, uh, our physical ability may

64
00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.869
change just depending on what our overall health status.

65
00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.520
I think I'd like to stress that it's the

66
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.800
overall health status that is going to be a

67
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.479
greater indicator of sexual function. Because you do have

68
00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:14.649
individuals who are in their 70s and 80s that

69
00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:18.399
have no difficulty with achieving or maintaining an erection.

70
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.089
So I don't like to chalk it up to

71
00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.170
age, right? Oh, it's just getting, I'm, I'm just

72
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.209
getting older and it's a, it's, it's, it is

73
00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:27.359
what it is, because there are things to optimize

74
00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:29.890
sexual function and it's not just about age, but

75
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.290
that can certainly be a factor.

76
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.149
Can it be psychogenic? I mean, are there psychological

77
00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:41.209
factors that can contribute to erectile dysfunction?

78
00:04:41.859 --> 00:04:47.190
Absolutely 100%, and they're often not separate from when

79
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.630
there is a physical issue contributing to sexual dysfunction

80
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.109
because it In my experience working with men. When

81
00:04:56.109 --> 00:04:59.899
erectile difficulty or variance occurs, all it takes is

82
00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.670
one time for that to be in the back

83
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.859
of their mind, right? Is it going to happen

84
00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:06.339
this time? Am I going to be able to

85
00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:08.559
have an erection? What is my partner going to

86
00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:12.220
think? You know, there's so many pressures placed, I

87
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.660
feel, on men or people who have penises to

88
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.459
perform, to have a rigid heart erection 100% of

89
00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:22.220
the time. And it doesn't matter what contextually is

90
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.984
going on in that. Since's life, because their penis

91
00:05:24.984 --> 00:05:29.225
is a machine. That is a huge mistake as

92
00:05:29.225 --> 00:05:32.984
far as understanding how human beings operate. And, and

93
00:05:32.984 --> 00:05:34.584
the less pressure we can place on men, the

94
00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:38.024
better. So yes, psychogenic factors do play a role

95
00:05:38.024 --> 00:05:40.424
because the brain is the biggest sex organ when

96
00:05:40.424 --> 00:05:45.934
it comes to our sexual function. It can amplify

97
00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:49.625
neurochemical processes in the body, and it can also

98
00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:53.890
inhibit or dampen neurochemical processes in the body. So

99
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.329
if we're nervous, if we're anxious about something, what

100
00:05:57.329 --> 00:06:02.089
happens to our body? Our muscles constrict, vasculature, you

101
00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:04.739
get vaso constriction, which we don't want in the

102
00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:07.089
penis, right? We don't want the arteries to constrict,

103
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.130
we want them to dilate. There's a whole symphony

104
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.209
orchestra of events that occur in order to achieve

105
00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:16.970
an erection, and if the brain perceives that there's

106
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.480
any potential threat, physically or emotionally, then things are

107
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.869
gonna go wrong. So it's important it's really important

108
00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:28.510
to know the physiology of that of the erectile

109
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.399
process and also the ejaculatory process in order to

110
00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:36.100
understand how our bodies operate, but unfortunately, traditional sex

111
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.790
education does not in our social, at least I

112
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.549
can only speak to the United States, like, that

113
00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:43.109
is not something that we are educated on and

114
00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:46.190
Sex is such an important part, like pooping, peeing

115
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.559
and sex is are vital functions to the human

116
00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:53.519
existence, really. And like, no, we're not talking about

117
00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:55.679
these things, we're not being educated on how these

118
00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:57.640
parts of our body operate, and we don't do

119
00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.160
that with anything else, right? We learn how to

120
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.720
drive a car, we learn how to walk, we

121
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.720
learn how to read, we learn how to do

122
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.720
our job, right? But the things that we rely

123
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.239
on every day is so stigmatized.

124
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.880
Well, we're doing that here today. So, um, in

125
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.839
one of your videos, I heard you talking about

126
00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:21.450
erectile worries. So what is the difference between erectile

127
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:27.239
dysfunction and erectile worry and how can people uh

128
00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:28.589
notice the difference?

129
00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:32.859
Yeah, so erectile worry may also be said to,

130
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:37.220
uh, as performance anxiety, right? So I, I tend

131
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.299
to say worry because if there is a genuine

132
00:07:40.299 --> 00:07:44.130
concern, right? If you're having sexual changes that are

133
00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:48.339
really distressing for you or for your partnership, it's

134
00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:51.179
normal to have some worrying. I'm trying to really

135
00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:54.989
to say that is to normalize one's emotional experience

136
00:07:54.989 --> 00:07:58.630
around changes with their body. So from one point

137
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.350
of view, having erectile worry is a normal thing

138
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.329
because something's different. And we don't know what's going

139
00:08:05.329 --> 00:08:09.679
on, and there may have been a negative experience

140
00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:12.010
around changes with their body as far as erectile

141
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:19.250
function. If it becomes persistent, consistent, and really starts

142
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:24.019
to Infiltrate their life in a way that they

143
00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:28.540
start to avoid sexual activity or sexual intimacy, then

144
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.779
that becomes a problem, right? Because now we're using

145
00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:35.890
behavioral strategies to cope with changes in their body

146
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.659
in a way that is maladaptive and, and, or

147
00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.929
maybe, uh, not beneficial for them or their partner,

148
00:08:42.058 --> 00:08:43.820
right? And this is a theme that I do

149
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.099
hear with working with men is the tendency is

150
00:08:47.099 --> 00:08:51.802
to, well, if I can't For air quotes here

151
00:08:51.802 --> 00:08:54.112
in this particular way, then I'd rather just not

152
00:08:54.112 --> 00:08:56.843
do it at all. And that's really, you know,

153
00:08:57.043 --> 00:09:00.072
I know that that is coming from perhaps anxiety

154
00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:04.023
and nervousness, but the avoidant behavior only perpetuates the

155
00:09:04.023 --> 00:09:07.752
problem. And it also creates a huge wedge in

156
00:09:07.752 --> 00:09:10.242
between the relationship. And when, generally, when people want

157
00:09:10.242 --> 00:09:13.083
to have sex, they're not having sex just to

158
00:09:13.083 --> 00:09:15.312
get a hard on or to have penis vagina

159
00:09:15.312 --> 00:09:18.026
sex, really. People are having sex because they want

160
00:09:18.026 --> 00:09:22.306
to feel close and connected and desired and loved

161
00:09:22.306 --> 00:09:26.306
in that experience and experience mutual shared pleasure. It,

162
00:09:26.385 --> 00:09:28.906
it's, it's really not about how hard the erection

163
00:09:28.906 --> 00:09:32.786
is. But unfortunately, again, if we're not talking about

164
00:09:32.786 --> 00:09:34.585
what's, what's going on on the inside, if we're

165
00:09:34.585 --> 00:09:38.265
not having conversations around sex or, or just letting

166
00:09:38.265 --> 00:09:41.416
out those worries, it can really drive a wedge

167
00:09:41.416 --> 00:09:43.786
in between your own sexuality, but also with your

168
00:09:43.786 --> 00:09:44.185
partner.

169
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.640
That that's a very interesting point. We're also going

170
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.400
to talk about other issues as I mentioned in

171
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.710
the introduction when it comes to men's sexuality here,

172
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.030
but do you think that apart from the important

173
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.580
fact that men should or People with businesses should

174
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.099
communicate about these issues to their doctors. Do you

175
00:10:06.099 --> 00:10:09.940
think that they should also talk about them, express

176
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.659
them in any way to their partners? Do you

177
00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:14.650
think that helps in any way?

178
00:10:14.969 --> 00:10:19.979
Absolutely, 100%. Because if we're holding something on the

179
00:10:19.979 --> 00:10:22.820
inside and we're nervous about it, our tendency as

180
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.780
humans is to think over and over and over

181
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.500
about it, feeling very isolated and siloed. We're already

182
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:34.309
in a culture that Has messages or portrays these

183
00:10:34.309 --> 00:10:38.309
messages that men should be, uh, uh, you know,

184
00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:41.469
this man up term or be able to be

185
00:10:41.469 --> 00:10:45.390
independent and regulate their emotions, uh, and not share

186
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.299
emotion because that is a sign of weakness or

187
00:10:47.299 --> 00:10:51.390
vulnerability. Uh, THAT is, again, an unfortunate type of

188
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:57.820
messaging because it really just creates Isolation, loneliness, and

189
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:03.099
feeling siloed with very common experiences that all that

190
00:11:03.099 --> 00:11:04.900
all men at some point in their life will

191
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.109
experience. And that's where more fear and anxiety will

192
00:11:08.109 --> 00:11:11.840
stem from because we're You know, if I, if

193
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.159
I, you know, let's say, hit my thumb on

194
00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:17.359
my car door, or like, you know, hit my

195
00:11:17.359 --> 00:11:19.320
elbow somewhere and my funny bone starts to make

196
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.919
it feel, we know that. Why? Because we know

197
00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:23.919
other people experience it. I can talk to my

198
00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:25.559
friend. I can say, hey, I, you know, my

199
00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:27.750
elbow hurts or I've got this thing going on,

200
00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:29.960
and they're sharing their experiences, and then that kind

201
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.159
of normalizes and our brain kind of calms down.

202
00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:34.799
So like, oh, I'm not alone. Oh, this is

203
00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:36.799
normal or this is common. Oh, there's hope for

204
00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:41.419
that. For sexual dysfunction, for sexual pain, for anything

205
00:11:41.419 --> 00:11:45.460
pooping, peeing and sex for men. Where's the conversation?

206
00:11:46.659 --> 00:11:49.659
There's no conversation. There, there, there's no conversation. So

207
00:11:49.659 --> 00:11:52.140
they're left in the dark with these symptoms that

208
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.539
are very distressing, without the education, without the knowledge,

209
00:11:55.619 --> 00:11:58.179
and also without feeling empowered to do something about

210
00:11:58.179 --> 00:12:01.460
it. That's the problem. So yes, I do think

211
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.739
communication is, is very important to your point about

212
00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:07.940
medical providers and to their partners. There was a

213
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.849
very, it's an oldie but a goodie from like

214
00:12:10.849 --> 00:12:13.780
1995 or 1997, don't quote me on the year

215
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.419
of this survey, it was a US poll of

216
00:12:15.419 --> 00:12:18.260
500 individuals, men and women, and they were asked

217
00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.020
the question. Would you, how comfortable, you know, would

218
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.340
you feel comfortable addressing sexual health concerns with your,

219
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.979
with your medical provider? Over 70% of them said

220
00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:31.929
no, that they would not ask their provider related,

221
00:12:31.979 --> 00:12:35.059
you know, to, to, to sexual health and for

222
00:12:35.059 --> 00:12:37.140
one of the reasons feeling that they, that no

223
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.429
one would be able to help them. Or that

224
00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:42.950
they would make their doctor embarrassed, and they didn't

225
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.869
want to embarrass their doctor. But we do know

226
00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:50.349
from the literature that patients, individuals, people want their

227
00:12:50.349 --> 00:12:53.260
providers to ask them questions around sexual health. Why?

228
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.150
Because that's an invitation to say, hey, let's talk

229
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.349
about sex. Sexual health is important, just like your

230
00:12:59.349 --> 00:13:02.739
physical health, your emotional health, your spiritual health. All

231
00:13:02.739 --> 00:13:05.349
of these four pillars are aspects to you as

232
00:13:05.349 --> 00:13:08.270
a whole human being that are important. Let's talk

233
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.710
about it. And then that invitation gives that person

234
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.500
permission to share what's been there on their heart

235
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.054
and mind. And then get help for their shoes.

236
00:13:16.244 --> 00:13:18.684
Now related to their, you know, communicating with their

237
00:13:18.684 --> 00:13:22.364
partner, of course, because here's the thing, we start

238
00:13:22.364 --> 00:13:25.835
acting differently, we start acting weird when something is

239
00:13:25.835 --> 00:13:30.205
wrong, our behavior is, is different, and only because

240
00:13:30.205 --> 00:13:33.684
those are protecting mechanisms, not because you're inherently weird

241
00:13:33.684 --> 00:13:36.375
or like trying to do this on purpose, but

242
00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:39.125
because you're afraid. There's fear underneath that, there's fear

243
00:13:39.125 --> 00:13:42.364
of rejection, there's fear of being judged. There's there's

244
00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:46.409
fear of of How our partners is going to

245
00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:49.210
react. You know, all those things, there's fear of

246
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.219
losing a partner. And that's when we start to

247
00:13:52.219 --> 00:13:55.380
distance ourselves from the relationship again, only creating this

248
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.179
wedge in between the relationship and what does the

249
00:13:57.179 --> 00:14:00.820
partner do? The partner starts to notice immediately, because

250
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.739
who's the one that knows us like the back

251
00:14:02.739 --> 00:14:04.900
of our hand, the person we live with day

252
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.380
in and day out, who we know how to

253
00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.380
press buttons, you know? You know, it's the person

254
00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.979
that we get the most irritated with. It's because

255
00:14:11.979 --> 00:14:13.700
we love each other. You're with each other all

256
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.340
the time, but that also Means that whenever our

257
00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.500
behavior starts to change, we know, you know, what's

258
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.179
going on. And then we're not gonna, you know,

259
00:14:22.219 --> 00:14:25.250
the partner feels a little apprehensive sometimes to ask.

260
00:14:25.539 --> 00:14:27.780
And then we're in our brain trying to fill

261
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.940
in the blanks. What does our brain do? Make

262
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.869
terrible assumptions about what's going on. And then here

263
00:14:33.869 --> 00:14:37.140
you go. We've got more separation, more tension, more

264
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.859
resentment, more distance. So, as the number one skill

265
00:14:41.859 --> 00:14:46.030
to have with any sexual dysfunction, is to embrace

266
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.909
practicing communication skills, no matter how difficult it is,

267
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.830
no matter how vulnerable and scary it is. Of

268
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.859
course, the first time when you try something new,

269
00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:54.630
you're going to fumble through it. It's not going

270
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.309
to be perfect. It's just share what's been on

271
00:14:57.309 --> 00:14:59.909
your heart, you know, share that, this is scary

272
00:14:59.909 --> 00:15:01.309
for me to say, but I need to say

273
00:15:01.309 --> 00:15:03.710
it because I want you to be my erotic

274
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.229
friend and ally. You are my erotic friend and

275
00:15:06.229 --> 00:15:06.789
ally.

276
00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:11.179
Great. So uh let me ask you now about

277
00:15:11.179 --> 00:15:16.059
premature ejaculation. So first of all, what counts as

278
00:15:16.059 --> 00:15:19.929
such, what is premature ejaculation, what is, let's say

279
00:15:19.929 --> 00:15:23.200
the normal duration of intercourse?

280
00:15:23.859 --> 00:15:27.940
Yes, so the normal duration of intercourse is approximately

281
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.539
5 to 7 minutes. That's the average. And, and

282
00:15:31.539 --> 00:15:34.650
when I say intercourse, it's the research is around

283
00:15:34.869 --> 00:15:42.169
vaginal intercourse. So, so intravaginal time to ejaculation, approximately

284
00:15:42.169 --> 00:15:45.090
5 to 7 minutes. Now, do you have a

285
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.409
wide spectrum of time? Of course you do. Of

286
00:15:48.409 --> 00:15:50.739
course you do. Those are not hard and fast

287
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:56.000
time markers or time stamps to hold firmly around.

288
00:15:56.989 --> 00:16:02.090
Now, with early ejaculation, also known as premature ejaculation,

289
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.770
According to literature, it's less than 1 to 2

290
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:13.169
minutes with, again, vaginal uh penetration. OK. That doesn't

291
00:16:13.169 --> 00:16:17.119
mean, though, that this isn't distressing for someone who

292
00:16:17.489 --> 00:16:22.200
feels like they, their body just does body things,

293
00:16:22.409 --> 00:16:24.419
and they don't feel like they have a say

294
00:16:24.419 --> 00:16:27.729
so in that conversation. So that could be outside

295
00:16:27.729 --> 00:16:30.929
of vaginal or anal intercourse. That could be with

296
00:16:30.929 --> 00:16:34.049
masturbation, that could be with any type of touch.

297
00:16:34.289 --> 00:16:38.429
It doesn't have to be with intercourse. Whenever the

298
00:16:38.429 --> 00:16:42.229
person feels distressed, worried, again, same thing with erectile

299
00:16:42.229 --> 00:16:46.109
dysfunction, if it's persistent, consistent and distressing for the

300
00:16:46.109 --> 00:16:49.099
person and or their partner, then it becomes an

301
00:16:49.099 --> 00:16:52.989
issue. But here's the thing, again, there are different

302
00:16:52.989 --> 00:16:57.869
level gradients of arousal. And that is going to

303
00:16:57.869 --> 00:17:02.000
fluctuate based on context, how horny you are. When

304
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.118
was the last time you had sex? What's the

305
00:17:04.118 --> 00:17:09.430
visual, visual, all the sensory cues, visual, smell, auditory,

306
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.400
you know, is this a new partner? Is this

307
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.670
a partner you've been with for for a while?

308
00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.640
Has this been going on all your life? And

309
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.089
that would be more of a, um, Uh, not

310
00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:24.800
acquired premature ejaculation, but, um, a lifelong premature ejaculation,

311
00:17:24.969 --> 00:17:28.050
right? So it just depends, but I say again,

312
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:33.890
it's multifactorial, the, the contributing factors to ejaculatory um.

313
00:17:35.099 --> 00:17:35.930
Function.

314
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.939
Mhm. Uh, BUT what are the main causes? I

315
00:17:39.939 --> 00:17:42.939
mean, either for, uh, I mean, I would imagine

316
00:17:42.939 --> 00:17:47.229
that perhaps there are different causes for lifelong premature

317
00:17:47.229 --> 00:17:51.060
ejaculation and the, the other kind of e premature

318
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.180
ejaculation you mentioned there, but what are the main

319
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.089
causes really?

320
00:17:55.739 --> 00:17:57.819
Yeah, this is a good one because we really

321
00:17:57.819 --> 00:18:01.219
don't have conclusive evidence around what might be the

322
00:18:01.219 --> 00:18:04.530
causes. Uh, THERE are some potential theories around like

323
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:09.439
hormones. Uh, THERE'S also uh theories around medication withdrawal,

324
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.459
like if, especially if you're coming off of like

325
00:18:11.459 --> 00:18:16.140
opioid medications or recreational drugs. And there's also talk

326
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:21.010
around just inherent Sensitivity, so having your own genetics

327
00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.089
and neural wiring that just makes this area a

328
00:18:24.089 --> 00:18:26.930
little bit more sensitive for physically in that area

329
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:30.369
and also in our brains. There's also, uh, some

330
00:18:30.369 --> 00:18:34.930
literature around having diabetes that can also contribute to

331
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:40.609
premature ejaculation. Um, AND also some literature around pelvic

332
00:18:40.609 --> 00:18:46.380
floor. Function and pelvic floor tension. So, I'll have

333
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.439
a visual aid if I may. This is more

334
00:18:50.439 --> 00:18:54.699
of my wheelhouse here, just to orient the audience.

335
00:18:54.859 --> 00:18:56.939
So we're talking about the pelvic floor, it's everything

336
00:18:56.939 --> 00:18:59.719
in between your butt bones. And you have a

337
00:18:59.719 --> 00:19:02.760
few layers of muscles here. You have superficial layers

338
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.959
that look like a triangle that are wrapped around

339
00:19:04.959 --> 00:19:08.280
the penis. You have the external anal sphincter, and

340
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.719
then you have the deep pelvic floor muscles that

341
00:19:11.079 --> 00:19:13.359
essentially live in the bottom of the bowl and

342
00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:15.359
support all the organs, your bladder, your prostate, and

343
00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:17.880
your rectum, and they're like a sling like a

344
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.890
hammock arrangement on the inside. For the purposes of

345
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:28.439
of ejaculation function, these muscles are important players. Isiocavernosis,

346
00:19:28.579 --> 00:19:33.630
bulbo spongyiosis, and transverse perineal muscles, and their nerves,

347
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.349
they communicate with, they attach to and support the

348
00:19:37.349 --> 00:19:41.260
bulb of the penis, but their function is to

349
00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.939
contract and relax, contract and relax during ejaculation. Their

350
00:19:44.939 --> 00:19:49.859
function is also to assist in erection. So Ere

351
00:19:49.859 --> 00:19:54.130
erectile dysfunction or sexual dysfunction and or ejaculation issues,

352
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.060
we're interested about what's going on here and what

353
00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.329
the function is, and the muscle nerve communication here,

354
00:20:00.459 --> 00:20:03.219
because that plays a role as far as messages

355
00:20:03.219 --> 00:20:05.219
going to the spinal cord in your brain. Now,

356
00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:11.270
if someone has like, Unknown or involuntary habitual tension,

357
00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:14.719
you know, in this area, or maybe they're having

358
00:20:14.719 --> 00:20:18.599
weakness in this area. That's where a pelvic floor

359
00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:22.390
physical therapist comes in because we're assessing the actual

360
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:27.979
mus muscle nerve, uh, communication and function. In relation

361
00:20:27.979 --> 00:20:31.699
to ejaculation and erection. So, we will work on

362
00:20:31.699 --> 00:20:36.020
coordination and communication. So in pelvic floor therapy, what

363
00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.180
we are most focused on working on is pelvic

364
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:44.010
floor coordination and muscle nerve communication. We also tie

365
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.979
that to if, if the therapist has sexuality, counseling

366
00:20:47.979 --> 00:20:50.699
or education as a background like myself, then I

367
00:20:50.699 --> 00:20:56.930
couple that with specific training related to arousal. Arousal.

368
00:20:57.099 --> 00:20:59.900
So, allowing them to do lower back and pelvic

369
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.540
movements that perhaps mimic movements that they might be

370
00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:09.339
in during sexual activity, and also talking about Masturbation

371
00:21:09.339 --> 00:21:13.459
techniques. Part of the, so this could be part

372
00:21:13.459 --> 00:21:18.459
of acquired or lifelong habits around how you're stimulating

373
00:21:18.459 --> 00:21:22.900
your penis. In general, again, I totally do not

374
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.680
have a penis. However, I have worked with hundreds

375
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.079
and hundreds of penises. And the theme that I'm

376
00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:37.790
noticing around often ejaculatory issues or early ejaculation. Is

377
00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.790
that they, their penis is used to a particular

378
00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:46.959
stimulation. With their hand Fast, hard, quick, really to

379
00:21:46.959 --> 00:21:49.280
just get it to get it done, right? There

380
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.479
isn't this like, uh, ritual around like taking it

381
00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:56.680
slow, touching their body, allowing themselves to feel their

382
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.880
arousing arousal gradients. You know, generally, when, uh, men

383
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.939
are Exploring their bodies, or, you know, think about

384
00:22:04.939 --> 00:22:07.900
growing up. You're doing it in secret, you're trying

385
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.500
to hurry up. Maybe you're in the bathroom, you

386
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.819
got a house full of family, you know, you're

387
00:22:11.819 --> 00:22:13.540
like, I don't have time, I don't wanna, I

388
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.579
don't wanna get caught. You know, there's all these

389
00:22:15.579 --> 00:22:18.660
things, and so how the penis gets stimulated is

390
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:23.939
how the penis then learns to respond with ejaculation.

391
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.790
And that that can be the issue as well,

392
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.589
or having a firmer grip or etc. ETC. So

393
00:22:31.589 --> 00:22:35.829
part of the process of learning a different way

394
00:22:35.829 --> 00:22:40.069
or learning to enhance or expand your sexual pleasure,

395
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.530
is to really slow down. To talk about what

396
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.010
your techniques, what you've been doing, and maybe do

397
00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:49.099
things a little differently. And that includes like using

398
00:22:49.099 --> 00:22:52.650
lubricant maybe during masturbation. I know I'm probably stepping

399
00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.250
ahead to like techniques and things, but this is

400
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.530
all part of the process of helping the body

401
00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:01.439
adapt to stimulation in varying ways that are going

402
00:23:01.439 --> 00:23:05.329
to allow you to enhance your sexual pleasure, rather

403
00:23:05.329 --> 00:23:08.530
than, you know, curtail your sexual pleasure. But on

404
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.849
top of that, psychologically, just like with erectile dysfunction,

405
00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:15.410
If you're again, if you're nervous about it, if

406
00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.449
you're worried about it, if you're um trying really

407
00:23:18.449 --> 00:23:21.339
hard, like squeezing all of your muscles, you know,

408
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.400
remember I just talked about these muscles. If you're

409
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.489
tense here, that's only going to contribute to what

410
00:23:26.489 --> 00:23:29.089
do these muscles do when they ejaculate, squeeze like

411
00:23:29.089 --> 00:23:32.810
a squeeze like a we're tense, that can trigger

412
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:36.660
the ejaculatory reflex because you're trying so hard to

413
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.170
not come, to not ejaculate, that it's actually making

414
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.880
it worse. So what we tried to do is

415
00:23:43.329 --> 00:23:48.729
create relaxation, work with breathing techniques, slowing down. I'm

416
00:23:48.729 --> 00:23:51.439
not a fan of, sometimes you'll hear like um

417
00:23:52.589 --> 00:23:56.239
The squeeze technique for e for ejaculatory, uh, or

418
00:23:56.239 --> 00:23:59.359
premature ejaculation where you squeeze the glands to stop

419
00:23:59.359 --> 00:24:02.040
from ejaculation cause it's like, you know, reflex and

420
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.520
it's tells the spinal cord no, and what have

421
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.400
you. But again, that disrupts the erotic flow. It's

422
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.920
perpetuating the message that something's wrong with you, or

423
00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.000
the technique around start and stop, right? I know

424
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.520
the intention is, is well, right? It's, it's, you

425
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.739
know, stop, pause, but really it should be just

426
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.439
Shift, right? You're it's all about awareness. Notice where

427
00:24:26.439 --> 00:24:28.760
your arousal gradients are in the moment and just

428
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.959
shift a little bit. Shift a little bit to

429
00:24:30.959 --> 00:24:33.849
dial it back down. But if you abruptly start,

430
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.449
stop, you know, it's again too mechanical, you're in

431
00:24:36.449 --> 00:24:39.650
your head. It further perpetuates this thing about, there's

432
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.859
something wrong with me, and, and that's not what

433
00:24:42.859 --> 00:24:45.829
we want to continue as far as, uh, helping

434
00:24:45.829 --> 00:24:47.930
someone with their sexual dysfunction and distress. And that

435
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.709
also includes having conversations with their partner or partners

436
00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.760
around where the distress is coming from. How else

437
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:59.619
can you, uh, Enhance your sexual experience without uh

438
00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:03.349
feeling disappointed or blaming your partner or what have

439
00:25:03.349 --> 00:25:04.869
you. Uh YEAH.

440
00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.359
Right. So, uh, I mean, about the pelvic floor,

441
00:25:09.609 --> 00:25:12.609
we will probably have time to go back to

442
00:25:12.609 --> 00:25:15.290
that and talk also about pelvic pain a little

443
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:20.290
bit. But we've talked about premature ejaculation. What about

444
00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:24.920
delayed ejaculation? What is it and what causes it?

445
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.939
Yes, again, very interesting. Delayed ejaculation is the inability,

446
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:34.869
again, persistent and consistent inability to To or to

447
00:25:34.869 --> 00:25:37.989
ejaculate or orgasm. Now, orgasm and ejaculation are not

448
00:25:37.989 --> 00:25:42.140
the same thing. Ejaculation is a reflex driven by

449
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.630
uh spinal cord reflexes, the sympathetic nervous system. So

450
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.510
for erectile dysfunction, it's, in order to get an

451
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.989
erection, we have to be in that state of

452
00:25:49.989 --> 00:25:54.250
feeling relaxed and calm. With ejaculation, it flips the

453
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:58.489
switch to the default of adrenaline, fast, hard, heart

454
00:25:58.489 --> 00:26:02.449
rate increases that fight, flight or fawn mechanism, to

455
00:26:02.449 --> 00:26:07.819
put it simply. So with delayed ejaculation, It's the

456
00:26:07.819 --> 00:26:12.770
inability to uh ejaculate. Now, certainly, if someone had

457
00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:18.739
prostate cancer treatment that disrupted the neurovascular connection to

458
00:26:18.739 --> 00:26:20.660
the penis, that could be one of the causes,

459
00:26:20.699 --> 00:26:23.020
or if they had their prostate removed, they're gonna

460
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.219
have a dry ejaculate. Let's say they're on certain

461
00:26:26.219 --> 00:26:30.380
medications for enlarged prostate. That could also cause retrograde

462
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.739
ejaculation, which is ejaculate fluid goes back up into

463
00:26:33.739 --> 00:26:36.099
the bladder instead of coming out or the volume

464
00:26:36.099 --> 00:26:39.349
might be lower. So those are like physical causes

465
00:26:39.349 --> 00:26:43.469
that potentially might contribute to that. Other causes are

466
00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:50.189
being distracted, OK? During sex, feeling bored during sex.

467
00:26:50.229 --> 00:26:52.589
Again, it goes back to that awareness piece of

468
00:26:52.589 --> 00:26:56.310
arousal triggers, like, Are we doing the same thing

469
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.829
over and over again? Maybe that's gonna take a

470
00:26:58.829 --> 00:27:01.829
little longer to to come. And as as men

471
00:27:01.829 --> 00:27:04.430
get older, just like any other part of the

472
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:09.189
body, nerves get a little sluggish. They do. So

473
00:27:09.189 --> 00:27:12.949
you may need a little support to stimulate these

474
00:27:12.949 --> 00:27:15.619
nerve endings differently. And that's where we talk about

475
00:27:15.619 --> 00:27:19.709
like using vibrators, using lubricants, stimulating gels, uh, using

476
00:27:19.709 --> 00:27:23.660
visual cues in different ways, auditory and Uh, auditory

477
00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.540
and other senses, you know, changing it up a

478
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.319
bit because we're humans, we love routine, and we

479
00:27:29.319 --> 00:27:31.060
often tend to do the same things over and

480
00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.260
over again, and it loses its luster after a

481
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.109
while. I do also want to make note of

482
00:27:37.109 --> 00:27:40.170
when I say distraction. You know, if you're finding

483
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:44.250
yourself just scrolling porn, and like, because again, porn

484
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.400
is not inherently bad nor good in any way.

485
00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:51.530
It's, it's just a tool. But if you're finding

486
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.780
yourself just stimulating your penis and scrolling, you know,

487
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:56.880
and trying to find, you know, that one thing

488
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.239
and you're just scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, try to stimulate.

489
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.890
I mean, before you know it, you know, you're

490
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:04.430
45 minutes into it and nothing's happening. So we

491
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:06.849
don't wanna, we don't wanna train our bodies in

492
00:28:06.849 --> 00:28:09.489
that way either. So maybe taking breaks and using

493
00:28:09.489 --> 00:28:13.250
your own internal imagination, not being distracted perhaps by

494
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:16.449
an external stimulus, but again, bringing it back into

495
00:28:16.449 --> 00:28:20.369
the body, embodying your experience, feeling pleasure, and, and

496
00:28:20.369 --> 00:28:23.074
changing things up, you. You know, in different ways.

497
00:28:23.155 --> 00:28:26.594
So, uh, and, and medication as well can, you

498
00:28:26.594 --> 00:28:30.275
know, medication also can be a contributing factor. Um,

499
00:28:30.474 --> 00:28:34.515
THINGS like, uh, anxiety medications, for example, might be

500
00:28:34.515 --> 00:28:37.074
one of them as well. Uh, THERE'S, there's many

501
00:28:37.074 --> 00:28:42.395
others, but not necessarily my wheelhouse pharmaceuticals anyway, but

502
00:28:42.395 --> 00:28:43.869
yeah. Yeah.

503
00:28:44.349 --> 00:28:46.670
So this one I really have to ask you

504
00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:50.030
about because it's a very common anxiety among men.

505
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:52.819
What is normal penis size?

506
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.719
Yeah, so this is a question as well. Yeah,

507
00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.160
on average, an erect penis can be anywhere from

508
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.800
5 to 6 inches. Uh, I think flaccid, don't

509
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.280
quote me on this, maybe somewhere between 3, 3.5

510
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.280
to 4 perhaps. Here's the thing about penis size.

511
00:29:13.209 --> 00:29:15.890
There's no standard protocol on how to measure. So

512
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:19.689
when you're looking at these research papers, they're kind

513
00:29:19.689 --> 00:29:21.209
of all over the place as far as how

514
00:29:21.209 --> 00:29:26.770
the researchers chose to measure a penis, right? The

515
00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:31.459
other thing that research doesn't include is Mental stimulation,

516
00:29:31.739 --> 00:29:34.260
right? They, you may, they, they may be, it's

517
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.290
a, it's a research paper. So you're kind of

518
00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:39.859
going into a lab. They may synthetically give you

519
00:29:39.859 --> 00:29:43.219
an erection, or have you get your own erection,

520
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.420
but context matters as far as how hard and

521
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.219
how pleasurable things are. So we have to think

522
00:29:50.219 --> 00:29:53.689
about that from that perspective of like, This research

523
00:29:53.689 --> 00:29:56.449
is not taking into account all the factors that

524
00:29:56.449 --> 00:30:02.050
contribute to penile stimulation and function when we're, when

525
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.060
things are being measured. And the other thing is

526
00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:10.099
we have no data pool set from like, you

527
00:30:10.099 --> 00:30:12.579
know, it's not like they're taking all the men

528
00:30:12.579 --> 00:30:16.890
on this planet. Then making that conclusion that this

529
00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.170
is the average, you know, the data pool set

530
00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.520
is very small amount, uh, you know, 20 people,

531
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.930
sometimes 50, maybe 100, 200, but that's very, that's

532
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:30.969
very, very small sample data set. So penises come

533
00:30:30.969 --> 00:30:34.290
in all different shapes and size, just like vulvas,

534
00:30:34.449 --> 00:30:39.390
you know, lips, labia, clitoris. Scrotums and penises do

535
00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:43.489
come in different sizes and shapes and curvatures, etc.

536
00:30:43.709 --> 00:30:47.180
AND I'd like to normalize that for people. And

537
00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.579
there is this really good research by Dr. Nicole

538
00:30:49.579 --> 00:30:53.030
Prousey, I believe it's from 2023, I'm not mistaken,

539
00:30:53.099 --> 00:30:56.380
but they did do a study, a survey study,

540
00:30:56.969 --> 00:31:01.530
a qualitative qualitative study around what do women prefer?

541
00:31:01.819 --> 00:31:03.969
And what do, what do women like as far

542
00:31:03.969 --> 00:31:08.569
as penis sizes? And what they found was women

543
00:31:08.569 --> 00:31:12.770
in long term relationships. Really didn't, they, they didn't,

544
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:15.010
they didn't really care about how big the, the

545
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.530
size of the penis was, girth or lengthwise, because

546
00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:20.040
it was the emotional connection that mattered the most,

547
00:31:20.089 --> 00:31:23.089
and they had very, you know, highly positive sexual

548
00:31:23.089 --> 00:31:26.569
experiences. There was some note about those that are

549
00:31:26.569 --> 00:31:30.989
in casual sexual or recreational sex. Uh, PREFERRING, uh,

550
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.819
greater girth than length, and that makes sense, uh,

551
00:31:34.829 --> 00:31:38.790
A, because it's just casual sex. There's generally no,

552
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.319
none of that emotional entanglement. Um, IT'S more of

553
00:31:42.319 --> 00:31:46.069
the physical sensation and pleasure aspect of things, perhaps.

554
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.239
Um, AND the girth, when we're talking about vaginas,

555
00:31:49.359 --> 00:31:53.800
like during intercourse, vaginal, uh, stimulation is more pressure

556
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.719
sensors in there. So it's not length, it's pressure

557
00:31:56.719 --> 00:32:00.055
sensors. And again, It was a small set, a

558
00:32:00.055 --> 00:32:03.574
small set of individuals. But the preferred, you know,

559
00:32:03.694 --> 00:32:07.015
the preferred, uh, was not too big, not too

560
00:32:07.015 --> 00:32:10.375
small, and the emotional connection, uh, in, in couple

561
00:32:10.375 --> 00:32:14.295
ships for sure. So, again, taking the pressure off

562
00:32:14.295 --> 00:32:16.015
of men around their penis size, because here's the

563
00:32:16.015 --> 00:32:18.214
thing too, you're born with what you have. You,

564
00:32:18.295 --> 00:32:20.405
you got with what you're, what you're born with.

565
00:32:20.775 --> 00:32:23.974
And why go to these great lengths to try

566
00:32:23.974 --> 00:32:28.099
to augment or change or, um, Yeah, I guess

567
00:32:28.099 --> 00:32:31.530
not just being accepting more and loving yourself and

568
00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.180
and feeling and being confident in that because sex

569
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.530
isn't just about your penis. Yeah,

570
00:32:38.109 --> 00:32:42.469
and the semen volume matter, is that something that

571
00:32:42.469 --> 00:32:44.160
men should worry about?

572
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:50.520
So semen volume fluctuates, uh, fluctuates tremendously based on

573
00:32:50.989 --> 00:32:53.260
what you're eating and drinking, how old you are.

574
00:32:53.689 --> 00:32:57.140
And also your pelvic floor function, uh, volume as

575
00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:01.540
far as, um, the actual, uh, measurement of, of

576
00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.300
how much, you know, a teaspoon or what have

577
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.380
you, the actual volume of semen. But I would

578
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.729
find, I would say that that may be distressing

579
00:33:08.729 --> 00:33:11.459
anecdotally, as far as what I see in the

580
00:33:11.459 --> 00:33:14.380
office. That may be a distressing component, but what's

581
00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.709
further distressing is the force of ejaculation. So what's

582
00:33:18.709 --> 00:33:20.829
distressing is that if it seeps out or dribbles

583
00:33:20.829 --> 00:33:23.310
out and doesn't like shoot out or have a

584
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:27.349
little force or gumption behind it, That's a little

585
00:33:27.349 --> 00:33:29.869
distress. That's more distressing than the actual volume for

586
00:33:29.869 --> 00:33:32.270
men. I would, again, this is anecdotally in what

587
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.189
I hear as far as in my office working

588
00:33:34.189 --> 00:33:37.040
with men. And we go back to the pelvic

589
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.390
floor muscles, right? Because what are those muscles, little

590
00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.755
pop quiz? What are the muscles that Aid in

591
00:33:42.755 --> 00:33:46.094
ejaculation and expelling fluid out of the penis, these

592
00:33:46.094 --> 00:33:49.964
muscles. So as, you know, a person ages, we

593
00:33:49.964 --> 00:33:52.444
want to make sure that these muscles have great

594
00:33:52.444 --> 00:33:56.104
coordination and also strength to help, you know, move

595
00:33:56.104 --> 00:33:59.444
fluid out of the body. So that, that would

596
00:33:59.444 --> 00:34:02.285
be my two points to your question.

597
00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:06.930
And are there ways of increasing semen volume?

598
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.639
Oh, this is a good question for a nutritionist,

599
00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:13.600
Doctor Jason. Because he actually, he had a, we

600
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.958
had a podcast with him. It's actually on my

601
00:34:15.958 --> 00:34:21.560
YouTube channel, optimizing your erectile function, but briefly fluid

602
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:26.719
intake. Drink water, y'all like fluid intake because semen

603
00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:30.639
is dependent on, like, it's your blood flow, your

604
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.590
body, your cellular makeup is, is fluid, right? It's,

605
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.500
there's water. So drink water, uh, for sure, uh,

606
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.520
and eating your healthy, you know, your leafy greens.

607
00:34:41.608 --> 00:34:44.569
So I, I, without overstepping my boundaries in that

608
00:34:44.569 --> 00:34:48.529
aspect, I would say drink plenty of water, eat

609
00:34:48.529 --> 00:34:50.809
leafy greens, but don't drink too much water where

610
00:34:50.809 --> 00:34:52.888
your pee is clear and you don't know the

611
00:34:52.888 --> 00:34:55.089
distinction between toilet water and your pee water because

612
00:34:55.089 --> 00:34:57.489
you might be then dealing with like urinary urgency

613
00:34:57.489 --> 00:35:01.688
and frequency. So, you know, healthy balance, right? Light

614
00:35:01.688 --> 00:35:03.888
light lemonade color, good.

615
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.310
So let me ask you about another thing that

616
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:13.620
might affect men. What can cause pain during erection

617
00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.020
and ejaculation?

618
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:20.030
Yes. You're hitting all the yummy questions for me

619
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:23.939
today. Love this question. So what can contribute to

620
00:35:23.939 --> 00:35:28.310
erectile pain and ejaculatory pain? Remember these muscles, remember

621
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:31.860
these nerves. Couple of neuroanatomy points here. You have

622
00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:35.550
the pudendal nerve is is a nerve that comes

623
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:40.770
from Several sacral spinal roots, S2, 3, and 4.

624
00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:42.729
So this is the end of the spine. I

625
00:35:42.729 --> 00:35:44.489
like to think about it as S2, 3 and

626
00:35:44.489 --> 00:35:47.199
4 keeps your poop and pee off the floor.

627
00:35:47.649 --> 00:35:52.320
Why? These nerves are what supply and innervate function

628
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:58.760
to these muscles, organs, and genitals. So, there's a

629
00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.959
branch of this nerve, several branches on either side.

630
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.919
So this model doesn't include the yellow or the

631
00:36:03.919 --> 00:36:06.040
nerves, but the model doesn't include all of them.

632
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.120
This is a, think of this as a like

633
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.780
a a spider web here cause there's so many

634
00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:16.830
connections. This nerve will give off perineal nerves and

635
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:19.030
the dorsal nerve of the penis, which I'm gonna

636
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:22.600
show you right here. It's on either side, and

637
00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.949
this nerve branches into several different uh mini branches

638
00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.629
to give off uh to supply the whole shaft,

639
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.560
the urethra, which is the tube. That empties the

640
00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.679
bladder and to the head and the glands of

641
00:36:38.679 --> 00:36:42.060
the penis. But you can see that it's traveling,

642
00:36:42.139 --> 00:36:44.139
you know, it's gonna travel in between all this

643
00:36:44.139 --> 00:36:48.350
tissue and the erectile tissue and exit from right,

644
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.739
this is the pubic synthesis area where your lower

645
00:36:50.739 --> 00:36:52.659
belly, like where that penis attached, you know, kind

646
00:36:52.659 --> 00:36:57.129
of meets the body, it's exiting through there. Now,

647
00:36:57.229 --> 00:37:01.949
during ejaculation or erectile pain, it can be an

648
00:37:01.949 --> 00:37:06.830
issue where these nerves are aggravated. Either there there's

649
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:14.699
just too overstimulation, aggravation, or an injury. Joking, maybe

650
00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:18.219
your audience knows this, maybe not, but joking is

651
00:37:18.219 --> 00:37:21.459
something that I do not suggest men do with

652
00:37:21.459 --> 00:37:24.939
obviously. Do what would you like with your body.

653
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.370
The issues with joking, and let me explain what

654
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:32.020
it is. Joking is a technique that Has been

655
00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.330
said to with an erect penis or partial or

656
00:37:36.489 --> 00:37:40.530
Partial or erect penis, you you squeeze the blood

657
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:43.090
from the base and move it up to the,

658
00:37:43.169 --> 00:37:45.169
to the glands. So you have an erect penis,

659
00:37:45.209 --> 00:37:46.649
a lot of blood flow, a lot of pressure,

660
00:37:46.729 --> 00:37:49.850
and you're adding more pressure and, and moving that

661
00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.560
blood flow into the penis. The idea there is

662
00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.120
that it will quote in air enlarge your penis.

663
00:37:57.129 --> 00:37:59.800
It will not, it will not. What I see

664
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.800
is that it causes more injury, cause these tissues

665
00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.889
in your penis are susceptible to injury, just like

666
00:38:07.889 --> 00:38:10.209
any other part of your body. So if you're

667
00:38:10.209 --> 00:38:12.649
doing something that your body or your tissues are

668
00:38:12.649 --> 00:38:15.080
not able to adapt to because it's too quick,

669
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:19.159
too soon, too hard, You sustain an injury, and

670
00:38:19.159 --> 00:38:21.399
what that injury looks like is either a pelvic

671
00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:28.060
floor muscle strain and or a nerve injury. Nerve

672
00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.570
tissue is like any other tissue in the body.

673
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.229
So they might feel something like a zing, zap,

674
00:38:34.379 --> 00:38:38.219
tingling, like weird sensations. They might actually also not

675
00:38:38.219 --> 00:38:42.020
be able to get an erection as consistently as

676
00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.939
they want. Maybe they'll feel temperature changes. There's all

677
00:38:44.939 --> 00:38:46.469
sorts of things that can happen when there's an

678
00:38:46.469 --> 00:38:50.629
injury here. So, You know, again, all recoverable, all

679
00:38:50.629 --> 00:38:53.429
that to say, all of that is recoverable, especially

680
00:38:53.429 --> 00:38:56.590
pelvic floor therapy is super helpful for this, to

681
00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:58.709
help calm things down and then build back up

682
00:38:58.709 --> 00:39:01.550
tissue tolerance. Again, just like you would if you

683
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.909
broke your foot or you know, sprained a strained

684
00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:07.580
a hamstring or something, you know, we have to

685
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:13.409
address the, the Uh, tissue tolerance, and we have

686
00:39:13.409 --> 00:39:15.889
to also address function and, and so forth and

687
00:39:15.889 --> 00:39:18.169
so on. But it's educating people on what's going

688
00:39:18.169 --> 00:39:21.110
on here that helps to calm that down. So,

689
00:39:21.449 --> 00:39:24.889
that's what I see in my office often is

690
00:39:24.889 --> 00:39:27.889
either a muscle issue, muscle and or nerve issue.

691
00:39:27.929 --> 00:39:31.689
It's never separate because nerves communicate with muscles and

692
00:39:31.689 --> 00:39:35.300
tell them what to do. And I'll also say,

693
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.169
The brain comes into here too, right? Because all

694
00:39:39.169 --> 00:39:41.889
these nerves, all they do is just send messages

695
00:39:41.889 --> 00:39:43.889
up to the spinal cord and then to your

696
00:39:43.889 --> 00:39:46.010
brain, and then your brain makes sense of that

697
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:50.040
information. Like, touch around this area isn't interpreted by

698
00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.370
these nerves here. It's a conscious experience that has

699
00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:57.100
is generated by multiple areas of the brain and,

700
00:39:57.129 --> 00:40:00.570
and consciousness that allows that interpretation of whatever these

701
00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:03.879
sensory messages are. But I'll tell you what, as

702
00:40:03.879 --> 00:40:06.280
soon as something feels weird down here and new

703
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.790
and different, This area is like, your brain is

704
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:12.929
like, whoa, like a Velcro, you know, like, what's

705
00:40:12.929 --> 00:40:14.850
going on here? Is this good? Am I protective

706
00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:18.209
data? And then again, the psychological components can actually

707
00:40:18.209 --> 00:40:22.530
amplify uh pain sensitivity in this area and contribute

708
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:24.489
to a vicious cycle. So we do want to

709
00:40:24.489 --> 00:40:27.350
address in erectile pain and ejaculatory pain, both the

710
00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:33.469
physical aspects, the tissue aspects, you know, uh, Training

711
00:40:33.469 --> 00:40:35.879
the the body to be less protective here and

712
00:40:35.879 --> 00:40:40.040
also training, not training, but helping the brain receive

713
00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.959
messages that you're safe and that you can regain

714
00:40:43.959 --> 00:40:48.679
your body confidence through experiential new learning. Like, oh,

715
00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.639
sex doesn't have to hurt, and we may need

716
00:40:50.639 --> 00:40:53.040
to adjust like masturbation, or we may have to

717
00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.520
adjust like positions for intercourse or What have you.

718
00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.000
Like, that's fine in the beginning, just like you

719
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.030
would adjust your exercise routine, right? You don't keep

720
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:06.439
lifting, deadlifting at the same level. No. You cut

721
00:41:06.439 --> 00:41:08.229
back a little bit, maybe you take a rest,

722
00:41:08.439 --> 00:41:10.840
but we get back to building. And so that's

723
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.679
again, where us pelvic therapists come in to help

724
00:41:13.679 --> 00:41:16.489
with that. Um, BUT that those would be my,

725
00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:18.929
from my perspective and scope of practice as a

726
00:41:18.929 --> 00:41:22.850
physical therapist. Some of the reasons for, uh, erection

727
00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:26.570
or erectile pain, direct injury, again, we, you know,

728
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:33.159
sports, etc. um. Uh, RECREATIONAL activities. It could also,

729
00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:35.969
I will say, another part of this puzzle is

730
00:41:35.969 --> 00:41:38.610
your spine, because many of these nerves, as I

731
00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:42.290
mentioned, are coming from this lower area, but also

732
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:45.030
the lumbar, which is the, the stack of vertebrae

733
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:48.919
that live here. Those also supply the genital area.

734
00:41:49.209 --> 00:41:51.489
So again, we're just kind of ruling out what

735
00:41:51.489 --> 00:41:55.010
are the contributing factors to why there might be

736
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:59.870
a more activity and more messages. Coming from here,

737
00:42:00.199 --> 00:42:02.110
um, and we just calm, we calm shit down

738
00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:04.320
and build shit back up thanks to Greg Lehman

739
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.159
for that one. BUT yeah, that's kind of the

740
00:42:07.159 --> 00:42:07.679
idea there.

741
00:42:08.909 --> 00:42:11.709
So, before we get into the last topic of

742
00:42:11.709 --> 00:42:14.270
our conversation today, which is going to be about

743
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:17.030
pelvic pain, let me just ask you one more

744
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:23.219
question. Can the digestive system also influence sexual performance?

745
00:42:23.389 --> 00:42:24.790
And if so, how?

746
00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:27.550
Oh wow, again, such a great, you're gonna have

747
00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:30.270
to invite Doctor Jason Stevens on here who is

748
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:33.459
a doctor of nutrition. Because he will be able

749
00:42:33.459 --> 00:42:35.979
to answer that a lot better than I can.

750
00:42:36.469 --> 00:42:38.320
There is, I, well, I will say is a

751
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:43.659
broad answer here, yes, 100%. Because of the visceral,

752
00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:48.949
somatic crosstalk or, uh, conversations that can occur, right?

753
00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:51.219
So here's the bowl of the pelvis. You've got

754
00:42:51.219 --> 00:42:54.300
your, your genital organs in here. Let me just

755
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.750
open this up real quick for the audience. Don't

756
00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:02.179
try this at home. We bladder, prostate, and rectum.

757
00:43:02.889 --> 00:43:06.820
The rectum, part of the digestive system, right? So,

758
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:12.469
these muscles here are supporting function, adaptation, pressure demands,

759
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:16.479
etc. There, these muscles aid in Letting poo and

760
00:43:16.479 --> 00:43:18.520
pee out when you want it to, and keeping

761
00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.790
poo and pee in when you want to. If

762
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:24.199
that's not happening, there's a problem, right? It may,

763
00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.810
you know, again, this whole thing about, oh, I'm

764
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:29.830
aging and incontinence or fecal incontinence, like bowel incontinence.

765
00:43:29.959 --> 00:43:33.560
Oh, that's probably nor, no, no, not normal, maybe

766
00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.520
common, but not normal. So anything that's going to

767
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:42.379
disrupt. The Balance in this area is, is potentially

768
00:43:42.379 --> 00:43:45.310
going to create a little bit of, of trouble.

769
00:43:45.659 --> 00:43:47.939
Now, the rectum is connected to the whole bowel

770
00:43:47.939 --> 00:43:50.820
system that sits in your belly, uh, your small

771
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:53.969
intestine, etc. But yes, like having irritable bowel disease,

772
00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:58.629
irritable bowel syndrome, um, Crohn's disease, things like that,

773
00:43:58.979 --> 00:44:02.250
all the nerves that communicate with your guts. Also

774
00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:04.979
have conversations with your pelvic floor and vice versa.

775
00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:08.489
So there is, there is definitely a correlation, not

776
00:44:08.489 --> 00:44:10.899
a causation, right? Not 1 to 1 direct causation,

777
00:44:10.929 --> 00:44:12.560
but we do know from the literature that there

778
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.129
is a correlation between your digestive system and pelvic

779
00:44:16.129 --> 00:44:20.530
floor function. In addition to your gut has a

780
00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.959
huge influence on your immune system, like your gut

781
00:44:22.959 --> 00:44:26.770
microbiome, the bacteria in your gut, etc. All of

782
00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:29.129
that is going to contribute to the balance of

783
00:44:29.129 --> 00:44:31.719
the ecosystem here. Right.

784
00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:37.739
So let's talk then about pelvic pain. First of

785
00:44:37.739 --> 00:44:40.629
all, what is pelvic pain? What causes

786
00:44:40.629 --> 00:44:45.330
it? Yeah, so pelvic pain is the, so it's

787
00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:48.570
pain in the pelvic region. I it's pelvic region,

788
00:44:48.649 --> 00:44:53.040
meaning abdominal, genitals, or anywhere in between your bones

789
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:57.370
or the sacral area that is persisting or lasting

790
00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:59.850
longer than 3 to 6 months without a known

791
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:02.929
cause or pathology. So what does that mean? No

792
00:45:02.929 --> 00:45:08.250
infection, no cancer, no other, no other medical diagnostics

793
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:12.000
are able to Have a reasonable explanation for why

794
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
you're, you're having pain down here, OK? Once that's

795
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.840
all ruled out, and this again is persistent, then

796
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.320
we're dealing with chronic pelvic pain syndrome. That is

797
00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.840
an umbrella term for any type of pain that

798
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.949
you actually might experience down here, to be honest

799
00:45:26.949 --> 00:45:29.959
with you. Erectile pain that we talked about, ejaculatory

800
00:45:29.959 --> 00:45:33.949
pain that we talked about, tailbone pain, butt pain,

801
00:45:34.199 --> 00:45:37.659
uh, pain with intercourse pain. With bowel movements, rectally

802
00:45:37.659 --> 00:45:42.020
or vaginally, uh, pain, scrotal pain could, could, is

803
00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:45.139
falling under that as well. Lower abdominal pain, uh,

804
00:45:45.219 --> 00:45:49.379
feeling fullness in the pelvic area, um, all of

805
00:45:49.379 --> 00:45:54.010
that can fall under chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Also,

806
00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.810
prostate pain. So prostate pain, which has its own

807
00:45:58.199 --> 00:46:02.050
term, it's called prostate pain, provoked prostate pain syndrome.

808
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.080
Um, Again, no known cause or or pathology, so

809
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:11.949
there's no prosthetic infection. A little disclaimer here about

810
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:17.840
Terminology. Historically, the prostate has been blamed for for

811
00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:22.560
pelvic pain in men all like prostatitis. Doctor, you've

812
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:26.199
got prostatitis. Here's the course of antibiotics. You'll be

813
00:46:26.199 --> 00:46:28.439
good to go. All right, cool. Take the course

814
00:46:28.439 --> 00:46:31.320
of antibiotics. I don't have pain, doc. What's going

815
00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:34.280
on? All right, take another course of antibiotics, but

816
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:37.000
there's no known infection, right? And really no one's

817
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.709
really In my experience with men, they're not really

818
00:46:39.709 --> 00:46:41.870
even getting tested for prostate infection. It's just an

819
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:46.159
assumption because it's just It's just the thing that

820
00:46:46.159 --> 00:46:49.919
happens. Anyway, so they're on 2nd course of antibiotics,

821
00:46:49.989 --> 00:46:52.600
3rd course of antibiotics, sometimes 4th course of antibiotics.

822
00:46:52.679 --> 00:46:55.120
It's still not helping. We are missing the boat,

823
00:46:55.159 --> 00:46:58.159
y'all. Like, it is not an infection. 95% to

824
00:46:58.159 --> 00:47:01.199
97% of cases are not related to a prostate

825
00:47:01.199 --> 00:47:06.979
infection. That it needs to be knowledge in the

826
00:47:06.979 --> 00:47:09.379
community. Like, if you had tried a course of

827
00:47:09.379 --> 00:47:12.139
antibiotics once and it didn't work, go see a

828
00:47:12.139 --> 00:47:15.290
pelvic therapist. That's the, that's where we should go,

829
00:47:15.459 --> 00:47:19.500
right? Because the longer that this persists, The better

830
00:47:19.689 --> 00:47:22.879
that these pain systems get at protecting you. It's

831
00:47:22.879 --> 00:47:24.639
like learning to ride a bike or driving a

832
00:47:24.639 --> 00:47:27.550
car. The more you do it on repeat, the

833
00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.000
easier it gets for you to do it, and

834
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.280
you could just do it without thinking, right? It's

835
00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:38.159
very important to educate, retrain, equip the person, help

836
00:47:38.159 --> 00:47:41.560
them feel empowered to do something about it, rather

837
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.800
than going down the rabbit hole of unnecessary medical

838
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.320
tests and exams, which are often very invasive and

839
00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:53.590
uncomfortable. So, It's not prostatitis, but you can have

840
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.229
prostate pain. So that's why I mentioned that because

841
00:47:56.229 --> 00:48:00.629
you can have prostate pain without an infection. And

842
00:48:00.629 --> 00:48:03.149
again, we address that with pelvic therapy. All these

843
00:48:03.149 --> 00:48:06.189
muscles are, are, are connected here and even doing

844
00:48:06.189 --> 00:48:10.810
some prostate manual therapy, right? This prostate gland. Has

845
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:15.090
several, several hundreds, hundreds, little, little tubules, lots of

846
00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:18.520
little pockets of fluid is there. And sometimes, again,

847
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:21.250
uh, maybe it was uh an injury, maybe it

848
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:24.449
was just benign. Sometimes there is an infection, but

849
00:48:24.449 --> 00:48:26.530
then after you take the course of antibiotics and

850
00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:29.449
the infection's gone, you're still in pain, right? Because

851
00:48:29.449 --> 00:48:32.879
the immune system has learned to be very sensitive

852
00:48:32.879 --> 00:48:35.610
and very protective. It's not that there's an infection

853
00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:38.834
still there, it's just that There's pain system hypersensitivity

854
00:48:38.834 --> 00:48:41.635
that's going on, and that includes your nerves and

855
00:48:41.635 --> 00:48:44.034
your immune system. So, you know, again, it's a

856
00:48:44.034 --> 00:48:47.625
whole person approach, how we address uh persistent pain

857
00:48:47.935 --> 00:48:50.594
uh in the pelvis, and it, it, it really

858
00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:53.864
does encompass like a deep understanding and knowledge of

859
00:48:54.195 --> 00:48:57.949
what's going on and how your body works. Resetting

860
00:48:57.949 --> 00:49:01.790
and reconnecting with your body, right? Like brain-body strategies,

861
00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.270
which are super important because they, they then kind

862
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:06.550
of refine the message. You get messages of like,

863
00:49:06.709 --> 00:49:08.469
oh, I can do this, and that doesn't hurt,

864
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.949
and, oh, it's getting better. It's like, oh, OK.

865
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:12.929
It's like when you can see your thumb, you

866
00:49:12.929 --> 00:49:14.830
know, it's like red, you maybe you have a

867
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.790
cut. You're not really worried about it cause you

868
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:18.729
can touch. And feel it, and it's working and

869
00:49:18.729 --> 00:49:21.600
everything's fine, right? But it hurts and it's healing.

870
00:49:21.889 --> 00:49:23.689
It's like the same thing that we're trying to

871
00:49:23.689 --> 00:49:25.409
do here. And then this other thing that we're

872
00:49:25.409 --> 00:49:27.729
trying to do is movement and loading, right? As

873
00:49:27.729 --> 00:49:30.000
part of that process is like, get them back

874
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.570
to doing their activities, which also includes sex, right?

875
00:49:33.699 --> 00:49:35.929
Cause when you have pelvic pain, when there's this

876
00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:40.360
chronic pelvic pain, this headache in your pelvis, You

877
00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.310
don't want to have sexy time? You're like, that's

878
00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:44.709
the last thing. I, I don't want to touch

879
00:49:44.709 --> 00:49:48.699
that thing. Uh uh. No, because why? There's a

880
00:49:48.699 --> 00:49:51.379
lack of understanding of why you hurt. If, if

881
00:49:51.379 --> 00:49:53.179
you think that every time you have sex and

882
00:49:53.179 --> 00:49:55.699
it hurts, or every time you do this particular

883
00:49:55.699 --> 00:49:58.530
activity, you think I'm making it worse. I'm injuring

884
00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:01.659
myself more. I'm having more damage. No, no, no,

885
00:50:01.739 --> 00:50:04.820
no, no, my friends. No. It just means there's

886
00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:08.020
sensitivity there, like a sunburn. You get sunburn on

887
00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.879
your back, you go in the shower, you turn

888
00:50:10.879 --> 00:50:12.719
on the warm, it's warm water, and you're like,

889
00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:16.850
Yeah. You don't think your back is burning more,

890
00:50:16.929 --> 00:50:21.489
do you? No, no. It's sensitive, but it's not

891
00:50:21.489 --> 00:50:24.610
like the sunburn is getting worse. You're not causing

892
00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:27.090
more damage or harm with warm water on your

893
00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:29.649
back. That's what we're dealing with here. And it's

894
00:50:29.649 --> 00:50:34.010
a whole process of reintegrating, reconnecting, loading and moving

895
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:36.610
and getting that person back to function. And the

896
00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:39.689
goals are related to pooping, peeing, sex, and whatever

897
00:50:39.689 --> 00:50:42.090
else activity, work, and otherwise that we want to

898
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:42.770
get back to.

899
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:48.830
Mhm. So in terms of the sexual consequences of

900
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:50.989
pelvic pain, it has to do with the fact

901
00:50:50.989 --> 00:50:55.510
that uh people who have it just avoid having

902
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:57.590
sex because it causes pain, is that

903
00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:01.870
it? Yes, yes, right, cause if something hurts in

904
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:04.179
wherever in your body, right? What do you do?

905
00:51:05.199 --> 00:51:07.340
You're a little apprehensive to do that thing that

906
00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:10.580
makes it hurt, right? And you're like, unless you're

907
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.860
into that. Now, that is, that can be kinky

908
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.250
for someone and there is pain play. Like people

909
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.209
literally love, like, having a little bit of that,

910
00:51:18.649 --> 00:51:21.580
that, that noxious stimulus, like that painful experience, but

911
00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:25.189
that's wanted. That's the difference. This is like an

912
00:51:25.189 --> 00:51:27.590
invasion of your privacy. Like, you're like, what is

913
00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:30.520
going on here? I'm feeling this pain. I do

914
00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.830
not want this. This is not pleasurable. And for

915
00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:34.989
a person who's known their body in this way

916
00:51:34.989 --> 00:51:38.790
that feels pleasurable, right? With themselves or mutually with

917
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:42.830
a partner and now doesn't, that's very destabilizing and

918
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:46.909
disorienting and scary. So when that's happening, guess what?

919
00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:50.860
Erections are going to be difficult, desire and libido.

920
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:55.889
But that's normal in response to a perceived and

921
00:51:55.889 --> 00:51:58.270
or a direct threat, right? Mhm.

922
00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:03.000
Great. So, uh, I mean, I've already mentioned your

923
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.250
YouTube channel in the introduction. Where else can people

924
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.649
find you and your work on the internet?

925
00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:12.330
Yes, so thank you for asking. Shameless plug here.

926
00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:17.959
I have a Patreon, uh site. It's uh patreon.com/doctor

927
00:52:17.959 --> 00:52:20.120
Suzie G D R S U S I E

928
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:24.560
G. AND there we have live model demonstrations and

929
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:29.790
tutorials of scrotal mobilization, uh, techniques for penile pain,

930
00:52:29.959 --> 00:52:32.280
uh, techniques for how to use a pelvic one,

931
00:52:32.479 --> 00:52:34.679
and, and even how I would do a pelvic

932
00:52:34.679 --> 00:52:38.199
exam, right? So to help destigmatize the process of

933
00:52:38.199 --> 00:52:39.879
asking for help for a lot of men, and

934
00:52:39.879 --> 00:52:42.570
when they have a community. And this, let me

935
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:46.979
tell you, this community is so amazing because they're

936
00:52:46.979 --> 00:52:52.179
sharing their experiences, such heartfelt experiences sexually with pain

937
00:52:52.409 --> 00:52:56.330
and building camaraderie. Like, this is a community that

938
00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:58.739
helps elevate the voices of men who are experiencing.

939
00:52:58.854 --> 00:53:01.834
Experiencing pelvic pain and or sexual dysfunction. It is

940
00:53:01.834 --> 00:53:03.875
a beautiful community. I did not think that it

941
00:53:03.875 --> 00:53:06.004
was going to take off the way it did.

942
00:53:06.274 --> 00:53:09.314
And so I am just so honored to hold

943
00:53:09.314 --> 00:53:12.354
this space for people and get to know people

944
00:53:12.354 --> 00:53:15.715
