00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.349
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:05.920
Di Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez,

3
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:09.199
and today I'm joined by Doctor Sean McMicken. He's

4
00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:13.279
Francis Flournoy, Professor of European History and Culture at

5
00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.800
Bard College. And today we're going to talk about

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.600
his book To Overthrow the World, The Rise and

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.360
Fall and Rise of communism. So Doctor Mcin, Mac

8
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.639
Min, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

9
00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:25.760
everyone.

10
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.520
Oh, thank you for having me, Ricardo. It's great

11
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.180
to be here.

12
00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:34.029
So what motivated you to write this book?

13
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:37.090
Well, it's actually easier to answer that question than

14
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.409
it might ordinarily be. Um, I can almost date

15
00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.689
it to a conversation I had several years ago

16
00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:45.569
at the height of the COVID lockdowns with uh

17
00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:48.090
an English historian friend of mine called Nick Lloyd,

18
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.060
he writes a lot on the First World War.

19
00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.930
Um, HE'S doing a trilogy at the moment, Western

20
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.330
Front, Eastern Front both come out and he's gonna

21
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.889
do another history of the Middle Eastern Front. And

22
00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:00.689
we've worked together at times or spoken together at

23
00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:02.900
events over the years, and we were just jawboning

24
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.279
back and forth about. The lockdowns and travel restrictions

25
00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:09.449
and the mask mandates and all these other things,

26
00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:11.980
and how difficult it was to do anything, or

27
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.339
travel or go anywhere or do research or even

28
00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:18.839
see people, and we started musing aloud whether this

29
00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:20.739
might have been what it was like under communism,

30
00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:22.779
and, and he said, why don't you write a

31
00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:24.510
history of communism? And so there it is. So

32
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.449
the, the reason that the broader I suppose cause,

33
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.220
uh, the longer term cause you might say, instead

34
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.790
of the proximate cause of my tackling the subject.

35
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.339
As I've been working on aspects of the history

36
00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:38.819
of communism on and off for many years, where

37
00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.139
I actually kind of began my my career as

38
00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:44.779
a historian, um. Way back in the 1990s, I

39
00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:46.540
grew up against the backdrop of the fall of

40
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.819
the Soviet Union was in the headlines, uh, fall

41
00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.930
of the Berlin Wall, uh, fall of the USSR,

42
00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:55.180
um, so from a very early age, I was

43
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.300
always fascinated by the subject, and it's really where

44
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.379
I first kind of cut my teeth as a

45
00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:01.580
historian doing a lot of research in Moscow in

46
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.250
the old communist archives, which always had an interesting

47
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.260
frisson to me, the uh the secrets, the buried

48
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.660
secrets suddenly laid bare, even if some of those

49
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.369
archives unfortunately are closing up again. And so I've

50
00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:13.929
been working on and off on the subject for

51
00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:15.369
years, and it just kind of struck me. I

52
00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:16.850
mean, why, why not try to do a kind

53
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.009
of a a general summing up of what we

54
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.770
know also because, um, and I think that's really

55
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.419
the angle of the book, the subtitle about the

56
00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.169
rise and fall and and rise of communism is

57
00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.490
that 20 or 30 years ago, I think many

58
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.410
of us in the west had this idea, well,

59
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.050
goodbye to all that, thank goodness that's all finished.

60
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.850
Um, THERE'S even a book by Richard Pipes, a

61
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.809
historian I I admire, but who tried to sum

62
00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.330
up history of communism about 25 years ago by

63
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.259
saying he was writing its obituary, that is, that

64
00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.520
it was dead and buried in behind us, and

65
00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.289
I'm not quite sure that's the case. So I,

66
00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:50.169
I thought the story deserved a new treatment from

67
00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.130
a new perspective, um, not least because a lot

68
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.410
of history has passed since we first thought that

69
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.330
communism was dead and buried.

70
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.570
So we won't have time to go through even

71
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.770
the main and most important events in the history

72
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.399
of communism here, but let's try to at least

73
00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.050
cover some of them. What would you say are

74
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.490
the origins of communism?

75
00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:16.339
Well, one could go back very far and in

76
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.470
in the book I talk about certain antecedents antecedents,

77
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.220
even in the history of Christianity, um. In the

78
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.220
history of Greco-Roman philosophy. Obviously one can go back

79
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.059
as far as one wants to trace the kind

80
00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:29.169
of ideal of equality between men, or at least

81
00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.300
the equality of all souls, the equality of all

82
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.380
believers in the Christian tradition, notions of charity and

83
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.779
the renunciation of material wealth. But I think the

84
00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.570
story really starts to come together in a big

85
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.740
way in the 18th century, some combination of, not

86
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.029
necessarily the mainstream French Enlightenment thinkers, but Uh, Rousseau

87
00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:50.419
was an obvious one that people sometimes talk about,

88
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.990
even though he didn't go quite as far as

89
00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.589
laying out a vision of forcible social equality in

90
00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:59.300
the material sense. He certainly talked in the social

91
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.509
contract about the idea of a radically egalitarian political

92
00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:06.244
community where. All citizens are equal and then effectively

93
00:04:06.244 --> 00:04:08.125
those who are not citizens are put outside the

94
00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:10.285
community and can even be put to death. It

95
00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:12.604
was, it was a lesser known enlightenment thinker called

96
00:04:12.604 --> 00:04:14.625
Etienne Morley, who was writing at the same time

97
00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:16.964
of Rousseau, who actually spelled out much more explicitly.

98
00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:20.165
And his inspiration was, was quite literally Christian. He

99
00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:24.279
thought the greatest. Sin basically was greed or avarice,

100
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.239
and so the only way to produce a kind

101
00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:31.279
of a truly existing Christianity would be to eradicate

102
00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:34.920
all material inequality, to have a radical community of

103
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.309
egalitarianism, with even strict rationing of all material goods.

104
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.440
Um, NOW, a lot of people would say this

105
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.679
is a heresy of what Christianity was meant to

106
00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:46.200
be, but his inspiration clearly was Christian. I mean,

107
00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:49.350
this comes out of the Western Christian eschatological tradition,

108
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.170
almost the idea of a final judgment. Um, THE

109
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.329
story really starts to pick up though with uh

110
00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:58.779
political activist who was inspired by part Rousseau, but

111
00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:01.529
really more morally in his vision of extreme social

112
00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:06.130
equality. Oh, that was Gracus Babeuf, uh, Francois Noel

113
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.179
Babeuf was his original name. He took the name

114
00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:09.890
Gracchus as a kind of nom de guerre during

115
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.820
the French Revolution. Uh, HE was an interesting figure

116
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.450
who as a, as a kind of a law

117
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.089
clerk managing manorial property roles, the old tradition of

118
00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:22.549
Mortmain. The the literal inequality of of the old

119
00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:25.309
French system with the three states and the aristocracy

120
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:28.029
and so forth, with the various obligations peasants had

121
00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.630
to their lords. He knew a lot about the

122
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.829
kind of nitty gritty of inequality and old regime

123
00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:34.790
France and and that part was fair enough. He

124
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.730
wanted reform, but he went much further. Basically, once

125
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.950
They got rid of these laws, he was kind

126
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.350
of out of a job, so he became a

127
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.950
political activist and drawing on his reading of these

128
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.880
radical enlightenment thinkers, he decided in the end that

129
00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:49.390
the revolution hadn't gone far enough. You know, even

130
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.109
the the Roussoian version of of the terror under

131
00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:55.619
Robespierre when People outside the political community were being

132
00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:58.500
put to death, um, as enemies of the people

133
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.540
effectively, that still wasn't far enough. Yeah, they had

134
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.019
to go even further and they had to have

135
00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:05.859
forcible social equality with the confiscation of property. What

136
00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:07.679
was interesting about this, and the reason that it

137
00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:10.179
inspired Marx and Lenin and later revolutionaries was that

138
00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:12.299
he was quite upfront about what it required. He's

139
00:06:12.299 --> 00:06:15.260
not saying like in some airy fairy utopian sense,

140
00:06:15.739 --> 00:06:17.980
we can just wave our magic wands and suddenly

141
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.339
everyone will be equal. No, he said this is

142
00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:24.019
going to require radical cleansing political violence. Uh, LITERAL

143
00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:27.040
explicit talk about putting enemies to death, and those

144
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.709
who resist will be put to death, and they

145
00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:30.549
will be exterminated and all the rest of it,

146
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.079
realizing that to Eradicate inequality, you would literally need

147
00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:39.609
to, of course, rob people, confiscate wealth, nationalize property,

148
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.410
put it all in the hands of some revolutionary

149
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.410
committee. Never really quite got to the details of

150
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.809
what things were supposed to look like afterwards, but

151
00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:49.010
the vision, and and this is the thing I

152
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.690
think some people get wrong. People think that, you

153
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.730
know, communists are all necessarily um idealists in some

154
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.290
sense of like maybe even pacifism or they think

155
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.790
that. You know, they're against violence. No, the violence

156
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.190
is a huge part of both the ideology, but

157
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.390
also, I honestly think of the attraction, you know,

158
00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:05.910
I think that a lot of people are attracted

159
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.109
this precisely because it offers this vision of kind

160
00:07:10.109 --> 00:07:13.630
of radical cleansing political violence. Certainly that appealed to

161
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.750
Marx. You look through all this rhetoric, you know,

162
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.790
he's quite explicit about this. The only the only

163
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.230
chance Marx ever had to sort of say, look,

164
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.640
What might it look like in practice, not necessarily

165
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.760
the final vision of communism, but rather the, the

166
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.190
rupture, the power seizure was the Paris commune of

167
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.200
1871 in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War, and

168
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.640
a lot of people thought, because the communars were

169
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.679
not necessarily strict Marxists or strict communists, they hadn't

170
00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:40.440
necessarily read the communist manifesto, they didn't endorse all

171
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.760
of its kind of bullet point programs, the the

172
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.279
program of the communist manifesto, which was quite explicit

173
00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:49.679
about. Uh, THE eradication of private property, the centralization

174
00:07:49.679 --> 00:07:52.119
of credit in the banks, the nationalization of agriculture,

175
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.970
all the rest of it. Um, THEY weren't, you

176
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.970
know, very good doctrinaire communists, but nonetheless, they had

177
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.070
this radical vision, they wanted to overturn the order

178
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.600
and they put a lot of people to death.

179
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.730
And so some people thought Marx should distance himself

180
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.679
from it quite the opposite. He said, no, absolutely,

181
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.410
you know, this is how you do it, and

182
00:08:07.649 --> 00:08:10.010
even if it's imperfect, you know, you, you kind

183
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.130
of kill a lot of people, you, you create

184
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.010
this radical vision and even if you fail, then

185
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.769
this is an inspiration to others who will get

186
00:08:15.769 --> 00:08:17.820
it. You know, get it right the next time.

187
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.660
That the political violence is really an essential part

188
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.220
of the story, you know, even when Marx even

189
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.420
said like they complained that women and children were

190
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.029
thrown into battle and killed, or they complained that

191
00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:30.859
they ended they executed these innocent bourgeois hostages including

192
00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:33.580
the Archbishop of Paris. They burned down buildings. Marx

193
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.330
said, absolutely, you must do all those things, you

194
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.460
know, arson is fine, executions of class enemies fine,

195
00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:43.020
women and children in battle, mass cleansing violence, it's

196
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.758
all great. Then Lenin takes it even further, you

197
00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:47.518
know, and he's learning kind of on the fly

198
00:08:47.518 --> 00:08:50.119
from Marx in his career and from history, and

199
00:08:50.518 --> 00:08:52.518
so he learns that first of all, the best

200
00:08:52.518 --> 00:08:54.338
chance for revolution is in the course of the

201
00:08:54.338 --> 00:08:57.318
war, Franco-Prussian War, and later on the First World

202
00:08:57.318 --> 00:09:00.439
War, the Russo-Japanese War. So he calls that revolutionary

203
00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:02.359
defeatism. And that part I've I've talked about a

204
00:09:02.359 --> 00:09:03.749
lot of other books. The part that I talked

205
00:09:03.749 --> 00:09:05.749
a little bit more explicitly about in this book

206
00:09:05.749 --> 00:09:09.650
was that Lenin also even spelled out. How he

207
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.320
thought it would happen and what would come next

208
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.919
in this, this, um, relatively little known but important

209
00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:17.890
pamphlet called the Military Program of the proletarian Revolution,

210
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.849
uh, which he wrote in 1916 during the First

211
00:09:19.849 --> 00:09:21.119
World War. A lot of other people are kind

212
00:09:21.119 --> 00:09:24.330
of Recoiling from the violence of the First World

213
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.369
War. Oh, it's awful. Let's end the war. And

214
00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:28.049
Lenin said, no, no, no, this is exactly what

215
00:09:28.049 --> 00:09:30.719
we need. We Turn the imperialist war into a

216
00:09:30.719 --> 00:09:33.400
civil war. You get guns into the hands of

217
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.679
the soldiers, they will then become class warriors. You'll

218
00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:41.559
get this apocalyptic class war, class revolution. They'll turn

219
00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:44.320
their guns against their oppressors, against their officers, you'll

220
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.669
have mass mutinies and civil war, and mass violence.

221
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.599
And then once the communists are in power in

222
00:09:49.599 --> 00:09:52.070
one country, they'll be in a state of opposition

223
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.080
to all the non-communist countries. And so then you'll

224
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.760
get wars between the communist countries and the non-communist

225
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.030
countries, and basically this whole kind of Endless series

226
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.440
of of spiraling violence and war, and he wasn't

227
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.799
saying I hope this doesn't happen. He was saying,

228
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.840
I hope it does happen. That's exactly what he

229
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.840
wanted to happen. And he even cited Marx on

230
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.640
this business about, well, yes, we will need to

231
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.640
throw women and children into battle. And so even

232
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.130
like what you what you would see later with

233
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.640
the Red Guards in China and that sort of

234
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.919
thing, you know, children being thrown into battle, it's

235
00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:22.799
all right there already in Marx and Lenin.

236
00:10:24.289 --> 00:10:27.450
Right. So, uh let's then talk a little bit

237
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.969
about the first rise of communism that you refer

238
00:10:31.969 --> 00:10:34.890
to in the subtitle of your book. So what

239
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.729
led first to the Russian revolution? How did it

240
00:10:39.729 --> 00:10:40.280
happen?

241
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.369
Well, a lot of it had to do, of

242
00:10:42.369 --> 00:10:44.770
course, with Lenin and his particular vision that I've

243
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.299
already talked about, but he would not have been

244
00:10:46.299 --> 00:10:50.270
able to achieve any of this without A fortunate

245
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.390
series of circumstances breaking his way. I mean, what,

246
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.549
what did make Lenin effective, you know, were two

247
00:10:54.549 --> 00:10:56.390
things. One, again, is he saw the war as

248
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.619
an opportunity. I mean, they, they had this interesting

249
00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:01.869
debate in what was called the Second International before

250
00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:03.640
the First World War. This is the Second Working

251
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.059
Men's International Association. Marx had founded the first in

252
00:11:07.059 --> 00:11:10.549
1864. The second was founded in Paris in 1889.

253
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.090
And the great tragedy, at least from the perspective

254
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.489
of kind of more sympathetic historians of of the

255
00:11:16.489 --> 00:11:19.659
left or socialists or communists was always that, you

256
00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:21.729
know, they got it wrong, they had some good

257
00:11:21.729 --> 00:11:23.450
ideas, but they didn't carry them through. What what

258
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.330
they tried to do, and they talked about the

259
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.609
idea of a Massen strike or a general strike

260
00:11:27.609 --> 00:11:30.760
was that once there might be a war between

261
00:11:30.909 --> 00:11:34.289
the so-called capitalist powers or the imperialist powers that

262
00:11:34.609 --> 00:11:36.419
You know, the workers, the ones who were kind

263
00:11:36.419 --> 00:11:39.780
of mining the coal and building the weapons and

264
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.419
forging the metal, you know, they could all stop

265
00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:44.450
working, and this would kind of prevent the war.

266
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.830
And you know, Lenin kind of bandied around the

267
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.229
idea along with some others, but in the end

268
00:11:50.229 --> 00:11:51.909
he actually thought there was a better idea, which

269
00:11:51.909 --> 00:11:53.549
is basically, you know, look, if the war is

270
00:11:53.549 --> 00:11:55.549
gonna happen, it's gonna happen, so you take advantage

271
00:11:55.549 --> 00:11:57.469
of it, you seize the moment. So this is

272
00:11:57.469 --> 00:11:59.510
this revolution of defeatism I was talking about, but

273
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.989
basically spreading mass mutinies. There's a slogan turning the

274
00:12:01.989 --> 00:12:04.039
imperialist war into a civil war. So first of

275
00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:06.020
all, the First World War has to happen for

276
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.619
this even to become possible or practicable. There had

277
00:12:08.619 --> 00:12:10.099
been a little bit of a dry run in

278
00:12:10.099 --> 00:12:14.099
Russia in 194, 195 during the Russo-Japanese War, and

279
00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:16.489
Lenin had realized in the course of that war,

280
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.820
he didn't play much of a role in the

281
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.219
revolution. He was mostly in exile in those years

282
00:12:20.219 --> 00:12:21.700
and kind of came back to Russia at the

283
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.700
last minute and didn't really do even as much

284
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.739
as Trotsky and a few others, but He was

285
00:12:25.739 --> 00:12:27.690
very good at reading the events, which was that

286
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.169
Russia lost the war. Japan very clearly defeated Russia,

287
00:12:32.299 --> 00:12:35.770
sneak attack on Port Arthur in the Pacific, um,

288
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.340
followed by a series of land battles, the siege,

289
00:12:38.349 --> 00:12:40.820
and this great naval battle at Tsushima, Russia was

290
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.020
absolutely humiliated in that war, uh, particularly because it

291
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.780
was a kind of non-European power, and this is

292
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.099
the age when the Europeans really thought that they

293
00:12:48.099 --> 00:12:52.330
were still. Uh, SUPERIOR, whether in racial, cultural civilizational

294
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.580
sense to non-European people. So it's a huge wake-up

295
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.979
call, a huge embarrassment, and humiliation of the Russian

296
00:12:56.979 --> 00:13:01.289
government. And it nearly got toppled in a revolution

297
00:13:01.289 --> 00:13:03.450
in 195. You know, the Tsar had to back

298
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:08.010
down, made concessions, so-called October manifesto, he allows for

299
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.929
the first time a real parliament called the Duma

300
00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:12.330
in Russia, the various concessions. Basically, the point being,

301
00:13:12.809 --> 00:13:14.849
Russia back down. It didn't go quite far enough

302
00:13:14.849 --> 00:13:17.659
from Lenin's perspective, but the fact was that losing

303
00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:20.719
a war is what made it possible. Now, during

304
00:13:20.719 --> 00:13:22.349
the First World War, and Lenin is mostly in

305
00:13:22.349 --> 00:13:25.340
exile in Switzerland under effectively the protection of the

306
00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.270
central powers who saw him as a potential useful.

307
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.900
ALLY was the Austrians, not the German, the Austrians

308
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.070
first sent him to Switzerland, the Germans who later

309
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.989
sent him to uh Russia, those being the central

310
00:13:36.989 --> 00:13:40.250
powers at war with the so-called ntente, Britain, France,

311
00:13:40.349 --> 00:13:43.539
and Russia. So because Lenin was this kind of

312
00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:45.710
sworn enemy of the tsar and of the Russian

313
00:13:45.809 --> 00:13:48.390
Tsarist regime, he was seen as useful by the

314
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.500
central powers. Lenin for his own part. Both used

315
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.969
this as an opportunity, but then he also theorized,

316
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.020
and he was quite explicit about it, that what

317
00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.859
he wanted to do was to bring about the

318
00:13:59.859 --> 00:14:02.820
defeat of his own country, and he even used

319
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.369
one's own country and kind of inverted quote marks.

320
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.739
That is, he's an anti-patriot, you know, he wants

321
00:14:08.739 --> 00:14:11.989
his country to lose the war because that way.

322
00:14:12.549 --> 00:14:16.469
The government will be humiliated, weakened, its prestige, cratered,

323
00:14:16.479 --> 00:14:18.679
etc. So then you can strike and you can

324
00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:20.799
overthrow the government. And he proceeds to do this

325
00:14:20.799 --> 00:14:23.710
quite literally in 1917. Again, initially he's in exile.

326
00:14:24.119 --> 00:14:26.880
The Tsar is toppled in this revolution, the so-called

327
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.000
February revolution. The Tsar abdicates it's a complicated story

328
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.710
and Lenin has very little to do with it.

329
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.239
A lot of this had to do with kind

330
00:14:34.239 --> 00:14:36.719
of internal Russian politics and obviously there was a

331
00:14:36.719 --> 00:14:38.679
lot of dissatisfaction. There were a lot of also

332
00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:41.349
opportunists. The thing about the Federal revolution, I think

333
00:14:41.349 --> 00:14:43.109
a lot of people get wrong, is they think

334
00:14:43.109 --> 00:14:46.299
it was this kind of upwelling of anti-war sentiment.

335
00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:48.940
It was almost the opposite. In fact, most of

336
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.340
the dissatisfaction with the Tsar, particularly in Russian high

337
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.549
society and in kind of the rumor mongering and

338
00:14:54.549 --> 00:14:57.469
so on, that was making people paranoid and riling

339
00:14:57.469 --> 00:15:00.369
them up, was the idea that in fact the

340
00:15:00.369 --> 00:15:03.669
Tsarist regime was kind of honeycombed with pro-German traitors,

341
00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:05.789
you know, that's what the whole Rasputin affair was

342
00:15:05.789 --> 00:15:07.909
about, that Rasputin was seen as a kind of

343
00:15:07.909 --> 00:15:10.940
a A pro-German traitor, and that's why he had

344
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.820
to be killed, and he literally was killed by

345
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.979
a member of the Tsar's own family and a

346
00:15:14.979 --> 00:15:19.739
high born Russian aristocrat uh called Felix Yusupov. They

347
00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:21.500
were doing it because they wanted to get the

348
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.580
pro-German black bloc click out of the way. You

349
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.429
know, they wanted to to prosecute the war. In

350
00:15:25.429 --> 00:15:28.530
fact, even, even the key generals at headquarters, Stavka,

351
00:15:28.539 --> 00:15:30.619
who in the end sort of They didn't green

352
00:15:30.619 --> 00:15:33.659
light the revolution exactly, but they convinced the czar

353
00:15:33.659 --> 00:15:36.059
to abdicate because they believed that it would help

354
00:15:36.059 --> 00:15:38.059
Russia win the war. And long story short, the

355
00:15:38.059 --> 00:15:41.299
February revolution is not anti-war. It's, there's a lot

356
00:15:41.299 --> 00:15:43.299
of misunderstanding, but basically a lot of the key

357
00:15:43.299 --> 00:15:45.479
figures are actually pro-war. They want to continue the

358
00:15:45.479 --> 00:15:49.140
war. Even Karensky who emerges as the kind of

359
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.669
radical but not quite. Communist figure, he comes from

360
00:15:52.669 --> 00:15:54.909
this party called the Socialist Revolutionary Party. They were

361
00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:57.460
not Marxists, they were more of a peasant-based party,

362
00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.989
was actually pro-war. He wanted to kind of prosecute

363
00:15:59.989 --> 00:16:02.840
the war. But it becomes increasingly difficult over the

364
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.150
course of the spring and the summer. And some

365
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.469
of this is just war weariness, which is natural

366
00:16:07.469 --> 00:16:09.150
after the First World War had been burning for

367
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.489
3 years. But what happens is that Lenin. IS

368
00:16:12.489 --> 00:16:14.340
allowed to return to Russia. He's sent there by

369
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.380
the Germans who want to undermine the Russian war

370
00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.979
effort. Now Lenin, of course, is using the Germans

371
00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:20.580
in the same way they're using him. They kind

372
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.619
of line up on this question. The Germans want

373
00:16:22.619 --> 00:16:24.859
Russia to lose the war, Lenin wants Russia to

374
00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:27.260
lose the war. And so Lenin works to help

375
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.330
Russia lose the war. Uh, HE has German money,

376
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.900
this allows him to buy up a printing press,

377
00:16:32.979 --> 00:16:35.179
cash on the barrelhead, and then they start flooding

378
00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:37.580
the armies first just the the rear guard units

379
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.900
in in Petrograd, Petersburg, later Leningrad, the capital, then.

380
00:16:42.549 --> 00:16:46.049
And then the units nearby, the Baltic Fleet, eventually

381
00:16:46.049 --> 00:16:48.599
by about summer, they finally reached kind of the

382
00:16:48.599 --> 00:16:52.159
frontline armies right as Kerensky is ordering this offensive

383
00:16:52.159 --> 00:16:54.520
in Galicia and kind of the contested area between

384
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.669
Austria-Hungary, and Russia. And so you get this almost

385
00:16:57.669 --> 00:17:00.190
bonfire of the mutinies where there's a mutiny back

386
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.559
in Petrograd that we refer to as the July

387
00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:05.880
days. There are mutinies near the front, all of

388
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.160
it fueled by communist propaganda. Again, Lenin is literally

389
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.150
promoting mutinies. That's pretty much the program. That's what

390
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.760
the story of what would later be the October

391
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.839
Revolution is about. It's kind of like this gigantic

392
00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.550
mutiny. You know, even the Red Guards who later

393
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.300
are the kind of muscle that helped Lenin. Uh,

394
00:17:23.479 --> 00:17:25.118
ACHIEVE power first in the capital and then in

395
00:17:25.118 --> 00:17:28.199
other cities. Nearly all of them are either disaffected

396
00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:30.329
soldiers or they're deserters, or some of them are

397
00:17:30.329 --> 00:17:34.579
even active duty members of the Tsarist Imperial Army,

398
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.959
the former Tsarist Imperial Army now fighting for the

399
00:17:36.959 --> 00:17:40.900
so-called provisional government or uh the Imperial Navy, uh,

400
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.760
which is mostly in the Baltic, which is quite

401
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.640
critical in the story because it's so close to

402
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.800
Petrograd, particularly there's a base nearby in Cocklin Island,

403
00:17:47.839 --> 00:17:51.790
crunch that's a base in Helsinki. Uh, SO these

404
00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.270
mutinies are actively promoted by Lenin the Bolsheviks. So

405
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.030
in, in, in, in the initial sense, that's sort

406
00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.500
of what the communist program, at least for seizing

407
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.390
power is. And Lenin is quite explicit about this.

408
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.339
He's reading Clausewitz, he's obsessed with kind of military

409
00:18:05.339 --> 00:18:07.270
affairs, and it's all about force, like how many

410
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.520
men do we have on their arms, how many

411
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.739
men do they have on ours. Stalin would later

412
00:18:11.219 --> 00:18:13.699
Uh, turned this almost into an aphorism when he

413
00:18:13.699 --> 00:18:16.530
was once asked about, uh, the Pope, the Vatican,

414
00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.780
and he said something like, well, yeah, how many

415
00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.180
divisions does the Pope have? In other words, it's

416
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.819
like literally you're, you're getting arms in the hands

417
00:18:22.819 --> 00:18:25.180
of these kind of impressionable violent young men and

418
00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.739
making sure you have more men under arms than

419
00:18:26.739 --> 00:18:28.500
the enemy. And that's in the end what they

420
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.660
did. Karesky plays a lot of things wrong. There's

421
00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.660
a thing called the Korneoff affair where he crosses

422
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.859
swords with basically the commander in chief of the

423
00:18:35.859 --> 00:18:39.260
armies, incredibly stupid, forfeited the support of the officer

424
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.349
corps. He weakened critically any support his regime had

425
00:18:43.349 --> 00:18:44.959
in the army. So then in the end, most

426
00:18:44.959 --> 00:18:46.839
of the army sort of almost just, they were

427
00:18:46.839 --> 00:18:48.920
neutral. They kind of played dead during what would

428
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.560
be called the October Revolution. The Bolsheviks seized power

429
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.400
and then, you know, it was not as violent

430
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.160
as it might have been in Petrograd because there

431
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.089
they had already so thoroughly propagandized the rear guard

432
00:18:59.089 --> 00:19:01.160
units. In Moscow and a few other cities, they

433
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.680
actually had to fight their way into power, and

434
00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.599
there's, you know, they're literally like shelling the Kremlin.

435
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.859
It's a very violent power seizure across Russia, uh,

436
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.369
which then Dovetails with this kind of gigantic demobilization

437
00:19:12.369 --> 00:19:14.689
of the army. Basically it's like a mutiny, um,

438
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.739
but what they wanted, this is also part of

439
00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:18.500
Lenin's program is he wanted the army to be

440
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.780
demobilized, but he wanted the soldiers to leave with

441
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.900
their arms so that they could then, you know,

442
00:19:22.939 --> 00:19:24.819
be enrolled in either the Red Guards or the

443
00:19:24.819 --> 00:19:26.800
Red Army. In the end they had to kind

444
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.869
of make a few compromises. They had to bring

445
00:19:28.869 --> 00:19:30.920
back a few of the old officers because they

446
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.510
realized they didn't know how to run an army,

447
00:19:32.959 --> 00:19:35.390
and eventually they even brought back the death penalty,

448
00:19:35.439 --> 00:19:38.040
which initially they had opposed when the soldiers were

449
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.160
loyal to the old regime. Um, SO it's really

450
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.439
a story about kind of uh mutiny, propaganda, you

451
00:19:45.439 --> 00:19:46.760
know, the army, but in the end, you know,

452
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.319
what they needed to do is to get arms

453
00:19:48.319 --> 00:19:50.119
into the hands of impressionable young men, and that

454
00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:51.790
was only possible because of the war.

455
00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:57.339
And later, how did it, how did communism go

456
00:19:57.339 --> 00:20:00.619
international? How did it go, how did it spread

457
00:20:00.619 --> 00:20:04.530
from Russia to China and other countries?

458
00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:07.420
Well, some of the ideas are spread through, of

459
00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.619
course, propaganda through communist parties which were funded by

460
00:20:10.619 --> 00:20:12.939
Moscow. Again, some of the ideas were already out

461
00:20:12.939 --> 00:20:15.500
there, but the kind of the particular vision that

462
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.300
the commenter on the communist International wanted to impose

463
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.939
on parties, the so-called party line. That was devised

464
00:20:21.939 --> 00:20:24.339
in Moscow, and then that was buttressed and supported

465
00:20:24.339 --> 00:20:28.219
by agents, emissaries, funds, you know, the common turn

466
00:20:28.219 --> 00:20:30.859
had a central kind of treasury. Oddly enough, the

467
00:20:30.859 --> 00:20:33.180
currency that they kept accounts in was the US

468
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.819
dollar, ironically, um, the official language was actually German.

469
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.390
Um, BUT the whole thing was run out of

470
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.030
Moscow. And so, you know, they, they tell these

471
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.310
communist parties all over the world, they're totally funded

472
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.390
by Moscow. They, they had, they have these rules,

473
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.709
they're called the 21 conditions for membership. They spell

474
00:20:48.709 --> 00:20:50.469
this all out. The parties are supposed to have

475
00:20:50.469 --> 00:20:52.739
these kind of shadow governments ready to seize power.

476
00:20:52.949 --> 00:20:55.459
Now in practice, it didn't usually happen that way.

477
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.229
I mean, a lot of the propaganda and a

478
00:20:57.229 --> 00:20:59.270
lot of the funds were probably wasted because in

479
00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.829
the end. Although communists at times would make inroads

480
00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:04.699
in a few countries, like they had a few

481
00:21:04.699 --> 00:21:06.670
successes in Germany, but then things kind of went

482
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.349
backwards. At times in France and Italy, they were

483
00:21:09.349 --> 00:21:12.349
quite popular, although they never quite sniff power. Then

484
00:21:12.349 --> 00:21:14.390
in the 30s, they were popular front governments where

485
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:17.790
the communists were kind of again, close to, but

486
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.430
not really quite having power. No, in the end

487
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.589
it required war just like it had for Lenin.

488
00:21:22.829 --> 00:21:26.099
So you had a few episodes, um. Right after

489
00:21:26.099 --> 00:21:28.219
the First World War in places like Hungary and

490
00:21:28.219 --> 00:21:31.459
Germany, countries like Russia had lost the war, and

491
00:21:31.459 --> 00:21:33.680
so, you know, they had this kind of copycat

492
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.540
Soviet style communist revolutions, but they didn't last very

493
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.099
long because again, they just basically they hadn't gotten

494
00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:41.020
enough men under arms, and, you know, they were

495
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.099
defeated. It's very, very clear, you know, they were

496
00:21:43.099 --> 00:21:46.660
just, they were defeated by arms. Um. Spain, you

497
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.500
know, the Soviets were able to take over the

498
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.359
so-called Pop Popular Front government there for a couple

499
00:21:51.359 --> 00:21:54.339
of years from 36 to early 39, but they

500
00:21:54.339 --> 00:21:56.880
lose that war too. Again, they succeeded for a

501
00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.500
time, it was longer, maybe longer lived than the

502
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.589
revolutions in Hungary and Munich, but in the end,

503
00:22:03.619 --> 00:22:05.699
it didn't last long enough. It really is only

504
00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:08.459
after the Second World War that both there's enough

505
00:22:08.459 --> 00:22:11.619
violence, there's enough chaos, there's enough destruction of the

506
00:22:11.619 --> 00:22:13.459
social order, and most of all, and this is

507
00:22:13.459 --> 00:22:18.290
the key bit. Enough impressionable, angry young men are

508
00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.619
under arms who were able to start toppling governments.

509
00:22:20.699 --> 00:22:22.599
And so it comes out of civil wars in

510
00:22:22.599 --> 00:22:24.859
the same way in Russia, they turned the imperialist

511
00:22:24.859 --> 00:22:27.979
war into a civil war, in Yugoslavia, out of

512
00:22:27.979 --> 00:22:30.780
the Second World War, becomes a civil war. In

513
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.579
China, the war with Japan becomes a civil war.

514
00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:36.219
And then nearly all these cases, even if there

515
00:22:36.219 --> 00:22:40.140
were these kind of so-called native communist leaders, people

516
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.290
like uh Josip Bros, code named Tito in Yugoslavia,

517
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.180
or of course Mao Zedong in China, the two

518
00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.699
most famous so-called kind of self-made, it's usually seen

519
00:22:50.699 --> 00:22:52.619
like, oh well, no, they actually achieved power on

520
00:22:52.619 --> 00:22:55.119
their own without Russian help. It's a total lie

521
00:22:55.119 --> 00:22:59.199
in both cases. Broz Tito was taking instructions from

522
00:22:59.199 --> 00:23:01.910
Moscow all along. He was a very loyal communist.

523
00:23:02.119 --> 00:23:03.839
He oddly enough, got a lot of armed support

524
00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:05.560
during the war before the Soviets were able to

525
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.520
start supplying him from Britain, and this is part

526
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.380
of the story that It's a little bit delicate

527
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.569
to talk about because so many people admire Winston

528
00:23:12.569 --> 00:23:15.530
Churchill, but he really kind of got played uh

529
00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:19.050
basically by some agents inside the British government and

530
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.089
the BBC and believing that the person Britain should

531
00:23:22.089 --> 00:23:24.130
have been supporting that basically that the army fighting

532
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.560
on behalf of the Yugoslav exiled government in London,

533
00:23:26.569 --> 00:23:29.130
the Royal Yugoslav exiled government in London that Britain

534
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:32.449
was hosting and supporting, Mikhailovich and the so-called Chetniks,

535
00:23:32.479 --> 00:23:34.930
he abandons them, he throws his support to Tito.

536
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.229
Uh, UNBEKNOWNST to Churchill the whole time, Tito was

537
00:23:38.229 --> 00:23:42.150
actually sending these reports back about Churchill's envoy, a

538
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.020
man named Fitzroy McLean. He's fully loyal to Stalin.

539
00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:47.989
In fact, even the so-called Tito-Salin split that emerges

540
00:23:47.989 --> 00:23:49.869
after the Second World War is not because Tito

541
00:23:49.869 --> 00:23:52.790
was not a communist, rather it is because he

542
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.829
was in some ways more communist than Stalin. For

543
00:23:54.829 --> 00:23:58.109
example, Tito wanted to spread communism to Greece, whereas

544
00:23:58.109 --> 00:24:01.680
Stalin was at least willing to Except Churchill's deal,

545
00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:04.520
the kind of percentages agreement that Greece was in

546
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.869
Britain's sphere of influence, so he wouldn't bother there.

547
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.680
Tito in some ways was actually more of a

548
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.839
revolutionary communist than, you know, Stalin at least tactically

549
00:24:11.839 --> 00:24:13.949
when it came to various countries around Europe. Now,

550
00:24:13.959 --> 00:24:16.719
Mao, it's true, was was ornery and eventually he

551
00:24:16.719 --> 00:24:18.760
would break in a more serious way, probably because

552
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.760
he had no larger population, more resources. Uh, HE

553
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.079
would eventually break with the Soviets in the late

554
00:24:25.079 --> 00:24:28.589
1950s, but when he came to power, He was

555
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.489
absolutely loyal to the Soviet Union. They had been

556
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.829
funding him all the way back since 1921. Um,

557
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.479
YOU know, the Long March, so called Long March,

558
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.170
all the elements in the Mao legend, if you

559
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.310
actually look at the evidence, you know, he's very

560
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:44.469
much under instructions from Moscow. Even the reason Mao

561
00:24:44.469 --> 00:24:47.119
is able to survive uh the the war with

562
00:24:47.119 --> 00:24:50.560
Japan, the Sino-Japanese War, which we can roughly date

563
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.910
from 1937 to 1945, even if Japan had already

564
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:59.290
occupied Manchuria back in 1931. Mao's forces did not

565
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.069
fight Japan because Stalin brokered a deal for him

566
00:25:02.069 --> 00:25:04.689
with Japan. And so, again, it was a perfect

567
00:25:04.689 --> 00:25:07.010
kind of setup for Mao, Japan and then the

568
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.849
Chinese nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek could kind of

569
00:25:09.849 --> 00:25:12.729
destroy each other, and then he could turn this

570
00:25:12.729 --> 00:25:15.290
war into again a civil war, of course, against

571
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:19.530
Chiang Kai-shek's forces once Japan withdrew. And he had

572
00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.979
financial support and arms from the Soviet Union all

573
00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:24.140
along. In fact, what was a little bit odd

574
00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.260
about the Chinese Civil War from the kind of

575
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:30.420
broader geopolitical perspective is that it coincided with the

576
00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.500
onset of the Cold War in Europe when the

577
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.420
so-called Truman Doctrine is when the US agrees it

578
00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.449
will start supporting, you know, as they put it,

579
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.500
free peoples, maybe a little bit of humbug, but

580
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.939
the idea is they're supporting governments that are trying

581
00:25:41.939 --> 00:25:45.589
to struggle against communist. Subversion and so forth, so

582
00:25:45.589 --> 00:25:47.260
they support Greece and Turkey in the initial case,

583
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.869
and then of course eventually they bankroll and support

584
00:25:49.869 --> 00:25:52.869
the NATO alliance and all the rest. While the

585
00:25:52.869 --> 00:25:55.540
US is making these kind of commitments to stop

586
00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.719
the spread of communism in Europe. The US is

587
00:25:58.719 --> 00:26:01.579
abandoning Chiang Kai-shek in China. They actually cut him

588
00:26:01.579 --> 00:26:04.439
off of all arms and all funds, whereas the

589
00:26:04.439 --> 00:26:07.719
Soviets were not just sharing and funding Mao, but

590
00:26:07.719 --> 00:26:09.829
they were kind of stepping things up. They had

591
00:26:09.829 --> 00:26:13.319
established contact in Manchuria. They even gave Mao a

592
00:26:13.319 --> 00:26:14.709
lot of the arms that they took from the

593
00:26:14.719 --> 00:26:17.959
the kind of uh retreating Japanese armies after the

594
00:26:17.959 --> 00:26:20.640
war. Um, AND so Mao is now fighting this

595
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.119
one-sided proxy war where he, he's getting everything he

596
00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:25.229
needs from the Soviets. So, you know, again, it's

597
00:26:25.229 --> 00:26:29.189
sure, Mao had his own. Peculiar fanaticism that obviously

598
00:26:29.189 --> 00:26:31.150
allowed him to kind of inspire people in China,

599
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.780
but it's still part of this broader story where,

600
00:26:34.089 --> 00:26:35.729
you know, you have the Soviet Union, which is

601
00:26:35.729 --> 00:26:37.920
kind of arming its client states, and then that's,

602
00:26:38.079 --> 00:26:39.760
you know, largely what the rest of the Cold

603
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.040
War is about. You have these odd sort of

604
00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.640
anomalies in a place like Cuba where Fidel Castro

605
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.920
might not have been an orthodox communist, and in

606
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.599
fact even Officially, this is a little odd people

607
00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:52.280
might be surprised to learn, officially in the Cold

608
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.319
War, Cuba was non-aligned. Uh, THEORETICALLY, Cuba was not

609
00:26:56.319 --> 00:26:58.439
an aligned country, but of course, in practice, he

610
00:26:58.439 --> 00:27:01.199
was a Soviet client and the Soviets were sending

611
00:27:01.199 --> 00:27:04.160
him advisors, aid, missiles, money, etc. I mean, by

612
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.869
the by the late 1980s, the Soviets are actually

613
00:27:07.239 --> 00:27:09.000
uh propping up his government to the tune of

614
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.199
almost $5 billion a year, which is a huge

615
00:27:11.199 --> 00:27:13.239
amount of money in the 1980s and the communist

616
00:27:13.239 --> 00:27:15.489
bloc. And that's part of the reason why Cuba's

617
00:27:15.489 --> 00:27:18.040
economy collapsed after the fall of the Soviet Union,

618
00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:19.930
because they, you know, they lost their subsidies. So,

619
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.719
you know, Soviet funding and arming was hugely important,

620
00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.609
um, and that's really mostly how communism spread, you

621
00:27:26.609 --> 00:27:31.369
know, along with opportunities presented by these civil wars,

622
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.530
you know, unfortunately, whenever there was civil war mayhem

623
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.439
or, you know, growing out of a World War,

624
00:27:36.849 --> 00:27:41.599
uh, violence, death, destruction. This helped augur well for

625
00:27:41.599 --> 00:27:45.229
the fortunes of communism, um, because that's basically how

626
00:27:45.229 --> 00:27:46.439
communism spreads.

627
00:27:47.979 --> 00:27:50.760
So let me ask you now then about the

628
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.640
fall of communism. Why and how did so many

629
00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:01.859
communist regimes fall between 1989 and 1991? Well,

630
00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.800
it's a great question, and, and to be, to

631
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.640
be honest, we don't have the full story yet,

632
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.839
like we have a lot more than we did

633
00:28:06.839 --> 00:28:08.989
20 or 30 years ago. But obviously there are

634
00:28:08.989 --> 00:28:11.069
a lot of files we still don't have access

635
00:28:11.069 --> 00:28:14.579
to. Um, THE role of Mikhail Gorbachev is huge,

636
00:28:14.739 --> 00:28:16.750
this is the last, of course, general secretary and

637
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:19.150
then later president, kind of a self-styled president of

638
00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:23.089
the Soviet Union. Uh, WHO later on became a

639
00:28:23.089 --> 00:28:26.949
figure almost of, of Sympathy in the West, I

640
00:28:26.949 --> 00:28:29.489
think in part because the Cold War seemed to

641
00:28:29.489 --> 00:28:32.510
end without at least a great power conflagration, even

642
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.869
if there was a lot of kind of small

643
00:28:33.869 --> 00:28:38.030
as seemingly harmless figure hawking Pizza Hut and other

644
00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.709
kind of western because he needed the money. The

645
00:28:40.709 --> 00:28:42.300
thing people forget about Gorbachev is when he first

646
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.030
came to power in 1985, uh, the Cold War

647
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:47.670
was actually a very kind of tense moment, and

648
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:50.219
he was absolutely not installed in power in order

649
00:28:50.219 --> 00:28:52.000
to preside over the demise of the Soviet Union.

650
00:28:52.109 --> 00:28:54.770
It was not his goal. In fact, The goal

651
00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.900
they even had a new 5 year plan. It

652
00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.819
was the so-called 12th 5 year plan. Ucarea, this

653
00:29:00.819 --> 00:29:03.020
is the kind of the uh the catchword which

654
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.969
is acceleration. Um, IN the US, uh, the Reagan

655
00:29:06.969 --> 00:29:11.239
administration. And of course, been basically spending a lot

656
00:29:11.239 --> 00:29:13.650
more both on the conventional military and talking about

657
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.800
this thing called strategic defense initiative or missile defense,

658
00:29:16.849 --> 00:29:18.119
which would put a lot of pressure on the

659
00:29:18.119 --> 00:29:22.530
Soviets strategically. The US had been backing initially mostly

660
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:25.069
through Pakistan. But then a little bit more and

661
00:29:25.069 --> 00:29:29.140
more directly in the 1980s, uh, the Afghan resistance,

662
00:29:29.319 --> 00:29:33.930
mujahideen, various factions fighting against the Soviet puppet communist

663
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.390
government of Afghanistan, which had been installed and then

664
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:38.359
propped up by a kind of Soviet armed coup

665
00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:41.270
in 1979. Uh, THE Soviets had gotten sucked into

666
00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:45.290
Afghanistan and We're kind of being bled there increasingly

667
00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:49.079
by this US armed resistance that had things like

668
00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:51.199
stinger missiles that they could use to to shoot

669
00:29:51.199 --> 00:29:53.729
down Soviet helicopter gunships. Uh, SO things are very

670
00:29:53.729 --> 00:29:55.250
tense, you know, there had been a few moments

671
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:59.969
in 1982, 1983, so Abel Archer, uh, kind of

672
00:29:59.969 --> 00:30:01.890
episode when, you know, there had almost been a

673
00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.130
scare of kind of nuclear war. There was a

674
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:06.329
whole nuclear freeze movement in Europe, so things were

675
00:30:06.329 --> 00:30:08.770
very tense, and Gorbachev did not come to power

676
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:12.469
to preside over surrendering the Cold War. What happened

677
00:30:12.469 --> 00:30:15.430
instead was a massive Soviet arms buildup to counter

678
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.229
Reagan's arms buildup. And in a lot of conventional

679
00:30:18.229 --> 00:30:21.150
categories, another thing I don't think people realize about

680
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:24.229
the Gorbachev era and the Peter strike or reconstruction

681
00:30:24.229 --> 00:30:26.709
that he talked about, is that the Soviets were

682
00:30:26.709 --> 00:30:29.829
actually succeeding in terms of hardware. They're actually outproducing

683
00:30:29.829 --> 00:30:32.729
the West, outproducing the US. In a lot of

684
00:30:32.729 --> 00:30:39.130
categories, um, self-propelled artillery, tanks, even nuclear submarines, um,

685
00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:42.569
yes, missiles. They were actually outproducing the US in

686
00:30:42.569 --> 00:30:46.050
terms of hardware. The problem for the Soviet economy

687
00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:50.599
was that, uh, basically they were being bankrupted by

688
00:30:50.689 --> 00:30:53.359
uh the effort by this 12 5 year plan.

689
00:30:53.569 --> 00:30:55.650
And yes, the consumer economy, and everyone knows this

690
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:57.869
part was was sort of rubbish, it was failing,

691
00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:59.180
you know, they they were failing to keep up

692
00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.609
an IT computers, the consumer sector was perishingly weak,

693
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:06.130
all that was true. But the main problem wasn't

694
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.530
necessarily that let's say Soviets didn't have enough kind

695
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.810
of soap and toilet paper, even though that was

696
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:14.949
probably true. The main problem was that the government

697
00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.569
was increasingly becoming bankrupt. There's also a lot of

698
00:31:17.569 --> 00:31:20.020
financial pressure being put by the Reagan administration. One

699
00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.709
of the various ways in which they did this.

700
00:31:22.709 --> 00:31:25.699
Uh, WAS by basically putting a lot of pressure

701
00:31:25.699 --> 00:31:28.469
on the energy sector because the Soviets required, they

702
00:31:28.469 --> 00:31:30.719
relied so much on energy exports. And so the

703
00:31:30.719 --> 00:31:33.510
Reagan administration leaned on Saudi Arabia, they ramped up

704
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.550
production, oil prices cratered, this kind of hit the

705
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.300
Soviet bottom line. So by about 1989, you know,

706
00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.015
again the the sort of The happier part of

707
00:31:40.015 --> 00:31:42.535
the story is, oh, well, eventually you see in

708
00:31:42.755 --> 00:31:45.555
Eastern Europe, you get the opening of the border

709
00:31:45.555 --> 00:31:47.755
between Hungary and Austria, you get the emergence of

710
00:31:47.755 --> 00:31:49.675
solidarity in Poland, you get the fall of the

711
00:31:49.675 --> 00:31:52.515
Berlin Wall, that the happiest supposedly story is the

712
00:31:52.515 --> 00:31:55.729
so-called Velvet Revolution in Prague. And you know, all

713
00:31:55.729 --> 00:31:58.369
that was fine, but the backdrop of all this,

714
00:31:58.439 --> 00:32:00.790
the reason the satellites were able to eventually to

715
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:04.170
spend free was because the Soviets were increasingly bankrupt

716
00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.329
and they were desperate for Western loans. It gets

717
00:32:06.329 --> 00:32:09.270
to a point in 1990 where Gorbachev is actually

718
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.055
begging for Dollars at these summits with, uh, US

719
00:32:12.055 --> 00:32:14.775
President George Bush, the first Bush, uh, George Herbert

720
00:32:14.775 --> 00:32:17.895
Walker Bush, literally begging for dollars. I mean, it's

721
00:32:17.895 --> 00:32:21.214
almost kind of embarrassing to read the transcripts of

722
00:32:21.214 --> 00:32:23.905
just how desperate Gorbachev was. You know, he wanted

723
00:32:23.905 --> 00:32:27.854
the US to give him $50 billion or $100

724
00:32:27.854 --> 00:32:31.214
billion basically, just so that he could afford to

725
00:32:31.214 --> 00:32:33.334
prop up what was left of the Soviet security

726
00:32:33.334 --> 00:32:36.979
establishment. Um, BECAUSE, yes, there were some kind of

727
00:32:36.979 --> 00:32:39.699
uh centrifugal forces, there were movements in the Caucasus

728
00:32:39.699 --> 00:32:41.949
and Central Asia, more importantly in the Baltic states

729
00:32:41.949 --> 00:32:44.780
where these kind of national movements had emerged, and

730
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.859
they simply couldn't afford at all, they couldn't afford

731
00:32:46.859 --> 00:32:48.859
the Afghan war, but also holding on to the

732
00:32:48.859 --> 00:32:51.099
Baltics and here and there, and also spending for

733
00:32:51.099 --> 00:32:53.099
the arms buildup. It was a kind of a

734
00:32:53.099 --> 00:32:56.219
triage, and meanwhile, at some point a lot of

735
00:32:56.219 --> 00:32:58.540
Soviet insiders must have realized which way the wind

736
00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.750
was blowing and so. They started laundering funds, and

737
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:04.280
we know a lot of kind of KGB people

738
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.520
who had access to funds. It really is quite

739
00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.479
an amazing story, and again we, by no means

740
00:33:08.479 --> 00:33:09.920
could we understand the full extent of it. We

741
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.390
know for example that like the Soviet gold reserves

742
00:33:12.719 --> 00:33:15.390
vanished, you know, they just disappear. We know that,

743
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.439
you know, vast amounts of kind of the cash

744
00:33:17.439 --> 00:33:19.560
holdings of the Soviet central bank, they all disappear

745
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.060
in just the course of several years and Now

746
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:22.859
part of the story, a lot of people in

747
00:33:22.859 --> 00:33:24.290
the rest of the world were familiar with, oh,

748
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.290
suddenly you have all these Russian oligarchs showing up

749
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:27.819
like with their yachts and all the rest of

750
00:33:27.819 --> 00:33:29.439
it like, where did they come from? Well, sure,

751
00:33:29.459 --> 00:33:31.219
some of them were business people who maybe had

752
00:33:31.219 --> 00:33:34.579
export or import licenses or they exported oil, or

753
00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:36.739
they imported some product and sold it. A lot

754
00:33:36.739 --> 00:33:38.584
of them. We're just kind of cashing in on

755
00:33:38.584 --> 00:33:41.114
the old connections. They were like rats fleeing a

756
00:33:41.114 --> 00:33:43.805
sinking ship. You know, now maybe Gorbachev could have

757
00:33:43.805 --> 00:33:47.224
held it together. Maybe better leadership might have allowed

758
00:33:47.224 --> 00:33:48.505
them to endure. There, there are a lot of

759
00:33:48.505 --> 00:33:50.824
people who've investigated this and said that Gorbachev made

760
00:33:50.824 --> 00:33:53.905
humongous mistakes. And one of the mistakes he actually

761
00:33:53.905 --> 00:33:55.175
made, and I talk about this in the book,

762
00:33:55.204 --> 00:33:57.369
is that It's a bit like what happens in

763
00:33:57.369 --> 00:34:01.130
1917 in Russia when I talked about Kerensky losing

764
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.599
the support of the officers with the so-called Kornilov

765
00:34:03.599 --> 00:34:07.209
affair. Uh, DURING some of the episodes in which

766
00:34:07.209 --> 00:34:10.370
the Soviet security forces and in some cases actually

767
00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.610
literally the army is cracking down on dissent and

768
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:17.250
protests, places like Almaty and places like Tbilisi and

769
00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:20.610
places like Riga and places like Vilnius. They were

770
00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:22.840
doing this, and they were basically succeeding. I mean,

771
00:34:22.918 --> 00:34:24.800
that, you know, this is a fearsome apparatus we're

772
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.958
talking about, but Gorbachev. Actually kind of held some

773
00:34:29.958 --> 00:34:31.438
of the generals to account. He called them out

774
00:34:31.438 --> 00:34:33.398
by name in public, and he embarrassed them, and

775
00:34:33.398 --> 00:34:36.438
he accused them of basically killing people, even though

776
00:34:36.438 --> 00:34:37.638
he was the one who gave the orders. I

777
00:34:37.638 --> 00:34:39.599
mean, it was all he wanted to be loved

778
00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:41.998
and liked you could some of this you need

779
00:34:41.998 --> 00:34:43.918
to read Machiavelli, I think, to understand in the

780
00:34:43.918 --> 00:34:45.518
end, of course, he ended up being neither loved

781
00:34:45.518 --> 00:34:48.079
nor feared, and so he lost the support of

782
00:34:48.079 --> 00:34:50.248
the officers. So what happens in the '91 coup,

783
00:34:50.319 --> 00:34:52.998
which is a complicated story, but part of what

784
00:34:52.998 --> 00:34:55.659
happens is that Again, whether it was Gorbachev for

785
00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:57.979
the men he appointed, Gorbachev's role is still a

786
00:34:57.979 --> 00:35:00.320
little bit murky in the story of this of

787
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.659
this thwarted coup, and Yeltsin famously stands in the

788
00:35:02.659 --> 00:35:06.979
tank and talks about this anti-democratic right-wing anti-constitutional coup

789
00:35:06.979 --> 00:35:09.580
d'etat. Right wing being ironic because of course it

790
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.219
was a kind of the communists trying to go

791
00:35:12.219 --> 00:35:16.520
back to power. Well, In the in the army

792
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.199
mutiny, so it was yet again a story of

793
00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:20.239
mutiny. Um, YOU know, I think a lot of

794
00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:23.120
the world can be very fortunate that the Soviet

795
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.600
army, particularly with its vast nuclear arsenal, didn't go

796
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.719
down fighting in this way and that Yeltsin was

797
00:35:27.719 --> 00:35:30.070
able to secure the nuclear arsenal most of it

798
00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:31.840
anyway, and secure the codes and so on and

799
00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.600
so forth, and Yeltsin turned out to be very

800
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.600
kind of pro-West. Of course, a lot of Russians

801
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.320
today think he was on the Western payroll or

802
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:42.179
something, but Gorbachev basically kind of misplayed everything. Um,

803
00:35:42.189 --> 00:35:44.790
AND again, it seemed like a very salutary ending

804
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:45.750
to a lot of people in the West at

805
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:47.510
the time, and obviously it was great for the

806
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:49.669
peoples of Eastern Europe that were allowed to spin

807
00:35:49.669 --> 00:35:51.830
free. I mean, a lot of that was negotiated

808
00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:54.629
too. The Soviets negotiated in exchange for withdrawing troops

809
00:35:54.629 --> 00:35:57.149
from East Germany and other countries, they got a

810
00:35:57.149 --> 00:35:59.669
little bit of financial compensation, probably not as much

811
00:35:59.669 --> 00:36:02.649
as others people I think Gorbachev would have liked,

812
00:36:02.709 --> 00:36:05.189
but it's kind of almost like bribery. The Soviets

813
00:36:05.189 --> 00:36:10.620
withdrew, um. And so in that sense, communism vanished

814
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.300
simply because the sword is lifted both in the

815
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.219
satellite countries and then in Russia. Of course, the

816
00:36:15.219 --> 00:36:17.439
opposite happens in China, Tiananmen Square, and that's another

817
00:36:17.439 --> 00:36:21.330
story, but there. The communist regime under a lot

818
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:24.129
of pressure with mass protests building with the cameras

819
00:36:24.129 --> 00:36:28.330
rolling, decides, well, you know what, unlike Gorbachev, I'm

820
00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.010
fine with not being loved, and this is kind

821
00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:31.879
of Deng Xiaoping and a couple of his top

822
00:36:31.879 --> 00:36:33.889
advisers, and they decide, no, it's fine, we will

823
00:36:33.889 --> 00:36:36.409
shed blood, and we will, you know, we will

824
00:36:36.409 --> 00:36:39.629
fire on the protesters. um. And that in the

825
00:36:39.629 --> 00:36:41.699
end was what Gorbachev, I suppose, just didn't have

826
00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:43.669
the stomach to do. And so a lot of

827
00:36:43.669 --> 00:36:45.830
people could be fortunate for this, although obviously in

828
00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.000
the ensuing chaos, um, you know, a lot of

829
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.949
other people suffered.

830
00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.100
OK, so, uh, I'm getting a little bit mindful

831
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.939
of your time. So let me just combine two

832
00:36:55.939 --> 00:37:00.100
questions here to wrap up our conversation. What is

833
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.219
then the second rise of communism that you refer

834
00:37:03.219 --> 00:37:06.469
to in the book? How has it played out

835
00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.739
and how popular would you say is communism nowadays?

836
00:37:11.379 --> 00:37:13.679
Well, it's a good question. Um, I mean there

837
00:37:13.689 --> 00:37:15.909
there's several different levels I think we're talking about

838
00:37:15.909 --> 00:37:18.669
here. Maybe you could talk several different stories that

839
00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:20.719
are interrelated, but they're not all exactly the same.

840
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.550
I mean, so in, in the most literal sense,

841
00:37:22.629 --> 00:37:24.469
you have in Russia the endurance of the Communist

842
00:37:24.469 --> 00:37:29.070
Party, unlike let's say in 1945, when with Hitler's

843
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:31.709
death, death, Nazism just kind of disappears from the

844
00:37:31.709 --> 00:37:34.070
world, even if people are always talking about neo-Nazism

845
00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:35.909
or Nazi that, you know, there there's no such

846
00:37:35.909 --> 00:37:37.510
thing, you know, the party doesn't exist, you know,

847
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.500
there's no real kind of cause, there's no real

848
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.199
organization. The Communist Party endured in Russia. In fact,

849
00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.479
there was a trial in 1992, and at the

850
00:37:45.479 --> 00:37:46.870
time it was covered a little bit like, oh,

851
00:37:46.879 --> 00:37:49.479
here's a Nuremberg for communism. And you know, there

852
00:37:49.479 --> 00:37:52.120
were these truth and reconciliation commissions in countries like

853
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.479
East Germany where they were actually reckoning with the

854
00:37:54.479 --> 00:37:56.479
Stasi, the secret police, and what they had done,

855
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.600
and people could go and investigate the files and

856
00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.159
all this. People were hoping the same thing would

857
00:38:00.159 --> 00:38:03.320
happen in Russia, this reckoning. Um, YOU know, people

858
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.629
would be reminded or exposed for the first time

859
00:38:06.629 --> 00:38:09.000
to all the crimes committed in the Stalin era

860
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.929
or Brezhnev or under Lenin. And there's a little

861
00:38:11.929 --> 00:38:13.570
bit of that and and and even in the

862
00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:15.850
trial, there was some discussion of some of the

863
00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:17.409
crimes of the Communist Party. The part of the

864
00:38:17.409 --> 00:38:20.489
story I think we missed, maybe we misunderstood at

865
00:38:20.489 --> 00:38:24.560
the time, or maybe we misremembered later, is that

866
00:38:24.929 --> 00:38:28.610
the trial was actually caused by a lawsuit filed

867
00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:31.810
by the Communist Party, which sued Boris Yeltsin's government

868
00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:35.439
for outlawing it, and the communists won the trial.

869
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.570
That is the was trying to ban them on

870
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.449
the grounds they weren't really a political party, but

871
00:38:39.449 --> 00:38:41.689
this kind of criminal structure of fusing with state

872
00:38:41.689 --> 00:38:44.969
organs, which in a way is right, they kind

873
00:38:44.969 --> 00:38:47.459
of are a little bit of both. The communists

874
00:38:47.459 --> 00:38:50.020
won the case. And this isn't totally surprising because

875
00:38:50.379 --> 00:38:52.659
uh most of those who were sitting in judgment

876
00:38:52.659 --> 00:38:55.360
were themselves communists, even Yeltsin himself was a lifelong

877
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.379
communist. I mean, nearly everyone in the in the

878
00:38:57.379 --> 00:39:00.739
Russian political establishment, including Putin, of course, they're all

879
00:39:00.739 --> 00:39:02.219
communists. I mean, that's kind of what you would

880
00:39:02.219 --> 00:39:04.139
expect. They grew out of the communist system and

881
00:39:04.139 --> 00:39:06.659
so even if they may no longer have wanted

882
00:39:06.659 --> 00:39:09.860
the government to practice the same policies of the

883
00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.580
Soviet Union. They didn't really want a full reckoning

884
00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.100
either. And so the, the opening of the archives

885
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.780
for a little while in the early 90s, kind

886
00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.860
of slowed down and in recent years it's gone

887
00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.699
into reverse. You know, even with some such things

888
00:39:21.699 --> 00:39:25.580
as like the Captain Forest massacre of 1940, which

889
00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.659
during the Cold War, the Soviets always insisted was

890
00:39:27.659 --> 00:39:29.860
a Nazi crime. They finally owned up to this

891
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.409
in 1990. Putin even issued a kind of groveling,

892
00:39:33.459 --> 00:39:36.020
but not really totally sincere apology for it in

893
00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.939
2009 to Poland. Now again, they're asserting that it

894
00:39:39.939 --> 00:39:41.780
either didn't happen or it wasn't us, you know,

895
00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.060
like there's been a, a reversion, there's been kind

896
00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.459
of backsliding. Um, NOW the broader story, I suppose

897
00:39:47.459 --> 00:39:50.100
China is the most obvious refutation of the idea

898
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:52.899
that communism perished or communism died, the CCP is

899
00:39:52.899 --> 00:39:55.939
still in power in China, through their policies, some

900
00:39:55.939 --> 00:39:58.300
people might say, well, you have private property in

901
00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.459
China and you have these vast fortunes and you

902
00:40:00.459 --> 00:40:03.199
have these people who seem like entrepreneurs. Well, yeah,

903
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.639
sure, there there are certain, you might say violations

904
00:40:06.639 --> 00:40:10.080
of some precise dictionary definition of communism requiring the

905
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.350
full state ownership of all the means of production.

906
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.679
But this was always true of of all communist

907
00:40:14.679 --> 00:40:17.239
regimes. It was true the height of Stalinism was

908
00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:20.620
true the height of Maoism. The communists have never

909
00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.179
fully succeeded in eradicating all of private property because

910
00:40:23.179 --> 00:40:25.780
that's basically impossible. You're always going to have some

911
00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.659
type of a black market. People will always have

912
00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:31.580
some private property that the state cannot confiscate might

913
00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:33.969
try to do so and aspires to do so.

914
00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.139
And even at the height of, let's say the

915
00:40:36.139 --> 00:40:39.540
five-year plans under Stalin, the Soviets were still employing

916
00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.620
and contracting with a lot of Western firms to

917
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:43.379
do business in Russia. A lot of the blast

918
00:40:43.379 --> 00:40:46.620
factories were designed by American capitalist firms and so

919
00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.090
on. And so that level of kind of almost

920
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:55.800
Uh, collaboration or Tolerance of Western capitalist firms doing

921
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.639
business in communist China and then communist versions of

922
00:40:58.639 --> 00:41:01.120
these firms. Now that's always kind of been the

923
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.120
case. The difference is still that the state in

924
00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.600
China still has the final say on everything. The

925
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.889
state can basically decide, no, you know, that's not

926
00:41:08.889 --> 00:41:10.600
a lot. We're gonna confiscate your property or we're

927
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.840
gonna put you in jail. Uh, THE state still

928
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.030
has the final word and the state still controls,

929
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.360
and this is maybe to me kind of the

930
00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:20.969
real essence of it. Yes, communist regimes always aspired

931
00:41:20.969 --> 00:41:24.139
to abolish private property. They aspired to enroll all

932
00:41:24.139 --> 00:41:26.979
economic activity into the hands of the state. They

933
00:41:26.979 --> 00:41:30.899
never fully succeeded. Where they did succeed, the statist

934
00:41:30.899 --> 00:41:33.939
aspect was in terms of communication and surveillance, you

935
00:41:33.939 --> 00:41:35.820
know, that is nothing outside the state. It's kind

936
00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.620
of a more extreme version of how Mussolini actually

937
00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:42.020
define defined fascism that. The state controls all and

938
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.780
so the state surveils, the state controls your movements,

939
00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.419
what you're allowed to say, you know, you have

940
00:41:46.419 --> 00:41:49.620
kind of censorship communication and that's what you obviously

941
00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.780
have in China's social credit system, you know the

942
00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.820
state can determine whether or not you're going to

943
00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.179
succeed in life, you know, get into schools, get

944
00:41:57.179 --> 00:42:00.379
jobs. If you run afoul of the state, they

945
00:42:00.379 --> 00:42:04.459
can either arrest you, uh, send you into these

946
00:42:04.459 --> 00:42:08.500
kind of forced labor camps or prisons. Expel you,

947
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:10.310
of course, in extreme cases kill you, and that's

948
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:13.199
still true in China. No, no other political parties

949
00:42:13.199 --> 00:42:15.159
are allowed, that's obviously kind of also part of

950
00:42:15.159 --> 00:42:18.000
the essence of communism, um, and you still have

951
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.110
other communist countries today too, Laos, Cambodia, North Korea,

952
00:42:22.479 --> 00:42:24.330
again, to some extent, Cuba, it's a little bit

953
00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:27.100
debatable even to some extent Cambodia, but in all

954
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.679
of these countries, political opposition parties are not allowed.

955
00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.719
You have a totalitarian single party state. Now, do

956
00:42:32.719 --> 00:42:35.189
we have that in the West? No, not exactly.

957
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.520
What we have instead are elements that I think

958
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.959
should concern us. Um, YOU know, we learned a

959
00:42:39.959 --> 00:42:42.600
lot in the last 5 years in particular, in

960
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.610
the COVID era, but not just the COVID era,

961
00:42:45.239 --> 00:42:50.159
about, uh, social credit systems, social media censorship, governments

962
00:42:50.159 --> 00:42:53.260
increasingly almost working hand in glove with private firms

963
00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.129
to monitor our communications. Some of this is our

964
00:42:55.129 --> 00:42:57.879
own fault, of course, for uploading our private data

965
00:42:57.879 --> 00:43:00.659
on the social media accounts. But I mean, in,

966
00:43:00.719 --> 00:43:04.510
in some ways, you might say. That the dictators,

967
00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.320
uh, in the kind of classic Cold War of

968
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.679
communism, whether in the Soviet Union or China or

969
00:43:08.679 --> 00:43:11.360
the Eastern European satellites, you know, they could have

970
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.919
only dreamed of having the tools at their disposal

971
00:43:13.919 --> 00:43:17.679
that modern states do, uh, to track the movement.

972
00:43:18.709 --> 00:43:21.050
PEOPLE, you know, through these little devices we carry

973
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:23.899
around in our pockets, um, with all of the

974
00:43:23.909 --> 00:43:27.510
CCTV's monitoring our movements, with even people uploading pictures

975
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:29.709
and videos of themselves, so that the states can

976
00:43:29.709 --> 00:43:32.620
actually basically keep track of us at all times.

977
00:43:32.909 --> 00:43:34.629
I think had the Soviets had those tools at

978
00:43:34.629 --> 00:43:37.270
their disposal, they may not have gone bankrupt trying

979
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.510
to spy on and oppress their citizens. I mean

980
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:41.310
we can, I suppose we can, we can be

981
00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:44.850
fortunate that That the Soviets under Brezhnev and then

982
00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:48.050
drop off and and Chernenko and Gorbachev didn't have

983
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:50.850
those tools available. Uh, IF they did, I think

984
00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:52.449
the Soviets would still be in power today. So

985
00:43:52.449 --> 00:43:53.729
I think we have, we have to watch it.

986
00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:56.560
We have to be very careful. We have to

987
00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:00.409
protect our freedoms vigorously, um, and we have to

988
00:44:00.409 --> 00:44:04.270
obviously watch out for this idea that There's only

989
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.260
one right way of thinking, you know, there's only

990
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.580
one legitimate political party that anyone who opposes the

991
00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.860
consensus on some hot button topic should be ostracized

992
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.969
and canceled. I mean, all of these things are

993
00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.500
are things that we've seen in a lot of

994
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:20.500
Western countries over the past few years. I mean,

995
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.179
a famous examples of people being arrested for social

996
00:44:23.179 --> 00:44:27.530
media posts. Um, OR social media accounts being shut

997
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.260
down, you know, these might be softer versions, but

998
00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.620
they all have echoes, I think, in communist history,

999
00:44:32.629 --> 00:44:36.260
whether of Mao's great proletarian cultural revolution or the

1000
00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.379
social credit system under the Soviets, and I think

1001
00:44:39.379 --> 00:44:41.340
we all need to be on our guard, uh,

1002
00:44:41.379 --> 00:44:42.580
to protect our freedoms.

1003
00:44:43.929 --> 00:44:46.679
Great. So the book is again to overthrow the

1004
00:44:46.679 --> 00:44:49.419
world, the rise and fall and rise of communism.

1005
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.219
Of course, I'm leaving a link to it in

1006
00:44:51.219 --> 00:44:54.590
the description of the interview. And Doctor Mc Mickin,

1007
00:44:54.699 --> 00:44:57.139
just before we go, would you like to tell

1008
00:44:57.139 --> 00:44:59.479
people where they can find you and your work

1009
00:44:59.479 --> 00:45:00.459
on the internet?

1010
00:45:01.449 --> 00:45:04.449
Well, my books are all available through reputable booksellers,

1011
00:45:04.699 --> 00:45:06.939
including Amazon, although, of course, most of us would

1012
00:45:06.939 --> 00:45:08.780
probably prefer that you buy them directly from the

1013
00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.889
publisher, which is Basic Books in the case of

1014
00:45:10.899 --> 00:45:12.780
of this book and many of my other books.

1015
00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.370
So basic books, you can go to their website.

1016
00:45:15.939 --> 00:45:19.300
Um, I don't really maintain an active social media

1017
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.060
account. I'm a little bit wary of the same

1018
00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:25.449
type of government, uh, surveillance, but my literary agent

1019
00:45:25.449 --> 00:45:28.889
