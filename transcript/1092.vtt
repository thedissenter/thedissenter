00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:03.259
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.219
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:08.979
today I'm joined by Doctor Mats Larsson. He is

4
00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:12.210
a postdoc and researcher at the University of Oslo,

5
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.939
and today we're going to talk about his book

6
00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.379
Stories of Love from Vikings to Tinder, The Evolution

7
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:23.389
of Modern Mating Ideologies, dating Dysfunction, and demographic collapse.

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.139
So, Mats, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure

9
00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:26.790
to everyone.

10
00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:28.819
Thank you so much, Richard. I'm very happy to

11
00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:29.459
be here with you.

12
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.470
So tell us first, what is the premise of

13
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.259
the book exactly? Why did you decide to write

14
00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:38.909
it? What is it really about? I mean, what

15
00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:41.619
kinds of topics do you explore there?

16
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.470
Yeah, well, the modern world is now heading towards

17
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.319
self eradication. Our fertility rates have fallen so low,

18
00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:49.389
uh, and if we're unable to turn that around,

19
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.150
we will simply disappear. So I was wondering, how

20
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.950
did we get to where we are, uh, what

21
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.720
happened with human mating, uh, that has now put

22
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.979
us in a position where we simply aren't willing

23
00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.900
to reproduce anymore. So I, I draw this, uh,

24
00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.860
â‚¬6 million canvas to investigate, uh, hominid mating, and

25
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.900
then I have an emphasis on the cultural evolution

26
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.629
of the past 800 years of, of Western mating,

27
00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:14.260
but from a perspective of Scandinavia. Uh, THAT is

28
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.940
the region from where I, uh, pick my literary

29
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.250
case studies to uh study uh different mating regimes,

30
00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.339
uh, that we've submitted to over the past 800

31
00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:22.650
years.

32
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.300
And in the book you talk about what you

33
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.000
call uh mating moralities or ideologies of love. What

34
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.620
is that?

35
00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:36.430
Well, we humans, in order to understand the world

36
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.029
and um know how to act and think, we

37
00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:43.870
submit to different ideologies, uh, political ideologies, cultural ideologies,

38
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.510
and, and what I'm focusing on m ideologies. These

39
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.150
are uh philosophies of love or or uh certain

40
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.779
ideologies to tell us how we should think about

41
00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:57.370
love, sex, pair bonding, reproduction. How we should court

42
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.010
each other, how we should live together. Uh, AND,

43
00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:02.919
and this is, this, it sounds not so important

44
00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:05.489
for modern minds, mating, it just sounds like a

45
00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:07.449
little side gig that we may or may not

46
00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:10.589
participate in. But make no mistake, mating is the

47
00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:14.509
is the foundation of every society unless a human

48
00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.389
community or any other animal community are unable to

49
00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.819
get their mating to work, that society will disappear.

50
00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.548
That is uh an iron law of evolution. It's

51
00:02:24.548 --> 00:02:26.309
not voluntary if we want to exist in the

52
00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.738
future.

53
00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:32.610
And evolutionarily speaking, what do we know about human

54
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.410
mating systems? Is it possible for us to tell

55
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.250
if we have one dominant mating system like monogamy,

56
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.210
polygamy, polyamory, serial monogamy? I mean, what can we

57
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.050
tell about that?

58
00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:49.949
Yeah, our flexibility is quite a strength. We can

59
00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:52.500
do uh quite a lot. We're very versatile species.

60
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.110
Our original mating system was the most common mating

61
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.820
system for all vertebrates, which is promiscuous mating. Uh,

62
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.509
IT means that males, um, generally it means that

63
00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.580
males compete with each other to establish a hierarchy,

64
00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.789
so that females know uh whom to pick for

65
00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.270
mating, which are the men at the top of

66
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.710
that hierarchy because that is an effective way for

67
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.949
distributing, uh, genes that are most functional in the

68
00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:18.539
environment throughout the population. Uh, BUT then it, it,

69
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.070
for the species that are able to transition into

70
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.550
pair bonding to develop a second attraction system. So

71
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.229
instead of just having a promiscuous attraction system, you

72
00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.389
develop a, a pair bonding attraction system. It can

73
00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.190
be very beneficial to have the males of a

74
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.149
species instead of engaging in a lot of sexual

75
00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:35.830
competition, start investing in their, in their family and

76
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.179
offspring. So around 4 million years ago, our lineage

77
00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:42.550
developed this capacity for what we moderns call love

78
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.225
and uh. This motivated, uh, males and females to,

79
00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:50.514
uh, stick together after sex, uh, help the woman

80
00:03:50.514 --> 00:03:52.595
through the pregnancy, and then take care of the

81
00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:55.744
offspring through its most vulnerable face. So our, um,

82
00:03:55.755 --> 00:03:58.714
our ancestors had our for ancestors had a mating

83
00:03:58.714 --> 00:04:02.074
cycle of about 3 to 4 years. So, um,

84
00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:06.050
you could say that the human mating system. IS

85
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.610
defined by having two attraction systems, promiscuous and pair

86
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.850
bonding, and uh the norm for our lineage 2

87
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.369
million years ago became monogamy, but our nature draws

88
00:04:16.369 --> 00:04:20.019
us to serial pair bonding, interspersed with opportunistic short

89
00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.769
term mating, which means we pair bond monogamously or

90
00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:27.049
poly polygynously, and then we also sleep around a

91
00:04:27.049 --> 00:04:27.850
little bit on the side.

92
00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.730
And what is romantic love? And is romantic love

93
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.540
the result of evolution? And if so, when and

94
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.489
how did it evolve?

95
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.940
Yeah, so, so in my book, uh, romantic love

96
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.700
has two meanings. Uh, THE one that is most

97
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.420
common in other contexts is just to think about

98
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.230
those emotions we have that motivate pair bonding. So

99
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.799
romantic love evolved 4 million years ago and it

100
00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:53.320
has two functions. Uh, THE first one is that

101
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.600
it motivates women to have sex also with low

102
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.720
value men instead of just the men heist in

103
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.959
hierarchy, and that it motivates the man and the

104
00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:03.309
woman to cooperate through the child's most vulnerable face.

105
00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:05.720
In the book I refer to also to romantic

106
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.279
love, uh, the cultural ideology, the ideology of love

107
00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:11.559
that was dominant in the West from the early

108
00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:15.809
1800s until the 1960s. And this was an ideology

109
00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:19.200
that said that men and women are half humans,

110
00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:21.890
uh, and then we're supposed to meet our better

111
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.769
half and forge through a peer bond supported by

112
00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:29.369
very strong lifelong love. Uh, I love that it

113
00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:30.720
is so strong that we don't want to have

114
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.959
sex or be with anyone else, and then we

115
00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:36.640
should live in the breadwinner housewife model. So, men

116
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.000
and women were conceived to be equal, but to

117
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.279
have different roles, which in practice meant, uh, that

118
00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.880
the man was socially and judicially higher than the

119
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.079
woman. And this is how we made it through

120
00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:49.760
the 1800s and until the West third sexual revolution

121
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.890
around 1968.

122
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.089
So before we move on to talking about the

123
00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:57.899
different kinds of love you explored in the book

124
00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.329
through literary analysis primarily, I would like to ask

125
00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:04.829
you a little bit about your methodology. So, what

126
00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:08.570
is literary analysis and what can we learn from

127
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.040
it?

128
00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:13.329
Yeah, uh, in the present day, uh, quantitative longitudinal

129
00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:15.489
studies are wonderful. You can reach out to people

130
00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:17.049
and follow over years to see how they think

131
00:06:17.049 --> 00:06:21.130
and act and what, what incentivizes them. Uh, THE

132
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.809
response rate for those surveys are very low when

133
00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:25.809
you go back to the 1800s or further back

134
00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:28.959
because those people are dead. But we do have

135
00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:32.679
a wonderful source in, in, uh, in human literature.

136
00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:35.700
Uh, IF you want to get insight into how

137
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.359
our ancestors thought and felt and conceived their world.

138
00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:43.130
Uh, GREAT literature from, from the era we want

139
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.640
to study literature that captured a lot of people,

140
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.170
and often with stood the test of time, a

141
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.320
wonderful sources to see how our ancestors dealt with

142
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.519
with challenges similar to those we have today, because

143
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.579
today's, it's a very, it's an existential threat, ultra

144
00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:02.579
low fertility. But our species and and and and

145
00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:07.010
our lineage has had quite a few great challenges

146
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.500
in the past that we overcame. And when we

147
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.820
look at those from the period when we have

148
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.260
literature, we can see what I did over the

149
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.660
past 800 years, how my Scandinavian ancestors have dealt

150
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.209
with mating challenges in the past. How did they,

151
00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:22.980
uh, relate to their errors mating ideology in the

152
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.100
transition between two ideologies, how did they conceptualize that?

153
00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:28.605
How did they deal with it? How would They

154
00:07:28.605 --> 00:07:31.635
able to come up with new ideologies and work

155
00:07:31.635 --> 00:07:34.204
toward creating environments that could support that ideology and

156
00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:37.174
those mating regimes. Um, THAT'S why I study literature.

157
00:07:37.204 --> 00:07:40.244
So for the present day, quantitative studies, wonderful. Uh,

158
00:07:40.285 --> 00:07:42.885
IF you go further back, uh, literature is actually

159
00:07:42.885 --> 00:07:45.084
that in my opinion, uh, the best sources you

160
00:07:45.084 --> 00:07:47.644
can have for understanding how our ancestors thought.

161
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.450
OK, but one question about that, are literary texts

162
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.369
good enough sources of evidence? I mean, because I

163
00:07:55.369 --> 00:07:58.920
was wondering, couldn't it be the case that they

164
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.329
represent mostly or just the culture of the elites

165
00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:06.640
or of the authors, the artists?

166
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.600
Yeah, absolutely. So, uh, you have to be critical

167
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.549
and you have to uh be careful with sources

168
00:08:11.549 --> 00:08:15.540
you pick. Uh. If a work of art becomes

169
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.619
hugely popular and withstands the test of time, that

170
00:08:18.619 --> 00:08:21.660
is a sign that the author has to understand

171
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.899
human nature and is able to portray the universal

172
00:08:24.899 --> 00:08:27.779
aspects of human nature and how it manifests in

173
00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:30.279
thought and behavior that makes it relatable to us

174
00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:32.739
also in the present, uh, because we have the

175
00:08:32.739 --> 00:08:36.530
same human nature. Uh, ONE issue is, yes, um,

176
00:08:36.869 --> 00:08:40.260
particularly my earlier case studies have an elite focus.

177
00:08:40.869 --> 00:08:45.030
Uh, WHICH is interesting because at the time they

178
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.099
had a different view of the elites. They were

179
00:08:47.099 --> 00:08:49.380
a lot more important than we consider them today.

180
00:08:49.669 --> 00:08:52.229
Today. There was a point in the evolution towards

181
00:08:52.229 --> 00:08:54.989
modernity where that focus changed and we started caring

182
00:08:54.989 --> 00:08:56.630
more about the people at the bottom. But yes,

183
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.630
it would be incredible to have literature from the

184
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.364
from the 1200s. By the people at the bottom,

185
00:09:02.405 --> 00:09:05.695
but that is, uh, well, we have some carvings

186
00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:08.044
on toilet walls from that time from people at

187
00:09:08.044 --> 00:09:11.325
the bottom and uh those toilet bowl carvings were

188
00:09:11.325 --> 00:09:13.515
about the same as toilet wall carvings are today,

189
00:09:13.724 --> 00:09:15.965
but it's not great literature. So yes, it is

190
00:09:15.965 --> 00:09:17.924
limited what we do get access to, but the

191
00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:20.525
access we do get can also be very valuable

192
00:09:20.525 --> 00:09:21.604
for understanding the past.

193
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.890
And what are the social functions of fiction?

194
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.530
Um, THEY are many. Uh, OUR species' unique capacity

195
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.179
for fiction allows us to think abstractly and create

196
00:09:36.179 --> 00:09:39.590
stories that didn't happen. And one in in the

197
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.590
context I'm dealing with in terms of mating, it

198
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.859
had that very literature has the important function of

199
00:09:45.869 --> 00:09:49.030
of distributing morality. So even if you take the

200
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:53.229
most mundane flat TV series today, when your children

201
00:09:53.229 --> 00:09:55.989
grow up watching TV series, even if it's not

202
00:09:55.989 --> 00:09:59.099
high art. Those TV series conveyed the morality of

203
00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:02.849
their society. What kind of endings should you, uh,

204
00:10:02.859 --> 00:10:06.489
desire, uh, how should you behave in certain contexts.

205
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.859
So with mating, we convey to children and grown-ups.

206
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.059
How are they supposed to orient themselves in the

207
00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:15.159
mating games? And then importantly, when our mating regime

208
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.419
becomes, become starts to become dysfunctional as it is

209
00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:21.599
today. Uh, WE use fiction as we use with

210
00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:26.440
other societal challenges to try to um investigate what

211
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.849
possible solutions could be. So insightful authors can dramatize

212
00:10:30.849 --> 00:10:33.440
their era's greatest challenges in a way that is

213
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.140
captivating and makes, makes people start thinking. And then

214
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.309
triggers and contributes to a public dialogue around this,

215
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.750
and through this cultural process, almost magically, it's really

216
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.630
weird. Nobody runs it. It just happens. We as

217
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.159
populations and and in group, we end up coming

218
00:10:49.159 --> 00:10:51.539
up with new solutions as a result of this,

219
00:10:51.599 --> 00:10:56.409
this cultural process. And fiction has traditionally often, uh,

220
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.239
been a very important contributor to those processes.

221
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.340
Um, BUT I would imagine that in this particular

222
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:07.820
case, before the modern age, let's say before the

223
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.580
past, mostly 100, 200 years, people, when it comes

224
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.140
to people, uh, to fiction, people would rely mostly

225
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.530
on oral traditions, right? Because the vast, vast majority

226
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.940
of people couldn't read.

227
00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:25.000
Yeah, and it is of course a tragedy that

228
00:11:25.119 --> 00:11:27.679
people didn't write down their stories over the past

229
00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:30.250
50,000 years, but that's just something we have to

230
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.729
deal with. I would have loved to have heard

231
00:11:32.729 --> 00:11:34.809
the stories they told each other around the campfires

232
00:11:34.809 --> 00:11:38.130
10,000 years ago, but those are unfortunately lost, so

233
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.640
we have to work with what we have.

234
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.849
Yeah. So in the book you talk about master

235
00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:47.929
narratives. What is that? What is a master narrative?

236
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.950
That is the underlying uh story, that is the

237
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.429
deepest story. It's the it's the um it's the

238
00:11:54.429 --> 00:11:57.590
narrative substrate of all societies. So you can say

239
00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:02.349
very broadly that uh forgers had an animist master

240
00:12:02.349 --> 00:12:07.289
narrative. Uh, AGRICULTURALISTS had a theist master narrative, and

241
00:12:07.289 --> 00:12:09.609
we modern side for the last 500 years had

242
00:12:09.609 --> 00:12:13.090
different humanist master narratives, and I would argue, I

243
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.159
actually, actually the my my next book is about

244
00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:17.570
that. It's about master narrative transitions of the past

245
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.010
millennium. Uh, AND there I, I look at how

246
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.650
the Vikings or how the Scandinavians went from being,

247
00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:28.830
uh, um, um. The having, yeah, uh, how we

248
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.109
went from the beliefs of the Viking until today's

249
00:12:31.109 --> 00:12:34.150
social democratic humanism and, and what those different change

250
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.510
of it. So it's kind of a parallel investigation.

251
00:12:36.549 --> 00:12:38.299
So in this book that we're talking about now,

252
00:12:38.429 --> 00:12:41.270
I look at the change of mating ideologies, but

253
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.229
in parallel with that, there's also a changing of

254
00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:45.710
master narrative which is the underlying story of the

255
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:49.500
society, which entirely structures how we think and interpret

256
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.309
reality. Humans can't do without those. It's inconceivable for

257
00:12:52.309 --> 00:12:55.359
a human being. Not to have a master narrative.

258
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.750
Uh, SO if you grow up, people that grow

259
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.119
up in the wild, this I'm not an expert

260
00:12:59.119 --> 00:13:00.830
on, but if, if you don't have any humans

261
00:13:01.159 --> 00:13:04.080
around you to impose on this master narrative, your

262
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.489
brain is not gonna function, uh, properly. It's, it's,

263
00:13:07.679 --> 00:13:10.080
you can look at it as the in a

264
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.520
computer setting, it's the, it's, it's the deepest software,

265
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.400
it's the operating system that allows uh the other

266
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.760
software to function.

267
00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:23.239
In the book, you claim uh quote, uh uh

268
00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:25.880
you claim that quote, groups that are unable to

269
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.200
reconcile mating requirements with their master narrative generate this

270
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.760
functional mating morality. What do you mean by that?

271
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.109
Yeah, so, uh, we have this underlying story that

272
00:13:37.109 --> 00:13:39.109
we believe in and say in Scandinavia today. I

273
00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:41.669
can use this as an example. Uh, IN in

274
00:13:41.669 --> 00:13:44.340
Norway, we're probably the most feminist country that, uh,

275
00:13:44.469 --> 00:13:47.510
that has ever existed, um, which I consider is

276
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:48.919
good. This is what I grew up with, big

277
00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:52.469
fan. Uh, BUT now that the mating regime has

278
00:13:52.469 --> 00:13:57.989
become dysfunctional. Our principles for female freedoms and the

279
00:13:57.989 --> 00:14:02.630
fear of losing female freedoms, makes it nearly impossible

280
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.940
for us in Norway to have a productive debate

281
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.869
about our mating challenges, because that underlying feminism makes

282
00:14:09.869 --> 00:14:14.469
us afraid. To question a mating regime that has

283
00:14:14.469 --> 00:14:17.429
become dysfunctional because we have free women, we are

284
00:14:17.429 --> 00:14:20.590
the first society's in human history with individual partner

285
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.830
choice, which is what free free women are women

286
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.659
get to choose their own partners. That is wonderful.

287
00:14:25.909 --> 00:14:28.510
Miraculously we've become the first societies to pull that

288
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.869
off. We've had that universally on low and short

289
00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:33.909
term markets since the 1960s, but only half the

290
00:14:33.909 --> 00:14:36.030
job is done from a feminist perspective and from

291
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.630
other perspective as well because when you have this

292
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:42.969
dramatic change. Uh, A deep, deep cultural change. If

293
00:14:42.969 --> 00:14:46.770
that sabotages reproduction, that change will not stick. The

294
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.299
population will simply disappear. So now we've created societies

295
00:14:50.299 --> 00:14:52.979
with free women and now the other half of

296
00:14:52.979 --> 00:14:55.690
the job. Is to find a way to have

297
00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:01.250
free women and sufficient reproduction. Otherwise, uh, those countries

298
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.130
in the world with free women will disappear. We

299
00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.570
see now that, uh, the only parts of the

300
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.330
primarily the part of the world where they're still

301
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.130
reproducing the numbers is Africa, the Middle East, and

302
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.489
a few countries further east. And from a Western

303
00:15:12.489 --> 00:15:15.950
perspective, those are not champions of free women. Um,

304
00:15:16.119 --> 00:15:19.359
SO if our countries disappear, then those countries will

305
00:15:19.359 --> 00:15:21.280
still be here, and I'm very fond of Africans

306
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.080
and Middle Easterns and people from the countries a

307
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.799
little bit further east, but as a social democratic

308
00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:28.880
feminist from Scandinavia, I would also love if the

309
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.690
future had free women, and that is what we

310
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.559
stand to lose now unless we're able to turn

311
00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:33.359
this trend around.

312
00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:37.960
So let's not, we'll get back to that later

313
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.219
on in our conversation, but before that, let's go

314
00:15:41.219 --> 00:15:44.289
through the kinds of ideologies of love that you

315
00:15:44.289 --> 00:15:48.130
explore in the book starting with heroic love. So,

316
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.049
what is it?

317
00:15:49.989 --> 00:15:52.190
Yeah, uh, so heroic love is the ideology of

318
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.549
the agricultural period. So when we became agriculturalists, we

319
00:15:55.549 --> 00:15:57.520
had to get together in tight knit kin groups,

320
00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.669
uh, to defend our fields. Uh, THESE were very

321
00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:05.190
hierarchical or more hierarchical and more patriarchal societies than

322
00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.979
those we had created as foragers. And we had

323
00:16:07.979 --> 00:16:10.539
a strong in-group outgroup uh way of thinking around

324
00:16:10.539 --> 00:16:12.820
the world. So our in-group were our relatives and

325
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.900
our out-groups, we could cooperate with them, but the

326
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.359
default uh state was that they were enemies. Uh,

327
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.919
THERE were times, uh, from 7 to 5000 years

328
00:16:20.919 --> 00:16:24.609
ago when we practiced universal, uh, genocide. For 2000

329
00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:27.250
years our ancestors, whenever they were strong enough, they

330
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.570
went and took because that was the only way

331
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.969
they could grow the numbers to go and take

332
00:16:29.969 --> 00:16:32.409
their neighbors' fields. So they would kill all the

333
00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:34.530
men and then impregnate all the women, and this

334
00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.210
is what we did for 2000 years. So we

335
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.219
see that the Y chromosome diversity, uh, is diminished

336
00:16:39.219 --> 00:16:41.849
by 95%. 19 out of 20 men get wiped

337
00:16:41.849 --> 00:16:45.590
off, um, off the genetic slate. So this is,

338
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.229
this is what heroic love is is about. It's,

339
00:16:48.239 --> 00:16:51.559
it's the ideology that a woman, so the way

340
00:16:51.559 --> 00:16:53.679
this is expressed, which sounds pretty bad, is that

341
00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:56.400
a woman has to love the greater warrior, even

342
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.919
if he just killed her husband or father. So

343
00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:03.390
that means that there there were no. A lot

344
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.310
of the time there weren't overarching social structures that

345
00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.670
could keep, uh, could that could impose peace on

346
00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.069
these kin groups. So it was completely legitimate if

347
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.910
you had the chance to rape or murder or

348
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.829
do what you wanted to to people in your

349
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:18.469
out groups. They, they had a very different way

350
00:17:18.469 --> 00:17:20.469
of thinking around this than we did. So as

351
00:17:20.469 --> 00:17:22.348
a woman, you have to be prepared that at

352
00:17:22.348 --> 00:17:24.270
any time uh a group of men with weapons

353
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.189
might show up and kill all the men folk

354
00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:27.750
in your kin group and take all the women.

355
00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.939
And that is what is called heroic love because

356
00:17:29.939 --> 00:17:33.060
it was considered heroic to be strong. This was

357
00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:36.099
before the Christian era that uh strong men have

358
00:17:36.099 --> 00:17:37.739
the right on their side because that is how

359
00:17:37.739 --> 00:17:40.060
it is in nature. And then we were we

360
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.010
were able to turn this around. So heroic love,

361
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:46.469
uh, was dominant and then. In the west, this

362
00:17:46.469 --> 00:17:51.229
changed around uh the 1100s, and in Scandinavia, this

363
00:17:51.229 --> 00:17:53.150
changed a little bit later in the 1200s. So

364
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.069
I, I show how, uh, with this new ideology

365
00:17:56.069 --> 00:17:59.750
of courtly love with sanctified female consent and lifelong

366
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:05.739
monogamy, um. European populations started thinking differently. Powerful men,

367
00:18:05.989 --> 00:18:08.989
uh, lost their cultural justification for raping women just

368
00:18:08.989 --> 00:18:11.430
because they could. And now it was about, now

369
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.390
this courtly ideology, uh, imposed on men that they

370
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.094
should develop sophisticated flirting skills to win over. A

371
00:18:18.094 --> 00:18:21.724
woman's promiscuous attraction system and pair bonding attraction system

372
00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:24.364
and then wait with having sex with her until,

373
00:18:24.574 --> 00:18:26.814
uh, she really wanted to have sex with you,

374
00:18:26.925 --> 00:18:30.055
which was a, uh, an enormous change and which

375
00:18:30.055 --> 00:18:32.734
was, which was what set us on course towards

376
00:18:32.734 --> 00:18:36.405
modernity and ever more empowered women, uh, over those

377
00:18:36.405 --> 00:18:37.364
800 years.

378
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:42.469
So in regards to the 1200s, tell us about

379
00:18:42.469 --> 00:18:46.469
monogamous indoctrination in some Icelandic sagas that you talk

380
00:18:46.469 --> 00:18:48.550
about in the book. I mean, what characterized these

381
00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.859
sagas and what were some of the most common

382
00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:55.709
themes explored when it comes to relationships?

383
00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.660
Yeah, so the sagas are, uh, many people think

384
00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.910
of them as, as kind of documenting the Viking

385
00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.349
Age. They were written in the 1200s, but they

386
00:19:03.349 --> 00:19:06.189
mostly the story mostly takes place from 800, 900s,

387
00:19:06.199 --> 00:19:09.790
and up until 1050. Uh, BUT the sagas are

388
00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.630
in, in terms of mating, uh, pure propaganda, or

389
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.219
at least to a very large extent. So, uh,

390
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.270
the Christian Church, we don't know exactly why they

391
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.349
have this, uh, very unique idea. So other cultures

392
00:19:21.349 --> 00:19:24.670
like you've had Jewish societies, the, the, the Roman

393
00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:29.949
Empire, they dabbled with monogamy. Monogamy were like under

394
00:19:29.949 --> 00:19:33.829
20% of societies have have had monogamy as their

395
00:19:33.829 --> 00:19:37.380
norm. But no one got so serious as the

396
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.329
Christian Church did. They had what's called the Gregorian

397
00:19:40.329 --> 00:19:43.380
reforms from the uh from uh 1050 to around

398
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.829
1200 where they wanted to wrest control over people's

399
00:19:47.829 --> 00:19:50.849
mating because if you want power over powerful men,

400
00:19:51.339 --> 00:19:53.540
uh, if you control the mating, you, you have

401
00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.939
quite a bit of leverage. So weddings used to

402
00:19:55.939 --> 00:19:58.810
be private, now they became a church matter. And,

403
00:19:58.859 --> 00:20:01.170
and for the first time in human history, uh,

404
00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.569
it was supposed about power, even on powerful men,

405
00:20:03.609 --> 00:20:06.300
that lifelong monogamy was the only option. Not just

406
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.609
monogamy, but lifelong monogamy. So before that, powerful men

407
00:20:09.609 --> 00:20:12.930
had hoarded women. And we know from Scandinavian sources

408
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:17.260
that All men had multiple women, if they had

409
00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.339
resources, if you were powerful men, you had tons

410
00:20:19.339 --> 00:20:21.280
of them, and, and we know from other parts

411
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.900
of the world that these harems could get ridiculously

412
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.250
large. So men have a strong drive for partner

413
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.069
variety and powerful men have tended to hoard women.

414
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.739
And then the church had this unique idea that

415
00:20:31.739 --> 00:20:34.660
nope, one woman per man. And if they hadn't

416
00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.329
done that, we would not be sitting here speaking,

417
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.660
uh, through a computer, modernity would not have taken

418
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.099
place. It completely changed, or to a great extent

419
00:20:42.099 --> 00:20:46.619
changed, uh, Western individual and cultural psychology. So, um,

420
00:20:46.939 --> 00:20:48.420
this was a battle then because this was really

421
00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.089
hard. It took hundreds of years to convince people

422
00:20:50.089 --> 00:20:52.420
of these new sexual morals, and the sagas were

423
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.939
part of that effort because in Iceland. So this

424
00:20:55.939 --> 00:20:57.819
was a part of the the uh the feudal

425
00:20:57.819 --> 00:21:00.859
transition. We used to live in polygynous kinship societies.

426
00:21:01.689 --> 00:21:03.729
And then with the first sexual revolution and the

427
00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:07.680
feudal transition, we went to living in feudal societies

428
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.459
instead of in kin groups and in nuclear families

429
00:21:10.459 --> 00:21:13.739
underpinned by lifelong monogamy. And that was a that

430
00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:16.939
was a hard transition that that didn't necessarily feel

431
00:21:16.939 --> 00:21:19.689
natural to us. So in the Saga, instead of

432
00:21:19.689 --> 00:21:22.640
portraying what the Viking age was really like, when

433
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.339
men would go out and powerful men would compete

434
00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:28.699
for women their entire lives, they would accumulate wives,

435
00:21:28.859 --> 00:21:32.530
concubines, sex slaves. Uh, THE young talented men of

436
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.530
the sagas, they have a tendency to get 3

437
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.719
years to increase their, to maximize their partner value,

438
00:21:38.969 --> 00:21:41.089
and then they have to settle down and marry

439
00:21:41.089 --> 00:21:43.569
one woman for life and, and, and take care

440
00:21:43.569 --> 00:21:46.609
of their farm. Um, AND if they don't do

441
00:21:46.609 --> 00:21:49.770
that, they tend to get, uh, get punished by

442
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:53.410
the narrative. And when the saga deals with the

443
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:57.750
former mating regime, the polygyny, the sexual slavery. Very

444
00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:00.920
rarely mentioned and then often done so so apologetically

445
00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.000
that it it it's perceived as some kind of

446
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.390
whitewashing. So it's really, and, and they're also trying

447
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.859
to push up women's position because this was very

448
00:22:08.859 --> 00:22:11.920
empowering for women. Uh, THERE was a fallacy in

449
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.949
the past, especially in the 1990s, where, uh, especially

450
00:22:16.949 --> 00:22:21.609
gender scholars would argue that, uh, uh, the pre-Christian

451
00:22:21.609 --> 00:22:24.400
era and then especially the Vikings were very, very

452
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.300
pro-women, uh. One feminist scholar from Iceland even claimed

453
00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.219
that in the late Iron Age women had the

454
00:22:31.219 --> 00:22:35.099
power, which is ridiculous. It's very naive. Um, AND

455
00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:37.660
then Christianity came and ruined everything for women. That

456
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.609
is not the case. Uh, POLYGY is not what

457
00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:43.400
and The polygyny we had at that time was

458
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.280
not good for women. It turned women into commodities

459
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.750
that men competed over, um, like that free strong

460
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.469
Viking women women was mostly a myth, and then

461
00:22:55.119 --> 00:22:57.719
through what the church did with the imposition of

462
00:22:57.719 --> 00:23:03.020
lifelong monogamy and also sanctification of female consent. That

463
00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.900
put put women on the path of emancipation that

464
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.540
is ongoing until today. And you see how the

465
00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.979
sagas are engaging in this battle of the first

466
00:23:10.979 --> 00:23:15.099
sexual revolution, trying to convince even powerful men that

467
00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:17.569
they should settle for having only one woman.

468
00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.069
OK, so you mentioned the first sexual revolution there.

469
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.030
What is it? Or what was it? What characterized

470
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:25.410
it?

471
00:23:26.109 --> 00:23:27.979
Yeah, so this, this was the, uh, the result

472
00:23:27.979 --> 00:23:30.339
of the Gregorian Forum when the church decided that

473
00:23:30.339 --> 00:23:32.250
they wanted this new mating regime, they wanted this

474
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:37.219
power, and that it was most importantly, uh, lifelong

475
00:23:37.219 --> 00:23:41.150
monogamy, no more polygamy, lifelong monogamy for everyone, and

476
00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.829
then the other part was female consent. And, and,

477
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.579
and to achieve this, they, they dissolved Europe's uh

478
00:23:47.579 --> 00:23:49.459
kin groups. So instead of living in polygynist kin

479
00:23:49.459 --> 00:23:51.619
groups who now, as I said, lived in nuclear

480
00:23:51.619 --> 00:23:55.050
families, which was a a. Immensely influential in terms

481
00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.609
of our psychology, especially over the the the ensuing

482
00:23:58.609 --> 00:24:00.890
centuries. Uh, SO that was what the first sexual

483
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:05.020
revolution was about, which, in my opinion, What's the

484
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.780
greatest change that happened in human history since the

485
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.099
introduction of agriculture. It, I mean, it is, that

486
00:24:11.099 --> 00:24:14.609
was enormous, and we're dealing with the ramifications still.

487
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.310
And it is now sending us on a path

488
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.430
of self eradication unless we're able to deal with

489
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.630
the consequences because what the Western in the western

490
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.229
individual was created by the first sexual revolution. When

491
00:24:26.229 --> 00:24:28.420
you live in kin groups, you have to, uh,

492
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.709
submit to the needs of your group. When you

493
00:24:30.709 --> 00:24:33.420
live in a nuclear family, you become increasingly individualistic

494
00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.550
and this is also what eventually triggered the feminist

495
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:40.089
movement because. Men and women wanted to choose their

496
00:24:40.089 --> 00:24:43.209
own partners. No human society had offered them that

497
00:24:43.209 --> 00:24:45.400
before, but we have a desire to do this.

498
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.050
It just no one were able to make that

499
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.810
work in the past. And now around 1968, we

500
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.640
succeeded. We now have individual choice and free women,

501
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:57.089
and we are, we're not handling it. Maybe this

502
00:24:57.089 --> 00:24:59.410
is why no other society in the past tried

503
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.680
this, uh, because it simply didn't work. It didn't,

504
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:06.579
uh, facilitate sufficient reproduction. And now we have individual

505
00:25:06.579 --> 00:25:09.060
partner choice, but in addition, we have prosperity so

506
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.489
we can afford to be single, and we have

507
00:25:11.739 --> 00:25:15.699
effective contraceptives, so we have a decoupled copulation uh

508
00:25:15.699 --> 00:25:19.290
from reproduction. So it's we've given ourselves a significant

509
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:22.250
challenge, but I'm naively optimistic, and I think there

510
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.810
are ways that that this can be solved. We've

511
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:28.530
overcome our species has overcome large mating challenges in

512
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.170
the past, and I think we can solve this

513
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.050
one too, but that means that we have to

514
00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.209
start talking about it and start experimenting and see

515
00:25:34.209 --> 00:25:36.209
what we can do to create a new mating

516
00:25:36.209 --> 00:25:36.650
regime.

517
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.439
OK, we'll come back to 1968 later on in

518
00:25:40.439 --> 00:25:43.439
our conversation, but there, there's still a few steps

519
00:25:43.439 --> 00:25:46.270
to take before we get there. So, uh, uh,

520
00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:49.599
earlier you mentioned briefly curtly love. Uh, COULD you

521
00:25:49.599 --> 00:25:52.209
tell us more about that? What is curtly love

522
00:25:52.209 --> 00:25:56.599
and when was it, uh, dominant, let's say.

523
00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.969
Yeah. So, courtly love. EVOLVED in the 1100s around

524
00:26:01.969 --> 00:26:03.719
France. We don't need to get into too much

525
00:26:03.719 --> 00:26:05.680
detail of how it, how it emerged, but it

526
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.920
was, there was a need after the first sexual

527
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.160
revolution or with these Gregorian reforms. We need a

528
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.839
new culture because, uh, powerful men, powerful warriors didn't

529
00:26:16.839 --> 00:26:20.750
really want to stop raping. Uh, POWERFUL men didn't

530
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.339
want to just have one woman. So we needed

531
00:26:23.339 --> 00:26:26.109
to indoctrinate them with new ideologies. So court to

532
00:26:26.109 --> 00:26:28.189
love isn't something you can have a, you could

533
00:26:28.189 --> 00:26:30.630
have a social order built on heroic love. That

534
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.670
was a rape culture that worked. COURTLY love, you

535
00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.589
cannot build a social order. It was what I

536
00:26:35.589 --> 00:26:38.900
call a cultural dissolvent, meant to dissolve heroic love.

537
00:26:39.229 --> 00:26:41.069
So it came up with all these fancy concepts

538
00:26:41.069 --> 00:26:45.660
for love, love being something incredibly strong, never ending,

539
00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:50.920
etc. AND it prescribed very uh. Strange way of

540
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.189
courting very stiff formal language, uh, very flattering ways

541
00:26:55.189 --> 00:26:59.890
of talking to each other, um. And this was

542
00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:03.829
a way to motivate Europeans to now start. Uh,

543
00:27:03.839 --> 00:27:05.839
HITTING on each other to start charming each other.

544
00:27:06.319 --> 00:27:08.680
Before it was you had very under the kinship

545
00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.199
groups, arranged marriages were very strict. It wasn't, it

546
00:27:12.199 --> 00:27:15.400
was much less the individuals had much less influence

547
00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.359
on it. It was more like a commercial contract

548
00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:20.079
between families. So now, so if I mean, the

549
00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:22.160
most deadly thing in the sagas is being a

550
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.760
bachelor, uh, talking to women. If you're a flirty

551
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.199
bachelor, you will die. It's and it's not gonna

552
00:27:27.199 --> 00:27:29.689
take a lot of pages. And now with with

553
00:27:29.689 --> 00:27:32.609
this uh first sexual revolution, men and women had

554
00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:34.569
to start talking to each other. This triggered in

555
00:27:34.569 --> 00:27:37.689
Scandinavia in the 1300s a dance craze. So instead

556
00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:40.130
of murdering unrelated men trying to speak to your

557
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.209
sister, you know how to now you have to

558
00:27:42.209 --> 00:27:45.329
create dance events where young single people could come

559
00:27:45.329 --> 00:27:46.930
together and flirt and see if they liked each

560
00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:51.089
other. And Cole Love was an exaggerated way of

561
00:27:51.089 --> 00:27:54.930
prescribing the manners, ways of thinking and acting. Uh,

562
00:27:54.979 --> 00:27:58.170
THAT facilitated flirting and pair bonding, where the individuals

563
00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.089
were empowered, uh, to have a bigger say than

564
00:28:00.089 --> 00:28:02.420
they used to have in the past. Uh, SO

565
00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.910
when you read those stories, it's, it's a little

566
00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:07.449
bit odd. It's these knights that travel around Europe

567
00:28:07.449 --> 00:28:10.209
looking for, for, for, for the one, and then

568
00:28:10.209 --> 00:28:12.969
fighting dragons and monsters to win her over. And

569
00:28:12.969 --> 00:28:15.319
it's really interesting. I've I've studied that deeply and

570
00:28:15.369 --> 00:28:18.300
and published. Uh, QUITE a bit on it. Uh,

571
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.439
AND, and where you go into the analysis and

572
00:28:20.439 --> 00:28:22.790
you see that it's, it's imbued with a very

573
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.560
strong understanding of how human mating nature works, how

574
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.660
our, our, our, our mate preferences or mating psychologists,

575
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:33.000
uh. But it's, it's not telling you what to

576
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.920
do. It's kind of making you think differently, get

577
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.520
new values and norms that you then play out

578
00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.760
in in your specific environment. So that was the

579
00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.790
function of corporate love. It, it arose, it went

580
00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:49.040
into romances, which was an old genre, and then

581
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.839
it influenced, so in, in um Norway's first quarterly

582
00:28:52.839 --> 00:28:55.920
romance came in 1226. That was the beginning of

583
00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.079
the period in Norway. And then around 75 years

584
00:29:00.079 --> 00:29:04.969
later, uh, the aristocratic warriors stopped raiding, uh, stopped

585
00:29:04.969 --> 00:29:09.800
raping, uh, using heroic love as their justification, and

586
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.359
about 50 years later, uh, Norwegian commoners too had

587
00:29:13.359 --> 00:29:16.839
internalized the righteousness of female consent. So yeah, you

588
00:29:16.839 --> 00:29:19.800
could say it was about a century long uh

589
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.479
process in order for these norms and values to

590
00:29:22.479 --> 00:29:24.640
spread throughout the population. And when that had happened,

591
00:29:25.069 --> 00:29:28.349
Uh, court love just disappears, that ideology. So it

592
00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:31.270
had a it had a transitional function in taking

593
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:35.040
us from the former mating regime into the new

594
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.069
one, going from heroic love to companionate love, which

595
00:29:38.069 --> 00:29:41.790
was a more uh pragmatic ideology. No big emotion

596
00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.030
like court love is all about emotions, and you're

597
00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:46.790
supposed to die. You're just supposed to be incredibly

598
00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.739
in love with the only one. And that doesn't

599
00:29:49.739 --> 00:29:51.819
work out, and then you both die tragically and

600
00:29:51.819 --> 00:29:55.829
beautifully. Companionate love was a lot more pragmatic. It's

601
00:29:55.829 --> 00:29:58.869
arranged marriages, you have some influence as individuals, but

602
00:29:58.869 --> 00:30:02.640
your parents are in reality in charge. So, uh,

603
00:30:02.709 --> 00:30:05.939
the, the main tenet of companionate love was to

604
00:30:05.939 --> 00:30:09.000
just stick it out and focus on running your

605
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:10.949
your household and your farm and try to keep

606
00:30:10.949 --> 00:30:13.589
as many children alive through the winter. So it

607
00:30:13.589 --> 00:30:17.270
wasn't about self realization, it wasn't about strong orgasms,

608
00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:20.849
it wasn't about warm romance, it was about keeping

609
00:30:20.849 --> 00:30:23.410
people alive in an environment that was very harsh.

610
00:30:24.859 --> 00:30:28.869
Right. Uh, HOW about in cells or involuntary celibates?

611
00:30:28.979 --> 00:30:33.060
Are they simply a modern phenomenon or can we

612
00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:38.890
already see in cells in in in literature in,

613
00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.000
I mean, older times, let's say.

614
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.819
Yeah, uh, so. In incels have always been with

615
00:30:45.819 --> 00:30:48.329
it. INCELS are the men that do not get

616
00:30:48.329 --> 00:30:51.750
to, uh, to breed. Uh, SO in our original

617
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:56.579
promiscuous mating system, 6 million years ago, uh, maybe

618
00:30:56.579 --> 00:31:00.780
most males didn't get to breed. Um, AND then

619
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.410
at the beginning of pair bonding, which we believe

620
00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:07.300
was strongly polygynous. Then maybe most or a large

621
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.939
proportion of men didn't get to breed because uh

622
00:31:09.939 --> 00:31:11.500
we went to pair bonding, but then the most

623
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.510
superior males would hoard women. And then because our

624
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.670
offspring became so needy and because it was so

625
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.349
hard for foragers to uh to uh take care

626
00:31:21.349 --> 00:31:24.619
of many women, around 2 million years ago, the

627
00:31:24.619 --> 00:31:27.020
norm had become monogamy, but we still had some

628
00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.869
uh polygyny. And then with the introduction of agriculture

629
00:31:30.869 --> 00:31:33.469
12,000 years ago, the powerful men could again start

630
00:31:33.469 --> 00:31:36.469
hoarding women at a at a at sometimes ridiculous

631
00:31:36.469 --> 00:31:39.250
rate, and then it became much fewer for men.

632
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.469
So this changes with the environment. So if you

633
00:31:41.469 --> 00:31:44.349
over the last thousands of years, we see when

634
00:31:44.349 --> 00:31:47.660
times are great, when the economy is strong, uh,

635
00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.390
then a lot of resources go to the powerful

636
00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:52.750
men and they start hoarding women, and then when

637
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.390
times are bad, not many men can afford many

638
00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:59.270
women. So then it's more sexually egalitarian. Uh, A

639
00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:02.140
main hypothesis for what triggered the Viking Age, uh,

640
00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:05.550
was the prevalence of incels. Um, THE, the times

641
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.349
were so good that the elites hoarded all the

642
00:32:07.349 --> 00:32:11.790
women. So when raiding opportunities opened up, uh, Scandinavian

643
00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:14.349
Vikings were Scandinavian incels. They grabbed for their oars

644
00:32:14.349 --> 00:32:16.750
and their swords to go down to the continent

645
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.829
and raid for wealth and status so that they

646
00:32:18.829 --> 00:32:22.260
could enter into the domestic marriage market in Scandinavia,

647
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.920
but also capture women for uh long and short

648
00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:29.689
term use abroad. Um. The problem with having a

649
00:32:29.689 --> 00:32:32.640
lot of incels or or bachelors or unmarried men,

650
00:32:33.369 --> 00:32:35.489
uh, is, is captured in what's called the the

651
00:32:35.489 --> 00:32:38.239
young male syndrome. Uh, WHEN you have a large,

652
00:32:38.329 --> 00:32:41.250
uh, when men do not, when men struggle to

653
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:44.810
mate, they're incentivized to become more aggressive, more risk

654
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:48.130
taking, to compete harder, and this, this creates social

655
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:51.520
instability. We know from, from the ethnographic record that

656
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:54.890
societies with a high proportion of bachelors struggle with

657
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.829
all kinds of issues in terms of crime. Uh,

658
00:32:58.239 --> 00:33:03.079
ATTACKS on women, uh, political instability, etc. So one

659
00:33:03.079 --> 00:33:06.650
of, so what created what was, what was the,

660
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:09.760
the golden age for low value men was the

661
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.800
period from the first to the third sexual revolution,

662
00:33:13.119 --> 00:33:16.719
from the 1100s until around 1968. Cause when the

663
00:33:16.719 --> 00:33:20.400
church had this unique idea of lifelong monogamy, it

664
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.839
meant that instead of the elites hoarding all the

665
00:33:22.839 --> 00:33:26.430
women. Uh, IT would now be approximately 1 woman

666
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.359
per man. So when this regime peaked, the romantic

667
00:33:29.359 --> 00:33:32.339
regime peaked in the 1950s, in the West, nearly

668
00:33:32.339 --> 00:33:34.619
every single person married and they married early and

669
00:33:34.619 --> 00:33:37.979
started producing babies, uh, early too. So, in that

670
00:33:37.979 --> 00:33:40.060
period, that was the unique, that was the anomalous

671
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.699
period, uh, when low value men could had a

672
00:33:43.699 --> 00:33:47.540
very strong chance of of acquiring a female. Uh,

673
00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:50.140
WE know from our DNA that we have uh

674
00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.910
twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors. Meaning

675
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:57.300
that of all the the humans that reach adulthood,

676
00:33:57.709 --> 00:34:00.949
perhaps 80% of women reproduced, while only 40% of

677
00:34:00.949 --> 00:34:07.349
men. Uh, SO, in seldom has been common throughout

678
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.000
human and harmon history. It's just that we had

679
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.120
that period, uh, from the 1st to the 3rd

680
00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.149
sexual revolution that was uniquely sexual egalitarian, and now

681
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:20.110
that we again have free mating markets, uh, then

682
00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:23.719
female mating psychology is such that it's very predictable

683
00:34:23.958 --> 00:34:27.239
that they will start excluding uh a quite large

684
00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:30.040
proportion of the men that they consider least attractive.

685
00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.629
Mhm. So we talked about the first sexual revolution

686
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:36.949
or what you call the first sexual revolution in

687
00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:40.389
the book. What about the second sexual revolution which

688
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:44.100
occurred in the 1700s? What characterized it?

689
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:46.708
Yeah, so, um, the first sexual revolution and the

690
00:34:46.708 --> 00:34:50.188
feudal transition, this us going into living in nuclear

691
00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:52.870
families instead of uh kin groups, uh started a

692
00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:56.389
process of ever greater individualization. And an important aspect

693
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:59.479
of that was that individuals wanted to choose strong

694
00:34:59.479 --> 00:35:01.989
mates for sex and relationship for the short and

695
00:35:01.989 --> 00:35:06.790
long-term market. And around 1750, um, what was called

696
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:10.699
the, the, the European marriage pattern burst because uh.

697
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.949
Because we lived in nuclear families in Europe, we

698
00:35:13.949 --> 00:35:15.750
had a special marriage pattern because you had to

699
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:19.060
accumulate resources to start your own household. So, uh,

700
00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:22.030
Europeans didn't marry and, and typically until they were

701
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:24.350
in their late twenties, which shortened women's reproductive wyom

702
00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:28.370
and kept the population growth in check. Uh, AND

703
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:30.169
you were supposed to then go for more than

704
00:35:30.169 --> 00:35:32.830
a decade after you reached sexual maturity without having

705
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.689
sex, which was a big challenge. And around 1750,

706
00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:39.939
young Europeans didn't want that anymore. Uh, THEY had

707
00:35:39.939 --> 00:35:42.250
started, so a lot of people worked as domestic

708
00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.169
servants in their youth, that was kind of the

709
00:35:44.169 --> 00:35:47.090
college of the day, and that was wage labor

710
00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:49.889
that started being paid more in cash with empowered

711
00:35:49.889 --> 00:35:54.219
women. And work opportunities started appearing further and further

712
00:35:54.219 --> 00:35:57.379
away from where you grew up, so familial control

713
00:35:57.379 --> 00:36:01.580
over your sexuality decreased. And um this was a

714
00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:05.300
century where individuals wanted all kinds of wanted to

715
00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:09.100
take all kinds of decisions politically, economically, but also

716
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.530
in terms of mating and perhaps most people mating,

717
00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.939
being able to choose your own sex and romantic

718
00:36:13.939 --> 00:36:16.540
partner was probably a lot bigger deal than getting

719
00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.620
to vote in a political election. That would be

720
00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:22.010
my guess. So around 1750, the European marriage uh

721
00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:25.969
uh pattern burst. And the women started to uh

722
00:36:25.969 --> 00:36:28.770
to decide who to pick their own partners and

723
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:32.879
start having sex before marriage, and this was. Partly

724
00:36:32.879 --> 00:36:37.080
catastrophical, uh, partly catastrophic. So what happened was that

725
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:40.959
the rates of illegitimacy in Northwestern Europe doubled, tripled,

726
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.520
quadrupled, um, in Stockholm, for instance, about half of,

727
00:36:45.669 --> 00:36:48.439
of children were to unwed mothers. So what happened

728
00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:51.669
is that. Humans have never lived in societies where

729
00:36:51.669 --> 00:36:53.270
we get to pick our own partners, so we

730
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:55.820
haven't, this is one hypothesis that there's a mismash,

731
00:36:55.909 --> 00:36:59.540
mismatch. We haven't evolved or women haven't evolved, uh,

732
00:36:59.669 --> 00:37:04.419
the skills necessary to evaluate their own and suitor's

733
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.469
partner value and to look through the deception of

734
00:37:07.469 --> 00:37:10.270
men. So what happened with the second, uh, sexual

735
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:13.030
revolution was that the typical pattern was that a

736
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.219
higher status man. Would charm a woman and then

737
00:37:16.219 --> 00:37:17.739
try to get her to bed and then she

738
00:37:17.739 --> 00:37:19.580
said, but I'm afraid I'm going to be pregnant.

739
00:37:19.659 --> 00:37:21.409
But of course I love you, he would say,

740
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.979
if you get pregnant, I will marry you. They

741
00:37:23.979 --> 00:37:26.060
would have sex and eventually she will get pregnant.

742
00:37:26.479 --> 00:37:27.860
And then he would hit the road and leave

743
00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.659
for her to deal with the child alone. And

744
00:37:29.659 --> 00:37:32.010
this of course was was catastrophic at this time

745
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.979
for women. They were, um, socially subjugated legally, etc.

746
00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.580
So ending up as a, as a, as a

747
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.659
single mother had could have tremendously negative effects on

748
00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:43.860
your life. So you had a brief period from

749
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:47.540
around 1750 to the 1800s with the ideology that

750
00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.179
I refer to as liberty and love, which again,

751
00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.229
you can't at that time build a social order

752
00:37:52.229 --> 00:37:55.389
on. It was a cultural dissolvent. To dissolve the

753
00:37:55.389 --> 00:37:58.870
pragmatic ethos of companionate love, uh, it was a

754
00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:01.389
way to push through this individual choice in terms

755
00:38:01.389 --> 00:38:05.139
of partner. So the cultural response was romantic love.

756
00:38:05.429 --> 00:38:09.729
This was romanticism from the early 1800s that reattached

757
00:38:09.729 --> 00:38:12.270
population repair bondings. So try to convince men and

758
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:16.129
women not to sleep around promiscuously with those with

759
00:38:16.129 --> 00:38:18.959
the social devastation that that brought. Uh, THEY try

760
00:38:18.959 --> 00:38:21.350
to convince people to wait to have sex until

761
00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:24.040
you were married and keep sex within a heterosexual

762
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.149
pair bond that was meant to last for life.

763
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.879
And that took about that process also was about

764
00:38:28.879 --> 00:38:32.239
100 years. So you see from 1850, uh, romanticism

765
00:38:32.239 --> 00:38:34.120
has had played its part, and also there were

766
00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.239
other influences on this, and then you see rates

767
00:38:36.239 --> 00:38:39.320
of legit legitimacy start plummeting across the west.

768
00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:43.739
Uh, JUST, uh, uh, let's just slow down a

769
00:38:43.739 --> 00:38:47.060
little bit. You mentioned liberty love there. Uh, TELL

770
00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.010
us a little bit more about it and what,

771
00:38:49.179 --> 00:38:52.209
which period was characterized by it.

772
00:38:52.739 --> 00:38:56.260
So from around 1750, this was a way of

773
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.899
thinking that spread from the French court, uh, to

774
00:38:58.899 --> 00:39:01.419
the capitals around Europe and further from there. So

775
00:39:01.419 --> 00:39:03.580
it was kind of a this urban elite way

776
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.610
of thinking. It means that we're individuals. We can

777
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:09.479
do whatever we want. Sex is a wonderful source

778
00:39:09.479 --> 00:39:12.010
of intoxication, and after royal balls, if we want

779
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:14.969
to go fornicate in the bushes, why would anyone

780
00:39:14.969 --> 00:39:17.729
want to stop us? And for elites, that's, that

781
00:39:17.729 --> 00:39:19.320
could be a good way of running your life,

782
00:39:19.449 --> 00:39:21.639
uh, but for regular people in the late 18th

783
00:39:21.639 --> 00:39:26.955
century. Uh, FOR women who didn't have access to

784
00:39:26.955 --> 00:39:29.435
employment to the extent that men had, uh, who

785
00:39:29.435 --> 00:39:33.094
faced great social condemnation if they became pregnant out

786
00:39:33.094 --> 00:39:36.955
of wedlock, uh, this way of arranging your mating

787
00:39:36.955 --> 00:39:39.675
had, it had just a tremendously negative effects for

788
00:39:39.675 --> 00:39:42.635
many women that it wasn't sustainable. It wasn't a

789
00:39:42.635 --> 00:39:44.834
good way to run a society before you have

790
00:39:44.834 --> 00:39:49.459
enough prosperity and the contraceptive pill. Um, SO it,

791
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:53.449
it was, there's a particularly a Swedish, uh, singer.

792
00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.139
Some call him the greatest song composer of all

793
00:39:56.139 --> 00:40:00.340
times. He's considered the, the. The Mozart and Shakespeare

794
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.020
of drinking songs. He had a period of 20

795
00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.370
years when he composed his songs where he, uh,

796
00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:09.260
first extolled this the wonderful intoxication that promiscuous sex

797
00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.300
with women had, and he created this, he expresses

798
00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.629
this liberty and ideology. Are you just supposed to

799
00:40:15.629 --> 00:40:19.290
drink and fornicate and enjoy life, and then across

800
00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:21.340
those 20 years you see he starts playing out

801
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.870
the negative consequences of this and then. In 1790,

802
00:40:24.909 --> 00:40:27.239
he retires his ethos of liberty and love and

803
00:40:27.239 --> 00:40:30.110
points toward the romantic ethos. It just didn't play

804
00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:32.989
out how we have hope, but it did, uh,

805
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.669
it did serve its function as a cultural dissolvent.

806
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:37.649
It did take us away from that regime of

807
00:40:37.649 --> 00:40:40.800
arranged marriages and push us toward the future and,

808
00:40:41.429 --> 00:40:42.830
and it put us, put us on a path.

809
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:46.340
It created this strong desire in us to uh

810
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:48.870
to do choose our own partners and, and you

811
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:52.500
could see modernity as a way of. Facilitating individual

812
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.479
choice. You see this in the literature how men

813
00:40:54.479 --> 00:40:57.340
and women discuss this, uh, especially in the Scandinavian

814
00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.060
modern breakthrough, a literary movement from the, from around

815
00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.659
the 1880s, they end up concluding that if we're

816
00:41:03.659 --> 00:41:06.459
gonna have individual partner choice, although they didn't use

817
00:41:06.459 --> 00:41:09.459
those evolutionary terms, uh, we're gonna need to create

818
00:41:09.459 --> 00:41:11.739
a society in which a man is not obliged

819
00:41:11.739 --> 00:41:13.580
to support a woman for life just because he

820
00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.280
got her pregnant. Women need to have their own

821
00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.989
well-paying jobs just as men. And uh and and

822
00:41:19.989 --> 00:41:21.590
this is what we work toward. And then in

823
00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:24.229
the 1960s with post-World War II prosperity and the

824
00:41:24.229 --> 00:41:27.590
contraceptive pill, we finally had an environment where we

825
00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:30.229
could afford to let women be free and choose

826
00:41:30.229 --> 00:41:33.479
their own partners because the enormous detriment uh wasn't

827
00:41:33.479 --> 00:41:34.040
there anymore.

828
00:41:35.959 --> 00:41:39.120
So, uh, let's go back to, because earlier you've

829
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:43.600
already briefly mentioned it, let's go back to 1968,

830
00:41:43.709 --> 00:41:47.800
then, I mean, why the year 1968? What happened

831
00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.320
there? What came and what came after it in

832
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.429
terms of love?

833
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.959
Yeah, 1968 is just symbolic. This, uh, this push

834
00:41:56.959 --> 00:42:01.469
so. People started talking, as I said already in

835
00:42:01.469 --> 00:42:05.879
the 1700s of of the That the principle should

836
00:42:05.879 --> 00:42:08.840
be individual partner choice. We just didn't have the

837
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.000
environment for it. And then after World War II,

838
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.560
the economy and the contraceptive pill created it. So

839
00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.639
that process that pushed toward this wasn't started with

840
00:42:17.639 --> 00:42:20.800
the feminists of 1968. It was started with the

841
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.280
high value men of the early 1950s. Uh, THIS

842
00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.560
was called the, the, I think it was called

843
00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:31.560
the conformity revolt led by Hugh Hefner. So Playboy,

844
00:42:31.689 --> 00:42:34.530
if you want to understand this revolution, uh, we

845
00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:37.209
like to think maybe that the feminists of 1968

846
00:42:37.209 --> 00:42:38.889
were the most important one, but at least who

847
00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:40.850
started it, were the high value men of the

848
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:44.639
1950s who wanted to sleep around without being economically

849
00:42:44.639 --> 00:42:48.060
responsible for the woman. They wanted to have what

850
00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.850
high value men have wanted generally through all times

851
00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:53.219
for millions of years. They wanted many women. They

852
00:42:53.219 --> 00:42:55.959
were at the top. Women were attracted to them,

853
00:42:56.179 --> 00:42:58.709
so they wanted hope for, well, a very large

854
00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:01.020
or unlimited access to women that they could have

855
00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.260
sex with, and then move on to the next

856
00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.439
woman because they enjoyed having sex with women promiscuously.

857
00:43:06.699 --> 00:43:09.129
While in the past, there was this expectation that

858
00:43:09.139 --> 00:43:11.739
that sex would lead to marriage. In fact, up

859
00:43:11.739 --> 00:43:15.959
until 1734 in Norway. Uh, WE had a law

860
00:43:15.959 --> 00:43:18.479
that said if, if, if a man has sex

861
00:43:18.479 --> 00:43:21.199
with a woman, she is entitled to marry him.

862
00:43:21.939 --> 00:43:24.699
Um, SO in 19 in the early 1950s, this

863
00:43:24.699 --> 00:43:27.179
was the conformity revolt with high value men saying

864
00:43:27.179 --> 00:43:29.290
that we want to sleep around a lot more.

865
00:43:29.979 --> 00:43:32.540
And then in the 1960s, you had the, the,

866
00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.199
the, the women, the women's freedom movement, where women

867
00:43:35.199 --> 00:43:37.040
wanted to make their own choices and all kinds

868
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.360
of social arenas, also the sexual one. And then

869
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:44.399
we see uh after that cultural culmination of protests

870
00:43:44.399 --> 00:43:47.629
and uh yeah, everything that happened at that time,

871
00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.679
you see from the early 70s on in the

872
00:43:50.679 --> 00:43:54.479
statistics what happened. So in the 1950s, the, the

873
00:43:54.479 --> 00:43:57.439
former romantic regime peaked, as I mentioned, and now

874
00:43:57.439 --> 00:44:00.760
you just see from having universal marriage, marriage rates

875
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:05.909
plummets, divorce rates skyrocket, uh, you just see, you

876
00:44:05.909 --> 00:44:07.760
just see, you just see the world changing in

877
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.919
these numbers. And interestingly, you got a counter reaction

878
00:44:10.919 --> 00:44:12.790
right away that I also cover in the book,

879
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.659
uh, where. The utopia of the new ideology of

880
00:44:17.659 --> 00:44:19.979
love is called confluent love. It it's, it means

881
00:44:19.979 --> 00:44:22.659
come together and and move away from each other

882
00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:25.169
again, so it's serial pair bonding and dispersed with

883
00:44:25.179 --> 00:44:30.080
with opportunistic short term copulation. So, uh, the utopia

884
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.830
of these different loves are are interesting. So in

885
00:44:33.169 --> 00:44:36.389
the romantic utopia had been that you find someone

886
00:44:36.389 --> 00:44:38.199
that you have true love with and it lasts

887
00:44:38.199 --> 00:44:41.429
for life and everything is gonna be great. And

888
00:44:41.429 --> 00:44:43.590
then in the 1950s when everybody married, a lot

889
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.629
of women found out that being a stay at

890
00:44:45.629 --> 00:44:48.459
home mom wasn't necessarily a utopia. And the man

891
00:44:48.459 --> 00:44:52.070
found that being a breadwinner also wasn't necessarily that

892
00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:54.510
great. So the utopia of confluent love, but if

893
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:57.389
we only free ourselves from the cultural oppression of

894
00:44:57.389 --> 00:45:00.510
the past, all men and women will be free

895
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:03.709
to live out their erotic and romantic desires. And

896
00:45:03.709 --> 00:45:05.389
that's not the case. We know today more than

897
00:45:05.389 --> 00:45:07.709
half of single people in America have withdrawn from

898
00:45:07.709 --> 00:45:11.219
short and long term mating, uh. The lack of

899
00:45:11.219 --> 00:45:14.540
sex is going up, uh, relationships have plummeted, single

900
00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.419
them as character and so it's that utopia was

901
00:45:16.419 --> 00:45:18.909
wrong too from, for reasons we can return to.

902
00:45:19.219 --> 00:45:21.139
But we saw already in the early 70s that

903
00:45:21.139 --> 00:45:23.580
women started complaining that now that they're free to

904
00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:26.820
choose their own partners, uh they were expected to

905
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.979
uh to sleep around and not have emotion for

906
00:45:28.979 --> 00:45:30.780
those men. So what, what you saw then was

907
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.370
again that what you always see that women will,

908
00:45:33.379 --> 00:45:36.909
because of their promiscuous attraction system be drawn primarily

909
00:45:36.909 --> 00:45:39.629
to the most attractive men. And those men will

910
00:45:39.629 --> 00:45:42.260
be incentivized to go through many women. So you

911
00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.340
see that today the top percentile of men have

912
00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.620
more than 100 sex partners to their life, while

913
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.479
the men at the bottom are regular men, they,

914
00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:53.310
they have very few and perhaps only. Well, fewer

915
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:55.580
than 10% of men perhaps get to live up

916
00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.750
to their ideals for how many sex partners they

917
00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:00.030
want. In Norway, that number of men want 25

918
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.709
sex partners. Uh, WOMEN think 5 is enough in

919
00:46:02.709 --> 00:46:04.669
their life for them, because these are, this is

920
00:46:04.669 --> 00:46:07.830
an important gender difference that drives the dynamic that

921
00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:10.189
now that we have free market, uh, we see

922
00:46:10.189 --> 00:46:13.189
that mating opportunities are challenged predominantly to the highest

923
00:46:13.189 --> 00:46:17.070
value men, uh, which has adverse sequences consequences for

924
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:20.264
pair bonding, which again, uh. THEIR fertility rate. So

925
00:46:20.264 --> 00:46:23.794
in today Norwegian women want 2.4 children, but they

926
00:46:23.794 --> 00:46:26.754
only have 1.4%. And one of the main causes

927
00:46:26.754 --> 00:46:28.514
of that is that women are unable to find

928
00:46:28.514 --> 00:46:30.584
a man that they consider to be good enough

929
00:46:30.584 --> 00:46:32.465
that is also willing to pair bond with them.

930
00:46:32.675 --> 00:46:35.794
And you saw this already in the early 1970s

931
00:46:35.794 --> 00:46:38.314
when these free markets were established. It's just that

932
00:46:38.314 --> 00:46:41.344
now with modern technologies and dating apps like Tinder,

933
00:46:41.635 --> 00:46:44.274
uh, we've just thrown so much gasoline on on

934
00:46:44.274 --> 00:46:48.429
these processes that, uh. Our societies are burning down

935
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.360
just to uh express that a little bit too

936
00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.149
dramatically.

937
00:46:51.679 --> 00:46:54.399
Yeah, we'll come back to that point later, but

938
00:46:54.399 --> 00:46:58.030
what is the third sexual revolution then exactly?

939
00:46:58.969 --> 00:47:02.850
Yeah, it's, it's, it's the final implementation of uh

940
00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:05.409
of open mating markets. For the first time in

941
00:47:05.409 --> 00:47:07.610
human history, men and women are free to choose

942
00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:09.290
their own their partners and have the ability to

943
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:11.489
do so on short and long-term markets, that is

944
00:47:11.489 --> 00:47:14.370
for promiscuous sex and pair bonding. No one has

945
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:17.060
ever pulled off that trick before. And we've only,

946
00:47:17.139 --> 00:47:19.409
we've only tried it for 50 years, and these,

947
00:47:19.699 --> 00:47:22.129
these changes, like I mentioned, can take 100 years

948
00:47:22.129 --> 00:47:23.939
or longer so that we haven't found a way

949
00:47:23.939 --> 00:47:27.060
to reconcile this with sufficient reproduction isn't surprising, but

950
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.139
it is an existential threat. So that is what

951
00:47:29.139 --> 00:47:31.580
happened with the third sexual revolution. What we tried

952
00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:33.739
to do with the second sexual revolution, we were

953
00:47:33.739 --> 00:47:36.540
not able to do due to the contraceptive pill

954
00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.540
and post World War II prosperity. So that Western

955
00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:42.610
individual that was freed with the first sexual revolution.

956
00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:44.919
And try to grab control of their pair of

957
00:47:44.929 --> 00:47:48.520
of their mating with the second sexual revolution, finally

958
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:52.090
succeeded around 1968, and that is the unique world

959
00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.179
we now live in. Mhm.

960
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:58.510
So you mentioned confluent love, but there's also another

961
00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.310
type of love that you mentioned in the book

962
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:03.669
that is queer love. What, what is it and

963
00:48:03.669 --> 00:48:04.939
why does it matter?

964
00:48:05.629 --> 00:48:09.550
Oh, it doesn't necessarily matter, but it's, it may

965
00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:11.550
matter and it may serve a function as those

966
00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:14.870
cultural dissolvans that I've talked about before. So we

967
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:19.580
now have confluent love. And confluent love is not

968
00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:24.929
working, we're not reproducing. Uh, And we need to

969
00:48:24.929 --> 00:48:27.649
open up for a new ideology of love that

970
00:48:27.649 --> 00:48:30.929
in the future will motivate us to uh to

971
00:48:30.929 --> 00:48:35.209
uh to reproduce, and queer love has the potential

972
00:48:35.209 --> 00:48:38.040
to have the same function as liberty and love.

973
00:48:38.739 --> 00:48:41.639
And and Corky loved it before, so Queer Love.

974
00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:47.350
It's a non non, uh, oh, I forgot those

975
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:50.310
words, non-hetero, uh, oh, it's been too long since

976
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:53.939
I was at UCLA. What's it, what what what

977
00:48:53.939 --> 00:48:57.840
do you call it when something is heterosexual, hetero

978
00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:02.300
heteronormative, yeah, non-heteronormative love. I need to, yeah, it's,

979
00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.139
uh, you need to not forget all those words.

980
00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:08.790
Uh, SO it's a non-heteronormative approach to mating. It's

981
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:12.110
a critique of how today's mating regimes work and

982
00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:14.629
how commercialized they are and how they have similar

983
00:49:14.629 --> 00:49:17.830
dynamics as neoliberalism. So it's a, yeah, it's it's

984
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:21.500
a queer critique of the bad aspects of today

985
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.330
regime. And you can't build a social order on

986
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:28.409
queer love. You can't, uh, you can't build a

987
00:49:28.409 --> 00:49:31.409
society on criticism alone, so queer love is nothing

988
00:49:31.409 --> 00:49:33.649
to offer in terms of how you should build

989
00:49:33.649 --> 00:49:36.090
your society, just like liberty and Love and Quarter

990
00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:38.919
Love didn't have that. But it has the potential

991
00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:43.330
to help unravel the current ideology so that we

992
00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:45.770
make room for a new ideology of love in

993
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:46.439
the future.

994
00:49:47.979 --> 00:49:52.860
Mhm. So before we get more into, uh, what

995
00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:56.659
characterizes our current situation, let me just ask you

996
00:49:56.659 --> 00:50:00.100
now that we've gone through all of this history

997
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:03.340
of different kinds of love, etc. Uh, LET me

998
00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.905
ask you, however, Marriage patterns changed across history because

999
00:50:07.905 --> 00:50:10.185
in the book you talk about a global marriage

1000
00:50:10.185 --> 00:50:14.705
pattern, a European marriage pattern, a modern marriage pattern,

1001
00:50:14.715 --> 00:50:18.485
and then also a post-modern marriage pattern. So tell

1002
00:50:18.485 --> 00:50:19.705
us about all of those.

1003
00:50:20.239 --> 00:50:22.979
Yeah, so, uh, before the first sexual revolution at

1004
00:50:22.979 --> 00:50:25.580
the global marriage pattern. So you had those, those,

1005
00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:28.310
uh, child, if you lived in kin groups, there's

1006
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:31.110
kin land there, there's, there's houses, there's, there's farms,

1007
00:50:31.149 --> 00:50:33.500
if, if you're, if you have enough status, so

1008
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:36.510
you can marry marry in your teens or or

1009
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:39.830
maybe so the Vikings, uh, girls were typically engaged

1010
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:41.310
when they were 13 and then married when they

1011
00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:44.699
were 16. Uh, THE global marriage pattern was more

1012
00:50:44.699 --> 00:50:46.629
that a man and woman married around 20 and

1013
00:50:46.629 --> 00:50:48.709
then moved in with his family or or his

1014
00:50:48.709 --> 00:50:50.659
in his skin group. And that allows you to

1015
00:50:50.659 --> 00:50:52.620
start reproduction right away. You have the fields there,

1016
00:50:52.659 --> 00:50:54.010
you have the house there, you have the support

1017
00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:56.419
of a huge kid network, so you just start

1018
00:50:56.419 --> 00:50:59.820
popping out babies. Um, AND because you want your

1019
00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.689
kin group to grow big and strong. So if,

1020
00:51:01.699 --> 00:51:03.580
if you're able to expand your kin group and

1021
00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:05.659
acquire enough calories and just popping out a lot

1022
00:51:05.659 --> 00:51:07.330
of babies, if you can keep them alive, it's

1023
00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:10.850
a good strategy. Um, WITH the first sexual revolution

1024
00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:14.959
when we didn't, uh, This all the kin groups

1025
00:51:14.959 --> 00:51:16.800
and and moved into nuclear families when you were

1026
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.679
young, you couldn't just marry when you were 20

1027
00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.639
start popping out babies, uh because the banks at

1028
00:51:21.639 --> 00:51:24.199
the time didn't give out loans like that, and

1029
00:51:24.199 --> 00:51:26.439
there were no banks, at least not at least

1030
00:51:26.439 --> 00:51:29.800
it wasn't common. So, uh, you had to, you

1031
00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.199
had to work and start accumulating researchers, resources and

1032
00:51:33.199 --> 00:51:35.159
this pushed the marriage age up to the late

1033
00:51:35.159 --> 00:51:37.679
twenties, which shortened the reproductive window as I mentioned

1034
00:51:37.679 --> 00:51:40.199
earlier, and this is the European marriage pattern. And

1035
00:51:40.199 --> 00:51:44.790
the reason why this was necessary. Is because Christians

1036
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:48.149
don't want to kill babies. Infanticide was prohibited. In

1037
00:51:48.149 --> 00:51:51.600
Christianity, the individual is sacred, so when the baby

1038
00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.110
is born, you don't kill it. That's why Christians

1039
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.790
often are against abortion as well. What we had

1040
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.669
done all through our agricultural phase is that we

1041
00:51:59.669 --> 00:52:02.389
need to reconcile the number of mouths we have

1042
00:52:02.389 --> 00:52:05.949
to feed with the number of available calories. So

1043
00:52:05.949 --> 00:52:08.429
what what the patriarch of the king group typically

1044
00:52:08.429 --> 00:52:10.189
did when a child was born was to lift

1045
00:52:10.189 --> 00:52:12.959
it up, have a look at it. And decide

1046
00:52:12.959 --> 00:52:14.360
whether it got to live or what it would

1047
00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.600
put up into the forest or I don't know,

1048
00:52:16.679 --> 00:52:18.760
they they probably had many different ways of killing

1049
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.879
babies back then. So that was a way of

1050
00:52:20.879 --> 00:52:24.600
keeping uh keeping your population number where it needed

1051
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.870
to be. Uh, THE Christian strict sex morals, uh,

1052
00:52:28.879 --> 00:52:30.840
originated from the fact that if you're not gonna

1053
00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.199
kill babies, you need to make fewer of them.

1054
00:52:33.659 --> 00:52:36.520
So, by pushing the marriage age up to the

1055
00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.120
late twenties, we didn't need to kill babies anymore

1056
00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.840
because women had a shorter reproductive window, and this

1057
00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.790
became the European marriage pattern. Uh, AND one of

1058
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:47.870
the consequences of the infanticides of antiquity was that

1059
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:49.929
um they, they had a tendency to, to kill

1060
00:52:49.929 --> 00:52:52.110
off a lot more uh female babies than male

1061
00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:54.510
babies because female babies grow up to create babies

1062
00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:56.510
of their own. So that's really the population that

1063
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:58.899
you keep in check. So there was a, uh,

1064
00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:01.830
it seems like throughout our agricultural period, or at

1065
00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:05.469
least antiquity, there was a a majority of men

1066
00:53:05.469 --> 00:53:10.389
in most environments which Exacerbated the problems of polygyny

1067
00:53:10.389 --> 00:53:12.729
and the young male syndrome is just there just

1068
00:53:12.729 --> 00:53:15.729
weren't women enough women for men. Uh, SO with

1069
00:53:15.729 --> 00:53:19.449
this new system, this European marriage pattern, shorter reproductive

1070
00:53:19.449 --> 00:53:22.280
window, uh, uh, and more even distribution of women,

1071
00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:26.340
and this lasted until 1750 when the modern marriage

1072
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:29.449
pattern came, um, as a result of this transition

1073
00:53:29.449 --> 00:53:31.590
to liberty and a romantic love, and that just,

1074
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:37.139
um. POPULATION numbers at that time just skyrocketed uh

1075
00:53:37.139 --> 00:53:40.899
through, but luckily this, this European marriage pattern almost

1076
00:53:40.899 --> 00:53:45.989
burst. Um, IN the 1500s, uh, because the Black

1077
00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:49.350
Death, after Black Death around 1350, uh, we lost

1078
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:51.669
about half of our populations, so we could afford

1079
00:53:51.669 --> 00:53:54.310
to be a lot more promiscuous. It's, it's, it's

1080
00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:57.110
referred to as the sexual laxness of the 15th

1081
00:53:57.110 --> 00:54:00.270
century. People were sleeping around a lot more. And

1082
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:03.469
then when populations recovered around 1500 and we had

1083
00:54:03.469 --> 00:54:05.899
this really strong population, well, that's when Puritanism came

1084
00:54:05.899 --> 00:54:08.629
to make us. Make us uh to to have

1085
00:54:08.629 --> 00:54:12.189
stricter sexual morals to prevent, uh, overpopulation and and

1086
00:54:12.189 --> 00:54:15.350
hunger. And then, but with the when it finally

1087
00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:18.629
burst around 1750, fortunately, we then entered into the

1088
00:54:18.629 --> 00:54:22.110
industrial revolutions and we could offload large parts of

1089
00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:25.139
our populations into the colonies, for instance, in America,

1090
00:54:25.429 --> 00:54:27.949
and that prevented that enormous catastrophe that would have

1091
00:54:27.949 --> 00:54:30.350
happened, uh, if we did not have the industrial

1092
00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:34.899
revolutions and the ability to emigrate uh. Uh, AFTER

1093
00:54:34.899 --> 00:54:38.879
the European marriage pattern, uh, disintegrated. So that modern

1094
00:54:38.879 --> 00:54:42.020
marriage pattern, uh, lasted until 1968, and then after

1095
00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.510
that as the postmodern marriage pattern with, uh, with,

1096
00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:48.199
uh, much less marriage, uh, a lot more divorce,

1097
00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:48.600
etc.

1098
00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:53.929
So tell us now about the statistics and numbers

1099
00:54:53.929 --> 00:54:57.530
that you think best illustrate the problems with modern

1100
00:54:57.530 --> 00:55:01.889
mating, particularly when it comes to single them sexual

1101
00:55:01.889 --> 00:55:04.969
inactivity and dropping fertility rates.

1102
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:07.729
Yeah. So, uh, let's first go back to where

1103
00:55:07.729 --> 00:55:09.820
we started to understand the difference between male and

1104
00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:13.229
female mating psychology. So, uh, when it comes to

1105
00:55:13.229 --> 00:55:16.090
our original promiscuous attraction system, uh, that is very

1106
00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:21.350
different for men and women, uh, because Women, um,

1107
00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.879
women are drawn promiscuously primarily to the very most

1108
00:55:25.879 --> 00:55:28.530
attractive men, because that's what's function that was what

1109
00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:31.840
that's what's functional in promiscuous regimes. Men only contribute

1110
00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.550
with genes while women are stuck with the pregnancy

1111
00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:37.080
and the offspring, so they're naturally gonna go for

1112
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:41.010
the very best genes. Our while men, of course,

1113
00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:44.659
are a lot more generous, uh, men can have

1114
00:55:44.659 --> 00:55:46.270
they can leave as many off as they want

1115
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:48.419
if they're just contributing with sperm, why not just

1116
00:55:48.419 --> 00:55:50.260
have sex with everybody and see how many kids

1117
00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:52.659
grow up? That's what's gonna, that's what gonna maximize

1118
00:55:52.659 --> 00:55:55.600
your genetic legacy. So men are very. Promiscuous and

1119
00:55:55.639 --> 00:55:59.050
and women are very discriminatory through their promiscuous attraction

1120
00:55:59.050 --> 00:56:01.129
system. Well, when it comes to the pair bonding

1121
00:56:01.129 --> 00:56:03.639
attraction system, men and women are more similar. We

1122
00:56:03.639 --> 00:56:06.489
made assortatively, especially in a monogamous regime, we find

1123
00:56:06.489 --> 00:56:08.770
someone with a similar mate values we have and

1124
00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:11.540
we pair bond with them. So what has happened

1125
00:56:12.149 --> 00:56:15.489
after the 3rd sexual revolution with free markets is

1126
00:56:15.489 --> 00:56:18.870
that we see an increasing number of mating opportunities

1127
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:21.800
being channeled to the very most attractive men, and,

1128
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:23.870
and we see an acceleration of this in the

1129
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:27.830
present century. Um, THAT is because, because of these

1130
00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:31.389
differences, uh, and there's another aspect too, which is

1131
00:56:31.389 --> 00:56:34.310
this what I mentioned earlier, the difference in desire

1132
00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:36.669
for partner variety again because men can live a

1133
00:56:36.669 --> 00:56:39.030
great genetic legacy while women can only be pregnant.

1134
00:56:39.679 --> 00:56:44.070
One Once, once at a time, uh, men are

1135
00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:46.389
incentivized. They want many sex partners and women want

1136
00:56:46.389 --> 00:56:49.070
few, and that creates, uh, that gives women market

1137
00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:52.350
power. There's a much higher demand for female sexuality

1138
00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:55.110
than there's a supply. That's why women have the

1139
00:56:55.110 --> 00:56:58.020
power on the short term mating market. But because

1140
00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:00.340
men and women made assortatively when they pair bond,

1141
00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:02.310
women do not have the power on the long

1142
00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:04.739
term market. There it's more even. So we have

1143
00:57:04.739 --> 00:57:07.860
to understand those differences. It's that women are drawn

1144
00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.979
much more strongly to the most attractive men, and

1145
00:57:10.979 --> 00:57:13.419
they have the market power. That is what creates

1146
00:57:13.419 --> 00:57:16.260
this this difference. So we had before the first

1147
00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.709
sexual revolution, we also had a um. A very

1148
00:57:19.969 --> 00:57:24.129
uh uh in egalitarian distribution of mating opportunities, but

1149
00:57:24.129 --> 00:57:27.090
that was based on patriarchal status games. So the

1150
00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:29.889
most powerful men, they would hoard a lot of

1151
00:57:29.889 --> 00:57:32.929
women, while the men with the lowest status got

1152
00:57:32.929 --> 00:57:37.050
none. Today you see a similar uh distribution of

1153
00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:39.770
women, but based on women's own mate preferences. So

1154
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:42.050
now it's not necessarily, it's not so much, it's

1155
00:57:42.050 --> 00:57:47.080
less about patriarchal status, it's about uh being found

1156
00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.169
attractive by women. They are in charge now. They

1157
00:57:49.169 --> 00:57:52.929
have for the first time women have taken the

1158
00:57:52.929 --> 00:57:56.290
power over mating. That women in most other species

1159
00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:59.159
have always had. Melaoaposulu, a, a colleague of mine,

1160
00:57:59.239 --> 00:58:01.639
he, he has expressed this that we were the

1161
00:58:01.639 --> 00:58:05.239
only species on the planet where males selected other

1162
00:58:05.239 --> 00:58:08.000
males for reproduction. Now we're in a situation where

1163
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.199
women finally have the power to do what they

1164
00:58:10.199 --> 00:58:13.439
have in other uh species because those patriarchal power

1165
00:58:13.439 --> 00:58:15.159
structures have been so diminished.

1166
00:58:16.959 --> 00:58:19.159
Uh, YES, but, uh, uh, I mean, I asked

1167
00:58:19.159 --> 00:58:20.909
you about numbers,

1168
00:58:22.399 --> 00:58:24.280
so, so we're getting to that. So what we

1169
00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.879
see with the numbers there is that when women

1170
00:58:26.879 --> 00:58:28.719
are free to choose their own partners and they

1171
00:58:28.719 --> 00:58:32.199
do so, especially through modern technologies like screens instead

1172
00:58:32.199 --> 00:58:35.879
of face to face, an extraordinary amount of attention

1173
00:58:35.879 --> 00:58:38.699
befalls the very most attractive men. So when you

1174
00:58:38.699 --> 00:58:42.459
look at at Tinder. It started out, uh, 10

1175
00:58:42.459 --> 00:58:45.260
years ago. It seemed like then it was this

1176
00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:48.830
distribution that you would expect that maybe, um, the

1177
00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:51.370
top 20% of men got most of the attention,

1178
00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:54.739
but it seems that women are becoming more and

1179
00:58:54.739 --> 00:58:57.979
more critical that in in the beginning they swiped,

1180
00:58:58.139 --> 00:59:01.860
uh, they swiped they were 3 times as discriminatory

1181
00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:03.820
as men on Tinder. Now they're 10 times as

1182
00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:08.659
discriminatory. And the dynamics there is probably that women

1183
00:59:08.659 --> 00:59:11.780
have a an insufficient understanding of how these markets

1184
00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:14.540
work, and they did not involve in environments where

1185
00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:16.620
they had to choose their own partners. So naturally

1186
00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.530
when they're empowered to pick the very best men

1187
00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:21.580
and go on date them and have sex with

1188
00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:24.500
them, um, it's going to be very difficult to

1189
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.419
pair on. I can give you some numbers in

1190
00:59:26.419 --> 00:59:29.020
terms of the filtration the average woman subjects men

1191
00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:31.979
to on Tinder. So the first thing the average

1192
00:59:31.979 --> 00:59:34.939
woman does on Tinder is to delete 95% of

1193
00:59:34.939 --> 00:59:37.899
men of her pool of potential candidates. So if

1194
00:59:37.899 --> 00:59:41.139
a woman, her partner values in the 50th percentile,

1195
00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:45.050
then 95% of the men she finds least attractive

1196
00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:48.199
are just immediately deleted. And then in the next

1197
00:59:48.199 --> 00:59:50.330
step before she meets any of them, she subjects

1198
00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:53.959
them to another filtration of 98% that are gone.

1199
00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.409
And then of those she meets before she affords

1200
00:59:56.409 --> 01:00:01.040
mating opportunity, she deletes another 80%. So for a

1201
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.000
man to go through that filtration of 95%, then

1202
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.800
98%, and then 80%, you have to be pretty

1203
01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.479
good. So the chance that an average woman after

1204
01:00:10.479 --> 01:00:13.000
subjecting men to that filtration before she sects them,

1205
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.239
will be able to have that man want to

1206
01:00:15.239 --> 01:00:18.050
be your boyfriend, it's just very small. So we

1207
01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:20.169
see that in the pop culture, how women describe

1208
01:00:20.169 --> 01:00:23.159
this, people who work in in like uh columns

1209
01:00:23.159 --> 01:00:26.129
in women's magazines, uh, they also express this, you

1210
01:00:26.129 --> 01:00:29.969
see this in the numbers, uh, and I analyzed

1211
01:00:29.969 --> 01:00:34.169
an excellent, um, Swedish novel, a very interesting Swedish

1212
01:00:34.169 --> 01:00:36.800
novel, at least, where a woman writes about her

1213
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.889
experience with it. So she, in her early 30s,

1214
01:00:38.929 --> 01:00:40.810
she decides to get a boyfriend and therefore go

1215
01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:43.540
on Tinder and she thinks after like 456 dates,

1216
01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:46.360
you'll find a partner for life. And then after

1217
01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.850
2 years she's had sex with 50 men and

1218
01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:50.570
not a single one of them asked her for

1219
01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:54.179
a second date. So we've created these dynamics where

1220
01:00:54.179 --> 01:00:57.969
women have an unlimited access to the most attractive

1221
01:00:57.969 --> 01:01:00.649
men for sex and dating, but then they experience

1222
01:01:00.649 --> 01:01:04.030
that it's becoming harder and harder, um. To find

1223
01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:05.959
a man that's willing to be their boyfriend, and

1224
01:01:05.959 --> 01:01:09.229
they don't necessarily understand that this is because they

1225
01:01:09.229 --> 01:01:12.510
subject men to such an extreme filtration that only

1226
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:15.459
very few men get any mating results. So for,

1227
01:01:15.629 --> 01:01:19.050
for the, for the median man on Tinder, some

1228
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.790
studies suggest that he has to work in, work

1229
01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:25.379
through 30,000 profiles before he gets a mating opportunity.

1230
01:01:25.909 --> 01:01:28.939
30,000, that's quite this topic. Do we really want

1231
01:01:28.939 --> 01:01:33.760
uh. Men to spend their lives swiping through Tinder,

1232
01:01:34.129 --> 01:01:35.530
and that's for the media man for half of

1233
01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:37.610
the population, it's even worse. I was interviewed by

1234
01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:40.979
a Norwegian man who's worked himself through hundreds of

1235
01:01:40.979 --> 01:01:44.010
thousands of profiles without luck, and these men simply

1236
01:01:44.010 --> 01:01:46.709
don't understand what they have to do to succeed.

1237
01:01:47.379 --> 01:01:49.489
And the women most of the time don't understand

1238
01:01:49.489 --> 01:01:51.679
what they have to do to find a man

1239
01:01:51.679 --> 01:01:53.969
that's willing to pair bond. So they accuse men

1240
01:01:53.969 --> 01:01:57.860
of being slutty and immature and not up for

1241
01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:01.570
a challenge. Women just don't understand that those men

1242
01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:04.610
that actually make it through those filtrations aren't representative

1243
01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:06.929
of most men. These are just the men that

1244
01:02:06.929 --> 01:02:09.610
have the skills and trait to succeed on this

1245
01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:13.000
modern mating market that is imposing an extreme level

1246
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.459
of competition on men. So, um. It's, it's quite

1247
01:02:18.459 --> 01:02:21.540
interesting, uh, to see how, so these dynamics were

1248
01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:25.139
let loose, particularly with the third sexual revolution, and,

1249
01:02:25.179 --> 01:02:27.530
and you saw then too that a small proportion

1250
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:30.080
of the men. Took most of the mating opportunities.

1251
01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:33.159
It's just that with modern technology, women have become

1252
01:02:33.159 --> 01:02:36.260
so empowered that this, this, this trend is just

1253
01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.850
becoming stronger and stronger, so women feel that they,

1254
01:02:38.909 --> 01:02:41.959
they just get sex while most men feel that

1255
01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:44.439
they don't even get that. So we know from

1256
01:02:44.439 --> 01:02:47.110
before this concept the friend zone, men complain that

1257
01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.959
women don't let them have sex, they get stuck

1258
01:02:48.959 --> 01:02:51.310
in a friend zone. And now women complain that

1259
01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:52.790
they're being put in the fuck zone, that they're

1260
01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:55.709
good enough for sex, but not for relationships. So

1261
01:02:55.709 --> 01:02:59.639
there's this disconnect between the sexes, um, that is

1262
01:02:59.639 --> 01:03:04.270
now causing 11 known study shows that I think

1263
01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:08.830
it was 50% of single men and 65% of

1264
01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:11.550
single women aren't interested in sex or relationships at

1265
01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:14.350
all anymore and other studies have even darker numbers.

1266
01:03:14.429 --> 01:03:17.669
So this they're just a disconnect where uh that

1267
01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:21.330
this is where. Through women channeling so much of

1268
01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:23.330
their dating efforts to the very most attractive men,

1269
01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:27.459
it just makes it. Very unlikely that that will

1270
01:03:27.459 --> 01:03:29.780
result in pair bonding, and, and that is what

1271
01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:32.820
I mentioned. This is what is contributing very strongly

1272
01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:35.219
to this low fertility because if people can't find

1273
01:03:35.219 --> 01:03:37.459
somebody with whom to pair bond, they're also not

1274
01:03:37.459 --> 01:03:39.540
going to be a position where they're comfortable to

1275
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.620
create a child even though single women can have

1276
01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:45.020
children now, at least in Norway, uh, the factor

1277
01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:47.290
that is most important both for men and women,

1278
01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:50.570
uh, for them to make that reproductive decision is

1279
01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:52.020
that they have the right partner.

1280
01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:57.750
Uh, AND how bad are rates of single and

1281
01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:01.959
sexual inactivity, particularly for the younger generations?

1282
01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:05.429
Well, uh, one good study here in Norway showed

1283
01:04:05.429 --> 01:04:07.129
that over the past 40 years, uh, the rate

1284
01:04:07.129 --> 01:04:09.340
of people not in committed relationships have increased from

1285
01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:13.979
23 to 24 to 33%. Uh, SOME American studies

1286
01:04:13.979 --> 01:04:18.389
indicate that sexual activity, uh, is about a third

1287
01:04:18.389 --> 01:04:20.830
of the population for young people, so it in

1288
01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:23.820
that skyrocketed after the introduction of Tinder for men,

1289
01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:26.070
and then in the past few years women have

1290
01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:28.350
joined them there. So it seemed like men first

1291
01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:31.270
when when Tinder came. A lot more men just

1292
01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.120
couldn't get dates and sex because women now had

1293
01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.889
so easy access to the most attractive men, and

1294
01:04:37.889 --> 01:04:41.719
then after spending years of mostly just getting sex

1295
01:04:41.719 --> 01:04:44.520
and not relationships, women have given up too. So

1296
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.399
that seems to be what is happening there that

1297
01:04:46.399 --> 01:04:49.760
dysfunction. And then the question is what in the

1298
01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.159
world can we do with this? It's just, it

1299
01:04:52.159 --> 01:04:57.600
just. We're now catering to people's promiscuous attraction system

1300
01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.600
to a much greater extent, and there we know

1301
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.760
that women's promiscuous attraction system is very discriminatory, but

1302
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.080
it's also strong. We know from a Norwegian study

1303
01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.000
show that when women encounter the very most attractive

1304
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.919
men, they have as strong of a reaction as

1305
01:05:11.919 --> 01:05:15.229
when men encounter the most attractive women. Uh, BUT

1306
01:05:15.229 --> 01:05:18.939
then women are much more active than men are

1307
01:05:18.939 --> 01:05:22.270
in pursuing, uh, those most attractive men. While when

1308
01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:24.669
women meet, uh, average men, they are far less

1309
01:05:24.669 --> 01:05:26.949
attractive than what men are when they meet average

1310
01:05:26.949 --> 01:05:30.310
women. So there's just a disconnect there and with

1311
01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:34.820
computer screens and Tinder. Women are incentivized because there's

1312
01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:38.229
so many men to pick something, uh, uh, uh,

1313
01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:41.100
one factor that they uh filter based on, and

1314
01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:43.939
often that is hotness. And what is really the

1315
01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:47.889
alternative? How can you identify through a screen that

1316
01:05:47.899 --> 01:05:50.100
that man you see has the potential to make

1317
01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.820
you fall in love? It's just the technology is

1318
01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.820
not conducive to that. That is something that happens

1319
01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:57.260
when you meet in real life. And when women

1320
01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.040
channel so many dating opportunities to men that have

1321
01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:01.419
a lot higher partner value than they have, they

1322
01:06:01.419 --> 01:06:03.459
don't meet those men in real life with similar

1323
01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:05.479
partner value that they could have a chance uh

1324
01:06:05.479 --> 01:06:06.300
to fall in love with.

1325
01:06:07.679 --> 01:06:10.510
Right. So, uh, but I mean, what are the

1326
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:13.830
causal factors here? Uh, BECAUSE we've been talking a

1327
01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:17.879
lot about ideologies of love and for the most

1328
01:06:17.879 --> 01:06:20.679
recent times, we talked about confluent love, but I

1329
01:06:20.679 --> 01:06:25.709
was trying to understand whether, um, these ideologies of

1330
01:06:25.709 --> 01:06:29.175
love. ARE the result of other factors that play

1331
01:06:29.175 --> 01:06:32.495
a role in the societies where they, where they

1332
01:06:32.495 --> 01:06:37.695
are dominant or if the ideologies themselves have some

1333
01:06:37.695 --> 01:06:41.614
causal power over how people behave or not, I

1334
01:06:41.614 --> 01:06:43.814
mean, what, what are your ideas

1335
01:06:43.814 --> 01:06:46.965
here? Yeah, so that's the, that's the, that's the

1336
01:06:47.399 --> 01:06:50.800
Complicating part about these big changes. Everything happens at

1337
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.360
once. It's, it's hard to tell what what's cost

1338
01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.850
and what's co-evolving and what's happening. The way I

1339
01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:03.000
conceptualize it. Is that it's very predictable that we're

1340
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.340
not gonna get pair bonding to work now. That

1341
01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.540
love that women evolved for men 4 million years

1342
01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:12.580
ago. Its function was for women to gain access

1343
01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:16.179
to men men's resources because our increasingly needy offspring

1344
01:07:16.179 --> 01:07:19.129
needed it. The love that men of old for

1345
01:07:19.129 --> 01:07:22.860
women had the function. Of allowing men to gain

1346
01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:28.590
access to female sexuality. Women's attraction to men, or

1347
01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:31.870
regular men through this pair bonding attraction system needed

1348
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:34.840
only be strong enough to facilitate sufficient pair bonding

1349
01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.870
and reproduction in very impoverished and dangerous environment. Women

1350
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:41.350
needed men, that's why they were willing to settle

1351
01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:44.459
for them. And generally before the first sexual revolution.

1352
01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:48.330
The men at the bottom were excluded, but after

1353
01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.610
the first of the 3rd sex revolution, women were

1354
01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:52.689
willing to settle for these low value men because

1355
01:07:52.689 --> 01:07:54.689
they needed them. Women don't need that now. They

1356
01:07:54.689 --> 01:07:56.989
have their own jobs and in a country like

1357
01:07:56.989 --> 01:07:59.530
Norway, we have a very strong welfare state that

1358
01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:01.129
also fails the function that men used to do.

1359
01:08:01.189 --> 01:08:03.209
So in Norway, men. Pay more in taxes than

1360
01:08:03.209 --> 01:08:05.570
they get in welfare from the state, while women

1361
01:08:05.570 --> 01:08:08.580
get more than $1.2 million over a lifetime, and

1362
01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.929
then she pays it in taxes. So, uh, women

1363
01:08:11.929 --> 01:08:14.520
don't need men anymore. And what we see across

1364
01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:17.669
the modern world is that when women become equal

1365
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:21.189
or financially independent, they exclude a larger and larger

1366
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:23.640
proportion of men from their potential pools of candidate.

1367
01:08:24.129 --> 01:08:26.410
That's why it's very predictable that in the modern

1368
01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:30.700
environment, whether this is caused by. Ideology or tax

1369
01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:35.339
systems or dating apps, uh, it's just predictable that

1370
01:08:35.339 --> 01:08:37.100
we're not gonna, we're not gonna have the sufficient

1371
01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:41.020
level of pair bonding anymore. Men, men aren't good

1372
01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:44.220
enough in this environment for women, or an increasing

1373
01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.049
number of men aren't considered good enough by women

1374
01:08:47.259 --> 01:08:49.779
to the extent that pair bonding is an unlikely

1375
01:08:49.779 --> 01:08:52.819
outcome. So as societies when we now start to

1376
01:08:52.819 --> 01:08:54.899
think about how we're going to solve this reproductive

1377
01:08:54.899 --> 01:09:00.220
crisis, um. I think we need to bear in

1378
01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:04.779
mind how unlikely it is. That we're gonna get

1379
01:09:04.779 --> 01:09:08.370
enough pair bonding with women being as empowered, uh,

1380
01:09:08.379 --> 01:09:10.500
and free as they are today, and at least

1381
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:13.330
in Scandinavia and in Norway, I would never wanna,

1382
01:09:13.459 --> 01:09:16.259
I would never wanna compromise on women's freedoms and

1383
01:09:16.259 --> 01:09:20.580
economic independence, which is why, um, as we look

1384
01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:22.740
for solutions, we have to think about what we

1385
01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:26.850
have to do to make possible sufficient reproduction without

1386
01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:28.620
the level of pair bonding that we had a

1387
01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.660
few generations ago.

1388
01:09:30.549 --> 01:09:33.899
Mhm. I was wondering, I, I mean, could it

1389
01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:37.299
be the case that, uh, it just so happens

1390
01:09:37.299 --> 01:09:41.740
that in older times, when, when women were more

1391
01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:45.899
dependent on men for financial resources, that they just

1392
01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:49.099
stayed married because they didn't have an alternative. But

1393
01:09:49.099 --> 01:09:51.917
now, I mean, since women can work and they

1394
01:09:51.917 --> 01:09:55.409
earn good salaries and they are able to provide

1395
01:09:55.409 --> 01:09:59.338
for themselves, that perhaps it's easier for them to,

1396
01:09:59.479 --> 01:10:04.219
to just, uh, dump, a boyfriend or divorce a

1397
01:10:04.219 --> 01:10:08.029
husband because they don't need them. Anymore, they are

1398
01:10:08.029 --> 01:10:11.339
not, they are no longer financially dependent on them.

1399
01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:14.390
I mean, could it be that if in earlier

1400
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:18.430
times, uh, uh, they were not as financially dependent,

1401
01:10:18.569 --> 01:10:21.430
they would, uh, we would have seen the same

1402
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:25.709
kind of phenomenon because, I mean, people just get,

1403
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:28.509
uh, just get, uh, I mean, I mean, they,

1404
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:31.990
they, they are no longer interested in keeping uh

1405
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:34.189
relationships where they're not satisfied.

1406
01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.290
Yeah, absolutely, that is absolutely it, but it's actually

1407
01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:41.410
worse than that, uh, because we today have uh

1408
01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:46.129
contraceptives that work really well. So before, uh, even

1409
01:10:46.129 --> 01:10:50.569
if women were disincentivized from being staying in bad

1410
01:10:50.569 --> 01:10:54.649
relationships, or getting in relationships at all, uh, they

1411
01:10:54.649 --> 01:10:56.450
would still be incentivized to have sex with high

1412
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:58.720
value men, and then they would eventually get pregnant,

1413
01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:01.910
uh, and become mothers. Uh, TODAY, we not only

1414
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:04.910
have free women, but we also have prosperity that

1415
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:06.669
makes it easy to be a single woman, and

1416
01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:09.410
we have contraceptive that makes it easy. To be

1417
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:12.250
a childless woman, so those are the factors we

1418
01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:14.129
need to bear in mind, uh, as we move

1419
01:11:14.129 --> 01:11:16.250
forward to try to find solutions for the reproductive

1420
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:19.000
crisis. Yeah, women, that's just, that's just the sad

1421
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.879
fact of it. Men in today's environment, not enough

1422
01:11:21.879 --> 01:11:23.770
men will be good enough for women, and that's

1423
01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:26.609
very predictable. And, and women can have good lives

1424
01:11:26.609 --> 01:11:28.810
as single, and men and women don't need to

1425
01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:31.720
have children. You can have great lives, uh, regardless,

1426
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:34.410
it's just that our societies will disappear and they

1427
01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:37.899
will disappear rather quickly. Uh, IF we don't reproduce,

1428
01:11:38.029 --> 01:11:39.970
uh, sufficiently, if we, if we reproduce at levels

1429
01:11:39.970 --> 01:11:41.910
we are now in Norway with a fertility rate

1430
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:44.350
of 1.4, we'll lose a third of our generational

1431
01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:48.509
size per generation. Uh, BUT leading researchers think these,

1432
01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:50.790
these rates are just gonna keep dropping, that it's,

1433
01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:52.899
we're just circling the drain. If we get down

1434
01:11:52.899 --> 01:11:57.390
to Korea's level of. 0.7 as of killer rate

1435
01:11:57.390 --> 01:12:00.680
we will within three generations have lost 96% of

1436
01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.850
our children. So this is going fast. So if

1437
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:05.520
we want free women to be a thing also

1438
01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.680
in the future, if we want societies with individual

1439
01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:10.560
partner choice, we need to find cultural solution that

1440
01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.080
allows us to reconcile individual partner choice and free

1441
01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.959
women with sufficient reproduction.

1442
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:18.779
So, uh, let me ask you a little bit

1443
01:12:18.779 --> 01:12:21.580
more about the insults, but, uh, just before I

1444
01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.520
ask you the question, I want to ask you,

1445
01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:26.990
that you use another term in the book, you

1446
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:29.819
use the term in syncs. What is that?

1447
01:12:30.509 --> 01:12:32.439
And that is what we talked about earlier, uh,

1448
01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:35.410
involuntary single women. So this, this seems to be

1449
01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:38.569
now the prime mating challenge of women. With Tinder,

1450
01:12:38.609 --> 01:12:41.020
they've they've learned that they have unlimited access to

1451
01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:44.290
dating and sex with men. And then something from

1452
01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:46.450
their perspective often just seems there's something wrong with

1453
01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:49.290
these men because they assume that it's just such

1454
01:12:49.290 --> 01:12:51.410
a small selection of men that they expose themselves

1455
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:53.209
to that they think there's something wrong with men

1456
01:12:53.209 --> 01:12:55.250
in general, because these men don't want to be

1457
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:59.209
their boyfriend. So an involuntary single woman is someone

1458
01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:02.370
with uh practically limited access to sex and dating

1459
01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:06.259
with higher value men, but it is uh. But

1460
01:13:06.259 --> 01:13:09.629
who is unable uh to realize her preference for

1461
01:13:09.629 --> 01:13:11.299
a pair bond. She's not able to find a

1462
01:13:11.299 --> 01:13:15.169
boyfriend, and this seems to be uh the main

1463
01:13:15.169 --> 01:13:17.140
mating challenges of women today, and this is why

1464
01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:19.540
they're not finding a boyfriend or or not in

1465
01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:21.729
time to have the children that they actually want.

1466
01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.479
So men in cells do not get access to

1467
01:13:25.479 --> 01:13:28.629
the short or long term mating market. In syncs,

1468
01:13:28.859 --> 01:13:30.839
uh, so incels are the men with the lowest

1469
01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:32.520
partner value who don't get access to short or

1470
01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.080
short term mating, while in syncts are could be

1471
01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:38.120
women of any partner value, uh, but they get

1472
01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.799
access to the short term market, but not the

1473
01:13:39.799 --> 01:13:40.560
long term market.

1474
01:13:41.419 --> 01:13:45.910
And what about stem cells or female involuntary celibates?

1475
01:13:45.939 --> 01:13:49.259
Is that a phenomenon that you also consider or

1476
01:13:49.259 --> 01:13:52.100
not? Yeah, so, uh, there are men, like we

1477
01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:54.740
mentioned, there's a very high sexual activity among young

1478
01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:58.810
women today also. Uh, AND for many women, they,

1479
01:13:58.890 --> 01:14:01.270
they experience that they don't have access to sex

1480
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.040
because the men that they want to have sex

1481
01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:09.970
with, uh. Do not appear in contexts where women

1482
01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:12.410
would be comfortable having sex with them. But of

1483
01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:14.490
course, as we know from the media now with

1484
01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:17.410
these, these women that are competing, if, if you

1485
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:22.169
want 1000 male sex partners in 12 hours, that

1486
01:14:22.169 --> 01:14:24.810
can be arranged and as, and I mean any

1487
01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:28.160
woman in the world has practical and limited access

1488
01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.770
to sex with men, uh, you just need to

1489
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:33.370
go on Tinder and. And when you get hundreds

1490
01:14:33.370 --> 01:14:36.209
and hundreds of propositions, you just need to to

1491
01:14:36.209 --> 01:14:39.399
accept one of them. So, uh, yeah, some women

1492
01:14:39.399 --> 01:14:42.490
are in celibacy and it's involuntary because they would

1493
01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:44.209
love to have a life where they felt like

1494
01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:46.009
having sex with the men that were available to

1495
01:14:46.009 --> 01:14:49.169
them, um, but they aren't. So for them it's

1496
01:14:49.169 --> 01:14:50.810
a subjective experience, but if you look at the

1497
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:53.810
actual access to sex, yeah, that women do have

1498
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:56.450
unlimited access to sex, while the large majority of

1499
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:59.370
men have have minimal or no access to the

1500
01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:00.250
short term mating market.

1501
01:15:00.899 --> 01:15:03.000
OK, so let me ask you about another kind

1502
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.240
of problem. What are the potential social consequences of

1503
01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.120
a society

1504
01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:08.770
having

1505
01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:12.680
uh a very high rate of uh

1506
01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.209
bachelor's? Yeah, it's, it's, that's very interesting traditionally, that

1507
01:15:17.209 --> 01:15:20.479
was, it could be very detrimental, very destabilizing, uh,

1508
01:15:20.490 --> 01:15:23.229
high crime, high risk, high aggression. Uh, YOU typically

1509
01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:25.490
didn't want that. It's, it's, it's a very civilizing

1510
01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:28.120
fact on men to, uh, push them into marriage.

1511
01:15:28.379 --> 01:15:32.250
Uh, FASCINATINGLY today, the number of bachelors or or

1512
01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:34.910
insults, whatever you wanna call them is super high,

1513
01:15:35.129 --> 01:15:38.319
and yet. Problems are very low. We, we had

1514
01:15:38.319 --> 01:15:42.100
in the 2010s, uh some terrorist attacks that that

1515
01:15:42.109 --> 01:15:44.649
that claimed a few dozen lives, which is tragic,

1516
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:47.250
but in the grand scheme of things it's nothing.

1517
01:15:47.529 --> 01:15:51.859
I mean, Nations aren't being toppled. Uh, YOU don't

1518
01:15:51.859 --> 01:15:55.169
have hordes of men roaming through the countryside, raping

1519
01:15:55.169 --> 01:15:57.060
everyone in sight. I mean, it, it can get

1520
01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:00.060
really bad when you have large numbers of bachelors

1521
01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:03.430
that are being recruited by powerful charismatic men to,

1522
01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:06.819
to, uh, to do their, uh, whatever, whatever costs

1523
01:16:06.819 --> 01:16:08.859
they have they want to send them to. Like

1524
01:16:08.859 --> 01:16:11.100
I said, the Vikings were probably in cells. Boko

1525
01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.009
Haram is a present day example. So, uh, David

1526
01:16:14.009 --> 01:16:18.600
Boston and um. William Costello launched last year what

1527
01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.560
they call the male sedation hypothesis where they asked

1528
01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.810
why aren't all these bachelors causing more troubles, and

1529
01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:28.439
they thought that uh online porn and gaming is

1530
01:16:28.439 --> 01:16:32.799
giving uh men uh a synthetic experience of sexual

1531
01:16:32.799 --> 01:16:36.000
and status satisfaction that is hindering them from causing

1532
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.720
more problems. So porn might be what's uh what's

1533
01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.080
gluing our society together. Uh, THAT'S, that's one aspect

1534
01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.229
of it, another aspect that's that modernity has changed

1535
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:46.470
us so much. I mean, we used to go

1536
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:48.589
around ready to pick up our guns and shoot

1537
01:16:48.589 --> 01:16:50.229
each other in the face at any moment. We

1538
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:52.740
used to be a very violent bunch, and uh

1539
01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:55.910
the last uh the last century has been quite

1540
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:58.430
good to us. We've calmed down a bit. So

1541
01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:01.149
for regular men today to be radicalized to the

1542
01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:03.390
extent that they're just because they're not getting, getting

1543
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:05.870
laid, they're gonna go out and and overthrow the

1544
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:08.709
government. Uh, OUR cultural psychologist has changed so much,

1545
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:11.549
I think that's a factor as well, in addition

1546
01:17:11.549 --> 01:17:14.430
to perhaps, uh, the contribution from gaming and online

1547
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.750
porn.

1548
01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.759
So in the book, you also talk about the

1549
01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:22.879
potential for sexual revolution that you would place in

1550
01:17:22.879 --> 01:17:28.759
the symbolic symbolic year of 2029 in the relatively

1551
01:17:28.759 --> 01:17:31.720
near future. Uh TELL us about that and the

1552
01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.709
roles of artificial intelligence and other kinds of technology

1553
01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:37.439
and what do you call de love.

1554
01:17:39.169 --> 01:17:43.600
Yeah. Yeah, so it's, it's um. It's an interesting

1555
01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.100
coincidence, and this, this, uh, it's probably not coincidental

1556
01:17:48.319 --> 01:17:50.879
that our mating regime is falling apart at the

1557
01:17:50.879 --> 01:17:53.520
same time that our world is falling apart, the

1558
01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:56.799
old world. So we go through intermittently these deep

1559
01:17:56.799 --> 01:17:59.080
cultural changes, what I my next book referred to

1560
01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:02.240
as master narrative transitions, and now we seem to

1561
01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.830
be in the deepest cultural change in human history,

1562
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:08.549
where we're transitioning from humanism to deism in terms

1563
01:18:08.549 --> 01:18:11.950
of master narrative. Uh, THE technologies is the 4th

1564
01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:17.029
industrial revolution like artificial intelligence, automation, biohacking, artificial wounds,

1565
01:18:17.319 --> 01:18:22.669
uh, AI, uh, partner matching. There's, there's so many

1566
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:26.180
technologies coming that has the potential to change how

1567
01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:29.479
we mate, uh, that we need to start thinking

1568
01:18:29.479 --> 01:18:32.319
about the mating regime we will live in within

1569
01:18:32.319 --> 01:18:37.120
a decade or two or more. Um, THERE, that's

1570
01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:40.069
where I introduced the term data is love. Uh,

1571
01:18:40.169 --> 01:18:42.689
WHICH aligns with dataism in terms of uh with

1572
01:18:42.689 --> 01:18:46.410
humanism. The highest authority for truth is human thought

1573
01:18:46.410 --> 01:18:49.080
and emotion. Before that, with theism it was God,

1574
01:18:49.089 --> 01:18:51.850
and before that with animism it was nature. Now

1575
01:18:51.850 --> 01:18:55.290
we're gonna believe in big data algorithms. Um, IF

1576
01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:57.129
we see that our if, if we want to

1577
01:18:57.129 --> 01:18:58.890
hold out or not submit to AI and we

1578
01:18:58.890 --> 01:19:00.270
see that all our friends that are submitting to

1579
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:03.490
AI have spectacularly better lives than we have, we're

1580
01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:04.970
gonna get into that too. We want good lives.

1581
01:19:05.009 --> 01:19:07.759
We want to be in power that way. And

1582
01:19:07.759 --> 01:19:12.560
AI's capability for matching people instead of instead of

1583
01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.830
looking at Tinder who looks hot on a screen,

1584
01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:18.000
you have an artificial intelligence that knows all people

1585
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.720
and knows them better than they know themselves. They

1586
01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.640
can probably match us a lot better than we

1587
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.479
can match ourselves so that our friends can match

1588
01:19:24.479 --> 01:19:27.200
us and they can put us on dates and

1589
01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:30.520
go through processes that will bind us quickly and

1590
01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:35.839
strongly, uh. And also very importantly with automation, we're

1591
01:19:35.839 --> 01:19:38.120
gonna free up our time. We're gonna live in

1592
01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:42.600
societies where likely people would have access to the

1593
01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:45.040
to the goods and services that they desire without

1594
01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.799
having to pay for it, without having to work

1595
01:19:46.799 --> 01:19:49.799
for it. Elon Musk has planned to buy 2040

1596
01:19:49.799 --> 01:19:52.270
to have somewhere between 10 and 30 billion optimist

1597
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:55.910
robots. Uh, THAT'S gonna probably usher in a a

1598
01:19:55.919 --> 01:19:58.120
a future of abundance for us. And then the

1599
01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:02.049
question is, if your material security. IS insured for

1600
01:20:02.049 --> 01:20:04.600
life, and you have all the robot nannies you

1601
01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:08.450
want. How many children would you then have? Uh,

1602
01:20:08.529 --> 01:20:10.729
SO I think we could enter into a golden

1603
01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:13.290
age of mating due to those technologies that are

1604
01:20:13.290 --> 01:20:16.609
coming now, but then my contribution would be to

1605
01:20:16.609 --> 01:20:21.649
say what we talked about recently. That we can't

1606
01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:24.810
necessarily depend on pair bonding. I think that process

1607
01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:27.089
of individualization that we've been on since the first

1608
01:20:27.089 --> 01:20:29.850
sexual revolution will just keep going, and I think

1609
01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:33.990
we further need to individualize reproduction. In the short

1610
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:36.899
term, that means that we have to create societies

1611
01:20:37.549 --> 01:20:41.830
that are so good for young mothers, that women

1612
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:45.830
choose to have 3 children, uh, instead of remaining

1613
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:52.169
single and childless. That would be Free apartments in

1614
01:20:52.169 --> 01:20:55.089
the cities they want to live, create apartment buildings

1615
01:20:55.089 --> 01:20:59.649
with on-site childcare so women can can keep living

1616
01:20:59.649 --> 01:21:01.370
as they did when they were single if they

1617
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:04.250
want to, and there's always someone there to look

1618
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:07.689
after their children if they so please. Um, AND

1619
01:21:07.689 --> 01:21:09.970
then as we transition into this world with more

1620
01:21:09.970 --> 01:21:13.910
information, we need to think then. To use those

1621
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:16.430
resources to make it easier for single women to

1622
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:19.790
have children. And then we expect in the not

1623
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:21.870
too far future that we will also have artificial

1624
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:24.939
wombs that will allow us to extend this privilege

1625
01:21:24.939 --> 01:21:28.069
also to men. So yeah, we're gonna keep being

1626
01:21:28.069 --> 01:21:31.629
couples and reproducing that way. I just don't think

1627
01:21:31.629 --> 01:21:35.109
there's there's our pair bonding, I do not necessarily

1628
01:21:35.109 --> 01:21:37.229
think will improve. I think we will continue on

1629
01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:40.270
this process of individualization. And we need to bear

1630
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:43.870
that in mind, uh, when we create tomorrow societies,

1631
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:47.310
so that we can have sufficient reproduction in a

1632
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:51.600
way that is probably more individualistically oriented than it

1633
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:53.259
has been in human history so far.

1634
01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.160
So one last topic then, we've talked about issues

1635
01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:02.779
regarding single and sexual inactivity in cells and dropping

1636
01:22:02.779 --> 01:22:08.109
fertility rates. Do you have any solutions to these

1637
01:22:08.109 --> 01:22:10.830
issues? I mean, from all, all of what we

1638
01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:15.149
talked about today, do you have any proposals when

1639
01:22:15.149 --> 01:22:18.509
it comes to potential solutions to these problems or

1640
01:22:18.509 --> 01:22:18.890
not?

1641
01:22:19.229 --> 01:22:22.750
Yeah, uh, what we just talked about individualization of

1642
01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:27.439
reproduction. Uh, I think, uh, we're not gonna get

1643
01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:29.729
the single rate down. I think people, I think

1644
01:22:29.729 --> 01:22:32.689
that decoupling that has happened between the sexes would

1645
01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:34.910
just get worse, uh, from what we've had a

1646
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:38.250
pretty strong debate in Norway about these topics the

1647
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:43.049
last half year or so. Uh, THAT devaluation that

1648
01:22:43.049 --> 01:22:46.950
has befallen men through modernity because the empowerment of

1649
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:50.649
women required a marginalization of low value men because

1650
01:22:50.649 --> 01:22:53.569
of that unique system where that was extremely sexual,

1651
01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:57.189
uniquely sexuallyarian, so. Men have lost out. It's, it's

1652
01:22:57.189 --> 01:23:00.950
not what feminists claim that both genders necessarily benefit

1653
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:03.830
from female emancipation. Low value men have been marginalized,

1654
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:06.069
and I see there's no cultural appetite, at least

1655
01:23:06.069 --> 01:23:08.020
in a country like Norway, to do anything about

1656
01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:10.779
that. We're the most feminist country that ever existed,

1657
01:23:11.109 --> 01:23:14.279
and I think that any non-feminist solutions would have

1658
01:23:14.279 --> 01:23:16.509
zero chance of success in or at least a

1659
01:23:16.509 --> 01:23:19.939
very low chance. So I believe that if in

1660
01:23:19.939 --> 01:23:24.379
the short to midterm, a further strengthening of women's

1661
01:23:24.379 --> 01:23:28.560
material uh situation. It's the only way we can

1662
01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:32.330
increase uh fertility rates because women need to feel

1663
01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:35.209
materially secured for life so that they will feel

1664
01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:39.490
comfortable having children. Um, AND I would wish for

1665
01:23:39.490 --> 01:23:41.009
more women to get engaged in this. It's an

1666
01:23:41.009 --> 01:23:43.689
uncomfortable topic for women because they're the ones not

1667
01:23:43.689 --> 01:23:45.529
having children and it feels like if we talk

1668
01:23:45.529 --> 01:23:50.169
about this some uh far right uh political movements

1669
01:23:50.169 --> 01:23:52.129
might want to restrict women's freedom. I think the

1670
01:23:52.129 --> 01:23:54.089
chance of that is very small in Norway, but

1671
01:23:54.089 --> 01:23:56.319
we need to bear that in mind. So, uh.

1672
01:23:58.709 --> 01:24:02.149
Women need to get what they want. What, what

1673
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:05.890
is it required if The way it is today,

1674
01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.790
uh, with reproduction is that to a significant extent,

1675
01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.200
the benefits are socialized and the costs are individualized,

1676
01:24:12.359 --> 01:24:14.720
so those who have the child has to pay

1677
01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.330
most of the cost. But a large extent of

1678
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:19.759
the benefit from that goes to society through that

1679
01:24:20.049 --> 01:24:23.169
child's uh production as an adult and the taxes

1680
01:24:23.169 --> 01:24:27.959
they pay. So if we're gonna further individualize uh

1681
01:24:27.959 --> 01:24:31.790
reproduction. The costs of the child has to a

1682
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:34.950
much greater extent be carried by society. So instead

1683
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:37.350
of having the the parents pay for the child,

1684
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:39.160
society as a whole has to pay. So the

1685
01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:42.959
woman who takes care of these three children, uh,

1686
01:24:43.029 --> 01:24:45.709
she has to, if she doesn't want to work,

1687
01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:48.350
she shouldn't have to. She should get all the

1688
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:52.410
material, uh, all the goods and services that she

1689
01:24:52.410 --> 01:24:56.089
needs for free covered by society. And also if

1690
01:24:56.089 --> 01:24:58.970
women predominantly want want to reproduce with the highest

1691
01:24:58.970 --> 01:25:01.649
value men, we can't impose on those men to

1692
01:25:01.649 --> 01:25:04.370
pay uh paternity contributions to the child because then

1693
01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:06.169
they will be limited with how many children they

1694
01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:08.779
want. So the cost of children will gradually to

1695
01:25:08.779 --> 01:25:11.189
a much greater extent have to be carried by

1696
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:13.990
society if we're going to individualize reproduction, and I

1697
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:16.729
don't see any other alternatives, at least for countries

1698
01:25:16.729 --> 01:25:22.520
like Norway, than to individualize reproduction and to socialize

1699
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:25.839
much more of the costs of reproduction. And then

1700
01:25:25.839 --> 01:25:28.259
other countries will try other methods, and I think

1701
01:25:28.259 --> 01:25:30.930
different countries should build on their unique cultural legacies

1702
01:25:30.930 --> 01:25:33.919
to try many different things to see what works.

1703
01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:36.419
So if the Norwegian method works, then other countries

1704
01:25:36.419 --> 01:25:38.979
can adopt it, and if other countries have methods

1705
01:25:38.979 --> 01:25:41.535
that work better, then then those will be. Preferred

1706
01:25:41.535 --> 01:25:43.524
by other countries and then it will also matter

1707
01:25:43.854 --> 01:25:46.685
what the different cultural regions of the world have.

1708
01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:48.854
I could imagine that some countries would want to

1709
01:25:48.854 --> 01:25:50.814
restrict female freedoms. I don't think that's an option

1710
01:25:50.814 --> 01:25:53.564
in Scandinavia. That's why I think doubling down on

1711
01:25:53.564 --> 01:25:56.825
feminism and strengthening women's position and further marginalizing men

1712
01:25:57.254 --> 01:25:59.694
is the most the approach in the Norwegian context

1713
01:25:59.694 --> 01:26:00.734
most likely to work.

1714
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.040
OK, but then let me just, let me just

1715
01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.319
ask you, I mean, when it comes to fertility

1716
01:26:08.319 --> 01:26:11.720
rates, of course, we know that we have been

1717
01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:15.310
witnessing dropping fertility rates across most of the globe,

1718
01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:19.520
but the global population in general is still going

1719
01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.439
up, and I mean, it will peak at 10

1720
01:26:22.439 --> 01:26:25.879
or 11 billion people. But, uh, so, but since

1721
01:26:25.879 --> 01:26:28.834
it Still going up, couldn't, uh, I mean, would

1722
01:26:28.834 --> 01:26:33.504
you consider perhaps solving some of these issues through

1723
01:26:33.504 --> 01:26:34.625
immigration?

1724
01:26:35.314 --> 01:26:37.915
Yeah, that was, that was plan A. Uh, THAT'S

1725
01:26:37.915 --> 01:26:41.345
what, uh, Western countries did for the past decades.

1726
01:26:42.285 --> 01:26:46.265
Uh, Norway, uh, tripled its immigrant population from, from

1727
01:26:46.265 --> 01:26:48.955
the beginning of the century to 2015. So now

1728
01:26:48.955 --> 01:26:53.169
we have, uh. Is it 15 or 18% immigration.

1729
01:26:54.089 --> 01:26:56.459
Uh THERE are several problems with that. One of

1730
01:26:56.459 --> 01:26:59.500
them is that when immigrants come to Norway, they

1731
01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:03.410
surprisingly quickly adopt our fertility ideals. So we take

1732
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:05.220
people from parts of the world where they have

1733
01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.299
many babies, and they come to Norway and 15

1734
01:27:07.299 --> 01:27:09.259
years later, they have the same number of babies

1735
01:27:09.259 --> 01:27:10.580
as we have, or a little bit more. In

1736
01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:13.890
Denmark, immigrants have fewer babies than the national population,

1737
01:27:14.089 --> 01:27:16.540
so it doesn't get the rate up. It just

1738
01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:18.660
temporarily gives you a few more people to prop

1739
01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:22.899
up the population. Um, WE will rather quickly run

1740
01:27:22.899 --> 01:27:26.339
out of countries that have, uh, uh, uh, above

1741
01:27:26.339 --> 01:27:29.839
replacement level fertility rates. And then the question is,

1742
01:27:29.850 --> 01:27:32.740
is it, is it ethical of us to take

1743
01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:36.330
the populations from other countries just to temporarily prop

1744
01:27:36.330 --> 01:27:39.470
up our population to kick the can down the

1745
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:42.540
road instead of solving our problem? Uh, IT'S, it's

1746
01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.149
not a long term solution, and then you also

1747
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:47.259
have um other aspects that, for instance, in Norway,

1748
01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:50.540
uh, we see that many, many immigrant groups, they're

1749
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:53.100
instead of being a net positive to the economy,

1750
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:56.919
they cost about $2 million over a lifetime. So

1751
01:27:56.919 --> 01:27:59.310
by importing them for labor in the short run,

1752
01:27:59.399 --> 01:28:01.240
we end up in the long run because we're

1753
01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.560
welfare states just to incur enormous costs that uh

1754
01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.810
that that we can't afford. So at least for

1755
01:28:06.819 --> 01:28:10.080
for Western European welfare states, bringing a lot of

1756
01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.790
immigrants in, it's not a long term solution economically,

1757
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.600
and then you also have the, the issues with

1758
01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.839
cultural integration where uh bringing in millions and millions

1759
01:28:18.839 --> 01:28:22.560
of immigrants. We originally thought, especially in Norway, that

1760
01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.560
after they've been here for a few years, we

1761
01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.600
just kind of have to scrape off their brown

1762
01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:29.200
skin, and they would be just like Scandinavians, that

1763
01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.319
their culture didn't matter, that we actually thought that

1764
01:28:32.319 --> 01:28:34.879
everybody deep down inside were social democrats. The West

1765
01:28:34.879 --> 01:28:36.799
used to think that everybody were Western liberals and

1766
01:28:36.799 --> 01:28:39.040
in Scandinavia we thought, well, they're not, they're actually

1767
01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.959
social democrats. You just need a little a little

1768
01:28:40.959 --> 01:28:43.430
bit more time. And now we see that when

1769
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:46.419
we bring large amounts, large numbers of immigrants there,

1770
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:49.310
they don't necessarily want to be Scandinavians. They have

1771
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:51.069
their own values and their own cultures that they

1772
01:28:51.069 --> 01:28:55.259
value naturally and that creates cultural challenges and changes,

1773
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:58.669
uh, that people do not necessarily want. So there

1774
01:28:58.669 --> 01:29:03.790
are many reasons why, uh, just increasing immigration isn't

1775
01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:07.709
a good solution, neither for the recipient countries or

1776
01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:09.470
for those countries that are losing their people.

1777
01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:14.649
OK, so the book is again stories of love

1778
01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:17.560
from Vikings to Tinder, the evolution of modern mating

1779
01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:21.950
ideologies, dating dysfunction and demographic collapse. I'm leaving a

1780
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:24.319
link to it in the description of the interview

1781
01:29:24.319 --> 01:29:26.790
and the meds just before we,

1782
01:29:27.450 --> 01:29:29.410
let me just let me mention one thing. That

1783
01:29:29.410 --> 01:29:32.140
book is open access, so I, I expect you'll

1784
01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:34.370
put the link to Francis and Taylor's website. So

1785
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:36.529
there anybody can go and just download it for

1786
01:29:36.529 --> 01:29:36.770
free.

1787
01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:40.470
Yes, sure. Uh, AND apart from the book, where

1788
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:43.069
can people find you and your work on the

1789
01:29:43.069 --> 01:29:43.390
internet?

1790
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:47.899
Yeah, um, either Google Scholar or Research Gate, just

1791
01:29:47.899 --> 01:29:49.600
look for my name there and, and you see

1792
01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.600
all the article. If you go to Researchgate, I

1793
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.919
mean, a lot of it is open access, but

1794
01:29:52.919 --> 01:29:54.560
if you go to Researchgate and there's anything you

1795
01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:56.160
want to read, you can just push a button

1796
01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.560
there and I can send it to you. That's

1797
01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:59.689
legal. It's, it's a, it's a thing that as

1798
01:29:59.689 --> 01:30:01.879
long as you push a button, then I can

1799
01:30:01.879 --> 01:30:03.520
give it to you for free. So Research Gate

1800
01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.359
is pretty good that way.

1801
01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:08.160
Great. So thank you so much for taking the

1802
01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:09.919
