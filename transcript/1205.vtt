00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.920
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.590
Dissenter, and today I'm here with Jasmine Shrney. She's

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.640
an adult content creator, model, actress, and we're going

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.279
to talk about her career a little bit and

5
00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.549
also sex work more generally. So Jasmine, welcome to

6
00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:18.459
the show. It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.280
Hi, I'm so glad to be here. Thank you

8
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.659
for uh taking the time to interview me today.

9
00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:26.829
OK, so in this series that I'm doing, I

10
00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.620
always start by asking people how they got into

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.360
sex work in this specific case, in your case,

12
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.880
into pornography, but I mean, what led you there

13
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.729
basically, and did you get uh when you started

14
00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:45.639
doing sex work, was it immediately pornography or did

15
00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:48.709
you start with something else first?

16
00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:51.740
Um, MY short answer for how I got into

17
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.840
sex work is I always tell people food got

18
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.520
me here, which then people are very confused, but

19
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.360
I started on, um, Instagram as a foodie or

20
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.580
like food, you know, mini vlogger on Instagram that

21
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.879
led me into modeling, um, and really quickly into

22
00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:11.459
more salacious modeling. I was a nurse for several,

23
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.379
for some time, um. I worked in critical care.

24
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.000
And basically, when I decided I didn't want to

25
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.760
be a nurse anymore, um, I stepped away from

26
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.120
that and I said, OK, well, what else is

27
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.489
there? And because I was already doing lifestyle modeling,

28
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.300
and I really loved influencing one of my friends

29
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.860
was like, hey, I think you're really good at

30
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.099
this. It seems like you love it. Why don't

31
00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.139
you go try that more? Um, AND so I

32
00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:38.419
just kind of started that on the side, and

33
00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:41.370
it just started blooming and blossoming. And before long,

34
00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.500
I, I got a, an offer to do mainstream

35
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.940
porn. I mean, that is like the really long

36
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.540
story condensed, but that is, that is it.

37
00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:53.680
Oh, OK. That that's short and condensed, so let's

38
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.839
unpack it a little bit. So did you like

39
00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:58.779
working as a nurse or I mean, was it,

40
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.120
uh, that was the fact that you didn't like

41
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.069
it one of the reasons why you, uh, decided

42
00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.379
to do something else?

43
00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.750
Um. How about this? I always tell people there

44
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.910
are good things and there are bad things about

45
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.229
literally everything, right? So there were things I loved

46
00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.110
about nursing. I loved some of the people that

47
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.350
I worked with. I have good memories, but a

48
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.429
lot of it, I was miserable. I never really

49
00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:26.789
wanted. TO be a nurse. That's a whole other

50
00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:28.949
story. But I went into nursing because I was

51
00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.429
like, OK, I had a full ride academic scholarship

52
00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.229
to a university. I knew that I could go

53
00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.710
into nursing at the time and come out with

54
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.910
a career. I originally wanted to be a chemical

55
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.070
engineer. Um, I was engaged really young, and my

56
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.589
fiance at the time, basically, you know, the only

57
00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.910
school that had chemical engineering was a bit further

58
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.220
away. And he was like, you know, this would

59
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.509
be the end of our relationship and all these

60
00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:56.979
other things. And now that I'm older, I know

61
00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:58.860
that like true love doesn't ask you to give

62
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.520
up your dreams, uh, to be a chemical engineer

63
00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.899
for your relationship, but at the time, it felt

64
00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:05.779
like what I had to do because that's what

65
00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:07.500
I had someone telling me I had to do

66
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.460
to, you know, be with them. So I was

67
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.240
like, OK, I'll go into this career and eventually

68
00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:15.820
I will figure out what it is that I

69
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.279
want to do. And I was really fucking miserable.

70
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.119
Not to say like I was good at my

71
00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:25.960
job. I, that was fine. Um, BUT I really

72
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.000
just was so miserable. I would come home, I

73
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.039
would sob, and that was even before the pandemic.

74
00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:34.860
There would just be times I would walk right

75
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.070
into like there was a bathroom where we cried,

76
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.830
or at least where I cried. I know I

77
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.820
cried in that bathroom. That was my crying bathroom.

78
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.050
Um. Like, I remember if like a doctor was

79
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.779
looking for someone, they'd be like, well, I haven't

80
00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:48.139
seen so and so. And I was like, well,

81
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.899
she's been in the bathroom for like 5 minutes,

82
00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.339
but I'm pretty sure she's in there taking a

83
00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:55.080
cry break. Like, you know, it was just not

84
00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:57.899
it. There are so many things wrong with healthcare

85
00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:02.139
in this country, um, that it just was not

86
00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:02.619
it.

87
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.320
No, I, uh, definitely hear you because I actually

88
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.539
studied dentistry. I worked as a dentist for 2

89
00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:13.660
years and I was just absolutely miserable, and it

90
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.260
was just a bit later that I started doing

91
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.730
this podcast because I couldn't take it anymore, being,

92
00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:20.880
being a dentist.

93
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.019
Even in dentistry is miserable. Wow, here I was

94
00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:26.665
thinking dentist. WAS seemed like a nice option to

95
00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:27.225
go.

96
00:04:28.024 --> 00:04:30.584
Uh, WELL, I mean, it's probably just because I

97
00:04:30.584 --> 00:04:35.005
don't have the personality, uh, the proper personality traits

98
00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:37.144
to, for being a, a dentist. I, I don't

99
00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:39.265
know, and I'm not interested in that kind of

100
00:04:39.265 --> 00:04:42.065
work. I never was actually, so I guess that

101
00:04:42.065 --> 00:04:45.144
for some people it's great for me, it just

102
00:04:45.144 --> 00:04:45.545
wasn't.

103
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.059
Yeah, and that that's the thing that I say

104
00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:49.739
and that I've kind of told myself is that

105
00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:53.480
like for so much of my life, I did

106
00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:55.859
what I thought I was supposed to do, you

107
00:04:55.859 --> 00:04:58.019
know, I chose a career that I thought I

108
00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:00.260
was supposed to do based off of what everyone

109
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.100
told everyone else told me you should do this.

110
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.100
Hey, go into, hey, you should do this. Hey,

111
00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:05.500
you should do that. Hey, this is what you

112
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.450
do. This is what you don't do. And leaving

113
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.589
nursing, I was finding like, OK, I'm really tired

114
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.510
of living a life that is really just for

115
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.049
all these other people. What does Jasmine want to

116
00:05:18.049 --> 00:05:21.010
do? You know, and that that's a huge thing,

117
00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:23.170
right, because I'm like, hey, you can be a

118
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.429
dentist and you can love that, or you can

119
00:05:25.609 --> 00:05:27.369
be a dentist and not love it. And it's

120
00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:31.000
like, why, why stay somewhere where you're miserable? That

121
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.799
is actually not doing you any justice. It's not

122
00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:35.589
doing anyone any favors.

123
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.510
Yeah, completely agree. I mean, it's very interesting because

124
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.510
most people, I, I mean, I guess most people

125
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.850
have this assumption about sex workers that they're probably

126
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.019
not very intellectually gifted, and they don't have good

127
00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.470
opportunities outside of sex work and so on and

128
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.269
so forth, but actually I'm also doing these conversations

129
00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:04.894
because not only Was I already getting the sense

130
00:06:04.894 --> 00:06:07.714
that it was not exactly like that in at

131
00:06:07.714 --> 00:06:11.515
least in many cases, but actually there's many people

132
00:06:11.515 --> 00:06:15.265
out there that are very intellectually gifted and they

133
00:06:15.265 --> 00:06:19.234
have very good opportunities, very good alternatives if they

134
00:06:19.234 --> 00:06:22.225
want to do other things apart from sex work,

135
00:06:22.274 --> 00:06:25.834
but they just prefer doing this and that's perfectly

136
00:06:25.834 --> 00:06:26.214
fine.

137
00:06:26.714 --> 00:06:29.325
Exactly, that's a huge part of it for sure

138
00:06:29.325 --> 00:06:32.260
and. Like, yeah, there are plenty of people who

139
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.540
are here for survival. And there's, you know, nothing

140
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.459
wrong with that. But I think some, I heard

141
00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:40.299
someone say once, they were like, if you see

142
00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:42.980
someone who has longevity in their career, it's usually

143
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.339
not because they're not a strategic, because, you know,

144
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.179
it's like you have to be the person who's

145
00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:51.220
going. Going to map all these things out and

146
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.980
be like, how do I not burn out? How

147
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.579
do I, how's this sustainable? Like you have to

148
00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:58.579
have those, those wheels turning of like, what am

149
00:06:58.579 --> 00:06:59.929
I doing that's working? What am I doing that's

150
00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:02.339
not working? How do I keep climbing this ladder?

151
00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:05.859
Because there are so many other, you know, smart,

152
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.959
intelligent, talented people out there.

153
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.700
Yeah, and I mean if people think that it's,

154
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:16.269
it's just easy to be an online content creator

155
00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.850
with all the skills that you have to acquire

156
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.109
and being a proper sex performer and so on,

157
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.470
like the kinds of things you do, if they

158
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.750
think those are easy and they don't require any

159
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.910
kind of long term planning or intelligence and so

160
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.269
on, uh, I mean, they're just ignorant,

161
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.470
right? They are, um, and it's sad, it seems

162
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.190
like that's kind of something that I wouldn't say

163
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.179
like. Maybe it sells, right? People get to do

164
00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:44.700
these like viral TikToks and be like, oh, I

165
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.790
took this easy route because you're gonna like you're

166
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.700
you're gonna rage bait people. But and the truth

167
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.619
is, it's like, I work so much all the

168
00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:54.049
time now. Whereas I used to be able to

169
00:07:54.049 --> 00:07:56.339
go do 3 12-hour shifts in the hospital and

170
00:07:56.339 --> 00:07:57.869
be done for the week. Yes, I was burnt

171
00:07:57.869 --> 00:08:00.500
out. I was tired. I was miserable. But that

172
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.519
was it. I got to clock out and leave

173
00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:05.769
the hospital. That was my hands were done. There

174
00:08:05.769 --> 00:08:09.160
was no like, oh, I have to now manage

175
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.239
all these other things. Nope, I'm done. I'm off

176
00:08:11.239 --> 00:08:14.239
the floor. We're, we're finished. Whereas now it is,

177
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:16.079
it's like, OK, I wake up. I'm like, where

178
00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.670
have I posted? Where have I not posted? How

179
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.720
am I promoting myself? Where am I putting my

180
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.339
time and energy? It is so much more behind

181
00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:26.119
the scenes that goes into it, so much more.

182
00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:29.929
OK, but what do you think er got you

183
00:08:29.929 --> 00:08:35.530
interested specifically in doing explicitly sexual content? I mean,

184
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.090
because I, I, I'm, I, while I'm doing these

185
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:43.028
conversations, I'm also trying to understand. Uh, WHAT you

186
00:08:43.028 --> 00:08:47.848
guys think are possibly the traits that, uh, successful,

187
00:08:48.268 --> 00:08:52.948
uh, porn stars or successful, uh, sex worker in

188
00:08:52.948 --> 00:08:57.429
general should have and for them to like what

189
00:08:57.429 --> 00:08:59.468
they're doing. I mean, have you ever thought of

190
00:08:59.468 --> 00:08:59.749
that?

191
00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:04.929
Um, There was a lot of questions in one,

192
00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:07.250
but I'm gonna try to break this down. So

193
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.530
first, what made me choose this path and kind

194
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.530
of go more explicit? Um, BIG question. I have

195
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.979
a big answer for it. I'm gonna try to

196
00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:18.250
make it as like concise so I don't, you

197
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.729
know, bore anyone who's listening. But, um, I mentioned

198
00:09:21.729 --> 00:09:24.450
that when I was, you know, graduating high school,

199
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.969
going into university, I was engaged. I was engaged

200
00:09:26.969 --> 00:09:30.659
very young, um, at the age of 15. I,

201
00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:33.559
my, a lot of or pretty much all of

202
00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:38.119
my like sexual experience in learning about sex was

203
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.260
not healthy. It was very much like it was

204
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.059
in service to someone else. My body wasn't mine.

205
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.260
My pleasure wasn't mine. Um, MY desires weren't really

206
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.559
thought of. It was very this like. Here's what

207
00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:52.679
you're going to do. This is how you do

208
00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:55.359
that, not, hey, what do you like? Hey, what

209
00:09:55.359 --> 00:09:58.919
is this? And so when I got divorced, um,

210
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.679
pretty much as soon as I got out of

211
00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:03.729
nursing school. I was like, you know, I wanted

212
00:10:03.909 --> 00:10:07.619
to take that power back and be able to

213
00:10:07.619 --> 00:10:09.429
think at the top of my mind, what is

214
00:10:09.429 --> 00:10:13.109
it that Jasmine likes? And how do I explore

215
00:10:13.109 --> 00:10:15.150
that? So I started going to classes, I started

216
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.869
looking into BDSM. I went to burlesque shows. I

217
00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:20.270
was friends with, you know, girls who did a

218
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.510
lot of burlesque, um, who had OnlyFans, but I

219
00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:25.440
I knew or felt like I could never be

220
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.200
public about those things, and I could never have

221
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.299
an OnlyFans or do any type of, um, even

222
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.799
suggestive content because in the nursing board, there are

223
00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:37.719
like moral and ethic clauses. Um, I know there's

224
00:10:37.719 --> 00:10:39.270
a lot of people who have argued, they'll go

225
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.960
back and forth with me, and they'll be like,

226
00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:42.760
well, this person's a nurse and they do da

227
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.900
da da. I'm like, that's so great for them.

228
00:10:45.489 --> 00:10:47.330
But please do know that they are running a

229
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.169
risk. Everyone who, you know, you are running a

230
00:10:50.169 --> 00:10:52.169
huge risk and depending on like what state you're

231
00:10:52.169 --> 00:10:53.849
in, or if someone wants to just be like,

232
00:10:53.969 --> 00:10:56.690
hey, I'm gonna report you because this is not,

233
00:10:57.049 --> 00:10:59.640
hey, this is how we as a profession, as

234
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.130
nurses uphold ourselves. And if you are not like

235
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.320
meeting those standards or you're doing something that they're,

236
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:09.409
they can deem as Hey, if that's not how

237
00:11:09.409 --> 00:11:11.820
we want to look, you can be punished for

238
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.489
that. You can be fined for that. They can

239
00:11:13.489 --> 00:11:15.479
take your license away for that. Like there are,

240
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.989
you know, a lot of stipulations around certain professions,

241
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.530
and you know what, they have their boards, they

242
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.570
have their rules and regulations, that is, I guess,

243
00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:28.729
their own right to do that, um, but, you

244
00:11:28.729 --> 00:11:30.919
know, those were, those were things that like we're

245
00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:32.609
building that made me say, hey, I wanna get

246
00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:36.729
into this. Um, WHEN I started modeling more and

247
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.280
I had a food account and then I decided

248
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.750
I was going to make a separate modeling page.

249
00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:43.919
My modeling page took off really quickly. Um, I

250
00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:47.419
had already kind of made like my shtick as

251
00:11:47.419 --> 00:11:51.239
a foodie was that I would do kind of

252
00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:53.760
salacious food things. I would have like food boudoir

253
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.359
shoots, and this was like a growing thing. Um.

254
00:11:57.919 --> 00:12:00.919
It didn't happen overnight, but I really loved that

255
00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:03.880
and like playing into that again, because like, I

256
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.229
wasn't able, like I didn't have a lot of

257
00:12:05.229 --> 00:12:08.760
autonomy over my body and my expression for so

258
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.080
long. And I was told like, hey, you can't

259
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.080
do this, even like, hey, this is what brown

260
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.719
girls do. This is what brown girls don't do.

261
00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:17.510
Like I didn't see a lot of people who

262
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.479
look like me or had my cultural background showing

263
00:12:19.479 --> 00:12:22.739
up in this way. Um. And as I continued

264
00:12:22.739 --> 00:12:25.020
to grow, and as I continued with like my

265
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.539
OnlyFans, there was a point where I was like,

266
00:12:27.599 --> 00:12:32.150
wow, I'm getting a lot of traction. Do I,

267
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.500
like, I remember someone sitting me down. There's another

268
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.460
model in New York. And she said, hey, you

269
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:43.400
are straddling this line of like, only fans, like,

270
00:12:43.739 --> 00:12:46.940
maybe not super explicit model, but like OnlyFans girl

271
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:52.049
model, adult arena, and like mainstream modeling and like

272
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.580
you have, and she was like, you're gonna have

273
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.190
to pick a lane. Like whatever Lane, just like

274
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.179
think about that. And I remember for a few

275
00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:00.190
months I was like, why do I have to

276
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.590
pick Lane? Why can't I be about both? And

277
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.349
yes, there are some girls who are able to

278
00:13:04.349 --> 00:13:08.130
do both, and that's great for them. But truly.

279
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.380
It, it is such a huge divide when you

280
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.679
look at things like brands, like sponsorships, who will,

281
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.580
you know, be your friend on social media, who

282
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.260
will hang out with you, what, what opportunities you

283
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.380
get given or not given. And there was a

284
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.200
summer. I went to uh a local event here

285
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.429
in New Orleans. There was like a motivational speaker,

286
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.070
speaker, life coach that was there, and she had

287
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.200
us do this exercise. And she was like, What

288
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.640
do you want to let go of to bring

289
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.440
something in? She was like, because everything that you

290
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.070
let go of, you're making room for something else.

291
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.400
So I said, I want to let go of

292
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.520
the fear of failure to welcoming growth, whatever that

293
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.440
looked like. Um. And I went on one of

294
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.400
my first collab trips to Los Angeles, and on

295
00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.090
that trip. I met so many people that were

296
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:06.929
living very salacious lives, and they were successful. They

297
00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:11.130
were happy, they had community. And I just thought

298
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.599
to myself, I was like, I could go mainstream

299
00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:17.440
modeling, but are those my people? You know, I,

300
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.010
I'm just like, I'm not really sure that's who

301
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.039
I am. I was like, I think I'm over

302
00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:25.679
here with these people, and that is what I

303
00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:27.640
want to do. And I tell people all the

304
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.119
time that I got here by following what felt

305
00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:33.130
right and good to me. And that's what I

306
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.169
just keep doing. Like, I just keep being like,

307
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:37.880
OK, that feels right for me right now. Um,

308
00:14:37.969 --> 00:14:40.289
AND I, and I knew I was like, OK,

309
00:14:40.489 --> 00:14:41.900
I got to a certain point there where I

310
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.130
was like, if I get the opportunity to shoot

311
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.830
mainstream, I would love to have that that choice.

312
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.929
Um, I was very blessed to have someone who

313
00:14:50.929 --> 00:14:52.640
brought me into that, who sat me down and

314
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.849
was like, this is what this is going to

315
00:14:53.849 --> 00:14:56.489
mean. This will be on the internet forever, because

316
00:14:56.489 --> 00:14:59.929
by this time, like, I didn't show anything new.

317
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.390
On online, right? Like I think I had just

318
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.909
posted like my first topless photo on Twitter. I

319
00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:09.390
was very reserved. And I was like, OK, this

320
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.789
is a huge jump. But I wanted to do

321
00:15:11.789 --> 00:15:15.469
it. And that went like, and when I first

322
00:15:15.469 --> 00:15:16.830
did it, I was like, OK, well, maybe I

323
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.409
shoot this and this is the only thing ever.

324
00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:22.390
Um, AND no one might know. And then that

325
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:27.780
went completely viral. And Um, yeah, changed my life

326
00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.380
forever. I mean, like I said, it's just been

327
00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.140
like this journey of saying yes to things that

328
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.090
felt right and good instead of saying yes to

329
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.270
things that I think I should say yes to.

330
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.679
But when you made that jump, did you feel,

331
00:15:40.099 --> 00:15:44.099
uh, anxious, or did you feel comfortable with it

332
00:15:44.099 --> 00:15:47.700
from the get-go, or is it something that you

333
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.099
had to develop with time?

334
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:57.890
So the first time I thought about posting something

335
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.489
even like sexual or me having sex on the

336
00:16:00.489 --> 00:16:03.530
internet, I remember it was before this like summer

337
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:04.729
trip where I decided I was going to shoot

338
00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:07.049
for a studio, and I paced around in my

339
00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:12.380
house for like 30 minutes. And It was more

340
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.179
so it was that fear of like, what if

341
00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:16.979
I do this? And I make no money from

342
00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:19.739
it. Because that's always an option, right? Like, hey,

343
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.210
because they're like, once you do this, you're not

344
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.940
going back. You're not going back this way. This

345
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.000
is a one-way street. Right now, you're at a

346
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.789
point where you can go back. And once I

347
00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:31.869
realized that the biggest and only fear that was

348
00:16:31.869 --> 00:16:33.630
holding me back was like, what if I do

349
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.869
this and I fail? And I was like, well,

350
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.309
I'm going to fail at it if I don't

351
00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:39.710
do it. And I just had this whole thing

352
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:40.840
where I was like, I'm going to let go

353
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.469
of that fear of failure. Is there anything else?

354
00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:46.400
Oh, nothing else. OK, cool. Let's go. Let's do

355
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.349
it. Um, SO yeah, I mean, after that, not,

356
00:16:50.469 --> 00:16:53.570
not really, there, I think are always going to

357
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:58.030
be hesitations or things of like, oh, what if,

358
00:16:58.109 --> 00:17:00.309
what if that, what if that? And I think

359
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:03.729
another thing of realizing for me, on every decision

360
00:17:03.729 --> 00:17:06.310
that I make in my life, is that if

361
00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.469
I say yes to this, I say no to

362
00:17:08.469 --> 00:17:10.640
other things, whether I know what that that that,

363
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.750
whether I know what I'm saying no to or

364
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.189
not, I'm saying no to a lot of other

365
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:18.079
things. Do I feel good enough in this? Yes,

366
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.729
that I'm accepting this. For that, you know, and

367
00:17:21.729 --> 00:17:24.250
that is where I try to ground myself and,

368
00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:28.118
hey, I say yes to this on Saturday. That

369
00:17:28.118 --> 00:17:29.849
means I can't say yes to anything else on

370
00:17:29.849 --> 00:17:33.650
that time on Saturday, right? Like that, that's where

371
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:34.489
we have to go.

372
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.979
Mhm. Uh, I would like to ask you, how

373
00:17:37.979 --> 00:17:41.000
do you feel about being a female from a

374
00:17:41.219 --> 00:17:46.290
cultural background that is not typically Western in the

375
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:47.459
porn industry?

376
00:17:48.569 --> 00:17:53.260
I mean, I love it here. In short, um,

377
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.430
and I think another thing is there's a lot

378
00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:00.750
more. Diversity in porn than we might realize because

379
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.790
I think that there are, I know at least

380
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.589
a few girls who are from these cultures that

381
00:18:05.589 --> 00:18:09.189
just never talk about it. They just, they don't

382
00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:11.069
talk about their background at all. They might be

383
00:18:11.069 --> 00:18:14.270
Lebanese, they might be, you know, Middle Eastern. They

384
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.709
might, and they just don't bring it up. It's

385
00:18:16.709 --> 00:18:20.324
not a thing. So. So for me, especially my

386
00:18:20.324 --> 00:18:24.005
first scene that went viral being Bollywood themed, there

387
00:18:24.005 --> 00:18:26.744
was like no denying it, but I was already

388
00:18:27.084 --> 00:18:32.125
a creator, um, model who was using saris, who

389
00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:35.604
was using, really stepping into my culture in that

390
00:18:35.604 --> 00:18:39.785
way. And as I said before, growing up, and

391
00:18:39.854 --> 00:18:42.685
just being different or stepping out of some of

392
00:18:42.685 --> 00:18:45.000
these things, I was like, I never felt like

393
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.180
I saw myself represented anywhere. I never felt like

394
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.439
if I was going to a rave or something

395
00:18:49.439 --> 00:18:51.599
that I looked around, I saw anyone who looked

396
00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:55.280
like me. Um, BUT once I started modeling and

397
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.520
leaning into that and saying, hey, this is me,

398
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.380
I started finding so many other people like me

399
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.349
and really feeling a lot more grounded in that.

400
00:19:05.819 --> 00:19:09.420
I get to be who I am and express

401
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.500
myself in any way, and that does not make

402
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.000
me any less South Asian. I get to be

403
00:19:14.209 --> 00:19:16.959
bisexual and South Asian. I get to be queer

404
00:19:16.959 --> 00:19:18.459
and South Asian. I get to be a sex

405
00:19:18.459 --> 00:19:20.810
worker in South Asian. I get to have fantasies.

406
00:19:20.915 --> 00:19:23.155
And be South Asian. I get to have all

407
00:19:23.155 --> 00:19:26.675
of these complexities in my life and still have

408
00:19:26.675 --> 00:19:29.994
this part of my identity remain intact. And I

409
00:19:29.994 --> 00:19:32.785
think that as a large, there's like, again, this

410
00:19:32.785 --> 00:19:34.714
culture of like, oh, if you're from this place,

411
00:19:34.795 --> 00:19:38.074
you're going to be, you know, you have three

412
00:19:38.074 --> 00:19:39.275
options of what you're going to do with your

413
00:19:39.275 --> 00:19:41.194
life and your education, and you have to live

414
00:19:41.194 --> 00:19:42.675
by this, this and this, and like, what will

415
00:19:42.675 --> 00:19:46.439
people say? And I just have found over and

416
00:19:46.439 --> 00:19:50.579
over again by being who I am, unapologetically showing

417
00:19:50.579 --> 00:19:53.560
up and letting other like it really helps other

418
00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.599
people see that they can do that. When my

419
00:19:56.599 --> 00:19:58.599
scene first came out, I had such a huge

420
00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:03.160
outpour of of beautiful and wonderful people coming to

421
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.040
my pages and being like, wow, I've never seen

422
00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.589
this. Thank you. Um, EVEN one of the last,

423
00:20:09.599 --> 00:20:11.089
like I have A friend who DJs in New

424
00:20:11.089 --> 00:20:13.449
York. She's South Asian. That's like her thing. She

425
00:20:13.449 --> 00:20:15.329
DJs and she says she makes world music and

426
00:20:15.329 --> 00:20:17.930
she truly does. She blends all types of like

427
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.469
brown music together. And so the community really comes

428
00:20:21.469 --> 00:20:25.010
out, but like, leaving her set, someone like stopped

429
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.050
me and was like, hey, I just want to

430
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:29.489
say thank you for everything that you're doing. This

431
00:20:29.489 --> 00:20:33.469
is so important. Like your representation matters. It means

432
00:20:33.469 --> 00:20:37.810
so much to us. And like, that is why

433
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.989
I feel like I shine my light. Even if

434
00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:42.520
it's just for one person out there, that felt

435
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.030
like I did, who felt like you're alone and

436
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.790
you can't be who you are. Um, THAT'S just

437
00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.130
not true. No.

438
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.760
So this is a point that I've had different

439
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.439
opinions on the show already from different people. For

440
00:20:56.439 --> 00:20:59.400
example, in my interview with David Devine, we were

441
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.189
talking about how nowadays compared to, for example, uh

442
00:21:04.189 --> 00:21:07.359
the 80s, the 90s, and even the 2000s, there's

443
00:21:07.359 --> 00:21:10.099
more diversity in the porn industry in terms of

444
00:21:10.239 --> 00:21:13.520
the types of bodies, people from different cultural backgrounds.

445
00:21:13.849 --> 00:21:18.369
Different races, etc. uh, AND, uh, she said, and

446
00:21:18.369 --> 00:21:21.079
I also said that uh we think that's very,

447
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.989
uh, very positive, but, uh, on the other hand,

448
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.810
uh, I mean, I've had Nina Hartley on the

449
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.089
show and she told me because I was convinced

450
00:21:29.089 --> 00:21:31.609
that for example the fact that in the early

451
00:21:31.609 --> 00:21:36.290
2000s the category of MILF came around that that.

452
00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.540
Would contribute to fighting ageism in the porn industry

453
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.180
and also more interracial sex scenes would contribute to

454
00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.420
fighting racism, but actually she told me that she

455
00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.939
thinks that um many of uh lots of that

456
00:21:50.939 --> 00:21:55.859
has actually contributes to fetishization of certain people and

457
00:21:55.859 --> 00:21:58.349
groups of people. So I mean what do you

458
00:21:58.349 --> 00:21:59.140
feel about that?

459
00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.680
I think both can be true, right? I think

460
00:22:02.819 --> 00:22:04.449
all of it can be true. It can be

461
00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:06.699
true that if I show up as I am,

462
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.380
and I do scenes in culture where on my

463
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.979
fan sites or for pro stuff or I just

464
00:22:12.979 --> 00:22:15.020
exist as a brown woman on set that I

465
00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.819
can also increase diversity while fetish like people who

466
00:22:18.819 --> 00:22:21.689
are going to fetishize me, like are gonna come.

467
00:22:21.939 --> 00:22:26.824
That is just the truth. Right? I cannot stop

468
00:22:26.824 --> 00:22:30.145
anyone from fetishizing me. I cannot stop anyone who

469
00:22:30.145 --> 00:22:32.464
wants to take, you know, a clip that I've

470
00:22:32.464 --> 00:22:35.305
posted anywhere and then rebrand it with a gross

471
00:22:35.305 --> 00:22:38.145
raceplay thing. Like that's on them and has actually

472
00:22:38.145 --> 00:22:41.425
nothing to do with me. Um, AND that's how

473
00:22:41.425 --> 00:22:44.505
I have to look at it. Um, I don't,

474
00:22:44.545 --> 00:22:45.944
like, for instance, I'll tell people I'm like, hey,

475
00:22:46.025 --> 00:22:49.375
I don't do raceplay. But like, my identity, I'm

476
00:22:49.375 --> 00:22:53.439
OK with like, Titling something like, hey, I do

477
00:22:53.439 --> 00:22:55.920
hail from Pakistani background. I am South Asian. I

478
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.520
am Punjabi. I'm like, It, it, it, however, people

479
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.829
are going to take that, I'm putting these descriptors

480
00:23:01.829 --> 00:23:05.589
out there, so people who are looking for inclusivity,

481
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.920
inclusivity or people who look like them or people

482
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.280
from their culture can find me, but like you're

483
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.819
also gonna flag and get people who are going

484
00:23:12.819 --> 00:23:15.880
to fetishize you, um, you know, like I said,

485
00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.680
it's just how I, I'm like I exist as

486
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.640
a fetish. That is what it is. I can't,

487
00:23:21.719 --> 00:23:23.459
I can't stop anyone from that.

488
00:23:24.449 --> 00:23:26.449
Well, I mean, there are people I've had at

489
00:23:26.449 --> 00:23:28.530
least Little on the show and she, we were

490
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.930
talking a little bit about objectification, and she told

491
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.650
me, look, I think there's positive ways of being

492
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.670
objectified, so it's not always negative.

493
00:23:38.849 --> 00:23:41.250
Yes, yes, and I think it's a great bit

494
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:42.609
to just be like, OK, well, what if I

495
00:23:42.609 --> 00:23:44.910
want to be objectified? What if I like that?

496
00:23:45.199 --> 00:23:47.359
What if I love the fact that I get

497
00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:50.130
to get naked and fucked on camera or fuck

498
00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.560
myself with the dildo or tease men, degrade men,

499
00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.670
do whatever for money? I love being this. I

500
00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.520
love that I, my job is be pretty. You

501
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.400
know, like, love that.

502
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.130
So, I mean, it, it's certainly the case that

503
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.810
um sex workers in general still have to do

504
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.449
with, uh have to deal with lots of stigma.

505
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.810
Is that something that you've been a victim of

506
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.079
that you've experienced yourself in any way or not?

507
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.280
How so? Explain, like, uh,

508
00:24:24.319 --> 00:24:26.520
I mean, in terms of social stigma, I mean

509
00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.880
the kinds of things that we've already talked about

510
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.479
people having negative opinions of sex workers and thinking

511
00:24:33.479 --> 00:24:36.339
that they are not intelligent, that they are doing

512
00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:39.369
that just for the money, or that, for example,

513
00:24:39.439 --> 00:24:43.400
they are, uh, they have a negative impact on

514
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.079
society in the. Sense that they perhaps contribute to

515
00:24:47.079 --> 00:24:51.199
the sexualization of society or that they ruin marriages

516
00:24:51.199 --> 00:24:52.979
and so on and so forth, you know, that

517
00:24:52.979 --> 00:24:56.199
those kinds of negative attitudes that people have towards

518
00:24:56.199 --> 00:24:57.420
sex workers. You

519
00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:01.099
know, I would say if there's any sex worker

520
00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:02.979
or someone that's in this field that's like, I've

521
00:25:02.979 --> 00:25:05.790
never had anyone comment that, I would say they're

522
00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.060
a liar. Um, I get it all the time.

523
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.339
I get tons of hate messages, people who comment

524
00:25:10.339 --> 00:25:12.719
on my stuff. I have, I used to respond

525
00:25:12.719 --> 00:25:15.959
to them. And like clap back at trolls and

526
00:25:15.959 --> 00:25:20.719
then I realized some really important things like one,

527
00:25:20.839 --> 00:25:22.920
you're going to feed the culture that your page

528
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.280
is going to surround. So if I'm only replying

529
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.420
to all these negative people, then people are going

530
00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.760
to feel more empowered to put hateful things on

531
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.280
my stuff. Um, SO I don't want to give

532
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.479
energy to that. Um, 2, it is not my

533
00:25:35.479 --> 00:25:39.189
job to educate everyone. It is not. If you

534
00:25:39.189 --> 00:25:45.229
for some reason look at porn, pornography, porn actress,

535
00:25:45.239 --> 00:25:48.630
actors, any of this as like, oh, you're ruining

536
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:51.430
society because this is the only thing we have

537
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:55.270
to teach us about sex, um, I think your

538
00:25:55.270 --> 00:26:00.229
vision of this is so skewed because if this

539
00:26:00.229 --> 00:26:03.109
is the only, if it one, you're not gonna

540
00:26:03.109 --> 00:26:07.900
like, who is watching, you know. Uh, A chef

541
00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.209
flipping, like chopping and flipping things to be like,

542
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.050
yeah, that's how I cut stuff, and you're gonna

543
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:14.089
cut a finger off. You're not watching Fast and

544
00:26:14.089 --> 00:26:15.930
the Furious to teach you how to drive. You're

545
00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.890
not doing those things. You look at that and

546
00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:21.510
you say, that's a professional, right? Like it's just

547
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:25.069
what you do versus with sex, and I've, I've,

548
00:26:25.109 --> 00:26:26.939
I've heard people say this, it's like, hey, people

549
00:26:26.939 --> 00:26:28.939
are looking at sex online as like this is

550
00:26:28.939 --> 00:26:30.699
how you're supposed to fuck because they have no

551
00:26:30.699 --> 00:26:33.540
other tools. I think that's a bigger systemic. And

552
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:38.530
like, honestly, global problem of the lack of sexual

553
00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.459
education. So if you feel like it's doing this,

554
00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.540
like I would really love to see those same

555
00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.380
people who are advocating and trying to work so

556
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.339
hard to make laws to ban pornography because it's

557
00:26:49.339 --> 00:26:54.989
like ruining people to Make laws that educate the

558
00:26:54.989 --> 00:26:58.790
youth on what safe sex is, on what practices

559
00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:03.189
are about your bodies, about consents. I think those

560
00:27:03.189 --> 00:27:07.229
are much bigger things because But because we tried

561
00:27:07.229 --> 00:27:10.469
to snuff that out, not me, we, but those

562
00:27:10.469 --> 00:27:14.469
we, um, it's all we're left with, right? I

563
00:27:14.469 --> 00:27:16.910
mean, we're looking at a base problem of a

564
00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.910
lack of education, a lack of people knowing how

565
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.209
to connect with their partners, a lack of people

566
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.949
who don't know how to ask for consent, a

567
00:27:24.949 --> 00:27:29.150
lack of people who just don't understand anything, and

568
00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:33.560
then we're looking. And blaming other people. Why? Like,

569
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:35.530
I didn't tell you not to educate your children

570
00:27:35.949 --> 00:27:38.739
on, you know, internet safety. I didn't teach your

571
00:27:38.739 --> 00:27:42.670
children, you know, abstinence is the only way. I

572
00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:44.420
didn't like, I didn't do that. I didn't do

573
00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.430
literally any of that.

574
00:27:46.699 --> 00:27:50.270
Yeah, for sure, and I mean it's interesting because

575
00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.790
people, whenever they say those kinds of things, they

576
00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:56.170
make those kinds of accusations, always seem to forget

577
00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:59.979
that pornography, first of all is entertainment. It's a

578
00:27:59.979 --> 00:28:03.349
fantasy, right? And second of all, they also don't

579
00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:06.989
know or don't care about the positive impact that

580
00:28:06.989 --> 00:28:09.310
it can have in society. Like for example, there

581
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:14.050
are certain couples that use pornography to, I mean,

582
00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:18.892
improve. Improve their sex life, their relationship actually, and

583
00:28:18.892 --> 00:28:21.833
for example, there's the idea that there's something out

584
00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:24.892
there that we should call porn addiction, but I've

585
00:28:24.892 --> 00:28:27.932
actually have on the show a neuroscientist Nicole P

586
00:28:27.932 --> 00:28:31.363
Prosi. She does work on that and actually what

587
00:28:31.373 --> 00:28:35.192
some people call porn addiction is nothing more than

588
00:28:35.192 --> 00:28:39.093
people from certain religious backgrounds that have certain moral

589
00:28:39.093 --> 00:28:42.875
values. If they watch pornography even. Just a little

590
00:28:42.875 --> 00:28:47.316
bit because they morally condemn it, they identify as

591
00:28:47.316 --> 00:28:50.556
porn addict, addicts, and they feel bad about themselves,

592
00:28:50.666 --> 00:28:53.656
but it's just that, it's just them not having,

593
00:28:54.115 --> 00:28:58.345
um, I guess, a healthy relationship with sex.

594
00:28:58.676 --> 00:29:02.735
Yes, exactly, and that's a huge problem. And again,

595
00:29:02.836 --> 00:29:07.895
people want to vilify people in my fields when

596
00:29:08.276 --> 00:29:11.250
instead of just looking in a mirror. Right, because

597
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.650
that that's much harder. That's so much harder to

598
00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:18.989
say, hey, my beliefs have stifled this so much,

599
00:29:19.329 --> 00:29:21.670
or the way I think everything should be handled

600
00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.609
has actually pushed this down. This like we all

601
00:29:24.609 --> 00:29:27.910
have to be afraid of sex type of mindset

602
00:29:28.689 --> 00:29:31.849
just is archaic. It needs to be done away

603
00:29:31.849 --> 00:29:35.369
with, because you can still say you can have

604
00:29:35.369 --> 00:29:37.810
whatever beliefs you have and still say, I'm going

605
00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:42.869
to educate. On these topics and not just like

606
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.900
the moment you have sex, you're gonna get AIDS

607
00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.390
and die, right? Cause like that's a real thing,

608
00:29:47.459 --> 00:29:51.619
people do that. People will tell, you know, the

609
00:29:51.619 --> 00:29:55.849
youth that, hey, if you masturbate, um, in God's

610
00:29:55.849 --> 00:29:58.819
eyes, you are cheating on your partner and you

611
00:29:58.819 --> 00:30:03.900
are committing a horrible sin and like what? Like

612
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.640
we have bodies and that's OK, you know. We

613
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.920
don't have to put it all in a shame

614
00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.060
box. It's all right.

615
00:30:12.359 --> 00:30:15.670
Yeah, no, no, it's interesting because some of, at

616
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.739
least some of the same people that are against

617
00:30:18.739 --> 00:30:21.160
pornography and sex work are also the ones who

618
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.030
are against sex education. So, I mean, what gives,

619
00:30:25.209 --> 00:30:31.030
you're criticizing people for letting uh minors uh getting,

620
00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:33.744
uh, I mean, learn about. Sex through por through

621
00:30:33.744 --> 00:30:35.704
pornography, but then at the same time you don't

622
00:30:35.704 --> 00:30:38.224
want them to have sex education. So what do

623
00:30:38.224 --> 00:30:40.704
you want them to do, to just uh follow

624
00:30:40.704 --> 00:30:44.984
those silly, uh, arguments put forth by religious people

625
00:30:44.984 --> 00:30:48.265
that you should just abstain from sex? I mean

626
00:30:48.265 --> 00:30:50.165
that's not going to happen, right?

627
00:30:50.175 --> 00:30:52.994
It's not, it's not gonna happen. That that is

628
00:30:52.994 --> 00:30:53.545
just a fact.

629
00:30:54.859 --> 00:30:58.020
Yeah, so what kind of relationship, because of course

630
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.300
you said that you you get some hate messages,

631
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.579
some trolls in your DMs. What, what kind of

632
00:31:04.579 --> 00:31:08.020
relationship do you have with your fans? Is it

633
00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:12.219
mostly positive, mostly negative, or somewhere in between?

634
00:31:12.729 --> 00:31:15.969
I try to keep it very positive. Um, EVERY

635
00:31:15.969 --> 00:31:18.250
now and then I get someone on my fan

636
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.920
sites that I have to say something to. Um,

637
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.229
I try to keep that as a minimum. Um,

638
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.810
I love being what I've had someone call me

639
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:28.920
squishy one time, but squishy, and they're like, you're

640
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.060
really sweet. You're really like caring. Um, I do.

641
00:31:33.739 --> 00:31:35.020
You know, people want to be like, oh my

642
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:37.569
God, you're just selling your soul online on OnlyFans.

643
00:31:37.579 --> 00:31:40.160
I was like I read poetry to my fans.

644
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.650
I like have sent them guided meditations. I give

645
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:48.180
them words of affirmations. I talk about and do

646
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.660
so much more with them. It and it really

647
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.660
can be a choose your own experience, but like,

648
00:31:55.339 --> 00:31:57.689
If someone comes at me or like onto one

649
00:31:57.689 --> 00:31:59.849
of my fan sites to message me something hateful,

650
00:32:00.349 --> 00:32:04.069
they're getting either restricted or blocked immediately depending, you

651
00:32:04.069 --> 00:32:06.229
know, I'm just like, hey, that actually does is

652
00:32:06.229 --> 00:32:09.349
not gonna fly here. Um, I don't do that.

653
00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:13.619
Yeah, and earlier, uh, I was just going to

654
00:32:13.619 --> 00:32:16.900
comment because earlier you mentioned masturbation and it's interesting

655
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.939
because, uh, I mean, people seem, uh at least

656
00:32:19.939 --> 00:32:23.020
certain people seem to think that they can just

657
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:27.250
uh Uh, I, I don't know, put some cultural

658
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:31.290
norms in place to, uh, uh, uh, incent or

659
00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:35.569
to disincentivize people from having sexual pleasure. I mean,

660
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.069
oh, if you masturbate, it's a sin. If you

661
00:32:39.209 --> 00:32:42.849
do oral sex on your partner, it, it's sodomy,

662
00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.520
it's also a sin, and I mean, come on,

663
00:32:45.599 --> 00:32:49.050
are people not allowed to experience sexual pleasure?

664
00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.180
Sometimes that is a belief that is held so

665
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.420
staunchly. Yeah, that they're just like, no, none of

666
00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:00.380
that, no pleasure. And again, it's something that's, I

667
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:04.420
have unlearned, right? Like I, as I mentioned before,

668
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.459
I came from a, a place where I was

669
00:33:06.459 --> 00:33:08.699
like, hey, my sexual pleasure isn't mine. I don't

670
00:33:08.699 --> 00:33:11.890
get to have these nice things. Um, BUT it

671
00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.040
is something that you can unlearn and unlearn safely.

672
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.219
But it is, you know, it can be scary.

673
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:19.510
That's, it's just is what it is.

674
00:33:20.439 --> 00:33:23.959
Um, HAVE you ever thought as to whether you

675
00:33:23.959 --> 00:33:28.959
identify as a feminist at all, or has that

676
00:33:28.959 --> 00:33:31.199
not crossed your mind? I mean, do you identify

677
00:33:31.199 --> 00:33:32.199
as a feminist?

678
00:33:32.599 --> 00:33:35.079
I mean, I, I think I do identify as

679
00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:38.319
a feminist, but I don't see why. I think

680
00:33:38.319 --> 00:33:41.439
some people are when I read the term, what

681
00:33:41.439 --> 00:33:44.859
was it, it was like, um, Oh my God,

682
00:33:44.939 --> 00:33:47.010
I can't remember what the, the, the term that's

683
00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:50.099
like not extreme feminist, but like something, and I'm

684
00:33:50.099 --> 00:33:51.380
like all this means

685
00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.420
radical feminist,

686
00:33:52.579 --> 00:33:54.810
yeah, a radical feminist, but when you look at

687
00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:58.300
like what does radical feminism mean, it's just that

688
00:33:58.619 --> 00:34:03.540
truly like systems are built around men, our masculinity,

689
00:34:03.819 --> 00:34:07.300
and that women aren't treated equally. And I, I

690
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.620
do feel like a vast majority, I mean, there

691
00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:13.179
are a lot of societal gender differences, right? And

692
00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:17.570
I, I hear when there are masks or men

693
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.379
out there who are like, well, we have this,

694
00:34:19.458 --> 00:34:21.458
you're so right. You're so right. There are bad

695
00:34:21.458 --> 00:34:23.659
things for all of us. Um, BUT some of

696
00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:27.260
us didn't have like the right to vote. Some

697
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.050
of us in like the last election. I got

698
00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:35.290
to see a sizable population of people saying they

699
00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:38.310
still wished we didn't have the right to vote.

700
00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:41.840
So, I mean, that's, I would, I would go,

701
00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:44.030
I would start there. I would start there.

702
00:34:45.748 --> 00:34:47.829
You know, it's funny that you mentioned the radical

703
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:50.947
feminists. I mean, I, I'm a feminist. I love

704
00:34:50.947 --> 00:34:53.829
feminist literature and all of that, but the radical

705
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:57.108
feminists, at least some of them, uh, they are

706
00:34:57.108 --> 00:35:00.948
really annoying because the radical feminists include the ones

707
00:35:00.948 --> 00:35:05.329
who are sex negative feminists, and so the ones

708
00:35:05.329 --> 00:35:09.628
who don't include swerves or turfs in feminism for

709
00:35:09.628 --> 00:35:12.989
me. That's for me, absolutely not. Uh, YEAH, sex

710
00:35:12.989 --> 00:35:16.780
worker, exclusive feminist, um. Not, not it for me.

711
00:35:16.899 --> 00:35:19.340
I'm like, you're not a real feminist if you

712
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.340
can't get behind that. I was like, look, my

713
00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.500
version of feminism also says that women can do

714
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.860
whatever they want. It means that if you have

715
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.139
decided that you're a pretty girl and you're like,

716
00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.020
I shouldn't have to clean my car, guess what?

717
00:35:34.379 --> 00:35:36.659
You, you get to have that choice. You get

718
00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:38.459
to have that choice and live whatever life you

719
00:35:38.459 --> 00:35:40.979
want. You want to be a tradwi. My version

720
00:35:40.979 --> 00:35:42.929
of feminism says you get to be a tradwife

721
00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.860
because it's what you want.

722
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.149
No, I agree, and I mean it's, it's interesting

723
00:35:49.149 --> 00:35:51.919
because you were, you are talking there about choice

724
00:35:51.919 --> 00:35:55.679
feminism and some of these radical feminists who are

725
00:35:55.679 --> 00:35:58.959
against sex work, pornography and so on, uh, they

726
00:35:58.959 --> 00:36:03.360
actually argue. In that in their mind there can't

727
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.540
be a woman out there who does sex work

728
00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:11.840
and who's not coerced into it, that women can

729
00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.280
just choose to be sex workers out of their

730
00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.060
own free will, I mean. There must have been

731
00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.639
some sort of coercion or they must live in

732
00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:25.760
some sort of dire financial circumstances that push them

733
00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.320
into sex work or something like that, but they

734
00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.719
just can't make that choice, you know.

735
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.320
You know, we each get to have our own

736
00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.000
views, and I can say that they're wrong. For

737
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.909
me, oh, that's not me. So, you know, and

738
00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:43.580
I understand that they have that. It. I can't,

739
00:36:43.659 --> 00:36:45.750
I can't go around policing their mind and telling

740
00:36:46.479 --> 00:36:48.110
this because they're gonna turn around and be like,

741
00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:50.100
well, you were conditioned X, Y, and Z. Sure,

742
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.260
fair. OK. Um, RIGHT, because they might be like,

743
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.379
oh, well, if you weren't, you know, held to

744
00:36:56.379 --> 00:36:58.139
these standards, then you would never have went here,

745
00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.739
possibly, possibly, but I don't think I ever wanted

746
00:37:01.739 --> 00:37:04.810
to be friends with someone who had views of

747
00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.580
someone else that was less than them. I know

748
00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.899
that much. I don't think I ever would have

749
00:37:07.899 --> 00:37:10.580
been that person, you know.

750
00:37:11.639 --> 00:37:14.239
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a very patronizing

751
00:37:14.239 --> 00:37:17.479
view of adult women, right, because it's as if

752
00:37:17.479 --> 00:37:21.820
they're thinking that adult women do not have sufficient

753
00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.790
agency to make their own free choices,

754
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.320
right? Yes, yes, very much so, and I think

755
00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:34.290
it's. We live in a very special time, but

756
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.689
when I think about it, I'm like, when was

757
00:37:35.689 --> 00:37:38.469
it not a very weird and special time throughout

758
00:37:38.469 --> 00:37:40.479
history? It's always been a weird and special time

759
00:37:40.479 --> 00:37:43.389
and every time he has its own challenges, right?

760
00:37:43.729 --> 00:37:50.510
Cause we have creators, performers, workers like me, who

761
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.459
are very much here for the girls, the girls'

762
00:37:52.459 --> 00:37:54.649
pleasure, but it is this weird thing where it's

763
00:37:54.649 --> 00:37:58.750
like, People view this job as so much for

764
00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:01.389
the male gaze, and it's like, I've gotten really

765
00:38:01.389 --> 00:38:03.260
recently, I'm like, hey, I just want y'all to

766
00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.590
know anytime I'm doing a makeup transition, anytime I'm

767
00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.429
talking to y'all, like this is for the girls.

768
00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.110
I want y'all to know my entire page is

769
00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:13.050
for the girls. Like I'm here for the girls.

770
00:38:13.429 --> 00:38:17.229
And I think that is also something like, for

771
00:38:17.229 --> 00:38:19.429
instance, I had, this is maybe a year or

772
00:38:19.429 --> 00:38:23.830
so ago, uh, a male that was in, he

773
00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:27.229
was in like Not my, like, kind of like

774
00:38:27.229 --> 00:38:30.070
around my social circles. And he sent me a

775
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.510
message. He was like, OK, I've got this great

776
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:33.750
idea. And I was like, OK, shoot. And he

777
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:38.429
explains to me, ethical porn and feminist porn, right?

778
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:39.750
And I was like, because he was like, I

779
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:43.560
have this great idea. And he's like, You know,

780
00:38:43.659 --> 00:38:46.899
a lot of films in your industry, um, they're

781
00:38:46.899 --> 00:38:49.699
not shot, maybe the greatest, um, they have no

782
00:38:49.699 --> 00:38:53.979
real storylines, they have no psycho drama, they're not

783
00:38:53.979 --> 00:38:57.659
showing real pleasure in this, and I think, you

784
00:38:57.659 --> 00:39:01.979
know, Film, like pornographic films done in like a

785
00:39:01.979 --> 00:39:05.500
movie setting, something that's pretty, has a storyline, has

786
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.060
these things, and I was like, you're, I was

787
00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.580
like, great idea, bro. You're literally just describing feminist

788
00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:13.110
porn or ethical porn. And he was like, OK,

789
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.919
yeah, but not something that's just for the female

790
00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:17.179
gaze. I was like, here's the thing. I was

791
00:39:17.179 --> 00:39:19.260
like, anything shot for I was like, it's all

792
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.020
shot for everyone's gaze. Everyone's gonna enjoy it. I

793
00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:25.479
was like, but you're not looking at like, This

794
00:39:25.479 --> 00:39:29.399
portion that's specifically made for men that like a

795
00:39:29.399 --> 00:39:32.000
woman watches that are not every woman, because there's

796
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.709
some that really love it, but a lot of

797
00:39:33.709 --> 00:39:35.000
women look at that and they're like, well, that's

798
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.260
not the type of sex I want to see,

799
00:39:37.719 --> 00:39:39.879
that's not the type of sex I have, that's

800
00:39:39.879 --> 00:39:43.840
not the sex I dream about having. Um, WHEREAS

801
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.060
then you have like this other complete genre and

802
00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:49.149
and way, and we're like, yeah, actually, we really

803
00:39:49.149 --> 00:39:51.760
love that. That feels really good and authentic. And

804
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.429
I think that kind of goes hand in hand

805
00:39:54.429 --> 00:39:56.760
of like, hey, there are people like me, we're

806
00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:00.800
over here making, like, yes, there are performances, but

807
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.159
there are also very authentic. I'm never doing something

808
00:40:04.159 --> 00:40:08.649
I don't want to do. I'm enjoying myself, truly.

809
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.850
I'm having orgasms in my videos. I'm, you know

810
00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:15.479
what I mean? So it's like, hey, we're here,

811
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:17.959
we are enjoying it, um, you know, like I

812
00:40:17.959 --> 00:40:19.409
said, there can be a level of someone being

813
00:40:19.409 --> 00:40:21.050
like, well, you're objectifying yourself. OK, well, what if

814
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:22.719
I find that? What if I like that? What

815
00:40:22.719 --> 00:40:23.290
if I like that?

816
00:40:24.179 --> 00:40:27.050
Yeah. No, you, you know, it's very interesting because,

817
00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:31.860
uh, Pornhub has just recently released their year in

818
00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:38.310
review for 2025, and the idea. Uh, uh, BUT

819
00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:40.139
yeah, but I was going to say, and the

820
00:40:40.139 --> 00:40:44.179
idea that porn, uh, the main, uh, target audience

821
00:40:44.179 --> 00:40:47.840
or the only target audience for porn is men.

822
00:40:48.169 --> 00:40:50.649
Uh, I mean, actually, perhaps that's more of a

823
00:40:50.649 --> 00:40:54.060
cultural thing than a thing than people might think

824
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:59.219
because right now, 38% of users are female, and

825
00:40:59.219 --> 00:41:03.020
the category that grew the most in 2025 was

826
00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.179
lesbian. So

827
00:41:04.179 --> 00:41:07.209
there we go, there we go for the girls,

828
00:41:07.449 --> 00:41:08.360
for the girls.

829
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.840
OK, so, uh, look, I, I was, uh, asking

830
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.760
you about the sort of attitudes that the sex

831
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.780
negative feminists have toward sex work, but of course

832
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:24.040
there's also, there's also sex-posit feminists who support sex

833
00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.760
workers and so on. And, uh, do you agree

834
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.679
with them when they say that sex work can

835
00:41:29.679 --> 00:41:30.719
be empowering?

836
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.919
Yes, I think sex work can be very empowering.

837
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.709
I get to have agency over what I do

838
00:41:36.709 --> 00:41:38.560
with my body. I get to have agency of

839
00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.540
what I do or don't do, how I'm portrayed,

840
00:41:41.949 --> 00:41:44.919
you know, my branding. I, I, I find sex

841
00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:48.040
work very empowering for me. That doesn't mean everybody

842
00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.600
does, but I, I do. And I think that's

843
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.919
a really important, you know, part for me.

844
00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.520
Mhm. So, of course, I, I'm doing this series,

845
00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.949
I've already told you about humanizing sex workers. ER,

846
00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.199
you're going to be featured there, so, uh, what

847
00:42:05.199 --> 00:42:07.840
do you think are perhaps the best ways of

848
00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:12.100
fighting against er social stigma when it comes to

849
00:42:12.239 --> 00:42:14.080
sex work? I mean, what do you think are

850
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.100
the best ways of humanizing sex workers?

851
00:42:17.879 --> 00:42:20.620
I mean, I think the biggest thing is to

852
00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.310
talk to us, to actually look at us, um,

853
00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.600
which can also be hard because there is such

854
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.429
a stigma around porn. I think there are so

855
00:42:29.429 --> 00:42:31.840
many people who are like, you know, you meet

856
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.800
them in real life, they're like, love that, love

857
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.919
that you do that. I can't follow your page.

858
00:42:36.479 --> 00:42:38.520
You know, my dad's gonna see that I follow

859
00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.639
a porn star, or, you know, any of those

860
00:42:41.639 --> 00:42:43.199
things, or my friends are going to see that

861
00:42:43.199 --> 00:42:46.139
I follow you and If I bring it up,

862
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:48.610
if someone's like, oh, X, Y, and Z about

863
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.110
sex workers, and then I chime in with this,

864
00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:53.449
then like they're going to know that I watch,

865
00:42:53.629 --> 00:42:57.870
um, so I don't think, I mean, again, not

866
00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:01.370
that I have. Maybe I don't know, maybe I

867
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.489
don't have all the answers, but I think one

868
00:43:03.489 --> 00:43:07.479
of them lies in, in educating. Ed, you know,

869
00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:12.219
Like just educating people that we are real humans.

870
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.439
Um, AND again, not my job all the time,

871
00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.979
right? Um, AND I think about that sometimes when

872
00:43:17.979 --> 00:43:19.939
I go to respond to people or I've gotten

873
00:43:19.939 --> 00:43:23.379
more into, I had started out doing like a

874
00:43:23.379 --> 00:43:25.500
lot of talking vlogs and I'm getting back into

875
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.580
that, like when I get ready for my social

876
00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:30.060
media, and I'm like, how much of this is

877
00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.659
my job to talk about. Like, do I want

878
00:43:32.659 --> 00:43:35.020
to make this my job to talk about this?

879
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:37.500
Is that gonna be my shtick? What parts, you

880
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.820
know, cause some of it can get heavy, some

881
00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.699
of it can seem one-sided, some of it can

882
00:43:42.699 --> 00:43:45.780
seem misandrus, or like how do you make a

883
00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:51.520
heavy topic, something that's light and fluffy and digestible

884
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:54.540
for people, and I think like that is, you

885
00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.620
know, a thing to just be like, hey, I'm

886
00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:00.229
a normal person. Hi, I have a life. Hi,

887
00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:02.409
I don't, you know, nobody wants to sit here

888
00:44:02.409 --> 00:44:04.590
and see hate comments all the time. Every now

889
00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:06.590
and then I respond to people, and when someone's

890
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:09.020
like, you treated your body, you're a disgrace to

891
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.189
your family, and I'm like, OK, yeah, I'm sure

892
00:44:11.189 --> 00:44:12.870
your mom, as soon as you were born, looked

893
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:16.050
at you and was like, Wow, my pride and

894
00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:18.850
joy. Can't wait until you go and comment on

895
00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:21.689
random women on the internet. That's everything I ever

896
00:44:21.689 --> 00:44:24.159
wanted from you. I'm like, you're not making your

897
00:44:24.159 --> 00:44:27.090
family proud being here, honey, and you follow me.

898
00:44:27.179 --> 00:44:28.929
Like, I don't know who, like you say I'm

899
00:44:28.929 --> 00:44:30.449
in the wrong. I'm telling you right now you're

900
00:44:30.449 --> 00:44:33.129
not making, you're not bringing honor to your family

901
00:44:33.129 --> 00:44:35.590
name right now. It's all I have to say.

902
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:38.969
Um, BUT, but again, that's mean. I don't know

903
00:44:38.969 --> 00:44:40.489
how else to say it. I'm just like, I

904
00:44:40.489 --> 00:44:40.909
don't know.

905
00:44:42.679 --> 00:44:44.949
Uh, YOU know, it, it's actually, I find it

906
00:44:44.949 --> 00:44:48.010
a bit funny when people use terms like, oh,

907
00:44:48.129 --> 00:44:51.169
you're a degenerate, you're a sinner, you're this, you're

908
00:44:51.169 --> 00:44:53.449
that. I mean, come on, what does that mean?

909
00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:57.330
You're just, uh, uh, using your own moral values.

910
00:44:57.409 --> 00:45:00.475
I mean, I don't share your. Moral values. So

911
00:45:00.475 --> 00:45:03.425
why should you call calling me something like that?

912
00:45:03.554 --> 00:45:05.034
Why should that matter to me?

913
00:45:05.195 --> 00:45:09.594
Yes, huge, yeah, yeah, and that's a huge point.

914
00:45:09.715 --> 00:45:12.274
And I'm like, it doesn't really matter. Like you're,

915
00:45:12.354 --> 00:45:15.094
you're not someone of importance to me, so.

916
00:45:16.139 --> 00:45:18.020
Yeah, but at the same time you touched on

917
00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.379
the point there that I think might be relevant

918
00:45:20.379 --> 00:45:22.939
because actually I think that many people out there

919
00:45:22.939 --> 00:45:27.459
are actually afraid of being associated with sex workers

920
00:45:27.459 --> 00:45:29.899
because they think, oh my God, if people know

921
00:45:29.899 --> 00:45:32.554
I'm associated with them in some way, I'm I

922
00:45:32.554 --> 00:45:35.864
might get some of that social discrimination. I might

923
00:45:35.864 --> 00:45:38.465
get some of those, some of that social stigma

924
00:45:38.465 --> 00:45:42.405
associated with them by osmosis or something like that.

925
00:45:42.544 --> 00:45:45.425
But sometimes it does, like, and I know I

926
00:45:45.425 --> 00:45:50.010
mentioned I did food stuff before, um. My food

927
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:54.270
account got hacked really shortly after starting my adult

928
00:45:54.649 --> 00:45:59.889
platforms. Um, BUT I started really quickly realizing that

929
00:45:59.889 --> 00:46:01.530
some of the same people who were inviting me

930
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:03.649
to like, hey, we're throwing a dinner party completely

931
00:46:03.649 --> 00:46:06.850
stopped. Um, I had a friend who was a

932
00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:11.330
director of a local, um, like, food festival, didn't

933
00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:13.699
hear from her, you know. And it was one

934
00:46:13.699 --> 00:46:15.659
of those things that was like, yeah, people were

935
00:46:15.659 --> 00:46:17.540
kind of like, hey, I really can't be seen

936
00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.620
out with you. I can't be associated with you.

937
00:46:19.979 --> 00:46:23.050
You stop getting invited to the restaurants for their

938
00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:26.459
openings. You stop like people, and like there are

939
00:46:26.459 --> 00:46:27.899
people out there who are like, I really don't

940
00:46:27.899 --> 00:46:30.340
care. And there are people out there who really

941
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:34.000
care and act like you, like it's leprosy. Right,

942
00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.360
they're like, oh my God, if I come around

943
00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.709
you, I'm, you know, dirty by some, some mean

944
00:46:39.709 --> 00:46:43.800
or standards, and it is wild to watch those

945
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.080
doors kind of shut in a weird way where

946
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.399
I was like, hey guys, I was the girl

947
00:46:48.399 --> 00:46:50.679
who's putting slices of pizza over my nipples and

948
00:46:50.679 --> 00:46:53.080
taking photos and putting them on Instagram. Like, I

949
00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.600
don't feel like I'm, I don't feel like I

950
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.659
switched up on anyone, you know what I mean?

951
00:46:56.729 --> 00:46:59.979
Like, um, I've been working in handstands in at

952
00:46:59.979 --> 00:47:03.250
like the fine dining restaurant. And y'all were eating

953
00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:07.000
that up. And knew me before, so, but it

954
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.439
is, it's, you know, it is like a, a

955
00:47:09.439 --> 00:47:13.040
weird thing. You just kind of watch people slowly

956
00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.520
cycle out of your life, and part of it

957
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.739
for me is just being like, you know what,

958
00:47:17.949 --> 00:47:20.550
um, again, A, if that's how you were gonna

959
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:22.719
switch up, you're not someone who I really need

960
00:47:22.719 --> 00:47:28.139
in my circle. B, um, You know, I, you

961
00:47:28.139 --> 00:47:29.780
could just, I don't know, people could also just

962
00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.560
be honest. Like you don't have to be here.

963
00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.280
We don't have to be friends. It's OK.

964
00:47:35.649 --> 00:47:38.370
Yeah, and then there's also the hypocrites, right? I

965
00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:41.209
mean, those kinds of people who are always publicly

966
00:47:41.209 --> 00:47:45.090
condemning porn, but then they actually consume it in

967
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:48.209
their private lives, and I mean they're always using

968
00:47:48.209 --> 00:47:51.330
those terms, as I said before, the Jarisin or

969
00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:54.570
so on and so forth. But then actually we

970
00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:57.679
also have data from Pornhub because the red states

971
00:47:57.679 --> 00:47:59.449
in the US are some of the ones who

972
00:47:59.449 --> 00:48:02.840
watch porn the most, so. You know, people that

973
00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:06.290
that are extremely religious seem to be the ones

974
00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:08.600
that also consume the most important.

975
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:12.489
Yes, I remember hearing someone say if you wanted

976
00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:16.840
to make sure that um Your any like your

977
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.840
children turn out to be porn stars, they were

978
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.300
like raise them Mormon. Apparently there's like a huge

979
00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.959
amount. Apparently that's like the Mormon are cult, you

980
00:48:25.959 --> 00:48:30.800
know, to porn pipeline is like crazy. The very

981
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.629
strict household upbringing to porn, it's crazy. It's like

982
00:48:34.629 --> 00:48:38.909
wow. And it's kind of wild how if you

983
00:48:38.909 --> 00:48:42.429
just educated people. We would, we would all be

984
00:48:42.429 --> 00:48:43.770
real chill around here.

985
00:48:44.739 --> 00:48:47.159
Yeah, and as I said before, if they just

986
00:48:47.159 --> 00:48:51.070
have a more healthy relationship with sex, perhaps some

987
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:55.600
of them wouldn't even identify or self-identify as porn

988
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.100
addicts. I mean, you're just watching uh porn, it's

989
00:48:59.100 --> 00:48:59.659
fine, it's

990
00:48:59.659 --> 00:49:02.100
OK. Yeah, and just like you said, people who

991
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.540
are throwing those insults or slurs, it's like a

992
00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.179
lot of times I go to their profile and

993
00:49:07.179 --> 00:49:11.050
they're following me, and I'm like, Yeah. You're like,

994
00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.610
you're disgusting. I hate you, you're scum of the

995
00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:17.899
earth. You should unalive yourself, and I'm like, follow

996
00:49:17.899 --> 00:49:21.629
back, you follow me? Like that's crazy. Like you're

997
00:49:21.629 --> 00:49:24.449
literally just here. To like what I call hate

998
00:49:24.449 --> 00:49:27.719
jerk, I'm like, I'm like they hate jerk. I'm

999
00:49:27.719 --> 00:49:30.520
like, you're they're actually doing that for themselves. I

1000
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.290
was like, what you realize in my, the way

1001
00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:35.750
I view it is I'm like you hate yourself

1002
00:49:36.209 --> 00:49:40.050
and you hate whatever ideologies you're holding that have

1003
00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:42.689
taught you this hate and then you're projecting it

1004
00:49:42.689 --> 00:49:46.270
onto me and like. You know what, that's, that's

1005
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:48.929
their own battles. They're gonna go whack them all

1006
00:49:48.929 --> 00:49:49.750
out with that.

1007
00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.899
No, but that's really rich. So, uh, look, I

1008
00:49:53.899 --> 00:49:57.030
have two more questions. Uh, FIRST of all, um,

1009
00:49:57.379 --> 00:49:59.739
what do, what would you say is the role

1010
00:49:59.739 --> 00:50:02.739
that sex plays in your life? And do you

1011
00:50:02.739 --> 00:50:07.320
think that that perspective changed after you started doing

1012
00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.000
pornography or not?

1013
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:15.989
I think sex has When I got divorced, it

1014
00:50:15.989 --> 00:50:18.850
really, like I said, I really took control over

1015
00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:21.050
my pleasure and saying I want to put this

1016
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:24.949
forefront for me and exploring my body and learning

1017
00:50:24.969 --> 00:50:26.570
how do I go and do X, Y, and

1018
00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:29.050
Z consensually and how do I do this, and

1019
00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:32.370
it's really opened the door to kind of this

1020
00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:35.570
universe that felt so closed off before and not

1021
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.530
for me. Um, IT helps me just get in

1022
00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:41.830
touch with my body. There was a lot of

1023
00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:46.899
Like I think disassociation that I had and I

1024
00:50:46.899 --> 00:50:48.860
think a lot of people experience and one of

1025
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.360
the first places I was able to fully be

1026
00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:56.659
in my body and present was in sex and

1027
00:50:56.659 --> 00:50:59.100
helped me to learn to have a healthier relationship

1028
00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.860
with self, a healthier relationship with my body, with

1029
00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:05.260
my mental health. I think. It also helps me

1030
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:09.379
tap into like creativity and just expression, because if

1031
00:51:09.379 --> 00:51:11.610
you're not, or at least when I'm not afraid

1032
00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:13.820
of my body, I think it's to even just

1033
00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.649
be like, OK, how can I play with clothes?

1034
00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.340
How can I play with my makeup? How can

1035
00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:20.219
I, you know, when I am not afraid of

1036
00:51:20.219 --> 00:51:22.330
everything my body is doing or that everything that

1037
00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:26.439
it does is bad, then I can dance. I,

1038
00:51:26.659 --> 00:51:28.340
I can't, even if I don't look great doing

1039
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.979
it, I can dance. I can, you know, put

1040
00:51:30.979 --> 00:51:34.179
on a twirly skirt. I can, you know, express

1041
00:51:34.179 --> 00:51:37.020
myself how I want to express myself. I would

1042
00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:42.020
say going into porn has opened up doors to

1043
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:46.489
try. Things a little differently and learning a different

1044
00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:51.080
way to perform, how to connect with people. Um,

1045
00:51:51.469 --> 00:51:53.870
I think the biggest thing because it, I feel

1046
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:55.229
like so many people are like, oh, you're a

1047
00:51:55.229 --> 00:51:57.449
porn star. You must be fucking all the time.

1048
00:51:57.790 --> 00:52:01.850
And I'm like, actually, being in porn has limited

1049
00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:05.070
kind of my, my regular dating life so much

1050
00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:08.110
because of testing standards or like my availability is

1051
00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:11.060
just so limited. And if I'm going to be

1052
00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:13.860
seeing someone, even if it's casual, hey, if I

1053
00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.300
have a shoot in the next 2 weeks or

1054
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.699
the next month, like we, and you're not like

1055
00:52:17.699 --> 00:52:21.020
talent tested, and you're, and even if you are,

1056
00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:23.739
you can only engage with people who are talent

1057
00:52:23.739 --> 00:52:25.979
tested, and where I live, that pool is like

1058
00:52:25.979 --> 00:52:28.500
0. Like, how many people are like, yeah, I

1059
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.760
would like to casually see you and only you

1060
00:52:32.179 --> 00:52:35.570
and But then like I, Jasmine get to go

1061
00:52:35.989 --> 00:52:37.590
do other stuff, and I'm like, cause I've had

1062
00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:39.540
a few people like, how's that fair? I'm like,

1063
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:41.699
I don't know, man, maybe go pay for all

1064
00:52:41.699 --> 00:52:43.870
your partners to get tested, make sure that they're

1065
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:45.709
tested. I I don't know what else to tell

1066
00:52:45.709 --> 00:52:50.639
you, um, but it's, I think also just changed.

1067
00:52:51.489 --> 00:52:54.739
The way I've seen sex in my personal life,

1068
00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.659
it's made it so much more, it has always

1069
00:52:57.659 --> 00:53:01.060
been sacred, but it's like very much more sacred

1070
00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.899
and so much more intimate if I'm having, you

1071
00:53:03.899 --> 00:53:06.399
know, a sexual encounter with someone off of camera.

1072
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:11.179
Mhm. So my last question then, uh, if I

1073
00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:13.639
get, if I'm getting this right, you've been in

1074
00:53:13.639 --> 00:53:18.959
the porn industry for 2 years, 3, 4-ish months,

1075
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:19.520
right?

1076
00:53:19.879 --> 00:53:21.330
Something like that, yeah, yeah,

1077
00:53:21.719 --> 00:53:23.959
yeah, yeah. So, how do you look back at

1078
00:53:23.959 --> 00:53:27.080
these 2 years and, um, I mean, what do

1079
00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.919
you think uh about your future in the porn

1080
00:53:30.919 --> 00:53:33.760
industry? I mean, what are your plans and stuff

1081
00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.300
like that?

1082
00:53:34.639 --> 00:53:38.570
I get that question a lot, um. One, if

1083
00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:41.899
I look back at it, I say, wow, what

1084
00:53:41.899 --> 00:53:45.860
an amazing career, how much growth there is. I

1085
00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:49.260
realized that um it is not very common to

1086
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.459
have the start that I had where I kind

1087
00:53:51.459 --> 00:53:54.669
of had this really, you know, I'm sure there,

1088
00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:56.260
there might be people who don't know who I

1089
00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:59.699
am. That's fine. But within the porn industry, like

1090
00:53:59.699 --> 00:54:02.979
shooting up, getting nominated for some of the biggest

1091
00:54:02.979 --> 00:54:07.580
awards really quickly. Um, AND just continuously up there.

1092
00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.699
I look around sometimes, like when I'm hanging out

1093
00:54:09.699 --> 00:54:12.120
with my friends, and I'm like, wow, I'm surrounded

1094
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:17.439
by like, award-winning, award-nominated, top of the line porn

1095
00:54:17.439 --> 00:54:19.419
stars and creators. I'm like, how, but then I

1096
00:54:19.419 --> 00:54:22.659
also realized like, I'm one of those people. And

1097
00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:25.020
those are the circles I got put into and

1098
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:28.659
how absolutely insane that is. And in a sense,

1099
00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:30.219
I'm like, OK, well, I can understand why some

1100
00:54:30.219 --> 00:54:31.500
men hate me because I get to live your

1101
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:34.159
dreams. Like I get to fuck all the baddies

1102
00:54:34.159 --> 00:54:37.449
that you could never, um, but it is, it's

1103
00:54:37.449 --> 00:54:43.219
really amazing to see just the huge uptick. Um,

1104
00:54:43.639 --> 00:54:45.399
AND I think the, the question always is, where

1105
00:54:45.399 --> 00:54:47.560
do you go from there? I think I am

1106
00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.080
always trying every set that I go on before

1107
00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.439
I show up, as I'm there, I'm trying to

1108
00:54:52.439 --> 00:54:56.540
learn, grow, whether that be like my acting. Um,

1109
00:54:56.969 --> 00:54:58.739
WHATEVER it is, right? Like I got to shoot

1110
00:54:58.739 --> 00:55:01.139
for the ABN campaign. I was like, OK, let

1111
00:55:01.139 --> 00:55:03.060
me go look at past years on what they

1112
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:04.979
did with those models. Hey, if I'm going to

1113
00:55:04.979 --> 00:55:07.959
a set and it's like, OK, well this is

1114
00:55:08.179 --> 00:55:10.860
a realtor scene, I'm gonna go to this company's

1115
00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:11.929
website. I'm gonna look and see if they have

1116
00:55:11.929 --> 00:55:13.889
any other realtor scenes. How do realtors open the

1117
00:55:13.889 --> 00:55:15.899
door in porn? How do they talk to people?

1118
00:55:16.209 --> 00:55:18.300
What are things that I can say? Just always

1119
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:23.270
trying to grow, always trying to Be better for

1120
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:27.120
myself, for my coworkers, for everyone on sets, um.

1121
00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:30.340
And just trying to figure out like, hey, what

1122
00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:32.620
is that next thing that feels really right and

1123
00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:37.340
good? Um, WHAT I've been working on this past

1124
00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:41.280
year was leveling up my stuff for my sites,

1125
00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:43.780
as well as increasing and getting better at like

1126
00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:47.379
my acting and performing on stage. That way, you

1127
00:55:47.379 --> 00:55:50.540
know, I'm again, just constantly bringing something good, good,

1128
00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:53.620
and making everyone feel like, yes, this one, this

1129
00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.760
was great. Um, AND I think I've Really done

1130
00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.659
a great job in that this year of like

1131
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:05.020
having. Something kind of unlock unlocking me and being

1132
00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:09.000
like, wow, another level, and like I remember being

1133
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.409
on camera and like kind of feeling it come

1134
00:56:11.409 --> 00:56:14.300
out and I was like, wow, this is new.

1135
00:56:14.739 --> 00:56:16.899
This is, this is a whole brand new Jasmine,

1136
00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:20.699
she's doing, she's doing so much more, um, and

1137
00:56:20.699 --> 00:56:22.780
it's also wonderful to feel that way because it's

1138
00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:25.899
like, OK, yes, I can, like there's still a

1139
00:56:25.899 --> 00:56:27.760
place for me to go up and up and

1140
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:31.030
just keep. You know, reaching those goals and those

1141
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:36.550
dreams. Um, I really like script writing. I like,

1142
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:40.510
um, coming up with really fun stuff. I've done

1143
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:45.389
a few, like, short films that go along with

1144
00:56:45.389 --> 00:56:48.270
some of my scenes or, um, I think that's

1145
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:50.310
really fun, whether it be a solo or a

1146
00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:53.330
partner thing, and I don't know. And I, and

1147
00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:55.129

1148
00:56:55.129 --> 00:56:57.290

1150

00:57:06.209 --> 00:57:10.370
film that went on social media, you know, um,

1154
