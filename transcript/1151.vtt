00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:03.200
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.369
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:09.850
today I'm joined by Doctor William Chopik. He's associate

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.510
professor in the Department of Psychology at Michigan State

5
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.690
University. He's a social personality psychologist interested in how

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.729
relationships and the people in them change over time

7
00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:25.110
and across situations. And today we're going to talk

8
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.389
about relationship science, dynamics between partners and health outcomes

9
00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:36.849
associated with them, singlehood and marriage, and also attachment.

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.580
So Doctor Chopik, welcome to the, to the show.

11
00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:40.849
It's a pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.830
Yeah, pleasure as well. Nice to be here.

13
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.950
So let me ask you first, what is relationship

14
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.950
science? What kinds of topics and questions does it

15
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:52.689
explore?

16
00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.830
Uh, SO I would define it as the scientific

17
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.430
study of social connection. Uh, SO, uh, it's such

18
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430
a dangerous question, like, what does it study, what

19
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.230
doesn't it study, um, because it's so much, it's

20
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.550
between, you know, how you meet people for the

21
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.989
first time, why you're attracted to them, um, how

22
00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:11.830
to form a relationship, how to have a sexual

23
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.430
or romantic relationship, how to keep it going, what

24
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.709
happens when it ends, what happens if you don't

25
00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.809
want it, what happens if you really want it,

26
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.269
um, kind of how Approaches to relationships have changed

27
00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:27.699
over time or across countries, across different cultural settings,

28
00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:30.949
within different subgroups of the population. So, it's really

29
00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:33.150
kind of anything that has to do with social

30
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.110
connection is the type of thing that we study.

31
00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:41.160
Right. So let's go through some of the aspects

32
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.839
of the, I will call it dynamics between partners,

33
00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:50.319
uh, and how that translates into health outcomes that

34
00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.379
you've studied. So is there a link between having

35
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.419
an optimist partner and one's own health?

36
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.559
Yeah, there, there is. So that's, uh, a big

37
00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:04.319
part of our research agenda is trying to see

38
00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.480
how Different things about the person you're married to

39
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.929
or you're friends with, uh, can affect your health

40
00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.050
and well-being, and, um, you know, optimism, which I,

41
00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:15.970
you know, I'm guessing most listeners know, even if

42
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.960
they're not, and most people know what that means,

43
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:20.330
right? It's kind of looking forward to good things

44
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
that will happen or thinking good things will happen

45
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.479
in the future. Um, SO, among people and individuals

46
00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.759
that is generally associated with, uh, good things. Um,

47
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.600
SO those people who say they're optimistic, live longer,

48
00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:37.559
they're happier, um, they have better social relationships. But

49
00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:40.440
then, you know, because we were interested in the

50
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.919
impact of people around you, you know, cause I

51
00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.240
think everybody acknowledges that, um, you know, they don't

52
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.919
live in a vacuum, you know, they're, they're affected

53
00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.139
by their family and their friends and their partners.

54
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.100
You know, we, we had this idea that maybe

55
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.979
optimism would be good for um your partner as

56
00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.789
well. So, um, There's a bunch of different theories

57
00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:00.710
for why that might be the case, uh, but

58
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.509
we sort of just jumped right in and tried

59
00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.110
to see if there was, um, you know, any

60
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.860
link between it, and it turns out, over and

61
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.169
above you being an optimist. Um, BEING married to

62
00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.580
an optimist is associated with better health, uh, better

63
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.580
mobility, so among older adults, you know, being able

64
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.259
to say, bend down and pick up a quarter,

65
00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:19.860
that's like a, like a famous kind of ability

66
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.970
question. Um, YEAH, they live longer, they're more cognitively

67
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.619
intact, you know, it staves off Alzheimer's disease later

68
00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.699
if you're married to someone who's optimistic, so, um,

69
00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:31.860
the benefits are abound, you know, it looks like

70
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.539
it's affecting a bunch of different parts of a,

71
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.279
a person's life, and But then the mystery is

72
00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:38.279
sort of, you know, why is that the case?

73
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.520
Uh, YOU know, I actually find super optimistic people

74
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.940
kind of annoying and maybe bad for my health.

75
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.119
Um, SO that's what we've been trying to do

76
00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:48.149
lately is figure out, OK, well, like, why is

77
00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.360
this good? When might it be bad? Um, AND

78
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.039
then what can we tell people if, say, they

79
00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.000
want to be more optimistic, or, or they're trying

80
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.839
to find a partner for the first time. So

81
00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:58.539
that's, that's kind of what we're after.

82
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.869
Yeah, and can you already tell us more about

83
00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:05.369
that? I mean, when is having an optimist partner

84
00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:09.800
something good, when is it something bad, and why

85
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.919
is there that link between having an optimist partner

86
00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.910
and health and good health outcomes?

87
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.428
Yeah, so there's a bunch of different, um, Things

88
00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.989
people think, uh, being merit to optimists might, you

89
00:04:23.989 --> 00:04:26.260
know, help you out with. So, in one sense,

90
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.109
like the positive emotion is good, you know, being

91
00:04:28.109 --> 00:04:29.910
surrounded by someone who's not in the dumps all

92
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.390
the time, or, you know, always, uh, you know,

93
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.070
just raining on your parade. If you tell them

94
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.390
the good news, well, it's like, well, aren't you

95
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.029
terrified of that new job, you know, aren't you,

96
00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:40.179
don't you think they'll think you're dumb, or, you

97
00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:43.529
know, it's, people wanna be affiliated with optimistic people.

98
00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:46.910
Um, SO one is just the mobilizing energy that

99
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.940
some of those people have, but then, You know,

100
00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:52.000
the theories I mentioned earlier, a lot of them

101
00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:55.130
say that optimists think that they have control over

102
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.899
their lives, which for me it's always been this

103
00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:00.980
really fascinating finding in literature where there's some people

104
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.500
who think that good things happen to them, will

105
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.609
happen to them, and then like, gosh darn it,

106
00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:07.859
they, like they have a bunch of good things

107
00:05:07.859 --> 00:05:09.850
happen to them. I always thought that that was

108
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.010
so bizarre, um. But then the truth is, like,

109
00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:15.970
people who think that, think that their actions matter.

110
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.820
They think that going to the gym will benefit

111
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.299
their health. They think that, you know, changing their

112
00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:22.279
diet or nutrition will help them. They think that,

113
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.299
you know, they go to the doctor, you know,

114
00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:27.279
it might be nothing, but it's good to go.

115
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.070
Um, OR even if it is something, it's a

116
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.489
good thing that I went early and caught it

117
00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:33.540
early. So, there's a type of mastery or control

118
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.059
that, um, optimists have about their lives. Sometimes it's

119
00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:39.179
delusional, which I'll tell you about in a second.

120
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.779
Um. But then, you know, for, for the most

121
00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.260
part, they basically try stuff, um, they don't give

122
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.399
up, they persevere. But then they're willing to like

123
00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:50.540
try new things too, so they're pretty flexible. Um,

124
00:05:51.239 --> 00:05:52.920
SO that, that's one thing is that when you

125
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.000
ask someone to exercise, like the optimist will be

126
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.359
like, oh yeah, that'd be good for me. I'll,

127
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.920
I'll, I'll do that. So, so most people think

128
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.079
it's like physical activity, um, stress reduction, so optimists

129
00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:05.070
might be like less stressed out and stress is

130
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.359
bad for your health, obviously, um. So that's why

131
00:06:08.359 --> 00:06:10.119
people think it works is like diet and exercise,

132
00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:11.510
which, uh, you know, I wish I had a

133
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.760
better explanation, but those things are pretty, pretty good

134
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.040
for you, and um it turns out optimism might

135
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.519
motivate those. Um, BUT yeah, there's a whole another

136
00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:27.369
literature on, um, Kind of, uh. Unrealistic optimism is

137
00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:29.489
what they call it, or uh delusional optimism is

138
00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:31.369
what they call it, and, you know, the truth

139
00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:33.970
is it's all measured kind of differently than what

140
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.440
I just told you about. So the stuff that

141
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.570
I just told you about where optimism is great

142
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.489
and everything's amazing. A lot of that's just asking

143
00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:44.410
you, hey, um, you'll agree with an item like,

144
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.480
I expect good things, more good things than bad

145
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.040
things in the future. That's just you being like,

146
00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:51.880
yes or no, or on a little scale. The

147
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.959
unrealistic optimism people will often measure it, um, using

148
00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:59.959
like a task of some sort, or, um, they'll

149
00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:02.399
ask you about something that they have factual information

150
00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:05.239
about, and then they'll kind of quantify how kind

151
00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:08.799
of unrealistic you are. So, um, you know, one

152
00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:11.140
thing that they might do is they might say,

153
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.480
um, what would you say is your percentage risk

154
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.489
for getting lung cancer. Um, AND they would give

155
00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:19.589
a number, and then, so famously, people who smoke

156
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.890
tend to give a lower number than their actual

157
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.730
risk. Um, THEY basically think that they'll, they're less

158
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.049
likely to get it even though they smoke every

159
00:07:26.049 --> 00:07:29.089
day. Um, SO there's actually a way in public

160
00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:31.450
health and epidemiology to estimate like how, what is

161
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.549
your risk for lung cancer based on if you

162
00:07:33.549 --> 00:07:35.760
smoke or not, or where you live, or other

163
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.609
risk factors. Um, SO what they'll do is they'll

164
00:07:38.609 --> 00:07:41.250
just take the percentage you gave me, and they'll

165
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.929
subtract it from that kind of risk, that actual

166
00:07:43.929 --> 00:07:46.170
risk. And then that's the degree in which you're

167
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.410
unrealistically optimistic, and then that's associated with a bunch

168
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.239
of bad things like you keep smoking, uh, you

169
00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:55.450
do a bunch of other unhealthy things, you take

170
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.970
riskier bets. So there's like a little bit of

171
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.559
like, Not Wall Street research, but economic research where

172
00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:04.670
you, you look at if people take risks, um.

173
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.679
Yeah, other things too, like they'll give students, they'll

174
00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:08.720
say, well, how do you think you did on

175
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.799
that test you just took, and then they'll look

176
00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:12.160
at how they've done on the test, and then

177
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.500
they'll subtract the two numbers, and um, if you're

178
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.559
more on the realistically optimistic, you're sadder after you

179
00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:19.920
get the test score. So anyway, yeah, part of

180
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.600
it is baked into like how it's measured, um.

181
00:08:23.489 --> 00:08:27.000
But then there's also this other part where optimism

182
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.220
is measured through these other means, um, and then

183
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.460
that's, it looks like optimism could be dangerous, you

184
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.058
know, like, Uh, you keep doing a really unhealthy

185
00:08:36.058 --> 00:08:38.380
thing, or it's preventing you from doing a healthier

186
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.700
thing, or, um, you, you don't engage in self-insight

187
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.780
cause you think you're perfect. Um, SO there, there's,

188
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.260
there's other ways in which it can be really

189
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.849
harmful, and part of the intellectual fun is like

190
00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:52.659
trying to figure out when and why that's the

191
00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:56.419
case, and, um, how to abuse people of those

192
00:08:56.419 --> 00:08:58.880
kind of optimistic delusions, and it turns out it's

193
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.979
actually really hard, you know, humans are pretty stubborn

194
00:09:01.979 --> 00:09:03.119
about, about themselves.

195
00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:07.419
Right. So I asked you about optimism. How about

196
00:09:07.419 --> 00:09:12.219
happiness? Does happiness of the spouse also contribute to

197
00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:13.679
one's own health?

198
00:09:14.219 --> 00:09:17.400
Yeah, so we, yeah, that's another kind of, um,

199
00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:19.979
area where we try to look at these things

200
00:09:19.979 --> 00:09:21.530
that people seek out in life, like most people

201
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:22.809
want, would say that they would want to be

202
00:09:22.809 --> 00:09:24.830
happy or most people would say they live longer

203
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.450
too. Um, AND again, we tried to figure out

204
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.409
like, what is it about people that, you know,

205
00:09:29.489 --> 00:09:31.729
you could measure pretty easily, so how happy you

206
00:09:31.729 --> 00:09:33.650
are or how optimistic you are. These are things

207
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.570
that psychologists at least think that they are good

208
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.070
at measuring. Um, SO yeah, so that, um, similar

209
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.570
to the to optimism, a lot of it is

210
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.489
kind of this positive energy, this sense of purpose

211
00:09:44.489 --> 00:09:46.650
and meaning, that's some other research that we're doing

212
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.960
too. So there's this general outlook in life where,

213
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.739
you know, it's benefiting you and your partner, so,

214
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.780
it's associated with better health and well-being and lowered

215
00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.010
mortality too. Um, PEOPLE think the pathway is like

216
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.780
a little bit different, so, um, they think that

217
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.979
maybe there's this driving force of happy people. Um,

218
00:10:05.099 --> 00:10:07.419
BUT, you know, those studies in particular, it gets

219
00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:09.969
to this really fascinating thing happening in the close

220
00:10:09.969 --> 00:10:13.580
relationships field right now, where, um, you know, there's

221
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.739
some controversial research published a few years ago by

222
00:10:15.739 --> 00:10:19.020
Samantha Joel. Where, uh, they modeled all these things

223
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.659
about you and all these things about your partner,

224
00:10:20.669 --> 00:10:22.710
and they just tried to use all those things

225
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.109
through this kind of machine learning approach, um, to

226
00:10:26.109 --> 00:10:27.750
predict like why you're happy or if you stay

227
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.159
together. And, you know, the really fascinating thing, and

228
00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:33.719
this is why it's controversial, and it caused a

229
00:10:33.719 --> 00:10:35.960
little bit of an existential crisis within me, but

230
00:10:36.359 --> 00:10:38.640
basically, they found that a lot of what makes

231
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.840
you happy in your relationships has nothing to do

232
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.280
with your partner and has a lot to do

233
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.960
with you. Um, AND if you've ever like, been

234
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.799
in relationships, you can appreciate, like, if you're not

235
00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:51.479
in a good mental space, it kind of colors

236
00:10:51.479 --> 00:10:53.530
everything, like, uh, you know, you're, you're on edge,

237
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:58.409
you assume your partner doesn't have great intentions, um.

238
00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:00.960
So that was really eye opening, you know, after

239
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.500
I thought about it, it's like, oh yeah, something

240
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.489
like mental health or people's attachment styles, which we'll

241
00:11:05.489 --> 00:11:08.179
talk about later. Yeah, all that stuff does predict

242
00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:12.109
like people's experiences, um. But so then when we

243
00:11:12.109 --> 00:11:14.229
study things like happiness, a lot of it is

244
00:11:14.229 --> 00:11:16.750
geared towards like finding out the source of people's

245
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.349
relationships, relationship woes, uh, and their happiness and their

246
00:11:20.349 --> 00:11:23.710
joy, um, and part of that research is like

247
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.469
acknowledgement that, hey, like some of it has to

248
00:11:25.469 --> 00:11:28.640
do with like everything that's inside your head, um,

249
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.190
but then even above that we're, we're finding some

250
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.469
partner stuff, but then it's this whole evolving kind

251
00:11:34.469 --> 00:11:37.020
of Area of the field that I didn't think

252
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.940
would be evolving where we kind of have to

253
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.419
go back and look at like how partners are

254
00:11:41.419 --> 00:11:44.739
influential. We, we think they are, it's just um

255
00:11:45.099 --> 00:11:48.099
figuring out exactly when and, and why that's, that's

256
00:11:48.099 --> 00:11:48.849
the challenge.

257
00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:53.359
Mhm. So, let me ask you about the specific

258
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.500
health uh outcome or health issue. I would like

259
00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.020
to ask you about sleep quality. Is there a

260
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.919
link between marital quality and sleep quality?

261
00:12:04.539 --> 00:12:07.299
Yeah, there is, and, um, a lot of our

262
00:12:07.299 --> 00:12:09.500
research was trying to figure out like what's the

263
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.859
more um kind of consequential um direction, causal direction,

264
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.419
so, um. You know, I think for years and

265
00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:21.580
years and years there was a sentiment where, uh,

266
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.039
it's kind of an idiom, a cultural idiom. It's,

267
00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.700
I never go to bed angry, uh, it's this

268
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.400
marital, it's this marital advice that people give, um,

269
00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:31.580
they should give more advice, but that's like a

270
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.239
core feature is don't go to bed angry. Um,

271
00:12:35.739 --> 00:12:38.299
SO, um, for years and years and years that

272
00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:41.520
was meant to be like, well, you know. Um,

273
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.880
YOU know, be sensitive to kind of relationship dynamics,

274
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.559
try to settle an argument before you have kind

275
00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:49.739
of, um, before you go unconscious and sleep. Um,

276
00:12:50.159 --> 00:12:52.239
BUT, you know, a lot of our research was

277
00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:54.650
to suggest, you know, maybe sleep quality affects close

278
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.679
relationships as well. So, if you have either too

279
00:12:57.679 --> 00:13:00.309
little sleep or poor quality sleep, that, again, makes

280
00:13:00.309 --> 00:13:02.320
you on edge, it makes you stressed out. It's

281
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.270
actually associated with a lot of really bad, um,

282
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.520
health problems too, cognitive problems as well. Um, SO

283
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.320
we found that that also extends to your close

284
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.760
relationships, um, But it's kind of an interesting question

285
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.479
to ask. Um, YOU know, a person's healthy overall

286
00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:18.640
lifestyle would be, say, good sleep and having a

287
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.039
good relationship and stuff, but, um, there's a sense

288
00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:24.200
in which when you think about how to improve

289
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.570
any of those things, well, maybe the one reason

290
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.530
why your sleep is screwed up is because you

291
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.880
fight with your partner, like all day and just

292
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.799
before you go to bed. And there's also a

293
00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:34.679
sense that, you know, well, maybe the reason your

294
00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:37.369
relationship isn't going well is because you are working

295
00:13:37.369 --> 00:13:39.710
on 3 hours of sleep each night. Uh, AND,

296
00:13:39.719 --> 00:13:41.200
you know, if you kind of did better sleep

297
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.000
hygiene, maybe like your marriage would improve, as controversial

298
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.200
as that kind of premise is, but there is

299
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.679
a sense in which these things are all baked

300
00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:51.799
together. So, yeah, you know, we do more kind

301
00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:53.520
of correlational stuff, so it's just like, you know,

302
00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:54.919
people who have better sleep or they do have

303
00:13:54.919 --> 00:13:57.599
better relationships over time, and it looks like they

304
00:13:57.599 --> 00:14:00.760
do. Um, BUT there's been other people too that'll

305
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.510
look at more. What's called a daily diary approach

306
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.780
where they'll kind of ask them, hey, how'd you

307
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.390
sleep last night? And uh how much did you

308
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.380
fight with your partner today? And they'll do that

309
00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.950
every day for a whole month, which I, sometimes

310
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.669
I think is a little torturous. But, um, but

311
00:14:14.669 --> 00:14:16.309
yeah, so that, those studies have been done as

312
00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:19.030
well. There's been physiological studies, kind of where they'll

313
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.309
measure your heart rate and um cortisol levels too.

314
00:14:22.469 --> 00:14:25.330
So, um, yeah, it looks like, you know, sleep,

315
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.289
bad sleep is really bad for relationships. Um, And

316
00:14:29.289 --> 00:14:31.020
also your health too. So, yeah, a lot of

317
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.900
it was trying to link those two things together

318
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.979
over time to, to communicate how important it is,

319
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.669
uh, to work on both of those things.

320
00:14:38.809 --> 00:14:41.450
So before we move on to other topics, are

321
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:45.369
there any other ways partners can promote health?

322
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.130
Oh yeah, so many, so many. Uh, SO yeah,

323
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.809
we talked a little bit about, you know, exercise

324
00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:53.010
and or thinking that you can achieve things, and

325
00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.330
that's why you try, um, but there's a sense

326
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.369
in which, yeah, partners shape a lot of health

327
00:14:57.369 --> 00:15:00.809
outcomes, so. Sometimes they do it in proactive ways,

328
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.119
so they'll say, hey, you should go to the

329
00:15:02.119 --> 00:15:04.650
doctor, you know, it could, it might not be

330
00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:08.010
as bad as you think, or, um, partners have

331
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.440
a vested interest in us surviving. They, they, we

332
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.760
get to keep being in their life if we're

333
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.330
alive. Um, BUT then also they have, you know,

334
00:15:15.429 --> 00:15:19.289
warm, affectionate feelings, they care about us. Um, SO

335
00:15:19.289 --> 00:15:23.229
sometimes they'll encourage health behaviors like that. Um, SOMETIMES,

336
00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:26.210
um, Just by being in their sphere, if they

337
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.489
make a positive health change, we also tend to

338
00:15:28.489 --> 00:15:31.789
make that change. So, there's been studies on, um,

339
00:15:32.289 --> 00:15:34.770
when one partner quits, their other partner is likely

340
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:39.770
to quit in the next year. Um, SO, it,

341
00:15:39.849 --> 00:15:42.010
it's promotive, like going to the doctor or maybe

342
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.849
going to the gym together. Um, BUT then it

343
00:15:44.849 --> 00:15:47.590
can also be kind of more restrictive and controlling.

344
00:15:47.729 --> 00:15:50.960
So, um, They might prevent us from doing a

345
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.159
bunch of things that are really unhealthy, so, uh,

346
00:15:53.169 --> 00:15:55.450
they might say, hey, don't get dessert, don't eat

347
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:59.340
that whole chocolate cake. Um, I, it's a great

348
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.659
example when sometimes when spouses live together and one

349
00:16:01.659 --> 00:16:04.830
goes out of town, and the spouse who stays

350
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.059
devolves into this primitive state where they eat nothing

351
00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:10.289
but candy all weekend and lounge around the house,

352
00:16:10.299 --> 00:16:13.219
and they don't get any chores done. There's, there's

353
00:16:13.219 --> 00:16:16.419
actually entire theories about that in the relationship science,

354
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.090
where there is this kind of controlling aspect to

355
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.460
relationships where um they imbue us with more control,

356
00:16:22.539 --> 00:16:26.580
we're accountable to another person. Um, THEY'RE influential in

357
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.630
our lives in the sense that they, they ask

358
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.750
us to, um, kind of do healthier things or

359
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.869
selfless things. So that's a bunch of reasons. Like

360
00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:37.549
sometimes they prevent us from doing really bad stuff,

361
00:16:38.119 --> 00:16:41.479
sometimes they promote really good stuff, um, and that's

362
00:16:41.479 --> 00:16:45.109
generally why people think relationships are good for people,

363
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.010
um, you know, they also reduce stress too, but,

364
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:50.799
um. The idea is like they, they help us

365
00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:53.280
make smarter decisions, so that's kind of the grand

366
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.719
theory is, uh, you know, partners motivate us to,

367
00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.869
to do healthier things.

368
00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.080
Mhm. Let me ask you now a little bit

369
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:06.000
about spousal bereavement. How do people react psychologically to

370
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.400
it?

371
00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:11.219
Uh, SO my very, very short answer is that

372
00:17:11.219 --> 00:17:16.839
it is a very devastating transition. Um, HOWEVER, um,

373
00:17:17.598 --> 00:17:19.239
That might seem obvious to a lot of listeners,

374
00:17:19.318 --> 00:17:22.078
but there's a bit of a controversy happening in

375
00:17:22.078 --> 00:17:24.858
the field right now, actually, if you're curious, um,

376
00:17:25.358 --> 00:17:27.838
so for years and years and years, OK, so

377
00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:30.078
this will go back before the 1980s. I'll give

378
00:17:30.078 --> 00:17:32.828
you a timeline as well. So before the 1980s,

379
00:17:32.879 --> 00:17:35.229
a lot of people, uh, would look at, say,

380
00:17:35.239 --> 00:17:39.399
friends in their life or, or relatives, um, and

381
00:17:39.399 --> 00:17:40.879
you know, they would acknowledge that it's this really

382
00:17:40.879 --> 00:17:44.469
devastating transition. But then there were some people who

383
00:17:44.469 --> 00:17:48.670
um kind of, uh, had this absent grief, they

384
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.430
sometimes called it, where, you know, they would experience

385
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.310
this really devastating loss, but then they would, they

386
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.589
would kind of be OK, you know, they'd be

387
00:17:54.589 --> 00:17:56.449
sad in the interim, but they would kind of

388
00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.640
keep chugging along. Um, AND there was a little

389
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.439
bit of stigma to that, you know, I think

390
00:18:02.439 --> 00:18:06.640
that as a society we have this normative expectation

391
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.280
of how people would be sad or respond if,

392
00:18:09.319 --> 00:18:16.260
say, a partner died, um. And then, um, In,

393
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.349
I think like the 80s and 90s, there was

394
00:18:18.349 --> 00:18:20.780
this really interesting data set out of Michigan. They

395
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.489
started this study, it's a little dark, um, but

396
00:18:23.859 --> 00:18:26.780
they basically recruited couples with the knowledge that one

397
00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.900
of the couple members would pass away in the

398
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.180
next, say, two or three years. So, um, it's

399
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.699
just a really interesting study where they set it

400
00:18:33.699 --> 00:18:37.219
up knowing that a partner would be lost. Um.

401
00:18:37.739 --> 00:18:40.069
But that study was hugely influential because it kind

402
00:18:40.069 --> 00:18:43.390
of studied bereavement psychologically really in depth for the

403
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.430
first time. It's called the clock study, um, from

404
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.699
the University of Michigan. So, um, that study was

405
00:18:49.699 --> 00:18:52.979
really beneficial because, um, this guy named George Bonanno

406
00:18:52.979 --> 00:18:56.530
and other people. Uh, SHOWED that there were a

407
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.560
bunch of different trajectories that you could follow, um,

408
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.569
after you say, lose a spouse. So, like I

409
00:19:02.569 --> 00:19:03.890
said, there are some people for whom it's really

410
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:08.150
devastating, like, it's awful, and then they don't recover.

411
00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:11.229
Um, SO they also kept following these spouses. Um,

412
00:19:11.689 --> 00:19:13.089
BUT then there was a more normative one where,

413
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.170
you know, you get, so, you know, you're, you

414
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.050
have relatively good psychological functioning, and then your partner

415
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.280
dies, and, um, it gets really, really bad, but

416
00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.050
then you kind of rebound, uh, later. And I

417
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.260
think Um, it's a split between most people doing

418
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.959
that, and then most people being resilient, meaning that

419
00:19:29.959 --> 00:19:34.329
they didn't really have a huge increase in depressive

420
00:19:34.329 --> 00:19:37.849
symptoms. Um, SO I, I love that research and

421
00:19:37.849 --> 00:19:39.969
it was really great. As someone who's interested in

422
00:19:39.969 --> 00:19:43.530
personality, a lot of it was, um, showing the

423
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.599
heterogeneity or how, you know, how people change at

424
00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:48.609
different rates or and adjust differently. And, you know,

425
00:19:48.689 --> 00:19:50.520
it gave me this great appreciation for like humans,

426
00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.369
that there's not just one way to grieve, there's

427
00:19:52.369 --> 00:19:55.130
not, you know, just one way to, to navigate

428
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.449
these terrible things that happen to us. OK. So

429
00:19:57.449 --> 00:19:59.410
that was like a really great and heartwarming story.

430
00:20:00.469 --> 00:20:04.589
The problem is, in the last, say, 10 or

431
00:20:04.589 --> 00:20:08.030
15 years, um, people have tried to kind of

432
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.989
come up with different ways of modeling, uh, kind

433
00:20:10.989 --> 00:20:13.550
of how people change before and after bad stuff

434
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.760
happens to them. And one thing that they'll do,

435
00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.969
and I, I'll try to avoid getting too nerdy

436
00:20:18.969 --> 00:20:22.229
and uh bored and bog it down by like

437
00:20:22.439 --> 00:20:26.410
really technical things, but basically that, that original research

438
00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:30.520
in the eighties and nineties, um They applied a

439
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.680
technique called uh latent class analysis or growth mixture

440
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.890
modeling. There's a few different names for it. Um,

441
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.640
IT'S basically saying, You know, we want, and we're

442
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.359
interested in how people change over time, but maybe

443
00:20:41.359 --> 00:20:43.760
like within that sample, there's a bunch of different

444
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.829
like subpopulations where some people increase and some people

445
00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:49.819
go down. The heartwarming thing I told you earlier

446
00:20:49.819 --> 00:20:52.040
that there's these kind of ways that people change.

447
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.930
So, when you do something like that, you make

448
00:20:54.930 --> 00:21:01.500
a few methodological assumptions, um. And, uh, basically, in

449
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.530
the last, I think it's like 10 years or

450
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.150
plus or so, a few people have said, you

451
00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:10.010
know, if you relax those basic assumptions, um, the

452
00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.489
results change really dramatically. Um, SO instead of there

453
00:21:13.489 --> 00:21:15.770
being like a huge group of people that like

454
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:19.160
aren't resilient. The truth is that actually a lot

455
00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.439
of people struggle way more than you think, and

456
00:21:21.439 --> 00:21:24.839
actually some people never recover, and it's way, way

457
00:21:24.839 --> 00:21:27.469
worse than you thought, basically, like more, like more

458
00:21:27.469 --> 00:21:29.430
people kind of go the bad route. They're in

459
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:33.520
the bad place or bad route. Um, SO that's

460
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.839
where we stand now is there's kind of a

461
00:21:35.839 --> 00:21:40.270
disagreement over how exactly to model it. Um, TO

462
00:21:40.729 --> 00:21:42.609
pull the curtain back briefly, a lot of it

463
00:21:42.609 --> 00:21:46.569
is making assumptions on Between those different groups of

464
00:21:46.569 --> 00:21:50.680
people and how they change differently, like, Um, within

465
00:21:50.689 --> 00:21:52.489
one of those groups, do you allow some of

466
00:21:52.489 --> 00:21:55.089
those people to be more depressed than others, um,

467
00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.290
or, you know, do you think the groups would

468
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.939
change differently in different ways, not just going up

469
00:22:00.939 --> 00:22:03.660
or down, or, uh, just up or just down.

470
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.810
Um, AND basically when you relax those and you

471
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.229
kind of allow for more freedom in the data,

472
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.449
um, then actually the, the picture gets more devastating.

473
00:22:12.569 --> 00:22:15.270
So, you know, one thing that our research has

474
00:22:16.069 --> 00:22:18.510
Kind of shown is that people are really, really

475
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:22.630
stable. Um, THEY don't change very much. Uh, IF

476
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.780
you've lived your whole life being depressed and then

477
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.770
something bad happens to you, you, you're likely gonna

478
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.000
be depressed after it. Um, And you know, that's

479
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.880
something I think we can all appreciate, but, um,

480
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.810
it's, it actually is really, really important for the

481
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:39.209
analysis, uh, to account for that. So, um, yeah,

482
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.050
I, I think it changes some things like it'll

483
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.390
make you more depressed, it'll lower your well-being. Uh,

484
00:22:44.469 --> 00:22:45.989
YOU know, a few papers we have show that

485
00:22:45.989 --> 00:22:50.030
it won't fundamentally change who you are. Um, AND

486
00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.380
there's some controversy about that too, cause there's a

487
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.369
group of researchers who think that When your partner

488
00:22:55.369 --> 00:22:59.319
dies, um, it provides this really great opportunity to

489
00:22:59.319 --> 00:23:02.199
radically transform yourself, which is true, um, you know,

490
00:23:02.239 --> 00:23:05.079
it's a big decision, but Uh, we find that

491
00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:08.560
most people don't do that, um, and that's kind

492
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.750
of our contribution is to show like what changes,

493
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.880
what doesn't change, how is that kind of the

494
00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.109
same based on how you analyze the data. So,

495
00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.589
um, but yeah, it, it's such an important life

496
00:23:19.589 --> 00:23:23.219
event. It's a transformative life event, but, um, You

497
00:23:23.219 --> 00:23:26.250
know, sometimes things change, sometimes they don't, but yeah,

498
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.500
the question is kind of what, how, how would

499
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.060
it spur changes? Does it spur changes? Um, THERE'S

500
00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.969
so many different things that could potentially affect in,

501
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.800
in your life. Mhm.

502
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:41.959
And uh can cognitive decline impact spouses loneliness?

503
00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.660
Yeah, yeah, so again, that's another kind of series

504
00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.660
of studies we, where we're looking at the impact

505
00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.300
of health and, and relationships. That, that particular paper

506
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.770
is super interesting cause we Um, it started at

507
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.880
this, um, data immersion experience where they basically, it's

508
00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.290
really interesting, they give you a data set on

509
00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.489
the first day and then you have to analyze

510
00:24:01.489 --> 00:24:03.130
it and kind of come up with a question

511
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.770
and Come up with the question then analyze it,

512
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.569
um, and that one was born out of personal

513
00:24:09.569 --> 00:24:11.530
experiences, so, you know, we sat as a group

514
00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.969
talking about how Alzheimer's disease affects families and partners

515
00:24:15.969 --> 00:24:21.219
and marriages, um, And one thing that someone said,

516
00:24:21.609 --> 00:24:23.199
and it was really poignant at the time was

517
00:24:23.199 --> 00:24:26.319
that You know, even though someone is physically still

518
00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:31.079
there when These cognitive declines happen, um, it's, it

519
00:24:31.079 --> 00:24:33.689
almost feels like you're losing somebody. Uh, AND we,

520
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.160
we all, like, the room was just kind of

521
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.239
silent cause it was, it's one of those things

522
00:24:37.239 --> 00:24:41.260
that like, really speaks to our humanity and like,

523
00:24:41.599 --> 00:24:43.189
I, it kind of gave me goosebumps because it,

524
00:24:43.239 --> 00:24:45.479
it's like, it was such a shared experience where

525
00:24:45.479 --> 00:24:48.079
it's like, yeah, we spent our whole lives with

526
00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:49.959
these people or long periods of time with these

527
00:24:49.959 --> 00:24:53.010
people, and then You know, the degree, you know,

528
00:24:53.089 --> 00:24:54.930
they're just gone, the way, the way we used

529
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:59.239
to remember them. Um, THE relationship just changes, um,

530
00:24:59.319 --> 00:25:02.030
you know, people, people become caregivers instead of like

531
00:25:02.319 --> 00:25:05.770
spouses and lovers and Um, you know, so in

532
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.239
a way, one thing we found was that we

533
00:25:08.239 --> 00:25:12.680
had some data on people in marriages before, before

534
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.479
they got dementia, basically, before it was diagnosed, uh,

535
00:25:15.599 --> 00:25:18.579
or before their cognition got so bad that it

536
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.920
was Alzheimer's disease. Um, AND when we found that,

537
00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:25.439
you know, even like 8 years out before they

538
00:25:25.439 --> 00:25:29.239
get the formal diagnosis, um, their spouses reported feeling

539
00:25:29.239 --> 00:25:33.040
lonelier and lonelier as the dementia diagnosis got closer,

540
00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.709
so. Um, uh, SO it's, it's a weird way

541
00:25:36.709 --> 00:25:38.829
to kind of approach research where it started by

542
00:25:38.829 --> 00:25:41.349
saying, hey, here's this weird shared experience we have,

543
00:25:41.829 --> 00:25:44.150
and then, hey, can we look at these data

544
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.140
with, you know, thousands of couples and hundreds of

545
00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.469
couples filed over time. Um, AND what we found

546
00:25:49.469 --> 00:25:51.189
is that like the road to get to this

547
00:25:51.189 --> 00:25:53.949
really terrible thing was also really terrible. So basically,

548
00:25:53.979 --> 00:25:57.479
kind of people felt Again, before they got so

549
00:25:57.479 --> 00:25:59.650
bad, they, they were kind of feeling like they

550
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.949
were losing their partner, um, to this disease, so,

551
00:26:02.969 --> 00:26:06.040
um, You know, the next steps in that research

552
00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.920
is to figure out, you know, maybe. There are

553
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.680
ways of managing cognitive decline better, um, you know,

554
00:26:11.719 --> 00:26:13.760
maybe there's other relationships in your life that could

555
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:18.800
buoy, um, you know, your social connection, um, but

556
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.839
I acknowledge it's also really challenging when you're caring

557
00:26:20.839 --> 00:26:24.199
for somebody who really struggles with, um, things like

558
00:26:24.199 --> 00:26:26.920
cognitive decline and dementia. So, yeah, it looks like

559
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.839
they're at, they're at risk for, yeah, being really,

560
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:33.000
really lonely even before, um, the actual diagnosis happens.

561
00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:37.280
So we've been talking a lot about people in

562
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:42.040
relationships. What about single people? What is the relationship

563
00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:48.079
between singlehood and life satisfaction? When are single people

564
00:26:48.079 --> 00:26:49.000
satisfied?

565
00:26:49.479 --> 00:26:52.400
Yeah, enough about the married people, right? There's single

566
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.680
people. I know the truth is it's such a

567
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.520
huge part of the population, and, you know, everybody

568
00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.050
spends some part of their life single, so, um.

569
00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.520
Yeah, I think I'm, I'm part of a, a

570
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.640
few different kind of researchers around the country and

571
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.750
around the world where You know, I think, um,

572
00:27:08.989 --> 00:27:11.469
there has been previous research, um, this person named

573
00:27:11.469 --> 00:27:13.069
Bella De Paulo did a lot of work on

574
00:27:13.069 --> 00:27:15.989
this, and there's a sense with, with more and

575
00:27:15.989 --> 00:27:19.930
more people being single, um. Does it make sense

576
00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.250
to kind of study them in their own right,

577
00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.030
like, what their experiences are, what makes them happy,

578
00:27:24.439 --> 00:27:27.020
um, does the absence of a relationship make them

579
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.410
happy? Um, SO, yeah, so in terms of kind

580
00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:35.239
of Um, You know, the single being single or

581
00:27:35.239 --> 00:27:37.599
partnered, um, I will say that is, uh, that's

582
00:27:37.599 --> 00:27:40.400
also complicated. Sorry to ruin everything with, uh, some,

583
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.359
some nerdy methodological point, but, um. You know, if

584
00:27:44.359 --> 00:27:47.079
you look at overall, like across all studies all

585
00:27:47.079 --> 00:27:49.880
around the world, people who are in relationships say

586
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.819
that they're happier and have higher life satisfaction. Um,

587
00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.000
BUT there's a few caveats. So, uh, one is

588
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.400
that we don't know if marriage is making people

589
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.079
happy. Um, SO I think that for a lot

590
00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:05.719
of people when they hear that, that married people

591
00:28:05.719 --> 00:28:07.599
are happier than single people, they think that like

592
00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:10.920
marriage did that, uh, that's why they're different, and

593
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.520
single people aren't happy cause they're not in a

594
00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.319
relationship. But, um, I'll tell you a few kind

595
00:28:15.319 --> 00:28:17.239
of things to keep in mind. So one is

596
00:28:17.239 --> 00:28:21.319
that, um, similar to the bereavement study where kind

597
00:28:21.319 --> 00:28:23.949
of, or the cognitive decline study where we have

598
00:28:23.949 --> 00:28:27.280
data before they get, getting a dementia, um, people

599
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.640
have done studies like that before people get married,

600
00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:32.400
um, so they'll look at things like how happy

601
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.959
you were before you got married, how happy you

602
00:28:34.959 --> 00:28:36.959
were the, the day or the year you got

603
00:28:36.959 --> 00:28:39.319
married, and then do you keep being happy later

604
00:28:39.319 --> 00:28:42.300
on. Um, SO one thing that they find is

605
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.099
that the people who are married are happier to

606
00:28:45.099 --> 00:28:48.099
begin with. Uh, THEY'RE happier before they're, they even

607
00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:51.449
started dating. Um, SO when you hear like, married

608
00:28:51.449 --> 00:28:54.890
people are happier than single people, um, it's true

609
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.329
in a sense, like when you just compare them,

610
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.770
but it's also a little misleading in the sense

611
00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.329
that it's not cause of marriage per se, it's

612
00:29:02.329 --> 00:29:04.569
just cause of like, their whole life experience before

613
00:29:04.569 --> 00:29:08.489
that, and You know, happy people are more positive,

614
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.750
maybe they um have better like social functioning, like

615
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.540
they just kind of navigate social relationships a little

616
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.579
bit easier, and maybe that's why they get married.

617
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.660
It's not that, you know, marriage has this magical

618
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:22.199
properties. OK, so, that's me complaining about marriage briefly.

619
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:26.500
Um, AND then there's this other, uh, stuff too,

620
00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.839
where, um, just because single people don't have a

621
00:29:29.839 --> 00:29:34.140
relationship. Uh, DOESN'T mean that they're miserable. So, and

622
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.699
that's like, it's sometimes a little insulting to suggest

623
00:29:36.699 --> 00:29:39.540
that, like, oh, you're not married by the time

624
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.060
you're 19. What, you know, what will you ever

625
00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.859
find meaning in your life? Oh, there's nothing to

626
00:29:43.859 --> 00:29:45.599
do, there's no one to be friends with, there's

627
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.380
no professional successes that you would ever kind of

628
00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.380
endeavor or pursue, and, um, you know, the truth

629
00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.140
is that single people have stuff in their life,

630
00:29:53.219 --> 00:29:55.910
you know, they have friends, they have hobbies, and

631
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.979
Uh, you know, professional circumstances, and then, of course,

632
00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.140
not all married people are happy, right? Like I

633
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.979
know a lot of married friends that are like

634
00:30:03.979 --> 00:30:06.079
kind of miserable, not with their marriage per se,

635
00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.619
but like their lives. So, yeah, um, that brings

636
00:30:09.619 --> 00:30:12.290
me to my second point where, um, the effect

637
00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.619
is always not as large as you think. Um,

638
00:30:14.739 --> 00:30:20.699
SO if listeners implicitly, if not explicitly say, oh,

639
00:30:20.739 --> 00:30:22.380
I'd be so much happier if I was like

640
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.390
married or in a relationship. Like that might not

641
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.630
always be the case, you know, it, it wouldn't

642
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.589
solve every life problem you have, obviously. Like it

643
00:30:30.589 --> 00:30:32.270
would check this box, but it would maybe leave

644
00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:35.989
other things in your life unchecked. So, um, you

645
00:30:35.989 --> 00:30:37.869
know, when friends tell me, like, you know, they

646
00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:39.310
feel like this is a missing piece in their

647
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.949
life that'll kind of like fill this hole and

648
00:30:41.949 --> 00:30:44.430
make them happy in every way, you know, for

649
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:48.400
some people that might be true, but, um, When,

650
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.719
again, they look at these studies comparing like, as

651
00:30:50.719 --> 00:30:53.880
people get married, and then, you know, as people

652
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.520
don't get married and as they kind of switch

653
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.119
from divorce to singlehood, you know, a lot of

654
00:30:58.119 --> 00:31:02.699
people do experience life satisfaction changes, but um, Yeah,

655
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:05.339
it's, it's not as big as people think. There

656
00:31:05.339 --> 00:31:09.750
are, you know, some robust effects, but then, We're

657
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.979
working on something now, and, um, you know, Jeff

658
00:31:11.979 --> 00:31:15.780
McDonald's also published something on this recently where, um,

659
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.069
Marriage, it looks like is associated with life satisfaction,

660
00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.719
but then it's sometimes not in some countries, and

661
00:31:23.719 --> 00:31:26.280
then in some countries, it's the opposite direction where

662
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.719
single people are happier. Um, SO all that's to

663
00:31:29.719 --> 00:31:31.119
say is, you know, marriage is this kind of

664
00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:34.369
normative thing that people aim for, but then, Like

665
00:31:34.369 --> 00:31:36.229
I, I don't think it's like the sole determinant,

666
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.569
and this wasn't what you're asking. It's not really

667
00:31:38.569 --> 00:31:41.619
the sole determinant and what makes people happy, um,

668
00:31:42.089 --> 00:31:43.510
so I think people put it on a pedestal

669
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:46.199
a bit as this kind of thing that we

670
00:31:46.199 --> 00:31:49.170
all have to reach for, but then, um, The

671
00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.160
sad thing is I think they'd be disappointed if,

672
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:52.770
if they think that that's gonna solve all their

673
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:57.010
problems. So, um, single people are happier, um, you

674
00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:59.369
know, when they're investing in friendships and kind of

675
00:31:59.369 --> 00:32:02.489
seeking out goals, and, um, it intersects a little

676
00:32:02.489 --> 00:32:06.770
bit with how Um, how they age and develop

677
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.050
too, so kind of if they kind of become

678
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:12.729
content with being single too, so, um, yeah, it's

679
00:32:12.729 --> 00:32:16.089
a super, super complicated answer to a, to a

680
00:32:16.089 --> 00:32:18.119
simple question, but it, it's some, it's something that's

681
00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:19.959
really hot in the field right now is figuring

682
00:32:19.959 --> 00:32:22.810
out kind of what makes people happy and is

683
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.650
it a relationship and like for some people the

684
00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:25.250
answer is no.

685
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:30.930
OK, but compared to singlehood, does marriage link with

686
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:34.900
higher well-being and life satisfaction, or not?

687
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.260
Yeah, I think, I think on average, um, but

688
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.099
then it, it varies a little bit, like, based

689
00:32:40.099 --> 00:32:43.560
on, like, who you're studying and where they live,

690
00:32:43.569 --> 00:32:46.380
and there are other life circumstances too. So, yeah,

691
00:32:46.459 --> 00:32:48.979
the answer is yes, but then, you know, if

692
00:32:48.979 --> 00:32:50.380
a friend came up to you and said, like,

693
00:32:50.459 --> 00:32:53.959
should I get married, um, And like I, I

694
00:32:53.959 --> 00:32:57.250
would say that like the answer kind of would

695
00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.920
depend on a bunch of other things, not just,

696
00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.449
so I wouldn't just say yes to them.

697
00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:06.420
Right. And how do consistently married people compare to

698
00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:10.420
people who have moved in and out of various

699
00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:14.660
relationships throughout life when it comes to wellbeing?

700
00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:18.109
Yeah, so there's, that illustrates another way to look

701
00:33:18.109 --> 00:33:21.359
at this too, basically. If you followed people over

702
00:33:21.359 --> 00:33:23.589
their whole life and looked at, you know, when

703
00:33:23.589 --> 00:33:26.479
they were single, when they got married, divorced, and

704
00:33:26.479 --> 00:33:28.040
then you just basically look at how happy they

705
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.680
are at the end of life, um, that's a

706
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.910
different thing rather than comparing, say, how happy your

707
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.699
friend is before and after they get married. Um,

708
00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.839
SO, yeah, so that, that's kind of stuff we've

709
00:33:37.839 --> 00:33:41.920
done where, again, we followed like thousands of people

710
00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.040
and look at it as they get in and

711
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.280
out of relationships and You know, we'll, we'll find

712
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.280
people who, yeah, like you said, are consistently in

713
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.920
a relationship. Where they find, they're the lucky ones

714
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.520
that find someone when they're really young, and then

715
00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.020
they just kind of stay married. Um, AND then

716
00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.349
you'll see people that kind of move in and

717
00:33:58.349 --> 00:34:00.229
out of relationships too, where they'll, you know, they'll

718
00:34:00.229 --> 00:34:02.390
be married for 10 years, they'll get divorced, they'll

719
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.109
stay single. Um, AND it looks like those people

720
00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:08.208
who are consistently married are the happier ones, um,

721
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:11.020
and the people who move in and out, and,

722
00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.429
you know, they get divorced or they date for

723
00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.030
a bit and then they break up, they sort

724
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:17.590
of look like single people actually, kind of over

725
00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:21.139
the whole lifespan. Um, SO, you know, they seem

726
00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:23.350
to be just as happy than people who like

727
00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:26.708
never had a relationship over 6 months. So, it,

728
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:30.800
you know, it's really interesting, um. The paper is

729
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.958
called Love and Lost, uh, you know, this Shakes,

730
00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:34.489
I think it's Shakespearean, is it, is it better

731
00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:36.239
to have loved and lost than never loved at

732
00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:39.780
all, and most people say yes, but then, um,

733
00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.719
we have this really weird study where, you know,

734
00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.639
the people who kind of migrated in and out

735
00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.938
of relationships, they, they aren't really happier at the

736
00:34:46.938 --> 00:34:49.080
end of the day. Maybe Shakespeare wasn't thinking of

737
00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.830
happiness per se, but, um, Yeah, it's, the really

738
00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:56.790
cool thing with that is more and more longitudinal

739
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.510
studies are doing that. So, one thing we're hoping

740
00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:01.270
to do in the future is to look at,

741
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.449
you know, maybe those disparities between single people and

742
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.909
those who are married their whole life or those

743
00:35:06.909 --> 00:35:09.389
who move in and out, you know, is that

744
00:35:09.389 --> 00:35:12.989
similar across different countries and different settings, and, you

745
00:35:12.989 --> 00:35:15.510
know, is there some sort of ecological or, you

746
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:18.929
know, something about your environment that's explaining why. Why

747
00:35:18.929 --> 00:35:20.850
you're not as happy as you are, uh, as

748
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:23.159
you transition and out, so, yeah, it looks like

749
00:35:23.159 --> 00:35:25.169
the people who kind of have their found their

750
00:35:25.169 --> 00:35:27.879
person and stay with them. They tend to be

751
00:35:27.879 --> 00:35:29.919
happier, but like I said earlier, like they could

752
00:35:29.919 --> 00:35:33.229
have been happier, you know, to begin with, so,

753
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.199
um, but part of it is discovering like how

754
00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:37.520
much is that the case.

755
00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:42.830
How about personality similarity? Does it also play a

756
00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:45.030
role in relationship satisfaction?

757
00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.600
Yeah, so, um, that's another kind of area of

758
00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.709
our research where, um, We kind of, uh, and

759
00:35:53.709 --> 00:35:55.629
other people have done this work too, just we,

760
00:35:55.709 --> 00:35:58.270
we violated a lot of people's intuition by showing

761
00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:01.790
that it kind of doesn't, um. And, you know,

762
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:05.209
it really, really confuses people, uh, cause I think

763
00:36:05.669 --> 00:36:09.310
when people have a list of the things that

764
00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:12.030
they kind of want in a partner. One of

765
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.629
the things that they say they want is someone

766
00:36:13.629 --> 00:36:16.610
who like vibes well or is similar to them,

767
00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:19.469
um, you know, and, and on paper, it makes

768
00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:22.969
a lot of sense. Like, if you say, Uh

769
00:36:23.899 --> 00:36:26.260
Or a shy person paired with an extrovert, or

770
00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.260
if you're someone who's like a picky eater, paired

771
00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.340
with someone who's like really adventurous, like there's a

772
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.179
ton of ways that can go wrong if you're

773
00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:37.500
not similar. Um, BUT, and some similarity does matter,

774
00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.419
so something on like say religious background, that's actually

775
00:36:40.419 --> 00:36:42.939
really, really important. So, it's kind of, uh, if

776
00:36:42.939 --> 00:36:44.699
you have if you want kids or not, that's

777
00:36:44.699 --> 00:36:48.760
another really, really important one. SO some similarity matters

778
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.719
in that case. Uh, THERE'S also some racial ethnic,

779
00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.899
uh, similarities, so, Where people are kind of attracted

780
00:36:54.899 --> 00:36:56.540
to those who are kind of part of their

781
00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.620
own racial ethnic group. Um, BUT in terms of

782
00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:03.500
personality similarity, I think people will often privilege that

783
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.659
as a thing that's super important, like, we're just

784
00:37:05.659 --> 00:37:09.850
really similar, we kind of go together, um. But

785
00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.699
I think the So tons of people have studied

786
00:37:12.699 --> 00:37:15.300
this, and they all kind of find that it

787
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.770
doesn't matter as much, so we've thrown so much

788
00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:20.179
data at it, there's been so many studies on

789
00:37:20.179 --> 00:37:23.649
it, and it kind of always comes back not

790
00:37:23.659 --> 00:37:28.860
being super important, um, but the really interesting thing

791
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.659
is that That might not matter like how extroverted

792
00:37:33.659 --> 00:37:36.379
you are and how extroverted a partner is, um,

793
00:37:36.419 --> 00:37:38.340
but what does matter is if you think you're

794
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.050
similar, uh, and then that, so that's the tricky

795
00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:44.159
thing where regardless if you are similar or not,

796
00:37:44.419 --> 00:37:48.590
um. That kind of doesn't matter, but if you've

797
00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:51.510
convinced yourself you are, if you perceive that there

798
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.110
is more similarity, that's associated with a bunch of

799
00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:56.709
good things. So you, you say you're happier, you

800
00:37:56.709 --> 00:37:58.669
know, you say you work well together, you fight

801
00:37:58.669 --> 00:38:02.939
less, um. Uh, YOU'RE more attracted to people when

802
00:38:02.939 --> 00:38:04.540
you first meet them, if you think that you're

803
00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:07.409
similar, even again, if you're not. So again, like,

804
00:38:07.419 --> 00:38:11.810
one of the really Big contributors for um kind

805
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:15.060
of relationship sciences. That a lot of the things

806
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.050
you think will make you happy in your life,

807
00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:20.459
or happy in your relationships, like, aren't always the

808
00:38:20.459 --> 00:38:22.459
case, but then there's maybe these other things that

809
00:38:22.459 --> 00:38:26.419
you would neglect, um, that could, could be really

810
00:38:26.419 --> 00:38:28.300
important, um, and that's true of a lot of

811
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.969
things like, The things that you say you want

812
00:38:30.969 --> 00:38:33.090
in relationships, and then what actually predicts you getting

813
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:38.189
in relationships are different. Um, Yeah, you thinking something

814
00:38:38.189 --> 00:38:41.600
is more important than it actually being true. Um,

815
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.010
THERE'S a lot of things in life that are

816
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.860
sort of like that too, but, um, but yeah,

817
00:38:45.909 --> 00:38:48.030
I think, yeah, one thing is we, we've looked

818
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:50.629
at so many different data sets and different ways

819
00:38:50.629 --> 00:38:52.870
of analyzing it, and it looks like it kind

820
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.969
of just doesn't matter as much as people think.

821
00:38:55.149 --> 00:38:57.870
Um, THE, the, the more controversial one, which we

822
00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:01.270
don't have to go into is that, um, the

823
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.469
idea that similar people go together is the premise

824
00:39:03.469 --> 00:39:07.320
of every Um, online and mobile dating application that

825
00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.280
people currently use, uh, and I'm telling you that

826
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:15.040
it's unequivocally maybe not important, so, uh, that's the

827
00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.600
kind of controversial part.

828
00:39:17.629 --> 00:39:20.750
That's interesting. So let's get into the topic of

829
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:23.979
attachment then. You've done lots of work on it.

830
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:28.469
First of all, what is attachment theory and what

831
00:39:28.469 --> 00:39:31.790
are the different kinds of attachment style out there?

832
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.260
So yeah, it's, it's basically a theory describing how

833
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.250
your early caregiving relationships, like your relationships with your

834
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:42.739
parents, might, uh, put you on a trajectory that

835
00:39:42.739 --> 00:39:45.300
would explain why you approach relationships in all sorts

836
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.459
of different ways. Uh, SOME people say you internalize

837
00:39:48.459 --> 00:39:51.840
what relationships are like based on these early experiences,

838
00:39:52.139 --> 00:39:54.419
um, and that guides say how you make friends

839
00:39:54.419 --> 00:39:57.100
and who you date and how you behave in

840
00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.810
relationships. Uh, SOME people would say the rest of

841
00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:02.179
your life. So that's kind of the basic premise,

842
00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.020
that basic fact, that basic premise, um, or theory

843
00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.879
most people would agree on. Um, EXACTLY how to

844
00:40:08.879 --> 00:40:11.649
measure it, and then if it's the same across

845
00:40:11.649 --> 00:40:14.209
life, it's something we can talk about, cause there's

846
00:40:14.209 --> 00:40:16.389
a lot of kind of people talking about that.

847
00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:22.010
Um, BUT, you know, early relationships, um, are often

848
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:25.129
categorized in a few different ways. So, some of

849
00:40:25.129 --> 00:40:28.100
this research observed out of like John Bowlby observing,

850
00:40:28.969 --> 00:40:35.360
um, basically like foster children, um, and, uh, Yeah,

851
00:40:35.479 --> 00:40:38.110
um, but it's, it was later operationalized in a

852
00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:41.199
series of different studies. Uh, SO Bobi would have

853
00:40:41.199 --> 00:40:44.330
these kind of observations at a Tavistock clinic where

854
00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.520
You know, he would notice that children separated from

855
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.389
their parents act in particular ways. Um, BUT then,

856
00:40:51.439 --> 00:40:54.659
yeah, Mary Ainsworth was really, really use useful and

857
00:40:54.659 --> 00:40:56.959
innovative and developing the first way we can test

858
00:40:56.959 --> 00:40:58.280
some of these things. So she came up with

859
00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.600
the strange situation paradigm, which maybe some people will

860
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.669
know, but it's this kind of task where you

861
00:41:04.669 --> 00:41:07.820
um bring in um parents and their children, and

862
00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.669
then the parent leaves the room, and you basically

863
00:41:09.669 --> 00:41:11.989
study how the child reacts when the parent leaves,

864
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:14.909
and then when the parent comes back. So, from

865
00:41:14.909 --> 00:41:18.060
that basic design, they'll say that children might be,

866
00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:22.389
say, securely attached, um, have an anxious, ambivalent attachment,

867
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.729
a dismissing avoidant attachment. Um, BUT then the really

868
00:41:26.729 --> 00:41:30.659
tricky thing. Um, AND the thing that we're interested

869
00:41:30.659 --> 00:41:34.820
in is sort of what happens when people transition

870
00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.209
from those early childhood years to start forming, say,

871
00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.260
friendships and romantic relationships, um, and that's where it

872
00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.020
gets a little hairy.

873
00:41:42.669 --> 00:41:46.070
So, uh, just to refer to something you mentioned

874
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:50.689
there, is attachment the same across life or not?

875
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:58.510
Um. Yes, uh, so, um, sort of, um, but

876
00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:01.629
not entirely. So, so one thing is that your

877
00:42:01.629 --> 00:42:04.100
relationships are just very different across your life. So,

878
00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.770
like we've been talking about parent-child relationships, it's really

879
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:10.820
asymmetrical, um, for, for a few years early in

880
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.310
life they controlled when you ate, when you slept,

881
00:42:13.739 --> 00:42:15.750
uh, maybe not if you screamed or not, or

882
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.389
if you threw a tantrum, maybe they didn't control

883
00:42:17.389 --> 00:42:21.100
that stuff, but, um. Uh, BUT then, you know,

884
00:42:21.179 --> 00:42:24.939
as you approach adolescence, and like, you start to

885
00:42:24.939 --> 00:42:29.850
become more autonomous and more independent. Um, YOU start

886
00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:31.830
kind of forming relationships with different people, so all

887
00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:33.330
of a sudden you meet a friend or a

888
00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:35.850
peer, and that's really different than your relationship with

889
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:39.090
your parents, right? There's this reciprocity, uh, they're an

890
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:42.409
equal, you know, they're often of equal stature. Um,

891
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.449
LIKEWISE, you then start dating, and then that's yet

892
00:42:44.449 --> 00:42:46.850
a different one. It's sort of like peer relationships

893
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:50.929
where it's someone. Usually of equal standing or someone

894
00:42:50.929 --> 00:42:53.850
your age or your generation, um, not always, but,

895
00:42:54.139 --> 00:42:56.209
um, and there's a sense in which, yeah, there's

896
00:42:56.209 --> 00:42:58.919
like an emotional and physical intimacy with that relationship,

897
00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:03.239
that is maybe not as present with friends. So

898
00:43:03.239 --> 00:43:06.199
that's been part of the difficulty too is moving

899
00:43:06.199 --> 00:43:10.949
attachment from this more kind of caregiver child asymmetric

900
00:43:10.949 --> 00:43:15.040
asymmetrical thing to more autonomous relationships that say you

901
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:18.360
would seek out like today as an adult. Um,

902
00:43:18.679 --> 00:43:21.479
AND the measure is different too, so we can't

903
00:43:21.479 --> 00:43:23.159
put like a 40 year old man in the

904
00:43:23.159 --> 00:43:26.000
strange situation paradigm, it just wouldn't work. Like their

905
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.639
mom leaves and they don't start crying, and they

906
00:43:27.639 --> 00:43:29.919
don't, you know, have this exuberant thing, you know,

907
00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.939
they're They can control their emotions, and they have

908
00:43:32.939 --> 00:43:37.489
other relationships. Um, SO what they'll do is, uh,

909
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.830
instead of this strange situation, some people will do

910
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:43.179
a very long interview, where they'll talk, have people

911
00:43:43.179 --> 00:43:47.139
talk about their early experiences and So they'll basically

912
00:43:47.139 --> 00:43:48.620
see if you can talk about them in a

913
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.020
coherent way that makes sense, even if it's not

914
00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.500
always positive, the idea that you kind of have

915
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.689
a realistic assessment of what your childhood is like,

916
00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:57.989
and There's ways that they kind of suss out

917
00:43:57.989 --> 00:44:01.310
if you're kind of being authentic with with those

918
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.159
discussions. And then other, a whole different group of

919
00:44:04.159 --> 00:44:07.500
people who I'm a part of, uh, will give

920
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.520
people self-report scales, where again, they'll give them a

921
00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:14.280
series of statements for how they approach um adult

922
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.879
relationships, um, and they'll kind of agree or disagree

923
00:44:17.879 --> 00:44:19.520
with that, and those are way easier to fill

924
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.320
out than say a really long interview. Um, THE

925
00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.840
problem is that the interview and the self-report questions

926
00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.239
don't correlate very highly. Um, SO again, they start

927
00:44:29.239 --> 00:44:32.379
out with the same theory, again, that caregiving relationships

928
00:44:32.379 --> 00:44:34.830
really matter, um, but then they came up with

929
00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:37.709
different ways of measuring it and The hope is

930
00:44:37.709 --> 00:44:39.270
that they would kind of agree a little bit,

931
00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:40.909
but it turns out that they, they kind of

932
00:44:40.909 --> 00:44:45.030
don't, um, so that's where kind of the field

933
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.629
starts to bifurcate. Um, THERE'S other relationships as well,

934
00:44:48.709 --> 00:44:50.590
like, I give you the first part of the

935
00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:52.709
story and then you finish it, and if you

936
00:44:52.709 --> 00:44:56.070
finish it in a really insecure way, uh, you

937
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:58.020
know, they don't, they, the two don't, don't end

938
00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.780
up together and whatever they fight at the end

939
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.409
of it or it's a big falling out, um,

940
00:45:02.909 --> 00:45:05.889
so, um. That's when the field starts to bifurcate,

941
00:45:05.899 --> 00:45:09.580
and then there's these two different traditions. Um, AND

942
00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.560
then from there, there's a million different questions because

943
00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.689
adult relationships are so complicated, like, you know, you

944
00:45:15.689 --> 00:45:18.419
have partners and friends, you have relatives, you, a

945
00:45:18.419 --> 00:45:20.659
lot of people still maintain relationships with their parents,

946
00:45:20.729 --> 00:45:24.500
and, but those relationships change too. Um, SO part

947
00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:28.139
of the challenge with attachment is grappling with You

948
00:45:28.139 --> 00:45:29.739
know, you have all these different relationships in your

949
00:45:29.739 --> 00:45:32.780
life. Uh, IS it the same thing? I think

950
00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:34.929
there's a kernel of the same thing where there's

951
00:45:34.929 --> 00:45:37.979
some stability throughout your whole life with how you

952
00:45:37.979 --> 00:45:42.260
approach, how you approach relationships, but, um, exactly how

953
00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:45.310
to test that and how strong it is, um,

954
00:45:45.419 --> 00:45:47.260
is a different story entirely. So I think it's

955
00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.860
like, The effects are probably small, but still there.

956
00:45:51.219 --> 00:45:54.159
Um, BUT if you, if you talk to say

957
00:45:54.159 --> 00:45:58.000
internet influencers or self-proclaimed therapists, they'll claim that like

958
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.409
your childhood attachment. Dictates like 100% everything you do

959
00:46:02.409 --> 00:46:04.489
all the time as an adult, and I, I

960
00:46:04.489 --> 00:46:05.669
just don't think that that's true.

961
00:46:07.239 --> 00:46:11.409
OK, so about that, do people have one single

962
00:46:11.409 --> 00:46:16.729
kind of attachment style for every kind of relationship

963
00:46:16.729 --> 00:46:22.159
and for relationships with all people, or can the

964
00:46:22.159 --> 00:46:26.250
relationships, uh, can the attachment style vary from one

965
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.689
relationship to the other?

966
00:46:28.469 --> 00:46:30.510
Yeah, um, and I think that that was also

967
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:33.370
a good thing that the field did was they,

968
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.389
they realized, you know, people who study childhood attachment,

969
00:46:36.629 --> 00:46:38.949
there often is just this relationship with you and

970
00:46:38.949 --> 00:46:41.389
your parents. Uh, OF course, you then, you know,

971
00:46:41.469 --> 00:46:43.870
you have play dates with other really young children

972
00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:46.070
too, and you have aunts and uncles, whatever, and

973
00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:50.439
siblings, um. Um, BUT then, you know, I think

974
00:46:50.439 --> 00:46:53.870
there's this acknowledgement that You know, people aren't the

975
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:56.139
same in every relationship. They're not even the same

976
00:46:56.139 --> 00:46:59.100
in, in, in every romantic relationship, I'll say, like,

977
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.830
your dynamics with, say, an ex-partner are different than

978
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:04.310
maybe your current and maybe different than a future

979
00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:07.189
one. SO it started out with that, the idea

980
00:47:07.189 --> 00:47:10.050
that people might have different kind of attachment styles

981
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:14.270
even within them, perhaps. Um, AND then we finally

982
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:18.500
started to measure those other relationships, so, um, You

983
00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.250
know, there's some really influential measures about how you

984
00:47:21.709 --> 00:47:24.830
interact with friends versus partners, and then versus your

985
00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:28.429
parents, versus your siblings. And it was really, really

986
00:47:28.429 --> 00:47:29.949
important to do that because it turns out that

987
00:47:29.949 --> 00:47:34.389
they do matter, um, kind of for different things.

988
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:38.550
So, you know, we're primarily interested in how these

989
00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:41.149
things change over time, and it looks like the

990
00:47:41.149 --> 00:47:43.350
way that your relationships with your parents change are

991
00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:46.949
different. With how you change with your friends and

992
00:47:46.949 --> 00:47:52.370
romantic partners. So, um, That's a good illustration to

993
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:54.689
show that, hey, like you're not just defined by

994
00:47:54.689 --> 00:47:58.389
this one trait or this one attachment style. Rather,

995
00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:01.280
you know, you could approach relationships really, really differently,

996
00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:04.169
where you could have a wonderful relationship with your

997
00:48:04.169 --> 00:48:06.530
parents, but then really struggle with romance or vice

998
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:09.530
versa, where you date really well, but don't love

999
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:13.310
your parents as much. Um, SO yeah, so the,

1000
00:48:13.699 --> 00:48:15.250
the key though is when you measure something like

1001
00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:17.520
attachment style, what are you measuring? So are you

1002
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.389
measuring like all of those different attachment styles just

1003
00:48:20.389 --> 00:48:24.409
like average together, or are some of the attachment

1004
00:48:24.409 --> 00:48:27.520
relationships more influential where, you know, by the time

1005
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.879
you're say 40, maybe it matters more for your

1006
00:48:29.879 --> 00:48:34.280
romantic relationship, uh, but maybe like when you're 15,

1007
00:48:34.489 --> 00:48:36.850
it'll matter more for your parents or your, your

1008
00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:39.899
friends, you know, before or as you start dating.

1009
00:48:40.439 --> 00:48:42.760
So it, it's gotten more complicated, but I also

1010
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.629
think it's gotten more. Kind of close to people's

1011
00:48:45.629 --> 00:48:50.629
actual experiences, uh, the idea that Yeah, there's, there's

1012
00:48:50.629 --> 00:48:53.550
some attachment styles that are partner specific and not

1013
00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:57.669
just this general approach. So, yeah, you, you tap

1014
00:48:57.669 --> 00:49:01.189
into a really interesting thing cause it was something

1015
00:49:01.189 --> 00:49:03.469
that people took a while to get to, but

1016
00:49:03.469 --> 00:49:06.750
then now it's sort of widely acknowledged that we

1017
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:08.889
have different attachment styles to different people.

1018
00:49:09.469 --> 00:49:14.379
Mhm. And how does attachment change with age? Are

1019
00:49:14.379 --> 00:49:19.159
there any patterns in how attachments change as we,

1020
00:49:19.659 --> 00:49:20.709
uh, grow older?

1021
00:49:21.459 --> 00:49:23.030
Yeah, so this is, uh, one thing that our

1022
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:26.020
lab tries to do, um, and work on really,

1023
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:30.110
really deliberately. So, um, it does change across life,

1024
00:49:30.229 --> 00:49:33.070
so, um, and hopefully that'll give some hope to

1025
00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.169
listeners if they feel like they want to change,

1026
00:49:35.229 --> 00:49:38.370
um. Yeah, if they want to, uh, at least,

1027
00:49:38.449 --> 00:49:41.739
um. So, yeah, so we've done a bunch of

1028
00:49:41.739 --> 00:49:43.830
different studies on this. So sometimes we just look

1029
00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:46.469
at like a really, really big sample of people

1030
00:49:46.469 --> 00:49:49.110
and just compare young, middle aged, and older adults.

1031
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.189
Um, AND sometimes we do that, but if they

1032
00:49:52.189 --> 00:49:55.929
live in different regions of the world, um, And,

1033
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:58.429
you know, and the studies will have like 80

1034
00:49:58.429 --> 00:50:01.530
or 90,000 people, um, so like pretty big studies,

1035
00:50:01.979 --> 00:50:04.270
um, and you know, one thing we find is

1036
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:08.510
that, um, across all those studies, people get less

1037
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:12.909
anxious about relationships. So, um, and I've always found

1038
00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:15.870
that to be comforting, uh, so cause when I

1039
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:18.379
was younger I was kind of anxious, especially about

1040
00:50:18.389 --> 00:50:22.199
relationships, um. But there's kind of this mellowing out

1041
00:50:22.199 --> 00:50:24.929
that happens where you kind of get less anxious.

1042
00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.610
Single people mellow out too, uh, so it's not

1043
00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:29.889
just people in relationships, um, so everybody kind of

1044
00:50:29.889 --> 00:50:32.949
just gets less anxious. They get less anxious about

1045
00:50:32.949 --> 00:50:34.959
non-relationship stuff too. So that's why I say it's

1046
00:50:34.959 --> 00:50:37.250
hopeful, you know, you can worry less about all

1047
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:40.949
sorts of things. Um, It's also good that like

1048
00:50:40.949 --> 00:50:44.489
people in relationships, after they've been married for like

1049
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:47.550
30 years, they stop worrying about if their partner

1050
00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:48.830
is gonna be around all the time, cause they

1051
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:51.030
have this like evidence that's built up that, oh,

1052
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:52.429
I'm gonna wake up next to them the next

1053
00:50:52.429 --> 00:50:56.340
day. OK, just like every other day, previous 29

1054
00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:01.510
years. Um. So, yeah, so it looks like people

1055
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:06.610
uh Um, decrease in what's called attachment anxiety, which

1056
00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:10.209
is kind of worrying and preoccupied, being preoccupied about

1057
00:51:10.209 --> 00:51:14.419
relationships. Um, ATTACHMENT avoidance is a little bit different,

1058
00:51:14.439 --> 00:51:18.310
and some things are seen, some different things are

1059
00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:21.790
seen across different studies, so, If you just look

1060
00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:24.750
on average, the whole population, it looks like attachment

1061
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:27.600
is weirdly just uh stable through a lot of

1062
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:32.070
life. It's just this like flat line, um, Where

1063
00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:34.219
it just on, on the surface, it just doesn't

1064
00:51:34.219 --> 00:51:38.139
look like people are changing. Um, THE truth is

1065
00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.280
that kind of hides what a lot of people

1066
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.959
are doing. So, the truth is that some people

1067
00:51:42.959 --> 00:51:45.800
are increasing and some people are decreasing, but then

1068
00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.189
when you average it out, it, um, just looks

1069
00:51:48.189 --> 00:51:50.840
like no one changes. So it's, it's really, really

1070
00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:53.120
misleading when you look at just an overall graph.

1071
00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.560
Um, THAT'S what people call individual differences and change.

1072
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:57.919
They just individuals differ in their changes, that's all

1073
00:51:57.919 --> 00:52:02.409
that means, um. And uh one thing we have

1074
00:52:02.409 --> 00:52:03.850
found in recent studies is when you look at

1075
00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:06.409
the eldest old, like people who are, have surpassed

1076
00:52:06.409 --> 00:52:09.949
their 70s, 80s, into their 90s, some samples have,

1077
00:52:10.449 --> 00:52:13.889
um, for those people, avoidance tends to decline really

1078
00:52:13.889 --> 00:52:19.110
dramatically, um, so, It looks like, again, on average,

1079
00:52:19.929 --> 00:52:21.850
Like people are doing all sorts of crazy stuff,

1080
00:52:21.929 --> 00:52:24.129
going up, going down, but on average it's kind

1081
00:52:24.129 --> 00:52:27.129
of straight, and then in late life, it, it

1082
00:52:27.129 --> 00:52:30.489
declines a bit and I've, I find that one,

1083
00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:32.850
it's wonderful that you become less anxious, but I

1084
00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:35.959
often focus on that. Because there's a bunch of

1085
00:52:35.959 --> 00:52:39.879
theories about what happens um as you get older

1086
00:52:39.879 --> 00:52:41.469
and as you think that you might not live

1087
00:52:41.469 --> 00:52:46.409
forever and that you're gonna die soon, um. And

1088
00:52:46.409 --> 00:52:49.229
there's, there's theories about like, oh, when that happens.

1089
00:52:50.159 --> 00:52:53.000
You tend to prioritize stuff that gives your life

1090
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.320
meaning and positive motion, and it turns out that

1091
00:52:57.679 --> 00:53:01.360
one of the primary things is that close relationships

1092
00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.790
provide us with that stuff, a sense of meaning,

1093
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:08.100
a sense of structure, um. Now, there's been challenges

1094
00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.219
to that theory as well, uh, you know, they

1095
00:53:10.219 --> 00:53:12.699
say not everybody has that experience. It depends a

1096
00:53:12.699 --> 00:53:14.179
little bit on your, what you lived your whole

1097
00:53:14.179 --> 00:53:17.620
life, what your older adult years look like, like

1098
00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:21.020
how sick you are. Um, BUT there's a sense

1099
00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.090
in which, towards the end of life, people really

1100
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:26.340
prioritize kind of the emotional meaning that close relationships

1101
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:31.040
give. And avoidance often interferes with that. So what

1102
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.239
we see at this general level is that people

1103
00:53:33.239 --> 00:53:37.060
decline, uh, when they get really, really old, uh,

1104
00:53:37.229 --> 00:53:39.830
in their avoidance, despite on average it looking like

1105
00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:42.679
they never change. Um, IT looks like people change

1106
00:53:42.679 --> 00:53:45.750
more for this, uh, kind of later in life.

1107
00:53:45.879 --> 00:53:47.959
Most people change a lot in younger adulthood, it's

1108
00:53:47.959 --> 00:53:50.139
the time at which people change the most actually,

1109
00:53:50.239 --> 00:53:53.030
across all personality traits. If you're younger, that's, that's

1110
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:55.770
when you're changing, um. But then you see this

1111
00:53:55.770 --> 00:54:00.520
weird, maybe underappreciated thing where people keep changing, uh,

1112
00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:02.889
as they get later into life. So that that's

1113
00:54:02.889 --> 00:54:05.169
a very long story. So people mostly mellow out,

1114
00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:08.399
they get less anxious. And then avoidance, it looks

1115
00:54:08.399 --> 00:54:11.560
like doesn't change as dramatically, but then maybe when

1116
00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.719
people get older, they become more secure in that

1117
00:54:13.719 --> 00:54:15.239
regard, they become a little less avoidant.

1118
00:54:16.429 --> 00:54:20.209
You mentioned attachment and anxiety there, can it lead

1119
00:54:20.209 --> 00:54:24.100
to memory errors, and if so, how would that

1120
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.729
impact relationships?

1121
00:54:26.189 --> 00:54:29.689
Yeah, so that's one of the reasons why attachment

1122
00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:34.030
or anxiously attached people sometimes struggle with relationships. They,

1123
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:37.800
they do some things that, Um, also kind of

1124
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.149
compromise their relationships, but we've, we tend to focus

1125
00:54:40.149 --> 00:54:43.659
on how they make meaning about relationships and how

1126
00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:48.429
they remember things, um, so yeah, there's a, that,

1127
00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:50.669
that research in particular was inspired by a few

1128
00:54:50.669 --> 00:54:54.129
different things. So one was, um, These two studies,

1129
00:54:54.209 --> 00:54:55.689
one was by Burke Feeney and the other was

1130
00:54:55.689 --> 00:54:57.989
by Jeff Simpson and a few other people where

1131
00:54:59.219 --> 00:55:00.820
In both studies, it, it was sort of similar

1132
00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.580
where they would have people fight, uh, or argue

1133
00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:06.860
about something. It's really sadistic. Relationship researchers say, what

1134
00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:08.459
are the things you fight about? AND then they'll

1135
00:55:08.459 --> 00:55:10.919
ask you to fight about them. It's really sad.

1136
00:55:11.209 --> 00:55:13.419
Um, SO what they'll do is they, they'll have

1137
00:55:13.419 --> 00:55:17.459
them fight and then they'll argue. Discuss a problem.

1138
00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:20.679
And uh then they'll ask, hey, how bad was

1139
00:55:20.679 --> 00:55:22.520
that, how negative was that? How much do you

1140
00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:25.520
like your partner right now? Um, AND then they

1141
00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.320
do this amazing thing where they'll basically just wait

1142
00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.280
a month, and then they'll ask them again, and

1143
00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.030
then they'll wait, wait another month and they'll ask

1144
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:34.850
them again, again about the same thing. And what

1145
00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:37.629
they find is that uh anxiously attached people remember

1146
00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:41.010
the interaction as being worse than it actually was.

1147
00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:45.370
Um, SO again, like, we had your ratings when

1148
00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:47.290
the fight happened. We know how upset you were,

1149
00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.850
we know how angry you were and how awful

1150
00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:52.429
you thought it was. And over time, anxious people

1151
00:55:52.429 --> 00:55:54.659
just remember it being much and much worse, like

1152
00:55:54.659 --> 00:55:57.659
the more you ask them. Um, SO we, we

1153
00:55:57.659 --> 00:56:01.709
think that like, so the theory is that Anxious

1154
00:56:01.709 --> 00:56:06.239
people interpret. And like reconsolidate memories in a way

1155
00:56:06.239 --> 00:56:08.320
that fits with what they think about the world.

1156
00:56:08.439 --> 00:56:09.800
So if they think that their partner is a

1157
00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:13.879
jerk or unreliable or not in sync with them,

1158
00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.350
over time, like their cognitive biases will kind of

1159
00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:21.080
structure that, uh, accordingly. And then so that's, that's

1160
00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.449
where we kind of came in and We wanted

1161
00:56:23.449 --> 00:56:26.679
to know like exactly when these kind of memory

1162
00:56:26.679 --> 00:56:30.050
processes are introduced. Um, SO we've done these studies

1163
00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:34.540
too, where we'll just show people, um, Kind of

1164
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:38.320
relationship content like someone talking about a breakup, um,

1165
00:56:38.659 --> 00:56:42.489
and, uh, then we'll say only show them, uh,

1166
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:44.449
or only provide them the audio, so they're like

1167
00:56:44.449 --> 00:56:46.899
listening to a story, or sometimes it's like a

1168
00:56:46.899 --> 00:56:49.320
YouTube video where they'll watch the whole thing and

1169
00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.379
hear it, um, and we find that, yeah, like

1170
00:56:53.379 --> 00:56:57.860
anxious people embellish stuff that didn't happen, so, you

1171
00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:01.060
know, they'll listen to the story. And then we'll

1172
00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:05.080
say, hey, um, Here's a checklist of stuff that

1173
00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.350
happened in in the story. So the story might

1174
00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:10.580
be something as simple as like, I broke up

1175
00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:12.679
with my partner cause they were a jerk, uh,

1176
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.830
they never listened to me, and we would say,

1177
00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.399
ask the anxious person like, oh, did they break

1178
00:57:18.399 --> 00:57:19.840
up? Yes or no? And they would say yes,

1179
00:57:19.919 --> 00:57:22.040
and then, uh, did they break up because they

1180
00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.590
thought they were a jerk, and the anxious person

1181
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:25.560
would be like, yes. Uh, AND then we'd be

1182
00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.919
like, did they break up because one person cheated

1183
00:57:27.919 --> 00:57:29.270
on the other, and anxious people would be like,

1184
00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:32.290
yes, even though I didn't tell you that, right?

1185
00:57:32.389 --> 00:57:36.030
That wasn't part of the story. Um, SO, but,

1186
00:57:36.239 --> 00:57:38.659
you know, that stuff, that stuff is really interesting

1187
00:57:38.659 --> 00:57:41.600
because In those studies, we found that it only

1188
00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:44.280
really affected people when they saw the video, not

1189
00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:47.280
when they were just listening to it. Um, AND

1190
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:51.399
it's this really, really fascinating, um, work where anxious

1191
00:57:51.399 --> 00:57:54.760
people get really overloaded by sensory input, especially about

1192
00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:58.760
relationships. So there's something about like watching someone tell

1193
00:57:58.919 --> 00:58:01.959
a story about a relationship and attending to their

1194
00:58:01.959 --> 00:58:04.679
facial expressions, or if they smile or frown or

1195
00:58:04.679 --> 00:58:08.770
if they're crying. That that leads kind of anxious

1196
00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:11.209
people to embellish stories or add things that didn't

1197
00:58:11.209 --> 00:58:14.570
didn't happen. Um, SO yeah, it, it turns out

1198
00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:17.250
that it looks like they can imbue stories with

1199
00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:21.409
false memories. Some people also selectively forget things, so

1200
00:58:21.409 --> 00:58:25.610
there's some work that avoiding people, um, We'll forget

1201
00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:29.100
relationship words, but not like other non-relationship words, like

1202
00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:31.139
they have this bias where it's not encoding it

1203
00:58:31.139 --> 00:58:34.729
or retrieving it. Um, BUT it's part of this

1204
00:58:34.739 --> 00:58:36.770
really, really exciting corner of our research where we

1205
00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:40.080
look at how kind of relationships shape your memories.

1206
00:58:40.219 --> 00:58:43.479
So, we even have some stuff where we have

1207
00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:48.620
people reporting on, um, really adverse childhood circumstances, like

1208
00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:51.820
if they, um, You know, parents would yell at

1209
00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:54.540
them, or spank them, or kind of even hit

1210
00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:57.669
them. And we did this really interesting study where

1211
00:58:57.669 --> 00:58:59.909
we asked people a bunch of times about their

1212
00:58:59.909 --> 00:59:02.070
early relationships, and it turns out their memories of

1213
00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:05.310
those things changed. Uh, AND it usually changed as

1214
00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:06.870
a function of stuff that was happening to them.

1215
00:59:06.989 --> 00:59:10.199
So like, If your relationships with your parents improve,

1216
00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:14.320
you kind of selectively remember fewer times in which

1217
00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:15.669
they were mean to you in the past. And

1218
00:59:15.669 --> 00:59:17.199
of course, the past is set in stone, it

1219
00:59:17.199 --> 00:59:20.840
doesn't change. Um, JUST like when we show people

1220
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.800
these videos, the content doesn't change, but kind of

1221
00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.280
how you remember it, how you make sense of

1222
00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:28.800
it, um, does change, and it maybe depends on

1223
00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.120
stuff that you're thinking about. And that, that's something

1224
00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:34.239
that's consistent across all sorts of things. So, if

1225
00:59:34.239 --> 00:59:37.110
you remember A really tough part of your life.

1226
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.679
There's a way in which you might not be

1227
00:59:38.679 --> 00:59:42.389
remembering it super objectively, right? Like, um, you know,

1228
00:59:42.479 --> 00:59:45.800
one famous thing is that we kind of minimize

1229
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:48.790
how much we were responsible for bad stuff that

1230
00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:51.909
happens, um, you know, we're the hero in our

1231
00:59:51.909 --> 00:59:55.570
own stories sometimes, and, um. We see that with

1232
00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:57.780
relationships too, especially with stuff that you think wouldn't

1233
00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:01.360
change, like you remembering stuff about your childhood, um,

1234
01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.439
but it's way more variable than people appreciate, so,

1235
01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:07.659
um, you know, that's why the memory stuff is

1236
01:00:07.659 --> 01:00:10.889
so fascinating. So people will Add stuff that didn't

1237
01:00:10.889 --> 01:00:13.409
happen, remember stuff is worse than it was, or

1238
01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:16.820
like, They might tell you your childhood was worse

1239
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.179
or happier than it actually was, and that answer

1240
01:00:19.179 --> 01:00:22.780
might change from month to month. So, um, you

1241
01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.580
know, there's some stable components like, like I grew

1242
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.570
up in Chicago, like that's something that I could

1243
01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:30.320
tell you and I'll likely remember and doesn't change,

1244
01:00:30.439 --> 01:00:32.879
but You know, then we have these other things

1245
01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:38.070
where people will perceive and reflect on relationships in

1246
01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:41.000
really fascinating ways, and that's one thing why I'm

1247
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.199
just so excited about relationship science. It's, you know,

1248
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.080
a lot of it is other people matter in

1249
01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.320
our lives, and they're hugely influential, but sometimes they're

1250
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.229
not as influential in the ways you think. And

1251
01:00:51.229 --> 01:00:54.239
then even if they are influential and supportive, maybe

1252
01:00:54.239 --> 01:00:58.120
you don't remember that perfectly, um, and maybe it's

1253
01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.000
not as influencing you in the ways that you

1254
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.879
think, and, um, Relationships are so like befuddling and

1255
01:01:03.879 --> 01:01:07.270
fascinating to me, and um Yeah, I mean, it's

1256
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:08.790
been really, really fun talking to you about it

1257
01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:12.030
because there's so many different moving components, um, and

1258
01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:13.550
yeah, I'm, I'm just obsessed with it. I, I

1259
01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:16.149
really love doing it and that's, yeah, there's so

1260
01:01:16.149 --> 01:01:18.250
many fun things about people and their relationships.

1261
01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:21.560
Great. So let me just ask you one last

1262
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:27.439
question then. DOES attachment style influence relationship satisfaction, and

1263
01:01:27.439 --> 01:01:29.520
if so, in what ways?

1264
01:01:29.879 --> 01:01:32.280
Yeah, I, I think so. So, again, there's been

1265
01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.959
a lot of studies where that'll just correlate the

1266
01:01:33.959 --> 01:01:36.739
two, and they'll find that anxious and avoidant people

1267
01:01:36.739 --> 01:01:40.320
are less satisfied. Um, BUT then there's a, there's

1268
01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.800
a few different reasons why it does predict it

1269
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.479
over time. So yeah, it does kind of shape

1270
01:01:45.479 --> 01:01:49.889
how people experience relationship satisfaction. You know, some is

1271
01:01:49.889 --> 01:01:52.449
that, you know, anxious people really really worry, really

1272
01:01:52.449 --> 01:01:55.280
worry about if partners will be available, and that's

1273
01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.169
usually not a good recipe if you don't think

1274
01:01:57.169 --> 01:02:00.919
your partner is kind of a reliable rock. Um,

1275
01:02:01.169 --> 01:02:05.010
AND then avoidant people are really uncomfortable with emotional

1276
01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:08.649
and physical in empathy. Um, SO, even when they

1277
01:02:08.649 --> 01:02:10.850
find themselves in relationships, they might not be super

1278
01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:14.780
happy with their lives, um. But again, like, if

1279
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:19.100
you're, you know, emotionally distant, uh, don't kind of

1280
01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.090
engage in kind of the more intimate aspects of

1281
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:23.979
relationships, if you're not super lovey-dovey, you know, there's

1282
01:02:23.979 --> 01:02:25.580
a sense in which you might not find it

1283
01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:28.919
super enjoyable when a partner is that way. Um,

1284
01:02:29.459 --> 01:02:31.580
SO it's, you know, it's interesting, there, there are

1285
01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:34.679
certain relationships that work for anxious and avoidant people,

1286
01:02:35.179 --> 01:02:38.120
um, you know, sometimes it works for them. Sometimes

1287
01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.659
it changes them to be more secure, and then

1288
01:02:40.719 --> 01:02:42.620
that relationship works for them, you know, it makes

1289
01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.120
them a little bit more receptive to the type

1290
01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.439
of relationship they're in. Um, YEAH, so there's a

1291
01:02:48.439 --> 01:02:50.159
sense in which like it does shape how we

1292
01:02:50.159 --> 01:02:52.959
experience relationships, but then a lot of our work

1293
01:02:52.959 --> 01:02:56.699
is how relationships shape how we view them and

1294
01:02:56.699 --> 01:02:59.080
how our personality. So, but there is a sense

1295
01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:02.080
in which we think it's bidirectional where, yeah, it

1296
01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.439
shapes your experience, but then there are maybe some

1297
01:03:04.439 --> 01:03:07.199
things your partner's doing that Might make you think

1298
01:03:07.199 --> 01:03:10.310
differently about the world, or think differently about relationships.

1299
01:03:10.689 --> 01:03:14.169
Um, AND it's really, really challenging to do. You

1300
01:03:14.169 --> 01:03:17.590
need, like, really long-term data, you sometimes need people

1301
01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.250
across multiple relationships, which is really hard. Um, BUT

1302
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.929
we view it as really important cause I think

1303
01:03:23.929 --> 01:03:26.810
some people will, or we've actually asked people if

1304
01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:28.810
they wanted to change the relationships, if they want

1305
01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:32.129
to become more securely attached. And it's something that

1306
01:03:32.129 --> 01:03:35.469
people say that they want, um, And then the,

1307
01:03:35.689 --> 01:03:37.610
the big question moving forward is like, how do

1308
01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:39.929
we achieve that? How do we give people actual

1309
01:03:39.929 --> 01:03:42.209
things? What do we tell their partner to do

1310
01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:45.510
or not do to kind of help transform them?

1311
01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:48.449
Um, AND we don't have a really great solution

1312
01:03:48.449 --> 01:03:49.639
right now, but we're working on it.

1313
01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.320
Great. So, Doctor Chopik, just before we go, would

1314
01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.600
you like to tell people where they can find

1315
01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.310
your work on the internet?

1316
01:03:58.719 --> 01:04:00.560
Yeah, for sure. So, uh, yeah, I work at

1317
01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.760
Michigan State University. We have a lab website called

1318
01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.909
the Chopic Lab.com. Really humble, really not egotistical at

1319
01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:10.800
all. It's Chopiclab.com. And, uh, you'll be able to

1320
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.889
see the stuff we're working on, uh, paper, a

1321
01:04:13.889 --> 01:04:16.310
copy of the papers we published, and then also

1322
01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:17.959
learn a lot about kind of what the students

1323
01:04:17.959 --> 01:04:20.199
and mentees are working on as well. So. Yeah,

1324
01:04:20.239 --> 01:04:22.199
I encourage people to check that out, and yeah,

1325
01:04:22.239 --> 01:04:23.479
it's really great talking with you.

1326
01:04:24.219 --> 01:04:26.449
Yeah, really fun talking with you. Thank you so
