00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.170
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.630
the Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.109
and to the Mgen by Doctor Mary Schenk. She

4
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.319
is associate professor of Anthropology, demography, and Asian studies

5
00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:16.739
at Pennsylvania State University. She is a biocultural anthropologist,

6
00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:21.469
human behavior. ECOLOGIST and anthropological demographer with interests in

7
00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:26.790
marriage, family, kinship, parental investment, fertility, mortality, and inequality

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.870
and some other topics. And today we're going to

9
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.619
focus mostly on the sexual division of labor, kinship

10
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.959
systems, religion and fertility, and fertility decline, and some

11
00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:39.790
other related topics. So, Doctor Shenk, welcome to the

12
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.220
show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:43.509
It's a pleasure to be here, Ricardo.

14
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.909
So, I would like to start by asking you

15
00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.900
a little bit about the sexual division of labor.

16
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.270
So from an evolutionary perspective, how do you approach

17
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.069
it? I mean, how do we start here? Where

18
00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:58.180
does it stem from?

19
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.520
So there's a couple of different um types of

20
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.730
arguments from, for sexual division of labor, and this

21
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.010
is an area of interest of mine, but it's

22
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.449
not my central area of interest. Um, BUT I

23
00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:16.129
would say there's one argument for the sexual division

24
00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:21.529
of labor comes from Um, literature focusing on the

25
00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:25.809
different kinds of constraints that men and women have

26
00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:29.209
with respect to children. So, because women have to

27
00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:33.489
go through gestation and lactation, they're often directly responsible

28
00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:36.290
for young children, and especially in the human past,

29
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.449
they could have had multiple young children at one

30
00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:42.169
time. Um, TO take care of. And because of

31
00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:45.330
that, there's often been an argument that this restricts

32
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.449
women from doing tasks that involve spending a long

33
00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:53.129
time away from their kids, um, or where places

34
00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:55.089
where you have to, you can't take your kids

35
00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:58.809
with you, right? And so, that's one kind of

36
00:01:58.809 --> 00:02:02.430
argument, whereas men don't have those same restrictions biologically.

37
00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:05.970
So this is one underpinning for the sexual division

38
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.000
of labor. The other underpinning really comes from Economic

39
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.190
theories of complementarity in which you see um Any

40
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.869
kind of, uh, that any group of people, whether

41
00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:23.350
they're men or women or anything else, um, could

42
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.350
have some people who specialize in one thing and

43
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.550
other people who specialize in another thing and by

44
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.070
cooperating and sharing, they're actually better off than if

45
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.669
everyone is trying to do the same thing because

46
00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.389
you can get um more efficient at doing particular

47
00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.910
tasks by specializing or practicing those tasks for long

48
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.050
periods of time. And so the arguments about the

49
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.699
sexual division of labor in human history usually involve

50
00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.699
one or both of these things. Usually that there's

51
00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:55.139
some kind of complementarity where some people should specialize

52
00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.100
in one thing and other people should specialize in

53
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.779
other things, and that because of these underlying um

54
00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:06.619
biological obligations that women have as mammals for um

55
00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.380
gestation and lactation, you end up in a situation

56
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.389
where women are often specializing in tasks. That um

57
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.399
have less conflict with childcare than um men who

58
00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.119
can who often specialize in tasks that have more

59
00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:25.130
conflict with childcare. That's frequently true in human societies,

60
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.350
but we can all see with childcare, um, Inputs

61
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.149
from other group members, etc. YOU actually can have

62
00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.899
a lot of variation across cultures, um, in, in

63
00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:37.789
the sexual division of labor. Yeah.

64
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.389
Mhm. And I mean, in terms of the specific

65
00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.600
tasks that we see cross-culturally being the most commonly

66
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.800
performed by men and women and that point to

67
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.479
a sexual division of labor, could you give us

68
00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:57.080
perhaps some examples to illustrate what you just said

69
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.839
there? Sure, sure. So in many foraging societies, at

70
00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:04.210
least the traditional view was that men were often

71
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.270
specialized in hunting and women were often specialized in.

72
00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:12.850
Um, GATHERING plant materials. And you see that on

73
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.279
average across most foraging cultures that we have data

74
00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.809
on, this is true, but you also see that

75
00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:21.928
women are also hunting, and many of them, especially

76
00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:25.250
hunting small game, um, and that men are often

77
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.519
doing gathering as well as hunting. So it's more

78
00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:31.010
of an average difference than a, like a very

79
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.890
strict difference because as I'm sure you're aware, given

80
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.480
um Uh, what you do, um, there's a huge

81
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.760
amount of variation across human societies based on local

82
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.799
ecologies. So in foragers, we would have thought of

83
00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:47.600
hunting and gathering, but again, more as an average

84
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.799
difference than a sliding scale because of course, women

85
00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:53.279
are sometimes hunting and men are sometimes gathering also.

86
00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:59.209
Um, IN horticulture and agriculture, um, how much labor

87
00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:02.649
women versus men do tends to, um, be about

88
00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:06.290
the kind of labor rather than specializations. So if

89
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.239
we're thinking about horticulture. In many horticultural societies, men

90
00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:14.570
might focus on clearing the land and like taking

91
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.970
down the trees and moving large stones, and women

92
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.609
might be spending more time gardening, but men are

93
00:05:19.609 --> 00:05:25.089
also gardening too. Um, AND in agriculture, there's a

94
00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:29.720
lot of cross-cultural patterns, um, that suggest that it

95
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.000
kind of really depends on the type of labor.

96
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.519
So there is, um, I work in South Asia,

97
00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:37.369
so in the Indian subcontinent. And one of the

98
00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:41.890
really well-known historical relationships there is between wheat agriculture

99
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.170
and uh rice agriculture. And wheat agriculture um has

100
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.850
often been focused on plows as one of the

101
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.730
major things and planting and a lot of the

102
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.519
field work, more of the field work was done

103
00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:57.640
by men than women. The women were also involved

104
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.250
in the harvest and other times. Whereas rice agriculture

105
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.369
historically, um, because it's so intensive in terms of

106
00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:07.450
the planting, you have to hand plant all of

107
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.010
these tiny plants, and then you have to replant

108
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.010
them, etc. A lot of it has to be

109
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.049
done by, by hand. You saw a lot more

110
00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:18.420
agricultural labor by women in those parts of the,

111
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.920
of South Asia with the argument that in fact,

112
00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:25.130
um some of the social systems in those regions

113
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.730
were affected by this difference in the kind of

114
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.559
agricultural labor that was needed.

115
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.010
Mhm. So, I think that what you mentioned, there

116
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:40.109
are primarily economic and ecological factors. Are there all

117
00:06:40.109 --> 00:06:44.329
social, social influences that operate on the sexual division

118
00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:44.959
of labor?

119
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.179
Absolutely, there are um social influences. Again, my background

120
00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:52.660
is in behavioral ecology, so I tend to start

121
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.859
with what are the ecological variations. So what's the,

122
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.760
what's going on with the environment and what kind

123
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.609
of subsistence practice are you engaged in. And then

124
00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:04.380
thinking more about the economic system that's built on

125
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.940
top of that, and then I tend to think

126
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.980
about the social system as being built on top

127
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.820
of that. So one of the um One of

128
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.260
the um pieces of research that one of my

129
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.660
PhD students, um, Doctor Catherine Starkweather, who's now at

130
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.799
the University of Illinois Chicago, has done, she was

131
00:07:20.799 --> 00:07:22.339
working in one of the field sites where I've

132
00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:24.829
worked for a long time in rural Bangladesh, and

133
00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:27.730
she's worked with a group of people who are,

134
00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:32.459
um, live on boats, and um they have different

135
00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:34.709
kinds of work that they're doing, but a lot

136
00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:36.540
of times they're fishing, most of the men are

137
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.829
fishing. And a lot of times women are fishing

138
00:07:38.829 --> 00:07:42.459
with their husbands, but sometimes the women are trading

139
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.230
instead, which is a somewhat unusual thing cross cultural.

140
00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:48.309
There's examples in West Africa, there's examples in Southeast

141
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:51.950
Asia, where women are frequently involved in trade, um,

142
00:07:51.989 --> 00:07:53.420
though in other parts of the world, it's often

143
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.790
the opposite. Um, AND in that particular area, there's

144
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.709
this interesting cultural convention in which these show to

145
00:08:01.709 --> 00:08:05.989
our women can actually go and trade with local

146
00:08:05.989 --> 00:08:09.790
women outside of their group, um, because there's a

147
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.989
social taboo on men going into the homes of

148
00:08:12.989 --> 00:08:15.989
other women and trading with other women. And so

149
00:08:15.989 --> 00:08:19.190
these women, there's a, because of the social convention,

150
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.320
they have a, a kind of a socio-ecological niche

151
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.010
in which they're able to trade. Um, WITH other

152
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.959
women that presents uh an economic opportunity for them

153
00:08:30.329 --> 00:08:33.530
that is uncommon in that culture, but it's also

154
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.130
uncommon cross culturally and so many women then will

155
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.359
go and trade. In the dry season, and they're

156
00:08:40.359 --> 00:08:42.359
spending all their time away from home and their

157
00:08:42.359 --> 00:08:46.440
husbands and uh relatives are watching their children, but

158
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.080
usually when they have very young children, they don't

159
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.159
go to trade because you can't drag an infant

160
00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:54.479
with you for 12 hours a day walking with

161
00:08:54.479 --> 00:08:56.719
large packs on your head and taking buses and

162
00:08:56.719 --> 00:08:59.119
doing all this stuff. Um, YEAH.

163
00:09:00.909 --> 00:09:04.479
So, but, but also, if I understand it correctly,

164
00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:07.960
it's not just the kinds of activities that men

165
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.559
or women tend to participate in, but there's also

166
00:09:11.559 --> 00:09:17.599
across different societies, more or higher or lower degrees

167
00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:21.510
of overlap between men and women when it comes

168
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.030
to the activities they participate in. Is that correct?

169
00:09:25.359 --> 00:09:27.719
Absolutely. So, I mean, I was giving the example

170
00:09:27.719 --> 00:09:32.159
earlier of hunting and gathering. And so, um, where

171
00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:34.919
you often see on average men are doing more

172
00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:37.679
hunting and then women are on average are doing

173
00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:40.320
more gathering, but that's not true in all cases.

174
00:09:40.599 --> 00:09:43.200
There's a lot of overlap. So you're right, one

175
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.510
of the big differences across cultures is how much

176
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.489
of a sexual division of labor you see. So

177
00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:52.960
one of the things that's really interesting in modern

178
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.530
um wage labor economies, so sort of the modern

179
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.409
global market economies where you have a lot of

180
00:10:00.409 --> 00:10:05.049
education-based jobs that you see less division of labor

181
00:10:05.049 --> 00:10:07.010
for certain kinds of jobs than you used to

182
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:11.900
do um in the past, um. Both because it

183
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.830
becomes possible for families to have people who are

184
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.489
specialized in different things because you're getting so much

185
00:10:18.489 --> 00:10:20.659
of your food from the market through money and

186
00:10:20.659 --> 00:10:23.090
it doesn't exactly matter how you're getting the money.

187
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.760
But also because um So much of the, the

188
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.890
labor that otherwise one or the other parent might

189
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.659
be doing is actually being done. You know, by

190
00:10:35.659 --> 00:10:37.979
daycare centers or in the market or things that

191
00:10:37.979 --> 00:10:40.940
are pay you pay for food, right? And sometimes

192
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.580
you can pay people to cook your food too.

193
00:10:42.619 --> 00:10:45.500
And so there's a lot of um You see

194
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.099
a lot of difference and so you see a

195
00:10:47.099 --> 00:10:52.500
lot more um Potential for reductions in uh sexual

196
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.380
divisions of labor in market economies than you have

197
00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.700
in other kinds of um contexts.

198
00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:03.940
Mhm. So, I would like to ask you now

199
00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.710
about some of your work on kinship systems. So,

200
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.739
first of all, tell us, generally, what are kinship

201
00:11:11.739 --> 00:11:14.979
systems and what kinds of questions do you tend

202
00:11:14.979 --> 00:11:17.020
to be more interested in when it comes to

203
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:17.260
them?

204
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.780
So kinship systems are um a fairly, I mean,

205
00:11:22.869 --> 00:11:26.150
all animals have potentially kinship systems in the sense

206
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.349
that they live in groups, if they live in

207
00:11:28.349 --> 00:11:30.109
groups at all, they may are likely to live

208
00:11:30.109 --> 00:11:32.229
in groups with more or less kin, and the

209
00:11:32.229 --> 00:11:34.830
kin is more related to females versus males in

210
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:39.270
a group. So, in most primate societies, it's more

211
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.229
common that you see that females will stay in

212
00:11:41.229 --> 00:11:44.460
a group together and males will move between groups.

213
00:11:44.469 --> 00:11:49.080
Um, Chimpanzees, for example, are quite interestingly different in

214
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.549
the fact that um the males stay in groups

215
00:11:51.549 --> 00:11:55.030
together and do some social cooperation, and then females

216
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:59.440
will move to new groups. And um Humans are

217
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.270
particularly interesting kinship wise, because We have what Bernard

218
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.849
Chappe and others have identified as we have both

219
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:12.429
a dissent system like we know over time, you

220
00:12:12.429 --> 00:12:16.070
know, who you're related to, like, you know, your

221
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.719
mothers or your fathers and their family, and you're

222
00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:21.309
you often not always living with one side or

223
00:12:21.309 --> 00:12:24.710
the other. Um, BUT then you also, we also

224
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:29.229
have, um, systems of affiliation through marriage, and because

225
00:12:29.229 --> 00:12:32.109
of that, we often create new relatives through marriage

226
00:12:32.109 --> 00:12:34.229
and new kinship ties through marriage, and so we

227
00:12:34.229 --> 00:12:37.710
have both a kind of a dissent systems and

228
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.309
also what various people have referred to as alliance

229
00:12:40.309 --> 00:12:43.109
systems through marriage. And um a lot of people

230
00:12:43.109 --> 00:12:47.070
have argued that, um, particularly Robin Fox and Bernard

231
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.619
Chape that, you know, primate. Other primates tend to

232
00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:52.340
have one or the other more or less, and

233
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.940
we have both, and we have very elaborated versions

234
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.690
of both descent and alliance. And so kinship systems,

235
00:12:59.729 --> 00:13:02.530
um, there's a whole bunch of different factors. A

236
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.369
lot of them are about who do you say

237
00:13:05.369 --> 00:13:09.969
you're more, you're biologically related equally to your mother

238
00:13:09.969 --> 00:13:12.530
and father, right, and your mothers and fathers kin.

239
00:13:13.049 --> 00:13:16.229
But for the purposes of cooperation in different socio

240
00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:21.090
ecological circumstances, humans have different systems where you have

241
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:25.250
lineage systems that are either often patrilineal, where dissent

242
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.440
is reckoned through the male line. And you're cooperating

243
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.000
with relatives who are reckoned through the male line,

244
00:13:31.409 --> 00:13:35.210
or matrilineal systems in which you're cooperating with relatives

245
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.570
reckon through the female line instead. There's a lot

246
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.369
of patterns about how this is, um, how this

247
00:13:41.369 --> 00:13:46.159
varies cross-culturally. There's a lot of flexibility in hunter-gatherers.

248
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.169
In horticulturalists, we see a lot of patrilineal and

249
00:13:49.169 --> 00:13:53.849
matrilineal systems. The pastoralist systems tend to be more

250
00:13:53.849 --> 00:14:00.010
strongly, um, patrilineal. And agricultural systems, sort of one

251
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.530
or the other, and then when we start to

252
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:06.909
get to Um, intensive agriculture and inheritance of land,

253
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.169
and also in market economies, you tend to see,

254
00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:14.119
uh, this, a shift in those contexts to smaller

255
00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:18.390
groups of kin, um, smaller lineage systems and or

256
00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:21.880
the kind of lack of a lineage system altogether

257
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.919
in what we call bilateral kinship, which is a

258
00:14:23.919 --> 00:14:27.119
kinship system that's often sometimes referred to as a

259
00:14:27.119 --> 00:14:30.599
Euro-American system, at least Euro-American system from the past

260
00:14:30.599 --> 00:14:33.960
couple of centuries in which you have Your kin

261
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.130
or reckoned through both the male and female line,

262
00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:40.239
and you're kind of equally interacting with, with um

263
00:14:40.239 --> 00:14:42.359
both sets of relatives. So there's a bunch of

264
00:14:42.359 --> 00:14:44.760
different kinships and again, like, the systems tend to

265
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.390
vary a lot by ecology.

266
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.229
Mhm. Yeah, I want to ask you a little

267
00:14:49.229 --> 00:14:52.390
bit about those ecological factors, but just before that,

268
00:14:52.539 --> 00:14:55.789
just to tackle a little bit more the terminology

269
00:14:55.789 --> 00:15:00.000
here, when people talk about, for example, Matrilocal or

270
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.989
patrilocal societies, what they mean by that is the

271
00:15:03.989 --> 00:15:06.590
side of your family that you tend to live

272
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.219
with.

273
00:15:07.359 --> 00:15:11.619
Right. Yes, and specifically, anthropologists often refer to those

274
00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:15.109
terms as relating to post-marital residents. So in other

275
00:15:15.109 --> 00:15:16.640
words, the side of the family that you tend

276
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.820
to live with, but usually people switch residences at

277
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.539
marriage if they're going to switch residents. And so

278
00:15:22.539 --> 00:15:25.940
patrolocal, so if it's a, so patrolocal would mean

279
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.260
that you would go as a, as a bride,

280
00:15:28.349 --> 00:15:29.820
as a wife, you would go to live with

281
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.359
your husband's kin. And natural local typically would refer

282
00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:35.520
to a situation in which you go to live

283
00:15:35.799 --> 00:15:37.640
with the wife's skin, the husband comes to live

284
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.869
with the wife's kin. There's also an, a common

285
00:15:40.869 --> 00:15:44.559
residence practice called neo-local residence in which the, the

286
00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:48.880
couple creates a new household for themselves either sort

287
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.599
of near one of the others or in a

288
00:15:50.599 --> 00:15:53.200
completely new place. And then that's, that's commonly true.

289
00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:57.320
And then there's some either um rarer forms in

290
00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.859
which um People don't really establish a long-term residence

291
00:16:01.859 --> 00:16:03.619
with one set of kin or the other, and

292
00:16:03.619 --> 00:16:05.299
they might go to live with one and then

293
00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:09.659
another. So, for example, multi-locality and many foraging groups,

294
00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.330
you might live with one group for a while,

295
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.659
but then you often may be moving over time

296
00:16:13.659 --> 00:16:16.419
with other groups, and then there's some places where

297
00:16:16.419 --> 00:16:20.500
you can choose where you're moving. But um a

298
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.580
lot of people would make a distinction between systems

299
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:27.690
of um dissent, where we're reckoning either through the

300
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.369
male line or the female line or both. So

301
00:16:30.369 --> 00:16:35.320
that would be patrilineal, matrilineal or um bilateral or

302
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.710
and then residents, which is usually like where we're

303
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.340
moving typically after marriage or as adults, um, and

304
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.969
frequently they're correlated with each other, but they're not

305
00:16:44.969 --> 00:16:48.609
always. So sometimes you actually have unique situations in

306
00:16:48.609 --> 00:16:53.330
which you have dissent is, you know, patrilineal, but

307
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.609
lots of people are living natural locally, but those

308
00:16:55.609 --> 00:16:57.409
are unusual, but you do see that kind of

309
00:16:57.409 --> 00:16:57.650
thing.

310
00:16:58.979 --> 00:17:02.039
But is it, uh, I mean, looking across the

311
00:17:02.039 --> 00:17:06.400
societies we have studied, do we see, for example,

312
00:17:06.479 --> 00:17:10.680
patterns, is it that, for example, one of these

313
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.160
uh sort of kin kinship systems, the patrilineal or

314
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.280
the matrilineal, for example, is more common than the

315
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.560
other or not?

316
00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.670
Yes, yes. So in humans, we have a lot

317
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:26.608
more examples uh in um In the extant ethnographic

318
00:17:26.608 --> 00:17:28.880
record, that is the record that we have from

319
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.979
um ethnographic and historical documents from the past 2

320
00:17:31.979 --> 00:17:35.270
or 3 centuries, maybe 4 or 5 centuries, um,

321
00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.489
that patrilineal systems are much more common than matrilineal

322
00:17:39.489 --> 00:17:43.890
systems, but, um, as I've written, um, in, we

323
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:47.609
have a paper in Philoical transactions of the Royal

324
00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:52.390
Society with some colleagues in 2019. We, one of

325
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:55.510
the arguments that we've made is that in part,

326
00:17:55.989 --> 00:17:59.510
that might be because of the time at which

327
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.380
in his history in which we're collecting the data.

328
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.589
So, the most common types of societies in which

329
00:18:06.589 --> 00:18:11.630
you see common matrilineal inheritance practices or matrilineal descent.

330
00:18:12.119 --> 00:18:16.520
Our horticultural systems in which um labor is done,

331
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.599
you're farming, but labor is done by hand, and

332
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:23.560
typically, you're not, um, typically you have a, it's

333
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.000
what, it's called labor limited kind of farming in

334
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.939
which you could farm more. More gardens if you

335
00:18:31.939 --> 00:18:33.489
had more people to do it, but you have,

336
00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:35.020
you don't have enough people to farm all the

337
00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.260
land. And this is a contrast with land-limited societies,

338
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.369
which we're more familiar with from Europe and Asia,

339
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.780
in which people land inheritance is very important, land

340
00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.619
is limited, um, and you have a different sort

341
00:18:50.619 --> 00:18:53.540
of social system because of that. But in horticultural

342
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:58.069
societies, we see that matrilineality is pretty common. And

343
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.650
what you find historically is that a lot of

344
00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:07.209
times the ethnographic data we have are from a

345
00:19:07.209 --> 00:19:11.640
time in history when a lot of the communities

346
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.930
might have been practicing horticulture or might have been

347
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.119
matrilineal, but then a lot of them were being

348
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:22.189
Either forcibly transitioned away from that by um colonial

349
00:19:22.189 --> 00:19:26.229
governments, or transitioning because they were becoming part of

350
00:19:26.229 --> 00:19:28.790
a global market economy with which had different sort

351
00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:33.030
of socio-ecological You know, conditions, and so they were

352
00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:36.599
changing to a more bilateral or more patrilineal system.

353
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.189
And so, we're actually examining in this paper, um,

354
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.599
what we saw in terms of transitions to and

355
00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:47.680
from matriline and what we found was that you

356
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.479
did see some legitimate examples of transitions to and

357
00:19:51.479 --> 00:19:54.020
from matroina, but that again, the whole pattern that

358
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.969
we saw with naturalin being less common. Really seemed

359
00:19:58.969 --> 00:20:01.670
like it was, might be an artifact of the

360
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.709
fact that we were collecting a lot of the

361
00:20:03.709 --> 00:20:05.910
ethnographic data in the colonial era. And if we

362
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:09.630
had been able to magically go back 1000 years

363
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.709
ago or 2000 years ago in history and just

364
00:20:11.709 --> 00:20:14.469
sample all the societies at that time, we could

365
00:20:14.469 --> 00:20:18.109
have had um a different pattern, because based on

366
00:20:18.109 --> 00:20:20.869
the different kinds of subsistence patterns that people were

367
00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:26.959
practicing around the world. But uh, Intensive agriculture uh

368
00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:30.540
tended to push things more towards patrilineality and uh

369
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:35.560
or neolo or sorry bilateral um kinship in the

370
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.599
sort of um more modern era in many parts

371
00:20:38.599 --> 00:20:39.189
of the world.

372
00:20:40.469 --> 00:20:43.979
So, it just crossed my mind in terms of

373
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:48.270
uh a particular society having uh matrilineal or a

374
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:53.310
patrilineal kinship system. Does it have any relationship at

375
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.930
all with paternity and certainty or not?

376
00:20:57.589 --> 00:21:01.150
Sure, some people have written about this. Um, ONE

377
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.900
of the arguments is that in If you're in

378
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:11.219
more patrilineal systems, you are, there's often more concern

379
00:21:11.219 --> 00:21:15.540
about enforcing paternity certainty, meaning that the father, the

380
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.099
man who's married to the woman is the father

381
00:21:18.099 --> 00:21:19.819
of that child, and that tends to be a

382
00:21:19.819 --> 00:21:24.650
strong social norm in certain kinds of societies. And

383
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:29.479
historically, I would say societies where you have um

384
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:34.170
a strong importance on inheritance, and you have land

385
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.640
limited societies where you're trying to um really keep

386
00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.650
inheritance in a particular line. Um, THOSE types of

387
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.930
societies, which have been common historically in Europe and

388
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.569
Asia, for example, and also in other parts of

389
00:21:47.569 --> 00:21:50.250
the world as well. But um those kinds of

390
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.770
societies have tended to be very concerned with paternity

391
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.949
certainty. Um, IN other parts of the world. There's

392
00:21:56.949 --> 00:22:01.229
different social relationships and so there may be less

393
00:22:01.229 --> 00:22:07.500
enforcement of paternity certainty, um. And less concern about

394
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.979
it, um, because there's other, there's other concerns that

395
00:22:10.979 --> 00:22:14.770
people have, the alliance between groups, for example, or

396
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.859
um recruitment of labor, um, in context where in

397
00:22:19.859 --> 00:22:21.979
order to really do well, you need a large

398
00:22:21.979 --> 00:22:24.500
pool of labor and a large community locally to

399
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.020
do a lot of farming and to really engage

400
00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.119
in um economic and social activities. So there's been,

401
00:22:31.209 --> 00:22:35.089
there's an argument that there's often more um of

402
00:22:35.089 --> 00:22:38.890
a focus on fraternity certainty and patrilineal context, but

403
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:44.910
that also an underlying context where um Where inheritance

404
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:47.520
is very important. Mhm.

405
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.199
So I would like to ask you, uh, still

406
00:22:50.199 --> 00:22:53.880
on the topic of kinship systems about, uh, directly

407
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.839
more about some of the work you've done on

408
00:22:55.839 --> 00:22:58.560
it. So could you tell us in what ways

409
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.920
might kinship systems relate to the distribution of material

410
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.630
resources and the rise of gender disparities?

411
00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:13.609
Sure. So, so. One of the arguments for why

412
00:23:13.609 --> 00:23:19.369
patrilineal inheritance is more common in large scale agricultural

413
00:23:19.369 --> 00:23:24.949
societies, for example, is that You're defending a group

414
00:23:24.949 --> 00:23:29.069
of resources, right? You're defending agricultural land, for example,

415
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.510
um, which is very valuable, and that, that kind

416
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:37.479
of defensive property is often done by um cooperative

417
00:23:37.479 --> 00:23:42.079
groups of men. And that kind of male cooperation

418
00:23:42.079 --> 00:23:44.859
is facilitated in context where you have a lot

419
00:23:44.859 --> 00:23:48.160
of um uh male relatives are living near each

420
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.650
other. So that's one kind of argument. On the

421
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:55.520
other hand, we do definitely see examples where, so

422
00:23:55.729 --> 00:23:58.530
in many, many parts of the world, the land

423
00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:04.260
is inherited. PATRILINEALLY, um, and defended by groups of

424
00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.579
men, although we do see um counterexamples, particularly in

425
00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:11.939
Southeast Asia where Land is often or sometimes inherited

426
00:24:11.939 --> 00:24:17.810
matrilineally as well. Um, AND in those contexts, um,

427
00:24:18.829 --> 00:24:22.829
Basically, there might be other social norms about how

428
00:24:22.829 --> 00:24:26.989
you have inheritance or um defense of property, um.

429
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.939
In There tends to also be a norm, again,

430
00:24:31.969 --> 00:24:38.599
on average in patrilineal societies. That property is going

431
00:24:38.599 --> 00:24:40.520
through the male line, and there might be a

432
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.500
concentration of inheritance in sons instead of daughters. Um,

433
00:24:45.599 --> 00:24:48.189
SO, for example, that land might uh pass to

434
00:24:48.189 --> 00:24:51.000
sons traditionally rather than passing to daughters, whereas in

435
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.400
matrilineal systems, it might be more likely to pass

436
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.800
to daughters, but in many matrilineal systems, land actually

437
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.239
also passes to sons, but just through the mother's

438
00:25:00.239 --> 00:25:03.760
line, rather than the father's line. So I would

439
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.819
say. Matrilineal systems, there's more of a focus on

440
00:25:06.819 --> 00:25:09.780
inheritance to sons and matrilineal systems that can be

441
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.819
inheritance to sons or daughters. You can also have

442
00:25:12.819 --> 00:25:17.550
lots of context in which um some inheritance These

443
00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:21.150
are something called dual dissent systems in which inheritance

444
00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:27.270
or is coming to children through um Through the

445
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:29.630
male line, some things are coming to children and

446
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.750
it's coming through the female line. Some other things

447
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.589
are inherited through or just descend through the female

448
00:25:35.589 --> 00:25:38.150
line. That's less common, but it does happen. But

449
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.829
you do also have women's wealth that can be

450
00:25:40.829 --> 00:25:44.150
passed from mothers to daughters, even in very patrilineal

451
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:47.239
contexts. So you see a lot of this um

452
00:25:47.709 --> 00:25:52.790
in um sort of pre-modern Britain, for example, or

453
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.420
other parts of parts of South Asia, for example,

454
00:25:55.589 --> 00:25:59.109
where A woman would bring property into a marriage,

455
00:25:59.439 --> 00:26:02.800
and then that property would not go to her

456
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.109
sons, but instead go to her daughters to pay

457
00:26:05.109 --> 00:26:08.989
for their dowries. In some cases. So there's, there's

458
00:26:08.989 --> 00:26:11.229
a lot of different examples. I'm not sure if

459
00:26:11.229 --> 00:26:14.489
you have another more specific question in mind.

460
00:26:15.349 --> 00:26:17.790
Yeah, I was going to ask you, is, is

461
00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.910
it, is it possible to make any uh or

462
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:24.589
to generalize in the sense that is it possible

463
00:26:24.589 --> 00:26:27.910
for us to say whether one particular kind of

464
00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:33.390
kinship system tends to lead to more gender disparities

465
00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.219
than the other?

466
00:26:35.479 --> 00:26:40.160
So there's a lot of arguments that um patrilineal

467
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:45.439
systems on average are less gender egalitarian than matrilineal

468
00:26:45.439 --> 00:26:51.250
systems. Um, THERE'S not This is mostly, most of

469
00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:54.270
the evidence for this is based on ethnographic observations

470
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:58.180
and descriptions, um, less of it's been based on

471
00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:03.859
um Basically research, right, direct tests of that. But

472
00:27:03.859 --> 00:27:06.420
um some colleagues of mine and I were able

473
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.599
to test this using um data from a field

474
00:27:09.599 --> 00:27:13.180
site, a couple of field sites in um Southwest

475
00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.729
China with an um ethnic group called the Moo.

476
00:27:16.979 --> 00:27:19.459
This is work mainly led by my colleague Siobhan

477
00:27:19.459 --> 00:27:24.229
Madison, um, uh, she also more recently is publishing

478
00:27:24.229 --> 00:27:29.469
under Siobhan Kulley. And in those cases, Basically, that's

479
00:27:29.469 --> 00:27:31.989
an ethnic group in which there are both a

480
00:27:31.989 --> 00:27:35.910
matrilineal and a patrial patrilineal subcommunities of the same

481
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.829
ethnic groups. So they have the same language, same

482
00:27:38.829 --> 00:27:42.030
general customs, but groups that are living in the

483
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:47.709
mountains, live in more patrilineal patrilocal settings, and groups

484
00:27:47.709 --> 00:27:49.989
that live in the valley and near this, in

485
00:27:49.989 --> 00:27:54.310
this Lugu Lake, it's a large, um beautiful lake

486
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:56.869
in China that's well known recently as a tourist

487
00:27:56.869 --> 00:28:00.079
area. Um, THE people who live in the valleys

488
00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:06.859
have these matrilineal compounds and um where Adult brothers

489
00:28:06.859 --> 00:28:09.619
will actually frequently stay with their adult sisters throughout

490
00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:14.739
their lifetimes, and they often have um children uh

491
00:28:14.739 --> 00:28:16.739
with women, but then the children and the mothers

492
00:28:16.739 --> 00:28:18.979
will stay in separately, so that the parents are

493
00:28:18.979 --> 00:28:21.380
not always moving in with each other. This is

494
00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:25.219
changing, but traditionally, adult brothers and sisters stay living

495
00:28:25.219 --> 00:28:28.609
with each other. Um, IN the matrilineal Moso case,

496
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.380
and in the patrilineal Moso case, you had patro

497
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.619
local residents where daughters would leave and join their

498
00:28:34.619 --> 00:28:38.339
husbands at marriage. So in this particular context, we

499
00:28:38.339 --> 00:28:41.300
were looking at health outcomes, and what we found

500
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:46.719
was that um Really Um, men and women were

501
00:28:46.719 --> 00:28:51.829
both in pretty good equal health in the um

502
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.560
matrilineal context, but women tended to have worse health

503
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.119
than men in the patrilineal context, which is in

504
00:28:58.119 --> 00:29:02.609
line with some of the um arguments that have

505
00:29:02.609 --> 00:29:07.290
been made, again, largely qualitatively, that patrilineal systems, in

506
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:11.810
at least in some circumstances, Um, may not benefit

507
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.439
women's health as much or women might face more,

508
00:29:14.569 --> 00:29:19.130
um, marginalization or health risks or other risks because

509
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:23.969
of in those systems. Again, that's a generalization. There's

510
00:29:23.969 --> 00:29:27.000
a lot of variation within patrilinear systems in terms

511
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.400
of how much gender equality or inequality there is.

512
00:29:30.849 --> 00:29:33.410
Some systems are much more equal than others, but

513
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:37.630
on average, Um, most people have found or suggested

514
00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:41.630
that matrilineal systems have more gender equality and or

515
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:45.310
sometimes bilateral systems also have more gender equality than

516
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.989
do very strictly patrilineal systems.

517
00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.219
So, uh just before we change topics, since you

518
00:29:52.219 --> 00:29:56.780
are usually interested in the ecological factors, when it

519
00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:01.300
comes to the distribution of material resources and inheritance,

520
00:30:01.339 --> 00:30:06.209
for example, are there any particular ecological Factors that

521
00:30:06.209 --> 00:30:10.729
explain why in a particular society, it might be

522
00:30:11.109 --> 00:30:14.060
the boys who are, or the men who are

523
00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.099
benefited more than the women or vice versa in

524
00:30:17.099 --> 00:30:20.219
terms of inheritance and distribution of resources.

525
00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:26.729
Yeah. So, as I've said before, in patrilineal context,

526
00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:30.670
there's, it's often true that because you have cooperation

527
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.270
among male kin, or it becomes important in those

528
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:37.510
contexts, that inheritance is often going to sons, more

529
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.859
so than daughters or sons may get a larger

530
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.160
stake of the inheritance and daughters. Also, On average

531
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.479
in patrilineal context, daughters are moving um outside of

532
00:30:49.479 --> 00:30:52.199
the family group at marriage, and they're in a

533
00:30:52.199 --> 00:30:54.359
new group, and that means when you're coming into

534
00:30:54.359 --> 00:30:57.849
a new group. You may actually start at the

535
00:30:57.849 --> 00:31:00.729
bottom of the socioeconomic kind of scale and you

536
00:31:00.729 --> 00:31:03.089
have to work your way up over time. So,

537
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.410
both there may be sort of gender um kind

538
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:11.010
of preferences given to sons in patrilineal context. Again,

539
00:31:11.089 --> 00:31:13.550
not all of them, but many of them. And

540
00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.030
also daughters might be in a situation where because

541
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.109
they're moving out of the family and into another

542
00:31:19.109 --> 00:31:21.750
family, they might get less investment at home and

543
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.140
or they might be in a less good position

544
00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.989
in their husband's house. And so those are the

545
00:31:26.989 --> 00:31:30.069
patterns that I think most people would argue underlie.

546
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:35.719
Um, PATTERNS of poor health or lower levels of

547
00:31:35.719 --> 00:31:39.119
inheritance for women in patrilineal contexts. Whereas in matrilineal

548
00:31:39.119 --> 00:31:43.880
contexts, daughters are more likely to inherit larger portions

549
00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.439
of wealth, even if they don't inherit all of

550
00:31:46.439 --> 00:31:50.040
it. And they often are spending more of their

551
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.099
life if they're matrilocal, they're spending more of their

552
00:31:53.099 --> 00:31:56.959
life with their maternal kin. And those are often

553
00:31:56.959 --> 00:32:00.569
contexts in which they might be they might face

554
00:32:00.569 --> 00:32:03.560
less discrimination or they might um be sort of

555
00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.780
in a better social position and therefore, again, might

556
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.540
have better health outcomes because of that. And that's

557
00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:13.660
certainly the argument, um, generally speaking, the argument that

558
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.760
we were making in. In on that paper, but

559
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.160
I would also say that um there's a certain

560
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.989
amount of, uh, yeah, there's a lot of variation

561
00:32:22.989 --> 00:32:25.869
in these kinds of context. So you can say,

562
00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.280
again, on average, you might see more um gender

563
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.640
inequality and patrilineal than matrilineal systems, but we're still

564
00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.119
gonna see variation across those kinds of societies. Yeah.

565
00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:39.819
Right. So, I would like to ask you a

566
00:32:39.819 --> 00:32:43.099
little bit about religion and fertility now. I've already

567
00:32:43.099 --> 00:32:46.260
talked on the show with many cognitive scientists of

568
00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:50.619
religion, anthropologists of religion, and other scientists of religion

569
00:32:50.619 --> 00:32:53.939
more generally. And one of the things that is

570
00:32:53.939 --> 00:32:58.109
frequently brought What up is how religion seems to

571
00:32:58.109 --> 00:33:02.369
bring fitness benefits to its practitioner. So, first of

572
00:33:02.369 --> 00:33:05.199
all, do you agree with that? And if so,

573
00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:09.130
in what ways does religion relate to fertility? I

574
00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.650
mean, how is the link established

575
00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:15.209
there? Sure, yeah. So I want to get into

576
00:33:15.209 --> 00:33:16.969
now um some of the work I've been doing

577
00:33:16.969 --> 00:33:20.599
recently with some colleagues, the main Uh, lead investigator

578
00:33:20.599 --> 00:33:23.560
on this project is um John Shaver, who was

579
00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.439
at the University of Otago in New Zealand. He's

580
00:33:25.439 --> 00:33:29.000
now at Baylor University. We're also collaborating with Richard

581
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.520
Sosis from the University of Connecticut and Rebeccai, who's

582
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:37.050
currently at Brunel University in London. Um, AND so,

583
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.599
as you said, one of the big, the big

584
00:33:39.599 --> 00:33:43.935
arguments from an evolutionary perspective is that Religion brings

585
00:33:43.935 --> 00:33:48.464
a lot of cooperative benefits to its practitioners, and

586
00:33:48.464 --> 00:33:51.785
those cooperative benefits could benefit people economically, but they

587
00:33:51.785 --> 00:33:54.614
could also benefit mental health and levels of stress,

588
00:33:54.984 --> 00:33:56.665
um, and they can also benefit you in a

589
00:33:56.665 --> 00:33:59.905
variety of ways. So we have made the argument,

590
00:33:59.984 --> 00:34:02.344
this is following on some early work from John

591
00:34:02.344 --> 00:34:06.949
Shaver, um, Kind of proposed something called the religious

592
00:34:06.949 --> 00:34:10.530
allop parenting hypothesis, which essentially says, OK, we, we

593
00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:13.600
have, we know, or most people would argue that

594
00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:20.208
religion promotes cooperation. We also know that humans, one

595
00:34:20.208 --> 00:34:24.330
of our main um sort of mechanisms related with

596
00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:28.449
fertility in humans, that's fairly unique. At least among

597
00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:31.530
related groups of primates is aloe parenting. We got

598
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.929
lots and lots of aloe parenting in most societies

599
00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:38.050
that we rely on lots of kin, especially grandmothers,

600
00:34:38.208 --> 00:34:43.639
but also fathers, husbands, um, and older siblings, um,

601
00:34:43.688 --> 00:34:46.610
to help us with childcare. And so the argument

602
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:50.918
is, if religion is promoting cooperation among the a

603
00:34:50.918 --> 00:34:55.969
social group, And cooperation is promoting aloe parenting, so

604
00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:59.330
we are getting more aloe parenting, um, or higher

605
00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:02.550
quality care, more support of some kind, that this

606
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:06.489
could um be the mechanism, or at least a

607
00:35:06.489 --> 00:35:11.010
key mechanism behind a known relationship between religion and

608
00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.850
fertility, that is more religious people or more religious

609
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:17.959
groups traditionally in many, many contexts have more children.

610
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:20.909
Then uh less religious groups. And so we've been

611
00:35:20.909 --> 00:35:25.469
testing this idea and um some existing data sets.

612
00:35:26.889 --> 00:35:28.909
And there's 2 or 3 papers published on that

613
00:35:28.909 --> 00:35:31.469
and then we've also been testing this idea in

614
00:35:31.469 --> 00:35:34.070
a variety of new data sets that we have

615
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.469
just uh collected in um in my field sites

616
00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:40.510
in India and Bangladesh, so Matla Bangladesh and Beer

617
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:44.189
Boom, India, and then um sites in Malawi and

618
00:35:44.189 --> 00:35:45.989
in The Gambia, and then we also have a

619
00:35:45.989 --> 00:35:49.439
research site in Pittsburgh where we're kind of Putting

620
00:35:49.439 --> 00:35:53.709
together some research where we're connecting. OK, religiosity related

621
00:35:53.709 --> 00:35:57.560
to cooperation, religiosity being linked to allop parenting, and

622
00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.679
then religiosity and or all parenting being linked to

623
00:36:00.679 --> 00:36:04.040
either fertility, so having more kids, or those kids

624
00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:08.199
having better outcomes, better health, for example. Um, SO

625
00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:10.719
that, that's the work we're working on right now.

626
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.739
And I think so far, the evidence suggests that

627
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.949
this is probably true. Um, AND, uh, but the

628
00:36:17.949 --> 00:36:19.889
details of it, I think, are still being worked

629
00:36:19.889 --> 00:36:20.189
out.

630
00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.669
Mhm. Uh, BUT when it comes to the potential

631
00:36:23.669 --> 00:36:28.669
fitness benefits apart from your suggestion, suggestion having to

632
00:36:28.669 --> 00:36:33.949
do with Llo parenting, are there other ways, mechanisms

633
00:36:33.949 --> 00:36:37.189
by which religion promotes fertility?

634
00:36:39.169 --> 00:36:44.260
Sure. So there's a literature on this, um, That's

635
00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.060
quite, so I think again, the thing I'm especially

636
00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.209
interested in as an evolutionary scientist is the our

637
00:36:49.209 --> 00:36:52.820
parenting mechanism, but there's 2 or 3 other arguments

638
00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.379
out of there in the literature about the relationship

639
00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:58.739
between religion and fertility. And one of the arguments

640
00:36:58.739 --> 00:37:01.379
is that it's somehow something about the content of

641
00:37:01.379 --> 00:37:04.979
the religion itself. So the messages of the religion.

642
00:37:05.419 --> 00:37:09.899
A lot of world religions are pretty pro-natalist, meaning

643
00:37:09.899 --> 00:37:11.860
that they, they tell people that they should have

644
00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.100
kids. This is certainly true in Christianity and in

645
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.179
Islam. Um, IT'S true in other world religions in

646
00:37:17.179 --> 00:37:20.300
many contexts as well. People will argue that Judaism

647
00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.780
is pro-natalist. They will argue that in some contexts,

648
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.580
Hinduism is, so that's, I think a little bit

649
00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:28.649
less clear. Um, But so some people argue that

650
00:37:28.649 --> 00:37:33.129
the content of the religion is motivating people to

651
00:37:33.129 --> 00:37:36.830
have more kids. Um, I think that there's probably

652
00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:38.790
some evidence that that's true, but I also think

653
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:43.229
the evidence for that is mixed. Another argument that's

654
00:37:43.229 --> 00:37:47.949
made in the literature is that um, One of

655
00:37:47.949 --> 00:37:50.189
the reasons you have a relationship between religion and

656
00:37:50.189 --> 00:37:54.270
fertility in some context is because of um the

657
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.429
minority status of particular religion. So if a group

658
00:37:57.429 --> 00:38:00.419
of religious people are in a minority, they may

659
00:38:00.419 --> 00:38:07.810
be um motivated to Especially if they're facing marginalization

660
00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:11.820
or discrimination that they may be motivated to improve

661
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:16.659
their own um sort of situation by having more

662
00:38:16.659 --> 00:38:19.260
children and thus be in a less marginalized position,

663
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.620
more people in the group to cooperate with, etc.

664
00:38:22.379 --> 00:38:27.659
Again, there's evidence that whatever the mechanism is, whether

665
00:38:27.659 --> 00:38:30.659
or not it's a conscious mechanism or a subconscious

666
00:38:30.659 --> 00:38:35.120
mechanism, it's harder to tell, but It's certainly true

667
00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.760
that in many contexts, um, marginalized religious groups have

668
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:44.080
higher fertility than um less marginalized religious or more

669
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.120
sort of socially dominant religious groups. There are some

670
00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.399
context though, in which it looks like more marginalized

671
00:38:49.399 --> 00:38:53.010
groups have lower fertility, and so there's actually, um,

672
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:57.280
there's actually some debate, and the, the, the research

673
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.879
that I'm aware of on this suggests that there's

674
00:38:58.879 --> 00:39:01.489
sort of two patterns and one is where You're

675
00:39:01.489 --> 00:39:05.489
more marginalized, and because of that, there's some, there's

676
00:39:05.489 --> 00:39:07.969
in-group dynamics that are motivating you to kind of

677
00:39:07.969 --> 00:39:11.590
bolster your own community, um, which might be related

678
00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.610
to higher fertility, and then in other cases where

679
00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.929
you're trying to kind of become accepted in a

680
00:39:16.929 --> 00:39:19.899
minority in a majority context and some of those

681
00:39:19.899 --> 00:39:25.070
contexts, people would have fewer children. Um, So I'm

682
00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:28.379
thinking about there's one of the other arguments about

683
00:39:28.379 --> 00:39:32.139
um this relationship that's commonly found between religion and

684
00:39:32.139 --> 00:39:34.810
fertility, in fact, is that it's not really about

685
00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:38.290
religion, but that it's about an artifact of not

686
00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:42.919
controlling very well for socioeconomic differences among groups and

687
00:39:43.639 --> 00:39:46.179
It's pretty clear if you look at this literature

688
00:39:46.179 --> 00:39:49.500
that that's at least partly true, but it's also

689
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:51.530
pretty clear to me, at least we would do

690
00:39:51.899 --> 00:39:56.540
one of my um former PhD um students, or

691
00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.780
at least I worked with her and she's a

692
00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.739
PhD student. Part of her dissertation uses DHS data

693
00:40:02.219 --> 00:40:05.110
from India, Bangladesh, and Nepal and looks at Hindu

694
00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:09.320
and Muslim communities and what we We seem to

695
00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.919
find that, um, so using a mechanism called propensity

696
00:40:12.919 --> 00:40:16.639
score matching, in which you match people across religious

697
00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:19.669
groups in terms of their socioeconomic characteristics to create

698
00:40:19.669 --> 00:40:22.340
a sample that allows you to try to get

699
00:40:22.679 --> 00:40:25.639
rid of socioeconomic variation as one of the main

700
00:40:25.639 --> 00:40:27.800
drivers. And what we find is that that um

701
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:33.679
reduces the religious variation, um, the religious comparison across

702
00:40:33.679 --> 00:40:35.679
groups in terms of fertility, but it doesn't fully

703
00:40:35.679 --> 00:40:38.320
get rid of it. Which could either mean that

704
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.199
you're not, that the mechanism isn't that the method

705
00:40:41.199 --> 00:40:44.040
isn't totally getting rid of economic differences, or it

706
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.899
could mean that there's also other things going on.

707
00:40:45.959 --> 00:40:48.919
And so our argument in that paper, which again

708
00:40:48.919 --> 00:40:51.320
is published in a dissertation, but we're working on

709
00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.419
getting ready to submit that soon, um. Is that,

710
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.510
you know, I think there's that this this sort

711
00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:01.580
of uncontrolled economic differences is part of what's going

712
00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.620
on, but that these other kinds of things. Whether

713
00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:07.820
it's religious aloe parenting or the actual message of

714
00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:11.459
the religion and or these minority and majority differences

715
00:41:11.459 --> 00:41:15.189
are also probably playing a role in the relationship

716
00:41:15.189 --> 00:41:17.729
between religion and fertility, which again is quite well

717
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.979
known that there is one. SO we're really trying

718
00:41:20.979 --> 00:41:23.899
to especially um spend more time sorting out the

719
00:41:23.899 --> 00:41:25.540
mechanisms of how that's happening.

720
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.919
Very interesting. So, uh, still on the topic of

721
00:41:29.919 --> 00:41:34.000
fertility, but now, let's move from religion. Uh, IN

722
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.679
recent times, people have been talking a lot about

723
00:41:36.679 --> 00:41:40.239
fertility decline across the world. Some people worry a

724
00:41:40.239 --> 00:41:42.760
lot about that. And with the focus, of course,

725
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.239
on the more developed countries. And, uh, I want

726
00:41:46.239 --> 00:41:48.659
to ask you about the factors. Behind that, but,

727
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:50.709
uh, to start off with, I would like to

728
00:41:50.709 --> 00:41:54.000
focus on one that is mentioned that has to

729
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.350
do with women's education. I mean, is there really

730
00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:02.310
a link between women's education and fertility levels? And

731
00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:07.510
if so, do we know exactly how education might

732
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:08.620
influence fertility?

733
00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.780
So there is a very strong link between women's

734
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:16.399
education and fertility with more education being associated with

735
00:42:16.399 --> 00:42:21.909
lower fertility. This is true. VIRTUALLY everywhere that this

736
00:42:21.909 --> 00:42:27.290
relationship has been tested with very few um counterexamples.

737
00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:32.659
Um, AND it's, it tends to also be um

738
00:42:33.179 --> 00:42:35.500
one of the stronger predictors if you have it

739
00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.860
in a model of fertility. Education seems to be

740
00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:41.820
one of the stronger predictors. In terms of the

741
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:45.530
reason for that, um, I think this is more

742
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:49.580
complicated, but, um, I think personally, and I've written

743
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.219
about this, I have a 2013 paper in PNAS

744
00:42:52.219 --> 00:42:54.770
and then we have a 2016 paper with some

745
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:58.540
colleagues also in philosophical transactions of the Royal Society,

746
00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.840
and, uh, in a couple of other places. I

747
00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.100
think one of the reasons for that education has

748
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.969
this very strong relationship with fertility is that It's

749
00:43:07.969 --> 00:43:11.770
tapping into itself as that one variable is tapping

750
00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:15.540
into multiple mechanisms, which I think are driving reduced

751
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:21.090
fertility, including Um, a trade-off in women's time, the

752
00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:23.850
amount of time you spent getting education is often

753
00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:26.250
taking you away from time that you might spend

754
00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:29.010
having children, and so, or you might get married

755
00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:33.270
later, you might start having children later. Um, ALSO,

756
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.399
education tends to be associated with wage labor economies

757
00:43:36.399 --> 00:43:40.010
in which there's A lot of emphasis on investing

758
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:43.010
more in a smaller number of children. And so

759
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.139
because of that, and the women who are more

760
00:43:45.139 --> 00:43:47.580
involved in the labor market tend to be more

761
00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.620
involved in that, you know, let's have fewer children

762
00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:53.810
and invest more in them. And then also I

763
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.889
would say education goes along with cultural transmission of

764
00:43:56.889 --> 00:44:00.129
social norms of lower fertility as well. And so

765
00:44:00.129 --> 00:44:03.330
for all of these reasons, um, there's actually even

766
00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:07.280
more cause you could say about fertility. It's really

767
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:11.360
um a very good indicator of a whole bunch

768
00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.679
of different things, different patterns that are associated with

769
00:44:15.679 --> 00:44:19.169
lower fertility. Um, BUT women's education is, and I

770
00:44:19.169 --> 00:44:22.610
think that's why it's such a strong predictor globally

771
00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:25.929
because it's, it's tapping into multiple mechanisms by which

772
00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:27.330
fertility is going down.

773
00:44:28.409 --> 00:44:31.860
I was wondering, do levels of education, of course,

774
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:34.560
in this case, we're focusing on women, but perhaps

775
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.639
what I'm about to say would also apply to

776
00:44:36.639 --> 00:44:39.679
men, but do levels of education also have something

777
00:44:39.679 --> 00:44:43.750
to do with perhaps people investing more or being

778
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:47.350
more open to family planning and to the use

779
00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:48.899
of contraceptives?

780
00:44:49.469 --> 00:44:51.750
Sure, that's actually another thing I was saying there's

781
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:53.909
even more going on with education and that's one

782
00:44:53.909 --> 00:44:57.600
of the things. Um, PEOPLE might be more open

783
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.959
to the use of contraception or contraception or more

784
00:45:00.959 --> 00:45:04.639
knowledgeable about how to use it more appropriately. Um,

785
00:45:04.679 --> 00:45:08.840
THEY also might um have better information about child

786
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.709
health and be in a better position to, um,

787
00:45:11.719 --> 00:45:14.800
kind of keep their children healthy. And again, if

788
00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.909
you're having a lot of children are dying, that's

789
00:45:16.909 --> 00:45:19.159
one motivation people have for having more children, whereas

790
00:45:19.159 --> 00:45:21.560
if your children are living and You feel like

791
00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.560
you can get good healthcare for them. You're more

792
00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.199
usually uh interested in having fewer children. But that's

793
00:45:26.199 --> 00:45:30.139
absolutely true. I will say though, about contraception, that

794
00:45:30.139 --> 00:45:32.719
is, I think this is actually much more complicated

795
00:45:32.719 --> 00:45:34.600
than a lot of people think it is in

796
00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.979
the sense that Um, I would say the argument

797
00:45:37.979 --> 00:45:42.379
is stronger that people adopt contraception or in the

798
00:45:42.379 --> 00:45:46.739
case of historical Europe, invent contraception when they want

799
00:45:46.739 --> 00:45:50.280
to reduce fertility. Uh, AND there's lots of examples

800
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:54.520
where contraception is introduced in high fertility societies and

801
00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.760
people are not interested, or they use it to

802
00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.719
space children out and reduce child mortality, and so

803
00:46:00.719 --> 00:46:05.120
it's actually not associated with reduced fertility. So, um,

804
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:07.330
contraception, I tend to think of it as a

805
00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:11.090
tool that you use to reduce fertility in the

806
00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.129
context where you want it or you reduce fertility.

807
00:46:13.209 --> 00:46:16.810
So typically, contraception will help bring fertility down in

808
00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:20.290
places where people wanted, we're already trying to reduce

809
00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:22.120
fertility, and if you just give it to people,

810
00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.459
For whom large numbers of children is associated with

811
00:46:25.459 --> 00:46:28.340
status and wealth, and, you know, having a lot

812
00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.290
of farm labor and that's really useful for them.

813
00:46:30.379 --> 00:46:33.540
They may or may not reduce their fertility if

814
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.179
you just give contraception. So I think it's, it's

815
00:46:36.179 --> 00:46:37.979
a tool we use, but I don't think it's

816
00:46:37.979 --> 00:46:40.580
a driver, at least that's my personal opinion. I

817
00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.290
don't think it's a driver in the same sense.

818
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:43.340
Mhm.

819
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:47.669
And are there other well studied factors that might

820
00:46:47.669 --> 00:46:51.939
play a role in the decline in fertility, particularly

821
00:46:51.939 --> 00:46:55.459
among more developed countries? I mean, could there be,

822
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:59.350
I don't know, also economic factors or factors of

823
00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:00.239
other sort?

824
00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.110
Yeah. So what I really think is one of

825
00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:05.350
the big, there's a lot of um people who've

826
00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:08.949
argued this over the years in different forms, many

827
00:47:08.949 --> 00:47:13.939
economists as well. Um, BUT I think Probably one

828
00:47:13.939 --> 00:47:17.939
of the strongest drivers of fertility decline in recent

829
00:47:17.939 --> 00:47:23.000
years, um, since is the industrial revolution and modern

830
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.439
market economies that follow from the industrial revolution. Essentially,

831
00:47:27.479 --> 00:47:31.719
you're going from a situation in which Having lots

832
00:47:31.719 --> 00:47:36.199
of children, um, is that the children are essentially

833
00:47:36.199 --> 00:47:38.479
kind of helping you on the farm, helping you

834
00:47:38.479 --> 00:47:42.229
with pastoralist labor, helping you with farm labor and

835
00:47:42.229 --> 00:47:45.149
they're kind of paying part of their own way,

836
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.439
right? Because they're helping with other children and they're

837
00:47:47.439 --> 00:47:50.820
helping with agricultural labor, so more children. Generally is

838
00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.810
associated with more prosperity and a lot of these

839
00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:55.370
traditional contexts

840
00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:00.290
in those specific in the specific context, children also

841
00:48:00.699 --> 00:48:03.340
sort of work as economic assets.

842
00:48:03.459 --> 00:48:06.979
Yes, exactly. They work as, I mean. There is

843
00:48:06.979 --> 00:48:09.580
this argument that some people would say if they're

844
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:13.860
just economic assets, what the sort of um Ron

845
00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:17.100
Lee and Karen Kramer, that's an economist and anthropologist

846
00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.219
team did a more detailed talk about them. They're

847
00:48:19.219 --> 00:48:21.739
like, OK, it always costs you, you always have

848
00:48:21.739 --> 00:48:25.969
to Costs you energy to have children, but what's

849
00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:28.050
happening with children who are doing farm labor is

850
00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:30.320
they're paying for like at least half or more

851
00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.530
of what you're, they're reducing their own costs because

852
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.169
of the work that they're doing. So even though

853
00:48:35.169 --> 00:48:37.219
you have to feed them and clothe them and

854
00:48:37.219 --> 00:48:40.169
you're giving more resources and energy to them then

855
00:48:40.169 --> 00:48:42.409
you're getting back from them but they're paying for

856
00:48:42.409 --> 00:48:44.689
a lot of their costs. Whereas think about a

857
00:48:44.689 --> 00:48:48.540
modern market economy. Kids aren't allowed to work, they

858
00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.699
have to spend all their time in school, and

859
00:48:50.699 --> 00:48:52.820
parents end up spending a huge amount of parental

860
00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:57.070
time and money trying to support and raise children.

861
00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.750
And so often with more limited help. And so

862
00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:04.120
you have a situation which Um, the children in

863
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:07.060
more sort of farming and pastoral herding economies are

864
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.399
really paying for a lot of their own, you

865
00:49:10.399 --> 00:49:15.719
know, resources. They're subsidizing their their themselves. Um, SO

866
00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:18.000
economically, you have this situation which the kids are

867
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.510
kind of, they're an asset and they're paying for

868
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:23.280
themselves, at least partially, and you have a lot

869
00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.639
of benefits coming out of larger, you know, numbers

870
00:49:26.639 --> 00:49:31.280
of children to a context in which everything is

871
00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:35.419
Kind of more expensive and the benefits are reduced.

872
00:49:35.459 --> 00:49:38.060
So, um, kids are going to school and you

873
00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.120
have to pay for that, either that or even

874
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.580
if you don't have to pay money for that,

875
00:49:41.699 --> 00:49:43.459
the kids can't help you at home or on

876
00:49:43.459 --> 00:49:46.820
the farm when you're at school. Um, WHEN they're

877
00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:50.260
at school. Also, there becomes a lot of social

878
00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.189
competition for more education to get in particular kinds

879
00:49:53.189 --> 00:49:58.000
of jobs. And the time and effort it takes

880
00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:03.080
to really um make children competitive is something you

881
00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.409
just can't, you can't have 10 children and do

882
00:50:05.409 --> 00:50:08.169
that. They're huge trade-offs if you have larger numbers

883
00:50:08.169 --> 00:50:10.489
of children in market economies in a way that

884
00:50:10.489 --> 00:50:14.489
they're frequently aren't in sort of um kind of

885
00:50:14.489 --> 00:50:20.520
agriculturalist, traditional agriculturalist economies. And you also see really

886
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.449
steep trade-offs for parents' time, and this is often

887
00:50:23.449 --> 00:50:27.129
true for mothers' time, more so even that if

888
00:50:27.129 --> 00:50:29.969
mothers are working or they're getting education, there's other

889
00:50:29.969 --> 00:50:32.520
things they're doing that are helping the social status

890
00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:36.169
and economic well-being of the family. Those things often

891
00:50:36.169 --> 00:50:40.270
are trading off in the ability to put that

892
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:43.149
time and energy, that time especially into children. And

893
00:50:43.149 --> 00:50:46.270
this is true for fathers too, um, but it's

894
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:49.070
especially changes a lot for mothers in these contexts

895
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:52.469
where they're, you're working in an office becomes incompatible

896
00:50:52.469 --> 00:50:55.590
with childcare. You can't really do one and the

897
00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.510
other, and you're sort of in a situation where

898
00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:00.050
you have to, um, you have to choose. And

899
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:02.540
so all of these things, the rising costs of

900
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:06.729
children, And also the rising sort of economic competitiveness

901
00:51:06.729 --> 00:51:10.370
of modern markets all pushes people towards a more

902
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:16.489
um investing in a lot in higher child quality

903
00:51:16.489 --> 00:51:18.659
and having fewer children overall.

904
00:51:19.459 --> 00:51:23.419
Mhm. So, as the last topic for our conversation

905
00:51:23.419 --> 00:51:26.100
today, I would like to ask you about social

906
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:31.139
and economic inequality. So, um, what are the factors

907
00:51:31.139 --> 00:51:35.459
that play a role in the transition from relatively

908
00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:40.939
equal societies to increasingly unequal societies, which is something

909
00:51:40.939 --> 00:51:44.739
that we have observed over the course of human

910
00:51:44.739 --> 00:51:45.199
history.

911
00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:49.570
Yeah. So there's a bunch of different factors that

912
00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:51.649
people would point to, but one that we've published

913
00:51:51.649 --> 00:51:54.770
on, and this is especially, um, I think you

914
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.689
can see the argument very clearly in a 2016

915
00:51:57.689 --> 00:52:01.409
paper, Madison at all in evolutionary Anthropology, and then

916
00:52:01.409 --> 00:52:03.169
this is also in a variety of other papers

917
00:52:03.169 --> 00:52:07.729
of mine as well. Um, IT'S an argument that

918
00:52:07.729 --> 00:52:11.760
it's one of the major drivers is economic defensibility

919
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:16.399
of resources. So if you go from So think

920
00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:19.800
about the example that we I gave earlier about

921
00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.919
the difference between horticulture and agriculture. If you have

922
00:52:22.919 --> 00:52:25.389
a horticulture with hand tools and there's lots of

923
00:52:25.719 --> 00:52:27.600
land that you could farm, but you don't have

924
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.669
enough people to farm it, that's really the trade-off.

925
00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.199
Typically, in those cases, there's some inequality locally. There's

926
00:52:35.199 --> 00:52:39.620
a local tribal chief or a local leader of

927
00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:43.389
some kind, but the inequality can't be that much

928
00:52:43.389 --> 00:52:48.300
because there's just Um, there's relatively less competition for

929
00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.459
land and other things, whereas as soon as you

930
00:52:50.459 --> 00:52:57.010
start to get, for example, Really good arable land

931
00:52:57.179 --> 00:53:01.340
in a river valley where it's really, really great

932
00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:05.129
for agriculture. Then I have the land and I'm

933
00:53:05.129 --> 00:53:07.250
farming it, but other people would also like the

934
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:09.050
land, and so there ends up being a massive

935
00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:11.449
amount of social competition for those kinds of resources.

936
00:53:11.489 --> 00:53:13.360
So you can start to get a whole lot.

937
00:53:14.139 --> 00:53:18.199
Of social changes, because of resource defensibility like that.

938
00:53:18.239 --> 00:53:22.070
So, for example, we start to get I switch

939
00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:27.679
from polygyny to monogamy alongside um these kinds of

940
00:53:27.679 --> 00:53:32.840
um Heritable or defensible resources, we get a switch

941
00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:38.639
from um sort of more egalitarian social groups to

942
00:53:38.639 --> 00:53:43.979
more um Kind of hierarchical social groups, uh, with

943
00:53:43.979 --> 00:53:47.530
a lot more um social complexity, meaning like different

944
00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:49.419
layers and different kinds of things. So you have

945
00:53:49.419 --> 00:53:52.340
the rights of social classes and caste systems and

946
00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:56.280
things like this. Um, AND then you can get,

947
00:53:56.649 --> 00:54:00.770
um, there's a whole bunch of sort of complicated

948
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:04.449
sort of social machinery and um social norms, etc.

949
00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:08.810
THAT get become part of those things. But I

950
00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:11.449
would most of the argument is that what this

951
00:54:11.449 --> 00:54:14.050
really seems to go back to is economic defensibility

952
00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:18.830
either of land. Or you also see economically defensible

953
00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:24.040
um societies with increasing hierarchy even among people who

954
00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.879
are not doing much farming. For example, it would

955
00:54:26.879 --> 00:54:30.409
be the Pacific Northwest coast of North America, historically

956
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.889
is well known for this. Where the economic differences

957
00:54:34.889 --> 00:54:38.129
were really based on who um had access to

958
00:54:38.129 --> 00:54:41.570
these very rich salmon runs, right, these salmon rivers

959
00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:44.439
where you would have huge, huge numbers of salmon

960
00:54:44.739 --> 00:54:47.810
coming to spawn in the rivers, you could get

961
00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:50.199
lots and lots of resources from sitting on those

962
00:54:50.199 --> 00:54:54.290
rivers and therefore you develop property rights, right? So

963
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:57.449
you have the development of any economically defensible resources

964
00:54:57.449 --> 00:54:59.370
lead to things like property rights and then a

965
00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:01.790
whole bunch of social machinery that goes on to

966
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:05.429
defend it. And I would say, That one of

967
00:55:05.429 --> 00:55:07.709
the other things that some colleagues and I have

968
00:55:08.149 --> 00:55:11.350
worked on, we have a paper uh also in

969
00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:15.310
this in 2016, Shank Kaplan and Hooper, where we,

970
00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:17.959
we model this and we also show that um

971
00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.840
Social competition and increasing inequality is probably one of

972
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:25.399
the things that reduces fertility as well. It increases

973
00:55:25.399 --> 00:55:30.239
this motivation of young parents to um invent, invest

974
00:55:30.239 --> 00:55:32.919
intensively in an even smaller number of children. So

975
00:55:32.919 --> 00:55:35.639
even though the transition from an agricultural to a

976
00:55:35.639 --> 00:55:38.659
market economy would reduce the number of children, if

977
00:55:38.659 --> 00:55:43.169
you have inequality and increased social competition, People are

978
00:55:43.169 --> 00:55:46.169
really motivated. They'd like to become, move up the

979
00:55:46.169 --> 00:55:48.330
social hierarchy, but it becomes even harder to just

980
00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:50.800
stay in your same place in the social hierarchy,

981
00:55:51.169 --> 00:55:53.649
um, stay in your same place economically, and that

982
00:55:53.649 --> 00:55:57.169
this can also lead to um fertility reduction in

983
00:55:57.169 --> 00:55:59.129
small numbers of children. And this is an argument

984
00:55:59.129 --> 00:56:02.330
that's been made for the Um, one of the

985
00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:05.250
two major arguments that's made for, um, parts of

986
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:07.810
the world with really low levels of fertility these

987
00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:10.770
days, so under 2 children per woman. So for

988
00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:13.409
example, you think about arguments about South Korea, which

989
00:56:13.409 --> 00:56:16.530
has a TFR of 1.1 or 1.3, that a

990
00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:19.719
lot of this has been related to social competition,

991
00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:24.050
these really intensive social competition in that context. The

992
00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:27.129
other one, there's about women's trade-offs as well that

993
00:56:27.129 --> 00:56:29.129
you where you see more in Southern Europe, you

994
00:56:29.129 --> 00:56:30.209
see arguments about that.

995
00:56:31.879 --> 00:56:36.080
So, I mean, maybe again, earlier I asked you

996
00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:40.040
when it comes to fertility levels, if there were

997
00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:42.959
economic factors that played the role here and so,

998
00:56:43.479 --> 00:56:48.939
uh, higher levels of economic inequality might also have

999
00:56:48.939 --> 00:56:51.709
an effect on fertility rates,

1000
00:56:51.879 --> 00:56:55.639
right? Yes, that, that's the argument and I that

1001
00:56:55.639 --> 00:57:00.189
um in addition to sort of market economies that

1002
00:57:00.189 --> 00:57:06.379
inequality would should be associated with um Increase, increased

1003
00:57:06.379 --> 00:57:09.449
reduction, right? So low, even lower fertility rates than

1004
00:57:09.449 --> 00:57:11.699
it would be in a more sort of economically

1005
00:57:11.699 --> 00:57:16.350
cool society that was similarly, similar economically. Yeah, that's

1006
00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:18.729
the argument. Mhm.

1007
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:23.040
Great. So, Doctor Shenk, just before we go, would

1008
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.250
you like to tell people where they can find

1009
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:27.399
you when you work on the internet?

1010
00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:31.820
Yeah, sure. I think um you can go to

1011
00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.780
my website at Penn State University, and I think

1012
00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:37.179
the other good place to see my work and

1013
00:57:37.179 --> 00:57:39.179
potentially download some of it would be on Research

1014
00:57:39.179 --> 00:57:41.580
Gate. Which is a place where I put things.

1015
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.340
I'm not um a big social media person in

1016
00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.610
other ways, but I think Research gate is and

1017
00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:50.580
my website are great places to get um access

1018
00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:52.189
to papers. You can also email me if you

1019
00:57:52.189 --> 00:57:54.540
don't find something, but most of it's up there.

1020
00:57:55.659 --> 00:57:58.030
Great. So I'm leaving links to that in the

1021
00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:00.870
description of the interview and thank you so much

1022
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:02.590
again for taking the time to come on the

1023
00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:05.229
show. It's been a very fascinating conversation.

1024
00:58:06.199 --> 00:58:08.439
