00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:02.950
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:05.760
Center. I'm your host as always Ricard Lobs. And

3
00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:08.560
today I'm joined by Doctor Timothy Weaver. He's a

4
00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:11.560
professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University

5
00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:15.229
of California Davis. He studies human evolution with the

6
00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.690
focus on the origins, evolution and disappearance of neander

7
00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:21.864
falls and the related topic of the origins of

8
00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:26.854
humans who were anatomically and behaviorally modern. And today

9
00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:29.715
we're focusing on topics like the evolution of the

10
00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:35.794
human cranium bipedalism and childbirth, neanderthals, homo sapiens and

11
00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:39.134
some other related topics. So Dr Weaver, welcome to

12
00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:40.755
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.259
Thank you for having me on your show. I'm

14
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.000
happy to be here.

15
00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:48.560
So starting with the evolution of the human cranium,

16
00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:52.340
which is actually something that you've done work on.

17
00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:56.599
So how did it evolve over time? I mean,

18
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.220
and what is, what is characteristic about it in

19
00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.840
comparison to other great apes, for example?

20
00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:08.779
Yes. So we can think about kind of a

21
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.779
really longer term, you know, trajectory, we can think

22
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.230
about, you know, how are we different or similar

23
00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:17.980
to Great Apes? And we can think about the

24
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.220
evolution of the human cranium over. Well, we if

25
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.860
we think about chimpanzees are the most closely related

26
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.160
species uh living today, most closely related species to

27
00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:29.940
humans living today. Uh We shared a common ancestor

28
00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:32.419
with them maybe 6 to 8 million years ago.

29
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.970
So, um we can think about, you know, the,

30
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.940
the human cranial evolution over that period of, you

31
00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:43.139
know, 68 million years. Um And what we can

32
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.110
also think about it at, at a kind of

33
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.410
a um a a shorter time scale. So for

34
00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:51.949
example, the the evolution of our cranium relatives, the

35
00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:56.529
neanderthals or the diversification of, of the human cranium

36
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.290
across, you know, uh people living in the world

37
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.629
today, right? So we can think about these different,

38
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.680
I guess the different time scales. Um And if

39
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.410
you want to think about the kind of the

40
00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:10.460
broader time scale, I mean, the probably the two

41
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.259
biggest differences between our cranium and I say the

42
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.600
cranium of a chimpanzee is that we have um

43
00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:20.460
a really big uh brain case um relative to

44
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.339
a chimpanzee. Um So we hold a big brain.

45
00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.320
Um CHIMPANZEES have pretty big brains for their body

46
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.139
size, relative to, you know, other mammals, but humans

47
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:33.070
have even larger brains um relative to body size.

48
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.130
And then we also have a pretty small fish.

49
00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:38.304
So a chimpanzee has a pretty projecting, you know,

50
00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:41.985
snout um relative to a human. So those are

51
00:02:41.994 --> 00:02:44.865
sort of the two, you know, biggest uh differences

52
00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:47.074
that you can see there's lots of smaller scale

53
00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:49.294
differences as well. But, um, but those are the

54
00:02:49.304 --> 00:02:54.679
two biggest ones. Um And if we, we don't

55
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.479
really know what the last common ancestor looked like,

56
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.169
right? In terms of their. Um, SO, you know,

57
00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.779
so when there was a last common ancestor between

58
00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.460
us and chimpanzees and chimpanzees had their own sort

59
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.059
of evolutionary trajectory and we had our own evolutionary

60
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.649
trajectory for, you know, 6 to 8 million years.

61
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.119
Um So we didn't evolve from chimpanzees. You know,

62
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.070
there was a, there was an ancestor for both

63
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.110
of us, but from what we can tell from

64
00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:21.300
the fossil record for human evolution, um probably the

65
00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:23.880
last common ancestor had a small brain and a

66
00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.940
big face. So something that looked more like what

67
00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.710
we see in chimpanzees today. So a lot of

68
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.990
those, those changes um um that uh produce the

69
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.809
differences that we see today would have happened along

70
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.669
our, along our uh evolutionary lineage shows. So, for

71
00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:44.839
the 68 million years along our lineage. Um So

72
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.880
that's kind of a broad scale um of the

73
00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.910
cranium. But I'm, I'm also happy to talk about

74
00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.429
sort of the smaller scale as well.

75
00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:54.750
Sure. And we'll get into that, but it's also

76
00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.740
good that you gave us a little bit of

77
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.119
the timeline there because I was actually going to

78
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.960
ask you when studying the evolution of the human

79
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.440
cranium because we're talking about humans here I mean,

80
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.449
we can go back to the origins of the

81
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.550
homogeneous, but we can also go a little bit

82
00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:21.449
uh back uh at uh up till the possible

83
00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.829
last common ancestor with chimpanzees and australoids and those

84
00:04:26.838 --> 00:04:30.609
kinds of species. Right? I mean, we're not uh

85
00:04:30.618 --> 00:04:34.209
I mean, we don't need just to focus or

86
00:04:34.218 --> 00:04:36.558
to focus exclusively on the homogenous,

87
00:04:37.718 --> 00:04:42.119
right? That's right. That's right. Yeah. So we know

88
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.450
from genetics probably from, so looking at the DNA

89
00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:50.690
sequence, uh divergence, uh differences in DNA sequences between

90
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.029
us and chimpanzees. This is where the 6 to

91
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.839
8 million year date comes from, you know, roughly.

92
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.549
Um AND there's um there's some uncertainty there, right,

93
00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.609
in terms of like how rapidly these changes accumulate,

94
00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:04.690
that's why there's the, you know, this, this window

95
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.440
of time, the 6 to 8 million years that

96
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.049
I'm giving. Um But then we also have a

97
00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.239
fossil record um not so much on the chimpanzee

98
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.190
side. Um But on our side, we, we have

99
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.519
a fossil record that documents kind of their earliest

100
00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.850
um what we call uh hominins. So hominid is

101
00:05:22.859 --> 00:05:25.239
a sort of a, it's like a higher order

102
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.000
uh taxonomic category. Um And that includes um everything

103
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.100
that's sort of on our side of the split

104
00:05:32.109 --> 00:05:35.170
with chimpanzees. So all this in the past that

105
00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:37.940
are more closely related to us, to us. Homo

106
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.059
sapiens are more closely related to us than they

107
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.190
are to chimpanzees. Um And so what you were

108
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.380
talking about some of them like the Austra Pith

109
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.299
Australopithecus uh that genus. And um and yeah, and

110
00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:51.720
then the earliest members of our own genus Homo.

111
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.440
So not Homo sapiens but other members of, of

112
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.660
the genus Homo. Yeah. So we can talk about

113
00:05:56.739 --> 00:05:59.489
um all of that, that evolution of, of the

114
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.250
human cranium.

115
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.559
Mhm So maybe we can go step by step

116
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.529
here. But what would you say are the main

117
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:12.059
changes that we saw in the brain or not

118
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.149
the brain? Sorry, in the cranium. Uh FROM, let's

119
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.269
say, the very early ancestors, immediately after the last

120
00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:26.059
common ancestor with chimpanzees up till uh let's go

121
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.769
up till the homogenous now and then we'll talk

122
00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:29.450
about the rest.

123
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.709
Yeah. So the earliest uh kind of fossils. Um

124
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.679
So we have, we have a bunch of fossils

125
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.850
that are date to somewhere between maybe seven and

126
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.429
um maybe 5 million years ago. So this time

127
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.880
frame um that um that we think might be

128
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.529
hominids. But uh there's some debate as to whether

129
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.200
or not these fossils actually represent hominids. Um And

130
00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:02.000
then, um but after, you know, about 4 million

131
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.420
years ago, so down, so now we're talking about

132
00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:08.690
maybe fossils like uh Oslo Phe Azis, that's, that's

133
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.015
a little more than 3 million years ago. Um

134
00:07:11.024 --> 00:07:13.095
We're pretty sure that those are hominins and so

135
00:07:13.105 --> 00:07:15.135
we can think about, you know, how they uh

136
00:07:15.144 --> 00:07:18.265
how their, their cranium looks. Um So a lot

137
00:07:18.274 --> 00:07:20.934
of the difference is um if you just put

138
00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:24.225
um an oops afar cranium up and you compare

139
00:07:24.234 --> 00:07:26.054
it with a chimpanzee and you also compare it

140
00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:28.045
with a human, it really looks a lot like

141
00:07:28.054 --> 00:07:29.804
a chimpanzee. It looks a lot more like a

142
00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:32.765
chimpanzee that looks like a human. Um But some

143
00:07:32.774 --> 00:07:35.804
of the differences um is the base of the

144
00:07:35.815 --> 00:07:39.829
cranium. Um So the part of the head, um

145
00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:41.950
that, that sort of sits on top of the

146
00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:47.750
spinal column um seems to be oriented differently because

147
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.190
uh these uh these individuals were um bipedal. So

148
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.230
they were walking on, on, on two legs as

149
00:07:54.239 --> 00:07:57.329
opposed to on all fours. Um And so the

150
00:07:57.339 --> 00:07:59.829
head is sitting about top of the spinal column.

151
00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:02.230
Um And so the base of the, of the

152
00:08:02.239 --> 00:08:05.489
cranium uh is different than in the chimpanzees. So

153
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.010
that's one, you know, kind of big difference um

154
00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:11.440
that we see brain size is pretty similar to

155
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.709
what we see for a chimpanzee. So not much

156
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.864
change, maybe a little bit of an increase, but,

157
00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:19.524
but not much. Um There's also probably some changes

158
00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:23.024
in the teeth. Um And so those changes uh

159
00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:26.575
affect the jaws. Um And so, you know, maybe

160
00:08:26.584 --> 00:08:29.015
the face is a little bit different configuration that

161
00:08:29.024 --> 00:08:30.714
we see in the chimpanzee, but still a pretty

162
00:08:30.725 --> 00:08:34.880
projecting face. Um So those are the biggest things

163
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.640
we see um in the cranium kind of early

164
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.299
on. Um NOT so much. Um YOU know, not

165
00:08:41.308 --> 00:08:43.669
so many changes, you know, not so many differences,

166
00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.880
I should say, um, from what we see for,

167
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.679
for a chimpanzee, from a chimpanzee.

168
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.609
So then when we arrive at the very beginnings

169
00:08:52.619 --> 00:08:56.580
of the homogenous with homo erectus, I, I think

170
00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.609
that's the, the earliest species, right? Uh What are

171
00:09:00.869 --> 00:09:01.049
erectus?

172
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:02.809
Homo, erectus?

173
00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:05.250
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's other, there's other species

174
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.590
that we may be uh classify into homo, but

175
00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:11.780
there's, I guess there's some debate about whether or

176
00:09:11.789 --> 00:09:13.929
not they should be classified into our own genus

177
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.530
Homo. So probably the, the um earliest um sort

178
00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:21.299
of clear member of the genus Homo would be

179
00:09:21.309 --> 00:09:22.580
Homo erectus. Yeah.

180
00:09:23.109 --> 00:09:26.760
So some of those more ambiguous species that we

181
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.299
are not sure if we should classify as being

182
00:09:29.309 --> 00:09:32.969
part of the homogenous would include species like for

183
00:09:32.979 --> 00:09:35.130
example, Homo ho is that it?

184
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.669
That's right. That's right. Yeah. And I think most

185
00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:40.900
researchers consider hail as Homo, right? They put it

186
00:09:40.909 --> 00:09:44.530
in Homo. But um but yeah, but there's, there's

187
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.919
um there's maybe some clearer changes with Homo erectus.

188
00:09:48.929 --> 00:09:51.260
Um um IT'S, there's, I think there's a little

189
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.159
bit of uncertainty in that, that time period around,

190
00:09:54.299 --> 00:09:58.059
you know, homo habilis, um early homo erectus. So,

191
00:09:58.359 --> 00:10:00.690
yeah, but I'm also happy to talk about that

192
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:00.960
too.

193
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.619
Oh, ok. So when Homo erectus gets into the

194
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.770
picture of our evolution, what are the biggest changes

195
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:09.380
that occur?

196
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.260
Yeah. So there's definitely um changes in brain size.

197
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.039
So, um you have an increase in the in

198
00:10:19.049 --> 00:10:21.039
the brain case size of the brain case with

199
00:10:21.049 --> 00:10:27.049
homo erectus. Um You're uh still below what we

200
00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:31.960
see for homo sapiens, but um but substantially larger

201
00:10:31.969 --> 00:10:35.200
than, you know what we see for chimpanzees. So

202
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:39.780
um you know, like, yeah, let's say 22 or

203
00:10:39.789 --> 00:10:41.880
three times bigger than what we see for a

204
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:46.239
chimpanzee. So some somewhere in that range um and

205
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.559
you definitely have changes in the teeth. So the

206
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.250
like the hum the homo erectus has pretty human

207
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.979
like teeth. So what I'm talking about, things like

208
00:10:53.989 --> 00:10:57.820
um small canines. Um So humans have, have pretty

209
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.580
small canines. Our canines are, are um you know,

210
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.179
very similar to our incisors, stuff, the teeth at

211
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.619
the very front of the, the mouth. Um We

212
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.450
don't have these big projecting canines like you see

213
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.890
um in a dog or a cat or, or

214
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.150
chimpanzees, right? So we don't have those kind of

215
00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:17.369
canines. And so there's definitely changes um in the

216
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.890
teeth and changes in the face that are associated

217
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.760
with, with that. Uh And, and definitely clear evidence

218
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:28.299
for bipedalism. Um CLEAR evidence for probably walking and

219
00:11:28.309 --> 00:11:31.190
running and moving around the landscape uh kind of

220
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.969
in a way that's, that's, that would be very

221
00:11:32.979 --> 00:11:36.739
similar to us. Um And um and of course,

222
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.179
that has some consequences for the for the head

223
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.750
as well for the cranium. So, but yeah, I

224
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.900
would say the biggest changes have to do with

225
00:11:43.909 --> 00:11:46.460
the teeth and the associated changes in the jaws.

226
00:11:46.469 --> 00:11:49.059
And then um the changes the the big increase

227
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.030
in in brain cells.

228
00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:53.289
By the way, since you, since you mentioned also,

229
00:11:53.549 --> 00:11:57.080
if there um back in the time of homo

230
00:11:57.429 --> 00:12:01.359
erectus, I mean, how did their dentition compare to

231
00:12:01.369 --> 00:12:04.049
our Homo sapiens? I mean, in terms of, for

232
00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:07.390
example, the types of teeth, the number of each

233
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.669
type of teeth, like the premolars, the molars, the

234
00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:15.099
canines and the incisors, I mean, uh how close

235
00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:17.830
were they to what we have now?

236
00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:20.859
So they would have had they have the same

237
00:12:20.869 --> 00:12:23.659
number of, of, of teeth, right, in terms of

238
00:12:23.669 --> 00:12:26.349
overall, but then also the different categories. So the

239
00:12:26.359 --> 00:12:29.309
same number of incisors, the same number of canines,

240
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.340
premolars, molars, um and actually chimpanzees have that as

241
00:12:34.349 --> 00:12:37.380
well. So, so uh the last common ancestor would

242
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.159
have had that same uh dental pattern, right? The

243
00:12:40.169 --> 00:12:44.539
same dental formula uh to us. Um BUT um

244
00:12:44.549 --> 00:12:47.789
and actually homo erectus teeth actually look very similar

245
00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:51.140
to ours, right? So they have um small canine,

246
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.530
small incisors, um you know, pretty small molars and

247
00:12:54.539 --> 00:12:57.729
premolars, you know, like what humans have. Uh So

248
00:12:57.739 --> 00:13:00.659
yeah, pretty similar to us. Um THERE'S details of

249
00:13:00.669 --> 00:13:03.229
the teeth that, you know, specialists focus on but,

250
00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:05.650
but in a broad scale, they're, they're pretty similar

251
00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:06.159
to ours.

252
00:13:07.169 --> 00:13:11.390
A and then from Homo erectus to homo sapiens,

253
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.109
I mean, what is the clearest picture that we

254
00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:17.229
have now? I mean, is it Homo erectus? Homo

255
00:13:17.369 --> 00:13:22.049
heal heal begans and then Homo sapiens or are

256
00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:24.710
there other species in between?

257
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.919
Yeah, that's a good question. I think there's, there's

258
00:13:29.929 --> 00:13:33.530
a, there's some uncertainty with this. So, um you

259
00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:36.320
know, if we had had this uh this discussion,

260
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.219
um let's say 10 years ago or something. Um

261
00:13:40.229 --> 00:13:43.590
I would have said that um that Homo erectus

262
00:13:43.599 --> 00:13:46.719
gave rise to homo horns and then Homo Hagens

263
00:13:46.869 --> 00:13:50.030
was the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and

264
00:13:50.039 --> 00:13:56.219
neanderthals, Homo, Neanderthal lenses. Um Now, there's, I think

265
00:13:56.229 --> 00:14:01.609
some uncertainty about Homo Heidelberg and this um even

266
00:14:01.619 --> 00:14:04.820
is Homo hadar Beis even one thing. So the

267
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.669
fossils that we used to put in camo had

268
00:14:07.229 --> 00:14:10.460
organs, are they all part of the same species?

269
00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:16.239
Um And so I would say, um there's more

270
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.909
certainty that Homo erectus was broadly the last common

271
00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:23.650
ancestor of, you know, us and the inner tallest

272
00:14:23.679 --> 00:14:26.869
and then also Homo erectus originates in Africa, but

273
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.840
the Homo erectus of course, also spreads into Asia.

274
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.880
Um And there's um there's Homo erectus in Asia

275
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:37.440
until uh quite late in time um as well.

276
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.059
But what's exactly happening in the middle there, you

277
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.320
know, between a homo erectus and between um Homo

278
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.840
sapiens. And um also in Asia, there's definitely a

279
00:14:48.849 --> 00:14:53.510
group of fossils that you know, might be like,

280
00:14:53.789 --> 00:14:56.690
have evolved from Homo erectus directly, but they also

281
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.130
might be related in a different way um to

282
00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.349
maybe some of the other um other species like

283
00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:04.770
the Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. So I think there's

284
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.950
actually a lot of uncertainty there. Um Yeah. So

285
00:15:10.349 --> 00:15:13.789
anyway, I think, I think we, we, uh I

286
00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:15.669
think we're a little bit confused as to what's

287
00:15:15.679 --> 00:15:19.270
going on there at, at the moment. Um So,

288
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.820
um yeah, so, I mean, Homo Erectus was the

289
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:26.330
last common ancestor. So Homo erectus evolves in Africa.

290
00:15:26.729 --> 00:15:29.840
Um And Homo erectus is in Africa and Homo

291
00:15:29.869 --> 00:15:34.070
erectus expands out of Africa. And so, um but

292
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.380
there, there probably was some sort of intermediate species

293
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.340
um between Homo erectus and, you know, neanderthals and

294
00:15:41.349 --> 00:15:44.150
us, right? There was a species in there. Um

295
00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:47.690
And um and then there might have also been

296
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.549
some other uh species um Eastern Asia that, that

297
00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:56.690
um sort of derive, um maybe it's more closely

298
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.260
related to this, to this last common ancestors with

299
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.700
Neander Thal and, and, and humans. Um But yeah,

300
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:05.580
exactly what those species are and who uh um

301
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.260
what they're called. I think there's uncertainty. I mean,

302
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.179
I think we have fossils that probably represent that

303
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.869
species. But um but yeah, there's a lot of

304
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.659
uncertainty, I think now in terms of the classification

305
00:16:16.669 --> 00:16:17.750
of the fossils,

306
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.359
we're also going to get a little bit more

307
00:16:20.369 --> 00:16:25.039
into the relationship between neanderthals and Homo sapiens later

308
00:16:25.049 --> 00:16:28.760
on. But uh I mean, now that we've covered,

309
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.479
uh I mean, basically the main or what we

310
00:16:32.489 --> 00:16:36.039
think is the main timeline of human evolution here

311
00:16:36.289 --> 00:16:39.030
uh what are the main brain? Uh uh NOT

312
00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:43.840
brain, sorry, uranium changes that occur between homo erectus

313
00:16:43.849 --> 00:16:48.429
and homo Neanderthal lenses and uh sapiens.

314
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.780
Yeah. So, I mean, one big one is there's

315
00:16:51.789 --> 00:16:54.919
a big increase in brain cells um that happens.

316
00:16:55.359 --> 00:16:59.359
Um Both neanderthals and us have, have quite big

317
00:16:59.369 --> 00:17:04.598
brains uh relative to um homo erectus and um

318
00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:08.650
particularly their early homo erectus, right? So the earliest

319
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.939
fossils of homo erectus that are found in Africa.

320
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:13.140
And we can also do things where we try

321
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.750
to estimate the body weight of the body mass

322
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.390
of, of uh these different species and we can

323
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.199
look at brain size relative to body size. Um

324
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.598
And um it makes sense to think about that

325
00:17:26.608 --> 00:17:28.689
because if you have a really small animal or

326
00:17:28.699 --> 00:17:31.270
a really big animal, right? Uh The small animal

327
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.540
is gonna have a small brain because everything is

328
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.040
small, a big animal is gonna have a big

329
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.760
brain because everything is big. Um So thinking about

330
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.650
brain size, relative to body size can maybe be

331
00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.300
a more useful way of thinking about um brain

332
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.979
size. And um yeah, so there's a big increase

333
00:17:46.989 --> 00:17:49.339
in absolute brain size, but also seems like a

334
00:17:49.349 --> 00:17:51.900
big increase in relative brain size. So brain size

335
00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.719
relative to body size. Um AND that's happening in

336
00:17:54.729 --> 00:17:56.949
our lineage and it's also happening in the NATO

337
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.050
lineage and actually the late homo erectus in, in,

338
00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.400
in uh in Asia um also has a bigger

339
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.660
brain size than early homo erectus. So there's these

340
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.890
changes in brain size, sort of three parallel changes

341
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.849
in brain size. So they're at least to a

342
00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:16.770
certain extent, independent of each other, which is kind

343
00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.569
of interesting actually, um that you know that you

344
00:18:19.579 --> 00:18:22.819
have the similar changes in these different lineages. Um

345
00:18:22.829 --> 00:18:27.859
Homo sapiens um also has um a smaller face

346
00:18:27.869 --> 00:18:32.760
than what we see in um Homo erectus. Neanderthals

347
00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:37.599
um have a smaller face um on the sides

348
00:18:38.079 --> 00:18:40.280
but not so much along the middle. So the

349
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.969
mid part of the face is neanderthals remains big,

350
00:18:42.979 --> 00:18:45.520
but the sides, you know, kind of get smaller.

351
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.819
So there's probably a decrease in the face size

352
00:18:47.829 --> 00:18:50.920
and neanderthals as well, but not all across the

353
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:54.349
face like what we see. So those are big

354
00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:59.599
changes um that we see. Um I maybe I'll

355
00:18:59.609 --> 00:19:01.869
stop there because we'll talk more about the differences

356
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.569
between neanderthals and, and us. Um I think as

357
00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:05.189
we proceed

358
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
and, and, but looking across all these history of

359
00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.719
the evolution of the human cranium, what would you

360
00:19:11.729 --> 00:19:15.609
say are perhaps the main factors and selective pressures

361
00:19:15.619 --> 00:19:17.099
that play the role there?

362
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.520
Yeah. So there are these increases in brain size

363
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:27.489
that we see. Um And you know, we, you

364
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.979
know, we have um I, I should say, you

365
00:19:29.989 --> 00:19:31.920
know, we, you know, you have variation in brain

366
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:35.189
size and in humans, right? Living today. Um AND

367
00:19:35.199 --> 00:19:38.569
there's no kind of evidence that that is related

368
00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:41.569
to kind of anything uh like what we consider,

369
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.189
maybe intelligence, something like intelligence is also very hard

370
00:19:45.199 --> 00:19:47.439
to measure, right. So it's, it's, it's not, it's

371
00:19:47.449 --> 00:19:49.209
not a, it's not an easy thing to, to,

372
00:19:49.219 --> 00:19:52.609
to um to look at. Um BUT over this

373
00:19:52.619 --> 00:19:55.390
really broad scale where we have these big changes

374
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.150
in brain size, um you know, we think that

375
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.439
it's probably related to something having to do with

376
00:20:01.449 --> 00:20:05.520
cognition. Um And, you know, the brain is um

377
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:08.410
is costly, it's a costly tissue. Uh uh IT

378
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.949
uses a lot of energy. Um And so, you

379
00:20:11.959 --> 00:20:13.810
know, I think we generally think that the brain

380
00:20:13.819 --> 00:20:16.660
must be doing something um kind of important functionally

381
00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:20.000
because otherwise, uh why would the uh the body,

382
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.400
um why would you expend so much energy? Right?

383
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.030
Why does your body expend so much energy? So,

384
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.920
um you know, so we think that those increases

385
00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.869
in brain size probably have to do with some

386
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.930
changes in, in cognition. Um But we're not sure

387
00:20:34.939 --> 00:20:38.959
exactly what, what those are. Um It's interesting that

388
00:20:38.969 --> 00:20:42.719
it's happening in parallel in different lineages. So it

389
00:20:42.729 --> 00:20:46.239
seems like whatever, however natural selection is acting, it's

390
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.599
acting in sort of the same way across these

391
00:20:48.609 --> 00:20:52.180
different geographic regions. But beyond that, I think it's

392
00:20:52.189 --> 00:20:55.430
hard to say, uh hard to say exactly um

393
00:20:55.439 --> 00:20:59.150
what's going on, the changes in um the, the

394
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.310
face um and the teeth um are probably related

395
00:21:04.319 --> 00:21:08.479
to diet. Um And they're probably related to um

396
00:21:08.959 --> 00:21:13.510
changes in technology that we see. Um AND so

397
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.829
um probably more um processing of foods with technology

398
00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:20.310
as opposed to the processing of foods with, with

399
00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:22.930
your, you know, with the body, right? Um So

400
00:21:22.939 --> 00:21:25.189
you don't need um a big face, you don't

401
00:21:25.199 --> 00:21:26.930
need big teeth, you don't need those things to

402
00:21:26.939 --> 00:21:29.089
process the food as much if you're using tools,

403
00:21:29.099 --> 00:21:31.810
for example, to process the food. Um So in

404
00:21:31.819 --> 00:21:35.199
terms of the broad scale changes, those are um

405
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.920
probably um factors that are involved, but it's, you

406
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.859
know, it's difficult to say for sure, you know

407
00:21:40.869 --> 00:21:44.300
what, what the factors um we have um I

408
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.369
guess correlations that we can see between uh you

409
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.469
know, changes in technology and changes in anatomy. But

410
00:21:50.479 --> 00:21:54.619
um it's hard to really um establish causal relationships

411
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:55.260
there.

412
00:21:55.979 --> 00:21:58.479
And when it comes to diet, I would imagine

413
00:21:58.489 --> 00:22:02.790
that particularly from Homo erectus onwards, fire played a

414
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.880
big role there. Fire and cooking.

415
00:22:05.219 --> 00:22:08.500
Right. Yes. Yes. Uh Yes. So fire. So there's

416
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:12.079
definitely evidence of fire that goes back to the

417
00:22:12.089 --> 00:22:16.280
time of um kind of early Homo erectus. Um

418
00:22:16.319 --> 00:22:22.750
IN Africa. Um THEY um one of the things

419
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.500
I think that's tricky with fire though is you

420
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.310
can also have natural fires. And so sometimes it's

421
00:22:27.319 --> 00:22:31.500
hard to um distinguish between that and, and fires

422
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:35.310
that are produced by, by humans or hominids. Um

423
00:22:36.599 --> 00:22:40.609
There's definitely very good evidence for fire like fireplaces

424
00:22:40.619 --> 00:22:43.709
kind of thing. Uh Going back to maybe 400,000

425
00:22:43.719 --> 00:22:48.640
years ago. So, um, and, um, but there's a,

426
00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.500
there's also also earlier evidence of fire as well,

427
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.560
but I think it's a little bit spot here.

428
00:22:53.569 --> 00:22:56.420
Um, BUT probably, yes, I mean, I, I think

429
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.109
to the broader point, I think cooking was probably

430
00:22:59.119 --> 00:23:02.160
important and it was probably involved, um, in processing

431
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:05.459
the food and breaking down the food. Uh, SO

432
00:23:05.469 --> 00:23:08.589
that, um, you know, you break down the food

433
00:23:08.599 --> 00:23:10.920
and, um, your body can then absorb, you know,

434
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.359
more of the nutrients, um, in the food, um,

435
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.280
uh, by, by cooking it. And so, yes, I

436
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.290
think, I think cooking was, was, was certainly involved

437
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.969
but exactly the timing of when that came in,

438
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.219
I think is a little bit, um, more difficult

439
00:23:25.229 --> 00:23:29.199
to say, um, because the, you know, the really

440
00:23:29.209 --> 00:23:32.219
good evidence for cooking goes back to maybe 400,000

441
00:23:32.229 --> 00:23:33.920
years ago and then there was kind of spotty

442
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.319
evidence earlier than that.

443
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.430
Mhm. Yeah. But, but that, that really messed up

444
00:23:39.439 --> 00:23:43.020
with a very important role. I guess that both

445
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.739
when it comes to dentition but also the size

446
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:51.119
of the brain. Right? Because with fire breaking macro

447
00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:56.020
molecules and, uh, it becoming easier for, uh, the

448
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.430
stomach and the intestines to really digest the food

449
00:23:59.439 --> 00:24:03.219
and to extract more nutrients from it. Uh, IT

450
00:24:03.229 --> 00:24:05.660
really was a game changer.

451
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.270
Right. Yeah, I think that's true. I think that's

452
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.069
true. And talking about how the brain is expensive

453
00:24:11.079 --> 00:24:15.459
Right. It's an expensive organ. Um, SO having these

454
00:24:15.469 --> 00:24:19.489
kind of high quality, um, energy sources, right. Um,

455
00:24:19.859 --> 00:24:22.079
uh, IS really important if you're gonna have a

456
00:24:22.089 --> 00:24:24.819
big brain. And, um, and so food, uh, so

457
00:24:24.829 --> 00:24:28.900
cooking is probably important also, probably the introduction of

458
00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.569
animal, you know, products. Um, YOU know, things like

459
00:24:31.579 --> 00:24:34.979
meat, um, marrow, other things, those are probably important

460
00:24:34.989 --> 00:24:38.780
as well. Um, SO, yeah, there's, I, I agree,

461
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.569
I agree with you. Yeah. Mhm.

462
00:24:40.869 --> 00:24:44.189
And, and what about climate? Do we know if

463
00:24:44.199 --> 00:24:49.449
climate played any role at all in the evolution

464
00:24:49.459 --> 00:24:50.380
of the human gra?

465
00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:57.040
So climate probably did play a role in. Um

466
00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:01.959
Well, certainly, um it played a role in maybe

467
00:25:01.969 --> 00:25:04.239
some of the differences in the cranium that we

468
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.500
see across the world today, right? So that probably

469
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.880
at that sort of smaller scale, it may have

470
00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:15.119
played a role in the differences between us and

471
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.719
neanderthals, right? So there may be climate may be

472
00:25:17.729 --> 00:25:24.880
involved there. Um I would say, I'm not sure

473
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.319
if climate probab, I wouldn't say climate played a

474
00:25:28.329 --> 00:25:32.339
role um in, for example, the differences between Homo

475
00:25:32.349 --> 00:25:37.609
sapiens and Homo erectus. Um I mean, there's climate

476
00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:40.040
changes that are happening kind of all through this

477
00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.329
uh global climate changes that are happening and those

478
00:25:42.339 --> 00:25:45.829
are changing the environments that these different hominids are

479
00:25:45.839 --> 00:25:48.719
living in and you know, that may be influenced

480
00:25:48.729 --> 00:25:51.760
uh the selective pressures. It also may be influenced

481
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.829
the migrations of different hominids, you know, so there,

482
00:25:54.839 --> 00:25:57.479
the climate was probably involved in those ways, but

483
00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.989
I wouldn't say that, you know, the homosa cranium

484
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.369
looks different from Homo erectus cranium. And it's because

485
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.920
of some sort of climatic adaptation either in us

486
00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.219
or in Homo erectus. I don't think climate is

487
00:26:09.229 --> 00:26:11.589
a, is a big factor at, at that scale.

488
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.680
So, uh I would like to ask you about

489
00:26:15.689 --> 00:26:20.329
other uh traits that you've also studied. But just

490
00:26:20.339 --> 00:26:23.510
before we get into that, just by looking at

491
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.939
the human cranium, uh is it possible for us

492
00:26:27.949 --> 00:26:32.839
to uh I mean, derive information about other aspects

493
00:26:32.849 --> 00:26:35.680
of human evolution ju just from it?

494
00:26:38.329 --> 00:26:40.959
Um I mean, I'm not sure exactly if I

495
00:26:40.969 --> 00:26:41.880
understand the question.

496
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.270
Yeah. So for example, earlier, you talked about how

497
00:26:46.599 --> 00:26:49.880
looking at the human cranium and noticing the differences

498
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.989
between our cranium and the cranium of chimpanzees, we

499
00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:58.030
really notice are we are able to at least

500
00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:03.949
infer some information about how exactly bipedalism would have

501
00:27:03.959 --> 00:27:07.109
started, right? Because of the position of the Foramen

502
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:09.969
magnum, right? That is at the base at the

503
00:27:09.979 --> 00:27:12.949
basis of our uranium and connects the brain to

504
00:27:12.959 --> 00:27:15.920
the spinal cord and all of that. Uh So

505
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.400
uh I mean, that's an example. Are there other

506
00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:24.300
examples of other aspects of human anatomy or other

507
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:28.319
aspects of our evolution which we can derive information

508
00:27:28.329 --> 00:27:30.880
about by studying the human brain?

509
00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.520
Yeah, I mean, I guess we've talked about some

510
00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:38.609
things, right? We've talked about diet um we've talked

511
00:27:38.619 --> 00:27:47.329
about maybe cognition um there or maybe in information

512
00:27:47.339 --> 00:27:52.849
about things like, um you know, balance the organs,

513
00:27:52.859 --> 00:27:55.180
you know, things that involved in balance and maybe

514
00:27:55.189 --> 00:27:58.680
how is that involved with locomotion? Right? Um So

515
00:27:58.689 --> 00:28:00.469
not just the position of the frame of magnum,

516
00:28:00.479 --> 00:28:02.739
but some of the uh kind of more internal,

517
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.939
you know, kind of structures um that we could

518
00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:11.239
see in the cranium. Um I mean, those are

519
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:15.819
probably the main things um maybe I'm forgetting something,

520
00:28:15.829 --> 00:28:18.099
but those are probably the main things that I

521
00:28:18.109 --> 00:28:19.079
think we can tell.

522
00:28:19.459 --> 00:28:24.290
OK. And, and does something like childbirth connect in

523
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.910
any way to the evolution of our ukra.

524
00:28:28.079 --> 00:28:34.189
Uh Yes. Yes. Uh And so, um so if

525
00:28:34.199 --> 00:28:37.380
we think about childbirth in humans, right? And we

526
00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.359
have, so if we go back to the last

527
00:28:41.369 --> 00:28:45.359
common ancestor with chimpanzees, um and we think about

528
00:28:45.369 --> 00:28:48.550
um the pelvis, right? So the baby has to

529
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.170
pass through the pelvis to be born. Um You

530
00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:55.160
know, probably the last common ancestor had a pelvis

531
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.420
that looked more similar to a chimpanzee pelvis than

532
00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:03.500
to a human pelvis. And so, um when you

533
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.819
have the origins of bipedalism, you actually have some

534
00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:09.880
changes that happen in the pelvis um relative to,

535
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.219
to uh to what we see with, with chimpanzees,

536
00:29:12.229 --> 00:29:16.880
but also probably the last common ancestor and those

537
00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:21.699
rearrangements then interact with these increases in brain size

538
00:29:21.709 --> 00:29:24.079
that we actually see much later in human evolution.

539
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:28.469
And what happens is uh because the brain gets

540
00:29:28.479 --> 00:29:30.550
bigger, it's not just the adult brain that gets

541
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.130
bigger, it's also the newborn individual's brain that gets

542
00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.150
bigger. Um And so you have this problem of

543
00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.099
fitting a large brain, a large head um through

544
00:29:40.109 --> 00:29:43.030
a pretty small, you know, birth canal. And that

545
00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.020
has to do, I think with the interaction with

546
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.030
between changes that happened early on in human evolution

547
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.560
that are associated with bipedalism. Um And then these

548
00:29:50.569 --> 00:29:53.180
changes that happened later in human evolution that are

549
00:29:53.189 --> 00:29:55.770
these increases in brain size. Yeah. So I think

550
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.569
the cranium does interact with um with the pelvis

551
00:29:59.579 --> 00:30:01.599
um in terms of childbirth

552
00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:05.719
and that also connects to some of the common

553
00:30:05.729 --> 00:30:09.020
complications we see in childbirth.

554
00:30:09.569 --> 00:30:13.469
Right. Yes. Yes. Um Yes, I mean, we have

555
00:30:13.479 --> 00:30:17.099
a pretty constricted um birth canal relative to the

556
00:30:17.109 --> 00:30:20.589
size of the baby's head. Um The dimensions of

557
00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:23.349
the mom's birth canal are roughly the same size

558
00:30:23.359 --> 00:30:25.660
as the dimensions of the head, the baby's head

559
00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.829
that have to pass through there. Um I mean,

560
00:30:28.839 --> 00:30:31.359
that's the case in some other primates as well,

561
00:30:31.369 --> 00:30:35.770
but in um great apes. So chimpanzees, gorillas orangutans,

562
00:30:35.819 --> 00:30:39.150
um they have a much less constricted um birth

563
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.689
canal. So the baby's head is much smaller than

564
00:30:41.699 --> 00:30:43.479
what you the size of the birth canal they

565
00:30:43.489 --> 00:30:46.550
have to pass through. So that's definitely something um

566
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:50.790
that um that's a result of that. Um There's

567
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.589
probably other things that are involved. Um Right. Having

568
00:30:53.599 --> 00:30:55.709
to do with, um, with, you know, more sort

569
00:30:55.719 --> 00:30:58.650
of current medical practices that, you know, that are

570
00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:00.750
also involved as well. So, I wouldn't say it

571
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.229
explains all of the things, all the complications that

572
00:31:03.239 --> 00:31:05.869
we have in childbirth today. But, uh, but it's,

573
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.989
um, it's probably part of the story at least.

574
00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:08.910
Mhm.

575
00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:09.569
Yeah.

576
00:31:09.839 --> 00:31:13.329
So let's get into n do to then. So

577
00:31:13.469 --> 00:31:16.910
do we know exactly when they first appeared?

578
00:31:19.459 --> 00:31:22.520
Yeah. Uh Yes, I mean, yes and no. Uh

579
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:28.239
Right. So, um we um from genetic evidence, um

580
00:31:29.369 --> 00:31:31.670
we think that we shared the last common ancestor

581
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.500
with them about maybe 600,000 years ago. Although there's

582
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.030
some, there's some uncertainty is that in that as

583
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.829
well, kind of like what we talked about with

584
00:31:39.839 --> 00:31:40.770
the chimpanzees

585
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.209
and, and that, that common ancestor, would it have

586
00:31:44.219 --> 00:31:47.829
anything to do with Heidelberg or not?

587
00:31:48.619 --> 00:31:51.599
Uh I think before we used to say that

588
00:31:51.609 --> 00:31:54.140
the common ancestor was homo had borgens. Now, I

589
00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:58.949
think we're less certain about that. Um So some

590
00:31:58.959 --> 00:32:02.699
of the fossils that were considered Homo Haber sis

591
00:32:02.709 --> 00:32:05.930
um in the past maybe represent the last common

592
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.890
ancestor or they're closely related to that last common

593
00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:13.349
ancestor. But yeah, so the, the Neanderthal lineage then

594
00:32:13.359 --> 00:32:18.119
starts around 600,000 years ago. But then it, it

595
00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:20.550
does become a little bit of a, a matter

596
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.079
of definition. Um When you say that the neanderthals

597
00:32:24.089 --> 00:32:28.920
themselves start. Um So, you know, we have um

598
00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:33.390
fossils that are considered, um, the classic neanderthals. So

599
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.479
these are those fossils that were, um, kind of

600
00:32:35.489 --> 00:32:40.459
originally described as neanderthals. And, um, you know, most

601
00:32:40.469 --> 00:32:44.270
of those fossils are younger than 100,000 years old.

602
00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.859
So they're pretty recent, right? In, in terms of

603
00:32:47.869 --> 00:32:50.300
the, the time scale that we're talking about for

604
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:54.969
human evolution, the um the oldest fossils that sort

605
00:32:54.979 --> 00:32:58.390
of kind of clearly look more like these classic

606
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.640
neanderthals, maybe go back to just a little after

607
00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:03.959
200,000 years ago. So those are the kind of

608
00:33:03.969 --> 00:33:06.500
the oldest. So you could then say that neanderthals

609
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:10.810
start around 200,000 years ago. But we also have

610
00:33:10.819 --> 00:33:13.650
fossils that are older than this, that date to

611
00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.239
more than 400,000 years ago that have a lot

612
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.859
of the characteristics of neanderthals, so that a lot

613
00:33:18.869 --> 00:33:21.569
of these features. Um And there's also some genetic

614
00:33:21.579 --> 00:33:24.530
evidence that links them with the classic neanderthals as

615
00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.219
well. So maybe you could also then put the

616
00:33:27.229 --> 00:33:30.000
start of neanderthals back to more than 400,000 years

617
00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:34.319
ago. Um But yeah, because it's an evolving lineage,

618
00:33:34.329 --> 00:33:36.630
then it, it does maybe become a little bit

619
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.310
arbitrary where you draw the line. Um So the

620
00:33:39.319 --> 00:33:42.449
start of the lineage is maybe 600,000 years ago,

621
00:33:42.719 --> 00:33:46.619
but when you actually say neanderthals start um becomes

622
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:50.469
a little bit arbitrary. Um And there's, I wouldn't

623
00:33:50.479 --> 00:33:53.180
say there's strong like disagreement in that. Um It's

624
00:33:53.189 --> 00:33:56.339
contentious but uh I think there's some, you know,

625
00:33:56.349 --> 00:33:59.250
there's discussion about exactly where you put that start.

626
00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.189
Um, AND that's just because you're, you're basically taking

627
00:34:02.199 --> 00:34:05.079
a continuous process. Um, AND you're, you know, just

628
00:34:05.089 --> 00:34:08.969
sort of dividing it, um, somewhat arbitrarily, but I

629
00:34:08.978 --> 00:34:11.550
would say the classic Neanderthal. So the N tolls

630
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.550
that we sort of associate with the AOLS that

631
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.780
were first described, let's say they start a little

632
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:19.949
after 200,000 years ago, but there's definitely Neanderthal ancestors

633
00:34:19.958 --> 00:34:21.668
that have a lot of the characteristics in the

634
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.350
ans that go back um from the fossil record

635
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.228
more than 400,000 years ago.

636
00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:30.870
And where do they appear? And what do we

637
00:34:30.879 --> 00:34:32.899
know about their migrations?

638
00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:38.510
Yeah. So the um these Neanderthal ancestors, the oldest

639
00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.219
fossils um that we're talking about here um actually

640
00:34:42.228 --> 00:34:44.780
come from Spain. So they come from the, the

641
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:50.239
Sima de Los Hueso um and Atapuerca Spain. Um

642
00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.760
And uh so those fossils date to um 430,000

643
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:58.360
years old. Um And they have um yeah, so

644
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:01.040
they have a number of these nal features. So

645
00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.560
uh these characteristics and I mean, we can talk

646
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.429
about them, but there's, there's anatomical characteristics that we

647
00:35:06.439 --> 00:35:09.350
associate with neanderthals. And these fossils from, from Spain

648
00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.439
have those features. There's also some DNA evidence that,

649
00:35:12.449 --> 00:35:15.100
that links them with the neanderthals as well. So

650
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.629
that would be um those would be the oldest

651
00:35:18.639 --> 00:35:25.010
representatives, um the oldest classic neanderthals um also come

652
00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:29.629
from Europe. So um you know, so different places

653
00:35:29.639 --> 00:35:32.340
in Europe. So, um for example, there's some fossils

654
00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.699
from Italy, um that are some of the oldest

655
00:35:34.709 --> 00:35:38.280
ones, some fossils from France. So, yeah, so we

656
00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.520
think that the origin of the Neanderthals was in

657
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.080
Europe. Um As far as we can tell, um,

658
00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:47.000
that's where this Neanderthal lineage appears. Um And I

659
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.360
guess your second question was about, about migrations. Yes.

660
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.979
Ok. Um Yeah. So it's a little hard to

661
00:35:54.989 --> 00:35:59.889
tell, um exactly the timing of different migrations. But

662
00:36:00.429 --> 00:36:02.330
uh one thing we can say is we can

663
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:06.149
look at the geographic range of the neanderthals. And

664
00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:09.449
so, um, you know, there's neanderthals that are uh

665
00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:13.750
south um into the western parts of Asia. So,

666
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.300
um places like Israel, uh places like Iraq, right?

667
00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:21.120
So down into there, um there's also neanderthals uh

668
00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:23.830
pretty far east. So, like there's a fossils, for

669
00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.010
example, in um Uzbekistan. Um But then there's also

670
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.260
some DNA evidence that goes further east right into

671
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:33.110
more like the central part of Asia. Um And

672
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.949
so they had, and then they, of course, they

673
00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:36.989
were on the west, right? We really talked about

674
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.199
Spain. Um AND um also going, you know, north

675
00:36:41.209 --> 00:36:44.510
um into places like Germany and, um right, so

676
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.669
they have a, they have a big, um they

677
00:36:46.679 --> 00:36:52.979
have a big geographic range. Um AND, um, you

678
00:36:52.989 --> 00:36:58.389
know, there's um some, you know, maybe evidence about

679
00:36:58.399 --> 00:37:02.399
timing of, of things. So, um it maybe seems

680
00:37:02.409 --> 00:37:05.239
to be evidence that maybe they migrated down kind

681
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:08.139
of south into the western parts of Asia. Um

682
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.360
And then, um so, you know, they, they were,

683
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:16.719
um so, you know, interesting, there were some Homo

684
00:37:16.729 --> 00:37:19.020
sapiens fossils that are actually older than the Neanderthal

685
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.439
fossils from that part of the world. But then

686
00:37:21.449 --> 00:37:23.679
what seems like happened is actually the neanderthals may

687
00:37:23.689 --> 00:37:25.919
be migrated down into there and the Homo sapiens

688
00:37:25.929 --> 00:37:28.639
may be migrated back into Africa or just, you

689
00:37:28.649 --> 00:37:30.719
know, kind of disappeared from that region. And then

690
00:37:30.729 --> 00:37:33.899
Homo sapiens comes out of Africa later and replaces

691
00:37:33.909 --> 00:37:37.139
the neanderthals. And so, yeah, but in terms of

692
00:37:37.149 --> 00:37:39.540
the timing of exactly when they moved to these

693
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.929
different, um, regions, it's a little harder to tell.

694
00:37:42.939 --> 00:37:45.459
Um, BUT they did definitely had a very big

695
00:37:45.469 --> 00:37:47.830
geographic range and they were, um, you know, as

696
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.620
we just talked about, um, they were around for

697
00:37:49.629 --> 00:37:52.770
hundreds of thousands of years. So there's, um, yeah,

698
00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.379
so, um, um, they were living in lots of

699
00:37:56.389 --> 00:38:01.020
different um environments. Um If we look at the,

700
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:03.429
the species that they were eating, right, the prey

701
00:38:03.439 --> 00:38:06.239
species, um, you know, they were preying on different,

702
00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:10.100
uh, various different, um, ungulates, like large, large mammals

703
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:12.889
that they were eating. Um, AND they, they varied

704
00:38:12.899 --> 00:38:15.610
across, you know, the, the, the, the ranges that,

705
00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.439
you know, they were living in, right. So they,

706
00:38:17.449 --> 00:38:18.850
you know, they were living, they were eating like

707
00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.120
reindeer in some places and, um, you know, horse

708
00:38:23.129 --> 00:38:25.030
in other places. Right. So, there were, there was

709
00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.449
a lot of variety of, of habitats, I guess

710
00:38:27.459 --> 00:38:28.939
that they were living in. So,

711
00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:34.270
do we have any idea exactly when Homo sapiens

712
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:38.360
and neanderthals first get in contact with each other?

713
00:38:40.139 --> 00:38:46.000
Yeah. So, I mean, there's from, so when we

714
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:49.209
look at the DNA of people living today, um,

715
00:38:50.919 --> 00:38:54.610
people have ancestry out of, outside of Africa, so

716
00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:59.429
out Africa and also some, um individuals from Africa

717
00:38:59.439 --> 00:39:02.300
as well, um have a small percentage of their,

718
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:04.939
of their genome. Um That seems like it came

719
00:39:04.949 --> 00:39:10.570
from the anal. And um it's interesting because um

720
00:39:10.889 --> 00:39:13.330
this is also found in, for example, like native

721
00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:16.909
North Americans or native South Americans like parts of

722
00:39:16.919 --> 00:39:19.500
the world where we don't think um there were

723
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.510
ever neanderthals, right? So there was no kind of

724
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.820
contact that was happening um in that part of

725
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:29.469
the world. So it makes sense from this distribution

726
00:39:29.479 --> 00:39:32.340
of, of the DNA, uh Neanderthal DNA and people

727
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.550
living today that when Homo sapiens migrates out of

728
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:40.389
Africa shortly after they migrate out of Africa, um

729
00:39:40.449 --> 00:39:43.459
they come into contact with neanderthals and there's some

730
00:39:43.469 --> 00:39:46.590
uh genetic exchange that happens there and then that

731
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.389
DNA that was exchanged, the Neanderthal DNA that comes

732
00:39:49.399 --> 00:39:52.570
into the Homo Sapiens population then gets propagated to

733
00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:56.040
be, you know, most people in the world today,

734
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:58.800
right? Um And so there was probably some sort

735
00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:03.310
of contact in the Southwester parts of Asia. Um

736
00:40:04.929 --> 00:40:08.219
BUT we also have evidence that um homo sapiens

737
00:40:08.229 --> 00:40:12.139
came into contact with neanderthals in, for example, in

738
00:40:12.149 --> 00:40:16.929
Europe. Um BECAUSE there's some sites um where uh

739
00:40:16.939 --> 00:40:20.969
we've able to um extract ancient DNA and some

740
00:40:20.979 --> 00:40:24.360
of those fossils actually have more Neanderthal DNA than

741
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:26.820
we see in people living today. Um And this

742
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.449
has been interpreted as it was because there was

743
00:40:29.459 --> 00:40:32.530
some additional contact with neanderthals, you know, that happened

744
00:40:32.699 --> 00:40:35.699
um after that contact, that was in the Southwester

745
00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:39.850
parts of Asia. So, um but you know, there

746
00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:44.550
also could have been earlier contact. So, um you

747
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.090
know, if we think about, you have this last

748
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.899
common ancestor that lived 600,000 years ago and you

749
00:40:48.909 --> 00:40:52.530
have these evolving lineages. Um AND the contact that

750
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.850
I'm that I had just talked about, right, would

751
00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.159
have started maybe 50 or 60,000 years ago. Um

752
00:40:58.169 --> 00:41:00.219
But there might have been also some contact that

753
00:41:00.229 --> 00:41:04.770
was earlier than that. Um And um for example,

754
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.399
like I said, we have Neanderthal fossils in places

755
00:41:07.409 --> 00:41:10.280
like Israel. Um And we have early Homo sapiens

756
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.060
fossils in places like Israel and the Homo sapiens

757
00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:16.040
fossils. Uh GO back to about 100,000 years ago,

758
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.760
maybe some of the Neanderthal fossils are actually that

759
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:20.449
old as well. So there might have been some

760
00:41:20.459 --> 00:41:22.679
sort of contact that was happening, you know, back

761
00:41:22.689 --> 00:41:27.300
then. Um So, but I would say the, the,

762
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:30.229
um the more um certain contact would have been

763
00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:32.620
in the Southwester parts of Asia. And then there

764
00:41:32.629 --> 00:41:34.780
would have been some additional contact that happened in

765
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:39.419
Europe. Um PROBABLY shortly after that. So maybe like

766
00:41:39.429 --> 00:41:42.290
the initial contact was 50 60,000 years ago and

767
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:45.459
then the later contact was maybe 40,000 years ago.

768
00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:47.719
So some, some in that, in that time period,

769
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.540
but people have made arguments that there was earlier

770
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:53.850
contact, right? Maybe even going back hundreds of thousands

771
00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:57.469
of years. Um um So there wasn't complete, you

772
00:41:57.479 --> 00:42:01.409
know, isolation of these, of these uh evolutionary lineages

773
00:42:01.459 --> 00:42:05.479
from 600,000 years ago, up to say 50,000 years

774
00:42:05.489 --> 00:42:07.310
ago, there might have been some contact that was

775
00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.909
happening, you know, in the, in the intervening period.

776
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:15.239
Yeah. So because we know that there was interbreeding

777
00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:20.389
between homo sapiens and hone Neanderthal lenses. Uh And

778
00:42:20.689 --> 00:42:25.159
we see genetic admixture between the two, I will

779
00:42:25.169 --> 00:42:28.530
call them species just for, just to make it

780
00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:32.510
easier. But, yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um

781
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:36.959
I mean, in, in anthropology more generally, but perhaps

782
00:42:36.969 --> 00:42:44.040
in maybe biological anthropology and paleoanthropology more specifically, how

783
00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:47.149
do people tend to look at the relationship between

784
00:42:47.159 --> 00:42:50.310
them? I mean, are we talking about the same

785
00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.389
species here or not?

786
00:42:53.219 --> 00:42:55.310
Yeah, I mean, so, uh you're bringing up a,

787
00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:58.300
um an important point. So, I mean, there's, so

788
00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:02.110
there's different definitions of what a species is. Um

789
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:07.110
And certainly by some definitions, uh neanderthals are a

790
00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.629
different species, right? So there's, there's some definitions that

791
00:43:10.639 --> 00:43:12.639
where you would say, yes, they clearly look like

792
00:43:12.649 --> 00:43:15.570
a different species. Um And so in that sense,

793
00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.629
it makes sense to call them a different species.

794
00:43:17.639 --> 00:43:22.020
Um But um if you mean by species that,

795
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:24.979
you know, they couldn't produce, you know, fertile offspring,

796
00:43:24.989 --> 00:43:27.429
right? Um That's clearly not the case with the

797
00:43:27.439 --> 00:43:30.459
neanderthals and, and us, right? There was um as,

798
00:43:30.469 --> 00:43:32.959
as we've just talked about, right. Clearly, they could

799
00:43:32.969 --> 00:43:37.219
produce fertile offspring. Um There were um there may

800
00:43:37.229 --> 00:43:41.260
have been some reproductive barriers but um but uh

801
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:45.780
clearly, uh there wasn't uh reproductive isolation between them.

802
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:50.179
So, in that sense, there, I think, um depending

803
00:43:50.189 --> 00:43:53.739
on your question, um it's maybe useful to think

804
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:56.030
about them as different species. And then for maybe

805
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.419
for other questions, it's more useful actually to think

806
00:43:58.429 --> 00:44:02.310
about them, more like um a population of, of

807
00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.860
humans. So, um you know, just like we think

808
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:08.479
about, you know, different um humans around the planet

809
00:44:08.489 --> 00:44:11.320
today, we can maybe think about neanderthals sort of

810
00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:13.830
in the same way, although, you know, they shared

811
00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.389
a common ancestor with us further back in the

812
00:44:16.399 --> 00:44:18.699
past, right? So there's been more time for them

813
00:44:18.709 --> 00:44:21.399
to diverge. But, but if you're thinking about, I

814
00:44:21.409 --> 00:44:23.639
don't know, modeling it, you're thinking about those kinds

815
00:44:23.649 --> 00:44:25.889
of things. Um Sometimes it's useful to think about

816
00:44:25.899 --> 00:44:28.340
them more as a different population. Um But in

817
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:30.479
other cases, I think it's useful to think about

818
00:44:30.489 --> 00:44:33.399
a different species. And um I think it's a

819
00:44:33.409 --> 00:44:35.520
little bit sort of a pedantic kind of thing

820
00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:37.679
to discuss exactly what a species is and what

821
00:44:37.689 --> 00:44:40.199
the different definitions are. But I think the basic

822
00:44:40.209 --> 00:44:42.510
point is that there's different definitions of species and

823
00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.159
by some definitions, neanderthals are a different species and

824
00:44:45.169 --> 00:44:47.340
by other definitions, they're not a different species.

825
00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:50.389
Yeah. Yeah, because I, I mean, I'm not sure

826
00:44:50.399 --> 00:44:53.389
if this nomenclature is still up to date or

827
00:44:53.399 --> 00:44:55.989
if it's still the one you use in anthropology.

828
00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.389
But at least, um, when people first classified the

829
00:45:01.399 --> 00:45:04.949
Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, I mean, the full name

830
00:45:04.959 --> 00:45:10.500
was Homo Sapiens, Neanderthal lenses and Homo Sapiens Sapiens,

831
00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:13.790
right? I mean, so at least to some extent,

832
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:18.949
uh they were relating them more closely to one

833
00:45:18.959 --> 00:45:23.370
another than perhaps what we would understand as being

834
00:45:23.379 --> 00:45:25.969
two different species or not.

835
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.459
Yes. Yeah. So, I mean, what you're talking about

836
00:45:29.469 --> 00:45:32.909
is classifying them as a different subspecies, right? So

837
00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:36.760
the, the, the Sapiens Sapiens would be the subspecies.

838
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:40.179
Um, AND Sapiens Neander Hollens is, um, would be

839
00:45:40.189 --> 00:45:44.129
subspecies and, um, you know, I think that classification

840
00:45:44.139 --> 00:45:46.250
has sort of gone back and forth, you know,

841
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.360
um in the field, um as to whether or

842
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:54.179
not people use that classification. Um I think the

843
00:45:54.189 --> 00:45:56.550
important thing, right? Because a lot of this has

844
00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.729
to do with, you know, putting things in categories

845
00:45:58.739 --> 00:46:02.080
and naming those categories and taxonomy. I mean, one

846
00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:03.949
of the goals of taxonomy is right, is to

847
00:46:03.959 --> 00:46:07.469
be able to communicate with other researchers and have

848
00:46:07.479 --> 00:46:09.760
people understand, you know what you mean when you're

849
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:13.050
talking about things and, but there's definitely uh an

850
00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.449
arbitrary uh aspect of this. And I think the

851
00:46:16.459 --> 00:46:19.379
bottom line with the neanderthals is there, you know,

852
00:46:19.389 --> 00:46:22.100
we shared a common ancestor with them 600,000 years

853
00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:25.080
ago. That's actually not that long ago, right? Um,

854
00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:29.459
um, WHEN we look across mammals, um we don't

855
00:46:29.469 --> 00:46:33.139
expect reproductive isolation to develop in only 600,000 years.

856
00:46:33.149 --> 00:46:35.889
It usually takes millions of years for, for reproductive

857
00:46:35.899 --> 00:46:39.419
isolation. So they're very closely related to us. They're

858
00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:42.780
um you know, we could interbreed with them. There's,

859
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:46.250
you know, in that sense, they're, they're kind of

860
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.840
part of us, right? Part of our population. But,

861
00:46:48.919 --> 00:46:51.699
but then there's other aspects of the neanderthals that

862
00:46:51.889 --> 00:46:54.780
um they're different enough that um that we could

863
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:58.649
maybe classify them as different species. So I'll give

864
00:46:58.659 --> 00:47:00.120
you an example of that. So if you look

865
00:47:00.129 --> 00:47:03.050
at say the the features of the cranium, um

866
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.729
and we compare, you know, uh neanderthals to us

867
00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:10.270
and then we look at uh cranial differences across

868
00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.520
different species of primates, right? So the differences that

869
00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.870
we see in the cranium between us and neanderthals

870
00:47:15.879 --> 00:47:18.560
are as large or larger than what we see

871
00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:22.320
between many species of primates. And so by that

872
00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:25.810
definition, by that or that, that criterion, um there

873
00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.300
are different species from us because morphologically they're, they're

874
00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:33.100
anatomically, they're, they're um, as different from us or

875
00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:36.280
more different from us than, than many, you know,

876
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:40.419
clear species of primates. And so by that definition,

877
00:47:40.429 --> 00:47:42.040
they, they, they seem like they are a different

878
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:44.550
species, but that doesn't mean that we couldn't have

879
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.840
fertile offspring with them. Right. So, I think these

880
00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:50.360
different definitions. Um, YEAH, I think you need to,

881
00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:53.000
you need to use the definition that's useful for

882
00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:56.800
the research project that you're, that you're investigating. Um

883
00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.600
And um and I think maybe people outside of

884
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:03.820
biology uh often don't understand that there's actually lots

885
00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:07.719
of different ways, definitions of species and some groups

886
00:48:07.729 --> 00:48:10.199
are considered different species by one definition, but they're

887
00:48:10.209 --> 00:48:13.050
not considered different species by another definition. That's OK

888
00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:16.729
because um you know, we're trying to uh take

889
00:48:16.739 --> 00:48:19.439
this kind of continuous biological variation and put it

890
00:48:19.449 --> 00:48:22.090
into these different categories, but that's not really the

891
00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:25.090
way that the, the variation is actually patterned, right?

892
00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.320
Um It's humans, you know, we like to put

893
00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:29.889
things into categories, but that's, that's not really the

894
00:48:29.899 --> 00:48:32.179
biology is more messy than that, I guess, maybe

895
00:48:32.189 --> 00:48:33.850
that's, that's a good way of saying that.

896
00:48:34.399 --> 00:48:36.129
No. And I mean, I guess we have to

897
00:48:36.139 --> 00:48:40.340
always keep in mind that um me these definitions

898
00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:43.050
that we use like species and in the case

899
00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:47.229
of evolutionary biology, even things like genes, uh I

900
00:48:47.239 --> 00:48:50.729
mean, are evolving definitions and they are at the

901
00:48:50.739 --> 00:48:54.330
end of the day, just useful constructs that scientists

902
00:48:54.340 --> 00:49:00.739
have to refer to a particular phenomena, particular things

903
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:04.939
out there. But, uh, I mean, they don't correspond

904
00:49:04.949 --> 00:49:10.780
exactly to something like an essence or some essentialist

905
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:13.854
stuff out there. I mean, it's not that species

906
00:49:13.864 --> 00:49:16.675
or gene or whatever is an essence that we

907
00:49:16.685 --> 00:49:20.824
have to attribute to particular organisms, for example. And

908
00:49:20.834 --> 00:49:26.584
even if the definitions are evolving and people disagree

909
00:49:26.594 --> 00:49:30.794
uh in some ways in uh what the definition

910
00:49:30.804 --> 00:49:35.405
should be, it's still possible to make scientific progress.

911
00:49:36.114 --> 00:49:38.415
Yeah, I agree. I agree completely. That's, that's a,

912
00:49:38.425 --> 00:49:40.715
that's a good way of uh of summarizing that.

913
00:49:40.949 --> 00:49:41.810
Yeah. Yeah.

914
00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.449
So you, you've also referred to uh uh I

915
00:49:45.459 --> 00:49:49.570
mean, in passage to the differences in terms of

916
00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:54.919
the cranium between neanderthals and Homo sapiens. Uh I

917
00:49:54.929 --> 00:49:58.010
mean, uh uh uh to pick on that example,

918
00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:01.810
to explore another topic related to evolution that I

919
00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:05.520
haven't asked you about yet. Do we know if

920
00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:11.020
those differences were the result of natural selection, genetic

921
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:15.340
drift or some other mechanism? And uh I mean,

922
00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:18.780
by asking you that, I also wanted to understand,

923
00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.300
how do we study that? I mean, how do

924
00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:25.560
we distinguish if something if a particular trait is

925
00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:30.439
the result of uh selection, genetic rift? Uh IF

926
00:50:30.449 --> 00:50:32.459
it is a by product? I mean, how, how

927
00:50:32.469 --> 00:50:33.500
do we do that?

928
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:36.350
Yeah, I mean, the short answer is it's, it's

929
00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:42.350
difficult to figure that out. Um And um yeah,

930
00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.570
so we can think about natural selection, right, acting

931
00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:49.899
on the cranium and in these two evolving lineages

932
00:50:49.909 --> 00:50:52.899
and um on, on different traits and there's of

933
00:50:52.909 --> 00:50:55.320
course, different selective pressures, right? So there could be

934
00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:59.250
things like climatic adaptation, there could be um there

935
00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.949
could be uh selective pressures related to diet, there

936
00:51:01.959 --> 00:51:05.300
maybe could be selective pressures related to cognition, to

937
00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:08.189
speech, to uh all sorts of things, right? That

938
00:51:08.199 --> 00:51:11.010
could be acting um on, you know, the Neanderthal

939
00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.219
cranium on our cranium, right? So there's different ones.

940
00:51:14.229 --> 00:51:16.169
Um, AND as you say, there's also these different

941
00:51:16.179 --> 00:51:19.909
traits and the different traits are correlated with each

942
00:51:19.919 --> 00:51:23.810
other. Um So, um, so for example, um, you

943
00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:27.270
know, when your cranium grows, um, well, one, there's,

944
00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.870
there's, um, you know, we don't know all the

945
00:51:29.879 --> 00:51:33.530
details but um, we know that there uh would

946
00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.239
be uh certain genes that have an effect on

947
00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:40.590
multiple cranial traits. Um And so, um when one

948
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.570
trait changes, another trait will also tend to change

949
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.649
in a predictable way, there's also all the whole

950
00:51:45.659 --> 00:51:49.979
developmental process that produces these correlations. And so, you

951
00:51:49.989 --> 00:51:53.060
know, when there's selection, maybe acting on one trait,

952
00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:56.649
it will also have consequences for other traits. And

953
00:51:56.659 --> 00:51:59.229
so it's tricky to figure out, you know, well,

954
00:51:59.239 --> 00:52:01.820
me what trait was selection actually acting on, you

955
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:04.790
know, just because I'm measuring this trait or studying

956
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.179
this trait, that doesn't necessarily mean that's the trait

957
00:52:07.189 --> 00:52:10.030
that selecting was acting on. And then there's the

958
00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.000
whole uh issue about um distinguishing between what we

959
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:18.040
call neutral evolutionary processes and natural selection. So, neutral

960
00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:22.000
evolutionary processes are processes like um mutation and genetic

961
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:26.159
drift. Um And these are these uh chance changes

962
00:52:26.169 --> 00:52:29.489
that happen in the frequencies of different variants of

963
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.860
genes. Um And if some of those uh variants

964
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:35.840
of genes underlie, you know, the cranial morphology, then

965
00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:38.080
you know, you can have these chance changes that

966
00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:40.629
happen in the neanderthals and chance changes that happen

967
00:52:40.639 --> 00:52:43.379
in, in, in our lineage. And um because they're

968
00:52:43.389 --> 00:52:45.750
happening independently from each other, you don't expect the

969
00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.500
shame changes in both lineages. And so that can

970
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:51.739
lead to, to divergence. And um that certainly happens

971
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:53.860
a lot in the genome. Um This is actually

972
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.840
why we're able to figure out how far back

973
00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:58.389
in time we shared a common ancestor with chimpanzees

974
00:52:58.399 --> 00:53:00.360
or how far back in time we shared a

975
00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:03.310
common ancestor of NALS. It's because of this process

976
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.699
of genetic drift, these kind of chance changes. Um

977
00:53:06.709 --> 00:53:09.860
But we also think these neutral processes probably affected

978
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:12.909
the, the cranium as well. Um And so, yeah,

979
00:53:12.919 --> 00:53:15.090
trying to distinguish between that. I've actually spent a

980
00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.719
lot of time in my research, you know, trying

981
00:53:17.729 --> 00:53:20.260
to distinguish between those um things. But yeah, it's,

982
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:22.500
it, as you said, it's a, it's a, it's

983
00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:24.879
a kind of a, it's a tricky um um

984
00:53:24.889 --> 00:53:29.580
problem. Um And um maybe I'll, I'll say so

985
00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:33.010
we can use um some tools to try to

986
00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:37.469
look at this. Um So there's a body of

987
00:53:37.479 --> 00:53:42.100
theory that's called evolutionary quantitative genetics. Um And, you

988
00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:45.739
know, quantitative genetics originally comes from animal breeding. So

989
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.750
trying to um you know, try to, I don't

990
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.139
know, increase the milk production of cows or, you

991
00:53:50.149 --> 00:53:54.679
know, things like that. Um BUT um but it

992
00:53:54.689 --> 00:53:57.739
has been, this theory has been extended by evolutionary

993
00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:01.959
biologists to try to understand things about um evolution

994
00:54:01.969 --> 00:54:06.600
um and evolutionary at a broader scale. And so

995
00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.760
what this body of theory allows us to do

996
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:12.050
is make some predictions about what we would expect

997
00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:16.360
if the evolution is entirely due to neutral evolutionary

998
00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:19.860
processes. Um And then we can compare the observed

999
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:23.280
changes that we see with the expectations um under

1000
00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:26.379
neutrality. And then if we see deviations from that,

1001
00:54:26.389 --> 00:54:29.120
um this maybe indicates then that natural selection was

1002
00:54:29.129 --> 00:54:31.629
acting. Um um AND then we can try to

1003
00:54:31.675 --> 00:54:34.824
investigate um you know, which traits natural selection look

1004
00:54:34.834 --> 00:54:37.084
like is acting on. And so, um there's this

1005
00:54:37.094 --> 00:54:40.764
body of theory, this evolutionary quantitative genetics which allows

1006
00:54:40.774 --> 00:54:43.445
us to make some predictions about what we would

1007
00:54:43.455 --> 00:54:46.804
expect um if certain things were true, right? So

1008
00:54:46.814 --> 00:54:49.094
if genetic drift is acting, this is what we

1009
00:54:49.104 --> 00:54:51.415
would expect if natural selection is acting, this is

1010
00:54:51.425 --> 00:54:53.514
what we would expect. And then we can compare

1011
00:54:53.524 --> 00:54:57.114
with the observations right, be observed um And try

1012
00:54:57.125 --> 00:54:59.875
to use this to, to distinguish between those. Um

1013
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.520
And so certainly that's, that's uh well, so that's

1014
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:05.810
the way that I've approached it. And, and some

1015
00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:09.090
of my colleagues, um at some point, we may

1016
00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.229
be able to do some things where we actually

1017
00:55:11.239 --> 00:55:15.850
look at the genome um itself. Um But um

1018
00:55:16.629 --> 00:55:19.449
right now we have a really kind of poor

1019
00:55:19.459 --> 00:55:22.610
understanding of the genetic basis of most of these

1020
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:27.540
traits. Um uh YOU know, we don't, um we

1021
00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:30.429
don't really know um like what genes are involved

1022
00:55:30.439 --> 00:55:33.290
in. Uh FOR example, the cranial features um that

1023
00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.149
we look at, um probably it would have, would

1024
00:55:36.159 --> 00:55:38.409
have been many, many different genes as well. And

1025
00:55:38.419 --> 00:55:40.649
so at this point, you know, we can't just

1026
00:55:40.659 --> 00:55:42.550
look at the Neanderthal genome and compare it with

1027
00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.709
ours and, and then kind of use this to,

1028
00:55:44.719 --> 00:55:47.120
to ask those questions. Um MAYBE at some point,

1029
00:55:47.129 --> 00:55:49.129
we'll be able to do that more, but we

1030
00:55:49.139 --> 00:55:52.280
need a better understanding. So, um so for now,

1031
00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:53.969
I think the best way is to use these

1032
00:55:53.979 --> 00:55:58.689
approaches from evolutionary quantitative genetics. Um But maybe I'll

1033
00:55:58.699 --> 00:56:00.000
stop there and I'll let you ask a follow

1034
00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:00.879
up question but

1035
00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:04.399
mhm No. Yeah. Uh Let me ask you on

1036
00:56:04.409 --> 00:56:09.090
the topic of neanderthals. Uh Do we know how

1037
00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.729
and why they went extinct? And, and I mean,

1038
00:56:12.739 --> 00:56:15.860
I, I'm asking you the question like this, but

1039
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:20.439
of course, uh taking into account the discussion, we

1040
00:56:20.449 --> 00:56:25.080
just add about uh whether neanderthals and Homo sapiens

1041
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:30.350
are two different species, maybe at least in a

1042
00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.830
particular point of view, it wouldn't even make sense

1043
00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.239
to talk about them going extinct.

1044
00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:39.419
Right. Yeah, I mean, on some level, maybe they're

1045
00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:44.600
not extinct because, um, some of their genome survives

1046
00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:48.199
in people today. Um, BUT neanderthals as a group,

1047
00:56:48.209 --> 00:56:50.120
right. As a, as a group that we can

1048
00:56:50.129 --> 00:56:54.989
think about, um, were gone, I think certainly by

1049
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.879
40,000 years ago. So, um, and maybe even a

1050
00:56:58.889 --> 00:57:02.030
little older than that. Um, BUT that, I don't

1051
00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:04.840
think there's any Neanderthal fossils, um, any evidence of

1052
00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:08.239
neanderthals that are younger than 40,000 years ago. Um,

1053
00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:10.540
IF you had, we had this discussion a number

1054
00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:14.250
of years ago, um, I maybe would have said

1055
00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:17.969
that there were some younger Neals but, um, improvements

1056
00:57:17.979 --> 00:57:20.860
in our ability to date, um, the, the sites

1057
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:23.379
and date the fossils, um, figuring out how old

1058
00:57:23.389 --> 00:57:25.449
they are in geologic time, right? You know, how

1059
00:57:25.459 --> 00:57:28.000
many thousands of years ago they are, um, have

1060
00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:31.260
changed that perspective and a lot of the evidence

1061
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:34.500
potentially of younger surviving tas seems to have been

1062
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:37.590
because the dates were incorrect. Um, AND so they

1063
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:40.060
were certainly gone by 40,000 years ago and it

1064
00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:43.389
might even be like 45,000 years ago that they

1065
00:57:43.399 --> 00:57:46.030
were all gone by. So, but certainly by 40,000

1066
00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:48.399
years ago, there were no neanderthals as a group.

1067
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:52.149
Um, ALTHOUGH Neanderthal genes were incorporated, you know, into

1068
00:57:52.159 --> 00:57:55.739
people, um, at that point. So that's, um, that's,

1069
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:58.969
I guess the, when, uh, the, when part, the,

1070
00:57:58.979 --> 00:58:02.000
the why part is a is a much harder

1071
00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:06.830
question to answer. Um, AND, um, yeah, there's lots

1072
00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:12.179
of, um, explanations, um, you know, ranging from, you

1073
00:58:12.189 --> 00:58:15.580
know, competition, you know, with, with Homo Sapiens, um,

1074
00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:20.110
being out, competed with Homo Sapiens to, um, maybe

1075
00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:24.209
their population was crashing already because of climatic changes.

1076
00:58:24.219 --> 00:58:26.610
Um, AND then the Homo Sapiens kind of expanded

1077
00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:29.719
maybe into a, a population that was already, you

1078
00:58:29.729 --> 00:58:32.689
know, kind of crashing. Right. So there's, there's, I

1079
00:58:32.699 --> 00:58:35.889
guess there's a lot of different, um, possible explanations.

1080
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.620
Um One thing we do know, so, um is

1081
00:58:39.629 --> 00:58:41.879
neanderthals seem to have been living at a pretty

1082
00:58:41.889 --> 00:58:46.229
small population size. Um And their population density was

1083
00:58:46.239 --> 00:58:49.590
also pretty small. Um We can look at their

1084
00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:53.330
genomes. Um And there's something that's called effective population

1085
00:58:53.415 --> 00:58:55.814
size that you can measure from their genomes. It's

1086
00:58:55.824 --> 00:58:58.715
not the same thing as census size. But, um,

1087
00:58:58.725 --> 00:59:02.475
and um, but if it is uh related to

1088
00:59:02.485 --> 00:59:06.455
census population size, um their affected population size was

1089
00:59:06.465 --> 00:59:09.235
a lot smaller than ours. Um So that's one

1090
00:59:09.245 --> 00:59:12.195
piece of evidence we look at, for example, their

1091
00:59:12.205 --> 00:59:16.175
archaeological sites. Um, LIKE, um I don't know the

1092
00:59:16.185 --> 00:59:20.590
quantity of materials that are in there. Um Things

1093
00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:24.679
like, um um you know, there were a lot

1094
00:59:24.689 --> 00:59:27.239
of large carnivores that were around in, for example,

1095
00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:29.340
in Europe, when the anatol were living there, when

1096
00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:32.760
Homo sapiens comes in, they all go extinct, right.

1097
00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:36.000
So they're, they're gone, they're gone quickly. Um And

1098
00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:37.070
so, right. So that

1099
00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:40.939
actually sorry to interrupt, that actually also happened in

1100
00:59:40.949 --> 00:59:45.260
the Americas and Oceania. Right. When got there.

1101
00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:48.459
Yeah. And a, yeah, Australia. Right. Right. All, yeah,

1102
00:59:48.469 --> 00:59:51.949
all those places. And so, um, so all of

1103
00:59:51.959 --> 00:59:54.239
this suggests that neanderthals were living at these kind

1104
00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:58.929
of small populations. Um And so, um, that probably

1105
00:59:58.939 --> 01:00:01.800
plays a role in their extinction because you probably

1106
01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:04.379
have a bigger population of Homo sapiens that's coming

1107
01:00:04.389 --> 01:00:06.870
into a region where the Neanderthals are. And even

1108
01:00:06.879 --> 01:00:08.989
if they're mixing the fact that there are less

1109
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.810
neanderthals, you know, would mean that they're gonna contribute

1110
01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:15.870
less right to the to to later populations, right?

1111
01:00:15.879 --> 01:00:17.629
Even just if you just think about kind of

1112
01:00:17.639 --> 01:00:19.919
random mating, um if there are less of them.

1113
01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:23.120
Um And so, yeah, so demography probably played a

1114
01:00:23.129 --> 01:00:26.500
role. But um but, you know, demography is only

1115
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:28.120
a part of an answer because then there's the

1116
01:00:28.129 --> 01:00:29.929
question of like, why are they living at such

1117
01:00:29.939 --> 01:00:33.790
low population sizes? Um Was it because they were

1118
01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.399
um maybe not as good as obtaining resources from

1119
01:00:36.409 --> 01:00:38.790
the environment as Homo sapiens? Right? So there's these

1120
01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.729
kind of more ultimate explanations that maybe we need

1121
01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:44.000
to look at for demography. But demography seems like

1122
01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:46.909
played a role and it seems like most researchers

1123
01:00:46.919 --> 01:00:49.879
would agree that demography played a role. So at

1124
01:00:49.899 --> 01:00:53.610
least um not that we should um decide things

1125
01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:56.989
in science based on consensus, right? But, but uh

1126
01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.870
but I think if you polled, you know, most

1127
01:00:58.879 --> 01:01:01.030
of the specialists in, in this, in this uh

1128
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.290
this period that they would, they would say that

1129
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:05.020
demography played, played a role

1130
01:01:05.969 --> 01:01:08.870
if it had anything at all to do with

1131
01:01:08.879 --> 01:01:13.540
them being out competed by Homo sapiens. Is there

1132
01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:18.989
any evidence at all that there were any relevant

1133
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.229
cognitive differences that might have played a role there?

1134
01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:29.350
I mean, I think it's possible. Um, BUT there's,

1135
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.629
um, I think it's a little hard to, to,

1136
01:01:32.639 --> 01:01:38.879
to say um there um I mean, so I

1137
01:01:38.889 --> 01:01:41.199
guess there's, I'm just maybe think about the different

1138
01:01:41.209 --> 01:01:43.939
lines of evidence that we have for this, you

1139
01:01:43.949 --> 01:01:47.570
know, potentially we could look at um DNA, right?

1140
01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.780
Ancient DNA and try to figure out if there's

1141
01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:52.389
any evidence for cognitive differences. But, you know, we

1142
01:01:52.399 --> 01:01:55.080
have a poor understanding of the genetic basis of

1143
01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:57.340
brain function and other things. So I think it's

1144
01:01:57.350 --> 01:02:00.439
hard to, to say for sure from that. Um

1145
01:02:00.489 --> 01:02:03.750
We can look at the fossils themselves and we

1146
01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.399
do know that there are some um changes in

1147
01:02:07.409 --> 01:02:12.219
um the growth of the brain case um by

1148
01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:16.129
looking at sequences of fossils, right? So young neanderthals

1149
01:02:16.139 --> 01:02:18.719
to, to adult neanderthals and comparing them with Homo

1150
01:02:18.729 --> 01:02:21.830
sapiens. And there seems to be this change that

1151
01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.729
um uh the colleagues that, that worked on this

1152
01:02:24.739 --> 01:02:27.959
call the um the globular phase, this change that

1153
01:02:27.969 --> 01:02:30.169
happens in the first year of life that you

1154
01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:32.070
see in Homo sapiens, but you don't see a

1155
01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.370
Neanderthal in the,

1156
01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:36.429
what does that mean? Exactly sort of for the

1157
01:02:36.439 --> 01:02:37.379
audience with the,

1158
01:02:38.459 --> 01:02:42.159
it's changes in. Um So um the part of

1159
01:02:42.169 --> 01:02:45.189
the, of the brain case that's um the occipital.

1160
01:02:45.199 --> 01:02:47.320
So that's kind of the back and into the

1161
01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:50.139
lower part of the brain case. Yeah, back here.

1162
01:02:50.189 --> 01:02:52.679
Um And then also like the parietal. So out

1163
01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:57.360
here, um and what happens is there's this change

1164
01:02:57.370 --> 01:03:01.510
that makes the cranium more globular, So more uh

1165
01:03:01.659 --> 01:03:06.080
in Homo Sapiens that doesn't happen in um in

1166
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.939
Neals and the colleagues that have worked on that

1167
01:03:08.949 --> 01:03:11.820
argue that this is related to changes in the

1168
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.949
brain, right? That there's something that's happening in the

1169
01:03:13.959 --> 01:03:15.989
brain in this first year of life that happens

1170
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.709
in Homo Sapiens that's not happening in the Inal.

1171
01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.600
So that's another lot of evidence. And then there's

1172
01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:24.030
the archaeological record, right? So we can look at

1173
01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.659
um the artifacts that the N Ta were making,

1174
01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:28.500
we can look at the artifacts that Homo Sapiens

1175
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:30.979
were making. We can look at. Um I don't

1176
01:03:30.989 --> 01:03:33.100
know maybe how good of hunters they seem like

1177
01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:36.149
they were, right? Uh HOW complex their technology is.

1178
01:03:36.159 --> 01:03:38.929
We can look at those kinds of things. Um

1179
01:03:39.189 --> 01:03:41.850
We can look at um the production of um

1180
01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:45.050
things that look like art, you know, symbolic, you

1181
01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.899
know, things, those kind of things and we can

1182
01:03:46.909 --> 01:03:50.649
look at those. Um And I would say there's

1183
01:03:50.659 --> 01:03:54.669
less evidence of, of, of, you know, symbolic um

1184
01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:58.909
behavior in the nanos than what we see in

1185
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.949
um Homo Sapiens. So maybe that's related to cognition,

1186
01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.689
right. So that, you know, so, I mean, there,

1187
01:04:05.699 --> 01:04:09.040
but all of these are uh kind of indirect,

1188
01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:11.290
right? It, it's, it's hard to, I think it's

1189
01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:14.919
hard to say for sure. And um I think

1190
01:04:14.929 --> 01:04:17.719
as we have done more research on the Neals,

1191
01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:20.290
um some of the things that we thought neanderthals

1192
01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.719
were not doing, um we've now found examples that

1193
01:04:23.729 --> 01:04:26.560
they were doing them. Um, BUT even so they

1194
01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:29.270
may have been doing them less frequently than Homo

1195
01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.479
sapiens, right. So there could be, still have been

1196
01:04:31.489 --> 01:04:34.709
some differences. Um, BUT yeah, I would say it's

1197
01:04:34.719 --> 01:04:36.300
hard to say for sure. And it's, it's a

1198
01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:40.139
very contentious uh area of, of research because there's

1199
01:04:40.149 --> 01:04:43.719
people that have, um, there's sort of strong sort

1200
01:04:43.729 --> 01:04:46.610
of debates about that about, you know, uh whether

1201
01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.860
or not the Nals, um, had any cognitive differences

1202
01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:53.360
from us. Um, YEAH. And as you can imagine

1203
01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:55.520
it's, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a topic

1204
01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:58.750
that, um, that, um, that I think we have

1205
01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.100
to be careful talking about. But it's, uh, but

1206
01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:02.659
yeah, so it's hard, I think it's hard to

1207
01:05:02.669 --> 01:05:06.350
say for sure. I mean, certainly, um, they were

1208
01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.270
evolving kind of independently from us for hundreds of

1209
01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:14.120
thousands of years. And so I think it's reasonable

1210
01:05:14.129 --> 01:05:17.020
to suggest that there might have been some differences

1211
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:21.060
there but whether or not those differences were um

1212
01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:23.870
such that they would explain why the Neanderthals went

1213
01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:26.439
extinct. Um I think that's hard to say

1214
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:30.260
and, and I mean, even if it was due

1215
01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:35.860
to, for example, tech uh differences in technology differences

1216
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:41.020
in culture, for example, or sociality, social structure or

1217
01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:45.280
something like that. I mean, maybe people would look

1218
01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:49.850
at uh things like uh symbolic expression, art and

1219
01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:54.070
so on and derived from that, that then neanderthals

1220
01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:58.080
were at least a little bit less intelligent than

1221
01:05:58.090 --> 01:06:02.790
Homo sapiens. But that might just be uh cultural

1222
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.000
differences, right? I mean, it's not necessary I they

1223
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:10.330
do not necessarily have to correspond to differences in

1224
01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:15.320
terms of cognition uh at an individual level.

1225
01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.600
That's right. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. And, and we,

1226
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:20.340
you know, we talked about how they were living

1227
01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:23.959
at small population sizes and low population densities and,

1228
01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:27.290
right, so that could also interact, right? So you

1229
01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:30.020
have um at an individual level, you have similar

1230
01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:34.520
cognition. But from the um as a group, maybe

1231
01:06:34.530 --> 01:06:37.620
you have um because you're living at small population

1232
01:06:37.629 --> 01:06:40.439
sizes with small population densities, maybe neanderthals are not

1233
01:06:40.449 --> 01:06:43.389
able to develop some of the technologies that Homo

1234
01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:45.850
sapiens are living because a lot of that has

1235
01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:48.860
to do with interactions between individuals, right? The contact

1236
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:51.929
between. So, yeah, I think you're completely right. Um

1237
01:06:52.939 --> 01:06:54.790
You know, there's, there's other things too, there might

1238
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.110
have been some differences in life history with neanderthals.

1239
01:06:58.199 --> 01:07:01.389
So maybe they grew up faster than us maybe

1240
01:07:01.399 --> 01:07:03.209
they didn't live as long, right. So there could

1241
01:07:03.219 --> 01:07:05.459
have been things like that, of course, that interacts

1242
01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:08.179
uh that interacts as well because uh if you're

1243
01:07:08.189 --> 01:07:11.080
thinking about um about learning things, you're thinking about

1244
01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:14.060
transmitting information to other members of the group. If

1245
01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:16.030
you don't live as long, then maybe there's less

1246
01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.010
opportunity for that kind of transmission. So all of

1247
01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:22.340
those things, you know, interact. Um And so this

1248
01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:24.949
is, I think what makes it very complicated to

1249
01:07:24.959 --> 01:07:27.800
sort of say uh to say what's going on?

1250
01:07:29.219 --> 01:07:32.610
Yeah. So uh I have two more questions here.

1251
01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:36.780
The first one is uh what are we referring

1252
01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:41.899
to in anthropology when we use terms like anatomically

1253
01:07:41.909 --> 01:07:46.739
and behaviorally modern human? What is that? Exactly?

1254
01:07:46.879 --> 01:07:52.100
Yeah. So um so this, this term, these terms

1255
01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:55.050
originally um developed as a way to make a

1256
01:07:55.060 --> 01:08:01.699
distinction between um fossils. So you had fossils that

1257
01:08:01.709 --> 01:08:04.729
had a lot of the anatomical features that we

1258
01:08:04.739 --> 01:08:08.340
would associate with Homo sapiens, right? So that in

1259
01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:11.149
terms of their anatomical features, they look very similar

1260
01:08:11.159 --> 01:08:12.989
to us. But then when you looked at the

1261
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.410
archaeological record, they, they are types of artifacts that

1262
01:08:17.419 --> 01:08:19.680
they were producing um what you could judge from

1263
01:08:19.689 --> 01:08:21.979
their behavior in terms of the archaeological record, maybe

1264
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:24.939
they didn't look that different from the neanderthals. Um

1265
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:28.850
And so the idea that um you might get

1266
01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:32.738
um like anatomical features, like, for example, like a

1267
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:35.877
chin or a face that's tucked underneath the brain

1268
01:08:35.889 --> 01:08:38.358
case or a globular brain case or these kinds

1269
01:08:38.368 --> 01:08:41.818
of things, you would see that um in some

1270
01:08:41.828 --> 01:08:44.368
fossils. But when you looked at the archaeological record,

1271
01:08:44.377 --> 01:08:46.608
you'd sort of say, well, actually, if I found

1272
01:08:46.618 --> 01:08:49.969
this in a Neanderthal site, I wouldn't be surprised,

1273
01:08:49.979 --> 01:08:51.948
right? This kind of looks like what we see

1274
01:08:51.957 --> 01:08:54.398
in a Neanderthal site. And so the idea was

1275
01:08:54.408 --> 01:08:57.229
that maybe they're anatomically modern and what you mean

1276
01:08:57.238 --> 01:08:59.818
by anatomically modern is in terms of the, the

1277
01:08:59.828 --> 01:09:03.508
bony features, the osteology features, the skeletal features, um

1278
01:09:03.519 --> 01:09:06.794
they look like us, but um behaviorally, maybe they're

1279
01:09:06.805 --> 01:09:09.325
not modern because um from what we can see

1280
01:09:09.334 --> 01:09:11.535
in terms of their archaeological record, it doesn't really

1281
01:09:11.544 --> 01:09:14.634
look like the archaeological record that we associate with,

1282
01:09:14.645 --> 01:09:16.995
with kind of later Homo sapiens. And so I

1283
01:09:17.004 --> 01:09:20.019
think that's where those terms came is to, is

1284
01:09:20.028 --> 01:09:23.028
to make the distinction between that. Um And to

1285
01:09:23.038 --> 01:09:26.288
um I guess, leave open the possibility that um

1286
01:09:26.688 --> 01:09:30.099
that just because the fossils look kind of modern,

1287
01:09:30.108 --> 01:09:32.948
they look like us, um doesn't necessarily mean that

1288
01:09:32.957 --> 01:09:35.769
everything uh like in terms of the cognition, in

1289
01:09:35.778 --> 01:09:37.898
terms of the behavior, in terms of those other

1290
01:09:37.908 --> 01:09:39.898
things um is the same as us.

1291
01:09:41.029 --> 01:09:45.399
Yeah. And uh does that definition also include uh

1292
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:47.640
neanderthals or not?

1293
01:09:48.419 --> 01:09:51.080
Yeah. So that's a good point. So neanderthals would

1294
01:09:51.089 --> 01:09:54.250
not be considered anatomically modern, I mean, sort of

1295
01:09:54.259 --> 01:09:57.149
by definition, right? They're not um you know, I

1296
01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.689
mean, in some sense, we define anatomical modern attorney

1297
01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:05.200
with reference to them, right? So, um but um

1298
01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.354
in principle, and the anatol could be behaviorally modern

1299
01:10:08.365 --> 01:10:10.595
in the sense that, right, they could be um

1300
01:10:10.604 --> 01:10:12.865
when you look at the archaeological record in Neals,

1301
01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:15.834
you could see things that we associate um with

1302
01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:19.084
uh behaviorally modern Homo sapiens. And that also leaves

1303
01:10:19.095 --> 01:10:22.725
open the possibility. Yes, that neanderthals could be anatomically,

1304
01:10:22.734 --> 01:10:25.555
they're not modern but behaviorally they're, they, they are

1305
01:10:25.564 --> 01:10:28.169
modern. Um And so that's where those terms came

1306
01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.209
from, I think, to maybe make it so that

1307
01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:34.310
um there was some flexibility in um in the

1308
01:10:34.319 --> 01:10:38.200
allowable scenarios, I guess, maybe the um and that's

1309
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:40.240
where that, where that comes from. Now, I would

1310
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:43.520
say, um you know, a lot of people have

1311
01:10:43.529 --> 01:10:46.180
maybe moved away a little bit from using the

1312
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:49.220
word modern. Um I mean, we still use it

1313
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:53.319
but um modern has so many different meanings. Um

1314
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:57.859
And it's such a um um it's a word

1315
01:10:57.870 --> 01:11:00.080
that's, it's not a value kind of free word,

1316
01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:03.950
right? Modern kind of implies some sort of judgment.

1317
01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:06.509
Um Like if you say something like primitive versus

1318
01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.850
modern um right, you could sort of use those

1319
01:11:09.859 --> 01:11:12.399
in, in a kind of an evolutionary biology kind

1320
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:15.779
of way maybe. Um BUT in common uh uh

1321
01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:18.450
speech, right? If you called someone primitive versus you

1322
01:11:18.459 --> 01:11:21.410
call someone modern, right? One, a bad thing and

1323
01:11:21.419 --> 01:11:23.419
once a good thing, right? So, so that, you

1324
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:25.520
know, these terms are not, um, you know, they

1325
01:11:25.529 --> 01:11:28.879
have um these things associated with them. And so

1326
01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.410
I think a lot of people have kind of

1327
01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:33.910
moved away from, um, using this word modern. Um,

1328
01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.500
BUT uh that's where that distinction comes in. Yeah.

1329
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:40.740
Uh I mean, there are some of these definitions

1330
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:44.790
and even the names of species that unfortunately, when

1331
01:11:44.799 --> 01:11:48.419
we hear people commonly talking about them, I mean,

1332
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:53.890
non-academic people, unfortunately, they tend to have negative connotations,

1333
01:11:53.899 --> 01:11:58.660
even the word Neanderthal itself many times as a

1334
01:11:58.669 --> 01:12:03.049
negative connotation. And, I mean, scientifically speaking, there's no

1335
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.490
apparent reason for that.

1336
01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:10.470
That's right. That's right. Yeah. No. N Neanderthal is,

1337
01:12:10.479 --> 01:12:12.390
you know, it's, it's a, it's, it's like an,

1338
01:12:12.399 --> 01:12:14.689
it's an insult. Right. Right. If someone calls you

1339
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.819
that and, um, it, you know, it comes from

1340
01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:20.290
this idea that, um, nals are really kind of,

1341
01:12:20.299 --> 01:12:23.669
you know, brutes, they're, uh, these, uh, these sort

1342
01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:27.609
of cavemen that, um, you know, can't really figure

1343
01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:31.589
out anything. Right. They're, uh, they're almost like, kind

1344
01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:34.520
of ape like. Right. They're right. And, and, you

1345
01:12:34.529 --> 01:12:36.910
know, and there, and there was definitely early kind

1346
01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:39.870
of reconstructions of neanderthals that were like that. Um,

1347
01:12:39.879 --> 01:12:42.029
WE now know that that's not the case at

1348
01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.509
all. Right. Neanderthals are very, very similar to us.

1349
01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.060
Um, THEY'RE not really apelike in any way. I

1350
01:12:48.069 --> 01:12:49.879
mean, they're not any more apelike than we are.

1351
01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:52.310
Right. So that, you know, we all, we will

1352
01:12:52.319 --> 01:12:54.859
share this kind of, um, ape, you know, kind

1353
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:57.609
of heritage, ape ancestry but not any more apelike

1354
01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:00.430
than us. Um, THEY seem like they were very,

1355
01:13:00.439 --> 01:13:03.990
very competent, um, hunters. Um, YOU know, they were

1356
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.370
doing a lot of amazing things. Um, AND, uh,

1357
01:13:07.379 --> 01:13:09.189
so that, so that view of them is, is

1358
01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.009
definitely not, um, in scientific, uh, based in, in,

1359
01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:16.029
in, in scientific evidence. But, but yeah, so there,

1360
01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.629
there are a lot of these terms like this

1361
01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.799
and, you know, you, you run into this a

1362
01:13:19.810 --> 01:13:22.609
lot as an anthropologist because um you know, as

1363
01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:25.950
anthropologist, we study humans and we study human evolution.

1364
01:13:25.959 --> 01:13:29.990
And so because we're talking about humans, um uh

1365
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.310
you know, I think you have to be careful.

1366
01:13:32.319 --> 01:13:35.640
I think the way that you um that you

1367
01:13:35.649 --> 01:13:38.209
uh that you talk about these things because um

1368
01:13:38.379 --> 01:13:40.839
because we're not just studying any species, we're studying

1369
01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:43.000
ourselves. And, and so I think that you do

1370
01:13:43.009 --> 01:13:44.899
have to be careful, but there are, there are

1371
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:47.290
a lot of misunderstandings. I think that arise from

1372
01:13:47.299 --> 01:13:47.560
that.

1373
01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.529
I mean, some of this probably also has a

1374
01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:54.859
little bit to do with our uh historical legacy

1375
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:57.919
in terms of the way we think about, even

1376
01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:02.700
for example, people from traditional societies where up till

1377
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:07.529
very recently, we use terms like primitive or non

1378
01:14:07.549 --> 01:14:12.080
civilized. And then this applies not only to uh

1379
01:14:12.089 --> 01:14:16.589
I mean people in traditional societies, but also race

1380
01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:21.310
and others or hominid species, right? So that, that's,

1381
01:14:21.589 --> 01:14:25.000
that has something to do with that, that historical

1382
01:14:25.009 --> 01:14:25.569
legacy.

1383
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:28.560
Yes. And that's part of the history of anthropology.

1384
01:14:28.569 --> 01:14:30.790
Right. And it's, it's, it's the part of the

1385
01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:32.890
history that, you know, we're not proud of. Right?

1386
01:14:32.899 --> 01:14:35.169
Like, it's part of the, it's, uh, but, you

1387
01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:38.580
know, anthropology is sort of intertwined with this, right.

1388
01:14:38.589 --> 01:14:42.410
Um, YOU know, um, you know, scientific racism, right?

1389
01:14:42.419 --> 01:14:45.580
Ideas that, you know, uh, there's a scientific basis

1390
01:14:45.589 --> 01:14:48.140
for, for race and that, um you know, there's

1391
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:50.490
scientific basis for, I don't know, racial differences in

1392
01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.359
cognition or all these other things, right? And anthropology

1393
01:14:53.370 --> 01:14:56.299
is sort of intertwined with that and, and um

1394
01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:59.470
yeah, so I, I think you're totally right. And

1395
01:14:59.479 --> 01:15:03.009
so I think more recently as anthropologists, uh we've

1396
01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.899
tried to maybe be a little bit more careful

1397
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:09.569
about that and recognizing that. Um EVEN though maybe

1398
01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:12.180
when you're talking to other scientists, scientists understand what

1399
01:15:12.189 --> 01:15:15.089
you're talking about, but then um someone in the

1400
01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:18.069
popular uh press could maybe pick up your research

1401
01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.970
and maybe talk about it in a different way.

1402
01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.689
Um It can be used in ways that you

1403
01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:24.979
didn't intend. And so, but maybe part of the

1404
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:28.040
responsibility of us as anthropologists is also make sure

1405
01:15:28.049 --> 01:15:30.879
we try to clarify things and try to um

1406
01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:35.200
um maybe pre-empt maybe possible confusion. Um That's also

1407
01:15:35.209 --> 01:15:37.399
part of our job as well as then and,

1408
01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:39.140
and we need to maybe be better about doing

1409
01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:41.279
that. And um and so, yeah, I think that,

1410
01:15:41.290 --> 01:15:44.089
that's, that's all very important. I was just at

1411
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:47.100
a, um, at a symposium at the, um, at

1412
01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:50.529
the national meeting, um, in Los Angeles. That was,

1413
01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:54.109
uh, actually all about this, um, uh, this topic.

1414
01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:54.569
So,

1415
01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:56.910
the topic of scientific racism.

1416
01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.799
That's right. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Um, AND there was

1417
01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:02.729
actually a little write up of it in, um,

1418
01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:06.620
in Science, Science, uh, science magazine, the scientific journal

1419
01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:08.419
about the, about the symposium. So,

1420
01:16:09.439 --> 01:16:13.439
wasn't that the one organized by people like Edward

1421
01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:17.910
Hagen? Uh uh And II, I mean, at least

1422
01:16:17.919 --> 01:16:20.299
I, I heard a little bit about that and

1423
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:23.970
the, the name of Edward Hagen came up and

1424
01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:28.160
also Rebecca Seer was divulging it a lot on

1425
01:16:28.169 --> 01:16:28.890
Whitter.

1426
01:16:28.979 --> 01:16:31.419
So, that's right. So they were both participants in

1427
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:34.600
the symposium? Oh OK. OK. And the symposium was

1428
01:16:34.609 --> 01:16:38.979
organized by uh Charles Roseman and um uh Jamie

1429
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:42.140
Jones. Um They were the organizers. Um But yeah,

1430
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:44.799
both of those people that you mentioned were speakers

1431
01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:48.040
in this symposium. So, yeah, so I I'm, I'm

1432
01:16:48.049 --> 01:16:50.620
bringing this up because I think um it's a,

1433
01:16:50.629 --> 01:16:55.180
it's a, it's a very pertinent topic. Um And

1434
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:58.270
uh and so, yeah, I think, well, and some

1435
01:16:58.279 --> 01:17:00.939
of the people are listening, listening to this discussion

1436
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:02.770
might also be interested in looking at that as

1437
01:17:02.779 --> 01:17:02.910
well.

1438
01:17:02.919 --> 01:17:05.509
No, of course. And I've had Doctor Hagan on

1439
01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.919
the show and Doctor Seer and Charles Roseman, I

1440
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:11.439
will have an interview with him coming out later

1441
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:14.540
this year. So, yeah, some of those names I've

1442
01:17:14.549 --> 01:17:17.799
had on the show. So, um uh and then

1443
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:21.759
one final question, um we've, we've talked a lot

1444
01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:25.959
about uh the cranium and school morphology. You've also

1445
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:30.819
done some work on uh perhaps some changes that

1446
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:35.149
occurred uh across the agricultural transition. That is the

1447
01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:41.040
move from uh foraging hunter gathering into agriculture, into

1448
01:17:41.259 --> 01:17:46.169
uh societies based on agriculture. So, uh what do

1449
01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:49.200
we know about that? I mean, were there big

1450
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:55.120
changes in school morphology? And if so why?

1451
01:17:56.439 --> 01:18:00.919
Yeah. So um there were, so I guess the

1452
01:18:00.930 --> 01:18:04.279
short answer is that there were not big changes.

1453
01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:07.859
Um The the changes are small, um at least

1454
01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:10.879
from the research that, that, that um I guess

1455
01:18:10.890 --> 01:18:13.810
I've done and um this was done actually by

1456
01:18:13.819 --> 01:18:18.169
a um when uh a former graduate student, David

1457
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:20.129
Kes, I mean, he's, he's no longer a grad

1458
01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:22.169
student, but he was, it was his research, you

1459
01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:24.529
know, um in my lab that we were working

1460
01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:29.040
on, um the changes are small. Um BUT they're

1461
01:18:29.049 --> 01:18:33.009
detectable and um they have to do with um

1462
01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:36.649
for example, like changes in the size of the

1463
01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:39.810
attachment area for various muscles that are involved in

1464
01:18:39.819 --> 01:18:43.189
chewing or uh changes in the size of the

1465
01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:47.979
mandible, you know, the lower jaw. Um And um

1466
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:50.500
we think that this has to do with um

1467
01:18:50.649 --> 01:18:54.229
shifting to softer diets, right? So when you shift

1468
01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:58.120
with the agricultural transition to softer diets, there's consequences

1469
01:18:58.129 --> 01:19:01.819
um for the cranium and um some of these

1470
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:04.660
changes may be due to natural selection, but a

1471
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:08.189
lot of these changes uh could also be due

1472
01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:12.189
to um the fact that, you know, bone response

1473
01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.589
to the mechanical forces that are on it. And

1474
01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.660
so if you grow up and you're chewing these

1475
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:19.109
soft diets, then you're not going to have as

1476
01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.819
big attachments for the chewing muscles, the chewing muscles

1477
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:23.330
are not going to be as big. Maybe your

1478
01:19:23.339 --> 01:19:25.799
mandible isn't going to grow as large. Um And

1479
01:19:25.810 --> 01:19:28.609
these kinds of things are gonna happen um Because

1480
01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:31.189
of that. And so, uh yeah, so there definitely

1481
01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.759
were changes, you see this at a global scale,

1482
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:36.180
right? So you see this across um lots of

1483
01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:41.009
different agricultural transitions. Um But um I, I think

1484
01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:43.770
I do want to emphasize that um you know,

1485
01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:46.060
if we look at sort of the variation in

1486
01:19:46.069 --> 01:19:51.100
the cranium right across um you know, agriculturists and

1487
01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:53.930
I kind of, I guess free agriculturists. So, you

1488
01:19:53.939 --> 01:19:56.549
know, before the agri change and then also thinking

1489
01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.379
about it at kind of the global scale, right?

1490
01:19:58.390 --> 01:20:00.930
It's a variation across the planet. I mean, the

1491
01:20:00.939 --> 01:20:04.500
biggest sort of factor, right? In variation is actually

1492
01:20:04.509 --> 01:20:07.350
individual variation, right? So it's a variation that kind

1493
01:20:07.359 --> 01:20:09.979
of has nothing to do with um geography, has

1494
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:12.459
nothing to do with subsistence, right? So it's just

1495
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:15.419
like everyone's kind of an individual and everyone kind

1496
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:17.640
of has a sort of a differently shaped cranium.

1497
01:20:17.939 --> 01:20:22.339
Um The next kind of biggest factor um um

1498
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:26.180
has to do with um some like geographic relationships.

1499
01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:30.399
So, um like um people from parts of the

1500
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:32.620
world that are kind of close to each other,

1501
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:35.750
right? Tend to have more similar cranial morphology than

1502
01:20:35.759 --> 01:20:39.149
people far away. And then on top of that,

1503
01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:42.310
right, you have um some changes that have to

1504
01:20:42.319 --> 01:20:44.520
do with diet, it has changes that have to

1505
01:20:44.529 --> 01:20:47.459
do with the agricultural transition. So, right. So that's

1506
01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:50.240
why I said it's small, it's small, like relative

1507
01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:53.620
to other um you know, sources of variation, but

1508
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:56.529
it's detectable and it's detectable at a global scale.

1509
01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:59.220
So it seems to be something that's consistently happening

1510
01:20:59.229 --> 01:21:00.859
with the agricultural transition.

1511
01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:04.439
Mhm Yeah. A actually uh as I was telling

1512
01:21:04.450 --> 01:21:07.200
you before we started recording the interview, I, I

1513
01:21:07.209 --> 01:21:10.799
studied dentistry and that aspect of the kinds of

1514
01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:14.009
foods that you consume that you chew is very

1515
01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:19.479
important for mandible development and for also muscle development

1516
01:21:19.490 --> 01:21:23.490
because it's even important for uh babies at a

1517
01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:26.899
certain point. Uh FOR mothers to mothers and fathers

1518
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:31.645
to introduce um I mean, harder foods and foods

1519
01:21:31.654 --> 01:21:35.314
that are a little bit more consistent because otherwise

1520
01:21:35.504 --> 01:21:39.875
the mandible won't develop as it should and there

1521
01:21:39.884 --> 01:21:43.845
will be lots of uh dental issues associated with

1522
01:21:43.854 --> 01:21:47.274
that. But that's probably something that we saw during

1523
01:21:47.285 --> 01:21:53.185
the agricultural transitions across the globe because at least

1524
01:21:53.194 --> 01:21:57.794
at the very beginning, uh the diets were mostly

1525
01:21:57.805 --> 01:21:59.915
based on cereal, right?

1526
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:05.649
Yeah. Yeah. Um, YES. And, and just generally like

1527
01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:10.669
softer kinds of diets, right? Um And, yeah, so

1528
01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.490
I guess I answer your question, yes. This seems

1529
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:17.140
to happen with the agricultural transition. Uh WE don't

1530
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:22.120
see in earlier, um for example, like, let's say,

1531
01:22:22.129 --> 01:22:24.609
like even just take the example of neanderthals, right?

1532
01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:27.189
You don't see evidence of like dental crowding, you

1533
01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:31.660
don't see, um you don't see evidence of, um,

1534
01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:33.930
I don't know, then the third molar is the

1535
01:22:33.939 --> 01:22:36.819
wisdom teeth, you know, not erupting, impacting, right? You

1536
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:39.459
don't see those kinds of things um of the

1537
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:42.770
teeth all look generally well aligned, I mean, not

1538
01:22:42.779 --> 01:22:44.569
just the and tas but also the early homo

1539
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:47.705
sapiens. It's really after agriculture that you start to

1540
01:22:47.714 --> 01:22:50.035
see some of these problems, um these things that

1541
01:22:50.044 --> 01:22:53.424
we associate with um kind of the modern uh

1542
01:22:53.564 --> 01:22:55.674
I don't know dentistry, right? So things that, you

1543
01:22:55.685 --> 01:22:58.104
know, dentists that are are are treating, right? Tho

1544
01:22:58.115 --> 01:23:00.185
those are the things that you see um after

1545
01:23:00.194 --> 01:23:01.944
the agricultural transition. Yeah,

1546
01:23:02.479 --> 01:23:05.120
which is probably I, I mean, I'm not sure

1547
01:23:05.129 --> 01:23:08.399
if people have that specifically, but I would imagine

1548
01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:13.290
that even comparing um the mandibles and the dentition

1549
01:23:13.299 --> 01:23:19.160
of uh early almost sapiens to uh modern uh

1550
01:23:19.169 --> 01:23:22.029
I mean, by modern people, I mean, people who

1551
01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:26.669
live in uh modern industrialized societies, we would also

1552
01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:30.290
see some differences there, right?

1553
01:23:30.299 --> 01:23:34.250
Yes. Yes, I think that's right. That's right. Um

1554
01:23:35.859 --> 01:23:38.689
Yeah, so I think I mean, agriculture then definitely

1555
01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:42.649
had a, had a very important impact. Um I

1556
01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:44.330
mean, not just on our, I don't know, our

1557
01:23:44.339 --> 01:23:49.200
food production and our societies and our populations growth

1558
01:23:49.209 --> 01:23:51.669
and all these things, right? But also uh it

1559
01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:55.470
did have an effect on our physical um physical

1560
01:23:55.479 --> 01:23:59.450
aspects, right? Of us. Um INCLUDING like the mandible

1561
01:23:59.459 --> 01:24:02.250
um and our teeth and, and those kinds of

1562
01:24:02.259 --> 01:24:06.200
things. Yeah. So it, agriculture definitely was, you know,

1563
01:24:06.209 --> 01:24:09.450
I mostly work on um thinking about human evolution

1564
01:24:09.459 --> 01:24:11.640
much further back in the past because, you know,

1565
01:24:11.649 --> 01:24:15.060
agriculture only started maybe in the last 12,000 years.

1566
01:24:15.069 --> 01:24:18.129
But um but it definitely had uh a really

1567
01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:20.819
important, it was a very important um I guess

1568
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:23.890
transition, I would say um in, in humans and

1569
01:24:23.899 --> 01:24:26.109
that there was a lot of um there was

1570
01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.220
a lot of impacts across a lot of different

1571
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:31.140
um areas. So, yeah, so it's very interesting and

1572
01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:33.799
it's also important too that if we think about

1573
01:24:33.810 --> 01:24:38.290
um neanderthals and we compare neanderthals to Homo Sapiens,

1574
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:39.919
we have to think of a little bit about

1575
01:24:39.930 --> 01:24:42.490
which Homo sapiens are we comparing them with? Are

1576
01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.259
we comparing them with um kind of present day,

1577
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:47.479
you know, Homo sapiens who are all eating these

1578
01:24:47.490 --> 01:24:50.680
agricultural diets or we comparing them with, you know,

1579
01:24:50.689 --> 01:24:53.560
more ancient Homo sapiens who are eating these um

1580
01:24:53.569 --> 01:24:56.160
more hunter gatherer uh kind of diets that the

1581
01:24:56.169 --> 01:24:59.399
Neanderthals were and you won't, you'll get different results

1582
01:24:59.410 --> 01:25:02.709
depending on which comparison you make. Um And so

1583
01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.850
you have to think about that even when you're

1584
01:25:04.859 --> 01:25:07.290
studying something as uh as, as ancient as the

1585
01:25:07.299 --> 01:25:08.330
neanderthals.

1586
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:12.149
And I mean, even earlier, when we talked about

1587
01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:16.700
the evolution of the car uh in si guess

1588
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:20.049
that this would also be a source of evidence.

1589
01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:24.359
I mean, comparing humans or homo sapiens in agricultural

1590
01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:28.490
societies and even in modern industrialized societies to early

1591
01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:31.720
homo sapiens, it would be another source of evidence

1592
01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:37.859
for how diets actually influence the evolution of the

1593
01:25:37.879 --> 01:25:41.509
training and, or changes that can occur due to

1594
01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:42.149
diet.

1595
01:25:42.549 --> 01:25:46.839
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Great,

1596
01:25:46.979 --> 01:25:50.080
great. So would you like to tell people where

1597
01:25:50.089 --> 01:25:52.359
they can find you when you work on the

1598
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:52.919
internet?

1599
01:25:54.279 --> 01:25:56.359
Um Sure, I mean, you can find me uh

1600
01:25:56.370 --> 01:26:00.649
on the uh anthropology department uh website for the

1601
01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:04.859
University of California Davis. Um ALSO have uh like

1602
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:09.410
a paleoanthropology dot UC Davis uh dot edu website.

1603
01:26:09.419 --> 01:26:12.299
That's not just for me but also for other

1604
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:15.470
um faculty and graduate students who are interested in

1605
01:26:15.479 --> 01:26:17.919
these topics. Um We have a kind of a

1606
01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:20.470
AAA website for kind of the whole group um

1607
01:26:20.479 --> 01:26:21.629
as well that you can find.

1608
