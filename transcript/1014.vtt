00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.029
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:05.920
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Loops. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:09.699
joined by Doctor Walter Sheer. He is Dennis Odori

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.340
legit, professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.469
University of Notre Dame. And today we're talking about

6
00:00:16.479 --> 00:00:19.889
his book, a History of Fake Things on the

7
00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:23.069
internet. So, Doctor Shar, welcome to the show. It's

8
00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.190
a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:26.639
Great. Thank you so much for inviting me.

10
00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.559
So tell us first, uh particularly as a professor

11
00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:35.959
of Computer Science and Engineering, what motivated you to

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.119
write such a book and what is basically its

13
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.680
main premise?

14
00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:42.799
Yeah. So this is a great question is it's

15
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.400
kind of an unusual thing for a computer science

16
00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.250
professor who's typically writing code and writing, you know,

17
00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:50.770
uh scientific papers to jump in and write a

18
00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:53.150
book. Um THAT'S kind of targeted at a public

19
00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.319
facing audience and a book that's really like a

20
00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.189
history of technology. Um For many years in my

21
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.750
sort of more traditional research I had been looking

22
00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:06.489
at uh an area called media forensics within uh

23
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.190
computer science and electrical engineering. Um This, this is

24
00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:12.709
kind of a research area that is trying to

25
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.279
understand how one can detect manipulated digital images and

26
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.160
videos, how one can detect synthesized uh content, right?

27
00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:25.160
That's coming from generative A I now um and

28
00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:28.400
and other types of synthetic content. Um And what

29
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.250
what's interesting about this is like it has a

30
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.400
big social component, right? Is like who's creating that,

31
00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:35.300
that content, right? Should we be worried about it?

32
00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:39.089
There's a political uh component to it. And also

33
00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.720
I kind of felt there was an unappreciated history

34
00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:44.059
uh for this and a lot of people on

35
00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.110
the technical side of things weren't thinking very deeply

36
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.339
about the nature of this content. Uh You know,

37
00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:50.779
it's like where did the tools come from? Why

38
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.519
did people create these tools? Um What does the

39
00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:55.620
content look like on the internet? There's a lot

40
00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:58.099
of what the field had been doing was looking

41
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.989
at um kind of can data, data created for

42
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.910
experiments in the laboratory, not real examples. Uh And

43
00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:07.669
there were a lot of stories circulating which I

44
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.660
suspected were actually fake in and of themselves, right

45
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.399
between researchers about things that had supposedly happened. Um

46
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.350
So I felt especially given the the political climate.

47
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.470
Um YOU know, so this of course, is going

48
00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:25.210
back to like um uh 2020 1820 19 when

49
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.160
I started to think about um this, this project,

50
00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:30.070
right? And all of the the sort of political

51
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.059
polarization on the internet. Uh And this, this now

52
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.100
sort of pervasive paranoia about fake things. I thought,

53
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.149
you know, it's worth jumping and writing, you know,

54
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.289
a history of this. Um, BECAUSE again, I thought

55
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.949
there was a more interesting story than just that

56
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.289
political story. And if you looked at, you know,

57
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.479
the popular, uh, reporting on this and in that

58
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.309
period, up to the present, right, again, it's all

59
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.429
of this sort of like political alarmism but, but

60
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.020
I feel like the internet's a much larger place

61
00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:56.000
and there, there's more going on there. Um And

62
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.210
so that kind of set me out on my

63
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.940
journey uh to dig into this.

64
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.880
Great. So, uh and a very interesting thing that

65
00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.300
you also talk about in the book sort of

66
00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:10.179
briefly is you not only talk about the history

67
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.619
of fake is on the internet, but you also

68
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.110
take a step back and talk about the more

69
00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.600
general history of fakery. So would you like to

70
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.669
tell us a little bit about that? And why

71
00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.360
do you think it's also important to mention that

72
00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.949
for them people to understand uh sort of the

73
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.710
history of fake things on the internet itself?

74
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.179
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So with this particular topic, you

75
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.990
can't just arbitrarily say, like I will start researching

76
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.190
it at the point at which the internet becomes

77
00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:42.460
a thing. Um There's a much richer history of

78
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.860
uh storytelling in humanity. And so in the book,

79
00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:47.139
I go all the way back to antiquity, in

80
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:50.130
fact, to talk about um the role of fiction,

81
00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.179
like, why, why do people create stories? Why do

82
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.929
we tell each other these stories? How do those

83
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.860
stories evolve over time? Um What, what is the

84
00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:59.949
role of fiction in society? Like all of those

85
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.740
things are really key to humanity? And that's a

86
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.270
really important piece of the internet story, but you

87
00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:06.979
have to go way back um to, to try

88
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.770
to understand that. And so again, the book looks

89
00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:12.380
at uh early instances of fake news, Herodotus, right?

90
00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.649
Um IN, in his histories, um uh recounts these

91
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.670
fantastic stories, things that can't possibly be true. Uh

92
00:04:18.678 --> 00:04:21.500
For instance, uh he reports that there are giant

93
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.269
ants in Persia that mine gold. It's like, OK,

94
00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:27.290
but like, you know, it's, it's like an obviously

95
00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:30.339
fake story, but there's an interesting reason why people

96
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.899
in antiquity were telling these stories, um why they

97
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.019
were filtering a lot life through Homer, right? The

98
00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.369
Homeric poems, right? There, there are all these interesting

99
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.170
ways to think about uh one's immediate circumstances when

100
00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:44.279
you move beyond the immediate circumstances. This is why

101
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.890
we developed the novel. This is why, right? Like

102
00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:49.890
short stories become an important uh uh form of

103
00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:52.250
storytelling. Um You know, this is why we love

104
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.170
television shows, this is why we love the movies.

105
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.690
Um And, and again, like that, that I think

106
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.880
helps explain a lot about the the internet, right?

107
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.790
But of course, it moves to a participatory more

108
00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:05.010
mode when we get to the the internet era.

109
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.649
Um

110
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.019
So exploring this and this is also something that

111
00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:12.260
you talk about in your book also connects to

112
00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:17.609
questions surrounding how we relate to reality itself, right?

113
00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:22.859
So why does exploring such a question matter in

114
00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:24.700
this particular context?

115
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.910
Yeah. So a, a major thing I had to

116
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.529
consider in this project um was the nature of

117
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.200
reality itself. Um A lot of people when discussing

118
00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:37.079
fake things on the internet, sort of, uh matter

119
00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:40.850
of fact, they say, oh, reality, you know, is

120
00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:44.260
uh what really happens. Um And everything else then

121
00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:46.690
is fake. Um But that's not a great way

122
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.410
to explain the situation. Um BECAUSE reality is really

123
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.809
what we experience, right? And that, of course, could

124
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.450
be things that exist beyond the physical world, uh

125
00:05:56.459 --> 00:06:00.410
for instance, uh your imagination, right? Um The I,

126
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.600
you know, you, you experience it right? As part

127
00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:05.250
of your reality. Um But the the projections in

128
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.170
your mind are not, you know, what is in

129
00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:09.679
front of you in the physical world. Uh Dreams

130
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.244
are a part of that, right? Uh You know,

131
00:06:11.255 --> 00:06:14.345
all these interesting things, um fiction, right? When we're

132
00:06:14.355 --> 00:06:17.524
reading a novel, right? It's like the imagery is

133
00:06:17.535 --> 00:06:19.654
in our mind, right? Um You know, our imagination

134
00:06:19.665 --> 00:06:22.644
is facilitating that. Um EVEN when we watched, you

135
00:06:22.654 --> 00:06:26.244
know, television shows, movies, uh videos online when we

136
00:06:26.255 --> 00:06:30.375
play games online, um our brain, right? Is interfacing

137
00:06:30.385 --> 00:06:32.644
with that material, it becomes part of our reality.

138
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.679
Um, AND, and that, of course. Right. Um, uh,

139
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.820
MAKES this, I think a really interesting thing to

140
00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:41.359
study because reality is so broad. Um, AND, and

141
00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:43.140
again, you can't just sort of dismiss all these

142
00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:45.859
things as being, uh, outright fakes, not being any

143
00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:48.739
part of, uh, uh, one's experience because they are,

144
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.744
right, all these things are. Um, SO in the

145
00:06:50.755 --> 00:06:51.644
book, when I was reading it, I had to

146
00:06:51.654 --> 00:06:53.665
be very careful sort of saying like there is,

147
00:06:53.674 --> 00:06:56.024
you know, sort of this virtual space, the internet

148
00:06:56.035 --> 00:06:57.945
and then there's a virtual reality there. And there's

149
00:06:57.954 --> 00:07:01.345
also right, this physical space in the physical world

150
00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:03.704
that we exist in and there's a physical reality

151
00:07:03.714 --> 00:07:06.984
there, but they're both different instantiation of reality.

152
00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:12.170
Sure. So getting into the internet itself, do we

153
00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:16.040
know how old the history of fake things on

154
00:07:16.049 --> 00:07:19.410
the internet is? I mean, are they as old

155
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.769
as the internet itself or are they a little

156
00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:24.450
bit more recent than that?

157
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:27.739
Yeah. In fact, it, from my, my research, I

158
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.390
mean, as soon as um you know, you get

159
00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:34.649
these innovations in um uh multi user networks, multiuser

160
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.690
operating systems, um digital spaces where uh people are

161
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.309
interacting, the fake stuff appears right away. Um And

162
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.619
given what I just said, this is hardly surprising

163
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.429
because again, we love to tell stories. I think

164
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.170
what's interesting about these digital technologies is that they're

165
00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:54.579
great communications mediums, right? They, they better facilitate the

166
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:57.059
transfer of information and some of that information, of

167
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:02.070
course, it's fictional. Um AND a lot of enthusiasts

168
00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:04.100
like, um you know, in this period, you know,

169
00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.910
as we're talking about like the sixties, the seventies,

170
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.000
the eighties, like, they really want the internet, they

171
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.609
want to build the internet for that purpose specifically,

172
00:08:11.619 --> 00:08:13.540
right? It's like the creative technologies that they're really

173
00:08:13.549 --> 00:08:16.769
interested in. It's the, the social technologies that they're

174
00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:19.010
really interested in. It's like making connections to other

175
00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:22.070
people. Um And there's a really rich history there

176
00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:24.679
in terms of the thinking, right, the philosophy behind

177
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.500
this, um a lot of engineers are really cited

178
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.429
about the media theories of Marshall mcluhan. Uh So

179
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.380
mcluhan is a really important uh mass communications scholar

180
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.049
at the University of Toronto in the fifties, sixties

181
00:08:39.058 --> 00:08:41.869
and seventies. Um And what's interesting, he's, he's kind

182
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.390
of remembered as being like a key piece of

183
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.690
like that counterculture era of like the sixties and

184
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.119
seventies. Um But he's kind of like a straight

185
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.890
laced, like professor but, but he, he really, I,

186
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.330
I think does a phenomenal job of like anticipating

187
00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.700
uh the near future, like what is on the

188
00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.940
horizon when it comes to information networks. Um And,

189
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.919
and he's really, really excited about this potential of

190
00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:09.500
uniting the globe on these information networks. Um And

191
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.570
he makes this observation that, you know, in the

192
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.989
future, you'll be able to project your imagination to

193
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.770
other people, right? You'll be tapping your central nervous

194
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.659
system and moving that information to other people in

195
00:09:20.669 --> 00:09:24.099
real time um and experiencing what they're experiencing even

196
00:09:24.109 --> 00:09:27.099
though you have no physical contact with them. Um

197
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.679
You know, this, this is an idea. I think

198
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.049
that really again, motivates a lot of people who

199
00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:33.539
are, you know, participating in that counterculture, but also

200
00:09:33.549 --> 00:09:36.030
they have some sort of technical ability uh to

201
00:09:36.039 --> 00:09:37.479
go off and build it, right. We have this

202
00:09:37.489 --> 00:09:41.140
like really like dry narrative of how the internet

203
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.710
started. You know, what's the history of the internet?

204
00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:44.909
Everybody's like, oh, it was, you know, the Department

205
00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:47.590
of Defense in the United States creating this infrastructure,

206
00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:51.179
this distributed infrastructure to withstand um you know, some

207
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.900
sort of Soviet nuclear first strike. Um And that

208
00:09:54.909 --> 00:09:57.849
of course happened, but that wasn't, I think what

209
00:09:57.859 --> 00:10:00.640
was motivating the engineers behind the scenes, you know,

210
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.479
that's sort of like the modus operandi, you know,

211
00:10:02.489 --> 00:10:04.859
it's like, OK, like we need, we need the

212
00:10:04.869 --> 00:10:07.299
funding, you know, we need, you know, some sort

213
00:10:07.309 --> 00:10:10.489
of like mechanism to move this forward. Um But

214
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.609
deep down, right? You know, we, we wanna do

215
00:10:13.619 --> 00:10:16.312
this other thing. Um And they know, of course,

216
00:10:16.322 --> 00:10:18.672
right, you know, once the infrastructure is built, you're

217
00:10:18.682 --> 00:10:21.322
gonna get ordinary people moving into it. It's not

218
00:10:21.333 --> 00:10:23.953
just gonna be the defense uh community, the intelligence

219
00:10:23.963 --> 00:10:26.312
community that's operating in this space. But what I

220
00:10:26.322 --> 00:10:28.062
think is fascinating when you look at the early

221
00:10:28.072 --> 00:10:31.882
instances of fake content because the internet is so

222
00:10:31.893 --> 00:10:35.172
heavily populated by these uh communities, right? These like

223
00:10:35.182 --> 00:10:39.056
government, you still see the, the storytelling because that

224
00:10:39.065 --> 00:10:41.515
had been ingrained in military culture, you get like

225
00:10:41.526 --> 00:10:44.476
people writing stories about UFO S strange lights in

226
00:10:44.486 --> 00:10:46.205
the sky, all this stuff that was sort of

227
00:10:46.216 --> 00:10:48.986
embedded into the aerospace and uh industry because that

228
00:10:48.995 --> 00:10:51.356
was already part of that culture, right? Um So

229
00:10:51.366 --> 00:10:53.286
this is kind of like a universal phenomenon and

230
00:10:53.296 --> 00:10:56.356
that's exactly how mcluhan sort of uh describes it

231
00:10:56.366 --> 00:10:58.716
uh back in the sixties, which is pretty interesting.

232
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:04.409
And does the internet introduce a new ways of

233
00:11:04.419 --> 00:11:08.309
people faking things? I mean, ways that didn't exist

234
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:08.830
before?

235
00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:14.530
Yeah, so, absolutely. Um E especially as you get

236
00:11:14.539 --> 00:11:18.359
into like the eighties, the nineties, the two thousands,

237
00:11:18.369 --> 00:11:21.520
you start to see new uh creative technologies uh

238
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.869
become available to the ordinary person. Um I think

239
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.780
it's fascinating, the book I look at the early

240
00:11:27.789 --> 00:11:30.890
history of Photoshop. So that is again, like a

241
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.820
piece of software we're all familiar with, right? Um

242
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.780
It has stood the test of time. Uh It

243
00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:38.729
was created in the 19 eighties which is just

244
00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:40.510
uh you know, crazy to think about today, right?

245
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.390
Because if you think it is like a very

246
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.840
modern piece of software with all these great features,

247
00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:46.000
of course, Adobe has been adding to that feature

248
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.419
set over the decades. Um But it was pretty

249
00:11:48.429 --> 00:11:51.820
sophisticated right off the bat. Um And it was

250
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.679
created by two brothers who were really interested in

251
00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.719
photography. They had um this vision again of um

252
00:11:58.729 --> 00:12:01.489
digital spaces where ordinary people were gonna be able

253
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.700
to play around with uh photo photography uh in

254
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.159
a way that only dark room technicians, professional photographers

255
00:12:08.169 --> 00:12:09.890
had been able to do up until that point.

256
00:12:10.289 --> 00:12:12.640
Um So this is again another sort of forward

257
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:17.039
looking technology. Um I when you have the.com boom

258
00:12:17.049 --> 00:12:19.799
of the nineties, um a lot of people who

259
00:12:19.809 --> 00:12:22.159
had no experience with computers kind of get drawn

260
00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:24.909
into these new social technologies, you know, they're, they're

261
00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:26.750
signing on to the internet for the first time.

262
00:12:26.989 --> 00:12:29.559
Um A lot of technologies um that we sort

263
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.090
of take for granted now, like email were kind

264
00:12:31.099 --> 00:12:33.679
of novel back then. Uh And they become again

265
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.909
this mechanism for storytelling um before their social media.

266
00:12:36.919 --> 00:12:38.130
And then finally, when you get to the, the

267
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.369
early two thousands, right? You have um uh what

268
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.229
something that, that sort of looks like, you know,

269
00:12:43.239 --> 00:12:45.549
mcluhan's global village and that the whole world is

270
00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:49.130
connected on these platforms and everybody is telling stories,

271
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.109
right? Um You see this like massive uh influx

272
00:12:52.119 --> 00:12:54.760
again of, of media that is uh created from

273
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.599
the bottom up, right? Um It's coming from these

274
00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:59.140
amateur communities, but it's making use of these new

275
00:12:59.369 --> 00:13:01.929
tools, right? Um That are being put out. Uh

276
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.440
So people again can sort of project their imaginations

277
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.049
into the space and that, you know, continues to

278
00:13:07.059 --> 00:13:09.640
the present day when we have uh these generative

279
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.159
A I systems, right? Which are kind of like

280
00:13:11.169 --> 00:13:13.450
the, the next generation of the same idea.

281
00:13:14.609 --> 00:13:18.070
And do we have any idea at all? How

282
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.030
much of the internet is fake?

283
00:13:22.239 --> 00:13:25.830
That that's a really good question. I don't think

284
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.739
anybody has a perfect handle on that. I know

285
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.690
some folks have attempted to figure this out. Uh

286
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.260
For instance, I know uh New York magazine a

287
00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.580
few years ago, uh put out a piece where

288
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.340
they tried to quantify this and I, I feel

289
00:13:39.349 --> 00:13:41.659
like, you know, even their quantification of this is

290
00:13:41.669 --> 00:13:44.530
kind of loosey goosey. Um They did make some

291
00:13:44.539 --> 00:13:47.809
good insights though. Um They, they noted that um

292
00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:51.320
it is highly likely that the majority of traffic

293
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.500
on social media platforms is bot driven. Um And

294
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:55.799
again, I, I think if you, you're just sort

295
00:13:55.809 --> 00:13:57.460
of like a user of social media, you sort

296
00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:59.940
of know this. Uh YOU know, number one, there's

297
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.520
a lot of concern about like algorithmic feeds and

298
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.570
algorithmic content. Um But there are even dumb bots

299
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.320
that have been around now for decades. Um So

300
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.080
these are like, you know, automated pieces of code

301
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.840
that, you know, have an ability to generate content.

302
00:14:14.099 --> 00:14:17.210
Uh Mainly an ability to comment right now. This

303
00:14:17.219 --> 00:14:20.059
is like an early problem when social media appeared.

304
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.039
And even before social media, when you had, you

305
00:14:22.049 --> 00:14:24.590
know, like forums and like comment sections on news

306
00:14:24.599 --> 00:14:28.280
sites um you'd get these kind of like spammy

307
00:14:28.289 --> 00:14:30.369
uh troll posts, right? Um Some of it was

308
00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.200
just advertising, in fact, a great deal of it

309
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.750
was advertising. Um SOME of it though, like was

310
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.299
appearing in a political context, right? You'd have bots

311
00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:41.364
that were, you know, uh designed to uh send

312
00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:44.434
messages of a politic uh certain political orientation and

313
00:14:44.445 --> 00:14:48.275
automatically respond to certain keywords uh that were identified

314
00:14:48.284 --> 00:14:50.645
on these feeds. Um And that just generates a

315
00:14:50.655 --> 00:14:52.994
lot of noise on social media. This is like

316
00:14:53.005 --> 00:14:54.515
something I think like everybody sort of agrees is

317
00:14:54.525 --> 00:14:57.164
bad, it's not good. Um Even if you agree

318
00:14:57.174 --> 00:14:58.804
with the message of the bot, you know, you

319
00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.594
sort of know that it's, it's just a spay

320
00:15:00.784 --> 00:15:04.635
automated message. Um um And that, you know, I,

321
00:15:04.645 --> 00:15:06.934
I think is like more or less like uninteresting,

322
00:15:06.945 --> 00:15:10.059
right? Um uh When we think about fake messages.

323
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.340
But I, I think again, there's, there's entire other

324
00:15:12.349 --> 00:15:14.369
genres of fake content on there that are just

325
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.140
massive, right? Like, think like fandoms on the internet.

326
00:15:17.369 --> 00:15:18.809
Um You know, again, this is like a mode

327
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.539
of storytelling, it's fictional. Um But you have these

328
00:15:21.549 --> 00:15:24.859
massive communities, you know, of fans of different media

329
00:15:24.869 --> 00:15:27.409
franchises, you know, like, think like Star Wars uh

330
00:15:27.419 --> 00:15:31.169
different anime series, um all these different things, right?

331
00:15:31.179 --> 00:15:33.460
Uh WHERE people are just writing their own stories

332
00:15:33.469 --> 00:15:36.719
and, and sending them around uh meme culture is,

333
00:15:36.729 --> 00:15:39.169
is just so important to the internet, these days,

334
00:15:39.179 --> 00:15:40.739
right? And it keeps evolving, which I think is

335
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.280
fascinating. Um If you look at meme culture now,

336
00:15:43.289 --> 00:15:45.489
it's, it's very much like video driven on Instagram

337
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.489
and tiktok. Um And, and people again are like

338
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.250
riffing on these ideas, remixing content. Um A lot

339
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.539
of that is fake, right? You know, a lot

340
00:15:53.549 --> 00:15:55.719
of that again is like taking a specific fictional

341
00:15:55.729 --> 00:15:59.359
trope and reworking it over time. Um And, and

342
00:15:59.369 --> 00:16:01.200
again, that's the content that people love, that's the

343
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.820
content that people are experiencing it. Um You can

344
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.369
think about too, like um augmented reality, virtual reality,

345
00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.460
right? These are, these are things, again, they're not

346
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.969
like the physical world, right? You know, they're, they're

347
00:16:11.979 --> 00:16:14.539
sort of these artificial creations. Um But they're very

348
00:16:14.549 --> 00:16:16.429
popular. Um And you could throw in like, you

349
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.429
know, gaming communities into that too, right? And this

350
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.549
blows up just so massively. Um And again, I'd

351
00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:23.419
say, like most of these things, like, are pretty

352
00:16:23.429 --> 00:16:25.359
positive, not the bots, but, you know, like a

353
00:16:25.369 --> 00:16:27.570
lot of these other things that are participatory people

354
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.150
really enjoy. Um I, I think once you move

355
00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:34.219
out of the realm of uh partisan politics, um

356
00:16:34.229 --> 00:16:35.799
A lot of the fake stuff is, is quite

357
00:16:35.809 --> 00:16:38.130
interesting. Um Because again, it's, it's, it's like creative

358
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.270
fiction uh versus like destructive political content.

359
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.369
So earlier, you've talked a little bit about photo

360
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.400
editing and I would like to ask you and

361
00:16:47.409 --> 00:16:50.559
perhaps we can expand this also to other kinds

362
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.099
of uh fakes or ways that people fake things

363
00:16:54.109 --> 00:16:58.539
on the internet. Do we know what goals people

364
00:16:58.549 --> 00:17:01.690
have when they alter a photo, when they edit

365
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.368
a photo and they put a fakery up on

366
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.098
the internet?

367
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.469
Yeah. OK. So this is a really interesting question

368
00:17:09.479 --> 00:17:11.959
one I looked at in depth in the book.

369
00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:14.000
Um BECAUSE again, as I mentioned earlier, this, this

370
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.180
whole project started with my experience with um uh

371
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:20.180
media forensics, right? So there was an assumption in

372
00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:22.550
that community that like people who do this are

373
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.000
doing something bad, right? They're trying to revise history

374
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.560
and they're trying to create some kind of like

375
00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:30.959
perfect fake, right? That will allow them to revise

376
00:17:30.969 --> 00:17:35.880
the historical record. Um It turns out historically that

377
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.760
doesn't really work, right? We do, we don't really

378
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.859
have many uh instances where like a perfect fake

379
00:17:42.869 --> 00:17:46.329
has really resonated um in, in many cases, again,

380
00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:48.380
even when that, that sort of happened, it was

381
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.619
debunked very quickly. Um And part of the reason

382
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.930
there, which I think is fascinating, like there's a

383
00:17:53.939 --> 00:17:55.939
long history of this kind of photographic manipulation. And

384
00:17:55.949 --> 00:17:57.329
again, we we we sort of tie it to

385
00:17:57.339 --> 00:18:00.750
like authoritarian and totalitarian governments in the 20th century

386
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.969
in the, in the the era of film photography.

387
00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.219
Um And, and there was this like pervasive idea

388
00:18:06.229 --> 00:18:08.609
in the like sort of national security community here

389
00:18:08.619 --> 00:18:10.770
in the United States that this was happening in

390
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.449
these other places, right. So we're thinking like the

391
00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:16.560
Soviet Union, uh Maoist China, the Third Reich um

392
00:18:16.569 --> 00:18:19.540
Fascist Italy, right? Um They, they, they, they produced

393
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.469
a lot of edited photographic content. Uh And of

394
00:18:22.479 --> 00:18:24.439
course, in many cases, right, when they were doing

395
00:18:24.449 --> 00:18:27.170
that, there was a malicious intent. Uh But what's

396
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.910
sort of interesting when you go back to those

397
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.189
old photographs, um they're not really perfect fakes, in

398
00:18:32.199 --> 00:18:34.719
fact, some of them are pretty bad. Um And

399
00:18:34.729 --> 00:18:36.219
that's kind of puzzling because if you look at

400
00:18:36.229 --> 00:18:38.640
the history of photographic manipulation in the era of

401
00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:42.930
film photography, it was quite possible to produce very

402
00:18:42.939 --> 00:18:46.569
realistic fakes. Uh FOR instance, right, you could remove

403
00:18:46.579 --> 00:18:48.849
somebody from a photograph and you could replace them

404
00:18:48.859 --> 00:18:51.569
with somebody else and make it look pretty good.

405
00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.849
Um But what I found looking at these old

406
00:18:53.859 --> 00:18:57.449
cases, like they were like, obviously edited, right? Like

407
00:18:57.459 --> 00:19:01.089
huge gaps in, in photographs of, you know, political

408
00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:03.550
leaders, um you know, gaps that could have been

409
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:08.800
filled in. Um One particularly striking example I found

410
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:13.849
um from Albania, um sensors had removed um some,

411
00:19:13.859 --> 00:19:16.109
some sort of men in a, a group photograph,

412
00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:19.180
but they left the shoes, right? So it's like,

413
00:19:19.189 --> 00:19:21.349
that's like terrifying when you're looking at this photograph

414
00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:23.630
where it's like these people were removed, right? You

415
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.030
know, they're missing these, the shoes are still there.

416
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.994
Um In many cases. Um II I think a

417
00:19:29.005 --> 00:19:31.515
more correct interpretation of the style of editing is

418
00:19:31.525 --> 00:19:35.135
that um it's meant to send an intentional signal

419
00:19:35.145 --> 00:19:38.375
to the observer. Like we can erase people, if

420
00:19:38.385 --> 00:19:40.844
you mess up, we can erase you too, right?

421
00:19:41.084 --> 00:19:43.574
Um What's also fascinating too is like the originals

422
00:19:43.584 --> 00:19:45.944
uh tend to like persist, right? It's, it's like,

423
00:19:45.954 --> 00:19:48.949
again, like the sensors remove uh you know, somebody

424
00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:50.469
from a photo like they, they, they have this

425
00:19:50.479 --> 00:19:54.030
revised image, but history continues to record the original.

426
00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.250
It's like we always have these like side by

427
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.599
side comparisons, which is kind of interesting. Um And

428
00:19:58.609 --> 00:20:01.969
when you sort of think about that, you know,

429
00:20:01.979 --> 00:20:04.479
it's like, OK, maybe it's like those like obvious

430
00:20:04.489 --> 00:20:07.459
fakes, right? That are the most dangerous because the

431
00:20:07.469 --> 00:20:09.959
message is very clear, right? Those perfect fakes really

432
00:20:09.969 --> 00:20:13.310
haven't worked. Um And so again, I think that

433
00:20:13.319 --> 00:20:15.500
whole sort of assumption that again, there are bad

434
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.260
people out there trying to revise history. This is

435
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.020
not, that's not really the way this works, right?

436
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.619
And that's not really how it it becomes effective.

437
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.660
Um I, I think again, more explicit messaging uh

438
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.560
tends to resonate um better. And it's funny too

439
00:20:28.569 --> 00:20:30.040
when you look again at the history of this,

440
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.219
like uh again, looking back at say like the

441
00:20:32.229 --> 00:20:34.359
Soviet Union, there's like an entire genre of like

442
00:20:34.369 --> 00:20:37.099
Soviet era humor about how the government lies to

443
00:20:37.109 --> 00:20:39.010
you, right? It's like people did not believe the

444
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.199
official media record, right? Because it was always altered.

445
00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.319
Um That, that was not surprising to, to people

446
00:20:44.329 --> 00:20:46.489
who lived in the Soviet Union. Um, BUT again,

447
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.130
here in the, the west, again, there was this,

448
00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.969
like, pervasive fear that, like, there was totalitarian control

449
00:20:50.979 --> 00:20:53.430
over the media. Uh, BUT it didn't quite work

450
00:20:53.439 --> 00:20:56.609
like that in practice. Um, WHICH is interesting. Um,

451
00:20:56.619 --> 00:20:58.329
AND then if you go back further in history,

452
00:20:58.339 --> 00:21:01.369
like looking at the history of film, photography itself,

453
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.050
um, photos are being edited right away. Right. I,

454
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.160
there's this myth and that sort of propagated over

455
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.410
to um the the area of media, forensics that

456
00:21:10.619 --> 00:21:13.520
um photographs could be trusted in the past, right?

457
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.719
We could trust them uh because we didn't have

458
00:21:15.729 --> 00:21:18.880
Photoshop, right? It wasn't, it wasn't possible, right? Many

459
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.949
people sort of believe to edit photographs that was

460
00:21:20.959 --> 00:21:22.760
not true at all. Basically, as soon as the

461
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.829
camera is invented in the 19th century, photographers are

462
00:21:25.839 --> 00:21:29.550
faking their photographs. Um The first fake photograph appears

463
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.449
in 1840 is produced by one of the inventors

464
00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:35.369
of an early camera process and it just kind

465
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.439
of spirals from there. Um But it's mostly used

466
00:21:38.449 --> 00:21:40.729
um in a, in a sort of like commercial

467
00:21:40.739 --> 00:21:43.489
or creative way. Uh FOR instance, right, when you'd

468
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.250
sit for a portrait uh in a, in a

469
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.780
studio in like the 19th century, um you could

470
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.589
often like order some special effects, like some of

471
00:21:51.599 --> 00:21:53.329
these effects again, would just make the photo look

472
00:21:53.339 --> 00:21:55.410
better. Like what we do now with like photo

473
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.609
editing apps on our phones. Uh LOW pass filter,

474
00:21:58.619 --> 00:22:00.619
right? You know, it's like we can like apply,

475
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.170
right, some smoothing on the face like through our

476
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.729
app. Uh And our complexion looks better. You could

477
00:22:05.739 --> 00:22:09.739
do that uh using um some basic techniques uh

478
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.619
in the dark room, right? That was well known

479
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.540
by photographers. Um You could add objects into scenes,

480
00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.775
you could remove objects. Um YOU could uh add

481
00:22:17.785 --> 00:22:19.685
all sorts of interesting special effects, right? Which I

482
00:22:19.694 --> 00:22:21.694
think it's sort of been forgotten by a lot

483
00:22:21.704 --> 00:22:24.895
of people, uh even photographers. Um But, but again,

484
00:22:24.905 --> 00:22:27.694
this was like all very much standard uh in

485
00:22:27.704 --> 00:22:29.854
the era of film photography. So, right, like this

486
00:22:29.864 --> 00:22:32.655
idea that um the photograph was like a trusted

487
00:22:32.665 --> 00:22:35.255
object, I I feel was a, was a myth.

488
00:22:35.265 --> 00:22:37.584
Uh That's a myth that persists to this day,

489
00:22:37.594 --> 00:22:39.925
which is interesting uh from a community again, that,

490
00:22:39.935 --> 00:22:43.875
that seems uh uh very keen on policing, right?

491
00:22:43.885 --> 00:22:44.895
Uh FALSEHOODS.

492
00:22:45.949 --> 00:22:50.250
But because people particularly nowadays are very worried about

493
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.119
misinformation and on the internet specifically, I have to

494
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.060
ask you this question. So you've already sort of

495
00:22:57.069 --> 00:22:59.959
alluded to the answer, I guess in my previous

496
00:22:59.969 --> 00:23:05.060
question. But are there many people who actually fall

497
00:23:05.069 --> 00:23:08.380
for fake reason on the internet? I mean, whether

498
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.209
it's photos, videos or other kinds of content or

499
00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.660
are people usually, or it's usually easy for people

500
00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.380
to figure out or find out that they're fakes?

501
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.489
Yeah. So this, this is the question everybody seems

502
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.489
to want an answer to. And again, this is

503
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.829
like, it's difficult because like, we just don't know

504
00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:29.900
and, and I'll explain why this is really difficult

505
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.239
even if you were gonna like, interview people, like,

506
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.069
why this is really difficult to answer. Um So

507
00:23:35.079 --> 00:23:37.969
I think yes people of course do fall for

508
00:23:37.979 --> 00:23:40.569
uh the, these things I think where you see

509
00:23:40.579 --> 00:23:44.969
most people being legitimately duped, um, cases like that

510
00:23:44.979 --> 00:23:48.630
are just, just, um, scams, like like criminal scams.

511
00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:50.890
Uh Right? For instance, right? It's like someone who's

512
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.729
trying to like get money from you, right? So

513
00:23:52.739 --> 00:23:55.010
they're creating a bunch of fake media to perhaps

514
00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.829
like impersonate your relative. Um There's a lot of

515
00:23:57.839 --> 00:24:02.569
concern about um voice synthesis techniques are targeting the

516
00:24:02.579 --> 00:24:06.010
elderly, right? All sorts of like phone scams. Um

517
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.010
YOU know, somebody Impersonating a relative trying to extract

518
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.329
money out of somebody who probably like, isn't cognitively

519
00:24:12.339 --> 00:24:15.290
all there because they're very old. Um Like, I,

520
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.280
I feel like those scams are becoming more prevalent

521
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.150
and they're working, which is very troubling what I

522
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.640
think does not work um As much as people

523
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.609
think it works like the political disinformation. Um Now

524
00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:30.670
again, this may seem surprising because a lot of

525
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.829
people are like, well, you know, it's like my

526
00:24:32.839 --> 00:24:35.969
crazy uncle like believes, right? All of this stuff,

527
00:24:35.979 --> 00:24:38.430
right? Which is obviously fake. What I think is

528
00:24:38.439 --> 00:24:40.900
going on in the realm of politics um is

529
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:45.040
something akin to uh professional wrestling. Do, do you

530
00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.109
know, like the fake, the fake wrestling, right? But

531
00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:50.150
yeah, so this is, this is a really interesting

532
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.609
effect where, you know, like professional wrestling is entertainment,

533
00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:55.979
right? The the matches are, are staged, right? There

534
00:24:55.989 --> 00:24:58.589
are writers who create the characters. What I think

535
00:24:58.599 --> 00:25:00.540
is really interesting. This is like a fandom where

536
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.859
like people strongly identify with the characters and when,

537
00:25:04.869 --> 00:25:07.329
when fans are talking about these wrestling matches, they're

538
00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:10.310
talking about them as if they were real. Um

539
00:25:10.319 --> 00:25:13.020
BUT detail, they don't, they, they know it's fake,

540
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.469
right? They know it's entertainment. Um And, and you

541
00:25:15.479 --> 00:25:17.099
see these circumstances, you know, it's like everybody knows

542
00:25:17.109 --> 00:25:19.329
it's fake and like people very pedantic people will

543
00:25:19.339 --> 00:25:21.530
like, you know, confront professional wrestling fans and be

544
00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.689
like, you know, that's fake, right? That's fake wrestling

545
00:25:23.819 --> 00:25:25.219
and, and eventually the fans will be like, yeah,

546
00:25:25.229 --> 00:25:26.849
we know, you know, but that's not the point,

547
00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:29.439
right? It's like we identify with the fandom. I,

548
00:25:29.449 --> 00:25:31.560
I think you say the same thing in partisan

549
00:25:31.569 --> 00:25:34.800
politics where people identify so strongly with a political

550
00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.910
party that they talk about these things as if

551
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.189
they were real, right? Like the sort of political

552
00:25:40.199 --> 00:25:42.530
mythology and you see this, like regardless of political

553
00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.890
orientation. Um And so even though they know that

554
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.670
this, they're talking about things that didn't actually happen

555
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.579
in the physical world, they still strongly identify with

556
00:25:51.589 --> 00:25:54.420
the stories. Uh And so they're probably not going

557
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:58.170
to concede that they're fake, right? Um AND that,

558
00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.550
that's a complicated thing to unpack but it's like

559
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.540
a well known phenomenon, uh, in the realms of,

560
00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:07.170
like, anthropology, sociology, et cetera. Um, AND in fact,

561
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.000
anthropologists say, like, it's sort of like when people

562
00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.390
are, like, like, like lying to you in that

563
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.339
manner, it's really interesting. Right. Um, BECAUSE it's saying

564
00:26:14.349 --> 00:26:17.430
something about the, the culture they're embedded in. Um,

565
00:26:17.439 --> 00:26:18.689
AND so you see a lot of that on

566
00:26:18.699 --> 00:26:20.500
the internet, right? It's not just politics, it's other

567
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.310
things too. Like I see like any fandom, right?

568
00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:24.750
Like you, you have people talking about, uh these

569
00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.260
things, right? There's people on the internet, they're like,

570
00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.900
you know, it's like I'm a Jedi Knight, right?

571
00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:31.949
I identify right with this, this fictional, like religion

572
00:26:31.959 --> 00:26:35.349
from like George Lucas's Mind. Um, IT'S, it's the

573
00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:37.180
same type of effect, um which I think is

574
00:26:37.189 --> 00:26:39.839
really fascinating. And so again, if you want to

575
00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:41.410
quantify this, I, you know, I don't have no

576
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.020
idea because again, a lot of people that will

577
00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.119
be telling you stories as you're trying to gauge

578
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:50.089
this, um, you may be, um unjustly saying they've

579
00:26:50.099 --> 00:26:52.439
been duped in some horrible way, right? When, in

580
00:26:52.449 --> 00:26:54.930
fact, they have not been duped, right? Um They

581
00:26:54.939 --> 00:26:57.109
sort of know what's going on. Um, THEY'RE just

582
00:26:57.119 --> 00:26:59.479
thinking in a different mode when they're responding to

583
00:26:59.489 --> 00:27:00.270
the question.

584
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.189
Uh But when it comes to the politics itself,

585
00:27:05.199 --> 00:27:08.250
uh just to make this point clear, are you

586
00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:12.189
saying there that it might be the case that

587
00:27:12.199 --> 00:27:17.420
at least in some specific circumstances or situations, people

588
00:27:17.459 --> 00:27:22.069
might say that they believe fake things that the

589
00:27:22.079 --> 00:27:27.260
for example, they preferred party claims or preferred politician

590
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:31.729
claims just to signal just to signal their group

591
00:27:31.739 --> 00:27:35.979
membership. But then deep down they actually do not

592
00:27:35.989 --> 00:27:36.619
believe them.

593
00:27:37.329 --> 00:27:39.069
Yeah, that's, that's a good and concise way to

594
00:27:39.079 --> 00:27:41.709
describe this, right? So it's in group signaling, um

595
00:27:41.719 --> 00:27:43.609
which is interesting that that's not to say that

596
00:27:43.619 --> 00:27:47.040
like nobody is duped. Uh In fact, like I

597
00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:50.079
worry about the people that actually are duped, right?

598
00:27:50.089 --> 00:27:53.479
Especially if the political rhetoric is violent in some

599
00:27:53.489 --> 00:27:55.920
way. Um That's a big problem. Like I look

600
00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:57.339
at the ethics of that at the end of

601
00:27:57.349 --> 00:27:59.400
my book. Um BECAUSE again, I feel like this

602
00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.760
is an issue and on the internet, uh uh

603
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:05.680
people are tend to be uh reluctant to correct,

604
00:28:05.739 --> 00:28:08.199
right? These misunderstandings because you get a lot of

605
00:28:08.209 --> 00:28:11.000
trolling behavior as well. Um Which is a huge

606
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.209
problem. Um In fact, I think a lot of

607
00:28:13.219 --> 00:28:15.040
the trolling too, sort of stems out of this

608
00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:18.160
effect, right? Because if you have a group, an

609
00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.319
out group that sort of believes that you believe

610
00:28:21.329 --> 00:28:23.619
these things, you may troll them quite heavily by

611
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.359
saying even more ridiculous things uh and claiming to

612
00:28:26.369 --> 00:28:28.479
believe them uh right, that, that sort of keeps

613
00:28:28.489 --> 00:28:30.560
you in the news, right? That keeps the the

614
00:28:30.569 --> 00:28:33.540
arguments going, it brings more attention to your movement

615
00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:34.109
et cetera.

616
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.180
And do we know if there are many people

617
00:28:39.189 --> 00:28:44.280
on the internet that actually create fake content? Because

618
00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.329
I mean, I've had on the show people that

619
00:28:46.339 --> 00:28:52.050
work specifically on misinformation on the internet and most

620
00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.510
of them tell me that when you look at

621
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.015
it, it's actually a very small number of people

622
00:28:59.025 --> 00:29:03.354
that, for example, put out political misinformation on the

623
00:29:03.364 --> 00:29:07.665
internet. Uh But then because, uh I mean, many

624
00:29:07.675 --> 00:29:10.555
times it's outrageous, then it garners a lot of

625
00:29:10.564 --> 00:29:14.035
attention, but it's actually a tiny number of people

626
00:29:14.045 --> 00:29:17.275
doing it and then many more people consuming it.

627
00:29:17.285 --> 00:29:20.594
But the ones who create it are not that

628
00:29:20.604 --> 00:29:21.265
many.

629
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.250
Yeah. So if, but so I would argue against

630
00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.050
this because if you take my more expansive view

631
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.260
of the internet and all of the participatory, right?

632
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.079
Uh MEDIA generation, uh the use of tools like

633
00:29:33.089 --> 00:29:36.369
Photoshop, the use of uh uh generative A I

634
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.660
mid journey dolly, right? All these systems, all the

635
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:42.400
content flooding uh people using, you know, uh facial

636
00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.069
filtering apps, right? Like all of this is generating

637
00:29:45.079 --> 00:29:47.439
quote unquote fake content, right? So that's basically all

638
00:29:47.449 --> 00:29:49.810
of us, right? We're all doing it. Um Think

639
00:29:49.819 --> 00:29:52.099
about how many people are creating their own memes,

640
00:29:52.109 --> 00:29:54.319
right? This is a staggering number of people, the

641
00:29:54.329 --> 00:29:56.430
people involved in these fandoms, right? This is like

642
00:29:56.439 --> 00:29:59.619
many millions of people. Um YOU know, again, there

643
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:02.189
there's a human inclination to tell stories, right? That's

644
00:30:02.199 --> 00:30:05.250
something really fundamental about our humanity. Um I, I

645
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.969
think again, if you're describing this in this very

646
00:30:06.979 --> 00:30:09.099
niche way, right? We, we were just like, you

647
00:30:09.109 --> 00:30:12.400
know, explicit political disinformation. Yeah, that there probably is

648
00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.819
a really small number of people. Um But, but

649
00:30:14.829 --> 00:30:17.359
this phenomenon is much broader, right? Um And, and

650
00:30:17.369 --> 00:30:18.959
again, I think there's a lot of these things

651
00:30:18.969 --> 00:30:21.459
get entangled too. Um One thing I like to

652
00:30:21.469 --> 00:30:24.719
think a lot about um parody and satire on

653
00:30:24.729 --> 00:30:27.709
the internet, especially political parody and satire. Um Some

654
00:30:27.719 --> 00:30:30.189
stuff looks like disinformation, but it's actually making a

655
00:30:30.199 --> 00:30:33.189
completely different political point, right? Uh If you stopped

656
00:30:33.199 --> 00:30:35.479
at the surface level message of the content, uh

657
00:30:35.489 --> 00:30:37.939
you're completely missing the point. Uh And a lot

658
00:30:37.949 --> 00:30:40.520
of meme culture, especially like political meme culture works

659
00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:43.310
that way. Um But, but again, this is kind

660
00:30:43.319 --> 00:30:44.949
of part of the motivation for this book, right?

661
00:30:44.959 --> 00:30:46.880
I I just kept seeing a lot of commentators

662
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.530
like stopping at the surface level. Um And you

663
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.660
just miss so much of the interesting stuff when

664
00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:52.239
you do that.

665
00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.489
So let me ask you now about video specifically

666
00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:00.359
because in more recent times we have uh deep

667
00:31:00.369 --> 00:31:04.959
fakes, we have a I generated video content and

668
00:31:04.969 --> 00:31:08.589
all of that. Uh And sometimes, I mean, people

669
00:31:08.599 --> 00:31:12.150
get into lots of trouble because particularly when it

670
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.000
comes to deep fake porn, they can actually create,

671
00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:21.209
generate videos where they put a particular person. It's

672
00:31:21.219 --> 00:31:26.810
usually women, unfortunately, uh in a porn video and

673
00:31:26.819 --> 00:31:30.170
sometimes it can be very, very damaging to their

674
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.130
social reputation. So, do you think that's uh perhaps

675
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:37.069
something that we should worry more about because it's

676
00:31:37.079 --> 00:31:40.270
a little bit more sophisticated or not?

677
00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.410
Yeah. In fact, I would argue this is like

678
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.400
a primary concern when we think about fake content,

679
00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.020
especially deep fakes, like the history of deep fakes

680
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.439
um is troubling, right? So again, this is something

681
00:31:51.449 --> 00:31:54.339
we hear about a lot. Uh ALMOST always in

682
00:31:54.349 --> 00:31:57.719
a political context though there has been uh growing

683
00:31:57.729 --> 00:32:00.750
reporting on the specific uh instance which you mentioned,

684
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.060
right, which is the creation of deep fake pornography.

685
00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:05.930
It turns out um the deep fakes algorithm was

686
00:32:05.939 --> 00:32:09.920
created specifically for that. Um WHEN, when it first

687
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.040
hits the internet, right? It's sort of being billed

688
00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:15.069
as a way to create your like fantasy porn,

689
00:32:15.079 --> 00:32:18.140
right? You can take some actress' face and, and

690
00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:19.880
again, it's always like in a sort of female

691
00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:24.010
context which I think is, is incredibly misogynistic. Um

692
00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.719
And, and, you know, it's like you can create,

693
00:32:25.729 --> 00:32:27.859
you know, some scene using, you know, some existing

694
00:32:27.869 --> 00:32:32.140
pornography. Um AND this becomes quite popular. Uh THEN

695
00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.680
along the way, um it became a mechanism for

696
00:32:35.689 --> 00:32:37.859
uh re creating revenge porn, right? It's like, oh

697
00:32:37.869 --> 00:32:39.880
you don't actually have to film a real scene.

698
00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.780
Um YOU can take your ex's face right and

699
00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:46.229
post it into porn. Uh AND even more troubling

700
00:32:46.239 --> 00:32:50.449
now, it's like middle school students are like bullying

701
00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.530
other students using this right? Trying to humiliate them.

702
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.290
I I think all of this is appalling. I

703
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.910
I think this is like one specific scenario where

704
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.310
deep fakes are highly effective and this is related

705
00:33:00.319 --> 00:33:03.625
to my earlier point about obvious fakes being more

706
00:33:03.635 --> 00:33:06.875
effective than perfect fakes, like even a bad deep

707
00:33:06.885 --> 00:33:09.744
fake, right? That is obviously fake can humiliate somebody,

708
00:33:09.755 --> 00:33:11.814
right? Like that's just like devastating, right? If you're

709
00:33:11.824 --> 00:33:14.454
like, you know, an eighth grade girl and all

710
00:33:14.464 --> 00:33:16.614
of the boys in your school, right? Are circulating

711
00:33:16.625 --> 00:33:19.234
these fake porn videos, right? That are obviously fake,

712
00:33:19.244 --> 00:33:20.854
right? I I think this is, this is terrible,

713
00:33:20.864 --> 00:33:23.265
this is a serious social problem. Um I I

714
00:33:23.275 --> 00:33:25.275
think it's endemic too of like this broader porn

715
00:33:25.285 --> 00:33:28.035
culture which I find appalling uh on the internet.

716
00:33:28.045 --> 00:33:31.069
But again, a lot of that involves fake content.

717
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.869
Um COMING back to the politics of deep fakes

718
00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.729
though those almost never work, right? I I feel

719
00:33:35.739 --> 00:33:38.170
like, you know, we talk a lot about them.

720
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.160
There hasn't really been an instance that you can

721
00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.530
sort of definitively say this deep fake swayed an

722
00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.140
election, right? This deep fake had a serious political

723
00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:50.229
implication. Um THEY almost always appear posted by anonymous

724
00:33:50.363 --> 00:33:53.753
accounts, right? That are not any maj major news

725
00:33:53.762 --> 00:33:57.192
source. Uh THEY are almost immediately debunked right away

726
00:33:57.203 --> 00:34:00.243
because again, they, they depict public figures, especially politicians

727
00:34:00.253 --> 00:34:03.422
who have public, you know, uh schedules. They are,

728
00:34:03.432 --> 00:34:06.133
they are scrutinized by the media minute by minute.

729
00:34:06.302 --> 00:34:08.572
Right. They're, they're constantly, like, you know, like press

730
00:34:08.583 --> 00:34:11.235
pools following these people. Uh, AND so it just

731
00:34:11.246 --> 00:34:13.196
doesn't work. Right. You know, and, and again, like,

732
00:34:13.206 --> 00:34:15.476
I think people now sort of are savvy. Right.

733
00:34:15.485 --> 00:34:17.235
They're like, wait a minute, you know, this, this

734
00:34:17.246 --> 00:34:20.135
sensational video I'm looking at of this politician. If

735
00:34:20.145 --> 00:34:22.284
this were real, I probably would have heard about

736
00:34:22.295 --> 00:34:24.864
it, uh, from a paper of record, right. FROM

737
00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:27.516
a major, you know, uh news source. Um AND

738
00:34:27.525 --> 00:34:29.976
instead nobody's talking about this, right? It's just circulating

739
00:34:29.985 --> 00:34:30.755
on social media.

740
00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:36.188
And what about shock content websites? I mean, I

741
00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:39.639
remember back in the mid two thousands when I

742
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:43.270
was an adolescent that we were all the time

743
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.520
looking at that kind of content. I mean, I

744
00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.918
mean, at a certain point, it was almost like

745
00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:52.120
a rite of passage, particularly for boys that we

746
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:56.409
really had to expose ourselves to that those kinds

747
00:34:56.418 --> 00:35:00.379
of websites. So why are they so popular?

748
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.510
Yeah, I think this is another important piece of

749
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.840
the history of fake content on the internet. Um

750
00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:09.030
VERY early in this sort of, you know, like.com

751
00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.520
era, like shocking material was starting to gain an

752
00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:15.100
audience. Um There was one website in particular uh

753
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.889
rotten.com which I think is really fascinating. It was

754
00:35:17.899 --> 00:35:20.800
definitely like a very popular website, like looking back

755
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:23.135
actually, it's kind of shocking, like it was so

756
00:35:23.145 --> 00:35:26.235
popular. Um It, it got a lot of mainstream

757
00:35:26.245 --> 00:35:29.834
attention. Um uh BECAUSE it received so much traffic

758
00:35:29.844 --> 00:35:34.034
and it was routinely like posting content. Um THAT

759
00:35:34.044 --> 00:35:37.574
was like irresistible. You couldn't not look, right? Um

760
00:35:37.645 --> 00:35:41.114
Like a big early win for that site was

761
00:35:41.125 --> 00:35:46.389
um uh a picture that um allegedly depicted um

762
00:35:46.399 --> 00:35:49.219
the the fatal crash that killed Princess Diana, right?

763
00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.989
So this is like an internet form of rubber

764
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.340
necking on the road, right? It was like an

765
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.889
accident. Uh And again, that was such a major

766
00:35:54.899 --> 00:35:57.090
news story, like the whole world is paying attention

767
00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.120
and then all of a sudden it's like, oh,

768
00:35:58.129 --> 00:36:00.949
look, the photo is on the internet. Um Now

769
00:36:00.959 --> 00:36:02.649
what's interesting about that photo is it was, it

770
00:36:02.659 --> 00:36:04.750
was completely fake. It, it didn't, it didn't uh

771
00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.399
depict the the accident at all. Uh The French

772
00:36:07.409 --> 00:36:09.830
government was chiming in saying, you know, this, this

773
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.370
does not match, you know, any sort of uh

774
00:36:13.379 --> 00:36:16.969
uh emergency responder vehicle type that we have in

775
00:36:16.979 --> 00:36:20.524
France. Um But people kept looking, right? Um WHICH

776
00:36:20.534 --> 00:36:23.445
is really, really interesting. Um And the site again

777
00:36:23.455 --> 00:36:25.604
just would find odd things. Some of it was

778
00:36:25.614 --> 00:36:28.235
real, some of it wasn't um it was really

779
00:36:28.245 --> 00:36:31.885
sort of an internet version of, you know, PT

780
00:36:31.895 --> 00:36:36.084
Barnum's Museum, right? This sort of like Sideshow uh

781
00:36:36.094 --> 00:36:39.405
type of entertainment, which was very popular uh in

782
00:36:39.415 --> 00:36:43.195
America uh for many decades. Um And I think

783
00:36:43.205 --> 00:36:47.850
it is more along the lines of um storytelling,

784
00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:51.969
right? Again, like, like, like uh cultural commentary through,

785
00:36:51.979 --> 00:36:55.790
right? Um These, these uh stories versus something that

786
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.979
was really malicious, right? Like a form of disinformation.

787
00:36:59.229 --> 00:37:00.820
Um Again, I, I feel like the site like

788
00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:03.010
is very much like situated, you know, in this,

789
00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.320
this longer tradition of storytelling, um which again is

790
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.169
really, really interesting. Um And it remains popular for

791
00:37:09.179 --> 00:37:11.659
many years. It's not until really social media becomes

792
00:37:11.669 --> 00:37:13.709
dominant in terms of like where people are going,

793
00:37:13.719 --> 00:37:15.629
that the site kind of fades away. Um It

794
00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:17.689
was very much like a piece of like the

795
00:37:17.699 --> 00:37:20.530
the.com boom that sort of like lives on uh

796
00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.820
right up until the point where social media uh

797
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.290
takes off. Um And again, a lot of it

798
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.979
was just again, like, it left people guessing, which

799
00:37:26.989 --> 00:37:28.209
I think was like the most intriguing part of

800
00:37:28.219 --> 00:37:29.739
the site, you know, it's like this could be

801
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.580
real, right? Like there's something here, right? Like maybe

802
00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:35.239
just, maybe, no, it's real. Um And the creator

803
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:36.639
of the site again, was really good at creating

804
00:37:36.649 --> 00:37:40.520
sort of ambiguous, like descriptions of things, like describing

805
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:43.389
things in ambiguous terms that always left people guessing,

806
00:37:43.399 --> 00:37:45.780
uh which I think is really interesting. Um So

807
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.439
again, a lot of people were like, horrified by

808
00:37:47.449 --> 00:37:49.000
the site, there was a lot of terrible stuff

809
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.179
on there. Uh But again, more along the lines

810
00:37:51.189 --> 00:37:54.159
of like a sideshow attraction and not really like

811
00:37:54.169 --> 00:37:56.399
political, right? Or, or, or sort of malicious in

812
00:37:56.409 --> 00:37:59.290
any way. Um WHICH again, like in, in context,

813
00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.040
I think uh makes sense.

814
00:38:02.219 --> 00:38:07.320
And in what ways do computer hackers relate to

815
00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:09.989
fake things on the internet? I mean, what's the

816
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.350
relationship here?

817
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:13.949
Yeah. So hackers were behind the scenes for a

818
00:38:13.959 --> 00:38:15.739
lot of these things we've been talking about, for

819
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.810
instance, uh rotten.com uh was created by somebody uh

820
00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.100
who was uh around the hacker scene, right? A

821
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:25.199
hacker who went by the handle soil. Uh HE

822
00:38:25.209 --> 00:38:28.030
was an early text file writer. Um And so,

823
00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.080
so text files are like these like short little

824
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:34.189
stories. Um Sometimes they were technical, sometimes they were,

825
00:38:34.199 --> 00:38:37.560
and sometimes they blended storytelling and technical content. It

826
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.679
was like, it was a very low bandwidth era

827
00:38:39.689 --> 00:38:41.419
even up through like the early two thousands, right?

828
00:38:41.429 --> 00:38:43.929
A lot of people didn't have uh broadband of

829
00:38:43.939 --> 00:38:46.030
any sort, right? Wi Fi wasn't really a thing.

830
00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.020
Uh And so hackers find like really interesting ways

831
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.780
to communicate, like in these low bandwidth uh uh

832
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:55.679
uh mechanisms. Um And what's interesting about computer hacking

833
00:38:55.689 --> 00:38:57.959
and we, we kind of stereotype it, you know,

834
00:38:57.969 --> 00:39:01.080
oh, like these are like lone individuals, like in

835
00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:05.185
a base breaking into systems doing these malicious things.

836
00:39:05.445 --> 00:39:09.044
Um And that's not really the way the subculture

837
00:39:09.054 --> 00:39:11.405
worked. Number one, it was a subculture. Uh IT

838
00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:14.864
was very social. Um It was very creative. Uh

839
00:39:14.875 --> 00:39:18.284
IT was more about um the creative use of

840
00:39:18.294 --> 00:39:22.044
technology or sort of like using technology in unanticipated

841
00:39:22.054 --> 00:39:24.614
ways, you know, the designer created this product. Um

842
00:39:24.625 --> 00:39:26.495
But you sort of hacked it to figure out,

843
00:39:26.504 --> 00:39:29.024
oh, like I can enable like these features, the

844
00:39:29.034 --> 00:39:32.070
creator never really intended uh by putting these things

845
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:36.030
together, adding things, right, removing things. Um And there's

846
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.719
like this long history of, of, of people operating

847
00:39:38.729 --> 00:39:41.060
in this mode. Um And so the the computer

848
00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:43.229
hackers of like the sort of like eighties, nineties

849
00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:45.300
and two thousands are, are doing that. But using

850
00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:49.090
social technologies, um they're obsessed with early computer networking,

851
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.580
like bulletin board systems, again, allows them to connect

852
00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.949
to other people uh who are thinking similar things.

853
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:57.550
Um And what's fascinating about this text file culture

854
00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.209
that develops in parallel to this? Um There's just

855
00:40:01.219 --> 00:40:03.560
a tremendous amount of fake stuff, right? Because again,

856
00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:06.854
like these, they storytelling, right? Writing little stories, um

857
00:40:06.864 --> 00:40:09.094
they're trying to build a proper subculture, right? That

858
00:40:09.104 --> 00:40:12.175
usually means you need some foundational myths. Um So

859
00:40:12.185 --> 00:40:14.875
hackers, like, you know, we're talking about these fantastic

860
00:40:14.885 --> 00:40:17.985
like escapades, some, some of them blending some, some

861
00:40:17.995 --> 00:40:20.774
real, you know, uh information, right? It's like people

862
00:40:20.784 --> 00:40:23.864
were actively breaking into computer systems. Um But sometimes

863
00:40:23.875 --> 00:40:26.054
talking about things they found there that did not

864
00:40:26.064 --> 00:40:29.274
exist, right? Um UFO material, for instance, right? All

865
00:40:29.284 --> 00:40:32.300
these interesting uh things that would make these text

866
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:36.590
files uh just so irresistible to newcomers, right? Uh

867
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.370
TO the subculture. Um AND hackers are really good

868
00:40:39.379 --> 00:40:41.729
too at identifying flaws and systems, right? So they're

869
00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:45.129
thinking about this media ecosystem that is evolving quite

870
00:40:45.139 --> 00:40:47.820
rapidly, right? Especially when you get into the.com era

871
00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:51.389
of the nineties, they're thinking about disinformation. You know,

872
00:40:51.399 --> 00:40:54.010
it's like if you weren't like, sort of virtuous,

873
00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:57.260
right? Most hackers were, um what ways could you

874
00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:00.949
exploit the media, right? Uh TO social engineer people

875
00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:03.080
uh in dangerous ways. Um You know, they're, they're

876
00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:05.419
thinking about the media very broadly, which I think

877
00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:08.189
is really interesting. Uh A lot of the hackers

878
00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:11.280
I talked to were quite media savvy. Um uh

879
00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:14.820
A lot of the, the material they were producing

880
00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:18.530
decades ago, resonates, I think uh today because they

881
00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.330
really anticipate where all this was going. Um This

882
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.290
sort of, again, like, like Marshall mcluhan, I mentioned

883
00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.979
earlier, like have a really strong sense of the

884
00:41:25.989 --> 00:41:28.219
trajectory of the technology and how people will use

885
00:41:28.229 --> 00:41:30.860
it socially. Um And again, it's something I think

886
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:32.989
a lot of people don't give hackers credit for.

887
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.250
Um AGAIN, a community that, that just love the

888
00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.929
internet still loves the internet. Um But the writing

889
00:41:37.939 --> 00:41:39.260
was on the wall in terms of where a

890
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:41.129
lot of these things were going for them. Um

891
00:41:41.139 --> 00:41:42.620
And again, they were trying to send out warnings

892
00:41:42.629 --> 00:41:45.239
signs uh in some cases, but uh a a

893
00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:47.179
lot of people were ignoring it or just didn't

894
00:41:47.189 --> 00:41:49.449
think it would ever sort of come to fruition

895
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.179
and talking about the media more generally. How do

896
00:41:54.189 --> 00:41:58.659
you look at the relationship or dynamic between traditional

897
00:41:58.669 --> 00:42:04.169
media and the internet and new or alternative media

898
00:42:04.179 --> 00:42:08.139
in this particular context of fake things.

899
00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:11.610
Yeah. So I, I'll point out again, like there,

900
00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.219
there are a lot of assumptions we make about

901
00:42:13.229 --> 00:42:17.969
the traditional media versus um the, the internet today,

902
00:42:17.979 --> 00:42:21.330
these digital mediums that we use for communication. Um

903
00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:24.850
Fake news was always a problem. Um In, in

904
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.850
my book, I look at um cases of this.

905
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:32.050
Um uh AGAIN, journalists have a habit of sensationalizing

906
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.020
stories that is nothing new. Um There, there are

907
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.320
strategies you can use if you're being interviewed, I'm

908
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:40.860
not doing this here. But when you interviewed to

909
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.979
like inject, you know, information that, you know, the

910
00:42:42.989 --> 00:42:45.860
reporter is going to report on, uh because there

911
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:48.729
is such a good hook there. Um A lot

912
00:42:48.739 --> 00:42:51.020
of traditional media is a business and of course,

913
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.850
you need to sell product. Um And so again,

914
00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.290
a lot of sensational reporting becomes problematic. Um Again,

915
00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:00.530
that's nothing new. Um I think what, what is

916
00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:05.199
new um the participatory nature, right? Because again, there's

917
00:43:05.209 --> 00:43:09.169
a lot of gatekeeping in traditional media. Um You

918
00:43:09.179 --> 00:43:11.870
know, you have to like, you know, go through

919
00:43:11.879 --> 00:43:13.899
a process to become a professional reporter, right? You

920
00:43:13.909 --> 00:43:15.229
know, there's a lot of training, right? You need

921
00:43:15.239 --> 00:43:18.639
credentials. Um IF you're gonna like work in prestige

922
00:43:18.649 --> 00:43:20.820
uh media, right? Like you have to be elite,

923
00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.250
right? Um You have to like go to the

924
00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.199
right schools know the right people um you know,

925
00:43:25.209 --> 00:43:27.699
be a really good writer, all these different things.

926
00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.280
Um You can avoid all of that gatekeeping if

927
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:33.639
you just publish your own stuff online, right? You

928
00:43:33.649 --> 00:43:36.245
can become a youtuber, right? Say whatever you want,

929
00:43:36.294 --> 00:43:38.925
right? You can like create tiktoks and say whatever

930
00:43:38.935 --> 00:43:41.294
you want. Um So you have this divide now

931
00:43:41.304 --> 00:43:44.304
between like a very elite, like, you know, like

932
00:43:44.314 --> 00:43:46.885
um media, right? Like that is sort of like

933
00:43:46.895 --> 00:43:50.395
pushing content top down. Um And then everybody on

934
00:43:50.405 --> 00:43:52.875
the internet, right, creating their own media and it's

935
00:43:52.885 --> 00:43:54.925
coming from the bottom up. Um I think that's

936
00:43:54.935 --> 00:43:57.084
a huge change uh in the media, right? Because

937
00:43:57.094 --> 00:43:59.235
that really didn't exist until very recently with these

938
00:43:59.245 --> 00:44:02.600
tech, these digital technologies, right? With computer networking. Um

939
00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:05.379
THAT again, that's not to say that 11 way

940
00:44:05.389 --> 00:44:06.840
is better than the other. I think there are

941
00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:09.280
advantages to both, right? Um A lot of that

942
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:12.719
gatekeeping, you know, uh if you have uh really

943
00:44:12.729 --> 00:44:15.969
honest journalists, right, that are really scrutinizing their, their

944
00:44:15.979 --> 00:44:19.449
sources uh that are trying to envoi of sensationalism,

945
00:44:19.459 --> 00:44:21.489
right? Like you're gonna get really good coverage of

946
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.340
a topic um that said um sometimes, right, like

947
00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:28.000
the wisdom of the crowd is valuable, right? I

948
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:31.090
know sometimes public sentiment uh uh is telling you

949
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.219
something different than what the reporters are telling you,

950
00:44:33.229 --> 00:44:35.330
right? And that could be really important. Um But

951
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.610
there's a lot again of storytelling on, on both

952
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.770
sides, um which makes it complicated

953
00:44:40.919 --> 00:44:44.860
and what does A I add to the picture

954
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:47.399
here when it comes to fake things on the

955
00:44:47.409 --> 00:44:50.219
internet. You know, I have to ask you this

956
00:44:50.229 --> 00:44:54.239
because people are obsessed with A I now because

957
00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.889
of open A I chat GP T. So all

958
00:44:57.899 --> 00:44:58.860
of that. So,

959
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.860
so again, I'm a computer scientist so I, I

960
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:04.850
try to take a reasonable view of this. Um

961
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.520
II, I, I'm not freaking out about this at

962
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:10.219
all. Um I, I don't think this is like

963
00:45:10.229 --> 00:45:13.790
an incredible revolution that appeared suddenly uh again, a

964
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.629
lot of that is sensational reporting around this and

965
00:45:16.639 --> 00:45:20.290
also um the pr operations of these companies that

966
00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:23.620
are producing these products, like working in overdrive to

967
00:45:23.629 --> 00:45:26.979
promote these sensational uh takes on the technology. I

968
00:45:26.989 --> 00:45:29.239
do think it's really important. I think it's interesting

969
00:45:29.379 --> 00:45:31.560
though in the book, I look at it in

970
00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:35.360
context. Um THERE is a long history uh behind

971
00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:38.389
things like generative A I um that again is

972
00:45:38.399 --> 00:45:41.780
largely being ignored. Um uh WHICH uh you know,

973
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:42.840
part of that I think is, is there's a

974
00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:45.739
lot of complicated technical material, right that you have

975
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:48.229
to sort of sift through. Um But the idea

976
00:45:48.239 --> 00:45:51.189
of synthesizing content um goes back decades. Um There

977
00:45:51.199 --> 00:45:52.949
was a lot of work on it. Um It

978
00:45:52.959 --> 00:45:54.649
was just really hard to do in a practical

979
00:45:54.659 --> 00:45:57.010
sense because you didn't have the internet in like

980
00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:00.030
the 19 sixties. I'm sure you had really good

981
00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:04.229
um uh probabilistic generative models operating in a Bayesian

982
00:46:04.239 --> 00:46:06.290
context, et cetera. But that was like all math,

983
00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:09.600
you know, on the chalkboard, um you didn't have

984
00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:13.459
uh graphical processing units, right? These like supercomputers, right,

985
00:46:13.469 --> 00:46:16.260
that are packaged up for our home computers, um

986
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:18.120
which is really difficult to do, right? So again,

987
00:46:18.129 --> 00:46:20.419
you see this inflection point more recently where like

988
00:46:20.429 --> 00:46:22.610
got a ton of data on the internet, you

989
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.340
also have these GP US, you can put these

990
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:26.379
things together and all of a sudden, right? Um

991
00:46:26.389 --> 00:46:31.020
THESE older ideas become uh quite useful. Um And

992
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.750
I think the way people are using these things

993
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.790
is actually mostly good. Um Again, coming back to

994
00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.580
a lot of these like fandoms I've been talking

995
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:39.659
about, you know, there are all sorts of interesting

996
00:46:39.669 --> 00:46:42.649
uh generative models that can like recast content in

997
00:46:42.659 --> 00:46:45.479
the style of whatever you love. Um There are

998
00:46:45.489 --> 00:46:47.995
a lot of people, people creating digital art. Um

999
00:46:48.004 --> 00:46:49.864
YOU know, there's, there's an entire new sort of

1000
00:46:49.875 --> 00:46:52.205
opening for artists like, you know, in this, this

1001
00:46:52.215 --> 00:46:55.165
digital space, uh a lot of uh a lot

1002
00:46:55.175 --> 00:46:57.614
of creativity, uh A lot of people like, like

1003
00:46:57.625 --> 00:47:01.245
doing really interesting installations, right? Using combinations of like,

1004
00:47:01.254 --> 00:47:04.705
you know, um uh uh observer interaction with a

1005
00:47:04.715 --> 00:47:06.945
generative A I system to change, you know, the

1006
00:47:06.955 --> 00:47:10.290
sort of experience from, from person to person. Um

1007
00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.590
All of this is really great. Um Now, of

1008
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.370
course, again, there, there is a lot of hysteria

1009
00:47:14.379 --> 00:47:15.979
over this as well. Right. It was like, oh,

1010
00:47:15.989 --> 00:47:18.189
no chat GP. T, right. It's gonna, you know,

1011
00:47:18.199 --> 00:47:20.850
end education as we know it because all students

1012
00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.649
will cheat as, as an educator. I, I think

1013
00:47:23.659 --> 00:47:25.780
that's like a ludicrous proposition because you really have

1014
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:27.715
like, no faith yourself as an educator. You have

1015
00:47:27.725 --> 00:47:30.054
no, you have no trust in your students and

1016
00:47:30.064 --> 00:47:32.885
they're always gonna be cheaters. Um. Right. I think

1017
00:47:32.895 --> 00:47:35.084
there's like some baseline of cheating that, like doesn't

1018
00:47:35.094 --> 00:47:37.465
fluctuate very much and like the cheaters are just

1019
00:47:37.475 --> 00:47:39.554
going to adopt new tools. Uh And then you

1020
00:47:39.564 --> 00:47:40.594
have a lot of students that actually want to

1021
00:47:40.604 --> 00:47:42.094
learn, right? Um And they're not going to use

1022
00:47:42.104 --> 00:47:44.514
it that way. Um I, yeah, I, I think,

1023
00:47:44.524 --> 00:47:46.455
I think this is kind of silly. Um And

1024
00:47:46.465 --> 00:47:48.014
the other thing too is like, these systems again,

1025
00:47:48.024 --> 00:47:52.225
are not, they're not quite human like either. Um

1026
00:47:52.739 --> 00:47:54.629
You know, especially with like image and video synthesis

1027
00:47:54.639 --> 00:47:56.459
is often very easy to see that, you know,

1028
00:47:56.469 --> 00:47:57.889
oh, this is like an image that's come from

1029
00:47:57.899 --> 00:47:59.959
one of these systems. In fact, I can almost

1030
00:47:59.969 --> 00:48:01.199
tell now I've looked at so many, you know,

1031
00:48:01.209 --> 00:48:02.959
like, like mid journey dolly images. I can, I

1032
00:48:02.969 --> 00:48:04.939
can sort of like fingerprint the system just by

1033
00:48:04.949 --> 00:48:06.149
looking at the image where it's like, oh, like

1034
00:48:06.159 --> 00:48:08.699
that came from mid journey, right? Like, you know,

1035
00:48:08.709 --> 00:48:10.915
it's like, it's not quite, I think at the

1036
00:48:10.925 --> 00:48:14.544
point where again, like uh uh everything is, is

1037
00:48:14.554 --> 00:48:16.864
is falling apart. Um And again, for all the

1038
00:48:16.875 --> 00:48:18.794
reasons I mentioned too, in terms of like how

1039
00:48:18.804 --> 00:48:21.794
people sort of vet information. II, I don't think

1040
00:48:21.804 --> 00:48:25.205
this is um a disaster scenario. II, I think

1041
00:48:25.215 --> 00:48:27.165
for the most part, these technologies are pretty interesting

1042
00:48:27.175 --> 00:48:27.544
and good.

1043
00:48:28.709 --> 00:48:32.129
So I have two more questions here. Uh The

1044
00:48:32.139 --> 00:48:36.080
next one is uh II, I think you've already

1045
00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:40.189
sort of touched on these slightly earlier. But could

1046
00:48:40.199 --> 00:48:43.610
you tell us about this idea of myth building?

1047
00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.979
I mean, what is myth building? And in what

1048
00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:50.090
ways does it relate to fake things on the

1049
00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:50.649
internet?

1050
00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:54.889
Yeah. So turning back to the field of anthropology,

1051
00:48:54.899 --> 00:48:56.439
um a lot of what I'm talking about here

1052
00:48:56.449 --> 00:48:59.729
is really well known uh e especially like uh

1053
00:48:59.739 --> 00:49:03.780
among scholars who study different cultures, um study, you

1054
00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:06.010
know, studies like trying to understand like how we

1055
00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:10.689
communicate, like how we, we interact as peoples. Um

1056
00:49:10.699 --> 00:49:15.159
The stories are really diagnostic. Um Levy Strauss, Claude

1057
00:49:15.169 --> 00:49:18.389
Levy Strauss. Um He's an incredibly important thinker uh

1058
00:49:18.399 --> 00:49:21.030
from the 20th century. I, I think he has

1059
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.330
just an excellent handle on, on how people communicate

1060
00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:27.550
in general. Uh And I'm rather shocked that more

1061
00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.610
people don't talk about the internet through the lens

1062
00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:33.419
of Levy Strauss. So he argues that people think

1063
00:49:33.429 --> 00:49:37.689
in two different ways. Uh One is rational thought

1064
00:49:37.699 --> 00:49:39.820
and this is really in the present day, like

1065
00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:41.929
all we tend to think about when we think

1066
00:49:41.939 --> 00:49:44.860
about thinking, right? You know, it's like people are

1067
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:48.570
highly rational creatures, right? We filter everything through logic.

1068
00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:52.969
Uh We only use observable evidence to make decisions

1069
00:49:52.979 --> 00:49:55.239
uh that will lead to our behaviors in the,

1070
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:59.209
in the world. And when you see people thinking

1071
00:49:59.219 --> 00:50:02.439
things that's irrational and that's bad, right? Like we

1072
00:50:02.449 --> 00:50:05.379
should only think purely rationally. Um If you look

1073
00:50:05.389 --> 00:50:07.209
at the history of the internet, um there's actually

1074
00:50:07.219 --> 00:50:10.830
like uh like a prominent subculture that develops around

1075
00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.229
like this, this idea of rational thought where you

1076
00:50:13.239 --> 00:50:15.649
get these rationalists, uh Many of them are computer

1077
00:50:15.659 --> 00:50:18.389
scientists and mathematicians. Um And they have again, this,

1078
00:50:18.399 --> 00:50:21.620
like very specific notion of what thinking should be

1079
00:50:21.629 --> 00:50:24.310
and they, they just despise everything, right? That isn't

1080
00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:28.000
that. Um Now, rational thinking is important. Again, I'm

1081
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.370
a computer scientist, I appreciate, right? What logic allows

1082
00:50:31.379 --> 00:50:34.070
us to do all these digital technologies we're talking

1083
00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:37.590
about are underpinned by, right, formal logic. Um But

1084
00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.840
at the same time that misses a lot of

1085
00:50:41.304 --> 00:50:42.935
how we think, right, on a day to day

1086
00:50:42.945 --> 00:50:45.405
basis for every, we started talking about, you know,

1087
00:50:45.415 --> 00:50:49.094
this podcast, um the imagination dreaming. Um All of

1088
00:50:49.104 --> 00:50:52.645
these things fit into what Levi Strauss describes as

1089
00:50:52.655 --> 00:50:58.235
mythical thought. Um So he argues equally important to

1090
00:50:58.245 --> 00:51:02.625
rational thought is mythical thought thinking beyond your immediate

1091
00:51:02.635 --> 00:51:06.139
circumstances through fiction. Um This is extremely important for

1092
00:51:06.149 --> 00:51:09.330
problem solving. He argues because you're quite limited in

1093
00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:12.340
terms of your immediate observations. Um If I can

1094
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:14.500
think of something that doesn't exist now. Maybe I

1095
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:16.520
can figure out how to build it, you know,

1096
00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:19.780
I can cobble together all these pieces, um, and

1097
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:24.439
bring into being something fundamentally new. Um, IRONICALLY, um,

1098
00:51:24.449 --> 00:51:27.850
engineers, scientists, all these highly rational people do this

1099
00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:29.600
all of the time. Right. If they don't use

1100
00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:32.389
their imagination, they're kind of stuck. Right. Uh, WITH

1101
00:51:32.399 --> 00:51:34.820
what they have in their immediate surroundings and that's

1102
00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:37.804
not good. Um, SO Strauss has a sweeping sort

1103
00:51:37.814 --> 00:51:40.274
of view of all this, right? Um All of

1104
00:51:40.284 --> 00:51:43.264
the, the sort of, you know, creativity, uh all

1105
00:51:43.274 --> 00:51:45.455
the myths, all of the religions, right? He wraps

1106
00:51:45.465 --> 00:51:47.614
all of this up and he's arguing, you can't

1107
00:51:47.625 --> 00:51:50.504
really exist successfully uh as a person unless you

1108
00:51:50.514 --> 00:51:52.625
do both of these things uh in your mind.

1109
00:51:52.909 --> 00:51:54.570
Um And if you view the internet in that

1110
00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.090
context and it makes a lot more sense. Right?

1111
00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:59.370
It's like, oh, like it's not this purely rational

1112
00:51:59.379 --> 00:52:01.389
space. It was built out to be, right? Those

1113
00:52:01.399 --> 00:52:04.709
rationalist communities were completely wrong about this even earlier.

1114
00:52:04.719 --> 00:52:06.570
Right? There's this notion of the internet as an

1115
00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:10.149
information super highway. Uh Right. It'll be a database

1116
00:52:10.159 --> 00:52:11.959
of facts, right. You know, this is like the

1117
00:52:11.969 --> 00:52:14.270
marketing of the internet, you know, in the nineties,

1118
00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.469
uh, big companies love this idea. You know, it's

1119
00:52:16.479 --> 00:52:19.090
like we'll go there for commerce and education, it

1120
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:21.939
will only be serious, right? Um And this is

1121
00:52:21.949 --> 00:52:24.979
gonna like, you know, propel humanity forward. Um, BUT

1122
00:52:24.989 --> 00:52:26.489
that's not really why people were going to the

1123
00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.429
internet, right? They realized, wait a minute, all these

1124
00:52:28.439 --> 00:52:32.010
interesting creative uh pieces of software exist there. All

1125
00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:34.975
these virtual communities are being bootstrapped. Um We love

1126
00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:37.064
the social aspects of it, right? That's much better

1127
00:52:37.074 --> 00:52:39.104
than this information Super Highway thing, which is pretty

1128
00:52:39.114 --> 00:52:42.564
bland uh and corporate. Um AND that really fulfills,

1129
00:52:42.574 --> 00:52:44.804
right? What mcluhan is talking about when he envisions

1130
00:52:44.814 --> 00:52:46.274
this, which is very much in the mood again

1131
00:52:46.284 --> 00:52:48.425
of Levy Strauss, right? These were all very popular

1132
00:52:48.435 --> 00:52:51.504
ideas uh in the mid 20th century. Um And

1133
00:52:51.514 --> 00:52:53.205
so that I think is a much better way

1134
00:52:53.215 --> 00:52:55.145
to think about the internet, which I think, you

1135
00:52:55.155 --> 00:52:56.264
know, if, if, if you were thinking about that,

1136
00:52:56.274 --> 00:52:58.594
like may chill you out if you're so paranoid

1137
00:52:58.604 --> 00:53:00.544
about uh people faking things.

1138
00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:04.100
And do you think that this is also something

1139
00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:08.000
to do with the way that we create relationships

1140
00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:10.590
with other people, how we relate socially? Because, I

1141
00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.159
mean, in terms of how we build a social

1142
00:53:13.169 --> 00:53:17.919
identity, the kinds of uh shared social identities that

1143
00:53:17.929 --> 00:53:20.679
we have. I mean, they are very much based

1144
00:53:20.689 --> 00:53:22.909
on myth building as well.

1145
00:53:23.149 --> 00:53:25.540
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, foundational myths, right? I mean, those

1146
00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:27.800
are key to any sort of culture, any sort

1147
00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:31.000
of community. Um And, and again, they're, they're really

1148
00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:33.060
useful, right? Um And I think it was fascinating

1149
00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:35.389
going back to like antiquity, right? It's like almost

1150
00:53:35.399 --> 00:53:37.489
everything that is serious is like filtered through the

1151
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.189
Homeric poems, right? Like why are people doing that?

1152
00:53:40.469 --> 00:53:42.629
Um It's because they can evoke, right? The, the

1153
00:53:42.639 --> 00:53:46.419
characters from those poems to express like certain sentiments,

1154
00:53:46.429 --> 00:53:48.979
right? Certain political ideas is, and it would put

1155
00:53:48.989 --> 00:53:51.290
everybody on a common basis, right? Everybody was speaking

1156
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.110
that language. Um THAT hasn't changed. Right. Again, you

1157
00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.429
see lots of different communities doing this. Um We

1158
00:53:56.439 --> 00:53:58.489
do this in politics today, right? We do this

1159
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.149
like, you know, in all these different subcultures we've

1160
00:54:00.159 --> 00:54:02.340
been talking about. Um AND all that is actually

1161
00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:04.459
good, right? That's important. Um That's always been a

1162
00:54:04.469 --> 00:54:06.350
piece of human communication.

1163
00:54:07.489 --> 00:54:10.979
So my last question then how much of a

1164
00:54:10.989 --> 00:54:15.139
problem do you think fake things on the internet

1165
00:54:15.149 --> 00:54:16.669
are actually?

1166
00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.199
Yeah, I I don't, as I've been saying, I

1167
00:54:19.209 --> 00:54:23.600
don't think it's the existential problem people are describing

1168
00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:26.770
it as um I think that is pretty silly.

1169
00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:29.959
That is an overgeneralization and in some sense, something

1170
00:54:29.969 --> 00:54:32.300
that is fake. Um That said we did talk

1171
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:34.500
about some legitimate social problems we should be very

1172
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:36.879
concerned about. Um Like, I don't think it's great

1173
00:54:36.889 --> 00:54:39.550
that middle schoolers are creating fake porn, right? That's

1174
00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:43.250
really bad. We should do something about that. Um

1175
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:46.449
II I don't think great like trolling, right? That's

1176
00:54:46.459 --> 00:54:49.590
like bullying people online, right? Like and humiliating them

1177
00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:52.360
using right? Targeted fake content is good. Um I

1178
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:55.679
don't think it's good that elderly people are being

1179
00:54:55.689 --> 00:54:59.280
targeted by scams using synthetic voice tracks of the

1180
00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:02.360
relatives. Um These are, these are the real problems

1181
00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:04.360
I think we should be focused on. Um And

1182
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:06.070
again, like thinking about how we want to use

1183
00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:09.300
this technology. Well, um I think if we backed

1184
00:55:09.310 --> 00:55:12.300
off the hysteria related to partisan politics, right, we

1185
00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:15.320
could more effectively respond to these problems and probably

1186
