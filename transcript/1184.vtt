00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.200
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.260
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.409
today I'm joined by Doctor Mael Lemoine. He's a

4
00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:13.289
professor of philosophy at the University of Bordeaux, and

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.859
he, today we're going to talk about his book,

6
00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.819
Philosophy of Physiology. So Doctor Lemoan, welcome to the

7
00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:21.719
show. It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.239
Yeah, shared pleasure for me. Thank you for having

9
00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:24.680
me here.

10
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.569
So, uh, the book is centered on philosophy of

11
00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:32.770
physiology, but of course if I understood it correctly,

12
00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:36.169
there's a lot of overlap with questions that people

13
00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:40.009
explore in the philosophy of medicine, and we can

14
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:44.970
talk more about that and clarify that issue. How

15
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.849
do people tend to approach the question what is

16
00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:52.889
health and disease in the philosophy of medicine?

17
00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:56.740
I think they tend to approach it as a

18
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.830
practice and uh so they see medicine as a

19
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.389
practice, which it is, of course, and uh they

20
00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:06.949
are mostly interested in, for instance, questions like values

21
00:01:06.949 --> 00:01:12.279
uh that would um uh. Be active in that

22
00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:14.680
practice or you know, play a role in the

23
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.739
decisions that are taken and that kind of, uh,

24
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.239
so that's the kind of approach they generally have.

25
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.959
And uh I would say in philosophical terms, they

26
00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.760
also many of them have, I think implicitly and

27
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.519
they're not aware of it, they have what I

28
00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:33.319
call a foundationalist view of uh of general questions

29
00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.330
like what health is or what disease is. And

30
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.260
by that I mean that they tend to, to

31
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.260
admit the idea that these concepts are fixed once

32
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.300
and for all and would determine, uh medical practice

33
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.699
in general, uh, in contrast with a view where

34
00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:54.660
these concepts are in fact scientific and as as

35
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.379
such, they are open to many modifications depending on

36
00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:01.260
what we discover and how we come to conceptualize

37
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.059
health and disease.

38
00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:05.809
In the book, er, right at the very beginning,

39
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.899
you talk about the divide between the naturalists and

40
00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.869
the normativists in the philosophy of medicine. Could you

41
00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:14.949
explain that divide?

42
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.179
Yes, it's so it's really a very traditional, very

43
00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:23.750
important divide in philosophy of medicine. The majority of

44
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.029
philosophers of medicine are more normativists, meaning that they

45
00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:33.410
consider concepts like health and disease to be value-laden

46
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.149
concepts, so they would insist on that idea, and

47
00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:41.229
I think that naturalists on the other side generally,

48
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.860
in general, would agree with the fact that there

49
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.764
are values. Involved in those terms, obviously I mean

50
00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:50.154
health is something that is good to have. Disease

51
00:02:50.154 --> 00:02:52.024
is something that is bad to have, but their

52
00:02:52.024 --> 00:02:55.035
point is that it's not the defining feature of

53
00:02:55.035 --> 00:02:57.835
those terms. They consider that it's connotations of the

54
00:02:57.835 --> 00:03:01.304
term or secondary properties of health and disease. It's

55
00:03:01.304 --> 00:03:03.074
good to have or bad to have, for instance,

56
00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:06.475
harmful or not and all that, whereas normativists would

57
00:03:06.475 --> 00:03:10.315
consider that this is the primary defining traits of

58
00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:14.035
those concepts. So that's approximately how the divide can

59
00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:14.514
be defined.

60
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.100
So right in my first question, I asked you

61
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.300
about what is health and what is disease and

62
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.539
how it is approached in the philosophy of medicine,

63
00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:29.360
but is the philosophy of medicine the same thing

64
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.660
as the philosophy of the sciences of health and

65
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.350
disease? And if not, why not?

66
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.100
Yes, it's a, yeah, that's a difficult question. I

67
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.660
think that. Traditionally people consider that philosophy of medicine

68
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.929
is a part of philosophy of science, and it's

69
00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.539
the part of philosophy of science that studies or

70
00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:55.490
investigates uh the sciences of health and disease, roughly

71
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.830
medical sciences, let's say. But the kind of approach,

72
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.990
the kind of methods that most philosophers, many, let's

73
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.550
say philosophers of medicine are taking tend to not

74
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.990
go very deep into scientific questions, just so it

75
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.869
makes a very striking contrast between philosophers of medicine

76
00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:21.144
on the one hand and say for instance. CLOSEST,

77
00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:25.503
um, colleagues, philosophers of biology. So philosophers of biology

78
00:04:25.843 --> 00:04:28.164
would have two traditions. They can see biology as

79
00:04:28.164 --> 00:04:31.044
a practice, but many of them also see or

80
00:04:31.044 --> 00:04:34.723
look into the theoretical foundations, for instance, of biology.

81
00:04:34.914 --> 00:04:37.164
But let's say, for instance, typically people that are

82
00:04:37.164 --> 00:04:40.553
studying uh the basis, uh, the basic concepts of,

83
00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:44.299
uh, of, um, evolutionary biology. Uh, YOU cannot, I

84
00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:46.059
mean, there's not a lot of people in philosophy

85
00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:48.260
of medicine that are doing that. So that, this

86
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.339
is why, I mean, probably other philosophers of science

87
00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:53.290
would say yes, it's a part of philosophy of

88
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.010
science, but not exactly or it's underdeveloped in that,

89
00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:00.420
in that regard or only in one direction, let's

90
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.940
say. Yeah.

91
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.170
So to get into the central topic of the

92
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.350
book, what is physiology and what distinguishes it from

93
00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:13.390
pathophysiology?

94
00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:16.970
Yes, I mean, to, in continuity with your previous

95
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.290
question, the, the, the goal of, of calling the

96
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.769
book philosophy of Physiology rather than, uh, something like

97
00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:26.730
basic concepts in philosophy of medicine or something is

98
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.359
precisely to emphasize that scientific part of medicine. So

99
00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:34.160
of course it doesn't say anything against the kind

100
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.399
of work that people would do on medicine as

101
00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:40.660
a practice, but it's also to help or suggest

102
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.359
that we can also develop this part that is

103
00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:46.119
more focused on the scientific part of of biomedical

104
00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:49.239
sciences. And the main science, the core science there,

105
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.200
if you look uh into this is or can

106
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.200
be called physiology. Physiology is much broader, of course,

107
00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:58.359
than medical science. There is, of course, physiological research

108
00:05:58.359 --> 00:06:01.799
on, for instance, how, uh, well, maybe we should

109
00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:04.359
start with a general definition, very simple one, physiology

110
00:06:04.359 --> 00:06:08.140
is the, the science of how organisms work. So

111
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.179
work is of course a very vague term, but

112
00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:12.649
it means it's exactly that. I mean, it's philosophers

113
00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:14.850
would say it's the study of the mechanisms of,

114
00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:17.899
uh, that you can find in organisms and uh

115
00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:20.970
so philosophy of physiology means that you're studying how

116
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.850
organisms work when it's human organisms and with a

117
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.820
focus on health and disease, it would be more

118
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.410
in the direction of philosophy of medicine. But if

119
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.809
you're interested in other questions that are maybe less

120
00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:34.529
related to health and disease or not related to

121
00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:37.489
human health and disease, for instance, it would probably

122
00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:39.970
not be considered philosophy of medicine. So it's in

123
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.250
continuity with a part of philosophy of biology. That's

124
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.329
the first part of my answer and the second

125
00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:47.850
one is there is a broad sense of physiology

126
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.720
that includes the study of health and disease. And

127
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.100
there is a more restricted sense where physiology is

128
00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:59.920
only the study of organisms in, let's say normal

129
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.019
conditions, which is of course a very vague term,

130
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.600
while pathop physiology is the specific study of organisms

131
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.720
in abnormal conditions when they have a disease typically.

132
00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:17.529
So what is then the philosophy of physiology? What

133
00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:22.489
distinguishes it exactly from the philosophy of medicine? And

134
00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:24.489
of course we're going to explore more of that,

135
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.890
but what are the central questions it deals with?

136
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.829
Yes, I would say, I mean, the, the proposal

137
00:07:32.829 --> 00:07:35.820
I'm making is to say, it starts, this is,

138
00:07:35.829 --> 00:07:37.390
I think more or less the way I wrote

139
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.649
it in the book, but it starts uh with

140
00:07:40.829 --> 00:07:46.290
um abandoning this assumption of uh foundationalism. If you

141
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.450
start considering that health and disease should be very

142
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.450
clearly defined and in a restrictive way for for

143
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.420
the sciences, meaning that OK, we have a concept

144
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.929
of disease and everything that doesn't fit in that

145
00:07:57.929 --> 00:08:00.690
concept shouldn't be considered a disease and therefore doctors

146
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.730
should not study it as a disease. That's the

147
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.149
way foundationalism works. If you abandon that view. Then

148
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:08.790
you, and you ask again the question, so what

149
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.869
is disease? Then the obvious question is, disease is

150
00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:19.950
what biologists, medical doctors, medical researchers are theorizing, conceptualizing

151
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.269
as a disease. So you would look into the

152
00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:26.054
sciences themselves. And try to see inductively, so to

153
00:08:26.054 --> 00:08:29.695
speak, try to see how they conceptualize health, how

154
00:08:29.695 --> 00:08:33.655
they conceptualize disease, rather than consider that they have

155
00:08:33.655 --> 00:08:35.924
once and for all a kind of common sense

156
00:08:35.924 --> 00:08:39.215
concept of health and disease that predetermines the way

157
00:08:39.215 --> 00:08:42.255
they, they conceive it. Uh, SO that's, I would

158
00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:44.974
say it starts with that. So philosophy of physiology

159
00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:49.054
starts with that question. How do they theorize health?

160
00:08:49.135 --> 00:08:51.005
How do they theorize disease?

161
00:08:52.109 --> 00:08:55.320
And is there a theory of disease and the

162
00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.359
science of health in physiology, not philosophy of physiology,

163
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.869
but physiology?

164
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.080
Yes, in physiology, so probably more than one at

165
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.559
the moment, and that's, that's likely to be the

166
00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:13.070
reason why many philosophers of medicine would be happy

167
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.820
to consider that there is no theory of health

168
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.520
or theory of disease in physiology, as you say,

169
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.359
as opposed. In philosophy of physiology or philosophy of

170
00:09:22.359 --> 00:09:24.989
medicine where everyone would say yes, there are theories,

171
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.219
for instance, Boor's theories of health or you know,

172
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.119
we, we, we use that kind of phrase, but

173
00:09:30.119 --> 00:09:32.580
as you say, they, uh, if you look into

174
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.690
physiology itself, uh, you will not find one theory.

175
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.380
You would not, you would find probably a dominant

176
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.500
one, which is probably less than a theory, which

177
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.260
is the concept of homeostasis. Probably we'll talk more

178
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.780
about that, but that's a really a cornerstone for

179
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.369
physiology. Historically speaking, it has been, and it's still

180
00:09:52.369 --> 00:09:55.280
something very powerful. If you ask any professor in

181
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.059
physiology what is the basic phenomenon of. Physiology they

182
00:09:59.059 --> 00:10:02.369
would tell you, well, obviously it's homeostasis, but homeostasis

183
00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:05.780
is also a vague term. It's difficult to say

184
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.020
exactly what it is, to define it very precisely,

185
00:10:09.219 --> 00:10:12.159
and generally it's not something that is very useful

186
00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:14.580
for physiologists. They don't need a general definition of

187
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.299
homeostasis. What they need more is to explain how

188
00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:21.640
homeostasis works in specific cases. Uh, SO this is,

189
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.330
yeah, roughly I would say, uh, there is, so

190
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.590
to summarize my answer, there is not one unitary

191
00:10:27.729 --> 00:10:31.159
theory, uh, not the equivalent, say, of, uh, of,

192
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.049
uh, the modern synthesis in evolutionary biology where you

193
00:10:34.049 --> 00:10:36.130
can start from, even if it's not final, even

194
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.210
if you can add many things or discuss many,

195
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:42.409
that, there's not like one obvious venue for physiology.

196
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.630
Uh, BUT there are many, as I was saying,

197
00:10:44.869 --> 00:10:47.549
uh, you would find, uh, many theories. So for

198
00:10:47.549 --> 00:10:49.789
instance, you can find, let's, let's take a very

199
00:10:49.789 --> 00:10:53.349
obvious example, a simple one. You can find something

200
00:10:53.349 --> 00:10:56.859
like a genetic theory of diseases. So, and this

201
00:10:56.859 --> 00:11:01.030
genetic theory of diseases is a kind of conceptualization

202
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.830
of disease in general, uh, and it's a, it's

203
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.950
a kind of open question to what extent can

204
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:12.940
we explain the pathological phenomenon. Meaning by that all

205
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.580
the diseases we know, uh, how much of that

206
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.979
can we explain from a genetic point of view,

207
00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:19.940
and that's the goal of a genetic theory of

208
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.700
disease to take just that example.

209
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.369
OK. And is there any list of criteria that

210
00:11:27.369 --> 00:11:31.770
cover all diseases? Is there anything that all of

211
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.530
them have in common?

212
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.950
Again, difficult question. If you ask that question that

213
00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.789
way, it's likely that you fall back into the

214
00:11:42.789 --> 00:11:48.000
way philosophy of medicine has traditionally dealt with that

215
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.789
question like is it anything common? So obviously you

216
00:11:50.789 --> 00:11:55.559
would say yes, it's uh. Probably harmful and then

217
00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:58.000
if you say, OK, what, what does harmful means

218
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.700
then we would say, yeah, this is judged harmful

219
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.200
by uh the, the, the, the sufferer of a

220
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.799
disease or a pathological condition. So we would have

221
00:12:06.799 --> 00:12:10.919
that kind of very general level um properties, but

222
00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:13.099
that's, but if you look into science, it's generally

223
00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:15.559
not the way it works. Except in very specialized

224
00:12:15.559 --> 00:12:18.919
areas of science where you can have a universal

225
00:12:18.919 --> 00:12:22.760
definition with necessary and sufficient conditions. In physics sometimes

226
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.640
you can have that, uh, but it's generally associated

227
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:31.719
with sciences where you can strongly stipulate deficiency. You

228
00:12:31.719 --> 00:12:34.320
can say for instance, you know, matter can be

229
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.669
defined. Like that energy is this, you know, entropy,

230
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.989
I would call entropy that. So you can have

231
00:12:40.989 --> 00:12:44.030
this kind of very powerful mathematical and so on,

232
00:12:44.349 --> 00:12:47.590
but this is very rare in biology, apart from

233
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.989
evolutionary biology where you can have that kind of

234
00:12:49.989 --> 00:12:52.469
approach to some extent. In many other areas of

235
00:12:52.469 --> 00:12:54.469
biology you cannot work that way because there are

236
00:12:54.469 --> 00:12:57.619
so many exceptions, so many difficulties, so many complexities,

237
00:12:57.869 --> 00:13:00.750
and so it's very difficult to have that kind

238
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.070
of approach and it's not the way it works.

239
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.419
Generally it works as a hypothesis. Exactly as I

240
00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:08.140
said, for instance, when you have the genetic, if

241
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.979
you take again the example of the genetic theory

242
00:13:09.979 --> 00:13:12.619
of disease or if you prefer the infectious theory

243
00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:15.530
of diseases, uh, people would start with the assumption,

244
00:13:15.869 --> 00:13:20.059
what if all diseases we know were explained by

245
00:13:20.059 --> 00:13:23.700
an infection? And so it looks like a hypothesis

246
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.659
and then you start saying, OK, there are many

247
00:13:25.659 --> 00:13:28.669
for which we're sure that that's the main explanation,

248
00:13:28.979 --> 00:13:31.200
and there are some for which we have strong

249
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.859
suspicions that it might be explained. And maybe there

250
00:13:33.859 --> 00:13:36.830
are some for which we have never explored that

251
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.469
hypothesis, and it might lead us to new discoveries.

252
00:13:40.669 --> 00:13:42.830
So that's more the way it works. So typically

253
00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.349
with the infectious theory of disease, as you, as

254
00:13:45.349 --> 00:13:48.390
you know, as many people know or are aware

255
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.909
of, there is an infectious hypothesis about the origin

256
00:13:51.909 --> 00:13:55.210
of, for instance, schizophrenia, schizophrenia. I'm not saying that

257
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.570
it's a strong theory, a strong hypothesis, but what

258
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.210
I'm saying is that this is exploratory and that's

259
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.590
the way theories work in physiology. They are hypothetical

260
00:14:03.929 --> 00:14:06.330
like in other fields of science. So that's the,

261
00:14:06.489 --> 00:14:08.650
it's more, it's not like it's something we can

262
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.789
know once and for all should be the case

263
00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:12.849
in every disease. It's more like we are hyper

264
00:14:12.849 --> 00:14:19.080
hyper uh supposing, uh, in fact that um. Perhaps

265
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.419
all diseases can be explained by this factor, knowing

266
00:14:22.419 --> 00:14:25.140
that it's unlikely but not knowing to what extent

267
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.239
it's uh it's true.

268
00:14:26.739 --> 00:14:32.260
Mhm. Is there a distinction between disease entities and

269
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.659
pathophysiological processes, because there are some people who tend

270
00:14:36.659 --> 00:14:41.179
to establish an identity relationship between the two, right?

271
00:14:41.419 --> 00:14:45.520
So, is there a distinction and what is their

272
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.099
relationship?

273
00:14:46.859 --> 00:14:51.210
Yeah, so, uh, in fact, it's these two concepts,

274
00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:53.460
uh, it's a good question because these two concepts

275
00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.380
overlap to some extent. I mean, it's like you

276
00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.770
can use, you can say, um, you can say,

277
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.210
for instance, let's take type 1 diabetes. Type one

278
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:08.020
diabetes is a neurological entity or disease entity, so

279
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.140
it means that it's a kind of label you

280
00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.179
would use in research and in particularly for diagnosis.

281
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.900
So you would say this person suffers from type

282
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.090
one diabetes. So that's the way, the way that

283
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.460
concept works. But when you say type one diabetes,

284
00:15:21.659 --> 00:15:24.099
sometimes you refer to a process, so something that

285
00:15:24.099 --> 00:15:26.900
is happening. In the body of, uh, of, uh,

286
00:15:26.909 --> 00:15:29.270
on the organism of those people, so in this

287
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.070
case that would be a kind of autoimmune process

288
00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.650
when the, the, the immune system of, uh, of,

289
00:15:34.659 --> 00:15:37.830
uh, the person with the disease would destroy uh

290
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.669
some cells in their pancreas, for instance. So, and

291
00:15:40.669 --> 00:15:42.739
it's much more complex than that, but that's just

292
00:15:42.739 --> 00:15:44.989
a small part of it. And uh, so your

293
00:15:44.989 --> 00:15:47.090
question is, what is the difference between the two?

294
00:15:47.169 --> 00:15:49.469
So first of all, it's a difference of point

295
00:15:49.469 --> 00:15:52.530
of view. So one point of view is simply

296
00:15:52.989 --> 00:15:55.030
the one you have when you diagnose. When you're

297
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.239
diagnose, you don't need to know. You don't always

298
00:15:57.239 --> 00:15:59.690
need to know all the details about the, the,

299
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.599
uh, the physiological or the pathophysiological process. When you're

300
00:16:03.599 --> 00:16:06.150
a researcher, on the other hand, you may not

301
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.909
need to know, for instance, all the symptoms that

302
00:16:08.909 --> 00:16:12.909
a doctor would use to diagnose a disease or

303
00:16:12.909 --> 00:16:15.349
you, Angelli, you know the, the disease entity, but

304
00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.349
you don't think that they are very important. What

305
00:16:17.349 --> 00:16:19.549
is important for you is the process at play.

306
00:16:19.909 --> 00:16:22.609
And then the second aspect and the second aspect

307
00:16:22.609 --> 00:16:25.510
of the um of your uh question I think

308
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.849
which is also important is that there are many

309
00:16:28.219 --> 00:16:32.500
pathophysiological processes that are shared among various disease entities.

310
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.049
It's not like it's a 1 to 1 correspondence.

311
00:16:35.469 --> 00:16:39.020
For instance, typically inflammation. IS a very general process

312
00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.700
that is involved in many diseases. It's not only

313
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.419
involving diseases, it's also involving non pathological conditions or

314
00:16:46.419 --> 00:16:49.239
states or processes, but it's a part of many

315
00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:53.260
diseases. So it's one physiological process and many disease

316
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:53.820
entities.

317
00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:01.989
Does anything unify the pathophysiology of all disease entities?

318
00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:07.199
I think that's probably for me the way I

319
00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:09.640
see it, it's the main question of philosophy of

320
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.239
physiology. It's at least not the one that philosophers

321
00:17:13.239 --> 00:17:16.118
of physiology may hope to solve one day, but

322
00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:18.780
that's one that can be very useful and powerful

323
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.069
to organize that field. So the way I would,

324
00:17:23.199 --> 00:17:25.719
I would approach that question, for instance, would be

325
00:17:25.719 --> 00:17:31.209
to go evolutionary. Meaning that if you investigate the

326
00:17:31.209 --> 00:17:34.479
question in the light of evolution. You can ask

327
00:17:34.479 --> 00:17:38.540
the questions, the question, what are the evolutionary conditions

328
00:17:39.079 --> 00:17:42.199
for diseases to appear and to remain and not

329
00:17:42.199 --> 00:17:44.839
to be eliminated by natural selection. So that's for

330
00:17:44.839 --> 00:17:47.359
me, that's one unifying question. What are the roots

331
00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:49.640
of diseases? What do, what explains the fact that

332
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.079
diseases are here, are, are very much shared across

333
00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:56.839
species for for many of them with variations from

334
00:17:56.839 --> 00:17:59.359
one species to another. So that, those are for

335
00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:01.160
me the main unifying questions.

336
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:07.810
What kinds of disease theories are there and how

337
00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:11.180
generalizable are disease theories?

338
00:18:11.719 --> 00:18:15.680
Yes, we, we mentioned two, I mentioned the genetic

339
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.290
theory of diseases and the infectious theory of diseases.

340
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.239
In the book I listed, uh, I think 9

341
00:18:22.239 --> 00:18:24.280
of them, just, but it's not, the idea is

342
00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.239
not to give, you know, a final list of

343
00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:30.359
these theories. It's just for the reader to be

344
00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.719
aware of the fact that they are not, let's

345
00:18:32.719 --> 00:18:36.119
say, hundreds of theories, but not just like 2

346
00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:38.599
or 3 of them either. So it's more like

347
00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:40.479
in the. Range of, uh, I don't know, about

348
00:18:40.479 --> 00:18:44.520
10 theories uh ongoing and I give examples in

349
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.880
the book of uh very short ones obviously of

350
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.719
some of them. So for instance, there is another

351
00:18:49.719 --> 00:18:52.699
one that, that you, you can call the guroscience

352
00:18:52.699 --> 00:18:57.040
theory of diseases or gerontological if you prefer. Um,

353
00:18:57.479 --> 00:19:01.439
THE idea is that um uh many diseases, maybe

354
00:19:01.439 --> 00:19:03.479
not all of them, but many of them can

355
00:19:03.479 --> 00:19:09.890
be considered to be, uh, let's say. Um, EXPLAINED

356
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.630
by aging. So you, you need a good definition,

357
00:19:13.689 --> 00:19:16.270
a good approach, good concept of aging, and you

358
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.369
can explain many diseases as effects of aging. So

359
00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:24.170
this sounds counterintuitive in the first place, uh, because

360
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:25.729
you, you would say, for instance, what about, I

361
00:19:25.729 --> 00:19:28.290
don't know, early onset cancer, for instance, is not,

362
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.209
uh, but the thing is that it depends of

363
00:19:30.209 --> 00:19:32.410
course on what you call aging, and aging is

364
00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.770
not a process that happens only in what we

365
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.209
call the aged, uh, so let's say I don't

366
00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:40.930
know, 45+ people or something. Uh, BUT it can

367
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:44.170
be understood as, for instance, a process that can

368
00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:48.689
be accelerated, uh, and start, starts only as, uh,

369
00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:51.479
uh, starts as early as when you're born or

370
00:19:51.479 --> 00:19:53.609
even of course before, and you can have a,

371
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.689
uh, for instance, accelerated, uh, process of, let's say

372
00:19:57.689 --> 00:20:01.329
degradation of some functions and, uh, so that explains

373
00:20:01.329 --> 00:20:04.579
how that, uh, theory can explain, let's say, or

374
00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:08.280
that shows how this theory could explain. Many diseases

375
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.609
and there are many more, but of course we

376
00:20:09.609 --> 00:20:10.750
won't go through all of them.

377
00:20:11.959 --> 00:20:13.800
Uh, IN the book you also talk about the

378
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:18.699
concept of pathological phenomenon. So what is the pathological

379
00:20:18.959 --> 00:20:19.920
phenomenon?

380
00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.410
Yes, I use that phrase, uh, because I think

381
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:27.530
it's useful to, for, especially I was, I had

382
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.969
it in mind, um, I mean, I, what I

383
00:20:30.969 --> 00:20:32.839
had in, what I have in mind when I'm

384
00:20:32.839 --> 00:20:36.300
using that phrase is the way philosophers of medicine

385
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.489
are approaching the, the question. And when you say,

386
00:20:39.609 --> 00:20:42.130
when you use that phrase, the pathological phenomenon, I

387
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:45.510
think it helps see that we are talking about

388
00:20:45.729 --> 00:20:49.329
uh a uh natural fact, something that you can

389
00:20:49.329 --> 00:20:52.849
observe. Something that is of course value laden, of

390
00:20:52.849 --> 00:20:57.329
course, uh determined by our preconceptions, common sense conceptions

391
00:20:57.329 --> 00:20:59.329
and the, and the way we see the world

392
00:20:59.329 --> 00:21:00.410
and what we want to do with it and

393
00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.670
all that, but also if you use that term.

394
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.949
It's very obvious, and I'm not the only one

395
00:21:05.949 --> 00:21:07.949
of course to propose that, so you have papers

396
00:21:07.949 --> 00:21:10.510
by Paul Griffith, for instance, typically that would propose

397
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.349
that kind of approach. Uh, IT'S obvious that you

398
00:21:13.349 --> 00:21:16.310
have diseases in plants. It's obvious that you have

399
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.869
diseases in insects, you have diseases in humans, of

400
00:21:18.869 --> 00:21:21.689
course, and uh, and many, I mean all living

401
00:21:22.709 --> 00:21:27.030
beings have diseases or are susceptible to, to, to,

402
00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:29.834
to. So this, this is the phrase I'm using

403
00:21:29.834 --> 00:21:33.795
to show that it's a fundamental property of organisms.

404
00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:39.114
It's a very powerful force in evolution and it's

405
00:21:39.114 --> 00:21:42.795
something that for that reason, for those reasons, would

406
00:21:42.795 --> 00:21:46.834
benefit from being theorized from the point of view

407
00:21:46.834 --> 00:21:49.545
of the natural science and not only as a

408
00:21:49.545 --> 00:21:51.875
as a concept of medical practice.

409
00:21:53.439 --> 00:21:56.739
And can we have a theory of the pathological

410
00:21:56.739 --> 00:21:58.599
phenomenon? Is that possible?

411
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.040
Yeah, I mean that's also a big question. As

412
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.969
I said, I think the main task for philosophers

413
00:22:05.969 --> 00:22:09.880
of physiology is to work in that direction, to

414
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.099
ask that question, can we, and I don't know.

415
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.660
For me, I don't know what I think is

416
00:22:16.349 --> 00:22:20.000
important to consider is that even if we don't.

417
00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.969
The very fact of asking questions like that is

418
00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:28.819
useful. We took one example with the infectious theory

419
00:22:28.819 --> 00:22:31.130
theory of disease. I don't believe, for instance, that

420
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.140
it's very likely that all diseases are explained by

421
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.300
infectious agents or by the process of infection. It

422
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.369
doesn't seem very plausible, does it? I mean, I

423
00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:42.780
mean, I think anyone would agree, or many at

424
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.790
least would agree with me. That said, If someone

425
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:51.229
says, huh, and what if this disease was explained

426
00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:55.089
by a bacterial infection, of course we would make,

427
00:22:55.229 --> 00:22:58.209
you know, it would be a huge leap in

428
00:22:58.209 --> 00:23:01.410
the research if it's true, if it's confirmed, of

429
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.489
course if it's not, it's maybe a loss of

430
00:23:03.489 --> 00:23:06.819
time and and research resources, but it's really important

431
00:23:06.819 --> 00:23:10.770
that researchers ask that question. And now comes the

432
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:14.530
second, which is more conceptual question. Suppose for one

433
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:19.599
second. That let's say 90% of diseases are shown

434
00:23:19.599 --> 00:23:23.939
to be infectious. In that case, the point for

435
00:23:23.939 --> 00:23:26.560
a philosopher of physiology would be to say, well,

436
00:23:26.939 --> 00:23:30.380
the concept of disease itself is an infectious concept,

437
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.339
and then you cannot say, you could still say,

438
00:23:33.459 --> 00:23:36.329
OK, for instance, as a, a normalivist philosopher of

439
00:23:36.329 --> 00:23:39.099
medicine would have it, they would say something like,

440
00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.000
OK, this is a harmful condition and all that.

441
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.810
Good, that's true, uh, that's for sure, but. If

442
00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.550
you had 90% of diseases that are in fact

443
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.439
proved to be uh that proved to be infectious,

444
00:23:53.199 --> 00:23:55.290
then you would have to define disease as an

445
00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:59.449
infectious process. And uh and that's something very important

446
00:23:59.449 --> 00:24:01.560
because it means that it's much more precise. The

447
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.250
concept is much more, you know, narrowly defined and

448
00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:09.030
uh and that would be a great, you know,

449
00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:13.800
great progress in physiological science. Unlikely again, very unlikely,

450
00:24:13.979 --> 00:24:17.729
but what we shouldn't consider is that disease entities

451
00:24:17.729 --> 00:24:22.729
are fixed, defined in isolation from one another and

452
00:24:22.729 --> 00:24:25.030
once and for all. This is not the way

453
00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:29.099
it works. It's the field is constantly um uh

454
00:24:29.099 --> 00:24:31.150
under the influence of people that are trying to

455
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.109
generalize, and when they do that, what they do

456
00:24:33.109 --> 00:24:36.469
in philosophical terms is theories. They propose theories of

457
00:24:36.469 --> 00:24:38.869
diseases. So that's the kind of things that I,

458
00:24:38.989 --> 00:24:41.229
I think or I suggest in the book that

459
00:24:41.229 --> 00:24:42.270
we should investigate.

460
00:24:43.699 --> 00:24:47.760
At a certain point in your book, you explore

461
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.300
a very interesting question. What do we gain by

462
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:56.040
asking why is the susceptibility to disease a universal

463
00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:01.540
and necessary characteristic of living beings instead of what

464
00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.339
do all diseases have in common?

465
00:25:04.119 --> 00:25:06.699
Yes, I mean, related, as I said, I mean,

466
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.469
it's not. That would be my proposal. I mean,

467
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.510
the way I see it, I think I'm sure

468
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.910
there are many other ways of uh unifying the

469
00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:18.069
field and, and investigating the theories. I think it's

470
00:25:18.069 --> 00:25:19.790
one for me that's the one that I find

471
00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.349
the most convincing, but, uh, I, I don't have

472
00:25:23.349 --> 00:25:25.359
any argument to say that it's the only one

473
00:25:25.359 --> 00:25:27.589
or whatever. That's not my point. Uh, SO I

474
00:25:27.589 --> 00:25:30.609
proposed it just as an illustration of, uh, uh,

475
00:25:30.619 --> 00:25:34.609
um, replacing this traditional question of philosophy of medicine

476
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:40.859
which again I. Its into a very, very narrow,

477
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.130
uh, and even I think a dead end, um,

478
00:25:43.209 --> 00:25:45.890
a very narrow venue for, for, for researchers in

479
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.449
philosophy because they would be stuck into this question,

480
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:50.410
is it, uh, you know, is it values, which

481
00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.569
values, you know, is it a natural fact, the

482
00:25:52.569 --> 00:25:55.719
kind of traditional, uh, debates in philosophy of medicine,

483
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:59.150
uh, whereas if you ask this different question. Then

484
00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.030
you can see that this question, what is disease

485
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:04.459
roughly can be asked in many different ways and

486
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:08.209
and some of them can be very very exciting

487
00:26:08.209 --> 00:26:11.069
to explore. So that's the main reason why I

488
00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:13.750
would, you know, propose that kind of reformulation of

489
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:18.189
the basic question for philosophy of physiology.

490
00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:22.800
That's very interesting. Uh, WHAT is the idea of

491
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.660
disease profiles?

492
00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.780
Yeah, so I propose also that term. I mean,

493
00:26:27.819 --> 00:26:29.819
it doesn't play a big role in the, in

494
00:26:29.819 --> 00:26:31.900
the book, but I again, I think it's a

495
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:36.599
nice illustration, um. Again, if you have, if I

496
00:26:36.599 --> 00:26:40.469
had in mind the kind of approach that normativist

497
00:26:40.469 --> 00:26:43.079
philosopher of medicine would have just to show them

498
00:26:43.079 --> 00:26:45.239
that there are also other aspects that are interesting

499
00:26:45.239 --> 00:26:48.680
in diseases, so the disease profile as I define

500
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.880
it can, can be, I mean, can relate to

501
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.040
many different features, but just to give you one

502
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.930
example. Some diseases have a a very typical epidemiological

503
00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.750
profile. So if we get back just to take

504
00:27:03.089 --> 00:27:07.500
again the example of age-related diseases. They have a

505
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.619
very, and you look at them at the level

506
00:27:09.619 --> 00:27:13.780
of populations, they have a very typical pattern. They

507
00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.060
would, meaning that their incidence, so the incidence is

508
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.540
the number of new cases of a disease in

509
00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.239
a population in a given amount of time, their

510
00:27:23.239 --> 00:27:28.079
incidence would increase exponentially with time. Up to a

511
00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:31.479
certain point and that's considered to be a very

512
00:27:31.479 --> 00:27:35.359
important defining feature for aging related diseases. Oh, it's

513
00:27:35.359 --> 00:27:37.719
a bit more complex than that, but roughly this

514
00:27:37.719 --> 00:27:40.319
is sufficient for to to see the kind of

515
00:27:40.319 --> 00:27:42.560
idea they are behind this idea of a disease

516
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.000
profile. So if you look into some diseases that

517
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.010
work like that, or typically when people think of

518
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.599
of contagious diseases, as you know, they have a.

519
00:27:51.319 --> 00:27:55.329
Again, very specific epidemiological pattern that would, you know,

520
00:27:55.729 --> 00:27:58.810
increase exponentially and then peak and then uh and

521
00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:02.050
then it would decrease very rapidly. So that's typical

522
00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.290
of of an epidemic. So that's the kind of

523
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.250
things I had in mind like, you know, broad

524
00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.530
patterns that you can use to study some specific

525
00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.010
features of uh of the various diseases we have.

526
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:16.619
So it would be like a pattern of diseases

527
00:28:16.619 --> 00:28:21.410
with uh I mean some of the parameters that

528
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:25.310
people take into account in public health and epidemi

529
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:29.310
in the epidemiology like prevalence incidence, average age of

530
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.050
onset, volatility and things like that.

531
00:28:32.689 --> 00:28:35.660
Typically, and I think we can also broaden the

532
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:39.180
concept beyond, so that's the example I gave, but

533
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:42.060
I think it's also, it can also be very

534
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:46.160
interesting to look into diseases in the guise of

535
00:28:46.859 --> 00:28:49.599
whether they are chronic or not, whether you know

536
00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.260
what is the pattern at the individual level. Do

537
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.339
they take a long time to develop or are

538
00:28:54.339 --> 00:28:57.849
they acute disease? So this is also the kind

539
00:28:57.849 --> 00:28:59.819
of feature you can have in mind when you're

540
00:29:00.209 --> 00:29:03.449
looking for disease profiles. They are typically diseases that

541
00:29:03.449 --> 00:29:07.130
would be chronic. Some of them would resolve, others

542
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:10.209
not, uh, you know, or, or frequently resolve, and

543
00:29:10.209 --> 00:29:14.449
others rarely resolve by themselves. So these are also

544
00:29:14.449 --> 00:29:16.890
features of what we can call disease profiles, and

545
00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:18.310
they are not really epidemiological.

546
00:29:19.459 --> 00:29:23.180
Mhm. So we've been focusing a lot on disease.

547
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.260
How about the theory of physiological health? Can we

548
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.719
also have that and what would be physiological health?

549
00:29:32.339 --> 00:29:35.650
Yes, that's, uh, so that's the, the last chapter

550
00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:38.339
of the, of, uh, of the book. Um, I

551
00:29:38.339 --> 00:29:40.300
tried to develop a little bit some ideas in

552
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.780
that, uh, in that, uh, direction, uh, but it's

553
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.530
just one chapter, uh, because I think, I mean,

554
00:29:46.859 --> 00:29:50.060
there, there is a recent trend in, uh, let's

555
00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.819
say physiological sciences in general, let's say, meaning, I

556
00:29:53.819 --> 00:29:57.890
mean, uh, study of, uh, of, uh, the, of,

557
00:29:57.979 --> 00:30:01.114
for instance, the, um. Nervous systems, the study of

558
00:30:01.114 --> 00:30:06.354
the immune system, the study of digestions, reproduction, and

559
00:30:06.354 --> 00:30:09.375
all that, all these fields that are collectively would

560
00:30:09.785 --> 00:30:14.265
collectively constitute physiology. There is a recent trend where

561
00:30:14.265 --> 00:30:19.435
people are starting to think of health in terms

562
00:30:19.435 --> 00:30:26.045
of specific dedicated processes rather than a kind of

563
00:30:26.045 --> 00:30:29.280
normal functioning. You know, like, it's the normal, uh,

564
00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.300
so generally, um, let's start with that idea. The

565
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.420
most intuitive idea you would find in philosophy of

566
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.180
medicine is to say that, uh, and probably the

567
00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.150
one that comes to, to mind immediately is to

568
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.949
say that health is simply, uh, normal functioning. So

569
00:30:41.949 --> 00:30:44.739
it's the normal level of functioning of some, of,

570
00:30:44.829 --> 00:30:47.750
you know, level, normal level of function, let's say,

571
00:30:47.829 --> 00:30:50.469
in, in general. In fact, some people start to

572
00:30:50.469 --> 00:30:53.489
say, yeah, well. Well, of course there is that

573
00:30:53.489 --> 00:30:55.609
meaning of, of health, but there is another one,

574
00:30:55.849 --> 00:30:58.329
which is to say that just like you have

575
00:30:58.329 --> 00:31:04.189
pathophysiological processes, you also have processes that are um.

576
00:31:05.699 --> 00:31:11.880
Let's say trying to uh. Correct the effects of

577
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.640
those or antagonize the effects of pathophysiological processes, and

578
00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.439
these you can call processes of health. So the

579
00:31:19.439 --> 00:31:22.079
idea is to study those processes. So just give

580
00:31:22.079 --> 00:31:25.719
you some very concrete examples, for instance, tissues would

581
00:31:25.719 --> 00:31:30.020
repair. They have mechanisms for repair, for instance, um,

582
00:31:30.469 --> 00:31:35.270
DNA has also many dedicated mechanisms to repair various

583
00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.530
damage, not all possible damage, obviously and not perfectly,

584
00:31:38.829 --> 00:31:41.270
but we have those mechanisms and some people would

585
00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:44.660
call them mechanisms of health. You know, so this,

586
00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.979
this is the idea that has emerged. So health

587
00:31:46.979 --> 00:31:49.760
is not, so of course health, health is still,

588
00:31:50.219 --> 00:31:52.859
uh, there still is a concept of health which

589
00:31:52.859 --> 00:31:54.939
is what are the norms of normality and all

590
00:31:54.939 --> 00:31:57.699
that, which is the very intuitive notion, but there

591
00:31:57.699 --> 00:32:00.515
is this emerging. The notion that it's also health

592
00:32:00.515 --> 00:32:03.954
can be also used as a generic term for

593
00:32:03.954 --> 00:32:08.635
specific mechanisms that would antagonize diseases or explain for

594
00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:13.395
instance longevity, that's meaning for instance exceptional longevity or

595
00:32:13.395 --> 00:32:14.194
that kind of thing.

596
00:32:15.729 --> 00:32:18.810
So let me ask you about homeostasis because that's

597
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:21.650
something that people in medicine tend to focus a

598
00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:25.729
lot about when it comes to health. Does homeostasis

599
00:32:25.729 --> 00:32:29.270
allow for us to understand the variability of health?

600
00:32:30.739 --> 00:32:33.739
Also a good question. I think homeostasis has been

601
00:32:33.739 --> 00:32:37.459
proposed first to precisely do the contrary, uh, explaining

602
00:32:37.459 --> 00:32:42.420
the invariability of health, uh, so across individuals, like

603
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.619
it's the same thing you would find everywhere and

604
00:32:44.619 --> 00:32:46.930
all that. The problem is that this concept itself

605
00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:50.390
is so flexible. That it can also allow for

606
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:53.510
uh to explain how for instance your health and

607
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.839
my health would be also different. Like for instance,

608
00:32:57.109 --> 00:32:59.599
we probably don't have exactly the same blood pressure

609
00:32:59.829 --> 00:33:01.489
and we are, and one of us, for instance

610
00:33:01.489 --> 00:33:03.829
is very healthy with their blood pressure while the

611
00:33:03.829 --> 00:33:07.140
other uh would be, uh, would have, you know,

612
00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.369
problems with uh that, that level of. Blood pressure,

613
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.520
for instance. So you have that kind of variability

614
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.880
across systems and um in a sense when you

615
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.040
have that concept, you don't explain much in the

616
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:23.719
variability that uh that is involved and that's, that's

617
00:33:23.719 --> 00:33:26.339
kind of the problem with the concept of homeostasis.

618
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.979
So that's why I think it's a good question

619
00:33:27.979 --> 00:33:30.319
to ask. Can you explain the variability? Yes, to

620
00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:33.400
some extent you can, uh, but it's also very

621
00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.439
limited because in a sense you can account for

622
00:33:36.439 --> 00:33:40.680
every situation as long as it's stable. So that's

623
00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.780
probably not, I mean, we probably need more.

624
00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:47.989
Mhm. So, another aspect that people tend to associate

625
00:33:47.989 --> 00:33:53.709
with homeostasis is the health of living organisms entirely

626
00:33:53.709 --> 00:33:56.030
accounted for by homeostasis.

627
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:02.670
Probably, well, it depends on how homeostasis is defined.

628
00:34:02.739 --> 00:34:05.670
So some people would say obviously no, and they

629
00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.709
would say no because they think that there are

630
00:34:07.709 --> 00:34:12.629
other phenomena that cannot be described as examples of

631
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:15.810
homeostasis. So that's typically the case for instance with

632
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:19.393
what some people have. Proposed to call allostasis, uh,

633
00:34:19.704 --> 00:34:23.743
so allostasis is the idea that the balance of

634
00:34:23.743 --> 00:34:27.842
an organism can move in time or can change

635
00:34:27.842 --> 00:34:30.674
in time. So that's a general definition of allostasis

636
00:34:31.063 --> 00:34:33.023
as opposed to homeostasis where it's supposed to be

637
00:34:33.023 --> 00:34:37.120
stable in time, uh, so always the same. And

638
00:34:37.478 --> 00:34:40.360
there are a lot of, uh, let's say um

639
00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.918
debates in that field because many defenders of the

640
00:34:43.918 --> 00:34:47.800
notion of homeostasis have said that in fact the

641
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.478
notion of homeostasis accounts for the variability of states

642
00:34:51.478 --> 00:34:53.958
in time for the same individual, uh, like your

643
00:34:53.958 --> 00:34:56.000
blood pressure is evolving in time, it would, it

644
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.820
would increase if you're running, for instance, for, for,

645
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:01.239
you know, your train or whatever and then it

646
00:35:01.239 --> 00:35:03.280
would decrease when you're sleeping and then, you know,

647
00:35:03.399 --> 00:35:06.760
so it's, it's, you know. So they would say

648
00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.040
we don't need another concept for that, but some

649
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:14.439
defendants of allostasis have proposed a much more specific

650
00:35:14.439 --> 00:35:17.199
notion of haostasis. For instance, some of them have

651
00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:24.040
proposed this idea that sometimes the organisms are changing

652
00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.580
their balance or the level, for instance, of homeostasis,

653
00:35:27.639 --> 00:35:31.439
so to speak, not in reaction to a change

654
00:35:31.439 --> 00:35:34.570
in the environment. But in reaction to a future

655
00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:37.659
change in the environment, like uh in anticipation of

656
00:35:37.659 --> 00:35:40.060
something, like for instance your blood pressure is increasing

657
00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.560
before you need uh to have more blood pressure,

658
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.260
for instance, to, to, to run, for instance, you

659
00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.100
know, that kind of of phenomena that involves some

660
00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.580
kind of cognitive aspect are sometimes called allostasis and

661
00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.179
you need that kind of concept if you want

662
00:35:53.179 --> 00:35:55.580
to uh account for the health of an organism.

663
00:35:55.739 --> 00:35:58.360
An organism that cannot do that would have problems

664
00:35:58.739 --> 00:36:00.300
and uh on the other hand you can say

665
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.939
it's perfectly homeostatic. So these are the kind of

666
00:36:03.939 --> 00:36:07.550
uh discussions that has been uh around uh, yeah,

667
00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:09.010
those questions.

668
00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:13.070
So I have just a couple of final questions

669
00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.810
and uh I'm going to read uh a couple

670
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.750
of quotes from your book and ask you to

671
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.989
comment on them. So toward the end of the

672
00:36:20.989 --> 00:36:25.010
book, you say that a quote. Health is indeed

673
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.570
a complex evolved trait, which makes it also an

674
00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:32.850
object of investigation for evolutionary biology and philosophy of

675
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:36.689
biology. So could you explain in what ways it

676
00:36:36.689 --> 00:36:40.370
is a complex evolved trait and how can it

677
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:43.489
be investigated by evolutionary biology?

678
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:47.439
Yes, so just to give you, let's, let's take

679
00:36:47.439 --> 00:36:50.570
one very, uh, like, yeah, let's make an analogy.

680
00:36:50.659 --> 00:36:53.139
For instance, you may be interested in the evolution

681
00:36:53.139 --> 00:36:55.620
of the feather just to take a very traditional

682
00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:59.939
example in evolutionary biology. So, uh, feather are used

683
00:36:59.939 --> 00:37:03.270
for thermal regulation, also flying and all that, and

684
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:07.120
then you can try to. Draw, sketch, let's say

685
00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.540
a history of the evolution of of having feathers.

686
00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:13.560
So that's one thing you can do across species,

687
00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:15.959
the species you have already, the species that have

688
00:37:15.959 --> 00:37:17.449
disappeared in the past and all that. You can

689
00:37:17.449 --> 00:37:20.280
do that. You can do the same kind of

690
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:25.790
investigations for traits like, for instance, air breathing. That

691
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:28.989
has been done, that you would say, OK, air

692
00:37:28.989 --> 00:37:32.709
breathing is something that appeared in probably, uh, let's

693
00:37:32.709 --> 00:37:34.229
say a long time ago, blah blah blah. You

694
00:37:34.229 --> 00:37:36.949
can say in which circumstances, maybe when you have

695
00:37:36.949 --> 00:37:40.179
oxygen in the atmosphere, which requires, you know, you

696
00:37:40.179 --> 00:37:42.350
will have a, you can do that. It's also

697
00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.669
speculative and you can do that. Well, you can

698
00:37:44.669 --> 00:37:48.199
also. It's also possible to do that, for instance,

699
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.010
for, let's say because I'm talking about air breathing.

700
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:54.010
This involves, for instance, the kind of mechanisms of

701
00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:58.010
health we were just mentioning that you need for

702
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.969
air breathing. So for instance, for instance, what would

703
00:37:59.969 --> 00:38:02.239
you do with the particles that you would breathe,

704
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:06.489
breathe when you are breathing air? You would have

705
00:38:06.489 --> 00:38:09.610
particles. You need to protect your tissues from those

706
00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:12.689
particles. And in fact there is, there are a

707
00:38:12.689 --> 00:38:15.129
lot of mechanisms that we know are helping for

708
00:38:15.129 --> 00:38:17.530
that. So for instance, mucus production, for instance, on

709
00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:21.010
your epithelium, there is a very sophisticated system of

710
00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.149
that when you have two layers of mucus that

711
00:38:23.149 --> 00:38:26.050
are not moving at the same speed, you have

712
00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.659
ciliarries on the on the surface of the cell

713
00:38:28.659 --> 00:38:31.610
that would, you know, create that flux in your,

714
00:38:31.629 --> 00:38:33.750
in your lung that would protect your lung. Then

715
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.689
there are also other mechanisms. You have more of

716
00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:38.850
them in the distal part of your lung than

717
00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:41.320
in the. PART of your lung because they are

718
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.590
not exposed to the same kind of particles. So

719
00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.780
there's a lot of things to say on this,

720
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:49.500
and these are simply mechanisms of resilience, um, yeah,

721
00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.459
let's say resilience, um, or health if you prefer,

722
00:38:52.679 --> 00:38:55.080
uh, of the lungs. So that's just one example

723
00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.879
that is, I think, very interesting, and that's, uh,

724
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.260
so I hope it helps to see more concretely

725
00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.270
what, what I mean by the evolution of complex

726
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:07.040
traits like resilience to air pollution, let's say, or

727
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:07.939
air particles.

728
00:39:09.169 --> 00:39:12.169
And finally, I would like to read you a

729
00:39:12.169 --> 00:39:16.370
quote where you highlight some of the differences between

730
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:19.409
philosophy of medicine and philosophy of physiology, and I

731
00:39:19.409 --> 00:39:21.909
would like to, to ask you then to comment

732
00:39:21.909 --> 00:39:25.850
on it. So in philosophy of medicine, the ultimate

733
00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:29.780
goal of the conceptual work on diseases, disease, or

734
00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:33.780
health has always been social and ethical. In the

735
00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:37.540
end, it is about judgments and actions. In philosophy

736
00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.979
of physiology, the goal of all conceptual work is

737
00:39:40.979 --> 00:39:45.219
to push further our understanding of the natural phenomena

738
00:39:45.219 --> 00:39:49.899
of health and diseases. So what is the main

739
00:39:49.899 --> 00:39:52.729
difference that you are highlighting there?

740
00:39:53.429 --> 00:39:55.909
As we said in the beginning, I think that

741
00:39:55.909 --> 00:39:59.020
in most, most, for the most part, philosophers of

742
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:04.290
medicine have historically investigated medicine as a practice. And

743
00:40:04.469 --> 00:40:06.350
so this is what I'm saying here in that

744
00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:10.370
sentence, uh, some major determinants of that practice are,

745
00:40:10.389 --> 00:40:13.100
for instance, values, the way we judge whether someone

746
00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.310
has a disease or whether what they have, it

747
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:17.949
should not be considered, uh, as a disease and

748
00:40:17.949 --> 00:40:20.489
all that. On the other hand, if you, if,

749
00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:23.419
I mean, if medicine was only based on that,

750
00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:27.610
we would lose something which is the, the exactly

751
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:30.090
all the things we have discussed uh in, in

752
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:33.250
our, in our interview, um, all these things would

753
00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:36.090
be missed. We need also this theoretical part, the

754
00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:39.659
part where you're starting to try to generalize, uh,

755
00:40:39.689 --> 00:40:43.010
you know, understand what is common to many diseases,

756
00:40:43.129 --> 00:40:45.610
maybe all of them, you know, all these things

757
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:49.389
like. Is inflammation, for instance, is inflammation something major

758
00:40:49.389 --> 00:40:51.629
if you want to understand diseases? Is it involved

759
00:40:51.629 --> 00:40:53.909
in all diseases, by the way? Maybe it is.

760
00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:56.989
So maybe it's so important to understand diseases that

761
00:40:56.989 --> 00:40:59.830
diseases, in fact, the very definition of disease should

762
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:03.709
include, for instance, the possibility of inflammation, for instance.

763
00:41:03.989 --> 00:41:06.270
You see, so those are the kinds of questions

764
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:10.830
that are of major interest to researchers in those

765
00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:13.179
in that field. So it's really important for the

766
00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:16.209
science. And I think it's also very important for

767
00:41:16.209 --> 00:41:20.570
philosophers who are interested in the theoretical aspects of

768
00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:23.129
those uh sciences. So that's the main difference, the

769
00:41:23.129 --> 00:41:26.060
main contrast I would say. So it's perfectly possible

770
00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:29.570
that they, you know, coexist peacefully. It's just different

771
00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:32.010
approaches. So, and the main trait is to say

772
00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:34.709
that one is based on the practice of medicine

773
00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:36.629
while the other one is based on the science

774
00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:40.489
of, uh, medicine, let's say medical sciences or biomedical

775
00:41:40.489 --> 00:41:40.889
sciences.

776
00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:45.800
Mhm. Great. So the book is again Philosophy of

777
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.600
Physiology. I will be leaving a link to it

778
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:52.260
in the description of the interview. And Doctor Lewan,

779
00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:55.000
uh, just before we go, apart from the book,

780
00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:57.800
would you like to tell people where they can

781
00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.919
find your work on the internet?

782
00:42:00.879 --> 00:42:03.520
Yes, I mean, you can go on the website

783
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.360
of our team, so it's called Immunoconcept. I think

784
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.760
if you look into that, you, you will find

785
00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.600
our team and my personal page is there with

786
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.800
my recent publications and research programs.

787
00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:19.030
Great. So, uh, look, I, I really love the

788
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:22.469
interview. I would recommend your book to everyone interested

789
00:42:22.469 --> 00:42:26.629
in questions surrounding medicine and particularly what is disease

790
00:42:26.629 --> 00:42:29.159
and what is health. It's a very interesting read.

791
00:42:29.229 --> 00:42:31.350
So thank you so much for coming on the

792
00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:32.310
