00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.039
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:05.639
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops and

3
00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:09.560
today I'm joined by Nandita Bajaj. She's the executive

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.079
director of Population Balance, a US nonprofit that works

5
00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:17.280
to inspire narrative, behavioral and system change that shrinks

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.299
our human impact and elevates the rights and well-being

7
00:00:20.299 --> 00:00:23.790
of people, animals, and the planet. She co-hosts the

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.270
overpopulation podcast and she's Also a senior lecturer at

9
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.509
the Institute for Human Education at Antioch University, where

10
00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.830
she teaches about the combined impacts of pro-natalism and

11
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:42.259
human expansionism on reproductive ecological and intergenerational justice. So,

12
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.869
today we're going to talk about overpopulation, birth rates,

13
00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:50.349
pro-natalism, abortion, and related topics. So, Nandita, welcome to

14
00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:51.750
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.840
Ricardo, thank you so much for having me. It's

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.029
my pleasure to be here.

17
00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:59.529
So let me start by asking you, how do

18
00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:03.569
we determine, first of all, where there is, whether

19
00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:06.970
there is overpopulation or underpopulation?

20
00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:12.709
Yes, um, that is a large question, so I

21
00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:16.699
will give a little bit of background, historical background,

22
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.540
specifically about the human species. Um, SO, every species,

23
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.589
uh, and we are one of the many The

24
00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:29.690
species has a carrying capacity, which is an ecological

25
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.870
term that describes the maximum number of a population

26
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.720
that a habitat can support without becoming irreversibly degraded

27
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.629
and um able to sustain a population um indefinitely.

28
00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:51.790
And so human beings, uh, we have been around

29
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.800
in the form of Homo sapiens for about 250

30
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.800
to 300,000 years. So we've been around for a

31
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.279
really long time and for most of our history,

32
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.119
so 99.9% of our history, we existed at a

33
00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.970
population that was below 1 million. So I live

34
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.089
in Toronto in Canada, and the population of Toronto

35
00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:21.320
is 3 million. So imagine the entire global population

36
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.759
of human beings less than 1 million for most

37
00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:29.470
of our history. And during that time, we lived

38
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.770
in relative balance with the rest of life on

39
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.990
Earth and to give you uh a proportional idea.

40
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.389
We represented 1% of the weight of all of

41
00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:48.070
the mammals, and 99% of the rest of the

42
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.750
weight was wildlife. So we were 1%, 99% was

43
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.949
wild. So we were one of the many species

44
00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:01.110
living in relative balance with life on Earth, and

45
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.630
that was when we were living as gatherers and

46
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.910
hunters. Um, THIS is, you know, before the last

47
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.619
ice age, and before we started engaging in, um,

48
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.070
domestication of animals and plants. And so, over the

49
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.389
last 10,000 years, but really over the last couple

50
00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:28.960
of 100 years, our population has skyrocketed, unlike any

51
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.679
other species on the planet, and we have single-handedly

52
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.639
created so much degradation on Earth that we find

53
00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:45.160
ourselves in the midst of multiple reinforcing. Uh, CRISES,

54
00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.759
and you can see the climate emergency is one

55
00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:52.380
of them, the mass extinction event, the toxification of

56
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.750
air, land, and water, and uh the resource scarcity

57
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.270
that we are seeing. And so, the combination of

58
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.990
those forces is called ecological overshoot, in that we

59
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.080
are demanding 75% more from Earth than is sustainable.

60
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.540
And so you can see that single-handedly, one species

61
00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.170
um has really colonized the rest of the planet

62
00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:29.649
at the expense of most other nature, non-human species,

63
00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:33.869
and also at our own peril. Like we also

64
00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:37.459
face our own extinction in, in the long term,

65
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.859
just given that we are, we have degraded the

66
00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:44.890
very biophysical basis of our existence. So to come

67
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.369
back to your question, um, the carrying capacity for

68
00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:54.010
human beings has been calculated by a number of

69
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.230
different ecologists using a number of different methods, but

70
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.410
the range of human population that is considered to

71
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.309
be sustainable goes from anywhere in the hundreds of

72
00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:13.380
millions, the total global population to 3 billion. And

73
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.380
that keeps in mind the integrity of the biosphere.

74
00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:22.140
So we are not the only species, um, we,

75
00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:25.750
um, are more in balance with the rest of

76
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.950
nature in that way and that we can sustain

77
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.149
our population at that level for hundreds of thousands

78
00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:37.260
of more years. Um, SO from that perspective, a

79
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.079
population of 8 billion is considered to be Much

80
00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:44.399
higher than what is sustainable and we don't need

81
00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:47.640
to, we don't need numbers to know that. We

82
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.880
kind of see it all around us, right? We

83
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.410
are on a very destructive path, uh, where, uh,

84
00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:56.959
you know, most of the other species, but also

85
00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:02.309
we ourselves face, uh, the possibility of, of annihilation

86
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:03.269
and collapse.

87
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.529
But do we have a good idea of what

88
00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.329
are the main factors that drive birth rates and

89
00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:15.250
the growth or reduction of population sizes?

90
00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:23.019
Yes, so, in nature, uh, there are positive and

91
00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:27.570
negative feedback loops that kind of keep populations in

92
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.529
check. And, you know, like all other species, our

93
00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:36.609
species also has the potential to grow exponentially and

94
00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:42.670
to overshoot our carrying capacity. Um, BUT for millennia,

95
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.589
for hundreds of thousands of years, our population has

96
00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:49.019
been kept in check through negative feedbacks in nature,

97
00:06:49.549 --> 00:06:54.019
uh, whether it's through disease, through food scarcity, famine,

98
00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:00.040
droughts, or war and conflict. But um it's really

99
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.470
only in the last couple of 100 years that

100
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.339
we've seen such an explosion in our population. So,

101
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.070
like I said, you know, for 250 to 300,000

102
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.829
years, we were such a small number in our

103
00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:18.109
population, and then it took us all that time

104
00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:22.119
to get to the first billion in about 1800.

105
00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:25.709
And then in the last 200 years, we went

106
00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:30.829
from 1 billion to 8 billion. Just an eightfold

107
00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:35.850
increase. And at the heart of that um was

108
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:41.440
of course availability of abundant cheap fossil fuel energy

109
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.149
that allowed us to expand exponentially both in technology

110
00:07:46.369 --> 00:07:51.380
and our consumption in addition to our population. Um,

111
00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:55.339
BUT to come back specifically to your question of

112
00:07:55.339 --> 00:08:00.309
what drives birth rates and what drives population growth,

113
00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:07.779
is birth rates are driven primarily through, um, One

114
00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:10.540
of the things that I study is pro-natalism, so

115
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.579
pushing people to have lots of children, and one

116
00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:18.420
of the ways um society has done that is

117
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.420
by encouraging early childbirth. So the earlier a girl

118
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.890
or a woman begins to have children, the longer

119
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.859
uh time she has to have children, so the

120
00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:33.030
more children she can have. And then also the

121
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:38.760
spacing of births. So how far apart each birth

122
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.440
is determines how many children a woman may have,

123
00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:47.809
um, but also things like Um, in terms of

124
00:08:47.809 --> 00:08:52.210
death rates, things like disease and famine, etc. WILL

125
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:56.530
keep that population in check, and sometimes even poor,

126
00:08:56.849 --> 00:09:03.539
um, medicine or sanitation would create High infant mortality,

127
00:09:03.619 --> 00:09:06.669
so not a lot of children would survive. And

128
00:09:06.669 --> 00:09:12.250
so, with the advances in technology combined with pro-natalism,

129
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.289
uh, the push to have more children, to grow

130
00:09:15.289 --> 00:09:20.650
populations, you see. You know, birth rates increasing, and

131
00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.809
then the other aspect of population growth is people

132
00:09:23.809 --> 00:09:29.049
simply living longer. So, um, in the past, you

133
00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:31.729
know, even a few 100 years ago, humans would

134
00:09:31.729 --> 00:09:35.830
only live to about 30 to 40 years. In

135
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.289
terms of life expectancy. And now we're living longer

136
00:09:40.289 --> 00:09:43.729
to 70 to 80 years, so then there's just

137
00:09:43.729 --> 00:09:48.299
people alive for longer, and we're adding more birds,

138
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.570
which then leads to growth in population.

139
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:58.140
Mhm. So is childlessness specifically a cause of declining

140
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.460
fertility rates? Has there been any explosion of childless,

141
00:10:03.859 --> 00:10:06.780
childlessness anywhere, as some people claim?

142
00:10:08.119 --> 00:10:12.760
Um, NO, so, um, I'll first tell you that,

143
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:17.169
you know, over the last 60, 70 years since

144
00:10:17.169 --> 00:10:21.849
we first became aware that we had shot the

145
00:10:21.849 --> 00:10:24.559
carrying capacity of our planet and that we were

146
00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:31.570
in overshoot, there was great awareness, um, that society

147
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:35.619
had, cultures had that we had. Um, BECOME too

148
00:10:35.619 --> 00:10:41.020
many people consuming too much and there was the

149
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.669
limits to growth study that came out of the

150
00:10:43.669 --> 00:10:46.619
Club of Rome that was warning that if we

151
00:10:46.619 --> 00:10:51.409
stayed on this path with um such huge population,

152
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.049
such great uh amounts of production, and such great

153
00:10:56.049 --> 00:11:00.260
amounts of consumption that we would be on a

154
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.340
path of self-destruction and destruction of the biosphere. And

155
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.580
that came out You know, that came out in

156
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:13.770
the 1970s, 1972, I believe, and That's, you know,

157
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.590
now looking at it 50 something years later, we

158
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.330
are on track to a lot of the predictions

159
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.750
that were made in that report, but around that

160
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.869
time, there were also because of the awareness around

161
00:11:26.869 --> 00:11:30.469
overpopulation, uh there were a lot of policies that

162
00:11:30.469 --> 00:11:36.299
were put into place to encourage greater reproductive autonomy

163
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:41.200
and reduction in population rates. Um, SOME of the

164
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.520
population policies were horrible that actually were quite coercive

165
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.280
and egregious, like China's one-child policy and for forced

166
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.940
sterilization campaigns in Puerto Rico, in India. And you

167
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.059
know, some other coercive policies within Europe and in

168
00:12:02.059 --> 00:12:05.859
the US, but majority of the policies that governments

169
00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:11.780
put into place were actually empowering policies that uh

170
00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:17.700
implemented educational opportunities for girls, ensuring that girls were

171
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.460
going to school, completing secondary education, that they weren't

172
00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.640
being married as children. And that women generally had

173
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.640
access to contraceptives and ability to make decisions about

174
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.229
what, how many children they want if they want

175
00:12:35.229 --> 00:12:38.599
them and so what we've seen is a really

176
00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:41.950
amazing trend over the last 50 to 60 years

177
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.559
directly as a result of some of these empowering

178
00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:49.530
policies is a decline in fertility rates around the

179
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.219
world. So, over 2/3 of the countries in the

180
00:12:53.219 --> 00:12:58.859
world have now declining fertility rates, where people, individuals

181
00:12:58.859 --> 00:13:02.919
and couples are choosing to have fewer children, and

182
00:13:02.919 --> 00:13:06.265
they're having children later in life. So instead of

183
00:13:06.265 --> 00:13:10.335
having children as teenagers or in their twenties, women

184
00:13:10.335 --> 00:13:15.465
are now delaying childbirth and having children later in

185
00:13:15.465 --> 00:13:17.984
life and also just fewer children, and some of

186
00:13:17.984 --> 00:13:21.799
them aren't having any children at all. And so

187
00:13:23.049 --> 00:13:26.159
There is a lot of alarmism right now, especially

188
00:13:26.159 --> 00:13:31.750
um among right-wing nationalists that there is some kind

189
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.650
of an explosion in the, in childlessness or that

190
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.859
women aren't having any children at all. That is

191
00:13:39.859 --> 00:13:43.679
not what the evidence shows. The demographic evidence throughout

192
00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:47.119
the different countries shows that the number of children

193
00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:51.219
people are having has declined from, say, 4 child

194
00:13:51.219 --> 00:13:55.210
families to 22 child families or one child families.

195
00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.140
And in some countries, yes, there are more people

196
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.260
who are choosing to have no children at all.

197
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.500
But there is no evidence that shows that declining

198
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.520
fertility rates are a result of some kind of

199
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.890
an explosion in childlessness.

200
00:14:12.349 --> 00:14:17.969
So what is pro-natalism and what arguments do pro-natalists

201
00:14:17.969 --> 00:14:18.900
tend to use?

202
00:14:20.469 --> 00:14:27.260
Right. So, pro-natalism is very simply an ideology that

203
00:14:27.549 --> 00:14:33.549
promotes childbirth. So it's a combination of societal and

204
00:14:33.549 --> 00:14:37.719
institutional pressures that are placed on people, primarily women

205
00:14:38.109 --> 00:14:44.409
to have children. And pro-natalism is everywhere. It's, you

206
00:14:44.409 --> 00:14:48.450
know, the water that we're swimming in, the culture

207
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:53.250
that we live in promotes pro-natalism. Our families pressure

208
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.330
us into having children, whether it's to carry on

209
00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.330
the family name, whether it's to carry on a

210
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.770
tradition, um, or to take care of us when

211
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.099
we get old, right? So family pressures are huge.

212
00:15:07.549 --> 00:15:12.429
But then also, there are pressures from religions, religious

213
00:15:12.429 --> 00:15:17.080
leaders want more followers. They want to grow their

214
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:24.030
religious strength, so they promote childbearing by um promoting

215
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:29.969
marriage, by uh banning or, you know, scoffing at

216
00:15:29.969 --> 00:15:35.530
using contraceptives uh or getting abortions. Um, AND then

217
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:41.159
there's also political pressures or economic pressures from governments

218
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:48.520
that promote childbearing through incentives for having large families.

219
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:53.280
Uh, THEY are looking for more taxpayers, more, uh,

220
00:15:53.289 --> 00:15:59.460
consumers, and a larger military. So, pro-natalism really is

221
00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.599
everywhere, but it's not something that has always existed.

222
00:16:04.169 --> 00:16:07.419
It's, um, it's an idea that's about as old

223
00:16:07.419 --> 00:16:13.580
as patriarchy, which is about 5000 years old, and

224
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:18.650
it's really when it started becoming institutionalized when Uh,

225
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.309
empires and states were being formed with the rise

226
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:27.359
in civilizations, and elites and the leaders were looking

227
00:16:27.359 --> 00:16:30.690
to grow the populations of their states, uh, so

228
00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.130
that they could be stronger than the other states

229
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:39.549
or other tribes. And so, one way of growing

230
00:16:39.549 --> 00:16:45.760
population is by really segregating the genders and creating

231
00:16:45.929 --> 00:16:49.059
a tremendous amount of pressure on young women to

232
00:16:49.059 --> 00:16:53.049
produce lots of children, but then also a tremendous

233
00:16:53.049 --> 00:16:55.929
amount of pressure on young men to protect the

234
00:16:55.929 --> 00:17:00.840
state by becoming soldiers. And so both the military

235
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:06.750
and pro-natalism Kind of emerged in an institutionalized manner

236
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:11.069
with the rise of patriarchy about 5000 years ago

237
00:17:11.348 --> 00:17:16.630
and now through millennia of policies and rhetoric and

238
00:17:17.358 --> 00:17:23.000
education, um, it has become um deeply internalized in

239
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.760
culture so much that we don't even see it

240
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.750
as, you know, some kind of Um, an ideology.

241
00:17:29.829 --> 00:17:32.270
A lot of people just think it's completely natural

242
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.650
and normal and necessary for everyone to have children.

243
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:41.699
So does this also link then to reproductive rights,

244
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.260
particularly for women.

245
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:51.130
Definitely, um, pro-natalism by its nature, because it pushes

246
00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.819
women to bear children regardless of what it is

247
00:17:54.819 --> 00:18:00.819
that they might want, is undermining reproductive rights and

248
00:18:00.819 --> 00:18:07.849
reproductive autonomy. Because you can see that when women

249
00:18:07.849 --> 00:18:13.219
have the choice and autonomy to decide, um if

250
00:18:13.219 --> 00:18:15.339
they want to have children and how many children

251
00:18:15.339 --> 00:18:20.449
they want to have, fertility rates decline everywhere because

252
00:18:20.709 --> 00:18:26.609
naturally and normally even prehistory, uh, women were having

253
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.739
far fewer children than we have seen in the

254
00:18:30.739 --> 00:18:35.349
last 200 years. So, even in the last few

255
00:18:35.349 --> 00:18:40.430
1000 years, but definitely, uh, with the rise in

256
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.109
the industrial revolution, we've just seen population grow so

257
00:18:44.109 --> 00:18:49.229
quickly. Um, SO, it's directly tied to reproductive rights.

258
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:54.630
You, one would need to undermine reproductive autonomy in

259
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.630
order to ensure that women continue to bear the

260
00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:01.300
number of children. You would like them to have

261
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.819
rather than what they would want to have naturally.

262
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.229
So do you think that this is really about

263
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.000
people worrying about population collapse, or do you think

264
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.709
that when it comes to pro-natalists and some right

265
00:19:15.709 --> 00:19:19.359
wing ideologues that tend to associate with them, it

266
00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:23.920
is more about pushing for conservative values, control over

267
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.040
women's reproduction and stuff like that.

268
00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:32.859
Definitely, I think pro-natalism is very much intertwined with

269
00:19:32.859 --> 00:19:39.420
patriarchal social norms. It's very much about having control

270
00:19:39.589 --> 00:19:45.109
over women's reproduction. Um, AS I, um, said before,

271
00:19:45.339 --> 00:19:47.819
there have been a number of historians who have

272
00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:53.650
looked at anthropological studies to see that, you know,

273
00:19:53.819 --> 00:19:56.099
in our history, there have been so many different

274
00:19:56.099 --> 00:20:01.260
arrangements of humans thriving. So it's not always been

275
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:07.609
this traditional model of marriage and children. And so,

276
00:20:08.209 --> 00:20:11.089
There have been many different ways in which humans

277
00:20:11.089 --> 00:20:15.770
have lived, have had children, ah, not always lived

278
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.880
together. There have been kind of more matriarchal societies

279
00:20:20.569 --> 00:20:27.250
and patriarchal types of societies, um, and eventually I

280
00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.130
think patriarchal norms ended up becoming the dominant type

281
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:37.939
of norms, primarily because population growth depends on Uh,

282
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:43.449
keeping women subservient or having control over women's bodies,

283
00:20:43.979 --> 00:20:47.089
because if women were truly allowed to be independent

284
00:20:47.089 --> 00:20:49.819
as they are in so many countries around the

285
00:20:49.819 --> 00:20:53.010
world now, you see that they are not having

286
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.540
a large number of children. They are doing other

287
00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.130
things in life, they are, some are not even

288
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:03.800
marrying. Um, SO, women are more interested in pursuing

289
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:08.380
other life paths, including self-actualization, just like men have

290
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:13.010
done for millennia, and as should be the case,

291
00:21:13.979 --> 00:21:19.599
but because Fertility rates are declining, and I must

292
00:21:19.599 --> 00:21:23.599
say that population is not declining, right? Population is

293
00:21:23.599 --> 00:21:29.150
still increasing. We're at 8 billion today, and according

294
00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.520
to the United Nations projections, we're expected to add

295
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:37.260
another 2.5 billion people before the end of the

296
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.089
century. So we're expected to go to 10.5 to

297
00:21:41.089 --> 00:21:46.589
11 billion. So population is nowhere to near collapsing.

298
00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.859
So number one, the term is, uh, you know,

299
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.569
a form of disinformation. It's trying to create alarmism.

300
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.579
Um, BUT also to come back to what you

301
00:21:59.579 --> 00:22:02.969
were saying, it's very much about promoting a very

302
00:22:02.969 --> 00:22:09.900
conservative kind of right-wing ideology of marriage, childbirth, conservative

303
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.619
traditional type of family structures where men have the

304
00:22:14.619 --> 00:22:20.380
power, women, women's primarily role, primary role is to

305
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:25.410
have babies. And it's one way to ensure that

306
00:22:25.689 --> 00:22:29.900
that model survives is, is through that kind of

307
00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.660
patriarchal norm, um, so that population can continue to

308
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.939
grow. And so you are seeing a rise in

309
00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:43.819
much more conservatism around the world, especially as you've

310
00:22:43.819 --> 00:22:48.660
seen with the turn to right-wing Christian nationalism even

311
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.040
in the United States and other countries. Much of

312
00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.579
it is related to. More egalitarianism, like there is

313
00:22:58.579 --> 00:23:02.160
just greater gender equality that has happened over the

314
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.489
last many decades, and that gender equality. IS seen

315
00:23:07.489 --> 00:23:10.630
as a threat by some of the very powerful

316
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:16.229
leaders who want to ensure that the fertility decline

317
00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:20.510
that follows gender equality doesn't continue this way.

318
00:23:21.459 --> 00:23:27.390
Mhm. And how do questions surrounding population link to

319
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.989
topics like environmentalism and climate change?

320
00:23:32.329 --> 00:23:38.810
Sure. So, population growth combined with our growth in

321
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.689
consumption, combined with the growth in production of all

322
00:23:42.689 --> 00:23:47.160
the waste, uh, in the form of emissions and

323
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:53.540
pollution are directly related to environmental issues, one of

324
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:58.469
which is climate change. So, In the last 200

325
00:23:58.469 --> 00:24:05.469
years, um, once we discovered fossil fuels and started

326
00:24:05.469 --> 00:24:10.380
using abundant cheap energy, our population, of course, grew

327
00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.949
by a factor of 8 from a billion to

328
00:24:12.949 --> 00:24:17.949
8 billion, but our GDP growth and our consumption

329
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:22.369
increased by a factor of 100, right? So we

330
00:24:22.369 --> 00:24:25.630
were not only so many people, but also consuming

331
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:29.619
a lot. And our fossil fuel use increased by

332
00:24:29.619 --> 00:24:33.540
a factor of 1000 just in the last 200

333
00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:38.869
years. So, as a direct result of there being

334
00:24:38.869 --> 00:24:43.819
so many people consuming so much, even though the

335
00:24:43.819 --> 00:24:49.530
population growth and the distribution in consumption has been

336
00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:56.660
inequitable, right? There are, um, majority of the Emissions

337
00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.099
if you were to see, look at emissions or

338
00:24:59.099 --> 00:25:04.060
even consumption around the world has come from a

339
00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:08.010
very small population, you know, 18% of the population.

340
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.339
So like I think something like 75% to 80%

341
00:25:11.339 --> 00:25:16.140
of the energy used directly through hyper consumerism has

342
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:22.430
come from a very small rich elite population. Mostly

343
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:27.479
in the global north and western countries, um, but

344
00:25:27.479 --> 00:25:33.459
regardless of that, there has been, um, also more

345
00:25:33.459 --> 00:25:39.310
recently a growth in the number of people aspiring

346
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:43.280
to these types of ideals who want to actually

347
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.160
grow their own consumption patterns because majority of the

348
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.760
people, like 75% of the people live in the

349
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:55.609
global South. Many of those people live below what's

350
00:25:55.609 --> 00:25:59.089
considered a sy, you know, a, a healthy standard

351
00:25:59.089 --> 00:26:01.729
of living. So they live, many people live in

352
00:26:01.729 --> 00:26:07.290
absolute poverty, um, and wish to and deserve to

353
00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:10.329
grow their standard of living and increase their consumption.

354
00:26:11.239 --> 00:26:15.180
So That has been happening a lot as well,

355
00:26:15.219 --> 00:26:17.939
because a large number of people who are increasing

356
00:26:17.939 --> 00:26:22.420
their consumption, even by a small amount, multiplies that

357
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.959
and increases the emissions and the energy use significantly.

358
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.619
So, climate change is one aspect of that where

359
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.910
a combination of population and consumption has directly caused

360
00:26:40.359 --> 00:26:44.520
climate emissions. Uh, WE are seeing huge amounts of

361
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.920
biodiversity loss, uh, which is directly related again to

362
00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:54.439
our consumption patterns, mostly related to our industrial food

363
00:26:54.439 --> 00:26:58.770
production. Um, SO I'll give you some statistics, you

364
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:02.959
know, almost half of the habitable land on Earth

365
00:27:02.959 --> 00:27:07.530
is used for industrial agriculture to grow food for

366
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:12.989
humans. And that is habitat that belongs to other

367
00:27:12.989 --> 00:27:16.150
species who have every right to be here just

368
00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:20.280
as we do. And so, what's happened is a

369
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.920
lot of those species have been moved away from

370
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.430
their land, and then a lot of animals who

371
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:32.239
are considered a threat to agricultural land are killed

372
00:27:32.239 --> 00:27:37.510
off. So what we are seeing is a decline

373
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:42.780
in biodiversity and a decline in wild populations, both

374
00:27:42.989 --> 00:27:49.400
on land and in freshwater. Mainly because of industrial

375
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.680
agriculture that uses a ton of land, but also

376
00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.199
70% of the fresh water. So you can see

377
00:27:57.199 --> 00:28:02.069
what's happening to those populations. There's a significant decline

378
00:28:02.069 --> 00:28:08.380
in those. We're also seeing toxification, you know, huge

379
00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:13.349
amounts of pollution, um, because of emissions, because of,

380
00:28:13.579 --> 00:28:17.939
um, Fertilizer emissions from agriculture, but also all of

381
00:28:17.939 --> 00:28:21.729
the different industries that create all of this stuff

382
00:28:21.939 --> 00:28:26.630
for us, like plastics, um, etc. So you can

383
00:28:27.189 --> 00:28:32.790
See, uh, climate change, biodiversity loss, species extinction, and

384
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:37.859
global toxification are all related to one species, and

385
00:28:37.859 --> 00:28:42.780
that's humans, and simply because, especially in the last

386
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:46.250
200 years that we've seen all of these issues

387
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:48.819
emerge in a way that we've never seen in

388
00:28:48.819 --> 00:28:53.589
our history, right? We've never changed the climate. As

389
00:28:53.589 --> 00:28:56.390
quickly and as badly as we have done in

390
00:28:56.390 --> 00:29:00.229
just the last 200 years. And so that's directly

391
00:29:00.229 --> 00:29:03.750
related to the growth in human population and consumption.

392
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.050
So I think that related to that. In what

393
00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:11.510
ways do you think that ideas surrounding population growth

394
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:14.859
connect to ideas surrounding the need for a near

395
00:29:14.859 --> 00:29:17.069
infinite economic growth?

396
00:29:18.599 --> 00:29:23.599
Yes, economic growth really is one of the main

397
00:29:23.599 --> 00:29:27.119
drivers. In addition to some of the other things

398
00:29:27.119 --> 00:29:33.989
I mentioned, you know, nationalism, ethnocentrism, religious, uh, growth,

399
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.619
all of them drive this need for population. Um,

400
00:29:38.699 --> 00:29:43.459
SO there are lots of different institutions that benefit

401
00:29:43.459 --> 00:29:48.739
from population growth, but economic growth or economy is

402
00:29:48.739 --> 00:29:54.810
one of those very powerful institutions. So, Economic growth

403
00:29:54.810 --> 00:30:01.209
is now seen as the ultimate. Descriptor or metric

404
00:30:01.209 --> 00:30:04.890
of progress in a lot of countries, even though

405
00:30:05.219 --> 00:30:11.780
we know report after report shows that economic growth

406
00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.900
does not lead to growth and prosperity. It does

407
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.180
not lead to uh a reduction or eradication of

408
00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:24.579
poverty, and it definitely does not lead to, you

409
00:30:24.579 --> 00:30:27.579
know, better standards of living for majority of the

410
00:30:27.579 --> 00:30:33.589
people. Because so much of our economic growth model

411
00:30:33.589 --> 00:30:38.760
or thinking is based on this idea that if

412
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:44.589
you grow the economy, you then use the taxes

413
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.640
from people to then distribute those to the rest

414
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.560
of the population so you could have um more

415
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:56.489
equitable distribution or reduction of poverty. But that has

416
00:30:56.489 --> 00:31:00.189
not been the case. We have interviewed so many

417
00:31:00.569 --> 00:31:06.609
ecological economists. We recently interviewed the UN Special Rapporteur

418
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:12.560
on extreme poverty and human rights, Olivia the shooter,

419
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:16.250
and he recently wrote a report called The Poverty

420
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:21.010
of Growth, which actually outlines all of the reasons

421
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:26.050
in which Economic growth is not a good metric

422
00:31:26.599 --> 00:31:30.560
to use as an indicator of progress, but to

423
00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:36.449
your point, economic growth, because it's become so ideologically

424
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.880
based in cultural and political thinking, is that without

425
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.119
looking at any of the evidence, all of the

426
00:31:44.119 --> 00:31:48.800
politicians and economists are constantly talking about the need

427
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:55.229
to grow the economy. And Intertwined with that need

428
00:31:55.229 --> 00:32:02.380
is economic growth. In their mind relies on population

429
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.099
growth, that if you have more people who are

430
00:32:05.099 --> 00:32:08.449
paying into the taxes, who are buying more stuff.

431
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.180
Helps to grow the economy and so that's why

432
00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.500
they are pushing for greater population growth that's why

433
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.540
they're pushing for these pro-natalist policies uh that's why

434
00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:25.380
they're panicking that fertility rates are declining even though

435
00:32:25.739 --> 00:32:31.719
declining fertility rates have actually made countries better off,

436
00:32:32.459 --> 00:32:35.859
um, economically, you know, if you look at some

437
00:32:35.859 --> 00:32:39.890
of the countries where fertility rates have declined. Um,

438
00:32:40.119 --> 00:32:46.219
THERE is greater rates of employment, um, greater affordability

439
00:32:46.219 --> 00:32:49.390
in terms of housing, you know, housing has become

440
00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:54.050
so extremely expensive. Um, BECAUSE of competition that most

441
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:58.010
people cannot afford to purchase a house, so you're

442
00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:03.349
seeing as countries where populations are declining even slightly,

443
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:09.040
there's actually greater progress and, and greater social well-being

444
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:15.699
because there's less competition, because there's greater distribution. So,

445
00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:19.829
the idea of economic growth tied to population growth,

446
00:33:19.969 --> 00:33:26.060
even though it's deeply embedded within our countries, it's,

447
00:33:26.069 --> 00:33:30.170
it's the wrong idea. But it's also at the

448
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:35.079
heart of so many of our ecological crises, because

449
00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:39.869
one way. That we have learned to structure our

450
00:33:39.869 --> 00:33:47.750
economies is we believe that. Our planet falls under

451
00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:52.020
the economy, like our ecology is a subset of

452
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:56.180
the economy, you know, that economic growth is more

453
00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:02.020
important than anything else. And often. What a lot

454
00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:09.010
of um economic models are based on is externalizing

455
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.770
a lot of the costs, real costs of what

456
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:17.368
we are doing to the environment. So The reason

457
00:34:17.368 --> 00:34:22.329
we are able to access such cheap stuff and

458
00:34:22.329 --> 00:34:26.049
you know, such cheap labor is because we are

459
00:34:26.049 --> 00:34:31.368
undermining two things. One is human rights, uh, where

460
00:34:31.368 --> 00:34:33.728
a lot of the stuff that is being produced

461
00:34:33.728 --> 00:34:37.608
so cheaply is being done by people who have

462
00:34:38.128 --> 00:34:43.719
very few rights, including child laborers. Um, WHO get

463
00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:46.280
paid almost next to nothing for the work that

464
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.600
they are doing, right? So it's a form of

465
00:34:49.958 --> 00:34:55.600
um modern slavery, um, or simply just overexploitation of

466
00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.600
people. And the second externalized cost is what we

467
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.639
are doing to the rest of nature and non-human

468
00:35:03.639 --> 00:35:06.840
animals. So the reason we are able to have

469
00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:12.000
stuff stuff so cheap is because we put absolutely

470
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.750
no value on nature, on earth, on the trees,

471
00:35:16.879 --> 00:35:20.199
on the animals. We kind of see them as

472
00:35:20.199 --> 00:35:25.429
resources. Right? And that's an extend extension of this

473
00:35:25.429 --> 00:35:29.389
worldview of human supremacy, that we are the only

474
00:35:29.389 --> 00:35:33.780
species that matters. Everything else just exists for us,

475
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:38.659
and therefore we can exploit and dominate and You

476
00:35:38.659 --> 00:35:43.699
know, eradicate anything else for our own our own

477
00:35:43.699 --> 00:35:47.989
well-being. And so much of the cost that we're

478
00:35:47.989 --> 00:35:51.949
seeing environmentally and ecologically and in terms of human

479
00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:56.310
rights is actually externalized, so the thing that we

480
00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:02.100
pay, you know, $5 for really should be $5000

481
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.790
that most people wouldn't be able to afford them

482
00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:09.889
because you're including the real cost. Of creating a

483
00:36:09.889 --> 00:36:13.879
laptop or creating a cell phone, rather than externalizing

484
00:36:13.879 --> 00:36:18.250
that cost onto the in quote unquote environment, which

485
00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:22.770
is nature, other human beings or other non-human beings.

486
00:36:24.709 --> 00:36:28.350
So, I have one final question then, because there's

487
00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:33.149
been also much alarmism surrounding this, particularly in the

488
00:36:33.149 --> 00:36:36.949
more developed countries. On the topic of aging populations

489
00:36:36.949 --> 00:36:41.979
and social security, do aging populations really need more

490
00:36:41.979 --> 00:36:42.780
babies?

491
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.800
Well, that's what uh you hear a lot in

492
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.830
the media narratives and in politicians talking, right, is

493
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.919
there is a baby bust or a fertility crisis

494
00:36:57.919 --> 00:37:02.719
where not enough babies are being born to provide

495
00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:08.449
the social security for the aging population. And so

496
00:37:08.449 --> 00:37:12.239
I'll explain to you the thinking behind that first.

497
00:37:12.689 --> 00:37:16.969
Um, SO, we just spoke about how our economic

498
00:37:16.969 --> 00:37:24.939
models are based. And Much of our recent economic

499
00:37:24.939 --> 00:37:30.340
modeling is based on this um pyramid scheme or

500
00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:35.290
a Ponzi scheme where you have a large number

501
00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:40.870
of working age population. Uh, WHO then are taxed

502
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:46.030
or who are basically paying into the pensions or

503
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.830
Social Security for the elderly population once they retire

504
00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:55.000
or once they stop working. And um that has

505
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.360
been the model that's been used for, you know,

506
00:37:57.439 --> 00:38:01.360
over 100 years, and or maybe even less than

507
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:06.879
that. But that model is, is hugely flawed, really,

508
00:38:06.919 --> 00:38:11.479
because it is based at a time when you

509
00:38:11.479 --> 00:38:15.959
had a growing population, right? Our population has only

510
00:38:15.959 --> 00:38:18.639
been growing in the last 200 years. It has

511
00:38:18.639 --> 00:38:21.669
not been growing for most of our human history.

512
00:38:22.379 --> 00:38:26.219
So our model is based on a really small

513
00:38:26.219 --> 00:38:30.780
window of our human history. When our population was

514
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.649
growing and there were more people of working age

515
00:38:34.649 --> 00:38:37.689
because people were having more children, there were more

516
00:38:37.689 --> 00:38:40.409
people of working age than there were older people.

517
00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:47.899
And that model worked for some amount of time.

518
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.310
However, over again, the last couple of 100 years,

519
00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.120
also, we have, or maybe even sorry, 50 or

520
00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.889
60 years, we have seen two trends emerging. And

521
00:39:00.889 --> 00:39:04.810
they have happened simultaneously. So over the last 70

522
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:08.610
years, especially after the Second World War, we have

523
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:13.080
started to see um a decline in fertility rates,

524
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:17.409
which is a positive trend because it signifies greater

525
00:39:17.409 --> 00:39:22.300
gender equality, greater reproductive autonomy, greater rights for children.

526
00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:28.850
And the second positive trend has been. A um

527
00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:32.800
increase in the lifespan of an average human. So

528
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:36.120
when we were living, you know, to 30 or

529
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.280
40 years, we are now living longer, healthier lives.

530
00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.219
So both of those trends are positive trends that

531
00:39:44.219 --> 00:39:49.780
we should be celebrating. Instead, a lot of governments

532
00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:55.899
and politicians are. Um, USING the narrative that an

533
00:39:55.899 --> 00:39:59.340
aging population is some kind of a crisis and

534
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:03.429
a fertility decline. IS some kind of a crisis.

535
00:40:03.719 --> 00:40:05.919
So you can see the thinking is already upside

536
00:40:05.919 --> 00:40:09.280
down because there are two very positive trends that

537
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:14.669
we should be celebrating. Um, AND then this idea

538
00:40:14.669 --> 00:40:18.879
that we need more people, more babies in order

539
00:40:18.879 --> 00:40:24.270
to support the aging population is um really upside

540
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:31.659
down. It's, it's wrongheaded idea because Are The, the

541
00:40:31.659 --> 00:40:35.709
reason we currently have more people generally in most

542
00:40:35.709 --> 00:40:38.489
countries, we do have more people who are older

543
00:40:38.699 --> 00:40:42.620
than there are working age population. So instead of

544
00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:46.219
a pyramid that's like this, it's an upside down

545
00:40:46.219 --> 00:40:50.620
pyramid where there are more people who are older.

546
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:57.689
But that is a transitional phase, because that, as

547
00:40:57.689 --> 00:41:01.139
I said, was a very small time frame during

548
00:41:01.139 --> 00:41:06.439
which our population um increased so much, so quickly.

549
00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:13.320
And once that elderly population passes on. You can

550
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.679
see people are having fewer and fewer children, the

551
00:41:16.679 --> 00:41:20.669
following generations, that means we're not producing more people

552
00:41:20.879 --> 00:41:25.510
than there are older people. So, number one, it's

553
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:28.790
a transitional phase that means we only need to

554
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:31.510
figure out what to do for the next, you

555
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:35.070
know, 10 to 20 years, once that pyramid starts

556
00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:39.149
to flatten out. Number 2, think of it this

557
00:41:39.149 --> 00:41:43.629
way. A baby born today, how is that baby?

558
00:41:44.739 --> 00:41:49.209
One, how is that child productive enough to provide

559
00:41:49.209 --> 00:41:52.820
the taxpayer money that is needed to support an

560
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:56.500
elderly population? A baby is not productive for at

561
00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:01.399
least 20 years until they start working. So it's,

562
00:42:01.479 --> 00:42:05.360
it's kind of this wrongheaded thinking where people aren't

563
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:11.040
really thinking about what, what are possible solutions other

564
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.350
than just pushing women to have lots of children.

565
00:42:14.879 --> 00:42:17.770
So some different ways that you can think of

566
00:42:18.229 --> 00:42:23.929
supporting the aging population. Number 1, instead of putting

567
00:42:23.929 --> 00:42:28.850
in billions of dollars into pro-natalist policies, you could

568
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:32.570
be putting that exact money into creating a Social

569
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:37.340
Security plan for the aging population. Right? All of

570
00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.739
those billions of dollars are actually not working because

571
00:42:42.219 --> 00:42:46.659
once women determine how many children they want, you

572
00:42:46.659 --> 00:42:51.310
cannot bribe them to have more children. Right? And

573
00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:54.459
the only way you can do that is through

574
00:42:54.459 --> 00:42:57.899
coercive means, which we are starting to see happen

575
00:42:57.899 --> 00:43:01.899
in many countries where we are seeing abortion bans

576
00:43:01.899 --> 00:43:05.350
being put into place to coerce women into having

577
00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:10.870
children. You are seeing sanctions on contraceptives that are

578
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:14.949
not no longer freely available to people. You are

579
00:43:14.949 --> 00:43:20.580
seeing. Uh, NARRATIVES or policies like in Russia, where

580
00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:25.770
if you are uh caught promoting the child-free choice,

581
00:43:25.939 --> 00:43:29.219
like people deciding to not have children, you can

582
00:43:29.219 --> 00:43:34.060
be fined significantly, it's called child-free propaganda. You can

583
00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:37.219
see in Hungary, where if you have 4 or

584
00:43:37.219 --> 00:43:40.250
more children, you don't pay any taxes for life.

585
00:43:40.939 --> 00:43:44.699
Uh, RIGHT, but it's, there's lots of things happening

586
00:43:44.699 --> 00:43:48.889
around different countries where reproductive choices being taken away

587
00:43:49.219 --> 00:43:51.790
from women in order to push them into to

588
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:57.139
have children, um, in order to often, you know,

589
00:43:57.449 --> 00:44:02.270
support this elderly growing population. So instead of putting

590
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:07.000
all that money towards pronatalist policies which aren't working,

591
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:10.469
you could use that money to put towards the

592
00:44:10.469 --> 00:44:15.830
elderly care. The other thing is, even though people

593
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:20.729
are aging, they are living healthier lives. That means

594
00:44:20.729 --> 00:44:25.030
they're actually productive for a lot longer than 64

595
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:28.350
years, right? My father is 80 years old and

596
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:32.449
he's still actively working. Uh, HE'S very much engaged

597
00:44:32.449 --> 00:44:35.270
and so is my mother in her 70s, and

598
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:39.229
a lot of people. You know, are living healthier,

599
00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:43.750
longer lives, that means they don't get old old

600
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.590
until much later. That means they don't need that

601
00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:51.590
medical or social care until much later. So instead

602
00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:55.149
of looking at elderly people as burdens, it would

603
00:44:55.149 --> 00:44:58.629
be important to also see them as dignified members

604
00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:02.350
of society, uh, rather than, you know, people who

605
00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:07.229
are requiring all of these um services. But then

606
00:45:07.229 --> 00:45:10.510
you also look at how our Social Security or

607
00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:13.830
tax system is based, right? What if we started

608
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:17.189
to tax the wealthy, really started to tax the

609
00:45:17.189 --> 00:45:22.070
wealthy? Um, THERE'S a lot of money available from

610
00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:26.750
that that can then be redirected towards social security

611
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:31.830
programs. What if we redirected subsidies that the governments

612
00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:36.310
are putting towards really destructive industries like the fossil

613
00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:42.409
fuel industry, like the animal agricultural industry, to Again,

614
00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:46.139
or the military, right? The military budget is extremely

615
00:45:46.139 --> 00:45:48.899
huge. What if you took a fraction of that

616
00:45:48.899 --> 00:45:53.189
money and you put that toward supporting Social Security?

617
00:45:54.239 --> 00:45:58.520
So the thing is, there's no shortage of creative

618
00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:03.199
ideas that governments can use to support an aging

619
00:46:03.199 --> 00:46:07.790
population. It's just that our governments are stuck in

620
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:14.320
such terrible thinking and such outdated thinking um of

621
00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:17.280
models that are no longer working for us, that

622
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.689
are no longer working for most of the people

623
00:46:19.959 --> 00:46:24.040
and that are not working for our environment. Um,

624
00:46:24.239 --> 00:46:26.040
AND we really need to get out of that

625
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.679
kind of thinking and, and in our podcast we

626
00:46:29.679 --> 00:46:33.590
interview a lot of folks who offer alternatives to

627
00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.679
where we could move our economic structures and how

628
00:46:37.679 --> 00:46:41.719
can we embrace an aging population rather than panicking

629
00:46:41.719 --> 00:46:42.199
about it.

630
00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:48.360
Great, really fascinating, so Nandita, just before we go,

631
00:46:48.489 --> 00:46:50.889
would you like to tell people where they can

632
00:46:50.889 --> 00:46:53.169
find you and your work on the Internet?

633
00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:59.169
Absolutely. Thank you, Ricardo. So, you can find us

634
00:46:59.169 --> 00:47:04.729
on Populationbalance.org, that's our website. We do a number

635
00:47:04.729 --> 00:47:08.100
of things. So we are a nonprofit think tank

636
00:47:08.449 --> 00:47:13.090
and we produce two podcasts. One is the overpopulation

637
00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:21.290
podcast in which we interview ecologists, anthropologists, feminists, economists.

638
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:27.729
Um, AND journalists to talk about alternatives to our

639
00:47:27.729 --> 00:47:32.689
current growth biased system, alternatives that are equitable, that

640
00:47:32.689 --> 00:47:37.090
are rights-based, that are ecocentric, that consider the rights

641
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:40.689
of humans and non-humans. So that's a really great

642
00:47:40.689 --> 00:47:44.570
podcast that's available on every platform and including on

643
00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:48.010
YouTube. And then the other podcast that I recently

644
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:53.489
started, it's a storytelling podcast where I interview individuals

645
00:47:53.489 --> 00:47:58.649
and couples to talk about how they are challenging

646
00:47:58.649 --> 00:48:04.560
pro-natalist narratives and pressures to to redefine family and

647
00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.120
what it means for them to live their life

648
00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:12.159
with fulfillment. And that podcast is called Beyond Pronatalism,

649
00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:17.530
Finding Fulfillment With or Without Kids. So that podcast

650
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:21.350
is also available on every platform. And then the

651
00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:24.820
other two things that we do is we produce

652
00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.860
academic peer-reviewed research. So if you'd like to read

653
00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:33.500
any of our work on pro-natalism, on ecocentrism, or

654
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:39.270
population denial, you can check out our populationbalance.org page

655
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:42.750
and you, we have a peer-reviewed research under there.

656
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:48.209
And we also write a lot of media articles,

657
00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:54.340
op-eds, to challenge these mainstream growth bias narratives. And

658
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:59.030
if you're looking for learning or educating yourself on

659
00:48:59.459 --> 00:49:05.500
good arguments to counteract all of these destructive, extractive,

660
00:49:05.659 --> 00:49:09.790
you know, growth biased. Narratives, uh, you can look

661
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.320
at some of our articles. They are meant to

662
00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:16.149
be really educational for the public. So those are

663
00:49:16.149 --> 00:49:20.310
all the things, um, and yeah, you can, people

664
00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:22.790
can reach us through our website if they'd like

665
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:25.310
to be interviewed for any of our podcasts or

666
00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:27.909
if they'd like to interview us for, for any

667
00:49:27.909 --> 00:49:28.699
of their work.

668
00:49:30.169 --> 00:49:32.360
Great, I will be leaving some links to all

669
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.050
of that in the description of the interview and

670
00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:37.409
