00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.210
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.409
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:10.010
today I'm joined by Doctor Philip Nitschke. He's an

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.960
Australian humanist, author, former physician, and founder and director

5
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.329
of the pro-euthanasia group Exit International. And today we're

6
00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:25.129
going to talk mostly about assisted suicide. So, Doctor

7
00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:27.610
Nitschke, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

8
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:27.930
have everyone.

9
00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:30.399
Yeah, very, very glad to join you.

10
00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:36.549
So let's start here by clarifying some terms. First

11
00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:42.340
of all, what is assisted suicide? What is euthanasia,

12
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.900
and what is voluntary euthanasia?

13
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.630
Well, I think assisted suicide explains itself effectively. I

14
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.590
mean, suicide is an act where you end your

15
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.240
own life and if you If you, uh, get

16
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.919
some assistance, I suppose that classifies as assisted suicide.

17
00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.950
Euthanasia has come to mean the, uh, provision of,

18
00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:05.440
uh, uh, whatever one might need to end one's

19
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.720
life with or without the person's consent. In other

20
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.279
words, someone does something to you, uh, to peacefully,

21
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.389
that is the, uh, the word euthanasia, peaceful death

22
00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:19.040
to peacefully end your life. And, uh, I suppose

23
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.620
voluntary euthanasia, well, that's a situation where that provision

24
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.050
of a service to end your life is done

25
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.029
at specific request of the individual who wishes to

26
00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:30.779
die. So, I mean, that's usual the way the

27
00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:33.550
way those words and divisions are, are, uh, are

28
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.059
defined. Mhm.

29
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.190
So let me ask you just a couple of

30
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.709
more personal questions. When did you start advocating for

31
00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.269
assisted suicide and what led you there?

32
00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.019
Uh, LOOK, it wasn't, uh, it wasn't something that

33
00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:50.059
was a passion in my life. I've been involved

34
00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:51.940
in a lot of different issues, and some of

35
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.500
them social change issues throughout my life, but I

36
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.129
did medicine late, rather late in life, and, uh,

37
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.500
and I suppose I'd only just, and I'd only

38
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.500
just finished my medical training when, uh, I was

39
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.260
working in my, uh, I went back to my

40
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.690
home, uh, city, which didn't have a medical school.

41
00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:09.460
I'd gone to Sydney to do medicine. I went

42
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.380
back to Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia

43
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.949
and heard. That there was about to be this

44
00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.440
new introduction of a piece of legislation which would

45
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.399
allow a doctor to give a, a lethal injection

46
00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.490
to a terminally ill patient. Uh, I heard about

47
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.139
it on the radio. Um, I thought, good idea,

48
00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:29.309
and went back to bed. Uh, AND, uh, was

49
00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:32.910
really surprised and taken aback by the immense opposition

50
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.350
that, uh, unfolded in the next, effectively 24 hours.

51
00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.649
There was a huge reaction from my new profession,

52
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.550
particularly, that was followed up by the church in

53
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.550
the later days. But initially it was the immense

54
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.029
and rather totally surprising reaction. I thought it was

55
00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.869
a good idea. The people of the, uh, the

56
00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.509
public, Uh, I thought it was a good idea.

57
00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.500
The pop the politician who had suggested it was

58
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.539
very, was being applauded for being very forward-thinking. We,

59
00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.300
I realized, because it became clear that, in fact,

60
00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:05.509
this was the first time this was likely anywhere

61
00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:07.949
in the world, which was a bit unusual because

62
00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.550
the Northern Territory of Australia is not known for

63
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.869
progressive anything, really. It's considered to be something of

64
00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:16.360
a reactionary backwater. But in any, any event, uh,

65
00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.000
here on this rare occasion, they were suggesting something

66
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.809
which hadn't been done anywhere else. And I, and

67
00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:22.970
as I said, I thought it was a good

68
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.330
idea. The public thought it was a good idea,

69
00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.690
but the medical profession came right out hard and

70
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.360
said, no. We're having nothing to do with this,

71
00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.410
and that was, uh, mediated through organizations such as

72
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.320
the Australian Medical Association, Powerful bodies, but nevertheless, just

73
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.229
professional bodies. And what was of interest to me

74
00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.710
was that they then started to say things like,

75
00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:46.559
uh look, uh, don't even start, don't even try

76
00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.880
bringing in such a law because no doctor, In

77
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.199
the Northern Territory will cooperate. In other words, they

78
00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.059
were threatening to try and wreck the piece of

79
00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:58.679
legislation. And so that's how I got involved, because

80
00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:02.399
I thought, well, that's, that's wrong. I, uh, was

81
00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:05.639
in agreement with most of the public. Um, BUT

82
00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.919
I thought this new profession that I've just joined

83
00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.070
is now effectively telling the public what they need

84
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.350
to think about and how they should judge us

85
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.399
an initiative such as this. And I don't, I

86
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.548
didn't think the medical profession had any right to

87
00:04:19.548 --> 00:04:21.290
do this. They were taking this line that you

88
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.029
might think it's a good idea, that is the

89
00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:25.100
public, but we know what's best for you. And

90
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.589
it was that effectively, what seemed to me to

91
00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:30.589
be a quite patronizing attitude about something as fundamental

92
00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:33.869
as death by a profession which was setting itself

93
00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:36.779
up as some sort of particular body that knew

94
00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:38.989
more about this important issue than the public. And

95
00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:41.799
I thought that was one step too far. And

96
00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:44.350
I'd become, I was a little suspicious about my

97
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.320
profession in a lot of, uh, areas where I

98
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.399
figured I'd moved a little bit too far into

99
00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:50.920
the, uh, areas of knowing what's best for the

100
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.239
rest of us. And so this annoyed me. So

101
00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:55.399
I got involved politically because there was a long

102
00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:58.839
period then, uh, about, about a year of debate

103
00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:00.480
going on before it was going to be voted

104
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.950
on in that small parliament of the Northern Territory,

105
00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:06.230
and in that time, Uh, I found myself really

106
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.390
battling against, against the medical profession because the public

107
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.790
was starting to, to be affected by this idea

108
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.029
that, well, we think it's a good idea, but

109
00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:17.049
all these doctors are saying it's a bad idea.

110
00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:19.339
Maybe they know something that we don't know, and

111
00:05:19.549 --> 00:05:21.630
we're starting to eat away at the support, and

112
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.100
then the church weighed in, in a big way.

113
00:05:24.609 --> 00:05:27.170
And said they were doing having nothing, now Northern

114
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.109
Territory is the most secular place in Australia, but

115
00:05:30.109 --> 00:05:32.679
nevertheless, it was all having an impact and uh

116
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.089
and uh it wasn't looking like it was going

117
00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:37.690
to be as successful when it finally came to

118
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.279
the votes it it first looked like. I got

119
00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.269
together what seemed to be a very small group

120
00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:45.350
of doctors who supported it. I could only find

121
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.480
10 or 15, I think we got over the

122
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.920
whole territory out of some 700 doctors. Most of

123
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.760
the doctors just said, no, nothing to do with

124
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.119
it. We took out a full page ad and

125
00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:56.950
became involved politically. Uh, IT went to the vote,

126
00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.750
and it passed by one vote. It was a

127
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.820
small parliament of, uh, 25 politicians, and it split

128
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.730
1312. And that's how the legislation came in by

129
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.040
one vote. Uh, AND it was an ugly, dirty

130
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.450
campaign that was being waged, uh, by the doctors

131
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.529
and by the, uh, church and by other opponents.

132
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.690
Many claiming it was racist legislation. The territory's got

133
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.269
a large population of indigenous Aboriginal people, and they

134
00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:25.190
were saying, look, This is an attempt to try

135
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.070
and, uh, well, effectively, it was being cast or,

136
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.760
or being pitched to some form of new genocide.

137
00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:32.480
In other words, it was going to be used

138
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.119
selectively against black people. It would discourage them from

139
00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:38.660
seeking medical advice. All of these arguments were being

140
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.839
wheeled out. Uh, AND, uh, I was quite pleased

141
00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.529
when it eventually did pass by that one vote,

142
00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:48.600
but then it became my problem because the politicians

143
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.559
effectively said, Well, we've done our job, now it's

144
00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:53.500
your problem, and indeed it was. Because it was

145
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.739
a difficult piece of legislation to try and use,

146
00:06:55.859 --> 00:06:58.500
but effectively, eventually we got it, we got it

147
00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.899
working.

148
00:07:00.429 --> 00:07:05.049
Uh, WHEN and why did people start calling you

149
00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:08.440
Doctor Death? Where does the nickname come from?

150
00:07:09.489 --> 00:07:12.170
Well, it effectively started on the very first day

151
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.040
the legislation was used. The first person who tried

152
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.920
to use it failed miserably. He came all the

153
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.399
way to Darwin to use it, and I couldn't

154
00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.959
get doctors to sign his papers. The legislation needed

155
00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:24.790
for doctor signatures. I couldn't get anyone. He went

156
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.760
back home again and died horribly. But the next

157
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.149
person that tried to use it, I did manage

158
00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:33.040
to find a supportive doctor, and then a supportive

159
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.799
psychiatrist and got it signed. But on the day

160
00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:38.790
that he did choose to die, Uh, it was

161
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.149
in the it came into effect on the 1st

162
00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:45.019
of July in 1996, uh, and it was used

163
00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:46.670
in September of that year, so it had been

164
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.779
in place for 3 months, that law before I

165
00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:51.390
finally managed one of my patients who was terminally

166
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.390
ill with prostate cancer. Um, PRESSED a button on

167
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.540
a machine that I'd built so that it delivered

168
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.589
the, uh, the machine delivered the lethal injection. I

169
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:02.190
set it up and everything, but he pressed the

170
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.140
button. And while I was sitting there watching this

171
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.309
first death take place, cause I had, I was

172
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:09.230
there, I had to be present, but I didn't

173
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.549
have to actually push the plunger, the machine did

174
00:08:11.549 --> 00:08:14.109
that. But I realized at that time that things

175
00:08:14.109 --> 00:08:15.899
were going to be different, and indeed they were.

176
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.269
And in fact, that was the day when the

177
00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:21.299
label effectively was first used. When it first When

178
00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:23.260
the news broke that it had been used, that

179
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.940
it was the first legal lethal voluntary injection in

180
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:31.700
the world. Um, uh, EFFECTIVELY became, uh, attracted that,

181
00:08:31.739 --> 00:08:34.940
uh, that label or epithet, and it didn't, uh,

182
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.739
I guess it didn't surprise me because it was

183
00:08:36.739 --> 00:08:40.090
a, it was a very fiercely fought and quite

184
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.979
ugly campaign, the politics behind it, getting it moving,

185
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.780
and I guess a bit of name-calling wasn't to

186
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.659
be too wasn't too surprising.

187
00:08:50.289 --> 00:08:53.969
What are the main arguments you have in favor

188
00:08:53.969 --> 00:08:55.609
of assisted suicide?

189
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.010
Well, it was. It was a straightforward situation as

190
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.409
far as I was concerned. As I said, I

191
00:09:00.409 --> 00:09:02.090
heard about it on the radio. I thought, gosh,

192
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.729
if I was dying, I would want to be,

193
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.719
I would, I would like to make the, uh,

194
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.570
decision myself. Uh, I couldn't imagine why anyone else

195
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.869
wouldn't want to make that decision. The idea that

196
00:09:14.869 --> 00:09:17.979
someone would sit there and say to me, no,

197
00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:21.619
uh, we don't think you should have access to

198
00:09:21.869 --> 00:09:24.630
these drugs that could, you could use to put

199
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.469
an end to your suffering just seemed strange. I

200
00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:30.729
knew that because I was, uh, by this stage,

201
00:09:30.789 --> 00:09:33.429
I'd had some medical training. I knew what drugs

202
00:09:33.429 --> 00:09:35.669
I could get, so I sensed that I was

203
00:09:35.669 --> 00:09:38.359
in a good position. And I couldn't see why

204
00:09:38.359 --> 00:09:40.320
other people wouldn't want to be in what I

205
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.190
thought was that same good position to be able

206
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.919
to have that control if I got to that

207
00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:49.080
position. And I found the arguments that were being

208
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.320
used against that option, particularly the ones that the

209
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.869
medical profession were trying to use to be quite,

210
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.599
quite false. Uh, AND in fact, fed into this

211
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:04.390
idea. Of the profession being very paternalistic, uh, and

212
00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:09.200
very, uh, and very, um, I am very, very

213
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.359
comfortable with trying to tell people about the way

214
00:10:12.359 --> 00:10:14.559
they should live and in particular the way they

215
00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:15.200
should die.

216
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.479
Do you think there's any risk that some people

217
00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:25.609
might use assisted suicide just to find relief in

218
00:10:25.609 --> 00:10:26.080
death?

219
00:10:27.539 --> 00:10:29.900
Well, I don't find that troubling. I mean, if

220
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.820
death is a relief, uh, the only way that

221
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.260
the relief that you are seeking can be obtained,

222
00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:37.890
you should certainly, I would say, have that option.

223
00:10:38.219 --> 00:10:40.539
It's a precious gift of life. We know that.

224
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.909
I understand this, but what sort of a gift

225
00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:45.570
is a gift that you can't give away? Uh,

226
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.330
IF you've got come to that position that now

227
00:10:48.609 --> 00:10:51.219
you realize it's a permanent step, but things are

228
00:10:51.219 --> 00:10:54.369
so bad, and the only only solution that you

229
00:10:54.369 --> 00:10:57.299
can see, To end what you're going through is

230
00:10:57.299 --> 00:11:01.159
by divesting yourself of this precious gift. Why shouldn't

231
00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:03.419
you have that choice? And that's the way I

232
00:11:03.419 --> 00:11:05.020
see it, as I had always seen it, that

233
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.179
this was, this was something that I would decide

234
00:11:07.179 --> 00:11:09.609
on. If I decide to give up my life,

235
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.260
I want to know I can. I do know

236
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.530
I can because I've got access to the means.

237
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.099
And why wouldn't anyone else want that choice too?

238
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.409
So it just seemed to be a strange argument

239
00:11:19.409 --> 00:11:21.179
to deny a person that option.

240
00:11:22.229 --> 00:11:27.070
Mhm. Uh, WHO are the people or institutions that

241
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:32.429
you find tend to oppose uh assisted suicide the

242
00:11:32.429 --> 00:11:36.820
most and what kinds of arguments are you most

243
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.750
frequently confronted with?

244
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.179
Well, the ones that I've been, I've been battling

245
00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:44.979
most of my for the subsequent next 30 years

246
00:11:44.979 --> 00:11:47.580
or 25 or 30 years it's been, uh, I've

247
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.179
been involved in this issue from that, uh, initial

248
00:11:50.179 --> 00:11:55.219
introduction. The predominant opposition that I find myself dealing

249
00:11:55.219 --> 00:11:57.940
with is coming from within my profession, the one

250
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.780
which I've now effectively left, uh, luckily from the

251
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.130
medical profession. The opposition from the doctors has been

252
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.489
the most, the one that I've found myself most

253
00:12:06.489 --> 00:12:09.010
often having to confront, although, of course, there are

254
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.049
plenty of other groups that don't like, uh, our

255
00:12:13.049 --> 00:12:15.700
support, my support for this issue. And as I've

256
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.450
indicated, the church and various religious organizations, etc. BUT

257
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.169
the medical profession is the most interesting one to

258
00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:25.919
me. And the arguments they use are ones which

259
00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:29.919
I find quite, quite, uh, quite false. Now, you

260
00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:33.799
may, uh, be aware that over the 20 or

261
00:12:33.799 --> 00:12:35.919
30 years that I've been involved, and this is

262
00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:39.559
the attitude of many of the, uh, professional bodies

263
00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:44.030
associated with medicine have changed their position slowly, grudgingly.

264
00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:47.119
They have changed their position now to come around

265
00:12:47.119 --> 00:12:50.260
to a, if you like, a weak support for

266
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.159
the idea. Uh, AND then that's how many of

267
00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:55.700
the pieces of legislation that have come in around

268
00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.140
the world since that time, because that law in

269
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.469
the Northern Territory was the world's first, but it

270
00:13:00.469 --> 00:13:03.630
was followed a few months after, it only lasted

271
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.789
8 months, I might add, before it was overturned

272
00:13:05.789 --> 00:13:09.469
by the national government of Australia. But shortly after

273
00:13:09.469 --> 00:13:12.789
that, in 1997, Oregon and America brought in laws

274
00:13:12.789 --> 00:13:15.830
and then many other states, Canada, and the Netherlands

275
00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.510
where I'm now based in 2001, all brought in

276
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:22.330
laws. But uh the concern was that in these

277
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.940
pieces of legislation, many of these places made the

278
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.809
same trouble, made, made the same mistake of bringing

279
00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:31.679
in laws, I would call it a mistake, where

280
00:13:32.289 --> 00:13:34.900
control of the process is determined by the medical

281
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.049
profession. In other words, they bring in what's known

282
00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:40.679
as medical laws. As was a medical law, you

283
00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:42.799
had to be sick enough to be eligible, and

284
00:13:42.799 --> 00:13:44.679
you had to prove you were sick enough by

285
00:13:44.679 --> 00:13:48.359
getting your, if you like, level of suffering assessed

286
00:13:48.359 --> 00:13:51.440
by several doctors. And my concern is the fact

287
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.599
that that law, by its very nature, sets up

288
00:13:54.599 --> 00:13:57.640
the gatekeeping to the whole process and hands it

289
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.119
over to a particular group, that is the medical

290
00:14:00.119 --> 00:14:02.780
profession. And I would argue that that group has,

291
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.799
has, is in no position to accept that or

292
00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:08.119
take on that responsibility. In fact, I think it's

293
00:14:08.119 --> 00:14:10.559
a, It's a mistake to give it to them.

294
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.169
Uh, YEAH, that's what many places have done, and

295
00:14:13.169 --> 00:14:15.169
these days I spend a lot of time urging

296
00:14:15.169 --> 00:14:17.010
people not to do that, to take on laws

297
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.570
which are different where that control isn't given to

298
00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.690
a particular group, but that that control stays seated

299
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.239
in the individual themselves.

300
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.119
What do you think about palliative care?

301
00:14:30.109 --> 00:14:32.849
Well, palliative care, certainly, I, I, I think I

302
00:14:32.849 --> 00:14:35.500
went through medical training in Sydney, and I don't

303
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.739
think the word euthanasia was mentioned once, and I

304
00:14:37.739 --> 00:14:40.010
think palliative care was mentioned once or twice. It

305
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:43.409
wasn't exactly given prominence, but I was well aware

306
00:14:43.409 --> 00:14:45.409
of its existence. And in fact, when that piece

307
00:14:45.409 --> 00:14:48.130
of law came in in 1997, 1 of the

308
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.760
conditions was that any individual seeking help to die

309
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.359
would have had to have their so-called palliative care

310
00:14:55.359 --> 00:14:58.140
options explained to them. And so I learned quite

311
00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.419
a bit about palliative care in that stage, and

312
00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:03.049
uh, I was totally supportive of it. Of course,

313
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.780
if there are things that you can do to

314
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.820
alleviate your suffering. Uh, AND if your suffering is

315
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.739
caused by something which is alleviatable, um, go, you

316
00:15:14.739 --> 00:15:16.299
should have it. You should have that option. And

317
00:15:16.299 --> 00:15:19.219
if it's some sort of skilled schooled provision of

318
00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:22.020
some, uh, special drug, of course, you should have

319
00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.619
access to anything that might make the level of

320
00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:29.770
suffering less. And if that level of suffering. Lessons

321
00:15:30.049 --> 00:15:31.690
to the point where you don't feel that death

322
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.010
is the only solution, that's great, it's wonderful, it's

323
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.130
something to be encouraged, and of course people should

324
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.789
have access to the best means, if that's the

325
00:15:38.789 --> 00:15:41.950
issue. But of course, what I've found over the

326
00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.390
years is that many people have other issues which

327
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.909
are simply not issues that can be resolved by

328
00:15:47.909 --> 00:15:51.909
some skilled medical treatment, or by some skilled medical

329
00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:55.770
profession, such as palliative care. People with social reasons

330
00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.390
for wanting to die, which are very compelling. And

331
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.789
so there's no point saying that palliative care is

332
00:16:00.789 --> 00:16:03.500
gonna solve the issue. It's a good, it's an

333
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.099
important specialty, people should have provision to it, but

334
00:16:06.099 --> 00:16:09.000
let's not kid ourselves that it's going to remove

335
00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.969
anyone's desire to die.

336
00:16:12.229 --> 00:16:16.530
Right. Just for people to get a clearer picture

337
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.820
of how bad things can get, uh, how bad

338
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.299
can people's situations get if they do not have

339
00:16:24.299 --> 00:16:26.469
access to assisted suicide?

340
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.219
Well, I mean, it's just, I mean, people, a

341
00:16:30.219 --> 00:16:32.539
lot of people die in all sorts of ways

342
00:16:32.539 --> 00:16:36.320
and some of those ways, especially. With some of

343
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.479
the, uh, some of the medical conditions that can

344
00:16:39.479 --> 00:16:44.219
bring about death can be extremely difficult. Uh, THERE

345
00:16:44.219 --> 00:16:47.150
has been some wonderful improvements in very many of

346
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.229
the, uh, alleviating many of the symptoms associated with,

347
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.200
uh, often terminal illnesses. But, I mean, you don't

348
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.010
have to look very far to find diseases which

349
00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:00.960
produce symptoms, which would make your life so miserable

350
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.089
and unrelievably miserable. Uh, THAT I have no difficulty

351
00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:06.868
at all. One of the problems I found with

352
00:17:06.868 --> 00:17:08.550
doing medicine, I had problem, but one of the

353
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.670
things I hadn't, I had underestimated was just how

354
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:14.270
many bizarre and unusual diseases there are out there,

355
00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.030
which I wish I didn't know about. The fact

356
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.300
is that there are a lot, and that they

357
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.050
can produce immense degrees of suffering. But as I

358
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.650
said, that's not always the issue. Many people, for

359
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.569
example, seek ending their life, not just because of

360
00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:31.099
the suffering which may or may not be relievable

361
00:17:31.099 --> 00:17:36.239
with careful uh provision of special drugs. But I

362
00:17:36.239 --> 00:17:38.599
remember clearly one of the first people that I

363
00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:40.800
became involved with after that new law came in

364
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.729
and said to me, look, I want to die,

365
00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.119
um, I've got breast cancer, I've had really good

366
00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:50.119
palliative care, they've alleviated most of the symptoms, but

367
00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:53.150
I want to die, and I said why? And

368
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.989
she said, because I can't do what I want

369
00:17:54.989 --> 00:17:57.750
to do, I'm just here, I'm not uncomfortable, I'm

370
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.709
not in pain, but I can't do what I

371
00:17:59.709 --> 00:18:01.420
want to do. I said, what do you mean?

372
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.310
She said, well, I can't, I can't get up

373
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:06.010
and play golf anymore. And I say, Well, is

374
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.810
that a reason for Di? She said, it may

375
00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:11.890
not be your reason. But it's my reason. And

376
00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.910
so I've had wonderful palliative care, in fact, when

377
00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.849
I. Decided she, she should have access to this

378
00:18:17.849 --> 00:18:20.810
new law. Her palliative care doctors were very, very

379
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.569
upset. They said, look, she's a, a triumph of

380
00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:27.170
palliative care. She's a person who's responded wonderfully to

381
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.209
these drugs. We've got rid of all these nasty

382
00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:32.650
symptoms, she's not vomiting, she's lost her diarrhea, she

383
00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.430
hasn't got any pain. Why does she want to

384
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.949
die? And I said, Well, it's not up to

385
00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.469
you to tell her that she should want to

386
00:18:39.469 --> 00:18:43.109
live. Her reasons were ones that they clearly had

387
00:18:43.109 --> 00:18:45.349
trouble understanding. And I must say that it was

388
00:18:45.349 --> 00:18:48.150
a good lesson for me to stop trying to

389
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.550
put my views about what a life worth living

390
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.989
is on other people. So I'll let other people

391
00:18:52.989 --> 00:18:54.420
make that final decision.

392
00:18:56.099 --> 00:19:00.209
Do you think that prisoners who have been sentenced

393
00:19:00.209 --> 00:19:03.430
to life in prison should also have access to

394
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:04.699
assisted suicide?

395
00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.050
Yeah, I think that, uh, I think that I,

396
00:19:07.739 --> 00:19:10.579
I mean, the idea with the enthusiasm many of

397
00:19:10.579 --> 00:19:13.300
our governments have for putting people in prison forever

398
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.650
because they've done such bad things with no pretense

399
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.699
at rehabilitation or correction of whatever the crime was

400
00:19:19.699 --> 00:19:22.939
that they originally committed. Is effectively the provision of

401
00:19:22.939 --> 00:19:25.130
what I would describe as some form of permanent

402
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.410
or indefinite torture. Uh, NOW, I don't think the

403
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.250
state should be involved in torturing people. And if

404
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.390
you're going to accept the fact that the state

405
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.810
has a right to effectively provide indefinite torture, then

406
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.569
I think they have an obligation and at least

407
00:19:39.569 --> 00:19:42.449
to allow that person, To have access to the

408
00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:45.050
only means that they would have normally to put

409
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.790
an end to that suffering. Now, if they're in,

410
00:19:47.849 --> 00:19:50.010
uh, outside of a prison, sir, of course they

411
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.329
could end their lives. People can always stand in

412
00:19:52.329 --> 00:19:55.170
front of trains, but, uh, to lock someone up

413
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.050
and put them in a place where they then

414
00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.160
can't take this one avenue that you've got, surely,

415
00:20:00.329 --> 00:20:02.689
the one right that you must be able to

416
00:20:02.689 --> 00:20:05.410
preserve is the right to divest yourself of your

417
00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.569
life. And I don't think the state has any

418
00:20:07.569 --> 00:20:10.750
right to take that away. Now, They say, well,

419
00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.400
we don't have to help you, but I mean,

420
00:20:12.609 --> 00:20:14.410
uh, what they do is, of course, make it

421
00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.130
impossible by not providing places where people can, they

422
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.849
don't, they don't make it easy for people to

423
00:20:18.849 --> 00:20:23.010
end their lives if they're effectively incarcerated in life

424
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:25.170
without parole. The idea seems to be to put

425
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.010
them in a place where they can't take their

426
00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.130
life and make them suffer indefinitely, and that's, as

427
00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.130
I said, I the state being involved in torture

428
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.800
and something I don't condone at all.

429
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.760
Do you defend the right to die? Is that

430
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.150
something that you also defend or not?

431
00:20:42.239 --> 00:20:43.959
Yes, it is. I mean, as I said, I

432
00:20:43.959 --> 00:20:45.800
think it's a precious gift of life, but it's

433
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.280
a fundamental right to be able to divest yourself

434
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.040
of a gift that you don't want. And I

435
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.969
think this is a fundamental right, um. And it

436
00:20:53.969 --> 00:20:56.250
needs to be respected. I don't think governments should

437
00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.930
be weighing in and arguing with people who say

438
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.810
they wish to end their life. If a person

439
00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.319
wishes to end their life, and it's a rational

440
00:21:03.319 --> 00:21:05.770
decision, they're not talking about a decision by someone

441
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.130
who's mentally compromised, or a person who's lost what

442
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.969
we've described as mental capacity. But a person who

443
00:21:12.969 --> 00:21:16.250
makes an informed decision that now is the time

444
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.780
they wish to defend themselves of their precious gift

445
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:23.369
of life, that needs to be accepted, and I

446
00:21:23.369 --> 00:21:27.089
would argue, the means to means to carry out

447
00:21:27.089 --> 00:21:30.359
this, uh, this request provided for the individual. Now,

448
00:21:30.369 --> 00:21:33.849
that's not a popular view. Uh, SOME people say,

449
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:36.770
oh, yes, but only in cases of interminable or

450
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.329
suffering or terminal illness where you're just about to

451
00:21:39.329 --> 00:21:42.170
drop dead anyway. But I would say it's much

452
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.640
more fundamental than this, this should be for any

453
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.849
rational adult.

454
00:21:47.489 --> 00:21:53.540
In contemporary society and in contemporary medicine, suicide tends

455
00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.449
to get medicalized, but do you think it should

456
00:21:56.449 --> 00:21:57.729
be medicalized?

457
00:21:58.099 --> 00:21:59.630
No, and I think it was one of the,

458
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.500
uh, another example of where the uh where the

459
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.410
enthusiasm of the medical profession to move into these

460
00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:10.579
areas by medicalizing the concept of suicide, turning it

461
00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:14.900
effectively into a disease which needs treating. Uh, IS

462
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.310
one of the, one of the concerns, because what

463
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:20.130
that says is that every person who seeks suicide

464
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.819
or carries out or plans or looks at looks

465
00:22:22.819 --> 00:22:25.979
at suiciding is mentally ill. In other words, you're

466
00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:30.239
defining a disease here. Now, That's just not true

467
00:22:30.239 --> 00:22:32.189
in many cases. It's true that you can have

468
00:22:32.189 --> 00:22:35.359
mental illnesses that do, in fact, mean that you

469
00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:37.489
end up taking that step and wanting to end

470
00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:40.560
your life. And those people clearly should not be

471
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.630
given medical assistance to take that step. But there

472
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.319
is a phenomenon known as rational suicide, where a

473
00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:49.560
person from no mental illness, or with a mental

474
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.069
illness which is not severe enough to destroy their

475
00:22:52.069 --> 00:22:56.839
mental capacity, that is their ability to freethink. Makes

476
00:22:56.839 --> 00:22:58.949
a decision that now's the time that they wish

477
00:22:58.949 --> 00:23:01.160
to die, and to try and say that every

478
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.160
person who wishes to die is somehow or other

479
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.030
mentally ill and needs treatment for the mental illness,

480
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.300
rather than accepting that they have a fundamental right

481
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.520
to carry out this step, I think is a

482
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.219
big mistake, and it's one that still persists within

483
00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:15.880
the medical profession today.

484
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.069
But tell us a little bit about your organization,

485
00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.680
Exit International. What is it? How did it come

486
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.349
to be and what are its main goals?

487
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.829
Yeah, I started it, I started it very soon.

488
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.670
As I mentioned, that legislation which I first became

489
00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:37.599
involved in was in 1996, lasted eight months. Four

490
00:23:37.599 --> 00:23:41.319
of my patients received uh lethal injections from the

491
00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:43.000
machine that I had built, and then the law

492
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.969
was overturned and, That meant that Australia effectively went

493
00:23:46.969 --> 00:23:50.739
back into the dark ages where assistance to suicide

494
00:23:50.739 --> 00:23:53.099
is a serious crime, which is an interesting paradox

495
00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:56.420
because suicide is not a crime. But assistance to

496
00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.020
suicide, the person who provides that assistance is in

497
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.939
serious breach of the law and uh in some

498
00:24:02.939 --> 00:24:05.500
of the very savage penalties, not just, it's not

499
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.939
a slap on the wrist. If you assist a

500
00:24:06.939 --> 00:24:11.609
suicide, You can find yourself subject to legal proceedings

501
00:24:11.609 --> 00:24:14.489
which could lead to a penalty, uh life in

502
00:24:14.489 --> 00:24:16.810
prison, which is the most serious penalty in Australia,

503
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.650
they don't have access to the death penalty. So

504
00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.290
a serious penalty for helping someone do something which

505
00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:26.920
is lawful. Uh, IS the issue, so many people

506
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.319
still wanted to have this ability to end their

507
00:24:29.319 --> 00:24:31.829
lives, even though the law changed and we went

508
00:24:31.829 --> 00:24:34.349
back into the dark ages. So I set up

509
00:24:34.349 --> 00:24:38.270
an organization whereby I could effectively give them advice

510
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.229
on how to do that, how they could take

511
00:24:40.229 --> 00:24:43.520
their own lives. Give them the information they needed

512
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.760
so that they could then successfully suicide. Part of

513
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.390
the problem of suicide is, is that you can't

514
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:52.310
get good information about what works and what doesn't

515
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.949
work. And many people take the wrong drugs in

516
00:24:54.949 --> 00:24:57.920
the wrong amounts, hoping to end their lives and

517
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.479
finding out that they fail. So setting up an

518
00:25:01.479 --> 00:25:04.000
organization, which initially set out to try and give

519
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.680
good information, publishing that information in a handbook that

520
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.719
I wrote with my partner, Fiona Stewart, Peaceful Pill

521
00:25:10.719 --> 00:25:13.880
Handbook, giving information so that people can make an

522
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.949
informed decision. OK, now's the time to die, and

523
00:25:16.949 --> 00:25:18.359
now I know how to do it. That's how

524
00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:21.119
Exit International was set up. We started to run

525
00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:24.560
workshops around the world, teaching people what they needed

526
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.680
to know, because I was lucky I had that

527
00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.800
information. Because of my training background, and I was

528
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.670
able to provide it to other people. Uh, AND

529
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.410
I got away from this idea of just thinking

530
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.890
this was something that a doctor should decide to

531
00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:41.969
dole out to people who were particularly sick enough

532
00:25:41.969 --> 00:25:45.849
to, if you like, satisfy my criteria. It became

533
00:25:45.849 --> 00:25:47.969
something which I saw as a human right to

534
00:25:47.969 --> 00:25:51.209
have access to good information to inform people so

535
00:25:51.209 --> 00:25:53.329
that they could make this step and take this

536
00:25:53.329 --> 00:25:54.880
rational step themselves.

537
00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.199
So you mentioned the book that you sell on

538
00:25:59.199 --> 00:26:03.920
the Exit International website, the Peaceful Pill Handbook. What

539
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.560
is a peaceful ill?

540
00:26:06.319 --> 00:26:07.760
Well, it's a, it's a bit of a, it's

541
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.680
a euphemism for some sort of simple, reliable, peaceful

542
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.750
way where you can end your life. It became,

543
00:26:13.959 --> 00:26:15.719
people, when you ask them, what do you want?

544
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.760
If you're wanting to die, what, how do you

545
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.920
want to carry out this? Most people would say,

546
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.109
Look, I just want something I can just take

547
00:26:22.109 --> 00:26:24.959
as a pill or take as a drink. Something

548
00:26:24.959 --> 00:26:27.079
simple. Lie back, go to sleep and die while

549
00:26:27.079 --> 00:26:30.359
I'm asleep. That's the general answer. We've surveyed hundreds

550
00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:32.369
of people, thousands of people about this. They all

551
00:26:32.369 --> 00:26:35.800
say effectively the same thing. We want something simple.

552
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.329
Now I said, oh, so you want a pill,

553
00:26:37.449 --> 00:26:38.910
yes, we want a pill. I said, we want

554
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.920
a peaceful pill, so that became, if you like,

555
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.859
a metaphor or a euthanism for some simple reliable,

556
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:49.170
peaceful way where you can control uh the dying,

557
00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.479
the end of your own life.

558
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.459
But is this something that people can do themselves?

559
00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:56.810
Yeah,

560
00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.439
it has, and it has to be something you

561
00:26:58.439 --> 00:27:01.520
can do yourself. I mean, I'm not suggesting that

562
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.040
other people should come around and do things to

563
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.719
you. In fact, when people started to talk about

564
00:27:06.719 --> 00:27:09.760
the, uh, where law, they said, when laws came

565
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.359
in, all right, well I'd like a doctor to

566
00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:14.040
come around and help me die, well, I say,

567
00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:15.800
Well, why do you want someone to help you?

568
00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:18.079
You can do it. But you need to know

569
00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:20.040
what to do, and you need to have access

570
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.599
to the right means to do it. You don't

571
00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:24.880
have to try and share the decision making with

572
00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.599
someone else, especially you don't have to have a

573
00:27:26.599 --> 00:27:30.680
doctor. This idea that effectively, and it's been effectively

574
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.560
projected by the profession over medical profession over the

575
00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.790
decades, saying that effectively people feel they can't die,

576
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.630
unless they've got a doctor standing by the bedside.

577
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.880
Now this is ludicrous, you're gonna die whether you've

578
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.219
got a doctor or not, and so the idea

579
00:27:44.219 --> 00:27:46.640
that you need a doctor there is something which

580
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.959
I think is, I think rather unconscionably projected and

581
00:27:50.959 --> 00:27:53.579
uh by the medical profession who likes to see

582
00:27:53.579 --> 00:27:56.250
themselves and putting themselves in this position of authority

583
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.900
and power. Uh, AND I spent a lot of

584
00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.439
my time saying, look, if you want to die,

585
00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.209
I'll accept your decision for whatever reason. As long

586
00:28:05.209 --> 00:28:08.489
as it's an informed and rational decision. You don't

587
00:28:08.489 --> 00:28:11.250
need a doctor, you don't need anyone to stand

588
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.199
there, you can do it yourself, you just gotta

589
00:28:13.199 --> 00:28:14.890
have the way, you've got to know, you gotta

590
00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:16.770
have the information, and you've got to have the

591
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:19.869
means. And if one's, if that's provided, which I

592
00:28:19.869 --> 00:28:22.420
think it should be provided, I think people live

593
00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.660
happier and longer lives, which is why we urge

594
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.430
most of our members, the average age of membership

595
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.910
to exit is 75. We urge members all around

596
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.150
the world, look, get the drugs, if you, if

597
00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.550
you're thinking of a drug, get the drugs, make

598
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.650
sure they're correct, test them, make sure that they're

599
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.040
pure, put them in the cupboard, lock them away

600
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.640
and hope you never need them. And that'll put

601
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.119
you into position where you don't have to worry

602
00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:51.810
about what's happening with these pieces of legislation with

603
00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.329
all their safeguards and conditions which are coming in

604
00:28:54.329 --> 00:28:55.119
around the world.

605
00:28:56.729 --> 00:28:59.900
But do you think that if people have uh

606
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.449
the pills, the drugs at home in the cupboard,

607
00:29:03.819 --> 00:29:07.890
there's a risk that in an act of impulsivity,

608
00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:11.569
they might take the drugs and end their lives

609
00:29:11.819 --> 00:29:13.619
just impulsively.

610
00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:16.520
Well, it's possible. I mean, I, I guess that's

611
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.930
true of me. I mean, I've got the drugs.

612
00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.359
I've had them for the last 30 years, and

613
00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:21.810
they're in the cupboard, and I suppose if I

614
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.079
woke up, uh, and felt in a really bad

615
00:29:24.079 --> 00:29:25.439
state, I could go to the cupboard and I

616
00:29:25.439 --> 00:29:26.989
can do it at the end of this interview

617
00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:29.439
and end my life. Um, BUT I haven't done

618
00:29:29.439 --> 00:29:31.630
it so far. I feel quite good that I

619
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.640
could, I, I've got this choice if I wanted

620
00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.939
to. So this idea that we've got to people

621
00:29:35.939 --> 00:29:38.939
from themselves is the question. I don't need protecting

622
00:29:38.939 --> 00:29:41.380
from myself. I want the drugs and I've got

623
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.859
them. I can't imagine why you wouldn't want the

624
00:29:43.859 --> 00:29:45.540
drugs, and I would say that you should get

625
00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.140
them and put them in the cupboard. So is

626
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.619
there a risk that you might have a bad

627
00:29:48.619 --> 00:29:50.500
day, wake up and think, oh my God, luckily,

628
00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.140
I've got something in the cupboard and go and

629
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.650
kill yourself. It's a risk, I suppose, but what

630
00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:59.199
you will do is benefit. Generally, from knowing day

631
00:29:59.199 --> 00:30:02.079
after day, month after month, year after year that

632
00:30:02.079 --> 00:30:05.150
you have control, doesn't matter what the law says,

633
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.530
you have that control, it's in the cupboard.

634
00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.170
So it's a matter of control then.

635
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.119
It is, and that control makes you feel more

636
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:18.199
comfortable, and I would argue, less inclined to precipitous

637
00:30:18.849 --> 00:30:22.170
action. And probably, we see a lot of evidence

638
00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:25.329
of this, a happier person, when you're in control

639
00:30:25.329 --> 00:30:27.410
and one who lives longer. So it's a paradox

640
00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.369
that having lethal drugs in the cupboard actually means

641
00:30:30.369 --> 00:30:32.329
that people generally live longer.

642
00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:37.810
Mhm. Uh, WHAT do you think about, uh, voluntary

643
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:43.250
euthanasia laws in countries like the Netherlands where you're

644
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:47.609
based in right now, and Switzerland, which if, as

645
00:30:47.609 --> 00:30:51.089
far as I understand, is the country with the

646
00:30:51.089 --> 00:30:54.890
more progressive laws in the, on the planet.

647
00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:59.130
Yes, I mean, the laws since that first legislation

648
00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:01.130
I worked with back in the Northern Territory, and

649
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.310
as I said, Oregon came a year later, they've

650
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:07.310
predominantly all been the same. Uh, WHICH are medical

651
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.020
laws, in other words, you've got to wait till

652
00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.050
you're very sick, often terminally ill. You've then got

653
00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.199
to go off and see a doctor, usually several

654
00:31:14.199 --> 00:31:17.459
doctors, to convince them that you are indeed dying,

655
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.430
and then maybe they will allow you to have

656
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.030
access to the drugs that might bring about your

657
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.989
end of life. The one except they're medical laws

658
00:31:25.989 --> 00:31:29.270
where effectively it's a privilege doled out to people

659
00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:33.930
that are sick enough to be eligible. But, uh,

660
00:31:33.939 --> 00:31:36.689
Switzerland is unique. It's quite a separate situation where

661
00:31:36.689 --> 00:31:39.540
they actually enshrine the idea that this is a

662
00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.420
right. In other words, you don't have to be

663
00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.819
sick in Switzerland, you don't have to convince a

664
00:31:43.819 --> 00:31:47.380
doctor of anything other than that you have sound

665
00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.910
mind. And the idea of having a sound. Mind

666
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:53.349
or mental capacity is universal and so it should

667
00:31:53.349 --> 00:31:56.189
be, uh, as one of the requirements. But the

668
00:31:56.189 --> 00:31:58.790
idea that it doesn't have to be a privilege

669
00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.969
which other people will decide upon, is what is

670
00:32:01.969 --> 00:32:04.709
unique about Switzerland and why I totally support the

671
00:32:04.709 --> 00:32:05.430
Swiss model.

672
00:32:06.989 --> 00:32:11.099
So in Switzerland, uh, if I understand it correctly,

673
00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.380
and please correct me if I'm wrong, the only

674
00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:17.979
two criteria is that the person should be an

675
00:32:17.979 --> 00:32:21.209
adult and should have mental capacity.

676
00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:23.739
Is that correct? That's correct. Under Swiss law, that

677
00:32:23.739 --> 00:32:25.170
is the situation, yes.

678
00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:31.060
And, and what does having mental capacity mean? How

679
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.229
do you evaluate

680
00:32:32.229 --> 00:32:35.030
that? It's an interesting concept. I mean, it's, uh,

681
00:32:35.189 --> 00:32:39.109
it's, it's, it's a concept which comes up everyday

682
00:32:39.109 --> 00:32:41.420
living all the time. When you go and sign

683
00:32:41.949 --> 00:32:44.390
your name for a new bank account, people have

684
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.030
to decide when you make a will, they have

685
00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.880
to decide, do you know what you're doing? In

686
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.339
other words, have you got the ability to make

687
00:32:50.339 --> 00:32:54.079
rational decisions in your best interests? And there are

688
00:32:54.079 --> 00:32:57.670
some illnesses which mean that you lose mental capacity.

689
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.239
And of course the traditional one that people talk

690
00:33:00.239 --> 00:33:03.680
about commonly is dementia associated usually with a disease

691
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.959
like Alzheimer's disease, where a person loses the ability

692
00:33:06.959 --> 00:33:09.439
to make decisions in their best interests and so

693
00:33:09.439 --> 00:33:13.349
we say they have lost mental capacity. If you

694
00:33:13.349 --> 00:33:16.199
have mental capacity though, you can indeed open up

695
00:33:16.199 --> 00:33:19.280
a bank account, you can indeed stand in front

696
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.719
of a, uh, in a courtroom and give evidence

697
00:33:21.719 --> 00:33:25.199
under oath. And indeed, if you have mental capacity

698
00:33:25.199 --> 00:33:27.239
under some under the new laws that have come

699
00:33:27.239 --> 00:33:29.920
in in many countries, you need to have mental

700
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.239
capacity before you can authorize or ask for the

701
00:33:33.239 --> 00:33:35.160
help you would need to be able to end

702
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.319
your life. So mental capacity, it's a rather nebulous

703
00:33:38.319 --> 00:33:42.479
concept. Uh, PSYCHIATRISTS often argue that they're the only

704
00:33:42.479 --> 00:33:44.959
ones who can determine it, whether an individual has

705
00:33:44.959 --> 00:33:48.199
capacity or not. There are still many doctors who

706
00:33:48.199 --> 00:33:50.280
believe that if you've got any mental illness, you

707
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.000
don't have mental capacity. And there are plenty of

708
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.040
doctors who argue that if you're thinking of suicide,

709
00:33:55.119 --> 00:33:58.959
you certainly don't have mental capacity. So arguments rage

710
00:33:58.959 --> 00:34:02.790
about what constitutes mental capacity. But when we get

711
00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.719
people who come along and want help to die,

712
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.000
we do have to have mental capacity. So generally

713
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.590
speaking, That means I would take a person off

714
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:15.090
to see a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist will spend half

715
00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:17.889
an hour talking to them, and decide, yes, this

716
00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:20.489
person knows exactly what they're doing. They know it's

717
00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:23.449
a permanent step. They know it's irreversible. They know

718
00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:25.570
what they're planning and what effect it will have

719
00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:28.090
on others around them. I think this person has

720
00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:30.290
mental capacity and they sign a bit of paper.

721
00:34:30.918 --> 00:34:33.438
Now, that's a problem trying to find psychiatrists to

722
00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:35.478
do this. And so we've been working, and I've

723
00:34:35.478 --> 00:34:37.030
been spending a lot of time working on an

724
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:41.399
artificial intelligence assessment of mental capacity. Uh, I think

725
00:34:41.399 --> 00:34:42.840
it's a much, it's going to be a much

726
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.800
fairer way of doing it, but nevertheless, it is

727
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.239
a necessary criteria.

728
00:34:47.158 --> 00:34:51.349
Mhm. Uh, WHAT would you say are the ingredients

729
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:55.708
required for the successful passage of a law on

730
00:34:55.708 --> 00:34:59.099
voluntary euthanasia? So let's say that there are people

731
00:34:59.388 --> 00:35:03.668
in countries where euthanasia is not legal and they

732
00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:07.870
would be interested in trying to. Uh, PASS such

733
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:11.750
a law in parliament or some other place like

734
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:15.590
that. So, uh, I mean, what are, what are

735
00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.540
the steps that they can take?

736
00:35:17.989 --> 00:35:21.179
Well, we've seen this happen. It's been happening around

737
00:35:21.179 --> 00:35:24.110
the world that country after country after country have

738
00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:27.590
been arguing about this issue. The Northern Territory was

739
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:30.939
first. Oregon came in uh a year later. Then,

740
00:35:30.949 --> 00:35:33.149
of course, there was other states in America, there's

741
00:35:33.149 --> 00:35:37.939
Canada, and then there's, uh, Luxembourg, um, Netherlands, Belgium.

742
00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.350
All of these places are brought in laws, and

743
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.479
always they go through the same process where people

744
00:35:42.479 --> 00:35:45.590
will start talking to the poli those in, in

745
00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:47.750
control in the political process in the country we're

746
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:50.189
dealing with, and say we would like a law,

747
00:35:50.229 --> 00:35:52.110
and the general way it's pitched is that we

748
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.870
want some sort of a legislative process whereby a

749
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.939
person, Who is suffering can get help to die,

750
00:35:58.189 --> 00:36:02.310
and that invariably gets translated into something whereby a

751
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:05.520
law is, if you can argue well enough, politicians

752
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.820
agree that a law should be brought in which

753
00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:11.659
will allow and then the conditions start. And depending

754
00:36:11.659 --> 00:36:15.820
on how, uh, much, uh, pressure is under, the

755
00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.020
politicians find themselves under. They will either make it

756
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:22.429
extremely restrictive, or they will make it less restrictive.

757
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.939
But generally speaking, they have safeguard after safeguard after

758
00:36:25.939 --> 00:36:29.590
safeguard. So the wrong person doesn't get help to

759
00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:32.389
die. And generally speaking, that means you've got to

760
00:36:32.389 --> 00:36:36.070
be seriously, seriously ill, usually just about dead. You've

761
00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.149
got to get other people to determine that you

762
00:36:38.149 --> 00:36:40.270
are just about dead. In other words, doctor after

763
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:43.270
doctor after doctor sign, sign, sign. Then you have

764
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.979
to go through waiting periods. You then have to

765
00:36:45.979 --> 00:36:47.750
decide whether you're in the right place. You can't

766
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.830
go from one country to another and use their

767
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:52.550
laws, all sorts of conditions come in. But if

768
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:56.949
you satisfy, satisfy, satisfy, satisfy, and they're just about

769
00:36:56.949 --> 00:37:00.879
dead, Then generally speaking, with these new what we

770
00:37:00.879 --> 00:37:04.169
call medicalized laws, a doctor will say, OK, you

771
00:37:04.169 --> 00:37:07.199
satisfy all the criteria, you've gone through the waiting

772
00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:10.469
period, here are the drugs, but you must take

773
00:37:10.469 --> 00:37:12.639
them yourself. And then you can take the drugs

774
00:37:12.639 --> 00:37:16.590
and die. So that's generally speaking, the process is

775
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:21.159
one of lobbying politicians, and depending on how anxious

776
00:37:21.159 --> 00:37:24.629
the politicians are. The level of safeguards and the

777
00:37:24.629 --> 00:37:27.909
restrictions that they decide to introduce increases, and we're

778
00:37:27.909 --> 00:37:30.669
watching this play out right now in the United

779
00:37:30.669 --> 00:37:34.739
Kingdom, where they're debating this, uh, legislation, that's finally,

780
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:36.629
it's gone through the lower house, it's out in

781
00:37:36.629 --> 00:37:39.510
the House of Lords, and they're determining whether or

782
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:43.149
not it's restrictive enough, so that the wrong persons

783
00:37:43.149 --> 00:37:45.830
don't get any assistance. And it's one of the

784
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:48.469
most restrictive pieces of law I've ever seen planned

785
00:37:48.469 --> 00:37:51.219
in the world. I'll be surprised if anyone ever

786
00:37:51.219 --> 00:37:53.739
gets to use it, it's so restrictive, but certainly

787
00:37:53.739 --> 00:37:55.489
the wrong people will never get to use it,

788
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.860
whatever the wrong people are, but that's the sort

789
00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.300
of political process that people have to go through.

790
00:38:01.919 --> 00:38:06.239
So tell us about this fascinating new device, the

791
00:38:06.239 --> 00:38:10.989
suicide pod or the sarco pod. Where is it,

792
00:38:11.169 --> 00:38:14.080
uh, how it, how does it work, and I

793
00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.600
mean, can it already be used for the purposes

794
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.520
of assisted suicide?

795
00:38:19.879 --> 00:38:22.840
Yes, it's it's designed to help people with an

796
00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:26.840
assisted suicide, and it's designed with uh specifically to

797
00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.669
try and Get around this problem of uh trying

798
00:38:30.669 --> 00:38:33.870
to always having to get permission from uh some

799
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.469
authority to be able to take this step. And

800
00:38:36.469 --> 00:38:38.310
in countries that have brought in laws such as

801
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:40.229
here in the Netherlands, you've got to find a

802
00:38:40.229 --> 00:38:42.669
doctor who will give you access to the best

803
00:38:42.669 --> 00:38:45.909
drugs which are heavily restricted. So the idea of

804
00:38:45.909 --> 00:38:49.580
building a device that doesn't use heavily restricted drugs,

805
00:38:49.669 --> 00:38:51.510
so effectively you don't have to go off and

806
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:53.909
seek permission. And you don't have to wait till

807
00:38:53.909 --> 00:38:56.149
you're terminally ill or suffering enough to get a

808
00:38:56.149 --> 00:38:59.479
Dutch doctor to agree with you. We decided to

809
00:38:59.479 --> 00:39:02.300
build a device, and that was one that uses

810
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.310
gas, which is not restricted. And we decided to

811
00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:08.629
use the inert gas nitrogen. And the plan is

812
00:39:08.629 --> 00:39:10.909
that, of course, it's a way that people for

813
00:39:10.909 --> 00:39:13.020
many years have used to end their lives when

814
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.899
they wish, in other words, decision to die themselves,

815
00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:20.060
without any access to hard to get drugs or,

816
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:23.669
Any other support or knowledge, they've known that if

817
00:39:23.669 --> 00:39:26.189
you suddenly put yourself into an environment where there

818
00:39:26.189 --> 00:39:29.929
is no oxygen, It's a very peaceful day. Perhaps

819
00:39:29.929 --> 00:39:32.649
that's surprising to people. Many people think that's surprising.

820
00:39:32.689 --> 00:39:35.179
Wouldn't it be awful? But it's not, actually. But,

821
00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.689
so what people have done for years is that

822
00:39:37.689 --> 00:39:40.770
they've filled up plastic bags with some inert gas,

823
00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.520
usually something like helium or nitrogen, where there's no

824
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.689
oxygen. And they've suddenly put the plastic bag full

825
00:39:47.689 --> 00:39:50.010
of that gas which has no oxygen over their

826
00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:53.199
head and breathe deeply. And what that does is

827
00:39:53.199 --> 00:39:56.760
replace the gas in your lungs, which is air,

828
00:39:56.959 --> 00:39:59.810
which has 20% oxygen in it, and the rest

829
00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:04.320
is nitrogen. You're replacing that with 100% nitrogen, so

830
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.219
there is no oxygen in your lungs. The blood

831
00:40:07.219 --> 00:40:09.600
comes up past your lungs, on its way to

832
00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.070
your brain to take that oxygen, which is stuck

833
00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:15.479
onto the red blood cells through the hemoglobin. And

834
00:40:15.689 --> 00:40:17.929
suddenly there's no oxygen in your lungs, so there's

835
00:40:17.929 --> 00:40:20.000
nothing for the blood to take to your brain.

836
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:24.889
Your brain has no oxygen, known as hypoxia. Cerebral

837
00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:27.649
hypoxia, your brain has a very low oxygen. It

838
00:40:27.649 --> 00:40:30.090
needs oxygen, and so your brain starts to switch

839
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:33.649
off important functions. And the first one is that

840
00:40:33.649 --> 00:40:36.729
you lose consciousness. In other words, you faint. So

841
00:40:36.729 --> 00:40:40.479
usually after two deep breaths of pure nitrogen, getting

842
00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:42.679
rid of all the oxygen out of your lungs,

843
00:40:42.969 --> 00:40:46.739
you quickly faint. And while you're unconscious, you keep

844
00:40:46.739 --> 00:40:50.149
on breathing easily with a plastic bag full of

845
00:40:50.149 --> 00:40:53.429
nitrogen over your head and your oxygen level at

846
00:40:53.429 --> 00:40:55.750
0, and you die in 5 or so minutes.

847
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.179
So that's the process. It's been used for many,

848
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.510
many years, but people don't like the idea of

849
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:03.070
a plastic bag. They say, I don't like all

850
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.909
this equipment with cylinder of gas and a tube

851
00:41:05.909 --> 00:41:08.030
and a regulator and a plastic bag. I don't

852
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.669
want to be found like that. In which case,

853
00:41:10.709 --> 00:41:14.030
I say, well, Why don't we make something that

854
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.790
looks a bit more elegant, something a little more

855
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.379
stylish, and so the decision to build the 3D

856
00:41:19.379 --> 00:41:23.830
printed saco. Uh, CAME about, it's really a way

857
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:26.389
of making a glorified plastic bag, if you like,

858
00:41:26.399 --> 00:41:30.189
you climb in. To this 3D capsule, it looks

859
00:41:30.189 --> 00:41:32.679
like a vehicle which is going somewhere, it's not

860
00:41:32.679 --> 00:41:34.070
going anywhere, but it looks like it, you can

861
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.989
take it to that nice place where you can

862
00:41:35.989 --> 00:41:38.830
lawfully end your life because suicide is not a

863
00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:42.479
crime. Press the button inside the capsule. You close

864
00:41:42.479 --> 00:41:44.800
the capsule, wave goodbye to all your friends. Close

865
00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.120
the capsule, Press the button, and what that does

866
00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:52.840
is suddenly flood that capsule with replacing the air

867
00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.280
which you're breathing with pure nitrogen, so that there's

868
00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.800
suddenly you're breathing, but there's no oxygen, and you

869
00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.600
faint quickly and die in the capsule. So that's

870
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.560
the, uh, that's the process. It's work, uh, it

871
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.729
took some time to get it. Operational. It looks

872
00:42:07.729 --> 00:42:10.969
very good. It's been used once in Chapels and

873
00:42:10.969 --> 00:42:14.489
in Switzerland, and that's upset, uh, the Swiss authorities

874
00:42:14.489 --> 00:42:16.320
to the extent which they're still trying to work

875
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.320
out whether or not any crime was committed. Uh,

876
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.649
WE'RE not sure why they are even thinking that

877
00:42:21.649 --> 00:42:23.570
there could have been, but that's what they're arguing

878
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.969
about now, and the device itself remains confiscated by

879
00:42:26.969 --> 00:42:30.409
the Swiss authorities, but, We're building another one, and

880
00:42:30.409 --> 00:42:32.370
I think that for many people they see this

881
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.010
as something which is really desirable, as I said,

882
00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.770
it stops you having to go around and try

883
00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:40.649
and get access to these heavily restricted drugs because

884
00:42:40.649 --> 00:42:43.449
of course nitrogen is everywhere and it can't be

885
00:42:43.449 --> 00:42:44.050
restricted.

886
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:49.580
Right, but then, uh, this device is activated by

887
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:53.090
the person herself from the interior. Is

888
00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:54.580
that right? That's true. That's true. The only way

889
00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:57.129
it can be activated is by pressing the button

890
00:42:57.129 --> 00:43:00.659
inside. Uh, WE expect now to modify the new

891
00:43:00.659 --> 00:43:02.860
one which is being printed now whereby you'll have

892
00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.659
to pass a mental capacity test. Uh, AND that

893
00:43:05.659 --> 00:43:08.139
will allow power to switch onto the capsule, so

894
00:43:08.139 --> 00:43:10.020
you can't press the button until you've carried out

895
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.219
a mental capacity test. And when you press that

896
00:43:12.219 --> 00:43:15.760
button, Within 30 seconds, the oxygen level has dropped

897
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.370
from the normal 21% in the air we're breathing

898
00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:21.330
now down to less than 0.5%, and you'll die

899
00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:21.959
very quickly.

900
00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.139
Mhm. Yes, I asked you that because I was

901
00:43:25.139 --> 00:43:28.090
wondering what do you think should be the role,

902
00:43:28.219 --> 00:43:32.010
if any, of the physician when it comes to

903
00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:36.219
assisted suicide? Because if I understand it correctly, sometimes

904
00:43:36.219 --> 00:43:40.689
it seems that people want someone else to share

905
00:43:40.689 --> 00:43:44.290
in the decision making. And so, uh, possibly some

906
00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:47.945
people would want another. Person to activate the pod

907
00:43:47.945 --> 00:43:51.475
or in, in cases where they would have an

908
00:43:51.475 --> 00:43:55.635
injection to kill them if they would want someone

909
00:43:55.635 --> 00:43:59.074
else to do that. So what do you think

910
00:43:59.074 --> 00:43:59.774
about that? Yeah,

911
00:44:00.235 --> 00:44:02.514
it worries me. I mean, you're right, many people

912
00:44:02.514 --> 00:44:04.834
do say that. They say, oh, I want someone

913
00:44:04.834 --> 00:44:08.064
there. I want or I want the injection rather

914
00:44:08.064 --> 00:44:10.475
than a drink. It's as if they want someone

915
00:44:10.475 --> 00:44:13.209
to do it to them. Now I'm thinking to

916
00:44:13.209 --> 00:44:16.290
myself, well, look, it's your desk. You've got to

917
00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:19.250
take responsibility. This idea that you're trying to share

918
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:22.530
in that decision making with another individual, possibly a

919
00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:25.209
doctor, is, I think, something which needs to be

920
00:44:25.209 --> 00:44:27.530
looked at quite closely because what you seem to

921
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.090
be doing is saying, I can't make up my

922
00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:32.310
own mind, I want someone to share in the

923
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:36.570
decision-making process. Now I'm quite happy, To provide support

924
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:40.399
and to accept a person's decision. But I do

925
00:44:40.399 --> 00:44:44.449
not want to be made co-decision maker with a

926
00:44:44.449 --> 00:44:46.500
person wishing to die. If you want to die,

927
00:44:46.969 --> 00:44:49.370
you make the decision. Now, you don't need help,

928
00:44:49.449 --> 00:44:51.729
you don't need someone there, you don't need an

929
00:44:51.729 --> 00:44:54.770
injection and someone pressing the syringe. The reason I

930
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:56.709
built the first machine I did, which is now

931
00:44:56.709 --> 00:45:00.330
in the British Museum, uh, Science Museum in London.

932
00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:04.050
Is because I thought I could go around to

933
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:07.270
that man's place. This was in Darwin in 1996

934
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:10.590
and give a lethal injection. The man dying of

935
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:13.350
prostate cancer, Bob Dent said, come around for lunch,

936
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:16.459
I'll die in the afternoon. And I thought, right,

937
00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:18.780
well, I could sit there and push the plunger

938
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.739
after getting a needle into a vein and he

939
00:45:20.739 --> 00:45:23.219
would die at the end of the needle. But

940
00:45:23.219 --> 00:45:26.209
I didn't see why I should become an executioner,

941
00:45:26.739 --> 00:45:28.620
and I couldn't see why I should have to

942
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.899
do that. He wanted to die, I accepted and

943
00:45:31.899 --> 00:45:36.129
supported his decision. But he shouldn't, and he didn't

944
00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.580
expect or insist that I be part of that

945
00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.699
process in a mechanical sense. So that's why I

946
00:45:41.699 --> 00:45:44.000
built the machine. So he pressed the button. He

947
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.379
looked at the questions on the laptop and pressed

948
00:45:46.379 --> 00:45:49.129
the button, and the machine ended his life. So,

949
00:45:49.219 --> 00:45:51.540
I'm a bit skeptical, and we've seen happening here

950
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:54.169
in the Netherlands over the last decade or so,

951
00:45:54.699 --> 00:45:58.340
more and more people when they get, uh, The

952
00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.260
right for help to die through Dutch law, have

953
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.850
asked to have an injection rather than a drink.

954
00:46:05.219 --> 00:46:06.850
Now, it's the same drug, and you can drink

955
00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:08.459
it and you'll die, you can have it injected

956
00:46:08.459 --> 00:46:11.580
and you'll die. But our concern, my concern, and

957
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.310
many of the doctors I talked to here in

958
00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:17.060
the Netherlands' concern is that effectively what people seem

959
00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.620
to be saying is we want some other person

960
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:23.199
to share in the process. And I'm skeptical about

961
00:46:23.199 --> 00:46:24.810
that, and I think in some ways that should

962
00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:27.090
be resisted. And I think you should be saying,

963
00:46:27.169 --> 00:46:29.500
yes, you have every right to do it, but

964
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.919
don't, you don't have a right, if you like,

965
00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:35.330
to try and involve other people in that decision

966
00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:37.159
making, and I would push back on that.

967
00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:42.169
What do you think about conscientious objection on the

968
00:46:42.169 --> 00:46:46.199
part of physicians when it comes particularly to assisted

969
00:46:46.199 --> 00:46:46.889
suicide?

970
00:46:47.729 --> 00:46:50.090
That's uh that's fine. I mean, I understand that

971
00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:54.229
many people will never accept. Uh, THAT a person

972
00:46:54.229 --> 00:46:56.610
has a right to divest themselves of this precious

973
00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:58.350
gift of life. I mean, if you believe that

974
00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:00.229
your life is a precious gift from God, and

975
00:47:00.229 --> 00:47:03.840
many people do, then, uh, only person or only

976
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.389
entity that can make this decision about the best

977
00:47:06.389 --> 00:47:10.629
of this precious gift is God. That argument is

978
00:47:10.629 --> 00:47:12.729
one that I get exposed to a lot. Now,

979
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.229
I don't mind if people hold those views. They're

980
00:47:15.229 --> 00:47:17.629
not my views. And I don't want them to

981
00:47:17.629 --> 00:47:20.169
try and push those views onto me. But if

982
00:47:20.169 --> 00:47:22.209
they want to hold them, that's OK by me.

983
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:24.479
And if you held those views, you would see

984
00:47:24.479 --> 00:47:27.209
that it's a crime to divest yourself of your

985
00:47:27.209 --> 00:47:30.250
life. And you wouldn't want to be participating in

986
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:33.879
or, uh, in, in any way assisting someone else

987
00:47:33.879 --> 00:47:36.330
to carry out what you see as some fundamental

988
00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:39.610
violation of God's law. And so it needs to

989
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:41.889
be, I think, supported, and so of course there

990
00:47:41.889 --> 00:47:45.800
should be a provision for people to, Uh, dissent

991
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.280
and have nothing to do with the process. And

992
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.810
that's effectively what is the case in the laws

993
00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:53.399
that are coming around the world. There's no obligation

994
00:47:53.399 --> 00:47:56.320
on the part of a doctor to participate in

995
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.870
these laws which require medical participation, and a person,

996
00:47:59.919 --> 00:48:02.120
a doctor, or for that matter, the person who

997
00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.639
prescribes the drugs or the nurses, but they can

998
00:48:04.639 --> 00:48:07.199
all effectively say, I want no part of it,

999
00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:11.159
that's fine. But they should not. As many of

1000
00:48:11.159 --> 00:48:13.510
them then do, argue that there should be no

1001
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:15.590
one taking part in this. If you believe in

1002
00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:17.629
it, of course you should take part in it.

1003
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:20.030
I believe in the process and I would support

1004
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:22.989
this idea of providing the means at any time

1005
00:48:22.989 --> 00:48:25.429
to a rational person wanting to make this decision.

1006
00:48:26.929 --> 00:48:31.050
Many times when people argue in favor of euthanasia

1007
00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:36.879
or specifically assisted suicide, they mentioned the importance of

1008
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:41.649
the patient's autonomy and self-determination. Uh, WHAT do you

1009
00:48:41.649 --> 00:48:46.840
think? About that, what does autonomy and self-determination mean

1010
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.510
in this particular context?

1011
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:51.280
Well, I think that's it is it's a person's

1012
00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.239
autonomy if you like, is that what I would,

1013
00:48:54.459 --> 00:48:57.909
I would argue is the important issue here. Uh,

1014
00:48:57.949 --> 00:49:01.709
THAT the individual must take responsibility for their own

1015
00:49:01.709 --> 00:49:04.189
life. They do this by eating when they feel

1016
00:49:04.189 --> 00:49:06.639
hungry. They do this by drinking when they're thirsty,

1017
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:10.989
they sleep. They're taking responsibility for the necessary requirements

1018
00:49:10.989 --> 00:49:13.300
of keeping their life in existence, and I think

1019
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.709
they should take responsibility for this decision about when

1020
00:49:16.709 --> 00:49:18.669
they decide that they do not wish to keep

1021
00:49:18.669 --> 00:49:22.110
on living. So, that idea of personal responsibility and

1022
00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:25.310
taking control of that process is something we accept.

1023
00:49:25.899 --> 00:49:28.429
Uh, AND I think, a natural, I would say

1024
00:49:28.429 --> 00:49:31.379
a fundamental extension of that option or that right,

1025
00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:34.189
or that obligation to stay on this planet is

1026
00:49:34.189 --> 00:49:37.219
the, uh, acceptance of a person's ability to make

1027
00:49:37.219 --> 00:49:39.669
a decision that now is the time that I

1028
00:49:39.669 --> 00:49:42.370
wish to divest myself of this precious gift. So,

1029
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:45.429
uh, that idea of personal responsibility, I think is

1030
00:49:45.429 --> 00:49:48.540
fairly fundamental, and it's one that we enshrine. And

1031
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.820
accept without any question when it comes to all

1032
00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.979
of the other aspects of life. But when we

1033
00:49:52.979 --> 00:49:55.699
come to this one decision, that is the one

1034
00:49:55.699 --> 00:49:57.850
about whether or not we wish to die, suddenly,

1035
00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.979
we find ourselves surrounded by all this concern, opposition,

1036
00:50:00.989 --> 00:50:05.010
and criticism. It is changing. More and more places

1037
00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:08.060
are accepting that this is the way things are

1038
00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:10.830
changing. I think new technologies are going to make

1039
00:50:11.229 --> 00:50:13.570
The world a different place. It's true, for example,

1040
00:50:13.659 --> 00:50:16.510
that if we all had access to some simple

1041
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:19.419
substance which would give us a peaceful death, one

1042
00:50:19.419 --> 00:50:21.520
can speculate on how that would change the world

1043
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.629
we live in. I suspect that it'd make the

1044
00:50:23.629 --> 00:50:25.620
world a happier place. So I, we are getting

1045
00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:28.020
to the stage with new technologies where more and

1046
00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:32.530
more options will become available. And people will find

1047
00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:37.179
themselves impaired by this new availability which hadn't previously

1048
00:50:37.179 --> 00:50:37.570
existed.

1049
00:50:38.959 --> 00:50:41.989
So earlier when I asked you about the criteria

1050
00:50:41.989 --> 00:50:45.330
for assisted suicide, and I, we talked a little

1051
00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:50.409
bit about uh assessing mental capacity. You mentioned that

1052
00:50:50.409 --> 00:50:54.050
many times the state determines that it should be

1053
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:59.080
assessed by psychiatrists and then if they are presented

1054
00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:04.350
with someone who's, who's wanting to end their lives,

1055
00:51:04.409 --> 00:51:08.709
they medicalize the issue and they deny them. Uh,

1056
00:51:08.739 --> 00:51:12.610
MENTAL capacity or if the person has already been

1057
00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:18.100
diagnosed with some mental illness, they also, uh, deny

1058
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:23.219
them mental capacity because they say or they claim

1059
00:51:23.219 --> 00:51:28.500
that uh the mental illness itself, uh, affects the

1060
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:32.939
person's decision making. Do you find that psychiatrists in

1061
00:51:32.939 --> 00:51:37.570
general are opposed to assisted suicide and if so,

1062
00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:38.100
why?

1063
00:51:38.919 --> 00:51:40.419
No, it's not a, I wouldn't say it was

1064
00:51:40.419 --> 00:51:42.899
general, but it is, uh, it is a problem

1065
00:51:42.899 --> 00:51:45.340
because, as I said, that view around that if

1066
00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:48.260
you've got a mental illness, you can't have mental

1067
00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.939
capacity. It's almost as if they are intrinsically linked.

1068
00:51:51.979 --> 00:51:54.699
Now that idea does persist, and it does persist

1069
00:51:54.699 --> 00:51:57.939
in some areas of psychiatry, although by no means

1070
00:51:57.939 --> 00:52:01.540
is that universal. We've generally been able to find

1071
00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:06.110
psychiatrists who do certainly accept the idea of rational

1072
00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:10.199
suicide. Generally speaking, they see that as being associated

1073
00:52:10.199 --> 00:52:13.120
in situations where there's a considerable degree of suffering,

1074
00:52:13.159 --> 00:52:16.439
usually from some form of physical illness, although there

1075
00:52:16.439 --> 00:52:19.000
are plenty of psychiatrists around who understand that there

1076
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.469
are non-medical reasons, uh, that can bring about, if

1077
00:52:22.469 --> 00:52:25.750
you like, existential suffering and that that should still

1078
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.120
not preclude one from taking this step because that

1079
00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:32.620
person will have mental capacity, but, It is an

1080
00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.620
issue, and that's why we're putting quite a lot,

1081
00:52:34.659 --> 00:52:36.939
and because you can take, and I often find

1082
00:52:36.939 --> 00:52:39.179
myself in this situation of taking the same person

1083
00:52:39.179 --> 00:52:42.360
to 4 different psychiatrists and getting 5 different answers

1084
00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:45.699
about what whether they've got capacity or not, that

1085
00:52:45.699 --> 00:52:48.149
I'm really hopeful and got a lot of, uh,

1086
00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:51.699
A lot of expectation for a development of an

1087
00:52:51.699 --> 00:52:55.419
artificial intelligence assessment of what this nebulous quality of

1088
00:52:55.419 --> 00:52:58.969
capacity actually means. Something that you can actually test

1089
00:52:58.969 --> 00:53:01.419
in a person and you either have it or

1090
00:53:01.419 --> 00:53:03.969
you don't have it. Now, I, I'm not saying

1091
00:53:03.969 --> 00:53:05.489
that if you have it today, you'll have it

1092
00:53:05.489 --> 00:53:07.739
tomorrow, but you could have it now, and if

1093
00:53:07.739 --> 00:53:09.610
you've got it now, and you're an adult, we're

1094
00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:11.850
not talking about children, we're talking about adults who

1095
00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:14.520
know about the permanence of death. I would argue

1096
00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.729
then you've got every right when you have mental

1097
00:53:16.729 --> 00:53:20.219
capacity as an adult, to say, now's the time

1098
00:53:20.219 --> 00:53:20.729
to die.

1099
00:53:21.929 --> 00:53:24.850
Uh, IF I remember correctly earlier when we talked

1100
00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:28.209
about mental capacity, you said that you were working

1101
00:53:28.209 --> 00:53:32.120
on developing some sort of AI tool to assess

1102
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:34.639
mental capacity. Could you tell us a little bit

1103
00:53:34.639 --> 00:53:37.850
more about that? How would it be assessed through

1104
00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:38.409
AI?

1105
00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:41.889
It's a, it's a, it's a situation which effectively

1106
00:53:41.889 --> 00:53:44.969
mirrors the process which goes on when you uh

1107
00:53:44.969 --> 00:53:46.949
go and see a psychiatrist, you sit down and

1108
00:53:46.949 --> 00:53:48.969
they talk to you and they ask you about

1109
00:53:48.969 --> 00:53:51.850
uh your understanding of death, that do you know

1110
00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:54.250
about its permanence? Do you know that it will

1111
00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:56.560
have an impact if you die on people around

1112
00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.399
you, what do you think your family's going to

1113
00:53:58.399 --> 00:54:01.489
think? There's a whole heap of uh questions that

1114
00:54:01.489 --> 00:54:05.729
they talk with you about to get a fairly

1115
00:54:05.729 --> 00:54:09.929
clear idea that you understand exactly, What is involved

1116
00:54:09.929 --> 00:54:11.929
here. For example, if you saw a person who's

1117
00:54:11.929 --> 00:54:15.820
been seriously affected by an illness which makes, which

1118
00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:19.280
does deprive you of mental capacity, such as dementia,

1119
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:22.530
you couldn't carry out such a conversation. Such a

1120
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:25.649
conversation would simply be impossible. They would have no

1121
00:54:25.649 --> 00:54:28.610
idea of what the the concept of death and

1122
00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:33.570
dying, so. The artificial intelligence will effectively replace that

1123
00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:36.189
discussion that you have now with a psychiatrist with

1124
00:54:36.189 --> 00:54:38.530
one where you'll have it with the avatar. The

1125
00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:41.050
avatar will ask you all sorts of questions. Listen

1126
00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:44.530
to your answers, interpret those answers and lead on

1127
00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:47.649
to future interpretive questions to make sure that it

1128
00:54:47.649 --> 00:54:50.810
draws out from you in the conversation, the full

1129
00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:54.879
aspect of your understanding. A person who's got significant

1130
00:54:54.879 --> 00:54:57.679
dementia and has no mental capacity will be picked

1131
00:54:57.679 --> 00:55:01.080
very quickly by the avatar. The avatar then will

1132
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.879
make the decision through a series of criteria and

1133
00:55:03.879 --> 00:55:07.399
come out yes or no. Now, what we will

1134
00:55:07.399 --> 00:55:09.479
do as far as the Parco is concerned, the

1135
00:55:09.479 --> 00:55:12.199
divisive job build is that that yes or no

1136
00:55:12.439 --> 00:55:14.639
will then allow the power to switch onto the

1137
00:55:14.639 --> 00:55:17.360
sarco for the next 24 hours. But the idea

1138
00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:19.840
of having a mental capacity test to replace a

1139
00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:22.959
psychiatrist, I think, is something which is, Will be

1140
00:55:22.959 --> 00:55:27.520
a very welcome, uh welcome initiative and change, I

1141
00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:30.199
understand people have said, what about bias, which may

1142
00:55:30.199 --> 00:55:33.610
be, may be built into the interrogation by the

1143
00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:36.919
by the avatar, I understand that. But right now

1144
00:55:36.919 --> 00:55:39.679
we've got bias which is built into the psychiatrists

1145
00:55:39.679 --> 00:55:42.600
who bring their own baggage, their own personal philosophies

1146
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.989
to this issue, and often judge people, in effect,

1147
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:48.679
in ways which are predetermined by their own, if

1148
00:55:48.679 --> 00:55:52.399
you like, religious or philosophical or political beliefs. So

1149
00:55:52.399 --> 00:55:54.479
there are issues here, but I'm sure it's gonna

1150
00:55:54.479 --> 00:55:57.360
be faster and better than the current assessment we

1151
00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:57.790
use.

1152
00:55:59.219 --> 00:56:03.060
Do you think that suicide should be prevented?

1153
00:56:04.689 --> 00:56:06.810
No, I, I don't think it should be prevented.

1154
00:56:06.889 --> 00:56:08.969
I'm not, I don't think it should be encouraged

1155
00:56:08.969 --> 00:56:11.459
or discouraged. I, I think we should accept that

1156
00:56:11.459 --> 00:56:14.250
it's a, it, it's a it's a phenomenon, as

1157
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:16.449
I said, it seems to me about as relevant

1158
00:56:16.449 --> 00:56:18.899
as being able to give back a precious gift.

1159
00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:22.129
It needs to be accepted. It exists, it will

1160
00:56:22.129 --> 00:56:24.760
always exist. Uh, AND I don't think you should,

1161
00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:27.320
we should be objecting to it or fighting against

1162
00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:29.939
it. I think what we should try to do

1163
00:56:29.939 --> 00:56:33.739
is to try and minimize people who have, who

1164
00:56:33.739 --> 00:56:37.340
lose mental capacity, and then take steps to end

1165
00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.689
their own lives. That is a serious enough issue.

1166
00:56:39.899 --> 00:56:42.419
And that happens a lot. And it needs to

1167
00:56:42.419 --> 00:56:45.020
be, efforts need to be put into finding such

1168
00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:48.290
people and finding ways in which their mental capacity

1169
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:51.340
can be re-established so that they don't decide to

1170
00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.649
take this step unless it's a valid, rational one.

1171
00:56:54.979 --> 00:56:57.860
Now, that's an issue. Uh, BUT this idea that

1172
00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:00.479
the suicides that are occurring around the world are

1173
00:57:00.479 --> 00:57:03.790
all due to failing mental capacity is simply false.

1174
00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.030
And that needs to be accepted that there will

1175
00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:07.459
always be a group of people who come to

1176
00:57:07.459 --> 00:57:10.469
a rational decision. And when I make that rational

1177
00:57:10.469 --> 00:57:12.429
decision that now's the time I want to die,

1178
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:17.159
I want my views respected. And uh my decision

1179
00:57:17.159 --> 00:57:20.040
to take this step, uh, acknowledged as being a

1180
00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.830
valid and viable one, and not to be encouraged,

1181
00:57:22.959 --> 00:57:25.320
but certainly not to have obstacles put in my

1182
00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:25.770
path.

1183
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:30.330
So I have one final question then. How do

1184
00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:34.500
you look at the future of assisted suicide, both

1185
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:38.689
in terms of law and in terms of technological

1186
00:57:38.689 --> 00:57:39.719
advancements?

1187
00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:43.570
They, they are, yes, they're both, they're they're undergoing

1188
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:46.409
a lot of change. Uh, I mentioned now we're

1189
00:57:46.409 --> 00:57:48.610
seeing a spate of laws coming in around the

1190
00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:51.449
world which are of these medicalized nature where we

1191
00:57:51.449 --> 00:57:55.030
try to define a level of suffering. These laws,

1192
00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:58.320
generally speaking, come into existence and are immediately challenged

1193
00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:00.360
within the courts, a person will say, well, I'm

1194
00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:03.060
suffering, you say I'm not suffering enough, I say

1195
00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:05.479
I am suffering enough, and so the questions about

1196
00:58:05.479 --> 00:58:07.919
degree of suffering will find their ways, working their

1197
00:58:07.919 --> 00:58:12.010
way through the courts. And slowly legislation will change.

1198
00:58:12.219 --> 00:58:14.139
In the case of the Netherlands, there's been a

1199
00:58:14.139 --> 00:58:17.689
series of situations where the laws, medical laws here

1200
00:58:17.689 --> 00:58:20.179
have been loosened up to some degree, but they've

1201
00:58:20.179 --> 00:58:23.739
certainly not freed up completely, and they're nowhere like

1202
00:58:23.739 --> 00:58:26.979
laws that Switzerland have, which actually enshrine this option

1203
00:58:26.979 --> 00:58:29.300
as a human right. So, I would like to

1204
00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:32.504
see laws rather than coming in. Radicalized and then

1205
00:58:32.504 --> 00:58:35.985
have to go through this protracted legal process to

1206
00:58:35.985 --> 00:58:38.625
free them up and make them more workable, that

1207
00:58:38.625 --> 00:58:42.584
people would initiate legislation which enshrines suicide as a

1208
00:58:42.584 --> 00:58:45.625
human right, like the Swiss law. I spent a

1209
00:58:45.625 --> 00:58:49.185
lot of time running around talking to parliamentary inquiries,

1210
00:58:49.264 --> 00:58:51.945
looking at new laws, arguing, for goodness sake, don't

1211
00:58:51.945 --> 00:58:55.050
make them the same mistakes we did. Look closely

1212
00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:57.850
at Switzerland and bring in a law that enshrines

1213
00:58:57.850 --> 00:58:59.840
this as a human right. So that's what I'm

1214
00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:01.939
hoping will happen. I don't see much evidence of

1215
00:59:01.939 --> 00:59:04.209
it, especially as I watch what's being played out

1216
00:59:04.209 --> 00:59:06.770
in the United Kingdom right now, where a very,

1217
00:59:06.889 --> 00:59:09.409
very, very medicalized law with a lot and lot

1218
00:59:09.409 --> 00:59:12.169
and a lot of restrictions is coming in. That's

1219
00:59:12.169 --> 00:59:16.449
the, that's the legislative political process. Technologically though, things

1220
00:59:16.449 --> 00:59:19.850
are changing too, because if people have access to

1221
00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:23.120
the means, laws become irrelevant. It doesn't matter what

1222
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.840
the law says, if you've got something in the

1223
00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.520
cupboard, you don't care what the law says, because

1224
00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:28.959
you know that if I get to that point,

1225
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.959
I'll go to the cupboard. I won't go off

1226
00:59:30.959 --> 00:59:32.929
finding trying to find a doctor who agrees with

1227
00:59:32.929 --> 00:59:35.699
me. I'll simply go to the cupboard. And that

1228
00:59:35.699 --> 00:59:38.250
is what's happening too. There are new strategies, new

1229
00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:40.899
initiatives. We're putting quite a lot of effort into

1230
00:59:40.899 --> 00:59:43.610
new initiatives and strategies where people will all, hopefully,

1231
00:59:43.719 --> 00:59:46.419
I would argue in the too distant future, have

1232
00:59:46.419 --> 00:59:48.580
something in their own cupboard. And so all of

1233
00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:51.100
the argument and debate that we're going through now

1234
00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:53.889
will effectively be for nothing, because it will be,

1235
00:59:53.979 --> 00:59:55.300
as I said, irrelevant.

1236
00:59:57.030 --> 01:00:00.310
Great. So, Dr. Nitschke, I will be leaving a

1237
01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:03.590
link in the description to your books and to

1238
01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:08.229
Exit International. Apart from that, are there any other

1239
01:00:08.229 --> 01:00:11.469
places on the internet where people can find your

1240
01:00:11.469 --> 01:00:12.020
work?

1241
01:00:12.389 --> 01:00:14.830
Oh, I think that, uh, I think the uh

1242
01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:18.750
their main websites peaceful Pill.com and Xinternational.net are the

1243
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:21.550
main website, websites, so it's of course we adopt

1244
01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:26.350
the Facebook presence and a ex-presence and a And

1245
01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:29.899
they, uh, various other social media presences trying to,

1246
01:00:30.169 --> 01:00:33.219
I suppose, show people that changes are taking place

1247
01:00:33.219 --> 01:00:36.389
and to rekindle the investigation. We're running a, a

1248
01:00:36.389 --> 01:00:38.189
conference in Amsterdam at the end of the year

1249
01:00:38.189 --> 01:00:40.689
on new technologies for dying, and we're inviting people

1250
01:00:40.689 --> 01:00:42.070
to come along and look at some of these

1251
01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:44.870
strategies and see that this is a fast changing

1252
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:45.340
world.

1253
01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:50.250
Great, really fascinating. So, Doctor Nitschke, thank you so

1254
01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:52.350
much for taking the time to come on the

1255
01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:54.379
