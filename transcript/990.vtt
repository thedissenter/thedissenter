00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:02.910
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.690
Decent. I'm your host, as always Ricardo Lob. And

3
00:00:05.699 --> 00:00:08.439
today I'm joined by Dr Monte Johnson. He's a

4
00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.189
professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University

5
00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.710
of California, San Diego. He teaches and researches GRE

6
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.295
Roman philosophy and its influence on the history of

7
00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:23.024
philosophy and science. And today we're talking mostly about

8
00:00:23.034 --> 00:00:27.995
some aspects of the philosophy of Aristotle, democritus and

9
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.825
also Greek Roman philosophy. So Monte, welcome to the

10
00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:33.305
show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:36.549
It's a pleasure to be here. My, my favorite

12
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.340
thing to do, talk philosophy.

13
00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:41.020
And I guess that probably was

14
00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:43.180
with you. It's an honor to do it with

15
00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:44.299
you, Ricardo.

16
00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:47.580
Well, I really appreciate that. So, and I guess

17
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.900
that probably one of the things in philosophy that

18
00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.740
you love talking about the most would be Aristotle,

19
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.310
right? So, uh what got you interested in Aristotle

20
00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.099
to start off with? And what are perhaps some

21
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.349
of the aspects of his philosophy that interest you

22
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.220
the most? And then we can get into some

23
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.220
specifics here.

24
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.639
Well, uh give you, give you a tiny uh

25
00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:16.160
intellectual biography here. I actually started out uh getting,

26
00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:21.639
getting interested in Nietzsche uh in my Catholic high

27
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.629
school. Um AND I was reading Nietzsche and realized

28
00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:27.779
I don't understand anything he's talking about because all

29
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.610
of these Greek philosophers. So in, in college, I

30
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.839
need to study Greek philosophy so that I can

31
00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:36.019
sort of work my way through the history up

32
00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.029
to Nietzsche, which I really wanted to understand. But

33
00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.019
then I started doing Greek philosophy and um never

34
00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:47.839
got beyond it, found so many interesting things to

35
00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:50.110
do there that II I just sort of stalled

36
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.779
out in Greek philosophy, but you start doing Greek

37
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.169
philosophy and you realize, well, everybody keeps talking about

38
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.970
Aristotle and you've got to understand what's going on

39
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.290
with, with Aristotle, particularly if you wanna know the

40
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.279
earlier history of philosophy. So that's what initially interested

41
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.300
me in Aristotle was just trying to figure out

42
00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.600
what's going on with, with Greek philosophy in general.

43
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.259
And then I just found so many interesting things

44
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.699
within Aristotle that, that, that became all absorbing and,

45
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.899
and almost all of my other philosophical projects have,

46
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.940
you know, sort of started out with things that

47
00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:35.029
I, that I found in Aristotle and started investigating

48
00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:37.839
further and realized, OK, well, I need to understand

49
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.330
these criticisms he's making of materialism or whatever. So

50
00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:45.070
then you get further into democritus and epicurus and,

51
00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.889
and others and so on. So um it, it,

52
00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:54.089
it's really just because he's so um central to,

53
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.649
to, to Greek philosophy.

54
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.889
Yeah, you know, I left a little bit when

55
00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:03.070
you mentioned Nietzsche because back when I first read

56
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.589
Nietzsche, uh, a little bit prior to that, I

57
00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.490
had already read a little bit of Plato, but

58
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.850
then I started reading Nietzsche and I was like,

59
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.990
damn it. I have to go back and live

60
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.050
and read a little bit more of Greek philosophy.

61
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.190
Yeah, that's right. Even though, you know, he Nietzsche

62
00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:25.570
doesn't really say that much about Aristotle directly, as

63
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.300
much as he does about, about Plato and Socrates

64
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.610
and so forth. But, you know, if you're wondering

65
00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:34.619
what interests me, you know, my, my deeper interest

66
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.289
in Aristotle, like what, what I found when I

67
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.080
got there, I mean, one thing is that he's

68
00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:46.699
one of these philosophers that actually contributed massively to

69
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.309
science. Um And so, you know, the, the the

70
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.740
two areas he's most known for, there would be,

71
00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:59.289
you know, his logic and biology, basically two fields

72
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.210
of science that, that he completely founded and he

73
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.210
contributed to almost all other areas of science as

74
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.770
it was conceived in antiquity. Um But especially those

75
00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:17.410
those two, but also just his, his general approach

76
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.890
to science and, and conceiving of a kind of

77
00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:26.690
philosophy of science, almost a scientific method and his

78
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.950
treatment of his predecessors and kind of a development

79
00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:34.040
of a, of a dialectical method, almost like history

80
00:04:34.049 --> 00:04:38.279
of philosophy. Um All of all of those things

81
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.799
are, are so interesting even before you start talking

82
00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:46.579
about his subsequent influence on the history of science

83
00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:50.880
and the history of philosophy. Um SO that, you

84
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.350
know, even even today, largely the terminology that we're

85
00:04:55.359 --> 00:05:00.320
using in philosophy and to a, a pretty big

86
00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:04.429
extent, the formulation of problems that we still have

87
00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:08.899
um are are due to Aristotle. So, you know,

88
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.589
everything from, you know, the term metaphysics itself originally

89
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.609
conceived of as a, as a editorial term for

90
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.170
positioning works within his corpus. Um Two great problems

91
00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:26.730
I was looking at the uh there's a Oxford

92
00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:29.279
handbook of Metaphysics that came out a couple of

93
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.410
years ago and reading its introduction and the, the

94
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.149
editors tell us that uh there's this, this great

95
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.820
stuff happening in metaphysics now, like, you know, uh

96
00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:44.739
modal metaphysics and category theory and, and so on.

97
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.339
And it's like all these things that Aristotle, you

98
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.760
know, initially took up and, and, and gave us,

99
00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:54.660
gave us some of the first positions in. So,

100
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.440
you know, even if you're interested just in contemporary

101
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.170
philosophy and understanding why it's using the terms. It

102
00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:05.350
is why it has the problems that it has.

103
00:06:05.359 --> 00:06:07.679
Um YOU sort of have to have to know

104
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.609
something about Aristotle and, and, and how he got

105
00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:13.850
a lot of this, this stuff going. So that's

106
00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:16.000
that, you know, those, those are the main reasons

107
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.410
I'm interested in him. It's, it's hard not to

108
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.950
be if, if, if you're serious about philosophy and

109
00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.769
especially history of philosophy.

110
00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:27.290
Yeah. And I guess that particularly for these older

111
00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:32.630
ancient philosophers, a very frustrating thing sometimes is that,

112
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.790
um, some of their literary works are lost, perhaps

113
00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:40.429
some of them lost forever. And I noticed that

114
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.989
again when going back and reading some of their

115
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.230
works because of Nietzsche, the works of Eric Le,

116
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.929
for example, I mean, there is nothing there pretty,

117
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.100
pretty much so. But, uh, and that's interesting also

118
00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:58.015
because you told me before we, they interviewed that

119
00:06:58.024 --> 00:07:03.274
you're working on reconstructing a lost work of Aristotle

120
00:07:03.434 --> 00:07:08.494
or Aristotle entitled Pro Practicus. So what by the

121
00:07:08.505 --> 00:07:12.614
way, what do we mean by lost work here?

122
00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:13.584
What does that mean

123
00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:20.040
exactly? Yeah. So um you know, we look at

124
00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:23.910
the, the works that we have inherited what we

125
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.230
call the Aristotle corpus and they're based on medieval

126
00:07:29.239 --> 00:07:34.690
manuscripts of works that were attributed to Aristotle. And

127
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.899
these are works that essentially were continuously copied by

128
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:43.709
hand from antiquity through the middle ages and, and

129
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.640
made it into the renaissance in the age of

130
00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:50.170
printing. And so we have this, this corpus of

131
00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:54.029
works and, and you know, within that corpus, uh

132
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.059
we consider some of the works dubious meaning. Scholars

133
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.380
don't really agree whether it can be attributed to

134
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.290
Aristotle. We have other works that are spurious, which

135
00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:06.809
basically means scholars agree that we can't attribute it

136
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.809
to Aristotle. And then we have all of the

137
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:13.380
works and the most famous works that we uh

138
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:18.339
attribute to him like the politics, the physics, the

139
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.589
metaphysics, uh the poetics, the Nick and mckeon ethics

140
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.989
and so forth. All of these, you know, are

141
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.320
the core of our Aristotle corpus. But when we

142
00:08:29.329 --> 00:08:33.739
look at ancient lists of Aristotle's works, and there

143
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.229
are three ancient lists of his works. It actually

144
00:08:38.239 --> 00:08:45.070
doesn't correspond very well to our Aristotle corpus. Um

145
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.219
And so we notice a lot of titles on

146
00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:53.479
those lists that are not the same as works

147
00:08:53.489 --> 00:08:59.119
that we have and uh entire genres of works

148
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:04.710
that, you know, weren't copied continually. And so haven't

149
00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:08.349
made it into our contemporary Aristotle corpus. So by

150
00:09:08.359 --> 00:09:11.469
lost work, we basically mean a work that was

151
00:09:11.479 --> 00:09:15.380
either on an ancient list of Aristotle's writings or

152
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.239
that other ancients referred to, you know, by a

153
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.830
certain title and, and, and so forth. Um AND

154
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.380
then sometimes quoted or paraphrased. Uh And so we

155
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.099
know that these works existed and that, and that

156
00:09:29.109 --> 00:09:32.750
they had them, but they just didn't make it

157
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.250
down uh to our day. And that, that, that's

158
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.419
another issue uh that we can discuss is, you

159
00:09:39.429 --> 00:09:41.619
know, why we have the works we have and

160
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.289
why we don't have some other works we have.

161
00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:46.440
It's a big issue when we, if we, if

162
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.479
we talk about Democrats, for example, but by lost

163
00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:53.109
works, we basically mean works that existed in antiquity

164
00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:55.590
and that we don't uh have anymore. And for

165
00:09:55.599 --> 00:09:59.380
Aristotle, there are a lot of these works. In

166
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.530
fact, I think what we have is probably something

167
00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:06.080
like a quarter of what he wrote, or at

168
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.390
least what was attributed to him in antiquity. I

169
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.780
mean, may maybe we have something like a half,

170
00:10:11.789 --> 00:10:14.669
but probably more like a quarter. And one thing

171
00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:18.940
that we are entirely missing is all of the

172
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:23.020
works that Aristotle intended to publish all of his

173
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:27.380
popular works. So he wrote a lot of dialogues

174
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.380
just like Plato. In fact, he wrote four dialogues

175
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.940
that he gave the exact same title as Plato.

176
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:39.359
So he wrote a symposium, he wrote a Nexus,

177
00:10:39.369 --> 00:10:43.020
he wrote a statesman and so on. And all

178
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.549
of these dialogues, which there's a lot of ancient

179
00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:52.260
praise for Aristotle's, the golden flow of Aristotle's words

180
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.710
and so forth, which is referring to these popular

181
00:10:54.719 --> 00:10:58.869
works and these dialogues, nobody could describe the works

182
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.030
that we now have of the Aristotle Corpus as

183
00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:05.429
a golden flow of rhetorically beautiful speech. But he

184
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.049
wrote dialogues like Plato did that were extremely popular

185
00:11:10.059 --> 00:11:12.940
in antiquity. In fact, it's possible that that most

186
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:17.520
of Aristotle's reputation in antiquity uh before the later

187
00:11:18.309 --> 00:11:22.590
uh later antiquity, when you know, the Aristotle commentators,

188
00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.809
business was really going. Um But but earlier than

189
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.070
that, and in the hellenistic age, his reputation was

190
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.059
largely on the basis of these dialogues. So one

191
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.520
of the dialogues that he wrote, one of the

192
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.489
popular works he wrote was called the Protreptic. And

193
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.030
that means uh you know, to give it a

194
00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:46.940
Latin translation, exhortation, exhortation to what exhortation to philosophy.

195
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:51.039
So it's designed to be a work that encourages

196
00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:55.200
people to do philosophy, do philosophy as opposed to

197
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.169
what while doing either another kind of philosophy. So

198
00:11:59.179 --> 00:12:01.530
he's encouraging you to a certain kind of philosophy

199
00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:05.570
or do philosophy in preference to other kinds of

200
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:13.770
activities like uh politics, business, uh strategy, uh things

201
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.869
like that law. Um A actually what he comes

202
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.760
around to saying is that if you want to

203
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.130
do any of those, you sh you can enhance

204
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.650
it and do it in a, in a real

205
00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:28.200
way by also doing philosophy. So this is AAA

206
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.989
work that did not survive in medieval manuscripts, but

207
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.750
it was excerpted heavily uh by some, some later

208
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.450
ancient writers and in, in such a way that

209
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:46.460
we can take these excerpts, study them very closely

210
00:12:46.469 --> 00:12:50.609
and even arrange them into a plausible order that

211
00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:53.570
we think was the order of the original work.

212
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.489
And then we can actually say something about Aristotle's

213
00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:02.330
popular works, the so called exoteric works as opposed

214
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.250
all of the works that we have are actually

215
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:11.760
esoteric works, meaning meaning works designed for use within

216
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.940
his school. Uh We, we often lazily call them

217
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:19.890
something like notes. Uh And it's not usually clear

218
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.530
whether it's meant notes that the teacher is using

219
00:13:23.539 --> 00:13:26.710
to lecture or notes that his students are taking

220
00:13:26.719 --> 00:13:30.789
down as he's lecturing or were they initially written

221
00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:33.270
by him and then revised by students or initially

222
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.450
written by students and revised by him. Uh We,

223
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.179
we we we don't really know any of that.

224
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.299
But what we know is that these are highly

225
00:13:40.309 --> 00:13:44.570
technical works intended for use within a school and

226
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.219
not the kind of polished literary works that, that

227
00:13:48.229 --> 00:13:52.200
we have with play doh uh or other contemporaries

228
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.440
of Aristotle like is Socrates. So it's just interesting

229
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.900
to get it, get an insight into that literary

230
00:13:58.909 --> 00:14:01.429
accomplishment. And then there are certain things we can

231
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:06.140
actually say, we can inform things about our reading

232
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:10.020
of the Aristotle corpus. And that esoteric works on

233
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.820
the basis of having a clearer theory about the,

234
00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.880
the exoteric ones like the paretic.

235
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.150
So to get into some of uh the aspects

236
00:14:21.159 --> 00:14:24.659
of Aristotle's philosophy that you've explored in your work

237
00:14:24.669 --> 00:14:28.650
more specifically and to try to perhaps tie a

238
00:14:28.669 --> 00:14:33.940
little bit to modern conceptualizations of science, for example,

239
00:14:34.289 --> 00:14:38.140
uh did Aristotle defend in any way, the idea

240
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:42.049
of scientific unity? And by the way, what does

241
00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:45.179
scientific unity mean exactly?

242
00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:49.359
Well, that is, so that's a, that's a big

243
00:14:49.369 --> 00:14:52.119
question. Um I'm, I'm, I'm very happy to talk

244
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.409
about it. So first thing I think that first

245
00:14:57.419 --> 00:15:00.210
way to approach this issue is to realize that,

246
00:15:00.219 --> 00:15:05.570
you know, for Aristotle science, uh that's the term

247
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.489
we use to translate his term, you know, epistemic

248
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.010
where we get the term epistemology, it's really a

249
00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.200
state of mind or, or even a state of,

250
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.690
of character. It's an, it's an intellectual virtue that

251
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.090
people possess. OK. So when we, when we talk

252
00:15:24.099 --> 00:15:28.390
about science fundamentally, don't mean something that's like out

253
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.929
there in objects or like in on papyrus scrolls

254
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.260
or on the internet or something. It's, it's actually

255
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:41.219
a condition of a mind. OK? And, and, and

256
00:15:41.229 --> 00:15:44.570
in an ability to do something, an ability to

257
00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.929
prove things, an ability to demonstrate things. OK. So

258
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.119
there is, there is scientific unity in the sense

259
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:57.299
that science is a modification of a soul and

260
00:15:57.309 --> 00:16:01.859
every scientific soul is capable of doing something capable

261
00:16:01.869 --> 00:16:07.210
of proving something. Now, in different domains, there are

262
00:16:07.219 --> 00:16:15.099
different standards of proof or demonstration and different methods

263
00:16:15.109 --> 00:16:18.940
used uh to build up to these proofs. And

264
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:24.700
that's where we start getting uh divergences um in

265
00:16:25.239 --> 00:16:28.059
and, and, and we get away from the unity

266
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.409
of science in a, in a single mind into

267
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:37.669
um the way that this unified mind approaches various

268
00:16:37.679 --> 00:16:42.070
kinds of objects which are themselves quite different and,

269
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:47.690
and of a different nature. So, um and, and

270
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.570
we can continue to talk about scientific unity even

271
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.250
when we talk about how he approaches those different

272
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.950
kinds of objects. But there, it's, it's, it's interesting

273
00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.440
the way he divides things up because he, he

274
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.789
does so quite differently. So we look at his,

275
00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:06.368
his overall division of the sciences and classification of

276
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.260
the sciences. The first and most important division is

277
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:15.439
between practical philosophy on the one hand and theoretical

278
00:17:15.449 --> 00:17:19.920
philosophy on the other hand, OK. And theoretical philosophy

279
00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:26.000
studies objects that we want to know their causes,

280
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:30.160
whether or not we can have any further effect

281
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.410
from that knowledge, produce any other kind of effect.

282
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.839
So things that we just want to know about

283
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.579
and this basically comes down for him to you

284
00:17:39.589 --> 00:17:44.130
know God or theology, uh the gods, the divine

285
00:17:44.319 --> 00:17:51.810
uh mathematical entities like arithmetical or geometric objects and

286
00:17:51.979 --> 00:17:59.069
natural science. So uh everything from the stars, moon

287
00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:02.569
and sun to the nature of the earth and

288
00:18:02.579 --> 00:18:06.280
the environment, to plants and animals, all of those

289
00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.510
things, we want to know about their causes, just,

290
00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:11.910
just to contemplate them, we might be able to

291
00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.410
do something else with that knowledge. But the knowledge,

292
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.510
the key thing is that the knowledge is valuable

293
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.689
even if we can't do anything else with it.

294
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:24.540
And that differentiates it from the practical sciences where

295
00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:29.069
here we judge their success on the effects. We

296
00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:32.969
wanna know their, the causes in these various domains

297
00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:37.199
in order to produce certain effects. So we don't

298
00:18:37.209 --> 00:18:41.300
wanna just know about happiness or know about the

299
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:46.010
good. We wanna actually be happy and uh have

300
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.589
the goods and we don't wanna just know about

301
00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:52.500
the causes of good government. We actually want to

302
00:18:52.729 --> 00:18:56.689
um participate in, in good government and build good

303
00:18:56.699 --> 00:19:00.589
government and live under good government and similar to,

304
00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:04.469
you know, medicine or economics or anything else. We

305
00:19:04.479 --> 00:19:06.750
don't wanna just know what it is to be

306
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.510
healthy. We actually want to be healthy or know

307
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.619
what it takes to make money, we want to

308
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.109
actually have a lot of it. Uh And so

309
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.390
then you start to get different standards for what

310
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:27.150
constitutes knowledge in these other kinds of domains. Now,

311
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.959
another aspect of the unity of science is AAA

312
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.859
unity of methods that applies even to these theoretical

313
00:19:36.869 --> 00:19:41.040
and practical ones, which involves sort of stages of

314
00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:45.349
scientific knowledge. So a stage at which empirical facts

315
00:19:45.709 --> 00:19:48.550
are gathered. And this is a process he calls,

316
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.709
you know, history, inquiry or investigation. And we establish

317
00:19:53.719 --> 00:19:58.760
what the facts are in the various domains. And

318
00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:03.619
then we search for ways to explain those facts

319
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.390
that is we search for causes. And ultimately, we

320
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.520
try to trace these causes back to principles, principles

321
00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:16.250
that we accept as, as self evident or there

322
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.699
are sort of like definitions and that operating with

323
00:20:19.709 --> 00:20:24.900
those principles or definitions we can through chains of,

324
00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:30.800
of reasoning, arrive at conclusions that constitute the phenomena

325
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.780
that we observe that we, that we want to

326
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.079
explain. So, you know, that's, that's a kind of

327
00:20:36.089 --> 00:20:39.150
outline of, of, of how any science will work.

328
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.979
Since a science is a mind's ability to prove

329
00:20:41.989 --> 00:20:44.510
something, then this is how this is how you

330
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.119
would ultimately prove it. But within laying out that

331
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:52.760
that kind of method or that that standard for

332
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:58.910
scientific knowledge, he talks about different domains of scientific

333
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.520
knowledge and he actually creates a kind of prohibition

334
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:09.939
on domain crossing or kind crossing explanations. So he,

335
00:21:09.949 --> 00:21:15.510
he wants to, to tidy up where uh how

336
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.270
the observed phenomena that we're explaining relates to the

337
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.060
kind of principles being used. And he looks at

338
00:21:22.069 --> 00:21:25.069
his predecessors and he sees them trying to just

339
00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:28.959
use a couple of principles to explain all of

340
00:21:28.969 --> 00:21:32.829
the phenomena in all kinds of various domains. And

341
00:21:33.349 --> 00:21:36.319
he thinks we need, we need a tighter relationship

342
00:21:36.329 --> 00:21:40.449
and more specific principles. And so he actually says,

343
00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:43.630
we should not be able to just freely cross,

344
00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:49.890
for example, from principles about arithmetic or geometry immediately

345
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:55.390
to the explanation say of ethical matters, uh which

346
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.199
he kind of conceives of like Pythagorean is doing

347
00:21:58.209 --> 00:22:00.829
this. They think that numbers are the principles of

348
00:22:00.839 --> 00:22:03.949
everything. So they would explain even marriage injustice on

349
00:22:03.959 --> 00:22:06.400
the basis of these being like the numbers three

350
00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.619
or four and things like that. And he thinks,

351
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:15.680
well, arithmetic principles can explain arithmetic facts and, but

352
00:22:15.689 --> 00:22:18.719
we're gonna need ethical principles in order to explain

353
00:22:18.729 --> 00:22:21.400
ethical facts and, and we should not, we should

354
00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:25.930
not have a sense of scientific unity. That's so

355
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:30.000
tight that, that we just expect a few principles

356
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:37.449
to explain uh everything whatsoever. Uh So that's uh

357
00:22:37.459 --> 00:22:39.810
one thing that he lays out and it's an

358
00:22:39.819 --> 00:22:43.859
extremely important and influential aspect of his thought that

359
00:22:43.869 --> 00:22:47.560
being said as he is laying out this prohibition

360
00:22:47.569 --> 00:22:53.319
on kind crossing or doma domain crossing explanations. Immediately,

361
00:22:53.329 --> 00:22:56.459
he says, but there are certain exceptions to this

362
00:22:56.469 --> 00:22:59.619
and it, it's almost as if the exceptions end

363
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:04.800
up constituting the rule. So for example, we if

364
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:09.349
we're explaining a meteorological phenomenon like the rainbow or

365
00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:13.829
the halo, then we're gonna need theorems from a

366
00:23:13.839 --> 00:23:18.689
natural science like optics in order to explain these

367
00:23:18.699 --> 00:23:23.969
phenomena. But the theorems of optics are themselves based

368
00:23:23.979 --> 00:23:29.180
on geometric principles. So ultimately, the explanation for why

369
00:23:29.189 --> 00:23:31.760
the rainbow is a semi circle or why the

370
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:37.349
halo is a circle has to do with geometric

371
00:23:37.359 --> 00:23:41.410
principles. So we do, we do cross kinds from

372
00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:47.119
meteorology all the way to geometry and that explanation.

373
00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:50.800
But but we have these standards for keeping the

374
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:54.880
phenomena tied to the principle. So that's a very

375
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:59.079
long winded answer to the to the question. Ultimately,

376
00:23:59.089 --> 00:24:01.579
yes, science is a completely unified thing and it's

377
00:24:01.589 --> 00:24:03.300
an ability to prove and it's something in a

378
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:07.089
mind. But because the objects that are being explained

379
00:24:07.099 --> 00:24:13.410
are so diverse, this unity breaks down pretty, pretty

380
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.719
quickly. But it, it can be reestablished because there

381
00:24:16.729 --> 00:24:19.550
are lots of general principles that we need in

382
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.449
order in order to explain everything. And there are

383
00:24:22.459 --> 00:24:27.599
geometric principles involved even in explaining things like justice.

384
00:24:27.609 --> 00:24:30.630
So we need a proportional concept of equality in

385
00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.170
order to explain distributive justice for example. But it's

386
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.839
a much more sophisticated matter than you know, a

387
00:24:36.849 --> 00:24:40.140
a kind of number theory about something that seems

388
00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:43.599
to correspond to justice. It, it's, it's, it's really

389
00:24:43.609 --> 00:24:48.369
a deployment of, of uh principles arrived at after

390
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.229
some empirical investigation of the field.

391
00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.599
So another thing that uh at least modern scientists

392
00:24:56.609 --> 00:25:00.660
uh care about and are interested in is explanation

393
00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:04.829
of course. And uh Aristotle thought about different kinds

394
00:25:04.839 --> 00:25:09.760
of explanation and modern scientists tend to favor mechanistic

395
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:15.109
explanations, but there's also for example, teleological explanation. So

396
00:25:15.439 --> 00:25:19.859
uh how did uh Aristotle look uh at those

397
00:25:19.869 --> 00:25:22.300
different kinds of explanations? How did they look, for

398
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:28.219
example, at the relationship between mechanistic and teleological explanations?

399
00:25:30.069 --> 00:25:32.969
Great question, one of my, my favorite things to

400
00:25:32.979 --> 00:25:36.890
talk about. Um So I I think there is

401
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.589
an enormous confusion in the, in the history of

402
00:25:40.599 --> 00:25:44.229
philosophy and, and really the history of science about

403
00:25:44.239 --> 00:25:50.920
the relationship between mechanistic or mechanical explanations and teleological

404
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.520
explanations. And a lot of it has to do

405
00:25:53.530 --> 00:26:00.500
with, with what we mean by mechanistic explanations. Um

406
00:26:01.349 --> 00:26:04.010
So first of all, it should be pointed out

407
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:10.260
that Aristotle wrote probably the first systematic treatise on

408
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:15.790
mechanics called the Mechanical Problems. And it employs exactly

409
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.949
this methodology of science. I've just been describing some

410
00:26:18.959 --> 00:26:21.770
people think it's written by an early member of

411
00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.969
his school or somebody a little bit later. But

412
00:26:23.979 --> 00:26:26.959
the interesting thing about it is that it embodies

413
00:26:26.969 --> 00:26:31.900
Aristotle's Philosophy of Science as he expresses it in

414
00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.780
the posterior analytics better than any other work of

415
00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.760
Aristotle that, that we have. And it was an

416
00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:42.579
enormously influential text we can demonstrate, for example, its

417
00:26:42.589 --> 00:26:47.750
direct influence on Descartes. OK. So he wrote the

418
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:54.199
first, the earliest, the most systematic work on mechanical

419
00:26:54.209 --> 00:27:00.180
explanations. OK, explanations of mechanical problems. All right. But

420
00:27:00.189 --> 00:27:02.849
this is not often read and he's not often

421
00:27:02.859 --> 00:27:05.579
credited with this. And usually what we do is

422
00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.109
is build up some kind of history of science

423
00:27:08.119 --> 00:27:11.520
that says, well, Aristotle was interested in in final

424
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.920
causes and teleological explanations and forms and these kind

425
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.979
of qualitative things. And he wasn't at all interested

426
00:27:17.989 --> 00:27:23.969
in in a matter and motion and the kind

427
00:27:23.979 --> 00:27:26.910
of things that the later later came to the

428
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.589
fore in the scientific revolution of the 17th century.

429
00:27:30.599 --> 00:27:33.729
So a lot of people will just lazily define

430
00:27:33.739 --> 00:27:37.369
a mechanistic explanation as being one that only depends

431
00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:41.099
on uh matter and motion or something like that.

432
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.349
So the first thing to realize is that Aristotle

433
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.229
causality, you know, his, his theory of causality is

434
00:27:48.239 --> 00:27:52.270
that we need complete explanations that involve all the

435
00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.250
kind of causes relevant to a certain phenomenon. And

436
00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.810
so he certainly believes that an important cause is

437
00:27:59.819 --> 00:28:03.630
motion. What first moved the thing? That's one of

438
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.849
his four causes. Second one of his four causes

439
00:28:07.859 --> 00:28:12.540
is the material cause. OK. So it's, it's rather

440
00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:17.780
odd to oppose Aristotle to material explanations when he

441
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:20.439
is the one that invented the idea of material

442
00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:24.229
explanations. In fact, I've written an article that shows

443
00:28:24.239 --> 00:28:29.030
he invented the term material that wasn't used even

444
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.750
by the supposed materialist predecessors, like democrats didn't use

445
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.880
the term material neither did empedocles, neither did Amex

446
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:42.229
Aristotle invented the term material and used it for

447
00:28:42.239 --> 00:28:45.130
a certain kind of explanation for the first time

448
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.959
later, so called materialist explanations are Aristotelian in this

449
00:28:49.969 --> 00:28:53.160
respect. But what he thinks is that if we're,

450
00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:56.199
if we're explaining some phenomenon, then we need to

451
00:28:56.209 --> 00:29:00.959
explain the material involved, what moved it, what form

452
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.359
uh the things take and what its end or

453
00:29:05.369 --> 00:29:11.420
purpose or function is now returning to mechanistic explanations

454
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:15.339
or mechanical explanations. What are they? Well, let's start

455
00:29:15.349 --> 00:29:19.339
with mechanical explanations. OK. These are based and, and

456
00:29:19.349 --> 00:29:21.939
the most simple of these would be explaining the

457
00:29:21.949 --> 00:29:29.880
simple machines, OK, an incline plane, uh pulleys levers,

458
00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:33.329
things like this. Right now, all of these things,

459
00:29:33.449 --> 00:29:38.260
you can't begin explaining them without giving some kind

460
00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:41.420
of end or purpose. So it makes an inclined

461
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:46.160
plane, makes carrying weight up uh uh up a

462
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:52.719
slope easier. Um The lever makes moving heavy objects

463
00:29:52.729 --> 00:29:56.349
easier, the the lever and fulcrum and so on.

464
00:29:56.359 --> 00:29:59.050
Uh So there's no explanation of these until we

465
00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.829
say what they're able to do. And then we

466
00:30:01.839 --> 00:30:04.410
described the form that they're in, you know, that

467
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.750
you need a fulcrum that you need uh an

468
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.435
object of a certain length and so forth. And

469
00:30:09.444 --> 00:30:11.694
then we bring in material things. Well, it needs

470
00:30:11.704 --> 00:30:14.555
to be rigid and it needs these, these other

471
00:30:14.875 --> 00:30:18.795
kinds of qualities and we bring in a mover.

472
00:30:18.875 --> 00:30:22.165
Um YOU know, somebody needs to depress the lever

473
00:30:22.175 --> 00:30:26.494
or whatever. OK. And so I can't find any

474
00:30:26.505 --> 00:30:32.660
so called mechanistic explanation or explanation of anything mechanistic

475
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:37.890
that doesn't involve all of these causes. OK. I,

476
00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:39.819
I don't think there's any such thing as a

477
00:30:39.829 --> 00:30:43.140
mechanistic explanation that doesn't involve them in jars or

478
00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.619
anyone else. And so we're all sort of using

479
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:50.550
Aristotle's theory of causality to explain this. And there

480
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.819
are people that would like to sort of reduce

481
00:30:52.829 --> 00:30:54.520
it and say, well, we don't, we don't need

482
00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:58.020
the, the final causes anymore. We don't need the

483
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:00.420
formal causes. But I just, I just don't think

484
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:03.839
that's, that's the case. So there is certainly no

485
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:11.459
opposition in Aristotle's philosophy between mechanical or mechanistic explanations

486
00:31:11.469 --> 00:31:14.040
and teleological explanations. And I don't think there are

487
00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:19.469
anywhere else. So all mechanistic explanations are teleological. Now,

488
00:31:19.479 --> 00:31:21.790
on the other side of it, Aristotle would be

489
00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:26.270
the last person to accept a merely teleological explanation

490
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.645
of something which would be to just say what

491
00:31:28.655 --> 00:31:32.035
it's good or end is what he's really interested

492
00:31:32.045 --> 00:31:34.694
in is what, what's the mechanism that makes all

493
00:31:34.704 --> 00:31:37.474
of that possible? Like how do these parts relate

494
00:31:37.484 --> 00:31:40.244
to each other? Such that this this end is

495
00:31:40.255 --> 00:31:43.474
realized so largely what his philosophy is like. His

496
00:31:43.484 --> 00:31:51.635
biology is describing the mechanisms that make vital functions

497
00:31:51.645 --> 00:31:59.520
like reproduction, growth, uh nutrition, uh perception, self motion,

498
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:03.969
even thinking, what are the mechanisms that make those

499
00:32:03.979 --> 00:32:07.510
things possible? Um And if you take those out,

500
00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.390
you, you, you, you, you getting rid of all

501
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:15.770
of Aristotle's explanations. So there is this this later

502
00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.630
polemical dialectic that opposes the two and says one

503
00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.770
is superior to the other. But it's, it's just

504
00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.719
absolute nonsense in terms of explanation. Uh We we,

505
00:32:25.729 --> 00:32:28.439
we, we need all of these causes in any

506
00:32:28.699 --> 00:32:32.439
particular explanation. And there's no phenomenon that we can

507
00:32:32.449 --> 00:32:34.800
explain without it. I mean, take, take the the

508
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:38.180
most famous early modern example, something like a clock,

509
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.119
right? You cannot explain a clock unless you want

510
00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:45.500
to talk about the function of keeping time. OK?

511
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:50.880
And the mechanism is completely oriented and designed every

512
00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:54.219
aspect of the mechanism is to bring about that.

513
00:32:54.229 --> 00:32:58.209
And only that end. And so try to explain

514
00:32:58.219 --> 00:33:01.859
a clock without talking about the end AAA robot

515
00:33:01.869 --> 00:33:05.170
that walks across my desk, I can't explain anything

516
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.930
about it. It's a pure mechanism, but I can't

517
00:33:06.939 --> 00:33:10.219
explain anything about it unless I begin with saying,

518
00:33:10.229 --> 00:33:11.949
well, the purpose of it is to simulate a

519
00:33:11.959 --> 00:33:14.989
thing like walking, like stepping or something. And then

520
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.030
I give the mechanism to explain that, but it

521
00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.339
begins with the end. So there are no explanations

522
00:33:22.369 --> 00:33:28.819
of mechanical phenomena without teleological explanations. And my conception

523
00:33:28.829 --> 00:33:33.260
of mechanistic explanations are that they are explanations modeled

524
00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:38.020
on mechanical explanations. So we have this real science

525
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:42.150
of mechanics and then we have other attempts to

526
00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:47.810
give explanations like mechanics in other fields like biology.

527
00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:54.540
OK. So biomechanical explanations and these are mechanistic in

528
00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:58.650
the sense that they try to describe the mechanisms,

529
00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.760
including the material for movers and everything that bring

530
00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:07.280
about certain biological functions or an

531
00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:10.909
Yeah, I, I imagine that perhaps one of the

532
00:34:10.918 --> 00:34:15.000
reasons why maybe modern scientists, I, I mean, by

533
00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:19.070
modern scientists, I'm referring mostly to the contemporary ones.

534
00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.429
I'm, I don't think that probably scientists from the

535
00:34:22.438 --> 00:34:27.570
16th 17th century who wouldn't be aware of how

536
00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.449
important these different kinds of explanation coming from Aristotle

537
00:34:31.458 --> 00:34:35.080
would be. But reps, they have not read much

538
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:38.929
philosophy, the contemporary ones. But also when they hear

539
00:34:38.938 --> 00:34:42.989
about things like the theology, they probably immediately think

540
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.989
of religion or something like that.

541
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.010
Well, yes, I mean, there is enormous confusion, of

542
00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:56.708
course, caused by the intermediary history and teleology. One

543
00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:59.439
of the big purposes of teleology in the early

544
00:34:59.449 --> 00:35:03.679
modern era was to support uh what was at

545
00:35:03.689 --> 00:35:06.780
the time called natural theology. The idea that we

546
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:10.540
can even sort of prove God's existence by examining

547
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.590
these phenomenon. What do we find? We find that

548
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.850
all these ends come about by these very elaborate

549
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:20.810
mechanisms and these mechanisms are simple to our mechanical

550
00:35:20.979 --> 00:35:24.320
objects. So for, for one thing, we've got to,

551
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.570
we've got to discover that and then, and then

552
00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.909
we'll realize sort of the glory of God and

553
00:35:29.919 --> 00:35:36.469
kind of intelligent design, creationism. And uh and, and

554
00:35:36.479 --> 00:35:41.429
second, we have these nice and more uh complete

555
00:35:41.719 --> 00:35:47.620
explanations of the phenomena. Now, um Aristotle doesn't accept

556
00:35:47.629 --> 00:35:50.750
any of that stuff about God because his concept

557
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.030
of God is totally different and he is totally

558
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.909
opposed to an intelligent design, creationist concept of God,

559
00:35:59.149 --> 00:36:04.300
uh which Plato had. But Aristotle totally, uh totally

560
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:08.949
rejected. But because that was taken over and used

561
00:36:08.959 --> 00:36:11.250
so extensively, then people think, oh, well, the whole

562
00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.110
purpose of teleology is really not to do something

563
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:18.719
scientific. It's to prove the existence of God. But

564
00:36:18.729 --> 00:36:22.219
if we're, if we're just talking about explanations, ok,

565
00:36:22.229 --> 00:36:25.975
then we need teleological explanations. As far as I

566
00:36:25.985 --> 00:36:30.274
can tell, there aren't explanations that don't involve teleology

567
00:36:30.495 --> 00:36:33.485
at some level. But we do need to, we

568
00:36:33.495 --> 00:36:36.084
do it, we do need to separate it out

569
00:36:36.094 --> 00:36:38.834
and, and make the relevant distinctions by what we

570
00:36:38.844 --> 00:36:41.645
mean by God, similar thing, what we mean by

571
00:36:41.655 --> 00:36:45.120
soul. Uh You know, there's a lot of confusion

572
00:36:45.129 --> 00:36:47.649
because of the intermediary, history of the concept of

573
00:36:47.659 --> 00:36:50.330
soul or in ethics. You know, virtue, people have

574
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.790
these concepts of virtue that it's like something that,

575
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.199
you know, something in Christian ethics or something. And

576
00:36:56.209 --> 00:36:58.239
you have to do, do some work to say

577
00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:01.050
no, let's go back to what the original notion

578
00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.320
is and it ends up being quite different.

579
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:09.040
So another thing that you wrote about is how

580
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:13.350
Aristotle approached or thought about the meaning of life.

581
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.370
Could you tell us about that? I mean, what

582
00:37:15.379 --> 00:37:17.459
is the meaning of life or?

583
00:37:17.699 --> 00:37:20.780
Right. OK. Yeah, you, you really asked the big

584
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.310
questions, don't you Ricardo? Um So, you know, and

585
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.070
of course, I'm giving Aristotle's approach to the meaning

586
00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.649
of life. And, you know, nowadays, every philosopher worth

587
00:37:30.659 --> 00:37:33.800
their ASA has to have a view on the

588
00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:37.419
meaning of life. Uh So I have a colleague

589
00:37:37.429 --> 00:37:39.840
that he's just started a course on the meaning

590
00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.719
of life. And of course, it's the most popular,

591
00:37:42.689 --> 00:37:44.909
you know, new course at U CS D. Everybody

592
00:37:44.919 --> 00:37:46.310
wants to, you know, oh, I can, I can

593
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.439
go figure out the meaning of life by, by

594
00:37:48.449 --> 00:37:51.429
taking this. And I, I contributed to this extraordinary

595
00:37:52.179 --> 00:37:56.820
um anthology that took something like 30 philosophers from

596
00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:00.719
antiquity down to like Camus or something and, and,

597
00:38:00.729 --> 00:38:04.040
and explains what each of their views are on

598
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:06.159
the meaning of life. So I think, I think,

599
00:38:06.169 --> 00:38:10.639
you know, Aristotle is really a special philosopher in

600
00:38:10.649 --> 00:38:13.179
this context because he's, he's really the first one

601
00:38:13.189 --> 00:38:18.129
to directly and sort of systematically and philosophically approach

602
00:38:18.139 --> 00:38:22.540
this issue. And he does in, in two, in

603
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:27.689
two different ways that correspond to two different meanings

604
00:38:27.699 --> 00:38:30.550
of the term meaning, you know, two different senses

605
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.330
of the term meaning of life. So one of

606
00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.020
them is, you know, sort of what we mean

607
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:40.120
when we use the term life, what are we

608
00:38:40.129 --> 00:38:44.100
talking about? He has a very specific and careful

609
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:47.360
method of figuring that out for one thing. And

610
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:50.570
then the second is that by meaning of life,

611
00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.050
we often mean something like the end or purpose

612
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.290
of life. Like why go on and what, what

613
00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.850
makes it worthwhile and that sort of thing. And

614
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.949
he also has a very methodical, careful approach to

615
00:39:03.959 --> 00:39:07.889
that issue and his approach to these two different

616
00:39:07.899 --> 00:39:10.530
aspects of the problem with the meaning of life

617
00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:14.790
are interrelated. So on, on the first one about,

618
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.060
you know, what do we mean by life? His

619
00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:21.949
answer is that, well, we mean the different things

620
00:39:21.959 --> 00:39:24.770
that living things can do so to be alive

621
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.790
is to be able to do certain things to

622
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.699
have a certain function. So we, we think that

623
00:39:29.709 --> 00:39:34.370
plants are alive because they can reproduce and they

624
00:39:34.379 --> 00:39:39.899
can use nutrition and they can grow and that

625
00:39:39.909 --> 00:39:41.679
sort of thing. And, and we can actually talk

626
00:39:41.689 --> 00:39:46.260
about what's good and bad for plants themselves, not

627
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.959
in relation to humans or other animals but themselves.

628
00:39:48.969 --> 00:39:51.110
So a gardener can tell you what's good for

629
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.000
this plant or a botanist can tell you what's

630
00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:55.439
good for this plant in terms of what kind

631
00:39:55.449 --> 00:39:58.020
of soil is good, what kind of, how much

632
00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.889
water, how much light, how much shade and so

633
00:40:00.899 --> 00:40:04.729
on. And that's because these living things have these

634
00:40:04.739 --> 00:40:09.560
ends or functions. And he thinks that animals uh

635
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:17.270
are basically like superpowered plants, they too reproduce. Uh

636
00:40:17.399 --> 00:40:21.770
THEY use nutrition, they grow just like plants, but

637
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:26.389
they also additionally have have other powers or functions

638
00:40:26.399 --> 00:40:31.100
like uh perception or sensation and moving themselves around

639
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:34.449
in space. And so we can again talk to

640
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:39.389
biologists or zoologists or veterinarians or pet owners or

641
00:40:39.399 --> 00:40:41.989
whatever. And they can tell us what's good for

642
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.330
these, these animals in terms of the functions, they

643
00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.500
have not just the plant like functions, but also

644
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:51.110
the animal like functions. So they're not doing well

645
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.570
if they can't move themselves around in space. For

646
00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.449
example, if they're confined to a tiny cage or

647
00:40:56.459 --> 00:40:59.469
something, or if there's something wrong with their ability

648
00:40:59.479 --> 00:41:02.959
to perceive or sense or it's mostly they're sensing

649
00:41:02.969 --> 00:41:05.709
things that cause them pain. Then we think that's,

650
00:41:05.949 --> 00:41:10.360
that's bad for animals. And then humans again are

651
00:41:10.399 --> 00:41:13.879
like superpowered animals or plants that have all of

652
00:41:13.889 --> 00:41:18.139
those plant and animal capabilities. But additionally, the ability

653
00:41:18.149 --> 00:41:22.179
to use language and reason. So what we mean

654
00:41:22.189 --> 00:41:24.899
by life, what we mean by plant life is

655
00:41:24.909 --> 00:41:30.429
reproduction, nutrition, growth. What we mean by by animal

656
00:41:30.439 --> 00:41:35.040
life is sensation and self movement. And what we

657
00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:40.050
mean by human life is something like um reason

658
00:41:40.149 --> 00:41:44.370
use of language, rationality. Now, when we move to

659
00:41:44.379 --> 00:41:48.030
the to the other dimension of this question, the

660
00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.250
end or purpose of life, then it is related

661
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.479
to this meaning of life. So the end or

662
00:41:54.489 --> 00:41:57.729
purpose of life for a plant just is the

663
00:41:57.739 --> 00:42:00.810
the flourishing of those functions that they're capable of.

664
00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:03.260
So they're capable of nutrition and growth. So we

665
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:07.010
say that they're doing well when they're literally flourishing,

666
00:42:07.409 --> 00:42:10.770
throwing out shoots and flowers, fructifying that sort of

667
00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.889
thing. And we say that animals are living a

668
00:42:13.899 --> 00:42:17.350
good life when they're having a lot of pleasure

669
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.889
and they're moving around a lot and that sort

670
00:42:19.899 --> 00:42:22.989
of thing. And for humans, the meaning of life

671
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.149
though will be activities related to their special capability

672
00:42:29.159 --> 00:42:36.110
of reason or language. And so ultimately, for Aristotle,

673
00:42:36.429 --> 00:42:39.409
um tho those other things, those plant like and

674
00:42:39.419 --> 00:42:43.030
animal like capabilities are also important to our happiness

675
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.409
and to our, to our overall end. But most

676
00:42:46.419 --> 00:42:49.449
important for that is some kind of use of

677
00:42:49.459 --> 00:42:52.929
reason. So he his entire theory of virtue and

678
00:42:52.939 --> 00:42:55.620
what's excellent or good about human beings has to

679
00:42:55.629 --> 00:42:58.850
do with the activities of reason. And the and

680
00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:04.000
the highest most meaningful uh life you can live

681
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:07.810
according to Aristotle. Perhaps not surprisingly, philosopher comes to

682
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.540
the conclusion that the most meaningful best thing you

683
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:13.850
can do is philosophy. Um BECAUSE it is, it

684
00:43:13.889 --> 00:43:20.520
is the exercise of this animal plant, but human

685
00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:24.959
capability that this most human capability that we have

686
00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:26.540
and that allows us to do all of these

687
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:31.540
extraordinary things. So the the the meaning of life

688
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:36.100
is um tied first, we establish the meaning of

689
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:37.729
life by what we mean by it. And then,

690
00:43:37.739 --> 00:43:42.010
and then we, we relate our own purpose to

691
00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.810
uh to, to this very meaning. And you know,

692
00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:49.489
11 last thing on this is that um you

693
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:55.090
know, Aristotle's definition of a human being as a

694
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.560
rational animal, you know, I I think it's, there's

695
00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:00.500
a lot going for it and it survived. I

696
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:04.919
mean, basically, basically the way we, um, classify our

697
00:44:04.929 --> 00:44:10.560
species. Homo sapiens, you know, wise humans is due

698
00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:14.060
to this definition of Aristotle. Um, I mean, I

699
00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:17.600
think, I, I, I think we need to revise

700
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.850
the name of the species because I think we're

701
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.879
sort of like putting on these errors to call

702
00:44:21.889 --> 00:44:25.189
ourselves. Oh, we're the wise hominids or you, especially

703
00:44:25.199 --> 00:44:27.739
when we say Homo sapiens sapiens, you know, and

704
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.350
we sort of double it like we're, we're really

705
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.300
the wise ones. And I there's proposals for changing

706
00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:36.040
the name of the species to something more descriptive,

707
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:39.919
like, you know, homo terminator or something like that,

708
00:44:39.929 --> 00:44:42.479
you know, and because we drive other species into

709
00:44:42.489 --> 00:44:44.520
extinction and this is the sort of role that

710
00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:48.840
we play or other things. But um, it's why,

711
00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:52.100
why do we use that name for the species?

712
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:55.600
Well, because that is what is distinctive about this

713
00:44:55.610 --> 00:45:00.030
life form. And so that is where the meaning

714
00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:03.070
of our lives must come from in, in, in

715
00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.790
Aristotle's view. And so we, we name the whole

716
00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.409
species. It might be kind of aspirational, but it's,

717
00:45:08.419 --> 00:45:11.540
it's because that's what our, that's what our end

718
00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:13.870
is. That's what we're trying to be. I know.

719
00:45:13.879 --> 00:45:15.479
And so we should think of Homo sapiens is

720
00:45:15.489 --> 00:45:18.189
not that we're all wise or that we're all

721
00:45:18.199 --> 00:45:21.080
intelligent, but that's, that's, that's what we should, that's

722
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:23.310
what we should become. That's what, that's what would

723
00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.310
give our lives a true human meaning.

724
00:45:27.969 --> 00:45:30.780
So, before we get into the critics. Let me

725
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:35.090
just ask you about one more topic. Uh Aristotle

726
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.629
related here. I mean, many things we could talk

727
00:45:37.639 --> 00:45:40.610
about here, of course, but we have to try

728
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:44.870
to keep it a little bit shorter. No, no,

729
00:45:44.879 --> 00:45:47.159
no, no worries. But I, I would like to

730
00:45:47.169 --> 00:45:50.530
ask you and particularly since, uh I commented earlier

731
00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:56.419
about uh how people think about uh the theology

732
00:45:56.429 --> 00:46:01.179
nowadays and so on. Um How did Aristotle look

733
00:46:01.189 --> 00:46:05.030
at the relationship between biology and theology?

734
00:46:06.219 --> 00:46:08.320
Uh Well, this is a very good question. It,

735
00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:11.860
it actually ties in several of the earlier questions

736
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:13.989
that you asked. You're very good at, at, at,

737
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.949
at doing that. Um So one thing is that,

738
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:24.969
I mean, they are related um and this, you

739
00:46:24.979 --> 00:46:27.530
might think is problematic from what I was saying

740
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:32.719
earlier about kind prohibiting kind crossing explanations or domain

741
00:46:32.729 --> 00:46:36.979
crossing explanations because the domain of theology and the

742
00:46:36.989 --> 00:46:41.489
domain of biology are presumably uh separate. And so

743
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:45.840
they should have different principles uh in each that

744
00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:49.310
explain the unique phenomenon in each and they, and

745
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.590
they really, you might think shouldn't cross over and

746
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.780
they don't cross over in the obvious way. And

747
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:58.669
that I think some people would like to read

748
00:46:58.679 --> 00:47:01.949
Aristotle is saying, which is that, you know, theology

749
00:47:01.959 --> 00:47:06.600
tells us that God uh created an intelligently designed

750
00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:10.169
all of the animals and plants. And so the

751
00:47:10.179 --> 00:47:15.010
explanation of those phenomena have to do with theological

752
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:20.659
explanations. Ultimately, Aristotle totally rejects that picture, which by

753
00:47:20.669 --> 00:47:23.550
the way, because it gets rid of nature, it

754
00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.699
turns every thing into an artifact of a creator

755
00:47:27.899 --> 00:47:31.379
God and eliminate the idea of nature. Whereas Aristotle

756
00:47:31.389 --> 00:47:35.830
has this idea that, that uh biological entities are

757
00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.340
natural things. And by natural, he means they haven't,

758
00:47:39.429 --> 00:47:44.100
they have internal principles of rest of motion, of

759
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:48.489
their uh self-organization of their self movement and so

760
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:54.870
on. So that being said, uh he does believe

761
00:47:54.879 --> 00:47:57.560
there's a connection and it's because he believes there

762
00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:00.530
is one continuous scale. And so this also gets

763
00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.169
back in another way to the question of the

764
00:48:03.179 --> 00:48:07.370
unity of science. There's basically one continuous scale that

765
00:48:07.379 --> 00:48:15.409
goes from inanimate objects through plants, animals, human beings

766
00:48:15.419 --> 00:48:18.709
and gods. And there's one order of nature that

767
00:48:18.719 --> 00:48:23.370
embraces all of those, all of those entities. And

768
00:48:23.379 --> 00:48:28.840
so we actually need some principles that we derive

769
00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:34.389
from studying animals, like about their reproduction, about their

770
00:48:34.399 --> 00:48:39.199
motion, even even from studying plants, about their reproduction.

771
00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.399
We need, we need some things uh to explain

772
00:48:43.409 --> 00:48:46.959
some of those phenomena by appealing to principles that

773
00:48:46.969 --> 00:48:52.020
are essentially theological in nature. Uh So, in order

774
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:56.830
to, for Aristotle's account, ultimately, of why we reproduce

775
00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.629
and even why we move it all has to

776
00:48:59.639 --> 00:49:04.429
do with this divine principle of reason that we're

777
00:49:04.439 --> 00:49:08.770
trying to imitate. And we do that in various

778
00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:12.435
ways, plants do it by reproducing things of their

779
00:49:12.445 --> 00:49:16.445
kind and sort of creating these cycles that resemble

780
00:49:16.544 --> 00:49:21.745
the cycles that the, the stars move in animals

781
00:49:21.754 --> 00:49:25.985
do it by their self motion and their use

782
00:49:25.995 --> 00:49:28.885
of perception and humans do it by their use

783
00:49:28.895 --> 00:49:32.810
of reason. But at the same time, Aristotle thinks

784
00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:35.090
that, you know, how do we explain stuff about

785
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:40.639
the gods? Well, he uses principles from his account

786
00:49:40.649 --> 00:49:46.330
of animal motion in order to explain things about

787
00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:49.370
his God, which he conceives of as a living

788
00:49:49.379 --> 00:49:51.409
thing. So it is a kind of animal and

789
00:49:51.419 --> 00:49:53.139
it's even a thinking thing and it has to

790
00:49:53.149 --> 00:49:57.020
have pleasure and it, and uh this sort of

791
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:59.010
thing, I think it's ridiculous to have an idea

792
00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:02.489
of a God that doesn't enjoy what it's doing

793
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:06.000
and or or doesn't do anything. So, um but

794
00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:11.330
in order to explain the activities of His God

795
00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:15.429
and what and how His God enjoys pleasure and

796
00:50:15.439 --> 00:50:18.169
so forth and the kind of motion that that

797
00:50:18.179 --> 00:50:22.770
God causes. He falls back on some biological principles.

798
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.790
So he thinks that the stars are these divine

799
00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:29.090
entities that are gods, but we can only explain

800
00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:33.939
how they move in perfect circles by referring to

801
00:50:33.949 --> 00:50:36.879
how any kind of animal motion works. So he

802
00:50:36.889 --> 00:50:40.409
refers to principles from the beginning of his on

803
00:50:40.419 --> 00:50:43.780
the motion of animals in, in order to explain

804
00:50:44.679 --> 00:50:49.270
um how these divine entities, the stars move in

805
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.899
his work on the heaven. Uh So there are

806
00:50:53.909 --> 00:50:59.500
principles taken from biology to explain theological facts. And

807
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:04.090
there are theological principles utilized to explain biological facts.

808
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:06.219
And I think we can keep all of this

809
00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:09.540
straight and not just mash the, the, the, the

810
00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:12.830
two together, they are two different sciences, but they

811
00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:17.580
are two different theoretical sciences. And there is no

812
00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:23.169
problem with them utilizing principles uh from one in

813
00:51:23.179 --> 00:51:25.330
the case that they could be tied directly to

814
00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:27.290
the phenomena being explained.

815
00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:31.800
So let's talk a little bit about democ then.

816
00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:37.560
So these democracies of ab there a guy who

817
00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:41.699
was he? Exactly. And what was he interested in?

818
00:51:42.689 --> 00:51:45.629
Um Well, yeah, he's, he's a guy from, from

819
00:51:45.639 --> 00:51:50.550
ABD um AAA famous famously sort of backwater and

820
00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:58.709
backwards kind of place. So um he um Aristotle

821
00:51:58.719 --> 00:52:03.830
calls him his most important predecessor by far in

822
00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:07.510
the field of natural philosophy and he's including Plato

823
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:11.419
in that discussion. So Aristotle, Aristotle actually says no

824
00:52:11.429 --> 00:52:15.709
one, no one other than Democrats has touched on

825
00:52:15.719 --> 00:52:20.459
these issues in natural philosophy more than superficially. OK.

826
00:52:20.469 --> 00:52:25.899
Only Democrats has democrats, democritus is like Aristotle's only

827
00:52:25.909 --> 00:52:29.719
real predecessor in the field of natural philosophy. Somewhat

828
00:52:29.729 --> 00:52:33.199
similar to the compliment Darwin paid to Aristotle when

829
00:52:33.209 --> 00:52:37.199
he said all of my predecessors are schoolboys compared

830
00:52:37.209 --> 00:52:40.409
to Aristotle. Aristotle basically said all of my predecessors

831
00:52:40.419 --> 00:52:46.290
are schoolboys compared uh to Democrats, but he has

832
00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:51.129
a very mixed um reputation in part based on

833
00:52:51.139 --> 00:52:55.800
the fact that Plato never mentions his name. OK?

834
00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:57.860
And the explanation for that seems to be if

835
00:52:57.870 --> 00:53:01.070
you really hate someone and you really want to

836
00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.669
deny their influence on your own thinking. Then the

837
00:53:03.679 --> 00:53:05.360
last thing you do is cite them in any

838
00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:07.870
kind of footnote. Uh And you just pretend like

839
00:53:07.879 --> 00:53:11.449
they don't, they don't exist. But another problem is

840
00:53:11.459 --> 00:53:15.939
that Democrats became this sort of ma associated with

841
00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:22.469
materialist, hedonist, empiricist philosophy that was for various reasons

842
00:53:22.479 --> 00:53:28.479
opposed to Aristotle and Plato and then eventually condemned

843
00:53:28.489 --> 00:53:31.439
and, and, and, and as it was a, as

844
00:53:31.449 --> 00:53:34.689
you took one of its biggest influences on epicurean,

845
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:39.370
then it was a actually um stifled. And then,

846
00:53:39.379 --> 00:53:41.949
and, and, and Christian authorities tried to stamp it

847
00:53:41.959 --> 00:53:47.570
out and actually burned all of the books of

848
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:50.669
Democrats and other materialist philosophers. And this is part

849
00:53:50.679 --> 00:53:55.300
of the explanation for why certain works have survived

850
00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:59.080
and certain others haven't. So none of democritus's works

851
00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:02.489
have established intact. There is no equivalent of the

852
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:08.989
Aristotle corpus for Democrats. There's only reports about his

853
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.830
physics, basically stemming from Aristotle and then a bunch

854
00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:17.149
of uh fragments of his ethics. But you know,

855
00:54:17.159 --> 00:54:20.889
he is treated sometimes called a Pres Socratic philosopher,

856
00:54:20.899 --> 00:54:24.350
which is a particularly inept expression uh for him

857
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:28.719
because he was a contemporary of Socrates, unlike Socrates

858
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:33.750
who wrote nothing, Democritus wrote more than anybody before

859
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.709
him and basically more than anybody before Plato is

860
00:54:36.719 --> 00:54:41.149
Socrates or Aristotle on a vast variety of topics,

861
00:54:41.709 --> 00:54:47.229
mainly physics and uh ethics, but also poetics and

862
00:54:47.239 --> 00:54:51.479
culture and music in general. Mathematics. Uh AND so

863
00:54:51.489 --> 00:54:56.959
on. Uh So that's, that's who he was. And

864
00:54:56.989 --> 00:55:03.959
he had a huge influence on later philosophy, beginning

865
00:55:03.969 --> 00:55:08.050
with Aristotle. But then especially in the hellenistic age,

866
00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:11.989
his reputation seems to have just grown and grown

867
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.570
to the point where he was being uh imitated

868
00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:20.129
by other kinds of philosophers. And almost, I mean,

869
00:55:20.139 --> 00:55:24.110
basically every philosophical school in the hellenistic age is

870
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:28.475
directly influenced by uh democrats. So that's, that's who

871
00:55:28.485 --> 00:55:31.435
he is. It takes, it takes work to recover

872
00:55:31.445 --> 00:55:35.574
and, and, and appreciate this influence and especially tricky

873
00:55:35.614 --> 00:55:38.375
working with fragments. We don't have texts like we

874
00:55:38.385 --> 00:55:40.975
do with, with Plato and Aristotle. But you know,

875
00:55:40.985 --> 00:55:43.274
if you ask Aristotle or you ask anybody in

876
00:55:43.284 --> 00:55:46.754
the hellenistic age, democritus is one of the most

877
00:55:46.764 --> 00:55:50.155
important or maybe the most important ancient philosopher.

878
00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.540
Uh And so of course, we tend to associate

879
00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:58.260
him a lot to cosmology. But uh and you

880
00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:01.419
also mentioned ethics there. But what other kinds of

881
00:56:01.429 --> 00:56:03.899
questions did you work on?

882
00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:09.639
Well, as you say, he's, he's most famous probably

883
00:56:09.649 --> 00:56:12.350
for his, for his cosmology, but really for the

884
00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:16.879
invention of atom is OK. So the theory uh

885
00:56:16.889 --> 00:56:22.790
that reality consists of atoms and void. OK? That

886
00:56:23.169 --> 00:56:27.929
uh sensible qualities like hot and cold, red and

887
00:56:27.939 --> 00:56:32.979
green, uh bitter and sweet and so forth um

888
00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:37.399
are all a matter of the way that atoms

889
00:56:37.409 --> 00:56:40.989
are moving in a void and are juxtaposed and

890
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.580
rearranged and collide with each other. And a conception

891
00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:49.939
of a human being as an aggregate of atoms

892
00:56:49.949 --> 00:56:53.290
and void. And all of the sensible objects or

893
00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:56.870
external objects, also consisting of atoms and void and

894
00:56:56.879 --> 00:57:01.899
trying to come up with explanations about how the

895
00:57:01.909 --> 00:57:05.250
phenomena, you know, the the as as we perceive

896
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:10.290
them can be explained according to these, these interactions

897
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:14.770
of uh Adams and void. Now, he applied that

898
00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:20.429
theory into a vast range of natural sciences beginning

899
00:57:20.439 --> 00:57:24.439
with things, you know, uh elemental physics and what

900
00:57:24.449 --> 00:57:26.510
we would consider like chemistry and that sort of

901
00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:33.429
thing, but also explanations of plants, uh animals, meteorological,

902
00:57:34.129 --> 00:57:42.100
uh phenomena, astronomical phenomena, um but also human beings

903
00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:48.659
and human civilization and the development of um uh

904
00:57:48.669 --> 00:57:52.300
the, the, the, the development of human technologies and

905
00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:54.459
civilizations and things like that. So he has, he

906
00:57:54.469 --> 00:57:58.590
has an all embracing naturalistic account that starts with

907
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.629
the fundamental level level of atoms and void and

908
00:58:01.639 --> 00:58:06.504
ends with the level of human institutions like political

909
00:58:06.695 --> 00:58:10.264
and religious institutions and so forth and, and by

910
00:58:10.274 --> 00:58:15.155
means of, of one ideological account, trying to explain

911
00:58:15.165 --> 00:58:19.465
it all. And so obviously, that's inspirational for various

912
00:58:19.475 --> 00:58:27.659
kinds of materialist, atomist um uh systems of explanation

913
00:58:27.669 --> 00:58:35.070
and alternatives to Platonic Aristotelian uh metaphysics. Um But

914
00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:39.909
then he not only contributed to ethics and I

915
00:58:39.919 --> 00:58:42.169
can say more about that if you like, but

916
00:58:42.179 --> 00:58:46.209
especially social political philosophy. And so one of the

917
00:58:46.219 --> 00:58:50.870
main things I love about Democrats is that he

918
00:58:50.879 --> 00:58:59.280
is one of the only promo democratic philosophers. OK.

919
00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:03.469
And one of the only ones that any promo

920
00:59:03.639 --> 00:59:06.929
democratic statement of his has survived. So, you know,

921
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:11.239
uh Plato is, you know, hated democracy, hated democratic

922
00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:15.280
freedoms and, and democracy. Socrates was a critic of

923
00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:20.040
democracy. Um Aristotle considered democracy a corrupt form of

924
00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:22.510
government. Yes, it's the least bad, but it is

925
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:25.860
a corrupt and perverse uh form of government. But

926
00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:31.050
democritus was pro democratic and had a, a notion

927
00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:33.280
of autonomy. In fact, in one of his fragments,

928
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:36.689
he invents the notion of autonomy, talks about applying

929
00:59:36.699 --> 00:59:41.570
a law to yourself, to your own soul. And

930
00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:47.659
he says that um that uh freedom in a

931
00:59:47.669 --> 00:59:51.479
democratic government is, is much better than so called

932
00:59:51.489 --> 00:59:57.070
prosperity or Monia under dynastic and, you know, kind

933
00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:03.739
of tyrannical rule than uh freedom is better than

934
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:10.179
slavery. And so, uh he's, he's a actual pro

935
01:00:10.689 --> 01:00:13.919
democratic theorist and that is so extremely rare and

936
01:00:13.929 --> 01:00:15.709
people don't, don't realize this. They think, oh the

937
01:00:15.719 --> 01:00:18.330
Greeks, they're all, they're all pro democracy. We don't

938
01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.409
have any pro democracy works to figure out what

939
01:00:21.419 --> 01:00:24.330
arguments people were making in favor of democracy and

940
01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:27.889
antiquity. We have to reverse engineer it from their

941
01:00:27.899 --> 01:00:32.449
critics like Plato Aristotle, the old oligarch and so

942
01:00:32.459 --> 01:00:37.350
forth or look for tiny fri of pro democratic

943
01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:42.260
writers like Democrats. And he wrote about democracy. He

944
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:47.020
wrote about the problems of Democrats holding uh offices.

945
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:50.040
He wrote about the relations between rich and poor.

946
01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:54.219
And he has this amazing social political philosophy that,

947
01:00:54.229 --> 01:00:57.149
that is intertwined with his ethical philosophy. And also

948
01:00:57.159 --> 01:01:00.149
with his theory of education and his theory of

949
01:01:00.159 --> 01:01:03.179
the history of culture and civilization, which as I

950
01:01:03.189 --> 01:01:08.219
said before is also tied in to his naturalistic

951
01:01:08.229 --> 01:01:12.239
uh theory of explanation and the other sciences.

952
01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.370
So tell us just a little bit about his

953
01:01:16.379 --> 01:01:19.659
uh ethics then. So what did the, what were

954
01:01:19.689 --> 01:01:22.159
his spots on the the topic?

955
01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:28.570
Well, um right, so I talk about the major

956
01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.750
areas that he's had an influence in and that

957
01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.340
we have fragments that show him practicing this kind

958
01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:37.219
of philosophy. So one thing is, you know, we

959
01:01:37.229 --> 01:01:40.429
talk about new dyin theories of philosophy uh of,

960
01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:45.659
of ethics, right, centered on the happiness or success

961
01:01:45.669 --> 01:01:50.889
or prosperity of the agent. And he uh like

962
01:01:50.899 --> 01:01:55.129
Plato and Aristotle used this term eudaimonia and seems

963
01:01:55.139 --> 01:01:58.139
to have conceived of, of ethics as a means

964
01:01:58.149 --> 01:02:03.899
of bringing about eudaimonia. Um He also engaged in

965
01:02:03.909 --> 01:02:07.449
what we call virtue theory, theorizing what the virtues

966
01:02:07.459 --> 01:02:11.719
are uh and relating human goods to these kinds

967
01:02:11.729 --> 01:02:17.000
of virtues. He also like Socrates and Plato and

968
01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:21.570
to AAA slightly lesser extent, Aristotle had an influence

969
01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:24.409
on and was one of the in exceptional figures

970
01:02:24.419 --> 01:02:28.479
of intellectualism. So the the the conception of the

971
01:02:28.489 --> 01:02:31.810
virtues and ultimately, of human happiness is having something

972
01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:36.820
to do with knowledge uh or understanding. And finally,

973
01:02:36.830 --> 01:02:41.719
the most important aspect I think of, of, of

974
01:02:41.729 --> 01:02:47.250
hellenistic ethics. He conceived of ethics as being therapeutic

975
01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:51.750
as having a therapeutic dimension that analogous and he's

976
01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.959
the first person to make this analogy, medicine takes

977
01:02:55.969 --> 01:02:58.860
care of the ills and diseases of the body.

978
01:02:59.159 --> 01:03:06.040
Wisdom takes care of the um ills and diseases

979
01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:09.820
and troubles of the mind or the soul and

980
01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:12.860
that these are in parallel. And so he has

981
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:20.659
a Eudaimonic virtue, theoretic, intellectual and therapeutic uh set

982
01:03:20.669 --> 01:03:24.010
of ethics. And the uh and another important thing

983
01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.919
to realize here and it connects to what I

984
01:03:26.929 --> 01:03:29.889
was saying about democracy is that he has this

985
01:03:29.899 --> 01:03:34.479
notion of autonomy, which because Plato and Aristotle and

986
01:03:34.489 --> 01:03:39.375
Socrates are also anti democracy, they do not have

987
01:03:39.635 --> 01:03:43.034
concepts of autonomy. And they think that we need

988
01:03:43.044 --> 01:03:48.574
to instill virtue by uh punishments and rewards and

989
01:03:48.584 --> 01:03:54.764
political artifices. OK. Whereas uh Democrats thinks you can

990
01:03:54.774 --> 01:04:00.840
use exhortation and reasoning and education in order to

991
01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:04.399
make people kind of self governing and bring about

992
01:04:04.409 --> 01:04:08.040
their own happiness and bring about their own virtues.

993
01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:10.340
And that it's better to do it this way

994
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:15.060
than to impose it top down through uh political

995
01:04:15.165 --> 01:04:19.304
structure. So this is another enormously, you know, resonant

996
01:04:19.475 --> 01:04:22.745
part of his, of his philosophy. And, and one

997
01:04:22.754 --> 01:04:27.725
that despite all the enthusiasm for Plato's Socrates and

998
01:04:27.735 --> 01:04:31.014
uh Aristotle's ethics, if we care about democracy and

999
01:04:31.024 --> 01:04:33.145
autonomy, we should, we should care a little bit

1000
01:04:33.155 --> 01:04:36.655
more about this, this view of, of democritus.

1001
01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:40.459
So let me ask you now, a little bit

1002
01:04:40.469 --> 01:04:44.520
about greco-roman philosophy. So how do you look at

1003
01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:48.649
the relationship between Greek and Roman philosophy? And why

1004
01:04:48.659 --> 01:04:51.709
do you think that we tend to sort of

1005
01:04:51.719 --> 01:04:55.570
blend them together a little bit when we mention

1006
01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:59.330
or use this term or a term like greco-roman

1007
01:04:59.340 --> 01:04:59.959
philosophy?

1008
01:05:01.679 --> 01:05:06.310
Well, I I'm glad that that term is being

1009
01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.419
adopted and um used and I think it is

1010
01:05:10.429 --> 01:05:13.979
the correct description. I mean, there's a tendency earlier

1011
01:05:13.989 --> 01:05:17.399
to just describe it as philosophy, but we have

1012
01:05:17.409 --> 01:05:20.879
these other wisdom traditions that we should probably also

1013
01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:25.260
describe as philosophy such as uh wisdom traditions written

1014
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:28.520
in Chinese or written in Sanskrit, you know, Indian

1015
01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:32.320
philosophy. Um And so I use the term Greco

1016
01:05:32.439 --> 01:05:35.379
Roman in order to indicate, you know, I don't

1017
01:05:35.389 --> 01:05:38.219
again, I don't think the term ancient philosophy is

1018
01:05:38.229 --> 01:05:42.000
adequate because these are there's other ancient philosophy. So

1019
01:05:42.149 --> 01:05:45.280
I use the term Greco Roman to indicate that

1020
01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:51.250
I'm working on a certain kind of um ancient

1021
01:05:51.409 --> 01:05:57.310
philosophy. Now, we might just call it Greek philosophy

1022
01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.270
because it's not clear that there is any unique

1023
01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:06.750
Roman contribution to, to it. Uh It's largely borrowing

1024
01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:13.070
and recasting and reconfiguring and eclectically uh combining and

1025
01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.939
essentially we're talking about Greek philosophy. So another way

1026
01:06:15.949 --> 01:06:19.110
to describe this would be Greek philosophy, Roman philosophy

1027
01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:23.405
is Greek Greek philosophy. But there are certain interesting

1028
01:06:23.415 --> 01:06:29.625
things that happen. For example, Lucretius's recasting of Greek

1029
01:06:29.635 --> 01:06:35.235
philosophy into Latin. His combination of democ democrat is

1030
01:06:35.344 --> 01:06:41.014
and epicurean into a poetic, epic poetic form. You

1031
01:06:41.024 --> 01:06:43.225
know, all, all of that's very interesting and very

1032
01:06:43.235 --> 01:06:49.350
important for the history of Latin literature, um other

1033
01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:53.229
combinations of earlier Greek philosophy that you kind of

1034
01:06:53.239 --> 01:06:55.989
wouldn't, wouldn't have in their pure form, like the

1035
01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.800
way Cicero combines academic philosophy, so actually kind of

1036
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:06.840
academic skepticism, but also combining it with, with stoic

1037
01:07:07.169 --> 01:07:12.219
uh ethics or perhaps even more dramatically. Uh Seneca

1038
01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:17.949
kind of popularizer and exhorted um of philosophy but,

1039
01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:20.929
and, and definitely a card carrying stoic but he

1040
01:07:20.939 --> 01:07:26.149
incorporates epicurean and democracy and aspects uh into his

1041
01:07:26.159 --> 01:07:30.334
philosophy quite explicitly. Um And so I think what's,

1042
01:07:30.344 --> 01:07:32.735
what's interesting about the Roman phase is sort of

1043
01:07:32.745 --> 01:07:36.645
seeing how we can combine these ideas that are

1044
01:07:36.794 --> 01:07:40.975
in the Greek phase, these warring schools that, you

1045
01:07:40.985 --> 01:07:43.604
know, you sign up for one of these schools

1046
01:07:43.614 --> 01:07:46.294
and you attack everybody in the other school and,

1047
01:07:46.304 --> 01:07:48.354
and what we get in the Roman phase is

1048
01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:50.655
this more kind of decadent? Well, let's, let's combine

1049
01:07:50.665 --> 01:07:54.014
them and let's let's take insights that are useful

1050
01:07:54.024 --> 01:07:58.479
from all of them. Um So that, that to

1051
01:07:58.489 --> 01:08:02.379
me is essentially what's going on with Roman philosophy

1052
01:08:02.389 --> 01:08:06.530
is an adaptation of Greek philosophy and a and

1053
01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:10.239
a sort of mixing uh of it a remixing

1054
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:13.199
of it in, in ways that have, have proven

1055
01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:17.640
to be enormously influential. And I think, you know,

1056
01:08:17.649 --> 01:08:23.040
largely this fanatical revival of stoicism uh that we're

1057
01:08:23.049 --> 01:08:26.859
seeing is largely because of the, the, the literary

1058
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:31.049
greatness of uh Seneca and, and, and, and that

1059
01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:34.669
really still speaks to students. And so in a,

1060
01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.979
in a way you can use Roman philosophy to

1061
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:42.240
get people interested in Greek uh philosophy, the the

1062
01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:44.569
Romans of course themselves thought, you know, if you're

1063
01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:47.100
serious about philosophy, you do Greek and there was

1064
01:08:47.109 --> 01:08:50.520
large bilingual movement because, you know, you want, you

1065
01:08:50.529 --> 01:08:52.359
want to be an educated person and not just

1066
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:57.439
in philosophy, but science certainly, but uh but also

1067
01:08:57.450 --> 01:09:00.069
culture and, and poetics and so forth. You, you

1068
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.917
needed Greek but they um they developed it and

1069
01:09:04.929 --> 01:09:07.837
extended in certain ways. Another thing is survival of

1070
01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:12.568
texts. Many less, there's actually a less of a

1071
01:09:12.578 --> 01:09:14.729
corpus of Roman type. You might think we have

1072
01:09:14.738 --> 01:09:17.457
a lot more Roman philosophy than we do Greek.

1073
01:09:17.469 --> 01:09:19.417
It, it really isn't like that, but the ones

1074
01:09:19.429 --> 01:09:22.479
we have are very precious and they often often

1075
01:09:22.488 --> 01:09:27.108
preserve fragments of earlier work. So that's, that's another

1076
01:09:27.118 --> 01:09:31.118
thing is mining Latin texts and Roman philosophy to,

1077
01:09:31.127 --> 01:09:33.389
to get back to the original Greek ideas.

1078
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:36.930
Well, I guess it was not by chance that

1079
01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:41.709
during most of our academic history, uh I mean,

1080
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.890
since the very beginning of universities and all of

1081
01:09:44.899 --> 01:09:50.129
that and until very, very, very recently, historically speaking,

1082
01:09:50.509 --> 01:09:55.330
um people uh people had to learn to read

1083
01:09:55.339 --> 01:09:57.549
and write Latin and Greek,

1084
01:09:57.919 --> 01:10:01.459
right? Well, and, and especially Latin. So actually, here's

1085
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:06.700
another crucial thing about philosophy written in Latin. And

1086
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:09.899
as it were Roman philosophy is that, you know,

1087
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:13.660
an educated person throughout the middle ages throughout the

1088
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:17.430
renaissance and basically throughout the early modern period had

1089
01:10:17.439 --> 01:10:19.819
to be able to read and write and work

1090
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:24.620
in Latin. OK. And I mean, Greek, yes, to

1091
01:10:24.629 --> 01:10:27.729
some extent in some places and at sometimes, but

1092
01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:31.549
definitely Latin. And so the great, a lot of

1093
01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:36.200
the great uh early modern philosophers are themselves writing

1094
01:10:36.209 --> 01:10:40.169
in Latin and they were their own education was

1095
01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:44.310
in Latin. And so we actually find that, that

1096
01:10:44.319 --> 01:10:47.020
Roman philosophy because they were, they were cutting their

1097
01:10:47.029 --> 01:10:53.419
teeth on Seneca and Cicero, that their conception of

1098
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:56.390
ancient philosophy is largely what we find in Seneca

1099
01:10:56.509 --> 01:11:01.189
and Cicero. So it's largely hellenistic philosophy and you

1100
01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.049
know, it, it, it surprises people that, you know,

1101
01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:07.859
Kant. Why isn't he more directly referring to Plato

1102
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:10.830
and Aristotle, for example? Well, because the, the text

1103
01:11:10.839 --> 01:11:13.180
that he was steeped in are the, the Latin

1104
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:16.029
based ones. And so he's talking about epicureans and

1105
01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.910
stoicism. So that's a, that's another crucial thing about

1106
01:11:18.919 --> 01:11:23.020
Roman philosophy is because of the accident of what

1107
01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:27.740
languages were being used. And, and, and the preeminence

1108
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:32.649
of, of Latin that Roman philosophy becomes ever more

1109
01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:35.609
important because that's just the text you read in

1110
01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.830
order to train yourself in the language, you needed

1111
01:11:37.839 --> 01:11:38.700
to do anything.

1112
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:43.270
Yeah. No, I, I guess, yeah. No, go ahead.

1113
01:11:43.279 --> 01:11:45.029
Sorry. No, no, no. And, and, and so you're,

1114
01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.129
you're, you're very right that, that the, this idea

1115
01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:52.680
that education consists of number one, learning Latin and

1116
01:11:52.689 --> 01:11:55.209
then number two, if you're really deep getting in

1117
01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:58.970
into Greek is a lot of the, the reason

1118
01:11:58.979 --> 01:12:03.540
why, um, you know, that, why, why these philosophies

1119
01:12:03.549 --> 01:12:06.100
have had the influence that they've had and the

1120
01:12:06.109 --> 01:12:08.290
importance that they continue to have.

1121
01:12:09.129 --> 01:12:12.080
Yeah, I guess that it's not very often that

1122
01:12:12.089 --> 01:12:15.149
it crosses our minds that until at least the

1123
01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.500
19th century m most or many, or even all

1124
01:12:19.509 --> 01:12:23.959
of the great thinkers, the scientists, the philosophers, when

1125
01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:28.189
they mentioned, uh, I don't know, ancient Greeks and

1126
01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:32.209
Romans, they were actually reading the original texts in

1127
01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.100
Latin and Greek. Right.

1128
01:12:34.319 --> 01:12:36.910
That's right. That's right. That's exactly correct.

1129
01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:41.509
So, uh and of course, we've already mentioned here

1130
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:46.649
uh in passage, the fact that greco-roman philosophy have

1131
01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:50.810
a huge influence on the history of philosophy and

1132
01:12:50.819 --> 01:12:55.390
science. But since you also mentioned that and correctly,

1133
01:12:55.399 --> 01:12:59.430
that we have other philosophical traditions like the Indian

1134
01:12:59.439 --> 01:13:04.169
tradition, the Chinese tradition, the Persian tradition and others.

1135
01:13:04.450 --> 01:13:07.729
Uh uh uh uh How much inf influence influential

1136
01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:12.080
do you think that greco-roman philosophy was when it

1137
01:13:12.089 --> 01:13:15.770
comes to the history of philosophy and science specifically?

1138
01:13:16.939 --> 01:13:20.879
Well, um it might surprise you, my approach to

1139
01:13:20.890 --> 01:13:24.779
this is, is less in looking at the history

1140
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:27.189
and the past, then this is how I think

1141
01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:31.040
of sort of the future of philosophy. So, you

1142
01:13:31.049 --> 01:13:33.759
know, to me, a large part of the future

1143
01:13:33.770 --> 01:13:36.589
of philosophy and particularly the future of the history

1144
01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:42.520
of philosophy is going to be getting better understanding

1145
01:13:42.529 --> 01:13:45.040
or maybe I should just say understanding because it's

1146
01:13:45.049 --> 01:13:48.160
so weak at present that we can hardly hardly

1147
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:51.540
just hope to better it until we get more

1148
01:13:51.549 --> 01:13:55.620
of an understanding of it. But understanding and integrating

1149
01:13:55.629 --> 01:14:03.290
and comparing Chinese and Indian philosophy with Greek and

1150
01:14:03.299 --> 01:14:07.479
Greco Roman uh philosophy I think is the future

1151
01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:11.439
of philosophy and the future of the history of

1152
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:16.979
philosophy. And this requires um difficult skills, which is

1153
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:20.459
why it's so hard to practice starting with the

1154
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:24.060
linguistic skills of actually being able to read classical

1155
01:14:24.069 --> 01:14:27.470
Chinese or what's even more difficult because they don't

1156
01:14:27.479 --> 01:14:31.069
teach it in Indian high schools to learn Sanskrit

1157
01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:37.870
or um Poli. OK. So, um but it's incredible

1158
01:14:37.879 --> 01:14:41.950
to think that there are these enormous ancient philosophies

1159
01:14:41.959 --> 01:14:45.040
divided into all kinds of different schools and with

1160
01:14:45.049 --> 01:14:47.910
their own disputes and with their own concepts of

1161
01:14:47.919 --> 01:14:52.415
logic and epistemology and physics and so forth. I

1162
01:14:52.424 --> 01:14:56.814
mean, we obsess over tiny scraps, you know, whatever

1163
01:14:56.825 --> 01:14:59.884
we can, we can see with satellite telemetry on,

1164
01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:03.134
on Charred scrolls coming out of herculaneum if we

1165
01:15:03.145 --> 01:15:06.455
can get one or two characters or a word.

1166
01:15:06.464 --> 01:15:13.714
Meanwhile, there are thousands of Chinese and Sanskrit texts

1167
01:15:13.725 --> 01:15:17.930
that have never been edited critically. Um uh YOU

1168
01:15:17.939 --> 01:15:21.609
know, much less translated, much less commented upon, much

1169
01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:28.549
less um uh brought into communication with and compared

1170
01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:33.310
with our Western philosophical tradition, Greco Roman tradition. So

1171
01:15:33.509 --> 01:15:37.740
I expect all our, our philosophy to be really

1172
01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:44.149
enhanced and improved and diversified by um taking these

1173
01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.189
into, into account. Um And so I, I think

1174
01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.390
that's the future of it. Now, in terms of,

1175
01:15:51.399 --> 01:15:54.439
in terms of the past, there's some questions to

1176
01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:57.839
be answered about, you know, the possibility of direct

1177
01:15:57.850 --> 01:16:03.479
communication between these traditions. And I, I have written

1178
01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:08.580
some stuff critical of the idea that uh for

1179
01:16:08.589 --> 01:16:15.029
example, uh Greek pianism, pian skepticism is actually just

1180
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.520
a form of Buddhism as has been argued in

1181
01:16:17.529 --> 01:16:20.169
a, in a recent monograph by Christopher Duck with

1182
01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:23.049
published by Princeton University Press. And there are other

1183
01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:26.490
people that think that Buddhism had such a direct

1184
01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.830
influence that we should be as an historical matter

1185
01:16:29.839 --> 01:16:34.080
of fact, attributing forms of Greek skepticism to this.

1186
01:16:34.209 --> 01:16:37.000
I don't think that any of that's been proven,

1187
01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:38.970
I would be the first person to be, to

1188
01:16:38.979 --> 01:16:41.790
be excited and acknowledge if we could find those.

1189
01:16:41.799 --> 01:16:43.819
I don't think that's, that's been figured out yet,

1190
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:46.020
but that's an example of the kind of work

1191
01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.299
that needs to be done much more carefully, but

1192
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:53.740
more interesting than that than actually looking at historical,

1193
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:58.020
the possibility of, of historical connections between them is

1194
01:16:58.029 --> 01:17:03.359
comparing the ideas, OK, comparing them and, and especially

1195
01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:07.080
looking for different ways of conceiving of the world

1196
01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:10.600
because we have a lot of philosophical problems. OK?

1197
01:17:10.609 --> 01:17:12.490
That, that still need to be worked out. I

1198
01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.020
mean, a lot of them are basically in the

1199
01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:18.080
same condition as when Aristotle explained what the problem

1200
01:17:18.089 --> 01:17:20.609
is to us. And we have warring camps that

1201
01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:24.073
have developed quite intricate systems on both sides. But

1202
01:17:24.333 --> 01:17:26.522
to, to some extent what we need is new

1203
01:17:26.533 --> 01:17:31.152
ways of conceiving of the problems themselves, new approaches

1204
01:17:31.163 --> 01:17:35.232
to similar problems and, you know, new concepts, new

1205
01:17:35.243 --> 01:17:38.993
ideas, new configurations of thinking. And so I, to

1206
01:17:39.002 --> 01:17:41.752
me, it's not as much actually about the, the

1207
01:17:41.763 --> 01:17:45.505
past as the few of philosophy. Once we get

1208
01:17:45.516 --> 01:17:48.625
good enough, get out of the pathetic state of,

1209
01:17:48.636 --> 01:17:52.136
of linguistic incompetence so that these are just sort

1210
01:17:52.145 --> 01:17:56.186
of isolated islands of, of, of philosophy and start,

1211
01:17:56.335 --> 01:17:59.715
you know, bringing them together into a true global

1212
01:17:59.726 --> 01:18:02.945
world philosophy where we can, we can compare these

1213
01:18:02.956 --> 01:18:03.655
ideas.

1214
01:18:04.450 --> 01:18:06.490
Yeah. And, and I guess, I mean, on the

1215
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:10.290
show, I've talked of course, with many different scientists,

1216
01:18:10.299 --> 01:18:14.189
particularly social scientists and even more specifically, people who

1217
01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.439
work on cultural evolution. And I guess that this

1218
01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:20.629
would be a very great way of uh bringing

1219
01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.109
together the humanities, particularly philosophy and the sciences because

1220
01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:28.049
it's also very interesting to study and understand a

1221
01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:32.689
little bit better where for example, differences in cognition

1222
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:36.910
between uh the in the West stem from and

1223
01:18:36.919 --> 01:18:41.390
how those manifest in different philosophies, for example.

1224
01:18:41.419 --> 01:18:45.830
Yes, absolutely. And you know, g er Lloyd has

1225
01:18:45.839 --> 01:18:50.689
done tremendous work on this and really, really um

1226
01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:55.160
for the Western audience or people, people reading books

1227
01:18:55.169 --> 01:18:58.370
in English, shown a model of doing this but

1228
01:18:58.379 --> 01:19:02.479
also shown why it's important because the similarities are

1229
01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:05.089
important, why they came up with similar things. And

1230
01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.870
in some cases, the exact same thing atom is

1231
01:19:07.899 --> 01:19:13.589
for example, was indigenously developed in in India, in

1232
01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.250
the Naia school and in other materialist schools and

1233
01:19:18.259 --> 01:19:22.520
possibly forms of atoms in in Chinese philosophy. So

1234
01:19:22.529 --> 01:19:24.879
that's very interesting why you know, was were they

1235
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:27.689
responding to the same kinds of problems or different

1236
01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:31.060
problems but coming up with the same uh solution.

1237
01:19:31.069 --> 01:19:34.169
But then of course, even more important the differences,

1238
01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:40.029
different ways of looking uh at these things. And

1239
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:46.339
so yes, in, in any account of cultural evolution

1240
01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:50.759
and the true global history of science is going

1241
01:19:50.770 --> 01:19:52.569
to have to take all of this into account.

1242
01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:56.339
And that really means philosophy because philosophy is where

1243
01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:59.049
sort of all of these various texts of different

1244
01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:03.350
kinds of, of, of science are, are, are deposited

1245
01:20:03.359 --> 01:20:06.169
and and and kind of remain in these traditions

1246
01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.140
just like in, in, in the Greek tradition, they're

1247
01:20:09.149 --> 01:20:11.729
conceived of, you know, all, all of these sciences

1248
01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:14.799
and everything are basically ways of doing philosophy, their

1249
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:18.160
wisdom traditions. I mean, and so maybe, maybe this

1250
01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:20.700
is the the final point about this is that

1251
01:20:22.399 --> 01:20:24.629
there are people that think that philosophy is a

1252
01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.779
Greek word and that it was invented on a

1253
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:30.359
street corner in Milius and you know, by Thales

1254
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:33.450
and at a certain date, a certain Tuesday in

1255
01:20:33.459 --> 01:20:35.439
the sixth century or whatever. And that we shouldn't

1256
01:20:35.450 --> 01:20:38.720
use the term philosophy for these other traditions because

1257
01:20:38.729 --> 01:20:42.310
they didn't use that Greek term. And I, I

1258
01:20:42.319 --> 01:20:44.680
used to think, you know, that's just ridiculous because

1259
01:20:44.689 --> 01:20:46.490
what they're doing is philosophy. But I'm starting to

1260
01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:49.450
think that, well, there's actually a wider phenomenon here

1261
01:20:49.459 --> 01:20:53.770
of, of wisdom traditions and maybe philosophy is a

1262
01:20:53.779 --> 01:20:57.459
specific approach to wisdom traditions. And by the way,

1263
01:20:57.470 --> 01:21:00.439
Democrats never used the term philosophy. He did use

1264
01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:02.649
the term wisdom. And there's a way of thinking

1265
01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:05.419
of him as a sort of person working in

1266
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:08.500
a wisdom tradition instead of instead of a philosophy

1267
01:21:08.509 --> 01:21:09.060
tradition.

1268
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:14.180
So uh I have then one last question that

1269
01:21:14.189 --> 01:21:15.970
I would like to ask you, I know that

1270
01:21:15.979 --> 01:21:20.160
you're, you are working with uh some other people

1271
01:21:20.169 --> 01:21:23.700
like Donald R, Ruford and Enrico Per Giao on

1272
01:21:23.709 --> 01:21:27.149
a translation from Latin to English of an early

1273
01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:32.549
modern work by Pierre Gas and the entitled Epicurus

1274
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:36.859
System of Philosophy. So would you like to tell

1275
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:37.370
us about it?

1276
01:21:37.899 --> 01:21:40.180
Very good? Yes, I mean, thank you so much

1277
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:42.879
for asking about that. Um This is a work

1278
01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:47.939
of early modern philosophy by an important renaissance to

1279
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:52.700
early modern uh figure who's most famous as a

1280
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:55.830
critic of Descartes and arrival of Descartes. He wrote

1281
01:21:55.839 --> 01:21:59.830
the fifth set of objections to Descartes meditations. But

1282
01:21:59.839 --> 01:22:05.560
he had this goal of, he, he started out

1283
01:22:05.569 --> 01:22:10.279
attacking Aristotelian is and Aristotelian logic. But he needed

1284
01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:13.399
to get beyond his negative approach to that and

1285
01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:15.970
find a system. He thought he could sort of

1286
01:22:15.979 --> 01:22:21.839
replace Aristotelian scholasticism with and what he and he

1287
01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:26.990
found the solution in ancient Epicurean is really Democrats

1288
01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:33.200
and Epicurean, but Epicurean and he develops this system

1289
01:22:33.509 --> 01:22:37.560
of philosophy that he calls Epicurus system of philosophy,

1290
01:22:37.569 --> 01:22:43.549
the, the Syntagma of Epicurus philosophy. And it basically

1291
01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:51.000
consists of, you know, empiricism in epistemology, um atom

1292
01:22:51.009 --> 01:22:55.350
is in its physics or metaphysics and hedonism in

1293
01:22:55.359 --> 01:23:00.919
its ethics. And this was enormously influential on various

1294
01:23:01.169 --> 01:23:06.290
uh other figures like Locke and Hobbes. Uh AND

1295
01:23:06.299 --> 01:23:11.020
even Newton. Um And uh in a way, I

1296
01:23:11.029 --> 01:23:15.490
think that unlike Descartes, who, you know, nobody tries

1297
01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.669
to base their science on, you know, personal assurance

1298
01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.259
of certainty or something like in the meditations. And

1299
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:25.399
nobody takes that seriously anymore. What we take seriously

1300
01:23:25.410 --> 01:23:27.750
and kind of the worldview that we have the

1301
01:23:27.759 --> 01:23:33.060
modern scientific worldview is this one developed by GSI,

1302
01:23:33.529 --> 01:23:40.819
this materialist hedonist empiricist approach. And it's just interesting

1303
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:44.180
that when we look at how it got established,

1304
01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:46.859
it seems so modern and everything. And, and so

1305
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:49.200
we go back to the early modern philosophers and

1306
01:23:49.209 --> 01:23:51.600
find, well, where, where did they get it and

1307
01:23:51.609 --> 01:23:55.120
where they got it was antiquity. OK. They self

1308
01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:59.720
consciously developed it from um Epicurus. So I'm just

1309
01:23:59.729 --> 01:24:03.009
fascinated with this text. And one other interesting thing

1310
01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:06.569
about it is its literary form. So it's, it's

1311
01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:12.520
actually an appendix to a gigantic commentary and critical

1312
01:24:12.529 --> 01:24:15.270
edition that he did on a Source of Epicurus,

1313
01:24:15.279 --> 01:24:20.879
Diogenes Laos's book 10. But in this, his, his

1314
01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:24.185
friend said, look, nobody's basically gonna read this. We

1315
01:24:24.194 --> 01:24:26.104
need some kind of summary of what this philosophy

1316
01:24:26.115 --> 01:24:30.044
is about. And that's what the uh small Syntagma

1317
01:24:30.055 --> 01:24:32.504
is. And in it, he says, I'm gonna speak

1318
01:24:32.515 --> 01:24:35.415
as epicurus. And so he speaks in the first

1319
01:24:35.424 --> 01:24:38.345
person I hold this, I hold that and tries

1320
01:24:38.354 --> 01:24:45.569
to elaborate Epicurus's philosophy himself, beginning with his logic

1321
01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:48.540
or canonic and then his physics and then his

1322
01:24:48.549 --> 01:24:51.759
ethics and gives us this entire system of philosophy

1323
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:56.020
that is supposed to not only be a solid

1324
01:24:56.029 --> 01:24:59.279
philosophy coming from antiquity, but to be fully compatible

1325
01:24:59.290 --> 01:25:02.819
with the latest scientific developments and give us a

1326
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:07.120
way of conceiving of ourselves and of science. That's

1327
01:25:07.129 --> 01:25:09.879
an alternative to the Aristotelian one.

1328
01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:14.870
Great. So would you like to tell us where

1329
01:25:14.879 --> 01:25:17.229
people can find you and your work on the

1330
01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:17.790
internet?

1331
01:25:18.689 --> 01:25:21.830
Uh Sure. So I've, I've got a profile up

1332
01:25:21.839 --> 01:25:26.950
on this wonderful uh website called Phil People Fill

1333
01:25:26.959 --> 01:25:31.709
Papers, which was developed uh by philosophers for philosophers.

1334
01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.870
All of my publications are available on that. We

1335
01:25:34.879 --> 01:25:43.669
also have a website, www.protreptic.info, which has stuff on

1336
01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:50.109
the Protreptic project, including the latest version, uh the

1337
01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:53.689
most recent version of our reconstruction, but also links

1338
01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:56.629
to our essays and that sort of thing. And,

1339
01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.790
but you can, you can also uh find me

1340
