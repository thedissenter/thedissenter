00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.769
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:05.480
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Loops. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.489 --> 00:00:07.840
joined for a second time by Dr Joseph Leo.

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.159
He is the Ariel Lucy Moses, Professor of Science

5
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.869
at New York University. Last time we talked about

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.030
his book, The Deep History Of Ourselves. I'm leaving

7
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.760
a link to it in the description of the

8
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.379
interview. And today we're talking about his latest book,

9
00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:27.010
The Four Realms Of Existence, a new Theory of

10
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.370
being human. So, Doctor Ludo, welcome back to the

11
00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:32.259
show. It's always a pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.130
Thank you for having me again mccarter.

13
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.770
So, just to introduce the topic here uh in

14
00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:42.319
the book, you go through four realms of what

15
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.569
you call uh existence, bodily, neural, cognitive and conscious.

16
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.159
We're going to talk about each of them. But

17
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.250
at the very beginning of the book, one of

18
00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:54.340
the first things you touch on is the idea

19
00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.740
of mind, body dualism. So where do you think

20
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.069
it stems from? And why is it important to

21
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.888
refer to it in the context of your book?

22
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.529
Exactly what I refer to it as a way

23
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.389
to dispose of it, not to uh celebrate it

24
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.389
then. Sure, you know, traditionally, mind body dualism goes

25
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.139
back in, you know, to dear, um I mean,

26
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.620
long before him, but he had a particular kind

27
00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:28.370
of mind, body dualism called interaction is where the,

28
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.440
the soul or the mind could interact with the

29
00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:35.550
body through the famous pineal gland. That, that was

30
00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:41.540
the idea. And so philosophers ever since uh have

31
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.669
been struggling with, you know, mind and body and

32
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.029
are they separate or are they different kinds of

33
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.589
uh uh substances and so forth? And to me

34
00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:56.209
in, in scientific times where we, we live now

35
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.000
where we've, you know, discovered DNA and we know

36
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.739
all about, you know, atoms and molecules. Um YOU

37
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.479
know, if, if you start talking about looking for

38
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.949
a spirit in the brain, you're looking for something

39
00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.169
that is not physical in the brain, you're never

40
00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:16.679
gonna find that. And that's the whole problem for

41
00:02:16.688 --> 00:02:20.328
me with uh my colleague David Chalmers and uh

42
00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.759
Tom Nago, both of whom are at NYU. I

43
00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:28.958
don't believe that the, the qualia are ineffable uh

44
00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:34.240
non-physical entities. You know, that's fine for a philosophical

45
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.009
theory, but it's a nonstarter for a scientific theory.

46
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.270
If it's not physical, you can't study it. So

47
00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:43.149
it's not science. And with one thing that happens

48
00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:48.490
is that, you know, science and philosophy were once

49
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.990
kind of, you know, way back, like in the

50
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.039
19th century, there was a lot of interaction, but

51
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.190
then it kind of they fell apart. And right

52
00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.550
now where we are is at a situation where

53
00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.880
philosophy has come in and is providing all of

54
00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.509
the conceptual major points from which scientists pursue things

55
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.229
like consciousness. And I, you know, I think it's,

56
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.850
it's useful to have a, a philosophical theory as

57
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.300
a grounding point, but it should really be a

58
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.880
starting point. And you can't expect the science that

59
00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.559
results from that starting point to always adhere to

60
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.880
the philosophical theory because science is gonna discover things

61
00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.619
and the the dualist cling, you know, cling to

62
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.800
the idea that we're never gonna find out how

63
00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:38.440
qual works because it's non-physical. So if that's true,

64
00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:42.479
it's a nonstarter scientifically. So either it's physical or

65
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.279
it's not scientific.

66
00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:48.770
So one very interesting thing that you also talk

67
00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:52.179
about in your book is how you collaborated in

68
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.220
studies with split brain patients. So, I mean, in

69
00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.520
what ways does that connect to the ideas you

70
00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:03.059
explore in your book? And why did you get

71
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.619
interested in those kinds of studies?

72
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.270
Well, there are two questions there. Um The first,

73
00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:12.190
the first one, you know, I had two degrees

74
00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.649
in business administration and marketing. I had a master's

75
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.010
in marketing and undergraduate and business administration. And I

76
00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.950
took a course with a guy who was uh

77
00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.760
studying learning and emotion that was his class. And

78
00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:26.929
I thought that would be relevant to marketing. But

79
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.100
instead what he was doing was studying rat brains

80
00:04:29.109 --> 00:04:32.059
and memory he had worked with the esteemed Carl

81
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.179
Lashley and was trying to do what lash he

82
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.070
failed to do just to find memory in the

83
00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:40.149
brain. And he, um you know, I fell in

84
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.730
love with what he was doing. It was just

85
00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:43.890
so fantastic. I was just a small kid from

86
00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:46.529
small town in Louisiana. And, you know, I didn't

87
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.130
know you could study the brain. And so that

88
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.019
became fantastic and I worked with him for a

89
00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:52.500
few months. And then I said, this is what

90
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.630
I wanna do. And he gave me a um

91
00:04:57.049 --> 00:04:59.079
a uh uh wrote me a letter and I

92
00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:02.649
got accepted into Stony Brook uh out on Long

93
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.589
Island to do my phd. And that's where I

94
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.070
met Mike Kana and Mike and I um kind

95
00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:11.420
of hit it off right away. He had done

96
00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:15.390
his phd studying split brain patients and um in

97
00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:18.399
California at Caltech and he was about 10 years

98
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.549
older than me, still kind of a young guy.

99
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.570
Um And we came across this new set of

100
00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:29.369
patients in uh up in New England that had

101
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.690
been just operated on. And so we started doing

102
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.010
the same old stuff that, that you normally do

103
00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:36.260
with split brain patients. You know, like, you know,

104
00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:38.420
you show stimulus to the left visual field who

105
00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:41.250
goes to the right hemisphere, you say to the

106
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.589
patient, what did you see the left hemisphere is

107
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.200
the talking hemisphere? It says I didn't see anything

108
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.779
but the left hand can reach into a bag

109
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.329
and pull an apple out if we had shown

110
00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:53.220
it a picture of an apple. So we were

111
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.279
doing the same old stuff again over and over

112
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.700
again. It wasn't going anywhere. There was nothing new

113
00:05:57.709 --> 00:06:02.299
really uh until we came across one patient and

114
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:06.359
home. Um We, for some reason, I forget why,

115
00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:08.980
but we put words in the right hemisphere just

116
00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:12.079
to see if it could read anything. You know,

117
00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:15.200
one of the big issues in split brain patients

118
00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:18.910
has always been, is there someone home in the

119
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.329
left hemisphere or is all of the the conscious

120
00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:24.649
stuff coming out of the, I'm sorry, is there

121
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.790
someone home in the right hemisphere? Because the left

122
00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:29.010
hemisphere is the conscious one you talk to and

123
00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:32.899
so forth. Um And it's been difficult, it was

124
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.750
difficult to know because you could only use nonverbal

125
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.429
responses to test that, you know, could it point

126
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.549
to a picture and stuff. So that was uh

127
00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:45.489
that, that's where things stood. But we happened to

128
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.040
put some words in the right hemisphere and gave

129
00:06:50.049 --> 00:06:54.089
the boy a bunch of Scrabble letters uh to

130
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.329
see if he could spell what he saw, what

131
00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:59.299
letters he saw in the right hemisphere. Or we,

132
00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:00.760
you know, we could have put a picture like

133
00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:03.519
apple and then he would spell with his uh

134
00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:08.670
uh left hand A PPLE so he read, he

135
00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:10.769
could read the pictures or he could take, he

136
00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:13.190
could see an apple and turn it into words

137
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.589
with his left hand or he could put picture,

138
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.679
you could put a picture uh sorry, put the

139
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.959
words in the right hemisphere and he could spell

140
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.269
the name of the thing or point to the

141
00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:24.829
picture of the thing from his right hemisphere. So

142
00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:26.869
he could read in his right hemisphere, but he

143
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.040
couldn't talk from it. So we said, OK, that's

144
00:07:31.049 --> 00:07:33.820
interesting if you can read common words there. But

145
00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:36.929
does he have uh a social sense? You know,

146
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.799
we asked, we put the letters in the left

147
00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:43.730
visual field, what is your name? And the left

148
00:07:43.739 --> 00:07:46.670
hand came out and it spells his name, Paul.

149
00:07:46.859 --> 00:07:49.059
So OK, he knows who he is over there.

150
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.070
He is not just a, you know, smart champ

151
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.019
chimpanzee, there's a human being over there that knows

152
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:58.390
its name, it knew his girlfriend's name. You know,

153
00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:00.649
when you say who's your girlfriend? He spells Liz

154
00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:04.070
um and on and on. And so we, we

155
00:08:04.079 --> 00:08:07.220
asked the right hemisphere what it wanted to be

156
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.500
when I grow up, what would the occupation be

157
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.630
the right hemisphere said race car driver and the

158
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.630
left hemisphere in conversation wants to be an architect.

159
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.489
So we've got one hemisphere with one goal in

160
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.209
life, another hemisphere with another goal in life and

161
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.589
they were different. So it clearly there was a,

162
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.170
a kind of conscious self on both sides of

163
00:08:30.179 --> 00:08:31.970
the brain. And that was the first time that,

164
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.200
that, that had ever been fully demonstrated, people assumed

165
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.659
there was someone awake and alive in the the

166
00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.330
right hemisphere, but you could never have a conversation

167
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.390
with that person. So that was a real breakthrough.

168
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.039
And then, but the, the key experiments we did

169
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.150
uh in terms of both my career going forward

170
00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:53.979
and Mike's was we put a um two pictures,

171
00:08:53.989 --> 00:08:55.609
one on the left side of the screen, one

172
00:08:55.619 --> 00:08:59.099
on the right side of the screen, the right

173
00:08:59.109 --> 00:09:01.580
side of the screen goes to the left hemisphere

174
00:09:03.349 --> 00:09:06.299
there. We, we saw, we put a chicken claw,

175
00:09:06.869 --> 00:09:09.000
you know, just the the claw of the chicken

176
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:14.039
picture. Yeah. In the left to the left visual

177
00:09:14.049 --> 00:09:19.520
field, we, we put a uh um the snow

178
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.210
scene. OK. So the left hemisphere saw a chicken

179
00:09:23.219 --> 00:09:28.070
claw, the right hemisphere saw a snow scene. So

180
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.390
the right hand because it's a, a snow scene

181
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.580
pointed to a shovel and the left hand because

182
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.510
it's a chicken claw pointed to a chicken. So

183
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.250
we knew why he did that. But so when

184
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.659
we asked the left hemisphere, why did you pick

185
00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:44.559
those? He said, well, I saw a chicken claws

186
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.109
so pointed to a chicken and you need to

187
00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:50.299
shovel to clean out the chicken shed. The left

188
00:09:50.309 --> 00:09:53.090
hemisphere knew nothing about the snow scene. It made

189
00:09:53.099 --> 00:09:56.049
up a story, observing the two hands and what

190
00:09:56.059 --> 00:09:58.450
they were pointing to one was controlled by the

191
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.590
the left hemisphere So, you know, at first we

192
00:10:01.599 --> 00:10:03.909
kind of thought, well, this is just normal kind

193
00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:07.169
of neurological confabulation to make up for a deficit

194
00:10:07.179 --> 00:10:10.799
that you have because often neurological patients do uh

195
00:10:10.979 --> 00:10:14.049
confabulate. But then, you know, the more we thought

196
00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:16.479
about it, this was just something that we all

197
00:10:16.489 --> 00:10:20.469
do all the time that we, a lot of

198
00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:24.200
our behavior is produced non consciously, like, you know,

199
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.119
I just ro rock back in the chair. I

200
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.119
waved my hand um or you're driving down the

201
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.320
road and you're not not paying attention, but you're

202
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.320
driving fine, you know, all kinds of things we

203
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.349
do are done non consciously. We're talking non consciously,

204
00:10:37.359 --> 00:10:40.190
you and I are not planning each sentence, we

205
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.150
say it just comes out. Um And so if

206
00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:45.510
we have all these nonconscious systems in our brain

207
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.960
producing behaviors, uh it helps if we can kind

208
00:10:50.969 --> 00:10:54.450
of put it all together and, and make our

209
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.500
non conscious behavior, make sense with our sense of

210
00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.659
who we are in, in a, a more cognitive

211
00:11:01.669 --> 00:11:05.059
sense of who we are. And so the idea

212
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.140
we had was that it's, you know, if you

213
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.549
have any sense of free will, I, I think

214
00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:14.900
we have some free will. Yeah. Um Then it's,

215
00:11:14.909 --> 00:11:19.179
it's disturbing, it causes cognitive dissonance. If you think

216
00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:22.979
that you are not in charge of your behavior,

217
00:11:23.359 --> 00:11:25.739
right? If we, if you're doing things that aren't

218
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.780
in your control, it can, can be a source

219
00:11:27.789 --> 00:11:30.469
of cognitive distance. So our idea was that the

220
00:11:30.479 --> 00:11:34.609
human brain evolved a kind of mechanism to resolve

221
00:11:34.619 --> 00:11:38.140
this dissonance in the fact that consciousness on our

222
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.880
conscious minds don't have conscious access to a lot

223
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.789
of the behavior we do. But to make everything

224
00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:47.789
seem right most of the time and not have

225
00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:49.719
to be kind of always questioning. Did I do

226
00:11:49.729 --> 00:11:51.900
that? Did I not do that? We have this

227
00:11:51.909 --> 00:11:56.090
sense of being able to cognitively interpret our behavior

228
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.710
and our thoughts and, and, and other things and

229
00:11:58.719 --> 00:12:00.750
make sense of them in light of who we

230
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.549
think we are. In other words, we generate narrations

231
00:12:03.609 --> 00:12:07.950
to explain who we are. And so ever since

232
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.250
that, that evening in uh Bennington Vermont, which is

233
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.510
where the patient lived. And we were talking about

234
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.809
this at the bar. I've been kind of obsessed

235
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.869
with that idea and so has Mike and we

236
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.659
both have written books about all this and um

237
00:12:23.619 --> 00:12:25.599
I went on to, you know, I, I was

238
00:12:25.609 --> 00:12:28.969
interested in emotion and we decided emotions might be

239
00:12:28.979 --> 00:12:31.479
one of the systems in the brain that would

240
00:12:31.489 --> 00:12:36.400
require or demand these dissonance, reducing explanations. Because if

241
00:12:36.409 --> 00:12:38.900
you see, if you have all these unconscious emotion

242
00:12:38.909 --> 00:12:41.840
systems that cause you to freeze or run or

243
00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:43.969
to do things you don't want to do or

244
00:12:43.979 --> 00:12:48.609
you didn't or don't necessarily plan doing um to,

245
00:12:48.619 --> 00:12:51.890
to resolve that dissonance, we tell a story. Uh

246
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.200
And that story is an emotional story about who

247
00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.900
we are and why we did what we do.

248
00:12:56.359 --> 00:13:00.909
So, uh you know, I, I didn't have patience

249
00:13:00.919 --> 00:13:04.979
anymore to uh to study. Um So I had

250
00:13:04.989 --> 00:13:06.710
to find something else to do and I turned

251
00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:09.349
to studies of rats because I assumed we could

252
00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:13.260
find that we could study emotional behaviors in rats.

253
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.640
And the same systems would be involved in these

254
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.929
unconscious emotional behaviors in humans. Even though I couldn't

255
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.969
study emotional consciousness in humans, I could study the

256
00:13:21.979 --> 00:13:26.059
behaviors that might be generating these dissonance inducing uh

257
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.080
uh uh uh narrations in us. So that was

258
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.150
the basic idea. And I went on for, you

259
00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:37.260
know, my first grant on emotion and rats was

260
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:42.309
rejected because the uh study section said neuroscientists don't

261
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.859
study emotions. Um It was, you know, still the

262
00:13:45.869 --> 00:13:50.239
behaviorist era in a sense. And then the um

263
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.869
the next comment was, and besides you're doing Pavlovian

264
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.250
conditioning and you didn't use a non associative control

265
00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.489
group. So I was, I was really mad, you

266
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.919
know, to get those comments, but I saw the

267
00:14:02.929 --> 00:14:05.989
writing on the wall that behaviorism still was a

268
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.349
very strong force in psychology, especially especially in the

269
00:14:09.359 --> 00:14:11.830
study of animal behavior. And it still is today,

270
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.109
by the way, it, it has not gone away.

271
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.469
Um So if I was gonna survive by studying

272
00:14:17.479 --> 00:14:20.159
Pavlovian conditioning, which is what I was doing, I

273
00:14:20.169 --> 00:14:22.960
had to add that control group, but I also

274
00:14:22.969 --> 00:14:25.440
had to disguise myself as a learning and memory

275
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.650
researcher in order to get my grants and to

276
00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:31.950
stay funded uh because emotion was not something that

277
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.940
was gonna fly. That at that time, this is

278
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:39.130
the mid 19 eighties. So I started going to

279
00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.650
learning and memory meetings and uh became, you know,

280
00:14:42.909 --> 00:14:47.280
a well known researcher studying fear conditioning and, and

281
00:14:47.289 --> 00:14:49.210
the Amygdala and all of that, I didn't go

282
00:14:49.219 --> 00:14:51.690
looking for the Amygdala. The brain took me to

283
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.130
the Amygdale. Now I had, I had uh spent

284
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.869
10 years in a neurobiology lab where there were

285
00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.280
every technique you could need to study the brain.

286
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.849
Um And so when I was studying rats, I

287
00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:07.570
wanted to know how does the tone go into

288
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.849
the rat's ear and then come out of the

289
00:15:10.859 --> 00:15:13.419
rat's body in the form of a freezing behavior

290
00:15:13.429 --> 00:15:15.679
or a change in blood pressure and heart rate

291
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.549
that's metabolically supporting that freezing behavior. So it was

292
00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:21.140
a question of how you get from the input

293
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.950
to the output. Now, in the Alesia, Eric Kandel

294
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.010
and, and others uh made very quick work of

295
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.099
that because they had a simple stimulus. They were

296
00:15:31.109 --> 00:15:34.929
using like Pavlovian conditioning too and a very rigid

297
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.500
response, the gill withdrawal reflects of the Alesia. And

298
00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.619
you know, I was using Pavlovian conditioning. I had

299
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.049
a simple stimulus, a tone paired with a shock

300
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.400
and a simple behavior, freezing behavior. It was an

301
00:15:46.409 --> 00:15:48.809
innate behavior. So I said I can connect the

302
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.929
dots in the brain too. So what I, I

303
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.090
didn't start at the ear because you lesion the

304
00:15:54.099 --> 00:15:56.700
ear, then you're not gonna hear anything, start at

305
00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:00.440
the auditory cortex. But because the auditory cortex and

306
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.359
the rat had never been formally mapped, uh we

307
00:16:03.369 --> 00:16:05.270
had to map it because I had all those

308
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.789
new anatomical techniques. I'd learned as a postdoc, we

309
00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:11.919
were able to quickly map the auditory cortex with

310
00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:15.179
tracing studies that showed us where we had to

311
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.320
remove the auditory cortex to see if that was

312
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.700
involved in the conditioning. We took it out on

313
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.059
both sides of the brain and the rats could

314
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:28.239
still be conditioned. So how do you, how does

315
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.109
the stimulus go from the auditory thalamus to some

316
00:16:32.119 --> 00:16:34.299
part of the brain that controls the behavior if

317
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:36.890
it's not going through the auditory cortex? What we

318
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.109
looked at our tracing studies, anatomical studies and there

319
00:16:40.119 --> 00:16:43.609
were connections from the medial geniculate nucleus, not just

320
00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:47.150
to the cortex, but also to the uh um

321
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.299
hypothalamus, the co cate putamen, the uh uh some

322
00:16:52.309 --> 00:16:56.989
intralaminar thalamic nuclei and the Amygdala. So we leach

323
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.119
lesion each one of those and only the Amygdala

324
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.059
had an effect. So now we know the stimulus

325
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.890
has to go to the Amygdala to do the

326
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.699
trick, get the behavior up. OK. So we said,

327
00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:11.050
well, it's not the whole Amygdala because the tracer

328
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.300
was only in one part, the lateral amygdala coming

329
00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:17.618
from the, thus you, so the auditory thalamic input

330
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.689
to the Amygdala was to the lateral nucleus. So

331
00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:23.780
we, yeah, OK. That made sense. So a lot

332
00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.750
of sensory information is coming in there. And so

333
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.239
we started focusing on that. We showed that you

334
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:33.910
could induce um uh I I if you record

335
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.020
it from cells there. Well, first we lesion the

336
00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.050
lateral amygdala in that block conditioning. Uh If we

337
00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.599
put electrodes in there, we could record the activity

338
00:17:41.609 --> 00:17:45.699
of the cells during conditioning. If we electrically stimulated

339
00:17:45.709 --> 00:17:48.790
the inputs from the thalamus to the lateral amygdala,

340
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.609
we could induce LTP in the lateral amygdala. Um

341
00:17:52.619 --> 00:17:54.579
And so on. So we had a, a lot

342
00:17:54.589 --> 00:17:56.729
of evidence that the lateral amygdala was kind of

343
00:17:56.739 --> 00:18:01.489
the learning center for fear conditioning. And so the

344
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.209
question then is how does it go from the

345
00:18:03.219 --> 00:18:07.469
lateral amygdala down to the body? Well, another researcher,

346
00:18:07.479 --> 00:18:10.640
Bruce Cap had implicated the central nucleus of the

347
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.880
amygdala in the control of certain cardiovascular responses following

348
00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:19.160
Pavlovian conditioning. So we've uh tracing studies found connections

349
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.400
from the lateral to the central amygdala and that,

350
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.260
you know, that kind of closed the circle right

351
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.089
there. Uh But for the freezing behavior, we have

352
00:18:27.099 --> 00:18:30.109
to find a different output because the uh the

353
00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:33.410
cardiovascular responses were going down to the brain stem

354
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.140
to control the parasympathetic nervous system. Uh But what

355
00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.599
we found was that for the freezing behavior, it

356
00:18:39.609 --> 00:18:42.390
had to go from the central amygdala to the

357
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.569
periaqueductal great and from there, down to the motor

358
00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:49.160
systems that control. So within, you know, very small

359
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.439
number of years, we were able to, to go

360
00:18:51.449 --> 00:18:54.380
from the ear to the muscles, basically that control

361
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:58.319
the responses. And the trick was following the, the

362
00:18:58.329 --> 00:19:01.280
invertebrate model where you have a simple stimulus and

363
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:05.489
a, a very well established, you know, hardwired response

364
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.050
that is uh basically a reflex that you just

365
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.579
con connect the uh the inputs to. And uh

366
00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.910
so that was really the beginning of my, my

367
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.719
career. Um I was right around that time, I

368
00:19:18.729 --> 00:19:22.660
was moving to NYU. And the day of the

369
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.520
MO the week before I arrived, there was an

370
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.849
article written up in the New York Times. Science

371
00:19:27.859 --> 00:19:32.579
Times uh called brains design emerges as key to

372
00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:36.930
emotion. And that article was written by Dan Goldman

373
00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:41.380
who went on to make very popular the idea

374
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:46.209
of emotional intelligence. Um He was writing from the

375
00:19:46.219 --> 00:19:48.270
New York Times at the time and he'd done

376
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.530
a lot of research on my work. And what

377
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.449
he was particularly fascinated with was the subcortical input

378
00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:58.780
to the Amygdala that control behavior without it going

379
00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.239
through the cortex. I call that the low road,

380
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.339
whereas the cortical route to the Amygdala of the

381
00:20:04.349 --> 00:20:07.109
high road. Um But we didn't need the high

382
00:20:07.119 --> 00:20:09.339
road. All you needed was the low road. And

383
00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:12.219
so the idea was that you could have the,

384
00:20:12.229 --> 00:20:17.170
the driving of emotional behavior by the thalamic to

385
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.260
Amygdala pathway uh which would be producing the behavior

386
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.859
unconsciously getting back to my whole idea of these

387
00:20:23.869 --> 00:20:27.780
unconscious behaviors. So you could control the behavior unconsciously,

388
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.119
the Freudians went wild. Finally, there was some evidence

389
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.290
for unconscious control of emotional behavior. Um Goldman's f

390
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.959
uh uh book on the emotional intelligence, I think

391
00:20:38.969 --> 00:20:41.420
the first like several chapters were all about my

392
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.410
work. So it was uh it was good for

393
00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.930
me and it was good for him. So we

394
00:20:45.939 --> 00:20:47.750
both kind of got something out of that. It

395
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.859
really gave me kind of a public presence of

396
00:20:50.869 --> 00:20:52.800
year or two. After that, I wrote the emotional

397
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:56.390
brain because I had some, you know, cache with

398
00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.239
the public at that point because my name was

399
00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.869
getting out. So in the emotional brain, I described

400
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.680
all the Pavlovian conditioning work. Uh BUT also wrote

401
00:21:04.689 --> 00:21:08.500
about how consciousness of emotions comes about, which is

402
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.339
through the high road going to the prefrontal cortex

403
00:21:11.349 --> 00:21:14.790
allowing you to cognitively interpret the situation that you're

404
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.079
in. So from the beginning, I talked about emotional

405
00:21:18.089 --> 00:21:24.640
behaviors as being unconscious. But the emotional experience being

406
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:29.660
conscious through separate pathways. I tried calling the uh

407
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:35.260
the unconscious pathway, implicit fear and high road explicit

408
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.380
fear. But that didn't take off in uh emotion

409
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:41.670
the way it did in memory research because still

410
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.150
a lot of the people doing the behavioral work

411
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.439
were behaviorist and they didn't believe in consciousness. So

412
00:21:48.449 --> 00:21:50.510
they didn't need to talk about unconscious because you

413
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.760
don't have any consciousness. There's no unconscious to contrast

414
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.920
it with. So they just ignored the implicit, explicit

415
00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:02.239
and just talked about fear as behavior. And so

416
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:07.859
for decades, this was like an imperceptible itch that

417
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.390
I needed to scratch. I would be introduced at

418
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.579
lectures as someone who discovered how fear comes out

419
00:22:13.589 --> 00:22:16.199
of the Amygdala. And I would say it's not

420
00:22:16.209 --> 00:22:18.469
quite right. You know, because I'm talking about the

421
00:22:18.479 --> 00:22:22.930
fear behavior. I'm not studying the fear and emotion

422
00:22:22.939 --> 00:22:25.660
experience in the rap that has to be done

423
00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:29.520
in humans. Uh But time after time, I would

424
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:33.689
be introduced the same way because, you know, it's

425
00:22:33.699 --> 00:22:37.890
very useful sometimes for your science to be distributed

426
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.920
to the public. But uh sometimes that the public's

427
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:46.790
perception of the science comes back into the science

428
00:22:47.079 --> 00:22:51.000
and becomes what the scientists think, right? And so

429
00:22:51.439 --> 00:22:56.540
there was, there was um my colleagues, uh the

430
00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.459
behaviorist colleagues who didn't like the fact that um

431
00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:03.800
uh you know, I was talking about emotion and,

432
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.239
and consciousness and so forth, um would think of

433
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:12.640
fear in the behavior sense as a stimulus response

434
00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:18.750
relationship. So fear was not and a, a mental

435
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.859
state in the Amygdala or anywhere else, it was

436
00:23:22.869 --> 00:23:26.780
the functional relationship between an outside stimulus and a

437
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.920
response to that stimulus. Now, in the middle of

438
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:36.359
the 20th century, some behaviors became physiologists. So the

439
00:23:36.369 --> 00:23:40.650
intervening variable, it was introduced by Tolman in the

440
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:45.250
1919 twenties. Um So for these physiologists in the

441
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.000
early in the middle of the 20th century. Uh

442
00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.750
WHAT the Amygdala was doing for fear was providing

443
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.390
a physiological state of fear that connects stimulus and

444
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.489
response. Not a subjective, no, no, no conscious fear.

445
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.760
Just a something they called the physiology of fear

446
00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.819
just as the behaviors talked about the circuit as,

447
00:24:06.829 --> 00:24:11.510
as fear. So uh you have that uh going

448
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:18.489
on and the um pretty soon again, everybody is

449
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.660
still talking about fear. So the, the question you

450
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:24.079
wonder is why did the behaviorist get rid of

451
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:30.390
conscious fear? But still call the behavior fear because

452
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.910
for most people fear would be the subjective experience.

453
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.520
And it's because they didn't believe that there was

454
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.550
anything in the head, right? So they could just

455
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.479
call it fear. And since there was just no

456
00:24:41.489 --> 00:24:43.939
conscious or unconscious with them, it was just fear.

457
00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:49.270
Um So by 2012, I was really annoyed um

458
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.810
with all of this, I thought bad language. And

459
00:24:52.819 --> 00:24:56.160
so I started writing articles like, um rethinking the

460
00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:59.020
emotional brain where I said it's what the Amygdala

461
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:03.040
does is detects in response to threats. That's an

462
00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.739
ancient evolutionary process that goes all the way back

463
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:09.060
to the beginning of animal life and into in

464
00:25:09.069 --> 00:25:12.770
the, in the uh 2019 book, The Deep History

465
00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.760
of Ourselves. I said it goes all the way

466
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.739
back to the first bacterial cell. You have to

467
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:19.380
be able to detect and respond to danger. You

468
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:22.390
have to have something on your membrane that prevents

469
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.180
you from swimming into toxic water. And something on

470
00:25:26.189 --> 00:25:29.130
your membrane that allows you to swim towards uh

471
00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.229
food. So the their membrane was able to guide

472
00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:35.680
them towards survival behaviors like this. And I'm not

473
00:25:35.689 --> 00:25:38.959
saying that we inherited, you know, for example, freezing

474
00:25:38.969 --> 00:25:42.420
behavior from bacteria. But instead what, what I said

475
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:46.979
in the book was that the earliest cells develop

476
00:25:46.989 --> 00:25:49.640
what it, what was necessary for the cell to

477
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.369
stay alive. Those became the key components of a

478
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.989
cell of cellular life. So what was passed on

479
00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.050
was the survival needs of the cell, not how

480
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:08.979
you satisfy those survival needs, right? So, bacteria survive

481
00:26:08.989 --> 00:26:12.900
by approaching food in one way and avoiding danger

482
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.430
in another way, but they do it. They have

483
00:26:15.439 --> 00:26:18.829
no, you know, their bodies are very primitive when

484
00:26:18.839 --> 00:26:20.979
you get into animals that have different kinds of

485
00:26:20.989 --> 00:26:26.329
bodies, for example, um a sponge, the body of

486
00:26:26.339 --> 00:26:28.219
the sponge is very different from the body of

487
00:26:28.229 --> 00:26:32.469
a jellyfish which vold sponges. But so they acquire

488
00:26:32.479 --> 00:26:37.329
food and protection in different ways. They, they, they

489
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.410
have to have the same survival requirements, but they

490
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.520
implement it in different ways. Take mammals, some mammals

491
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.040
run away from danger, some fly away from danger,

492
00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:50.339
some swim away from danger. Uh You have all

493
00:26:50.349 --> 00:26:53.020
kinds of ways of responding to danger. That's not

494
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:57.040
what's been inherited. What's been inherited is the imperative

495
00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:01.040
or the need to detect danger to incorporate nutrients

496
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:05.560
and balanced fluids to uh uh detect danger and

497
00:27:05.569 --> 00:27:09.449
move away from it, um, and so forth. So,

498
00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:14.760
and to reproduce. Of course. So, um I, what,

499
00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:16.599
what I was proposing in the d in the,

500
00:27:16.609 --> 00:27:21.020
this book, this article, um uh rethinking the emotion

501
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.579
of brain was to stop calling things that weren't

502
00:27:24.589 --> 00:27:28.109
mental states, mental states. You know, it's, it's simple.

503
00:27:28.119 --> 00:27:30.339
So I started with a quote in that article

504
00:27:30.349 --> 00:27:33.869
from, uh Tinbergen who was very well respected. But

505
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:40.579
he said that our, that our Presumptions about what

506
00:27:40.589 --> 00:27:44.160
hunger and fear and uh uh all of these

507
00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:48.739
emotions are in other animals are mere guesses. We

508
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.709
have no idea what's going on. We should, we

509
00:27:50.719 --> 00:27:53.040
should talk about them in different ways. He was,

510
00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:58.319
you know, basically saying let's not anthropomorphize on the

511
00:27:58.329 --> 00:28:00.579
basis of behavior because we don't know what's going

512
00:28:00.589 --> 00:28:03.219
on in the hip. So I wrote that I

513
00:28:03.229 --> 00:28:07.260
wrote all kinds of other articles like uh one

514
00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:11.449
was called um Semantics Surplus Meaning and the science

515
00:28:11.459 --> 00:28:14.910
of fear. It's about how throughout history, there have

516
00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.819
been uh scientists who have questioned the way the

517
00:28:19.829 --> 00:28:22.800
scientific language is used and that I think that's

518
00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:27.880
very important that we not mistreat our language or

519
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:31.739
misuse our language. For example, each, each field is

520
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:35.209
different. So in biology, there's a gene called hedgehog.

521
00:28:36.319 --> 00:28:40.609
So when a biologist talks about hedgehog, n, no

522
00:28:40.619 --> 00:28:44.079
one thinks they're talking about a hedgehog, right? It's

523
00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:47.869
just a nickname in psychology and neuroscience. We have

524
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.949
a different relationship to these words, when we use

525
00:28:50.959 --> 00:28:54.079
a mental state word, like fear to talk about

526
00:28:54.089 --> 00:28:58.000
a brain circuit that controls an innate behavior. That's

527
00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:02.260
not fear. That's a defensive response. If we call

528
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.020
it fear, everybody thinks fear is living in the

529
00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.949
Amygdala. And that's how we got to all these

530
00:29:07.959 --> 00:29:12.540
problems. And that's why the entire medical, medical industry

531
00:29:12.609 --> 00:29:17.130
to treat psychiatric disorders doesn't really work because you

532
00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:21.140
develop animal models and you use, you test drugs

533
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.089
that make them freeze less and you think because

534
00:29:24.099 --> 00:29:26.540
the rat froze less a human will feel less

535
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:29.979
fearful and less anxious. But instead, what you find

536
00:29:29.989 --> 00:29:33.560
is the patient is less avoidant. They, they go

537
00:29:33.569 --> 00:29:35.750
to the party a little easier and they're less

538
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.900
aroused so they can stay in the party a

539
00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:41.439
little easier, but they're still anxious and fearful, you

540
00:29:41.449 --> 00:29:43.160
know. But if so, if the drugs were sold,

541
00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:47.569
not as anti anxiety pills, but as coping pills,

542
00:29:47.579 --> 00:29:50.479
you know, anxiety coping pills, you'd be able to

543
00:29:50.489 --> 00:29:53.199
take the drug and understand that what you can

544
00:29:53.209 --> 00:29:55.640
do is use it to help you cope with

545
00:29:55.650 --> 00:30:00.579
the physical symptoms. And then psychologically you'd be in

546
00:30:00.589 --> 00:30:03.560
a better position to re evaluate your situation. So

547
00:30:03.569 --> 00:30:05.500
I talk about it some time in terms of

548
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:07.569
first, you have to tame the Amygdala. This is

549
00:30:07.579 --> 00:30:11.630
metaphorically not, not clear away. Sure change the Amygdala

550
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.089
because spider phobics don't wanna see spider pho pho

551
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.560
uh see spiders when they're doing. Uh LIKE cognitive

552
00:30:18.569 --> 00:30:21.000
behavioral therapy. So one way you might do that

553
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.410
is subliminal presentation of spiders to spider phobics. They

554
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.780
would never consciously know they're there, but it might

555
00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:30.099
extinguish the Amygdala. I don't know which I've promoted

556
00:30:30.109 --> 00:30:31.339
that for a while, but I don't know anyone

557
00:30:31.349 --> 00:30:35.579
who's done it. So, um, tame the Amygdala, you

558
00:30:35.589 --> 00:30:38.170
might do that with cognitive behavioral therapy or uh

559
00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.890
distraction. If you can keep the conscious mind distracted

560
00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.569
while still being extinguished, you know, that might work.

561
00:30:45.209 --> 00:30:48.719
Um Second, you want to tame the hippocampus, rewrite

562
00:30:48.729 --> 00:30:51.119
some of those memories about who you think you

563
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:53.719
are and what your labels are and, and so

564
00:30:53.729 --> 00:30:57.969
forth and just re narrate your, your score if

565
00:30:57.979 --> 00:30:59.449
you, you know, because a lot of what we

566
00:30:59.459 --> 00:31:02.089
do to that gets us in trouble psychologically is

567
00:31:02.099 --> 00:31:05.449
our narrations about the situation and who we are.

568
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.010
And if we can narrate in, maybe we can

569
00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.729
narrate it out. And then third, once you've done

570
00:31:10.739 --> 00:31:13.479
those two things, the brain is ready for psychotherapy,

571
00:31:14.349 --> 00:31:17.609
regular talk therapy. But if, if the therapist has

572
00:31:17.619 --> 00:31:22.239
to deal with an anxious body and um uh

573
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.770
a bad memories and you know, and at the

574
00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.010
same time, try to do the kind of, you

575
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.250
know, mono, mono or woman or woman oh exchange,

576
00:31:32.609 --> 00:31:34.609
it's too much to be done at one time.

577
00:31:34.619 --> 00:31:37.119
Do them separately, get rid of the most basic

578
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:40.520
first or tame those first tame the cognitive memories

579
00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.959
second and then you can have a, a better

580
00:31:42.969 --> 00:31:46.099
time talking. That would be my, we haven't gotten

581
00:31:46.109 --> 00:31:49.410
very far on this all day. Right. Talking too

582
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:49.790
much.

583
00:31:50.119 --> 00:31:53.510
No. But, but, but then tell us that related

584
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.520
to this latest book, how did you get that,

585
00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:00.540
this idea of four realms of existence, the bo

586
00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:03.989
the neural, the cognitive and the conscious and how

587
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.329
do they relate to one another?

588
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:12.969
Um You know, it's like I how, it's how

589
00:32:12.979 --> 00:32:14.949
the question is, how do I start writing that

590
00:32:14.959 --> 00:32:17.329
book? And it's, this is true of every book.

591
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.060
It's just you get one idea like in deep

592
00:32:22.069 --> 00:32:24.209
history, it was like, you know, I, I made

593
00:32:24.219 --> 00:32:29.300
the connection between OK, I had been studying molecules

594
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:33.489
involved in Pavlovian conditioning that I were borrowing. I

595
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.949
was bing those molecules from Eric Kandel who studied

596
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.430
Alesia, you know, C with A MP and uh

597
00:32:40.869 --> 00:32:45.130
PK A all kinds of uh molecular tools. And

598
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.560
so, you know, we would do that and we,

599
00:32:47.569 --> 00:32:49.540
we, we could show that we could block LTP

600
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:52.140
with those and we could block uh Pavlovian conditioning

601
00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:55.699
with those. And so we were using, using the

602
00:32:55.709 --> 00:32:59.050
same molecules that were used by animals that had

603
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:03.150
a 630 million year difference between the ones we

604
00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.569
were using and the ones KD were using because

605
00:33:05.579 --> 00:33:10.640
the common ancestor of the so-called protos dome invertebrates

606
00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:14.369
and the vertebrates was 630 million years ago, a

607
00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.939
flatworm, bilateral flat worm with a little brain. So

608
00:33:17.949 --> 00:33:21.270
that became the invertebrates and the vertebrates. So it

609
00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:26.040
dawned on me one day that, you know that,

610
00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:28.920
how, how did that, how do we have the

611
00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:31.869
same molecules in these groups that are so diverged?

612
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.180
Well, one possibility is they separately evolved them. But

613
00:33:35.189 --> 00:33:38.469
the other possibility is that they inherited those from

614
00:33:38.479 --> 00:33:41.969
the common ancestor. And the common ancestor is this

615
00:33:41.979 --> 00:33:46.069
flat worm that genetic, you know, modern genetics is

616
00:33:46.079 --> 00:33:48.939
able to go into fossils and stuff and, and

617
00:33:48.949 --> 00:33:51.430
pick out things that that existed back then. And

618
00:33:51.439 --> 00:33:55.770
sure enough, some of those molecules were there and

619
00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.869
we still have living ancestors of the flat worm.

620
00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.729
For example, jellyfish, they have those molecules, not all,

621
00:34:03.739 --> 00:34:07.369
not everyone, not, but they have synaptic plasticity molecules.

622
00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.090
Now, sponges don't have a nervous system, but they

623
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:14.839
have synaptic plasticity molecules and protozoa, the single cell

624
00:34:14.849 --> 00:34:18.579
organisms from which all animals evolved also have the

625
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:22.770
the molecules, what are they doing with synaptic plasticity

626
00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.949
molecules but no nervous system? So that was the

627
00:34:25.958 --> 00:34:30.199
wrong question. The question is how did the molecules

628
00:34:30.208 --> 00:34:33.978
that the protozoa have get converted? Or uh uh

629
00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:36.780
you know, what do you call it? Uh YOU

630
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:40.780
know, borrowed to make synaptic plasticity molecules because evolution

631
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.810
doesn't make things new. It takes stuff you have

632
00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:46.899
and kind of modifies it. So, and you could

633
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:50.188
go even further back with those molecules. So and

634
00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:53.020
and it turns out that uh you know, these

635
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:58.449
protozoa uh behave, they detect danger and, and move

636
00:34:58.459 --> 00:35:02.189
away from it. Um And not only that they

637
00:35:02.199 --> 00:35:08.850
undergo Pavlovian conditioning. So, and if you go into

638
00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:13.379
bacteria, they also undergo Pavlovian conditioning and have behavior.

639
00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:17.219
So the point is that when we talk about

640
00:35:17.229 --> 00:35:21.580
these, these survival behaviors to call them emotions and

641
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:25.020
attach that emotion word to them, does them disservice?

642
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.860
They have been there very, very long in the

643
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:30.659
history of life. And we need to pay respect

644
00:35:30.669 --> 00:35:33.399
to what they are and not over attribute things

645
00:35:33.409 --> 00:35:36.320
to them. They don't make fear. Fear is the

646
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:39.780
cognitive interpretation of the situation you're in. So back

647
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:42.889
to why I started writing the four realms. So,

648
00:35:43.709 --> 00:35:48.780
um I, I was uh writing a series of

649
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:52.419
articles uh for Current Biology. The, the editor there,

650
00:35:52.429 --> 00:35:57.060
Jeff uh uh had uh you know, he, he

651
00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.110
liked the way I wrote uh one or I

652
00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.120
wrote this review for him called the Amygdala, which

653
00:36:02.129 --> 00:36:05.610
was one of their best reviewed most viewed reviews

654
00:36:05.689 --> 00:36:08.419
and uh in their history at that point. So

655
00:36:08.429 --> 00:36:10.600
he asked me to write some more articles and

656
00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:12.639
these are great because all you have to do

657
00:36:12.649 --> 00:36:14.459
is write like I don't a couple of 1000

658
00:36:14.469 --> 00:36:17.570
words, there's no peer review. He, he's the peer

659
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.129
reviewer. If it passes his muster, it's kind of

660
00:36:20.139 --> 00:36:22.209
like you can say whatever you want. It's called

661
00:36:22.219 --> 00:36:24.919
my word. So it's my word. It's not anybody

662
00:36:24.929 --> 00:36:27.209
else's word and it just like allows you to

663
00:36:27.219 --> 00:36:30.060
explore some ideas and one of the ideas I

664
00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.959
explored in one of the articles was the um

665
00:36:33.629 --> 00:36:38.389
uh the starting point was um you know, what

666
00:36:38.399 --> 00:36:43.790
is, what is consciousness and, and um uh how,

667
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.679
why do we have all this extra philosophical stuff

668
00:36:47.689 --> 00:36:50.260
associated with it? And, you know, maybe we need,

669
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:55.379
maybe we could get more uh focus. And one

670
00:36:55.389 --> 00:36:57.000
of the, one of the things that came out

671
00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:00.139
of it was to explore the idea of, of

672
00:37:00.149 --> 00:37:04.780
uh narrations as a way of um the of

673
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:08.969
uh kind of populating our conscious experiences. And so

674
00:37:08.979 --> 00:37:16.739
I started thinking about that and um then I

675
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.629
should, you know, I don't, I can't remember the

676
00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:24.000
exact sequence. But ultimately, I, I started if I

677
00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.060
have this, if I'm saying, OK, I've got all

678
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:29.169
this stuff that's going back in evolution that is

679
00:37:29.179 --> 00:37:32.899
kind of layered into the human body and brain,

680
00:37:32.909 --> 00:37:38.189
right? Um What I've, the deep history of ourselves

681
00:37:38.199 --> 00:37:41.479
I said was about the way we were, but

682
00:37:41.489 --> 00:37:44.030
the four realms of existence is about the way

683
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.719
we are. It's about the same things that it's

684
00:37:47.729 --> 00:37:49.750
kind of like looking back in evolution. So we've

685
00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:55.639
got, you know, an evolutionarily programmed body that we've

686
00:37:55.649 --> 00:37:59.370
borrowed from our ancestors that didn't, that only had

687
00:37:59.379 --> 00:38:03.679
bodies. So, you know, some animals um uh only

688
00:38:03.689 --> 00:38:08.770
animals that have uh let's say, I wouldn't say

689
00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:17.189
this, some organisms only exist biologically, all single cell

690
00:38:17.199 --> 00:38:23.250
organisms only exist biologically. Um EVEN in the multicellular

691
00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:27.729
organisms plants and fungi only exist biologically. They don't

692
00:38:27.739 --> 00:38:30.399
have a nervous system. So only animals have a

693
00:38:30.409 --> 00:38:35.580
nervous system. So only animals can exist neuro biologically.

694
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:38.810
And that offers a lot of advantages, right? Because

695
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:42.889
neurobiological existence allows you to control your body in

696
00:38:42.899 --> 00:38:47.729
unique ways for, you know, obtaining food, avoiding danger,

697
00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.219
uh getting your, your liquids and so forth. Uh

698
00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:55.500
YOU can do that much more effectively, but it's,

699
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.159
it's a much more challenging job and you need

700
00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:01.110
a lot more metabolism than you have as just

701
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.189
a pure biological organism. So, if we think of

702
00:39:04.199 --> 00:39:12.590
like the biological organism unit is a system for

703
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:17.469
metabolism that's keeping you alive, generating metabolism, right? And

704
00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:24.489
the first animals were basically an extension of the

705
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:28.639
biological realm because they developed nervous systems that allowed

706
00:39:28.649 --> 00:39:33.330
the biological realm to do its metabol met meta

707
00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:37.969
meta metabolism. How do you say how they could

708
00:39:37.979 --> 00:39:41.959
like approach metabolism more effectively with a nervous system

709
00:39:41.969 --> 00:39:47.840
than without? So, the uh there's a guy named

710
00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:52.050
Alfred Sherwood Romer, he was a very uh prominent

711
00:39:52.100 --> 00:40:02.300
comparative uh uh paleontologist. Um I had read all,

712
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.020
you know, when I was first starting neuroscience, I've

713
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.139
read a lot of books about that have talked

714
00:40:06.149 --> 00:40:12.969
about um an anim animated and visceral existence in

715
00:40:12.979 --> 00:40:14.679
the body. You know, you got, so you got

716
00:40:14.909 --> 00:40:19.030
the somatic body and the visceral body. Well, Romer

717
00:40:19.239 --> 00:40:23.639
picked up on that in the 19 fifties and

718
00:40:23.649 --> 00:40:28.010
said that we've partitioned the nervous system in the

719
00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:31.669
wrong way. It's not about a central and peripheral

720
00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:36.560
nervous system because central peri and peripheral nervous systems

721
00:40:36.899 --> 00:40:41.020
did not exist as the primary condition of the

722
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:44.389
nervous system. What existed was you in a, you

723
00:40:44.399 --> 00:40:49.020
take the basic biological needs and you divide those

724
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:56.719
into visceral and somatic functions. Then the internal and

725
00:40:56.729 --> 00:41:03.770
the external. Um THE central and peripheral components of

726
00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.100
the nervous system were not there. In the first

727
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:10.120
animals like jellyfish, they had diffuse nervous system, nerve

728
00:41:10.139 --> 00:41:14.300
net nerve nets, they had no centralization to speak

729
00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:18.870
of. So, but they had visceral and somatic components.

730
00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:22.830
So that is the primary condition. So we should

731
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:27.169
think of the body and the nervous system as

732
00:41:27.179 --> 00:41:32.129
a continuous connection of visceral and somatic activities at

733
00:41:32.139 --> 00:41:36.629
the biological level and the neurobiological level. Um AND

734
00:41:36.639 --> 00:41:40.229
the central and peripheral location is just, you know,

735
00:41:40.239 --> 00:41:43.340
how you get the the nerves to the out

736
00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:45.889
of uh uh from one kind of nervous system

737
00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.939
to two kinds. You know, it's just AAA way

738
00:41:48.949 --> 00:41:51.479
of of dividing the nerves. But the key thing

739
00:41:51.489 --> 00:41:54.310
is the nerves are pro processing either somatic or

740
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:58.600
visceral functions. So that came, became very important. And

741
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.800
I had this, this picture uh of one of,

742
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:08.750
of um how the Amygdala uh connects to the

743
00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:15.340
autonomic nervous system to control, you know, autonomic response,

744
00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:18.169
like blood pressure and heart rate and uh release

745
00:42:18.179 --> 00:42:21.300
of hormones and all of that stuff. And on

746
00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:23.479
the other side of the picture you know, the

747
00:42:23.489 --> 00:42:26.780
Amygdala separated like the A NS component and then

748
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:30.409
the component that controls freezing behavior or uh escape

749
00:42:30.419 --> 00:42:33.489
behavior and so forth. So I had ma I

750
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:37.899
had written what Romer de described in my work,

751
00:42:37.909 --> 00:42:39.739
it, it came out of my work that there

752
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:42.939
was different pathways out of the Amygdala to control

753
00:42:42.949 --> 00:42:46.239
visceral and somatic nervous system. So his thing was

754
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:48.580
like an eye opener for me. And that became

755
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:53.360
the foundation for the biological transition to the neurobiological

756
00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:57.659
realm. And then the next transition was the transition

757
00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:02.250
from the mirror neurobiological realm where you have instincts

758
00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.159
like, you know, fixed action patterns. As the ethologist

759
00:43:05.169 --> 00:43:10.580
call them reflexes and stimulus response habits. None of

760
00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:15.510
those involve cognition, right? They're automatic responses. So the

761
00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.300
next level up is the cognitive level. So there

762
00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.899
you can have instrumental responses that are goal directed

763
00:43:21.909 --> 00:43:25.860
and involve cognition. Uh And you then can also

764
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:29.870
have internal representations of the world that you hold

765
00:43:29.879 --> 00:43:32.139
information in mind and make decisions about and so

766
00:43:32.149 --> 00:43:36.820
forth. But again, all unconsciously and then finally, out

767
00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:40.370
of a very sophisticated cognitive realm, you evolve the

768
00:43:40.379 --> 00:43:43.590
conscious realm. So that was the whole thing. It's

769
00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.330
like how one thing led to another, it was

770
00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.340
really a continuation of deep history, but just putting

771
00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.110
it into our bodies,

772
00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.689
right? But how do we get at consciousness? Then?

773
00:43:56.699 --> 00:44:01.699
II I mean, because as many times people again,

774
00:44:01.719 --> 00:44:05.620
going back to the body dualism, I think people

775
00:44:05.629 --> 00:44:09.030
think about consciousness as a sort of, I don't

776
00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:13.629
know, magical out there. But I, I mean, from

777
00:44:13.639 --> 00:44:18.260
a neurobiological and then adding the cognitive perspective, how

778
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:22.570
do we go from the cognitive level to the

779
00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:23.770
conscious level?

780
00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:26.949
So, one of the things I wrote in the,

781
00:44:26.959 --> 00:44:30.129
in uh the four realms book, and, you know,

782
00:44:30.139 --> 00:44:32.270
I've been writing a psychology today blog for a

783
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.949
long time. But, and with this book, I've written,

784
00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.070
you know, kind of summaries of each realm and

785
00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:42.500
in the conscious realm, I wrote a paper recently.

786
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:46.510
Yeah, these are like short uh you know, thought

787
00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:51.080
pieces. Um I wrote uh one called is Consciousness

788
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:55.090
Mysterious. And so I said, well, it depends on

789
00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.479
what you mean by mysterious. Do you mean mysterious

790
00:44:57.489 --> 00:44:59.929
in the way of a soul that survives death

791
00:45:00.459 --> 00:45:03.090
or in the way that DNA was mysterious before

792
00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.419
the uh the inheritance was mysterious before DNA was

793
00:45:06.429 --> 00:45:09.739
discovered. And I think that's the way I think

794
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:12.899
of consciousness more like the discovery of DNA than

795
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.469
search for the soul that survives death. You know.

796
00:45:17.459 --> 00:45:21.610
So um there, you know, and it's very hard

797
00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:25.370
to, to talk about consciousness because so many people

798
00:45:25.379 --> 00:45:28.010
talk about it as if it's one thing. But

799
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.959
I, I have long been uh following a partition

800
00:45:30.969 --> 00:45:35.409
that in El Toing proposed long ago uh between

801
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.830
auto noetic consciousness, which is self awareness, awareness of

802
00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:44.350
yourself, noetic consciousness, which is knowledge of, of facts

803
00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.229
and, and concepts and a noetic consciousness, which is

804
00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.260
let's hold that one for a second. It's complicated.

805
00:45:52.199 --> 00:45:55.050
So, but if we, if we just take auto

806
00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:59.770
noetic and noetic and um uh realize that auto

807
00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:04.510
noetic consciousness is based on episodic memory and noetic

808
00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.310
consciousness is based on noetic me, on semantic memory.

809
00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:15.550
So, the fact that episodic and semantic memory are

810
00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:20.419
the stepping stones to noetic and auto noetic consciousness

811
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.870
means that you have an anchor in the brain

812
00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:27.389
that takes you pretty close to the consciousness finishing

813
00:46:27.399 --> 00:46:32.729
line, right? It's through episodic memory and through uh

814
00:46:32.739 --> 00:46:37.340
semantic memory that you get there. So tho those

815
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:40.340
should be the anchor points from which to explore

816
00:46:40.399 --> 00:46:44.929
how consciousness can exist in other ways. And whether

817
00:46:44.939 --> 00:46:46.439
you want to talk about that in terms of

818
00:46:46.449 --> 00:46:49.979
global workspace or in terms of um a higher

819
00:46:49.989 --> 00:46:53.719
order theory which I prefer um you have an

820
00:46:53.729 --> 00:46:57.169
anchor point to build on. So I, I think

821
00:46:57.179 --> 00:47:00.889
it's an underappreciated uh uh kind of tool that,

822
00:47:00.899 --> 00:47:06.489
that we have. Um THE the the third kind

823
00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.719
of consciousness is a little weirder. So the third

824
00:47:08.729 --> 00:47:12.659
kind of consciousness is a noetic and that is

825
00:47:12.669 --> 00:47:16.260
a kind of very strange thing that tolling didn't

826
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:18.729
explain very well. And I, I struggled for many

827
00:47:18.739 --> 00:47:21.060
years. And you know, I had a, I was

828
00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:23.600
very yak pens up and I had very different

829
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:27.229
ideas about emotion. But we both used tol scheme

830
00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:29.870
and the only thing that was different and, and

831
00:47:29.879 --> 00:47:32.449
solving scheme showed me what was different about what

832
00:47:32.639 --> 00:47:34.979
Yak. And I believe the only thing that was

833
00:47:34.989 --> 00:47:39.810
different is whether the Amygdala was the source of

834
00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:45.409
fear, actual fear or whether it was a lower

835
00:47:45.419 --> 00:47:49.270
order state that had to be resented for the

836
00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.580
fear to be experienced. That was my position, the

837
00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:55.570
latter one and the lower the, the, uh, it's

838
00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:58.459
all in the Amygdala State was this, I mean,

839
00:47:58.469 --> 00:48:01.010
it wasn't just Amy Amygdala Perre doctor, right and

840
00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:04.709
so forth. But what many people don't realize that

841
00:48:04.889 --> 00:48:08.479
Yak was not talking about the kind of consciousness

842
00:48:08.489 --> 00:48:11.050
we have. He was talking about the kind of

843
00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:16.030
consciousness that a rat has called a noetic consciousness,

844
00:48:16.679 --> 00:48:20.409
which is as he called in his book, uh

845
00:48:20.419 --> 00:48:24.060
you know, Affect of Neuroscience. He says it's basically

846
00:48:24.879 --> 00:48:30.209
like literally unconscious. It's, it's con it's unconscious consciousness.

847
00:48:30.449 --> 00:48:34.340
It's so primitive that you never experience it unless

848
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:37.750
it's so intense that it moves up into noetic

849
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.800
consciousness and into auto noetic consciousness. It's like, ok,

850
00:48:41.939 --> 00:48:44.729
you walk into your apartment, you don't have to

851
00:48:44.739 --> 00:48:47.979
say this is my apartment, everything, you know, you

852
00:48:47.989 --> 00:48:50.560
know, everything is yours. You don't have to acknowledge

853
00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:52.909
that. But if you walk in and all of

854
00:48:52.919 --> 00:48:55.709
a sudden, you know, the table is upturned and

855
00:48:55.719 --> 00:48:58.750
books are all over the place, all of a

856
00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.800
sudden that you've moved from everything is right, a

857
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:05.479
noetic consciousness to everything is wrong. Noetic consciousness is

858
00:49:05.489 --> 00:49:07.840
recognized that and then, you know, oh my God,

859
00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:10.469
they you know, maybe someone's here, they're gonna mug

860
00:49:10.479 --> 00:49:16.959
me you into I noetic. So um a noetic

861
00:49:16.969 --> 00:49:21.149
is very primitive. And for me, I think the

862
00:49:21.159 --> 00:49:23.879
only way to think about it is to in

863
00:49:23.889 --> 00:49:29.439
order to get it into noetic and auto noetic

864
00:49:29.449 --> 00:49:31.229
as Jacque said, you know, it's gotta, it's gotta

865
00:49:31.239 --> 00:49:33.820
be intense to cross that line. But I think

866
00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:35.989
that the, that the feeling of rightness that he

867
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:42.610
talked about is not something that is just down

868
00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:45.429
there. I think it's also something that exists at

869
00:49:45.439 --> 00:49:49.439
a higher level uh in the medial prefrontal cortex

870
00:49:49.449 --> 00:49:51.530
that all mammals share. It's a kind, I think

871
00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:54.449
it's a kind of consciousness, all mammals share. It's

872
00:49:54.459 --> 00:49:57.540
this sense that you know, everything is right until

873
00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:01.239
it's not right. And once it's not right, we

874
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:04.090
have more complicated things to bump it up to.

875
00:50:04.449 --> 00:50:07.209
Uh ANIMALS may have some kind of non verbal

876
00:50:07.229 --> 00:50:10.070
semantic memory that they could bump it up to

877
00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.770
a little bit. Uh But with verbal knowledge, you

878
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.189
get much more, you know, fancy stuff going with

879
00:50:16.199 --> 00:50:19.530
it. But anyway, the, the idea that the, the

880
00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:21.830
a noetic is the ver is the fringe of

881
00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.189
consciousness that William James talked about. It's stuff that

882
00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:28.639
hovers on the verge of consciousness but is never

883
00:50:28.649 --> 00:50:31.649
conscious or unconscious. It's right there at that, at

884
00:50:31.659 --> 00:50:34.840
that level. And so it's ready to be bumped

885
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:37.760
up or ready just to stay there. And this

886
00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:42.800
philosopher Bruce Mangan says that the this fringe consciousness,

887
00:50:42.899 --> 00:50:49.439
its job is to translate the deep unconscious into

888
00:50:49.449 --> 00:50:54.919
something that can be made available to consciousness under

889
00:50:54.929 --> 00:50:58.260
certain conditions. So this this a no conscious is

890
00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:03.010
a transition from the deepest, not un inaccessible unconscious.

891
00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.790
Only some things can get up there and be

892
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.250
pulled up through a and so

893
00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:12.949
I I mean, by distinguishing between these different kinds

894
00:51:12.959 --> 00:51:17.010
of consciousness, uh what kind of progress can we

895
00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.139
make in terms of understa of having a better

896
00:51:20.149 --> 00:51:25.379
understanding of what consciousness is or how it arises

897
00:51:25.389 --> 00:51:26.520
and stuff like that.

898
00:51:27.139 --> 00:51:29.419
So one way to do it that I propose

899
00:51:29.429 --> 00:51:31.979
and it's, you know, it's uh in current biology

900
00:51:31.989 --> 00:51:34.989
in one of these articles. Um THIS is purely

901
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:42.659
hypothetical, but let's say that if we were to

902
00:51:42.669 --> 00:51:45.629
know more about how these three kinds of consciousness

903
00:51:45.639 --> 00:51:49.260
work in the human brain and knew exactly, you

904
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:53.979
know, which circuits are involved. For example, let's say

905
00:51:54.030 --> 00:52:01.179
that the auto noetic consciousness, self consciousness um is

906
00:52:01.409 --> 00:52:07.110
requires the lateral frontal pole, which exists as a

907
00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.780
unique structure present only in the human brain. And

908
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:13.290
to the extent that many people think that the

909
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:16.669
philosopher scientists think that this kind of auto noetic

910
00:52:16.679 --> 00:52:20.070
self reflective consciousness may be on the human, that

911
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.179
might be a good candidate to look for that

912
00:52:22.189 --> 00:52:24.959
kind of consciousness in. But we're just talking about

913
00:52:24.969 --> 00:52:27.679
speculation. Now, let's say that the unique part of

914
00:52:27.689 --> 00:52:29.479
the human brain is where we have this unique

915
00:52:29.489 --> 00:52:32.719
kind of auto noetic consciousness not alone. Of course,

916
00:52:32.729 --> 00:52:36.340
you need hippocampus for episodic memories and, and all

917
00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:38.439
of that and you gotta get them through many

918
00:52:38.449 --> 00:52:41.540
steps to get them to the, the uh on

919
00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:46.280
a frontal pole. Um But we also know that

920
00:52:46.969 --> 00:52:50.360
there's some evidence in humans that uh for work

921
00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:55.439
for kinds of consciousness like semantic consciousness. Uh YOU

922
00:52:55.449 --> 00:53:01.870
know, can you see consciously see an app, do

923
00:53:01.879 --> 00:53:06.129
you need only visual cortex to consciously see the

924
00:53:06.139 --> 00:53:07.909
apple? That would be the first order theory like

925
00:53:07.919 --> 00:53:12.120
ned block or do you need prefrontal cortex in

926
00:53:12.129 --> 00:53:16.729
order to turn that into a conscious representation? Uh

927
00:53:16.739 --> 00:53:19.520
THAT would be higher order theory. Uh It would

928
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:22.590
also be the kind of theory that uh people

929
00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:26.110
like Carl Frisson talk about because he says it's

930
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.909
all a kind of top down illusion that would

931
00:53:28.919 --> 00:53:31.199
be kind of working memory illusion, you know about

932
00:53:31.209 --> 00:53:34.500
it. So uh a and global workspace says you

933
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:38.850
need at least a a cognitive representation to rebroadcast

934
00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:40.879
it back to the other areas and so forth.

935
00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:47.459
So the the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex which plays a

936
00:53:47.469 --> 00:53:51.449
key role in all that stuff um is only

937
00:53:51.459 --> 00:53:55.060
in primates. So that might be a kind of

938
00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:59.840
noetic consciousness that we have using dorsal lateral prefrontal

939
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:05.159
cortex that includes verbal noetic awareness, verbal, semantic aware,

940
00:54:05.229 --> 00:54:08.899
conceptual semantic awareness. But in monkeys who have almost

941
00:54:08.909 --> 00:54:13.300
identical dorset prefrontal cortex uh in terms of structure,

942
00:54:13.709 --> 00:54:18.370
uh that might be nonverbal semantic and conceptual knowledge.

943
00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:22.770
But other at other mammals don't have this do

944
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:27.760
lateral granular prefrontal cortex. Also the frontal pole is

945
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:32.699
granular prefrontal cortex. The rest of animals including us

946
00:54:32.709 --> 00:54:35.879
have a granular or disc granular whatever you wanna

947
00:54:35.889 --> 00:54:39.300
call it, uh prefrontal cortex that all mammals share.

948
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:44.489
So that might be the kind of cortex that

949
00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:49.969
allows these a noetic crude string of consciousness feelings

950
00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:52.780
to be shared by all mammals. And that is

951
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:55.949
exactly what JP Up said. It's the kind of

952
00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:58.449
thing that is shared by all mammals. He wouldn't

953
00:54:58.459 --> 00:55:01.030
put it in the media prefrontal cortex, he'd put

954
00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.209
it in the sub cortex, but that's the only

955
00:55:03.219 --> 00:55:07.850
difference between our views. Um So we got, we

956
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.959
got uh mammalian consciousness shared by all mammals, primate

957
00:55:10.969 --> 00:55:13.929
consciousness shared by all primates. And, you know, maybe

958
00:55:13.939 --> 00:55:16.500
human consciousness perhaps shared by great apes. We don't

959
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:18.419
know what's going on in their brains because it's

960
00:55:18.429 --> 00:55:21.659
illegal to study uh ape brains, you know. So

961
00:55:21.899 --> 00:55:23.419
I think it's a, it's a good kind of

962
00:55:23.429 --> 00:55:27.679
way to uh kind of retrofit or reverse engineer

963
00:55:27.689 --> 00:55:31.040
consciousness and other animals based on what we can

964
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:33.860
expect in our brains. So if we can kind

965
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:37.169
of like test for what, how far rats can

966
00:55:37.179 --> 00:55:41.719
go beyond this a noetic feeling, then they might

967
00:55:41.729 --> 00:55:44.830
get into kind of some semantic uh nonverbal semantic,

968
00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:49.320
ratlike, not, not primate, like but ratlike, semantic uh

969
00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:51.250
um noetic or I don't know, it's just the

970
00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:52.040
speculation.

971
00:55:52.909 --> 00:55:55.510
So let me just ask you then one final

972
00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.120
question. And you've already touched a little bit on

973
00:55:58.129 --> 00:56:02.219
this throughout the conversation. When you mentioned, for example,

974
00:56:02.229 --> 00:56:05.010
that the way we conceptualize things, the way we

975
00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:07.669
talk about things, the way we talk about the

976
00:56:07.679 --> 00:56:13.429
mind mental states, mental experiences are sometimes problematic or

977
00:56:13.439 --> 00:56:17.669
might become obstacles in the way that we understand

978
00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:21.965
these different kinds of realms of existence there, relationship

979
00:56:21.975 --> 00:56:25.864
and so on. Phenomena like consciousness, I guess in

980
00:56:25.875 --> 00:56:28.665
the book, you claim at a certain point that

981
00:56:28.675 --> 00:56:34.125
ideas like the self are increasingly barriers to discovery

982
00:56:34.135 --> 00:56:37.625
and understanding and that we've sort of hit an

983
00:56:37.635 --> 00:56:41.824
epistemological wall. So what do you mean exactly by

984
00:56:41.834 --> 00:56:46.314
that? And if we've really hit this epistemological wall,

985
00:56:46.324 --> 00:56:49.725
how can we go beyond that obstacle?

986
00:56:50.389 --> 00:56:53.610
Yeah. So, you know, again, this goes back to

987
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:57.739
the issue of what we should take from philosophy

988
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:59.649
and what we shouldn't take it. You know, so

989
00:56:59.659 --> 00:57:02.179
just because we got this, this notion of the

990
00:57:02.189 --> 00:57:06.510
self from philosophers doesn't mean that everything a philosopher

991
00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.689
says about the self is golden and you know,

992
00:57:09.699 --> 00:57:12.300
it written in stone. So the self is a

993
00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:16.250
good starting point. But even scientists have, you know,

994
00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.179
come to think of it um in ways that

995
00:57:19.189 --> 00:57:21.449
I think are not productive. So there are two

996
00:57:21.459 --> 00:57:23.560
ways to, to think of the self one productive

997
00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:26.649
and the other not productive. The unproductive one I

998
00:57:26.659 --> 00:57:30.739
think is when we reify it as a kind

999
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:34.989
of thing inside of something besides who we are.

1000
00:57:35.159 --> 00:57:38.300
That, you know it, oh, that, you know, myself,

1001
00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:41.219
did it or that I have this thing in

1002
00:57:41.229 --> 00:57:45.379
me that does things, um, but what, what is

1003
00:57:45.389 --> 00:57:47.770
the self in there besides you? Why do you

1004
00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:52.280
need something besides you? Why do you need a

1005
00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:56.149
self as a separate thing in charge? You know,

1006
00:57:56.159 --> 00:57:59.979
because you, they're related to executive function but, but

1007
00:57:59.989 --> 00:58:03.669
it's, it's just adding a, uh, a thing we

1008
00:58:03.679 --> 00:58:05.649
don't need, you have executive function. You don't need

1009
00:58:05.659 --> 00:58:08.110
a self with the victim. It's, but you have

1010
00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:10.729
executive function, not yourself. The self is like a

1011
00:58:10.739 --> 00:58:13.239
little ghost in there that's giving us a lot

1012
00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:15.669
of trouble. The one way that the self is,

1013
00:58:15.679 --> 00:58:21.510
I think scientifically valid is uh the narrative self

1014
00:58:21.929 --> 00:58:25.159
because we do narrate who we are and those

1015
00:58:25.169 --> 00:58:29.120
narrations become part of our understanding. We can narrate,

1016
00:58:29.129 --> 00:58:31.330
we can re narrate, we can change our narration.

1017
00:58:31.729 --> 00:58:35.489
But these narrations become beliefs. Sometimes the beliefs become

1018
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:39.449
so strong that that counter evidence to the contrary

1019
00:58:39.459 --> 00:58:42.070
is rejected. We see this a lot in, in

1020
00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:44.620
politics on both sides these days and a lot

1021
00:58:44.629 --> 00:58:47.389
of things, things are so firmly believed that that

1022
00:58:47.399 --> 00:58:51.899
nobody gives on anything. And um so those are,

1023
00:58:51.909 --> 00:58:54.939
those are all narratives that we cultural narratives, you

1024
00:58:54.949 --> 00:58:58.040
know, there are all kinds of narratives, narratives, family

1025
00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:04.669
narratives, personal narratives, cultural narratives. Um And we, it's

1026
00:59:04.679 --> 00:59:07.139
amazing we get along at all because we have

1027
00:59:07.149 --> 00:59:09.280
so many ideas about how, who we are and

1028
00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:11.709
who we're not. I'm trying to write a book

1029
00:59:11.719 --> 00:59:15.139
now on how, uh you know, like it's kind

1030
00:59:15.149 --> 00:59:20.270
of a memoir with about how uh I've narrated

1031
00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:23.469
my life over the course of it and what

1032
00:59:23.479 --> 00:59:25.919
I, what I think of my narration now that

1033
00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:27.080
I was narrating back then.

1034
00:59:27.949 --> 00:59:31.330
Well, I'm very much looking forward to it. And

1035
00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:34.100
uh the book is again the four realms of

1036
00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:37.419
existence, a new theory of being human. I'm leaving

1037
00:59:37.429 --> 00:59:39.129
a link to it in the description of the

1038
00:59:39.139 --> 00:59:40.530
interview. So

1039
00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:44.239
I prefer a new framework for being human. The

1040
00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:47.100
publisher insisted I say new theory. Oh,

1041
00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:47.449
ok.

1042
00:59:50.429 --> 00:59:55.330
Oh, ok. People think that's too pretentious. Very good.

1043
00:59:56.090 --> 00:59:56.239
Yeah,

1044
00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:59.419
great, great. So, Doctor Lulu, thank you so much

1045
00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:02.350
