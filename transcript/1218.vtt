00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.980
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.929
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricard Lobs, and

3
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:08.810
today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor Edward

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.229
Hagen. He's professor of evolutionary anthropology at Washington State

5
00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.090
University. And today we're going to talk about his

6
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.000
critique of Doctor Agustin Fuentes's book Sex Is a

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.209
Spectrum. I had Doctor Fuentes on the show back

8
00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:26.409
in April or May, and today we're going to

9
00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.489
talk about the critique of his book. So Doctor

10
00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.530
Hagen, welcome back to the show. It's always a

11
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.560
pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.610
Yeah, thanks. Thanks for inviting me.

13
00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:40.340
OK, so before we get into specific er aspects

14
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.380
of your critique, just to start with a general

15
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.419
question, what was your overall view of Doctor Fuentes's

16
00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:50.099
book, Sex is a Specter?

17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.750
Um, I was pretty disappointed in the book because

18
00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:01.110
it's, it's not, um, it's not unscientific, uh, but

19
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.290
it's not really scientific either. Um, IT'S pretty.

20
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.139
What, what do you mean by that

21
00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:09.059
exactly? Yeah, well, for me anyway, and I think

22
00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:15.260
for many folks, science involves providing explanations for the

23
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.419
world. Why is the world the way it is

24
00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:21.230
and not some other way. And when we read

25
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.309
a book on science, at least what I'm expecting

26
00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:27.500
and I would imagine many readers are expecting is

27
00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:30.150
some explanations. They might be the right ones, they

28
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.089
might be the wrong ones, but most of us

29
00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:34.870
kind of view that as the goal or aim

30
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.949
of science, which is to explain all of the

31
00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:41.750
diverse diversity of the natural world. And those explanations

32
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.830
were almost entirely missing from this book. There was

33
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.430
um a smorgasbord of, of examples of, of diversity

34
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.150
in the biological world, but very, very rarely any

35
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.389
explanations for that. And that really contrasts with evolutionary

36
00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:02.809
biology, which has provided a wide range of explanations.

37
00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:05.220
Um, SO, since Darwin in the last, you know,

38
00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:09.210
150 years, the The goal has been to explain

39
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.419
biological diversity, and there's been a lot of success.

40
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.490
And of course there's still much debate, uh, about

41
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.449
it. We're, we're hardly at the end of the

42
00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:22.570
road. But the fact that many explanations do exist

43
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.250
and have been tested and have quite a bit

44
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.169
of um empirical support means that in my view,

45
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.990
uh, A successful science book on biological diversity. WOULD

46
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.910
provide explanations for that diversity, including the debates, you

47
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.470
know, these folks think the explanation is A and

48
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.029
these folks think the explanation is B, but those

49
00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:44.830
were almost entirely missing from the book. So for

50
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.990
me, that was very disappointing and unsatisfying.

51
00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.369
Yes, uh, I'm, I am aware of that, I

52
00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:55.970
mean, even though people who say or claim that

53
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.089
sex is a spectrum are still, I think, a

54
00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:06.770
minority among evolutionary biologists, evolutionary anthropologists, and other evolutionary

55
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.130
theorists, uh, I know that there's an ongoing debate

56
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.949
on that topic, and I mean, but when you

57
00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:18.639
say. That he fails, Doctor Fuentes fails to provide

58
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.220
explanations for many of the examples of animals and

59
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.020
species that he describes in the book. Uh, I

60
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.979
mean, why do you think that uh that is

61
00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:34.139
a problem specifically? I mean, why are the explanations

62
00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.660
important and specifically in this context of debating sex?

63
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.759
Well, um, the reason is that sex. Provides a

64
00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:50.520
lot of those explanations. So, uh, if you're going

65
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.720
to jump into the debate, what you need to

66
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.460
do, the, the debate is going to really turn

67
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.679
on which concepts provide the best explanations. That's what

68
00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:03.139
the debate is going to turn on. And so

69
00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.300
if you jump into this debate, you need to

70
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.660
show that your concepts, your frameworks, your theories provide

71
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.179
better explanations or at least competing explanations with the

72
00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:16.410
ones that already exist. And so the failure to

73
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.369
do that is really a failure of the whole

74
00:04:18.369 --> 00:04:21.869
premise of the book, that there's a better way,

75
00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:25.290
a new framework. In fact, Fuentes promises to provide

76
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.230
us a new framework for thinking about biological diversity,

77
00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:32.649
but he doesn't. So, he is the one that

78
00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:38.089
set up uh The um expectations and then fails

79
00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:43.420
to meet them. So, yeah, so sex um is

80
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.299
one of our most powerful explanations for biological diversity,

81
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.269
one of our most successful explanations. And if you

82
00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:53.670
want to challenge the current views of that, I

83
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.489
think that's great. Please do. Science really needs critics.

84
00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:00.260
Everybody, in fact, everybody should be a critic of

85
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.989
your, of your own theories as well. Uh, BUT

86
00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:05.220
to do that, you need to provide alternatives, or

87
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.190
at least you need to show where these theories

88
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.070
fail. And he really didn't do that. So, he

89
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.859
didn't show that the, the existing theories really failed

90
00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:17.109
to explain what they purported to explain, nor did

91
00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:20.869
he provide. Any alternatives that explain the facts better

92
00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:24.269
than the existing ones, or at least our candidates

93
00:05:24.609 --> 00:05:27.429
to compete with existing explanations. So that's why it's

94
00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:27.750
important.

95
00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.839
Mhm. Yes, er, and I mean, let me just

96
00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:34.540
take a step back and then I'll go through

97
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.279
the main topics you explore in your critique. How

98
00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.000
would you characterize his main argument? I mean, when

99
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.640
he argues that instead of it being a binary,

100
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.420
that sex is a spectrum, what do you think

101
00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.720
is the argument he tries to make for that?

102
00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:56.670
Well, so his argument, which is not really his

103
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:02.260
argument, uh, but that when you look across all

104
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.920
the domains of life, um, in fact, two of

105
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.600
the three big branches of life don't have sex,

106
00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:14.380
so bacteria and archaea, um. They reproduce clonally. They

107
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.940
don't reproduce sexually. So it doesn't even apply to

108
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.339
actually the most diverse, uh, domains of, of life

109
00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:25.839
on this planet, but it does apply almost universally

110
00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:27.940
to our branch of the domain of life, the

111
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.940
eukaryotes. And What we see when we look at,

112
00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:37.140
you know, literally millions of species in the eukaryot

113
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.179
that do reproduce sexually is that there's a lot

114
00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:44.290
of diversity. And so Fuentes is absolutely correct that

115
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.709
there's no In many species, there's not even two

116
00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:51.029
sexes. There's, there doesn't, that concept doesn't even apply.

117
00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:53.190
Even if they're reproducing sexually, we might get into

118
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.190
that in a little bit more detail in a

119
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.769
bit. Um, BUT even if there are sexes, um,

120
00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:02.829
there's no single template for what it means to

121
00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:04.309
be a female or what it means to be

122
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:09.510
a male or, um. And so, Fuentes is absolutely

123
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.630
correct about that, but that's not new. Um, THAT,

124
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.390
that has been recognized since they, since evolutionary biology

125
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.470
became a discipline, and there are many, many attempts

126
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.510
to explain why there are females and males in

127
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.630
the first place, we may get into that, but

128
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.829
when there are, why females have these properties and

129
00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:32.549
males have those properties, um, this is not new.

130
00:07:32.709 --> 00:07:36.429
So, so Fuentes is not. Um, HE is correct

131
00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:42.970
in, in explaining that, um, that particular empirical fact,

132
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.609
um, but then he doesn't really go any further.

133
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.149
And so, that's, that's the disappointing aspect of it.

134
00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:51.540
It's not that he's gets anything really horribly wrong,

135
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.390
but he doesn't advance the debate in any meaningful

136
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.709
way.

137
00:07:56.119 --> 00:08:00.399
OK, so let's go through some basics here because

138
00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:03.839
I also want for people to understand uh the

139
00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:07.859
kind of critique you do in your, uh, post,

140
00:08:08.239 --> 00:08:11.290
um, and also for people to, who don't. Who

141
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.410
are not aware of this to get a little

142
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.649
bit of the biological or the basics in biology

143
00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:22.429
here. So where does sex come from? How and

144
00:08:22.429 --> 00:08:24.160
why has it evolved?

145
00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:26.970
Yeah, so this would be, uh, and, and, you

146
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.329
know, this is going to be probably the longest

147
00:08:28.329 --> 00:08:30.850
answer of our interview here because this is an

148
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.808
extraordinarily complex topic, and I want to say from

149
00:08:33.808 --> 00:08:36.929
the outset, uh, my This is not my area

150
00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:40.909
of expertise. I am an evolutionary anthropologist. I study

151
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.950
human behavior and the evolution of human behavior and

152
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:47.270
human cognition, and I draw on some of the

153
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.190
results of these theories for the evolution of sex

154
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.979
and the evolution of the two sexes. Those are

155
00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:55.729
different. Um, SO, I, I want to say right

156
00:08:55.729 --> 00:08:57.369
from the outset that I'm, I'm not an expert

157
00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:00.169
in this area, but I'll, I'll give a, hopefully,

158
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.450
uh, uh, a reasonable explanation here. And it goes,

159
00:09:04.609 --> 00:09:07.450
we have to really travel back in time quite

160
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.770
a ways to begin to understand what's going on

161
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.880
here. Um. And we should really go all the

162
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.049
way back to the formation of the Earth, which

163
00:09:16.049 --> 00:09:18.969
is maybe about 4.5 billion years ago. That's our

164
00:09:18.969 --> 00:09:22.729
time frame. It's this enormous expanse of time that

165
00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:26.229
we need to consider. And sometime after the formation

166
00:09:26.229 --> 00:09:29.030
of the Earth, life arises on the planet. We're

167
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.619
not sure exactly when, but maybe, maybe even as

168
00:09:32.619 --> 00:09:34.559
early as 4 billion years ago or even a

169
00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:40.409
little bit earlier than that. Um. And at some

170
00:09:40.409 --> 00:09:45.010
point, we have what's this fictional or theoretical concept

171
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:49.080
called the last universal common ancestor, or Lucca. Um,

172
00:09:49.859 --> 00:09:52.340
And that arises, and that, and we, we can

173
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.380
be pretty sure that there is this last universal

174
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.219
common ancestor because all life on Earth is using

175
00:09:57.219 --> 00:10:03.119
the same DNA code and the same nucleotides essentially,

176
00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:06.340
and proteins. So the similarities of all living things

177
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.320
suggest that we all derive from this one single

178
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:15.890
ancestral conceptual species, Luca. Um, AND then sometime after

179
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.789
that, here's the, um, Luca divides into two big

180
00:10:19.789 --> 00:10:23.710
branches, um, of life, the bacteria, these are single-celled

181
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.109
organisms, and a very similar group of organisms called

182
00:10:27.109 --> 00:10:32.109
the archaea. And, um, these reproduce clonally. They basically

183
00:10:32.109 --> 00:10:36.229
copy their DNA into their daughter cells, basically clonal

184
00:10:36.229 --> 00:10:42.059
division. And they do not um reproduce sexually, so

185
00:10:42.059 --> 00:10:45.570
they do not combine the genomes of two parents

186
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.289
into the genomes of offsprings. There is something called

187
00:10:48.289 --> 00:10:51.260
horizontal gene transfer, we won't get into that, but

188
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.520
there's pretty widespread agreement that these groups don't reproduce

189
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.739
sexually. Now, sometime after this, uh, what we think

190
00:10:59.739 --> 00:11:01.940
happened, um, and this is going to happen in

191
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.809
the time period, probably between 1 billion and 2

192
00:11:04.809 --> 00:11:10.570
or 2.5 billion years ago. I, um Species of

193
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:17.140
archaea incorporates a bacterium in a symbiotic relationship. Uh,

194
00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:19.679
THAT forms a third branch of life, the eukaryotes,

195
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.750
and we are eukaryotes. And eukaryotic cells are much

196
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.479
more complex than the prokaryotic cells of the, of

197
00:11:29.479 --> 00:11:36.309
these ancestors. And um, Almost all eukaryotes reproduce sexually,

198
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.969
at least at some point in their life cycle.

199
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:44.789
Um, AND, and all, uh, multicellular, uh, or almost

200
00:11:44.789 --> 00:11:48.330
all multicellular life forms like plants and animals and

201
00:11:48.739 --> 00:11:52.030
fungi are eukaryotic species, but not all eukaryotes are

202
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:55.309
multicellular. Many like yeast, for example, is a single-celled

203
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.789
organism. But even yeast, the single-celled organisms reproduce sexually.

204
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:04.609
What does that mean? That the um, Parents form

205
00:12:04.609 --> 00:12:08.250
a, um, and that basically every organism has exactly

206
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.080
2 parents and they get half their DNA from

207
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.450
one parent and half their DNA from the other.

208
00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:18.719
Now, the question is, why did that evolve? And

209
00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:21.090
the answer is we don't know. Uh, THERE are

210
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.250
many, many, many theories about why this very cumbersome

211
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.400
reproductive system evolved, but there's no consensus on why

212
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.109
it evolved. Um, I can just give you a

213
00:12:31.109 --> 00:12:36.849
taste of, of some of the ideas, um. So,

214
00:12:36.969 --> 00:12:39.049
and, and we to really understand the mystery of

215
00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:42.530
this, this is a really costly way to reproduce,

216
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:47.340
because if you're going to Require that two distinct

217
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:51.179
individuals somehow have their genomes combined into a new

218
00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:54.380
offspring. Um, THAT means you have to find a

219
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.929
mate and imagine this is all happening in marine

220
00:12:57.929 --> 00:13:01.400
environments, probably ocean environments, you know, 1 to 2

221
00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:07.219
billion years ago, um, in this vast ocean, how

222
00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:11.820
are One individual going to find a member of,

223
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.299
you know, uh, of the other of their same

224
00:13:14.299 --> 00:13:18.039
species and, you know, somehow get their genomes to

225
00:13:18.039 --> 00:13:20.340
combine. So, there's just the, the chance, you know,

226
00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:23.260
the problem of finding a mate is, is very,

227
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.330
very difficult. Now, at this early stage, There are

228
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.190
not two sexes. There's sexual reproduction. But there are

229
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:33.869
not two sexes, there are two parents. And the

230
00:13:33.869 --> 00:13:36.590
two parents is going to be fundamental to why

231
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.390
we eventually get two sexes. But the, at least

232
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.830
the theorizing at this point is that early on,

233
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:46.580
um, there are not two sexes. Um, NOW, why

234
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:51.460
is this cumbersome system evolving? One idea is that

235
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.739
somehow genetic diversity, that the two parents' genomes are

236
00:13:54.739 --> 00:13:57.419
going to be slightly different, and therefore the offspring

237
00:13:57.419 --> 00:14:01.099
is going to be genetically different from either parent,

238
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.299
and that there might be some advantage that outweighs

239
00:14:04.299 --> 00:14:10.179
the costs of sexual reproduction. Um. That's one idea.

240
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.500
Now, what could that be? It could be that

241
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.260
the environment of the offspring is different from the

242
00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.520
environment of the parents, and therefore being genetically different,

243
00:14:18.619 --> 00:14:20.900
uh, might give at least some of the offspring

244
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.739
some advantages for surviving and reproducing in this new

245
00:14:23.739 --> 00:14:26.010
environment. And one of the main ideas about what

246
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.539
that new environment might be, might be something like

247
00:14:28.539 --> 00:14:33.380
parasites or pathogens that are constantly co-evolving um with

248
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.890
their hosts, and If you want to avoid being

249
00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.770
infected by the same pathogens that infect your parents,

250
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.820
it might be good to be genetically different from

251
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.780
them. Or if you're just in a, in a

252
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.489
very different environment, um, it could be good for

253
00:14:47.489 --> 00:14:49.289
parents to kind of hedge their bets and produce

254
00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:53.890
offspring with a number of different genetic combinations. Another

255
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.770
idea is this would be a way to get

256
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.210
rid of bad mutations. Bad mutations are happening all

257
00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.250
the time, and if you just clonally reproduce, your

258
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:05.239
offspring will, with 100% certainty, have those bad genetic

259
00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:08.609
mutations. But if you combine part of your genome

260
00:15:08.609 --> 00:15:12.169
with part of a parent, It's unlikely that um

261
00:15:12.169 --> 00:15:14.599
your mate will have the same bad mutations that

262
00:15:14.599 --> 00:15:16.890
you do, and your offspring, there are more, you

263
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.690
might be able to form offspring that can basically

264
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.150
get rid of some of those bad mutations. Um,

265
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.369
YOU might form, you know, new combinations of genes

266
00:15:26.369 --> 00:15:28.359
that have advantages. Those are, those are some of

267
00:15:28.359 --> 00:15:31.330
the other ideas. Um, SO these are just a

268
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.309
small fraction of, of the many, many ideas for

269
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.929
why sex, oh, and then a third really important

270
00:15:36.929 --> 00:15:40.409
idea is DNA repair. Um, IF you've got a

271
00:15:40.409 --> 00:15:43.719
bad mutation in, in one part of your genome

272
00:15:43.719 --> 00:15:45.770
and you combine it with a genome that doesn't

273
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:49.489
have that bad mutation, DNA repair mechanisms could operate

274
00:15:49.489 --> 00:15:52.359
there so that the offspring is more likely to

275
00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:56.250
have a better functioning genome. So, these are just

276
00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.169
some of the, of the various ideas out there.

277
00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:03.070
There's no consensus about this, um. But then once

278
00:16:03.409 --> 00:16:06.570
uh sexual reproduction evolved, and this seems to characterize

279
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:10.609
all eukaryotes almost all. And there are some asexual

280
00:16:10.609 --> 00:16:13.289
species, but they tend to be pretty rare. Um,

281
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:18.630
THEN we get. Uh, A whole different dynamic taking

282
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.469
place now where, um, there's all kinds of evolutionary

283
00:16:22.469 --> 00:16:25.710
dynamics come into play when you now have two

284
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:29.510
different individuals having to combine their genomes into um

285
00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:33.429
a single offspring. So that's And that is maybe

286
00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:36.080
all happening at least prior to 1 billion years

287
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.159
ago. So when we're talking about sex, Uh, and

288
00:16:39.159 --> 00:16:41.200
then the eventual evolution of the sexes, which we

289
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.679
haven't gotten to yet. Um, WE really need to

290
00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:46.109
think that this is something that applies over very,

291
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.000
very deep time and across millions and millions of

292
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.440
eukaryotic species, not just, it's not something unique to

293
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.200
us humans or our little branch of the tree

294
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.340
of life. It's a very widespread, um, that has

295
00:16:57.479 --> 00:17:01.799
deep importance for understanding diversity across one of the

296
00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:03.099
three main branches of life.

297
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.449
OK, so let's get then into the evolution of

298
00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:11.290
the sexes, but before that, tell us about the

299
00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.670
concept of anisogamy and why is that important to

300
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:20.410
then understand uh how and why each sex evolved

301
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:25.010
and how we define each of the sexes.

302
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.449
Yeah, so imagine we're 1 billion years ago in

303
00:17:28.449 --> 00:17:31.689
the warm oceans of early Earth, let's say, and

304
00:17:31.689 --> 00:17:35.010
you're a single-celled organism, and you are going to

305
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.689
have to get your part of your genome to

306
00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:40.410
combine with the part of a genome of another

307
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.089
individual. How is that going to happen? Um, NOW,

308
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:47.010
in some species, those two individuals actually join and

309
00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.930
that DNA, of course, in eukaryotes is in the

310
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:53.459
nucleus, and they actually Exchange, uh, what are called

311
00:17:53.459 --> 00:17:57.300
micronuclei. Um, SO there's this direct transfer of, of

312
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.819
the nucleus. However, in most species, the way they

313
00:18:01.819 --> 00:18:05.030
do this is they produce a gamete. This is

314
00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.969
a sex cell. So, this is a cell that

315
00:18:07.969 --> 00:18:13.660
contains um the haploid genome of each parent. And

316
00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:18.910
those two cells Uh, have to find, um, each

317
00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.109
of those cells has to find uh a cell

318
00:18:21.109 --> 00:18:27.170
of another individual, a mate, and fuse. And So,

319
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.930
we now begin to think about the evolution of

320
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:34.579
these gametes and what choices the parents have when

321
00:18:34.579 --> 00:18:37.250
they are making gametes. And the question is, what,

322
00:18:37.369 --> 00:18:40.250
what decisions, quote unquote, or, you know, scare quotes

323
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.709
here, uh, do these single-celled organisms make when they

324
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.170
are deciding how to make their gametes? Well, they're,

325
00:18:47.689 --> 00:18:51.609
um, there's the, uh, property of size, how big

326
00:18:51.609 --> 00:18:53.829
should the gametes be, and why does that matter?

327
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.020
And something about type, and I'll talk about that

328
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.420
in a moment, um, something about mobility, um, could

329
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.500
be really important. So how do these play into

330
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.560
this whole process? Well, the whole, we think. The

331
00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.119
reason sex evolved is somehow there's some benefit of

332
00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:13.880
combining your genome with the genome of a different

333
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.520
individual. So what that means is if you're producing

334
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.920
gametes, you don't want your gametes to fuse with

335
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.040
your own gametes. Now, there are species that do

336
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.609
that. Uh, BUT in general, you would want your

337
00:19:25.609 --> 00:19:28.119
gametes to fuse with the gametes of a different

338
00:19:28.119 --> 00:19:28.640
individual.

339
00:19:29.079 --> 00:19:33.640
Yeah, but there's, for example, species where there's parthenogenesis,

340
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.719
right? Yeah, so there, there, there, there's definitely all

341
00:19:36.719 --> 00:19:40.079
kinds of asexual reproduction and self-fertilization that, that definitely

342
00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:44.219
happens for absolute sure, um, but we think. That

343
00:19:44.219 --> 00:19:49.359
the benefits of sexual reproduction largely derive from combining

344
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.020
um the genomes of different individuals, is something about

345
00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.500
the genetic differences really lead to benefits somehow. Um,

346
00:19:57.619 --> 00:20:00.829
AND so for that to be the case. Um,

347
00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.150
YOU would want to prevent your gametes from fusing

348
00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.069
with your own gametes, and only fuse with the

349
00:20:07.069 --> 00:20:09.750
gametes of other individuals. So, that leads to the

350
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.989
evolution of order called mating types, where the gametes

351
00:20:12.989 --> 00:20:16.910
are basically the same, except they have molecular mechanisms

352
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.349
that define basically a genetic locus on their genome

353
00:20:20.349 --> 00:20:22.910
that says you're type A and you're type B.

354
00:20:22.949 --> 00:20:24.599
And actually the way they refer to mating types

355
00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:27.094
is the plus type. In the minus type, typically.

356
00:20:27.305 --> 00:20:30.064
And there are typically two types, um, in these

357
00:20:30.064 --> 00:20:33.854
single-celled organisms that are reproducing sexually by producing gametes.

358
00:20:34.035 --> 00:20:36.984
Now, some species have many, many types, sometimes hundreds

359
00:20:36.984 --> 00:20:40.545
or thousands. Um, BUT typically, there are two types.

360
00:20:40.785 --> 00:20:42.814
And so, if you're a plus type, you will

361
00:20:42.814 --> 00:20:45.385
only fuse with minus types and minus types will

362
00:20:45.385 --> 00:20:47.885
only fuse with plus types. And one of the

363
00:20:47.895 --> 00:20:51.300
theories for that, is that this ensures that you're

364
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:56.500
going to uh mate or fuse uh your gametes

365
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.339
with the gametes of another individual because they are

366
00:20:59.339 --> 00:21:01.780
a different type. OK, so now we have mating

367
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.079
types. So that's one decision. What type Uh, should

368
00:21:05.079 --> 00:21:08.599
I be? Now, these gametes are releasing these gametes

369
00:21:08.599 --> 00:21:12.229
out into the ocean, into some marine environment, we

370
00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:15.020
think. That gamete has to survive out in the

371
00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.650
wild. Um, IT'S in some sense, it's own little

372
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:22.140
organism. And so that means that you need to

373
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.380
provision it. The parent needs to provision the offspring,

374
00:21:24.459 --> 00:21:28.219
or the offspring, excuse me, the gamete. Um, AND

375
00:21:28.219 --> 00:21:31.619
so the presumption is here that bigger gametes are

376
00:21:31.619 --> 00:21:33.979
going to be better able to survive and then

377
00:21:33.979 --> 00:21:38.140
develop into successfully into offspring that themselves can survive

378
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:43.680
and reproduce. However, There's a trade-off. When you produce

379
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.239
bigger gametes, that means providing more resources into each

380
00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:50.160
gamete. But if resources are limited, and they always

381
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.660
are, producing bigger gametes means producing fewer of them.

382
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.660
And so, parents then have a choice, OK, what

383
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.579
type should my gamete be, number one, but then

384
00:22:01.579 --> 00:22:04.099
how big should it be? Should it be bigger,

385
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.180
in which case, it's more likely to survive and

386
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.939
reproduce, but I can produce fewer of them, or

387
00:22:08.939 --> 00:22:12.020
should it be smaller, in which case, um, it

388
00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.739
may be less likely to reproduce, survive and reproduce,

389
00:22:14.819 --> 00:22:17.369
but I can produce more of them. And so

390
00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:22.760
what we end up with is A situation where

391
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.819
um parents might initially in this kind of theoretical

392
00:22:26.819 --> 00:22:30.140
scenario early on, produce gametes that maybe have a

393
00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:35.660
range of sizes. Um, BUT if two small ones

394
00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.819
fuse, you're going to end up with a small

395
00:22:39.819 --> 00:22:42.300
zygote verilla, and that 1 may not survive and

396
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.130
reproduce at all, um, or it may not be

397
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.890
able to, um, And if you, but if you

398
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.810
produce large ones, you're gonna produce fewer of them,

399
00:22:51.089 --> 00:22:54.109
and so they may not be able to find

400
00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.689
successfully find uh gametes of the other type. So

401
00:22:57.689 --> 00:23:02.869
this is called the um gamete limitation hypothesis that

402
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.119
something about mate search, um, and gamete search is

403
00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:10.520
critical to the evolution of either smaller gametes or

404
00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.189
larger ones. And then the alternative view is, uh,

405
00:23:14.199 --> 00:23:18.449
the gamete competition. Um, HYPOTHESIS that in some sense,

406
00:23:18.609 --> 00:23:23.869
big gametes are a resource, uh, for the small

407
00:23:23.869 --> 00:23:28.290
gametes. So that if small gametes can fuse with

408
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:31.400
a large gamete, then the resulting zygote is very

409
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.569
likely to, to make it, to be able to

410
00:23:33.569 --> 00:23:38.260
survive and reproduce. And so, um, you're going to

411
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:46.010
get this sort of disruptive co-evolutionary process whereby you

412
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.380
either end up wanting to, uh, parents can either

413
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.589
decide, OK, I can make fewer large. Gamtes, um,

414
00:23:54.709 --> 00:23:56.630
or I can make many, many small ones, but

415
00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:01.380
I can't do both. And so, some individuals, uh,

416
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:04.469
may choose to produce many, many small gametes, and

417
00:24:04.469 --> 00:24:06.229
that means that their gametes are going to be

418
00:24:06.229 --> 00:24:08.750
more likely to be the ones, because remember, only

419
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:13.310
one gamete can fertilize one other gamete. And so,

420
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.869
if there's fewer big gametes, those are a very

421
00:24:15.869 --> 00:24:18.790
limited resource. And so, it might pay to produce

422
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:22.869
many, many small gametes. That are then more likely

423
00:24:22.869 --> 00:24:27.180
to successfully reproduce the fewer large gametes, whereas the

424
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.349
advantage of producing the large gametes is that those

425
00:24:29.349 --> 00:24:31.229
large gametes by and large are going to be

426
00:24:31.229 --> 00:24:33.630
more likely to survive and reproduce in the first

427
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.410
place. So you end up with a situation where

428
00:24:36.949 --> 00:24:41.510
Initially, individuals are producing gametes that are the same

429
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.709
size, and there are many species today that still

430
00:24:43.709 --> 00:24:46.750
do that. Those are called isogamous species, where the

431
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.910
gametes aren't different sizes, and there are conditions where

432
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:53.829
that is the more stable strategy for each individual

433
00:24:53.829 --> 00:24:56.449
to produce gametes that are the same size. But

434
00:24:56.449 --> 00:24:58.030
what we see in a wide, wide range of

435
00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.969
species is that they have evolved either to produce.

436
00:25:02.709 --> 00:25:05.589
Um, LARGE ones or small ones, or here's critical,

437
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.640
both. There are many, many species, hermaphroditic species that

438
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.839
produce both large ones and small ones. And this

439
00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:14.229
is critical, because what this means is, and by

440
00:25:14.229 --> 00:25:15.760
the, and by the way, here, this is where

441
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.060
we now have the two sexes. So, the evolution

442
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:24.880
of these different sized gametes is how evolutionary biologists

443
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.479
define the sexes. But notice what it applies to.

444
00:25:27.959 --> 00:25:30.959
It applies to the gametes. You're either producing the

445
00:25:30.959 --> 00:25:33.670
female gamete, which is by definition the large one,

446
00:25:33.959 --> 00:25:35.959
or you're producing the male gamete, which is by

447
00:25:35.959 --> 00:25:38.619
definition the small one, or you can be producing

448
00:25:38.619 --> 00:25:41.660
both of them. So the gametes have a sex,

449
00:25:41.829 --> 00:25:43.520
but the parents might or might not have a

450
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.319
sex. In hermaphroditic species, it doesn't make any sense

451
00:25:47.319 --> 00:25:49.839
to say if you're producing both large gametes and

452
00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:52.939
small gametes, the parent itself doesn't have a sex,

453
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.040
even though it's gametes do. And there are other

454
00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:00.239
species, sequential hermaphrodites, where they produce big ones maybe

455
00:26:00.239 --> 00:26:02.219
to begin with, and then switch to producing small

456
00:26:02.219 --> 00:26:06.469
ones or the other way. Um, AGAIN, it doesn't

457
00:26:06.469 --> 00:26:11.430
make sense necessarily to define the parents, um, as

458
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.630
having a sex. And so this is kind of

459
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:16.270
a critical distinction when we think about the sexes.

460
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:20.270
It's really the options in a gamey production game.

461
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.670
What are your options? And what we see in

462
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.630
a very, very wide range of species is you

463
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:28.709
have two options, only big ones or small ones.

464
00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.030
And in fact, that size difference can in many

465
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.349
cases be enormous, a factor of a million to

466
00:26:33.349 --> 00:26:35.869
1, where, where the large gametes are a million

467
00:26:35.869 --> 00:26:38.150
times bigger than the small ones. So, it can

468
00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.390
be, you just think about, um, you know, chicken

469
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:45.869
eggs versus chicken sperm, you know, massive, massive differences

470
00:26:45.869 --> 00:26:50.219
here. Um, SO, it's that early evolution of Um,

471
00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:55.010
this disruptive evolution of gamete size that leads to

472
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:58.250
these two different sizes, large and small, and that

473
00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.530
then sets off a whole set of, of downstream

474
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.589
evolutionary consequences.

475
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.569
Right, so perhaps this would be a good point

476
00:27:07.569 --> 00:27:11.270
to introduce, uh, two questions that I got from

477
00:27:11.569 --> 00:27:15.089
two different interviews I've done on the show. One

478
00:27:15.089 --> 00:27:19.199
of them is already released with Doctor Herman Ponzer,

479
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.530
an evolutionary anthropologist. The other one is going to

480
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:26.130
come out, I think, in February with Doctor Nathan

481
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:29.650
Lentz, who's an evolutionary biologist. So, um, I mean,

482
00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:34.439
when it comes to. Defining sex because it's defined

483
00:27:34.439 --> 00:27:38.819
on the on the basis of gametes, I mean,

484
00:27:38.839 --> 00:27:43.560
bear in mind that Dr. Herman Ponzer thinks or

485
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.160
agrees that sex is binary. He told me in

486
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.780
the interview that we talked a little bit about

487
00:27:51.579 --> 00:27:54.760
arguments made by people who think that sex is

488
00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.469
not a binary, and he said. Directly that he

489
00:27:58.469 --> 00:28:03.829
thinks a claim like that is not helpful, but

490
00:28:03.829 --> 00:28:07.270
at a certain point I asked him, so on

491
00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.829
what basis do we define sex? Is it on

492
00:28:09.829 --> 00:28:13.550
the basis of gametes then? And he said, yes,

493
00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:17.949
but even that is not a perfect definition and

494
00:28:17.949 --> 00:28:21.670
the examples he gave were something like, OK, so

495
00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:27.060
imagine you have a Boy before puberty who's not

496
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:33.219
yet producing sperm, so is he not a male

497
00:28:33.219 --> 00:28:36.000
yet or is he, is he not a male

498
00:28:36.219 --> 00:28:41.540
and a woman who after menopause is no longer

499
00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.540
producing eggs, so does she stop being a female?

500
00:28:45.619 --> 00:28:48.339
I mean, what do you think about that, that

501
00:28:48.339 --> 00:28:50.160
kind of uh idea?

502
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.479
So, this is really where it's important to keep

503
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:58.280
the distinction between the options in the gamete production

504
00:28:58.859 --> 00:29:04.170
game and how we classify every single individual. So,

505
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:09.420
the, the, the anisogamy definition of the sexes is

506
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:14.770
about the types of gametes you produce. And it's

507
00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.689
about the two types of gametes. So think about

508
00:29:16.689 --> 00:29:19.849
hermaphroditic. So let me just step back. So what

509
00:29:19.849 --> 00:29:22.609
Ponser is talking about is humans. Uh, WE should

510
00:29:22.609 --> 00:29:24.250
really take humans out of when we're talking about

511
00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.489
the evolution of sex and the sex, take humans

512
00:29:26.489 --> 00:29:28.670
out if you want, because we're just one species

513
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:32.050
out of literally millions of species. And these concepts

514
00:29:32.689 --> 00:29:36.920
are meant to explain. The diversity that we see

515
00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.500
across the entire range of eukaryotic species, um, is,

516
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.660
is, and across very deep time, as I've emphasized

517
00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.310
over and over the last billion years or more

518
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:53.410
of evolution. And so, um, A better, you know,

519
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:57.290
example for, for Herman there would be hermaphroditic species

520
00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:00.569
that produce both large gametes and small gametes. You

521
00:30:00.569 --> 00:30:04.829
can't define the parent. Uh, DOESN'T have a sex

522
00:30:04.829 --> 00:30:08.829
there. Um, THEIR options are still to produce male

523
00:30:08.829 --> 00:30:12.969
gametes or female gametes. Um, BUT the parent itself,

524
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.969
uh, doesn't have a sex. It doesn't make sense

525
00:30:15.969 --> 00:30:18.910
to assign a sex to a, a, a simultaneous

526
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.709
hermaphrodite that simultaneously produces both large gametes and small

527
00:30:22.709 --> 00:30:25.829
gametes. It still, uh, makes a huge amount of

528
00:30:25.829 --> 00:30:29.670
sense to assign a sex to the gametes, small

529
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:34.010
ones or large ones. And so, The notion of

530
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.760
sex is about your the options uh that you

531
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.880
have. Now, in species like humans. We early on,

532
00:30:41.969 --> 00:30:44.989
um, we kind of flip a coin, and many,

533
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:49.430
many, many species called gonochoric species or dioecious species,

534
00:30:50.209 --> 00:30:53.089
um, very early on in development, typically flip a

535
00:30:53.089 --> 00:30:56.849
coin, um, a figurative coin. And the figurative coin

536
00:30:56.849 --> 00:30:59.660
might It be a genetic switch like the XY

537
00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:05.209
chromosome system in mammals, or the ZW system in

538
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.079
in birds, for example, or it might be an

539
00:31:08.079 --> 00:31:10.900
environmental sex determination system that we see in many

540
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:16.760
reptiles. But whatever it is, um, developmental pathways diverge

541
00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.560
early. And, um, so that you then are going

542
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.719
to either produce large gametes, or you're going to

543
00:31:23.719 --> 00:31:28.060
produce small gametes. And again, Um, if you wanted

544
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.459
to, you could say, well, this, we can assign

545
00:31:30.459 --> 00:31:34.739
sex to the individuals. Uh, BUT what you're really

546
00:31:34.739 --> 00:31:37.540
doing is saying, are you going to be producing

547
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.260
large gametes, or are you going to be producing

548
00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.020
male gametes, the female gametes, the large gametes, or

549
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.739
male gametes, the small gametes. So, the two sexes

550
00:31:46.739 --> 00:31:49.520
are really about the options in the gamete production.

551
00:31:50.119 --> 00:31:54.520
Um, GAME, not about classifying every single individual out

552
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.800
there during every single phase of their life. Again,

553
00:31:56.959 --> 00:32:01.170
think about sequential hermaphrodites. Uh, THEIR life cycle, um,

554
00:32:01.359 --> 00:32:03.280
they're going to produce large gametes at one point

555
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.560
and small gametes at another point. And so it

556
00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.400
doesn't really make any sense to assign a sex

557
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.959
to that individual across their entire lifespan. It's really

558
00:32:10.959 --> 00:32:14.880
about the gamete production options. And so that's, I

559
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.040
think, where folks like, uh, like Herman are, are

560
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.400
really. Asking the wrong question.

561
00:32:21.949 --> 00:32:25.209
OK, that, that's a very interesting point. Uh, AND

562
00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:27.530
now the other thing that I talked about with

563
00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:31.810
Doctor Nathan Lentz who just recently, uh, earlier this

564
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.050
year released the book, The Sexual Evolution. I mean,

565
00:32:34.089 --> 00:32:36.869
it's actually a very interesting book. It talks about

566
00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:42.155
the things like homosexuality or same-sex behaviors across. The

567
00:32:42.155 --> 00:32:46.944
animal kingdom and he also talks about trans people.

568
00:32:47.244 --> 00:32:50.505
I don't think he directly makes any claims about

569
00:32:50.505 --> 00:32:53.775
sex being binary or non-binary in the book, but

570
00:32:53.775 --> 00:32:57.094
we also talked about that in our conversation and

571
00:32:57.545 --> 00:33:00.885
at a certain point he made the claim that

572
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:08.099
Uh, species that are hermaphrodites should be classified as

573
00:33:08.589 --> 00:33:12.430
a third sex. I mean, what do you think

574
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:13.089
about that?

575
00:33:13.469 --> 00:33:16.469
Again, my, my answer would be sex is about

576
00:33:16.469 --> 00:33:20.150
your options in the gamete production game, and by

577
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:25.140
game I mean an evolutionary scenario where organisms, you

578
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.000
know, make a decision, scare quotes there. Uh, ABOUT

579
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.180
what gametes they're going to produce, and there's just

580
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:36.750
this very, very striking pattern that's not universal, but

581
00:33:37.219 --> 00:33:39.500
very, very striking that in a very wide range

582
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.280
of species, there are two types of gametes, the

583
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.300
large ones and small ones, and that's it. Um,

584
00:33:46.339 --> 00:33:49.160
THERE'S no third gamete type. So, if you don't

585
00:33:49.459 --> 00:33:52.780
have a third gamete type, there's no third sex.

586
00:33:52.819 --> 00:33:57.560
If there's only two gamete types, Um Then there's,

587
00:33:57.589 --> 00:34:01.930
there's, there's two options in your gamete production game.

588
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.150
Um, NOW there are species, we've talked about isogamous

589
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:09.529
species, um, where they've got one option. Uh, AND

590
00:34:09.529 --> 00:34:12.608
we've also talked about, but they, their options are

591
00:34:12.608 --> 00:34:14.089
what type do I do? Do I make a

592
00:34:14.089 --> 00:34:16.529
plus type or a minus type of mating type,

593
00:34:16.608 --> 00:34:19.368
or do I have many more types? Um, SO

594
00:34:19.368 --> 00:34:22.118
they have different options in their gamete production game.

595
00:34:22.368 --> 00:34:25.197
And so, yes, the, the concept of sex, uh,

596
00:34:25.569 --> 00:34:28.368
the sex, so sex still applies, but these sexes

597
00:34:28.648 --> 00:34:30.728
does not apply. It really only applies to the

598
00:34:30.728 --> 00:34:33.728
very, very wide range of species that have two

599
00:34:33.728 --> 00:34:37.340
options in their gamete production game. And that's all,

600
00:34:37.458 --> 00:34:40.540
that's it. It's not really about anything else. Um,

601
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:44.179
IT'S about the downstream consequences that evolutionarily over long

602
00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:46.699
periods of evolutionary time, there are many, many consequences

603
00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:51.559
of that. Um. But, but it's not about trying

604
00:34:51.559 --> 00:34:53.998
to classify every single individual and put them into

605
00:34:53.998 --> 00:34:58.718
some box. Um, THAT, that's not the, that's not

606
00:34:58.718 --> 00:35:02.559
where the explanatory power of this concept comes from.

607
00:35:02.908 --> 00:35:05.938
Um, IT doesn't come from classifying every single individual.

608
00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:09.218
It really comes from what are the evolutionary consequences

609
00:35:09.559 --> 00:35:13.019
of producing large gametes or small gametes or both.

610
00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:17.169
OK, so another thing that you talk about in

611
00:35:17.169 --> 00:35:21.330
your critique of Doctor Fuentes's book is uh why

612
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:26.590
the ratio of males to females is always close

613
00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:29.889
to 1 to 1. I mean, why does that

614
00:35:29.889 --> 00:35:35.409
happen and why is that aspect important for these

615
00:35:35.409 --> 00:35:39.770
discussions surrounding whether sex is binary or not?

616
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:43.909
Yeah. So that's one of the really critical consequences,

617
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:50.020
evolutionary consequences of anisogamy, of having two sexes and

618
00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:54.909
of sexual reproduction. So with sexual reproduction, every individual

619
00:35:54.909 --> 00:35:58.149
has 2 and only 2 parents, and that's where

620
00:35:58.149 --> 00:36:01.350
the that's the ultimate source of the sex binary

621
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.629
is the fact that we are all the product

622
00:36:03.629 --> 00:36:08.550
of 2 and exactly 2 parents. Um, NOW, not

623
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:11.929
all sexually reproducing species, as I've mentioned multiple times,

624
00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.860
uh, have anisogamy, um, but we still all have

625
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:19.550
2 parents. And what that means is, um, then

626
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:25.350
if you do have Uh, anisogamy, and you do

627
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.629
have a situation like, um, as humans, you're going

628
00:36:28.629 --> 00:36:30.830
to, every individual is going to have a mother

629
00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:33.870
and a father. Now, what are the consequences of

630
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:37.979
that for the ratios of males and females in

631
00:36:37.979 --> 00:36:40.709
the population? And this is called the, the Fisher

632
00:36:40.709 --> 00:36:45.719
condition or the Fisher principle. Um, And, and this

633
00:36:45.719 --> 00:36:48.360
was worked out. Even Darwin had a version of

634
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.320
this argument early on. Um, WHAT are the consequences

635
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.520
of that? And the way to think about this

636
00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.270
is to think about the two extreme situations. So,

637
00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:02.379
imagine that you have a population with 99 females

638
00:37:02.379 --> 00:37:09.280
and 1 male. In that theoretical, uh, hypothetical situation.

639
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.959
That male is going to be the father of

640
00:37:11.959 --> 00:37:15.889
every single offspring. Because there's only one male, and

641
00:37:15.889 --> 00:37:19.209
every offspring has to have one. Male, one father

642
00:37:19.209 --> 00:37:23.209
and one mother. Um, WHAT that means is that

643
00:37:23.209 --> 00:37:27.620
there's going to be an enormous, um, selection pressure

644
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:33.209
for the females to begin, who up to this

645
00:37:33.209 --> 00:37:36.010
point have only been producing daughters with very few

646
00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:38.929
males. Um, IF they, the female that gets a

647
00:37:38.929 --> 00:37:43.360
mutation to produce more males, her sons are now

648
00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.129
going to be, because there's such an imbalanced sex

649
00:37:46.129 --> 00:37:49.554
ratio. Your sons are going to be the fathers

650
00:37:49.554 --> 00:37:51.715
of most of the offspring, which is going to

651
00:37:51.715 --> 00:37:54.235
lead to more selection to produce more males. And

652
00:37:54.235 --> 00:37:56.574
what you're going to eventually get is that the

653
00:37:56.834 --> 00:37:59.514
number of males increases relative to the number of

654
00:37:59.514 --> 00:38:04.024
females, and you now approach a 50/50 sex ratio.

655
00:38:04.274 --> 00:38:06.274
And if you flipped it around and say, uh,

656
00:38:06.375 --> 00:38:09.104
there were 99 males and 1 female, then that

657
00:38:09.104 --> 00:38:12.340
female will be the mother of every offspring. And

658
00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.139
so then there would be an evolutionary advantage to

659
00:38:14.139 --> 00:38:16.939
be producing more daughters rather than sons, and that

660
00:38:16.939 --> 00:38:19.929
would again move the sex ratio back to fifty-fifty,

661
00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:25.340
typically. So, it's that dynamic that we think explains

662
00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:29.379
why in most sexually reproducing species, the sex ratio

663
00:38:29.379 --> 00:38:32.979
is close to 1 to 1. And again, that's

664
00:38:32.979 --> 00:38:36.699
one of the explanatory benefits of the sex binary

665
00:38:36.699 --> 00:38:40.399
is it explains these widespread patterns that we see.

666
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:46.250
Um. And so that is, if you um If

667
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.330
you start to reject the sex binary, you have

668
00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:51.290
to then begin to help, OK, what's your explanation?

669
00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.050
You need to have a better explanation for that

670
00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:55.810
kind of dynamic than the one that we already

671
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.419
have. And so far, Um, and all these folks

672
00:38:59.419 --> 00:39:01.729
that claim that sex is not binary, I haven't

673
00:39:01.729 --> 00:39:04.250
really seen any attempts to provide that. Now, maybe

674
00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:07.560
somebody, somebody, somebody will. Uh, SCIENCE is always in

675
00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:11.419
flux. Uh, BUT that's, that's your challenge. If you

676
00:39:11.419 --> 00:39:13.219
want to challenge the sex binary, you have to

677
00:39:13.219 --> 00:39:15.699
challenge these kinds of explanations that have been very

678
00:39:15.699 --> 00:39:18.979
successful at explaining widespread patterns in nature.

679
00:39:20.379 --> 00:39:24.489
Talking about the sex binary in Doctor Fuentes's book,

680
00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:29.860
he talks about uh uh Thomas Locker's account of

681
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.139
Western ideas about sex, and that's actually something that

682
00:39:33.139 --> 00:39:35.939
you include in your critiques. So, uh, what do

683
00:39:35.939 --> 00:39:40.229
you make of his using of Thomas Locker's account

684
00:39:40.229 --> 00:39:40.810
of that?

685
00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:43.810
Yeah, so this was the first I'd ever, uh,

686
00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.500
heard of this account, um, and I was, it

687
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.959
was interesting. I, I was glad that, uh, Fuentes

688
00:39:49.959 --> 00:39:54.949
brought this up. Um, Um, Laqueur is, I believe,

689
00:39:54.989 --> 00:40:03.520
a historian. And um He had this um Um,

690
00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:08.370
one sex model that was apparently, and again, I'm,

691
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.649
I'm not a historian, and this is, this was

692
00:40:10.649 --> 00:40:12.649
the first time I had come across this, but

693
00:40:12.649 --> 00:40:16.520
it was, it was definitely interesting, um, that Galen,

694
00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:21.929
who was a physician in ancient Rome, around that

695
00:40:21.929 --> 00:40:23.810
shortly after the birth of Christ, I think in

696
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:27.610
like the 1st century, um, so, 2000 years ago,

697
00:40:27.649 --> 00:40:31.320
roughly. Um, HE made this claim, and so Galen

698
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.239
was, and, and actually Galen was, is a fascinating

699
00:40:34.239 --> 00:40:39.520
figure. Um, HE, uh, conducted hundreds and hundreds of

700
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.540
dissections and really detailed analyses of anatomy and physiology,

701
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.189
and his ideas really dominated Western medicine for 2000

702
00:40:49.189 --> 00:40:53.139
years, um, almost 1500 years. So, he's really remarkable.

703
00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.199
Character, um, hugely influential and got a lot of

704
00:40:56.199 --> 00:40:58.439
stuff right. Um, HE was really based on, you

705
00:40:58.439 --> 00:41:02.800
know, empirical investigations of human physiology and anatomy and

706
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:08.100
animal physiology and anatomy. I wrote extensively, um, and

707
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:13.969
he made a comment. Uh, THAT all the parts

708
00:41:13.969 --> 00:41:16.689
that men have, women have two, the difference between

709
00:41:16.689 --> 00:41:20.090
them lying in only one thing, namely that in

710
00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:22.330
women, the parts are within the body, whereas in

711
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:24.969
men, they're outside. So he's looking at the genitalia

712
00:41:24.969 --> 00:41:29.179
and he's kind of seeing some analogies between The

713
00:41:29.179 --> 00:41:34.389
external genitalia of men, um, and the internal genitalia

714
00:41:34.389 --> 00:41:39.310
of women. And from this, uh, because Galen was

715
00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:43.850
such an influence on thinking in the West, Laqueur

716
00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:52.409
um claims that um. Western conceptions of sex were

717
00:41:52.409 --> 00:41:58.590
not binary, that they were unitary. Um. And, um,

718
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.169
so this is, you know, really dramatic claim. Is

719
00:42:01.169 --> 00:42:03.010
that really true? Is that, did we not really

720
00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.199
have this concept of, of men and women, uh,

721
00:42:05.209 --> 00:42:08.949
throughout the history of the West? Uh, SO I

722
00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.850
did just a little bit of digging. It didn't

723
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:12.649
take long. I, I kind of went to Wikipedia

724
00:42:12.649 --> 00:42:15.929
right away and immediately found that there were many,

725
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:18.870
many critiques of this by other historians who were

726
00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:22.969
equally, if not, um, more familiar with the literature

727
00:42:22.969 --> 00:42:28.659
that Lacour was talking about. Um, AND, um. One

728
00:42:28.659 --> 00:42:30.860
of the, the, the main ones that I came

729
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.330
across was Katherine Park, who had written a recent

730
00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:37.100
article that I read. Um, AND she really goes

731
00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.719
through the whole argument and pretty convincingly takes apart,

732
00:42:40.739 --> 00:42:45.649
uh, Lacour's argument, um, showing where it comes from,

733
00:42:45.899 --> 00:42:49.300
showing that it really, um, that this was not

734
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.760
the, the, the reigning model in, in Western history,

735
00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.659
and really identifying a lot of weaknesses in Lacour's

736
00:42:55.659 --> 00:42:59.270
scholarship. Now, I'm not a historian. I can't judge,

737
00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:01.949
uh, but I can say at least that there

738
00:43:01.949 --> 00:43:05.949
is vigorous debate about this concept in the historical

739
00:43:05.949 --> 00:43:09.110
among historians, and that at least to an outsider

740
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:13.629
like me, um, there's pretty convincing, uh, criticisms of

741
00:43:13.629 --> 00:43:16.669
it that suggest we shouldn't take it too seriously.

742
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:22.189
Uh, ANOTHER question, what do you think about Fuentes's

743
00:43:22.189 --> 00:43:25.540
use of terms like, uh, I mean, these, uh,

744
00:43:25.889 --> 00:43:29.120
these, these are terms that I, I think he

745
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.139
invented for the book just for the sake of

746
00:43:32.139 --> 00:43:36.939
simplicity. He uses terms like 3G males and 3G

747
00:43:36.939 --> 00:43:41.179
females, and by 3G he's referring to gametes, Gnets,

748
00:43:41.189 --> 00:43:44.229
and gent. And what he means by that or

749
00:43:44.229 --> 00:43:46.550
what he tries to imply with that is that

750
00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:50.510
there are some males and some females who do

751
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:56.620
not have uh uh precise correspondence uh between gametes,

752
00:43:56.790 --> 00:44:00.889
gonads, and genitals. There's variation in that sense. So

753
00:44:01.189 --> 00:44:04.669
what do you think about uh his use of

754
00:44:04.669 --> 00:44:05.429
those terms?

755
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.739
Yeah, before I get to that, I just, uh,

756
00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:09.360
I wanted to say one more thing about the,

757
00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:13.179
the liqueur issue. It took me 5 minutes to

758
00:44:13.179 --> 00:44:16.580
find criticisms of this model, and Fuentes kind of

759
00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:20.649
leads off his major section on sex in humans

760
00:44:20.649 --> 00:44:25.409
with Liqueur's model, implying that this is somehow fact.

761
00:44:25.469 --> 00:44:27.629
And the fact that I could just very, very

762
00:44:27.629 --> 00:44:31.750
quickly, uh, find criticisms of that and the fact

763
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:35.439
that Fuentes didn't. Um, DO that himself, or if

764
00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:37.550
he did do it, he failed to report it.

765
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.399
That would even be worse, I think, in his

766
00:44:39.399 --> 00:44:41.639
book. I really kind of shows the weakness of,

767
00:44:41.719 --> 00:44:44.969
of the scholarship of the book, um. If he's

768
00:44:44.969 --> 00:44:47.330
going to kind of highlight this model, which has

769
00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:50.659
been very influential, he's absolutely right about that, um,

770
00:44:50.679 --> 00:44:52.209
at least from what I can tell as a

771
00:44:52.209 --> 00:44:55.370
non-historian, but um, it looks like Lacour's model really

772
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:58.469
did have a big impact. And even his critics

773
00:44:58.969 --> 00:45:01.370
sort of credit Lacour with kind of raising this

774
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:06.129
issue. What are the historical concepts of, of sex

775
00:45:06.129 --> 00:45:08.370
and the sexes throughout history? That is a really

776
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:10.510
interesting question. And, and it doesn't have to be

777
00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:13.209
a binary concept by any means. Um, THAT'S just.

778
00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.810
Um, BUT the fact that there, there are these

779
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:19.010
really substantial criticisms and the fact that Fuentes doesn't

780
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:22.010
even mention them. Um, OR weigh them against each

781
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:25.209
other. Um, I, I think really typifies a lot

782
00:45:25.209 --> 00:45:27.770
of the book here. Now, getting to your question

783
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:30.090
about his terms, I have no problem with him.

784
00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:33.219
Uh, INTRODUCING new terms. All of us, all of

785
00:45:33.219 --> 00:45:35.979
us scientists do that. Um, WE have certain ways

786
00:45:35.979 --> 00:45:38.610
that we want to conceptualize things and so we

787
00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:41.639
create new terms to do that. It's perfectly legitimate,

788
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.159
um. Those terms are not ones that I'm planning

789
00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:47.719
to adopt. I don't find them very useful or

790
00:45:47.719 --> 00:45:51.360
informative or insightful, but that's me. Uh, EVERY scientist,

791
00:45:51.439 --> 00:45:53.280
every scholar needs to kind of make that decision

792
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.280
for themselves. So, yes, it's part of our job

793
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.719
as, as scholars to, if we think there are

794
00:45:59.719 --> 00:46:03.199
important distinctions to be made, um, to then, if

795
00:46:03.199 --> 00:46:06.629
we think it's, uh, Um, going to be helpful

796
00:46:06.629 --> 00:46:08.989
to invent new terms and the fact that Fuentes

797
00:46:08.989 --> 00:46:11.459
does this is just what, what we all do.

798
00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:13.949
So yeah, perfectly acceptable. I have no problems with

799
00:46:13.949 --> 00:46:14.229
that.

800
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:17.449
Uh, YES, but, uh, I was also trying to

801
00:46:17.449 --> 00:46:21.209
ask you more about the idea behind, uh, those

802
00:46:21.209 --> 00:46:25.010
terms. So the, uh, the fact that there's not,

803
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:30.129
uh, always a perfect correspondence between gametes, gonads, and

804
00:46:30.129 --> 00:46:35.010
genitals, um, when it comes to, uh, males and

805
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:38.050
females in this case. So, uh, do, do you

806
00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:42.010
think that that is a useful idea to keep

807
00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:45.475
in mind when it comes to thinking about Sexual

808
00:46:45.854 --> 00:46:47.044
diversity or not.

809
00:46:47.614 --> 00:46:49.814
Yeah, so again, we're right back to the human

810
00:46:49.814 --> 00:46:52.254
specific case where what I'm trying to emphasize is

811
00:46:52.254 --> 00:46:55.774
that these concepts of sex, uh, and the sexes

812
00:46:55.774 --> 00:46:59.475
really apply across millions of species over deep evolutionary

813
00:46:59.475 --> 00:47:01.004
time, and we don't need to think about humans

814
00:47:01.004 --> 00:47:03.054
at all when we're applying them. Now, when we

815
00:47:03.054 --> 00:47:06.735
get to humans, this is again where what does,

816
00:47:06.935 --> 00:47:11.294
would those distinctions matter for the evolution of our

817
00:47:11.294 --> 00:47:14.094
species? Fuentes doesn't make any argument that they would.

818
00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:17.010
So, at this point, we're not really trying to

819
00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:21.229
elucidate human evolution or the evolution of other species.

820
00:47:22.169 --> 00:47:26.610
Um, WE'RE really trying to classify all humans and

821
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.320
put them into various boxes of various sorts. And

822
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.330
it might be useful, absolutely, uh, for certain, you

823
00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:34.850
know, if you're a medical doctor, uh, and you're

824
00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:37.330
treating patients, these kinds of classifications could be really

825
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:41.689
critical. Um, SO, in certain contexts, in the human

826
00:47:41.689 --> 00:47:46.300
case, Absolutely, um, these distinctions might be absolutely important

827
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.959
and very critical. If we're trying to think about

828
00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:53.040
social roles in humans, where we often do make

829
00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:57.169
decisions about social roles based on sex and And

830
00:47:57.169 --> 00:47:59.639
other considerations. Yeah, this, this could be really, really

831
00:47:59.639 --> 00:48:03.330
important. Um, SO, I don't think there's much case

832
00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:05.469
to be made, very strong case, or at least

833
00:48:05.469 --> 00:48:08.010
one case doesn't make one, that there's any sort

834
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:12.239
of evolutionary consequences of this, uh, downstream or that

835
00:48:12.239 --> 00:48:15.330
it really explains much about human evolution. But for

836
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:18.090
many, many other issues, it might be really, really

837
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:21.489
important to keep these distinctions in mind. So, again,

838
00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:25.459
I have no problem with making these distinctions. As

839
00:48:25.459 --> 00:48:27.739
long as we begin to understand where they would

840
00:48:27.739 --> 00:48:29.530
be useful and where they're not going to be

841
00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:30.699
useful, um.

842
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:34.469
Right. Uh, ANOTHER thing that you talk about in

843
00:48:34.469 --> 00:48:38.969
your critique is the Bateman gradient. What is that

844
00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:42.389
and why does it matter for this discussion?

845
00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:44.510
Again, as I'll, as I'll say over and over

846
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:46.889
and over, this is a concept that applies across

847
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.830
a wide range of species, and the question is,

848
00:48:49.879 --> 00:48:52.149
does it, uh, what is the evidence for it?

849
00:48:52.219 --> 00:48:55.810
What's the theory behind it? Um, CAN we challenge

850
00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:59.879
it? And um so basically what it means is,

851
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:05.780
the abatement gradient is the extent to which Um

852
00:49:06.699 --> 00:49:11.669
Your biological fitness. Correlates with the number of mates.

853
00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:18.159
And so As an individual, male or female, uh,

854
00:49:18.489 --> 00:49:20.850
has one mate, 2 mates, 3 mates, 4 mates,

855
00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:24.409
what impact does that have on their fitness, the

856
00:49:24.409 --> 00:49:28.189
ability to produce offspring that themselves survive and reproduce.

857
00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:35.090
And so, The argument Is that in many cases,

858
00:49:35.159 --> 00:49:40.280
um, The species that produces the smaller gametes is

859
00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:44.320
going to have a steeper Bateman gradient, that is,

860
00:49:44.639 --> 00:49:50.399
that acquiring additional mates would have would increase their

861
00:49:50.399 --> 00:49:54.439
biological fitness more than the other sex. So that's

862
00:49:54.439 --> 00:49:58.000
what the Bateman gradient is. It's the slope of

863
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.659
fitness on number of mates. And the question is,

864
00:50:03.159 --> 00:50:05.800
does this differ? You know, is that slope zero?

865
00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.399
What is the slope? And does it differ between

866
00:50:08.399 --> 00:50:11.439
the sexes, between males and females in species where

867
00:50:11.439 --> 00:50:14.389
that distinction makes sense? Um, THESE would be the,

868
00:50:14.919 --> 00:50:21.169
um. And It's generally taken to be an index

869
00:50:21.169 --> 00:50:26.810
of sexual selection. If it matters that you are

870
00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:29.209
going to have higher fitness if you have two

871
00:50:29.209 --> 00:50:31.969
mates or gain access to two mates than 1,

872
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:35.389
and 3 mates more than 2, more than 1,

873
00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:38.250
then for the sex for which that is true,

874
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.310
there's going to be a lot of Uh, competition

875
00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:43.870
for getting access to that limited number of mates.

876
00:50:43.909 --> 00:50:47.989
Remember, by the Fisher principle, generally the, the ratio

877
00:50:47.989 --> 00:50:51.169
of the sexes is roughly 1 to 1. And

878
00:50:51.169 --> 00:50:55.639
therefore, uh, mates are a limited resource. And so,

879
00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.689
the batement gradient, um, the steeper it is, the

880
00:50:58.689 --> 00:51:02.909
stronger we think sexual selection is. Um, THAT there

881
00:51:02.909 --> 00:51:06.669
would be a greater benefit to either outcompeting members

882
00:51:06.669 --> 00:51:10.310
of your own sex, called intrasexual selection for members

883
00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:15.610
of the opposite sex, or by, uh, convincing, um,

884
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:19.149
the opposite sex, uh, being better at convincing the

885
00:51:19.149 --> 00:51:23.070
opposite sex to mate with you, in. Sexual selection,

886
00:51:23.209 --> 00:51:26.159
uh, for example. So that's, that's what that means,

887
00:51:26.169 --> 00:51:29.889
and that's why that those are the evolutionary consequences

888
00:51:29.889 --> 00:51:32.370
of it, we think. Um, NOW, I will say

889
00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:34.449
there's been lots of criticism of this, and some

890
00:51:34.449 --> 00:51:36.969
of those criticisms have hit home. Um, THIS is

891
00:51:36.969 --> 00:51:40.010
a scientific concept. Scientific concepts are always up for

892
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:43.370
debate, always up for criticism, um, and there have

893
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:47.879
been. A large empirical test does this hold true

894
00:51:48.719 --> 00:51:52.860
across animals, and it looks like, yes, it does.

895
00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:57.689
Um, THERE'S pretty strong evolutionary or empirical evidence um

896
00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:02.580
that um It does, uh, have an impact on,

897
00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:04.810
on sex roles the way that we have thought

898
00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:09.449
it does. And there's also mathematical modeling that shows

899
00:52:09.449 --> 00:52:11.810
that it works. Um, SO, so far, we have

900
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:14.360
good reason to believe that the Bateman ingredient exists,

901
00:52:14.489 --> 00:52:16.169
that there's a sex difference, that it does have

902
00:52:16.169 --> 00:52:19.649
these evolutionary implications, but I think most folks that

903
00:52:19.649 --> 00:52:22.090
are in this area would say, um, more research

904
00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:25.610
on this is needed, more theoretical work and empirical

905
00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:28.070
work will be, will be informative.

906
00:52:29.429 --> 00:52:33.870
So there's a very, very big topic in evolutionary

907
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:36.500
biology that we have to address here since we're

908
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:40.389
talking about sex and for species that of course

909
00:52:40.389 --> 00:52:45.939
reproduce sexually and we're um distinguishing between males and.

910
00:52:46.084 --> 00:52:51.185
Females makes sense. That is sexual selection. So why

911
00:52:51.185 --> 00:52:55.524
is sexual selection so important and do you think

912
00:52:55.524 --> 00:53:01.524
that we could still explain it if sex was

913
00:53:01.524 --> 00:53:02.824
not binary?

914
00:53:04.699 --> 00:53:09.860
Yeah, so, um, in species with two sexes, sexual

915
00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:16.639
selection is related to this Bateman gradient, um. And

916
00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:24.090
Again, the idea that uh Um, the sex that

917
00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:26.449
produces the larger gametes is going to produce fewer

918
00:53:26.449 --> 00:53:29.489
of those gametes, and the sex that produces smaller

919
00:53:29.489 --> 00:53:33.479
gametes in species where this distinction makes sense, um,

920
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:36.540
is going to produce more of those gametes. Um.

921
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:40.699
And so, sexual selection means that there's going to

922
00:53:40.699 --> 00:53:47.010
now be competition for those relatively few gametes, um,

923
00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:52.639
those few large gametes. Um, AND this idea was

924
00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:55.179
first put out there by Darwin. In fact, he

925
00:53:55.179 --> 00:53:58.260
wrote a whole book on it. And it, it's,

926
00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:01.879
was aimed at explaining, again, this widespread pattern that

927
00:54:01.879 --> 00:54:04.320
we see across many, many animal species and even

928
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.120
plant species, sexual selection can operate in plants, we

929
00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.669
think. There's still, there's more debate about that than

930
00:54:09.669 --> 00:54:13.479
there is for animals. Um. But there are sex

931
00:54:13.479 --> 00:54:17.669
differences. Um, THE sexes are not identical, and it,

932
00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:21.229
and a lot of those differences are rather puzzling.

933
00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:24.929
Um, THEY seem to be traits that don't have

934
00:54:24.929 --> 00:54:28.409
any obvious utility for the individual in terms of

935
00:54:28.409 --> 00:54:32.489
their ability to acquire food or resources or defend

936
00:54:32.489 --> 00:54:36.330
themselves from predators. Um, AND in fact, they seem

937
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:38.520
to, in many cases have, would have the opposite

938
00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:42.409
effects on that. And so Darwin was attempting to

939
00:54:42.409 --> 00:54:47.100
explain. This widespread pattern, not universal, but um pretty

940
00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.360
common that there are these often striking sex differences,

941
00:54:50.929 --> 00:54:53.739
many of which are rather puzzling. Um, AND so

942
00:54:53.739 --> 00:54:59.649
he proposed that The sex differences arose by uh

943
00:54:59.649 --> 00:55:01.570
what he called sexual selection. And this is a

944
00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:05.530
principle that's very widely regarded as, as being really

945
00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:08.370
important to explaining the diversity that we see in

946
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:12.129
the living world. Um, AND so, the typical examples

947
00:55:12.129 --> 00:55:15.469
would be, of course, the peacock's tail, but basically,

948
00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:20.439
uh, males, um, Either being very uh physically larger

949
00:55:20.439 --> 00:55:24.399
than females and having bigger weapons, which would suggest

950
00:55:24.399 --> 00:55:26.840
that males are competing with other males for access

951
00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:31.439
to females, or females being really brightly colored or

952
00:55:31.439 --> 00:55:37.260
engaging in elaborate behaviors, or providing resources to females,

953
00:55:37.479 --> 00:55:40.840
um, where they seem to be competing for um

954
00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:47.080
female choice, intersexual selection. Um, SO these patterns are

955
00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:50.879
the, the types of phenomena that sexual selection theory

956
00:55:50.879 --> 00:55:52.040
aims to explain.

957
00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:57.879
Mhm. Uh, SO, uh, another thing that, uh, Doctor

958
00:55:57.879 --> 00:56:00.600
Fuentes talks about in his book has to do

959
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:00.979
with

960
00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:02.879
the, maybe I should interrupt right here. The question

961
00:56:02.879 --> 00:56:04.870
is, uh, because you asked the, the important thing,

962
00:56:04.879 --> 00:56:06.560
and I didn't answer, which is what if we

963
00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:09.379
got rid of the two sexes, we wouldn't. What

964
00:56:09.379 --> 00:56:11.780
would, how would that alter this theory if there's

965
00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:14.060
more than one sex, I mean more than two

966
00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:18.280
sexes, um. And the critics, the folks that are

967
00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:22.560
proposing. You know, these non-binary or, you know, sex

968
00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.919
as a spectrum theory haven't even tackled this, you

969
00:56:24.919 --> 00:56:27.520
know, how, what they attempt to do is, is

970
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.979
try and undermine this theory. Now, does sexual selection

971
00:56:30.199 --> 00:56:32.679
still have a lot of open theoretical questions? Yes.

972
00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.520
Does it still have open empirical questions? Yes. But

973
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.840
I want to emphasize that it's been very successful

974
00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.879
at explaining many, many traits that would be very

975
00:56:41.879 --> 00:56:44.830
difficult to explain otherwise. And if you want to

976
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:48.239
offer an alternative account, You need to provide a

977
00:56:48.239 --> 00:56:51.750
better explanation that better accounts for the empirical evidence

978
00:56:51.969 --> 00:56:53.969
than the theories that we have right now. And

979
00:56:53.969 --> 00:56:57.919
so far, that has not happened. So, maybe it

980
00:56:57.919 --> 00:57:00.719
will, um, if folks want to pursue that, I

981
00:57:00.719 --> 00:57:02.649
encourage them to do so. I'm sure other evolutionary

982
00:57:02.649 --> 00:57:05.979
biologists would as well. Uh, BUT we really don't

983
00:57:05.979 --> 00:57:08.590
have any reason to abandon it at this point.

984
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:11.889
Um, THIS, you know, abandon this very, very successful

985
00:57:11.889 --> 00:57:16.209
theory, which involves the dynamics between two sexes, male

986
00:57:16.209 --> 00:57:16.729
and female.

987
00:57:17.489 --> 00:57:20.070
Yes, that, that's a very important point as well.

988
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:24.610
Um, TALKING about behavioral sex differences because that's also

989
00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:27.790
something that Doctor Fuentes talks about in his book.

990
00:57:28.129 --> 00:57:33.330
Um, TO what extent do they derive from differences

991
00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:37.330
in reproductive biology between the sexes?

992
00:57:38.189 --> 00:57:40.149
Well, some of them are pretty dramatic. So, think

993
00:57:40.149 --> 00:57:44.469
about mammals. Females typically have mammary glands, males typically

994
00:57:44.469 --> 00:57:46.379
do not, um, or at least ones that don't

995
00:57:46.379 --> 00:57:49.229
work. And so, females are gonna be the ones

996
00:57:49.229 --> 00:57:52.219
nursing. They're the ones gonna be getting pregnant. They're

997
00:57:52.219 --> 00:57:58.020
gonna be the ones, uh, nursing offspring. Um. And

998
00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:02.659
males typically are not. Um, AND so there can

999
00:58:02.659 --> 00:58:07.419
be pretty dramatic differences in sex roles in, in

1000
00:58:07.419 --> 00:58:09.459
species, and again, there's still quite a bit of

1001
00:58:09.459 --> 00:58:15.389
debate about how this evolves, um. But yeah, what

1002
00:58:15.389 --> 00:58:19.370
we see is that um often males are going

1003
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:22.229
to be in mammals anyway, and um again, we

1004
00:58:22.229 --> 00:58:25.469
need to be really careful that um the conditions

1005
00:58:25.469 --> 00:58:30.419
of each particular species matter. Things like Mortality rates

1006
00:58:30.419 --> 00:58:34.750
and sex ratios, um, and what are known as

1007
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:36.909
operational sex ratios and adult sex ratios, there's lots

1008
00:58:36.909 --> 00:58:41.030
of subtleties to the theories, um, but they often

1009
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:46.969
can, um, explain empirical patterns where we see females,

1010
00:58:47.469 --> 00:58:49.669
uh, doing all the offspring care and males doing

1011
00:58:49.669 --> 00:58:51.750
almost none, or we can see the reverse where

1012
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:53.790
males are doing the care and females are doing

1013
00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:58.939
none, or where there's bi-parental care, um. And so,

1014
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:02.229
again, these theories are explaining why we can see

1015
00:59:02.229 --> 00:59:05.790
the evolution of sex roles, um, and why we

1016
00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:07.870
see them in one way in some groups of

1017
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:09.949
species and a different way in other groups of

1018
00:59:09.949 --> 00:59:18.699
species. Um, SO, absolutely, um, differences in gamete size

1019
00:59:18.699 --> 00:59:23.290
can lead to differences in the physiology of two

1020
00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:26.739
sexes can then lead to differences, um, and pretty

1021
00:59:26.739 --> 00:59:30.040
dramatic differences in the behaviors of the two species.

1022
00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:35.729
Um, AFTER all, um, I mean, even plants have

1023
00:59:35.729 --> 00:59:38.649
behaviors in, in a, in a very general sense.

1024
00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:41.550
So, uh, you don't survive and reproduce without doing

1025
00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:44.889
something, without changing your environment somehow. And the fact

1026
00:59:44.889 --> 00:59:47.729
that you're producing large gametes versus small gametes means

1027
00:59:47.729 --> 00:59:49.409
the kinds of things you need to do, the

1028
00:59:49.409 --> 00:59:51.489
kinds of alterations that you need to make to

1029
00:59:51.489 --> 00:59:54.689
your environment, uh, can differ in many cases pretty

1030
00:59:54.689 --> 00:59:55.330
dramatically.

1031
00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:59.520
And even when there's variation in terms of, for

1032
00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:05.000
example, certain species where the male perhaps might invest

1033
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.580
more in the offspring, might participate more in parenting,

1034
01:00:09.919 --> 01:00:15.780
um, those, even that variation can be explained by

1035
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:21.229
addressing it or approaching it as sex being binary,

1036
01:00:21.639 --> 01:00:26.469
correct? Yeah, absolutely, so. And again, that's, that's our

1037
01:00:26.469 --> 01:00:29.310
challenge as scientists is to go out in the

1038
01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:31.350
world and observe the world and we see this

1039
01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:34.590
diversity and then we use our theories, our concepts

1040
01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:37.669
to try and explain it. And our theories have

1041
01:00:37.669 --> 01:00:39.909
been pretty good, but not perfect. There's still lots

1042
01:00:39.909 --> 01:00:42.669
of work to do here. Um, AND the question

1043
01:00:42.669 --> 01:00:46.689
is, will You know, ditching the sex binary concept,

1044
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:49.110
give us a better explanation. So far, it has

1045
01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:52.590
not. Um, AND then really the attempts really haven't

1046
01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:55.389
even tried to. So, they've really just kind of

1047
01:00:55.389 --> 01:00:58.209
said, you know, we see this kind of diversity

1048
01:00:58.870 --> 01:01:00.909
in phenotypes, kinds of things that you brought up

1049
01:01:00.909 --> 01:01:05.770
earlier, where the genitalia may not match or the

1050
01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:10.649
um Components of of sex chromosomes may not exactly

1051
01:01:10.649 --> 01:01:14.090
match the the norm or the typical version, um.

1052
01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.639
And that's absolutely true. Those things absolutely exist, but

1053
01:01:17.639 --> 01:01:21.439
what are the evolutionary consequences of that? Um, WE

1054
01:01:21.439 --> 01:01:26.199
have lots of, of pretty interesting theories that have

1055
01:01:26.199 --> 01:01:29.360
made a lot of progress, um, building off the

1056
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:35.350
anti-isogamy concept, and, um. We can't just ditch all

1057
01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:40.959
of those theoretical successes. Um, WITHOUT some really clearly

1058
01:01:40.959 --> 01:01:41.959
superior alternative.

1059
01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.070
Um, SO in terms of behavioral sex differences, there's

1060
01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:50.399
one aspect that I, I mean, in the particular

1061
01:01:50.399 --> 01:01:54.520
case of humans is very interesting in the, in

1062
01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.239
the partic approaching it from an anthropic, of course,

1063
01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.639
an anthropological perspective that has to do with the

1064
01:02:00.639 --> 01:02:05.520
sexual division of labor. So, um, do we know,

1065
01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:09.080
uh, to what extent, uh, the sexual division of

1066
01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:16.040
labor derives from Uh, sex differences between, uh, men

1067
01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:21.139
and women and not, for example, uh, aspects having

1068
01:02:21.139 --> 01:02:26.139
to do with culture or ecology or some other

1069
01:02:26.139 --> 01:02:27.770
aspects of the environment.

1070
01:02:28.219 --> 01:02:31.580
Yeah, we really don't. So, the sexual division of

1071
01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:35.500
labor, which means that, uh, males tend to do,

1072
01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:38.169
and again, this is in humans, um, and we

1073
01:02:38.169 --> 01:02:40.479
might see it in, in other species as well.

1074
01:02:40.969 --> 01:02:44.919
Um, BUT This is something that's very widely observed

1075
01:02:44.919 --> 01:02:48.899
in human societies, that there tend to be, at

1076
01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:53.010
least in certain domains of life, that Uh, women

1077
01:02:53.179 --> 01:02:57.060
typically engage in and other domains where men typically

1078
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:59.810
engage. So the, the classic example would be in,

1079
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:06.709
in most hunter-gatherers, um, what we see. Is that,

1080
01:03:06.719 --> 01:03:09.560
uh, most of the hunting, especially of large game,

1081
01:03:09.629 --> 01:03:12.800
would be done by the males, and most of

1082
01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.280
the, um, but males would also engage in gathering

1083
01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.800
plant foods. But a lot of the, what the

1084
01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.620
females would often be doing is um Gathering, um,

1085
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:28.969
plant foods and, um, hunting smaller game is not

1086
01:03:28.969 --> 01:03:33.169
that uncommon either, and, uh, caring for, for kids.

1087
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:36.199
Um, SO this is a pretty common pattern. Now,

1088
01:03:36.209 --> 01:03:39.139
the question is what explains that pattern, and there's

1089
01:03:39.139 --> 01:03:40.850
lots of debate, and there should be lots of

1090
01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.729
debate, uh, and we need lots of debate, and

1091
01:03:42.729 --> 01:03:46.570
we need more, uh, theoretical, uh, empirical investigations as

1092
01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:50.610
well. Um, BUT the basic Idea, there's a, there's

1093
01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:53.649
a couple, you know, 2 or 3 really important

1094
01:03:53.649 --> 01:03:58.209
ideas here that, um, have been pretty influential, not

1095
01:03:58.209 --> 01:04:02.520
proven. Um, BUT big game is, uh, brings in

1096
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:07.929
lots of calories, but it's also pretty variable. Um,

1097
01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:09.770
THERE'S a lot of variation. Uh, YOU may go

1098
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:13.399
days or even longer, um, before getting your next,

1099
01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:17.770
you know, wooly mammoth, um, or even large bison.

1100
01:04:18.239 --> 01:04:22.159
Um, WHEREAS plant resources and small game tend to

1101
01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:24.719
be, you don't bring as much, as many calories

1102
01:04:24.719 --> 01:04:30.080
in, but they're much more reliable. And so, one

1103
01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.929
of the big advantages of a division of labor

1104
01:04:32.929 --> 01:04:36.760
of any sort is efficiency, that you get one

1105
01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.370
class of individuals specializing in one task and then

1106
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:43.679
being particularly good at it, and another class of

1107
01:04:43.679 --> 01:04:47.199
individuals specializing in, in another task and being particularly

1108
01:04:47.199 --> 01:04:50.219
good at that. And then, but both tasks are

1109
01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:52.899
essential. You can't, you can't rely on one or

1110
01:04:52.899 --> 01:04:56.939
the other. You need both. Um, AND so, one

1111
01:04:56.939 --> 01:04:58.939
of the main arguments for the sexual division of

1112
01:04:58.939 --> 01:05:04.100
labor in hunter-gatherers in humans is the efficiencies that

1113
01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:09.280
come from one group of individuals, typically the males,

1114
01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:14.439
uh, specializing in these high risk, high return resources.

1115
01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:19.969
And, um, another group of individuals, the women, specializing

1116
01:05:19.969 --> 01:05:24.070
in lower return but lower risk resources and also

1117
01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:28.899
specializing in childcare. And uh you need both, um,

1118
01:05:28.919 --> 01:05:32.360
that it's a fully cooperative, interdependent relationship between men

1119
01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.830
and women that is much more efficient than both

1120
01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:39.000
sexes trying to do both things, um, or not

1121
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.040
cooperating at all, which is what we see in

1122
01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.760
many, many mammal species, is that there's no cooperation.

1123
01:05:44.159 --> 01:05:47.219
So, the idea here is that humans entered this

1124
01:05:47.679 --> 01:05:50.540
niche, this ecological niche, and you brought in and

1125
01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:53.979
it is related to ecology here. Where there were

1126
01:05:53.979 --> 01:05:57.899
these very valuable resources out there, these large game,

1127
01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.739
but they were really high risk, um, and required

1128
01:06:00.739 --> 01:06:04.979
high levels of skill, um. And so it took

1129
01:06:04.979 --> 01:06:08.459
years to master the skills necessary to track these

1130
01:06:08.459 --> 01:06:14.790
animals and successfully kill them. Um, AND so, our

1131
01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:18.229
big brains and our long childhoods, um, and the

1132
01:06:18.229 --> 01:06:20.629
sexual division of labor all kind of evolved in

1133
01:06:20.629 --> 01:06:25.340
concert. Equally, um, figuring out all the right plants

1134
01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:28.030
to find and how to process them, uh, to

1135
01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:30.469
extract maximum resources, that takes a lot of skill.

1136
01:06:30.709 --> 01:06:34.229
Raising kids, enormously cognitively demanding, that takes a huge

1137
01:06:34.229 --> 01:06:38.570
amount of skill. So, each sex specializing in these.

1138
01:06:39.219 --> 01:06:43.419
Very cognitively demanding domains, um, and then cooperating with

1139
01:06:43.419 --> 01:06:45.889
each other would have led to enormous efficiency. So,

1140
01:06:45.899 --> 01:06:48.610
that's, that's the theory behind it. Um, IS that

1141
01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:52.300
theory universally accepted? No. Do we need more empirical

1142
01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.679
research? Yes. Do we need more theory theory development?

1143
01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:58.179
Yes. Um, BUT there's a pretty, pretty strong empirical

1144
01:06:58.179 --> 01:07:01.379
pattern that we do need to explain. Um, AND

1145
01:07:01.379 --> 01:07:05.570
there's some pretty, pretty convincing theoretical arguments for, for

1146
01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:10.189
the, um, appearance of that pattern, um. So that's

1147
01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:12.010
That's my brief summary.

1148
01:07:12.979 --> 01:07:16.449
Yeah, uh, what do you make of, uh, uh,

1149
01:07:16.459 --> 01:07:21.219
Doctor Fuentes's saying that we are a biocultural species

1150
01:07:21.219 --> 01:07:23.580
and the idea there is that we should not

1151
01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:28.379
just focus on our, uh, um, on the aspects

1152
01:07:28.379 --> 01:07:31.415
of our biology but also on The fact that

1153
01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:34.915
we have culture and culture that is much more

1154
01:07:34.915 --> 01:07:38.475
complex than uh the culture we find in any

1155
01:07:38.475 --> 01:07:41.195
other species at least that we know of. So

1156
01:07:41.195 --> 01:07:42.425
what do you make of that?

1157
01:07:42.594 --> 01:07:44.425
Oh, I would agree with that. I think most,

1158
01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:49.784
uh, anthropologists would agree with that absolutely, um, that

1159
01:07:49.784 --> 01:07:53.854
our genetic inheritance is critical, but our cultural inheritance

1160
01:07:53.854 --> 01:07:57.199
is too. And so, um, the fact that we

1161
01:07:57.199 --> 01:08:01.239
are a biocultural species, I think that's, um, widely

1162
01:08:01.239 --> 01:08:04.879
accepted in, in anthropology. Um, AND I, I would

1163
01:08:04.879 --> 01:08:07.879
say it's also pretty widely accepted across the life

1164
01:08:07.879 --> 01:08:10.060
sciences and the social sciences. I don't think it's

1165
01:08:10.239 --> 01:08:14.570
a very controversial statement. Um, THERE'S still lots of

1166
01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:18.669
debate about the details of that, um, useful debate

1167
01:08:18.839 --> 01:08:22.850
and useful empirical research, exactly how we should conceptualize

1168
01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:27.009
our cultural inheritance and how we should exactly characterize

1169
01:08:27.009 --> 01:08:31.910
our biological inheritance. Um, THAT'S, those are all very

1170
01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:35.250
important and useful debates, but the fact that both

1171
01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:37.129
are, are essential to who we are as a

1172
01:08:37.129 --> 01:08:39.490
species, I think is, is correct and, and very

1173
01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:40.370
widely accepted.

1174
01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.339
OK, so, uh, you were an evolutionary anthropologist. Uh,

1175
01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:49.129
WHAT is your take on sex and gender? Do

1176
01:08:49.129 --> 01:08:52.149
you think that it is important to distinguish between

1177
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:54.350
them? Uh, DO you do it yourself?

1178
01:08:54.609 --> 01:08:55.890
Yes, I do do it and I do think

1179
01:08:55.890 --> 01:08:59.180
it's critical. So, we have many, um, and so

1180
01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.689
we talked about these, these roles, uh, these kind

1181
01:09:01.689 --> 01:09:05.009
of typical sexual division of labor, um, in, in,

1182
01:09:05.089 --> 01:09:08.290
in hunter-gatherers, but we, we see more diversity in

1183
01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:12.540
that. Um, AND so we humans. Uh, FOR whatever

1184
01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.939
reason, again, we might debate why that is, but

1185
01:09:15.009 --> 01:09:18.729
we, uh, folks tend to be in various roles

1186
01:09:18.729 --> 01:09:23.399
in society. Um, ENGAGING in some kinds of tasks

1187
01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:24.959
versus others. Now, we do see that, of course,

1188
01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:28.229
in other species where females and mammals, for example,

1189
01:09:28.689 --> 01:09:32.689
uh, do most of the, um, parental investment in

1190
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:35.569
birds. It's often by parental investment. So those would

1191
01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:40.060
be roles. Um, AND we humans, um, Have even

1192
01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:43.020
more complex social roles. We have some, the ones

1193
01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.770
that I just talked about with the sexual division

1194
01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:48.100
of labor in, in human hunter-gatherers, uh, but we

1195
01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:52.080
have other roles, and often, uh, those are conceptualized,

1196
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:55.060
um, in terms of sex. So, the, the female

1197
01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:56.779
role, the male role, but there might be a

1198
01:09:56.779 --> 01:10:03.049
third gender role, um. And, um, so there are

1199
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:06.509
many societies that have a third gender or or

1200
01:10:06.509 --> 01:10:10.629
multiple genders. And so, I, I, that's an old

1201
01:10:10.629 --> 01:10:13.529
concept in anthropology and the social sciences that we

1202
01:10:13.529 --> 01:10:17.950
should kind of distinguish biological sex, which is producing

1203
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:22.799
large gametes or producing small ones. Um, FROM in

1204
01:10:22.799 --> 01:10:26.779
humans, the various roles that we assign the sexes,

1205
01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:31.120
um, culture, and, and these do vary across cultures.

1206
01:10:31.229 --> 01:10:34.089
So this is kind of where that biocultural perspective

1207
01:10:34.089 --> 01:10:36.439
would be useful, um, that we need to think

1208
01:10:36.439 --> 01:10:40.640
about the interaction of sex and, uh, gender. And

1209
01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:45.000
that's exactly why we shouldn't, uh, try to conflate

1210
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.479
them. And so Fuentes in his book tries to

1211
01:10:47.479 --> 01:10:51.379
kind of conflate this into a single concept. And

1212
01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:54.399
I would argue that it's critical to keep them

1213
01:10:54.399 --> 01:10:58.549
separate, precisely so that we can understand their interaction,

1214
01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.200
because they do interact, but you can't understand the

1215
01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:04.140
interaction between two factors if you don't keep those

1216
01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:08.839
two factors distinct, um, the distinction between biological sex,

1217
01:11:08.959 --> 01:11:12.770
for which there are two, and Uh, gender roles

1218
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:15.049
for which there may be multiple. There may be

1219
01:11:15.049 --> 01:11:17.129
one, maybe there's one gender role, maybe there's 2,

1220
01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:20.049
maybe there's 3, maybe there's more. Um, WE need

1221
01:11:20.049 --> 01:11:23.330
to keep those two concepts distinct so that we

1222
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:26.209
can precisely understand exactly how they do interact. And

1223
01:11:26.209 --> 01:11:28.370
there's still tons of tons of work to be

1224
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:30.540
done in that area. There's still a lot, uh,

1225
01:11:30.549 --> 01:11:31.649
that we don't know about that.

1226
01:11:32.399 --> 01:11:34.669
Uh, IN what ways, uh, just to ask you

1227
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:36.669
a little bit more about that point, in what

1228
01:11:36.669 --> 01:11:40.319
ways do you, would you say that Doctor Fuentes

1229
01:11:40.319 --> 01:11:43.520
conflates or at, at certain points in the book,

1230
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.109
perhaps conflates the sex and gender? Well,

1231
01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.799
he explicitly does it. He says, I'm going to

1232
01:11:49.799 --> 01:11:51.759
refer to these as sex gender, I think is

1233
01:11:51.759 --> 01:11:55.040
the term, uh, he uses. Let me, um, just

1234
01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.339
quickly, yeah, he refers to them as gender sex.

1235
01:11:58.479 --> 01:12:03.799
Um. So he is very explicitly conflating, uh, and

1236
01:12:03.799 --> 01:12:10.009
here's the quote from, from his book, um. That

1237
01:12:10.009 --> 01:12:12.470
uh he wants, he needs, he wants to conflate

1238
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:15.209
uh gender and sex into a single concept to

1239
01:12:15.209 --> 01:12:19.209
reflect the intertwined biocultural reality of bodies and experiences

1240
01:12:19.209 --> 01:12:25.669
more accurately. Um. And Um, but you can't do

1241
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:27.549
that if you, if you conflate those into a

1242
01:12:27.549 --> 01:12:29.540
single concept. You need to keep them distinct in

1243
01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:33.229
order to understand that interaction and how they do

1244
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:37.109
interact because the interaction is complex, um, and does

1245
01:12:37.109 --> 01:12:40.350
differ across cultures and it is really important to

1246
01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:44.540
our lives. Um, WE'RE, we're constantly debating that, um,

1247
01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.390
as, and we probably always have, uh, you know,

1248
01:12:47.609 --> 01:12:49.759
the, these debates are not new. Um, AS an

1249
01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:54.149
anthropologist, if you look into the ethnographic literature. Uh,

1250
01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.299
DEBATES and conflicts over gender roles and conflicts, uh,

1251
01:12:57.509 --> 01:13:00.750
between the sexes are ubiquitous, and they, they always

1252
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:02.589
have been and they probably always will be, and

1253
01:13:02.589 --> 01:13:06.549
that's OK. Uh, BUT to understand that scientifically and

1254
01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:11.430
to make progress, um, would be very, very difficult

1255
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:13.790
if we can't keep those two concepts distinct.

1256
01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:18.169
Right. So, uh, I have now a question. I,

1257
01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:20.779
I was actually going to ask you one single

1258
01:13:20.779 --> 01:13:23.339
question, but I'm going to divide it into two

1259
01:13:23.339 --> 01:13:25.700
questions because I think that we should do that.

1260
01:13:25.819 --> 01:13:31.060
So, uh, about intersex individuals, how should we account

1261
01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:34.700
for them or people who we now say have

1262
01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.759
differences of sexual development?

1263
01:13:39.459 --> 01:13:43.129
Yeah, I mean, that's a critical question for us

1264
01:13:43.129 --> 01:13:49.430
humans, um, and we scientists can only provide. Uh

1265
01:13:50.319 --> 01:13:53.279
Some insights, but we can't provide answers because this

1266
01:13:53.279 --> 01:13:56.359
is ultimately how we as a society want to

1267
01:13:56.359 --> 01:14:02.410
treat people. And um, So we can, we can

1268
01:14:02.410 --> 01:14:08.680
begin to understand scientifically why that happens, um. And

1269
01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:15.640
Uh, what impacts it has on phenotypes and including

1270
01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:20.779
cognitive and psychological phenotypes and physical phenotypes. And we

1271
01:14:20.779 --> 01:14:25.089
can provide. Evidence of that and explanation for that.

1272
01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:31.810
But ultimately, um, society, the, the individuals themselves, um,

1273
01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:37.390
and, and society at large, um, Needs to really

1274
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:43.899
debate those kinds of questions. And um So I,

1275
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:49.459
I am very much. Opposed to scientists stepping into

1276
01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:55.109
the roles of community. Um, YOU know, political leaders

1277
01:14:55.109 --> 01:14:59.870
or religious leaders or uh moral leaders. Um, WE

1278
01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:02.430
scientists have screwed that up way more than we've

1279
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:04.470
gotten it right. We have been on the wrong

1280
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:08.029
side of history so often. Um, AND just think

1281
01:15:08.029 --> 01:15:10.790
about, uh, Doctor Watson, who just recently passed away,

1282
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:13.870
you know, one of the most brilliant scientists, um.

1283
01:15:14.799 --> 01:15:16.399
And yet it was on the wrong side of

1284
01:15:16.399 --> 01:15:18.879
history when it, when it came to, to race.

1285
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:21.500
We have so many examples and think of Darwin.

1286
01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:25.060
Um, HIMSELF, he was really progressive when it came

1287
01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:29.240
to, um, concept, you know, the social issues of

1288
01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:33.990
slavery, um, and, um, even, you know, recognizing that.

1289
01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:38.850
All humans are human and the similarities between us

1290
01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:41.899
or among us are vastly outweigh the differences, but

1291
01:15:41.899 --> 01:15:45.140
he wasn't so progressive when it came to Uh,

1292
01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:50.299
gender equality. Um, AND so, being a scientist doesn't

1293
01:15:50.299 --> 01:15:53.450
give us, uh, any insights on how to, or,

1294
01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:57.299
uh, any special authority on, on, on, on how

1295
01:15:57.299 --> 01:16:01.100
we should organize our societies. Um, AND, and Steve

1296
01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:02.740
Gould is, is really good on this. He wrote

1297
01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:05.700
a, wrote a whole book, um, really making the

1298
01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:11.290
case for distinguishing moral leadership. And human rights from

1299
01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:13.890
knowledge of the, of the scientific knowledge of the

1300
01:16:13.890 --> 01:16:17.569
world. Um, THESE are really two separate domains, and

1301
01:16:17.569 --> 01:16:19.649
it would be really important to, again, that would

1302
01:16:19.649 --> 01:16:21.319
be another thing that we don't want to conflate.

1303
01:16:21.529 --> 01:16:25.830
So when it comes to intersex individuals, um, We

1304
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:27.470
scientists can provide a little piece of it, but

1305
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:29.410
the bigger piece is, you know, human rights, um,

1306
01:16:29.709 --> 01:16:33.729
everybody, um, Has a right to live a full,

1307
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:36.569
uh, you know, full and a full life and

1308
01:16:36.569 --> 01:16:39.580
a, a, a happy life, a productive life, um,

1309
01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:42.609
fully participate in society. Um, THOSE are the kinds

1310
01:16:42.609 --> 01:16:45.959
of issues where we need moral leadership. Um, AND

1311
01:16:45.959 --> 01:16:47.930
if you look into the literature, I'm, I'm, again,

1312
01:16:48.009 --> 01:16:50.229
I'm not an expert on this at all, but

1313
01:16:50.569 --> 01:16:52.490
none of the literature on this mentions anything about

1314
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:55.450
the biology of sex. All of the literature on

1315
01:16:55.450 --> 01:16:58.770
human rights and morality really deals appropriately, I think,

1316
01:16:58.830 --> 01:17:02.680
with those kinds of issues. Um, AND so, Um,

1317
01:17:02.759 --> 01:17:04.839
that's what I would say, um, about those kinds

1318
01:17:04.839 --> 01:17:05.970
of topics.

1319
01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.759
Mhm. Yeah, I, I mean, I've even had on

1320
01:17:08.759 --> 01:17:12.160
the show, uh, a discussion last year, I think

1321
01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:17.379
it was last year with, uh, two psychologists, um,

1322
01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:22.540
about, uh, gender, and we, we were talking about,

1323
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:27.740
uh, trans people and homosexual people also because they're

1324
01:17:27.879 --> 01:17:31.129
lesbians themselves and, Uh, I mean, at a certain

1325
01:17:31.129 --> 01:17:34.490
point, we were talking about how, I mean, it,

1326
01:17:34.609 --> 01:17:38.689
it, for in, uh, for the case of human

1327
01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:43.279
rights and human, uh, and people who are LGBTQ

1328
01:17:43.279 --> 01:17:48.390
plus, having human rights and having access to work

1329
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:50.799
and housing and all of that. I mean, it

1330
01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:56.029
doesn't really matter that much whether uh people are

1331
01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.569
born this or that way if they are born.

1332
01:17:58.819 --> 01:18:02.350
Born homosexual or if they are born trans, for

1333
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:07.029
example, or if they uh develop in certain kinds

1334
01:18:07.029 --> 01:18:09.240
of ways as homosexual or not. I mean, I,

1335
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:11.910
I know, I know that uh there's lots of

1336
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:14.990
evidence and uh I even talked about that with

1337
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:18.149
Doctor Nathan Lentz when we had our conversation about

1338
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:21.950
his book, The Sexual Evolution that, uh, homosexuality and

1339
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:25.069
same-sex behaviors have a lot of, have a very

1340
01:18:25.069 --> 01:18:28.529
strong biological basis to them, but Even if they

1341
01:18:28.529 --> 01:18:31.209
didn't have, I don't think that would be very

1342
01:18:31.209 --> 01:18:35.509
relevant as to whether uh people who are homosexual

1343
01:18:35.509 --> 01:18:39.370
or people who are uh transgender or people who

1344
01:18:39.370 --> 01:18:44.169
are bisexual or whatever should have uh human rights

1345
01:18:44.169 --> 01:18:48.560
as any of, of, uh uh as uh hetero

1346
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.450
heterosexual people or cis people have rights. I mean,

1347
01:18:52.609 --> 01:18:55.529
I, I don't think that's very relevant, at least

1348
01:18:55.529 --> 01:18:56.529
in my opinion.

1349
01:18:56.859 --> 01:18:59.540
Yeah, I would agree with you. Um, IT would

1350
01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:03.540
be really dangerous to base our human rights on

1351
01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:06.779
scientific theories, because if those theories turn out to

1352
01:19:06.779 --> 01:19:10.299
be wrong, that would undermine our rights. So we

1353
01:19:10.299 --> 01:19:14.250
really want to keep our rights, uh, untied to

1354
01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:18.580
any specific. Scientific theory because we don't want those

1355
01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:22.180
rights to be undermined uh by evidence that those

1356
01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:25.020
theories might be incorrect. And that, that goes for

1357
01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:27.240
whether you think sex is binary or you don't.

1358
01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:32.180
Uh, DON'T, don't base our human rights on, on

1359
01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:36.020
science, which is always unsettled. We never, um, you

1360
01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:38.899
know, the physicists have come up with theories that

1361
01:19:38.899 --> 01:19:44.180
uh, uh, made. You know, mind-bogglingly accurate predictions. And

1362
01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:47.850
yet physicists know their theories are incomplete. Um, SO,

1363
01:19:47.859 --> 01:19:49.220
even the, even the folks that have come up

1364
01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:53.819
with the best scientific theories ever, uh, know that

1365
01:19:53.819 --> 01:19:56.540
their theories are, are not the last word. And

1366
01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:58.740
so, if they, if they have that attitude, we

1367
01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:00.899
need to have that attitude too, that our, our

1368
01:20:00.899 --> 01:20:04.259
scientific theories are always subject to being questioned and

1369
01:20:04.259 --> 01:20:08.060
undermined. And that's exactly why we can't base our

1370
01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:11.500
human rights, um, and our human societies on any

1371
01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:15.680
single theory. These theories can inform. Debates about human

1372
01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:18.959
rights, but they can't determine them. Um, AND this

1373
01:20:18.959 --> 01:20:21.509
is called, um, and, and again, Steve Gould is

1374
01:20:21.509 --> 01:20:24.120
really good on this is called the naturalistic fallacy

1375
01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.069
where we think that the way the world is

1376
01:20:26.069 --> 01:20:27.919
or the way that we think it is, um,

1377
01:20:27.959 --> 01:20:30.470
is the way that it should be. Um, AND

1378
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:33.839
there's, there's no obvious connection between, between, um, the

1379
01:20:33.839 --> 01:20:36.520
way things are and the way Where they should

1380
01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:39.319
be. Um, FOR example, we know that humans can

1381
01:20:39.319 --> 01:20:43.279
be, uh, murderously violent and, and aggressive. Um, THAT'S

1382
01:20:43.279 --> 01:20:45.520
an empirical fact. What the explanation for that is,

1383
01:20:45.609 --> 01:20:47.479
of course, is up for debate. But the, but

1384
01:20:47.479 --> 01:20:49.589
the fact that that is true, doesn't mean it

1385
01:20:49.589 --> 01:20:52.000
should be true. Um, WE should always strive for,

1386
01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:56.020
for more peaceful and, and productive societies, um, despite

1387
01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.979
evidence, uh, that we've often failed to do that.

1388
01:21:00.109 --> 01:21:03.310
So I asked you about intersex individuals, let me

1389
01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:06.709
ask you now directly about, uh, trans people, of

1390
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:11.629
course, um, I mean trans people, uh, if I

1391
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:16.069
understand it correctly, uh, don't really, uh, I mean,

1392
01:21:16.549 --> 01:21:20.350
whether whatever we think about them don't even, uh,

1393
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:23.870
don't really have a bearing on whether sex is

1394
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:27.634
bi. Binary or not because uh being trans orse

1395
01:21:27.634 --> 01:21:31.955
has to do with uh gender identity. So, um,

1396
01:21:32.055 --> 01:21:37.294
but, but, uh, uh, as an evolutionary anthropologist, how

1397
01:21:37.294 --> 01:21:40.194
do you approach trans people? I mean, are they,

1398
01:21:40.634 --> 01:21:46.415
uh, just part of a normal human variation in

1399
01:21:46.415 --> 01:21:48.535
terms of gender identity?

1400
01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:50.959
Yeah, I don't know. And as I said at

1401
01:21:50.959 --> 01:21:53.910
the beginning of, of, uh, the interview here, um,

1402
01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:57.459
I'm not an expert in the evolution of sex

1403
01:21:57.459 --> 01:22:00.919
or of the sexes or even of, of sex

1404
01:22:00.919 --> 01:22:03.080
in humans, um, even though I draw on some

1405
01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:06.279
of these theories. So, you know, in our previous

1406
01:22:06.279 --> 01:22:09.950
interview, we talked about depression and drug use, suicide.

1407
01:22:10.029 --> 01:22:12.319
Those are the areas where, where I'm a specialist,

1408
01:22:12.379 --> 01:22:16.149
uh, mental health and, and evolutionary medicine, not, uh,

1409
01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.089
and so I, uh, as little as. I know

1410
01:22:19.089 --> 01:22:21.990
about um the evolution of sex and the sexes,

1411
01:22:22.029 --> 01:22:25.910
I know even less about uh trans and issues

1412
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:29.790
involving trans and and what that is. Um, AND

1413
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:32.109
a lot of the, the diversity that we see

1414
01:22:32.109 --> 01:22:35.229
in human sexuality. Um, I'm not an expert in

1415
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:39.310
this area at all. So, um, I think what

1416
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:42.069
I could say is that our scientific theories of

1417
01:22:42.069 --> 01:22:44.109
the evolution of the sexes, what we do as

1418
01:22:44.109 --> 01:22:46.060
scientists is we always simplify things, you know, our

1419
01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:50.200
models. Are deliberately simplified so we can make progress.

1420
01:22:50.259 --> 01:22:53.569
And so we have these very, very simple models,

1421
01:22:53.819 --> 01:22:57.399
really, that have been pretty darn good at explaining

1422
01:22:57.819 --> 01:23:03.459
the diversity uh across uh eukaryotes, um, the diversity

1423
01:23:03.459 --> 01:23:06.479
of species. Um, BUT now as we drill down

1424
01:23:06.729 --> 01:23:11.100
into all of the complexities of human reality, um,

1425
01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:13.819
do our theories, uh, even come close to explaining

1426
01:23:13.819 --> 01:23:17.419
this? No, they don't. Uh, WE'RE not, we're not

1427
01:23:17.419 --> 01:23:20.100
anywhere near being able to explain what's going on

1428
01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:24.560
here from an evolutionary perspective. Um, AND me especially,

1429
01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:27.939
I, I know very, very little about these, these

1430
01:23:27.939 --> 01:23:31.720
issues, um. Other than, you know, what I see

1431
01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:35.319
on Twitter, uh, or, you know, on Blue Sky,

1432
01:23:35.439 --> 01:23:37.120
I, I, the issues come up all the time,

1433
01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:40.200
but, um, this would require somebody who's really specialized

1434
01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.240
in this area to, to provide an informative answer.

1435
01:23:43.319 --> 01:23:44.259
I'm not that person.

1436
01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:47.979
No, that's fair enough. So, uh, let me ask

1437
01:23:47.979 --> 01:23:50.450
you then, uh, I, I guess we've already ended

1438
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:54.299
up talking a lot about this throughout our conversation

1439
01:23:54.299 --> 01:23:58.580
when we, for example, talked about sexual selection, but

1440
01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:03.660
what do you think science could be or would

1441
01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:07.899
be giving up if it ditched the binary sex

1442
01:24:07.899 --> 01:24:08.439
concept?

1443
01:24:08.819 --> 01:24:10.700
Yeah, we'd be giving up a lot, um, we'd

1444
01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:15.600
be giving, uh, understanding why are there, um, These

1445
01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:19.359
different types of gametes, uh, what impact did those

1446
01:24:19.359 --> 01:24:25.169
have downstream on why, uh, The numbers of individuals

1447
01:24:25.169 --> 01:24:27.330
that produce each type of gamete tend to be

1448
01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:31.229
pretty balanced. We'd be giving up understanding why, how,

1449
01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:34.850
uh, different types of tissues like testicles and ovaries

1450
01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:39.779
evolved, how different types of genitalia evolved, um, how

1451
01:24:40.049 --> 01:24:44.810
the uterus evolved, how parental care evolved. Um, WHY

1452
01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:48.169
there are sex differences, why often there are lack

1453
01:24:48.169 --> 01:24:50.930
of sex differences. Where do we expect different sex

1454
01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:53.810
differences? Where do we not expect them? Why do

1455
01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:56.410
we see them in these cases and in these

1456
01:24:56.410 --> 01:24:59.009
traits, and we don't see them in other cases

1457
01:24:59.009 --> 01:25:02.560
and for other traits. So, the sex binary has

1458
01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:06.089
been just enormously powerful at explaining a lot of

1459
01:25:06.089 --> 01:25:09.919
the variation. However, This is critical. It doesn't explain

1460
01:25:09.919 --> 01:25:12.410
all of the variation. Uh, THERE'S lots of things

1461
01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:14.669
that every organism has to do to make its

1462
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:16.839
way in the world, and, uh, reproduction is only

1463
01:25:16.839 --> 01:25:19.160
one of those things, and producing gametes is only

1464
01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.109
one of those things. There are many, many, many

1465
01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:24.720
other things, um, that the organism has to do,

1466
01:25:24.799 --> 01:25:27.560
and if those things really depend critically on the

1467
01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:29.879
environment in which it evolved in which it finds

1468
01:25:29.879 --> 01:25:34.709
itself. So, We would be giving up, um, the

1469
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:39.259
explanation for many, many aspects of biological variation, um,

1470
01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:42.799
but there are many other aspects of biological variation

1471
01:25:42.799 --> 01:25:46.839
that are not explained by, by sex. Um, AND

1472
01:25:46.839 --> 01:25:49.040
so we need to, to keep in mind that,

1473
01:25:49.279 --> 01:25:52.959
you know, as an entire organism, there, uh, there's

1474
01:25:52.959 --> 01:25:54.600
many things we have to do, you know, we

1475
01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.859
have to digest our food, we have to avoid

1476
01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:03.009
predators and avoid toxins, um. And learn lots of

1477
01:26:03.009 --> 01:26:07.549
information about our world and You know, form successful

1478
01:26:07.549 --> 01:26:10.520
social relationships in the case of humans, um, and

1479
01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:12.879
learns all kinds of specialized knowledge and, and those

1480
01:26:12.879 --> 01:26:15.020
kinds of things we're going to expect to be

1481
01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:18.600
not really dependent on sex in many, many cases.

1482
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:21.799
Um, SO, many, many aspects of our psychology and

1483
01:26:21.799 --> 01:26:24.029
our biology do not have to do with sex,

1484
01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.919
but we would be giving up. Um, ALL of

1485
01:26:26.919 --> 01:26:29.240
the areas that do, and there are many, many

1486
01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.799
areas that profoundly do depend on that, um, our

1487
01:26:31.799 --> 01:26:36.240
reproductive physiology, um, sex ratios, um, in many cases,

1488
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:42.140
sex roles, um, And uh I'm happy to give

1489
01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:46.020
those up if you provide me uh a more

1490
01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:49.220
powerful and better explanation by the standards of science

1491
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:52.160
that we all follow. Uh, BUT until you do,

1492
01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:54.220
uh, I'm not giving these up.

1493
01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:59.569
OK, so let me address another aspect that Doctor

1494
01:26:59.569 --> 01:27:02.569
Fuentes talks about in his book or at least

1495
01:27:02.569 --> 01:27:05.689
he alludes to it. Um, DO you think that

1496
01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:10.450
the sex binary could be harmful or at least

1497
01:27:10.450 --> 01:27:15.330
that perhaps there are people, uh, who might, who

1498
01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:18.850
might make use of it in harmful ways?

1499
01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:25.750
Yeah, we humans suck. Uh, AND we are very

1500
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:29.350
competitive with each other, and, uh, we often see

1501
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:33.990
the world in a zero-sum way, unfortunately. So, absolutely,

1502
01:27:34.069 --> 01:27:38.700
um. Ideas do have consequences, uh, so I agree

1503
01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:41.620
with that. And I do agree with the larger

1504
01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:47.160
point. That, um. We scientists do have an ethical

1505
01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:50.759
responsibility to think about the impact of what we're

1506
01:27:50.759 --> 01:27:53.720
doing. We are, you know, by and large supported

1507
01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:56.830
by the public. Um, THE public pays our salaries

1508
01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:59.799
in many cases, either through their taxes, if we're

1509
01:27:59.799 --> 01:28:02.919
at a public university the way I am, or

1510
01:28:02.919 --> 01:28:05.000
through their tuition dollars if you're at a private

1511
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.870
university or through. Um, YOU know, donor dollars or

1512
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:12.509
through grant dollars, which also come from taxes. So

1513
01:28:12.509 --> 01:28:15.979
we serve the public. And so when we're doing

1514
01:28:15.979 --> 01:28:20.379
our science, our science ultimately needs to serve the

1515
01:28:20.379 --> 01:28:24.740
public interest. Um, AND that's why the public is

1516
01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:26.859
willing to support us and fund us. They could

1517
01:28:26.859 --> 01:28:29.580
be putting their tax dollars to something else. So

1518
01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:32.540
we are quite privileged, um, that the public has

1519
01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:36.660
by and large, um, elected to contribute a portion

1520
01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:40.020
of their hard earned money to us to do

1521
01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:43.299
our science. Um, SO we do need to think

1522
01:28:43.299 --> 01:28:47.229
about. The ethics of our research and the extent

1523
01:28:47.229 --> 01:28:51.350
to which the consequences of it would provide benefits

1524
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:54.669
to the public versus somehow impose costs on them.

1525
01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:58.009
And that always does require us to think carefully

1526
01:28:58.629 --> 01:29:03.270
about that kind of benefit cost ratio. Um, AND

1527
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:05.500
ideas do have consequences. That's why we're all doing

1528
01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:09.290
science because we believe that scientific concepts and ideas

1529
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:13.209
will have consequences, and we hope good ones. Uh,

1530
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:15.660
BUT not always. They may have, uh, they may

1531
01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:19.470
negatively impact, um, maybe the public at large. Think

1532
01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:22.680
about. You know, the whole debate about biosafety and

1533
01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:26.700
doing research with dangerous pathogens, um, doing that research

1534
01:29:27.359 --> 01:29:29.680
can provide tremendous benefits. We need to understand those

1535
01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:32.540
pathogens in order to better protect ourselves from them.

1536
01:29:32.759 --> 01:29:34.839
But if we make a mistake, um, and there

1537
01:29:34.839 --> 01:29:37.069
have been lab leaks, um, this is not my

1538
01:29:37.069 --> 01:29:39.520
area of expertise at all, but we know historically

1539
01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:43.870
there have been. Um, AND so calls for really,

1540
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.919
you know, being vigilant about biosafety are really important.

1541
01:29:47.459 --> 01:29:50.109
Um, THAT would just be an obvious example. But

1542
01:29:50.109 --> 01:29:52.029
when it comes to, you know, ideas like, like

1543
01:29:52.029 --> 01:29:53.990
the sex binary, uh, we do need to think

1544
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:57.709
carefully about, um, Because I think it is easy

1545
01:29:57.709 --> 01:30:00.310
even for us scientists to commit the naturalistic fallacy.

1546
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:02.830
It's easy for us to slip into thinking, well,

1547
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:05.490
my theory says this is the way things are,

1548
01:30:05.549 --> 01:30:08.089
and therefore, it's the way they should be. Um,

1549
01:30:08.109 --> 01:30:09.870
IF there was a sexual division of labor in

1550
01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:12.580
the past where men were hunting big game and

1551
01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:14.509
women were taking care of the kids, that's the

1552
01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:18.549
way society should be today. No, um, that's, that's

1553
01:30:18.549 --> 01:30:21.149
a classic example of the naturalistic fallacy. So, as

1554
01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:25.109
we Do our research and then convey our findings

1555
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:27.109
to the, the public. We do need to kind

1556
01:30:27.109 --> 01:30:30.310
of think how is this going to land, um,

1557
01:30:30.549 --> 01:30:32.270
and how can we present our results in a

1558
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:36.009
way that maximize the benefits to everyone and minimize

1559
01:30:36.009 --> 01:30:37.970
the cost to anyone. Absolutely.

1560
01:30:39.049 --> 01:30:41.970
Uh, YES, and there, there's even one way that,

1561
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:46.149
uh, I mean, the sex binary or any other

1562
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:51.399
topic that people might, uh, study scientifically. Uh, COULD

1563
01:30:51.399 --> 01:30:54.640
be harmful, not because of, uh, it's not the

1564
01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:58.729
fault of scientists, but it's more that there are

1565
01:30:58.879 --> 01:31:04.520
people out there, people particularly with political motivations that

1566
01:31:04.879 --> 01:31:10.879
might cherry-pick certain aspects of the science, might misrepresent

1567
01:31:10.879 --> 01:31:15.660
aspects of the science, or might. Mischaracterize the way

1568
01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:19.979
that the scientists do their work or the conclusions

1569
01:31:19.979 --> 01:31:24.919
they present from their studies to try to make,

1570
01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:27.979
uh, in that case I would characterize it as

1571
01:31:27.979 --> 01:31:33.279
a pseudo scientific argument uh for certain kinds of,

1572
01:31:33.299 --> 01:31:40.040
um, I mean political. PRACTICES that might harm certain

1573
01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:42.939
groups of people. I mean, that's not the fault

1574
01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:47.259
of the scientists themselves, but unfortunately there are bad

1575
01:31:47.259 --> 01:31:50.200
actors in society and politics like that.

1576
01:31:50.439 --> 01:31:52.919
Yeah, there are bad actors. So here's the way

1577
01:31:52.919 --> 01:31:57.040
I think about it. Science can only benefit the

1578
01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:02.100
public. To the extent that we provide correct explanations

1579
01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:04.939
for the world. That's what gives us our leverage

1580
01:32:04.939 --> 01:32:07.660
on the world to make things better. So, our,

1581
01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:10.419
our first responsibility is to try and get the

1582
01:32:10.419 --> 01:32:13.580
science right. And I hope it's been become clear

1583
01:32:13.879 --> 01:32:16.180
throughout this that that's hard, that we've made progress,

1584
01:32:16.259 --> 01:32:18.299
but we still have a long way, way to

1585
01:32:18.299 --> 01:32:20.270
go, and we, we always need to be humble

1586
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:22.819
that uh our current concepts might be, might be

1587
01:32:22.819 --> 01:32:27.399
wrong. But we can only benefit the public. To

1588
01:32:27.399 --> 01:32:32.279
the extent that we do discover the correct explanation

1589
01:32:32.279 --> 01:32:36.629
for something in the world. And so, um, but

1590
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:39.919
once you find those levers, Uh, those levers could

1591
01:32:39.919 --> 01:32:43.080
be used for, uh, for good or for ill.

1592
01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:47.910
Um, AND so, when we're looking for those levers,

1593
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.080
we need to be sure that there's a clear

1594
01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:53.399
ethical case, um, for doing so. So just to

1595
01:32:53.399 --> 01:32:56.240
take the, the clear example of research on dangerous

1596
01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:01.779
pathogens that will give us. Many levers to improve

1597
01:33:01.959 --> 01:33:04.319
human health, but it could also give us levers

1598
01:33:04.319 --> 01:33:07.540
to create weapons and do all kinds of things

1599
01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:11.680
to, to harm literally millions of people. Um, AND

1600
01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:14.000
that's going to be obviously much less true for

1601
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.540
folks in my discipline. The levers that we find

1602
01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.799
are going to have much smaller impacts, uh, either

1603
01:33:18.799 --> 01:33:22.120
positive or negative, um, but we are searching for

1604
01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:26.350
those levers to then provide them to society to,

1605
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:30.160
to make things better. Um, BUT we need to

1606
01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.799
keep in mind that once we do find them,

1607
01:33:31.919 --> 01:33:35.069
there are going to be bad actors. That want

1608
01:33:35.069 --> 01:33:39.279
to benefit themselves at the expense. Of everyone else.

1609
01:33:39.319 --> 01:33:40.990
And so, we, we do need to think about,

1610
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:47.000
can this lever be used in ways, um Where

1611
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.229
it would benefit a small minority of individuals to,

1612
01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:54.399
uh, to the detriment of, of the majority. Um.

1613
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:58.680
And I don't have any brilliant insights more, you

1614
01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:00.959
know, we're all kind of struggling with, with how

1615
01:34:00.959 --> 01:34:04.120
to do this. Um, IT is a very useful

1616
01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:07.799
and important debate to have. Um, I don't have

1617
01:34:07.799 --> 01:34:11.470
any, any, any magic, any silver bullet here, um,

1618
01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:17.250
any magic solution. Um, BUT, um, I, I will,

1619
01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:19.049
I will add my voice to the many other

1620
01:34:19.049 --> 01:34:21.779
voices that, that it's an important topic and it

1621
01:34:21.779 --> 01:34:26.049
needs to be raised and, um, And considered very

1622
01:34:26.049 --> 01:34:30.129
fully uh for what we do as scientists, absolutely.

1623
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:34.029
OK, so I have just one last question. I

1624
01:34:34.029 --> 01:34:37.250
mean maybe I will have just uh another question

1625
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:41.169
after that, but um do you think that even

1626
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:46.149
with your criticisms of Doctor Fuentes's book and perhaps

1627
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:51.069
the ideas of other people who uh came to

1628
01:34:51.069 --> 01:34:55.410
the same conclusion as he did, uh, that most

1629
01:34:55.470 --> 01:34:59.832
of the arguments. And the information he presents in

1630
01:34:59.832 --> 01:35:05.352
the book are scientific arguments and should be taken

1631
01:35:05.352 --> 01:35:09.872
seriously even if we do not agree with his

1632
01:35:09.872 --> 01:35:14.352
conclusion and even if perhaps, as you said, he

1633
01:35:14.352 --> 01:35:19.791
doesn't provide proper explanations here and therefore these or

1634
01:35:19.791 --> 01:35:24.753
that kind of very. ATION within the animal kingdom,

1635
01:35:25.074 --> 01:35:26.874
uh, and so on. I mean, do, do you

1636
01:35:26.874 --> 01:35:31.773
think that we should, uh, think about that as

1637
01:35:31.994 --> 01:35:35.833
a science, as proper science, and address it as

1638
01:35:35.833 --> 01:35:38.554
science? And I'm asking you that also because, I

1639
01:35:38.554 --> 01:35:43.914
mean, um, I, I interview people from many different

1640
01:35:43.914 --> 01:35:48.675
walks of science and I even interview people. Sometimes

1641
01:35:48.675 --> 01:35:53.355
from different scientific disciplines that approach the same topic

1642
01:35:53.355 --> 01:35:56.866
from different perspectives and they disagree with each other,

1643
01:35:57.116 --> 01:36:00.016
but, but I think that's, that's a very healthy

1644
01:36:00.275 --> 01:36:03.755
disagreement, but when, when it comes to, for example,

1645
01:36:03.956 --> 01:36:08.956
people going on social media and just uh bashing

1646
01:36:09.186 --> 01:36:12.895
er other people's work and saying, oh that's just.

1647
01:36:13.277 --> 01:36:18.377
Science, we shouldn't take it seriously or if someone

1648
01:36:18.598 --> 01:36:22.678
just claims that in this specific case sex is

1649
01:36:22.678 --> 01:36:26.717
a spectrum, I mean that's not even something that

1650
01:36:26.717 --> 01:36:30.277
we should consider. We shouldn't even take that seriously

1651
01:36:30.277 --> 01:36:33.908
from a scientific perspective. It's the same as the

1652
01:36:33.908 --> 01:36:36.268
flat Earth or something like that. I mean, do,

1653
01:36:36.437 --> 01:36:40.109
do you really think that that's a. A healthy

1654
01:36:40.109 --> 01:36:41.729
way of approaching science.

1655
01:36:41.799 --> 01:36:45.020
Yeah, I have, I have no problem with, uh,

1656
01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:49.770
any scientist that wants to question the role, the

1657
01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:56.189
existence of two sexes or anisogamy. Um, It's critical

1658
01:36:56.189 --> 01:36:59.750
that scientific theories and frameworks always be subject to

1659
01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:01.790
criticism. So, we need to, and we need to

1660
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:05.870
kind of bend over backwards to, um, to allow

1661
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:10.890
that. Uh, SO, I have no problem with Fuentes

1662
01:37:10.890 --> 01:37:15.290
or anyone else um taking their shot and seeing,

1663
01:37:15.370 --> 01:37:19.250
um, you know, where they can find weaknesses in

1664
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:23.009
the arguments. Um, THAT'S perfectly legitimate, that's normal science.

1665
01:37:23.089 --> 01:37:27.830
We need to bend over backwards to allow that,

1666
01:37:28.899 --> 01:37:31.819
um, and to encourage that. Um, AND most of

1667
01:37:31.819 --> 01:37:36.890
those efforts probably won't. Bear much fruit, that's OK.

1668
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:39.810
Uh, IT'S taken a long time to get where

1669
01:37:39.810 --> 01:37:41.529
we are, and it's gonna take a long time

1670
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:44.450
to, to, to, to even get further than this.

1671
01:37:44.569 --> 01:37:47.569
Um, SCIENCE is may be frustratingly slow in many

1672
01:37:47.569 --> 01:37:51.830
cases. Um. But what we, what we sometimes see

1673
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:56.509
is the opposite, that, um, That it can become,

1674
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:58.830
you know, politically incorrect to say there are two

1675
01:37:58.830 --> 01:38:01.620
sexes, uh, even though this is one of the

1676
01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:07.839
most powerful, um, Explanatory concepts we have in evolutionary

1677
01:38:07.839 --> 01:38:10.919
biology. Um, SO, if you're gonna be open to

1678
01:38:10.919 --> 01:38:13.520
the criticisms, you, you have to be equally open

1679
01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:16.919
to the existing theory too. Uh, SO that, that,

1680
01:38:17.319 --> 01:38:20.709
you know, that. Uh, SWORD cuts both ways, that's,

1681
01:38:20.759 --> 01:38:23.020
it's a two-way street to pick your metaphor there,

1682
01:38:23.470 --> 01:38:27.569
um. So, yeah, it's, it's perfectly legitimate what what

1683
01:38:27.569 --> 01:38:30.160
Fuentes did. I didn't find it very convincing. Um,

1684
01:38:30.290 --> 01:38:31.930
I'm not going to change anything I do based

1685
01:38:31.930 --> 01:38:37.060
on what he said. Um, BUT I, I, uh,

1686
01:38:37.319 --> 01:38:40.180
strongly defend his, his right and prerogative to do

1687
01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:42.100
that, absolutely, and I think it is abs, it

1688
01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:45.220
is important. Um, AND it actually ironically, you know,

1689
01:38:45.339 --> 01:38:48.770
the fact that there have been several attempts to,

1690
01:38:48.899 --> 01:38:51.500
to call into question the sex binary, and in

1691
01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:54.819
my view, they've been really unsuccessful, that really just

1692
01:38:54.819 --> 01:38:58.979
strengthens our confidence in the existing theory, um, that

1693
01:38:58.979 --> 01:39:01.500
it's, it's kind of hard to attack it. Um,

1694
01:39:01.790 --> 01:39:04.459
SO, yes, let's bring on the attacks, um, and

1695
01:39:04.459 --> 01:39:07.060
let's see what, um, what remains standing at the

1696
01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:08.310
end of these. Absolutely.

1697
01:39:09.259 --> 01:39:13.020
Yeah, great. So Doctor Hagen, uh, just before we

1698
01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:15.379
go, would you like to tell people where they

1699
01:39:15.379 --> 01:39:17.740
can find your work on the internet?

1700
01:39:18.850 --> 01:39:21.250
Um, YEAH, if you just Google Ed Hagan, you'll,

1701
01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:23.890
you'll probably find me pretty easily, but, um, I

1702
01:39:23.890 --> 01:39:26.720
have a website, uh, Ed Hagan.net, that will take

1703
01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.209
you to my faculty page or my Twitter account

1704
01:39:29.209 --> 01:39:32.490
or my Blue Sky account, um, or feel free

1705
01:39:32.490 --> 01:39:34.830
to, uh, it also gives you my email address,

1706
01:39:35.049 --> 01:39:38.549
um, so Ed Hagan.net, uh, will get you there.

1707
01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.979
Great. Uh, I'm also leaving a link to your

1708
01:39:42.979 --> 01:39:46.759
critique, to the full critique of, uh, Agustin Fuentes's

1709
01:39:46.759 --> 01:39:50.240
book Sexist Spectrum, and Doctor Hagen, thank you so
