00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:03.369
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:06.409
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes and

3
00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:09.130
today I'm joined by Doctor Alan Love. He is

4
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.930
distinguished McKnight University professor of philosophy and Winton chair

5
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.840
in the liberal arts at the University of Minnesota,

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.514
as well as director of the Minnes the Center

7
00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:22.795
for Philosophy of Science. And today we're going to

8
00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:27.915
focus on topics such as developmental biology, evolvo approaches

9
00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:33.584
in biology, evolvability, evolutionary novelties, and some other related

10
00:00:33.584 --> 00:00:36.194
topics. So, Doctor Love, welcome to the show. It's

11
00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:37.384
a pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:38.955
Thank you for having me.

13
00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:44.169
So, let me start by asking you, what is

14
00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:47.659
developmental biology? Because of course, on the show, I've

15
00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.700
already talked with many evolutionary biologists, but not so

16
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.639
much with developmental biologists. So what is this discipline

17
00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:59.240
about?

18
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.809
So, developmental biology is the scientific discipline that studies

19
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.089
of how organisms grow and mature from The sort

20
00:01:11.089 --> 00:01:17.050
of earliest stages, say, as fertilized eggs, uh, all

21
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.360
the way through sexual reproduction and maturity, and even,

22
00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:27.370
uh, aging, uh, as well. So, a developmental biologist

23
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.849
is trying to understand and explain, uh, how do

24
00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:35.279
those changes take place? Why does an organ form

25
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.250
properly, at the right place, at the right time?

26
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.050
With the right features, um, generation after generation, think

27
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.199
of, you know, standard, uh, features like your heart

28
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.639
or your lungs, um, your kidneys, all of these

29
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.930
structures are rebuilt every generation, uh, when an organism

30
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.019
develops and the developmental biologist is trying to understand.

31
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.160
How do those patterns get set up? How do

32
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.630
those structures take the right shapes? Uh, HOW do

33
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.440
the cells and other aspects of the organism move

34
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.479
into the right place and be at the right

35
00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.440
locations? And so a developmental biologist is interested in

36
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.399
all those things, um, and has been for a

37
00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:26.240
long time because they have, uh, clearly been a

38
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.160
big challenge to try and understand.

39
00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:35.110
But what is the relationship between developmental biology and

40
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.429
evolutionary biology? How, how does development relate to evolution?

41
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.740
So that's a big question and one that involves

42
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.360
a lot of uh sort of potential controversy, but

43
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.690
at a very basic level, um, evolution, um, assumes

44
00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:02.580
that variation is somehow generated in each, uh, um,

45
00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:07.199
population. Uh, SUCH that that variation would be subject

46
00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:12.630
to selection if it, uh, exhibited fitness differences, um,

47
00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:17.429
of some kind. Well, development is precisely the process

48
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.300
whereby that variation emerges. So if you're gonna understand

49
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:30.130
how evolution can act on variation. Then you want

50
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.529
to understand how that variation came to be in

51
00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.320
the first place. In order to understand how that

52
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.970
variation came to be in the first place, you've

53
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.220
got to understand development. So at a basic level,

54
00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:47.350
that's how development and evolution hook up. Now, The

55
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.669
significance of that is debated. For some, the relationship

56
00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:58.229
is relatively straightforward because the thought is that variation

57
00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:02.350
is simply a natural part of development and there's

58
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.429
no special insight needed for the evolutionary process, and

59
00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:09.100
so the study of development doesn't add very much

60
00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.089
to our evolutionary understanding. At the opposite end of

61
00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:17.269
the spectrum, you've got individuals who think that because

62
00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.339
development is constrained and shaped by different kinds of

63
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.760
physical or um genetic kind of dynamics. Evolution actually

64
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.279
is impacted severely by the way development occurs, and

65
00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:39.609
therefore, if we ignore development, we really misunderstand evolution.

66
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.109
So in some respects, the debate about the relationship

67
00:04:44.109 --> 00:04:47.950
between development and evolution comes down to how much

68
00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:53.869
researchers think developmental processes really make a big difference.

69
00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:57.950
In how evolution happens, and some think it makes

70
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.880
a big difference and others disagree.

71
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.420
OK, but then how can development influence evolution?

72
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.309
Well, so, uh, uh, again, coming back to the

73
00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:15.589
sort of very basic idea that development is the

74
00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:19.250
basis for the generation of variation, if it's the

75
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.589
case that development involves certain kinds of patterns, and

76
00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:31.179
those patterns are reliably occurring. Then those patterns will

77
00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:35.149
be present, and that is what evolution will have

78
00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:38.510
to work on. And so if certain kinds of

79
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.980
variation is not produced by a developing embryo, then

80
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.790
that variation cannot be available for evolution to act

81
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.410
upon. And so, if you think about uh uh

82
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.290
those sorts of possibilities, whether it's uh a sort

83
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.450
of shape of a trait or the uh nature

84
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:09.320
of particular uh morphological features, um, if development, uh,

85
00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:15.329
really sort of constrains what's possible. Then evolution will

86
00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:20.089
be constrained in what it can produce over long

87
00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:23.649
periods of time. Uh, IN a sense, no variation,

88
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.549
no evolution, and so we understand whether the variation

89
00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:31.059
is possible by studying developmental biology.

90
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.170
But can development, uh, apart from constraining, can it

91
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.910
also direct evolution in any way?

92
00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:46.140
So that is a part of how researchers have

93
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.399
been thinking about this, uh, for quite some time.

94
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.170
So the language of constraint that I've been using

95
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.410
is, is one traditional way of thinking about how

96
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.570
development affects evolution. Another way of thinking about it

97
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.609
is in terms of facilitation. That is development actually

98
00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:10.839
makes certain. Changes more likely, um, makes them easier

99
00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:15.320
to happen in some respects, um, and therefore development

100
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.649
can actually facilitate. Uh, EVOLUTION, one might think about

101
00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:24.170
it as lines of least resistance that development makes

102
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:29.140
certain kinds of pathways more accessible than others. So

103
00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:32.130
to some degree you can even uh think of

104
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.529
two words as representing those uh two different ideas.

105
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.130
You can have the language of constraint. Which is

106
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.220
about somehow limiting evolutionary possibilities, but you can also

107
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.899
have the language of evolvability or facilitation that makes

108
00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:50.730
possible certain kinds of evolutionary trajectories.

109
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.220
What is a developmental bias?

110
00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:02.709
So developmental bias is one way of describing how

111
00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:08.630
a developing system might have inherent in it certain

112
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:14.070
ways that it channels, uh, patterns of variation that

113
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:18.420
are available for, uh, development. So if you have,

114
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.799
uh, certain kinds of constraints on Uh, say the

115
00:08:22.799 --> 00:08:27.799
size of structures or, uh, whether or not certain

116
00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:32.479
kinds of, uh, features grow first and other features

117
00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:37.400
grow second or third, um, those sorts of biases

118
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.659
and how development works can then lead to certain

119
00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:47.890
kinds of Um, biases in what's possible evolutionarily. So,

120
00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:52.859
to study developmental bias, you're interested in trying to

121
00:08:52.859 --> 00:08:56.419
understand what those patterns are, um, and then see

122
00:08:56.419 --> 00:09:01.140
if they map on to our broader understanding of

123
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.140
the pattern of evolution.

124
00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:09.650
So earlier you mentioned that development is the source

125
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:14.409
of vari variation that then evolution works with. But

126
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.840
I mean, uh, at least in a more basic

127
00:09:18.409 --> 00:09:23.315
understanding of evolution with Tend to say that variation

128
00:09:23.315 --> 00:09:29.234
stems from random genetic mutation. I mean, what, uh,

129
00:09:29.294 --> 00:09:31.505
I, I mean, so what do you mean exactly

130
00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:36.224
when you say that variation stems from development? Yeah,

131
00:09:36.405 --> 00:09:39.885
so that's, that's a good question because it highlights

132
00:09:39.885 --> 00:09:44.315
an important way in which uh some traditional views

133
00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:50.919
about evolution sort of skipped development because Yes, one

134
00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:57.320
source of variation is mutation, um, mutation that appears

135
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.440
in an undirected fashion with respect to the organism's

136
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.950
needs. But that mutation has to somehow manifest in

137
00:10:07.119 --> 00:10:11.840
the organism's physiology or morphology. And the way that

138
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.119
it manifests is gonna be through developmental processes. And

139
00:10:16.119 --> 00:10:19.640
we know now that you can have a mutation.

140
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.679
That doesn't have any effects, and you can have

141
00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:27.919
a mutation that has very large effects, and the

142
00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:32.119
reason why a mutation has or doesn't have effects

143
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.559
is oftentimes due to how the system develops. And

144
00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:41.390
so systems can buffer, uh, mutations or systems can

145
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.520
be highly sensitive to mutations, and the only way

146
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.929
to understand that is to study development. And to

147
00:10:47.929 --> 00:10:53.409
study how those sensitivities or those bufferings occur. And

148
00:10:53.409 --> 00:10:57.289
if you only say, well, there was a mutation

149
00:10:57.289 --> 00:11:00.640
and then we got variation, that's simply to say,

150
00:11:00.849 --> 00:11:03.250
well we put development in a black box and

151
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.450
we don't understand how the mutation actually generated the

152
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:12.330
variation. And since we know that simply having a

153
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:17.599
mutation doesn't automatically mean you get variation. The only

154
00:11:17.599 --> 00:11:20.760
way to know the consequences of a mutation for

155
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.559
evolution is to study the developmental processes by which

156
00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.150
its effects are manifested.

157
00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:32.669
Could you give us perhaps some examples of non-genetic

158
00:11:32.669 --> 00:11:37.359
developmental processes that play out in evolution?

159
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.309
What do you, um, uh, not quite sure about

160
00:11:40.309 --> 00:11:40.950
the question.

161
00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:48.539
I mean, those developmental processes that would influence evolution,

162
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.659
could you give us some examples of that?

163
00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:54.429
Yeah, so, um, classic example would be along the

164
00:11:54.429 --> 00:11:58.340
lines that I mentioned before in terms of, uh,

165
00:11:58.349 --> 00:12:03.869
whether something grows earlier or grows later. Uh, SO,

166
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:09.359
in, uh, amphibians, um, Uh, uh, when you look

167
00:12:09.359 --> 00:12:15.119
at, uh, different taxa, um. Uh, SO looking at,

168
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:21.799
say, at, um, uh, frogs versus, um, salamanders, um,

169
00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:25.530
or sort of other taxa, and you dig in

170
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.210
deeply to like, well, how is it the case

171
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.530
that their digits develop, right? And you sort of

172
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.770
look carefully and it turns out that their digits

173
00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.929
don't develop in the same way, that in some

174
00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:42.049
cases, um, uh, one digit, say your first digit

175
00:12:42.049 --> 00:12:46.489
or your thumb. A That one grows first, and

176
00:12:46.489 --> 00:12:51.090
then say your pinky digit grows last or uh

177
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.210
some other pattern like that. And then you say,

178
00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:57.489
well, wait, if we look at, say, the evolutionary

179
00:12:57.489 --> 00:13:05.659
patterns of digit evolution. Do they reflect these developmental

180
00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:09.429
details? And sure enough, um, in a number of

181
00:13:09.429 --> 00:13:13.099
studies, what researchers have found is that the pattern

182
00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:17.609
of evolution follows the pattern of development. For example,

183
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:22.940
if you have a pinky digit growing last, you're

184
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.619
more likely to lose that digit evolutionarily. Because it

185
00:13:27.619 --> 00:13:31.289
grows last and therefore is more likely to be

186
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:36.059
uh truncated um in a developmental process. Similarly, if

187
00:13:36.059 --> 00:13:38.619
a different digit grows last, you get a different

188
00:13:38.619 --> 00:13:41.099
pattern. And so the idea is that if you

189
00:13:41.099 --> 00:13:45.440
don't understand how that development works, You don't understand

190
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.909
why you get that evolutionary pattern. Similarly, um, uh,

191
00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:54.539
other concerns, uh, relate to the physics of development

192
00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:58.239
and the fact that certain kinds of, um, physical

193
00:13:58.239 --> 00:14:02.919
factors that occur, uh, during development in terms of

194
00:14:02.919 --> 00:14:07.119
how uh shape or size or sort of physical

195
00:14:07.119 --> 00:14:12.530
interactions take place, uh, can constrain or facilitate certain

196
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.679
kinds of development. And so those are gonna affect

197
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:21.049
small animals differently than they affect large animals, because

198
00:14:21.049 --> 00:14:23.609
the physics of small animals are different than the

199
00:14:23.609 --> 00:14:27.330
physics of large animals, um, and again, if you

200
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:32.890
don't understand those, uh, sort of developmental biasing features,

201
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.450
then you're not gonna understand why you get certain

202
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.530
kinds of evolutionary patterns in those taxa.

203
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.400
Are these developmental processes inherited? I mean, are they

204
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:50.840
transmitted between generations and if so, how does that

205
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.950
transmission occur? Is it genetically or through other means?

206
00:14:56.479 --> 00:15:00.400
So, for most of the things we've been talking

207
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.799
about, the, uh, there is the genetic transmission of

208
00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:08.479
those developmental processes, so they are inherited and therefore

209
00:15:08.479 --> 00:15:10.989
are a part of what you would expect. To

210
00:15:10.989 --> 00:15:15.340
be involved in evolutionary processes because they're not only

211
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.229
exhibiting variation and fitness differences, but they're also heritable.

212
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.169
Um, IN some cases, uh, those features are not

213
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.900
heritable in the, uh, um, physical sense, um, but

214
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.419
they are, um, heritable in the sense that they

215
00:15:34.419 --> 00:15:39.250
reappear in the environment reliably and are correlated. Um,

216
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.739
FROM ancestor to descendant. So most of the physical

217
00:15:42.739 --> 00:15:46.900
dynamics are gonna be along those lines. The physics

218
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:51.099
themselves are not inherited by the organism, but the

219
00:15:51.099 --> 00:15:54.489
organism by virtue of being made of certain materials

220
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:59.169
and being in certain environments, will reliably have those

221
00:15:59.169 --> 00:16:05.059
same physical dynamics occurring each generation. Um, AND therefore,

222
00:16:05.239 --> 00:16:09.590
those sorts of causal effects will always be present,

223
00:16:09.919 --> 00:16:14.190
uh, down through a lineage, uh, through evolutionary time.

224
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.030
Uh, CAN they also be transmitted in any way

225
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.989
through epigenetics

226
00:16:20.989 --> 00:16:25.270
or? So epigenetics, uh, so first we have to

227
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.109
be careful because epigenetics means different things to different

228
00:16:28.109 --> 00:16:32.869
people, but, um, uh, so one kind of epigenetics

229
00:16:32.869 --> 00:16:37.669
would be a, uh, effect on gene expression that

230
00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:42.830
might occur through the methylation of DNA. That, uh,

231
00:16:43.179 --> 00:16:47.739
facilitates or shuts down certain kinds of gene expression,

232
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:51.229
and if that gets inherited, um, from one generation

233
00:16:51.229 --> 00:16:53.460
to the next, then you can have an evolutionary

234
00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.210
effect, um. That way, that's a certain kind of

235
00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:01.929
epigenetics. Another way of thinking about epigenetics is in

236
00:17:01.929 --> 00:17:07.560
terms of all the uh factors that go into

237
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:13.400
um producing a phenotype. Uh, THAT are sort of

238
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.829
beyond the genetics. So that includes cellular interactions, it

239
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.890
includes some of the physical dynamics we're talking about

240
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:26.848
before, um, and includes basically anything that's somehow not

241
00:17:26.848 --> 00:17:31.530
strictly genetic. Um, AND on that latter notion, a

242
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.770
lot of the things we've been talking about would

243
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:39.119
count as epigenetics, um. And therefore, you know, if

244
00:17:39.119 --> 00:17:42.599
you were asking, does epigenetics make a difference for

245
00:17:42.599 --> 00:17:46.079
evolution, the answer would be yes, but there we

246
00:17:46.079 --> 00:17:50.520
would need to be careful because, um, arguably in

247
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.349
that phrasing, we are saying something like much of

248
00:17:54.349 --> 00:17:59.239
development is about epigenetics, and we're saying that development

249
00:17:59.239 --> 00:18:03.729
makes a difference for evolution so that Claim that

250
00:18:03.729 --> 00:18:08.270
epigenetics is involved is maybe not as uh um

251
00:18:08.609 --> 00:18:14.290
uh conceptually novel as uh maybe sometimes is suggested.

252
00:18:14.489 --> 00:18:17.650
It's a rather old claim about the importance of

253
00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:18.810
development itself.

254
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.680
Mhm. What are the evil evil approaches in biology?

255
00:18:25.859 --> 00:18:32.239
So, Ivo Devo approaches in biology constitute a real

256
00:18:32.239 --> 00:18:40.760
mixture of trying to bring different approaches from individual

257
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:46.660
disciplines together into a common space. So bringing concerns

258
00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:52.800
about population biology, bringing concerns about development and embryogenesis,

259
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:59.119
bringing concerns about uh comparative biology and phylogenetic uh

260
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:04.010
uh reconstruction and understanding the relationship between taxa, uh,

261
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.810
as well as thinking in terms of deep time

262
00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:10.130
and understanding patterns of variation in the fossil record.

263
00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.829
And Ivodevo approach is typically understood to be a

264
00:19:16.099 --> 00:19:21.339
uh way of representing this combination. Of methods that

265
00:19:21.339 --> 00:19:25.020
are employed, so hence they're called Evodevo because they're

266
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.900
intended to sort of flag that mixture of evolutionary

267
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:35.180
and developmental approaches uh that get applied to particular

268
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.449
groups of organisms to understand how they evolve. So,

269
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:46.800
I typically Describe Ivodevo as inherently interdisciplinary, because it

270
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.890
works at the junction of multiple disciplines, and as

271
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:56.890
a consequence, is both an interesting space. And also

272
00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.930
a challenging one, because when you are at the

273
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.410
junction of different disciplines, you also have questions about

274
00:20:04.729 --> 00:20:09.689
how do you understand evidence when these different communities

275
00:20:09.689 --> 00:20:12.949
don't necessarily agree on how to proceed. You know,

276
00:20:13.089 --> 00:20:16.130
how a paleontologist thinks about evidence is very different

277
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.040
than how a developmental biologist thinks about evidence, um,

278
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.979
and how an evolutionary biologist thinks about modeling. IS

279
00:20:23.979 --> 00:20:27.699
very different than how a developmental biologist thinks about

280
00:20:27.699 --> 00:20:30.800
modeling. So how do you bring all those uh

281
00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:35.020
different kinds of scientific approaches together into a mixture

282
00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.459
that's productive and what we've seen over time is

283
00:20:38.459 --> 00:20:41.635
that it can be done. But it oftentimes has

284
00:20:41.635 --> 00:20:45.314
pitfalls and um uh key issues that have to

285
00:20:45.314 --> 00:20:48.074
be engaged with in order to do so. And

286
00:20:48.074 --> 00:20:49.974
it's part of the reason why I think Evo

287
00:20:49.974 --> 00:20:55.145
Devo approaches tend to have controversy uh surrounding them.

288
00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.069
So, please correct me if I'm wrong, but if

289
00:20:59.069 --> 00:21:03.420
I get the role that uh developmental biology plays

290
00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:08.109
in our understanding of how evolution plays out, then

291
00:21:08.109 --> 00:21:12.589
the traditional picture that we have of a variation

292
00:21:12.589 --> 00:21:16.869
produced by uh genetic, uh, I mean, uh uh

293
00:21:16.869 --> 00:21:21.199
produced genetically across individuals. I mean, the, it's been

294
00:21:21.199 --> 00:21:26.550
the result of a random genetic mutation. And then

295
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:32.829
selection occurring upon that variation. I mean, the picture

296
00:21:32.829 --> 00:21:37.069
that we get by adding developmental biology to that

297
00:21:37.069 --> 00:21:39.349
is much more complex.

298
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.319
Uh, YES, I do think that that picture is

299
00:21:43.319 --> 00:21:47.760
much more complex. I think that whether or not

300
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:53.280
it undermines that traditional, uh, view is an open

301
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.660
question. And so a lot of discussion. Over the

302
00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:01.939
past decade or more about say ideas like the

303
00:22:01.939 --> 00:22:06.819
extended evolutionary synthesis have been about to what degree

304
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.900
do some of these uh additions of development and

305
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:15.560
other factors really call into question the more traditional

306
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.290
understanding. However, as I noted, There are ways that

307
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.959
you can think about including development that would be.

308
00:22:25.449 --> 00:22:29.569
Sort of more or less complimentary to that traditional

309
00:22:29.569 --> 00:22:33.089
picture. Um, AND so I think that, uh, we

310
00:22:33.089 --> 00:22:37.569
really are at a moment of time where the

311
00:22:37.569 --> 00:22:42.170
consequences for sort of thinking about evolution are still

312
00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:46.010
being worked out. Um, WE don't yet have a

313
00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:51.219
sort of common consensus picture for How does development

314
00:22:51.219 --> 00:22:54.469
change the way we view evolution? We've got different

315
00:22:54.469 --> 00:22:57.380
ways of thinking about that, some of them, uh,

316
00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.939
more or less compelling, but there still remains controversy.

317
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.660
I think that at the end of the day,

318
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.140
it's now very difficult for somebody to completely go

319
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.920
back to the old view that ignored development, um,

320
00:23:12.949 --> 00:23:15.670
because we've just seen too many ways in which

321
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.530
development can be relevant. At the same time, uh,

322
00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:23.390
that doesn't mean the controversy has somehow been resolved

323
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:27.430
and there are still key questions, uh, that remain

324
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:31.670
about how complex is the evolutionary process as a

325
00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.939
consequence of taking development seriously.

326
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:39.910
Right, but even if we are still figuring that

327
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:46.510
out, if it could undermine the traditional picture of

328
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:50.750
evolution that I described earlier, in what ways could

329
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:51.869
that be done?

330
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:56.469
So I think that to some degree, it depends

331
00:23:56.469 --> 00:24:00.739
on how you sort of cast that traditional picture.

332
00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:06.420
So, one aspect of the traditional picture is gradualism,

333
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:11.229
that you have gradual transitions. Um, SOME of the

334
00:24:11.229 --> 00:24:16.189
ways in which development occurs seems to suggest step

335
00:24:16.189 --> 00:24:21.020
changes or qualitative thresholds of different kinds. That would

336
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:26.969
then potentially call into question whether gradualism is always

337
00:24:26.969 --> 00:24:33.130
the way evolutionary change occurs. Um, uh, ANOTHER, uh,

338
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.310
uh, sort of traditional part of that picture is

339
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:43.569
that natural selection can really take a, uh, uh,

340
00:24:43.579 --> 00:24:46.750
a trait or a population of organisms in any

341
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:52.640
direction. And, uh, the Empirical work coming out of

342
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.630
development um suggests that that's very implausible. Uh, IT

343
00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:03.280
suggests that there are these constraints and facilitations that

344
00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.520
suggest there are certain kinds of expected pathways that

345
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.160
might even be predictable, um, for how evolution occurs

346
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.979
because of development. So those would be two ways

347
00:25:15.979 --> 00:25:19.849
in which the traditional picture could be challenged by,

348
00:25:20.099 --> 00:25:23.459
by development, um, and, you know, at the same

349
00:25:23.459 --> 00:25:27.699
time, uh, that doesn't mean, for example, with respect

350
00:25:27.699 --> 00:25:33.339
to gradualism that because sometimes gradualism could be violated,

351
00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.339
it doesn't mean evolutionary change is never gradual. It

352
00:25:37.339 --> 00:25:42.250
actually most likely is some complex combination. Um, AND

353
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:46.900
similarly for thinking about patterns of evolution, um, just

354
00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.089
because we can detect patterns of evolution because of

355
00:25:50.089 --> 00:25:53.859
development, um, it's still the case that there are

356
00:25:53.859 --> 00:25:57.959
lots of possibilities for natural selection to explore. So

357
00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:01.930
in that respect, we could also still see a

358
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:06.219
very strong creative role for natural selection in shaping

359
00:26:06.219 --> 00:26:07.530
evolutionary outcomes.

360
00:26:08.939 --> 00:26:12.589
And what do you make of the extended evolutionary

361
00:26:12.589 --> 00:26:16.449
synthesis or of that proposal as you mentioned earlier?

362
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.989
I mean, and adding to the picture of things

363
00:26:18.989 --> 00:26:24.689
like epigenetics, cultural evolution, niche construction, and in the

364
00:26:24.689 --> 00:26:27.939
particular case of humans, language and

365
00:26:27.939 --> 00:26:32.890
symboli. Yeah, so the extended evolutionary synthesis has, you

366
00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.459
know, as I mentioned before, been around for, um,

367
00:26:36.469 --> 00:26:40.469
more than a decade. Um, uh, KIND of some

368
00:26:40.469 --> 00:26:43.310
of its initial rumblings were in the um mid

369
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:48.689
2000s. It was a way in which different researchers

370
00:26:48.689 --> 00:26:53.819
could sort of come together and express their discomfort

371
00:26:53.819 --> 00:26:57.630
with the traditional picture and try and articulate an

372
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:03.459
alternative. I think that the uh reality is that

373
00:27:03.459 --> 00:27:10.050
the alternative picture was not necessarily fully coherent. Um,

374
00:27:10.099 --> 00:27:13.859
IN that it involved a lot of different kinds

375
00:27:13.859 --> 00:27:17.030
of concerns and processes of the kind you just

376
00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:22.239
described. Um, uh, SOME people were interested in plasticity,

377
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.439
and some people were interested in behavior, some people

378
00:27:25.439 --> 00:27:29.680
were interested in, uh, these developmental processes and say

379
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.670
the physical dynamics. And while it's true that each

380
00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:37.000
of them in a way puts some pressure on

381
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.290
the traditional view, they don't necessarily comprise a coherent

382
00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:46.260
alternative. And so I think that uh what we

383
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.140
now see is a little bit more of a

384
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:54.979
kind of. Wild west open space because we have

385
00:27:54.979 --> 00:27:57.890
an awareness that the old picture is not fully

386
00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:03.180
satisfactory, but we don't have a consensus view of

387
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.839
a new picture. And so what we then have

388
00:28:06.839 --> 00:28:11.030
is a kind of uh um. Uh, OPEN, you

389
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:15.349
know, space with some pretty severe theoretical differences. Um,

390
00:28:15.469 --> 00:28:17.869
BUT the bottom line is that the extended evolutionary

391
00:28:17.869 --> 00:28:23.109
synthesis itself didn't cohere is that alternative picture. And

392
00:28:23.109 --> 00:28:26.109
so I think that we're still a ways off

393
00:28:26.109 --> 00:28:31.500
from seeing The community kind of come together around

394
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.660
a particular sort of set of theoretical commitments, kind

395
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.300
of like we saw in the mid-twentieth century with

396
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.579
the modern synthesis.

397
00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:45.560
Is there any room at all here for organisms

398
00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.280
to be able to direct their own evolution in

399
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:49.839
any way?

400
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:54.160
So that's certainly a part of the claims that

401
00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.000
have been made, especially on behalf of niche construction

402
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.880
theory, where the idea is that organisms are, by

403
00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:09.319
their behavior, reshaping their environment, as a consequence, they're

404
00:29:09.319 --> 00:29:15.390
changing the selective pressures that affect their evolution, uh,

405
00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.239
in the sense of the populations through time. I

406
00:29:19.239 --> 00:29:24.160
think that those possibilities um are uh difficult to

407
00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.280
cash out because in traditional modeling, you can capture

408
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.479
those effects as uh uh simply features of the

409
00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:36.439
environment, and so you see some of this discussion

410
00:29:36.439 --> 00:29:40.599
going on. About whether niche construction is just another

411
00:29:41.239 --> 00:29:45.939
perspective on what has already been said. Among evolutionary

412
00:29:45.939 --> 00:29:50.619
biologists. But I do think that, uh, in recent

413
00:29:50.619 --> 00:29:56.260
years, there's been increased appreciation of how much animal

414
00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:01.780
behavior, um, and more broadly, any organismal behavior. Can

415
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:07.579
make a tremendous difference on the environmental circumstances that

416
00:30:07.579 --> 00:30:11.979
make up uh the uh natural selection pressures that

417
00:30:11.979 --> 00:30:18.000
are experienced and therefore, it seems, uh, Somewhat maybe.

418
00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:24.030
CLEAR that there is uh a number of pathways

419
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:28.300
for behavior from organisms to make a difference. Um,

420
00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:34.310
HOWEVER, exactly how and why seems like it remains

421
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.829
a uh subject of contention.

422
00:30:38.339 --> 00:30:43.000
So tell us now about evolvability. You mentioned it

423
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.469
earlier, uh, you mentioned it a little bit earlier,

424
00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:50.079
but tell us more about it. What is evolvability?

425
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:56.369
So evolvability at a sort of very basic level

426
00:30:56.369 --> 00:30:59.329
is simply the capacity to evolve. So if we

427
00:30:59.329 --> 00:31:04.930
say that a population um exhibits evolvability, we're saying

428
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:09.680
that the population uh exhibits variation that allows it

429
00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:15.410
to respond to selective pressures, um, uh, should those

430
00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:22.030
happen. However, What becomes really interesting about evolvability is

431
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:26.060
paying attention to sort of how it shows up.

432
00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:30.270
That is, are we thinking about evolvability for a

433
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:34.589
particular trait? Are we thinking about evolvability for a

434
00:31:34.589 --> 00:31:39.939
particular body plan? Are we thinking about evolvability for

435
00:31:40.109 --> 00:31:45.739
um say cells, uh, and their sort of capacities

436
00:31:45.739 --> 00:31:49.000
at lower levels of organization. So once you start

437
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.670
thinking about what is being attributed to evolvability. It

438
00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:58.949
starts to become very interesting very fast. So many

439
00:31:58.949 --> 00:32:04.030
people have gotten interested in how, um, especially developing

440
00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:08.650
systems can be evolvable because they can have properties

441
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:13.750
that allow them to uh be responsive to different

442
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:18.510
kinds of environmental changes, um, and people have gotten

443
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:23.234
really interested in. The, uh, capacity for evolvability of

444
00:32:23.234 --> 00:32:27.185
particular traits, because it seems like some traits, uh,

445
00:32:27.194 --> 00:32:33.035
are more malleable, um, and subject to evolutionary change

446
00:32:33.035 --> 00:32:36.755
than others, and so, uh, trying to understand what

447
00:32:36.755 --> 00:32:39.834
are the, the genetic basis, uh, what's the genetic

448
00:32:39.834 --> 00:32:44.699
basis for that. What's the relationship between the, um,

449
00:32:44.849 --> 00:32:48.619
the genotype and the phenotype that would make something

450
00:32:48.969 --> 00:32:54.170
more evolvable or less evolvable, um, but generally, like

451
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:58.920
I said before, evolvability sort of shifts the emphasis

452
00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:06.329
from Constraints or limitations to facilitation and possibilities. And

453
00:33:06.329 --> 00:33:10.209
so researchers are often interested in evolvability because they're

454
00:33:10.209 --> 00:33:13.569
interested in trying to understand how can evolutionary change

455
00:33:13.569 --> 00:33:20.579
be facilitated and um uh sort of uh Encouraged

456
00:33:20.579 --> 00:33:23.900
in certain directions simply by virtue of the setup

457
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.290
of the system or the setup of the cell

458
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.260
or the setup of the population.

459
00:33:29.469 --> 00:33:32.319
And do we know which factors play a role

460
00:33:32.319 --> 00:33:38.400
in evolvability, which factors make particular organisms or particular

461
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.510
traits more or less evolvable?

462
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:46.890
So it does seem like we have some insights

463
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:51.829
into um uh some of those features. Um, FOR

464
00:33:51.829 --> 00:33:57.550
example, it appears that organisms that are sort of

465
00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:02.300
more modular, that is, they have sort of more

466
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:08.070
independent parts. Uh, TEND to have a, uh, higher

467
00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:12.030
degree of evolvability because those parts then seem to

468
00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:17.389
be changeable independently of one another over evolutionary time.

469
00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:21.500
As an in an organism that is sort of

470
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.379
overly integrated, that is all the parts are tightly

471
00:34:25.379 --> 00:34:29.810
connected together, is going to be less evolvable, um,

472
00:34:29.899 --> 00:34:34.168
and so the oftentimes more modular parts, um, you

473
00:34:34.168 --> 00:34:37.489
tend to see that. This is especially visible in

474
00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:41.020
arthropods, who have many segments, and there are many

475
00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:47.219
segments are subject to modifications, including um different kinds

476
00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:52.500
of appendages, duplications of the number of segments, um.

477
00:34:53.339 --> 00:34:58.019
Uh, SPECIALIZATIONS of those segments and all kinds of

478
00:34:58.019 --> 00:35:02.648
patterns seem to be encouraged by having those sorts

479
00:35:02.648 --> 00:35:07.579
of modular parts. Um, SO those sorts of patterns

480
00:35:07.579 --> 00:35:11.218
do seem like we can detect that, um, they

481
00:35:11.218 --> 00:35:15.618
have an evolutionary significance. At the same time, we're

482
00:35:15.618 --> 00:35:19.938
still trying to understand other things that seem to

483
00:35:19.938 --> 00:35:25.050
underlie evolvability, especially. Um, ON longer time scales, to

484
00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:28.610
what degree, um, especially does a certain kind of

485
00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:33.969
genetic architecture for traits make a difference, um, especially

486
00:35:33.969 --> 00:35:38.409
over, uh, transitions from short term to long term

487
00:35:38.409 --> 00:35:40.959
time scales, because much of what we can study

488
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.284
is on shorter time. Time scales in terms of

489
00:35:43.284 --> 00:35:47.564
experimental interventions, but oftentimes for evolutionary patterns we're interested

490
00:35:47.564 --> 00:35:50.485
in these longer time scales, and the question is

491
00:35:50.485 --> 00:35:52.854
to what degree do the things we detect on

492
00:35:52.854 --> 00:35:55.764
the shorter time scales hold or make a difference

493
00:35:55.764 --> 00:35:58.554
on the longer time scales, and those things are,

494
00:35:58.804 --> 00:36:01.675
you know, hard to determine, but we're making progress.

495
00:36:02.669 --> 00:36:07.010
And how is evolve evolvability studied?

496
00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:11.590
So evolvability is studied uh in a kind of

497
00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:15.429
evo diva way with many approaches. So you can

498
00:36:15.429 --> 00:36:21.149
study evolvability using uh resources from quantitative genetics, you

499
00:36:21.149 --> 00:36:26.189
can study evolvability using resources from developmental biology, you

500
00:36:26.189 --> 00:36:31.270
can study evolvability using resources from paleontology. And sort

501
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:36.310
of the fossil record. So evolvability is really something

502
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:40.709
that can be studied by many different disciplines and

503
00:36:40.709 --> 00:36:44.439
is naturally one of the uh places where Evodevo

504
00:36:44.439 --> 00:36:47.469
researchers have been most interested. In fact, some people

505
00:36:47.469 --> 00:36:52.510
have even claimed that evolvability is the sort of

506
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:58.020
central defining concept for Evodevo because it Gives an

507
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:02.340
identity to the community for bringing together all these

508
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.649
different methods and approaches um in the first place.

509
00:37:07.129 --> 00:37:11.459
And so let me ask you now about evolutionary

510
00:37:11.459 --> 00:37:13.429
novelties. What are they?

511
00:37:14.409 --> 00:37:20.590
So, evolutionary novelties um are sort of typically thought

512
00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:24.750
to be those new features that emerge in the

513
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:28.659
history of life that weren't previously there. So, uh,

514
00:37:28.669 --> 00:37:33.580
at one point in history, there were no jaws

515
00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:38.959
on, um, vertebrate organisms. And so at some point

516
00:37:38.959 --> 00:37:41.850
you get the evolution of jaws. It likely took

517
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:44.959
place over a long period of time, but the

518
00:37:44.959 --> 00:37:48.959
evolutionary novelty, the jaws themselves become a subject of

519
00:37:48.959 --> 00:37:52.879
study. How did those originate? What, what made it

520
00:37:52.879 --> 00:37:57.199
possible for these to occur? And part of why

521
00:37:57.199 --> 00:38:01.780
we're interested in is, is exactly. Because so many

522
00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.780
taxa now have jaws, right? So it's like once

523
00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:09.250
this evolved, it became a regular feature of organisms,

524
00:38:09.459 --> 00:38:14.780
um, uh, eyes would be another example, or lungs

525
00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.659
or sort of these major features people, you know,

526
00:38:17.739 --> 00:38:19.580
wanna know. Well, how did that originate in the

527
00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:23.590
first place? Where did it come from? So, uh,

528
00:38:23.939 --> 00:38:26.870
one of the things that Ivo Devo has also

529
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:31.709
been very focused on is evolutionary novelties because it

530
00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:36.580
seems like we do need to understand developmental processes

531
00:38:36.909 --> 00:38:42.510
that could have been relevant to those origination events

532
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:48.070
um in the past. So, an evolutionary novelty is

533
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.590
uh gonna be defined as a sort of new

534
00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:56.330
feature um within the history of uh life that

535
00:38:56.330 --> 00:39:00.800
doesn't seem to have a sort of comparable, uh,

536
00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:05.225
homologue, um, somewhere in the past. That is, we

537
00:39:05.225 --> 00:39:10.625
don't think, oh, jaws were sort of transformed from

538
00:39:10.625 --> 00:39:14.304
something that was already jaw-like. We're thinking that jaws

539
00:39:14.304 --> 00:39:18.504
emerged um in this sort of interesting way such

540
00:39:18.504 --> 00:39:21.959
that they took on a separate identity. That was

541
00:39:21.959 --> 00:39:27.889
really distinct from what whatever was present beforehand. Um,

542
00:39:28.159 --> 00:39:30.360
BUT as you can probably tell, that's what makes

543
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.070
it so hard. It's a really difficult problem to

544
00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:37.070
figure out, you know, how did you get, uh,

545
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.280
uh, this new feature, given that, uh, it didn't

546
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.250
exist previously uh in the lineage.

547
00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.810
Uh, AND do we have a good understanding or

548
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:55.719
any understanding, understanding of how evolutionary novelties are generated,

549
00:39:55.729 --> 00:39:58.409
and I guess that this would tie to some

550
00:39:58.409 --> 00:40:01.320
of the topics we've already explored there,

551
00:40:01.489 --> 00:40:05.334
right. So, I would say, um, it depends. A

552
00:40:05.334 --> 00:40:08.925
little bit on who you ask, but I do

553
00:40:08.925 --> 00:40:13.844
think that we have made tremendous gains in our

554
00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:18.254
understanding of the origin of evolutionary novelties because we

555
00:40:18.254 --> 00:40:23.215
have been able to study developmental processes at a

556
00:40:23.215 --> 00:40:28.379
much Deeper mechanistic level than was possible um 50

557
00:40:28.379 --> 00:40:31.020
to 75 years ago. And so I think we

558
00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:36.449
do have good insights now into particular developmental changes

559
00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:41.590
that were relevant for the origin of new features,

560
00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:46.959
whether they're jaws or uh something else, and Those

561
00:40:46.959 --> 00:40:50.679
are things that clearly will continue to be studied.

562
00:40:50.719 --> 00:40:53.479
It's not like they're studied and we finished and

563
00:40:53.479 --> 00:40:55.959
we go home, but rather that we've, you know,

564
00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:01.719
made good leaps and strides in recognizing that this

565
00:41:01.719 --> 00:41:08.780
developmental, uh, um, aspect of the organism. Can be

566
00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.739
changed in such a way as to generate something

567
00:41:11.739 --> 00:41:17.530
new, um, and that's a sort of achievement scientifically

568
00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:22.120
to have understood that. At the same time, I

569
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:28.760
think precisely because um many evolutionary novelties um are

570
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:33.610
distinctive in their sort of features. It makes it

571
00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:37.750
harder to always understand whether when we learn something

572
00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:41.459
about one evolutionary novelty, how much does that tell

573
00:41:41.459 --> 00:41:44.679
us about another one. So if we learn something

574
00:41:44.679 --> 00:41:47.969
about the origin of Jaws. Does that tell us

575
00:41:47.969 --> 00:41:52.739
something important about, say, the origin of other features

576
00:41:52.739 --> 00:41:55.979
that we're interested in? And sometimes the answer seems

577
00:41:55.979 --> 00:41:58.219
to be yes, and sometimes the answer seems to

578
00:41:58.219 --> 00:42:03.290
be no, um, and so the generalization potential for

579
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.500
some of the studies of evolutionary novelties is one

580
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.520
of its persistent challenges.

581
00:42:10.649 --> 00:42:16.330
Do evolutionary novelties link in any way to evolvability?

582
00:42:16.449 --> 00:42:21.659
That is, if a particular organism is more evolvable

583
00:42:21.659 --> 00:42:28.050
than another, is it capable of generating more evolutionary

584
00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:32.540
novelties or evolutionary novelties more easily?

585
00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.500
Uh, SO, the answer is yes, and it goes

586
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:41.209
in both directions. So, an organism, uh, or a

587
00:42:41.209 --> 00:42:45.739
population of organisms that exhibits evolvability with respect to

588
00:42:45.739 --> 00:42:50.820
certain features is in many ways more likely to

589
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:55.389
generate evolutionary novelties because of that capacity. At the

590
00:42:55.389 --> 00:42:57.959
same time, and the origin of a of a

591
00:42:57.959 --> 00:43:04.100
of an evolutionary novelty can actually contribute to evolvability

592
00:43:04.429 --> 00:43:07.830
and make it possible for more evolutionary change to

593
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:11.820
take place. Um, AND again, the origin of Jaws

594
00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:15.030
is, uh, a kind of nice example of that

595
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:19.590
because once you have the basic, uh, setup of

596
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:23.435
Jaws, now we can sort of See what possible

597
00:43:23.435 --> 00:43:28.425
evolution can happen once you have jaws, and jaws

598
00:43:28.425 --> 00:43:32.364
are quite modifiable in lots of different ways to

599
00:43:32.364 --> 00:43:35.625
support lots of different organisms living in lots of

600
00:43:35.625 --> 00:43:40.179
different ways on land, sea, and air. Um, SO

601
00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:45.050
I think there's a nice kind of interconnection between

602
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:49.459
evolvability and evolutionary novelty such that if we study

603
00:43:49.459 --> 00:43:55.830
evolutionary novelties, we can understand how uh lineages become

604
00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:59.350
more evolvable, but also if we study evolvability, we

605
00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:03.189
can understand why some lineages generate evolutionary novelties.

606
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:07.709
So in regards to evolutionary novelties in your work,

607
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:12.199
I read about stress mechanisms and, I mean, perhaps

608
00:44:12.199 --> 00:44:15.479
you would have uh an other examples, but what

609
00:44:15.479 --> 00:44:19.409
are stress mechanisms and how do they contribute to

610
00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.080
evolutionary novelties?

611
00:44:22.149 --> 00:44:25.379
Yeah, so the work you're referring to was collaborative

612
00:44:25.379 --> 00:44:29.030
uh research that I did with the biologist, Gunter

613
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.750
Wagner, and, uh, one of the things that we

614
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:37.540
were interested in was The way in which um

615
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:43.919
systems experience stresses um on a regular basis, um,

616
00:44:43.949 --> 00:44:48.389
whether that's, you know, temperature stresses or certain kinds

617
00:44:48.389 --> 00:44:53.510
of, uh, physiological stress due to um life history

618
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:58.139
stages like pregnancy. And whether or not these sorts

619
00:44:58.139 --> 00:45:01.659
of things might be relevant for evolution, and especially

620
00:45:01.659 --> 00:45:06.139
the origin of novelties. So what we were interested

621
00:45:06.139 --> 00:45:09.899
in was You know, to what degree that might

622
00:45:09.899 --> 00:45:11.919
be the case, and part of the reason why

623
00:45:11.919 --> 00:45:15.979
we were interested was because there were patterns across

624
00:45:16.679 --> 00:45:21.270
the tree of life. That seemed to suggest that

625
00:45:21.679 --> 00:45:26.919
stress mechanisms, so the kinds of uh mechanisms that

626
00:45:26.919 --> 00:45:31.399
are associated with stress responses, seem to also be

627
00:45:31.399 --> 00:45:37.320
deeply woven into normal developmental processes. So why would

628
00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:41.520
it be the case that those stress mechanism features

629
00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:47.030
seem like they get incorporated into regular development? And

630
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:51.179
so we put forward uh the basic idea that

631
00:45:51.389 --> 00:45:55.600
uh there is a way for stress to be

632
00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:02.399
generative of new features. Through a process uh that

633
00:46:02.399 --> 00:46:05.360
uh uh we described in a couple of papers,

634
00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:10.250
um, that goes through multiple steps where first a

635
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:15.229
stress uh response occurs in, in relation to a

636
00:46:15.229 --> 00:46:18.689
regular stressor, and then what happens is that the

637
00:46:18.689 --> 00:46:23.939
organism starts to anticipate. That stress and in that

638
00:46:23.939 --> 00:46:27.870
anticipation of the stress, uh, you can get the

639
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:31.219
establishment of a new feature like a new cell

640
00:46:31.219 --> 00:46:36.149
type that actually protects against the stress and therefore

641
00:46:36.149 --> 00:46:41.199
by you get new features. Through a kind of

642
00:46:41.199 --> 00:46:44.840
response to stress over time and the organism's physiology,

643
00:46:44.879 --> 00:46:47.679
which would also account for why you get this

644
00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:51.639
signature of the stress mechanisms being involved, because they

645
00:46:51.639 --> 00:46:56.735
were originally involved and they've been co-opted in. To

646
00:46:56.735 --> 00:47:00.185
the new feature, so that it can uh sort

647
00:47:00.185 --> 00:47:03.225
of be a regular protector. Uh, SO there's a

648
00:47:03.225 --> 00:47:06.094
number of cases that we described in the paper,

649
00:47:06.344 --> 00:47:09.475
uh, some of which were in Gunter's, uh, work

650
00:47:09.475 --> 00:47:14.560
on the uh origins of mammalian pregnancy. Specifically looking

651
00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.199
at a stress, uh, what seemed to be a

652
00:47:17.199 --> 00:47:22.070
stress-induced, um, uh, evolution of a cell type, um,

653
00:47:22.159 --> 00:47:26.939
uh, that, uh, Seemed to be able to prevent

654
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:33.330
the fetus, uh, from causing inflammatory reactions in the,

655
00:47:33.429 --> 00:47:38.290
uh, uterus, um, of the, of the female, um,

656
00:47:38.379 --> 00:47:41.020
or, uh, you know, that was carrying the, the

657
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:44.179
fetus. And so, by looking at a number of

658
00:47:44.179 --> 00:47:46.770
those cases, it, it seemed to us that there

659
00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:51.540
was a relatively compelling case for looking more closely.

660
00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:56.659
At how, uh, this kind of stress induced, uh,

661
00:47:56.669 --> 00:48:02.139
responsiveness over evolutionary time might be specially uh related

662
00:48:02.139 --> 00:48:05.070
to the evolution of novelties. At the same time,

663
00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:07.889
we were not trying to say that somehow it

664
00:48:07.889 --> 00:48:12.110
was going to explain every novelty. It was rather

665
00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:15.600
that we thought it had been a neglected feature

666
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:19.209
in some of the studies of evolutionary novelty. Um,

667
00:48:19.219 --> 00:48:21.419
AND therefore we wanted to draw it to people's

668
00:48:21.419 --> 00:48:21.610
attention.

669
00:48:23.239 --> 00:48:27.120
Are there other kinds of mechanisms like these that

670
00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:32.090
might contribute also to uh evolutionary novelties?

671
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:36.570
So, a number of people have uh been very

672
00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:42.520
interested in how uh the physical dynamics of development

673
00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:47.250
might be uh pertinent for, uh, the generation of

674
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:51.479
evolutionary novelty. So, as I mentioned before, if you

675
00:48:51.479 --> 00:48:56.320
think about development as having, uh, say qualitative thresholds,

676
00:48:56.610 --> 00:49:00.010
um, uh, whereby you switch from one state to

677
00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:03.739
another, and that switch from one state to another

678
00:49:04.129 --> 00:49:08.610
is a function of certain kinds of physical dynamics,

679
00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:12.489
then some people have argued, um, Stuart Newman is

680
00:49:12.489 --> 00:49:16.409
probably the most prominent one. Um, THAT, uh, you

681
00:49:16.409 --> 00:49:21.510
can actually get new features through, uh, physical dynamic

682
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:26.239
changes happening during development, um, and that might have

683
00:49:26.239 --> 00:49:32.040
been, uh, more present earlier in evolutionary history, um,

684
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.560
uh, rather than as much as it is today.

685
00:49:34.689 --> 00:49:35.929
So there might have been a way in which

686
00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:38.929
it occurred longer ago and Uh, set up some

687
00:49:38.929 --> 00:49:43.010
of the, uh, landscape of animal, uh, morphologies that

688
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.790
we see today. So I think that Whether it's

689
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:50.389
physical dynamics or stress mechanisms, um, I think a

690
00:49:50.389 --> 00:49:54.830
lot of people are interested in, uh, putting forward

691
00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:58.350
different kinds of models to understand. Like how is

692
00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:01.229
it that we can get new features, and in

693
00:50:01.229 --> 00:50:03.750
many ways, a lot of these models are not

694
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:07.219
competing directly with each other, uh, but in fact,

695
00:50:07.459 --> 00:50:12.419
uh, can uh be complementary in our understanding of

696
00:50:12.629 --> 00:50:15.669
the complex ways in which new features originate during

697
00:50:15.669 --> 00:50:16.389
evolution.

698
00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.709
OK, so I have one last question for you

699
00:50:20.709 --> 00:50:23.629
then. And going all the way back to the

700
00:50:23.629 --> 00:50:27.030
beginning of our conversation, um, how do you look

701
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:31.830
at the future of developmental biology and the role

702
00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:36.870
that it might play in our understanding of how

703
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:38.870
evolution occurs?

704
00:50:39.899 --> 00:50:42.199
So that's a big question to end on, but

705
00:50:42.199 --> 00:50:46.080
a good one. I think that, uh, a couple

706
00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:51.030
things seem relevant. So, you know, as a philosopher,

707
00:50:51.399 --> 00:50:53.679
one of my main interests and all of the

708
00:50:53.679 --> 00:50:57.590
things we've been talking about is sort of how

709
00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:04.639
the scientists Proceed to reason and think and practice

710
00:51:04.639 --> 00:51:09.000
what they do to make progress on these uh

711
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.939
questions. And I think that what we have seen,

712
00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:17.709
uh, especially over the last, uh, decade or so

713
00:51:17.709 --> 00:51:22.560
is that, um, there has been an increased willingness

714
00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:29.120
among many researchers in different disciplines to collaborate um

715
00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:34.199
in this interdisciplinary fashion that Ivodevo, uh, in particular

716
00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:41.010
seems to, uh, nurture. So, I think that, uh,

717
00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.820
you know, going forward, one of the most important

718
00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:47.219
things will be the degree to which these kinds

719
00:51:47.219 --> 00:51:53.530
of collaborations, um, uh, are sort of supported by

720
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:58.379
funding agencies, um, because sometimes funding agencies can be

721
00:51:58.379 --> 00:52:01.659
a little bit more conservative in what they fund

722
00:52:01.659 --> 00:52:05.260
because interdisciplinary projects are a little bit more risky.

723
00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.149
They're a little bit less clear on uh what

724
00:52:09.149 --> 00:52:12.120
they will generate, but I think that uh what

725
00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:15.949
we've seen is that when they are pursued well,

726
00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:20.800
um they really produce very interesting results. So I

727
00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.120
would say that My hope and I think to

728
00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:28.199
some degree expectation. Um, FOR, say, the next 10

729
00:52:28.199 --> 00:52:34.870
years is to see continued interdisciplinary interactions, including, uh,

730
00:52:34.879 --> 00:52:40.280
with, uh, theoreticians and, uh, even a few philosophers

731
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:44.570
to try and really think through the complex problem

732
00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:50.979
spaces that biologists are exploring by looking at evolvability,

733
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:56.530
evolutionary novelty, and the relationship between development. And evolution

734
00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:57.570
more broadly.

735
00:52:58.889 --> 00:53:02.370
And do you expect that even if not through

736
00:53:02.699 --> 00:53:06.860
uh a sort of extended evolutionary synthesis that at

737
00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:11.209
least in the future we would have a much

738
00:53:11.209 --> 00:53:17.489
richer and complex understanding of how evolution plays out

739
00:53:17.489 --> 00:53:20.419
through developmental processes.

740
00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:24.830
Absolutely, and I think that's what we are already

741
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:29.270
seeing. I think that even if the extended evolutionary

742
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:33.699
synthesis as a sort of movement. Uh, SORT of

743
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.100
falls by the wayside. I think what won't disappear

744
00:53:38.429 --> 00:53:43.469
are the genuine empirical and theoretical achievements that have

745
00:53:43.469 --> 00:53:48.469
been accomplished by researchers, um, in recent decades, and

746
00:53:48.469 --> 00:53:51.979
that will likely, you know, take some form. As

747
00:53:51.979 --> 00:53:55.260
it's presented in textbooks to the next generation of

748
00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:58.760
scientists, uh, but the bottom line is that that

749
00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:03.250
next generation of scientists is gonna get a much

750
00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:07.199
richer and more complex starting picture of the evolutionary

751
00:54:07.199 --> 00:54:10.340
process than you or I had when we started

752
00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:10.770
out.

753
00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:15.310
Great, so Doctor Love, before we go, would you

754
00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:17.989
like to tell people where they can find you

755
00:54:17.989 --> 00:54:19.709
and your work on the Internet?

756
00:54:20.899 --> 00:54:24.500
So you can find my work at my homepage,

757
00:54:24.709 --> 00:54:28.350
um, which if you do a basic, uh, browser

758
00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:30.840
search in Google or something else on Alan Love,

759
00:54:30.939 --> 00:54:34.919
philosopher, you'll be able to find my page, um,

760
00:54:34.949 --> 00:54:38.750
and, uh, I'm also happy to interact with anyone

761
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:42.459
who has further questions about my work or, um,

762
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:46.590
uh, potentially needs access to a reprint or something

763
00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:49.649
like that. Uh, YOU can uh just email me
