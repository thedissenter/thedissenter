00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.430
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.289
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loop and

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.390
the MG by Dr JD Gs. She's an assistant

4
00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:12.409
professor of Anthropology at the University of Washington in

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.680
Seattle. Dr Gebb is an environmental archaeologist and ethno

6
00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:21.709
biologist who employs an interdisciplinary research program to understand

7
00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:26.350
how humans adapted their foraging practices and agricultural strategies

8
00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:30.264
to new environments and have developed resilience in the

9
00:00:30.274 --> 00:00:33.724
face of climatic and social change. And today we're

10
00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:37.784
going to talk about foraging and the agricultural practices

11
00:00:37.794 --> 00:00:43.715
of humans, paleo ethnobotany, the Tibetan plateau, the development

12
00:00:43.724 --> 00:00:47.654
and spread of agriculture, the development of states, climate

13
00:00:47.665 --> 00:00:50.584
change and some other related topics. So, Doctor Gatz,

14
00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:52.744
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

15
00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:54.979
Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here. And

16
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.729
also thank you for being the only person who's

17
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.959
ever pronounced my name correctly because we're both Portuguese.

18
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.650
I mean, if I didn't do it, it would

19
00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:09.839
have been a shame for me anyway. OK. So

20
00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:12.489
to start off with, uh tell us perhaps a

21
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.680
little bit about the kinds of places you have

22
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.550
done work on when it comes to studying, perhaps

23
00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:24.959
the foraging and agricultural practices of humans.

24
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.650
Yeah, absolutely. So, um my work is primarily focused

25
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.410
in Asia. Um So I've worked um in two

26
00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:35.889
places. So um I, you know, I consider myself

27
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.470
an archaeologist of ancient China and the Tibetan plateau.

28
00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:42.410
So I work primarily in the People's Republic of

29
00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:45.860
China. Um AND the region of China that I

30
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.544
work in um is Southwest China. Um So this

31
00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:54.125
is the provinces of um of the Chinese provinces

32
00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:58.775
of Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou. Um But more specifically,

33
00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.805
um one of my key focus research areas has

34
00:02:01.815 --> 00:02:04.014
been the Tibetan plateau. So I actually did an

35
00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:06.705
undergraduate degree in Tibetan and Himalayan studies, that was

36
00:02:06.714 --> 00:02:09.788
the first degree that I did. Um And so

37
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.520
the Tibetan plateau sort of always been a focus

38
00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.360
of my research. And then um throughout my phd,

39
00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.869
I actually shifted my focus to the Chengdu plain,

40
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.710
which is the slow lying plane in Sichuan Province.

41
00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.949
But then following my phd moved back to doing

42
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.000
research on the Tibetan plateau and that's where my

43
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.610
current fieldwork project is in a National Park on

44
00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:29.289
the eastern Tibetan plateau. Um And we sort of

45
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.070
the bulk of my research has been focused um

46
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.220
and just finished writing a book on the archaeology

47
00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.440
of the Tibetan plateau. So, yeah,

48
00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:41.940
a and why these particular places specifically, I mean,

49
00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:47.949
is there any specific reason scientifically speaking for why

50
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.559
these places would be good places to really study

51
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.410
the the particular kinds of questions you're interested in

52
00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.839
or is it just some uh something that is,

53
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.970
that was more accidental, let's say that you got

54
00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.330
interested in those specific places.

55
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.589
So, so in terms of my own research, um

56
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.639
well, so, so I'll sort of answer broadly like

57
00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:12.729
from the scientific perspective. So, you know, the Tibetan

58
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.509
plateau is a really interesting place to study the

59
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.130
impacts of climate change. Um BECAUSE the Tibetan plateau,

60
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.949
so, so areas of like high latitude and high

61
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.759
altitude experience the impacts of global warming with a

62
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.979
higher amplitude than places of low latitude and low

63
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.110
altitude. And so, you know, if you look at

64
00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:36.059
the numbers, the Tibetan plateau is warming at the

65
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.419
rate of roughly double the global average. Um SO,

66
00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:42.229
so, so, so it's a place that is currently,

67
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.179
you know, experiencing some of the biggest impacts of

68
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.529
climate change around the world. But this has also

69
00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.910
been true historically. So whenever there are changes in

70
00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.779
climate in the past, um the Tibetan plateau experienced

71
00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:56.910
those changes more just because things happen with a

72
00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.910
higher amplitude there. So it's a very interesting place

73
00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.860
to study the impacts of climate change. Personally, for

74
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:06.419
me, it was actually um kind of by accident,

75
00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:09.190
I I started off with a undergraduate degree in

76
00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.020
Tibetan and Himalayan studies. And you know, most of

77
00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:15.419
the way that those degrees are sort of oriented

78
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:18.559
is really, you know, very heavily focused on the

79
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.529
historic period in Tibetan, which is very closely intertwined

80
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.220
with the history and spread of Buddhism. Um So,

81
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.510
you know, I feel like I spent a lot

82
00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:28.549
of that undergraduate degree, you know, learning how to

83
00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:31.459
read Tibetan Buddhist texts and sort of realized that,

84
00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:34.000
you know, my, my, I mean, while it was

85
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.859
very interesting and I have the greatest appreciation for

86
00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:40.660
Buddhism and it's wonderful philosophy, um you know, and

87
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.119
certainly try to integrate that into my life on

88
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.690
a personal level. Iii I realized that like, my

89
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.510
academic interest was not in studying Buddhist text. And

90
00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:55.350
I became interested in um some of the older

91
00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:59.333
religions of Tibet, namely Bon, um which is uh

92
00:04:59.352 --> 00:05:00.683
you know, which is just like a kind of

93
00:05:00.692 --> 00:05:02.983
blanket term for sort of describing everything that was

94
00:05:02.993 --> 00:05:05.322
present into that prior to the arrival of Buddhism.

95
00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:08.143
And then sort of through that I became interested

96
00:05:08.153 --> 00:05:11.863
in, in. Well, what was the early history of

97
00:05:11.872 --> 00:05:14.863
this very fascinating place that ended up forming an

98
00:05:14.872 --> 00:05:18.592
empire and realized that we actually know practically nothing

99
00:05:18.602 --> 00:05:20.933
about it. And then that's how I became interested

100
00:05:20.942 --> 00:05:22.985
in the, the theology of the Tibetan plateau because

101
00:05:22.996 --> 00:05:25.925
I was like, wow, there's really this massive gap

102
00:05:25.936 --> 00:05:27.555
in terms of our knowledge and that we only

103
00:05:27.566 --> 00:05:31.115
really start, you know, understanding what's happening on the

104
00:05:31.126 --> 00:05:33.876
Tibetan plateau, maybe around the earliest, the fifth or

105
00:05:33.885 --> 00:05:36.205
sixth, but really, you know, sort of after the

106
00:05:36.216 --> 00:05:38.885
sixth century ad but everything prior to that, we

107
00:05:38.895 --> 00:05:41.015
know nothing about that. But yet archaeology has the

108
00:05:41.026 --> 00:05:42.816
answer. So that was actually what led me to

109
00:05:42.996 --> 00:05:45.466
become an archaeologist in the first place was that

110
00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:48.286
kind of realization that while there's like a lot

111
00:05:48.295 --> 00:05:52.149
of room to um to expand our knowledge here?

112
00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:55.519
Great. So, but when it comes to the history

113
00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:58.980
of humans in the Tibetan plateau, does it include

114
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.510
also foraging activities or have you focused mostly on

115
00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:06.109
agricultural practices?

116
00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:09.579
Um So I've also focused on foragers too. Um

117
00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:12.339
And, and the reason is really that the Tibetan

118
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.660
plateau is sort of in, in this part of

119
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.390
Asia, this is one of the places that at

120
00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:21.700
least, in my opinion, foragers have had some of

121
00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:24.549
the longest history, they've been there for the longest

122
00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:29.579
period of time. Um And um you know, where,

123
00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:34.510
whereas agriculture spread and you know, replaced um forging

124
00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:38.179
lifestyles earlier on in other parts of Asia here,

125
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.170
you know, on the Tibetan plateau forages were there

126
00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:44.260
for a long time. And, and um and actually

127
00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:46.809
in some of one of the things that I've

128
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.579
argued is that they, they really resisted the spread

129
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:53.600
of farmers um for a very, very long period

130
00:06:53.609 --> 00:06:55.470
of time. And in fact, it's really not too

131
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.160
until the introduction of pastoral animals like sheep and

132
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.820
goat and then cattle to some extent, and the

133
00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:05.890
introduction of wheat and barley. So basically following the

134
00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:09.970
second millennium BC that I think that that people

135
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.609
started to truly move away from a foraging lifestyle.

136
00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:19.600
Um Uh And in my opinion, it is these

137
00:07:19.609 --> 00:07:22.970
foragers who were on the Tibetan plateau, these are

138
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.809
the ancestors of Tibetans today. Um That, that is

139
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.570
my opinion. I believe that there is direct continuity

140
00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:34.029
um between, you know, people who were once foragers

141
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.010
on the Tibetan plateau and Tibetans today. Um And

142
00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:39.450
that we can't really explain the peopling of the

143
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.540
Tibetan plateau through a simple replace, you know, demographic

144
00:07:42.549 --> 00:07:44.160
replacement hypothesis.

145
00:07:45.049 --> 00:07:48.380
So is then the Tibetan plateau, an area in

146
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.250
the globe where it's uh it's uh I mean,

147
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.420
it's a good place to study perhaps the transition

148
00:07:55.429 --> 00:08:01.290
from foraging into agriculture or perhaps the steps it

149
00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:04.869
took for people to, to really adopt agriculture as

150
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.790
the basis of their food economy.

151
00:08:08.609 --> 00:08:11.160
Yes. Yeah, I think it's a really fascinating um

152
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.220
place to study it and, you know, one of

153
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.549
the things. So, so I I'll sort of back

154
00:08:15.559 --> 00:08:18.750
up by saying that there, there's sort of two

155
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.010
kinds of spreads of farming uh onto the Tibetan

156
00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:26.390
plateau. So the first one has to do with

157
00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:29.119
um two crops that were domesticated in China, which

158
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.039
are broom, corn, and foxtail millet. Um So those

159
00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:38.049
two crops were domesticated in Northwest China or somewhere

160
00:08:38.058 --> 00:08:41.690
in northern China. And then um we see them

161
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.409
moving on to the margins of the eastern Tibetan

162
00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:49.599
plateau um around, you know, the fourth um millennium.

163
00:08:49.609 --> 00:08:52.530
Uh WAIT, sorry. Yeah, about the fourth sort of

164
00:08:52.539 --> 00:09:00.770
millennium BC. Um Now, now they, they move presumably

165
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.039
with people who are farmers along the very low

166
00:09:04.049 --> 00:09:07.590
altitude margins of the eastern Tibetan plateau. But then

167
00:09:07.599 --> 00:09:10.450
we also see these same crops appearing in areas

168
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.719
of higher altitude and there are very complicated things

169
00:09:13.729 --> 00:09:18.570
happen. So there's one archaeological site on the northeastern

170
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.320
Tibetan plateau called Z. And at Z, what we

171
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.950
start seeing happening is we actually see burials that

172
00:09:27.549 --> 00:09:30.710
appear to be associated with moving farmers who came

173
00:09:30.719 --> 00:09:33.109
to that site. And then we have burials that

174
00:09:33.119 --> 00:09:35.510
are in a very different style with totally different

175
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.309
types of pottery that are probably the forager burials.

176
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.450
And so we see actual like physical interaction between

177
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.659
these two people, these two different groups of people

178
00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:48.969
at this archaeological site and presumably the farmers brought

179
00:09:48.979 --> 00:09:50.885
this millet with them that we find at the

180
00:09:50.895 --> 00:09:53.614
same archaeological site. One of one of the very

181
00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:56.114
interesting analyses that me and some of my colleagues

182
00:09:56.125 --> 00:10:00.525
at Lanzhou University um carried out was we decided

183
00:10:00.534 --> 00:10:03.844
to look at the proportions of weeds um in

184
00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:06.924
that, in that assemblage from Zona. And what we

185
00:10:06.934 --> 00:10:10.344
found is that it was mostly clean grain showing

186
00:10:10.354 --> 00:10:14.690
up at the archaeological site, which means that farmers

187
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.400
were probably carrying the grain with them to the

188
00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:20.669
site. It wasn't being grown locally on site, otherwise

189
00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:22.979
we would have found the weeds. Um And then

190
00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:24.960
they were engaging in these, you know, patterns of

191
00:10:24.969 --> 00:10:27.400
exchange with these foragers like this was a trading

192
00:10:27.409 --> 00:10:29.929
place. So then if we move further south on

193
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.809
the Tibetan plateau to an area called Chandu in,

194
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.906
in, in Tibet. And there is this very famous

195
00:10:36.916 --> 00:10:39.745
site called Chengdu Kai rule, which is uh you

196
00:10:39.755 --> 00:10:42.255
know, one of the um it was always sort

197
00:10:42.265 --> 00:10:44.616
of hailed as like one of the earliest farming

198
00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:46.346
sites on the Tibetan plateau. And that's because we

199
00:10:46.356 --> 00:10:49.745
find milit at it. But there's really no evidence

200
00:10:49.755 --> 00:10:52.695
at that site for any type of direct exchange

201
00:10:52.786 --> 00:10:56.401
between these foragers um in high, you know, who

202
00:10:56.411 --> 00:10:59.471
live in this high altitude site and between farmers

203
00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:02.512
in lower elevations, the pottery is different, the technology

204
00:11:02.521 --> 00:11:04.771
is different. The only thing that's showing up are

205
00:11:04.781 --> 00:11:09.072
these millets. And it's possible that the foragers were

206
00:11:09.081 --> 00:11:11.721
locally cultivating them. It's also possible that they were

207
00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:14.721
exchanging them through these down the line trade and

208
00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:18.950
exchange agreements. So, you know, to me this, so,

209
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.429
you know, in archaeology, we tend to have, we,

210
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.280
we sort of tended to have this assumption that

211
00:11:23.289 --> 00:11:25.750
when you get grains showing up at an archaeological

212
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.859
site. Oh, that means that people were farming them.

213
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.250
So some of the things that I've argued in,

214
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.150
you know, in the particular context of the Tibetan

215
00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:34.390
plateau is no, it actually doesn't mean this people

216
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.489
can trade grains over large distances. And in fact,

217
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.349
that's what Tibetans do today. There are many Tibetans

218
00:11:40.359 --> 00:11:43.320
who are full time pastoralists and yet they have

219
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.200
barley in their houses that they're exchanging with other

220
00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:49.594
Tibetans who live in lower altitudes, motivating the barley,

221
00:11:49.664 --> 00:11:53.294
they exchange the barley for things like salt, hide,

222
00:11:53.304 --> 00:11:56.294
milk butter, you know, all of the products of

223
00:11:56.304 --> 00:11:59.255
pastoralism and sometimes even the products of hunting. And

224
00:11:59.405 --> 00:12:01.294
so I'd argue that, you know, this is really

225
00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:04.455
a ver a pattern that is, these patterns of

226
00:12:04.465 --> 00:12:06.994
exchange are something that have characterized the Tibetan plateau

227
00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:11.520
over very, very deep time. Um And they're, they're

228
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.520
not new and, you know, this is really just

229
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.739
a continuation of what people have been doing for

230
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.150
thousands of years. There are the patterns that we,

231
00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:19.099
that we see today.

232
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:25.080
So when it comes to the development and adoption

233
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.859
of agriculture, I guess that there are very interesting

234
00:12:27.869 --> 00:12:31.219
questions that I could ask you here because I

235
00:12:31.229 --> 00:12:35.169
mean, whenever, for example, I hear people, I mean,

236
00:12:35.179 --> 00:12:38.669
I'm not talking about scientists who actually do work

237
00:12:38.679 --> 00:12:42.469
on this, but just the general population talking about

238
00:12:42.489 --> 00:12:47.450
the adoption of agriculture and the agricultural revolution, so

239
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.419
to speak, people have these very common simplistic ideas

240
00:12:51.429 --> 00:12:55.330
that we were foragers up to the point. And

241
00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:00.150
then we, and then we, we found we found

242
00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:04.380
agriculture and then suddenly the next day we, we

243
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.229
just adopted agriculture and we went on from there.

244
00:13:08.239 --> 00:13:11.700
I mean, of course, people know that agriculture was

245
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.380
not developed in every single society across the globe.

246
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.619
At the same time, it's red across the globe.

247
00:13:18.729 --> 00:13:21.659
But anyway, the people left these very sort of

248
00:13:21.669 --> 00:13:25.760
simplistic ideas that it was one single event once

249
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.109
we found agriculture, then we went on from there

250
00:13:29.119 --> 00:13:33.440
and it was just agriculture onwards. Uh But, uh,

251
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.190
I mean, actually

252
00:13:35.619 --> 00:13:38.830
I can totally take that apart for you. Ok.

253
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.909
Ok. Ok. But just, just one last thing, actually,

254
00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:46.489
if I remember correctly from a conversations I had

255
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.570
with other people on the show, even the idea

256
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.700
that it was one single event is not right,

257
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:58.380
because there's lots of evidence that foragers perhaps learned

258
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.119
that they could farm certain crops. But they uh

259
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:06.530
I mean, sometimes they were farming them other times

260
00:14:06.539 --> 00:14:10.159
they dropped that and went on, went back to

261
00:14:10.169 --> 00:14:13.570
just foraging again. And uh I mean, many times

262
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.340
it was a mix of those kinds of activities,

263
00:14:17.359 --> 00:14:20.130
right? Yeah. And so, you know, so I'll just

264
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.219
address the last point quickly. So yes, that's exactly

265
00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:24.849
what we see on the Tibetan plateau. So one

266
00:14:24.859 --> 00:14:26.559
of the outcomes of my work was that due

267
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.219
to climate change, people could actually no longer cultivate

268
00:14:29.229 --> 00:14:30.989
these millets on the Tibetan plateau and we'll maybe

269
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.489
get back to that later. But, but these millets

270
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.549
fell out of cultivation and people just went back

271
00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:38.590
to foraging to what they were doing before. But

272
00:14:38.599 --> 00:14:41.599
to address your first point on the development of

273
00:14:41.609 --> 00:14:44.580
farming. So, you know, back um in the age

274
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.479
of Gordon child, who was an Australian archaeologist, kind

275
00:14:47.489 --> 00:14:48.690
of at the turn of the century, you know,

276
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.710
it was we described the origins of agriculture as

277
00:14:51.719 --> 00:14:55.320
the Neolithic revolution and I think today our understanding

278
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.450
of the process could not really be farther from

279
00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.840
that. Um I think that some of the most

280
00:14:59.849 --> 00:15:04.169
interesting ideas about how agriculture first came to, you

281
00:15:04.179 --> 00:15:07.580
know, how people first started farming is really, has

282
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:13.309
really been the recognition that people have always interfered

283
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.049
with. Um Yeah, and maybe interfered isn't the, isn't

284
00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:19.570
the right word, but people have always lived in

285
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.590
symbiosis with the plants and animals around them. And

286
00:15:23.599 --> 00:15:26.309
when you live in symbiosis with a plant or

287
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.320
with an animal, you have evolutionary impacts on each

288
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.859
other's lifestyle. They're evolutionary outcomes of that. So some

289
00:15:33.869 --> 00:15:37.510
of in my opinion, the most fascinating research about

290
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.895
the origins of agriculture has really focused on the

291
00:15:41.905 --> 00:15:46.614
nature of those symbiotic relationships. Um AND how small

292
00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:50.534
unintentional decisions that are made by humans as they're

293
00:15:50.544 --> 00:15:54.044
gathering plants or as their harvesting plants can lead

294
00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:56.825
to the emergence of traits that are associated with

295
00:15:56.835 --> 00:16:00.505
domestication. Um So, you know, one of the, you

296
00:16:00.515 --> 00:16:02.934
know, kind of most famous examples of this. Um

297
00:16:02.945 --> 00:16:05.215
AGAIN, drawing from Asia is probably the work of

298
00:16:05.224 --> 00:16:08.869
one of my colleagues, Dorian Fuller. Um And what

299
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.929
what Dorian you know demonstrated was that um that

300
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:19.270
that rice, rice and other grain crops as they

301
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.760
are becoming domesticated, start exhibiting a non shattering rus,

302
00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:27.700
right? Which is um the part that attaches the

303
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.489
grain to the rest of the plant and wild

304
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.909
plants when the crop ripens, when the grain ripens

305
00:16:34.039 --> 00:16:37.700
that automatically de hess so that it falls off

306
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:42.659
the plant. What starts to happen. Well, in, in

307
00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:45.700
all, in all populations, including wild populations, there's a

308
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.309
small percentage of a mutant that is the non

309
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:54.369
shattering racket. And as people are harvesting the crop,

310
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.330
they are unintentionally selecting for the ones that just

311
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.979
happen to remain stuck to the plant, which are

312
00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:04.290
the domestication trade mutants. And if you do that

313
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.650
over thousands of years, you start to, to select

314
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.680
for that mutant. Um And you, and it starts

315
00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:15.290
appearing in higher, higher and higher proportions and then

316
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.949
this leads to domestication. Um But now both the

317
00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:22.050
humans and the crops have entered this trap in

318
00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.910
which they rely on each other. The humans rely

319
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.250
on the crop for its grain and then the

320
00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.479
crop relies on its humans because it can't really

321
00:17:29.489 --> 00:17:34.650
spread itself without human intervention. Um So, so, so,

322
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.369
so that's for me, you know, one of the

323
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.930
most fascinating parts about some of this recent research

324
00:17:38.939 --> 00:17:40.949
on, you know, the origins of agriculture is that

325
00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:44.099
not only was this a very gradual process, but

326
00:17:44.109 --> 00:17:47.890
it's really, you know, we, I think that there,

327
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.609
there tends to be, you know, in our sort

328
00:17:50.619 --> 00:17:54.050
of in many of our social darwinist perspectives about

329
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.969
how things changed in human history. This idea that

330
00:17:58.609 --> 00:18:01.449
man is at the top of the heap, right?

331
00:18:01.459 --> 00:18:05.989
That we are, you know, the the primary um

332
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.369
inventors, we are the masters of nature, we are

333
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.630
the ones that change the course of history. And

334
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.109
yet when you really kind of get into the

335
00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:18.540
mechanics of how things like domestication happen. I think

336
00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.750
one of the things that we realize is that

337
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.050
actually we're not, we're just entangled with ecologies, we're

338
00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.750
entangled with plants, we're entangled with animals. And we

339
00:18:27.849 --> 00:18:31.790
are just a part of evolutionary processes and, and

340
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.160
a part of nature just like these other plants

341
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:38.079
and animals are. And what's happened throughout human history

342
00:18:38.089 --> 00:18:43.290
has just been the outcome of small unintentional actions

343
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.459
and symbiosis shaping each other. So for me, that's,

344
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:48.890
you know, I think one of the most fascinating

345
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.130
things about studying the origins of farming today is

346
00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.160
sort of kind of reassessing humans role in this

347
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.849
and coming to the realization that, you know, that

348
00:18:58.069 --> 00:19:00.949
that we aren't monsters of nature, we're part of

349
00:19:00.959 --> 00:19:02.780
nature. And I actually think that this is where

350
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.000
some of the most important lessons lie for our

351
00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.770
future, right? We, we tend to have this vision

352
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.609
that we can science our way out of anything

353
00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:15.900
or that we can invent solutions to the climate

354
00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.040
crisis that we're in or that we can invent

355
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.750
solutions for enough food. But I think that critical

356
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.260
to part of that picture is just really realizing

357
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.920
where we sit in nature and kind of taking

358
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.280
accountability for our role and for our impact. And

359
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.630
that's kind of maybe where some of the answers

360
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.319
lie if that makes sense. So I can get

361
00:19:35.329 --> 00:19:36.709
into some more of that later

362
00:19:39.709 --> 00:19:43.489
social darwinism, for example. And the basic idea that

363
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.569
we are masters of nature in instead of being

364
00:19:46.579 --> 00:19:49.719
part of nature and in the sort of symbiosis

365
00:19:49.729 --> 00:19:52.650
with it, uh uh associated with that, I guess

366
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:57.170
that we also have or add, even though that,

367
00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.400
that idea is still around. Unfortunately, at the idea

368
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:05.670
that uh of dividing, um, I mean, human societies

369
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.109
into the civilized ones and the sort of primitive

370
00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:13.650
ones as if people that lived in the primitive

371
00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:19.400
societies were not able to build civilizations if they

372
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.619
have the conditions for that. Of course, and I

373
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.390
guess that we're going to get a little bit

374
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.714
more into that into really the ecological and other

375
00:20:27.724 --> 00:20:31.755
kinds of factors that play a role into how

376
00:20:31.765 --> 00:20:36.834
and why societies move from a mostly foraging uh

377
00:20:36.844 --> 00:20:40.545
or, or uh societies mostly based on foraging to

378
00:20:40.555 --> 00:20:43.915
societies that are based in agriculture. And then of

379
00:20:43.925 --> 00:20:46.875
course, the rest that follows from that over time.

380
00:20:46.905 --> 00:20:46.935
Right.

381
00:20:47.805 --> 00:20:49.084
Yeah. And, and I mean, you know, one of

382
00:20:49.094 --> 00:20:50.655
the things I'd sort of argue about that is

383
00:20:50.665 --> 00:20:56.270
that, um people, you know, through thousands of years

384
00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.930
of symbiosis of living in the place that they

385
00:20:59.939 --> 00:21:06.709
live, people, people around the world have always found

386
00:21:06.719 --> 00:21:11.680
harmony with the harmony and the best way to

387
00:21:11.689 --> 00:21:14.229
live in the place that they live. Right. You

388
00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:15.859
know, and I'm sort of talking prior to the

389
00:21:15.869 --> 00:21:19.939
industrial revolution here. Right. Or prior to, you know,

390
00:21:19.949 --> 00:21:22.780
globalization, right? And the sort of forces that are

391
00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.910
that, you know, we encounter with globalization and colonialism.

392
00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:31.099
People, you know, people develop because their lives depend

393
00:21:31.109 --> 00:21:33.739
on it. People develop the adaptations that work the

394
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.949
best for them. And, and I think that that's,

395
00:21:36.959 --> 00:21:39.589
you know, one of the sort of social darwinistic

396
00:21:39.599 --> 00:21:41.150
thoughts that we really need to take apart is

397
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.439
this idea that, that there's kind of an end

398
00:21:43.449 --> 00:21:47.300
point or that there's one direction that things could

399
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.680
or should move in. Um, WHEN that's not the

400
00:21:49.689 --> 00:21:53.910
case, um It makes perfect sense for many people

401
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.069
around the world to have only relied on foraging

402
00:21:57.079 --> 00:22:00.709
or hunting. Um And there really was, you know,

403
00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:03.996
that was the solution, um, for the environment that

404
00:22:04.006 --> 00:22:07.166
they lived in and every place is different. Um

405
00:22:07.207 --> 00:22:10.916
And, and, and I think that, um, you know,

406
00:22:10.927 --> 00:22:14.347
part of the unfortunate thing around the world is

407
00:22:14.357 --> 00:22:17.036
that we've seen, um, you know, both with the

408
00:22:17.046 --> 00:22:22.416
expansion of colonial empires, um, and colonialism, you, you

409
00:22:22.427 --> 00:22:26.016
know, the, the, the, the, the idea that everyone

410
00:22:26.026 --> 00:22:28.896
should do the same thing or should aim for

411
00:22:28.906 --> 00:22:32.034
this one goal. Whereas we, we really should not,

412
00:22:32.043 --> 00:22:37.213
um, that's maladaptation actually, um, to, uh, to, to

413
00:22:37.223 --> 00:22:39.894
different environments. So, you know, well, we, we, we

414
00:22:39.904 --> 00:22:42.303
can talk more about this, um, as we kind

415
00:22:42.313 --> 00:22:46.053
of get into, um, into some specific examples. But,

416
00:22:46.063 --> 00:22:47.913
um, you know, and, and, you know, just to

417
00:22:47.923 --> 00:22:51.784
sort of speak to to that point. Um, YOU

418
00:22:51.793 --> 00:22:54.494
know, in, in, in, in many places, the divide

419
00:22:54.504 --> 00:22:57.663
is also just not that clear. So for instance,

420
00:22:57.673 --> 00:23:01.451
even just even Tibet, I mean, so Tibetans today

421
00:23:01.461 --> 00:23:05.990
rely on quite extensive, um, you know, amounts of

422
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.671
foraging and non-domestic crops. They also relied, you know,

423
00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:12.880
up until there was a ban on hunting throughout

424
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.281
much of the Tibetan plateau. Recently, hunting was always,

425
00:23:16.291 --> 00:23:19.480
always critical um, to the Tibetan diet. So there's

426
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.120
really, you know, there's not like the sudden switch

427
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.640
right between the two kind of modes of um

428
00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:28.479
modes of production, which is, you know, which is,

429
00:23:28.489 --> 00:23:30.869
which is, which is very interesting. And then even

430
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.209
in southwest China, you know, in low lying areas

431
00:23:34.219 --> 00:23:36.369
with like some of the highest population density on

432
00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.709
earth foraging is still important and still was hunting

433
00:23:39.719 --> 00:23:41.989
as well. So, um, you know, the, the clear

434
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.300
cut divide between this is not as clear as,

435
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.680
um as people once thought, I think,

436
00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:50.329
uh but when it comes to the question that

437
00:23:50.339 --> 00:23:54.569
many times people ask us to why and how

438
00:23:54.579 --> 00:23:57.239
people, I mean, even though they might already have

439
00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:02.660
been aware of farming and some farming practices, why

440
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:06.020
do they make the move to from uh I

441
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:13.030
mean, mobile societies to settlement? Why and how do

442
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:13.540
they

443
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.839
set? Yeah. So, so I think, um, you know,

444
00:24:17.849 --> 00:24:22.010
one of the most interesting ideas, um you know,

445
00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.229
specifically relating to agriculture around why people would settle

446
00:24:25.239 --> 00:24:29.890
down is this idea of entrapments, right? And entanglements.

447
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:35.170
So once you start inter well, not interfering, but

448
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.729
you know, getting into symbiosis with a grain, right,

449
00:24:37.739 --> 00:24:41.089
like wheat or barley, and this grain starts developing

450
00:24:41.099 --> 00:24:43.680
the non shattering rus. And now the grain needs

451
00:24:43.689 --> 00:24:45.729
you to replant it and you need it seed

452
00:24:45.739 --> 00:24:48.170
and then you need to store some for the

453
00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.410
next year, you get into the situation where you

454
00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:55.849
just can't move around anymore. Um And, and, and

455
00:24:55.859 --> 00:25:00.030
it's really because of that, that the, the amount

456
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.430
like the way in which you've become entangled with

457
00:25:03.439 --> 00:25:07.869
this plant that you cannot extricate yourself from that

458
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.369
trap anymore. Um I think is, is one of

459
00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.189
the, you know, the ways that we could think

460
00:25:13.199 --> 00:25:15.130
about it, you're now you're now stuck in this

461
00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.390
trap and I mean, and it, and it's not

462
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.630
necessarily a bad trap to be stuck in either,

463
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.946
right? But, you know, you, you, you can't, you

464
00:25:21.956 --> 00:25:24.206
can't just easily get out of it now because

465
00:25:24.215 --> 00:25:27.666
you have to plant it. Um, YOU have to

466
00:25:27.676 --> 00:25:30.375
store it and then you have to sort of

467
00:25:30.385 --> 00:25:33.666
start creating all of the things that make that

468
00:25:33.676 --> 00:25:38.225
planting and storage necessary like jars to store your,

469
00:25:38.235 --> 00:25:40.026
your grains in. And then you need to have

470
00:25:40.036 --> 00:25:42.206
big enough jars and you can't move those jars

471
00:25:42.215 --> 00:25:44.911
around. Um And then you need all of the

472
00:25:44.921 --> 00:25:47.092
stuff to process the grain like the grinding stones

473
00:25:47.102 --> 00:25:49.202
and those get too heavy to carry around with

474
00:25:49.212 --> 00:25:51.871
you Um, so, so I, so, so it's sort

475
00:25:51.881 --> 00:25:54.161
of, you know, when I think about like, shifts

476
00:25:54.171 --> 00:25:58.062
from, uh, high mobility to sed, I think they're

477
00:25:58.072 --> 00:26:00.932
really sort of happening because of, of, of that

478
00:26:00.942 --> 00:26:05.359
continuum. Right. It's really how, how you get ho

479
00:26:05.369 --> 00:26:08.949
how you become entangled with the plants and animals

480
00:26:08.959 --> 00:26:11.770
that you're living with and working with on a

481
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.270
daily basis and it's the, in the spec very

482
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.839
specific interactions with the plants and animals that get,

483
00:26:16.849 --> 00:26:20.489
you, get, you stuck in a little way and

484
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.520
make you sort of have to settle down. Um

485
00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.660
A and when societies really moved to being uh

486
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.660
more based on agriculture, of course, we know now

487
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:37.140
that that move wasn't uh advantages in all aspects

488
00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:41.030
because uh uh uh the diets of early farmers

489
00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.439
at least were worse than the diets of foragers.

490
00:26:45.449 --> 00:26:49.066
I mean, when looking at the skeletons, they didn't

491
00:26:49.076 --> 00:26:52.225
grow as much, for example, they were more prone

492
00:26:52.235 --> 00:26:56.336
to certain diseases to uh dental cavities and all

493
00:26:56.345 --> 00:27:00.265
of that. So, but in terms of the demographics,

494
00:27:00.276 --> 00:27:03.426
because that's at least one point that many times

495
00:27:03.436 --> 00:27:07.046
researchers point to that, even though they had all

496
00:27:07.056 --> 00:27:10.962
those disadvantages, when it came to the demographics, it

497
00:27:10.972 --> 00:27:16.552
was easier to really grow societies based on agriculture

498
00:27:16.562 --> 00:27:20.562
than on foraging. Uh But, but was it always

499
00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:24.791
the case that a move to agriculture really uh

500
00:27:24.802 --> 00:27:28.832
uh brought with it demographic advantages?

501
00:27:29.819 --> 00:27:32.479
Well, um so, so I think um I, I

502
00:27:32.489 --> 00:27:34.479
mean, I don't necessarily think of it as an

503
00:27:34.489 --> 00:27:37.699
advantage per se. But, um, so, you know, when

504
00:27:37.709 --> 00:27:39.800
I think about some of the work of people

505
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:42.119
who, um, so I'm thinking of a French scholar

506
00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:46.099
called Jean Pierre Bouquet right now, um, who really

507
00:27:46.109 --> 00:27:50.010
did work on the mechanics of, you know, demographics

508
00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.380
around, um, the start of when, you know, when

509
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.630
people start first started farming and he was really,

510
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.910
well, Jean Pierre bouquet was really interested in understanding

511
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:04.119
as well. Why, you know, why, why in farming

512
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:07.750
societies do we see, you know, higher, higher levels

513
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.969
of population? So, so, so one of the things

514
00:28:09.979 --> 00:28:14.369
that Jean Pierre Boel argued is that the mechanics

515
00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.910
of, of, of what is happening um really has

516
00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.770
to do with mothers and Children, right? Um And

517
00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.449
kind of in a way a little bit less

518
00:28:22.459 --> 00:28:25.930
to do with farming. So, you know, when you're

519
00:28:25.939 --> 00:28:31.030
um more mobile, in his opinion, um your mothers

520
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.770
are carrying their Children for longer, like physically carrying

521
00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:38.859
them for longer, right? And um are breastfeeding for

522
00:28:38.869 --> 00:28:42.290
longer. Um And um when you're breastfeeding that leads

523
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.300
to um you know, a period of lactation or

524
00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:48.689
amenorrhea, right? So you are not able to as

525
00:28:48.699 --> 00:28:51.910
easily get pregnant while you're while you're breastfeeding. And

526
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.660
so that like by necessity, just, just the fact

527
00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.449
of carrying your child around for longer is kind

528
00:28:57.459 --> 00:29:01.579
of spacing out um birth, right? And, and I

529
00:29:01.589 --> 00:29:04.469
think it's really on that kind of critical point

530
00:29:04.479 --> 00:29:07.859
that, that he focused, that it's really, that that's

531
00:29:07.869 --> 00:29:12.859
happening when people, you know, move towards more sedentary

532
00:29:12.869 --> 00:29:17.660
societies. It's, it's not anything necessarily per se about

533
00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:22.400
farming. It's that the birth interval is becoming less

534
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:26.239
spaced out because people are maybe breastfeeding for shorter

535
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:30.265
periods of time. And, and I mean, you know,

536
00:29:30.275 --> 00:29:32.824
we, we obviously don't have like archaeological, very good

537
00:29:32.834 --> 00:29:34.214
arch. I mean, I mean, that would be really

538
00:29:34.224 --> 00:29:37.535
fascinating project somehow to, to look at which is

539
00:29:37.545 --> 00:29:40.305
like, you know, can we determine how long people

540
00:29:40.314 --> 00:29:43.765
were actually breastfeeding for um archaeologically? I don't, I'm

541
00:29:43.775 --> 00:29:45.984
not really sure how one would approach that question.

542
00:29:46.204 --> 00:29:48.905
Um But, you know, I think that, that the,

543
00:29:48.915 --> 00:29:51.905
the answers of where we start seeing demographic shifts

544
00:29:51.915 --> 00:29:54.015
probably have something to do with that. And then

545
00:29:54.055 --> 00:29:56.265
I think that he also added in his research

546
00:29:56.275 --> 00:30:01.209
that um that with farming, you sort of get

547
00:30:01.219 --> 00:30:05.300
um you know, uh access to and I don't

548
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:07.199
know that I necessarily agree with this point, but

549
00:30:07.209 --> 00:30:09.920
that you get access to, you know, grains that

550
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:13.229
can be used to wean babies off earlier. And

551
00:30:13.239 --> 00:30:15.739
then, you know, in some societies around the world,

552
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:18.869
you also get access to milk products um that

553
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.680
can kind of um you know, make that transition

554
00:30:22.689 --> 00:30:27.680
from, from, from breastfeeding happen earlier. I actually think

555
00:30:27.689 --> 00:30:29.979
that there are probably equal amounts of like soft

556
00:30:29.989 --> 00:30:32.839
foods that foragers um can feed, you know, feed,

557
00:30:32.849 --> 00:30:34.290
feed their Children. So, you know, when I think

558
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.359
about my, my own work on the Tibetan plateau.

559
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.199
There are all kinds of tubers and root crops

560
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.400
um that, you know, young Children um can be

561
00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.689
fed. But, but it's also, I mean, I think

562
00:30:44.699 --> 00:30:46.479
that part of this has to do with culture,

563
00:30:46.489 --> 00:30:48.849
right? The, the age at which you stop breastfeeding

564
00:30:48.859 --> 00:30:53.410
is a very culturally bound thing. Um And maybe

565
00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.589
there were shifts around the culture of that in

566
00:30:55.599 --> 00:30:58.280
the past. Um You know, we, we have a

567
00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:02.599
very different culture here. Um You know, and um

568
00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:05.979
in the United States, for instance, to most nations

569
00:31:05.989 --> 00:31:08.449
around the world where we cut off breastfeeding actually,

570
00:31:08.459 --> 00:31:12.489
incredibly early. Um YOU know, and maybe around, you

571
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.619
know, sometimes six months or age one, whereas um

572
00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.099
most people around the world will breastfeed their Children

573
00:31:18.109 --> 00:31:20.140
for much, much longer. And we really don't know

574
00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:23.140
what that looks like right in the deep past.

575
00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:26.000
But I, I think that, that, that the changes

576
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.579
in demography probably have much more to do with

577
00:31:28.589 --> 00:31:33.209
that than, and then, and that's related to Seden,

578
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.689
but, but kind of different, but it's really maybe

579
00:31:35.699 --> 00:31:39.819
about that practice of how mothers are, are rearing

580
00:31:39.829 --> 00:31:41.609
Children than anything else.

581
00:31:42.339 --> 00:31:45.839
All right, that's really fascinating because as time goes

582
00:31:45.849 --> 00:31:49.140
on, we see that the picture of the move

583
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:54.849
from foraging to agriculture is much more complex and

584
00:31:54.859 --> 00:32:02.170
interesting actually than we thought. So let me ask

585
00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.329
you another kind of question now. So you've also

586
00:32:05.339 --> 00:32:09.969
of course, study the geographical dispersal of props through

587
00:32:09.979 --> 00:32:13.650
genetic analysis. But uh what do you do there

588
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.910
and how do you do with? Exactly.

589
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:20.229
Yeah. So, so, so I um have primarily collaborated

590
00:32:20.239 --> 00:32:24.349
with geneticists. I'm not a geneticist, um myself. And,

591
00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:27.109
um, so, so, so what I have really contributed

592
00:32:27.119 --> 00:32:29.030
to the work that I've carried out with geneticists

593
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.410
has been the climate modeling component. Um So, crops

594
00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:39.239
or any plants actually are limited, um you know,

595
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.359
in several ways by their ecology. So, you know,

596
00:32:42.369 --> 00:32:44.579
we have things that are called plant niches. So

597
00:32:44.589 --> 00:32:47.020
that's why, you know, in some biomes, we've got

598
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:50.390
deserts and other biomes, we've got tropical forests. And

599
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.520
there are two things that are really constraining where

600
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.650
different types of plants grow. So the first one

601
00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.500
that most people think about is water, but actually

602
00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:01.219
one of the primary variables is temperature, right? Um

603
00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:03.599
Like, you know, you can't grow bananas in Greenland

604
00:33:03.609 --> 00:33:06.439
because it's too cold, right? And likewise, you know,

605
00:33:06.449 --> 00:33:09.369
you can't grow apples in, in tropical regions. And

606
00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.410
that's because different plants are, are adapted to the

607
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.660
temperature of different regions. So some of the work

608
00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:18.920
that I've done has been trying to track how

609
00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:23.300
that thermal niche of plants has shifted throughout time.

610
00:33:23.469 --> 00:33:27.060
So I've, I've, I've worked on creating um paleo

611
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:32.030
climate reconstructions, um downscaling those to a sort of

612
00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.869
local level. So we can see how they're changing

613
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.150
over space and over time and then predicting how

614
00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.209
past climate change led to shifts in the plant

615
00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:44.109
niche. And so I've done that for um for

616
00:33:44.119 --> 00:33:47.765
a couple of different regions. Um But maybe I'll,

617
00:33:47.775 --> 00:33:49.694
I'll sort of start with the Tibetan plateau and

618
00:33:49.704 --> 00:33:52.364
then I'll talk and, and millets and wheat and

619
00:33:52.375 --> 00:33:54.964
barley and then I'll talk about rice afterwards. So,

620
00:33:54.974 --> 00:33:57.675
um on the Tibetan plateau, one of the things

621
00:33:57.685 --> 00:34:01.849
that our niche modeling showed is that um so

622
00:34:01.859 --> 00:34:03.219
just to kind of like back up and give

623
00:34:03.229 --> 00:34:06.290
you a history of Holocene climate. So the holocene

624
00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.938
is the past 10,000 years and over the course

625
00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:11.889
of the 10 of the past 10,000 years, there's

626
00:34:11.899 --> 00:34:15.679
sort of several key climatic transitions that happened. So

627
00:34:15.688 --> 00:34:19.050
the early part of the holocene sort of after,

628
00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.099
you know, the end of um you know, the,

629
00:34:22.108 --> 00:34:26.239
the the glacial period, what we have is for

630
00:34:26.248 --> 00:34:28.947
the first sort of 4000 ish years of that

631
00:34:29.309 --> 00:34:31.779
with a high stand around, you know, 6 to

632
00:34:31.789 --> 00:34:35.197
8000 BP or before present, we have something that

633
00:34:35.208 --> 00:34:37.938
people refer to as the holocene climatic optimum. These

634
00:34:37.947 --> 00:34:40.608
are relatively warm temperatures in the early part of

635
00:34:40.618 --> 00:34:45.069
the Holocene around 4000 years ago. Um There is

636
00:34:45.079 --> 00:34:49.018
this dip in temperature that takes place that's also,

637
00:34:49.029 --> 00:34:52.717
you know, associated with arid a decrease in solar

638
00:34:52.728 --> 00:34:55.799
insulation around the world. Um That people often refer

639
00:34:55.809 --> 00:34:58.769
to as the 4.2 ky A event, you know,

640
00:34:58.779 --> 00:35:02.699
the 4.2 K a year event. Um uh AND

641
00:35:02.709 --> 00:35:05.110
it's this kind, it's, it's, it's a bond event,

642
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.260
right? Which is the kind of, um you know,

643
00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.919
type of climatic term we ascribe to an event

644
00:35:09.929 --> 00:35:12.379
like this. And it's not really an event, actually,

645
00:35:12.389 --> 00:35:14.639
it's not something that really happens that suddenly it's

646
00:35:14.649 --> 00:35:18.199
kind of the slow to cooler temperatures that then

647
00:35:18.209 --> 00:35:20.739
characterized the rest of the holocene, including the holocene

648
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:23.020
that we lived into up to about 100 years

649
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.729
ago, right, with global warming. So, so, you know,

650
00:35:25.739 --> 00:35:28.340
there's just this trend towards cooler temperatures that we

651
00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:31.659
were actually in up until about 100 years ago.

652
00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.810
So one of the things that was fascinating to

653
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.699
me when I was researching the archaeology of the

654
00:35:37.709 --> 00:35:41.139
Tibetan plateau was the shift away from millet farming

655
00:35:41.149 --> 00:35:44.020
on the margins of the Tibetan plateau, they're there

656
00:35:44.239 --> 00:35:47.010
and then they go away and then later, they're

657
00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.379
replaced by wheat and Barley. And one of the

658
00:35:49.389 --> 00:35:51.830
things that I wanted to understand was, well, why

659
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.030
does this shift happen? Um And so I applied

660
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.629
these climate models and one of, you know, the,

661
00:35:58.639 --> 00:36:01.550
these uh niche models that um that I worked

662
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.820
on creating along with some other colleagues. And one

663
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.929
of the things that became immediately apparent was that

664
00:36:08.939 --> 00:36:11.909
there simply was not enough of a thermal niche

665
00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:15.629
to keep growing broom and foxtail millet. So these

666
00:36:15.639 --> 00:36:19.040
are two crops that were domesticated in Northwest China

667
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:22.260
places that actually, you know, experience pretty high temperatures,

668
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:26.590
they have minimum germination um you know, requirements of

669
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.500
about 15 °C, which is something pretty high when

670
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:31.979
you're on the Tibetan plateau. And there simply just

671
00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:35.860
was not sufficient temperatures following 4000 years ago for

672
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.639
people to keep cultivating these crops on the Tibetan

673
00:36:38.649 --> 00:36:40.820
plateau. And so they fell out of the diet.

674
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.300
Um AND then people return to foraging and doing

675
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.540
all the other stuff we talked about then um

676
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:48.500
around the same period of time you get wheat

677
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:51.560
and barley that move onto the Tibetan plateau. So

678
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:53.729
these are two crops that were cultivated in the

679
00:36:53.739 --> 00:36:57.689
fertile crescent first. And then um you know, through

680
00:36:57.699 --> 00:37:00.860
the process of trans Eurasian exchange, they eventually moved

681
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:05.429
to the Tibetan plateau. Um And, but these are

682
00:37:05.439 --> 00:37:08.939
two crops and in particular, barley crops that are

683
00:37:08.949 --> 00:37:10.899
adapted to the cold. And so they were the

684
00:37:10.909 --> 00:37:13.139
crops that ended up taking off. But part of,

685
00:37:13.149 --> 00:37:14.669
you know, the niche modeling that we carried out,

686
00:37:14.679 --> 00:37:16.709
part of what that argued was that this was

687
00:37:16.719 --> 00:37:19.739
the reason why, right? This was because of fundamental

688
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:23.330
adaptations to temperature of these different crops that this

689
00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.439
happened. So where I've really collaborated with geneticists on

690
00:37:27.449 --> 00:37:29.669
these niche models was um I worked with a

691
00:37:29.679 --> 00:37:33.300
group um from uh NYU from New York University

692
00:37:33.709 --> 00:37:36.129
um with a B geneticist um whose name is

693
00:37:36.139 --> 00:37:40.830
Michael Perugino. Um He's a geneticist who focuses primarily

694
00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.780
on the genetics of rice. And um and with

695
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:47.709
um uh with uh one of his students, Rafael

696
00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:52.110
gua. Um uh AND uh and, and part of

697
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:56.600
what my team contributed to that was that um

698
00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:01.159
we uh models the, so, so, so we modeled

699
00:38:01.169 --> 00:38:04.379
the thermal niche of rice and how that changed

700
00:38:04.389 --> 00:38:06.689
and how that correlated with the genetics of rice.

701
00:38:06.699 --> 00:38:09.510
And here's what we found. So, um there are

702
00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.899
two, there's, there are several different populations of Asian

703
00:38:12.909 --> 00:38:15.280
rice. So you have the forms of rice that

704
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:17.979
were domesticated in India. And then you have the

705
00:38:17.989 --> 00:38:20.659
forms of rice that were domesticated in East Asia

706
00:38:20.879 --> 00:38:23.959
and within East Asian rices, those are known as

707
00:38:23.969 --> 00:38:28.120
the Oria Japonica complex. And there are two key

708
00:38:28.129 --> 00:38:31.570
different types of Orzo Janica. So you have tropical

709
00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:35.449
forms of uh Orica that are adapted to tropical

710
00:38:35.459 --> 00:38:38.610
environments and that are the ancestral type and then

711
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.760
you have temperate types that are, that are adapted

712
00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:45.074
to temperate and environments and they come, they, they

713
00:38:45.084 --> 00:38:47.754
arise later in the genetic clock, they come about

714
00:38:47.764 --> 00:38:51.955
later. So um when Rafa was working with the

715
00:38:51.965 --> 00:38:53.834
genetic data, one of the thing, well, when Rafa

716
00:38:54.094 --> 00:38:55.975
and Michael were working with genetic data, one of

717
00:38:55.985 --> 00:38:58.064
the things that they noticed that was pretty fascinating

718
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.679
was they were looking at genetic clock and they

719
00:39:00.689 --> 00:39:03.350
were looking at the timing of when temperature poca

720
00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.659
arises and it all pointed to the 4.2 k

721
00:39:06.669 --> 00:39:09.570
event. So we contributed our niche model and what

722
00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.820
we showed actually happens around that period of time

723
00:39:12.959 --> 00:39:15.699
was that all of the areas where tropical Japonica

724
00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:21.090
was once cultivated, moved south. But yet people still

725
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:24.129
kept cultivating rice in those areas that was once

726
00:39:24.139 --> 00:39:26.540
the niche of tropical Japonica. So suddenly, there was

727
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:30.010
with this climatic event, there was this huge evolutionary

728
00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.149
pressure that was placed on those land races of

729
00:39:32.159 --> 00:39:34.510
rice in that area that once used to be

730
00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.590
in the tropical niche to develop this temperate adaptation.

731
00:39:37.669 --> 00:39:40.979
And then once this temperate adaptation was developed, then

732
00:39:40.989 --> 00:39:44.260
that itself fuels the expansion of rice farming into

733
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:48.695
northern Asia like Japan. Um AND um and further

734
00:39:48.705 --> 00:39:50.794
north. But, but we argued that it was really

735
00:39:50.804 --> 00:39:55.354
because of that climatic event that that adaptation took

736
00:39:55.364 --> 00:39:57.804
place, that was the climatic event that placed both

737
00:39:57.814 --> 00:40:01.205
huge pressure on farmers to select varieties of rice

738
00:40:01.375 --> 00:40:04.235
that were, you know, adapted to um to this

739
00:40:04.245 --> 00:40:05.715
new change in climate. So that's how I worked

740
00:40:05.725 --> 00:40:07.635
with um with plant geneticist on this. And it's

741
00:40:07.645 --> 00:40:12.034
been, it's been pretty fascinating. Um Then we're actually

742
00:40:12.044 --> 00:40:13.895
working on a new paper which is not out

743
00:40:13.905 --> 00:40:17.239
now. But um you know, where, where we take

744
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.889
the past um 10,000 years of data on where

745
00:40:20.899 --> 00:40:25.729
rice has grown. Um And um you know, one

746
00:40:25.739 --> 00:40:28.379
of the things that we found is that large

747
00:40:28.389 --> 00:40:31.000
parts of the world where rice is cultivated today,

748
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:34.949
some of the key rice cultivation areas, a key

749
00:40:34.959 --> 00:40:37.840
key areas of rice cultivation around the world are

750
00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:41.379
going to experience temperature conditions that are nothing like

751
00:40:41.479 --> 00:40:44.830
anything that they've ever known in the history in

752
00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.864
which rice has been cultivated. Um And fact, they're

753
00:40:47.875 --> 00:40:51.655
going to fundamentally surpass that thermal niche. They will

754
00:40:51.665 --> 00:40:53.945
become hotter than the thermal niche for rice has

755
00:40:53.955 --> 00:40:57.054
ever been. And we think that they may exceed

756
00:40:57.064 --> 00:41:00.475
rice's thermal niche. Um So this isn't published yet.

757
00:41:00.485 --> 00:41:02.114
I can't talk about it too much. But, you

758
00:41:02.125 --> 00:41:04.955
know, that's the sort of forward looking implications of

759
00:41:04.965 --> 00:41:06.864
this. So it's a pretty, it was a pretty

760
00:41:06.875 --> 00:41:09.675
sobering message for us to, to realize that

761
00:41:10.649 --> 00:41:13.250
a and so when it comes to this climate

762
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.959
change, you're referring to there, how did it impact

763
00:41:17.969 --> 00:41:23.070
foraging societies? Because there you were referring mostly to

764
00:41:23.219 --> 00:41:27.989
how it impacted crops and farming, how about foraging

765
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.300
societies? Well, um you know, I actually think they

766
00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:33.439
were a lot more resilient to this. So on

767
00:41:33.449 --> 00:41:35.350
the Tibetan plateau, you know, as far as we

768
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.800
can tell, people just kind of went back to

769
00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:40.820
doing what they were doing all along. Um And

770
00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:43.399
I, I mean, I'm sure it had impacts on,

771
00:41:43.409 --> 00:41:46.179
you know, the availability of certain types of wild

772
00:41:46.189 --> 00:41:48.899
plants that people were cultivating, probably also on the

773
00:41:48.909 --> 00:41:52.340
movement of wild game um as well. And, you

774
00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.399
know, that's a fascinating area of research honestly that

775
00:41:54.409 --> 00:41:56.939
we do not understand very well yet, it's a

776
00:41:56.949 --> 00:42:01.219
little more complicated to model that type of thing.

777
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.810
Um BECAUSE we, you know, we understand less about

778
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.909
what the thermal constraints are on wild plants and

779
00:42:07.919 --> 00:42:11.580
then particularly animals because they're mobile. Um But, but

780
00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:13.810
that would be something very interesting I think to,

781
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:16.229
to, for somebody to really look into is like,

782
00:42:16.239 --> 00:42:18.870
how does, how did that change in climate impact

783
00:42:18.879 --> 00:42:21.550
overall resources on the Tibetan plateau? And I don't,

784
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.659
I don't know the answer. Yeah. But, but, but

785
00:42:24.669 --> 00:42:27.129
what I can say about it, what I can

786
00:42:27.139 --> 00:42:32.110
say about it is this is that we lived

787
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.500
in that world up until 100 years ago. That,

788
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:39.370
that, that cooler world that started 4000 years ago.

789
00:42:39.489 --> 00:42:41.610
That was the world of the, that was the

790
00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.250
world that Tibetans have adapted to right over the

791
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.979
past 4000 years. And that was the world that

792
00:42:47.989 --> 00:42:51.320
they lived in, you know, up until global warming

793
00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:53.790
started, right? And that we all lived in up

794
00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:58.320
until global warming started. And, and, and so all

795
00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:01.750
of the adaptations that humanity has made in our

796
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.929
farming systems and everything else over the past 4000

797
00:43:04.939 --> 00:43:07.959
years has been to this cooler world and we're

798
00:43:07.969 --> 00:43:11.830
baring out of it very, very fast. Um

799
00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:18.010
Yeah, we, we'll come back to climate change actually

800
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.479
in the modern world uh toward the end of

801
00:43:21.489 --> 00:43:26.219
our conversation. Yeah. Uh But uh you've also written

802
00:43:26.239 --> 00:43:30.649
or done work on a lost foraging opportunities for

803
00:43:30.659 --> 00:43:34.739
East Asian hunter gatherers due to rising sea levels

804
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:39.094
since the last maximum. Yeah.

805
00:43:39.625 --> 00:43:42.935
Sure. Absolutely. So, um, so this is working with

806
00:43:42.945 --> 00:43:45.705
um my post doctoral advisor and one of his

807
00:43:45.715 --> 00:43:48.504
um who's Jerry Mitrovica and one of his students,

808
00:43:48.514 --> 00:43:51.284
uh Jackie Osterman, um who's now at um at

809
00:43:51.294 --> 00:43:55.104
Columbia University with them on, you know, just so

810
00:43:55.114 --> 00:43:58.215
they are. So, um my, my postdoc advisor, Jerry,

811
00:43:58.225 --> 00:44:01.245
he, he was a sea level modeler. Um YOU

812
00:44:01.254 --> 00:44:03.175
know, and has created some of the most accurate

813
00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:06.860
models for both forward looking and past looking sea

814
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:11.169
level rise. Um And what we did was we

815
00:44:11.179 --> 00:44:14.820
applied their model of sea level rise from the

816
00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:16.989
last glacial maximum to the present day to East

817
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.669
Asia. And one of the things we found, which,

818
00:44:18.699 --> 00:44:20.570
you know, was something people knew that we really

819
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.179
kind of defined the extent of it. In that

820
00:44:22.189 --> 00:44:27.149
paper was that during the last glacial maximum, there

821
00:44:27.159 --> 00:44:31.939
was this massive open continental shelf along the East

822
00:44:31.949 --> 00:44:35.179
China Sea board, you know, that kind of connected

823
00:44:35.379 --> 00:44:39.159
Korea to the rest of China that, you know,

824
00:44:39.169 --> 00:44:42.330
connected um Taiwan to the rest of China, for

825
00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:47.419
instance. Um And there was this massive open continental

826
00:44:47.429 --> 00:44:51.209
shelf where we would expect that foragers would have

827
00:44:51.219 --> 00:44:53.340
been very active, right? Like this would have been

828
00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:56.459
an area where people would have been out on

829
00:44:56.469 --> 00:44:58.489
the um you know, the edges of the marine

830
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:04.360
coast, foraging fishing, doing whatever. Um And this massive

831
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:08.919
territory was lost with sea level rise at the

832
00:45:08.929 --> 00:45:12.800
beginning of um the Holocene. Um So there's this

833
00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:16.030
event called meltwater pulse one A where, you know,

834
00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.780
over a period of 200 years I believe, you

835
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:22.030
know, this massive continental shelf was basically covered in

836
00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.800
water again. Um And so, you know, one of

837
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:26.310
the take, I mean, I think really just the

838
00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.870
key take home lesson there is that we're missing

839
00:45:28.879 --> 00:45:32.469
a massive part of our understanding of human adaptation

840
00:45:32.479 --> 00:45:36.669
in Asia because it's underwater. Um It's literally underwater

841
00:45:36.679 --> 00:45:38.949
on this continental shelf. And so we don't really

842
00:45:38.959 --> 00:45:44.310
understand what foragers were actually doing during that critical

843
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.010
transition time between the lost glacial maximum in the

844
00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:51.120
early years of Holocene because it's lost. Um But

845
00:45:51.129 --> 00:45:54.360
there are probably far more maritime adaptations that we

846
00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:57.330
just don't know about. Um So, you know, there's,

847
00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:00.129
it's, it's really, um, I think that there's a

848
00:46:00.139 --> 00:46:03.219
huge amount of like underwater archaeology that could be

849
00:46:03.229 --> 00:46:06.530
done um on this continental shelf to help resolve

850
00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.689
um some of those issues. But it's, it's difficult,

851
00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:12.290
it's very difficult work carrying out underwater archaeology, especially

852
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.459
when you're dealing with forager sites because they're so

853
00:46:14.469 --> 00:46:17.610
ephemeral and hard to find. Um So it's a

854
00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:21.360
real, it's a real challenge. But, but I would

855
00:46:21.479 --> 00:46:21.500
say,

856
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:23.949
yeah, but do you think that at least what

857
00:46:23.959 --> 00:46:27.889
we, with what we know that these rising sea

858
00:46:27.899 --> 00:46:32.110
levels would have uh propelled, or at least in

859
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:36.260
a way forced some of these foraging societies into

860
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:41.679
adopting agriculture because of lost foraging opportunities or not?

861
00:46:42.239 --> 00:46:45.899
Yeah. I mean, it, it certainly would have created,

862
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:49.219
you know, reduced foraging areas for them and then,

863
00:46:49.229 --> 00:46:51.600
you know, kind of higher demographic pressure on the

864
00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:53.379
areas where there was still land because people had

865
00:46:53.389 --> 00:46:57.030
to move inland. Right. Um, OF course, they had

866
00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:01.679
much, much lower population densities. Right. So, um, um,

867
00:47:01.689 --> 00:47:04.209
and, you know, it may have prompted some type

868
00:47:04.219 --> 00:47:07.699
of intensification of, um, gathering of their resources that

869
00:47:07.709 --> 00:47:10.989
then settle the process that eventually led to domestication.

870
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.320
But this, um, you know, this did happen quite

871
00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.290
a bit earlier than, you know, when we start

872
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.280
seeing like the kind of first signs of cultivation.

873
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:20.500
But it certainly, you know, it certainly would have

874
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:24.689
led to shifts in demography, increased populations, you know,

875
00:47:24.699 --> 00:47:27.709
in the area that was um now remaining and

876
00:47:27.719 --> 00:47:32.409
then possibly intensification of some resources too, um as

877
00:47:32.419 --> 00:47:34.770
well as an outcome of this. So, so, yeah,

878
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.489
you know, clearly had a massive impact. Um AND

879
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:40.000
we, we need to learn more about what was

880
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:42.479
happening out on that continental shelf to truly understand

881
00:47:42.489 --> 00:47:45.330
this like period of transition in, in East Asia.

882
00:47:46.219 --> 00:47:49.969
So do you think that what we've been talking

883
00:47:49.979 --> 00:47:53.489
about when it comes to the Tibetan plateau and

884
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:57.530
East Asia? I mean, these models and the factors

885
00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.899
that we've been talking about the ecological and environmental

886
00:48:00.909 --> 00:48:05.965
factors that behind crop dispersal and the adoption, the

887
00:48:05.975 --> 00:48:11.784
development and adoption of agriculture would extrapolate possibly to

888
00:48:11.794 --> 00:48:14.524
other areas of the globe. Like for example, the

889
00:48:14.534 --> 00:48:18.875
near east, North Africa, the Americas and so on.

890
00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:22.649
Absolutely. Yeah. So, I mean, there, there's a lot

891
00:48:22.659 --> 00:48:25.330
of you know, research in the near east and

892
00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:28.669
across the Americas too. So, I mean, so, you

893
00:48:28.679 --> 00:48:31.520
know, some of my students um work in the

894
00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:35.120
Americas and I think that, you know, um so

895
00:48:35.129 --> 00:48:36.770
I'll just highlight the work of one of my

896
00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:41.000
phd students, Molly Carney. Um So she carried out

897
00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:45.699
work on um this plant called CUS, which is

898
00:48:45.709 --> 00:48:49.070
um a bulb that is native. Um So, so

899
00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:52.820
it's a, it's, it's kind of closely related to

900
00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.169
a lily or a plant like that, right? And

901
00:48:55.179 --> 00:48:59.729
it's a bulb plant that is native to here,

902
00:48:59.739 --> 00:49:01.689
to here where I live right now, the Pacific

903
00:49:01.699 --> 00:49:05.425
Northwest. Um AND um it was a, you know,

904
00:49:05.435 --> 00:49:10.054
a a key food um in this area and

905
00:49:10.064 --> 00:49:14.465
part of what Molly um demonstrated. So um bulbs

906
00:49:14.475 --> 00:49:17.175
are so what a bulb is, is it's basically

907
00:49:17.185 --> 00:49:20.165
the stem, right? Of a plant that becomes um

908
00:49:20.175 --> 00:49:24.324
kind of enlarged and there are scales um kind

909
00:49:24.334 --> 00:49:25.975
of like an onion, right? So, you know, if

910
00:49:25.985 --> 00:49:27.495
you think about what an onion looks like it

911
00:49:27.504 --> 00:49:31.760
has like these different scales um that are that,

912
00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:35.199
you know, wrap around each other and um and

913
00:49:35.209 --> 00:49:39.979
chemists develops um one scale per year, right? Um

914
00:49:39.989 --> 00:49:43.179
And that's how it grows. And so what Molly

915
00:49:43.189 --> 00:49:47.000
did was she looked at archaeological assemblages of chemists

916
00:49:47.189 --> 00:49:50.399
and what she found was that people were intentionally

917
00:49:50.409 --> 00:49:55.739
harvesting the larger or older chemists leaving the younger

918
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:59.239
chemists in the ground so it could grow um

919
00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:01.133
And I believe, you know, that she demonstrated that

920
00:50:01.143 --> 00:50:03.123
this was a pattern that was several 1000 years

921
00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:06.873
old. So you know that there just right there

922
00:50:06.883 --> 00:50:10.052
that shows that people have been intentionally cultivating this

923
00:50:10.062 --> 00:50:11.883
plant. This is not just, you know, people going

924
00:50:11.893 --> 00:50:13.752
around and grabbing random stuff, you know, they're like

925
00:50:13.762 --> 00:50:17.103
very intentional practices of how you care for this

926
00:50:17.113 --> 00:50:20.633
plant, of how you encourage its growth and and

927
00:50:20.643 --> 00:50:22.933
then how you harvest it in a sustainable way

928
00:50:22.943 --> 00:50:25.072
that have been practiced for several thousands of years.

929
00:50:25.083 --> 00:50:28.683
So that's just one example, right? So, so you

930
00:50:28.693 --> 00:50:30.895
know, there are plenty of examples of how people

931
00:50:30.906 --> 00:50:33.926
are both, you know, constructing the niches in which

932
00:50:33.936 --> 00:50:35.635
plants can grow around the world. And so, yeah,

933
00:50:35.645 --> 00:50:38.956
I would say that these examples definitely um are

934
00:50:38.966 --> 00:50:41.345
things that can be applied globally and that many,

935
00:50:41.355 --> 00:50:44.795
many different people have applied globally um to, to

936
00:50:44.805 --> 00:50:46.335
different situations. Yeah.

937
00:50:46.625 --> 00:50:51.785
So in our evolutionary history, have we had a

938
00:50:51.795 --> 00:50:57.395
positive impact in enhancing biodiversity in specific places? Because

939
00:50:57.406 --> 00:51:01.780
of course, I mean, today we're having a very

940
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:06.149
negative impact in biodiversity and also many times when

941
00:51:06.159 --> 00:51:10.070
looking back in our revolutionary history, sometimes people talk

942
00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:14.860
about the extinction of mega phone in Oceania, in

943
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:17.699
the Americans and so on. So, I mean, can

944
00:51:17.709 --> 00:51:21.439
we take some credit here for at least in

945
00:51:21.449 --> 00:51:25.580
certain periods and places having had a positive impact?

946
00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.719
Yeah. Well, um so actually, you know, this kind

947
00:51:28.729 --> 00:51:31.199
of um relates a little bit to um my

948
00:51:31.209 --> 00:51:36.159
current project. Um So I um I work with

949
00:51:36.169 --> 00:51:41.000
um community members um who are Sharko Tibetan speakers

950
00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:43.679
um in eastern Tibetan, the former Tibetan province of

951
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:46.770
Amdo in a place called um the Zhoo National

952
00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:50.770
Park in the People's Republic of China, um which

953
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:54.729
is known as Zade and Tet. Um And this

954
00:51:54.739 --> 00:51:58.070
is a national park. Um AND it's also a

955
00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.340
national park that happens to be located in one

956
00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:03.629
of the most biodiverse regions on, on on earth,

957
00:52:03.639 --> 00:52:06.080
which is the H Dan mountain chain, so characterized

958
00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:10.550
by very high biodiversity. Um So in the belief

959
00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:14.469
that the Tibetans who live there um may be

960
00:52:14.479 --> 00:52:21.520
negatively impacting the biodiversity. Um Government policy has wanted

961
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:24.810
to move people away from the mountain hill tops

962
00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:27.340
that they once lived in down to the valley

963
00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:31.129
bottoms has restricted their ability to hunt to farm,

964
00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:34.120
to um gather the firewood, you know, that they

965
00:52:34.129 --> 00:52:36.520
need to gather to build their houses or feed

966
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:38.679
their stoves and to basically, you know, kind of

967
00:52:38.689 --> 00:52:41.209
carry out the lifestyle that they have for a

968
00:52:41.219 --> 00:52:43.209
very long time. And part of this was based

969
00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:46.389
in the belief that, well, people just got here

970
00:52:46.399 --> 00:52:48.560
recently, there may have only been here for the

971
00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:51.909
past two or 300 years and that they might

972
00:52:51.919 --> 00:52:55.550
be having a negative impact. Well, our excavation, sure,

973
00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:59.020
the people have been doing this for at least

974
00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:02.199
the past 3000 years. They were doing exactly the

975
00:53:02.209 --> 00:53:05.239
same things that they do today cultivating the, you

976
00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:10.120
know, the hillsides with crops, um hunting, maintaining domestic

977
00:53:10.129 --> 00:53:15.649
animals. Um And that this has been a 4000,

978
00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:19.229
um, year long process or, you know, at least,

979
00:53:19.239 --> 00:53:22.939
sorry, I think about a 3500 year long process

980
00:53:22.949 --> 00:53:26.629
in this area. Um And yet this area has

981
00:53:26.639 --> 00:53:30.820
very high biodiversity. Um So part of the work

982
00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:33.750
of ecologists that, um you know, have carried out

983
00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.989
work related to our team have found is that

984
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.639
that high biodiversity is actually present in biomes that

985
00:53:42.649 --> 00:53:45.189
are the ones that are modified by humans, that

986
00:53:45.199 --> 00:53:48.840
there there is no pristine nature in this area,

987
00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:52.659
humans have always modified nature. They have always done

988
00:53:52.669 --> 00:53:57.409
this through, you know, burning through um cutting down

989
00:53:57.419 --> 00:54:00.290
firewood through having their animals graze in fields. And

990
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:03.600
it's precisely in those human modified environments that we

991
00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:07.350
find some of the highest biodiversity, right? When you

992
00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:11.540
get a forest that is untouched, it actually tends

993
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:14.800
to become quite a um quite a low diversity

994
00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:16.929
forest, you know, with one or two different species

995
00:54:16.939 --> 00:54:19.550
of trees, but in the human modified environments, that

996
00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:23.860
biodiversity is actually extremely high. Um So that's sort

997
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:26.320
of one of the takeaways from our project in

998
00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:30.530
ZG go is that well, humans are positively have

999
00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:34.229
positively shaped the biodiversity here. Now, how do we

1000
00:54:34.239 --> 00:54:38.219
get into not positively shaping the biodiversity? It's when

1001
00:54:38.229 --> 00:54:41.139
you have the impacts of massive tourism in the

1002
00:54:41.149 --> 00:54:44.479
area or when you start switching to something like

1003
00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:46.949
a mono cropped farm, like one of the green

1004
00:54:46.959 --> 00:54:50.459
revolution farms, right, that we have um you know,

1005
00:54:50.469 --> 00:54:52.870
out here in the United States, that's when we

1006
00:54:52.879 --> 00:54:55.889
start having the negative impact on biodiversity. It's when

1007
00:54:55.899 --> 00:55:01.399
we start carrying out industrial farming, right? But um

1008
00:55:02.149 --> 00:55:06.729
the traditional forms of management around the world do

1009
00:55:06.739 --> 00:55:09.129
not impact that biodiversity in the same way. In

1010
00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:13.250
fact, they are actually keeping it alive. Um And

1011
00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:16.370
it's because of this human action that, that biodiversity

1012
00:55:16.379 --> 00:55:19.780
is what it is around the world. Um And

1013
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:22.209
so I think that, you know, conservation movements have

1014
00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:24.550
shifted some of their perspective on this, but there's

1015
00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:28.610
still this tension. Um YOU know, where humans are,

1016
00:55:28.929 --> 00:55:32.300
are seen as negative actors on biodiversity. But most

1017
00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:35.149
of the uh well, so I mean, one, you

1018
00:55:35.159 --> 00:55:37.959
know, statistic um I have to remember the exact

1019
00:55:37.969 --> 00:55:39.649
numbers now. Um I don't know this off the

1020
00:55:39.659 --> 00:55:42.679
top of my head, but in indigenous people around

1021
00:55:42.689 --> 00:55:46.699
the world are actually responsible for safeguarding most of

1022
00:55:46.709 --> 00:55:49.580
the world's biodiversity, right? And they do that very

1023
00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:54.790
effectively. Um They have maintained and encouraged biodiversity throughout

1024
00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:58.489
history in the lands that are their home. Um

1025
00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:00.729
And it's really only when those lambs are removed

1026
00:56:00.739 --> 00:56:03.260
from their care and removed from their management that

1027
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:06.479
we see these declines in biodiversity happening much like

1028
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.370
what I see in Jojo National Park where I

1029
00:56:09.379 --> 00:56:13.189
work. Um So I think that critical, you know,

1030
00:56:13.199 --> 00:56:17.550
to this is that we need to return lands

1031
00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:19.800
that, you know, have been stolen from people who,

1032
00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:22.479
who are their rightful managers. But also that we

1033
00:56:22.489 --> 00:56:24.110
really need to listen to the people that are

1034
00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:27.560
still actively managing these lands because they have, you

1035
00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:29.580
know, when I talked about symbiosis and our role

1036
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:33.120
in nature, they, they have come to the sweet

1037
00:56:33.205 --> 00:56:35.945
spot of living in the place that they've lived

1038
00:56:35.955 --> 00:56:38.274
in for thousands of years, found the most adaptive

1039
00:56:38.284 --> 00:56:39.965
way to live there and the best way to

1040
00:56:39.975 --> 00:56:44.104
do things there. And, and they often are, they,

1041
00:56:44.114 --> 00:56:47.205
they almost always, not just often are the ones

1042
00:56:47.215 --> 00:56:49.165
that have the best solutions for managing it. And

1043
00:56:49.175 --> 00:56:51.395
so I think that, you know, the wisdom really

1044
00:56:51.405 --> 00:56:54.064
lies there and just listening to the people that

1045
00:56:54.074 --> 00:56:57.010
have done this for a long time. Um You

1046
00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:58.879
know, and this kind of actually makes me think

1047
00:56:58.889 --> 00:57:01.479
a little bit about my childhood in Portugal. You

1048
00:57:01.489 --> 00:57:02.770
know, one of the things that I think was

1049
00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:05.310
always quite different between, you know, the minute you

1050
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.639
cross the Spanish border, right? Versus the Portuguese borders.

1051
00:57:09.649 --> 00:57:12.379
Portugal has all of these very small farms where

1052
00:57:12.389 --> 00:57:15.360
there's a lot of diversity on each different farm.

1053
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:19.209
And you know, Portuguese agricultural systems are based in

1054
00:57:19.219 --> 00:57:21.820
that. Um And then you cross the Spanish border

1055
00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:23.159
and you kind of like get these like big

1056
00:57:23.169 --> 00:57:25.360
fields with tractors and stuff like that that you

1057
00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:27.939
didn't often see in Portugal and that kind of

1058
00:57:27.949 --> 00:57:31.239
like diversity in Portuguese. Agriculture is something that is,

1059
00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:35.100
you know, broaden the Portuguese diet it's made. Um,

1060
00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:37.209
I mean, I think many Portuguese people feel like

1061
00:57:37.219 --> 00:57:40.600
it makes our a little tastier having stuff coming

1062
00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:43.479
from a smaller farm. Um, AND, you know, it's

1063
00:57:43.489 --> 00:57:46.260
really like, you know, maybe it was because Portugal

1064
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:48.800
was not as developed back then that we, that

1065
00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:51.370
we were able to preserve this farming system that

1066
00:57:51.379 --> 00:57:53.919
was very old and yet, um you know, it's

1067
00:57:53.929 --> 00:57:57.489
influenced our regional cuisine and maintained, you know, very

1068
00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:59.969
high quality of soil and farming on Portuguese farm.

1069
00:58:00.149 --> 00:58:02.149
So, um you know, just to bring it a

1070
00:58:02.159 --> 00:58:03.780
little closer to her. And I think that's another

1071
00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:04.629
example.

1072
00:58:05.889 --> 00:58:09.330
Yeah, that's great. That's great. So earlier, I asked

1073
00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:13.300
you about settlements, but you've also done work on

1074
00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:18.129
the relationship between grain crops, non grain crops and

1075
00:58:18.139 --> 00:58:21.209
the development of states. Could you tell us about

1076
00:58:21.219 --> 00:58:21.899
that as well?

1077
00:58:22.639 --> 00:58:24.580
Yeah. So, um I've actually done a little bit

1078
00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:26.620
less work on that. But, um, but I, I

1079
00:58:26.629 --> 00:58:29.620
did write one paper that was a response to

1080
00:58:29.629 --> 00:58:31.739
um a book that was written by an author

1081
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:36.060
called James uh Scott. Um ON, um I think

1082
00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:38.110
it's called Against The Grain is the title of

1083
00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.659
the book. And um you know, he was basically

1084
00:58:40.669 --> 00:58:44.370
arguing, I think what, what's his premise is that

1085
00:58:44.379 --> 00:58:46.899
basically, you know, this development of farming and this

1086
00:58:46.909 --> 00:58:51.419
grain economy is something that fuels um the rise

1087
00:58:51.429 --> 00:58:54.739
of states and yet there are other types of

1088
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:59.159
states that could emerge without, um, without like a

1089
00:58:59.169 --> 00:59:04.139
grain based economy, I think. Um, um, AND, um,

1090
00:59:05.209 --> 00:59:08.370
I think, you know, my kind of response to

1091
00:59:08.379 --> 00:59:10.370
the book at the time was, yeah, was, you

1092
00:59:10.379 --> 00:59:12.100
know, I agree with, you know, perhaps a lot

1093
00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:15.090
of what's being said here and yet, you know,

1094
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:17.389
the, the relationship is a lot more complex. There,

1095
00:59:17.399 --> 00:59:20.030
there are plenty of state level societies that were

1096
00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.979
not based on grains. Um, YOU know, just to

1097
00:59:22.989 --> 00:59:26.645
think for instance, to South America, um, you know,

1098
00:59:26.655 --> 00:59:29.254
in the Andes, those were primarily based on tubers

1099
00:59:29.264 --> 00:59:31.985
or potatoes, just as one, you know, kind of

1100
00:59:31.995 --> 00:59:36.485
throwaway example there. Um, uh, YOU know, um, but,

1101
00:59:36.495 --> 00:59:38.145
and yet at the same time there, there are

1102
00:59:38.155 --> 00:59:41.534
plenty of like non state level organizations that are

1103
00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:44.935
not based on grain or on exchange of grain.

1104
00:59:44.945 --> 00:59:49.689
So I, I kind of, um, oh, I think

1105
00:59:49.699 --> 00:59:51.979
that the relationship between grains and states is a

1106
00:59:51.989 --> 00:59:55.729
little, um, is a little, um, less direct than,

1107
00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:58.969
than, than one would, um, than one would normally,

1108
00:59:59.419 --> 01:00:01.800
um, think, and I, I think like for me,

1109
01:00:01.919 --> 01:00:04.250
you know, the key kind of defining characteristics of

1110
01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:07.780
a state are really about, um, control, right. It's

1111
01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:12.760
that it's really about defining territorial boundaries, about taxation,

1112
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:16.879
um about, um, how you control your citizens or

1113
01:00:16.889 --> 01:00:19.370
what the hallmarks of a state are versus other

1114
01:00:19.379 --> 01:00:22.090
types of social organization. And we all live in

1115
01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.679
states today that do that

1116
01:00:24.729 --> 01:00:28.209
and in the particular case of China, is there

1117
01:00:28.219 --> 01:00:34.399
a relationship between mills, rice and social complexity there?

1118
01:00:35.489 --> 01:00:39.090
Mhm. Yeah. I mean, those, you know, so those

1119
01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:43.139
crops really fuels, um, you know, high degrees of

1120
01:00:43.149 --> 01:00:48.850
seds enabled, you know, pop, you know, they really

1121
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.020
enabled, um you know, China to support some of

1122
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:56.979
historically, very high and dense populations and, and, and

1123
01:00:56.989 --> 01:01:00.929
more so than, you know, the crops themselves. Um

1124
01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.149
One of the things that you know, is really

1125
01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:05.510
fascinating to me when I look at that at

1126
01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:08.479
agriculture in China or particularly I should just like

1127
01:01:08.489 --> 01:01:13.280
point out um rice farming is the kind of

1128
01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:16.879
um beauty of intensive farming systems in China and

1129
01:01:16.889 --> 01:01:22.330
how um well, how productive they are. So um

1130
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:24.709
I'll just talk about rice farming systems in China,

1131
01:01:24.719 --> 01:01:28.219
you know, for, for a moment. Um So, so

1132
01:01:28.229 --> 01:01:31.060
they are um some of the um so in

1133
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:32.949
particular, the area that I work in the Chengdu

1134
01:01:32.959 --> 01:01:36.270
plain is one of the most agriculturally productive regions

1135
01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.979
on earth. It's got some of the highest agricultural

1136
01:01:38.989 --> 01:01:44.489
output per hectare or per meter squared. And um

1137
01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.870
how does you know how, how does this happen?

1138
01:01:46.879 --> 01:01:51.820
Right. Um So farming systems are in intrinsic plane

1139
01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:55.110
are like this, the fields are never rested. Um

1140
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.090
THEY increase in soil fertility over time. So in

1141
01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.350
the summertime people plant rice in the winter time,

1142
01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.929
they plant kind of everything that you can possibly

1143
01:02:03.939 --> 01:02:07.709
imagine they're like cabbages, potatoes, mushrooms, but you just

1144
01:02:07.719 --> 01:02:10.080
like whatever type of vegetable that can grow in

1145
01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:12.909
the trin of plane winter it's growing. Um And

1146
01:02:12.919 --> 01:02:15.439
then one of the fascinating things about how such

1147
01:02:15.449 --> 01:02:18.939
high levels of productivity are achieved in rice fields

1148
01:02:18.949 --> 01:02:23.270
there is as follows. So um people plant their

1149
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.600
rice and at least traditionally prior to the Green

1150
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:29.600
Revolution, they did so completely organically with no input

1151
01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:33.179
of like external fertilizer. So, so the fields are

1152
01:02:33.189 --> 01:02:36.520
fertilized in several ways. So people put carp fish

1153
01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:40.159
inside the rice paddy. These fish swim around inside

1154
01:02:40.169 --> 01:02:42.409
the rice paddy. They bump into the rice stalks,

1155
01:02:42.419 --> 01:02:45.094
they eat the insects off the rice. So they're

1156
01:02:45.104 --> 01:02:48.245
acting as a pesticide, killing the insects, they then

1157
01:02:48.254 --> 01:02:50.145
drop their droppings down to the bottom of the

1158
01:02:50.155 --> 01:02:52.885
rice paddy and that forms the fertilizer. Now something

1159
01:02:52.895 --> 01:02:54.205
else is in the rice paddy and those are

1160
01:02:54.215 --> 01:02:56.364
ducks, the ducks are doing the same thing. They're

1161
01:02:56.375 --> 01:02:58.625
swimming around, they're eating the insects, they're also eating

1162
01:02:58.635 --> 01:03:01.574
the weeds and then their droppings are fertilizing it.

1163
01:03:01.584 --> 01:03:05.540
Then people take, people will often have a pig

1164
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:08.290
um you know, outside their home and they're keeping

1165
01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.590
the pig there. The pig is eating all of

1166
01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:14.310
the, you know, refuse from like the kitchen, everything

1167
01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.800
that people are throwing away, they're using fertilizer from

1168
01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:19.389
the pig. They also ferment their own night soil

1169
01:03:19.399 --> 01:03:21.514
or their own, you know, human poop and put

1170
01:03:21.524 --> 01:03:25.284
that on the field. Um And then in addition,

1171
01:03:25.294 --> 01:03:28.534
um people will cultivate this aquatic fern called a

1172
01:03:28.544 --> 01:03:32.125
Zola fern in the patties that, that, that, that,

1173
01:03:32.135 --> 01:03:35.245
that grows and it's like green covers the surface

1174
01:03:35.254 --> 01:03:39.219
of the water, um that stops weeds from growing.

1175
01:03:39.229 --> 01:03:41.989
It then dies, sinks down to the bottom of

1176
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.489
the water and further fertilizes the patty. So they're

1177
01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.120
like what, like, I don't know how many things

1178
01:03:46.129 --> 01:03:47.830
I've just mentioned here, they're like five or six

1179
01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.409
different ways of like increasing fertility in this patty

1180
01:03:51.419 --> 01:03:55.010
with like no, not resorting to any type of

1181
01:03:55.114 --> 01:03:58.264
chemical fertilizer. So it's really, you know, this is

1182
01:03:58.274 --> 01:04:02.185
what these large Chinese cities are based on, right?

1183
01:04:02.195 --> 01:04:06.415
It is this agricultural production, it's very intensive. It's

1184
01:04:06.425 --> 01:04:10.774
these ingenious farmers using every single possible way you

1185
01:04:10.784 --> 01:04:13.455
can think of fertilizing your field to maintain their,

1186
01:04:13.955 --> 01:04:16.639
their field fertility. And so, you know, if you

1187
01:04:16.649 --> 01:04:19.429
look at the United States um in our highly

1188
01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:23.629
mechanized, you know, green revolution forms of farming, one

1189
01:04:23.639 --> 01:04:25.139
of the things that we use here is this

1190
01:04:25.149 --> 01:04:31.395
huge external input of nitrogenous synthetic fertilizers, pest besides

1191
01:04:31.465 --> 01:04:34.745
herbicides. And you name it right in this system

1192
01:04:34.754 --> 01:04:38.364
in China, it's this totally closed loop organic system

1193
01:04:38.635 --> 01:04:41.895
where soils increase in fertility over time as people

1194
01:04:41.905 --> 01:04:45.364
cultivate them here, our soils are decline in fertility

1195
01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:48.129
over time. Um So, you know, it's, it's this

1196
01:04:48.139 --> 01:04:50.689
really beau and then, and then there's this, there's

1197
01:04:50.699 --> 01:04:55.189
this symbiosis with plants and animals inside the rice

1198
01:04:55.199 --> 01:04:57.760
paddy, you know, and then, and then that's extra

1199
01:04:57.770 --> 01:05:01.270
production, right? Because you have the eggs from the

1200
01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.580
ducks, you have the duck meat itself, you have

1201
01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:06.389
the flesh from the fish that you're eating. And

1202
01:05:06.399 --> 01:05:09.465
so you've also got protein that's being produced in

1203
01:05:09.475 --> 01:05:12.425
your patty with no extra carbon emissions with no

1204
01:05:12.435 --> 01:05:15.475
extra, you know, input into it. So it's this

1205
01:05:15.485 --> 01:05:18.284
like ecosystem form of farming that is really in

1206
01:05:18.294 --> 01:05:21.854
a closed loop, which is just amazing and it's

1207
01:05:21.864 --> 01:05:24.685
the most highly, it is per capita, the most

1208
01:05:24.695 --> 01:05:27.725
highly productive form of farming in the entire globe

1209
01:05:27.735 --> 01:05:31.764
that I know of actually. Um SO, so you

1210
01:05:31.774 --> 01:05:35.030
know, um it's really on this basis, right, on

1211
01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.570
this ingenuity of like millennia, and we know that

1212
01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.310
these systems of farming, by the way, have been

1213
01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.110
in place for millennia because we actually find models

1214
01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.830
of like the pigs next to the rice paddy

1215
01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.409
fields in Han Dynasty tombs that date to about

1216
01:05:47.419 --> 01:05:50.760
200 BC. We find models of the carp fish

1217
01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:53.090
inside the rice paddies in these Han Dynasty tombs.

1218
01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:54.320
So we know that the system has been in

1219
01:05:54.330 --> 01:05:59.139
place for at least 2000 years. Um And, and,

1220
01:05:59.149 --> 01:06:01.209
and it's, it's, it's a beautiful one, right? But

1221
01:06:01.219 --> 01:06:03.989
another example of how people have like really uniquely

1222
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.649
adapted to um to their environment.

1223
01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.449
Yeah. So everything that we've been talking about here

1224
01:06:11.459 --> 01:06:17.610
today uh uh about agriculture, sustainability, biodiversity, and so

1225
01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:20.120
on. Do you think that we can apply this

1226
01:06:20.129 --> 01:06:23.870
knowledge with political and ethical goals in mind, like

1227
01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:28.600
for example, helping alleviate global hunger and enhancing food

1228
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:29.389
security.

1229
01:06:30.709 --> 01:06:34.010
Yeah, I absolutely do. And, and you know, my

1230
01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:39.149
takeaway like from that is that so people have

1231
01:06:39.159 --> 01:06:44.040
often um so I'll talk about the Green Revolution,

1232
01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:46.520
right? So the architects of the Green Revolution like

1233
01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:50.270
like Norman Borlaug had that goal in mind, right,

1234
01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:55.070
which was to alleviate um human hunger and suffering.

1235
01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.709
And they thought, in my opinion, they thought wrongly

1236
01:06:58.719 --> 01:07:00.719
that the only way to do this was through

1237
01:07:00.729 --> 01:07:04.719
the expansion of Green revolution technology. So hybrids or

1238
01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:08.760
genetically modified seeds, me um the application of synthetic

1239
01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:12.590
fertilizers um that are developed through the Harbor Bosch

1240
01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.270
process, um herbicides and pesticides and mechanization of farming.

1241
01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.340
They thought that that was the only way that

1242
01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:22.120
we could alleviate hunger around the world. I think

1243
01:07:22.129 --> 01:07:24.239
they're wrong. I think that they had the best

1244
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:27.649
of intentions maybe. But I think that they didn't

1245
01:07:27.659 --> 01:07:30.370
stop to listen to what the farmers of the

1246
01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:32.709
world had to say to them. And in many

1247
01:07:32.719 --> 01:07:37.969
instances, the introduction of this highly mechanized form of

1248
01:07:37.979 --> 01:07:42.010
agriculture has done the opposite. It has wrecked these

1249
01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.300
traditional forms of farming around the world. So one

1250
01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:47.909
example that I always give um there is an

1251
01:07:47.919 --> 01:07:51.050
example that a colleague of mine um called Steve

1252
01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:54.510
Lansing worked on on the island of Bali. And

1253
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:58.679
what he showed on Bali is that prior to

1254
01:07:58.689 --> 01:08:01.889
the introduction of of the Green Revolution, farmers had

1255
01:08:01.899 --> 01:08:05.179
this really unique way of farming their rice paddies

1256
01:08:05.189 --> 01:08:07.280
similar to what I described to you in China.

1257
01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:10.760
Um AND um you know, they were in this

1258
01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:16.200
completely organic system and they reduced pest load through

1259
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:20.399
their own water temple system which carefully coordinate the

1260
01:08:20.410 --> 01:08:23.970
release of water to each rice paddy. Um And

1261
01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:27.620
that reduced pest pest loads. Well, the green revolution

1262
01:08:27.629 --> 01:08:30.240
came and they were told just plant as much

1263
01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:32.290
rice as often as you can, even if it's

1264
01:08:32.299 --> 01:08:34.200
like three times a year and just keep it

1265
01:08:34.209 --> 01:08:37.750
going. What happened was there was this massive bloom

1266
01:08:37.759 --> 01:08:40.979
in Locusts that ended up eating most, you know,

1267
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:43.220
after a couple of years of bumper harvest, the

1268
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:47.250
pest explosion happened, people had to just apply massive

1269
01:08:47.259 --> 01:08:50.120
amounts of pesticide. And I mean to the point

1270
01:08:50.129 --> 01:08:51.850
that they actually have to fly the pesticide by

1271
01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:55.060
airplane which, you know, ended up killing almost everything,

1272
01:08:55.109 --> 01:08:59.479
right. And, and yet the systems, in the end,

1273
01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:02.500
this green revolution system of farming that was introduced

1274
01:09:02.509 --> 01:09:04.549
to the area that was supposedly going to be

1275
01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.640
so much more highly productive, ended up being less

1276
01:09:06.649 --> 01:09:10.020
productive than the traditional systems of farming. So I

1277
01:09:10.029 --> 01:09:14.087
think that, you know, when we think about about

1278
01:09:14.099 --> 01:09:17.719
hunger and when we think about not having sufficient

1279
01:09:17.729 --> 01:09:20.877
access to food, often the reasons for that have

1280
01:09:20.889 --> 01:09:23.309
very little to do with the fact that farmers

1281
01:09:23.318 --> 01:09:25.769
don't know what they're doing because they always do.

1282
01:09:25.979 --> 01:09:27.438
And it has a lot more to do with

1283
01:09:27.448 --> 01:09:32.127
political economy with grain sequestration on the behalf of

1284
01:09:32.139 --> 01:09:34.108
governments. I mean, I mean, you know, I think

1285
01:09:34.118 --> 01:09:35.559
about the United States a lot of it has

1286
01:09:35.568 --> 01:09:38.679
to do with unequal trade agreements. Right. So, um,

1287
01:09:39.078 --> 01:09:40.618
you know, I live in the United States right

1288
01:09:40.627 --> 01:09:44.229
now and, you know, one of the major, you

1289
01:09:44.238 --> 01:09:47.298
know, things that the Clinton administration did here was

1290
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:50.618
to sign the North American free trade agreement, which

1291
01:09:50.627 --> 01:09:54.508
essentially allows the United States to ship all of

1292
01:09:54.519 --> 01:09:58.858
its excess corn to Central America or Mexico, specifically

1293
01:09:58.869 --> 01:10:01.479
at below the price of production. How can a

1294
01:10:01.488 --> 01:10:05.000
Mexican farmer compete with that? How can a Mexican

1295
01:10:05.009 --> 01:10:07.569
farmer compete with free corn on the market? He

1296
01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:11.839
can't, he can't. And, and this is what is

1297
01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:15.049
creating poverty and hunger around the world. It's not

1298
01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:17.220
that these farmers don't know what to do on

1299
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:21.220
their fields, they do, it's that they are parts

1300
01:10:21.229 --> 01:10:26.080
of unequal treaties and global economies that are disadvantaging

1301
01:10:26.089 --> 01:10:29.419
them. And often these, you know, like where, where

1302
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:31.729
are the problem here in the United States? Right?

1303
01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:34.529
We are the ones that are rolling out these

1304
01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:38.759
types of unequal treaties and forcing farmers around the

1305
01:10:38.770 --> 01:10:41.854
world poverty because we don't want our American farmers

1306
01:10:41.865 --> 01:10:45.794
to suffer um to suffer the effects of overproducing

1307
01:10:45.805 --> 01:10:48.125
something they didn't need to produce so much of

1308
01:10:48.134 --> 01:10:51.654
in the first place. Um So, so, you know,

1309
01:10:51.665 --> 01:10:53.325
when I, when I see the nexus of this

1310
01:10:53.334 --> 01:10:55.964
problem, I see it as being a lot more

1311
01:10:55.975 --> 01:11:00.875
about social inequality and about the, the sort of

1312
01:11:01.259 --> 01:11:04.600
nefarious role really that countries like this country have

1313
01:11:04.609 --> 01:11:07.279
played in, in kind of dictating the face of

1314
01:11:07.290 --> 01:11:10.560
global economies. Um And, and less about what, what

1315
01:11:10.569 --> 01:11:13.200
farmers less about if farmers know how to do

1316
01:11:13.209 --> 01:11:15.000
something. I think so. So basically my take home

1317
01:11:15.009 --> 01:11:18.600
message of farmers know exactly what they're doing. We

1318
01:11:18.609 --> 01:11:20.600
should listen to them and let them just keep

1319
01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.959
on doing the stuff that they've done for millennia

1320
01:11:23.009 --> 01:11:24.950
and what the rest of the world, particularly this

1321
01:11:24.959 --> 01:11:26.799
country needs to stop doing is it needs to

1322
01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:31.339
stop interfering in other people's economies. Um And that

1323
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:32.299
will solve the issue.

1324
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:36.149
OK. So I have one last question then and

1325
01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:40.459
this is more directly uh directed to climate change.

1326
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:44.149
So, um do you think that acquiring knowledge about

1327
01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:48.419
the circumstances under which humans managed or failed to

1328
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:52.379
find adaptive solutions to climate change can help us

1329
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:57.689
tackle climate change and its effects even in industrialized

1330
01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.750
and post industrial societies?

1331
01:12:00.919 --> 01:12:03.180
Yeah, I I do and I think that you

1332
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:06.700
know what the archaeological record can contribute here is

1333
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:10.319
really a deep time perspectives of where the limits

1334
01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:15.939
of adaptation lie, right? So we are the warmest

1335
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:21.379
multi century in the past 100,000 years. Um Right

1336
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:24.689
now we are warmer that. So, so around the

1337
01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:28.959
globe, it's really only over the past 10,000 years

1338
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:31.299
and in most places around the world, only about

1339
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:33.950
the last 6000 years that people have first started

1340
01:12:33.959 --> 01:12:39.339
domesticating plants and animals. We are warmer than anything

1341
01:12:39.439 --> 01:12:45.220
we've ever known in that entire history. And, and,

1342
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:52.109
and, and looking at where under what temperature constraints,

1343
01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.720
under what type of ecological constraints people have cultivated

1344
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:58.189
and domesticated plants and animals in the past can

1345
01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:01.169
tell us something about where the limits of adaptation

1346
01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:05.399
lie in my research right now. I feel that

1347
01:13:05.410 --> 01:13:10.240
we are barreling that large portions of the world,

1348
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:13.379
particularly. Um YOU know, the ones that are currently

1349
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:15.720
going to experience some of the greatest impacts of

1350
01:13:15.729 --> 01:13:21.490
climate change are barreling out of climatic conditions that

1351
01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:25.350
we have known since people first started domesticating plants

1352
01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:27.589
and animals. And I think like the archaeological record

1353
01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.330
can actually bring the greatest urgency to our climate

1354
01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:33.779
crisis because it tells us that we're entering conditions

1355
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:38.240
that humanity has never known everything about life as

1356
01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:41.810
we know it today started 6000 years ago and

1357
01:13:41.819 --> 01:13:44.669
we are barreling outside of those conditions and we

1358
01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:48.799
have no evidence that the plants we domesticated can

1359
01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:51.569
adapt to the temperatures that large parts of the

1360
01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:54.569
world are experiencing as we speak. And that will

1361
01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:59.060
only intensify as we move forward. Um So I

1362
01:13:59.069 --> 01:14:01.919
I think that what the archaeological record can really

1363
01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:05.580
contribute here is the urgency of the situation um

1364
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.899
in, in that it can show, you know, this

1365
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:11.640
is everything we've known and this is where we're

1366
01:14:11.649 --> 01:14:14.810
headed and we're headed, we are headed in um

1367
01:14:14.819 --> 01:14:18.700
into uncharted territory, I think is uh what, what

1368
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:22.069
the lessons and there is no analog for the

1369
01:14:22.185 --> 01:14:23.995
conditions that we are headed in. And there has

1370
01:14:24.004 --> 01:14:27.935
been no analog over the entire course of plant

1371
01:14:27.944 --> 01:14:30.685
and animal domestication. So it's, it's a terrifying thing

1372
01:14:30.694 --> 01:14:33.274
to head into no analog conditions because you have

1373
01:14:33.285 --> 01:14:35.845
no data for it, right? You have no data

1374
01:14:36.095 --> 01:14:39.564
um for how things will adapt. And you know,

1375
01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:42.424
in the case of rice, on in this paper,

1376
01:14:42.435 --> 01:14:46.805
we're working on, it looks like large parts of

1377
01:14:46.814 --> 01:14:51.790
um of Asia will surpass the fundamental niche for

1378
01:14:51.799 --> 01:14:54.629
rice. It will be too hot um for us

1379
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:58.729
to cultivate rice in many parts of the world

1380
01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:01.729
um probably within the next 20 or something years.

1381
01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.970
And you know, I'll just point to kind of

1382
01:15:03.979 --> 01:15:06.000
some impacts of this that I think are happening

1383
01:15:06.009 --> 01:15:10.930
already um last year. Um LARGELY because of climatic

1384
01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:17.189
impacts India restricted the export of all non basmati

1385
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:20.549
types of rice. So, so there's basmati rice and

1386
01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.310
then you have Mansouri rice, which is the other

1387
01:15:22.319 --> 01:15:25.120
main type of rice that India produces. It halted

1388
01:15:25.129 --> 01:15:27.520
the export of it because there was not enough

1389
01:15:27.529 --> 01:15:29.509
due to the impacts of climate change due to

1390
01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:34.040
these 50 °C temperatures that you know, people on

1391
01:15:34.049 --> 01:15:37.390
the Indian subcontinent were experiencing last summer that had

1392
01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:41.700
a direct impact on crop production there. And that

1393
01:15:41.709 --> 01:15:47.520
is because um rice like most plants, you know,

1394
01:15:47.529 --> 01:15:52.370
photosynthesis starts to shut down around 40 °C, it's

1395
01:15:52.379 --> 01:15:56.370
an enzymatic reaction. And when, you know, like most

1396
01:15:56.379 --> 01:15:59.279
enzymes, when you, when you surpass, you know, a

1397
01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:03.290
certain temperature threshold, the chemical reaction shuts down. And

1398
01:16:03.299 --> 01:16:06.882
that's exactly what happened when you start hitting temperatures

1399
01:16:06.893 --> 01:16:09.112
of 50 °C. And this is going on for

1400
01:16:09.123 --> 01:16:13.902
like 1015, sometimes 30 day periods. You, you're, you're,

1401
01:16:13.913 --> 01:16:18.062
you're killing the photosynthetic pathway in that plant. You,

1402
01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:22.143
you're causing it to die. Right. Um And I

1403
01:16:22.152 --> 01:16:24.456
think that this is going to have an Absolutely,

1404
01:16:24.465 --> 01:16:28.206
I think, I think we're about to experience what

1405
01:16:28.215 --> 01:16:30.596
will happen with the impacts of climate change on

1406
01:16:30.605 --> 01:16:32.456
our food supply probably, you know, within the next

1407
01:16:32.465 --> 01:16:34.895
five or 10 years. Um And I think that

1408
01:16:34.905 --> 01:16:37.715
global governments are just simply not paying enough attention

1409
01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:40.395
to this um because they don't understand that plants

1410
01:16:40.405 --> 01:16:42.925
have limits that there are, there are limits to

1411
01:16:42.936 --> 01:16:43.746
adaptation.

1412
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:48.609
So I, I mean, we're really talking here about

1413
01:16:48.649 --> 01:16:55.029
a potential complete disruption of the food system across

1414
01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.209
the globe. Yeah.

1415
01:16:56.879 --> 01:16:59.770
Yeah, I think, I think we potentially are so,

1416
01:16:59.899 --> 01:17:02.120
you know, with forward, so, so, you know, forward

1417
01:17:02.129 --> 01:17:04.850
looking climate objections are based on what we do

1418
01:17:04.859 --> 01:17:07.959
about carbon emissions, right? And so even if you

1419
01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:10.520
take the kind of middle of the road, you

1420
01:17:10.529 --> 01:17:13.439
know, we're kind of having some type of, you

1421
01:17:13.450 --> 01:17:16.589
know, Paris agreement where, you know, all the countries

1422
01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.689
around the world are kind of committed to reducing

1423
01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.770
their emissions, which frankly, we haven't seen too much

1424
01:17:20.779 --> 01:17:22.430
of right now. Right. But, you know, if you,

1425
01:17:22.439 --> 01:17:24.629
if you kind of operate under those assumptions, we're

1426
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.189
still seeing this trend, right? It's less bad than

1427
01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.229
it could be. Um, BECAUSE it could be very

1428
01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.740
bad. But even under those middle of the road

1429
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:34.520
scenarios, we're seeing this trend and basically what we're

1430
01:17:34.529 --> 01:17:37.950
seeing happen. So there are only a couple of

1431
01:17:37.959 --> 01:17:41.629
areas of the world that have mean annual temperatures

1432
01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:45.959
of like above 28.5 °C. Those are places like

1433
01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:51.149
the Sahara desert, the Arabian Gulf. And what the

1434
01:17:51.339 --> 01:17:55.830
what climate models predict is that those areas like

1435
01:17:55.839 --> 01:17:58.560
the Sahara Desert and like the Arabian Gulf are

1436
01:17:58.569 --> 01:18:01.479
going to expand across the world. Um They're going

1437
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:04.189
to characterize large parts of South Asia, large parts

1438
01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:07.149
of Southeast Asia. Billions of people live in these

1439
01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:10.759
places, right? And that's not to talk about Africa

1440
01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:13.899
or about, you know, um other equatorial parts of

1441
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:16.270
the world, right? Billions of people live in these

1442
01:18:16.279 --> 01:18:18.580
places and billions of people cultivate crops in these

1443
01:18:18.589 --> 01:18:23.189
places. And yet forward looking climate projections are essentially

1444
01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.419
looking at at a situation where plant to life

1445
01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:29.984
cannot survive except for a couple of very heat

1446
01:18:29.995 --> 01:18:35.665
tolerant plants because of such extreme temperatures, right? Um

1447
01:18:35.674 --> 01:18:37.774
And that, that's something that should be terrifying to

1448
01:18:37.785 --> 01:18:40.185
us and should really spur us, you know, into

1449
01:18:40.194 --> 01:18:43.770
action and that I don't think that, um you

1450
01:18:43.779 --> 01:18:46.560
know, that I don't think um you know, I

1451
01:18:46.569 --> 01:18:49.700
I don't think the climate community has emphasized enough

1452
01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:53.160
is the impact that that changes in temperature have

1453
01:18:53.169 --> 01:18:56.810
on ecology, right? And on plants that grow in

1454
01:18:56.819 --> 01:18:59.540
them. Um And yet those things are essential to

1455
01:18:59.549 --> 01:19:03.220
our life, right? We cannot live without them. Um

1456
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:06.859
So, so, you know, that's the message I would

1457
01:19:06.879 --> 01:19:09.330
share is that like we've got to hold our

1458
01:19:09.339 --> 01:19:12.279
global governments accountable for that, for this. We need

1459
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:16.859
to stop burning fossil fuels urgently. Um And you

1460
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:19.220
know, this is really a global issue. Humanity has

1461
01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:22.560
to bound together and hold our politicians accountable. Um

1462
01:19:22.569 --> 01:19:25.000
First, they need to stop putting in new fossil

1463
01:19:25.009 --> 01:19:27.419
fuel pipelines. And second, we need to transition our

1464
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:30.299
economies to ones that are not reliant on the

1465
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:34.229
burning of fossil fuels um to try to do

1466
01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.310
something about this.

1467
01:19:36.549 --> 01:19:40.350
So doctors, let's perhaps, and on that note, it's

1468
01:19:40.359 --> 01:19:43.330
not the most, the most optimistic one, but I

1469
01:19:43.339 --> 01:19:43.700
mean,

1470
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:45.310
you know, the most optimistic one.

1471
01:19:45.729 --> 01:19:49.890
Yeah, at least it's a realistic one. So, and

1472
01:19:49.899 --> 01:19:52.919
where can people find you and your work on

1473
01:19:52.930 --> 01:19:53.629
the internet?

1474
01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:57.799
Um Yeah. So uh I have um a web

1475
01:19:57.810 --> 01:20:01.100
page which is very outdated, that is Jade getters.com.

1476
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:03.720
Um I'm also all of my research articles are

1477
01:20:03.729 --> 01:20:07.200
on Research Gate, um which is, you know, where

1478
01:20:07.209 --> 01:20:09.970
um kind of a popular place um where they

1479
01:20:09.979 --> 01:20:12.229
do that. I'm on Twitter as well, although I've

1480
01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.419
been on a lot less recently. Um GIVEN recent

1481
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:17.620
changes on that platform that, you know, occasionally I

1482
01:20:17.629 --> 01:20:21.350
tweet about climate change on that platform to um

1483
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:23.930
um Yeah, that's sort of where I am, where

1484
01:20:23.939 --> 01:20:25.479
I am primarily on the internet.

1485
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:29.359
So I will leave some links to that in

1486
01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:31.740
the description of the interview. And thank you so

1487
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:33.620
