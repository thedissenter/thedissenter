00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.119
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:05.760
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs and

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.960
the MGN by Doctor Matt Grossman. He's director of

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.399
the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research and

5
00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:16.440
Professor of Political Science at Michigan State University. And

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.000
today we're going to talk about his book Polarized

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.799
by Degrees, How the Diploma divide and the Culture

8
00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:25.959
War Transformed American Politics. So, Doctor Grossman, welcome to

9
00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.950
the show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:29.229
Thanks for having us.

11
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.319
So, let me ask you first before we get

12
00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:37.319
into more detail here. Broadly speaking, how would you

13
00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:40.759
characterize the divide you explore in your book? What

14
00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:42.189
is it really about?

15
00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:46.740
Well, the diploma divide usually refers to the electoral

16
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.060
divide between uh people without college degrees and with

17
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.380
college degrees, uh voting for parties of the left

18
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.919
and the right. Uh, AND indeed, uh across uh

19
00:00:56.919 --> 00:01:00.325
the world, uh, there has been an Increase in

20
00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:05.135
the divide between college educated and non-college educated voters,

21
00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:07.184
uh, but in the US because we have a

22
00:01:07.184 --> 00:01:10.894
two-party system, it's taken an extremely polarized uh form,

23
00:01:11.214 --> 00:01:14.555
uh, and it has transformed, uh, each major political

24
00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:17.760
party. Uh, THE divide is very associated with the

25
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.940
rise of social and cultural issues in our politics,

26
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.559
uh, relative to economic issues. Uh, SO where the

27
00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:27.480
discussion is more about, uh, society and culture, we

28
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.019
see bigger education divides and lower income divides. Uh,

29
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.360
AND so, uh, the divide is not just about

30
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.720
social groups or status, it's also about the overall

31
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.019
direction of society, uh, and, uh, the rise in,

32
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.080
uh, social, uh, progressivism, uh, and those folks for

33
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.830
and against it.

34
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.730
Mhm. So in the book, you go through two

35
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.160
major social trends that motivate your analysis, mainly the

36
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.769
steady growth of educational experience in the US and

37
00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:04.050
also the liberalization of, of American society since the

38
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.730
1980s. Could you explain each of those trends?

39
00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:12.100
Sure, so I think people when they hear polarization

40
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.059
or big divide, they think things are probably steady,

41
00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.100
that is, they're calcified, but actually there's been quite

42
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.899
a bit of change, uh, that is, uh, we

43
00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.139
are much more educated than we were in the

44
00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:27.380
past, uh, college graduation, uh, graduate school, every form

45
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.869
of educational credentialism is growing, and Uh, social and

46
00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.580
cultural issue opinions in the American public and across

47
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.940
our, uh, social sectors are moving leftward. That is,

48
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.389
uh, we've moved to more, uh, liberal positions on

49
00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.270
issues like race and gender and gay rights. That

50
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.470
doesn't mean it's steady and never goes back, but

51
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.220
the overall progression over decades uh has uh been

52
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.199
uh leftward. So, uh, how that manifests in the

53
00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:58.389
two political parties is that the Republican Party really,

54
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.690
its coalition hasn't changed that much. It's always been

55
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.360
predominantly, uh, white non-college voters. Uh, BUT, uh, the

56
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.279
Democratic Party has changed dramatically, where white non-college voters

57
00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:13.360
have been replaced as the plurality constituency by white

58
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.419
college voters. And the party is getting more diverse,

59
00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:19.800
uh, so a really huge change in the coalition

60
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.160
of the parties, uh, and pretty recent, where, uh,

61
00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.479
you know, half of Bill Clinton's votes came from

62
00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.589
white voters without college degrees in the 1990s, and

63
00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:32.520
less than a quarter of Joe Biden's votes did

64
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.990
in the most recent election. So, another way of

65
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.529
saying that is all of the change that's occurring

66
00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:42.630
in American society, the increased education and the diversification

67
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.610
has been occurring kind of doubling within the Democratic

68
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.389
Party and trying to not really occur within the

69
00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.259
Republican Party.

70
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.070
And how are these two major trends related to

71
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.100
one another? Did the liberalization of American society follow

72
00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.020
the growth of educational experience the other way around?

73
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.509
I mean, what is the relationship here?

74
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.000
Uh, THEY are self reinforcing trends, but they also

75
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.600
both have, uh, factors that are causing them independently

76
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.149
of the other. So it's really the culmination of

77
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.640
both trends, uh, that is, uh, producing this huge

78
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.910
change in American society. But I think one clue

79
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.959
that it isn't just kind of happenstance is that

80
00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:27.480
it's happening all over the world, uh, that is.

81
00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:31.649
Uh, ACROSS the rich world, we're seeing decreasing divides

82
00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:33.649
between the left and right based on income and

83
00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:37.809
more, uh, increasing divides based on education, and that's

84
00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:41.079
occurring where these cultural issues are becoming more dominant

85
00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:46.000
and where society is moving leftward at a faster

86
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.920
pace. So all of that suggests that there are

87
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.609
sort of inherent trends here having to do with

88
00:04:52.609 --> 00:04:58.105
modernization of society, secularization, uh, diversification. Globalization that are

89
00:04:58.105 --> 00:05:01.084
affecting everyone, they just and and causing both of

90
00:05:01.084 --> 00:05:05.184
those trends, but uh they are uh occurring, they're

91
00:05:05.184 --> 00:05:07.345
taking this very different form in the US because

92
00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:11.174
we have no like populist, anti-immigration party to take

93
00:05:11.174 --> 00:05:14.665
the lower educated uh constituents in on the right,

94
00:05:14.744 --> 00:05:18.015
and we have no Green Party, or other, uh,

95
00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:21.024
kind of higher education party to take uh those

96
00:05:21.024 --> 00:05:24.024
folks on the left. So they both transformed the

97
00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:24.825
major two parties.

98
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.160
Mhm. And more broadly, apart from these two major

99
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.440
trends, what are the factors that play the biggest

100
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.480
role in social change, in the changing of social

101
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.119
values?

102
00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:42.649
Well, it's a complicated issue, obviously, um, but, um,

103
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.019
the, there is an old theory in political science

104
00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:49.739
that uh basically once called post-materialism that says once

105
00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:54.410
you uh got uh basic access uh to uh

106
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.820
uh resources and the ability to live your lives,

107
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.660
then people started to become concerned about other issues

108
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.529
like equality. uh, LIKE, uh, environmental, uh, is, uh,

109
00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:10.739
and, uh, another more another related trend that's usually

110
00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:12.829
uh talked about is that, you know, there really

111
00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:15.269
was a worldwide kind of awakening of social and

112
00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:18.540
cultural values in the 1960s in the United States,

113
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.839
um, but that uh uh moved across uh the

114
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.399
the rich world. We Aren't sort of seeking to

115
00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:29.230
have like one big explanation of that. Just observing

116
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.079
that, you know, for a prediction made 40 years

117
00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:34.269
ago, it's pretty good, or 50 years ago, it's

118
00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:37.179
a pretty good indicator of how things uh have

119
00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:40.160
uh traveled across uh the the rich world. That's

120
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.440
not to say that, you know, political actors didn't

121
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.000
have a role in this. You can see that

122
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.049
because some of these trends were delayed, right? So

123
00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:50.290
there might have been an increase and there was

124
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.049
a, you know, a women's movement and a gay

125
00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:54.730
rights movement for a long time, but it still

126
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.130
took political actors to make those issues more central

127
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.209
to our politics and politics in other parts of

128
00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:04.130
the world. So, um, they weren't necessarily inevitable that

129
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.760
they would happen at this particular time, but we

130
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.250
think there were a lot of forces pushing in

131
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.010
the same direction.

132
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.279
Mhm. So in terms of demographics, you mentioned that

133
00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:17.079
briefly earlier, but what are the demographics that tend

134
00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:19.920
to represent the diploma divide? Is it the degree

135
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.739
holding white Democrats and degree lacking white Republicans? Is

136
00:07:24.739 --> 00:07:25.320
it that?

137
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.220
Uh, IT'S certainly most pronounced among uh white Americans,

138
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.019
but it's starting to occur among Hispanic Americans and

139
00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:35.149
Asian Americans, to a lesser degree among black Americans

140
00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:37.260
because they're just sticking with the Democratic Party at

141
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.790
such, uh, enormously enormous rates. Uh, BUT, uh, it

142
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:46.059
is most, most concentrated and happened earlier, uh, among,

143
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.390
uh, among white Americans. It's also associated with an

144
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.739
urban rural divide, uh, so people who leave, uh,

145
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.019
rural areas tend to be more likely to get

146
00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:59.299
an education, and so, uh, it has meant, uh,

147
00:07:59.309 --> 00:08:02.070
that urban areas have been moving uh towards the

148
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.109
Democrats, uh, and, uh, non-urban areas have been moving

149
00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:07.643
towards the Republicans. But we'll we're, we are seeing

150
00:08:07.643 --> 00:08:09.803
that when you have a chance to uh kind

151
00:08:09.803 --> 00:08:13.153
of see those trends separated, they do separate uh

152
00:08:13.153 --> 00:08:16.632
with education being more important than urbanicity. So we

153
00:08:16.632 --> 00:08:18.513
saw that in the last election where Trump actually

154
00:08:18.513 --> 00:08:21.263
made some gains in urban areas but did not

155
00:08:21.263 --> 00:08:24.743
make gains in areas that were full of high

156
00:08:24.743 --> 00:08:27.592
education voters. But we simplify it with this college

157
00:08:27.592 --> 00:08:30.632
or not, but it also is a wider spectrum.

158
00:08:30.713 --> 00:08:33.676
So people with graduate degrees. ARE extremely likely to

159
00:08:33.676 --> 00:08:36.976
be on the Democratic side. Uh, PEOPLE with, um,

160
00:08:37.075 --> 00:08:40.556
uh, degrees from a more elite institutions are more

161
00:08:40.556 --> 00:08:43.356
likely to be on the democratic side. Uh, AND

162
00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.635
if you separate the people who have 2 year

163
00:08:45.635 --> 00:08:48.825
versus in the middle, some college versus 4 years,

164
00:08:48.916 --> 00:08:51.906
then you see that differentiation from the right to,

165
00:08:51.976 --> 00:08:54.616
uh, the left with the most education. So it's

166
00:08:54.616 --> 00:08:56.476
simplified as college or not, but it's really a

167
00:08:56.476 --> 00:08:57.755
spectrum of education.

168
00:08:58.549 --> 00:09:02.159
And does the diploma divide also include any racial

169
00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:03.799
or ethnic minorities?

170
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.710
So the big trend is that it's concentrated among

171
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.460
white voters and happened first among white voters, but

172
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.559
um one thing that uh you have to keep

173
00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:18.200
in mind is that all among all groups, higher

174
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.169
education voters used to be more Republican. It wasn't

175
00:09:21.169 --> 00:09:24.400
because of higher education, it was because education and

176
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.400
income are related and higher income voters used to

177
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.955
be more Republican. So, uh, among. Hispanic Americans and

178
00:09:30.955 --> 00:09:33.265
Asian Americans, for example, that used to be true.

179
00:09:33.484 --> 00:09:35.914
Uh, AND now we're seeing the decline of that

180
00:09:35.914 --> 00:09:38.195
income divide and the increase in the education divide

181
00:09:38.195 --> 00:09:41.554
among non-white voters as well. Um, IT just hasn't

182
00:09:41.554 --> 00:09:44.195
uh come as fast or as far as it

183
00:09:44.195 --> 00:09:46.794
has among white voters. The big reason because uh

184
00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:50.184
minority voters have continuing attachments to the Democratic Party,

185
00:09:50.434 --> 00:09:54.114
uh, that, uh, move beyond, uh, their opinions on

186
00:09:54.114 --> 00:09:54.794
social issues.

187
00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:59.450
And what is a culture war? WAS, what does

188
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.219
that um term mean and how would you characterize

189
00:10:03.219 --> 00:10:04.200
the current one?

190
00:10:05.979 --> 00:10:07.960
Uh, FIRST, just one thing on the last one,

191
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.809
on the last question about minorities that's relevant here

192
00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:13.940
is that the issue divides that appear, uh, between

193
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.940
college degree holders and non-college degree holders among white

194
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.200
Americans are also there among all other racial categories.

195
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.799
So people with college. Degrees, whether they be white,

196
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.940
black, Hispanic, Asian-American, uh, are more likely to hold

197
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.869
uh liberal positions on social and cultural issues like

198
00:10:30.869 --> 00:10:35.590
race, gender, uh, uh, gay rights, drugs, any, anything

199
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.080
along, uh, that kind of, uh, spectrum. And Um,

200
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.940
that's relevant because the culture war issues have become

201
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.219
an increasing part of our politics. They are more

202
00:10:44.219 --> 00:10:47.179
likely to be mentioned in all kinds of political

203
00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:50.380
communications than they have been, uh, in, uh, the

204
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.179
past. Uh, AND, uh, the reason that it's usually

205
00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:56.349
talked about as a culture war is because it

206
00:10:56.349 --> 00:11:00.539
extends beyond politics. That is, we're arguing about lyrics

207
00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:05.090
and music or uh the role. Of celebrities or,

208
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:09.650
uh, you know, the latest commercial, everything becomes a

209
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.609
part of this kind of two-sided debate between the

210
00:11:12.609 --> 00:11:15.630
left and the right about uh whether society is

211
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.239
changing too fast, uh, undermining traditional values, or whether

212
00:11:20.239 --> 00:11:24.119
it's kind of embracing the future. And so, uh,

213
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.919
yes, it's tied to these specific social cultural issues,

214
00:11:26.929 --> 00:11:30.080
and that's Why, uh, it can have this predominant

215
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.280
role in our politics, uh, but it's also wider

216
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.789
than that. So almost anything can seem political, uh,

217
00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:38.710
to people, whether you post on Facebook about a

218
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.429
music that you like, uh, or you uh make

219
00:11:42.429 --> 00:11:45.669
a uh pronouncement at the beginning of, uh, your,

220
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.440
uh, talk in a university. All of those things

221
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.599
are gonna be perceived as political much more than

222
00:11:50.599 --> 00:11:51.640
they have been in the past.

223
00:11:52.739 --> 00:11:56.390
And this either side have an advantage over the

224
00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.460
other in this culture war?

225
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.929
Uh, IN terms of the changes in society, the

226
00:12:01.929 --> 00:12:05.090
left continually wins. They, uh, went slowly in some

227
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:09.280
cases and, uh, faster in other cases. Um, BUT

228
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.710
it often appears that they're losing because in any

229
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:16.645
given, uh, policy issue. At the time, uh, that

230
00:12:16.645 --> 00:12:19.224
it is being raised in politics because it's more

231
00:12:19.224 --> 00:12:22.125
controversial. So just as an example, uh, for gay

232
00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:25.515
rights, we had uh big changes in public opinion

233
00:12:25.515 --> 00:12:29.354
and policy on, on gay rights first and anti-discrimination

234
00:12:29.354 --> 00:12:33.390
laws, then. Uh, IN, uh, um, gay marriage laws,

235
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.000
and now we have a whole set of issues

236
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.960
surrounding transgender, uh, Americans that had been moving leftward

237
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.039
and are now facing a backlash, uh, from the

238
00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:45.159
right. Um, BUT what we've seen historically is that

239
00:12:45.159 --> 00:12:47.760
the right can kind of see ground on individual

240
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.974
issues like on gay marriage. Without losing this overall

241
00:12:50.974 --> 00:12:53.854
perception that things are moving too fast. And so

242
00:12:53.854 --> 00:12:56.914
as an electoral matter, it does not seem to

243
00:12:56.914 --> 00:13:00.494
help the Democrats uh that they uh that that

244
00:13:00.494 --> 00:13:03.375
social values have been moving leftward here because they're

245
00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:06.015
always trying for the next thing, which it might

246
00:13:06.015 --> 00:13:07.215
be unpopular at the time.

247
00:13:08.219 --> 00:13:12.830
And how have these developments manifested on the American

248
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.099
party system?

249
00:13:15.359 --> 00:13:17.500
Well, it's had a huge effect. It has changed

250
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.099
the composition of the Democratic Party in particular and

251
00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:24.530
changed the image of the parties. Um, YOU know,

252
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:29.210
since for about 50 years, the most popular thing

253
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.320
that people said that they liked about the Democratic

254
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.140
Party, if you just ask an open-ended question, what

255
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.059
do you like about the Democrats? It was that

256
00:13:36.059 --> 00:13:38.010
it's the party of the common man or the

257
00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:41.380
Party of the working class, uh, that and the

258
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.760
most negative thing people said they didn't like about

259
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.130
the Republican Party again for 40 or 50 years

260
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.010
was that it was the party of big business

261
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.570
or the upper class. So these kind of class

262
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.090
cleavage in American politics was a big part of

263
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.530
how people understood the parties, um, but because those

264
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.210
coalitions are now changing, now the image of the

265
00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.200
Democratic Party is really tied to. It's white, highly

266
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.840
educated uh constituents and uh the policy issues and

267
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.159
priorities that they are pushing, and the view of

268
00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:13.280
the Republican Party is less about, um, you know,

269
00:14:13.479 --> 00:14:16.030
a, a party of the rich and more about,

270
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.960
uh, a party of those who think that society

271
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.440
is changing too fast, uh, and should, should go

272
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.320
back to the way it was.

273
00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:28.650
So in terms of their issue agenda specifically, how

274
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.570
would you characterize, how would you characterize the changes

275
00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:37.090
that have occurred between the Democrats and the Republicans?

276
00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:40.049
Well, first I do want to say that most

277
00:14:40.049 --> 00:14:42.690
American policymaking at the national and state level is

278
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.770
still about economics and budgets, um, and so part

279
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.210
of what's happening here is we're having campaigns that

280
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.090
are more about social issues and then we have

281
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.609
to go back to governing, uh, and governing is

282
00:14:52.609 --> 00:14:55.570
not necessarily about those things that the campaign was

283
00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.650
about, but you can see the parties are trying

284
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.179
their best. To make it about those things. So

285
00:15:01.659 --> 00:15:04.780
even what's happening now in the Trump administration, it's

286
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.250
sort of being pursued as economic policy as about

287
00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.820
the budgets of particular agencies or, uh, you know,

288
00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:15.260
stopping particular grants, but it's really all motivated by

289
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.080
this sort of war on wokeness, this idea that

290
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.820
Uh, cultural liberalism has taken over, uh, in, uh,

291
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:26.130
government and society. One reason why it kind of

292
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.650
is a failed policy agenda is because if you

293
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:32.229
think about what they're actually trying to, uh, change,

294
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.650
it's much wider than government, right? Uh YES, they're

295
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:41.330
mad about, say, transgender participation in, uh, the, um.

296
00:15:41.729 --> 00:15:43.969
Uh, IN sports, but they're really mad that there's

297
00:15:43.969 --> 00:15:46.369
an increasing number of people who are identifying as

298
00:15:46.369 --> 00:15:49.929
transgender, and that's just much more difficult to stop

299
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.289
than, say, change a particular policy. On the other

300
00:15:53.289 --> 00:15:57.969
side, the Democratic Party has become increasingly interested in

301
00:15:57.969 --> 00:16:02.109
uh social and cultural issues that manifests in. Uh,

302
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.190
INCLUDING them in all kinds of economic policies. So

303
00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:08.119
you, you had a policy on building factories, for

304
00:16:08.119 --> 00:16:12.900
example, that, uh, now required, uh, particular gender standards,

305
00:16:13.159 --> 00:16:16.119
particular environmental standards, all of those issues got moved

306
00:16:16.119 --> 00:16:18.844
into economic issues, and then also the Priorities changed.

307
00:16:18.934 --> 00:16:21.304
I mean, the two biggest policy changes of the

308
00:16:21.304 --> 00:16:24.734
Biden administration were really the inflation Reduction Act about

309
00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:27.635
uh climate change, uh, and then the student loan

310
00:16:27.635 --> 00:16:31.294
forgiveness, um which was, which are priorities of the

311
00:16:31.294 --> 00:16:34.734
educated compared to uh previous Democratic administrations.

312
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.570
So to illustrate this divide, could you tell us

313
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.909
about the con the contrast between two major political

314
00:16:42.909 --> 00:16:47.049
figures, namely Barack Obama and the message of hope

315
00:16:47.049 --> 00:16:50.539
and change, and Donald Trump and the message of

316
00:16:50.539 --> 00:16:52.400
Make America Great Again or mug.

317
00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.830
Yeah, that really encapsulates uh kind of how the

318
00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.590
parties are are now viewing themselves and how they're

319
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.669
viewed by outsiders. Um, YOU know, Barack Obama was

320
00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:07.589
obviously himself a uh a manifestation of change. He

321
00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.868
was the first black president. He was also a

322
00:17:10.868 --> 00:17:15.060
constitutional law professor uh who talked um like the

323
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:19.338
the educated. Uh, AND, uh, Donald Trump is a,

324
00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:22.029
uh, has a message of bringing things back to

325
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:25.509
the way they were, stopping, uh, uh, the, the

326
00:17:25.509 --> 00:17:28.108
extreme uh changes in society that, that he is

327
00:17:28.108 --> 00:17:30.739
seeing and talking in the, you know, more simple,

328
00:17:31.068 --> 00:17:34.588
uh, ways of, um, you know, of, uh, of

329
00:17:34.588 --> 00:17:37.308
consumer marketing and pop, pop culture in ways that,

330
00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:41.109
um, you know, appeal uh to uh less educated

331
00:17:41.109 --> 00:17:44.308
constituents. Um, SO both those slogans, uh, and the

332
00:17:44.308 --> 00:17:47.969
sort of manifestations. Uh, A point to this divide.

333
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.420
Now one thing that we should say is that

334
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.910
this is unlike divides on, uh, say, race and

335
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.739
gender, where the mass parties are divided and so

336
00:17:57.739 --> 00:18:01.329
are the elected officials. Uh, IN terms of education,

337
00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.219
what we have is the mass divide um based

338
00:18:04.219 --> 00:18:07.660
on college education, but then the entire political class

339
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.619
basically having college educations, uh, and often graduate educations.

340
00:18:11.719 --> 00:18:14.550
So 95% of members of Congress have college degrees.

341
00:18:14.775 --> 00:18:17.635
70% have graduate degrees. And so you have these

342
00:18:17.635 --> 00:18:20.834
figures, uh, like Donald Trump and JD Vance, who

343
00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:24.194
are saying that they are representative of uh this

344
00:18:24.194 --> 00:18:27.395
uh new constituency, even though they themselves went to

345
00:18:27.395 --> 00:18:30.805
Ivy League institutions, uh, and, uh, are sort of

346
00:18:30.805 --> 00:18:34.104
portraying themselves as kind of traitors to their class,

347
00:18:34.295 --> 00:18:37.395
uh, to represent, uh, uh, people without college degrees.

348
00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.589
So these trends that we've been talking about in

349
00:18:41.589 --> 00:18:44.520
regards to social change and how it manifests at

350
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.599
the level of politics, are they, is, is things

351
00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:52.479
that we also see occurring in other countries or

352
00:18:52.479 --> 00:18:57.079
are they mostly or particularly an American phenomenon?

353
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.410
Certainly all across the rich world, we're seeing an

354
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.729
increase in uh the role of social and cultural

355
00:19:04.729 --> 00:19:08.410
issues in politics, uh, and an increase in the

356
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.530
education divide between the left and the right, and

357
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.930
a corresponding decrease in the income divide between the

358
00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.140
left. In the right. But we are the strictest

359
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.020
two-party system in the rich world. So what that

360
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.229
means is that um you can have all kinds

361
00:19:22.229 --> 00:19:26.260
of different coalition formations uh in other countries and

362
00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.780
you can have uh minor parties who kind of

363
00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.709
lead the way. Uh, WHEN it comes to uh

364
00:19:31.709 --> 00:19:34.089
these kinds of differences. So you can have really

365
00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:38.569
populist parties who represent the less educated, who can

366
00:19:38.569 --> 00:19:41.300
leave the kind of high income constituents to the

367
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.119
traditional center-right party, um, but, uh, you know, become

368
00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:47.609
the manifestation of these changes. And then similarly on

369
00:19:47.609 --> 00:19:50.619
the left, you can have your more traditional union

370
00:19:50.619 --> 00:19:54.209
dominated uh party of the center left and have

371
00:19:54.209 --> 00:19:59.209
rising constituents that represent More highly educated in places

372
00:19:59.209 --> 00:20:02.109
like green parties. And so what that means is

373
00:20:02.109 --> 00:20:05.150
that the traditional parties don't change as much, but

374
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.150
they lose share. So most of what's happening in

375
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.630
other parts of the world as a result of

376
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:12.709
this is that we have, um, you know, we

377
00:20:12.709 --> 00:20:17.140
have a decreasing share for the traditional major parties.

378
00:20:17.189 --> 00:20:19.750
In the US we're stuck with the same two

379
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.750
parties and they've just become different internal coalitions.

380
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:27.660
So, some social scientists and political scientists have been

381
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:32.150
pointing to this phenomenon that they say is occurring

382
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.270
more or less across the entire globe of young

383
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:39.920
women moving to the left progressively. And young men

384
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.170
also progressively moving to the right, so to the

385
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.319
other end of the political spectrum. Is this something

386
00:20:46.319 --> 00:20:49.130
that we also see occurring in the US? And

387
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:53.170
if so, does it have any relationship at all

388
00:20:53.449 --> 00:20:56.050
with the divide we're talking about here or

389
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.430
not? Uh, IT certainly has a relationship, uh, in,

390
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.319
in two ways. Number one is that the higher

391
00:21:02.319 --> 00:21:07.150
education system has become increasingly dominated by women. Um,

392
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:11.050
IN fact, it's more geared toward women now than

393
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.250
it was geared toward men before Title IX was

394
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.969
passed in the 1970s. Uh, SO it's been a

395
00:21:16.969 --> 00:21:21.079
big transformation of the higher education sector. Uh, AND,

396
00:21:21.199 --> 00:21:23.670
uh, the gender divide is related to the cultural

397
00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.359
issue divide. So women have, uh, more liberal or

398
00:21:26.359 --> 00:21:30.390
left positions on cultural issues, uh, than, uh, men,

399
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.479
and so the more that politics becomes, uh, about

400
00:21:33.479 --> 00:21:36.030
social and cultural issues, the more that you see

401
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:40.040
uh a gender divide uh across the world. Two

402
00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.989
other things I would quickly say about that though,

403
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.089
are that I that I think are sometimes misunderstood,

404
00:21:45.359 --> 00:21:49.709
uh, is that the, um, The first of all,

405
00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.430
young people are just more likely to reflect the

406
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:57.310
politics of the time. So, uh that means that,

407
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.540
you know, you, you don't have a firm partisanship

408
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.189
when you first start voting and so uh that

409
00:22:02.189 --> 00:22:04.829
means that uh you're, you kind of reflect the

410
00:22:04.829 --> 00:22:07.640
trends of the time. So, uh, in, in the

411
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.310
2008 election, young people were assumed to be extremely.

412
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.810
Democratic, uh, this election, they were assumed to be

413
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:16.750
moving rightward, but part of that is just they're

414
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.430
the people who can move because they don't have

415
00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.589
the sort of absolutely stable partisanship. And then the

416
00:22:22.589 --> 00:22:25.619
other, uh, caveat, I guess I would say is,

417
00:22:25.869 --> 00:22:28.890
rather than, uh, saying they're moving left and right,

418
00:22:29.069 --> 00:22:31.550
I think I would just say that men and

419
00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.030
women have different positions on social and cultural issues

420
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.619
and so to the extent that those issues become

421
00:22:36.619 --> 00:22:40.160
more important, you see a bigger, bigger divide. Um,

422
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.819
THERE'S not as much evidence, for example, that young

423
00:22:42.819 --> 00:22:46.229
men are actually moving rightward on issues like gay

424
00:22:46.229 --> 00:22:49.140
rights and drugs and things like that, as that,

425
00:22:49.189 --> 00:22:52.750
um, men and women differed on those issues, always

426
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:55.349
differed on those issues, but now that politics is

427
00:22:55.349 --> 00:22:57.589
about them, uh, there's a bigger gender divide.

428
00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:03.189
And how have the electoral and geographic basis of

429
00:23:03.189 --> 00:23:07.030
support of both the Democrats and the Republicans changed

430
00:23:07.349 --> 00:23:09.750
with the rise of the diploma divide?

431
00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.349
Well, they have changed a lot, uh, because, uh,

432
00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:18.760
college educated voters are concentrated geographically, uh, and so

433
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.209
obviously that means that Democrats, uh, you know, increasingly

434
00:23:23.209 --> 00:23:28.670
represent a smaller footprint of the, of the US

435
00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:32.040
and that means they can be disadvantaged uh by

436
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.640
kind of generic lines drawn on a map like

437
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.859
states, uh, or like. Uh, DISTRICTS, uh, that aren't

438
00:23:37.859 --> 00:23:42.010
specifically drawn to try to, uh, equalize uh partisanship.

439
00:23:42.569 --> 00:23:46.209
Uh, IT also, um, we should point out that,

440
00:23:46.339 --> 00:23:49.300
uh, this, uh, education divide is not only an

441
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.099
individual divide, it's also a cultural divide, and that

442
00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:55.140
means that if you live in an area that

443
00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.619
is surrounded by college graduates, you are more likely

444
00:23:57.619 --> 00:24:00.209
to be both on the left and moving left.

445
00:24:00.339 --> 00:24:02.560
And if you live in an area that is

446
00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.359
whether or not you have a college degree. And

447
00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:06.239
similarly, even if you have a college degree, but

448
00:24:06.239 --> 00:24:08.400
you are surrounded by people who don't have a

449
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.680
college degree, you're also more likely to be on

450
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.130
the right and moving rightwards. So, um, if you're,

451
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.280
say, a someone with a graduate degree who lives

452
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.280
in a college town, then you're kind of at

453
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.280
the extreme end of this, uh, and vice versa.

454
00:24:23.359 --> 00:24:26.199
So that means that you're seeing these increasing geographic

455
00:24:26.199 --> 00:24:27.520
polarization as a result.

456
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:33.040
And as it manifested or have these changes manifested

457
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.890
in particular ways in terms of the results of

458
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:36.560
elections.

459
00:24:37.969 --> 00:24:41.750
Uh, YEAH, so certainly, uh, elections more uh more

460
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.979
reflect this divide and decreasingly reflect the divide in

461
00:24:44.989 --> 00:24:47.910
in income that used to uh govern uh election

462
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:51.829
results. Uh, THEY have mattered for things like fundraising

463
00:24:51.829 --> 00:24:55.589
and uh primary turnout and uh special election turnout

464
00:24:55.589 --> 00:24:58.390
as well, because education is a very strong correlate

465
00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:03.660
of uh political participation, voting, donating. Uh, CALLING your

466
00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.729
member of Congress everything that you can think of.

467
00:25:05.859 --> 00:25:08.939
So by moving the most educated section of the

468
00:25:08.939 --> 00:25:12.060
electorate from the Republicans to the Democrats, that means

469
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.020
the Democrats have had access to more money, but

470
00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:19.890
also more activity and more likely participation in traditionally

471
00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.949
low turnout elections. So it really has changed kind

472
00:25:22.949 --> 00:25:26.900
of the circumstances of the parties. Um, IT also,

473
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.310
it matters for things like the Electoral College, uh,

474
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.750
because it, it means that, uh, these, uh, states

475
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:37.109
like Michigan, uh, Pennsylvania, uh, and Wisconsin, which have

476
00:25:37.109 --> 00:25:40.229
lots of white low education voters, um, you know,

477
00:25:40.349 --> 00:25:43.300
are likely to remain, uh, battlegrounds, uh, compared to

478
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.750
to some other places, and some other places that

479
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.989
seemed like they were out of reach, uh, for

480
00:25:47.989 --> 00:25:51.619
Democrats like Georgia, uh, and North Carolina might become,

481
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.709
uh, uh, increasing battlegrounds.

482
00:25:54.819 --> 00:25:56.280
So I would like to ask you now a

483
00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.239
little bit about people's attitudes or how the divide

484
00:26:00.239 --> 00:26:04.640
manifests in terms of people's attitudes toward uh educators,

485
00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:09.280
journalists, scientists, and institutions like universities and even experts

486
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.869
in general. So could you start by telling us

487
00:26:11.869 --> 00:26:17.079
about the hostility of Republicans to experts and institutions

488
00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:18.709
like universities and so on.

489
00:26:19.739 --> 00:26:21.670
Uh, YEAH, so as you might imagine, you know,

490
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:24.349
people who've gone through higher education are gonna be

491
00:26:24.349 --> 00:26:28.579
more positive about uh both educational institutions, uh, and

492
00:26:28.579 --> 00:26:32.310
the role of expertise, uh, in society, um, but

493
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.630
we also, because we have this big divide between

494
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.165
the parties, we've had increasing discussion between. Parties about

495
00:26:38.165 --> 00:26:41.724
these institutions, uh, with Republicans believing they are biased

496
00:26:41.724 --> 00:26:45.395
toward liberals, um, in part because they are, uh,

497
00:26:45.405 --> 00:26:48.334
in, you know, they are, uh, largely and increasingly,

498
00:26:48.505 --> 00:26:51.484
uh, uh, composed of people who are uh liberal

499
00:26:51.484 --> 00:26:54.324
on social and cultural issues and do identify as

500
00:26:54.324 --> 00:26:57.579
Democrats. So, uh, this obviously blew up in the

501
00:26:57.579 --> 00:27:01.900
COVID epidemic in which uh Republicans started to really

502
00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:06.489
be, uh, skeptical of claims of expertise, uh, because

503
00:27:06.489 --> 00:27:09.780
they were associated with impositions of big changes in

504
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:14.420
people's everyday lives. And uh Republicans perceived that some

505
00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:18.660
of these, um, impositions were guided by political principles

506
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:23.430
rather than uh by uh expertise. Now, there's no

507
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.680
um divide if you ask people about the principles

508
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.359
of science, or about the whether we should try

509
00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:33.400
to learn more or sort of this sort of

510
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.939
this basics. It's really about the scientists themselves and

511
00:27:36.939 --> 00:27:40.270
the institutions that they're in, like universities and government

512
00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.719
that have generated uh this uh skepticism on the

513
00:27:43.719 --> 00:27:47.170
right. But it isn't just hollow language. We're seeing

514
00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:50.209
it now in the administration, where there's really no

515
00:27:50.209 --> 00:27:53.969
respect for people who have been working in particular

516
00:27:53.969 --> 00:27:56.900
issue areas over a long period on uh public

517
00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.530
policy or people from the outside, uh who are

518
00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:03.849
grantees or or contractors uh who come from the

519
00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:08.224
sector. Because Republicans believe that uh they have uh

520
00:28:08.224 --> 00:28:11.545
been guided by their political principles, um, and, and

521
00:28:11.545 --> 00:28:14.064
not without cause, there really has been a change

522
00:28:14.064 --> 00:28:17.104
in how these institutions talk about issues like race

523
00:28:17.104 --> 00:28:21.224
and gender, uh, and Republicans have noticed but um

524
00:28:21.224 --> 00:28:24.185
kind of expanded their critique to the institutions as

525
00:28:24.185 --> 00:28:24.625
a whole.

526
00:28:25.569 --> 00:28:28.619
And on the other hand, talking about the Democrats,

527
00:28:28.869 --> 00:28:32.069
what kinds of attitudes do they have toward experts

528
00:28:32.069 --> 00:28:34.459
and institutions like universities?

529
00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:38.130
They're much more favorable, and in the COVID epidemic,

530
00:28:38.209 --> 00:28:41.199
they became much more favorable. We don't know how

531
00:28:41.199 --> 00:28:44.770
much of that will, will be retained, but this

532
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:48.050
really would be surprising to, you know, 1960s activists

533
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.689
who did not think that, you know, uh, Harvard

534
00:28:50.689 --> 00:28:53.400
University and the New York Times were the heroes

535
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:56.609
of uh moving uh America in a in a

536
00:28:56.609 --> 00:28:59.824
left. Direction. But now, a lot of Democrats see

537
00:28:59.824 --> 00:29:04.344
these institutions as bulwarks and as, you know, institutions

538
00:29:04.344 --> 00:29:10.255
that should should continue their role in American politics

539
00:29:10.255 --> 00:29:14.505
and society, and it's Republicans who want to burn

540
00:29:14.505 --> 00:29:17.344
them all down, uh, which is, you know, quite,

541
00:29:17.425 --> 00:29:18.625
quite a contrast.

542
00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.609
Have there also been changes in terms of the

543
00:29:22.609 --> 00:29:28.609
content produced by conservative media on institutions like universities

544
00:29:28.609 --> 00:29:31.569
and the educational system more generally?

545
00:29:32.459 --> 00:29:34.930
Yeah, and you know, we went through this with

546
00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:38.650
regard to the media earlier, so, you know, again

547
00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:41.089
might surprise people, but trust in the media used

548
00:29:41.089 --> 00:29:45.329
to be higher among Republicans in, in the 1960s

549
00:29:45.329 --> 00:29:48.209
and 1970s because Republicans were higher income and they

550
00:29:48.209 --> 00:29:50.780
were more likely to read a daily newspaper and

551
00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:54.170
Uh, all of that, um, and it really took

552
00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:58.810
this very long, uh, movement, uh, among the conservatives

553
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.250
to say these institutions are liberally biased, uh, and

554
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:06.329
we should build alternative institutions, uh, and among the

555
00:30:06.329 --> 00:30:09.890
things talked about, for example, uh, one study of

556
00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:13.250
Rush Limbaugh's radio program in the 1990s said that

557
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:15.244
uh he talked about. Democrats that he didn't like

558
00:30:15.244 --> 00:30:17.084
every day, and he talked about the bias in

559
00:30:17.084 --> 00:30:19.685
the media every single day. So that was the

560
00:30:19.685 --> 00:30:22.364
kind of core message of conservative media. uh, AND

561
00:30:22.364 --> 00:30:26.964
it has now become a core message about universities,

562
00:30:27.204 --> 00:30:31.005
about experts, about uh the higher education voters, and

563
00:30:31.005 --> 00:30:34.594
about cultural uh liberals guiding institutions, even in business,

564
00:30:34.755 --> 00:30:38.359
uh, and in the nonprofit community. Uh, AND, uh,

565
00:30:38.489 --> 00:30:41.280
you know, that's an expansion of this, uh, same,

566
00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.209
uh, same kind of rhetoric. And among universities, it's

567
00:30:45.209 --> 00:30:48.160
useful to kind of look at its, it's, uh,

568
00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.569
progression. You know, it was always the case that

569
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.609
conservatives were skeptical of people in, you know, ethnic

570
00:30:53.609 --> 00:30:58.364
studies departments and political correctness on campus, but You

571
00:30:58.364 --> 00:31:01.244
saw that it expanded in kind of uh debates

572
00:31:01.244 --> 00:31:05.234
over uh religion and over environmentalism, to not just

573
00:31:05.234 --> 00:31:08.224
be about humanity scholars or social scientists, but now

574
00:31:08.224 --> 00:31:12.594
about natural scientists as well. Uh, AND those institutions,

575
00:31:12.685 --> 00:31:16.045
um, similarly became more invested in, uh, what the

576
00:31:16.045 --> 00:31:18.645
right would see as a political, uh, project over

577
00:31:18.645 --> 00:31:21.834
time. Uh, AND so, uh, that's created our, our

578
00:31:21.834 --> 00:31:22.645
current big divide.

579
00:31:23.709 --> 00:31:27.800
But when it comes to these hostile attitudes toward

580
00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:33.270
uh some institutions like universities, have they have actual

581
00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:37.680
effects on the targeted institutions, are they, for example,

582
00:31:37.969 --> 00:31:40.290
more vulnerable in any way now?

583
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.859
Uh, CERTAINLY, uh, you know, we're seeing right now,

584
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.670
uh, the major threats to university funding, uh, from

585
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.660
the federal government, uh, and, uh, from state governments,

586
00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:55.430
uh, efforts to try to control things uh like

587
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:59.989
uh faculty hiring, um, curriculum, uh, from, uh, state

588
00:31:59.989 --> 00:32:05.869
governments, and, uh, as, uh, provisions in federal funding.

589
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:09.010
Uh, SO, uh, all of that is, is a

590
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:11.530
big change, uh, from, you know, even a few

591
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.410
years ago when higher education was mostly a state

592
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.569
political issue, uh, and it was mostly about, you

593
00:32:17.569 --> 00:32:20.319
know, what can we do to support our states,

594
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.844
universities versus other states, um, and there were. Concerns,

595
00:32:23.905 --> 00:32:27.454
but they were more about access, uh, about, um,

596
00:32:27.464 --> 00:32:31.344
the, about matching the university curriculum with the job

597
00:32:31.344 --> 00:32:35.094
market, uh, things like that, uh, rather than, uh,

598
00:32:35.104 --> 00:32:38.074
this kind of war on wokeness, um, which has

599
00:32:38.074 --> 00:32:40.385
become the most central part of higher education politics

600
00:32:40.385 --> 00:32:40.625
now.

601
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.380
So we've talked about the media, about universities, experts.

602
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.619
How about corporations? Has there been any impact on

603
00:32:48.619 --> 00:32:53.489
corporations, how they are run their values, and how

604
00:32:53.489 --> 00:32:57.709
Republicans and Democrats relate to them and their leadership?

605
00:32:58.859 --> 00:33:03.500
Absolutely. So, um, because people who are have higher

606
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.560
education, uh, have more socially and culturally liberal values

607
00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:11.680
and uh dominate all social institutions, that means that

608
00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.239
they have brought those values to those institutions, and

609
00:33:16.479 --> 00:33:19.239
they became pretty open about it in the wake

610
00:33:19.239 --> 00:33:24.223
of George Floyd and uh. Some other, uh, and

611
00:33:24.223 --> 00:33:28.422
the first Trump administration, uh, and that meant that

612
00:33:28.422 --> 00:33:32.782
conservatives really noticed and were alarmed uh about the

613
00:33:32.853 --> 00:33:37.333
the trends in their kind of traditional partner, uh,

614
00:33:37.343 --> 00:33:41.022
in corporate America. So, um, there was a real

615
00:33:41.022 --> 00:33:43.863
change and there is a huge backlash, and that

616
00:33:43.863 --> 00:33:46.926
has uh kind of uh ignited. A big, a

617
00:33:46.926 --> 00:33:50.326
big shift in corporate politics. What we're seeing now

618
00:33:50.326 --> 00:33:53.465
is companies trying to react to the backlash. Uh,

619
00:33:53.725 --> 00:33:55.686
SOME of that is real, some about some of

620
00:33:55.686 --> 00:33:58.286
that is just changing the names, some of it

621
00:33:58.286 --> 00:34:01.166
is just scaling back initiatives that might have been

622
00:34:01.166 --> 00:34:04.576
seen as as temporary uh uh before, but there's

623
00:34:04.576 --> 00:34:07.206
been a big change in corporate policies and in

624
00:34:07.206 --> 00:34:11.728
uh the Republican approach uh to Uh, to companies,

625
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.610
uh, as a, as a result, uh, of this.

626
00:34:14.899 --> 00:34:18.379
Um, WE would just emphasize that, you know, this

627
00:34:18.379 --> 00:34:24.449
isn't, uh, necessarily the, uh, the, the, the Marxist

628
00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:27.830
project, uh, that some conservatives imagine, uh, that, uh,

629
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.699
people came in and took over these institutions. It's

630
00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:34.879
mostly companies responding to their employees, uh, companies responding

631
00:34:34.879 --> 00:34:39.208
to their customers, uh, and. Um, TRYING to follow

632
00:34:39.208 --> 00:34:43.199
social trends, and that's meant, uh, that, you know,

633
00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.510
they've been caught up in the same trends, uh,

634
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.280
same social and cultural trends moving leftward, uh, that

635
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.760
the Democratic Party has been, uh, and they're facing

636
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.840
a backlash as a result.

637
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.040
So I would like to ask you now about

638
00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.229
how this divide has manifested in terms of policymaking

639
00:35:00.229 --> 00:35:03.550
and with that in mind, let's explore the example

640
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:07.439
of the COVID-19 pandemic. So how did the divide

641
00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:10.760
manifest during the COVID-19 pandemic?

642
00:35:12.639 --> 00:35:14.739
Well, it was, it was front and center, uh,

643
00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.840
because a lot of policymaking uh became the domain

644
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.560
of experts. Americans saw these people that they had

645
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.790
never heard of before guiding uh uh American policy

646
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:29.010
and a pretty uh drastic changes in everyday life.

647
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.060
Figures like Anthony Fauci, who people had never heard

648
00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:36.229
of, uh, became, you know, they became quickly a

649
00:35:36.229 --> 00:35:39.699
50 point difference in Americans' attitudes toward this guy

650
00:35:40.189 --> 00:35:42.699
uh uh as a result of uh the the

651
00:35:42.709 --> 00:35:47.320
the COVID uh wars, um, and It, it has

652
00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.719
had permanent effects. It has meant that Republicans are

653
00:35:49.719 --> 00:35:53.060
more skeptical about the role of experts, about the

654
00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:56.439
role of government officials, about the role of public

655
00:35:56.439 --> 00:36:00.750
health, uh all kinds of uh of of pieces.

656
00:36:01.189 --> 00:36:02.959
Uh, AND we would point out that of course

657
00:36:02.959 --> 00:36:05.520
there are always going to be examples of, of

658
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:09.179
overreach or policies that went too far or policies

659
00:36:09.179 --> 00:36:12.649
that might have been aligned. Uh, TOWARD, uh, political

660
00:36:12.649 --> 00:36:16.889
values, uh, as opposed to expertise. Um, SO for

661
00:36:16.889 --> 00:36:19.560
example, one salient example that that usually comes up

662
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.770
is that public health officials endorsed protests against uh

663
00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:28.090
George Floyd right after they had opposed protests against

664
00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:31.729
the lockdowns, uh, and told everyone that, you know,

665
00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:34.810
it was dangerous to congregate in large areas, and

666
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:38.250
conservatives, I think, rightly saw that as motivated by

667
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.310
a set of social and political values. So expertise

668
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.669
is always going to be a combination of greater

669
00:36:43.669 --> 00:36:48.110
knowledge, but also distinct, but not necessarily better values,

670
00:36:48.409 --> 00:36:51.969
uh, and, uh, uh, it is, uh, and of

671
00:36:51.969 --> 00:36:55.189
course, interests, that is the role of uh uh

672
00:36:55.189 --> 00:36:59.350
these people having a bigger impact in society. And

673
00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:02.350
so, um, experts are always going to want kind

674
00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:05.189
of more impact. They are going to be affiliated

675
00:37:05.189 --> 00:37:07.750
with the evidence, uh, but they also have distinct

676
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:11.669
values, and so. Uh, THAT means, uh, that their

677
00:37:11.669 --> 00:37:14.110
pronouncements are just increasingly politicized today.

678
00:37:15.669 --> 00:37:19.169
So what does it mean to say that everything

679
00:37:19.169 --> 00:37:23.129
is about politics and politics is about everything?

680
00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:27.770
Well, when uh our politics becomes about uh social

681
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:32.250
and cultural issues and when um people's complaints about

682
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:36.250
who they're seeing on television, uh or uh what

683
00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:40.169
kind of straws they're encountering in restaurants or, uh,

684
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:43.409
you know, every single daily, uh, thing can be

685
00:37:43.409 --> 00:37:47.290
associated back uh to some kind of political issue.

686
00:37:47.679 --> 00:37:49.639
Uh, IT really just means that it's hard to

687
00:37:49.639 --> 00:37:52.879
stay out of politics. It also matters for these

688
00:37:52.879 --> 00:37:55.919
institutions that believe that they're kind of not on

689
00:37:55.919 --> 00:37:57.639
one side of the culture of war but are

690
00:37:57.639 --> 00:38:01.199
increasingly placed on one side. So it's very hard

691
00:38:01.199 --> 00:38:04.629
to be an institution that is above the fray,

692
00:38:05.159 --> 00:38:08.449
uh, if you're, say, a technology company or You're

693
00:38:08.449 --> 00:38:12.939
a nonprofit organization, a service provider, um, who wants

694
00:38:12.939 --> 00:38:15.020
to say we're not on either side of the

695
00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.139
culture war, um, they really are increasingly on one

696
00:38:18.139 --> 00:38:22.419
side because uh uh every kind of uh pronouncement

697
00:38:22.419 --> 00:38:24.750
or a thing that they do is going to

698
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.979
be perceived as having that uh clear political val.

699
00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:32.350
Um, AND so, you know, it's very hard then

700
00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.620
to get out of that. That is, there's a

701
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:38.699
bunch of self-reinforcing cycles here. Uh, WHERE you can't

702
00:38:38.699 --> 00:38:41.699
sort of say we're gonna step back without that

703
00:38:41.699 --> 00:38:43.530
being perceived as a political move as well.

704
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.270
One last question then. How do you look at

705
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:50.239
the future of this divide? Do you think that

706
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.399
it is something that could be bridged in any

707
00:38:53.399 --> 00:38:56.919
way? And do you approach it as a problem

708
00:38:56.919 --> 00:39:01.439
that we could and should try to solve, or

709
00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:07.120
are you just, or are you simply um exploring

710
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.070
and a social and political phenomenon here?

711
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.610
Uh, WE'RE admittedly light on solutions, uh, maybe because

712
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.770
they, they aren't readily apparent, but yes, there's a

713
00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:20.889
lot of self-reinforcing processes here. Um, THEY have some

714
00:39:20.889 --> 00:39:24.090
detrimental effects, especially if we talk about how we

715
00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:28.209
see one another, uh, and our ability to communicate

716
00:39:28.209 --> 00:39:31.350
across that divide and actually uh get uh a

717
00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:36.129
policy done. I think sometime this is. Overstated, that

718
00:39:36.129 --> 00:39:38.169
is, like I said, a lot of governing is

719
00:39:38.169 --> 00:39:41.120
still about economic policy and budgets. There's a lot

720
00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.530
more bipartisanship than people think because they hear about

721
00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:46.750
the partisan fights but not the things that do

722
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:51.090
get resolved. Um, AND so in terms of policy

723
00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:55.169
making, there still can be progress, um, but it

724
00:39:55.169 --> 00:39:58.600
tends to get less, less attention. Uh, BUT there

725
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.280
are a lot of, you know, reasons why this

726
00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.070
is likely to, to continue, uh, uh, into, uh,

727
00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.439
into the future, and all the things that people

728
00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:11.429
want to do to reform the system are also

729
00:40:11.639 --> 00:40:14.040
pieces of the culture war. So, you know, you

730
00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.679
could say, well, this means we have to reform

731
00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:18.199
our institutions to do X, Y, and Z, but

732
00:40:18.199 --> 00:40:20.959
that is going to be perceived as uh being

733
00:40:20.959 --> 00:40:24.159
on one side of the social and cultural conflict

734
00:40:24.159 --> 00:40:25.770
that we're having in the United States.

735
00:40:26.889 --> 00:40:30.760
Mhm. Great. So, uh, the book is again polarized

736
00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.120
by the Greece, how the diploma divide and the

737
00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:37.010
Culture War Transformed American Politics. I'm leaving a link

738
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:39.600
to it in the description of the interview. And

739
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.969
Dr. Grossman, just before we go, apart from the

740
00:40:42.969 --> 00:40:46.560
book, where can people find you and your work

741
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.620
on the internet?

742
00:40:48.669 --> 00:40:53.270
Uh, MY website is mattG.org, um, and I'm on

743
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.659
all of the social media platforms as well. If

744
00:40:56.659 --> 00:40:59.840
people wanna follow, uh, current, uh, thoughts, and I

745
00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.600
have my own podcast called The Science of Politics

746
00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.840
where I interview political science researchers. So, uh, hopefully

747
00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.429
people will check that out as well.

748
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Great. I'm also leaving links to that in the

749
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
description of the interview, and Dr. Grossman, thank you

750
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.080
