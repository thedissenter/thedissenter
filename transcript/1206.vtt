WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.190
OK, so, uh, let me ask you then, I

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.219
mean, and I guess that this is, uh, talk

3
00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:09.270
and asking you this is very relevant because since

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.270
you are an author, since you write fiction, I

5
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.550
guess that as an author, you would have your

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.229
own opinion about this subject. But what do you

7
00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:25.409
think about when people adapt a book to screen,

8
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.590
I mean, they make a movie or some, or

9
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.149
a ser a TV series, something like that and

10
00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:33.970
To, and they change the source material. I mean,

11
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.169
to what extent or at what point are you

12
00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:41.689
get frustrated, do you get frustrated when they change

13
00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:44.729
the source material? I mean, uh, because I can

14
00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.970
talk about the example of which some people have

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.290
been discussing a lot of the rings of power.

16
00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:52.009
I don't know if you watch the show or

17
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:56.090
not. If not, there's surely plenty of other examples

18
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.279
we can discuss, but Uh, how frustrated do you

19
00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:05.239
get, uh, how quickly do you get frustrated about

20
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.400
it? I mean, what kinds of things do they

21
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.389
need to change for you to get frustrated?

22
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.430
Well, I, I mean That would depend on the

23
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.970
source material and how good it is and how

24
00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:20.430
attached I am to it. I think sometimes if

25
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.709
the source material was just like a great idea,

26
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.110
but not a good execution, a great idea in

27
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.949
general, and then someone with real talent comes in

28
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.370
and improves it. Yeah, um, then that's a great

29
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.230
thing, um. No, that, that's not always the case.

30
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.830
I mean, what, what is it they, they say

31
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.129
like great novels make terrible movies and bad novels

32
00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:44.669
make great movies or something, you know what I

33
00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:48.730
mean, but I think that Often that's true, because

34
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.730
kind of bad novels are often really good ideas,

35
00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:54.650
which is why they resonated and did really well.

36
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.769
Like, it was a great idea for a story,

37
00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.489
but the, you know, whoever wrote it just didn't

38
00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.089
have the technical skill to execute. You know, it

39
00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:05.309
just wasn't like a, a. A, a, a real

40
00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:07.760
aesthetic writer maybe, or, you know, you know, I

41
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.360
mean, it could be a, a bunch of different

42
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.029
things. So it, that depends. Now, what What really

43
00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.350
frustrates me, and this is adjacent to what you're

44
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.550
saying and sometimes is directly relevant, but I don't

45
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.330
like when, uh, people astroturf modern wars onto historical.

46
00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.389
Um, Stories.

47
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.460
Well, yeah, I understand what you're saying.

48
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.699
Yeah, you know what I mean, and I think

49
00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:42.399
that happens often with source material that people do

50
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.399
astroturf modern wars onto it because they, uh, uh,

51
00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.619
whatever, it's, it's, it can be, they maybe they

52
00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:52.279
believe it's gonna be more palatable to viewers and,

53
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.259
and maybe it's too complicated to explain why someone

54
00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:02.070
would behave in a certain way. In that context,

55
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.179
and, um, or maybe they are afraid that the

56
00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.050
character will not be sympathetic because they're behaving in

57
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.410
a way, in a way that a character would

58
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.389
behave in like 1746 or whatever it is. But,

59
00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:16.289
um, you know, I love history, and so that.

60
00:03:16.384 --> 00:03:19.464
Drives me crazy. When I think, no, that's not

61
00:03:19.464 --> 00:03:23.264
how a woman would speak to her husband, or

62
00:03:23.264 --> 00:03:25.654
a man out on the street in, you know,

63
00:03:25.854 --> 00:03:28.544
in 1542. That's just not how she would do

64
00:03:28.544 --> 00:03:31.214
things, you know? It doesn't mean that she wouldn't,

65
00:03:31.664 --> 00:03:34.785
you know, figure out how to get her needs,

66
00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:36.945
but she wouldn't do it in that way, you

67
00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:47.020
know? Um, SO, I I, I, I figure if

68
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:54.529
the source material. What resonated enough. That the story

69
00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:58.059
was really, you know, loved by a wider audience,

70
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.440
and then that story is, is bought by, you

71
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.289
know, The, a, a company that wants to put

72
00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:07.300
it on screen, then why don't they stick to

73
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.490
the original source material? I just kind of, I

74
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.520
really don't understand that disconnect often because it, it,

75
00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:16.869
the work has been done for you. People really

76
00:04:16.869 --> 00:04:19.190
want to see the story the way it is.

77
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:26.519
Um, SO, you know. How are you going to

78
00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:27.959
improve it? And if you are going to improve

79
00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:31.940
it, great. Sometimes it gets improved quite a bit.

80
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.440
Mhm. How do you feel about it?

81
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.290
Yeah, I mean, there are things that frustrate me

82
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.809
and others that tend to frustrate a lot of

83
00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:47.220
people that are really fans of the original story,

84
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.049
but don't frustrate me as much. I mean, for

85
00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:55.239
example, there are aspects of changing reps, uh, the,

86
00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.226
the traits of particular characters or character development. OR

87
00:05:01.605 --> 00:05:06.246
certain aspects of the plot that are relevant to

88
00:05:06.246 --> 00:05:10.126
how the story develops and how the characters develop

89
00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:12.776
and so on. I mean, maybe things like that

90
00:05:12.776 --> 00:05:15.436
frustrate me, but at the same time, I understand,

91
00:05:15.446 --> 00:05:17.645
and of course I don't know all the ins

92
00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:20.795
and outs of how this works because I, I,

93
00:05:21.006 --> 00:05:24.885
first of all, I know basically nothing about how

94
00:05:24.885 --> 00:05:27.842
it's done and I I never talked with anyone

95
00:05:27.842 --> 00:05:32.092
about it, but I understand that when producing something

96
00:05:32.092 --> 00:05:35.191
audio visual like a movie or a TV series,

97
00:05:35.242 --> 00:05:39.201
there are certain limitations in terms of the extent

98
00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:42.601
to which you can be faithful to the source

99
00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:46.641
material because there are budget limitations and then you

100
00:05:46.641 --> 00:05:50.361
have a 2 hour or 3 hour movie and

101
00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:53.880
that's the I mean, your limit and if it's

102
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.000
a TV series, maybe it's 40, 50 minute episodes

103
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.279
or something like that, and 10 episodes per season,

104
00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:05.100
something like that. So there's those limitations and then

105
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.679
Um, And then I, I mean, I guess that

106
00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:13.200
there are things that don't bother me as much

107
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.239
if they change, like, for example, uh, I, I

108
00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:21.040
can just tell you about uh certain things that

109
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.559
bothered some people about the Rings of Power. I

110
00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:26.380
mean, the Rings of Power is an adaptation, or

111
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.760
it was supposed to be an adaptation of the

112
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.679
Silmarillion by Tolkien. Uh, IT'S not, it's just an

113
00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:39.140
adaptation of the, basically some of the parts. Some

114
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.369
of, uh, some of, uh, some of the extra

115
00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:47.059
bits of, uh, the Lord of the Rings, because

116
00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:51.989
there's some. There's some uh it has some appendices,

117
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.480
and so what they were able to adapt was

118
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.320
that because they, they couldn't buy the rights for

119
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.239
the Silmarillion and then, uh, I mean, they changed

120
00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:05.350
a little bit uh uh some things in the

121
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.160
plot and they have things that are not part

122
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.309
of the original story, but, but something that really

123
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:14.980
frustrated some people was the fact that, for example,

124
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.130
they made Uh, some elves, or at least one

125
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.940
elf, uh, black, and in Tolkien's story there's no

126
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.970
black elves. I mean, but those kinds of things

127
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.649
don't really bother me as long as the, the

128
00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:34.420
character is interesting and it's faithful to the. I

129
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.619
mean, not so much the physical aspect of the

130
00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:42.209
character, but the what tends to characterize psychologically an

131
00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:44.739
elf or, I mean, for me

132
00:07:44.739 --> 00:07:48.399
that's dealing with mythical creature. What does it matter

133
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.619
if it's mythical creature that has a different, I

134
00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:54.839
don't know, race or ethnicity? I'm, it's, who cares?

135
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.019
I mean, it's invented, right.

136
00:07:57.929 --> 00:08:01.109
Yeah, I think people just, people get very attached

137
00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:04.130
to the way something is in their head, and

138
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.769
I get that, you know, and, and, and I

139
00:08:07.769 --> 00:08:10.529
don't think it's even necessarily that, you know, someone

140
00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:12.679
is a racist and that, that, that bothers them.

141
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.559
I think that it's often that they get so

142
00:08:15.559 --> 00:08:17.880
attached to what something looks like, but no, no,

143
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.630
no, he was supposed to be blonde. You know,

144
00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.750
like, um, years ago when, when Daniel Craig was

145
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.510
first tapped to be James Bond, people were genuinely

146
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.559
upset that he was blonde. You know, which I,

147
00:08:32.308 --> 00:08:35.099
how, how could you possibly care? That doesn't even

148
00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:37.210
matter. What matters is that he can embody the

149
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.659
character, and he did, and he did it really,

150
00:08:38.739 --> 00:08:41.820
really well, and he won people over, but that

151
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.280
was just, that was such a strange sort of

152
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:50.510
um. It Invented it felt like such a, well,

153
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.270
no, it wasn't invented. I think it was real.

154
00:08:52.349 --> 00:08:54.789
I think that people really were upset that he

155
00:08:54.789 --> 00:08:56.789
wasn't gonna be like tall, dark and handsome, you

156
00:08:56.789 --> 00:09:00.989
know, he was gonna be blonde and muscular and

157
00:09:00.989 --> 00:09:04.940
look a little thug-like. Instead of elegant, you know,

158
00:09:05.059 --> 00:09:07.530
which is a real departure from the character, but

159
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:08.159
it worked.

160
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.510
Yeah, and I mean, and then there are times

161
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.909
where it's the authors themselves that that get a

162
00:09:14.909 --> 00:09:17.830
bit frustrated with the adaptations and not so much

163
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.390
the public because still talking about Tolkien, I mean,

164
00:09:21.469 --> 00:09:24.989
I, I assume you watched the Lord of the

165
00:09:24.989 --> 00:09:29.309
Rings, the trilogy, right? Oh yeah. Yeah, so I

166
00:09:29.309 --> 00:09:34.349
mean, if you ask most Tolkien fans, most Lord

167
00:09:34.349 --> 00:09:36.429
of the Rings fans, even the ones that are

168
00:09:36.429 --> 00:09:40.510
really hardcore, most people would say that the adaptation

169
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.390
is at least a 9 or a 10 out

170
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:48.929
of 10, but Christopher Tolkien, Tolkien's son, He didn't

171
00:09:48.929 --> 00:09:52.119
really like it because he thought it seemed like

172
00:09:52.119 --> 00:09:55.210
an adaptation for, he said it seemed like an

173
00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.849
adaptation for teenagers or something like that. It, it

174
00:09:58.849 --> 00:10:02.369
had too much action, uh, and stuff like that,

175
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.409
so, I mean, I, I, I don't know what

176
00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:09.489
all, what Tolkien himself would have thought of it,

177
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.690
but I, I mean, I think at least the.

178
00:10:12.835 --> 00:10:15.474
Christopher Tolkien's, uh, I mean, he's already passed now,

179
00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:19.635
but I took at least his opinion more or

180
00:10:19.635 --> 00:10:23.835
less seriously because he was almost a co-author of

181
00:10:23.835 --> 00:10:26.395
The Lord of the Rings because while Tolkien was

182
00:10:26.395 --> 00:10:30.094
writing it, he gave lots of feedback and then

183
00:10:30.234 --> 00:10:33.294
he finished the Silmari and then he added, he

184
00:10:33.294 --> 00:10:39.460
edited a bunch of works that uh His father

185
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.840
left unpublished, so I mean

186
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.859
he was very close to the material. He was

187
00:10:43.859 --> 00:10:45.719
a part of the material. I mean, he was

188
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.280
in that original tapestry. He wasn't just a critic.

189
00:10:49.659 --> 00:10:52.020
Yeah, well, I know it can be hard to

190
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.539
separate yourself if I think if you're the author

191
00:10:54.539 --> 00:10:59.330
and, and I, I. I can only imagine, right?

192
00:10:59.669 --> 00:11:03.429
Um. I, I think that I would be happy

193
00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:05.150
as long as it was good, even if it

194
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.909
was a bit of a departure, but you never

195
00:11:07.909 --> 00:11:10.390
know. You might watch something and it just seems

196
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:14.859
so alien to you, um. Because you, you know,

197
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.460
you have it in your head that it should

198
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.250
look or, or, uh, feel a certain way, or

199
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.539
a character should be a certain way, and the

200
00:11:22.539 --> 00:11:25.580
fact is people can interpret your work, or some,

201
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.020
you know, or, or an author's work, and that

202
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:32.419
interpretation isn't necessarily wrong, it's genuinely their interpretation, and

203
00:11:33.539 --> 00:11:35.780
that's how they see it. I also, I imagine

204
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.020
that when you're going from, you know, uh, the

205
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.070
text to Uh, whether it's the stage or film

206
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:48.830
or Um, television, you know, our television show. I

207
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.659
do you know what a, are you familiar with

208
00:11:51.659 --> 00:11:53.000
the term a game of telephone?

209
00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:54.840
Uh, YES,

210
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.030
yeah, OK, it, it's, I bet it's kind of

211
00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.479
like a game of telephone because the, all the

212
00:12:00.479 --> 00:12:03.080
different people that touch the project and that are

213
00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.210
talking about the project and brainstorm brainstorming about the

214
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.960
project from, you know, the original source material to

215
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:16.659
it actually, you know. Changing, and, um, getting on

216
00:12:16.659 --> 00:12:19.320
its feet, there are a ton of people who

217
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.020
touch it, from the book to the stage or

218
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.799
the screen. And so, how could it not change

219
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:31.049
some, you know, even if the commitment is fierce

220
00:12:31.049 --> 00:12:33.460
to the original source material, which I believe it

221
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.859
was, um, with the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

222
00:12:36.919 --> 00:12:39.260
I think that the commitment was really fierce to

223
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.960
that source material, but it's still going to change.

224
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:47.229
By necessity and just because that's human nature, you

225
00:12:47.229 --> 00:12:48.909
know, as we kind of put our, put our

226
00:12:48.909 --> 00:12:52.030
finger, our, our fingerprints on things that even if

227
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.679
we're trying to be very loyal to, uh, you

228
00:12:55.679 --> 00:12:57.640
know, a story we love. I think that our,

229
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.150
our, our perceptions become a part of it and,

230
00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:04.799
um, and our own desires for it become a

231
00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:05.340
part of it.

232
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.929
Yeah, I mean, and I guess that's true. I

233
00:13:08.929 --> 00:13:12.530
mean, isn't it, I mean, shouldn't we just expect

234
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:17.010
that two different people would have two different kinds

235
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.570
of interpretation of the same fictional fictional story? I

236
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:24.289
mean, isn't that to be expected? It's like, I

237
00:13:24.289 --> 00:13:27.590
mean, it comes to mind the example of Uh,

238
00:13:27.729 --> 00:13:34.150
the manga Berserk, which was originally created by, by

239
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.849
Kent Kentoroura, and he died back in 2021, and

240
00:13:37.849 --> 00:13:41.809
now, uh, it, uh, there, it's a colleague of

241
00:13:41.809 --> 00:13:44.049
his, uh, a friend and a colleague of his

242
00:13:44.049 --> 00:13:47.710
who's, uh, finishing the story. I mean, it's still.

243
00:13:48.344 --> 00:13:50.835
Getting published, it hasn't finished yet, but there are

244
00:13:50.835 --> 00:13:53.794
some people that say, oh, the, this is no

245
00:13:53.794 --> 00:13:56.414
longer berserk. This is no longer Mura. I mean,

246
00:13:57.315 --> 00:14:02.075
I guess, I mean, do you think that, uh,

247
00:14:02.085 --> 00:14:04.494
uh, I'm missing the name of the new guy,

248
00:14:04.794 --> 00:14:07.734
but do you think that he would be able

249
00:14:07.734 --> 00:14:14.234
to 100% faithfully reproduce Mua's work? I mean, that's,

250
00:14:14.315 --> 00:14:15.585
I guess, impossible.

251
00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:18.869
Yeah, I think that's really hard. And I don't

252
00:14:18.869 --> 00:14:23.479
know it. I think that people have different definitions

253
00:14:23.479 --> 00:14:27.200
of, of faithful too, and first, I don't think

254
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.719
you can 100% reproduce somebody's work. I think that,

255
00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.510
that's just I think that's nearly impossible. And no,

256
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:39.789
I think I'll just say no, that's impossible because

257
00:14:39.789 --> 00:14:44.479
there's always going to be some filter between That

258
00:14:44.479 --> 00:14:48.400
work, the, the original work and, and the adaptation,

259
00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:51.750
right, or the interpretation, it, it, it just by

260
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.719
necessity, just because it's somebody else doing it. I

261
00:14:54.719 --> 00:14:58.340
think that even if, say, the author of the

262
00:14:58.349 --> 00:15:06.940
original work, um, Was hands on involved. And approving

263
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.900
everything. I, I, I, I even think that in

264
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:15.599
those situations, fans of the work. Take issue and

265
00:15:15.599 --> 00:15:18.619
say, you know, this, no, no, no, no, no,

266
00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:20.479
it should have been this way, you know, I

267
00:15:20.479 --> 00:15:22.909
think that, um, you know, I read, uh, I,

268
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.659
I was reading, um, Comments, the comments section of

269
00:15:29.659 --> 00:15:34.890
this uh of I think it was Diana, um,

270
00:15:35.429 --> 00:15:38.349
Gabaldon's Facebook page. She's the author of Outlander, and

271
00:15:38.349 --> 00:15:40.869
it's, I, I, I always find reading the comments

272
00:15:40.869 --> 00:15:44.270
really interesting as an author, right? Um, THAT'S such

273
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.210
a beloved series, and it's also a television series.

274
00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:50.989
And so you have fans of both the books

275
00:15:50.989 --> 00:15:54.059
and the TV series, and also you have fans

276
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.030
who are just fans of the book and just

277
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.900
fans of the TV series all in the comments,

278
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.630
and she has like 700 comments on each post,

279
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.520
you know, I mean, it's unbelievable. But it's always

280
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:12.219
interesting to see how, um, How, well, rigid, I

281
00:16:12.219 --> 00:16:16.809
guess, you know, and, and how really Just stuck

282
00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:21.030
in a certain Idea of how that story should

283
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.950
be, should play out, you know, some, some fans

284
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.869
of the work are, and they'll actually get into

285
00:16:25.869 --> 00:16:28.190
arguments with the author, you know what I mean?

286
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:31.590
And the author will say, well, no, that's actually

287
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.469
not the way it is. Um, I, I think

288
00:16:34.469 --> 00:16:37.869
it's exactly right how they're portraying it on the

289
00:16:37.869 --> 00:16:39.710
TV show, and that's exactly what I had in

290
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:44.880
mind, and, and, and the The fan will argue,

291
00:16:45.229 --> 00:16:49.340
no, it's not. You know what I mean. Which

292
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.840
I, it's just, it's, it's fun and that's interesting

293
00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.849
for me. I, I love comment sections. For that

294
00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:55.859
purpose.

295
00:16:58.979 --> 00:17:02.179
You're probably one of the few people who, I,

296
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.300
I mean, there are many people who read comments,

297
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.180
but there's not many people who like to read

298
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:07.689
comments.

299
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.939
Oh my God, I love reading other people's comments.

300
00:17:09.979 --> 00:17:14.040
I, I, it's, it's a, it's a guilty pleasure.

301
00:17:15.449 --> 00:17:15.608
But,

302
00:17:15.689 --> 00:17:18.329
but, but, but I mean, just imagine for a

303
00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.410
second that someone asked you to adapt one of

304
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:26.729
your books to move your television, uh, uh, I

305
00:17:26.729 --> 00:17:32.709
mean, What if they made changes, what kinds of

306
00:17:32.709 --> 00:17:37.140
things would frustrate you? Quaker, I mean, would it

307
00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:42.939
be if they changed a character's personality, uh, the

308
00:17:42.939 --> 00:17:48.329
way a character develops, uh, a plot, plot points,

309
00:17:48.339 --> 00:17:49.459
or what

310
00:17:49.459 --> 00:17:52.500
exactly? Um, VERY possibly, like I, I think if

311
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.839
they Um, made one of my characters a Mary

312
00:17:56.839 --> 00:18:00.800
Sue, you know, you know that term, right? Um,

313
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.280
THAT would really bother me because I, you know,

314
00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:09.859
I think that. I understand it, because it's, it's

315
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:16.750
hard to make a person's quirks sometimes, um, endearing,

316
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.680
and you want the audience to be endeared by

317
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.630
the character. You want them to be rooting for

318
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:27.260
the character, um. And so I, I, I understand

319
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.890
that wanting to massage the character a little bit,

320
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.260
if, if the character, it does a couple of

321
00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.329
things that are acceptable, uh, on the page because

322
00:18:36.329 --> 00:18:41.589
you can explain their behavior better. Yeah. You know,

323
00:18:41.699 --> 00:18:43.949
and you're actually kind of in the character's head,

324
00:18:44.199 --> 00:18:46.310
sometimes directly because it might be a first person

325
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:50.719
narrative, or indirectly even, you know, you, where the

326
00:18:50.869 --> 00:18:54.349
context is just more complete in the novel, let's

327
00:18:54.349 --> 00:18:58.910
say. So I, I understand why somebody would do

328
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.270
that, but I don't, I, I have a real

329
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:06.010
aversion to Mary Sue's, and so. Um, THAT would

330
00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.089
probably get to me if I, if I thought

331
00:19:08.089 --> 00:19:10.770
my character was just, oh, so right all the

332
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.930
time and always doing the right thing. It's like,

333
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.849
no, we don't always do the right thing. We

334
00:19:14.849 --> 00:19:19.449
don't, even good people do questionable things sometimes, and

335
00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:23.290
they have reasons, you know, and it's interesting to

336
00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.729
show those reasons, even if the reasons you're sitting

337
00:19:26.729 --> 00:19:29.170
back thinking, well, that's a load of BS, you

338
00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:32.349
know what I mean? But sometimes it's not. Sometimes.

339
00:19:34.319 --> 00:19:36.680
You know, within that context, if there's a really

340
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.359
good reason why they did a shitty thing, you

341
00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:39.900
know.

342
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.479
Have you ever read American Psycho, the book, because

343
00:19:44.479 --> 00:19:46.560
there's also the movie, but have you ever read

344
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:46.979
the book?

345
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.839
No, my husband did though, and we've talked about

346
00:19:49.839 --> 00:19:51.760
it. It's so funny cause like there are certain

347
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.640
books that I've read that he hasn't or that

348
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.560
he's read that, um, I haven't, but I feel

349
00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.560
like I've read them because I've discussed them with

350
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.719
him, you know what I mean? American Psycho is

351
00:20:00.719 --> 00:20:01.280
one of them.

352
00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.290
Uh, YEAH, but I was going to say there

353
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.770
are also things that are a little bit, uh,

354
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:13.250
difficult to adapt to, uh, an audio visual medium

355
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:17.709
because for if you read Brett Isanelli's, uh, book,

356
00:20:18.329 --> 00:20:25.170
uh. There are many bits there that are. Uh,

357
00:20:25.369 --> 00:20:29.449
I mean, really extreme in terms of the violence

358
00:20:29.449 --> 00:20:34.010
and very graphic, uh, very, very gory, and I

359
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:38.310
mean, I don't think that. Unless it was one

360
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:43.609
of those movies that. Uh, THAT, that was produced

361
00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:47.869
independently and then eventually would become a cult movie,

362
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.369
uh, with extreme violence, I guess that it wouldn't

363
00:20:51.369 --> 00:20:56.089
be possible for the director of American Psycho to

364
00:20:56.089 --> 00:21:00.209
really adapt those bits because it would be too

365
00:21:00.209 --> 00:21:04.050
much graphically. So I mean there are perhaps parts

366
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:09.300
of the Of the books were with very detailed

367
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:15.540
descriptions of things that really have a very. Uh,

368
00:21:15.579 --> 00:21:20.060
uh, uh, ARE emotionally very impactful in a negative

369
00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.949
way that perhaps are hard to adapt to the,

370
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.000
to the screen. So,

371
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.140
yeah, and also it depends on how you want

372
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.140
to tell the story of American Psycho. If you're,

373
00:21:30.219 --> 00:21:33.880
you know, if you're the, the director and you,

374
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.000
um, You want to get, uh, you know, you

375
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.790
want to focus on the character more, then you

376
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:44.079
might feel that the gore is really distracting, and

377
00:21:44.079 --> 00:21:46.439
you want some of the gore, because, obviously, you

378
00:21:46.439 --> 00:21:49.599
want to demonstrate that this person is capable of

379
00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:53.550
doing really terrible things and And um that's an

380
00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.790
important part of the character, but, you know, gore,

381
00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.430
uh, you know, the gorier you get, I think,

382
00:21:58.469 --> 00:22:00.910
in a movie, the more it becomes about the

383
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:09.089
gore. Yeah, and Uh, it It can be really

384
00:22:09.089 --> 00:22:17.270
difficult then to build characters that people Um People

385
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.949
respond to, you know, and that they're, they care

386
00:22:19.949 --> 00:22:23.790
deeply about because just so much else is going

387
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.910
on and people's heads are getting chopped off and

388
00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:30.099
you know what I mean. It's, it, it, I

389
00:22:30.099 --> 00:22:36.349
mean, that works in something like um I don't

390
00:22:36.349 --> 00:22:41.469
know, the Gore Gore works in, in, in. Like

391
00:22:41.469 --> 00:22:43.790
Game of Thrones kind of stuff, you know, where

392
00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:46.810
you're really, where you're dealing with a time when

393
00:22:47.229 --> 00:22:50.030
it, or a time, you know, it's pretend time,

394
00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.150
but, uh, you know, where there's a lot of

395
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.630
war and, um, and people aren't using guns, they're

396
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.310
using axes and, you know, maces and all this

397
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.660
stuff, uh, because it's isolated, you know, OK, this

398
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:09.319
is happening during a battle. Or, um, or when

399
00:23:09.319 --> 00:23:13.560
someone is being attacked or assassinated and then you

400
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.479
know, you have long stretches of time when people

401
00:23:15.479 --> 00:23:19.260
are just interacting. But in a story like American

402
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.800
Psycho, I mean, just in the title, it's sort

403
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.680
of about what he's doing. And if you spent

404
00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:29.040
the whole time. Focusing on the gore. I'm, I'm

405
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.000
not sure that you would get as invested in

406
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.239
the character as you do when you're, perhaps when

407
00:23:33.239 --> 00:23:35.500
you're reading it, you know, when you have, again,

408
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.650
more context and more access to this person's life

409
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:44.079
and their, their thoughts and their behaviors and, you

410
00:23:44.079 --> 00:23:45.640
know, the way they move through the world.

411
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.119
Yeah, and I guess in terms of violence, I

412
00:23:49.119 --> 00:23:52.140
mean, it makes sense to present a lot of

413
00:23:52.319 --> 00:23:55.800
violence when it has some sort of purpose. Just

414
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.160
like, for example, a moral purpose. I don't know

415
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.900
if you ever watched the movie Come and See,

416
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.599
which is a World War II movie made by

417
00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:10.560
uh in the Soviet Union in 1985. OK, so

418
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.300
there's this movie Come and See and. I mean,

419
00:24:13.339 --> 00:24:17.130
in the, it's an extremely, particularly at a psychological

420
00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:21.739
level, an extremely violent movie, but I mean, and

421
00:24:21.739 --> 00:24:24.260
you can even get a bit sick watching it,

422
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:28.300
it's really extremely violent, but, uh, I mean, it

423
00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:32.180
for me at least it makes sense for it

424
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.579
to be as violent as it is because it's

425
00:24:35.579 --> 00:24:41.300
sort of. Presenting a sort of moral message against

426
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.780
war. I mean, it's presenting war as being awful,

427
00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:51.750
as being really an extreme form of uh. I,

428
00:24:51.829 --> 00:24:54.869
I, I'm in an extreme event in human life

429
00:24:54.869 --> 00:24:58.469
and stuff like that, so, um, I, I guess,

430
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.310
I, I guess that what I'm trying to say

431
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.489
is that for me personally, it makes sense if

432
00:25:03.489 --> 00:25:08.390
the violence they present, even it's really extreme. As

433
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.969
a purpose to it, if, if, if it's just

434
00:25:10.969 --> 00:25:15.650
violence for violence's sake, for violence's sake, uh, I

435
00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.410
mean, I don't know, it doesn't sound as good.

436
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.170
It's, it's, it comes off as a carnival show

437
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.339
then, um, I, you know, I might have seen

438
00:25:22.339 --> 00:25:28.650
Commony. I definitely saw a Soviet era. Um, FILM

439
00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.459
about World War II a few years ago. Um,

440
00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:37.109
MY, both, my two older children were, uh, Russian,

441
00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:39.849
they had double majors also in like Russian language

442
00:25:39.849 --> 00:25:43.010
and literature, and so we would be watching these

443
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:46.020
Russian movies together all the time, but I, I

444
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.930
saw one that I found very, very disturbing, and

445
00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.729
I remember my son warned me, he's like, this

446
00:25:50.729 --> 00:25:53.069
is gonna be a rough ride, so I'm just

447
00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:56.709
letting you know, and it was. I can't remember,

448
00:25:57.089 --> 00:25:59.609
um, what it was called though. It started in

449
00:25:59.609 --> 00:26:03.010
a small village, maybe that was. Is that, yeah,

450
00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:06.140
OK, I've seen it. I've seen it, yes, very

451
00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:10.219
disturbing movie, very violent, awful, and yet really good,

452
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.780
and you do get invested in the characters, very

453
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.430
much so.

454
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.910
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean,

455
00:26:16.989 --> 00:26:19.550
but, but do you agree with that, that, I

456
00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:23.949
mean, uh, what you present in the story, I

457
00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:26.189
mean, not just in terms of violence, but focusing

458
00:26:26.189 --> 00:26:29.579
on violence now, it has to serve a purpose,

459
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:34.829
right? Otherwise it's just, I don't know, violence, pornography

460
00:26:34.829 --> 00:26:35.150
or

461
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.550
something like that. Definitely. And by the way, I

462
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:41.270
love writing violence, and it's hard. It's very, very

463
00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.310
hard. I like writing action and I like writing

464
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.910
violence. I, I mean, I, I don't know how,

465
00:26:47.199 --> 00:26:49.390
how much of my stuff you've read, but it's

466
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.469
certainly not focused on that. But there, there are

467
00:26:52.469 --> 00:26:55.489
spurts of it, I, that I think I use

468
00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:59.660
judiciously in my In my stories, because I feel

469
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:03.930
like that, I don't know, that that. That I,

470
00:27:04.099 --> 00:27:08.459
I, what I do find interesting, the, the juxtaposition

471
00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:12.670
between like, You're going along, and even if things

472
00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:16.420
are ramping up and stuff is happening around you

473
00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.150
that, that, um, it is ominous, you know, and,

474
00:27:20.229 --> 00:27:25.569
and, and frightening, then Wham, when the violence hits,

475
00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.939
I feel like it's very, very powerful. And it's,

476
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.650
you know, I liken it to, if you're walking

477
00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.459
down the street and you feel like somebody's following

478
00:27:32.459 --> 00:27:38.130
you. That's, and that's. And, and you're, you know,

479
00:27:38.209 --> 00:27:41.780
the tension increases, but, and hopefully it would never

480
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.660
get to this, but then when the person does

481
00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.140
like pull a knife or a gun on you

482
00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.739
and says, give me your purse or whatever it

483
00:27:46.739 --> 00:27:49.280
is that they want, you know, that's the big

484
00:27:49.819 --> 00:27:52.130
reveal. Yeah.

485
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:57.130
So let me ask you another thing. When it

486
00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:02.359
sometimes people get a little bit frustrated. Uh, WHEN

487
00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:06.619
they are expecting characters to act a particular kind

488
00:28:06.619 --> 00:28:09.459
of way or to react a particular kind of

489
00:28:09.459 --> 00:28:12.689
way to something that happens in the story, uh,

490
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.540
and they don't, uh, uh, but, but I mean,

491
00:28:16.689 --> 00:28:20.290
When, when is it that, or how do we

492
00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:24.729
esta do you establish the difference between a character

493
00:28:24.729 --> 00:28:30.130
acting out of character and they acting in the

494
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:36.439
unexpected way uh due to character development? I mean,

495
00:28:36.609 --> 00:28:39.689
how, how do you establish that difference?

496
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:52.760
That's a really hard question. Um. For me, when

497
00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.599
I feel like something is, um, artificial, it's usually

498
00:28:57.599 --> 00:29:05.729
because I See Something changes and I watch it,

499
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:11.550
let's say, change from the character. You know, maybe

500
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.609
the way the character was written in the novel

501
00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:19.209
to A point of view that the storyteller, whether

502
00:29:19.209 --> 00:29:21.329
it's the director or the showrunner or whatever it

503
00:29:21.329 --> 00:29:24.650
is, um, is really attached to and wants to

504
00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:29.150
superimpose onto that character. Maybe to tell, maybe to

505
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:32.130
make a moral or political point, you know, um.

506
00:29:32.849 --> 00:29:35.079
That's when I usually sort of cringe and I

507
00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:37.699
think, well, that's not right, you know, that's not

508
00:29:37.839 --> 00:29:40.079
necessarily how the character would see the world, and

509
00:29:40.079 --> 00:29:43.439
it's maybe wasn't in the original source material, or

510
00:29:43.439 --> 00:29:46.280
if, like, this screenplay or whatever it is, was

511
00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.140
the original source material and it's an original screenplay,

512
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.979
and, and that happens, it's, again, it's usually because

513
00:29:53.349 --> 00:29:57.040
the, the writer or whoever it is who's in

514
00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:04.229
charge of the storytelling process, ultimately, um, It makes

515
00:30:04.229 --> 00:30:07.349
a decision that kind of happens outside the character

516
00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.900
if that makes sense. And that I don't like.

517
00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.229
I mean, I, I think you and I've had

518
00:30:13.229 --> 00:30:16.969
this discussion in the past, but I, when, whenever

519
00:30:16.969 --> 00:30:20.619
I've I, I've seen this in my own work

520
00:30:20.619 --> 00:30:24.290
when I have, um, whenever I've decided to write

521
00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:27.780
a real event into a work of fiction, even

522
00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:31.260
if it's like appropriate for the time period and

523
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.589
it, it, it stays, uh, true to the event

524
00:30:34.589 --> 00:30:39.130
and the event would belong in that situation, it's

525
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:44.390
interesting how, um, If anyone is, anytime a reader

526
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.790
has called out, you know, this didn't seem authentic

527
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:51.829
to me, it's always when I wove a real

528
00:30:51.829 --> 00:30:56.329
event into a work of fiction. Which is kind

529
00:30:56.329 --> 00:30:58.290
of funny, because I'll be like, I don't think

530
00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.689
that happened. I'm like, well, actually, that's the only

531
00:31:00.689 --> 00:31:03.449
thing that really did happen in this whole story,

532
00:31:03.569 --> 00:31:05.689
you know, and, and I put it in there,

533
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:07.280
not to make a point or anything like that,

534
00:31:07.369 --> 00:31:09.130
but because I thought it would be interesting color,

535
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.670
you know, what, because it, it was real, if

536
00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:17.489
something that really did occur within the sort of

537
00:31:17.489 --> 00:31:19.410
theater that I'm writing in, you know what I

538
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:27.310
mean? But somehow, um, They smelled something amiss, and

539
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.890
they were right. No, they weren't right that it

540
00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.250
didn't happen, that it wouldn't really happen, cause it

541
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:37.930
did, but they were right that I Clearly didn't

542
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:41.459
finesse it enough, or I wasn't somehow able to

543
00:31:42.719 --> 00:31:47.109
Um, make it seamless. Yeah. So, and I think

544
00:31:47.109 --> 00:31:50.349
that, I think more often it happens that someone

545
00:31:50.349 --> 00:31:52.229
is trying to make a point, that a writer

546
00:31:52.229 --> 00:31:54.569
really wants to make a point with the character,

547
00:31:54.619 --> 00:31:57.829
and, and they don't realize how far they've stepped

548
00:31:57.829 --> 00:31:59.430
outside of the character to make that point.

549
00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.930
Right, I, I mean, but it's complicated, right, because,

550
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:09.260
uh, I mean, sometimes, I guess that there are

551
00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:14.030
times where the, the writer or the creator just

552
00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:17.510
does a bad job of it and raps just

553
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.349
makes the character do this or that or acting

554
00:32:20.349 --> 00:32:23.790
this or that way. Just to serve the plot,

555
00:32:23.969 --> 00:32:26.890
because it's convenient or something like that, but there

556
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:31.530
are other times where people, the readers or people

557
00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.650
who are following the story in some way, get

558
00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:40.270
frustrated because a character might act. Out of character,

559
00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:42.829
but it uh it is something, it is simply

560
00:32:42.829 --> 00:32:47.060
a matter of, uh, they, of them changing their

561
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:51.569
own behavior in particular ways because of character development,

562
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:56.430
because of something they might have experienced or Um,

563
00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.000
something that might have happened in their, I mean,

564
00:33:00.099 --> 00:33:03.079
in the story, of course, that make them change

565
00:33:03.079 --> 00:33:05.680
in ways. I mean, and then it can be

566
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.599
in a way that makes sense or in a

567
00:33:07.599 --> 00:33:10.760
way that doesn't make much sense, but I mean,

568
00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:15.300
it's complicated, I guess, to thread that line between

569
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.900
showing a character that is in a plausible way.

570
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:25.410
Uh, DEVELOPING and a character that is just behaving

571
00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.339
out of character, I guess.

572
00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.069
Uh, YEAH, it, it, it, it, it does. It

573
00:33:30.069 --> 00:33:31.699
takes a lot of skill to do that and

574
00:33:31.699 --> 00:33:34.630
a lot of thought, and sometimes maybe there isn't

575
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.349
enough time to think it through, and there's real

576
00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:39.949
deadline pressure, so I, you know, I can understand

577
00:33:39.949 --> 00:33:42.869
how even, you know, a really talented storyteller can

578
00:33:42.869 --> 00:33:47.630
make that. Mistake, right? And can, and not make

579
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.189
it seamless. I mean, I, I think the, what

580
00:33:50.189 --> 00:33:53.349
bothers me most is when a character just like

581
00:33:53.349 --> 00:33:58.140
turns evil, you know what I mean. And you

582
00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.579
don't see the process, or it goes crazy, and

583
00:34:01.579 --> 00:34:03.699
you don't see that process either. They seemed like

584
00:34:03.699 --> 00:34:06.979
a, like a reasonable person, and then suddenly, you

585
00:34:06.979 --> 00:34:10.850
know, um, they, they started behaving in ways that,

586
00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:14.780
that you as a reader or viewer are sitting

587
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.719
back thinking, What happened there?

588
00:34:18.438 --> 00:34:20.188
I, I mean, I guess, I guess that's some

589
00:34:20.188 --> 00:34:26.750
of the most interesting instances where the creator has

590
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:32.649
to suddenly make a character be a a a

591
00:34:32.649 --> 00:34:36.070
person that is completely different from what she's seen

592
00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:41.110
this in crime stories because I mean you are

593
00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.668
out to find who who who committed the crime.

594
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.228
Crime and I mean you have to be careful

595
00:34:47.228 --> 00:34:50.728
to drop some subtle hints here and there that

596
00:34:50.728 --> 00:34:57.050
perhaps the true criminal is that sort of person,

597
00:34:57.129 --> 00:34:59.419
that sort of person who would commit a crime,

598
00:34:59.489 --> 00:35:02.229
but at the same time they're trying to hide

599
00:35:02.889 --> 00:35:03.719
that they did it.

600
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:06.050
So, but that's kind of, that's a little different

601
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:09.149
though, because in that case that person's always been

602
00:35:09.409 --> 00:35:12.360
the criminal, you know, the evildoer they're, but they're

603
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.570
pretending they're not. And so the, the hints that

604
00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:18.679
you need to drop, for one, is that they're

605
00:35:18.679 --> 00:35:23.139
pretending, but there's a certain You give a certain

606
00:35:23.139 --> 00:35:28.050
grace, I think, to, uh, that story then, and,

607
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.820
and the way that character unfolds, because you understand,

608
00:35:30.899 --> 00:35:33.659
oh, that person was pretending to be a nice

609
00:35:33.659 --> 00:35:36.979
person, but really all along, they were the bad

610
00:35:36.979 --> 00:35:39.820
person who would kill you, right? It's, I think

611
00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.580
that what, what is tough is when a character

612
00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:47.080
really does either turn evil. Suddenly, you know, or

613
00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:51.550
turn good, suddenly. They were like this terrible evil

614
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.429
doer, and then suddenly they're like, well, I have

615
00:35:53.429 --> 00:35:56.270
seen the light. Now, maybe you can do that

616
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:58.469
really cleverly, like, you know, with the, the sun,

617
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:00.429
the conversion of Saint Paul, but then there was

618
00:36:00.429 --> 00:36:02.929
a supernatural element to that, you know, where God

619
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.820
knocked, you know, visited Paul and knocked him off

620
00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:10.300
his horse, you know. Um, HE wasn't just riding

621
00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.739
along thinking, you know, I just slaughtered a village,

622
00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.780
but that was a terrible thing to do. I'm

623
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.379
going to be good now. You know what I

624
00:36:17.379 --> 00:36:23.399
mean? That's, that, that just doesn't. It just doesn't

625
00:36:23.399 --> 00:36:24.300
work for me. Yeah,

626
00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:27.820
maybe, maybe it took some psychedelics and had a

627
00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.300
mystic experience,

628
00:36:30.379 --> 00:36:32.939
you know, there has to be some reason then

629
00:36:32.939 --> 00:36:36.879
if you're gonna have a very sudden. Um, TRANSFORMATION,

630
00:36:36.959 --> 00:36:39.199
and they do happen, you know, I'm not saying

631
00:36:39.199 --> 00:36:42.439
that a character can't have a sudden transformation, or

632
00:36:42.439 --> 00:36:45.479
even a human being can't. There's certainly evidence of

633
00:36:45.479 --> 00:36:47.959
that, um, in, in terms of characters of it

634
00:36:47.959 --> 00:36:51.580
being done well, right? Or, and, you know, it

635
00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:56.080
it exists, but doing it plausibly, I think, is,

636
00:36:56.189 --> 00:37:02.489
is what is a big trick because, um, It's,

637
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:06.699
otherwise it just looks like. A trick on the

638
00:37:06.699 --> 00:37:10.739
page, you know, that 11 moment the character is

639
00:37:10.739 --> 00:37:13.979
relatively reasonable and then the next that they've gone

640
00:37:13.979 --> 00:37:18.340
completely off the rails for no earthly reason. Except

641
00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:18.719
you know, you know,

642
00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:23.100
yeah, but you know it's interesting because just the

643
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:26.659
other day I was thinking because first when I

644
00:37:26.659 --> 00:37:30.620
thought about talking with you about the topic of

645
00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:34.100
being out of character versus character development, I was

646
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.639
thinking that this is something that if it's done.

647
00:37:37.875 --> 00:37:43.185
Wrong, it's something that frustrates people, uh, when they're

648
00:37:43.185 --> 00:37:46.705
reading or watching a story, but actually I was

649
00:37:46.705 --> 00:37:50.745
thinking that it also bothers people when it happens

650
00:37:50.745 --> 00:37:55.084
in real life when people act in ways that

651
00:37:55.504 --> 00:37:59.504
uh are unexpected, that are out of character, so

652
00:37:59.504 --> 00:38:03.850
to say. Uh, AND, uh, particularly when it's in

653
00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:07.870
ways that people find negative or that have negative,

654
00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:12.389
uh, consequences, and uh, people, and I mean people

655
00:38:12.929 --> 00:38:18.139
are more than one dimensional. People are complex and

656
00:38:18.139 --> 00:38:22.889
perhaps people behave in different ways with different people

657
00:38:22.889 --> 00:38:27.189
in different contexts, and perhaps if someone would see

658
00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:31.860
a friend, uh. I, I don't know, interacting with

659
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.669
someone they interact with in a different way. They

660
00:38:34.669 --> 00:38:36.909
would think that that he or she is a

661
00:38:36.909 --> 00:38:40.270
hypocrite or something like that, but they're really not.

662
00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:43.550
They're just, I mean, we just tend to behave

663
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:48.790
differently with different people in different contexts, but um,

664
00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:54.270
sometimes people really don't like when other people do

665
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:55.810
unexpected things.

666
00:38:56.429 --> 00:38:59.389
You know, I, I think that's, yes, and I

667
00:38:59.389 --> 00:39:04.469
think that's the problem, uh, with, uh, People who

668
00:39:04.469 --> 00:39:07.330
tend to write fiction as if they're court reporters.

669
00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:11.860
You know what I mean? And, and just, you

670
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:16.139
know, when I've, when I've worked. Helping people edit

671
00:39:16.139 --> 00:39:19.600
their work, helping people edit their, their, their writing,

672
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:24.199
um. Sometimes you'll, you'll be talking to a, a

673
00:39:24.199 --> 00:39:26.479
writer and they'll say, but that, that would really

674
00:39:26.479 --> 00:39:29.239
happen. I knew someone who did that, who behaved

675
00:39:29.239 --> 00:39:31.120
like that. And coming back to like what I

676
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.820
said when I tried to insert something real and

677
00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.780
say, well, that may very well be. Um, BUT

678
00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.399
when you're Writing a work of fiction, by and

679
00:39:42.399 --> 00:39:46.320
large, you have to explain that character's behavior in

680
00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:49.040
a way that maybe you, you don't get that

681
00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.399
explanation in real life because, like you said, you

682
00:39:52.399 --> 00:39:57.870
don't have access to, um, necessarily to why they're

683
00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:00.800
behaving in this way, uh, you know, why they

684
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.030
are, you know, going along, say, with a point

685
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.040
of view that you know, they don't agree with

686
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.629
when they're talking to a certain person, you know,

687
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:14.080
or, um. You know, whatever the circumstance might be,

688
00:40:14.239 --> 00:40:18.840
you know, sometimes things seem very abrupt in real

689
00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:23.399
life because we don't have a vision into a

690
00:40:23.399 --> 00:40:27.100
person's complete life or their thoughts. And, but in

691
00:40:27.199 --> 00:40:29.909
fiction, you do kind of have vision into it.

692
00:40:29.959 --> 00:40:32.780
You have to, because it's your job to make.

693
00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:40.179
That character's behavior, um, relatable and real feeling. You

694
00:40:40.179 --> 00:40:43.219
know, even if you're writing a crazy supernatural story

695
00:40:43.219 --> 00:40:45.860
that is so clearly not real and is full

696
00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.379
of magic realism, you have to make it feel

697
00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:51.979
real, otherwise, it, it's not satisfying. You have to

698
00:40:51.979 --> 00:40:57.560
believe that, um, You know, this vampire or werewolf

699
00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.760
or whatever would behave this way or or magician

700
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.719
or whatever it is that that um That you're

701
00:41:04.719 --> 00:41:07.530
writing about, they, they're, it has to be grounded

702
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:12.330
in, in reality and in how we interpret reality

703
00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:13.989
for it to be effective, I think.

704
00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:18.209
I mean, even when you're writing fantasy or something

705
00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:21.330
like that, uh, I guess that, of course, you're

706
00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:25.449
free to create your own rules, the rules under

707
00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:28.885
which the story you're creating or the The universe

708
00:41:28.885 --> 00:41:34.304
you're creating operates under, but you have to stick

709
00:41:34.304 --> 00:41:38.064
to the rules, otherwise, I mean, it, otherwise people

710
00:41:38.064 --> 00:41:40.425
get bothered as well because all that shouldn't have

711
00:41:40.425 --> 00:41:44.024
happened. I mean, these are the rules. You've decided

712
00:41:44.024 --> 00:41:46.824
on these rules, you have to follow your own

713
00:41:46.824 --> 00:41:49.989
rules, right? I mean, it's like when In Shonan

714
00:41:49.989 --> 00:41:53.229
manga, I mean, Shonan manga is basically manga for

715
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:57.070
uh teenagers, adolescents. It involves a lot, a lot

716
00:41:57.070 --> 00:42:00.030
of fighting and stuff like that, and it usually

717
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:03.790
has power systems for the characters. I mean, if

718
00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:07.889
one of the characters suddenly breaks the power system,

719
00:42:08.389 --> 00:42:11.149
people get bothered because, oh, that shouldn't have happened

720
00:42:11.149 --> 00:42:14.810
there, come on, right? I mean, you are, you

721
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:17.399
are free to create your own rules, but you

722
00:42:17.399 --> 00:42:20.290
have to keep them in mind, in mind when

723
00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:21.370
writing your story.

724
00:42:22.159 --> 00:42:27.110
Definitely, and you know, I I think one of

725
00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:31.679
the things that People have a difficult time, um,

726
00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:35.969
regulating, let's say, when they're writing, writers, uh, that

727
00:42:35.969 --> 00:42:44.260
I've noticed is when, um, They are really kind

728
00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:49.459
of personally invested in a certain, uh, in a

729
00:42:49.459 --> 00:42:53.060
certain point of view, you know, and, you know,

730
00:42:53.459 --> 00:42:59.590
they They, they maybe they, they pro project more

731
00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:03.030
onto behaviors than what a reader might perceive, if

732
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:04.719
that makes sense. I mean, to give you an

733
00:43:04.719 --> 00:43:10.780
example, uh, He I'm just making this up. Um,

734
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:14.949
IF a guy is being dismissive towards a female

735
00:43:14.949 --> 00:43:21.760
character. And then the um that that guy character

736
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:28.500
gets treated abominably by another character or gets killed

737
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.360
and everyone's just like sort of like he deserved

738
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.020
it, you know what I mean? AND to try

739
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.820
to explain to the writer, but to a reader,

740
00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.379
he really didn't deserve it. He made a dismissive

741
00:43:38.379 --> 00:43:40.830
comment and you chopped his head off. You know,

742
00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.790
I mean, I'm being, you know, I'm, I'm being

743
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:49.530
hyperbolic, but, you know, People do that because they,

744
00:43:49.709 --> 00:43:53.040
they're projecting their own experience onto that person, and,

745
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:57.179
and that one character who say, made the dismissive

746
00:43:57.179 --> 00:44:01.659
comment, um, all the reader saw or read was

747
00:44:01.659 --> 00:44:04.739
that dismissive comment, whereas the writer had a whole,

748
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.610
like, that was just the tip of the iceberg,

749
00:44:06.659 --> 00:44:08.419
and then there was the whole bottom part of

750
00:44:08.419 --> 00:44:12.219
the iceberg for the writer of resentment and things

751
00:44:12.219 --> 00:44:14.659
that they'd seen and experienced that they were projecting

752
00:44:14.659 --> 00:44:16.975
onto that character, but That didn't make its way

753
00:44:16.975 --> 00:44:19.294
onto the page. It was just that one dismissive

754
00:44:19.294 --> 00:44:21.215
comment, you know, and then the guy got, you

755
00:44:21.215 --> 00:44:24.495
know, skinned alive or whatever, and, and, and it

756
00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:26.895
was treated as if that was just desserts, you

757
00:44:26.895 --> 00:44:29.415
know what I mean? It's, it's stuff like that,

758
00:44:29.445 --> 00:44:31.655
that I think is, can be really hard for

759
00:44:31.655 --> 00:44:35.774
people to regulate, because, um, I, I think what

760
00:44:35.774 --> 00:44:41.320
is, uh, Maybe not intuitive about the writing process

761
00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.159
for people, is just how much you have to

762
00:44:44.159 --> 00:44:46.360
be able to step back from it. Because it,

763
00:44:46.439 --> 00:44:49.550
it's such a personal process, and people view it

764
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:51.780
as so personal that, oh my God, when you,

765
00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.199
you know, I, I mean, I remember talking to

766
00:44:54.199 --> 00:44:57.540
someone and they asked me if I Fantasize about

767
00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.659
my characters, the way one might, if you watch,

768
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.060
say, a television show or you read someone else's

769
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.580
work and you develop your own fan fiction in

770
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:12.040
your head, and I said, I never do. And

771
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.199
they were like, what do you mean you never

772
00:45:13.199 --> 00:45:15.320
do? You, you must love these characters, you know,

773
00:45:15.399 --> 00:45:16.800
you made them up, you wrote them, and I'm

774
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.719
like, I never I never ever fantasize about my

775
00:45:19.719 --> 00:45:21.439
own characters. I mean just never. The only time

776
00:45:21.439 --> 00:45:23.239
I fantasize about them is when I'm trying to

777
00:45:23.239 --> 00:45:25.520
figure out what they're gonna do next, but I

778
00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:30.580
don't think, that's not a fantasy, that's That's a

779
00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.620
lot more strategic than a fantasy. A fantasy is

780
00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:35.100
a lot more organic, right? And it, it caters

781
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:39.739
to your own desires, and, um, it's fantasies are

782
00:45:39.739 --> 00:45:45.090
rarely appropriate. To put into your work, too, because

783
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:48.949
they're, because they're so personal, and rarely do they

784
00:45:48.949 --> 00:45:51.030
resonate with other people the way it might, the,

785
00:45:51.139 --> 00:45:53.429
the way they might resonate with you. Because they're

786
00:45:53.429 --> 00:45:56.149
so particular to you and what your needs might

787
00:45:56.149 --> 00:45:59.959
be at that moment. But, um, But I always,

788
00:46:01.219 --> 00:46:02.530
I, I always try to explain that. I'm like,

789
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.780
no, no, no, you actually, in order to, to

790
00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:08.050
write effectively, most of the time, not always, there's

791
00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:10.780
always an exception, but most of the time, you

792
00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.780
actually have to have quite a bit of distance

793
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.020
from your work. Because you also have to be

794
00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:17.020
able to kill your darlings, like they say, you

795
00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.379
have to be able to go back to your

796
00:46:18.379 --> 00:46:21.219
work, and a lot of times take out things

797
00:46:21.219 --> 00:46:23.739
that You might feel, oh, I did such a

798
00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:25.659
good job on that, you know what I mean?

799
00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:29.139
Or, oh, that would make such a beautiful scene

800
00:46:29.139 --> 00:46:30.659
if it ever made it into a movie or

801
00:46:30.659 --> 00:46:33.060
whatever. There are so many, you know, different ways

802
00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:36.260
that you might perceive something that you've written and

803
00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:40.129
become so attached to it. Um, THAT it's hard

804
00:46:40.129 --> 00:46:43.370
to To take it out when it really does

805
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:46.110
not belong and

806
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:49.199
drives. Yeah, so I, I guess I, I've never

807
00:46:49.199 --> 00:46:54.530
asked you this before, but when you're developing a

808
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:57.929
story for a new book, how do you do

809
00:46:57.929 --> 00:47:00.850
it? I mean, what do you think about and

810
00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:02.929
how much do you plan? Do you think, do

811
00:47:02.929 --> 00:47:08.189
you think about themes, the plot, the, the characters,

812
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:13.580
specific events? I mean, I've heard. Uh, AUTHORS saying

813
00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:18.929
that, for example, George RR Martin said that what

814
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.250
made him create uh Song of Ice and Fire,

815
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.439
or a Song of Ice and Fire was that

816
00:47:25.439 --> 00:47:28.580
he had a dream about a wolf, and then

817
00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:33.149
it was from that dream that he started, uh,

818
00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:37.219
building, uh, uh, doing his world building, let's say,

819
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:41.610
and Uh, Aichiro, the, the creator of One Piece,

820
00:47:41.949 --> 00:47:44.709
said that from the very beginning, he had the

821
00:47:44.709 --> 00:47:49.469
ending of the story already set, and of course,

822
00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:52.449
people who follow One Piece like me, we're all

823
00:47:52.959 --> 00:47:57.429
excited to eventually know what that ending will be

824
00:47:57.429 --> 00:48:01.030
like, but I mean, how, how do you plan

825
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:02.110
things, basically?

826
00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:08.429
Um, uh, THAT'S evolved over the years, um. I

827
00:48:08.429 --> 00:48:11.750
used to plan very little. I was what writers

828
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:15.540
call a pantser. Um, THERE are pants and plotters.

829
00:48:15.629 --> 00:48:17.810
Pantsers like flying by the seat of their pants

830
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.949
and plotters both plotting, right? Um, I used to

831
00:48:20.949 --> 00:48:22.750
be much more of a pantser, and I would

832
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:26.909
start kind of like what the George RR Martin

833
00:48:26.909 --> 00:48:31.179
vein, maybe I had. An image in my head,

834
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.639
whether it was from a dream or a story

835
00:48:33.639 --> 00:48:36.750
that, you know, one of my, my family members,

836
00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:39.310
my grandmother, say, told me, and I found that

837
00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:43.580
image really powerful and, um, started writing a story

838
00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:47.939
around it. And, uh, you know, earlier, like definitely

839
00:48:47.939 --> 00:48:52.889
in my first few novels, I was not, um,

840
00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:58.260
thinking much further ahead than the next chapter. And

841
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:03.570
now I I pretty much plot out a novel

842
00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:05.530
before, I mean, that doesn't mean it's not gonna

843
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:07.040
change as I'm writing cause I might be like,

844
00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:09.570
oh, no, that, that's not gonna work, or, oh,

845
00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:12.010
I have a better idea, right? But I, I

846
00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:15.300
plot out a whole novel beforehand, and it's funny,

847
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:18.510
I realized I was talking to my partner Janet,

848
00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:24.870
my business partner, Janet, and um, I, I was

849
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:27.889
telling her how much I realized that that I'm

850
00:49:27.889 --> 00:49:35.199
like, haunted by places after I've been there and

851
00:49:36.639 --> 00:49:39.120
I, you know, I wrote my Cold War thrillers

852
00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.169
after I left Eastern Europe. Um, I, cause I

853
00:49:43.169 --> 00:49:46.320
was just I, I would have never even occurred

854
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.709
to me to start writing them while I was

855
00:49:47.709 --> 00:49:50.280
there. It just wasn't on my mind that that's

856
00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.080
not what I would have been writing about at

857
00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:55.919
all. But as soon as I'd been, I was

858
00:49:55.919 --> 00:49:58.159
back in the US, suddenly I started thinking about

859
00:49:58.159 --> 00:50:04.790
my experience there. And with, um, My sort of

860
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:07.879
romanticsy series, Breath that, you know, takes place in

861
00:50:07.879 --> 00:50:11.580
the desert, ironically. Um, I wrote that from Virginia,

862
00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:13.860
and that was completely like a flight of fancy,

863
00:50:13.949 --> 00:50:16.189
right? And then I ended up moving to the

864
00:50:16.189 --> 00:50:18.310
desert, and what did I do when I moved

865
00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:21.090
to the desert? I wrote a whole story that

866
00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:25.260
takes place in Appalachian, Virginia. Yeah. Which is where

867
00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.939
I'd spent the last 20 years, and it's a

868
00:50:27.939 --> 00:50:32.899
horror story. Um, AND a gothic romance kind of,

869
00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:36.439
and so, I, I, I, I tend to kind

870
00:50:36.439 --> 00:50:39.159
of get haunted in that way, and, and maybe

871
00:50:39.159 --> 00:50:44.610
that's just. My way of doing things, I don't

872
00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:45.030
know.

873
00:50:46.159 --> 00:50:49.199
But uh how much of it do you plan

874
00:50:49.199 --> 00:50:51.510
to have? I, I mean, because, because I know

875
00:50:52.169 --> 00:50:54.929
all of it. Now I plan all of it

876
00:50:54.929 --> 00:50:58.620
ahead. It makes, I've, I've found that, like, I,

877
00:50:58.699 --> 00:51:02.560
I just work a lot faster and it's, it

878
00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.540
generates ideas for me to have an idea of

879
00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.620
where I'm going. And like I said, I might.

880
00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:12.040
Change where I'm going. I mean, I just did

881
00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.790
that recently. I've started writing the second book in

882
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:20.120
this Appalachian folklore, and, um, the way it The

883
00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:23.040
the way I was gonna plot it completely changed

884
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.580
when I came up with a new idea, but

885
00:51:25.719 --> 00:51:29.159
I replotted it, you know what I mean? And

886
00:51:29.159 --> 00:51:35.699
so, which is not something I did. Um, I,

887
00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:37.860
I mean, I kept, I was doing it incrementally

888
00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:39.860
more and more, but now I, you know, with

889
00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:43.979
this new series, I, I'm officially a plotter and

890
00:51:43.979 --> 00:51:45.139
not a pantsr anymore.

891
00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:50.590
Mm. Yeah, but no, because I was wondering. Uh,

892
00:51:50.669 --> 00:51:55.169
I mean, it's interesting people, different people have different

893
00:51:55.169 --> 00:51:59.830
ways of creating stories because, and, uh, I was

894
00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:05.310
wondering to what extent doing things, uh, uh, planning

895
00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:11.729
less can have some risks in terms of contradicting

896
00:52:11.949 --> 00:52:15.750
some of your previous story later and things like

897
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:19.199
that, because, for example, Ichiro of the and I,

898
00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.159
I mean, I, I guess he does a great

899
00:52:21.159 --> 00:52:25.040
work when it comes to uh dealing with new

900
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.419
elements that he adds to his own story because

901
00:52:28.959 --> 00:52:33.090
I learned recently that, OK, so there's the main

902
00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:37.850
character Luffy, and then initially he planned on what

903
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:42.020
would be perhaps a 500 chapter manga, still a

904
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.409
very long manga, but much shorter than what it

905
00:52:45.409 --> 00:52:49.729
already is. It's already on chapter 1140 or 50,

906
00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:53.169
something like that. And so, but he, he had

907
00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:56.489
planned that Luffy would fight the emperors of the

908
00:52:56.489 --> 00:52:59.344
sea, and then apart from the emperor. Yeah, the,

909
00:52:59.435 --> 00:53:04.334
the warlords, and then just he said that he

910
00:53:04.334 --> 00:53:07.495
had what he calls the supernova, that is the

911
00:53:08.274 --> 00:53:12.764
the pirates that began traveling the seas the same

912
00:53:12.764 --> 00:53:15.534
time Luffy did that are part of his generation.

913
00:53:16.185 --> 00:53:21.625
He added them just the, the same chapter that

914
00:53:21.625 --> 00:53:24.625
he had the idea of adding them, so I

915
00:53:24.625 --> 00:53:27.344
mean it could have gone really wrong and for,

916
00:53:27.485 --> 00:53:31.199
for some. In, uh, for some reason it didn't,

917
00:53:31.429 --> 00:53:34.290
or at least the story seems very consistent, so.

918
00:53:34.949 --> 00:53:37.389
I, I mean, I was wondering how much you

919
00:53:37.389 --> 00:53:41.270
really have to plan for the story to end

920
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:42.570
up looking good.

921
00:53:43.229 --> 00:53:46.270
I, I think that one way or another, uh,

922
00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:50.500
if you don't. Plan it, at least partly upfront,

923
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:56.729
um, you will have to You have a lot

924
00:53:56.729 --> 00:53:59.610
more discipline in the editing process to make sure

925
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:03.389
that you have, you know, connected all the dots.

926
00:54:04.129 --> 00:54:07.050
Because, you know, when you're adding elements, which I

927
00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:09.090
still do, even if I plan something out, like

928
00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:13.729
I said, I completely changed, um, a, a significant

929
00:54:13.729 --> 00:54:16.929
element of the second book in this, um, Moon

930
00:54:16.929 --> 00:54:22.080
Witch series that I'm writing. And it I, I

931
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:27.979
Just replotted it, because otherwise, if I had, if

932
00:54:27.979 --> 00:54:29.899
I, at this point, if I write by the

933
00:54:29.899 --> 00:54:32.860
seat of my pants, I don't want to be

934
00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.939
doing as much work on the back end as

935
00:54:34.939 --> 00:54:38.419
I've done in the past. Um, I want a

936
00:54:38.419 --> 00:54:41.219
more disciplined structure, and this is probably the most

937
00:54:41.219 --> 00:54:45.479
disciplined I've been. Um, FROM the, you know, on

938
00:54:45.479 --> 00:54:48.709
the front end. IF anything that I've ever written,

939
00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:50.790
but I, I, I, I think I used to

940
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:53.189
believe, and maybe there was some truth to it

941
00:54:53.189 --> 00:54:59.340
then, that if I put too much. Um Emphasis

942
00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:04.139
on plotting. That I, I wouldn't, um, that it

943
00:55:04.139 --> 00:55:07.830
would strangle the story. I think probably a lot

944
00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:10.620
of pans believe that, and I definitely believe that,

945
00:55:10.629 --> 00:55:14.110
and I don't believe that anymore. I actually think

946
00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:18.110
it works better and that you're still welcome to

947
00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:20.310
add surprises and to be surprised by your own

948
00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:23.530
imagination and decide that you're going to make significant

949
00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:27.510
changes. Now, those significant changes, you got to think

950
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:33.129
them through, but, um, I, I really like the

951
00:55:33.129 --> 00:55:40.800
discipline now of Having to think through. An entire

952
00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.399
novel or story arc before, um, before I sit

953
00:55:44.399 --> 00:55:47.399
down and it, it energizes me, and I, I

954
00:55:47.399 --> 00:55:49.919
did not think it would when I was starting

955
00:55:49.919 --> 00:55:52.360
out. I thought that it would strangle me.

956
00:55:53.899 --> 00:55:56.340
Yeah, I, I mean, because I was asking you

957
00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:59.050
that, I mean, how much someone needs to plan,

958
00:55:59.179 --> 00:56:03.860
because I guess that, because I also, um, I

959
00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:07.820
mean, I, I don't, I don't interact, uh, directly

960
00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:12.139
myself, but I follow some, let's say, communities of

961
00:56:12.139 --> 00:56:17.300
people online who are uh One Piece fans and

962
00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:20.129
Lord of the Rings fans, but particularly One Piece

963
00:56:20.129 --> 00:56:24.449
fans because it's an ongoing series. Uh, AND I

964
00:56:24.449 --> 00:56:27.969
guess that sometimes people might be reading a little

965
00:56:27.969 --> 00:56:33.699
bit too much into. Uh, WHAT the, what the

966
00:56:33.699 --> 00:56:36.139
other, what the author made there. I mean, the,

967
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:39.939
because sometimes they go back in the story and

968
00:56:39.939 --> 00:56:43.459
they say, oh, this, that happened now, we foreshadowed

969
00:56:43.459 --> 00:56:48.020
it, uh, 600 chapters ago. I mean, I'm not

970
00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:51.419
sure if that's really, if that was really foreshadowing

971
00:56:51.419 --> 00:56:53.979
or if it's you're reading too much into it

972
00:56:53.979 --> 00:56:57.629
or Now that you know the outcome, you go

973
00:56:57.629 --> 00:57:02.679
back and you're sort of uh using your hindsight

974
00:57:02.679 --> 00:57:06.439
bias to try to find clues here and there

975
00:57:06.439 --> 00:57:09.760
that this or that would happen and was planned

976
00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.800
far ahead because uh, I mean, it's not taking

977
00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:16.520
any merit from the author because he, I mean

978
00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:20.310
it's so A well written story and even if

979
00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:24.229
you're not foreshadowing something or giving hints that something

980
00:57:24.229 --> 00:57:27.909
is going to happen. Uh, 500 chapters I have

981
00:57:27.909 --> 00:57:31.429
of time, I guess, uh, that's, that's still a

982
00:57:31.429 --> 00:57:35.830
very good story, but sometimes I think that people

983
00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:39.750
read too much into, uh, I mean, they, they

984
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:44.590
want to, uh, for even the smallest details to

985
00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:47.560
have meaning, and sometimes they're just details.

986
00:57:48.389 --> 00:57:56.120
That's absolutely true, and I mean. One of the

987
00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:00.239
things that I find Interesting and that I'm still

988
00:58:00.239 --> 00:58:05.449
learning as an author is just, like, what details

989
00:58:05.449 --> 00:58:08.449
resonate with a reader and that they'll remember, and

990
00:58:08.449 --> 00:58:12.439
what details won't and why that matters, because, um,

991
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:16.530
if There are certain types of details, and there

992
00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:19.489
are, that resonate with the reader. They're going to

993
00:58:19.489 --> 00:58:23.300
come to very different conclusions, and they're going to,

994
00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:26.989
um, It's gonna affect whether or not they believe

995
00:58:26.989 --> 00:58:30.820
your story and the way it concludes, even if

996
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.939
you've added all the right details into the story.

997
00:58:35.159 --> 00:58:40.580
But if the details that You wrote into the

998
00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:44.340
story are not the kind that readers remember and

999
00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:47.860
res and that resonate with them, that maybe play

1000
00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:50.090
into the proper tropes for the genre that you're

1001
00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:52.979
writing and whatever the, the reason is, then even

1002
00:58:52.979 --> 00:58:56.060
if you have expertly plotted it, they're gonna walk

1003
00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:59.409
away scratching their heads. And that's been a really

1004
00:58:59.409 --> 00:59:05.110
hard lesson for me. Um, AND that's something that,

1005
00:59:05.199 --> 00:59:06.820
at least I feel that you can only learn

1006
00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:11.919
through experience. Especially if you're writing a more complicated

1007
00:59:11.919 --> 00:59:14.360
piece that's got maybe a little more, you know,

1008
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:17.850
meat to it and that's not, um, a, a

1009
00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:21.120
sort of strictly on point, here are your beats.

1010
00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:25.479
Um, YOUR, here's, here's your 15 beat structure for

1011
00:59:25.479 --> 00:59:27.800
your, you know, small town romance or whatever. I'm

1012
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.600
not taking anything away from that. I'm just saying

1013
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:33.459
that, you know, those, the expectations are so clear

1014
00:59:33.719 --> 00:59:39.929
in those, and the readers are so, um, Passionate

1015
00:59:39.929 --> 00:59:44.489
about those expectations being met when they're such fans

1016
00:59:44.489 --> 00:59:47.149
of the genre, that you as a writer have,

1017
00:59:47.679 --> 00:59:50.689
uh, more limited, or you're more limited in what

1018
00:59:50.689 --> 00:59:53.550
you're able to do. Because they're not going to

1019
00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:57.379
forgive you if you, um, if you deviate even

1020
00:59:57.379 --> 01:00:00.389
a little bit, you know what I mean? And

1021
01:00:00.389 --> 01:00:06.449
so that, that kind of those details are. Like

1022
01:00:06.449 --> 01:00:08.370
if they're, I, I figure if they're just Easter

1023
01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:11.689
eggs, you know what Easter eggs are, right? Just

1024
01:00:11.689 --> 01:00:14.889
Easter eggs that you, that you put in, um,

1025
01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.649
and it doesn't really matter for the plot at

1026
01:00:17.649 --> 01:00:20.929
all. Those are just there for people who may

1027
01:00:20.929 --> 01:00:23.649
or may not find them, right? Um, BUT when

1028
01:00:23.649 --> 01:00:26.979
they do, they just love it. That that that

1029
01:00:26.979 --> 01:00:29.699
was a part of the story, then I think

1030
01:00:29.699 --> 01:00:34.260
that it doesn't matter, and that you can pepper

1031
01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:37.090
your whole manuscript for these drags, but if the

1032
01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:40.840
details that you're writing. You, you have to be

1033
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:45.340
very well aware of what details are resonating or

1034
01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:49.419
going to resonate with your reader, so that you

1035
01:00:49.419 --> 01:00:54.550
don't leave them. Confused and confused at the end,

1036
01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.080
and thinking that you didn't plot this right. You

1037
01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.760
know, you didn't, you didn't give them what they

1038
01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.500
needed. So, that's got to be a really, uh,

1039
01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.320
you know, for the, this writer of, of, of

1040
01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:10.679
this 1000 chapter epic that you're talking about. I

1041
01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:13.560
I, I have nothing but admiration from that. That's

1042
01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.129
gotta take it for that, that's gotta take tremendous

1043
01:01:16.129 --> 01:01:19.250
skill to be able to um take a reader

1044
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:25.260
on that journey and still, uh, Still satisfy them

1045
01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.620
and and make them feel like the story is

1046
01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.100
coherent, you know.

1047
01:01:31.659 --> 01:01:34.129
And I mean, how much do you think that?

1048
01:01:34.879 --> 01:01:37.409
Or how much do you do this, how much

1049
01:01:37.409 --> 01:01:42.850
do you insert or imbue the story with your

1050
01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:48.250
own personal values, being it moral values or political

1051
01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:52.290
beliefs, something like that. I mean, because one thing

1052
01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:57.449
that bothers some people is that authors who are

1053
01:01:57.449 --> 01:02:02.600
more post-modern, let's say like. If you compare George

1054
01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.620
RR Martin to Tolkien, Tolkien is a very classic

1055
01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.260
kind of writer. I mean, he has very clear

1056
01:02:11.639 --> 01:02:16.199
moral values in his story, and George RR Martin

1057
01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:18.879
is, tends to be a little bit more ni

1058
01:02:18.879 --> 01:02:22.959
nihilistic, let's say, tends to be a little bit

1059
01:02:22.959 --> 01:02:26.560
more, all characters act out of their sort of

1060
01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.879
own self-interest, and it's not that. The good guys

1061
01:02:30.879 --> 01:02:33.909
always win or the bad guys always lose. I

1062
01:02:33.909 --> 01:02:37.560
mean, it's just a matter of, uh, I, I

1063
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.739
guess, playing the game of Thrones, and if you

1064
01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.399
don't play the game well, you lose, if you

1065
01:02:43.399 --> 01:02:47.179
play it right, you, uh, uh, uh, you, you

1066
01:02:47.179 --> 01:02:51.040
win, but not because of your own moral character,

1067
01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:56.530
it's just that, uh, you're playing the game right

1068
01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.770
and. I mean, how, how much do you care

1069
01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:03.689
about the morality of, uh, that is imbued into

1070
01:03:03.689 --> 01:03:04.489
a story?

1071
01:03:05.399 --> 01:03:09.100
I, I think I'm probably more of a classical.

1072
01:03:10.399 --> 01:03:15.600
Um, Writer than that, then then I'm certainly I'd

1073
01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.260
like I'm, I don't think I'm a nihilistic one,

1074
01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.260
even if, if I write about some pretty apocalyptic

1075
01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:27.919
scenarios. Um, I, I've, I love classical storytelling, you

1076
01:03:27.919 --> 01:03:30.679
know, I love fairy tales, like, you know, the

1077
01:03:30.679 --> 01:03:33.840
great fairy tales. I love mythology. I love folklore.

1078
01:03:33.879 --> 01:03:37.800
I love it, you know, that's, that's, it's extremely

1079
01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.879
satisfying to me. Doesn't mean that something like Game

1080
01:03:39.879 --> 01:03:42.669
of Thrones isn't, you know, I loved Game of

1081
01:03:42.669 --> 01:03:45.199
Thrones. I loved Walking The Walking Dead, you know

1082
01:03:45.199 --> 01:03:47.409
what I mean? I love those stories, but I

1083
01:03:47.409 --> 01:03:50.000
tend, I just tend not to write them because,

1084
01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:56.770
um, I love, I love writing. More classical stories

1085
01:03:56.770 --> 01:03:59.229
that I, I love redemption arcs, you know, they,

1086
01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:02.050
they, they mean a lot to me. I love,

1087
01:04:02.389 --> 01:04:09.149
um, That doesn't mean that, like, everybody gets redeemed

1088
01:04:09.149 --> 01:04:12.949
sometimes in my stories either, and same, I think,

1089
01:04:12.989 --> 01:04:15.270
in classical literature. I think that there are people

1090
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:18.870
who really do, uh, succumb to their demons, and

1091
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:23.189
I think that's a really interesting part of classical

1092
01:04:23.189 --> 01:04:28.570
storytelling as well. Um. So, not, you know, not

1093
01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:30.330
everybody, it, it, it doesn't get all tied up

1094
01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:33.909
in a bow at the end, um, with a,

1095
01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:37.330
you know, happy ending for all, but I do

1096
01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:39.389
like that classical structure. I think that it really

1097
01:04:39.389 --> 01:04:47.590
resonates. With most people too. And um Maybe that's

1098
01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:50.610
one of the reasons why I, I like. Kind

1099
01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:52.229
of writing in that realm cause I feel like

1100
01:04:52.229 --> 01:04:58.209
it transcends, um, Cultures and you, you know, that

1101
01:04:58.209 --> 01:05:02.350
there's something that that It's for everyone in it.

1102
01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:09.270
Yeah, it can be shared. More widely, and I

1103
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:10.949
don't even mean that like trying to get a

1104
01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:12.989
wide audience or anything like that. I mean, I

1105
01:05:12.989 --> 01:05:17.219
like the Uh, you know, I love being able

1106
01:05:17.219 --> 01:05:19.219
to just the fact that we can discuss stories

1107
01:05:19.219 --> 01:05:21.340
together even though, you know, we're from different cultures,

1108
01:05:21.419 --> 01:05:23.060
and I mean granted, we're both from Western culture,

1109
01:05:23.139 --> 01:05:24.780
we have a lot of, we have a lot

1110
01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:27.300
of dotted line and some solid line connections in

1111
01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.100
our cultures. It's not like talking to somebody who

1112
01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.340
is from a completely different, um, who has a

1113
01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.560
completely different perspective.

1114
01:05:33.979 --> 01:05:36.639
Yeah, and I, and I mean even artistically speaking,

1115
01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:39.854
we've read lots. Of the same books and watch

1116
01:05:39.854 --> 01:05:42.175
lots of the same movies. So I mean in

1117
01:05:42.175 --> 01:05:45.495
terms of artistic culture we're, we have a very

1118
01:05:45.495 --> 01:05:46.294
common basis.

1119
01:05:46.614 --> 01:05:48.294
I do. I don't like when I'm talking to

1120
01:05:48.294 --> 01:05:50.875
you. I don't feel like there's really any disconnect

1121
01:05:51.215 --> 01:05:54.094
culturally. I feel like we're very much on the

1122
01:05:54.094 --> 01:05:56.814
same page, but I, you know, I do, you

1123
01:05:56.814 --> 01:05:59.354
know, love the idea of being able to, to,

1124
01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:02.939
um. For it to be like a, a big

1125
01:06:02.939 --> 01:06:06.469
myth, you know. I like that kind of big

1126
01:06:06.469 --> 01:06:12.139
myth, uh. TENT, I guess. I feel really comfortable

1127
01:06:12.139 --> 01:06:12.639
in it.

1128
01:06:13.929 --> 01:06:15.919
OK, but, but then, I mean,

1129
01:06:16.979 --> 01:06:18.620
but no, I don't like it when something is,

1130
01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:23.459
say, overtly political or heavily, um, heavily handed when

1131
01:06:23.459 --> 01:06:28.260
it comes to a certain, uh, Maybe religious point

1132
01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:31.899
of view or something like that, religion at all

1133
01:06:31.899 --> 01:06:33.399
or politics for that matter.

1134
01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.540
OK, I, I will come back to the political

1135
01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:41.060
then, but when it comes to morality. I mean,

1136
01:06:41.139 --> 01:06:44.399
uh, what, what do you do to avoid

1137
01:06:44.399 --> 01:06:45.000
it

1138
01:06:45.739 --> 01:06:49.500
being moralistic? I mean, instead of just being a

1139
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:54.379
moral story, being like a morally preachy, uh, being

1140
01:06:54.379 --> 01:06:59.169
morally preaching, uh, uh, I mean, your own values,

1141
01:06:59.439 --> 01:07:00.659
you know what I mean here.

1142
01:07:01.429 --> 01:07:04.169
I think the biggest defense against that is writing

1143
01:07:04.169 --> 01:07:09.110
um multifaceted characters that are whole people and not,

1144
01:07:09.189 --> 01:07:14.560
um, you know, caricatures. It's, it's really, you, I

1145
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:18.040
think you get into trouble as a writer, um,

1146
01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:25.600
or storyteller. With, say, politics and morality, when, um,

1147
01:07:26.699 --> 01:07:30.280
You're writing your opponents, in a kind of silly

1148
01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:33.820
way, and, and they're cartoons and not real human

1149
01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:37.060
beings who have a, a point of view that

1150
01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:41.250
you simply don't share. Yeah, but that it's not,

1151
01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:44.939
um, it's not because they're necessarily inherently evil, and

1152
01:07:44.939 --> 01:07:46.899
even if they are, by the way, inherently evil,

1153
01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:51.300
I think that there has to be some richness

1154
01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:53.379
to that. There has to be some explanation of

1155
01:07:53.379 --> 01:07:58.600
it that um makes It makes that character whole,

1156
01:07:58.679 --> 01:08:01.600
that makes them multifaceted, that makes them interesting. You

1157
01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.590
know, I don't think cartoon characters are interesting. And

1158
01:08:05.729 --> 01:08:08.370
um. I mean, you know.

1159
01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.179
I, I mean, I'm, I mean, I guess that

1160
01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.439
cartoon characters can be funny. I mean, if, if

1161
01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.720
you, if you watch Tom and Jerry, I mean,

1162
01:08:19.759 --> 01:08:21.189
it's for kids, but it,

1163
01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:23.120
no, no, no, that's not what I mean. I

1164
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:23.359
love

1165
01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:23.990
cartoon, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1166
01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.879
I love Bugs Bunny. I love SpongeBob. I mean,

1167
01:08:26.959 --> 01:08:29.629
uh, making a, I should say caricature, not a

1168
01:08:29.629 --> 01:08:33.680
cartoon character, you know, when you, when you don't

1169
01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.709
take your opponent, whether it's a moral opponent or

1170
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:41.488
a political opponent, seriously. It, it dumbs down a

1171
01:08:41.488 --> 01:08:43.837
project, whatever it is, it dumbs down a story.

1172
01:08:44.087 --> 01:08:47.350
You must take them seriously. Yeah, and you can't

1173
01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:49.740
assume that you are also smarter than they are.

1174
01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:54.459
Yeah. Or also more moral than they are, um.

1175
01:08:55.509 --> 01:08:59.229
It, it, uh, I, I, I, I, I just

1176
01:08:59.229 --> 01:09:01.430
think that, you know, the IQ of a project

1177
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:05.950
drops really considerably when that happens, when that sort

1178
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:09.950
of, when there's that overt moralism and overt politicization

1179
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:15.470
that, that no longer. Rings true of people, you

1180
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:16.250
know, yeah.

1181
01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:22.580
Yeah. Uh, AND, and about the politics. I mean,

1182
01:09:22.779 --> 01:09:27.938
there there was. There's an author that I, I,

1183
01:09:28.019 --> 01:09:31.938
I mean, I just can't like what she, what

1184
01:09:31.938 --> 01:09:35.457
she wrote. I mean, it's just too, it's just

1185
01:09:35.457 --> 01:09:38.938
too silly for me that, uh, Ayn Rand, I

1186
01:09:38.938 --> 01:09:43.639
mean that was shrugged. It's, I mean, it's basically,

1187
01:09:44.019 --> 01:09:51.560
uh, shoving her own politics on your phone. And

1188
01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.919
I, and I mean, but what, what one interesting

1189
01:09:53.919 --> 01:09:57.759
thing about that is that I don't like it.

1190
01:09:57.839 --> 01:10:02.560
I really don't like it. But perhaps, at least

1191
01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:06.540
to some extent is because I am left wing,

1192
01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:13.680
because uh right wing people, particularly right wing libertarians,

1193
01:10:13.839 --> 01:10:16.450
there are many people who love that book.

1194
01:10:16.759 --> 01:10:18.359
I think part of it is that their views

1195
01:10:18.359 --> 01:10:22.990
aren't represented often in um It, you know, in

1196
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:25.629
art, I think that, you know, artists tend to

1197
01:10:25.629 --> 01:10:32.009
be, uh, you know, More, you know, open, and,

1198
01:10:32.109 --> 01:10:34.830
um, I think the more and less conservative, and

1199
01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.589
I mean conservative, I mean that in a very

1200
01:10:36.589 --> 01:10:42.709
broad sense. I think even artists who might lean

1201
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:47.509
right on the political spectrum still have this kind

1202
01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:52.589
of maybe broader view of, of people and experiences

1203
01:10:52.589 --> 01:10:56.509
because their job is to consider them. You know,

1204
01:10:56.879 --> 01:11:00.089
and not just their job, but that's, that's kind

1205
01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:02.810
of how they are naturally. They're, they're interested in

1206
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:06.200
people, they're interested in, in situations and picking them

1207
01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.810
apart. But I, I think with, um, I mean,

1208
01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:12.689
Ayn Rand was such an interesting character that I

1209
01:11:12.689 --> 01:11:19.950
think that Because people also knew her as a,

1210
01:11:20.049 --> 01:11:23.020
as a person and as a philosopher that made

1211
01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:26.850
her work. More interesting than it actually was, if

1212
01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:30.450
that makes sense, cause it's not, it's very stock

1213
01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:34.359
charactery, you know, it's so, it's not, you know,

1214
01:11:34.439 --> 01:11:36.209
all the things that we've been talking about, the,

1215
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:40.680
her characters are not multifaceted, you know, they're, they're

1216
01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:46.569
really pretty, they're, they're stock, but she's so interesting.

1217
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:50.009
And I also think, you know, like I said,

1218
01:11:50.049 --> 01:11:54.660
that, you know, libertarians and, um, kind of, uh,

1219
01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:59.069
a certain type of right-leaning person, uh, does not

1220
01:11:59.609 --> 01:12:02.770
see their worldview represented in art very often. And

1221
01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:06.270
so when it When it gets presented to them,

1222
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:09.310
it's, it, they, they're very attached to it.

1223
01:12:10.399 --> 01:12:14.200
Mm. Yeah, but at the same time, then there

1224
01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:20.040
are people who In view more of their story

1225
01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:24.240
with their own politics and there are even, um,

1226
01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.879
I mean, I, I can't, I'm not sure if

1227
01:12:26.879 --> 01:12:30.520
there's a specific term for this, but uh do

1228
01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:36.609
you know authors like Bertolt Brecht or I mean.

1229
01:12:37.095 --> 01:12:41.884
Yeah, I, I mean, he was basically his plays,

1230
01:12:42.035 --> 01:12:44.294
I, I, I can't remember exactly if he also

1231
01:12:44.294 --> 01:12:48.694
wrote poetry or not, but his plays were political

1232
01:12:48.694 --> 01:12:52.634
plays. I mean, the purpose for him of writing

1233
01:12:53.134 --> 01:12:57.895
the plays he wrote was to sort of create

1234
01:12:57.895 --> 01:13:02.209
a political manifesto. In the form of a play,

1235
01:13:02.569 --> 01:13:05.970
so, so it's, so the, the, it's not that

1236
01:13:05.970 --> 01:13:11.819
the, his works have. Uh, POLITICAL aspects to them,

1237
01:13:11.939 --> 01:13:15.970
they are political, but I, it doesn't bother, it

1238
01:13:15.970 --> 01:13:20.490
doesn't bother me as much as Ayn Rand does,

1239
01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.810
and I'm not sure if it's because, again, I'm

1240
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:27.060
left, I'm left wing and he was also sort

1241
01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:32.223
of promoting uh left wing values or. If it's

1242
01:13:32.223 --> 01:13:39.732
just a properly defined kind of creation that is

1243
01:13:39.732 --> 01:13:42.413
political in nature and so it doesn't bother me

1244
01:13:42.413 --> 01:13:44.513
and in the case of Ayn Rand, I know

1245
01:13:44.973 --> 01:13:49.493
what her political beliefs were and I know that

1246
01:13:49.493 --> 01:13:53.195
she manifested them in Atlas Shrugged, but I mean,

1247
01:13:53.286 --> 01:13:55.965
it sounds like it was supposed to be a

1248
01:13:55.965 --> 01:14:00.166
fictional story, but it's very silly because the characters

1249
01:14:00.166 --> 01:14:04.286
are very, are almost caricatures of themselves in terms

1250
01:14:04.286 --> 01:14:07.525
of how simplistic they are and things like that.

1251
01:14:07.605 --> 01:14:09.965
So, I mean, what do you think of all

1252
01:14:09.965 --> 01:14:10.366
of them? Well,

1253
01:14:10.806 --> 01:14:15.080
sure, her stories are classic propaganda stories. That, um,

1254
01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:18.770
that I think she just, she, I imagine she

1255
01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:22.490
did this deliberately because she's, I think, too smart

1256
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:24.850
not to have done it deliberately. She took basically

1257
01:14:24.850 --> 01:14:28.439
the Soviet propaganda structure for a story and inverted

1258
01:14:28.439 --> 01:14:33.930
it. Um, WHICH, I mean, my back in, uh,

1259
01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.089
you know, when I was living in, in Prague

1260
01:14:37.089 --> 01:14:41.490
in the 1990s, we, uh, my theater company, we

1261
01:14:41.490 --> 01:14:45.549
decided to put on a, a communist propaganda play,

1262
01:14:46.129 --> 01:14:49.450
and it was really funny because I, I was

1263
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:51.770
in charge of finding the communist propaganda play for

1264
01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:53.189
one, because I was the only one who could

1265
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:56.089
read and write check, right? So I was going

1266
01:14:56.089 --> 01:14:57.850
through these plays and they were, oh my God,

1267
01:14:57.959 --> 01:15:02.509
they were so. God, awful. That it was honestly

1268
01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:06.399
hard to get through two pages of them. And

1269
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:08.689
the one I ended up choosing, I chose because

1270
01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:12.209
I could actually get through more than a few

1271
01:15:12.209 --> 01:15:13.970
pages, and I thought, well, this is the best

1272
01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:16.729
we can do. And it was interesting because it

1273
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:19.990
turned out that this play was at one point,

1274
01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:23.450
mandatory for every theater in Prague to be putting

1275
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:25.930
on all the time. Like it was all, it

1276
01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:29.399
had to be in the repertoire. And It, it

1277
01:15:29.399 --> 01:15:32.919
was written by, um, someone who wasn't a, you

1278
01:15:32.919 --> 01:15:36.240
know, a playwright, but was very passionate about it.

1279
01:15:36.359 --> 01:15:38.319
So maybe that was it, that was part of

1280
01:15:38.319 --> 01:15:40.549
it too, because he, he really did put his

1281
01:15:40.549 --> 01:15:43.399
heart into it, even though it was an absolute

1282
01:15:43.399 --> 01:15:45.654
piece of shite. I mean, it was so terrible

1283
01:15:45.654 --> 01:15:49.095
that it's, that it's, yeah, it was just so

1284
01:15:49.095 --> 01:15:52.935
terrible. But the other stories, I believe, were so

1285
01:15:52.935 --> 01:15:56.294
terrible because real writers were being forced to write

1286
01:15:56.294 --> 01:15:59.415
them, and you could kind of feel the resentment.

1287
01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.680
Yeah, and so they were being written purposefully badly

1288
01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:08.759
if that makes sense, whereas I, this Vasha Khanya,

1289
01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:14.520
um, who wrote this, uh, communist propaganda play, um.

1290
01:16:15.209 --> 01:16:19.259
He, he was just a true believer and it

1291
01:16:19.259 --> 01:16:22.850
was so funny because the, the play was so

1292
01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:28.089
bad that, um, literally a few days before we

1293
01:16:28.089 --> 01:16:33.339
were supposed to, the play was to debut, um,

1294
01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:35.750
several of the actors just took off and quit.

1295
01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:39.799
And we had to scramble, we took a director

1296
01:16:39.799 --> 01:16:41.399
from one of our other plays who played the

1297
01:16:41.399 --> 01:16:44.479
title character, and he, he had to like, luckily,

1298
01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.279
you know, he, he was a Scottish director, but

1299
01:16:46.279 --> 01:16:48.589
he'd been an actor, so he could learn the

1300
01:16:48.589 --> 01:16:53.479
lines quickly, you know, and, and, um, we, I

1301
01:16:53.479 --> 01:16:55.979
mean, we absolutely had to scramble to get this,

1302
01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.970
uh. To get this story up and We did

1303
01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:02.930
by the absolute seat of our pants, and it

1304
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:06.899
ended up being one of our most popular. Plays,

1305
01:17:07.399 --> 01:17:12.000
shockingly. And the Czechs loved it, because it was

1306
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.899
kind of like a nostalgia piece for them. And

1307
01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.979
what was really interesting about this play, um, was

1308
01:17:20.319 --> 01:17:26.209
that, in order to subvert it. The actors and

1309
01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:28.250
directors at these theaters that had to put this

1310
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:30.209
play on decided they were going to play it

1311
01:17:30.490 --> 01:17:33.089
like it was Shakespeare, that they were just gonna

1312
01:17:33.089 --> 01:17:35.100
play it like they meant it. And so the

1313
01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.520
audience would be laughing at all the wrong times.

1314
01:17:37.759 --> 01:17:41.089
Not the wrong times, but the wrong times as

1315
01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:44.089
the writer and as the communists intended, you know,

1316
01:17:44.290 --> 01:17:48.950
because they want the, um, They were, they were

1317
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:52.069
trying to put out their message, but of course,

1318
01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:54.790
the audience was aware of what a bullshit message

1319
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:58.490
it was, and so when title character, for instance,

1320
01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:01.629
had um this monologue about how he was gonna

1321
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:05.100
work for the state. That forget his family, forget

1322
01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:07.490
his friends, who cares about anybody? All I care

1323
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:09.259
about is the state, and I'm gonna work my

1324
01:18:09.259 --> 01:18:11.100
hands raw for the state. I'll work till I

1325
01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:14.339
die for the state. Everyone was laughing, you know,

1326
01:18:14.459 --> 01:18:18.299
cause it's, it's absurd. That's the most ridiculous monologue

1327
01:18:18.299 --> 01:18:21.180
you could possibly imagine. And, and it went on

1328
01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:23.770
for 3 pages. He would not shut up about

1329
01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:27.120
it because, you know, the, the author of this

1330
01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:32.220
abomination meant it, you know, he was. He was

1331
01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:37.319
in a fever, utopian fever dream. And so, um,

1332
01:18:37.459 --> 01:18:40.020
Ayn Rand anyway, my point is, sorry, I'm being

1333
01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:41.839
a little long winded here, more than a little,

1334
01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:47.740
this that Ayn Rand saw that going on in

1335
01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:52.439
Soviet Russia, and she had to sit through. Abominations

1336
01:18:52.439 --> 01:18:55.359
like that. And so she decided that she was

1337
01:18:55.359 --> 01:19:01.759
gonna write. Um, AND a sort of anti-communist propaganda.

1338
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:04.910
That's what I feel. I feel like she very

1339
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:06.549
much did it on purpose. I don't see how

1340
01:19:06.549 --> 01:19:08.790
she couldn't have done it on purpose because the

1341
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:11.939
structure was identical, and she knew exactly what a

1342
01:19:11.939 --> 01:19:13.109
propaganda play was.

1343
01:19:13.839 --> 01:19:18.370
Uh, ARE you familiar with, uh, Jose Saramago's work?

1344
01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.930
I mean, the Portuguese Nobel Prize in Literature from

1345
01:19:21.930 --> 01:19:23.149
1998.

1346
01:19:23.589 --> 01:19:24.120
I'm not.

1347
01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:27.919
No, I, I mean, it, I, I would also

1348
01:19:27.919 --> 01:19:30.569
recommend you his works. I mean, I really love

1349
01:19:30.569 --> 01:19:34.000
Sara Saramago, and it's interesting because he has a,

1350
01:19:34.290 --> 01:19:38.209
a book in Portuguese is, it's Memorial de Convento.

1351
01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:43.410
I'm not sure what's the, uh, English title, but

1352
01:19:43.410 --> 01:19:51.680
anyway, it's about how in the 1700s, uh, 1

1353
01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:57.279
of our kings, Don Juan Qin to, uh, Built

1354
01:19:57.279 --> 01:20:02.339
uh the, a, a convent, a convent in a

1355
01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:07.060
city called Mafra, and he basically mobilized the entire

1356
01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:11.540
country. I mean, even agriculture was in shambles because

1357
01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.939
he mobilized most men in the country just to

1358
01:20:14.939 --> 01:20:19.520
work on constructing that convent. And, uh, one thing

1359
01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:22.060
that Saramago does at a certain point in the

1360
01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.709
book is because he, he, he, he He was

1361
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:28.310
a communist as well. I mean, he was really

1362
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:32.069
left wing Saramago, uh, but one thing that he

1363
01:20:32.069 --> 01:20:35.790
does is that, uh, because he really dislikes the

1364
01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:39.600
fact that we say that Don Zhuaning to build,

1365
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:44.629
uh, the convent, uh, the convent of Mare, and

1366
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:47.790
it was not he himself who worked on building

1367
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:51.350
it, it was the workers. He spends like 3

1368
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:59.000
pages just, uh. Enumerating the names of a bunch

1369
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.890
of people who work there. So, and you can

1370
01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:04.830
skip the three pages and you miss nothing, but

1371
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:09.009
I find that fantastic because it's like a great

1372
01:21:09.069 --> 01:21:12.629
manifestation of his own left-wing values. So now I'm

1373
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:16.430
going to spend 3 pages just uh making a

1374
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:19.959
list of names of people, uh, presenting a list

1375
01:21:19.959 --> 01:21:23.189
of. NAMES of people who built the convent because

1376
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:26.229
those are the people who deserve to be acknowledged

1377
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.339
and not.

1378
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:30.359
Oh my God, yeah, it's, it, you know, it,

1379
01:21:30.549 --> 01:21:32.859
it, it's so funny because in a similar vein,

1380
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:34.660
this play that I told you about this communist

1381
01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:37.790
propaganda play, uh, in, in, you know, it was

1382
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:41.189
really trying to live its values, so it, it

1383
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:44.330
wanted to employ as many people as possible. So

1384
01:21:45.029 --> 01:21:48.709
sometimes. It just made absolutely no sense why a

1385
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:51.620
character who, why is that character even there, would,

1386
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:54.390
would have a line, you know, and, and there

1387
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:57.890
would be this, this almost this like roundabout where

1388
01:21:57.890 --> 01:21:59.950
each character would have a line just so that

1389
01:21:59.950 --> 01:22:02.375
they would be employed, right? It's so that they

1390
01:22:02.375 --> 01:22:05.935
would employ people. So, it was completely uninteresting for

1391
01:22:05.935 --> 01:22:08.325
the audience, right? Because it would be like, well,

1392
01:22:08.404 --> 01:22:11.134
hello, how are you? I am, you know, it

1393
01:22:11.134 --> 01:22:13.924
would just go in this sort of circle where

1394
01:22:13.924 --> 01:22:17.814
each person would, would give a, a, a, I

1395
01:22:17.814 --> 01:22:20.774
don't know, a line of information that's, that's necessary

1396
01:22:20.774 --> 01:22:24.415
for the story that should have been just one

1397
01:22:24.415 --> 01:22:28.174
character or two characters relaying that information in a,

1398
01:22:28.214 --> 01:22:31.919
in a, in a way that You know, illustrated

1399
01:22:31.919 --> 01:22:35.080
their relationship or something, but instead it was just

1400
01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:40.439
people randomly giving lines, no reason whatsoever. It was

1401
01:22:40.439 --> 01:22:41.580
just hilarious.

1402
01:22:42.359 --> 01:22:47.189
Have you watched that Nazi propaganda movie, which you,

1403
01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:50.680
uh, I mean, always appears in those kinds of

1404
01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:55.640
books like 11,000 movies that you should watch before

1405
01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:58.279
you die or something like that, the, the triumph

1406
01:22:58.279 --> 01:22:59.140
of the will.

1407
01:22:59.450 --> 01:23:01.279
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I, I,

1408
01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:04.529
I, I mean that, that, that movie really pisses

1409
01:23:04.529 --> 01:23:08.490
me off because I'm left wing. I mean Nazi

1410
01:23:08.490 --> 01:23:13.310
politics are just absolutely despicable, but it's a great

1411
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:15.040
movie. It's like damn it.

1412
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:20.410
It was. I know it's unbelievable. I, I went,

1413
01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:23.430
I saw it at an archive, at a, an

1414
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:27.390
archive in Prague. When I was doing research for,

1415
01:23:28.129 --> 01:23:32.410
um, the BBC they were doing a whole, uh,

1416
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:35.830
Story on, I think it was the composer Pavel

1417
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:40.069
Haass, who was at, uh, Tin and then got

1418
01:23:40.069 --> 01:23:43.450
deported to Auschwitz. And so, I was, I was

1419
01:23:43.629 --> 01:23:45.509
doing some research for them, and so I, I

1420
01:23:45.509 --> 01:23:47.270
saw Triumph of the Will there, and I also

1421
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:51.029
saw Hitler gives the Jews a Town. The Red

1422
01:23:51.029 --> 01:23:55.859
Cross film, right? Um, AND, and a few others,

1423
01:23:55.939 --> 01:23:59.350
and it was just amazing. I mean, and on

1424
01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:00.509
top of it, to be able to see it

1425
01:24:00.509 --> 01:24:04.549
in this old archive, you know, with the, you

1426
01:24:04.549 --> 01:24:08.660
know, the reels and everything. I felt like, It

1427
01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:12.120
was, you know, 70 years ago or whatever. It

1428
01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:17.729
was crazy. But yeah, Lenny, uh, Riefenstall, is that

1429
01:24:17.729 --> 01:24:20.509
her name? She, yeah, she's, gosh, what a talent,

1430
01:24:20.770 --> 01:24:20.890
you

1431
01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:25.490
know. Yeah, I mean, I, I mean, it's, it's

1432
01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:29.620
really bad because of the politics, but it's, but

1433
01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:33.299
it, but it's really good political propaganda. Oh my

1434
01:24:33.299 --> 01:24:35.970
God. I mean, man, if, you know, if, if

1435
01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:40.060
every political party had that good political propaganda, hell,

1436
01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:40.410
yeah,

1437
01:24:40.779 --> 01:24:42.930
no, I, I mean that that's, that's another thing.

1438
01:24:42.939 --> 01:24:45.459
I, I wasn't planning on asking you this, but

1439
01:24:45.459 --> 01:24:50.970
since the conversation levels, uh, this way. I, I

1440
01:24:50.970 --> 01:24:55.049
mean, I hear many times from people, particularly perhaps

1441
01:24:55.049 --> 01:24:58.810
people who are more, uh, left wing minded or

1442
01:24:58.810 --> 01:25:01.649
something like that, that they say that they tend

1443
01:25:01.649 --> 01:25:08.339
to associate art with being intrinsically, I mean, uh,

1444
01:25:08.729 --> 01:25:16.229
art as an activity that is intrinsically. Uh, ANTI-TOTALITARIANISM,

1445
01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:19.890
anti-dictatorship, and stuff like that, but I, I mean,

1446
01:25:19.930 --> 01:25:21.729
I don't agree with that at all. I mean,

1447
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:26.629
you have, you have great, amazing artists that basically,

1448
01:25:26.970 --> 01:25:31.330
uh, their creations were very much for the kinds

1449
01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:36.120
of regimes they lived in and but that promoted

1450
01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:43.939
artistic pieces that promoted very much imperialism, totalitarianism, dictatorship,

1451
01:25:43.979 --> 01:25:47.479
and and far right values. Well,

1452
01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:53.189
I think people On either side of the political

1453
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:55.509
spectrum, I think, again, when you're a true believer,

1454
01:25:55.629 --> 01:25:59.310
you believe you are actually setting people free. With

1455
01:26:00.299 --> 01:26:02.740
whatever it is that you're imposing on them, you

1456
01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:06.950
believe that that is freedom. Yeah. And you can

1457
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:11.069
see that in Soviet propaganda, where you will, you

1458
01:26:11.069 --> 01:26:14.669
can literally find Soviet propaganda that will say something

1459
01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:17.459
to the effect of these chains are freedom. Mhm.

1460
01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.490
You know what I mean? And I, I, I,

1461
01:26:22.649 --> 01:26:25.209
that's, that's a, that is a part of the

1462
01:26:25.209 --> 01:26:28.049
human experience. I think we see that in religion,

1463
01:26:28.169 --> 01:26:30.370
you know, I think that certainly that was, uh,

1464
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:32.410
I've seen that in, in my own, like, in

1465
01:26:32.410 --> 01:26:36.890
my own religion, Catholicism, where, um, But it, it's

1466
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:39.479
presented as these strictures are your freedom. This is

1467
01:26:39.479 --> 01:26:43.370
your ticket to freedom, right? And um you see

1468
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:49.609
it in politics, you see it, um. In all

1469
01:26:49.609 --> 01:26:54.910
sorts of stories and, you know, I, I in

1470
01:26:55.330 --> 01:26:58.529
folk stories even, and, and, um, I think you

1471
01:26:58.529 --> 01:27:01.520
even see it in sex practices, like with, uh,

1472
01:27:01.529 --> 01:27:04.410
like BDSM and things like that, which I think

1473
01:27:04.410 --> 01:27:08.290
kind of have trickled down from Catholicism, um, but

1474
01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:12.129
it it's, it's this concept that we clearly relate

1475
01:27:12.129 --> 01:27:14.209
to, to some extent at least, or to a

1476
01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:22.299
large extent as humans that, um, Certain strictures allow

1477
01:27:22.299 --> 01:27:26.660
for freedom, and that's not untrue, because, uh, you

1478
01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:28.939
know, it's, we were just talking about storytelling, and

1479
01:27:28.939 --> 01:27:30.859
I was saying as I've become more disciplined in

1480
01:27:30.859 --> 01:27:33.279
my storytelling, I actually feel like it's gotten better.

1481
01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:35.819
When I've gone from being a pantr to a

1482
01:27:35.819 --> 01:27:38.160
plotter, and I was a pantr for most of

1483
01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:43.859
my writing, you know, life, um. So, you know,

1484
01:27:43.939 --> 01:27:45.509
there is some truth to that. We have to

1485
01:27:45.509 --> 01:27:47.770
have order in our society in order to feel

1486
01:27:47.770 --> 01:27:52.399
um And, you know, to, just, just to have

1487
01:27:52.399 --> 01:27:54.600
a high trust society, you, you feel a lot

1488
01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:58.129
more free in a high, high trust society, but

1489
01:27:58.129 --> 01:28:02.160
when it's too ordered, it's stifling. You know, we

1490
01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.600
were talking about the difference between, you know, a,

1491
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:07.080
like a western city and a city like Doha.

1492
01:28:07.439 --> 01:28:12.350
Doha feels, um, like you're always in church. Yeah.

1493
01:28:12.549 --> 01:28:14.790
If you're in a really nice restaurant, you know,

1494
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:19.549
or, and there's music playing, there's, there's a, there's

1495
01:28:19.549 --> 01:28:24.189
just this incredibly, um, you know, orderly churchy vibe

1496
01:28:24.189 --> 01:28:28.290
to it. Whereas, uh, you know, you just feel.

1497
01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.720
A lot more, you know, a, a sense of

1498
01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:34.240
fun and, and revelry when you go to even

1499
01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:37.740
just like a small cafe in a western city.

1500
01:28:38.549 --> 01:28:42.109
Yeah, no, look, I, I already know what we're

1501
01:28:42.109 --> 01:28:45.419
going to talk about next time, next year. Uh,

1502
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:47.709
WE don't have time to do it today because

1503
01:28:47.709 --> 01:28:49.870
we only have 20 more minutes. I don't want

1504
01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:53.250
to get into the topic because we will, we,

1505
01:28:53.549 --> 01:28:56.189
we would, we would be here for another 2

1506
01:28:56.189 --> 01:28:58.540
hours and we just don't have the time today,

1507
01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:01.830
unfortunately, but next time we have to talk about.

1508
01:29:02.399 --> 01:29:06.910
Uh, SEPARATING the art from the artist, that's, uh,

1509
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:12.129
that's another very interesting topic because I mean, whether

1510
01:29:12.129 --> 01:29:16.009
people like to admit it or not. I, I

1511
01:29:16.009 --> 01:29:19.229
mean, I guess this is not a very controversial

1512
01:29:19.890 --> 01:29:24.049
point to make. Some of the best art ever

1513
01:29:24.049 --> 01:29:29.069
created, even more so when it comes to architecture

1514
01:29:29.069 --> 01:29:36.020
and sculpture, has been made in. And to promote

1515
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:41.399
er violent regimes and totalitarian regimes and absolutist regimes.

1516
01:29:41.439 --> 01:29:44.660
I mean, I, I mean, I live in Europe,

1517
01:29:44.759 --> 01:29:47.819
you live there, er you know this very well.

1518
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:50.319
I mean we have some of the best architecture.

1519
01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:57.399
In the world from old ancient regimes and they

1520
01:29:57.399 --> 01:30:02.250
were not very good when it comes to promoting

1521
01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:05.270
like human rights and stuff like that.

1522
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:10.200
No. Um, uh, YEAH, no, I could talk about

1523
01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:18.209
that for, forever, uh. It's It's funny cause this

1524
01:30:18.209 --> 01:30:24.589
is dotted line connected to this topic, um, here

1525
01:30:24.589 --> 01:30:26.310
in, you know, in the town I live in

1526
01:30:26.319 --> 01:30:29.990
in Virginia, you know, when, um, There, there, you

1527
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:33.729
know, when the, the BLM riots happened and, uh,

1528
01:30:34.549 --> 01:30:36.220
you know, there was, there was just a, a,

1529
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:38.709
a real reckoning that was, that was going on

1530
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:42.540
that, um, That people were feeling very passionate about,

1531
01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:46.689
so there was a lot of renaming. And which

1532
01:30:46.689 --> 01:30:49.450
is understandable, and that happens throughout history, you know,

1533
01:30:49.529 --> 01:30:55.660
you've, you've, there's a shift in anything from Political

1534
01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:57.939
regime to just a vibe, you know, and, and

1535
01:30:57.939 --> 01:31:01.879
you rename things, but there is this school that,

1536
01:31:01.899 --> 01:31:07.799
um, By my, by where my daughter lives, that

1537
01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:11.100
uh used to be named after, you know, I

1538
01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:13.220
think someone who was an original founder of this

1539
01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:15.060
town or whatever, and I don't even know what

1540
01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:17.140
it is that that person did in their past.

1541
01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:20.020
Maybe they were a slaveholder or, you know, had

1542
01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:21.859
some kind of unsavory view, but they were, you

1543
01:31:21.859 --> 01:31:24.220
know, an important person here, and they renamed the

1544
01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:29.359
school, but they renamed the school, um. Uh, THE

1545
01:31:29.359 --> 01:31:31.799
trailblazer school or something, and I walked by it

1546
01:31:31.799 --> 01:31:33.660
and I was like, well, couldn't they have found

1547
01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:39.200
that sounds like a summer camp. Or like a

1548
01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:43.140
sports team. Couldn't they have found like somebody, um,

1549
01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:47.120
somebody else, you know, who, who, you know, perhaps

1550
01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:50.759
like an like an an African American of, of

1551
01:31:50.759 --> 01:31:53.399
who, who, you know, invented something. There are so

1552
01:31:53.399 --> 01:31:55.359
many of them. Couldn't they have named the school

1553
01:31:55.359 --> 01:31:57.160
after that? Why did they have to make it

1554
01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.240
sound like a summer camp, for heaven's sake, you

1555
01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:04.120
know. But, um, but yeah, those, those are, uh.

1556
01:32:05.319 --> 01:32:08.229
That'll be a really, really interesting topic to, to

1557
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:11.700
go into, cause I get, I get it. Sometimes,

1558
01:32:12.359 --> 01:32:16.240
you know, I mean, what's worse than meeting a

1559
01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.399
hero, meeting one of your heroes, and you discover

1560
01:32:19.399 --> 01:32:25.810
that they are just Despicable, or unpleasant, or whatever,

1561
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:29.689
or unsavory. It sucks.

1562
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:35.069
Yeah, I mean, and I guess that particularly for,

1563
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:38.350
I don't know, people who lived during the Renaissance

1564
01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:44.430
and even in more ancient times. I mean, if

1565
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:49.250
you were an artist. If you didn't have a

1566
01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:52.569
lot of options. I mean, basically, if you wanted

1567
01:32:52.569 --> 01:32:56.350
to live off your art, you had to have

1568
01:32:56.609 --> 01:32:59.810
patrons, and patrons were the people who have money

1569
01:32:59.810 --> 01:33:02.109
and people who have money were the ones who

1570
01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:06.250
benefited from being part of the regime, and they

1571
01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:10.890
would want you to create pieces of art to

1572
01:33:10.890 --> 01:33:14.229
promote those kinds of political values, right?

1573
01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:20.049
Yeah, it's, yeah, those things are all connected. And

1574
01:33:20.049 --> 01:33:23.129
you know, you have some, you have some artists

1575
01:33:23.129 --> 01:33:25.250
who are like chased out of towns because they

1576
01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:27.169
were preying on 12 year old girls, you know,

1577
01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:31.240
and yet they created beautiful art. And, and so,

1578
01:33:31.649 --> 01:33:34.680
um, That's a real conundrum, I think, for us,

1579
01:33:34.879 --> 01:33:38.399
especially right now when that information is so readily

1580
01:33:38.399 --> 01:33:41.080
available, because, you know, in past generations, you might

1581
01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.939
not have known that even about the artist, because

1582
01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:48.520
that that information just wasn't widely available. Their life

1583
01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.839
while they were living was not that interesting because

1584
01:33:50.839 --> 01:33:54.560
their art wasn't known. They weren't famous. Until after

1585
01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:57.080
they died, and so nobody even took note of

1586
01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:59.479
who they were, and what they thought, and, and

1587
01:33:59.479 --> 01:34:01.240
what they were doing, and you really would have

1588
01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:03.279
to excavate in order to find out that someone

1589
01:34:03.279 --> 01:34:04.600
was a real son of a bitch, you know

1590
01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:07.149
what I mean? But now, all that information is

1591
01:34:07.149 --> 01:34:10.520
so readily available, and so, people seem to be

1592
01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:14.379
seeing simultaneously the person's work and who they are.

1593
01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:18.140
Yeah, you know, yeah, uh, and I, and I,

1594
01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:21.700
yeah, I, I mean, and in even now, of

1595
01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:26.060
course, even nowadays it's very hard to earn a

1596
01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:30.140
living as just an artist, but there, there were

1597
01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:34.850
many people that even, I guess, died in poverty,

1598
01:34:34.859 --> 01:34:38.029
creating great pieces of art, uh, like, for example,

1599
01:34:38.129 --> 01:34:44.919
even Here in Portugal, there's Luis Camoins, the, the

1600
01:34:44.919 --> 01:34:49.520
writer who created the, the Luzads. The Luzads is

1601
01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:55.310
basically um Uh, an, an epic poem, and it

1602
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:59.009
was an epic poem about the history of Portugal

1603
01:34:59.229 --> 01:35:02.669
up till the 16th century when he was alive

1604
01:35:02.669 --> 01:35:07.069
and he dedicated the poem to Don Sebastian, who

1605
01:35:07.069 --> 01:35:10.750
was the king in power back when he wrote

1606
01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:13.709
the poem, and I mean it's a very long

1607
01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:19.270
poem, it's a, a divine comedy style of poem,

1608
01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:22.259
so it's a a a very long one. Uh,

1609
01:35:22.279 --> 01:35:26.040
AND basically he did that. He wrote the poem.

1610
01:35:26.589 --> 01:35:30.560
Even today, we have a holiday in Portugal, which

1611
01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.890
is, I mean, the one of the most important

1612
01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:38.560
holidays. It's the day of Portugal. Luis Camoins, the

1613
01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:42.384
guy, and Portuguese community, so we, he has his

1614
01:35:42.384 --> 01:35:46.464
own holi holiday. He's the only Portuguese person in

1615
01:35:46.464 --> 01:35:50.665
history with his name in the holiday, and, and

1616
01:35:50.665 --> 01:35:54.904
yet he wrote the poem, he dedicated the poem

1617
01:35:54.904 --> 01:35:57.265
to the king, and he died in poverty.

1618
01:35:58.029 --> 01:36:00.629
Yeah, I know, it's amazing. I mean, Edgar Allan

1619
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:07.080
Poe died in poverty. It's um, you know, I,

1620
01:36:07.129 --> 01:36:12.089
I, I. If I could like if if I

1621
01:36:12.089 --> 01:36:14.649
had a better, better memory, like a better like

1622
01:36:14.649 --> 01:36:16.879
instant recall, I could probably come up with a

1623
01:36:16.879 --> 01:36:21.850
list of 10. 10 artists who died in poverty

1624
01:36:21.850 --> 01:36:25.660
who, you know, Whose work is everywhere now and

1625
01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:29.779
it's so instantly recognizable and their, their work is

1626
01:36:29.779 --> 01:36:32.899
worth God only knows how much money, and they

1627
01:36:32.899 --> 01:36:35.580
could barely feed themselves and, you know, often died

1628
01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:38.740
of like consumption, you know, in some hole in

1629
01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:39.160
the wall.

1630
01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:45.080
Yeah. OK, so I mean, should we leave it

1631
01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:49.640
here? I mean, leave just the no, no, no

1632
01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:52.279
problem. I understand that. So yeah, I guess we

1633
01:36:52.279 --> 01:36:55.109
are, we're already leaving people with the teaser for

1634
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:59.040
our next conversation next year. So, and I guess

1635
01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:02.129
this is a good point to wrap up our

1636
01:37:02.129 --> 01:37:06.250
conversation, so. Hi guys, thank you for watching this
