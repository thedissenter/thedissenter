00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.079
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.110
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lab and the MG

3
00:00:06.159 --> 00:00:09.510
by Doctor Philip Cohen. He is Professor of Sociology

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.859
at the University of Maryland. He writes about demographic

5
00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.969
trends, family structure, the division of labor, health disparities

6
00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:21.825
and open science. And today we're discussing whether generation

7
00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:25.444
labels make sense. I mean labels like the silent

8
00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:29.995
generation baby boomers, Gen X millennials and Gen Z,

9
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:34.115
whether it makes sense to talk about generations in

10
00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:37.375
that way. So, uh Philip, welcome to the show.

11
00:00:37.384 --> 00:00:38.955
It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:39.474 --> 00:00:41.215
Oh, great. Well, thanks for having me. I look

13
00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:41.805
forward to it.

14
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.169
So, just to introduce the topic and perhaps for

15
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.189
people who might not be very familiar with it,

16
00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.540
what is a generation label and particularly researchers who

17
00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:55.990
use generation labels, what do they usually mean by

18
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.790
the word generation?

19
00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:00.080
Well, it's interesting that you put it that way

20
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.410
because um they're mostly they're used less by researchers

21
00:01:04.419 --> 00:01:08.019
and more by journalists uh people in marketing and

22
00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:11.430
business. Um uh So, so you can tell I'm

23
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.330
already critical by the way, I say that um

24
00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:18.099
uh but uh what, what they're trying to capture

25
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.389
is um and the in the best case scenario

26
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.309
where they're trying to capture is a collective experience

27
00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.550
that people have by virtue of um being born

28
00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:32.500
in a common era, essentially a period of some

29
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.410
kind. Um And I, and, and they, they, they

30
00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:40.239
may be called generations because they um are in

31
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.279
the, in the, in the realm of the length

32
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.199
of a human generation that is, they're not a

33
00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.199
minute or a week or a single year. Um

34
00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.080
There's something like 15 or 20 years. It varies

35
00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:53.190
depending on who is using the terms. But when

36
00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:55.519
you're talking in that range of a period, you

37
00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:56.879
know, all the people born in a, in a

38
00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:01.029
period of say 20 years, it's, it's, it's, it's

39
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.360
sort of like using the word decade. It's, it's

40
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.919
like a period that is a rec of recognizable

41
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.910
length. Um You know, they're not, they don't really

42
00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.119
match the length of human generations, but the idea

43
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.520
is to capture the co the common experience of

44
00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:17.490
people who lived through history um at uh at

45
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.779
the same time at the same age. So that's,

46
00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:22.619
that's, you know, that's powerful. Uh THAT in, indicates

47
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.720
having a certain amount uh in common in your

48
00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:25.240
life

49
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.550
and what, what would be the length of a

50
00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.339
human generation.

51
00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.300
Well, it totally depends. I mean, some people have

52
00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.580
Children when they're 12 and some people have Children

53
00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.910
when they're 52. So you have a, you know,

54
00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.419
you can have a, you can have a 12

55
00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:43.770
year generation span or a or AAA 50 year

56
00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:48.029
generation span. Um So, uh you know, there's an

57
00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:50.960
average um but II I think it makes sense

58
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.449
to speak of generations in family terms in the

59
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.050
sense that um um I am a um a

60
00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:02.690
third generation immigrant that is my grandparents were immigrants

61
00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.690
to my country. Um So, in that sense, it's

62
00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.960
not a measure of years, It's a measure literally

63
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.360
of generations within a family. Um uh And, and

64
00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:14.160
so, in that case, you know, you can look

65
00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.529
at the average like what is the average age

66
00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:20.529
of, of mothers or fathers when they have Children?

67
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.309
And it would be somewhere in the twenties or

68
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.750
thirties in um in developed societies today. Um So

69
00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.589
you could, you could think of the length in

70
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.550
those terms.

71
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.720
Mhm But you, you mentioned there that, of course,

72
00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:38.119
these generation labels that some people use do not

73
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.940
correspond to the average uh reproductive generation in humans.

74
00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.490
So is that, is that a problem? I mean,

75
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.949
and in what ways could it be a problem?

76
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.429
Um I, I that's not a, that's not a

77
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.460
fundamental problem. I think the reason they are, they

78
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.809
have sort of in the popular usage where we

79
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.449
talk about silent baby boom, millennial, gen X, millennial

80
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.190
generation Z alpha, whatever we, whatever we're up to

81
00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.699
now. Um IN that popular usage, they have gotten

82
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.729
shorter. Um uh In, in that um the baby

83
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.980
boom generation such as called generation. The baby boom

84
00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:24.760
was an 18 year period. Um uh 1946 to

85
00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:28.869
1964 in the United States at least. Um So,

86
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.859
uh but since then they've gotten shorter and it's

87
00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:34.480
reasonable in the sense that um that the, that

88
00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:38.489
the popular attention span has gotten shorter. Um And,

89
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.359
and, and that's not a, that's not an insult.

90
00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:43.420
That also means that things change more rapidly, mostly

91
00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:46.570
because of technology. So, for example, you can talk

92
00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:49.730
about the different generations of the iphone. Um YOU

93
00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:52.109
know, it's 1/7 generation or, or some other piece

94
00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:54.929
of technology or Wi Fi, we've used five G

95
00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:57.209
for uh internet, you know, that's like a new

96
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.660
generation in the technological terms. And so it's generational

97
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.209
in the sense that it's a new period and

98
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.140
it replaces the previous one or the old, the

99
00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:08.410
previous one becomes older and out of date like

100
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.690
human generations. Um Those can be any link, you

101
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.410
know, iphone can come out with a new model

102
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.010
10 times a year if they want to or

103
00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:19.369
their operating system. Um So it, it, it may,

104
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.679
if, if our experiences are determined by these technological

105
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.959
forces. Um Like, you know, we, we can talk

106
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.589
about things that have shaped current young people, like

107
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.250
the introduction of the like button um on Facebook

108
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.269
or Instagram uh or the uh the introduction of

109
00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.649
um short video services like Vine or tiktok um

110
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.579
thing, these things have happened in rapid succession and

111
00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:47.100
really changed the dynamics of, of young, of teenage

112
00:05:47.109 --> 00:05:50.500
life basically. So you might think about things that

113
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.519
are like generations but are shorter, but in real

114
00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:57.029
human terms, um in reproductive terms, our generations are

115
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.559
getting longer because the age at childbirth is rising.

116
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.390
Um So, so they're kind of going in opposite

117
00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:03.079
directions

118
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.269
and how do they determine the division between generations?

119
00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.670
I mean, does it have any scientific basis or

120
00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:15.519
it's simply arbitrary? And if it's arbitrary, I mean,

121
00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:19.459
are there any specific criteria that people use or?

122
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.589
Um BASICALLY, no. Um And that's really the main,

123
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.279
my main criticism of the whole concept is that

124
00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:29.239
if you're gonna use categories in science or social

125
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.820
science, you have to use categories. Um That's a

126
00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:34.429
key, you know, it's always been a central feature

127
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.140
of science is creating categories out of chaos. Um

128
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.720
uh If you're going to um create categories, you

129
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.510
have to have a reason. And there is no

130
00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:45.929
reason for the um for the division between say

131
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.130
generation X and millennial. I mean, I like to

132
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.619
use the example of um Venus and Serena Williams

133
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.119
where Venus um the older sister is generation X

134
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.959
and Serena is millennial and they're one year apart.

135
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.049
Um So it does not make any sense at

136
00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:02.839
all to, to discuss those siblings who grew up

137
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.269
so close um in the same social milieu as

138
00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:08.700
being from different generations. And the same generation of

139
00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:12.700
their family, the same generation in society, it's nonsensical.

140
00:07:12.769 --> 00:07:15.959
But um what's essentially what happened is that um

141
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:19.109
it's become a competitive process like in the world

142
00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:21.109
of marketing and business where if you can get

143
00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:23.429
the, if you can, if you can I announce

144
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.649
a new generation and get the label to stick

145
00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:29.910
and become a viral concept, um then you can

146
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.730
um uh then you win and you're, you're, then

147
00:07:33.739 --> 00:07:36.540
you can sell books or other products. So, um

148
00:07:36.549 --> 00:07:39.670
it's a little uh uh you know, it's my

149
00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:42.209
major criticism is that there is no, there is

150
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.399
no reason for the lines drawn between the generations.

151
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.929
Um And for that reason, you really should not.

152
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.579
Um I mean, I could, I could elaborate on

153
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:53.799
that but one thing that you, we use arbitrary

154
00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:57.140
definitions all the time, for example, years of years

155
00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:59.459
have a have a basis in the solar system.

156
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.540
It's not crazy. But um in, in some, in

157
00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:05.339
some cases, we use years just because data is

158
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.355
arranged that way. We may use hours, weeks, you

159
00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:12.265
know, um or, or uh but, but it's, it's,

160
00:08:12.274 --> 00:08:15.084
if you're going to use them arbitrary definition, you

161
00:08:15.095 --> 00:08:17.505
have to explain this is arbitrary and we're using

162
00:08:17.515 --> 00:08:20.434
it for convenience decades. I use decades all the

163
00:08:20.445 --> 00:08:23.144
time in my research as a first pass through

164
00:08:23.154 --> 00:08:26.260
the data. Um But, you know, in, in, as

165
00:08:26.269 --> 00:08:28.339
a demographer, we use age all the time. Age

166
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.720
is very important how old are people? Um, AND

167
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.820
we tend to use specific ages when it really

168
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.289
matters. Such as, um, if I'm talking about, um,

169
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.750
uh, births, women having births, I'll put women age

170
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.974
15 to 18 in one category 18 is the

171
00:08:43.984 --> 00:08:46.655
age of majority, at least in the USA legal

172
00:08:46.664 --> 00:08:50.465
majority and then 18 to 24. Um, THAT'S kind

173
00:08:50.474 --> 00:08:52.604
of getting most people through the college years and

174
00:08:52.614 --> 00:08:55.585
then after that just five year blocks, 24 to

175
00:08:55.594 --> 00:08:58.534
2930 to 34. And, and to be clear, it's

176
00:08:58.544 --> 00:09:02.539
arbitrary, we're grouping people just for convenience. If the

177
00:09:02.549 --> 00:09:04.419
generations were treated that way, it would make more

178
00:09:04.429 --> 00:09:08.909
sense. But once you create categories, give them names

179
00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:12.599
and fix their boundaries without any basis in uh

180
00:09:12.609 --> 00:09:15.969
reality, then you're really at risk of creating um

181
00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:17.250
false reality.

182
00:09:18.429 --> 00:09:21.760
And isn't it the case that also these labels

183
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:27.820
that are used uh sometimes worldwide like baby boomers,

184
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.340
Gen X millennials and Gen Z um are mostly

185
00:09:32.349 --> 00:09:35.809
or apply mostly to the U si mean, because

186
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.650
for example, just to give an example, the baby

187
00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:44.239
boom phenomenon didn't happened even in my own country,

188
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.289
Portugal. I mean, because we didn't participate at least

189
00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:52.780
directly in World War Two, we didn't have casualties

190
00:09:52.789 --> 00:09:55.840
like other countries have. And so back in the

191
00:09:55.849 --> 00:09:59.900
fifties, sixties, we didn't really have a baby boom

192
00:09:59.909 --> 00:10:03.049
here. So doesn't it apply mostly to the US

193
00:10:03.059 --> 00:10:05.340
and perhaps a few other countries?

194
00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:08.179
Yes. Well, it is definitely a it's in that

195
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.330
sense, it's an instrument of cultural hegemony. Um OR

196
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.080
imperialism is not, um is not reasonable for the

197
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.849
point of view of science at all. Um You

198
00:10:16.859 --> 00:10:19.289
know, the baby boom, you know, some, a lot

199
00:10:19.299 --> 00:10:21.260
of countries had something like a baby boom after

200
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.739
the war. Um APOLOGIZE for that noise by the

201
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.320
way, that's my rabbit. It's, I don't know if

202
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.250
you can hear that noise. Um um The, the,

203
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.369
the baby boom in the United States began in

204
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.770
1946 not just in 1946 in July of 1946

205
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.500
which really has to do with the timing of

206
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.349
the soldiers coming home from the war. There was

207
00:10:41.359 --> 00:10:43.849
a huge increase in births and it wasn't until

208
00:10:43.859 --> 00:10:46.849
1964 that they went back below that birth rate.

209
00:10:46.859 --> 00:10:49.869
So that's a distinct period. Um, COUNTRIES that didn't

210
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.559
have a baby boom. There's no reason to talk

211
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.950
about the baby boom as a generation. Although they

212
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.780
still lived in that world, it was a post

213
00:10:55.789 --> 00:10:58.590
war world and they may have things in common.

214
00:10:58.599 --> 00:11:00.280
Um, IT was the beginning of the Cold War.

215
00:11:00.289 --> 00:11:03.440
Like if you have a specific reason to group

216
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.429
people that it's always, it's always, you know, it

217
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.659
can always be useful to do that, but you

218
00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:10.380
need to have a reason to do that. For

219
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.539
example, September 11th, the attacks of September 11th in

220
00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:18.419
the United States changed our, uh, government's posture towards

221
00:11:18.429 --> 00:11:22.039
Islam and terrorism and global relations in ways that

222
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:25.039
did affect other countries also. Um, BUT other countries

223
00:11:25.049 --> 00:11:28.099
had major terrorist attacks that changed their, um, that

224
00:11:28.109 --> 00:11:31.820
changed their perspective. Um, AND so all together that

225
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.500
is sort of an era. Um, BUT to start

226
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.479
it on a certain date or something, it, it,

227
00:11:36.489 --> 00:11:39.599
it, it's worse than arbitrary. You're right because it's

228
00:11:39.609 --> 00:11:43.130
specifically in, from the dominant perspective and, and one

229
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.539
of the problems with the stereotyping of, of generations

230
00:11:47.549 --> 00:11:50.099
is also the dominant group within that, when people

231
00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:54.599
say, oh, millennials, you know, um millennials like avocado

232
00:11:54.609 --> 00:11:57.479
toast or they spend too much money on coffee.

233
00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.780
There's a class and race bias in that um

234
00:12:00.789 --> 00:12:03.369
in that um perception of the, of the group,

235
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.359
if you're going to define the whole generation, well,

236
00:12:05.369 --> 00:12:08.559
obviously, you know, millennials in Gaza don't have the

237
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.030
same issue, right? So it's um there's, there's a

238
00:12:12.039 --> 00:12:14.059
um there's a, there's a risk of not just

239
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.219
collapsing reality but collapsing it around the dominant um

240
00:12:17.229 --> 00:12:18.179
perspective.

241
00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.469
And uh since I just mentioned, the baby boomers,

242
00:12:22.479 --> 00:12:26.130
do you think that at least perhaps a few

243
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.419
generations that people identify as such would make it

244
00:12:30.429 --> 00:12:34.200
would make sense to group people in that way?

245
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.929
Because for example, the baby boom period, they represent

246
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.929
a distinct demographic event, right? So at least, do

247
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.520
you think that that generation, it makes sense to

248
00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:48.239
talk about it that way and to group people

249
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:52.599
from 1946 up to 1964 together or not,

250
00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:57.219
it's a reasonable um It, it's a reasonable hypothesis

251
00:12:57.229 --> 00:12:58.909
that they have things in common and we know

252
00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:01.739
that some things they do. For example, you know,

253
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.250
when there's a huge increase in the number of

254
00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.820
Children, it created crowding in schools, it created um

255
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.349
certain conditions, it created um a marriage squeeze is

256
00:13:10.479 --> 00:13:12.929
because men like to marry women who are a

257
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.960
few years younger. So when there's a huge increase

258
00:13:15.969 --> 00:13:17.450
in birth rates, all of a sudden, you have

259
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.640
a group of men who have no, not enough

260
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.070
women a few years younger. Um So it's a

261
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.859
squeeze for men or it's a benefit, I suppose

262
00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:25.940
for women if they're straight and looking for older

263
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.590
men. Um So, um yeah, there's a commonality to

264
00:13:29.599 --> 00:13:32.070
the experience of the baby boom and it probably

265
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.090
the fact that the baby boom was 18 years

266
00:13:34.099 --> 00:13:37.229
long um may be why we got off on

267
00:13:37.239 --> 00:13:39.830
this whole generation thing in a way because it

268
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.099
was about the length of a generation. And when

269
00:13:42.109 --> 00:13:44.340
it was over, people sort of started looking for

270
00:13:44.349 --> 00:13:47.909
something to call the next group of people. Um

271
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.099
And it took it, you know, it took a

272
00:13:49.109 --> 00:13:51.929
few years for that narrative to emerge, but eventually

273
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.489
it did. Um And, and the actually the idea

274
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.549
of generation X was sort of like it was

275
00:13:56.559 --> 00:13:58.659
X because it was a forgotten generation. It was

276
00:13:58.669 --> 00:14:00.969
in the shadow of the baby boom, it was

277
00:14:00.979 --> 00:14:03.760
a smaller group. Um And so there was a

278
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.510
logic to the initial roll out of these concepts.

279
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.630
Not like anybody sat down and planned it, but

280
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.630
it emerged culturally with some cultural logic. Um But

281
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.059
you have to be careful. I mean, the baby

282
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.380
boom um did not have one experience on a

283
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.419
lot of dimensions, at least in the US. Um

284
00:14:20.429 --> 00:14:22.320
THE early baby boom. If you were born in

285
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.419
1946 you were had a much higher chance of

286
00:14:26.429 --> 00:14:28.619
serving uh in the Vietnam War than if you

287
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.179
were born in 1964. So for so for so

288
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.450
the the the the early versus the late baby

289
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.059
boom, by the time the late baby boom was

290
00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.900
growing up, it was a different world from the

291
00:14:38.909 --> 00:14:41.159
early baby boom. So, in fact, one of the

292
00:14:41.169 --> 00:14:42.799
things that really defines the baby boom is how

293
00:14:42.809 --> 00:14:45.150
much life changed for them. If you look at

294
00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:49.479
women's rights, women's employment and education levels, the difference

295
00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:53.840
between 46 and 64 is totally transformative. Um So

296
00:14:53.849 --> 00:14:57.020
um they shared a common de one common demographic

297
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.760
event, but it's sort of like, um you know,

298
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.109
like I say September 11th, you know, uh people

299
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.750
experience that moment, but you have to really look

300
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.619
at how did that change life forever after that?

301
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.989
Did it change people? You know, if we talk

302
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.409
about the, the pandemic, uh the COVID-19 pandemic, did

303
00:15:14.419 --> 00:15:17.580
that change? Uh How did that affect K people

304
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.530
in early elementary school versus people in high school.

305
00:15:20.539 --> 00:15:22.590
You know, they were all kids during the pandemic

306
00:15:22.599 --> 00:15:26.549
but graduating in 2020 entering the labor market is

307
00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:30.549
very different from entering first grade in 2020. Right.

308
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.119
Yeah. A and do we know if people even

309
00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:39.640
identify themselves with their own supposed generation? I mean,

310
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.349
like, for example, if someone was, was born in

311
00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:47.780
1986 87 and they say, and they look at

312
00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:51.000
someone born in 1990 they say, oh, I don't

313
00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.340
have anything in common with this person. I mean,

314
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.979
I would imagine that that phenomenon would be very

315
00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:59.280
common, right? And then perhaps some of that also

316
00:15:59.289 --> 00:16:02.419
has to do with the stereotypes we attach to

317
00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:06.700
each generation. Perhaps someone from 1986 wouldn't want to

318
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:11.619
be uh grouped together with someone who has particular

319
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.909
stereotypes from the 19 nineties attached to them,

320
00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:19.099
right? Yeah. Uh It's interesting. Um I think, you

321
00:16:19.109 --> 00:16:22.429
know, as the terms have become common um most,

322
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.070
but by no means all people, if you give

323
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.619
them a list of generation names can pick the

324
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.229
one that they're supposed to be part of. Um

325
00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:33.340
Although when you get near the edges, the accuracy

326
00:16:33.349 --> 00:16:35.500
declines quite a bit. There's a good paper by

327
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.330
Andrew Lindner and colleagues about this um where the

328
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.140
people who are in the middle of their generation

329
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.780
are pretty good in their generation according to the

330
00:16:43.789 --> 00:16:46.859
PEW research categories, which is a common, a common

331
00:16:46.869 --> 00:16:49.590
uh framing. Um But one of the things that's

332
00:16:49.599 --> 00:16:51.820
is, uh, when you say people don't identify or

333
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.669
do identify, um, it has to do with youth.

334
00:16:54.679 --> 00:16:57.380
Um, AND so there is a, there's a sense

335
00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.419
in which these generations really become vehicles for the

336
00:17:01.429 --> 00:17:05.709
age old, um, problem of kids these days. So

337
00:17:05.719 --> 00:17:09.079
it's always older people talking about younger people and,

338
00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.368
you know, so people say, oh, my college, I'm

339
00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.098
a college professor. People say, oh, my students today,

340
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.560
um they don't know, you know, they don't read

341
00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:19.089
books or something like that. And so instead of

342
00:17:19.098 --> 00:17:22.430
saying kids these days don't read books, they'll say

343
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.219
generation Z doesn't read books and it's, it's not

344
00:17:26.229 --> 00:17:29.449
really there. They should be speaking about that is

345
00:17:29.459 --> 00:17:31.770
we don't really know if that same group will

346
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.670
not read books when they're 40. Um uh IN

347
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.390
the same way that millennials, you know, read books

348
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.760
when they're 40. Right? So, but so it becomes

349
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.729
kids these days, the stereotype attaches to them and

350
00:17:44.739 --> 00:17:46.270
then in a way they live the rest of

351
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.310
their lives in the shadow of that stereotype. Um

352
00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:51.270
And so there is a sense, there is a

353
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.520
way that people and it, it frustrates me that

354
00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:56.989
people spend a lot of time and energy worrying

355
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
about the stereotype. Oh, they say I'm a millennial

356
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.479
but I feel more like I'm generation X or

357
00:18:02.489 --> 00:18:04.790
I'm a late millennial because I, you know, because

358
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.510
I don't own a house, you know, so I'm

359
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.760
more like generation Z or something. And then, and

360
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.750
so this is this, this constant churning and worrying

361
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.939
and debating and arguing about whether or not people

362
00:18:14.949 --> 00:18:17.439
belong in these categories, which are really quite pointless.

363
00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.589
Um So it's, I mean, it's life but it's

364
00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:21.900
frustrating sometimes.

365
00:18:22.619 --> 00:18:26.760
Uh And do you think that naming generations or

366
00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:31.530
using generation labels might promote pseudoscience? And if so,

367
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.579
in what ways?

368
00:18:32.849 --> 00:18:37.439
Well, um I think, yes. Um, IT, it's not

369
00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:40.280
necessarily super harmful. Um If you're, if you put,

370
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.869
if you put the alphabetizing the labels is, is

371
00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.209
probably helpful. Um Although like I said, generation X

372
00:18:46.219 --> 00:18:48.119
had a specific meaning, like we didn't start with

373
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.319
generation A right? We started with Generation X because

374
00:18:51.329 --> 00:18:54.119
it was sort of the invisible or the absent

375
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:58.849
or the, you know, the neglected. Um So, you

376
00:18:58.859 --> 00:19:02.550
know, uh uh it's, it's not totally benign but

377
00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.699
um if you name them people, like if you

378
00:19:04.709 --> 00:19:07.760
name them, like the greatest generation, um the silent

379
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.630
generation, like you can think of really very silent

380
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.270
members of the silent generation like Martin Luther King

381
00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:17.449
or um you know, not very silent. Um So

382
00:19:17.459 --> 00:19:19.739
uh uh there, there is, I think it just

383
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.510
promotes, you know, if you do research and you

384
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.189
identify characteristics of a group and you can put

385
00:19:26.199 --> 00:19:28.869
some boundaries around it and they fit some model,

386
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.390
then go ahead and give it an appropriate name.

387
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.939
But I would not, I would not based on

388
00:19:33.949 --> 00:19:38.900
some marketing or, or consumer behavior or a particular

389
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.560
piece of technology or the internet or something like

390
00:19:41.569 --> 00:19:45.099
that, identify an entire group and assume that other

391
00:19:45.109 --> 00:19:48.260
uh that, that, that the commonality of their experience

392
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.619
on this one thing like did they have iphones

393
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.270
um extends to the other aspects of their life,

394
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.609
like their labor market experience or their marriage or

395
00:19:55.619 --> 00:19:59.300
family outcomes, right? So, um the, the, the where

396
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.760
it becomes pseudoscience is when you call, you use

397
00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:06.689
the category without empirical justification based on, you know,

398
00:20:06.699 --> 00:20:09.650
either based on nothing or based on one facet

399
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.150
of their lives without um you know, critically thinking

400
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.439
about whether it applies to other aspects of their

401
00:20:15.449 --> 00:20:15.969
lives.

402
00:20:17.239 --> 00:20:21.380
So walk us through perhaps some of the main

403
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:25.650
stereotypes that people tend to attach to which generation

404
00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:30.140
from the silent generation through baby boomers, Gen X

405
00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:33.520
uh millennials and Gen Z, what are some of

406
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:37.040
the most common stereotypes associated with each of them?

407
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.900
Um That's actually pretty difficult if you look at

408
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.380
the common popular lists of stereotypes, it's a little

409
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:47.859
bit like astrology in that they may be self

410
00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.540
centered but altruistic, you know, they may, they may

411
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.760
be um they may be lazy but um but

412
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:57.040
um but extremely dedicated to certain issues. Um So,

413
00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:58.890
but there certainly are, I mean, if you look

414
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.089
at the, the um the transition over time, they've

415
00:21:03.099 --> 00:21:06.900
become more uh more um uh associated with particular

416
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.479
technologies um especially digital technologies. Um THE baby boom

417
00:21:11.489 --> 00:21:14.349
had the baby boom generation had a reputation for

418
00:21:14.359 --> 00:21:20.239
being, um, uh, for driving social change. Um, uh,

419
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.689
IN terms of like protesting the Vietnam war and,

420
00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:26.459
um, uh, and women's rights and civil rights. Um,

421
00:21:26.469 --> 00:21:30.250
AND, um, uh, and then at some point there,

422
00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.410
the stereotype of them flipped and they became, um,

423
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.170
you know, old, um, um, lazy liberals who don't

424
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.569
really think critically anymore. And if you think of

425
00:21:39.579 --> 00:21:44.569
like Bill Clinton. So, um, uh you know, it,

426
00:21:44.579 --> 00:21:47.770
it um they, they're not stable in that, in

427
00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.839
that way, but it is the case that, you

428
00:21:49.849 --> 00:21:52.239
know, millennials are perceived as having had a hard

429
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.569
life because of the timing of the great recession

430
00:21:55.579 --> 00:21:58.280
and then the pandemic. So, like they've had early

431
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.900
adulthood and middle adulthood have been challenged by these

432
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:04.770
serious events. Um uh AND, and they, you know,

433
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.260
they have their own, um their own sets of

434
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.780
neuroses and so on that came from that generation

435
00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.699
Z is living in this um in this period

436
00:22:12.709 --> 00:22:15.199
of anxiety. And, um you know, this is the

437
00:22:15.209 --> 00:22:18.750
Jonathan hate version from uh uh about so how

438
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.839
social media is ruining their lives and their mental

439
00:22:20.849 --> 00:22:23.969
health. Um And there is, you know, these things

440
00:22:23.979 --> 00:22:25.969
are not, these things are not crazy, they're not

441
00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:29.000
unrelated to experience, but I don't even like to

442
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.900
um to get very specific about the um what

443
00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.069
they're supposed to be like. But, you know, I,

444
00:22:35.079 --> 00:22:37.050
I maybe you're playing to get to this. So

445
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.060
tell me if I should um you know, talk

446
00:22:39.069 --> 00:22:41.910
about this later, but you know, the, the concept

447
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.510
of cohort um uh and life course experience uh

448
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.390
is very important and very real, the age at

449
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.750
which you experience historical events um really matters. So

450
00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.630
what in demography we call age period and cohort,

451
00:22:55.869 --> 00:22:58.949
you know, you are, you're um you're five years

452
00:22:58.959 --> 00:23:02.479
old uh at the moment that the a certain

453
00:23:02.489 --> 00:23:04.790
historical event happens and you can, you have that

454
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.560
in common with other people who are that age

455
00:23:06.569 --> 00:23:09.770
at that time, that historical moment. So this is

456
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.540
a very important insight. You know, if you had,

457
00:23:12.709 --> 00:23:14.729
if you were, if you were, if you were

458
00:23:14.739 --> 00:23:17.900
12 years old in 2005 versus 12 years old

459
00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.890
in 2015, the, the, the, the, the second group

460
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.209
had social media in middle school. Um And it

461
00:23:25.219 --> 00:23:27.089
changed their, you know, it may have changed their

462
00:23:27.099 --> 00:23:29.900
lives forever. If you entered the labor market during

463
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.699
the pandemic, you may earn less for your, the

464
00:23:32.709 --> 00:23:34.729
rest of your life because your first job you

465
00:23:34.739 --> 00:23:38.229
took was not, was not advantageous versus entering during

466
00:23:38.239 --> 00:23:41.599
a boom year. Um So there are ways in

467
00:23:41.609 --> 00:23:44.859
which, you know, that it's important to think about

468
00:23:44.869 --> 00:23:49.449
the, the age at which you encounter historical moments.

469
00:23:49.619 --> 00:23:52.069
Um AND how that casts a shadow or has

470
00:23:52.079 --> 00:23:56.349
momentum through um through people's their lives. So I

471
00:23:56.359 --> 00:23:58.949
anything bad I say about generation concepts should not

472
00:23:58.959 --> 00:24:02.449
be taken to undermine the, the, the the powerful

473
00:24:02.459 --> 00:24:05.459
in insight of, of what we call life course

474
00:24:05.469 --> 00:24:08.010
theory or the idea that the timing of events

475
00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.890
affects everything that comes after.

476
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.410
And since you introduced the topic already, the topic

477
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.589
of cohort and life course research, do you think

478
00:24:16.599 --> 00:24:21.079
that generation levels might also affect it in any

479
00:24:21.089 --> 00:24:21.410
way?

480
00:24:22.229 --> 00:24:25.300
Well, um it, they, I think they muddy the

481
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:28.119
waters um uh like and, but on the other

482
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.650
hand, one reason that they are so powerful and

483
00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.520
they have such um currency in the culture, I

484
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.670
think it's because they capture this insight. So it's

485
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.369
a give and take. You know, I think if

486
00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.709
you see most serious researchers, the vast majority of

487
00:24:41.719 --> 00:24:44.880
serious researchers would not use these generation cat worries

488
00:24:45.189 --> 00:24:47.579
and especially not with their labels. And if you

489
00:24:47.589 --> 00:24:49.829
think about the terms, you know, the baby boom

490
00:24:49.839 --> 00:24:52.160
is 18 years, millennials are like 16 years, I

491
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:55.439
don't know, generation Z is maybe only 14 years

492
00:24:55.449 --> 00:24:57.349
and they're changing and they're, but the, the lines

493
00:24:57.359 --> 00:24:59.949
are arbitrary. So we had a um we had

494
00:24:59.959 --> 00:25:02.880
a campaign a few years ago of, of demographers

495
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.760
and other social scientists and we wrote to the

496
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.520
Pew Research Center and we said, you know, we

497
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.359
beg you to stop framing all of your research

498
00:25:10.369 --> 00:25:13.339
in terms of generation labels. Um And they had

499
00:25:13.349 --> 00:25:15.630
been doing that in a way that and they're

500
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.109
very effective science communicators and they do really important

501
00:25:18.119 --> 00:25:20.810
research. Um AND their stuff was very important. Uh

502
00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:24.310
They did subsequently change their practice and they now

503
00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:28.790
only um describe people in generational terms when they

504
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.060
have sort of generational data. That is if you're

505
00:25:32.069 --> 00:25:35.750
just, if you're doing a survey today of people

506
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.040
by age and you say, oh, look, 60 year

507
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.810
olds are more likely to have been divorced than

508
00:25:40.819 --> 00:25:42.849
30 year olds or something like that or more

509
00:25:42.859 --> 00:25:46.069
likely to get their news from print media. Um

510
00:25:46.099 --> 00:25:49.369
You should not describe that in generational terms. Uh

511
00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.869
UNLESS you have some longitudinal sense that, that, that

512
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.780
the characteristics of that cohort adhere to them over

513
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.500
time. If you're just doing a survey today and

514
00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.319
you say old people read the newspaper and young

515
00:26:00.329 --> 00:26:03.140
people get their news from tiktok, that's age, that's

516
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:06.739
not necessarily cohort, right? So that distinction is very

517
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.469
important. It becomes a cohort effect or a cohort

518
00:26:09.479 --> 00:26:12.489
phenomenon when that carries with them through their lives

519
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.760
or has some effect um over the course of

520
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:19.310
their lives. So forcing things into the generational frame

521
00:26:19.319 --> 00:26:21.989
can limit your ability to understand the phenomena you're

522
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.099
actually looking at, I guess, is one way to

523
00:26:24.109 --> 00:26:24.569
put it,

524
00:26:24.829 --> 00:26:28.930
right? And how should cohorts then be delineated? I

525
00:26:28.939 --> 00:26:32.589
mean, in terms of time periods, how do you

526
00:26:32.599 --> 00:26:33.550
look at it?

527
00:26:33.829 --> 00:26:39.069
Yeah. Um Well, like uh our data usually comes

528
00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:41.969
in years. Um And like I said, years have

529
00:26:41.979 --> 00:26:44.239
a basis in the, in the, in the solar

530
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.920
calendar. It's not um you could use a lunar

531
00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:49.760
calendar. Solar calendar makes more sense for our seasons.

532
00:26:49.849 --> 00:26:53.160
Um uh And so, you know, um I start

533
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.599
by putting people in years. Um And then, and

534
00:26:55.609 --> 00:26:58.010
we can see, for example, Children born in January

535
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:00.150
are different from Children born in December because of

536
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.709
the way society organizes itself in calendar years. Um

537
00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:06.719
So that can be important. OK. So, but if

538
00:27:06.729 --> 00:27:09.359
you look at your 70 71 72 OK? In

539
00:27:09.369 --> 00:27:11.130
fact, even the baby boom, like I said, it

540
00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:14.339
started in July of 1946. But maybe if you

541
00:27:14.349 --> 00:27:17.670
put everybody born in 1946 together, they probably had

542
00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.750
a similar experience because they all started school the

543
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.660
same year. Even though the ones born in May

544
00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.939
weren't really part of the baby boom, right? So

545
00:27:24.949 --> 00:27:27.790
the calendar is a very powerful thing. OK? Years

546
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.869
are pretty good if you're gonna start grouping them

547
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.520
and trying to define eras and periods. Um I

548
00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:36.170
would start with something that's deliberately arbitrary and clearly

549
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.800
arbitrary like decades. Um And so like, let's just

550
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:41.680
put them in groups of 10 years and see,

551
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.229
but if you have and then, and then you'll

552
00:27:44.239 --> 00:27:47.989
see, people say things like, well, the seventies didn't

553
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.150
really end until 1982. You know, they'll say based

554
00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.790
on fashion or music or something like that. I

555
00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.219
know the sixties, you know, the sixties really started

556
00:27:56.229 --> 00:27:58.979
with the first Rolling Stones concert in 1962 or

557
00:27:58.989 --> 00:28:02.109
something, you know, whatever I'm making these up. So

558
00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:04.290
then you can start to see that people start

559
00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:07.420
manipulating the categories. You start, maybe a demographer starts

560
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.180
with decades, but you start thinking critically and socially

561
00:28:10.189 --> 00:28:12.439
and you start to see that maybe the events

562
00:28:12.449 --> 00:28:14.920
you're looking at don't line up that way. Um

563
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.699
And I think the what, what you learn from

564
00:28:17.709 --> 00:28:19.650
that is that it depends on the question you're

565
00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.510
asking. So I would start with decades just to

566
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.119
look at the trend over a long period of

567
00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:26.310
time. But as soon as I have a specific

568
00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:30.530
question in mind, how did September 11th affect the

569
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.510
odds of volunteering to serve in the military? How

570
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.949
did the great recession of 2009 affect homeownership? Um,

571
00:28:37.959 --> 00:28:40.829
THEN you can start putting dates around it. Um,

572
00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:43.310
AND, and, and look at the particular thing that

573
00:28:43.319 --> 00:28:46.170
you're studying, I'm studying homeownership. I'm gonna pay a

574
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.229
lot of attention to 2008, 2009 in the United

575
00:28:49.239 --> 00:28:52.800
States. If you know, if I'm studying, um, uh,

576
00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:57.319
uh, uh, public health and, um, uh, career choices

577
00:28:57.329 --> 00:28:59.069
of young people, you know, I'm gonna look at

578
00:28:59.079 --> 00:29:03.920
the pandemic. Um, BUT that comes, that comes from

579
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.319
the research. It doesn't precede the research, um, as

580
00:29:07.329 --> 00:29:09.489
a, as a settled question. So it, it, it

581
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:13.079
really has to be handled theoretically and empirically not,

582
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.000
not predetermined. I mean, that's just not, that's the

583
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:17.079
way science should work.

584
00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:21.160
And also looking at people that are supposedly part

585
00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.589
of the same generation, isn't it also the case

586
00:29:23.599 --> 00:29:27.869
that we should look into other aspects like their

587
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.170
sociological aspects that affect their own life. For example,

588
00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.790
if people are part of different socio economic strata,

589
00:29:34.969 --> 00:29:38.444
I would imagine that they have very different life

590
00:29:38.454 --> 00:29:41.954
experiences and they go through life in many different

591
00:29:41.964 --> 00:29:46.734
ways. So, uh aren't there other factors that we

592
00:29:46.744 --> 00:29:51.385
should look into apart from the specific year or

593
00:29:51.395 --> 00:29:54.375
the specific period they might have been born in?

594
00:29:55.349 --> 00:29:57.829
Yeah, I mean, I think it's worth like when

595
00:29:57.839 --> 00:30:01.550
we talk about age period and cohort um the,

596
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.650
the the thing about period effects is there's sort

597
00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.719
of things that affect everybody, right? So recession, everybody

598
00:30:06.729 --> 00:30:09.640
lives in a recession. Of course, recession doesn't bother

599
00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:11.560
Elon Musk in the same way that it bothers

600
00:30:11.569 --> 00:30:14.449
a poor person. Um So, but they're still living,

601
00:30:14.459 --> 00:30:16.810
they're both living in it, right? So you can,

602
00:30:16.819 --> 00:30:18.890
you can look at that as a common experience,

603
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.069
but then you have to think about, ok, how

604
00:30:20.079 --> 00:30:22.459
does this affect them differently? So, one of the

605
00:30:22.469 --> 00:30:24.939
risks, like you, like we said before, of, of

606
00:30:24.949 --> 00:30:27.020
collapsing is that you end up looking at the

607
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:30.420
dominant category in the group. Um AND, and, and

608
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.329
miss missing others, but like you say, it's also

609
00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:36.199
about essentially different variables. So race and gender, nationality

610
00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:40.140
and socio-economic status may matter more um than the

611
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:43.540
cohort uh that you're born into for particular questions.

612
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:48.160
The, you know, another thing that happens is because,

613
00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:51.699
and this is probably changing over time because of

614
00:30:51.709 --> 00:30:55.469
our global and digital culture. Um The idea of

615
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:59.109
one age group having a unique experience separate from

616
00:30:59.119 --> 00:31:02.020
another one is less the case than it used

617
00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:04.520
to be. That is, you know, I use tiktok.

618
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.780
Um I'm old. Right. I don't use it. Well,

619
00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.349
I'm not like it but I like, I look

620
00:31:09.359 --> 00:31:12.020
at tiktok, I make videos of like my pets.

621
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.079
I put them on tiktok like there's no, uh

622
00:31:14.089 --> 00:31:16.150
there's no world where a young person lives in

623
00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.560
a tiktok world and an old person completely does

624
00:31:18.569 --> 00:31:23.489
not. Um And so, um uh especially around the

625
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.859
edges, you know, uh uh if you look at,

626
00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.839
you know, one of the things that has happened

627
00:31:28.849 --> 00:31:31.910
is that the, the life course, the sequence of

628
00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.459
events in the life course, like what we call

629
00:31:33.469 --> 00:31:38.390
emerging adulthood um or something where you school school

630
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.130
career, marriage, Children or whatever sequence. Um I say

631
00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.390
whatever because the sequence has become a lot more

632
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:49.910
variable. Um These things have become less rigidly ordered

633
00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.979
um than they were at least at, at one

634
00:31:51.989 --> 00:31:54.640
period in history and also more variable in terms

635
00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:57.310
of the length of these periods we talk about

636
00:31:57.319 --> 00:32:00.579
um delayed uh or delayed adulthood or something where

637
00:32:00.589 --> 00:32:03.099
it's, it's no longer really the case, at least

638
00:32:03.109 --> 00:32:06.449
in the US that people finish can be reliably

639
00:32:06.459 --> 00:32:09.800
said to have you stop measuring their education level

640
00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:12.349
at age 25 right. It used to be the

641
00:32:12.359 --> 00:32:14.890
Census Bureau in the US publishes all their statistics

642
00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.189
on education for people aged 25 and older. Assuming

643
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:21.589
they're done. Well, that's not the case anymore. Um

644
00:32:21.599 --> 00:32:23.150
And I know they know that, but that, that,

645
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.359
that's a traditional category is 25 plus to look

646
00:32:26.369 --> 00:32:30.930
at, at completed education or for, for fertility and

647
00:32:30.939 --> 00:32:33.319
birth rates. You know, it used to be thir,

648
00:32:33.329 --> 00:32:36.530
you know, 39 you know, um a above 39

649
00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.660
we're not gonna even measure ferti fertility because um

650
00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:42.219
women don't have babies after age 40. Well, now

651
00:32:42.229 --> 00:32:45.300
it's like, well, how about 49? Um So um

652
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:48.439
um the, the, the fact that the, the, the

653
00:32:48.449 --> 00:32:50.939
sequences have become less rigid and the periods have

654
00:32:50.949 --> 00:32:55.050
become more um more dispersed and more variable in

655
00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.390
terms of their length. Um M meth means that

656
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.310
the, the, the very idea of fixing categories around

657
00:33:02.319 --> 00:33:05.099
them has become harder. And if you are, if

658
00:33:05.109 --> 00:33:08.199
you're unemployed and, you know, single and living at

659
00:33:08.209 --> 00:33:13.930
your parents' house, if you're 36 versus 21 you

660
00:33:13.939 --> 00:33:15.709
have certain things in common, even though you're a

661
00:33:15.719 --> 00:33:18.479
very different age. Now, maybe the 36 year old

662
00:33:18.489 --> 00:33:21.439
now is in a more stigmatized category and um

663
00:33:21.449 --> 00:33:24.839
is more, more ashamed of their status, but in

664
00:33:24.849 --> 00:33:26.790
some ways, they have something in common with a

665
00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.810
21 year old who's also living in their parents'

666
00:33:28.819 --> 00:33:32.359
basement. Um And so, you know, the, the idea

667
00:33:32.369 --> 00:33:34.880
of, of fixing it around the birth year doesn't

668
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:35.920
make sense at that point.

669
00:33:36.979 --> 00:33:42.310
And our generations even official categories or entities. I

670
00:33:42.319 --> 00:33:46.520
mean, earlier, I asked you uh about the researchers

671
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:48.780
that might use them and you told me that

672
00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:51.989
there's not many researchers out there who, who use

673
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.839
generation labels. It's mostly journalists and specific kinds of

674
00:33:56.849 --> 00:34:01.650
organizations out there. So, are they considered official or?

675
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:06.119
It's funny people say um uh officially I'm a

676
00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:09.560
millennial but I feel like I'm generation Z or

677
00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:12.830
something. Um um But no, they're not official categories,

678
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.179
at least not in the US. And I don't

679
00:34:14.188 --> 00:34:17.280
not aware that they are anywhere else. Um You

680
00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:19.840
know, the baby boom was a demographic event and

681
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.379
that is, um which produced baby boomers in the

682
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:25.489
sense of people who are part of those birth

683
00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.010
cohorts. Um And, and I think that got us

684
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.958
going in that way, but the subsequent categories have

685
00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:35.554
no official status. And that's actually why the group

686
00:34:35.563 --> 00:34:38.215
of researchers and I approached the Pew Research Center

687
00:34:38.313 --> 00:34:41.715
because people had, people had, were clearly identifying the

688
00:34:41.725 --> 00:34:45.524
Pew categories um as sort of the standard categories

689
00:34:45.534 --> 00:34:48.735
and, and Pew had sort of an explainer website

690
00:34:48.745 --> 00:34:50.905
where they said like this is how we, this

691
00:34:50.915 --> 00:34:52.824
is how we drew the lines here and they

692
00:34:52.833 --> 00:34:58.159
had some vaguely empirical bases about September 11th or

693
00:34:58.169 --> 00:35:00.429
the internet or something like that. Um But they

694
00:35:00.439 --> 00:35:02.320
basically just said we're gonna use the, they said

695
00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:04.959
we know they're basically arbitrary, but once you name

696
00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:07.520
them and you use them, they start getting some,

697
00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.729
they start carrying their own weight. So these are

698
00:35:09.739 --> 00:35:10.959
that we're gonna kind of use them in a

699
00:35:10.969 --> 00:35:14.110
consistent way, at least. Um And so Pew is

700
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.189
very influential and that was the closest we had.

701
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:21.899
Um Gallup, another polling organization also um uh uh

702
00:35:21.909 --> 00:35:25.159
has been influential but there's nothing, there's no official

703
00:35:25.169 --> 00:35:27.850
status to these. Um And if you think about

704
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.219
the, um, uh, if you think about how the

705
00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:34.080
mile, the, the milestones in life have changed, you

706
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.550
know, we raised, we lowered the voting age from

707
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.989
21 to 18. We raised the drinking age to

708
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.050
21. Um, WE have raised the retirement age is

709
00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.270
on a schedule to, to, to gradually rise in

710
00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:50.219
the US with, um, social security. So even to

711
00:35:50.229 --> 00:35:53.909
the extent that there are official markers, um, they,

712
00:35:53.919 --> 00:35:56.149
they flex, you know, they vary over time as

713
00:35:56.159 --> 00:35:59.530
the population changes and the imperatives of those bureaucracies

714
00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.070
change.

715
00:36:00.469 --> 00:36:03.260
Mhm. Yeah, that's the other thing because even when

716
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:07.050
it comes to, uh, what we label as being

717
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.129
involved in a particular, uh, society and in a

718
00:36:10.139 --> 00:36:14.889
particular time period, it varies across the time and

719
00:36:14.899 --> 00:36:18.320
cultural context. Right? That's just an example, of course.

720
00:36:18.929 --> 00:36:20.729
Yeah, I mean, I think if you, in the

721
00:36:20.739 --> 00:36:23.209
US, we've had periods where people are very upset

722
00:36:23.219 --> 00:36:26.750
about teen pregnancy. Um, uh, YOU know, women having

723
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.090
women being pregnant and having Children, you know, in

724
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.899
their teen years. Well, that usually meant before 18

725
00:36:32.909 --> 00:36:35.770
because 18 they're adults. And, you know, and if

726
00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.669
you look at teen teen pregnancy in the 19

727
00:36:38.679 --> 00:36:42.989
fifties, um, they almost all got married between the

728
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.449
pregnancy and the birth. Um, SO we had a

729
00:36:45.459 --> 00:36:47.510
lot, we have a lot of people whose birth,

730
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.810
whose first birth was less than nine months after

731
00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.620
their marriage at that time. Um, AND, and people

732
00:36:52.629 --> 00:36:55.929
were not upset about teen births if the woman

733
00:36:55.939 --> 00:36:59.129
was married. So, so really the idea of the,

734
00:36:59.139 --> 00:37:02.219
the distress over the social problem of teen pregnancy

735
00:37:02.229 --> 00:37:04.889
and childbirth, which often is a problem, of course,

736
00:37:04.899 --> 00:37:06.659
and it is often, you know, it's not consensual,

737
00:37:06.669 --> 00:37:09.649
it's not planned, it has negative consequences, but it

738
00:37:09.659 --> 00:37:11.800
was really, it was really only in the context

739
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:15.110
of not marriage. Uh AND specifically in the context

740
00:37:15.175 --> 00:37:18.354
where women had other opportunities. So they, so, you

741
00:37:18.364 --> 00:37:20.655
know, when we were upset about teen pregnancy and

742
00:37:20.665 --> 00:37:23.514
childbirth in the eighties and nineties was partly because

743
00:37:23.524 --> 00:37:25.514
women could go to college. And if they were

744
00:37:25.524 --> 00:37:28.225
having a child at age 17 or 18, their

745
00:37:28.235 --> 00:37:30.455
chance of going to college and having a successful

746
00:37:30.465 --> 00:37:34.629
lucrative career was, was negatively impacted. If that was

747
00:37:34.639 --> 00:37:37.310
not the case, then you wouldn't necessarily be so

748
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.459
upset about women having Children at age 17. You

749
00:37:40.469 --> 00:37:43.139
know, in some senses, you know, biologically, it works

750
00:37:43.149 --> 00:37:45.479
pretty well. You know, it's only a problem if

751
00:37:45.489 --> 00:37:48.040
it's not consensual, if it has negative consequences if

752
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:50.340
they're, if they don't have adequate social support, if

753
00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:52.979
it's not what they want, um, which is, you

754
00:37:52.989 --> 00:37:56.100
know, often the case. But, um, anyway, so these,

755
00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.919
these things change. That's all I'm saying. I can't

756
00:37:57.929 --> 00:37:58.659
remember the question.

757
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:03.209
So, uh, earlier, we've touched a little bit on

758
00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:06.820
stereotypes. I mean, sometimes it's very unfortunate because even

759
00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:11.919
here in Portugal, even just recently, uh, journalists did

760
00:38:11.929 --> 00:38:17.350
a few pieces on how supposedly people from generation

761
00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.760
Z are lazier and they are more demanding in

762
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:24.030
their jobs and stuff like that. I mean, I,

763
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.760
I don't know if there's any specific research on

764
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:31.645
this, but if there's those stereotypes circulating around and

765
00:38:31.655 --> 00:38:35.334
particularly on mainstream media, couldn't it be the case

766
00:38:35.344 --> 00:38:38.495
that perhaps some of these people would even be

767
00:38:38.504 --> 00:38:41.925
discriminated when it comes to getting a job just

768
00:38:41.935 --> 00:38:45.205
because the employers have the sense that, oh, let's

769
00:38:45.215 --> 00:38:49.425
avoid the employing people from Gen Z because they

770
00:38:49.435 --> 00:38:53.314
might uh II, I mean, they might create problems

771
00:38:53.324 --> 00:38:55.364
in our company or something like that.

772
00:38:55.929 --> 00:38:59.209
Yeah. So, um the stereotypes for young people interviewing

773
00:38:59.219 --> 00:39:02.330
today include um they look at their phones during

774
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.419
the job interview, they bring their parents to a

775
00:39:04.429 --> 00:39:09.639
job interview. Um THEY make unreasonable demands um about

776
00:39:09.649 --> 00:39:11.790
um things that they should be grateful for like

777
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.570
having a coffee machine in the office or something,

778
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.750
snacks. Um AND sort of this, right, this spoiled

779
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.189
um uh privileged attitude, of course, very socioeconomically specific.

780
00:39:22.199 --> 00:39:25.260
Um But also quite wrong. Ok. But, you know,

781
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:29.239
things have changed. Um, SO, you know, the law

782
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:32.260
is different in different places, age discrimination is a,

783
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:35.649
is a real thing. Um, uh, IT'S not necessarily

784
00:39:35.659 --> 00:39:38.040
illegal in all cases but in some cases it

785
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.879
is specifically illegal. Um, AND, um, there, there, there

786
00:39:41.889 --> 00:39:43.610
was a, there was a little back and forth

787
00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.760
that I was, uh, uh, played a small role

788
00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.610
in when the, our National Academy of Sciences um

789
00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:53.489
did a um a study on um the use

790
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.800
of generation categories in employment, um decisions, hiring and

791
00:39:57.939 --> 00:40:00.560
um and personnel management. And the idea was there

792
00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:03.449
were some people saying, and there's a whole industry

793
00:40:03.459 --> 00:40:06.360
of consultants basically who will tell employers this is

794
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.439
how you should deal with, you know, kids these

795
00:40:08.449 --> 00:40:11.820
days. Um If you want to recruit the best

796
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.929
talent and hired and how to, how to treat

797
00:40:13.939 --> 00:40:15.840
them and how not to treat them and, and

798
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.919
it's, it's a combination of like a lot of

799
00:40:17.929 --> 00:40:21.300
business consulting, of stereotyping and certain kinds of insights.

800
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:24.229
Um On the other hand, um it can be

801
00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:27.610
a very pernicious and harmful if you're applying stereotypes

802
00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.959
based on age or birth year without considering the

803
00:40:30.969 --> 00:40:33.209
realities of the person in front of you. Um

804
00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:35.489
So you have to have reasonable, you know, uh

805
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.159
if your, if your, if your workforce is all

806
00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:41.929
over age 60 you probably wanna have um like

807
00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:45.330
make sure that you have adequate um uh physical

808
00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.939
access for people who have trouble climbing stairs. Right.

809
00:40:47.949 --> 00:40:50.000
That may be a, but you probably, you should

810
00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.860
do that regardless of the age of your employ.

811
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:54.500
But, um, but it may be like a sudden

812
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.790
imperative if you had a big influx of older

813
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.320
workers. Right. So, there's this kind of this back

814
00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:01.429
and forth where, um, you know, we should do

815
00:41:01.439 --> 00:41:04.379
things universally, we should treat people equally and according

816
00:41:04.389 --> 00:41:07.100
to their own behavior and qualities and characteristics. But

817
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.260
on the other hand, there are trends and patterns

818
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:12.469
that we want to pay attention to. Um So,

819
00:41:12.479 --> 00:41:15.419
and that's a reasonable back and forth um of

820
00:41:15.429 --> 00:41:17.280
thinking about how the world is changing and how

821
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:20.050
we should respond. There are great advantages to what

822
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.810
they call universal design with regard to disability. You

823
00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:27.350
know, everybody benefits from having all, all text on

824
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.659
an image on the, on social media, you know,

825
00:41:29.669 --> 00:41:32.000
a text that describes what the image is because

826
00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:34.270
it helps people, it helps machines, read them and

827
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.629
it helps uh and people who are visually impaired,

828
00:41:36.639 --> 00:41:40.330
everybody should have um all cities should have curb

829
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.149
cuts on their curbs at street corners because it

830
00:41:43.159 --> 00:41:45.679
makes everybody's life easier and better in addition to

831
00:41:45.689 --> 00:41:49.389
people who use wheelchairs. Ok. But um uh the

832
00:41:49.399 --> 00:41:53.090
the idea of, of, of a rigidly attaching those

833
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.989
to age categories is where it becomes, you know,

834
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.070
um harmful.

835
00:41:57.929 --> 00:42:00.429
So now let me ask you this, what is

836
00:42:00.439 --> 00:42:04.429
supposed to come after the Z since now we

837
00:42:04.439 --> 00:42:07.350
are at generation Z and Z is the last

838
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.620
letter of the alphabet. So what comes next?

839
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.429
Um, I think people are already using alpha for

840
00:42:13.439 --> 00:42:16.360
what's next. Um, UNLESS that's alpha is also Z,

841
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:17.739
no, I think alpha is supposed to be what's

842
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:20.590
next. Um, YOU know, if we settled into a

843
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:26.159
habit of, um, of arbitrary names like numbers or

844
00:42:26.169 --> 00:42:30.409
alphabet and fixed, fixed lengths, that wouldn't be the

845
00:42:30.419 --> 00:42:33.250
end of the world. But in that case, we

846
00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.169
may as well just use decades and call them

847
00:42:35.179 --> 00:42:37.840
decades. Um But um I think what you will

848
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:39.419
see and you already see is sort of a

849
00:42:39.429 --> 00:42:43.489
scramble for naming rights. Um The person who the

850
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.790
person who names them and has their name stick,

851
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.409
um can become a popular consultant and sell books

852
00:42:49.419 --> 00:42:52.320
and um uh and uh and have uh and

853
00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:55.300
get positive attention maybe for the better, maybe for

854
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.370
the worse. So, um uh uh one thing that

855
00:42:58.379 --> 00:43:00.639
happens with that is in the competition to name

856
00:43:00.649 --> 00:43:03.570
the next generation, they tend to get shorter because

857
00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.290
one comparative advantage in that competition is to get

858
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.459
your label to stick sooner. So you have to

859
00:43:08.469 --> 00:43:11.050
kind of roll it out quick. So I think

860
00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.479
if, if, if, if they don't become standardized in

861
00:43:13.489 --> 00:43:15.709
some way, I think we'll see this continued pressure

862
00:43:15.719 --> 00:43:19.229
to shorten generations and come up with um attractive

863
00:43:19.239 --> 00:43:22.169
names for them. I mean, millennial worked because it

864
00:43:22.179 --> 00:43:23.959
had to do with the millennium it had to

865
00:43:23.969 --> 00:43:26.979
do with the changing, with the year 2000. Um

866
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.570
So there was kind of, there was sort of

867
00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.090
a logic to it and after that it was

868
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.800
sort of like, oh, Z, you know, we're like,

869
00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:33.800
we're done with this. Um But of course, we're

870
00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:35.879
not done with this. It's like an addiction. Um

871
00:43:35.889 --> 00:43:39.080
So, so they stick. Um And, you know, we've

872
00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:42.159
made, we, you know, reasonable, social scientists have made

873
00:43:42.169 --> 00:43:45.270
some progress on this. I think we have successfully

874
00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:49.360
stig the use of the categories in serious research

875
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:52.340
um without an empirical basis in some quarters, at

876
00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:55.110
least, but I don't really believe we're gonna stop

877
00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.000
this practice and, you know, in the long run,

878
00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:58.750
it's not that important, but as long as we

879
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.340
just have to realize that possible downsides. So I

880
00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:04.570
don't know what they're gonna be called next, probably.

881
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.439
Um uh YOU know, maybe somebody will think, oh,

882
00:44:07.449 --> 00:44:09.469
it should be reasonable. Let's just use alphabet letters,

883
00:44:09.479 --> 00:44:11.459
but nobody's gonna wanna be b you know, if

884
00:44:11.469 --> 00:44:13.500
you have, you know, if generation A or alpha

885
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:16.010
um beta just sounds terrible and nobody wants to

886
00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.000
be that. So I assume there will be um

887
00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:20.280
you know, there'll be some, some something else will

888
00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:23.429
come along before um generation alpha is even done

889
00:44:23.439 --> 00:44:25.280
and the alphabet thing won't stick.

890
00:44:26.129 --> 00:44:28.600
But do you see a positive trend when it

891
00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:31.540
comes to how people use generation labels? I mean,

892
00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.780
do you see that for example, as you and

893
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:37.909
some of your other colleagues pointed to these issues

894
00:44:37.919 --> 00:44:40.860
that some people at least are dropping the use

895
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:44.219
of generation labels in their work or not. Yes,

896
00:44:44.229 --> 00:44:46.084
I think so. I mean, if I looked at

897
00:44:46.094 --> 00:44:48.885
the, um I looked at the occurrence of terms

898
00:44:49.364 --> 00:44:52.695
in the, in the social science literature and it

899
00:44:52.705 --> 00:44:55.844
really is quite concentrated in business and psychology now

900
00:44:55.854 --> 00:44:58.254
and business is really taking off. Um And so

901
00:44:58.264 --> 00:45:00.764
my knock on business research is, it's often, you

902
00:45:00.774 --> 00:45:03.635
know, not serious research, it's sort of fatty, it

903
00:45:03.645 --> 00:45:06.080
has to do with. Um um YOU know, people

904
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.189
trying to um just get generate attention for their

905
00:45:08.199 --> 00:45:11.770
consulting jobs. It's a total stereotype. It's completely unfair.

906
00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.239
So I, you know, I'm, I, I apologize. Um

907
00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.370
BUT it seems to be concentrated highly in business,

908
00:45:16.379 --> 00:45:19.090
which is interesting. Um And it, you know, it's,

909
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.520
it's, it has to do a little bit with

910
00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:23.669
the way business researchers communicate who they communicate with

911
00:45:23.679 --> 00:45:25.969
and so on. Um But I'm happy that um

912
00:45:25.979 --> 00:45:29.409
economists and sociologists and historians are not using these

913
00:45:29.419 --> 00:45:32.270
terms very much. Um uh A a and I

914
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.699
do think there's, there's also a recognition in the

915
00:45:34.709 --> 00:45:38.379
public, I think, um of their arbitrariness and that's

916
00:45:38.389 --> 00:45:41.969
why, you know, sometimes it seems like wasting effort,

917
00:45:41.979 --> 00:45:43.409
like, oh, I'm a millennial but I don't feel

918
00:45:43.419 --> 00:45:46.060
like a millennial. You could have just skipped both

919
00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:48.010
of those statements and got and moved on with

920
00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.709
your life. 10 seconds earlier. But, but it is

921
00:45:51.719 --> 00:45:53.330
a way of framing, it's a way of putting,

922
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.850
you know, putting yourself in historical context and there's

923
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:59.100
a, you know, the generation gap, I mean, um,

924
00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:04.189
interestingly, um, you know, these generations are getting shorter,

925
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.959
um, human generations are getting longer and because of

926
00:46:07.969 --> 00:46:10.840
low birth rates in some ways the generations are

927
00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:14.439
getting closer together, um, in, in that the parents

928
00:46:14.449 --> 00:46:18.739
have fewer Children, grandparents have fewer grandchildren. Um And

929
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:21.770
their lives are longer. Um, YOU know, a grandparent

930
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.919
may now have a 70 year relationship with two

931
00:46:24.929 --> 00:46:27.770
grandchildren. You know, that's a very, that's a very

932
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.250
meaningful, I'm not 70 years right there. Uh But

933
00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.139
more like a, a 50 year relationship with two

934
00:46:32.149 --> 00:46:34.489
grandchildren, you know, that's it, that could be developed

935
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.629
into a very meaningful adult um uh uh relationship

936
00:46:38.639 --> 00:46:40.399
over a long period of time and can actually

937
00:46:40.409 --> 00:46:44.189
draw generations closer together. Grandparents all have 25 grandchildren.

938
00:46:44.199 --> 00:46:45.790
They can't even remember all their names and they

939
00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.479
die when they're 60. Um Then, um it's not

940
00:46:49.489 --> 00:46:52.239
uh uh it's a different kind of intergenerational relationship.

941
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:55.290
So actually, we have great potential for um for

942
00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:59.959
vertical generational relationships, improving and deepening uh over historical

943
00:46:59.969 --> 00:47:02.699
time. Um And then like slicing them all up

944
00:47:02.709 --> 00:47:07.659
into um like in our family. Um We have

945
00:47:07.669 --> 00:47:10.590
no, um there's no baby boomers in my family.

946
00:47:10.739 --> 00:47:13.290
My parents were born before the baby boom and

947
00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.419
me and my sibling were born after the baby

948
00:47:15.429 --> 00:47:18.330
boom. There's no baby boomers in our, and that's

949
00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:21.080
not so unusual. The generations are getting further apart.

950
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:22.889
My parents were slightly older when they had their

951
00:47:22.899 --> 00:47:26.270
Children. Um, THEN, you know, than some other people,

952
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.810
like just the, the baby boom squeezed right into

953
00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:33.649
that moment for them. So, um, uh uh uh,

954
00:47:33.709 --> 00:47:37.790
the, uh, I mean, we may, we may just

955
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.840
find that there are other ways to express our

956
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:44.959
generational, um, affinities and affiliations besides these categories, hopefully.

957
00:47:45.199 --> 00:47:47.820
Mhm So let me just ask you one last

958
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:50.729
question. Then when it comes to your own work,

959
00:47:50.739 --> 00:47:54.899
we've already talked about throughout the interview, demographic trends.

960
00:47:54.909 --> 00:47:57.739
But you also do work on family structure, the

961
00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:01.159
division of labor, health disparities. Do you see or

962
00:48:01.169 --> 00:48:06.110
think that generation labels have affected or could affect

963
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.229
in any way, research on those topics that you

964
00:48:09.239 --> 00:48:10.159
are interested in?

965
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.560
Well, they mostly um the labels mostly occur as

966
00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:18.750
noise um in the sense that if you, so,

967
00:48:18.879 --> 00:48:21.060
you know, everything I do, I'm looking at like

968
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.899
marriage or divorce rates over time. Um And so

969
00:48:23.909 --> 00:48:25.820
the, the, you know, the year of birth is

970
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.820
a very important element in that um you know,

971
00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:32.610
people who are uh uh people who get married

972
00:48:32.929 --> 00:48:34.830
at a young age are much more likely to

973
00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.239
get divorced and people who get married in certain

974
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:39.139
periods are more likely to get divorced. So you

975
00:48:39.149 --> 00:48:41.580
have to weigh those two factors, the age and

976
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:45.209
the period um which together makes cohort. Um So

977
00:48:45.219 --> 00:48:47.250
we have to think about these things. If, if,

978
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:51.570
if people um collapse their data into categories without

979
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.000
reason. At the start of this, it becomes noise

980
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:57.179
because you have to immediately ask, is this category

981
00:48:57.189 --> 00:48:59.659
working, right? So like if I look at the,

982
00:48:59.669 --> 00:49:03.300
is it concealing very important variation? Am I, am

983
00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:06.580
I splitting Venus and Serena Williams? Um uh IN

984
00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:08.810
a way that um that undermines my ability to

985
00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.550
actually understand what was happening in the 19 eighties,

986
00:49:11.669 --> 00:49:15.179
you know, so there's, it, it, it um as

987
00:49:15.189 --> 00:49:16.929
soon as you start using the categories, you have

988
00:49:16.939 --> 00:49:18.780
to pull them apart and see if they make

989
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:20.760
sense and then maybe they do, maybe they don't,

990
00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.540
but it would just be random at that point.

991
00:49:22.939 --> 00:49:25.919
So, um it, it introduces noise and sort of

992
00:49:25.929 --> 00:49:30.300
aggravation without, without introducing any clarity. Um Now, like

993
00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:32.360
I said, if I use decades, that may have

994
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.129
the same effect, so I may start with decades

995
00:49:35.179 --> 00:49:37.060
and then say, well, wait a second, let's actually

996
00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:40.479
be careful here because um you know, 2009 was

997
00:49:40.489 --> 00:49:43.040
a very big year. Um And so maybe I

998
00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:45.000
wanna break these apart. So you may end up

999
00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:47.475
in a similar process this but you don't start

1000
00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:50.074
with a name and a label and an assumption

1001
00:49:50.084 --> 00:49:52.675
that it matters. You start with a recognition that

1002
00:49:52.685 --> 00:49:55.814
you used some arbitrary categories for convenience and then

1003
00:49:55.824 --> 00:49:58.544
maybe check to make sure that you're not obscuring

1004
00:49:58.554 --> 00:50:01.695
important variation when you do that. I imagine it's

1005
00:50:01.705 --> 00:50:05.054
similar. II, I won't say anything about biology but

1006
00:50:05.064 --> 00:50:07.155
the identification of species is a big issue in

1007
00:50:07.165 --> 00:50:09.794
biology. I'm, I'm aware and it's not always so

1008
00:50:09.804 --> 00:50:11.524
cut and dry and you definitely don't want to

1009
00:50:11.534 --> 00:50:14.395
um um you know, assume your categories before you

1010
00:50:14.405 --> 00:50:15.645
do the research. That's all

1011
00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:19.489
great. So, just before we go, would you like

1012
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.790
to tell people where they can find you and

1013
00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.350
your work on the internet?

1014
00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.570
Oh, sure. Um So, uh uh my website is

1015
00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:29.840
Philip N cohen.com. It's Philip with one L. Um

1016
00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:31.800
So um you can see everything there. I have

1017
00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:35.159
a blog called Family Inequality. Um And if you

1018
00:50:35.169 --> 00:50:37.989
