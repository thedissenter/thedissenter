00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:02.839
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:05.679
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lob. And

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.550
today I'm joined by Doctor Sheri Berman. She's a

4
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.710
Professor of Political Science at Barnard College at Columbia

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.239
University. And today we're talking about topics like the

6
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.094
history of the political, the left, social democracy, labor

7
00:00:20.104 --> 00:00:23.944
movements, uh the rise of and the maintenance of

8
00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:28.565
democracy, capitalism and also the recent rise of right

9
00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:33.185
wing populism, fascist movement. So Dr Berman, welcome to

10
00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:34.665
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:36.720
I'm I'm happy to be here.

12
00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:41.310
So starting with the left, then tell us a

13
00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:43.900
little bit about uh o of course, we have

14
00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.490
to be brief here because we don't have 10

15
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.830
hours to talk about the entire history of the

16
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.669
left. But uh tell us a little bit about

17
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.319
uh its origins historically and what at least originally

18
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.189
was its main ideology.

19
00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:04.690
So, um so thanks, that's a great question. And

20
00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.059
thanks for um starting us off by saying that

21
00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:09.500
answering it would probably take us 10 hours or,

22
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.660
or more um entire libraries obviously have been written

23
00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:14.930
on this topic. But, but if, if we were

24
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.309
to oversimplify which obviously one has to do in

25
00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:19.860
this kind of context. I mean, the the origins

26
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.059
of the left, the modern left have to do

27
00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.589
with um capitalism. I mean, obviously the terms left

28
00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:27.440
and right come from the French revolution. But when

29
00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:30.089
we think of the left today, what we're really

30
00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:34.537
thinking about are the political parties, the labor movements

31
00:01:34.546 --> 00:01:37.577
that arose in the second half of the 19th

32
00:01:37.586 --> 00:01:40.857
century. And really they rose to deal with the

33
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:45.817
consequences or the implications of capitalism. So the, the

34
00:01:45.827 --> 00:01:48.107
history of the left and the history of capitalism

35
00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:52.876
have always been intertwined. Um THE most important figure

36
00:01:52.887 --> 00:01:57.567
obviously in this um history is um Karl Marx.

37
00:01:57.577 --> 00:02:00.393
Um AS the what became the sort of main

38
00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:05.134
um thinker and the main ideology of the left

39
00:02:05.143 --> 00:02:08.532
in the, again, second half of the 19th century

40
00:02:08.752 --> 00:02:13.244
and the 20th century. And so beginning really, um

41
00:02:13.294 --> 00:02:16.804
you know, around this time, what you had were

42
00:02:16.813 --> 00:02:20.973
people movements who were really grappling with how to

43
00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:24.453
think about where capitalism was going and what to

44
00:02:24.464 --> 00:02:28.050
do about it primarily, but not exclusively through the

45
00:02:28.061 --> 00:02:32.871
lens of Marx. Marx and Engels writings and the

46
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.850
people who interpreted those writings. So what we have

47
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.570
um basically by the, by the turn of the

48
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.110
century, the end of the 19th and 20th century

49
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:48.100
is this ideology having become dominant within the um

50
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.690
international left. Um Europe primarily was the sort of

51
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:57.009
um main ground for um debate were people who

52
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.360
were beginning actually to question some of the tenets

53
00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:06.169
of Marxism. Um And so what you see then

54
00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.559
is um debates about what the future of capitalism

55
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.830
is gonna be and what should be done about

56
00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.949
it? And the international, what is that point? The

57
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.850
International Socialist movement begins to develop some very interesting

58
00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:23.570
cleavages and divides that we can actually still see

59
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.589
echoes of in the left today. And so what

60
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.570
were those cleavages? The first was about how to

61
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.039
think about capitalism's development. That is to say, was

62
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.110
it kind of doomed to failure because it was

63
00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:38.070
so horrible and was producing so many internal contradictions

64
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.089
and negative consequences is that it could not persist

65
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.039
through time and should not persist through time or

66
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.139
was it possible to kind of harness capitalism's upsides

67
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.259
while minimizing its downsides? So one really important cleavage

68
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.429
that begins to define the left from the late

69
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.449
19th century on is how to think about capitalism,

70
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:04.190
can it or should it be um salvaged, what

71
00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.789
can or should be done to deal with it?

72
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.460
And then the second really important cleavage um related

73
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.059
to but somewhat different is about um political power.

74
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.959
So originally the Marxist version of capitalism's development was

75
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.920
kind of inexorable. It was without um a significant

76
00:04:23.929 --> 00:04:28.100
emphasis on human agency. Capitalism's internal contradictions were going

77
00:04:28.109 --> 00:04:31.875
to lead to certain kinds of developments and political

78
00:04:31.885 --> 00:04:34.864
parties and social movements were really there to kind

79
00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:38.635
of educate the masses to, to some degree perhaps

80
00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:43.015
ameliorate consequences. But the ultimate driving force of history

81
00:04:43.024 --> 00:04:47.005
was economic development, the development of capitalism. And a

82
00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:51.045
lot of people found that very dispiriting and also

83
00:04:51.054 --> 00:04:55.195
very unhelpful. And so another split that comes up

84
00:04:55.204 --> 00:04:57.704
within the international socialist movement is how much emphasis

85
00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:01.299
to place on political power. And so we get

86
00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:03.670
a bunch of interesting cleavages based on these two

87
00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:07.130
things. We get Leninists for instance, who believe that

88
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.570
capitalism is terrible needs to be overthrown. But that

89
00:05:10.579 --> 00:05:12.640
it has to be done through political power because

90
00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:15.869
it's not gonna happen on its own. We get

91
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.799
other people who think capitalism is terrible and it

92
00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:22.170
might not be collapsing today, but it will collapse

93
00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:25.600
eventually. And it's really the job of um you

94
00:05:25.609 --> 00:05:28.390
know, socialists to kind of wait around for this

95
00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:30.989
to happen again and sort of, you know, ameliorate

96
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.070
perhaps some of its negative consequences in the interim.

97
00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:36.809
Those were the people who became sort of socialists,

98
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.839
democratic socialists, that kind of thing. You also had

99
00:05:40.989 --> 00:05:43.619
the people who would become social democrats who believed

100
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.320
something quite different about capitalism. They believed, as I

101
00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:50.329
said that it could be harnessed that its upsides

102
00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:54.450
could be maximized and its downsides could be minimized.

103
00:05:54.859 --> 00:05:58.250
But in order to do that socialists, people on

104
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.549
the left had to capture the democratic state. So

105
00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:04.619
they oddly enough agreed with Leninists that political power

106
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.450
was central to the left, but they disagree with

107
00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:12.100
Leninists in that they saw that political power as

108
00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:15.920
being um embedded in a democratic state that they

109
00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:21.089
could use the democratic state to control capitalism again,

110
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.679
to sort of get its good sides and minimize

111
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.260
its downsides. So you, again, by the early 20th

112
00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:30.670
century, basically, what we have are the three camps

113
00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:35.470
within the left that would determine it or, or

114
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.209
shape it or characterize it during the 20th century.

115
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.779
You got communists, Leninists, you got socialists. Um AND

116
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.459
you got social democrats and they all come from

117
00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:51.829
the same original movement. They're all founded in a

118
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.769
grappling with Marxism, but they come to very different

119
00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:00.089
conclusions. As I said, both about how to understand

120
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.420
capitalism and its development and what should be done

121
00:07:03.429 --> 00:07:05.850
about it. Um And we're continuing to grapple with

122
00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:09.820
these questions, same questions about capitalism and democracy today,

123
00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:13.709
by the way, let me ask you uh particularly

124
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.369
during the 20th century because you mentioned Marx there

125
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.209
and you focused a lot on the ending of

126
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.899
the 19th century, beginning of the 20th century. But

127
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.209
uh uh I mean, do we know what extent

128
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.309
uh the communist revolution in Russia and then the

129
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.279
Soviet Union uh influenced how uh the left in

130
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.690
general looks at and thinks about uh Mars and

131
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.609
particularly communism. Uh SINCE uh I mean, we know

132
00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:51.970
how it worked out and was applied in Russia

133
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.350
and the Soviet Union. I, I mean, were there

134
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.002
uh among leftists uh reactions to that because I

135
00:07:59.013 --> 00:08:02.292
mean, in a sense after, uh, the rise of

136
00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:04.833
the Soviet Union and then later it's fall, uh,

137
00:08:04.842 --> 00:08:08.713
by then people would at least point or have,

138
00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:11.532
uh, something to point at when it comes to

139
00:08:11.743 --> 00:08:17.013
rep, uh, making claims about what would happen if

140
00:08:17.023 --> 00:08:21.553
communism or perhaps socialism, I mean, beca because sometimes

141
00:08:21.562 --> 00:08:27.816
even distinguishing communism from socialism is a bit tricky

142
00:08:27.825 --> 00:08:32.135
in a way also because even within Marxist uh,

143
00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:35.434
uh ideology, let's say. And in the, even in

144
00:08:35.445 --> 00:08:38.695
the words of Marx itself, he himself, I mean,

145
00:08:38.705 --> 00:08:42.075
there was a uh a, an initial phase that

146
00:08:42.085 --> 00:08:45.635
would be socialism and then communism would come later

147
00:08:45.645 --> 00:08:48.809
on. Uh So I, I mean, how did the

148
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.289
left react to all of what happened in the

149
00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:57.479
Soviet Union with, uh let's say, applied communism if

150
00:08:57.489 --> 00:08:59.890
we could, if we could call it that.

151
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.780
So that's the great question. And also a very

152
00:09:02.789 --> 00:09:05.539
big one. I mean, at this point, um you

153
00:09:05.549 --> 00:09:07.229
know, at the, in the sort of first quarter

154
00:09:07.239 --> 00:09:10.169
of the 21st century, it's really almost impossible to

155
00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:16.450
separate interpretations of Marxism from the real existing communism

156
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.830
that um we had in the Soviet Union or

157
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.900
China. Now, you know, there is a, there is

158
00:09:20.909 --> 00:09:24.440
a very long and um heated debate that went

159
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.955
on among leftist scholars, whether or not real existing

160
00:09:27.965 --> 00:09:32.604
communism reflected what Marx either wanted or predicted. I

161
00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:35.335
mean, he was a thinker, he was an intellectual,

162
00:09:35.344 --> 00:09:38.075
he was not a leader of a political movement.

163
00:09:38.085 --> 00:09:40.385
He didn't he wasn't around to see how the

164
00:09:40.395 --> 00:09:43.505
Soviet Union or China or other communist countries developed.

165
00:09:43.604 --> 00:09:45.265
So, you know, we don't know what he would

166
00:09:45.275 --> 00:09:47.434
have thought and you know, what he would have

167
00:09:47.494 --> 00:09:52.349
preferred. But it's very hard today to separate, you

168
00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:54.650
know, marks from those things, which is in some

169
00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:57.669
ways unfair. But it's just, you know, it's kind

170
00:09:57.679 --> 00:10:01.119
of the reality of the way history had, um,

171
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.539
had developed. And there's also, of course, it's, it's

172
00:10:03.549 --> 00:10:06.119
also very important to note that once the Soviet

173
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.400
Union was formed, the access that people had to.

174
00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:12.659
Marx's writings was also very much shaped by that

175
00:10:12.669 --> 00:10:15.820
because of course, the communists were very eager to

176
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.164
put out, you know, um Marxist writings, but they

177
00:10:19.174 --> 00:10:22.044
emphasize some of his writings more than others, you

178
00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:24.234
know, whatever the later Marx, the more deterministic Mars

179
00:10:24.244 --> 00:10:26.784
as opposed to the more humanistic Mars. But that,

180
00:10:26.794 --> 00:10:29.255
but, you know, those are debates perhaps that scholars,

181
00:10:29.424 --> 00:10:31.494
you know, have had and will continue to have.

182
00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:34.244
I think, you know, what, what we, what we

183
00:10:34.255 --> 00:10:37.724
know now, right is that, you know, the Soviet

184
00:10:37.734 --> 00:10:42.054
Union and Communist China, um you know, by a

185
00:10:42.359 --> 00:10:49.190
dein democracy alongside eliminating capitalism, created pathologies that may,

186
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.030
that were certainly, I would say worse than the

187
00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:56.869
original pathologies created by capitalism itself. Um And so,

188
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.229
you know, that has kind of to a large

189
00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:05.989
degree discredited, that particular strand of leftist thinking. Um

190
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.275
I think there are very few people these days

191
00:11:08.284 --> 00:11:10.715
who want to go back to communism as it

192
00:11:10.724 --> 00:11:13.195
existed. Although there are obviously very many people who

193
00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:18.395
still believe capitalism is um evil. It cannot be

194
00:11:18.405 --> 00:11:22.255
modified in any sim in any significant way and

195
00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:24.825
has to be gotten rid of. But fortunately, there

196
00:11:24.835 --> 00:11:27.544
are not that many people around advocating the kind

197
00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:31.705
of violent revolutionary overthrows that um you know, someone

198
00:11:31.715 --> 00:11:35.799
like Lenin or Mao engaged in when the Soviet

199
00:11:35.809 --> 00:11:38.299
Union was formed after the Russian revolution. Of course,

200
00:11:38.309 --> 00:11:42.830
it, it transformed the international left most practically because

201
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:48.289
communist parties formed in almost all countries during that

202
00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:52.400
interwar period. And these communist parties were um not

203
00:11:52.409 --> 00:11:55.469
only obviously opposed to the um to capitalism, but

204
00:11:55.479 --> 00:11:58.789
they were also opposed to democracy. And so in

205
00:11:58.799 --> 00:12:01.650
Europe, for instance, communist parties during the interwar years,

206
00:12:01.919 --> 00:12:07.419
very much work to undermine democracy, often engaging in

207
00:12:07.429 --> 00:12:11.849
sort of violent uprisings and were therefore complicit in,

208
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:16.020
you know, the downfall of democracy in many European

209
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.349
countries. Um YOU know, so the communism very much

210
00:12:19.359 --> 00:12:22.659
a sort of, you know, an incredibly important part

211
00:12:22.669 --> 00:12:26.590
of the left story during the 20th century and

212
00:12:26.599 --> 00:12:29.469
grappling with its legacy after the collapse of the

213
00:12:29.479 --> 00:12:32.640
Soviet Union. And um you know, even earlier the

214
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.250
revelation of the crimes that were committed in the

215
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.130
Soviet Union and China really shaped um the way

216
00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.309
the left evolved and communist parties in Europe, for

217
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.830
instance, that um you know, existed during the post

218
00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:50.059
war period, um having to deal with those, um,

219
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:54.020
crimes of the Soviet Union over the course of

220
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.989
the post war period did, for the most part

221
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.270
moderate. That's why we got sort of a euro

222
00:12:59.289 --> 00:13:03.429
communist movement in western Europe and these parties, you

223
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.940
know, sort of drew away from the violent anti

224
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:11.919
democratic imperialist nature of the Soviet Union and tried

225
00:13:11.929 --> 00:13:15.580
to find some kind of way to, um, stay

226
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:20.109
true to their opposition to capitalism. But jettison again,

227
00:13:20.119 --> 00:13:23.679
the sort of anti democratic, violent and imperialist parts

228
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:27.750
of the, um, of the, of, of what real

229
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.200
existing communism looked like, um, that ended up being

230
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.469
a sort of dead end. Um, THOSE that movement

231
00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:37.739
ended up, you know, sort of going nowhere. But,

232
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.950
um, but, you know, it has been to some

233
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.534
degree, um, looked back towards by people today on

234
00:13:43.544 --> 00:13:46.664
the left who really feel that communism. I'm sorry

235
00:13:46.674 --> 00:13:50.034
that capitalism cannot and should not be allowed to

236
00:13:50.044 --> 00:13:53.344
persist. But they're not interested again in the, the

237
00:13:53.354 --> 00:13:57.895
sort of violent anti democratic imperialist aspects of what

238
00:13:57.905 --> 00:13:59.924
real existing communism turned into.

239
00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:05.390
So, among the three strands of leftism that we,

240
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.719
you identified that came out of the 19th century,

241
00:14:08.729 --> 00:14:14.969
namely socialism, Marxist communism and social democracy. Would you

242
00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:20.630
say that at least nowadays, the main one among

243
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.030
leftists would be social democracy or not?

244
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.440
Well, so I would say it, it, you know,

245
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.820
it depends a little bit on the part of

246
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.380
the world you're looking at. If we, if we

247
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.719
stick to Europe, for example, um social democracy ended

248
00:14:34.729 --> 00:14:37.739
up being the sort of dominant strand on the

249
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.679
left during the post war period. That is to

250
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.710
say a kind of social democratic worldview ended up

251
00:14:43.719 --> 00:14:49.500
being the dominant one within most European left parties

252
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.140
during the post war period. That is to say

253
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.340
an acceptance of capitalism combined with a recognition of

254
00:14:55.349 --> 00:14:59.280
its dangers and downsides and this commitment to democracy,

255
00:14:59.289 --> 00:15:01.190
right? And a belief that these things could go

256
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.669
together, right? That by gaining power in the democratic

257
00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:08.780
state, you could really mitigate all of these terrible

258
00:15:08.789 --> 00:15:13.890
consequences of capitalism. Now, of course, during the late

259
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.289
20th century, this view or this vision or this

260
00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:21.520
perspective began to kind of um weaken and almost

261
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.140
disappear. Um As many of these parties kind of

262
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.010
moved so far to the center on economics, kind

263
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.840
of adopting, you know, what came to be known

264
00:15:30.849 --> 00:15:35.830
as whatever third way is in Europe, progressive neoliberalism

265
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.619
in the United States. And that kind of vision

266
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.929
of um look, it is really important for the

267
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:48.539
left to remain cognizant of capitalism's downsides even as

268
00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:51.460
they accept that they are no longer committed to

269
00:15:51.469 --> 00:15:54.460
destroying it, right? And they, they moved so far

270
00:15:54.469 --> 00:16:00.054
towards accepting a view of capitalism is relatively beneficent

271
00:16:00.164 --> 00:16:03.405
and efficient. The idea that many of its downsides,

272
00:16:03.414 --> 00:16:05.914
it kind of whatever disappeared or were no longer

273
00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:10.054
relevant that they kind of lost that part of

274
00:16:10.065 --> 00:16:12.844
what social democracy in any case meant, right. Which

275
00:16:12.854 --> 00:16:16.155
was that it not only accepted capitalism, but it

276
00:16:16.164 --> 00:16:19.005
also accepted how important it was to keep it

277
00:16:19.015 --> 00:16:22.960
sort of constrained. Um And so that, that social

278
00:16:22.969 --> 00:16:28.820
democratic vision weirdly enough began to dissipate after the

279
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.849
collapse of the Soviet Union took down with it,

280
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:37.359
you know, adherence to old fashioned communism. So what

281
00:16:37.369 --> 00:16:41.195
the left stands for now is very unclear because

282
00:16:41.205 --> 00:16:45.174
the collapse of communism and the incredible weakening or

283
00:16:45.184 --> 00:16:48.465
watering down of social democracy has now left the

284
00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:52.434
left, so to speak without a very clear profile,

285
00:16:52.455 --> 00:16:56.315
a defining stance towards capitalism which has always been

286
00:16:57.299 --> 00:16:59.719
to mix metaphor, to get and to get back

287
00:16:59.729 --> 00:17:01.630
to what we talked about. Initially, it's Raisin detra,

288
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.190
right? I mean, this is what the left is

289
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.880
about. The left is about grappling with capitalism. But

290
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.760
that aspect of its essence really, as I said,

291
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.239
became watered down or dissipated by the end of

292
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.199
the 20th century.

293
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.750
So, and uh as you described earlier in the

294
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:25.229
19th century, leftism is very much tied to labor

295
00:17:25.239 --> 00:17:30.189
movements, workers rights, stuff like that. So, but nowadays,

296
00:17:30.199 --> 00:17:36.010
um how does social democracy relate to labor, labor

297
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:40.194
movements and things like syndicalism? Because particularly since mentioned

298
00:17:40.204 --> 00:17:44.484
there with the rise of perhaps progressive neoliberalism in

299
00:17:44.494 --> 00:17:47.935
the US and the third way in the UK

300
00:17:47.944 --> 00:17:51.145
and a little bit across Europe. Um I mean,

301
00:17:51.155 --> 00:17:55.344
it seems that uh la uh labor movements, labor

302
00:17:55.354 --> 00:17:59.265
rights, syndicalism and so on are no longer at,

303
00:17:59.275 --> 00:18:03.219
at least at the forefront of uh at least

304
00:18:03.229 --> 00:18:04.979
the social democracy,

305
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:05.699
right?

306
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.459
Sure.

307
00:18:06.469 --> 00:18:08.189
So, I mean, at the same time as you

308
00:18:08.199 --> 00:18:12.430
were seeing the growth of left political parties, late

309
00:18:12.439 --> 00:18:15.910
19th century, 20th century, you were seeing the growth

310
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:20.260
of labor movements overall, most, most importantly, represented by

311
00:18:20.469 --> 00:18:23.520
unions as well, right? So unions and left parties

312
00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.489
grew up together, often the left parties grew out

313
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.204
of unions and, and they interact with and cooperated

314
00:18:30.214 --> 00:18:32.594
with each other sort of throughout this time. And,

315
00:18:32.604 --> 00:18:35.675
and during the last decades, at the same time,

316
00:18:35.685 --> 00:18:39.125
as parties of the left have declined, so have

317
00:18:39.135 --> 00:18:43.234
labor unions and the other, you know, organizations, civil

318
00:18:43.244 --> 00:18:46.564
society, organizations that would have encompassed the labor movement

319
00:18:46.574 --> 00:18:49.535
and those things obviously go together. I mean, the

320
00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:52.005
weakening of the left and the weakening of labor

321
00:18:52.015 --> 00:18:55.790
movements are part and parcel of the same trend

322
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.310
and they feed into each other. Right. Left parties

323
00:18:58.319 --> 00:19:02.839
have always depended for instance, on unions for mobilization

324
00:19:02.849 --> 00:19:06.729
for the creation of working class identities in the

325
00:19:06.739 --> 00:19:10.319
past, also often for their very leaders. And so,

326
00:19:10.329 --> 00:19:13.089
you know, these kinds of things are part of

327
00:19:13.099 --> 00:19:16.239
a larger trend. They are also related to some

328
00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:21.229
obviously very important social and demographic changes. The number

329
00:19:21.239 --> 00:19:26.790
of traditional working class people has declined uh declined

330
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.469
during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Capitalism

331
00:19:29.479 --> 00:19:31.910
changed, right? We have fewer, you know, sort of

332
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.280
large factories and um industry is a less important

333
00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.329
part of western economies. Than it would have been.

334
00:19:39.474 --> 00:19:42.104
And what we've seen in its place is the

335
00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:45.685
rise of service sector industries, which often do not

336
00:19:45.694 --> 00:19:50.375
have better working conditions or wages than industrial workplaces

337
00:19:50.385 --> 00:19:54.415
had, but differ very much in um you know,

338
00:19:54.425 --> 00:19:57.265
the kinds of experiences that people who work within

339
00:19:57.275 --> 00:20:02.880
them have. And so traditional union organizing um was

340
00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.359
designed again in for an industrial workplace, not for

341
00:20:06.369 --> 00:20:10.000
people who are working in retail stores, fast food

342
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.339
outlets who are low level workers in offices. And

343
00:20:13.349 --> 00:20:16.900
so, you know, as the economy changed, um labor

344
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.479
movements did not change. And so they began also

345
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.520
to kind of lose their hold over populations. And

346
00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.500
so union density levels are just a fraction in

347
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.459
many European countries of what they were during the

348
00:20:29.469 --> 00:20:31.780
post war decades. And all of these things have

349
00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.109
really fed into each other to diminish the power

350
00:20:35.119 --> 00:20:39.280
of the left diminish the power of um of

351
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.560
workers broadly defined in the economy and to really

352
00:20:43.569 --> 00:20:48.390
change the dynamics of capitalism because the countervailing force

353
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.719
of the unions and left parties is just not

354
00:20:50.729 --> 00:20:52.420
as strong as it was during the post war

355
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.989
decades.

356
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.880
And particularly with um progressive neoliberalism. I mean, I

357
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:03.540
find it very interesting how there's a progressive uh

358
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:08.859
strand of neoliberalism because looking back historically, in terms

359
00:21:08.869 --> 00:21:13.150
of what the left uh it stood for. Uh

360
00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.270
I mean, with neoliberalism, we associate with the regulation

361
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.540
of the market with uh weakening of workers' rights,

362
00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.989
with pre pre organization of the w of working

363
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.520
conditions and all of that. So, I, I mean,

364
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:34.150
how, how is it that we nowadays can, can

365
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:40.099
have among leftists, something that apparently runs, runs counter

366
00:21:40.109 --> 00:21:44.760
to what the left historically uh stood for.

367
00:21:45.819 --> 00:21:48.079
So, I mean, that is a really great question.

368
00:21:48.089 --> 00:21:50.449
I mean, in, you know, from the perspective of

369
00:21:50.459 --> 00:21:54.000
2024 it can be a little hard to understand

370
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.239
why the left moved so far away from its

371
00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.099
traditional wariness of capitalism. And I say that just

372
00:22:00.109 --> 00:22:03.229
because we've had, we've had a financial crisis, we've

373
00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:07.050
now had growing inequality. We can see the fallout

374
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.579
from inequality from in insecurity from all of these

375
00:22:10.589 --> 00:22:12.974
things, right? And so with the benefit of hindsight,

376
00:22:12.984 --> 00:22:15.895
it looks like that move was just an incredibly

377
00:22:15.905 --> 00:22:19.665
um wrong headed one. I think if we go

378
00:22:19.675 --> 00:22:22.275
back to the 19 nineties, though, we can sort

379
00:22:22.285 --> 00:22:27.635
of understand not excuse maybe but understand why that

380
00:22:27.645 --> 00:22:29.935
move seemed to make sense to people at the

381
00:22:29.944 --> 00:22:32.814
time, I would say two things were really crucial.

382
00:22:32.824 --> 00:22:36.204
One was of course, that Western economies did experience

383
00:22:36.569 --> 00:22:39.750
some real problems in the seventies and eighties. Um

384
00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:44.410
YOU know, inflation slowed growth, rising unemployment. And so

385
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.089
traditional, the traditional kind of economic measures that the

386
00:22:48.099 --> 00:22:51.339
left had relied on just were not as effective

387
00:22:51.349 --> 00:22:52.989
as they had been during the post war decades.

388
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.459
So there's absolutely that and that in turn fed

389
00:22:56.469 --> 00:22:59.849
the rise of kind of neo liberal ideas, neo

390
00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:02.464
liberal movements, neo liberal thinkers, because they could look

391
00:23:02.474 --> 00:23:05.084
to these problems and say, look, we have ideas

392
00:23:05.094 --> 00:23:07.824
about how to solve these and these old left

393
00:23:07.834 --> 00:23:11.564
ideas are no longer viable. And then the collapse

394
00:23:11.574 --> 00:23:14.285
of the Soviet Union really kind of created this

395
00:23:14.295 --> 00:23:19.864
triumphalism about liberal democratic capitalism. This belief, not only

396
00:23:19.875 --> 00:23:23.334
that it had obviously succeeded where its main competitor

397
00:23:23.344 --> 00:23:27.255
had failed, but that, that success reflected its inherent

398
00:23:27.319 --> 00:23:31.859
stability and its inherent ability to kind of overcome

399
00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:35.979
crises. And so, you know, this combination of problems

400
00:23:35.989 --> 00:23:40.160
with post war policies and ideas and the sort

401
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.689
of triumphalism that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet

402
00:23:43.699 --> 00:23:46.979
Union. I think really convinced many leaders on the

403
00:23:46.989 --> 00:23:50.239
left that they could abandon some of their wariness

404
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:54.035
of capitalism, except some of these neo liberal ideas

405
00:23:54.045 --> 00:23:58.614
about, you know, um capitalism's effectiveness, its ability to

406
00:23:58.625 --> 00:24:01.094
kind of solve its own problems and create sort

407
00:24:01.104 --> 00:24:05.074
of equilibria and stability, the need for less state

408
00:24:05.084 --> 00:24:09.275
intervention, less state regulation. And so again, you know,

409
00:24:09.285 --> 00:24:12.905
the nineties were a very different time than the

410
00:24:12.915 --> 00:24:15.354
20 twenties are. But as we can see, in

411
00:24:15.364 --> 00:24:19.689
retrospect, these ideas turned out to be very wrong

412
00:24:19.699 --> 00:24:23.579
headed, wrong headed because they've created huge economic problems

413
00:24:23.589 --> 00:24:25.719
for sure. I mean, we can draw a line

414
00:24:25.729 --> 00:24:28.609
from the neoliberalism of the 19 nineties, right through

415
00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:34.219
the financial crisis, growing inequality, growing insecurity, diver divergences

416
00:24:34.229 --> 00:24:39.084
within economies, growing divergences within economies between rural urban

417
00:24:39.094 --> 00:24:41.724
areas. All of these economic problems and then of

418
00:24:41.734 --> 00:24:44.925
course, a whole variety of political problems as well

419
00:24:44.935 --> 00:24:49.234
because those economic problems alongside a bunch of other

420
00:24:49.244 --> 00:24:53.724
things really um lie at the root of um

421
00:24:53.734 --> 00:24:57.844
growing dissatisfaction with democracy and the increasing success of

422
00:24:57.854 --> 00:24:58.525
populism.

423
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.140
So let's talk about democracy then. Um HOW do

424
00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.939
you look at the current state of democracy? And

425
00:25:05.949 --> 00:25:09.540
perhaps here we can perhaps talk about two different

426
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.739
uh I mean, about democracy in different parts of

427
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.619
the world, like old democracies, like the ones in

428
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:21.180
the US and Western Europe, particularly and new democracies,

429
00:25:21.189 --> 00:25:25.160
particularly the ones that arose during the third wave

430
00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:28.680
in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. So tell us a

431
00:25:28.689 --> 00:25:29.760
little bit about that.

432
00:25:30.839 --> 00:25:33.670
So the collapse of the Soviet Union brought a

433
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.349
whole bunch of changes. We talked about one it

434
00:25:36.359 --> 00:25:40.209
facilitated or propelled the rise of neoliberalism, but the

435
00:25:40.219 --> 00:25:42.089
other change that it brought perhaps the most obvious

436
00:25:42.099 --> 00:25:45.180
changes, obviously, all of these countries that had been

437
00:25:45.189 --> 00:25:49.130
part of the Soviet Empire were granted independence and

438
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.656
became at least initially democracy, Eastern Europe, for example,

439
00:25:53.666 --> 00:25:55.836
parts of Central Asia, all of these, all of

440
00:25:55.845 --> 00:25:58.355
these places. So we got a huge wave of

441
00:25:58.365 --> 00:26:01.345
democratization at the end of the 20th century. Um

442
00:26:01.365 --> 00:26:04.595
POLITICAL scientists call it the third wave of democratization

443
00:26:04.605 --> 00:26:07.895
um to sort of um give it some historical

444
00:26:07.906 --> 00:26:12.556
reference to earlier times when you had um large

445
00:26:12.566 --> 00:26:14.962
numbers of countries making transitions to democracy at the

446
00:26:14.972 --> 00:26:17.472
same time. So we have a huge number of

447
00:26:17.482 --> 00:26:20.001
countries that make transitions to democracy at the end

448
00:26:20.011 --> 00:26:23.891
of the 20th century, um in Europe and elsewhere

449
00:26:24.112 --> 00:26:26.791
and, um, you know, some of these countries do

450
00:26:26.802 --> 00:26:29.092
well and others do less. Well, I mean, one

451
00:26:29.102 --> 00:26:32.592
of the things we know from previous waves is

452
00:26:32.602 --> 00:26:36.530
that many new democracies don't succeed. That's one of

453
00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.660
the reasons we call them waves. Not only to

454
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.300
kind of get you to think about a lot

455
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.680
of things happening at the same time, but because

456
00:26:42.689 --> 00:26:45.900
all waves have under toes, right? And so, you

457
00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.420
know, we expect that a lot of new democracies

458
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:52.719
will not succeed because they don't have the whatever

459
00:26:52.729 --> 00:26:55.560
you want to call them conditions or prerequisites for

460
00:26:55.569 --> 00:26:59.189
democratic success and in particular countries that have not

461
00:26:59.239 --> 00:27:03.454
had experience with democracy in the past, um that

462
00:27:03.464 --> 00:27:06.834
don't have legacies that they can build on, those

463
00:27:06.844 --> 00:27:09.814
tend to be particularly vulnerable. So even in places

464
00:27:09.824 --> 00:27:12.114
like Portugal and Spain, which made transitions during the

465
00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:14.175
third wave, although not obviously as a result of

466
00:27:14.185 --> 00:27:17.354
the collapse of the Soviet Union, these cases were

467
00:27:17.364 --> 00:27:21.555
more successful. There's lots of reasons for that, but

468
00:27:21.564 --> 00:27:24.895
one is that they had some experience with democracy

469
00:27:24.905 --> 00:27:26.125
in the past. And so that not only meant

470
00:27:26.135 --> 00:27:29.834
they could learn lessons from the mistakes, but there

471
00:27:29.844 --> 00:27:35.729
was some history of political parties, a free press,

472
00:27:35.859 --> 00:27:39.140
uh independent civil society that they could look back

473
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.660
and build upon. This was not true for the

474
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:45.260
countries of Eastern Europe, they had no real experience

475
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.869
with democracy and frankly, very little experience being independent

476
00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.760
countries at all. They formed after the collapse of

477
00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.000
empires at the end of the first World War,

478
00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:57.270
and then they were very quickly absorbed under Nazi

479
00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.064
rule and then into the Soviet Empire. So these

480
00:28:00.074 --> 00:28:03.064
countries make transitions to democracy at the end of

481
00:28:03.074 --> 00:28:07.444
the 20th century without previous democratic experience. And also

482
00:28:07.454 --> 00:28:12.795
having to grapple with the challenges of independent existence,

483
00:28:12.805 --> 00:28:16.555
right, national sovereignty, um who's a member of the

484
00:28:16.564 --> 00:28:19.204
nation, all those kinds of things. So you know

485
00:28:19.214 --> 00:28:21.564
that a lot of these countries in Eastern Europe,

486
00:28:21.574 --> 00:28:24.724
like many new democracies turn out to have some

487
00:28:24.734 --> 00:28:29.810
real problems. Should not surprise us. It should sadden

488
00:28:29.819 --> 00:28:32.839
us, but it should not really surprise us. I

489
00:28:32.849 --> 00:28:37.160
think what um is most worrying to scholars who

490
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:41.560
study democracy today is not the fact that many

491
00:28:41.569 --> 00:28:44.329
new democracies have proven weak and vulnerable again that,

492
00:28:44.339 --> 00:28:47.369
that saddens us but but from a comparative and

493
00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.869
historical perspective does not surprise us. What is somewhat

494
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.290
surprising is that many long established democracies, like the

495
00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.760
one that exists in the United States. And like

496
00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:02.979
those in Western Europe experienced some real problems, particularly

497
00:29:03.099 --> 00:29:05.750
in the United States, which um almost every scholar

498
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.369
who studies democracies thinks is in much worse shape

499
00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.550
than Western Europe as far as democracy is concerned.

500
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.979
And that is somewhat new democracy was considered secure

501
00:29:15.989 --> 00:29:19.189
in the United States, not complete. Obviously, there were

502
00:29:19.199 --> 00:29:21.819
always of problems with our democracy but, but not,

503
00:29:21.839 --> 00:29:26.349
not vulnerable to backsliding um or um you know,

504
00:29:26.359 --> 00:29:29.729
significant democratic erosion. And in fact, it is proven

505
00:29:29.969 --> 00:29:33.270
to be um vulnerable to these things. And this

506
00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.869
is somewhat surprising and therefore worrying and puzzling to

507
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.670
scholars of democracy.

508
00:29:40.859 --> 00:29:43.520
So, you know, something that I find a bit

509
00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:49.839
confusing, particularly here in Europe is why, particularly after

510
00:29:49.849 --> 00:29:55.000
the financial crisis of 2008, there's been uh a

511
00:29:55.010 --> 00:30:01.000
rise uh of right wing populism, but we haven't

512
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.719
seen the same on the other end. I mean,

513
00:30:04.729 --> 00:30:06.800
o on the other side on the left, I

514
00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:11.229
mean, do we have any idea why? That's the

515
00:30:11.239 --> 00:30:11.739
case?

516
00:30:12.719 --> 00:30:14.910
So that's, that's a, that is a puzzle and

517
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.569
one that uh you know, other social scientists have

518
00:30:17.579 --> 00:30:22.099
tried to explain, given the um the incredible um

519
00:30:22.109 --> 00:30:26.849
suffering caused by the financial crisis, one might have

520
00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:30.790
predicted that that suffering so to speak would benefit

521
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.594
the left because obviously the cause of it was

522
00:30:33.604 --> 00:30:39.665
neoliberalism unconstrained capitalism, yada, yada. And in fact, what

523
00:30:39.675 --> 00:30:41.635
we've seen is just the opposite that it's not

524
00:30:41.645 --> 00:30:44.954
in the left that has benefited but the populist

525
00:30:44.964 --> 00:30:48.364
even far, right. Um Now, one of the reasons

526
00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:51.729
for this one is probably um the reason that

527
00:30:51.739 --> 00:30:54.280
we talked about before, which is that the left

528
00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:59.859
had become so disassociated with a wariness of capitalism,

529
00:30:59.959 --> 00:31:03.979
a critique of capitalism and frankly, um in both

530
00:31:03.989 --> 00:31:06.959
Europe and the United States implicated in many of

531
00:31:06.969 --> 00:31:09.680
the neo liberal reforms that were seen as having

532
00:31:09.689 --> 00:31:13.209
led directly to that financial crisis, that people did

533
00:31:13.219 --> 00:31:16.079
not see the left as a solution to the

534
00:31:16.089 --> 00:31:18.680
problems that were revealed by the financial crisis, but

535
00:31:18.689 --> 00:31:21.312
very much implicated in causing it. And I think

536
00:31:21.322 --> 00:31:23.253
there is a lot of truth to that. There's

537
00:31:23.262 --> 00:31:26.133
simply no doubt that left wing parties as we

538
00:31:26.142 --> 00:31:31.223
talked about had advocated and in many cases, implemented

539
00:31:31.292 --> 00:31:34.442
many of the changes and reforms that um helped

540
00:31:34.453 --> 00:31:36.152
to cause the financial crisis. And so it was

541
00:31:36.162 --> 00:31:40.192
very hard for them to legitimately claim to voters

542
00:31:40.203 --> 00:31:42.723
that they were the best solution to a problem

543
00:31:42.892 --> 00:31:46.723
that they themselves had help cause, not, not exclusively,

544
00:31:46.733 --> 00:31:49.005
of course, but had helped cause. And so we

545
00:31:49.015 --> 00:31:51.975
can see perhaps in some way, the long term

546
00:31:51.985 --> 00:31:55.576
consequences of the dilution or the watering down of

547
00:31:55.586 --> 00:31:59.786
the left's traditional um economic profile, that is to

548
00:31:59.796 --> 00:32:05.186
say, a wariness of capitalism, uh prioritization of constraining

549
00:32:05.196 --> 00:32:08.345
its negative consequences. And then the flip side of

550
00:32:08.355 --> 00:32:10.645
that is that right wing populist parties proved to

551
00:32:10.656 --> 00:32:15.395
be extremely effective in turning a lot of the

552
00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.939
suffering and grievances that came out of not just

553
00:32:20.949 --> 00:32:23.959
the financial crisis, but the negative consequences of neo

554
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.859
liberal capitalism over time. Again, that we talked about

555
00:32:26.869 --> 00:32:32.920
growing inequality, insecurity, deepening rural urban divides in shifting

556
00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:36.400
the blame for that to a combination of out

557
00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:40.359
of touch, elites, you know, highly educated people like

558
00:32:40.369 --> 00:32:43.920
ourselves who had been running the show and um

559
00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:48.400
you know, immigrants and um minorities who were taking

560
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:53.810
a disproportionate share of the resources and um not

561
00:32:53.819 --> 00:32:57.020
playing by the rules of the game and therefore

562
00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.619
also partially to blame for, um, you know, the

563
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:06.420
suffering and the um insecurity that other citizens were

564
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:10.709
increasingly subject to, um, you know, from, from the

565
00:33:10.719 --> 00:33:13.680
early 21st century and particularly from the financial crisis

566
00:33:13.689 --> 00:33:14.140
on.

567
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:19.750
Mhm. Yeah. Earlier, I've asked you actually about reactions

568
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.729
to communism in the Soviet Union, particularly because when

569
00:33:23.739 --> 00:33:27.510
it comes to criticisms of capitalism, it seems that

570
00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.209
nowadays, I mean, even here in Portugal, we still

571
00:33:30.219 --> 00:33:33.339
have the Communist Party and we have uh another

572
00:33:33.589 --> 00:33:38.140
uh left wing party that is very close to

573
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:42.010
the Communist when the Western in English would probably

574
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.569
be left the leftist block uh where even in

575
00:33:45.579 --> 00:33:50.489
its origins, uh it had even Maoists and stalinists

576
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.489
there. So you see how far uh they would

577
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:57.119
go at least originally now, not so much. But

578
00:33:57.229 --> 00:34:01.130
uh e even when here people try to make

579
00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:07.410
even the tiniest positive comments on uh the former

580
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:11.620
Soviet Union or refer to Mars and people like

581
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:15.228
that. I, I mean, uh it, it gets a

582
00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:19.850
really bad rap nowadays be because people associate it

583
00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:24.550
immediately with dictatorship and the Gulags and all of

584
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.489
that. So.

585
00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:28.989
Right. Right. The other, the other thing that's important

586
00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:31.458
to note to, to sort of get back to

587
00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.840
the, a little bit to that previous question is

588
00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:37.379
that you know, those right wing populists um were

589
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:40.120
also in addition to being very skilled at kind

590
00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:44.989
of turning resentment and frustration towards um elites and,

591
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.370
and immigrants also um taking advantage of the the

592
00:34:49.379 --> 00:34:52.233
left's kind of watering down or dilution of its

593
00:34:52.243 --> 00:34:56.333
economic profile during the um early 21st century and

594
00:34:56.342 --> 00:34:59.134
particularly around the time of the financial crisis, really

595
00:34:59.144 --> 00:35:02.243
shifted their own economic profile. So, you know, when

596
00:35:02.253 --> 00:35:05.033
the first wave of these parties, right wing populist

597
00:35:05.043 --> 00:35:07.664
parties that is to say emerged in the late

598
00:35:07.674 --> 00:35:11.073
20th century, they tended to have kind of thatcherite

599
00:35:11.083 --> 00:35:16.357
reaganite, neo liberal economic profile, small state um cuts

600
00:35:16.367 --> 00:35:19.857
to the welfare state, lower taxes, all these kinds

601
00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:23.218
of things. But you know, as the left shifted

602
00:35:23.228 --> 00:35:26.968
to the center and as many of um you

603
00:35:26.978 --> 00:35:31.238
know, many low income, low educated voters, people who

604
00:35:31.248 --> 00:35:35.127
were suffering a lot from again, globalization changes in

605
00:35:35.137 --> 00:35:39.458
capitalism, uh changes in trade as those people began

606
00:35:39.468 --> 00:35:42.072
to kind of shift away from left wing parties,

607
00:35:42.102 --> 00:35:44.052
these right wing populists realized that there was a

608
00:35:44.062 --> 00:35:47.731
great opportunity for them to capture these voters and

609
00:35:47.741 --> 00:35:50.511
more generally to capture a lot of the resentments

610
00:35:50.521 --> 00:35:52.622
that were growing in society. So, you know, one

611
00:35:52.632 --> 00:35:55.562
of the other palpable trends of the early 21st

612
00:35:55.572 --> 00:35:59.761
century in Western Europe. This would actually later happen

613
00:35:59.771 --> 00:36:01.271
in eastern Europe as well is that these right

614
00:36:01.281 --> 00:36:04.041
wing populist parties began to change their own economic

615
00:36:04.052 --> 00:36:08.966
profile. So they began to um criticize globalization. They

616
00:36:08.976 --> 00:36:12.525
began to criticize free trade. They became advocates of

617
00:36:12.535 --> 00:36:15.295
what is sometimes referred to as welfare chauvinism. That

618
00:36:15.305 --> 00:36:17.815
is to say we favor a strong welfare state,

619
00:36:17.936 --> 00:36:22.525
but only for, you know, native born citizens. Um

620
00:36:22.535 --> 00:36:25.446
THEY favor a strong state, a strong national state

621
00:36:25.456 --> 00:36:29.166
that can both fight back against, you know, international

622
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:33.770
economic trends, as well as international whatever organizations and

623
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.399
forces that are trying to, you know, get our

624
00:36:36.409 --> 00:36:40.679
countries to um you know, engage in practices that

625
00:36:40.689 --> 00:36:43.639
are not helpful for our own citizens. So these

626
00:36:43.649 --> 00:36:46.850
right wing populist parties really changed their own economic

627
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:51.250
profile to, to make themselves into much more viable

628
00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.340
critics of what you might consider to be whatever

629
00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:59.379
neo liberalized, globalized capitalism. And this is a large

630
00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:04.189
part of the story of um their success and

631
00:37:04.199 --> 00:37:06.699
a large part of the story of why voting

632
00:37:06.709 --> 00:37:10.149
patterns and um you know, party systems have also

633
00:37:10.159 --> 00:37:13.649
really changed in Western Europe over the past decades.

634
00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:18.530
So you mentioned globalization there and on the side

635
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:24.199
of the left, how have people been thinking about

636
00:37:24.209 --> 00:37:28.659
globalization and dealing with it uh theoretically and so

637
00:37:28.669 --> 00:37:32.600
on? I mean, what do leftist people particularly nowadays

638
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.560
have to say about globalization?

639
00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:39.520
Well, globalization is a big, a big word and

640
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.139
um you know, it can mean a lot of

641
00:37:41.149 --> 00:37:43.709
different things. I mean, there was generally a sort

642
00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:50.050
of embrace of globalization, both um socially and economically

643
00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:53.020
as we've already talked about in the 19 nineties.

644
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.629
That is to say the idea that, you know,

645
00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:57.139
a sort of more globalized capitalism and a more

646
00:37:57.149 --> 00:38:01.330
open trade system. Um YOU know, all those kinds

647
00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.889
of things that, that was generally a good thing.

648
00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:07.739
Um But also going along with, you know, free

649
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:12.139
flow of trade and goods and um financial flows

650
00:38:12.149 --> 00:38:15.830
and all these kinds of things also came obviously

651
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.709
um a greater, greater um flows of citizens or

652
00:38:19.719 --> 00:38:23.500
people back and forth across borders. And that was

653
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:27.429
also to a significant degree um embraced by the

654
00:38:27.439 --> 00:38:31.290
left during the late 20th century. And you know,

655
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:35.812
this is obviously also generated something of a backlash,

656
00:38:35.822 --> 00:38:40.603
right? Because as we've had really massive immigration flows

657
00:38:40.613 --> 00:38:43.792
in Western Europe and also in the United States

658
00:38:43.802 --> 00:38:45.802
where we've had, you know, we've had some experience

659
00:38:45.812 --> 00:38:47.712
in the past in the US with massive immigration

660
00:38:47.722 --> 00:38:50.772
flows. Although there's been really a huge jump over

661
00:38:50.782 --> 00:38:53.222
the past decade or decade and a half. I

662
00:38:53.232 --> 00:38:56.492
mean, these also that aspect of globalization, the freer

663
00:38:56.502 --> 00:38:59.772
movement of people, as well as the freer movement

664
00:38:59.782 --> 00:39:03.035
of freer movement of goods and money has also

665
00:39:03.045 --> 00:39:07.436
created a whole variety of challenges and problems, not

666
00:39:07.446 --> 00:39:10.875
just for the left, but for um Western societies

667
00:39:10.885 --> 00:39:14.275
more generally. Um BECAUSE dealing with all of these

668
00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:17.956
people often coming from really difficult backgrounds is a

669
00:39:17.966 --> 00:39:21.716
huge financial challenge, a huge social challenge. And um

670
00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.956
you know, again, it has created a lot of

671
00:39:24.006 --> 00:39:27.956
problems as well as obviously a backlash that um

672
00:39:27.966 --> 00:39:30.706
folks on the populist right were able to um

673
00:39:30.716 --> 00:39:31.676
take advantage of.

674
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.409
So something I haven't asked you directly about yet

675
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:40.639
is fascism. And with the current rise of the

676
00:39:40.649 --> 00:39:44.729
right of right wing populism, people are worried about

677
00:39:44.739 --> 00:39:49.520
the possible return of fascism across Europe. And so

678
00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:54.110
uh and elsewhere. So what is exactly the relationship

679
00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.679
between populism and fascism?

680
00:39:57.969 --> 00:40:02.389
So um so great another, another really um important

681
00:40:02.399 --> 00:40:05.550
question. So, I mean, look, oftentimes these terms are

682
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.100
conflated. Um And I think that that is um

683
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:15.399
understandable but somewhat dangerous. Um TO my mind, fascism

684
00:40:15.409 --> 00:40:20.239
means something very specific. It's obviously linked to movements

685
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:24.469
that appeared in Europe. Um DURING the interwar years,

686
00:40:24.479 --> 00:40:28.735
these were anti democratic movements, very anti democratic movements,

687
00:40:28.745 --> 00:40:33.945
they were illiberal movements, they were overtly racist movements,

688
00:40:34.145 --> 00:40:38.205
they were revolutionary, they were violent, inherently violent, they,

689
00:40:38.215 --> 00:40:42.215
you know, included um paramilitary units, they were very

690
00:40:42.225 --> 00:40:45.995
willing to use violence against their own citizens as

691
00:40:46.004 --> 00:40:49.399
well as in many cases internationally fascism. I mean,

692
00:40:49.409 --> 00:40:51.959
means something very specific. It doesn't just mean, you

693
00:40:51.969 --> 00:40:54.520
know, we don't like immigrants, it doesn't just mean

694
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:56.899
we don't like elites, it doesn't just mean, you

695
00:40:56.909 --> 00:41:00.439
know, we have criticisms of real existing democracy, it

696
00:41:00.449 --> 00:41:03.439
means something very specific, right? So, so I'm very

697
00:41:03.449 --> 00:41:07.520
hesitant to use that term lightly and I'm very,

698
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:11.010
very hesitant to conflate it to conflate fascism in

699
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:15.149
any movement or party that is on the right.

700
00:41:15.159 --> 00:41:17.300
So I, I want to just state that sort

701
00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.570
of openly right up front when we look at

702
00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:23.729
right wing populist parties in Europe across Europe today.

703
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:26.399
Um I think we see a very, a very

704
00:41:26.409 --> 00:41:31.050
broad continuum. Um SOME of these parties have become

705
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.489
over time, what I would actually consider to be

706
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:38.370
more national conservative in a way than even right

707
00:41:38.379 --> 00:41:40.449
wing populism. So if we look at something like,

708
00:41:40.459 --> 00:41:45.120
you know, Marine Le Pen's National front, national rally,

709
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:49.379
that party has moderated really quite a lot since

710
00:41:49.389 --> 00:41:51.850
the time when it was run by her father,

711
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:56.239
he was an open holocaust denier, openly racist. Um

712
00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.830
His commitments to the democratic rules of the game

713
00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:03.159
were very unclear right to gain power, to gain

714
00:42:03.169 --> 00:42:06.050
legitimacy, to gain more voters. She has her the

715
00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.179
the daughter in addition to overthrowing her father in

716
00:42:09.189 --> 00:42:11.840
a kind of palace coup has very much tried

717
00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:14.649
to de demonize that party and she has really

718
00:42:14.659 --> 00:42:18.360
shifted its positions in a very, in a very

719
00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.989
significant way. Um You know, she is not anti

720
00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.540
democratic, at least openly. She has traded her father's

721
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:29.659
open racism and anti Semitism for criticisms of immigration

722
00:42:29.669 --> 00:42:34.600
that really focus on a assimilation and b economic

723
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.600
concerns. Um You know, so this is a much,

724
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:40.810
this is a party that is conservative in some

725
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.939
ways, not in others, like I said on economics,

726
00:42:43.949 --> 00:42:45.909
it is not conservative at all. It is a

727
00:42:45.919 --> 00:42:48.290
nationalist party in the sense that, you know, it

728
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.889
is very wary of immigration. And very much for

729
00:42:50.899 --> 00:42:55.419
national sovereignty. Um I would not characterize that party

730
00:42:55.429 --> 00:42:58.600
in its current form as anti Democratic at all.

731
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:01.330
And so I think inflating that, you know, the

732
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:05.219
contemporary national rally with fascism is a very big

733
00:43:05.229 --> 00:43:08.510
mistake, not only because it's really confusing the phenomenon,

734
00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.699
but it, it, it indicates very different ways of

735
00:43:10.709 --> 00:43:12.300
dealing with it when you are dealing with a

736
00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:15.219
fascist party, a party that is absolutely committed to

737
00:43:15.229 --> 00:43:19.514
overthrowing democracy by violence, if necessary, the kinds of

738
00:43:19.524 --> 00:43:21.735
means that you would use to fight that party

739
00:43:21.745 --> 00:43:23.885
are very different than the kinds of means that

740
00:43:23.895 --> 00:43:26.564
I think are legitimate to use to fight back

741
00:43:26.574 --> 00:43:30.004
against a party like the national rally. Now, there

742
00:43:30.014 --> 00:43:33.794
are parties in Europe that are clearly um anti

743
00:43:33.925 --> 00:43:36.784
democratic. There's a bunch of them as we um

744
00:43:37.439 --> 00:43:40.330
alluded to earlier in eastern Europe parties that have,

745
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.399
you know, are not interested in playing by democratic

746
00:43:42.409 --> 00:43:44.280
rules of the game that have tried to undermine

747
00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:48.250
the democratic rules of the game successfully in Hungary

748
00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.909
semi successfully in Poland. I still would not consider

749
00:43:51.919 --> 00:43:55.010
those parties fascist. Although they are clearly anti democratic,

750
00:43:55.159 --> 00:43:58.330
there are parties that are anti Democratic in Western

751
00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.350
Europe. The A FD is the most obvious one.

752
00:44:01.419 --> 00:44:04.250
But there, it's really quite a broad range of

753
00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.100
parties um uh in that or under that right

754
00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:11.600
wing populist rubric. Um AND there are not that

755
00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:14.909
many of them that I would term fascist, although

756
00:44:14.919 --> 00:44:18.250
some of them um have questionable commitments to democracy

757
00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.020
and then others do not. I mean, we have

758
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.469
had that, uh I'm sorry, we have had right

759
00:44:22.479 --> 00:44:26.320
wing populist parties in power in many West European

760
00:44:26.409 --> 00:44:30.820
countries in Denmark. Obviously. Now in Italy, they've been

761
00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:34.540
part of governing coalitions, uh Denmark, Finland and other

762
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:38.419
places and there has been no democratic erosion, there

763
00:44:38.429 --> 00:44:40.790
may have been some shift in policies but no

764
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.719
democratic erosion. And so, you know, really thinking about

765
00:44:44.729 --> 00:44:48.189
these parties under the framework of fascism, I think

766
00:44:48.199 --> 00:44:50.820
is really um quite misleading.

767
00:44:51.979 --> 00:44:56.360
And what can we do to avoid democratic erosion?

768
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:00.840
Well, what we can do to avoid democratic erosion

769
00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:04.919
is to have democratic parties and politicians, that is

770
00:45:04.929 --> 00:45:07.909
to say people who are committed parties who are

771
00:45:07.919 --> 00:45:10.860
committed to democratic rules of the game solve the

772
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:14.989
problems that um their citizens are facing. I mean,

773
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.580
we have some real challenges in Europe and in

774
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.790
the United States, economic challenges which we've already mentioned

775
00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:29.508
growing inequality, slow growth, increasing economic insecurity, growing divergences

776
00:45:29.518 --> 00:45:33.998
between again, rural and urban areas and again, huge

777
00:45:34.008 --> 00:45:39.357
demographic changes in many Western European societies, incredibly large

778
00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:42.978
numbers of immigrants and obviously immigrants can be an

779
00:45:42.988 --> 00:45:47.097
incredible source of strength, not only economically but socially

780
00:45:47.107 --> 00:45:52.006
right, diversity is a potentially great thing, but governments

781
00:45:52.016 --> 00:45:55.375
have to be able to deal with these challenges.

782
00:45:55.385 --> 00:45:59.486
They have to show people that um diversity means

783
00:45:59.496 --> 00:46:05.025
stronger economies, more attractive societies and that requires policies

784
00:46:05.035 --> 00:46:09.375
to integrate people, to provide them with jobs, to

785
00:46:09.385 --> 00:46:12.895
provide them with education, to not make citizens feel

786
00:46:12.906 --> 00:46:15.986
like they are competing with each other for resources.

787
00:46:16.196 --> 00:46:19.593
And when, when government deal with the challenges that

788
00:46:19.604 --> 00:46:24.813
their societies face, there's less dissatisfaction, there's less resentment

789
00:46:24.843 --> 00:46:28.354
and therefore fewer people who are willing to vote

790
00:46:28.364 --> 00:46:32.233
for parties that claim the establishment is corrupt, the

791
00:46:32.243 --> 00:46:35.053
system is corrupt and we should just blow the

792
00:46:35.063 --> 00:46:38.354
whole thing up. So, I mean, ultimately dealing with

793
00:46:38.364 --> 00:46:43.464
populism and dealing with democratic decay means that mainstream

794
00:46:43.474 --> 00:46:47.332
parties and committed Democrats, small d Democrats, people who

795
00:46:47.342 --> 00:46:50.852
are committed to democracy really need to look at

796
00:46:50.862 --> 00:46:55.971
the kinds of grievances. People have the challenges their

797
00:46:55.981 --> 00:47:00.221
societies face and come up with viable and attractive

798
00:47:00.231 --> 00:47:04.402
solutions to those challenges. If they do so, then

799
00:47:04.412 --> 00:47:09.072
the constituency for populism will decline and dissatisfaction with

800
00:47:09.082 --> 00:47:10.501
democracy will dissipate.

801
00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.050
So let me ask you one last question, then

802
00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:18.330
then talking again about uh leftism since we started

803
00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.620
our conversation by talking a little bit about the

804
00:47:20.629 --> 00:47:24.100
history of the left throughout the 19, in the

805
00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:29.100
19th 20th and 21st centuries. Um How do you

806
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:34.909
look at the future of leftism, particularly looking at

807
00:47:34.919 --> 00:47:40.280
the main current challenges that we have to deal

808
00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:40.610
with?

809
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:45.899
So I would say western societies and in that,

810
00:47:45.909 --> 00:47:51.760
I mean, Europe, the United States, Canada, whatever that

811
00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:55.639
we really face two main challenges and they're, they're

812
00:47:55.649 --> 00:47:59.729
not new challenges. Um BUT there and but, but

813
00:47:59.739 --> 00:48:02.870
they have a new form the first challenge is

814
00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:05.679
the challenge we began by talking about, which is

815
00:48:05.689 --> 00:48:10.699
the challenge of capitalism. Um Capitalism is the best

816
00:48:10.709 --> 00:48:13.719
system that we have so far for generating economic

817
00:48:13.729 --> 00:48:19.110
growth and innovation, which um we all need societies

818
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.800
need. Um But it has also some very, very

819
00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:27.790
dangerous tendencies and consequences both from an economic perspective

820
00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.550
and from a social and political perspective, right? And

821
00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.429
what we've seen, I think since the 19 nineties

822
00:48:33.439 --> 00:48:37.469
was that the balance between sort of capitalism and

823
00:48:37.479 --> 00:48:41.669
the state um was out of whack capitalism grew

824
00:48:41.679 --> 00:48:45.909
increasingly so to speak, unconstrained and the negative consequences

825
00:48:45.919 --> 00:48:49.320
of that were really quite dire. So, I mean,

826
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:51.379
I think the first challenge that we face is

827
00:48:51.389 --> 00:48:56.659
figuring out once again how to maximize capitalism's upsides.

828
00:48:56.669 --> 00:48:59.330
We want to generate growth, we want to generate

829
00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.689
innovation, but we need to minimize its downsides. We

830
00:49:02.699 --> 00:49:07.540
cannot have severe economic dislocations and crises. We cannot

831
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:12.000
have growing inequality, we cannot have growing insecurity, all

832
00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:17.010
of those things generate social divisions, political resentments and

833
00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.620
they are just unsustainable. So the first challenge that

834
00:49:20.629 --> 00:49:22.570
we face and the first challenge that I think

835
00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.060
the left should be at the forefront of dealing

836
00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:28.090
with is the challenge of how to recreate that

837
00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.770
kind of balance between capitalism's upsides and downsides. The

838
00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.639
left lost the lead a little bit on that

839
00:49:34.649 --> 00:49:37.419
in the late 20th century and figuring out how

840
00:49:37.429 --> 00:49:40.340
to sharpen its profile, how to put forward a

841
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:45.080
program that is both attractive and effective for doing

842
00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:50.520
that thing, maximizing upsides, minimizing downsides that is necessary

843
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:55.020
both for successful left and successful democracy. The other

844
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:58.659
great challenge is the challenge of diversity, right? Western

845
00:49:58.669 --> 00:50:02.139
societies are more diverse than they have been before.

846
00:50:02.149 --> 00:50:04.600
They are not only more diverse for the obvious

847
00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:08.830
reasons that we've had incredible amounts of immigration. If

848
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:12.090
you look at some countries in Western Europe, um

849
00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:15.060
you know, Scandinavian countries, other countries, these are countries

850
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:19.469
that have very little history of dealing with this

851
00:50:19.479 --> 00:50:22.570
kind of diversity and they have changed demographically in

852
00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:25.899
an incredible way in the last several decades. This

853
00:50:25.909 --> 00:50:29.580
is an incredible challenge. It has not been sufficiently

854
00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:32.370
thought through um or dealt with by either the

855
00:50:32.379 --> 00:50:35.860
left or other mainstream parties, but it's not just

856
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:39.590
the diversity comes from immigration in a wonderful way.

857
00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.169
Since the 19 sixties, societies have become more diverse

858
00:50:43.179 --> 00:50:45.830
in the sense that women and other minorities have

859
00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.830
demanded full and equal rights that they should be

860
00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:53.250
incorporated as full and equal citizens without discrimination and

861
00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:57.510
without prejudice in all of the rights of citizenship.

862
00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:02.090
And this is an important indeed, very positive change.

863
00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:08.500
But again, one that requires adaptation and bringing citizens

864
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.639
along, right? So dealing with this challenge of diversity,

865
00:51:11.649 --> 00:51:16.320
the challenge and incredible promise of pluralism. This is

866
00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:19.919
the other great challenge of the 21st century, one

867
00:51:19.929 --> 00:51:23.169
that I think that the left is again, uniquely

868
00:51:23.179 --> 00:51:27.040
positioned to deal with. Um BUT has lost, I

869
00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:30.000
think a little bit of the thread over the

870
00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:33.459
last couple of decades, but absolutely needs to be

871
00:51:33.469 --> 00:51:39.530
thinking about how to um again, rec uh rather

872
00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:44.530
reconcile diversity and democracy just as we need to

873
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.540
reconcile capitalism and democracy. These are the two great

874
00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:51.580
challenges. They are not new challenges, but they have

875
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:54.310
reemerged. I think in a very powerful way in

876
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.479
the last few decades and they really will determine,

877
00:51:57.489 --> 00:51:59.850
I think both the future of the left and

878
00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:01.969
the health of democracy in the years to come.

879
00:52:02.909 --> 00:52:06.600
So if listeners and viewers are interested in learning

880
00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:09.729
more about the topics we explore there today, where

881
00:52:09.739 --> 00:52:12.110
can they find you when you work on the

882
00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:12.770
internet?

883
00:52:13.479 --> 00:52:15.989
Well, I mean, I'm, I'm an academic so um

884
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.600
I can be easily found just by Googling my

885
00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:21.770
name. I have a website that has um links

886
00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.860
to my books and to my articles. And there

887
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:28.949
are actually in addition to myself, obviously an incredible

888
00:52:28.959 --> 00:52:32.909
number of scholars and organizations working on these topics

889
00:52:32.919 --> 00:52:36.590
on the topic, for instance, of how to um

890
00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:40.250
manage 21st century capitalism. I would say that over

891
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:43.469
the last decade or two, particularly since the financial

892
00:52:43.479 --> 00:52:46.879
crisis, there has actually been an explosion of um

893
00:52:46.889 --> 00:52:51.399
promising progressive work on this topic um out there

894
00:52:51.409 --> 00:52:55.370
and so much more hopeful on, you know, new

895
00:52:55.379 --> 00:52:58.169
policies, new approaches to dealing with capitalism than I

896
00:52:58.179 --> 00:53:00.719
would have been before. And there's just lots of

897
00:53:00.729 --> 00:53:04.439
great work out there um on these topics that

898
00:53:04.449 --> 00:53:06.870
hopefully people will read and think about and use

899
00:53:06.879 --> 00:53:09.169
when they decide how to vote and how to

900
00:53:09.179 --> 00:53:12.270
try to influence um policies in their own countries.

901
00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:15.899
