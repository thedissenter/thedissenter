00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.279
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:06.280
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.359
today I'm joined by Doctor Vanessa Wills. She is

4
00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:13.470
associate professor of philosophy at the George Washington University,

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.280
and today we're talking about her book, Marx's Ethical

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.239
Vision. So, Doctor Wills, welcome to the show. It's

7
00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:22.120
a pleasure to

8
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.280
everyone. Thank you so much for having me. I'm

9
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.950
excited to, to speak with you today.

10
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.489
So tell me, uh, start by telling us a

11
00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.119
little bit about what's behind this book. I mean,

12
00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:37.720
what got you interested in exploring what the Marxist

13
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.610
theory would would entail about the nature of morality.

14
00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:46.950
Uh, SO I was already a philosophy student when

15
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.610
I Uh, became familiar with Marx's ideas and started

16
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.720
to get to know socialists, uh, which happened through

17
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.889
activism that I was doing in the early 2000s.

18
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.449
I joined the anti-war movement, um, protesting against the

19
00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.599
US invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the war

20
00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:12.650
on terror, the so-called war on terror in general.

21
00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:17.389
And in doing that, I've uh got to know

22
00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:20.239
more people who were on the left who came

23
00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:24.400
out of a tradition of working class activism and

24
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.949
ideas, and I especially noticed that Uh, after the

25
00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:35.019
2004 presidential election in the United States, many of

26
00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:40.379
the liberals I knew were extremely disoriented and demobilized.

27
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.790
And the people who were ready to hit the

28
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.379
streets again, right? And just kind of, or continue

29
00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:49.855
to. And to keep going and to try to

30
00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:53.495
analyze the moment and think about how to intervene

31
00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:56.654
in it, they were socialists. And that's what I

32
00:01:56.654 --> 00:01:59.375
wanted to be doing. So that is who I

33
00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:02.455
was attracted to and drawn to. And that's how

34
00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:06.934
I got to learn more about Marx's ideas. Um,

35
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.770
And I found that I was also, I also

36
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.820
had these kind of personal questions about just my

37
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.809
involvement in activism, what it is that I was

38
00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:23.330
doing. And so they, the same kind of philosophical

39
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.410
spirit, I guess, that is the reason I was

40
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.529
already a philosophy PhD in the first place, I

41
00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:33.214
brought to that work that I was doing. And

42
00:02:33.214 --> 00:02:36.485
I wanted to, I wanted to investigate these, these

43
00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:39.524
questions about the, the sort of the, the meaning

44
00:02:39.524 --> 00:02:42.054
of this activism and how it fit into a

45
00:02:42.054 --> 00:02:46.455
larger context of how to promote the well-being of,

46
00:02:46.494 --> 00:02:49.815
of, of humans in general, how to, um, do

47
00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:52.934
good in the world. And, and so that's, that

48
00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:56.074
question began to really obsess me.

49
00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.500
But one very interesting thing, and you also mentioned

50
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.210
this in your book, is that in the critique

51
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.130
of German ideology, Marx and Engel say that quote,

52
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.380
the communists do not preach morality at all. So

53
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.740
how do you deal with that?

54
00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.130
Yeah, that's the, that's the, uh, one of the

55
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.000
most important questions. And I mean, I, I take

56
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.970
it exactly on its face. I think, uh, I

57
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.449
also, uh, think it's a mistake to preach morality

58
00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:30.089
to working people, because I think that the work

59
00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:35.520
that moral philosophers can do is rather to interpret

60
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.065
the Radically, abstractly, and philosophically, um, uh, aims and

61
00:03:42.065 --> 00:03:46.906
practices, uh, that are already existing in working class

62
00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:50.826
struggle. And so I, I take it that what

63
00:03:50.826 --> 00:03:53.546
I'm up to in that book and in a

64
00:03:53.546 --> 00:03:56.626
lot of my work is to, is, is to

65
00:03:56.626 --> 00:04:02.641
think through. TO its logical conclusions, the already existing

66
00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:07.042
activity of working people attempting to survive and attempting

67
00:04:07.042 --> 00:04:11.442
to push back against that which uh frustrates their

68
00:04:11.442 --> 00:04:15.841
ability to satisfy basic needs and much less to

69
00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:18.992
actually flourish as individual human beings.

70
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.359
Mhm. So another thing that I would like to

71
00:04:22.359 --> 00:04:27.799
ask you is, is morality a form of ideology

72
00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:32.079
and what this ideology mean in Marxism?

73
00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:36.179
Yeah, so, uh, so for the first question, I

74
00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:40.070
say yes, but of course that hangs on the

75
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.309
answer to the second question, right, of what is

76
00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:44.140
it when we, what does it mean to talk

77
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.980
about ideology? So, one very common way of thinking

78
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:56.369
about ideology is that it is always illusory, always,

79
00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:01.980
such as to conceal reality, um, maybe even that

80
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.019
it is inherently reactionary and has an inherent ruling

81
00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:12.630
class, uh, content, um, such that it should, if

82
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.029
on this way of thinking about it, be understood

83
00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:21.299
as a, uh, a conceptual, uh, form through which

84
00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:25.910
a ruling class of society imposes its views of

85
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.470
the world onto those of the, those who are

86
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.790
ruled, right? You know, the working classes, um, those

87
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.850
who are excluded from work, and so on. Um,

88
00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:40.649
AND there's, in my view, there's a partial truth

89
00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:45.089
to this. Ideology does sometimes function in exactly that

90
00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:48.929
way. Uh, BUT I think that it's important to

91
00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:53.970
think about ideology, the way I argue, um, about

92
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.209
it in the book, as I say that ideology

93
00:05:56.209 --> 00:06:00.920
is better understood, um, as a, uh, a, a.

94
00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:06.380
SYSTEM of ideas that give a, a perspective on

95
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.179
the world from the point of view of a

96
00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:11.820
class. And so, of course, we can have bourgeois

97
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.739
ideology, but I argue that there's also proletarian ideology

98
00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:20.779
as well. And that, uh, Marxism should be thought

99
00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:25.160
of, right, as part of a proletarian ideology. Um,

100
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.839
Uh, THAT, that even more thoroughgoing than that, right?

101
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.989
Any, anything that Um, encourages us to think about

102
00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:39.220
the world as something that is historical, that is

103
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.220
dynamic, that is constantly changing, and in a process

104
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:49.320
of unending transformation into which we are already intervening,

105
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.029
and to which we can intervene more rationally and

106
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:57.179
more consciously and more collectively and socially than we

107
00:06:57.179 --> 00:07:00.782
have so far. So as To bring about the

108
00:07:00.782 --> 00:07:05.261
conditions for human well-being and flourishing, right? And for

109
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:08.742
the, um, the expansion of our powers and ways

110
00:07:08.742 --> 00:07:13.571
of interacting with one another in prosocial ways. Um,

111
00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:17.421
THE piece that the, the sort of critical or,

112
00:07:17.492 --> 00:07:21.541
or I should say the pejorative, maybe piece that

113
00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:25.381
remains even on my understanding of ideology is that

114
00:07:25.381 --> 00:07:28.773
it ideology is, is very much a form of

115
00:07:28.773 --> 00:07:33.053
thought that we find in class society. And so

116
00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:36.334
I do think that when we think about the

117
00:07:36.334 --> 00:07:39.734
possibility of moving beyond class society, that part of

118
00:07:39.734 --> 00:07:43.294
what we are talking about then is the abolition

119
00:07:43.294 --> 00:07:47.014
of ideological, uh, ways of thinking as well, right?

120
00:07:47.123 --> 00:07:50.973
Ways of thinking that are themselves structured by the

121
00:07:50.973 --> 00:07:55.135
a conflict. Among economic classes. But we're not there

122
00:07:55.135 --> 00:07:58.726
yet. And so we still have to deal with

123
00:07:58.726 --> 00:08:02.885
ideology. We still have to speak, um, and theorize

124
00:08:02.885 --> 00:08:05.045
in, in the, in the ways that are available

125
00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:07.485
to us. And, and the, and the best way

126
00:08:07.485 --> 00:08:10.596
available to us is, um, is, is, is through

127
00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:13.006
a working class perspective on the world. I mean,

128
00:08:13.045 --> 00:08:15.085
which is what Marx, which is what the materialist

129
00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:18.476
conception of history is. It's what Marxism is.

130
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.929
So about that materialist uh perspective on history, what

131
00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:28.890
does it reveal about the nature of human beings?

132
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.030
Yeah, so in the same portion of the critique

133
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.900
of the German ideology where Marx and Engels introduced

134
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.900
this term, so, um, I'm sure many of your

135
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.739
viewers will, will know, but, um, just to, just

136
00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:47.409
to highlight, so. The critique of the German ideology

137
00:08:47.409 --> 00:08:50.340
is the, the place is sort of, you know,

138
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.479
just shy of midway through, uh, Marx's, uh, uh,

139
00:08:55.489 --> 00:09:02.659
theoretical corpus, that is often identified as the line

140
00:09:02.659 --> 00:09:10.929
of demarcation between the poetic, humanistic, romantic, early Marx,

141
00:09:11.229 --> 00:09:17.114
and the hard-nosed scientific by the Numbers, uh, materialist,

142
00:09:17.354 --> 00:09:23.114
determinist, later marks, right? Um, AND, uh, and it's

143
00:09:23.114 --> 00:09:27.315
the first place that Marx and Engel, his collaborator

144
00:09:27.315 --> 00:09:30.875
Friedrich Engels, present what could be called a kind

145
00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:37.265
of mature, you know, sort of well-developed explanation of

146
00:09:37.474 --> 00:09:40.585
their methodology of, of how it is that they

147
00:09:40.585 --> 00:09:46.309
are approaching the questions they take up. And They,

148
00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.580
so they say in the same place where they

149
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.140
talk about the what they call the materialist conception

150
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.820
of history, they say that it is um it

151
00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.450
is that their method is to look not at

152
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:05.299
man, right, capital M, as an abstraction, uh, but

153
00:10:05.299 --> 00:10:13.909
rather men. In actual concrete, historical individual human beings

154
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:19.369
to examine how it is that human beings have

155
00:10:19.659 --> 00:10:25.679
have uh intervened into their natural and social circumstances

156
00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:29.400
so as to satisfy their needs and how that

157
00:10:29.445 --> 00:10:34.955
Process of labor and needs satisfaction, then transforms human

158
00:10:34.955 --> 00:10:41.195
beings and explains everything, actually, about why it is

159
00:10:41.195 --> 00:10:44.036
that history has unfolded in the way that it

160
00:10:44.036 --> 00:10:48.765
has, and that therefore also provides some guidance about

161
00:10:48.955 --> 00:10:52.151
how human beings might go on to Intervene in

162
00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:54.952
a, a fully in a conscious way, which is

163
00:10:54.952 --> 00:10:59.911
to say, aware of themselves as having this, this,

164
00:10:59.952 --> 00:11:05.012
as being, uh, engaged in this activity of producing

165
00:11:05.012 --> 00:11:10.312
themselves through their interventions into the world out of

166
00:11:10.312 --> 00:11:16.090
which human beings emerge. Um, And, uh, and so

167
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.559
one way that I think about this for myself,

168
00:11:19.849 --> 00:11:24.359
um, when, you know, uh, philosophy is hard and,

169
00:11:24.929 --> 00:11:28.609
and whatever, I feel stuck and I'm trying to

170
00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:31.770
make sense of, of some problem or think through

171
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.169
what it is to have a Marxist approach to

172
00:11:34.169 --> 00:11:38.469
a question. I come back to a little slogan

173
00:11:38.469 --> 00:11:42.789
for myself, which is human existence is a human

174
00:11:42.789 --> 00:11:47.349
product, which is, which can sound very simple and

175
00:11:47.349 --> 00:11:53.270
almost pat, but has profound implications. So I think

176
00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.510
it, one great example is in the case of

177
00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.710
race. There's a lot of work on race that

178
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.984
treats. AS though they are basically a historical and

179
00:12:04.984 --> 00:12:09.205
natural and sort of given to us. Um, THERE,

180
00:12:09.325 --> 00:12:13.885
that treats racism and racist antipathy as though it

181
00:12:13.885 --> 00:12:20.005
is a ineluctable and ineradicable feature of essential human

182
00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:23.364
nature that can't be done away with. But if

183
00:12:23.364 --> 00:12:27.520
we remember that Human existence as a human product,

184
00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:31.039
and therefore, with the question of race too, we

185
00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:33.109
have to ask how it is that human beings

186
00:12:33.109 --> 00:12:37.479
have produced this concept and produced these ways of

187
00:12:37.479 --> 00:12:40.880
relating to one another and produced these attitudes that

188
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:46.130
then leads us away from, uh, sort of fatalism

189
00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.200
about it, or the idea that it can't be

190
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.599
done away with and leads us toward looking at

191
00:12:51.599 --> 00:12:54.780
what point, at what point in history. And as

192
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:59.250
a result of what historical forces did this emerge

193
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.289
and come about, and what could potentially be leveraged

194
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:08.130
and intervened into to do away with racism. Um,

195
00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:10.460
SO that's just to give one example of what

196
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.580
it looks like to take a materialist conception of

197
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.619
history and see what human beings are as having

198
00:13:16.619 --> 00:13:20.219
a history and the content of that history being

199
00:13:20.219 --> 00:13:22.179
human agency, human activity.

200
00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.599
Mhm. But I, I mean, in, on the topic

201
00:13:26.599 --> 00:13:31.070
of human nature, what kind of normativity derives then

202
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:35.030
from this view of human nature, if any, and

203
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.229
what is the rich individual for Marx?

204
00:13:39.659 --> 00:13:43.469
Yes. Um, SO, it's a, uh, it's a great

205
00:13:43.469 --> 00:13:46.590
question because on the one hand, what I've said

206
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.219
is quite thin, you know, so I think that

207
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:54.630
for Mark's human nature is labor. It is that

208
00:13:54.630 --> 00:14:01.070
activity of conscious and goal-directed intervention into our environments

209
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:06.570
to satisfy our needs. Um, BUT precisely because I

210
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.369
think almost, well, everything about human beings can be

211
00:14:10.369 --> 00:14:13.210
thought of in these terms and explained in these

212
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.539
terms. Um, IT also means that it's not as

213
00:14:17.539 --> 00:14:20.299
though you can sort of neatly say, well, these

214
00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:23.380
are the things that are instances of labor, and

215
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.049
those things aren't. So those things are somehow, um,

216
00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.000
inhuman or uh income or or sort of not

217
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.729
properly thought of as part of human nature. It

218
00:14:33.729 --> 00:14:38.210
all is. Um, BUT the normativity derives from the

219
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.760
fact that some of the things that we do

220
00:14:40.969 --> 00:14:46.650
are such as to promote our existence as as

221
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.840
beings that engage in this process of human self

222
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.010
changing, of human self-creation, and some things are such

223
00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:57.729
as to stultify it and limit it, and prevent

224
00:14:57.729 --> 00:15:00.890
it or bring it to an end altogether. And

225
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.109
I take it that this is one of the

226
00:15:03.489 --> 00:15:09.159
most important arguments for communism and against capitalism, that

227
00:15:09.169 --> 00:15:13.340
that uh that capitalism in a very fundamental and

228
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:19.250
basic sense is going to kill us, um, you

229
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:26.309
know, whether it's climate change. Uh, ILLNESS, um, uh,

230
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.630
I mean, you, you war, uh, you name it.

231
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.799
Uh, AND that's even before we get to the

232
00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:36.909
sort of everyday of, um, of, of, of going

233
00:15:36.909 --> 00:15:40.109
to, uh, I mean, I'm fortunate, I'm a philosopher.

234
00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:43.130
I can go to work and dream or whatever,

235
00:15:43.239 --> 00:15:46.479
you know, um, but, you know, but, but, but,

236
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.890
but also just Just the sort of everyday mundane

237
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.989
reality of, uh, you know, of the, the, the

238
00:15:52.989 --> 00:15:56.979
millions of human beings that have lived lives where

239
00:15:57.229 --> 00:16:01.190
they're going to work and doing the same boring,

240
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:07.669
stultifying, degrading work, hour after hour, day after day,

241
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.510
year after year, until the end, until their lives

242
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.830
end. And which is also a kind of death

243
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.280
for a human being. Um, AND to contrast that

244
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.760
with Marx's idea of, of rich individuality of the

245
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.320
rich human being, he's, he's speaking there of a

246
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.609
person who is, um, engaged in, in, in this,

247
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.460
um, The the the sort of uh all-sided in

248
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:43.299
principle, limitless proliferation of the ways that they can

249
00:16:43.299 --> 00:16:47.770
engage with other people, with the world around them.

250
00:16:47.989 --> 00:16:50.650
Um, I mean, we, we have this, for example,

251
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.900
it's also in the, um, ideology, you know, Marx

252
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.659
talks about even, uh, even the, the sort of

253
00:16:57.659 --> 00:17:01.960
being constricted to one. Profession, he thinks is at

254
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.800
odds with the notion of rich individuality, um, because

255
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.390
people need time and, and energy and resources to

256
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.848
be a, uh, you know, a, a, a, a

257
00:17:14.848 --> 00:17:16.959
fisher in the morning. And I forget exactly how

258
00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:18.280
it goes, but you know, it's like a fisher

259
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.880
in the morning, you know, a baker in the

260
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.439
afternoon, a critical critic at night, right, and so

261
00:17:24.439 --> 00:17:29.579
on. Um. So, um, so that sense of, um,

262
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:34.609
of, of, of I've been using the word flourishing

263
00:17:34.609 --> 00:17:36.270
a lot, but what I wanna say is, is

264
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.790
also, you know, the sense of like, of, of

265
00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:43.119
color, a variety of, of, of mixing it up,

266
00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:46.550
of changing, right, of being different things and doing

267
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.790
different things and of having, having possibilities open to

268
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.859
you and having the world open to you and

269
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.910
being able to Embrace life with a spirit of

270
00:17:57.119 --> 00:18:02.319
um creativity and experimentation and having the material resources

271
00:18:02.319 --> 00:18:05.579
available that support that and make that possible, you

272
00:18:05.579 --> 00:18:07.750
know, all of that I think is bound up

273
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.819
with Marx's um argument for why it is that

274
00:18:11.819 --> 00:18:16.229
it's, it's communism, it is uh a society organized

275
00:18:16.229 --> 00:18:20.650
around. Production for the purpose of human beings and

276
00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:25.130
their flourishing rather than for profit, that is actually

277
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:31.319
compatible with bringing about the full realization of human

278
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:36.369
essence and human nature, which just is um the

279
00:18:36.369 --> 00:18:38.959
sort of conscious creativity itself.

280
00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:42.939
Mhm. Uh, SINCE we are now about to get

281
00:18:42.939 --> 00:18:48.780
into some bourgeois conceptions of ethical values, critiques of

282
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.260
them, and how they are approached through a Marxist

283
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.459
perspective. First of all, what is bourgeois ethics?

284
00:18:57.199 --> 00:19:00.060
Yeah, great question. So one of the things I,

285
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.599
I say in the book is that when I

286
00:19:02.599 --> 00:19:05.540
use the word bourgeois, so by bourgeois, first of

287
00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.579
all, most simply, you know, we mean capitalist, right?

288
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.699
We mean, um, we mean, uh, having to do,

289
00:19:11.739 --> 00:19:16.459
of having to do or associated with. Um, THAT

290
00:19:16.459 --> 00:19:21.660
class in a capitalist society, which owns the means

291
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:27.660
of production, factories, um, raw materials, and so on.

292
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.530
Um, WHICH owns the means of production and is

293
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:37.109
able to, uh, sustains itself and satisfy its needs

294
00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:40.280
in virtue of the fact that it owns the

295
00:19:40.489 --> 00:19:44.089
means of production for that society, um, and therefore

296
00:19:44.089 --> 00:19:47.770
does not have to sell its labor for a.

297
00:19:47.974 --> 00:19:52.194
Wage, unlike the working class, um, which does, um,

298
00:19:52.314 --> 00:19:55.435
which, which, which satisfies its needs by selling its

299
00:19:55.435 --> 00:20:00.145
ability to work as a commodity to capitalists. Um,

300
00:20:00.435 --> 00:20:03.234
SO when I say bourgeois, right, one thing I

301
00:20:03.234 --> 00:20:05.834
just mean is that thing, right? Having to do

302
00:20:05.834 --> 00:20:10.430
with that capitalist class. Um, BUT it's important to

303
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.670
note, and I say this in the book, that

304
00:20:12.869 --> 00:20:16.459
I do not use bourgeois as merely some sort

305
00:20:16.459 --> 00:20:20.310
of shady epithet, right, or name calling. Sometimes people,

306
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.430
oh, it's so bourgeois. OK, that's not what I'm

307
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.469
doing in the book, right? I'm, I'm using it

308
00:20:25.469 --> 00:20:30.819
as a kind of scientific category, um. And, uh,

309
00:20:30.869 --> 00:20:35.910
and, and bourgeois bourgeois ethics, I mean, I, so

310
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:41.109
I am convinced by Marx's argument, and he's, um,

311
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.260
he's, he's following a point made by Hegel earlier

312
00:20:44.589 --> 00:20:47.150
that the, the sort of sine qua non of

313
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:51.270
bourgeois ethics is utilitarianism, right? You know, is this

314
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:56.594
emphasis on cal ability on, on, on utility, right,

315
00:20:56.604 --> 00:21:02.885
on the sort of, um, uh, uh, like identifying

316
00:21:02.885 --> 00:21:06.755
the value of a thing in virtue of, uh,

317
00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:11.285
it's suitability as a means to some further end.

318
00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:17.270
And in uh in utilitarianism, as in capitalism, the

319
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:21.060
end is is sort of like the endless accumulation

320
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.459
of a of a of a good, you know,

321
00:21:23.709 --> 00:21:25.750
um, whether it's utility on the one hand or

322
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.310
capital on the other. Um, WITH some of the

323
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:32.949
other forms of, um, Of, of, of, of ethical

324
00:21:32.949 --> 00:21:37.150
systems that Marx himself criticizes and that I discuss

325
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.060
in the book, the um the connection is less

326
00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.280
plainly obvious, but I think in the case of

327
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.229
Kantunism, for example, which is An ethical view that's

328
00:21:48.229 --> 00:21:52.829
often thought together with Marxism, and there's this long

329
00:21:52.829 --> 00:21:58.430
standing debate and question about whether perhaps Marxism can

330
00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:02.469
be made compatible with Kantian ethics and vice versa.

331
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.469
You know, I think you, you still have there

332
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:09.479
the, the fact that um there's a, a, a

333
00:22:09.479 --> 00:22:14.479
strong emphasis on this notion of an undetermined free

334
00:22:14.479 --> 00:22:20.219
will, um, this kind of philosophically idealist. Um, A

335
00:22:20.219 --> 00:22:25.260
conception of the human being as, um, being most

336
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:30.670
importantly identified with this pure act of, of willing.

337
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.420
Um, AND, and that's the sort of thing that

338
00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:38.989
Marx is gonna think. IS totally incompatible um with

339
00:22:38.989 --> 00:22:43.719
a a viewpoint that is um materialist in the

340
00:22:43.719 --> 00:22:48.239
way that he is, namely, thinking there's nothing about

341
00:22:48.239 --> 00:22:52.459
human beings that can be detached somehow from, uh,

342
00:22:52.479 --> 00:22:55.089
thinking about them in their specific context and in

343
00:22:55.089 --> 00:22:58.219
virtue of their needs and interests. And the last

344
00:22:58.219 --> 00:22:59.880
thing I'll say, cause this is a long answer,

345
00:22:59.959 --> 00:23:02.319
but the last thing I'll say about this is

346
00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:09.079
that um Uh, you know, Marx is very Marx

347
00:23:09.079 --> 00:23:15.270
embraces the idea of encouraging people to act according

348
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.439
to their interests. Um, THIS is the essence of,

349
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.839
I mean, maybe essence is too strong, but this

350
00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:24.839
is a this is like a very significant part

351
00:23:24.839 --> 00:23:28.660
of what's going on. Um, IN Marx's writings that

352
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.839
for the, the it's precisely why the working class

353
00:23:32.219 --> 00:23:36.300
is the class that he identifies as an agent

354
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.420
of historical change. It's because he thinks that the

355
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:43.619
interest that working class people have in surviving and

356
00:23:43.619 --> 00:23:49.880
in not being abused, um, is in alignment with

357
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.880
the interests of humanity in continuing to exist and,

358
00:23:54.949 --> 00:23:58.050
and, you know, perhaps more than exist, maybe have

359
00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.130
a good time while we're existing, continue to make

360
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.689
art, continue to, you know, to have social interactions

361
00:24:04.689 --> 00:24:08.750
that are positive and fulfilling. Um, AND so that

362
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.069
too is gonna be quite a, a difference from

363
00:24:12.069 --> 00:24:16.390
something like Communism, which is very skeptical of the

364
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.239
notion of acting in accordance with your interests and,

365
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:23.489
um, and, and advocates this kind of um Uh,

366
00:24:23.619 --> 00:24:27.140
sacrifice of, of self-interest. So the question is like

367
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.619
what bourgeois ethics, it's gonna depend on what ethical

368
00:24:29.619 --> 00:24:32.260
system we're talking about, but that's just by way

369
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.300
of pointing out some of the things that Mark

370
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.060
sees as distinguishing his view from some of these

371
00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:37.819
others.

372
00:24:38.449 --> 00:24:41.209
Mhm. So, now I want to ask you about

373
00:24:41.209 --> 00:24:45.089
some specific, uh, ethical values that you explore in

374
00:24:45.089 --> 00:24:49.770
the book and their bourgeois version and then how

375
00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.979
we can approach them through a Marxist perspective. So,

376
00:24:53.369 --> 00:24:59.010
starting with individuality, what is individuality and why does

377
00:24:59.010 --> 00:24:59.920
it matter?

378
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.839
That's a great question. What is individual? I mean,

379
00:25:06.959 --> 00:25:10.069
so, in the, in the book, I think about,

380
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.500
I, I, I sort of talk about um A

381
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.060
conception of individuality that Marx has in mind, and

382
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.099
then the question, and then a sort of, and

383
00:25:21.099 --> 00:25:26.500
then that's um contrasted with what he he sees

384
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:32.670
as a capitalist or bourgeois kind of individuality that

385
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:39.959
is um that is that is grounded in A

386
00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:45.369
kind of rigid opposition between the individual and the

387
00:25:45.369 --> 00:25:50.609
social, um, that is that, uh, so he's, this

388
00:25:50.609 --> 00:25:53.050
comes up in places like, for example, the, the

389
00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:59.050
communist manifesto, where Marx imagines a uh a kind

390
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:03.030
of bourgeois critic. Um, SAYING you want to do

391
00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:07.150
away with individuality, and then the answer is, uh,

392
00:26:07.189 --> 00:26:09.270
we want to do away with your kind of

393
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:17.589
individuality, namely this atomized separateness of of of hostile

394
00:26:17.589 --> 00:26:24.550
and competitive individuals who um regard for whom sociality

395
00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.650
is a kind of necessary evil. Um, AND to

396
00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:34.170
be mitigated and guarded against jealously, you know, in

397
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:38.209
every, in every possible way. Um, AND that's, and

398
00:26:38.209 --> 00:26:42.089
that's the vision of, of individuality that Mark sees

399
00:26:42.089 --> 00:26:46.520
as, um, existing in liberalism and sort of social

400
00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.319
contract theory and so on. And He opposes to

401
00:26:51.319 --> 00:26:55.589
it a conception of individuality, uh that is that

402
00:26:55.589 --> 00:27:00.650
is that represents a kind of abolition or overcoming.

403
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.680
Of the seeming opposition between the social and the

404
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.839
individual, um, marks uh sometimes rights of the social

405
00:27:10.839 --> 00:27:15.680
individual, uh, the, the, the person who is only

406
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:21.719
made possible through the, through, through their interactions with

407
00:27:21.719 --> 00:27:25.829
society, um, uh, and, and only as a result

408
00:27:25.829 --> 00:27:30.000
of various kinds of historical transformations over time. And

409
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.050
to, to put that a different way, um, you

410
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:39.290
know, we express our even under capitalism, we express

411
00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:44.089
our individuality in all sorts of ways. Um, I,

412
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:48.520
I love going to the opera. I love cooking.

413
00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:52.010
Um, I love camping, you know, like there's all

414
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:55.130
these, all these things, you know, that are ways

415
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.290
that I like to spend my time if I

416
00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:01.500
can. Um, BUT all of those concepts are totally

417
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.260
historical concepts, right, um, you know, they emerge out

418
00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.699
of a whole history of ways that human beings

419
00:28:07.699 --> 00:28:12.660
have developed. Uh, TO, uh, interact with the world

420
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.979
around them and to conceptualize what it is that

421
00:28:14.979 --> 00:28:19.119
they're doing. Um, AND, and, and so the, the

422
00:28:19.119 --> 00:28:23.160
thought is that it's precisely because of the whole

423
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.520
complexity of human behavior and ways of organizing and

424
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.160
thinking about that behavior that I have available to

425
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.680
me all sorts of ways that I might express

426
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.800
myself in the world, um, which is a, which

427
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.359
is like part and parcel of what makes me

428
00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:44.093
not like the exactly like the person next to

429
00:28:44.093 --> 00:28:46.172
me, right? You know, for all of us. And

430
00:28:46.172 --> 00:28:51.572
so for individuality individuality to be something more than

431
00:28:51.572 --> 00:28:55.692
just the bare fact that we are accountable, you

432
00:28:55.692 --> 00:28:58.812
know, that, that us in this conversation, there's one

433
00:28:58.812 --> 00:29:01.233
and then another one, you know, like, for it

434
00:29:01.233 --> 00:29:04.093
to mean something more than that, um, you know,

435
00:29:04.453 --> 00:29:08.733
requires this whole socio historical story that's gone before.

436
00:29:08.836 --> 00:29:13.586
And so Marx, uh, argues that individuality, um, is

437
00:29:13.586 --> 00:29:18.436
a result of sociality and is, um, is, is

438
00:29:18.436 --> 00:29:21.015
instead of looking at it the other way around

439
00:29:21.015 --> 00:29:24.666
and sort of thinking that society is something that

440
00:29:24.666 --> 00:29:28.595
individuals then on the basis of their rational self-interest

441
00:29:28.595 --> 00:29:31.265
decide to tolerate, you know, what if we look

442
00:29:31.265 --> 00:29:34.416
at the fact that sociality is the kind of,

443
00:29:34.645 --> 00:29:39.920
um, And like original fact of of human of

444
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.560
human existence, which gives rise to the different ways

445
00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:47.290
that individuals might develop themselves and and emerge. Um,

446
00:29:47.599 --> 00:29:50.319
SO it's hard for me to, it's, you know,

447
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.989
because that is the way that I'm thinking about

448
00:29:53.989 --> 00:29:56.280
individuality and and and and the way that I'm

449
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.845
reading marks on individuality. It's hard for me to

450
00:29:59.845 --> 00:30:01.605
actually give a kind of a kind of like

451
00:30:01.605 --> 00:30:04.645
what individuality is in general, right? What it is

452
00:30:04.645 --> 00:30:08.125
that individuality is like a concept of individuality that

453
00:30:08.125 --> 00:30:10.645
is abstract in a way that captures both of

454
00:30:10.645 --> 00:30:14.706
these different ways of thinking about it. Um, AND,

455
00:30:14.755 --> 00:30:16.765
and, and especially cause I tend to think that

456
00:30:16.765 --> 00:30:19.556
the more the more the abstract you get, the

457
00:30:19.556 --> 00:30:21.401
more the closer. You get to the sort of,

458
00:30:21.572 --> 00:30:24.682
well, there's one, and then there's another 12 individual

459
00:30:24.682 --> 00:30:28.432
people. Well, who cares, you know? Um, BUT the

460
00:30:28.432 --> 00:30:31.011
other, the, it's, it's the, it's the, it's the

461
00:30:31.052 --> 00:30:33.052
fact of what it means to have all, you

462
00:30:33.052 --> 00:30:35.572
know, a diverse array of different human beings who

463
00:30:35.572 --> 00:30:38.482
interact with the world in, in their own, uh,

464
00:30:38.491 --> 00:30:42.771
distinctive ways that makes individuality matter, I think. Mhm.

465
00:30:43.109 --> 00:30:47.170
And how about rights? I mean, what are bourgeois

466
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:52.189
equal rights and would there be rights in communism

467
00:30:52.239 --> 00:30:52.660
or not?

468
00:30:53.839 --> 00:30:58.439
Yeah, yeah, so, um, uh, so, so yeah, so

469
00:30:58.439 --> 00:31:03.750
Marxx, um. There's a number of places where, uh,

470
00:31:03.959 --> 00:31:06.359
Marx addresses the question of rights. And, and one

471
00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:09.640
of the places that I, um, uh, that I

472
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.839
look at most, or, or that figures, I think

473
00:31:11.839 --> 00:31:14.880
most significantly into my argument, uh, in that portion

474
00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.869
of the book is the critique of the go

475
00:31:16.869 --> 00:31:22.599
to program, um, where he's, uh, critical of attempts

476
00:31:22.599 --> 00:31:28.060
to Describe capitalism as unjust or as a kind

477
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.189
of rights violation, and he argues that it is

478
00:31:32.189 --> 00:31:36.430
just, uh, it, it is fair, um, and the

479
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:38.790
reason and and it's fair and according to the

480
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:44.829
internal standards of capitalism, but there's also, um, for

481
00:31:44.829 --> 00:31:49.939
Marx, a kind of um I think, um, a

482
00:31:49.949 --> 00:31:55.339
a a kind of historical um assessment of the

483
00:31:55.339 --> 00:31:59.189
of the nature of a right. Um, WHERE, where

484
00:31:59.189 --> 00:32:05.469
he's seeing that rights themselves presuppose a context in

485
00:32:05.469 --> 00:32:09.670
which you're called upon to defend your rights, and

486
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:14.189
you're called upon to um make a claim against

487
00:32:14.189 --> 00:32:17.579
others, um, that is based in rights. And so

488
00:32:17.579 --> 00:32:22.920
he sees it as, um, As as intrinsically, I,

489
00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.790
I mean, sort of the same story I gave

490
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:30.829
about individuality actually, you know, has, uh, important, uh,

491
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.829
you know, links, you know, and kind of dovetails

492
00:32:33.829 --> 00:32:38.270
with the story about rights, um, because the, the

493
00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:42.079
idea of Rights, at least as the individual rights

494
00:32:42.079 --> 00:32:47.119
of capitalist society and liberal democracy, you know, presupposes

495
00:32:47.119 --> 00:32:53.040
the kind of and, uh, generalized antagonism among individuals

496
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:58.300
that, um, we see actually in capitalist society. Um,

497
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:02.959
SO, um, so he, so he, uh, he, so

498
00:33:02.959 --> 00:33:06.319
I think the way to think about rights is

499
00:33:06.319 --> 00:33:10.839
that in Uh, a fully developed communist society, if

500
00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:15.709
we ever see one of those, um, that, um,

501
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:23.439
that the, the salience of an a right. IS

502
00:33:23.719 --> 00:33:26.880
not sort of disappears, sort of goes away, right?

503
00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.280
Because if, if this is if we are imagining

504
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:35.089
a society that's organized precisely to satisfy people's needs

505
00:33:35.089 --> 00:33:38.469
and to make available the things that they want

506
00:33:38.469 --> 00:33:40.479
and require, and I want, I want to be

507
00:33:40.479 --> 00:33:43.239
clear in my what needs here is met extremely

508
00:33:43.239 --> 00:33:47.199
broadly, right? Um, THE, the need for a person

509
00:33:47.199 --> 00:33:50.119
to have access to paint and paintbrushes is going

510
00:33:50.119 --> 00:33:56.680
to count, right? Um. Uh, THE, um, and so

511
00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.469
if we have a society that's organized in that

512
00:33:58.469 --> 00:34:02.079
way, and we have a society that, um, is

513
00:34:02.079 --> 00:34:05.439
organized in such a way that the flourishing of

514
00:34:05.439 --> 00:34:09.629
each is the condition of the flourishing of all,

515
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.639
right? Such that for me to insist upon what

516
00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:16.600
I need is also for me directly to insist

517
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.989
on something that you need as well. It seems

518
00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:22.748
to me we could talk about rights in that

519
00:34:22.748 --> 00:34:25.978
context, but I'm not sure what it would add,

520
00:34:26.248 --> 00:34:31.520
um, concretely speaking, um, And, uh, and so I,

521
00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:36.830
I argue that rights that will be abolished along

522
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.958
with lots of other lots of other stuff, right?

523
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:43.320
Um, AND, uh, but it's important to be, I

524
00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.870
think it's important to be very careful about this,

525
00:34:45.879 --> 00:34:48.239
and I engage in the in the rights chapter.

526
00:34:48.655 --> 00:34:52.603
I engage um with uh the work of another

527
00:34:52.603 --> 00:34:55.574
Marx scholar, Igor Scherke Brod, because I think that

528
00:34:55.853 --> 00:35:01.975
he very nicely, um, insists that Marxists should not

529
00:35:01.975 --> 00:35:07.780
be glib about rights in the present world. Um,

530
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.590
WHERE as we know, they are constantly being run

531
00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:16.270
over roughshod, and they do provide, um, a language

532
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:20.540
that people can use to defend themselves, and I

533
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.469
completely agree with him about this and think it

534
00:35:23.469 --> 00:35:26.229
is a very real danger and one that I

535
00:35:26.229 --> 00:35:29.370
would also be keen to avoid. Um, BUT I

536
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:32.699
disagree about the sort of the, the abstract question

537
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.449
about whether it would make sense to say that

538
00:35:35.449 --> 00:35:38.530
there's rights of this kind in a, in a

539
00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.239
communist, uh, future.

540
00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.969
Mhm. And I'm going to ask you a little

541
00:35:43.969 --> 00:35:49.370
bit more about that potential or possible communist future

542
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.639
in a second, but just before that, uh, Marx,

543
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:56.489
uh, famously seems to call for the abolition of

544
00:35:56.489 --> 00:36:02.159
morality altogether. So what would abolition be like in

545
00:36:02.169 --> 00:36:03.080
this context?

546
00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:07.370
Mhm. Yeah. So it goes, uh, it goes back

547
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:10.570
to, I think the first or second question you

548
00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:14.489
asked about ideology, because morality is a form of

549
00:36:14.489 --> 00:36:19.050
ideology, and ideology is a, a, a, a sort

550
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:24.370
of classed perspective on a class conflict. And so

551
00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:29.070
if what we're imagining is the abolition of class

552
00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:32.699
society and certainly of, of, of class conflict, obviously,

553
00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.959
um, Then, then the question arises, like, you know,

554
00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:42.060
where, where does morality go? And there's a, there's,

555
00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:44.040
there's a couple ways to think about this. I'm

556
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.110
gonna present two of them, right? So, so one

557
00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:52.260
is that, uh, I think it's useful to think

558
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:58.669
about morality as a way of theorizing a gap

559
00:36:59.159 --> 00:37:01.500
between the world as it is and the world

560
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.479
as it should be. And I use that formulation

561
00:37:05.479 --> 00:37:08.790
of on a few occasions throughout the book, but

562
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:12.360
keen obs you know, I keen observers with lots

563
00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.719
of time on their hands will notice that there's

564
00:37:14.719 --> 00:37:18.239
a footnote. Um, AT one point in the book,

565
00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.600
I think it is in the abolition of morality

566
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.979
chapter. Um, WHERE I say, well, of course, um,

567
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:29.500
this is a bit of a, um, heuristic way

568
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.540
of speaking, because, um, because actually the whole point

569
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.219
for Marx is, is not that there's a huge

570
00:37:36.219 --> 00:37:38.939
gap, but rather that the world that should be

571
00:37:39.229 --> 00:37:43.810
is already existing within the car. ONE, right? I

572
00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:48.179
precisely in the persons of the working class, right?

573
00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:52.659
Um, BUT, OK, that aside, right, you know, thinking

574
00:37:52.659 --> 00:37:55.659
about morality as, you know, how is it that

575
00:37:55.659 --> 00:38:00.699
things ought to be, but so far aren't. And

576
00:38:00.699 --> 00:38:03.510
so if we think about morality in that way,

577
00:38:04.379 --> 00:38:09.260
Then, um, morality goes this to this the same

578
00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.419
place where rights go, right? Um, HOW do you,

579
00:38:12.459 --> 00:38:16.360
what is the theory to analyze the world, the,

580
00:38:16.469 --> 00:38:18.179
the gap between the world as it is and

581
00:38:18.179 --> 00:38:19.889
the world as it should be when the world

582
00:38:19.889 --> 00:38:22.699
is actually made as it should be. Um, SO

583
00:38:22.699 --> 00:38:26.449
the sort of content, um, for uh moral theorizing

584
00:38:26.449 --> 00:38:29.939
to be about, um, is abolished, right? And so,

585
00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.010
and so therefore the, the sort of theoretical practice

586
00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:37.340
as well. Um, SO that's 11 way to talk

587
00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.419
about it, but I think, but the second way

588
00:38:40.419 --> 00:38:43.530
that I'll mention, and the one that I, uh,

589
00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.260
uh, I, I spell this out too, you know,

590
00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:53.850
in that chapter, um. Is that Marx uses this

591
00:38:54.399 --> 00:38:58.479
throughout his writings, he comes back to the idea

592
00:38:58.479 --> 00:39:03.840
that our human senses are themselves historical products. So

593
00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.199
again, coming back to human existence as a human

594
00:39:07.199 --> 00:39:11.639
product. He, um, so our sense of, of, of

595
00:39:11.639 --> 00:39:15.399
hearing, right? The difference between hearing just like a

596
00:39:15.399 --> 00:39:21.939
god awful clang and hearing. Experimental music, um, it's

597
00:39:21.939 --> 00:39:26.020
mostly exposure, uh, and, and maybe a little theory,

598
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.899
maybe somebody explained something to you, but you, but

599
00:39:28.899 --> 00:39:32.659
it's not biological, it's not physiological, you have the

600
00:39:32.659 --> 00:39:36.860
same ear. Um, AND Marx uses a a a

601
00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.139
number of uh examples like this throughout his writing

602
00:39:40.139 --> 00:39:42.260
and he, and he also uses it to talk

603
00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:46.429
about the, the eye, um. And ways of seeing,

604
00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.600
right? And, and, and how that that changes, right?

605
00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:53.070
Our ability to see and to interpret the world,

606
00:39:53.159 --> 00:39:56.229
um, uh, not through any physiological change, through a,

607
00:39:56.239 --> 00:40:01.479
uh, educational and cultural one. And I think something

608
00:40:01.479 --> 00:40:04.320
like this is what he has in mind for

609
00:40:04.639 --> 00:40:10.439
human beings. He actually talks about, uh, sight, he

610
00:40:10.439 --> 00:40:16.090
talks about transformations in sight and hearing and Uh,

611
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:20.260
smell, and then he talks about a human sense.

612
00:40:20.629 --> 00:40:22.669
And so I unpack what is, what is the

613
00:40:22.669 --> 00:40:27.550
human sense and The human sense for Marx is,

614
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.320
um, for one thing, it's precisely the thing that

615
00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:35.840
he thinks is conspicuously missing in utilitarianism, not to

616
00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.239
beat up on the utilitarianism, right, but it's the

617
00:40:38.239 --> 00:40:42.760
thing he thinks is conspicuously missing there because, um,

618
00:40:42.949 --> 00:40:44.719
and it and it and and that also is

619
00:40:44.719 --> 00:40:53.919
broadly speaking, conspicuously missing in the In the apperceptive

620
00:40:53.919 --> 00:40:59.800
capacities of a species whose life is dominated by

621
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:05.570
commodity exchange, is dominated by the um the making

622
00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:14.959
the making totally universally interchangeable of all things, so

623
00:41:14.959 --> 00:41:20.560
that we see things and we think, how much

624
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.429
can I get for that? Right, we, there's a

625
00:41:24.429 --> 00:41:33.449
sort of like instant translation into abstract quantitative accumulation

626
00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:40.929
of value, of just abstract value. Um This is,

627
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:44.689
this is something that Marx thinks absolutely has to

628
00:41:44.689 --> 00:41:49.689
be healed and overcome, uh, that part of the

629
00:41:49.689 --> 00:41:55.370
transformation that human beings must affect in themselves in

630
00:41:55.370 --> 00:42:00.840
order for communism to be possible, is to apprehend

631
00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:05.290
the world around them and see it, uh, see

632
00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:08.199
it for what it is, see it in itself,

633
00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:10.979
um. I mean this even this is this is

634
00:42:10.979 --> 00:42:13.020
something he talked, this is something that comes up

635
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:17.949
throughout capital, but even. Very early on in things

636
00:42:17.949 --> 00:42:20.479
like the the Power of Money, one of the

637
00:42:20.479 --> 00:42:25.189
1844 manuscripts, where Marx is writing about how money

638
00:42:25.189 --> 00:42:28.629
sort of confounds all differences and turns everything into

639
00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:32.189
its opposite, and you can, um, uh, you can

640
00:42:32.189 --> 00:42:35.229
and, and he says the the, uh, the, the

641
00:42:35.229 --> 00:42:37.375
what It would be for this to no longer

642
00:42:37.375 --> 00:42:40.675
be the case, um, would mean, for example, that

643
00:42:40.675 --> 00:42:43.054
if you want to be loved, uh, you couldn't

644
00:42:43.054 --> 00:42:45.975
just shell out cash for it. You would, you

645
00:42:45.975 --> 00:42:48.774
have to be lovable. And if you're not lovable,

646
00:42:48.864 --> 00:42:50.955
I don't know, you know, like, but, you know,

647
00:42:51.054 --> 00:42:54.564
there's this, there's this, this sort of, um, this,

648
00:42:54.814 --> 00:43:00.629
this distinction in marks between The ways that um

649
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:06.429
the ways that universal commodity exchange is also the

650
00:43:06.659 --> 00:43:12.360
universal emptying out of difference, um, and of specificity

651
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:16.014
and unique. And, and I think part of what's

652
00:43:16.014 --> 00:43:17.925
going on for Marx is that he thinks if

653
00:43:17.925 --> 00:43:21.125
we can fix that, if you can actually see

654
00:43:21.125 --> 00:43:24.804
a human being, not in, not in an alienated

655
00:43:24.804 --> 00:43:26.895
way where you see a human being and all

656
00:43:26.895 --> 00:43:29.094
you see is a means to an end, and

657
00:43:29.094 --> 00:43:31.215
here you can hear why people think maybe Conti

658
00:43:31.215 --> 00:43:32.975
and ethics will work with this, because there is

659
00:43:32.975 --> 00:43:35.610
some affinity. Um, BUT if you can look at

660
00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.570
a human being and rather than seeing a means

661
00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:41.489
to your private end, you see instead, like, a

662
00:43:41.489 --> 00:43:46.250
being with needs, who is your, your sibling, right?

663
00:43:46.409 --> 00:43:50.189
Who is like, who is you, um, and, um,

664
00:43:50.209 --> 00:43:53.739
and who has, uh, conditions of well-being and of

665
00:43:53.739 --> 00:43:57.250
flourishing that are also yours and that you have

666
00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:01.000
a direct interest in promoting. You know, I think

667
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.800
that's what Mark sees as replacing, you know, our

668
00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:09.560
kind of ham-fisted attempts now. Like, it's good that

669
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:13.399
we do them, but we're reduced to these ham-fisted

670
00:44:13.399 --> 00:44:16.919
attempts to ask ourselves, well, if I were a

671
00:44:16.919 --> 00:44:19.590
good person, what would I do then? You know,

672
00:44:19.679 --> 00:44:23.080
like, if I, if I, um, if I I

673
00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.760
think if I did really understand that other human

674
00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:30.280
beings exist and are and have their own, you

675
00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.800
know, their own like conditions of well-being, and there

676
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.280
are things they're doing that matter to them. Well,

677
00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.719
how would I behave then? And, and so I

678
00:44:37.719 --> 00:44:40.590
think Marx is asking is, is, you know, for

679
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:44.350
ethics, as is so often the case with Marx,

680
00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:50.649
the dis is in painting a, uh, a trail,

681
00:44:50.919 --> 00:44:54.360
you know, a kind of a path forward where

682
00:44:54.360 --> 00:45:00.310
that world that we represent in thought as desirable

683
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:04.949
is not just a kind of mere ethical ideal,

684
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.270
but is something that we could actually bring about.

685
00:45:09.149 --> 00:45:09.790
Mhm.

686
00:45:10.389 --> 00:45:13.979
So keeping in mind then that according to Marx,

687
00:45:13.989 --> 00:45:17.939
at least, ethics would be abolished in a fully

688
00:45:17.939 --> 00:45:21.350
developed communist society and it would be sort of

689
00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:26.899
just a transitory historical phenomenon. Um, WHAT would it

690
00:45:26.899 --> 00:45:31.469
be like to exist and uh socially interact in

691
00:45:31.469 --> 00:45:32.790
such a society?

692
00:45:33.879 --> 00:45:37.500
Oh, yeah, great question. I don't think I know.

693
00:45:37.699 --> 00:45:39.780
I mean, I, you know, I think, I mean,

694
00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.790
some of what I've already said suggests some things

695
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:45.419
about what it would be like, but I, I

696
00:45:45.419 --> 00:45:48.810
think I'm, I think what I'm noticing within myself

697
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:51.360
as I attempt to answer your question, is that

698
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:57.709
I'm hesitant to, um, I, I'm hesitant to Uh,

699
00:45:57.959 --> 00:46:00.449
sort of, you know, make recipes for the cookshops

700
00:46:00.449 --> 00:46:02.560
of the future, to coin a phrase, you know

701
00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.629
what I mean? LIKE. Um, I mean, I think

702
00:46:06.719 --> 00:46:08.719
we are, I mean, I think some of the

703
00:46:08.719 --> 00:46:14.179
places that we can look for hints is in

704
00:46:14.479 --> 00:46:19.469
what we already experience as some of the more

705
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:26.979
prosocial forms of interaction. That we somehow miraculously managed

706
00:46:26.979 --> 00:46:32.209
to pull off even in today, you know, um,

707
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.899
and so, um, like I'll like I'll give you

708
00:46:34.899 --> 00:46:39.979
an example, like I've When I've, um, I don't

709
00:46:39.979 --> 00:46:42.540
have this anymore so much, but back in the

710
00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.739
day when I was starting to teach undergrads, um,

711
00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.929
I would, uh, you know, the students all would,

712
00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.419
when if marks would come up, you know, the

713
00:46:51.419 --> 00:46:54.739
students would always, um, say, well, but people are

714
00:46:54.739 --> 00:46:58.155
just selfish. And, you know, nobody does anything unless

715
00:46:58.155 --> 00:47:00.945
there's something in it for them. And, um, and,

716
00:47:01.034 --> 00:47:04.155
and so on. And so, I remember one exchange

717
00:47:04.155 --> 00:47:07.635
where a student expressed something of that nature. And

718
00:47:07.635 --> 00:47:10.395
then I, I asked her if she did any

719
00:47:10.395 --> 00:47:14.590
volunteering. And she said, yeah. She's like, what does

720
00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:15.669
that have to do with Ada? But she says,

721
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:18.030
Yeah, I do, you know. And I'm like, well,

722
00:47:18.149 --> 00:47:20.270
tell me about it. You know, I'm curious. And

723
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:22.389
she says, Well, you know, a couple days after

724
00:47:22.389 --> 00:47:24.949
her face lights up, right? And she says, Well,

725
00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:26.989
you know, a couple days after school, I go

726
00:47:26.989 --> 00:47:29.429
to this elementary school, that's just a couple of

727
00:47:29.429 --> 00:47:32.310
blocks away from campus. And I, I read to

728
00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:35.580
the kids and I, I help them to improve

729
00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:38.260
their literacy skills. And I'm like, well, you know,

730
00:47:38.379 --> 00:47:40.469
what do you enjoy about doing that? And she's

731
00:47:40.469 --> 00:47:42.459
like, Oh, you know, it's just great to be

732
00:47:42.459 --> 00:47:44.919
with them and I'm helping, and I can see

733
00:47:44.919 --> 00:47:47.620
them grow. And, you know, it's just a really,

734
00:47:47.659 --> 00:47:50.050
it's just something that's really wonderful to do. And,

735
00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:51.610
and I'm like, do you get paid for it?

736
00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:54.020
And she says, No, no. It's, it's completely volunteer.

737
00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.409
And I'm like, You know, it turns out that

738
00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:01.949
people like, even, even in a world where every

739
00:48:01.949 --> 00:48:05.379
minute that you spend helping another person for free

740
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:08.110
is in fact taking the food out of your

741
00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:11.510
own mouth, because that's those are the perverse incentives

742
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:17.050
under which we exist. Um, PEOPLE crave to Help.

743
00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:20.159
They crave to be together. I mean, I think

744
00:48:20.159 --> 00:48:22.850
this is even, I mean, there's lots of terrible

745
00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:27.689
lessons to take from, uh, COVID-19 and the pandemic

746
00:48:27.689 --> 00:48:31.370
and lockdown and the sort of reactionary and irrational

747
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:34.649
ways that people have responded to it. But in

748
00:48:34.649 --> 00:48:38.070
my most generous moods, you know, When I think

749
00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:41.350
about the, uh, you know, some of the, some

750
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:44.989
of the, uh, hostility that people had to social

751
00:48:44.989 --> 00:48:48.100
distancing and to staying at home, whatever, you know,

752
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:51.199
when I'm feeling my most generous, I think, well,

753
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:54.149
you know, people want to be together. They really

754
00:48:54.149 --> 00:48:56.310
want to be together. They want to be with

755
00:48:56.310 --> 00:49:00.530
one another. Um, OK, you know, like they should

756
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:02.919
wear a mask while doing it, you know, but,

757
00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.449
um, but I, I just think there's, um, there's

758
00:49:06.449 --> 00:49:12.370
things that we see, you know, even under the

759
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:16.530
conditions in which we live now, that just make

760
00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:20.899
it clear that there's really good reason. To think

761
00:49:20.979 --> 00:49:25.340
that if we could remove some of the barriers

762
00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:29.139
to that, that what we would find is a

763
00:49:29.139 --> 00:49:37.320
lot of loving, prosocial, collaborative, um, creative activity, right?

764
00:49:37.439 --> 00:49:39.820
And, and ways of, of, of being among one

765
00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:44.084
another. Um I can't guarantee that to anyone, you

766
00:49:44.084 --> 00:49:46.284
know? And I, and I, and, and also the

767
00:49:46.284 --> 00:49:49.955
people of this kind of future society, like would

768
00:49:49.955 --> 00:49:52.554
it, it, it, by the very nature of the

769
00:49:52.554 --> 00:49:57.354
case, would be a people formed by a whole

770
00:49:57.354 --> 00:50:00.205
history that hasn't happened yet, right? So it's, it's

771
00:50:00.205 --> 00:50:02.564
difficult to say exactly what life would look like

772
00:50:02.564 --> 00:50:04.760
for them. But I think there's things about what

773
00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.560
life looks like for us that give a lot

774
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:11.300
of good reason for hope, you know, people already

775
00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.659
engage in all kinds of activity where the aim

776
00:50:13.659 --> 00:50:17.679
is to, um, is to be good to to

777
00:50:17.679 --> 00:50:20.360
their fellow human beings. Mhm.

778
00:50:20.679 --> 00:50:23.560
Uh, I have two more questions then. The first

779
00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.290
one going back for a second to the topic

780
00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:30.639
of bourgeois ethics or the ethics or ethical values

781
00:50:30.639 --> 00:50:36.800
of the capitalist class. Um, THIS neoliberal capitalism or

782
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.199
has it even delivered on its promise of uh

783
00:50:41.199 --> 00:50:44.600
freedom, which is something we haven't really uh touched

784
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:50.120
on, uh, human rights and the other values associated

785
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:50.550
with it.

786
00:50:51.659 --> 00:50:54.040
So you won't be surprised to hear that I

787
00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:59.080
think the answer is a resounding no. Um, AND,

788
00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:04.800
um, I mean, I, I Yeah, I'm sort of

789
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.429
tough. I'm just like, no, uh, no, it, it

790
00:51:07.429 --> 00:51:09.189
hasn't, you know, and I, I think, you know,

791
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:12.669
of the proof is in the pudding. We're at

792
00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:16.429
a point today where, where people can look back

793
00:51:16.429 --> 00:51:20.389
and, and see that what has, what has occurred

794
00:51:20.389 --> 00:51:23.629
over the last, you know, let's say 50 years

795
00:51:23.629 --> 00:51:29.409
of neoliberal reaction and attacks on Um, any, any

796
00:51:29.409 --> 00:51:33.570
influence that working class movements have had, uh, in,

797
00:51:33.659 --> 00:51:37.840
in society and, and, and actually expanding freedom and,

798
00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:41.330
and it whether it's, um, Uh, you know, the

799
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:45.409
student movements of the 1960s globally, whether it's uh

800
00:51:45.409 --> 00:51:49.169
decolonial movements globally, um, well, you know, in the

801
00:51:49.169 --> 00:51:50.850
US I'm here in the US, so in the

802
00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:53.409
US case, things like the civil rights movement, the

803
00:51:53.409 --> 00:51:56.370
queer rights movement, women's movement, and so on, you

804
00:51:56.370 --> 00:52:00.239
know, all of the ways that neoliberalism. Has been

805
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:05.629
a, you know, roughly half century long onslaught against

806
00:52:05.629 --> 00:52:09.469
all of that. Uh, WE can see now that

807
00:52:09.469 --> 00:52:16.790
the result is, um, just just reaction and loss

808
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:19.510
of freedom. I mean, even if, even if we

809
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:23.373
think of freedom in a Very, like, rudimentary way

810
00:52:23.603 --> 00:52:26.562
in terms of just the, the, the, the resources

811
00:52:26.562 --> 00:52:28.603
that people have to be able to do what

812
00:52:28.603 --> 00:52:32.113
they want. People make less money. You know, like,

813
00:52:32.202 --> 00:52:34.762
just like in the most like basic sense, you

814
00:52:34.762 --> 00:52:39.873
know, not to mention the assaults on, uh, intellectual,

815
00:52:40.022 --> 00:52:43.335
um, freedom that we have. uh, YOU know, all

816
00:52:43.335 --> 00:52:45.976
over the world and of course, quite famously like

817
00:52:45.976 --> 00:52:48.456
in the US there's these, you know, with um

818
00:52:48.456 --> 00:52:51.006
the attacks on universities that are going on here,

819
00:52:51.095 --> 00:52:52.795
but of course, you see it also, you know,

820
00:52:53.055 --> 00:52:55.325
it's been, uh, it's been uh underway for a

821
00:52:55.325 --> 00:52:58.456
long time in places like Hungary, for example, you

822
00:52:58.456 --> 00:53:01.535
know, sort of way further down that road that

823
00:53:01.535 --> 00:53:04.459
we seem to be headed down now here. Um,

824
00:53:04.699 --> 00:53:06.860
uh, YOU know, I, it, it's, uh, but, you

825
00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.510
know, it, it, it has, however, it must be

826
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:14.239
sad, um, also promoted a lot of freedom for

827
00:53:14.239 --> 00:53:17.620
capitalists, right? You know, and that kind of goes

828
00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:22.820
to, again, Marx's critique of bourgeois rights and bourgeois

829
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:27.199
individuality, and in this case, bourgeois freedom, um, because

830
00:53:27.879 --> 00:53:31.850
The freedom of capital to move around the planet,

831
00:53:31.889 --> 00:53:35.469
neoliberalism has done a great job of advancing that.

832
00:53:35.719 --> 00:53:39.429
Um, THE, the freedom of capitalists to do what

833
00:53:39.429 --> 00:53:44.639
they want without any fetter placed on them whatsoever

834
00:53:44.639 --> 00:53:50.000
by law or by the demands of uh the

835
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000
masses of society. Neoliberalism has done a great job

836
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.010
of establishing that. So, um, but, you know, but

837
00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:59.280
that's why we need a critique of the concept

838
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:01.649
of freedom, right? And who's, and who's and what

839
00:54:01.649 --> 00:54:05.129
kinds of freedom are, are being promoted and which

840
00:54:05.129 --> 00:54:08.560
are, are, um, you know, highly damaged.

841
00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:13.129
Mhm. So, my last question then, and going back

842
00:54:13.129 --> 00:54:16.659
to the idea of human existence itself as a

843
00:54:16.659 --> 00:54:21.820
human product, uh, should intellectuals, I mean, academics and

844
00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:25.860
other kinds of intellectuals also contribute in some way

845
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.739
to these human product?

846
00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:32.209
Um, WELL, I think we are, right? I mean,

847
00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:35.530
so part part of the, part of, uh, the

848
00:54:35.969 --> 00:54:39.260
implication of that is that we always already are,

849
00:54:39.489 --> 00:54:44.479
and then, so then the question is, um, Do

850
00:54:44.479 --> 00:54:46.760
we, do we have an uh a kind of

851
00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:52.639
obligation of some kind to contribute positively, uh, rather

852
00:54:52.639 --> 00:54:56.669
than not, and Uh, you know, I, I say

853
00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:02.830
yes, a resounding yes, yes, yes, um. It's Oh

854
00:55:04.219 --> 00:55:06.620
I, I can't, I can't imagine, it's hard for

855
00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:10.360
me to imagine doing anything else with the fact

856
00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:15.409
that, you know, I've had the opportunity to learn,

857
00:55:15.739 --> 00:55:19.030
um, quite a lot. I have the opportunity to

858
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:23.939
study. I have the opportunity to write, um, and

859
00:55:23.939 --> 00:55:27.679
to let my views be known. Um, AND it's,

860
00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.889
uh, it's hard for me to think of another

861
00:55:30.889 --> 00:55:34.810
worthwhile purpose, um, other than to put all of

862
00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:38.570
that to the service of humanity, of, of human

863
00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:43.959
beings, um. And so I think, I think absolutely

864
00:55:43.959 --> 00:55:45.679
that that, you know, and it doesn't, and I'm

865
00:55:45.679 --> 00:55:48.989
not saying it always has to be a narrow,

866
00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:51.600
uh, it doesn't have to be narrowly construed, you

867
00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:54.959
know, not, I'm not saying every academic needs to

868
00:55:54.959 --> 00:55:59.919
drop everything and work, uh, self-consciously for revolution or

869
00:55:59.919 --> 00:56:02.800
something, although that would be great. Um, BUT, you

870
00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.639
know, but I think there's there's all kinds of

871
00:56:04.639 --> 00:56:08.760
work that people, people do that, um, that helps

872
00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:16.629
to Helps to demonstrate the incredible potential of human

873
00:56:16.629 --> 00:56:19.669
beings. Um, AND, uh, you know, I think we

874
00:56:19.669 --> 00:56:23.389
see it, for example, um, in the attacks on

875
00:56:23.389 --> 00:56:27.110
science, um, in the US, which I think is

876
00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:31.739
highly uh tied to the attacks on trans people

877
00:56:31.949 --> 00:56:33.709
as well, but and, and both of these are

878
00:56:33.709 --> 00:56:38.659
also global phenomena. Um, BUT, uh, you know, the,

879
00:56:38.679 --> 00:56:44.010
the like when trans people use the, um, the,

880
00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:48.280
the, the knowledge and the tools developed by science

881
00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:53.790
to improve their lives, to, to go from feeling

882
00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.639
um unable to show up in the world in

883
00:56:56.639 --> 00:57:00.270
a way that, that, that matches their identity and

884
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:04.239
that is affirming of who they are as individual

885
00:57:04.239 --> 00:57:07.919
people. Um, THEY, what part, I mean, one of

886
00:57:07.919 --> 00:57:10.780
the things that they're demonstrating is that there can

887
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:15.060
be better living through science, right? That, that, that

888
00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.729
having knowledge of the world and having the ability

889
00:57:17.729 --> 00:57:20.739
to manipulate it, you know, can put us in

890
00:57:20.739 --> 00:57:24.300
charge of what we are and how we show

891
00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:30.520
up. And that is a dangerous proposition. Uh, WHEN

892
00:57:30.689 --> 00:57:35.729
you are promoting a, uh, a, a reactionary right

893
00:57:35.729 --> 00:57:43.139
wing perspective that absolutely requires, uh, lowering expectations and

894
00:57:43.139 --> 00:57:46.929
convincing people that, you know, Margaret Thatcher style, there

895
00:57:46.929 --> 00:57:50.489
is no alternative. The world you live in and

896
00:57:50.489 --> 00:57:53.010
the way you exist in it is the, that's

897
00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:55.879
it. This is it, you know, there's no changing

898
00:57:55.879 --> 00:57:58.840
it, um, and so, uh, you know, I think

899
00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:02.159
there's lots of science that people do that of

900
00:58:02.159 --> 00:58:05.570
course is not in any way directly tied to

901
00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:10.600
uh a political project, but that is about how

902
00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:14.560
can human beings intervene into the world in such

903
00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.709
a way as to make our lives better. Um,

904
00:58:17.909 --> 00:58:20.010
AND I think, I, I mean, I think all

905
00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:23.070
of, all of that is important and necessary, and

906
00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:26.590
yes, I do think there's an obligation to think

907
00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:29.320
through in some way, you know, how it is

908
00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:33.189
that your work helps to promote human well-being.

909
00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.860
Mm. By the way, since you mentioned trans people,

910
00:58:36.949 --> 00:58:39.870
I can't resist asking you this question, which will

911
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:43.070
be then the last one. Do you think that

912
00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:47.550
Marx himself would be open to and that Marxism

913
00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:54.030
easily accommodates for an intersectional perspective on things like

914
00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:58.790
going beyond class and also including other social categories

915
00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:00.620
like race and gender?

916
00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:04.169
Yeah, so in my, so, so, uh, I'll answer

917
00:59:04.169 --> 00:59:07.919
those questions separately cause I think Marx himself, um,

918
00:59:07.929 --> 00:59:14.679
is there's this, uh, there's this kind of often

919
00:59:14.679 --> 00:59:20.120
held view of Marx, that he didn't think about

920
00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:24.000
race or he didn't think about gender. Um, BUT

921
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.750
Marx actually wrote, uh, you know, not infrequently about

922
00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:33.520
about both of these issues. Um, HE, uh, uh

923
00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.889
wrote. Uh, HE would write articles for uh US

924
00:59:36.889 --> 00:59:40.320
newspapers, uh, I mean, I remember Marx was living

925
00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.560
at the time of the US Civil War, um,

926
00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.489
and so he wrote like an open letter to

927
00:59:46.489 --> 00:59:50.429
Abraham Lincoln. He wrote an open letter to white

928
00:59:50.429 --> 00:59:54.010
workers in the United States telling them that labor

929
00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:56.439
in the white skin cannot be free so long

930
00:59:56.439 --> 00:59:59.989
as in the black it's branded. Um, HE and,

931
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.689
uh, and Engels, you know, thought a lot about

932
01:00:02.689 --> 01:00:05.870
the case of workers in Ireland who were often

933
01:00:06.139 --> 01:00:09.979
made subject to a kind of racialized oppression, right,

934
01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:14.699
and exclusion. Um, AND, um, there's a, um, I

935
01:00:14.699 --> 01:00:17.060
mean, there's, there's, uh, a, a decent amount of

936
01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.699
good work on this one book in particular is

937
01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:22.360
like Kevin B. Anderson's Marks at the Margins, which

938
01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:26.659
actually is just about these, uh, kinds of questions.

939
01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:30.270
Um, Marx and Engels, you know, including in even

940
01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:34.750
in the communist manifesto itself, but also elsewhere, they,

941
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:38.310
they talk about the situation of women, they talk

942
01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:41.629
about um the uh the nature of the, the

943
01:00:41.629 --> 01:00:46.810
nuclear family and how it also um Oppresses children,

944
01:00:46.899 --> 01:00:51.419
right? It makes children uh sort of abjectly um

945
01:00:51.419 --> 01:00:55.649
subject to the whims of their parents, uh, which,

946
01:00:56.139 --> 01:00:58.860
uh, can, you know, be a bad thing if

947
01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:03.090
the parents are abusive, right? Um. Uh, YOU know,

948
01:01:03.169 --> 01:01:05.250
they, they thought oh quite a they they thought

949
01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:08.429
quite a lot about these things, and Uh, you

950
01:01:08.429 --> 01:01:11.379
know, they, they, they wrote that, um, you could,

951
01:01:11.669 --> 01:01:15.949
you could tell the level of alienation in a

952
01:01:15.949 --> 01:01:19.030
society by looking at how women are treated in

953
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:23.159
the society. Um, BECAUSE women, after all, are people.

954
01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.000
And so if women are being treated, uh, in

955
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.439
a way that subordinates and dehumanizes them, that's a,

956
01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.760
that's, that tells you something about, you know, how

957
01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.149
degraded the society is in terms of its ability

958
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.719
to, uh, to apprehend the, um, the, the significance

959
01:01:42.719 --> 01:01:44.840
of what it is to come to, to, to

960
01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.169
be in the presence of another human being. Um,

961
01:01:48.379 --> 01:01:50.939
SO I, I think both in, in, in, in

962
01:01:50.939 --> 01:01:53.219
Marx's work and in, in his work with Engels

963
01:01:53.219 --> 01:01:56.639
and Um, but also, you know, the Marxist tradition

964
01:01:56.639 --> 01:02:00.429
more broadly. Um, ONE of the things that I,

965
01:02:00.719 --> 01:02:04.120
uh, say as often as anybody will, will, will

966
01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.080
hear me say it is that the idea that

967
01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:13.429
Marxism is white or that Marxism is male, it,

968
01:02:13.439 --> 01:02:21.189
it's, it's difficult to Maintain that belief, unless you

969
01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:27.189
discount a lot of Marxists who have written and

970
01:02:27.189 --> 01:02:32.169
struggled and were not white and were not male.

971
01:02:32.485 --> 01:02:37.324
And probably in terms of sheer numbers, I would,

972
01:02:37.445 --> 01:02:39.975
I haven't counted, but I would venture to guess

973
01:02:39.975 --> 01:02:43.885
that the absolute majority of people who have ever

974
01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:48.985
identified as Marxists and seen themselves as liberating, um,

975
01:02:49.044 --> 01:02:51.685
as being part of a Marxist liberation struggle, probably

976
01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:55.405
were not white, right? And so it's some of

977
01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:57.495
it is a, uh, I think, a kind of,

978
01:02:57.504 --> 01:03:02.030
um, Myopia, right? And, uh, and uh, uh, of,

979
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:05.169
uh uh refusal or at least, I don't know,

980
01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:10.090
incapacity or neglect at least to, to think globally

981
01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:13.209
about the impact of Marx's ideas and who has

982
01:03:13.209 --> 01:03:15.919
taken them up. Um, AND in my own work,

983
01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:19.639
I, I, I, I bring these things together. Um,

984
01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:22.639
I have a, uh, uh, a few years before,

985
01:03:22.729 --> 01:03:25.290
um, I published my book. I have, uh, an

986
01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:28.459
article. Um, CALLED What could it mean to say

987
01:03:28.459 --> 01:03:32.060
Capitalism causes sexism and racism, and one of the

988
01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:35.419
things that I take up there is that Um,

989
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.679
Marx is not a class reductionist view, and the

990
01:03:40.679 --> 01:03:43.840
reason that class matters the way it does for

991
01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:47.399
Marx is that his emphasis is on production, on

992
01:03:47.399 --> 01:03:49.719
how it is that human beings are producing their

993
01:03:49.719 --> 01:03:54.120
circumstances, and it so happens in a class society

994
01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:57.199
that production is organized according to class, and that's

995
01:03:57.199 --> 01:04:02.020
why it matters. Um. But that doesn't uh mean

996
01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:05.739
that uh we don't attend to all the other

997
01:04:05.739 --> 01:04:10.969
things that human beings produce through through class, um,

998
01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:14.290
and in ways that are shaped by class, which

999
01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:18.449
includes racism and sexism, and, you know, all the,

1000
01:04:18.459 --> 01:04:20.939
all the rest, you know, all the other um

1001
01:04:20.939 --> 01:04:23.100
transphobia and homophobia and so on.

1002
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:27.939
Mhm. Great. So, the book is again Marx's ethical

1003
01:04:27.939 --> 01:04:30.389
vision. Of course, I'm leaving a link to it

1004
01:04:30.389 --> 01:04:34.070
in the description of the interview. And Doctor Wills,

1005
01:04:34.149 --> 01:04:37.280
just before we go, apart from the book, would

1006
01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.830
you like to tell people where they can find

1007
01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:41.530
your work on the internet?

1008
01:04:41.909 --> 01:04:48.209
Certainly. So I have a website, it's vanessawills.com. And

1009
01:04:48.219 --> 01:04:51.939
sometimes I post on Twitter, um, or sorry, X.

1010
01:04:51.979 --> 01:04:56.280
So, and so my handle there is uh VC

1011
01:04:56.419 --> 01:05:00.459
W I L L S VCs. And those are

1012
01:05:00.459 --> 01:05:03.580
usually the best two places to um learn about

1013
01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:04.090
