00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:03.289
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.289 --> 00:00:06.289
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:09.569
today I'm joined for a 4th time by Doctor

4
00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:13.250
Kevin Mitchell. He's associate Professor of Genetics and neuroscience

5
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.969
at Trinity College Dublin. Last time we talked about

6
00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:20.049
his book Free Agents, our evolution gave us Free

7
00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:22.489
Will. And today we're going to talk a little

8
00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.379
bit more about free will and in the meantime,

9
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.489
Doctor Mitchell have a couple of debates with Doctor

10
00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.120
Robert Sapolsky. We're also going to talk a little

11
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.880
bit about that and also about his recent paper,

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.450
the genomic code, the genome instantiates a generative model

13
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.459
of the organism. And toward the end, a little

14
00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:47.459
bit about human embryo editing. So Doctor Mitchell, welcome

15
00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:49.060
to the show. It's a pleasure to have you

16
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.450
back.

17
00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.700
Thanks, Ricardo. Thanks for having me back. Always a

18
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.500
pleasure to chat.

19
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.110
OK, so I would like to ask you a

20
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.020
few questions that I left out in our previous

21
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.830
conversation about your book on free will. So, what

22
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.830
is the lowest level of analysis we have to

23
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.910
go down when it comes to biochemistry to understand

24
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.260
the evolution of free will and how it works?

25
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.639
Yeah, um, it's such an interesting question, and I've

26
00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:22.959
been, I've been hanging out with philosophers so much

27
00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.319
that I have this, uh, I have this trigger

28
00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:27.870
now to, to when someone asked me a question

29
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.360
to think, oh, where's that question coming from and

30
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.760
why is it phrased that way? And I think

31
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.389
what's interesting here is there's like there's this impulse

32
00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:38.739
when we look at um some complicated phenomenon. Like,

33
00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:42.760
uh, humans apparently having free will, where the phenomenon

34
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.800
is we see that we're, uh, making decisions. It

35
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.559
feels internally like we're thinking about things and deliberating

36
00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:53.470
and making choices and so on, right. So So

37
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.410
the question is like how could we account for

38
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.239
that? Um, AND there's a natural impulse, I think

39
00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:03.519
in in traditional sort of science to look down

40
00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:06.610
for the explanation, to say, OK, well, clearly your

41
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.770
mind is thinking about something you've got goals and

42
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.319
beliefs and so on. That are informing your decision,

43
00:02:12.858 --> 00:02:15.608
but actually that's just neural states, right? So we

44
00:02:15.608 --> 00:02:18.578
can look down a level, um, from cognition to

45
00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:20.369
the level of neuroscience and say, well, here, look,

46
00:02:20.408 --> 00:02:22.569
there's these patterns of neural states, and then we

47
00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.009
can go a little further and say, actually, you

48
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.009
know what, what's happening in the brain is really

49
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.569
these biochemical, um, triggers are, are, are moving around.

50
00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:32.289
We've got proteins moving in and out, ions moving

51
00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:36.328
in and out, um, and, you know, there's there's

52
00:02:36.328 --> 00:02:40.160
some sort of biochemical molecular goings on. And there's

53
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.600
a temptation, I think, to to think that's where

54
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.350
the true causal explanation lies. We go down, down,

55
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.600
down, and we see all these biochemical machinations, right,

56
00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.839
these mechanisms at play, and then we say, OK,

57
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.070
that's why you made a decision, because these ions

58
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.250
moved from here to there in these neurons and

59
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.440
these neurotransmitters were detected by those receptors and that's

60
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.910
it, we're done. And and so I, I, I

61
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.630
want to resist that impulse and I wanna say

62
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.509
actually for um a phenomenon like this of a

63
00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:17.309
whole organism doing complex context dependent behavior informed by

64
00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.029
its history, we have to look up, right? We

65
00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:21.949
have to look at the whole thing. We have

66
00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.059
to take a holistic view of it and say,

67
00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.350
um, OK, yeah, there's, of course, it depends on

68
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.470
all of this neural machinery, all this biochemistry. But

69
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.059
that it can't be reduced to that. Decision making

70
00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:37.339
is not just a bunch of ions moving around.

71
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.550
It's the sort of I guess uh manipulation of

72
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.710
meaningful patterns that that means something to the organism.

73
00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:50.470
Where there's a there's a cognitive economy that uh

74
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.190
depends on, on neural machinery, but it runs on

75
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.779
meaning. And that I think is, is um is

76
00:03:56.779 --> 00:04:00.580
really the crucial. Difference, I think that frees us

77
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.220
from this reductive idea where uh you know, it

78
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.529
doesn't it doesn't mean we're invoking some kind of

79
00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:11.660
magic, right? We can still see the machine needs

80
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.419
to be there and you know, from neurology and

81
00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.820
genetics we can see the differences in the way

82
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.738
the machine is put together affect things like decision

83
00:04:20.738 --> 00:04:23.260
making. So it's still very materialistic in that sense.

84
00:04:23.299 --> 00:04:27.100
It's just not um it's just not reductive. And

85
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.100
I guess the other aspect of your of your

86
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.119
question maybe was to think. In evolutionary terms, um,

87
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.279
how far back do we have to go to

88
00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:39.440
get a handle on things like purpose and meaning

89
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.820
and value, right? And that's where I think taking

90
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.320
a, um, a view of the simple biochemistry of

91
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.839
organisms, you know, like bacteria. I shouldn't say simple,

92
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.320
it's it's actually quite complex, but much simpler than

93
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.160
our um kind of cognitive systems. Like how can

94
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.350
we get a handle on something like purpose? Uh,

95
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.869
IN an, again, in a non-magical, non-mystical kind of

96
00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:06.100
a way, by thinking about what bacteria are doing.

97
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.109
And you know, this basically the drive to survive

98
00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:13.869
any complex system like that is is uh can

99
00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:17.790
be configured in ways that favor its persistence or

100
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.790
that don't, right? And the ones that the configurations

101
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.989
that do favor uh persistence persist, and those are

102
00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:25.790
the ones that we see and of course they

103
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.700
have adaptations to keep favoring their persistence and doing

104
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.109
that work. And you know, in bacteria that's done

105
00:05:32.109 --> 00:05:37.869
with biochemical systems. Uh, WHEN, when multicellular organisms arose,

106
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:41.790
they had to kind of reinvent the systems to

107
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.429
um figure out what's out in the world and,

108
00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:47.910
and, um, and mount appropriate adaptive responses to it.

109
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:56.190
But do you classify single-celled organisms like bacteria as

110
00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.549
agents and when exactly in evolution does agency really

111
00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:02.820
come into play?

112
00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:05.940
Yeah, my, so my feeling and I'm not a

113
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.820
um I don't like to try and draw, you

114
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.899
know, bright lines, but my feeling is that actually

115
00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:15.140
agency is pretty much coextensive with life as we

116
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.500
know it. That is that even single-celled organisms like

117
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.570
bacteria have some kind of at least a proto

118
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:27.709
agency in the sense that um, They're, they're controlling

119
00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:30.859
their behavior in a holistic integrative kind of a

120
00:06:30.859 --> 00:06:34.000
way, you know, they're they're not just passive stimulus

121
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.609
response machines, they're endogenously active and they're accommodating to

122
00:06:38.609 --> 00:06:41.690
new information, but they're integrating multiple sources of information

123
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.040
at a time. Uh, INTEGRATING it with respect to

124
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.589
their recent history, with respect to their internal states,

125
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.559
with respect to the, uh, the external context, and

126
00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:55.839
all in the service of agent level reasons, right?

127
00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:58.589
So their their parts don't have reasons for doing

128
00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:02.720
anything, but the whole organism does in you could

129
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.720
say they're as if reasons, right? They're just evolution's

130
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.149
reasons. Um, BUT I think the effect is the

131
00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:12.750
same. We get a goal directed behavior, it's directed

132
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.190
towards whatever favors persistence, that may be going towards

133
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.660
a food source, it may be going away from,

134
00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:22.709
uh, toxic chemicals or or something that could eat

135
00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:25.589
it, right? Um, YOU know, so, so those kinds

136
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:27.869
of things are all active and I think that's

137
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:32.190
perfectly reasonable to think of bacteria, uh, in agential

138
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.190
terms. Now it's not very sophisticated, right? There aren't

139
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.920
there aren't. There aren't many levels of behavioral control

140
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.119
that it's engaged in. But it is still very

141
00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:48.170
much a holistic. Organismal kind of activity as opposed

142
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.290
to pure, purely just uh just mechanism.

143
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.489
And when we talk about organisms which already have

144
00:07:56.489 --> 00:08:01.540
a nervous system, is there anything at the neuronal

145
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:07.239
level or the neural uh molecular machinery that is

146
00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:11.135
important to consider, to under Stand free will. I

147
00:08:11.135 --> 00:08:19.415
mean, something about synapses, neurotransmitters, uh, membrane receptors, something

148
00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:24.174
like that, that is important to understand where free

149
00:08:24.174 --> 00:08:27.285
will, uh, comes from molecularly.

150
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.540
I guess I'd say two things there. Um, FIRST

151
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.780
of all, it's important to understand how noisy that

152
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.210
all is, right? You know, how, how, um, just

153
00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:40.489
messy and jittery and jiggly all of this, the,

154
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.500
the molecular machinery is down there. I mean, you've

155
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.419
got individual molecules that are jittering around, there's all

156
00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:49.890
kinds of thermal fluctuations. They're being bombarded by collisions,

157
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.419
maybe like billions of times a second. Every molecule

158
00:08:53.419 --> 00:08:55.619
is just being hit by other molecules billions of

159
00:08:55.619 --> 00:08:59.229
times a second. So you've got this big noisy

160
00:08:59.229 --> 00:09:03.830
maelstrom of stuff down there and it's amazing that

161
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.429
there's any functionality at all, right? It's incredible that

162
00:09:07.429 --> 00:09:12.369
actually evolution has crafted these systems that are generally

163
00:09:12.369 --> 00:09:14.989
speaking robust to that noise. They can still do

164
00:09:14.989 --> 00:09:18.909
things effectively at a slightly higher sort of microscopic

165
00:09:18.909 --> 00:09:22.270
systems level. Just because of the the way that

166
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:27.140
they that that that evolution has configured them. Um,

167
00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:31.219
IN a way that the microscopic organization allows things

168
00:09:31.219 --> 00:09:35.140
to happen, right? And so, but that's really the

169
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.440
key. It's and it it gets us away from

170
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.419
the idea that everything at the low level is

171
00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:42.260
really deterministic and all the causes are coming bottom

172
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.510
up because actually it's just there's a load of

173
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.530
random stuff happening down there, that has to be

174
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.059
harnessed in a sense, at a slightly higher microscopic

175
00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:56.150
level for anything useful to happen. And that is

176
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.789
a kind of a key aspect to understanding how

177
00:10:00.719 --> 00:10:03.219
Free will can emerge because free will is just

178
00:10:03.219 --> 00:10:06.460
a this uh it's a type of microscopic causation,

179
00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:09.140
and it's a type of top-down causation and and

180
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.179
some people hear that, they hear top-down causation and

181
00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:15.380
they think it's some mystical thing that sort of

182
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.820
uh violates the tenets or principles of materialism, and

183
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.859
it doesn't. It's just saying that the way a

184
00:10:21.859 --> 00:10:25.719
system is organized. CAN have some causal effects on

185
00:10:25.719 --> 00:10:30.140
what happens. And it's a move away from Um,

186
00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:34.090
thinking only in terms of what we can call

187
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.210
production causes, the sort of physical causes where there's

188
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.049
some oomph to it, you know, something hits something

189
00:10:40.049 --> 00:10:42.650
else and there's a physical force and you can

190
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.369
understand a transmission of of energy and momentum and

191
00:10:46.369 --> 00:10:48.169
you know, some people think that those are the

192
00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:51.489
only real causes, those sorts of physical causes. But

193
00:10:51.489 --> 00:10:55.619
actually what happens in a system. IS dependent on

194
00:10:55.619 --> 00:10:57.739
all kinds of other things, right? There's all sorts

195
00:10:57.739 --> 00:11:00.260
of dependence causes. What's the material that things are

196
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.419
made out of? What's the configuration that they're in,

197
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.340
which will determine The outcome of of the the

198
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.250
way physical forces play out and even determine the

199
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.369
distribution of physical forces in the first place. So

200
00:11:13.369 --> 00:11:17.500
those dependence causes. I think are really key to

201
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.380
understanding free will because in the nervous system, the

202
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.609
way some pattern of neural activity is uh the

203
00:11:24.619 --> 00:11:27.460
the effects that it has is not just a

204
00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.460
matter of like electricity hitting another neuron. This neuron

205
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.460
is interpreting what's happening. It's asking what are my

206
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.940
inputs and what should I do about them? And

207
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.179
that depends on the configuration of the of the

208
00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:44.080
synapses. So, you know, down at that level. If

209
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.000
you're asking what's important to think about in the

210
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.479
neural system, the configuration of the system is doing

211
00:11:51.479 --> 00:11:55.599
interpretive work. And that for me is really key.

212
00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.179
That's why, you know, I like to say that

213
00:11:58.179 --> 00:12:02.239
the the system runs on meaning. Because the effect

214
00:12:02.239 --> 00:12:05.239
of any pattern of neural activity is highly, highly

215
00:12:05.239 --> 00:12:10.380
context dependent and That context is, first of all,

216
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.909
reflects the history of the organism. Uh, BUT secondly

217
00:12:13.909 --> 00:12:17.010
reflects the current state of the organism. So, you

218
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.460
know, when you engage attention, when you change arousal,

219
00:12:20.669 --> 00:12:24.099
when you adopt a goal, when you, uh, understand

220
00:12:24.309 --> 00:12:28.460
something that you didn't understand before. There's top-down effects

221
00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.950
that change the local configuration of synapses and there's,

222
00:12:31.979 --> 00:12:35.020
you know, neuromodulatory effects and so on. And, and

223
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:40.349
so those are the neural mechanisms whereby top down

224
00:12:40.349 --> 00:12:44.849
mental causation um can play out again without having

225
00:12:44.849 --> 00:12:46.460
any ghost in the machine.

226
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.409
So I have these questions save for later, but

227
00:12:50.409 --> 00:12:54.479
since you mentioned causation and particularly top-down causation, let

228
00:12:54.479 --> 00:12:57.369
me ask you, uh, when it comes to causation,

229
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:03.330
do you think that our Western scientific tradition equips

230
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:08.309
us well cognitively with the appropriate tools and framework

231
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:13.299
to understand it? Uh. Because as you said, uh,

232
00:13:13.419 --> 00:13:16.369
I can't remember exactly the terms you use, but,

233
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.859
uh, sometimes when we think about a top-down position,

234
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.340
it seems a little bit esoteric and that in

235
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.849
a way it would negate materialism or something like

236
00:13:26.849 --> 00:13:29.099
that. So what do you make of that?

237
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.619
Yeah, I think so. I mean, if you look

238
00:13:30.619 --> 00:13:34.969
at the history of, um, Of causation, uh, the

239
00:13:34.969 --> 00:13:38.919
philosophy of causation and, and of scientific thought, then

240
00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:40.679
I mean this is a kind of a potted

241
00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:42.369
history, but you know, you can look back to

242
00:13:42.369 --> 00:13:45.090
Aristotle, for example, who had a very pluralistic notion

243
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.780
of causation. And he talked about, uh, he, he

244
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.429
used some slightly weird terminology be translated as, for

245
00:13:52.429 --> 00:13:55.099
example, the efficient cause and the material cause. So

246
00:13:55.099 --> 00:13:58.500
those would be things where basically like, what's what's

247
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.770
the system, what's the stuff in the system made

248
00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.659
out of and what are the forces that are

249
00:14:02.659 --> 00:14:05.409
at play? OK, so it's, it's matter in motion.

250
00:14:05.539 --> 00:14:08.739
Those are, those are his causes. And those are

251
00:14:08.739 --> 00:14:11.700
perfectly good ways of thinking about causation within a

252
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.090
system, but they're limited. They're not, they don't capture

253
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.590
everything. Because he had 22 other kinds of causes

254
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.190
that he thought about. One was what he called

255
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.239
the formal cause. Um, WHICH it doesn't really translate

256
00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:26.039
into modern thought very directly, but the way I

257
00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:28.000
think of it is basically the configuration of the

258
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.469
system. Um, WHICH, which is imposing some constraints on

259
00:14:32.469 --> 00:14:36.090
what can happen. It's just shaping the possibility space.

260
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.429
And then, uh, most famously, there was the final

261
00:14:39.429 --> 00:14:42.090
cause in his sense it was, what is this

262
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.030
for? Why did this happen? If you want to

263
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.710
say why did something happen, you can ask how

264
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.400
come it happened? How did it come to happen,

265
00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:51.539
but also what for? Why did it happen? And

266
00:14:51.539 --> 00:14:54.270
that's a kind of a cause that that um.

267
00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:58.229
You know that tele teleology kind of got banished

268
00:14:58.599 --> 00:15:03.320
from Western scientific thought and very explicitly by um

269
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.880
Francis Bacon in the um 16th or 17th century,

270
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.989
I can't remember exactly. Where, you know, he basically

271
00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:15.210
exhorted people to just think about material and efficient

272
00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.570
causes and to not worry about these final causes

273
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.700
which seemed again kind of magical because it it

274
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.690
it seems like the end point, which is in

275
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.369
the future, is some, is somehow reaching backwards in

276
00:15:29.369 --> 00:15:32.799
time and changing things right now, right, which obviously

277
00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:35.729
can't happen, shouldn't happen, that kind of retro causality

278
00:15:35.729 --> 00:15:39.750
is highly suspect. But you can just flip that

279
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.830
around and say, no, that's not, that's not what's

280
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.909
happening at all. When an animal has a goal.

281
00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:48.280
Yeah. It, there's a causal efficacy of it's having

282
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.520
a goal right now. It's not the future end

283
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.679
state that's having an effect. It's the fact that

284
00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:55.880
the organism wants to get to it. That's what's

285
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.799
having an effect, and that's a present state, that's

286
00:15:57.799 --> 00:16:01.440
a current state. And so there's no real problem

287
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.280
with incorporating that. We just have to have a

288
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.630
slightly more expansive view of causation that isn't so

289
00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:13.559
um focused on, you know, matter in motion. And

290
00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:17.880
that encompasses these these broader dependence causes or configurational

291
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.960
causes, and I think we're, you know, neuroscience is

292
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.429
actually moving that way partly because the experimental methods

293
00:16:25.429 --> 00:16:27.219
that we have are now allowing us to do

294
00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:29.880
that, you know, we're able to record more neurons

295
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.200
in an awake behaving animals and we're able to

296
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.000
look at more contextual kind of stuff as opposed

297
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.929
to simple. Isolated neurons or circuits, um, which, you

298
00:16:40.929 --> 00:16:43.929
know, the danger of that reductive approach is that

299
00:16:43.929 --> 00:16:48.559
it makes it look like any behavior. IS being

300
00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:51.440
caused by the activity of certain bits within the

301
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.619
organism, where the organism's not doing anything as an

302
00:16:54.619 --> 00:16:58.119
agent, it's being pushed around by its parts. And

303
00:16:58.119 --> 00:17:01.719
that's a, that's a danger of the uh paradigm

304
00:17:01.719 --> 00:17:07.209
of trying to isolate functions to specific neural circuits,

305
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.040
when in fact that anything that's happening within the

306
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.000
brain is always being interpreted in this more holistic

307
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.640
global context.

308
00:17:15.708 --> 00:17:18.588
There's also I think a very interesting question here

309
00:17:18.588 --> 00:17:24.858
surrounding how we understand ontology because there's, for example,

310
00:17:24.989 --> 00:17:29.218
process ontology and substance ontology, and we in the

311
00:17:29.218 --> 00:17:33.380
west tend to think more in terms of Substances

312
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.449
instead of processes. Do you think that that distinction

313
00:17:37.449 --> 00:17:41.459
is also important to keep in mind to understand

314
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:47.619
how uh neural systems operate and how free will

315
00:17:47.619 --> 00:17:48.369
comes about?

316
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.890
Yeah, absolutely, I think, I mean, I'm I'm very

317
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:56.040
much in favor of a process view. I probably

318
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.819
don't go all the way that some people do

319
00:17:57.819 --> 00:17:59.550
where they say, you know, the essence of things

320
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:04.469
is processes and objects are just really slow processes.

321
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.729
I don't, I mean, I don't really find that

322
00:18:06.729 --> 00:18:09.160
super helpful. Um I think we can still think

323
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.119
of objects and and and entities, but they're engaged

324
00:18:13.119 --> 00:18:15.319
in processes and what I want to think I

325
00:18:15.319 --> 00:18:18.310
guess is that the The properties that anything has

326
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:23.119
are inherently relational. They're always involved. Every property, even

327
00:18:23.119 --> 00:18:25.520
something like mass, you know, where you would say

328
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.920
that this, this subatomic particle has a mass. Well,

329
00:18:28.959 --> 00:18:31.599
that's that's a relation, right? That's a relational property

330
00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:33.719
with the, you know, the Higgs field or whatever

331
00:18:33.719 --> 00:18:36.719
else it is, right? So, so, you know, when

332
00:18:36.719 --> 00:18:41.699
we start thinking in in cognitive science terms, I

333
00:18:41.699 --> 00:18:43.930
like to think much more in terms of activities

334
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.729
than objects. So even something like the word mind,

335
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.319
you know, you say I have a mind, it's

336
00:18:48.319 --> 00:18:51.459
something's on my mind. It sounds like a noun,

337
00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:53.520
right? It sounds like an object, like a place

338
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.119
where things are happening, where uh to me it's

339
00:18:56.119 --> 00:18:59.550
just mind is a verb, you know, it's a

340
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.819
it's mentality is a is a set of processes

341
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.439
that have certain relations uh or that support certain

342
00:19:08.439 --> 00:19:13.040
relations both sort of internally, cognitively and and and

343
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.680
between the organism and its environment. And Um, you

344
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.439
know, you could say the same thing with something

345
00:19:18.439 --> 00:19:21.599
like the term representation, where we'll say, you know,

346
00:19:21.719 --> 00:19:25.040
the, the, within the brain there is a representation

347
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.390
of something out in the world. Like right now,

348
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.640
um, you know, you're looking at my face and

349
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.069
you've got a representation of my face in your

350
00:19:33.069 --> 00:19:38.119
fusiform face area. That's that's fine, it's like it's

351
00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:42.079
not wrong, it's just not super useful because it's

352
00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:44.750
more interesting to me to say that you are

353
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:48.839
representing, right, as an activity and that that activity

354
00:19:48.839 --> 00:19:53.079
requires not just the presence of that particular pattern

355
00:19:53.079 --> 00:19:56.160
of activity, but the way that it's interpreted by

356
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.599
other parts of the of the brain and what

357
00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:01.010
it means to you as an organism. And so

358
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.209
I think, you know, moving to this kind of

359
00:20:03.209 --> 00:20:06.449
process view where we're talking about activity and relations.

360
00:20:07.689 --> 00:20:11.880
Um, JUST better captures what's actually happening. There aren't

361
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.670
isolated elements and, and, and objects, even there aren't

362
00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:19.189
isolated cognitive objects. There are things that we may

363
00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:22.949
be thinking about. And that thinking may be supported

364
00:20:22.949 --> 00:20:28.800
by current activational state of populations of neurons. But

365
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.079
those, uh, the, the meaning of those neurons inheres

366
00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:35.839
in the connections that they have with other parts

367
00:20:35.839 --> 00:20:38.079
of the brain, right? The meaning is evoked, it's

368
00:20:38.079 --> 00:20:41.839
not, it's not contained in a in a local

369
00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:44.040
pattern. The local pattern doesn't do anything by itself,

370
00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:47.420
it has to be interpreted. So, Yeah, I think,

371
00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:50.189
I, I guess more than just the distinction between

372
00:20:50.189 --> 00:20:53.579
the substance and process ontology, I guess I'm, I'm

373
00:20:53.579 --> 00:20:57.849
favoring these days a much more dynamical relational view

374
00:20:57.849 --> 00:20:59.130
of of what's going on.

375
00:21:00.699 --> 00:21:02.780
So let me ask you a different kind of

376
00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.060
question now. When we are simulating possible courses of

377
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.180
action when we are in the process of decision

378
00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:17.020
making, do we know why certain possibilities spring to

379
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.739
mind and not others? I mean, because in many

380
00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:23.380
instances, I'm not sure if in all instances, but

381
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.199
at least in many instances, it seems to be

382
00:21:26.199 --> 00:21:31.380
that there would. Be a near infinitude of possibilities

383
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:35.989
to consider, but that's not how our decision making

384
00:21:35.989 --> 00:21:40.979
processes work. We only tend to consider a limited

385
00:21:40.979 --> 00:21:42.939
number of possibilities.

386
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.910
Yeah, exactly, and I think that's really key because

387
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.989
um you've hit on the, on the problem of

388
00:21:48.989 --> 00:21:51.949
behavioral control, right? We, we have too many options,

389
00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:54.910
we just have this infinity of options. Um, AND,

390
00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.449
and we can't in any scenario, run through them

391
00:21:58.449 --> 00:22:01.770
all in some sort of rational calculation that's weighing

392
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.569
them all up because we'd be dead, right? You

393
00:22:03.569 --> 00:22:06.449
know, we just have to do something fast. So,

394
00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:11.699
um, decision making has to involve lots of heuristics.

395
00:22:11.729 --> 00:22:14.140
It has to involve, first of all, habits where

396
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.859
there's literally just habits of behavior where effectively we

397
00:22:17.859 --> 00:22:19.540
don't have to think about it at all, right?

398
00:22:19.619 --> 00:22:22.020
We just, we just know in this scenario do

399
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.859
X or do Y, right? Because it's worked out

400
00:22:23.859 --> 00:22:27.739
well in the past. So that's really um useful,

401
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.219
that's a way to offload um the cognitive work

402
00:22:32.219 --> 00:22:35.540
to cashed policies, which we've learned are are good.

403
00:22:36.589 --> 00:22:39.170
But we also have habits of thought, and that's

404
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:43.209
equally important in that in a given scenario, we

405
00:22:43.209 --> 00:22:46.209
may not know exactly what to do, but we

406
00:22:46.209 --> 00:22:51.290
may have certain sort of uh more um practiced

407
00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.369
ways of thinking about what to do, right? So

408
00:22:53.369 --> 00:22:55.369
there may be some set of options that will

409
00:22:55.369 --> 00:22:58.130
occur to us that's highly constrained, right? So it's

410
00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.729
already narrowing down the possibility space or the search

411
00:23:01.729 --> 00:23:04.329
space, um, for thinking about what to do, which

412
00:23:04.329 --> 00:23:08.729
is again, Super effective most of the time, right?

413
00:23:08.839 --> 00:23:13.050
And so the challenge is when um we encounter

414
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:15.930
a completely novel scenario where we're really out of

415
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.319
our depth, we have no idea what to do

416
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.569
and then you know, often the best thing to

417
00:23:20.569 --> 00:23:23.589
do is wait, is to gather more information. Um,

418
00:23:23.619 --> 00:23:27.329
FOR example, or sometimes if we have to act

419
00:23:27.329 --> 00:23:30.250
to just do something kind of slightly at random

420
00:23:30.459 --> 00:23:33.369
and actually, you know, in many cases we may

421
00:23:33.369 --> 00:23:37.189
make use of the noisy, um, elements of uh

422
00:23:37.189 --> 00:23:41.819
of neural signaling and just allow that to um

423
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.739
to drive a a a behavior when we don't

424
00:23:45.739 --> 00:23:47.500
know what we should do or we don't care

425
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.489
what we should do we should do something. So

426
00:23:50.489 --> 00:23:53.209
there's, you know, there's always some some noisiness at

427
00:23:53.209 --> 00:23:55.650
play there. But what's interesting, you know, in this

428
00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:57.680
sort of scenario you're you're thinking about when ideas

429
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.270
pop into our mind. We could say, OK, where

430
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.810
did that idea come from? Well, usually they don't

431
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:07.270
come from nowhere. They're usually informed by um our

432
00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:10.270
kind of just general background knowledge of how things

433
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.239
work and how we should behave, right? So they're

434
00:24:12.239 --> 00:24:15.660
not random completely. But there may be various options

435
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.150
that um that occur to us. And then there's

436
00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.189
a model which actually goes back to William James

437
00:24:22.189 --> 00:24:24.750
at least, called the two-stage model of free will,

438
00:24:24.829 --> 00:24:28.510
where the idea is, given some scenario you find

439
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:33.520
yourself in. Some um options occur to you and

440
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.599
you know in in neuroscience terms you could say

441
00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:38.400
some patterns of activity within the within the parts

442
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.589
of the cerebral cortex which represent possible actions become

443
00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:47.469
primed or or activated. And then they get submitted

444
00:24:47.739 --> 00:24:52.530
to this evaluation system. So, um, this, you know,

445
00:24:52.699 --> 00:24:54.890
the current thinking at least is that this involves

446
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:59.219
the basal ganglia, um, you know, evaluative systems in

447
00:24:59.219 --> 00:25:01.780
the midbrain, the thalamus, and then loops that go

448
00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.979
back to the back to the cortex, and you

449
00:25:03.979 --> 00:25:06.020
can think about this as, you know, these competing

450
00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.619
patterns that are vying for control of the motor

451
00:25:09.619 --> 00:25:12.770
system. Where actually what the basal ganglia are doing

452
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.420
is, is most of the time just putting the

453
00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.819
brakes on the motor system. They're absolutely just stopping

454
00:25:18.819 --> 00:25:23.130
everything until they decide in this competition to let

455
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.050
one of those actions through and that can drive,

456
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.729
um, you know, the the motor command centers, that's

457
00:25:29.729 --> 00:25:32.250
that's one way to look at it. So in

458
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:36.689
that scenario, um, you know, James famously said, my

459
00:25:36.689 --> 00:25:40.560
thoughts come to me freely. My actions go from

460
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.119
me willfully, right? So you've got a sense there

461
00:25:44.119 --> 00:25:48.599
where you're, you're, yeah, there is some randomness in

462
00:25:48.599 --> 00:25:51.910
what occurs to you to do. Constrained by prior

463
00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:56.109
knowledge, but then you're making these evaluative decisions based

464
00:25:56.109 --> 00:25:57.989
on what you think is gonna turn out the

465
00:25:57.989 --> 00:25:58.439
best.

466
00:26:00.369 --> 00:26:02.650
Do, I mean, do you think that we should

467
00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.680
think about the fact that we do not consider

468
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:11.060
all possibilities that would be out there in our

469
00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:15.089
decision making a constraint on free will because, you

470
00:26:15.089 --> 00:26:19.030
know, probably this is something that Robert support. AND

471
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.829
other people like him would say that or would

472
00:26:21.829 --> 00:26:26.790
argue that because um we are, we are influenced

473
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:31.709
by our uh prior experiences in terms of what

474
00:26:31.709 --> 00:26:36.540
kinds of options spring, spring to mind that would

475
00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:40.709
be. Uh, AN argument against free will.

476
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.619
Yeah, well, OK, so there's two ways to look

477
00:26:43.619 --> 00:26:46.979
at this. One is to say, um, it's only

478
00:26:46.979 --> 00:26:50.079
free will if there are no prior causes affecting

479
00:26:50.079 --> 00:26:53.079
you whatsoever, right? There's no constraints whatsoever from your

480
00:26:53.079 --> 00:26:57.609
past, um, or towards the future or Anything else,

481
00:26:57.689 --> 00:26:59.770
right, which is kind of a weird scenario if

482
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:02.050
you take it to its logical conclusion, like you

483
00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.729
would just be doing random stuff, right? You can't

484
00:27:04.729 --> 00:27:08.000
have, you're not allowed to have any memories, any

485
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.369
goals, any preferences, any habits, any attitudes or dispositions

486
00:27:11.369 --> 00:27:14.329
or policies or commitments or ongoing projects or anything

487
00:27:14.329 --> 00:27:18.380
that makes you you. And uh just at every

488
00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.300
moment, you'd have to be doing something random. And

489
00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:26.060
you know, obviously that's not life isn't like that,

490
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.660
right? I mean, it's very, very basic what life

491
00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.810
is, what life does, what living organisms do is

492
00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:37.449
make themselves happen. Right, they continuously make themselves happen

493
00:27:37.449 --> 00:27:38.930
through time. Out of all the things that could

494
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.569
happen, they make this happen where this is their

495
00:27:42.569 --> 00:27:45.890
continued existence. And so that's the whole thing, like

496
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:49.060
that's life's whole shtick is is this sort of

497
00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:54.849
historicity. So to imagine this scenario where you're ultimately

498
00:27:54.849 --> 00:27:57.579
free and can do anything you want, where you'd

499
00:27:57.579 --> 00:27:59.459
have to ask, well, why would you want anything?

500
00:27:59.489 --> 00:28:01.739
You wouldn't be, you wouldn't be you. There there'd

501
00:28:01.739 --> 00:28:04.280
be no self there, right? OK, so that's the

502
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.550
first um thing. The other thing is to say,

503
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.540
Well, to get back to what I just said

504
00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.339
a minute ago, that these constraints are from your

505
00:28:11.339 --> 00:28:15.500
past are super, super adaptive, right? I mean, you,

506
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.859
you just can't in every scenario work through every

507
00:28:19.859 --> 00:28:22.410
possible thing that you could do with your body,

508
00:28:22.619 --> 00:28:25.420
right? Like, I mean, just imagine all the things

509
00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.780
you could do with your body right now that

510
00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:30.050
you're not doing. So, um, you don't have to

511
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:34.930
think about the 99.999999% of those, right? There's only

512
00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.880
little little options where you do think about it.

513
00:28:37.969 --> 00:28:41.530
And so, you know, what, what Robert Sapolsky argues

514
00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:45.209
is that all of those past effects. Your genetics,

515
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.760
human evolution generally, the way your brain developed, you

516
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.400
know, what hormones you were exposed to in the

517
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.640
womb, and then all the experiences that have happened

518
00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.390
to you. Narrow down your decision making to one.

519
00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:02.189
To one option. In every scenario, it's determined what

520
00:29:02.189 --> 00:29:03.790
you're going to do by all of those prior

521
00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:09.000
factors. And there's simply no evidence for that whatsoever.

522
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.250
Right, of course there are influences, but what he

523
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.040
does is look at all these sort of separate

524
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.550
influences and say, well, gosh, that's a lot. It

525
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:22.550
seems to me like they must collectively preclude anything

526
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.859
being up to up to you as an agent.

527
00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:28.150
And that's just kind of vibes. It like there's

528
00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:31.630
really no scientific evidence for that whatsoever. It doesn't

529
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.760
fit with uh the phenomenology of our experience of

530
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:38.630
of deliberation. It doesn't fit with the neuroscience that

531
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:42.185
we see of decision making under conflict. Where you

532
00:29:42.185 --> 00:29:46.714
can literally see these kinds of competitions uh happening

533
00:29:47.035 --> 00:29:50.275
where, you know, this the the decision making, the

534
00:29:50.275 --> 00:29:53.915
behavioral control is not this instantaneous transition from a

535
00:29:53.915 --> 00:29:56.795
state to another state. It's like, OK, I, I'm

536
00:29:56.795 --> 00:30:00.614
now in state A, I, I'm at T T

537
00:30:00.614 --> 00:30:03.515
and uh it's just a physical system and it's

538
00:30:03.515 --> 00:30:05.474
configured a certain way and it's gonna go to

539
00:30:05.474 --> 00:30:08.074
state B at time T + 1. Like those

540
00:30:08.074 --> 00:30:11.829
are some some instantaneous transition. It's a process, right?

541
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.579
Deliberation, when we're really, you know, deliberating under conflict,

542
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.750
takes time. We have to, we don't we don't

543
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.790
just run through, uh, you know, inputs into the

544
00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:25.829
algorithm as if, as if the algorithm is all

545
00:30:25.829 --> 00:30:29.199
set up to deal with this novel scenario. In

546
00:30:29.199 --> 00:30:31.699
any new scenario, we have to figure out what

547
00:30:31.699 --> 00:30:34.670
the weights of the algorithm should be, right? We

548
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.540
have to figure out what's relevant to us now.

549
00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:41.739
And work through that process and um weigh up

550
00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:45.339
these alternatives and then choose one. It feels like

551
00:30:45.339 --> 00:30:47.650
that's what we're doing. The neuroscience shows that's what

552
00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:50.369
we're doing and there's no reason to think that

553
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.640
that can be sort of short circuited or that

554
00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.859
there's just some lookup table that we can um

555
00:30:55.859 --> 00:30:58.229
appeal to in every scenario that we're in. And

556
00:30:58.229 --> 00:31:01.569
to me, um, that just is you making a

557
00:31:01.569 --> 00:31:04.680
decision. Like, yes, it involves your brain, of course

558
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.000
it does. Uh, BUT what else would it involve?

559
00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:10.680
You know, just because there's bits, there's a physical

560
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.239
instantiation of it, doesn't mean it's not you doing

561
00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:17.329
it, and I think that, you know, Robert's um

562
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.359
Uh, view with respect to him, I think has

563
00:31:20.359 --> 00:31:23.439
this underlying dualism to it. It's like every time

564
00:31:23.439 --> 00:31:27.290
we show some of the neuroscience of decision making,

565
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:31.280
he thinks, aha, see? It's not you, it's your

566
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.270
brain. But that's just like uh that's just a

567
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:37.910
dualist idea that the only thing that would satisfy

568
00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:40.910
him is if we could find the ghost in

569
00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:42.989
the machine. And of course, he says, like a

570
00:31:42.989 --> 00:31:44.829
good materialist, there can't be a ghost in the

571
00:31:44.829 --> 00:31:46.180
machine, therefore there's no free will.

572
00:31:47.979 --> 00:31:50.560
And, but at a certain point in your book,

573
00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:54.609
you say that it can pay off to behave

574
00:31:54.609 --> 00:31:57.979
randomly sometimes. Could you explain that?

575
00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.339
Yeah, well, I mean, uh, a good example is

576
00:32:01.339 --> 00:32:04.589
when creatures are escaping from a predator. And in

577
00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:10.030
fact many, many animals um have systems that basically

578
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:13.349
randomize their, their escape trajectory. So they have like

579
00:32:13.349 --> 00:32:15.150
a jump response or something like that. I'm thinking

580
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.550
of insects for example. Um, BUT the direction in

581
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:22.959
which they jump is highly indeterministic. And it seems

582
00:32:22.959 --> 00:32:26.650
to vary uh along with just some some noisy

583
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.520
conditions in the in the nervous system at the

584
00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.619
moment. And that's adaptive because um if you were

585
00:32:32.619 --> 00:32:35.319
really predictable, you know, if you always escaped one

586
00:32:35.319 --> 00:32:38.040
direction, then predators could just take advantage of that,

587
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.000
right? So if you're super predictable, you're lunch and

588
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.560
that's uh that's just bad, right? So, so I

589
00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:48.510
think organisms can allow some randomness to be at

590
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:50.709
play in in that kind of scenario. And you

591
00:32:50.709 --> 00:32:52.790
know, we talked about this a minute ago, this

592
00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.869
idea of ideas popping into your head, and there's

593
00:32:55.869 --> 00:32:59.069
a certain scenario where Some ideas pop into your

594
00:32:59.069 --> 00:33:01.349
head, you try them out, right? You've got some

595
00:33:01.349 --> 00:33:04.849
goals and you know, but we don't just take

596
00:33:04.849 --> 00:33:07.719
decisions and then that's it. We monitor those decisions,

597
00:33:07.729 --> 00:33:10.949
right? So our behavioral control is very much extended

598
00:33:10.949 --> 00:33:14.849
through time. It's not just these momentary um decisions.

599
00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:19.204
We're we're we're engaged. Activities and we monitor those

600
00:33:19.204 --> 00:33:21.324
for some time to see if we're achieving our

601
00:33:21.324 --> 00:33:26.234
goals. Now, if we're not, then there's mechanisms that

602
00:33:26.234 --> 00:33:30.724
involve um release of norepinephrine from the locus cerulius,

603
00:33:30.765 --> 00:33:32.765
which is the the blue spot in the, in

604
00:33:32.765 --> 00:33:37.750
the hindbrain or midbrain, um which Uh, goes to

605
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:41.069
the cortex and basically kind of allows there to

606
00:33:41.069 --> 00:33:42.910
be a bit more noise. It sort of raises

607
00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:46.390
the temperature of the system, um, in a, in

608
00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.630
an information theoretic, uh, use of the term temperature

609
00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:53.750
there and Sort of shakes the shakes the system

610
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.410
up a little bit, shakes it out of its

611
00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.619
ruts of habits of thought and broadens the search

612
00:33:58.619 --> 00:34:00.089
space. And you know, you can see how that's

613
00:34:00.089 --> 00:34:03.380
adaptive if it it's kind of the equivalent of

614
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.890
going back to the drawing board and thinking outside

615
00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:10.100
the box, right? So thinking. Creatively by taking advantage

616
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.870
of a little bit of of of noisiness which

617
00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:17.060
just allows you to explore a wider search space.

618
00:34:17.228 --> 00:34:19.510
And you can see, you know, a parallel with

619
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:25.728
evolutionary search there where evolution depends on random variation,

620
00:34:25.918 --> 00:34:29.668
uh, generating options which it then tests and it's

621
00:34:29.668 --> 00:34:32.938
sort of a similar analogous situation there.

622
00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:36.929
Do you think that what you explore in your

623
00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:40.429
book in terms of free will and that applies

624
00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:46.728
to biological systems could also apply to artificial intelligence

625
00:34:46.728 --> 00:34:47.370
systems?

626
00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:50.250
Yeah, I mean, this is where this becomes much

627
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:53.810
more than an abstract um philosophical debate that you

628
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:55.958
have down the pub on a Friday night, right?

629
00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:00.250
Um, SO it becomes really important because, uh, we

630
00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:03.000
can think beyond the the yes or no question,

631
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.770
do we have free will or not? And instead

632
00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:07.689
we can ask um what are the systems that

633
00:35:07.689 --> 00:35:12.689
support. Rational cognitive behavioral control and what are the

634
00:35:12.689 --> 00:35:16.770
systems of of goal, um, you know, gold um

635
00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:24.080
choice, action choice, nested hierarchical control, motivations, simulation, evaluation,

636
00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.169
right, all of those things have have neural basis

637
00:35:26.169 --> 00:35:29.969
to them. Um, AND we can think about those

638
00:35:29.969 --> 00:35:32.449
in both in terms of the really, really particulars

639
00:35:32.449 --> 00:35:34.530
of the operations that are going on, but also

640
00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.489
in a slightly more abstract way, again, in a

641
00:35:36.489 --> 00:35:39.250
more relational way. We can say, what are the

642
00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:43.530
kinds of cognitive operations that an agent has to

643
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:45.239
be able to do in order to get around

644
00:35:45.239 --> 00:35:47.879
in the world, right? Where do its goals come

645
00:35:47.879 --> 00:35:51.459
from? Um, HOW does it decide between them? How

646
00:35:51.459 --> 00:35:55.370
does it basically, um, solve this big optimization problem

647
00:35:55.699 --> 00:36:01.580
when faced with novel, unpredictable, uncertain, uh, environments and

648
00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:05.580
limited information and time pressures to, to act, OK.

649
00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.550
So we can get, and we are getting a

650
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:11.459
handle on those kinds of systems, how they work,

651
00:36:11.629 --> 00:36:15.300
what functionalities they engender, and how they can be

652
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.709
put together to enable adaptive action. Now with all

653
00:36:19.709 --> 00:36:23.139
of that knowledge, there's there's nothing to stop us,

654
00:36:23.229 --> 00:36:26.750
I think, from saying, OK, we could absolutely operationalize

655
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:29.439
that in an artificial system. We could do it

656
00:36:29.439 --> 00:36:33.580
in a virtual agent. Wandering around in Minecraft or

657
00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.100
something like that or we could do it in

658
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.979
a robot that's actually encountering the real world. The

659
00:36:38.979 --> 00:36:42.429
difference I think from, you know, current AI systems

660
00:36:42.429 --> 00:36:45.100
like chat GPT and stuff like that is those

661
00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.659
systems are not embodied, they're not engaging with the

662
00:36:48.659 --> 00:36:51.739
world, they're just, they're not designed to, right? They're

663
00:36:51.739 --> 00:36:54.050
not, nobody was trying to make them really be

664
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:59.280
agents. Uh, THEY have no sort of causal. Relationship

665
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:02.409
with the world, right? They're not doing things, noticing

666
00:37:02.409 --> 00:37:05.810
the outcomes of their actions, uh, updating their model

667
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:08.129
of the world accordingly and so on. They're not,

668
00:37:08.169 --> 00:37:11.330
they're just not immersed in, uh, in an environment.

669
00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.570
But there's no reason why you couldn't make things

670
00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:20.120
that have those kinds of um embodiment, embeddedness and

671
00:37:20.199 --> 00:37:23.729
um what you might call, you know, in mindedness.

672
00:37:23.969 --> 00:37:26.409
We're not, they're not just embodied, but they have

673
00:37:26.409 --> 00:37:32.290
a a a cognitive architecture. That, uh, basically gives

674
00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:35.850
them some kind of mentality, some kind of subjective

675
00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:39.570
experience within the world, where they distinguish themselves as

676
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:41.929
an entity from the rest of the world, where

677
00:37:41.929 --> 00:37:45.770
they understand, uh, that they have a causal influence

678
00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:48.689
on the world and vice versa, their modeling self

679
00:37:48.689 --> 00:37:51.979
and world and the relations between those. It it

680
00:37:51.979 --> 00:37:55.659
seems quite possible in principle. At least I, I

681
00:37:55.659 --> 00:37:58.250
see, I see no argument against it in principle

682
00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.580
that um that we could build systems like that.

683
00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.020
People are working on it. I think we'll get

684
00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:09.060
to things in short order that we have to

685
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.340
um allow, have some kind of agency and then

686
00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:15.179
we're gonna be in a world of ethical and

687
00:38:15.179 --> 00:38:18.929
practical dilemmas that we're gonna have to grapple with.

688
00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:25.000
So you think that if we are able to

689
00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:31.000
someday build AI systems that are embodied and embedded,

690
00:38:31.169 --> 00:38:36.409
I mean, probably the the full 4E cognition uh

691
00:38:36.409 --> 00:38:40.570
there, uh, that they could possibly have free will

692
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:41.120
as well.

693
00:38:42.879 --> 00:38:44.570
Yeah, again, I think that, you know, the, the

694
00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:47.580
answer here is to is to back away from

695
00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.929
the metaphysical and just operationalize what we mean by

696
00:38:50.929 --> 00:38:56.209
free will. So, um, would it have behavioral autonomy?

697
00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:59.169
Would it be able to make its own goals

698
00:38:59.169 --> 00:39:02.050
not along the way, right? Not just uh play

699
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:05.209
out the the the the goals that were preprogrammed

700
00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:10.560
into it. Would it have some individual agency, um,

701
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:15.669
in terms of Both choice and control, right, so

702
00:39:15.669 --> 00:39:18.820
choice in the sense that it has options, um,

703
00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:21.229
both it has options in the world, but it

704
00:39:21.229 --> 00:39:25.350
also has internal options, right? It's there's nothing predetermined

705
00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.939
as we were just talking about, about its cognitive

706
00:39:27.939 --> 00:39:32.310
operations. There's some play there. And control in the

707
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:35.590
sense that given that there's some play in in

708
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.830
its cognitive operations in in deliberating about what to

709
00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:42.600
do. There's scope for it to have top down.

710
00:39:43.489 --> 00:39:46.209
Uh, CONTROL over what it does based on its

711
00:39:46.209 --> 00:39:49.250
current high-level goals, the goals of the entity, right?

712
00:39:49.409 --> 00:39:53.169
Not the, not the, just the activity of its

713
00:39:53.169 --> 00:39:56.449
parts because the parts don't have goals, right? And

714
00:39:56.449 --> 00:39:58.209
so if we can build a system like that.

715
00:39:59.159 --> 00:40:02.399
That's acting autonomously in the world, that's learning things,

716
00:40:02.469 --> 00:40:07.520
that's accumulating a Um, from its history, it's accumulating

717
00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.709
causal potential. Right, you know, it's building up a

718
00:40:10.709 --> 00:40:13.550
knowledge of the world that's giving it greater causal

719
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:15.679
control in the world. To me that would be

720
00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:19.000
an agent. Um, IF you wanted to say it

721
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.639
had free will, you know, that there's so much

722
00:40:21.639 --> 00:40:24.479
baggage around that that term, you could argue back

723
00:40:24.479 --> 00:40:28.320
and forth, but for all intents and purposes, it

724
00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.620
wouldn't be any different from something that we would

725
00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.270
say does have free will. That's You know, that's

726
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:36.909
a sort of pragmatic way of um approaching what

727
00:40:36.909 --> 00:40:40.550
could otherwise devolve into a semantic dispute.

728
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.699
OK, so let's talk a little bit about your

729
00:40:44.699 --> 00:40:48.340
debates with Robert Sapolsky. I watched two of them.

730
00:40:48.419 --> 00:40:50.459
I'm not sure if there are more out there.

731
00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.739
I watched one in late 2023 and another one

732
00:40:53.739 --> 00:40:58.689
last year. So, what would you say you learned

733
00:40:58.689 --> 00:40:59.219
from them?

734
00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:06.760
Um, IT'S interesting, so. In, I mean, so Robert

735
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.750
is a, you know, he's a great neuroscientist, um,

736
00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:14.479
and as two neuroscientists, it's interesting that we sort

737
00:41:14.479 --> 00:41:16.959
of look at things with very through very different

738
00:41:16.959 --> 00:41:19.600
perspectives and we look at somewhat the same body

739
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:24.870
of evidence, not completely. Um, AND we just take

740
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:28.510
very different kind of conclusions from it. And usually

741
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:31.709
when that's the case, there's some underlying premises that

742
00:41:31.709 --> 00:41:34.229
differ, right? We're, we're bringing different things to the

743
00:41:34.229 --> 00:41:38.070
party, um, that, that kind of explain that. And

744
00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:42.300
I guess for me, my sense is. Again, with

745
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.419
respect, that that Robert has this kind of closet

746
00:41:44.419 --> 00:41:48.780
dualism, where he defines free will, both in an

747
00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.260
absolutist sense, that is, if there's any prior causes

748
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.580
whatsoever, then you're not completely free, you don't have

749
00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:58.040
free will, it just doesn't count. I find that

750
00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.719
notion incoherent for the reasons that we discussed earlier

751
00:42:00.719 --> 00:42:03.199
because you wouldn't be you if there weren't any

752
00:42:03.199 --> 00:42:07.070
prior causes. Um, AND then secondly, uh, you know,

753
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:10.870
there's this sort of dualist intuition that I think

754
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:14.229
he, he has, although he'd absolutely deny it, right?

755
00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:16.709
Um, BUT where he will say, you know, he,

756
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:20.629
he wants to say that free will, um, is

757
00:42:20.629 --> 00:42:23.790
somehow in the brain but not of the brain.

758
00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.949
Or in biology, but not of biology, use those

759
00:42:26.949 --> 00:42:31.540
kinds of phrasings where it's like we're stuck either,

760
00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:35.010
you know, as we do our sort of materialistic

761
00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.750
project of of neuroscience, it seems like all of

762
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:42.090
the causation is located in the brain. And there's

763
00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:46.010
nothing left for us to do. And you know,

764
00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:49.370
I just think that's wrong and it's wrong because

765
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:52.169
it it's it's it locates all the causes at

766
00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:54.449
the lowest levels, and we can get out of

767
00:42:54.449 --> 00:43:00.500
that. Um, BY thinking about emergence, which is another

768
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:05.179
sort of philosophical thorny issue, um, that some people

769
00:43:05.179 --> 00:43:07.620
are kind of allergic to, because it sounds like

770
00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.370
you're getting some kind of magical thing popping out

771
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.780
of um a system when you organize it a

772
00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.780
certain way. And, you know, I think you can

773
00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:20.840
think of emergence as um Well, you have to

774
00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.840
think of it, you have to think of selection

775
00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.639
at the same time, right? It's like a system

776
00:43:24.639 --> 00:43:27.770
could be configured in lots of different ways. Now,

777
00:43:27.899 --> 00:43:32.540
you're not gonna get functionalities by chance, uh, you

778
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.820
know, that persist. You're only going to get good

779
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.260
functionalities because they've been selected for, right? So you

780
00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.459
can, you can get this sort of top uh

781
00:43:40.459 --> 00:43:45.479
microscopic configurations. That um it's not just that there

782
00:43:45.479 --> 00:43:47.600
are properties that you see at that at those

783
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:51.320
emergent levels, it's that there are powers. That in

784
00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.399
here at the higher levels. And they constrain what's

785
00:43:54.399 --> 00:43:56.409
going on at the lower levels, right? It's just

786
00:43:56.409 --> 00:43:58.719
not the case that all the causation is bottom

787
00:43:58.719 --> 00:44:02.439
up. And that's a uh a concept again, that

788
00:44:02.439 --> 00:44:06.280
um I think Robert and I differ on our

789
00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.719
views of that and I in that I don't

790
00:44:07.719 --> 00:44:10.199
see any problem with that. And but I think

791
00:44:10.199 --> 00:44:12.959
he thinks it's a kind of a, uh, again,

792
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.280
it's it's it's something magical about it. I don't

793
00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.479
think that's true. So, um, yeah, so those are

794
00:44:19.479 --> 00:44:22.409
some of the things I guess the other aspect

795
00:44:22.409 --> 00:44:24.639
would be, you know, it is interesting to think

796
00:44:24.639 --> 00:44:27.790
about the evidence that we lean on. So. For

797
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:30.179
Robert, a lot of it is kind of almost

798
00:44:30.179 --> 00:44:34.899
epidemiological behaviorism where he'll say, OK, we can find,

799
00:44:34.949 --> 00:44:37.510
if we look across many people, we can see

800
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:40.689
that people with this exposure could be, you know,

801
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:44.510
this genetic variant or uh a history of child

802
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:47.639
abuse or higher levels of hormones in the womb,

803
00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.429
you know, across this population of people, they tend

804
00:44:50.429 --> 00:44:54.629
to behave like this more than statistically more than

805
00:44:54.629 --> 00:44:57.760
other people, right? So, so that that kind of

806
00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.290
evidence suggests that there are these influences on our

807
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:02.449
behavior, but it's very statistical, right? It's in the

808
00:45:02.449 --> 00:45:07.810
aggregate, it's patterns of behavior, um where there are

809
00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:11.250
influences, but they're not determinants, right? Individually none of

810
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:14.330
them is a is a determinant and collectively there's

811
00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.280
no reason to think that they all are determinants

812
00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.719
either. So you can look at that those kinds

813
00:45:19.719 --> 00:45:23.060
of studies and um. First of all, some of

814
00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:25.909
those studies are just bad, like there's some like

815
00:45:25.909 --> 00:45:29.590
history of candidate gene association studies, which are just

816
00:45:30.419 --> 00:45:34.899
inflating the apparent um effect that particular genetic variants

817
00:45:34.899 --> 00:45:38.429
have on our behavior, say. Um, THERE'S like social

818
00:45:38.429 --> 00:45:42.899
priming studies which again inflate the, uh, idea that

819
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:46.229
unconscious things are driving our behavior. I mean that

820
00:45:46.229 --> 00:45:48.959
whole literature is suspect. And then there's a bunch

821
00:45:48.959 --> 00:45:51.949
of other sort of, um, studies that are effectively

822
00:45:51.949 --> 00:45:56.989
flawed. Sometimes fatally so, where, you know, collectively the

823
00:45:56.989 --> 00:45:58.750
problem is that they give this impression of all

824
00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:01.590
these big, big effects. It's like we're not we're

825
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:05.110
just being buffeted around by all of these prior

826
00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:07.110
things or current states of the world that we're

827
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:09.429
not really conscious of or in control of. And

828
00:46:09.429 --> 00:46:13.270
that paints a picture in a rhetorical sense, not

829
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:16.060
in a, not in an actual edifice of scientific

830
00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.669
evidence. It just seems like it makes it feel

831
00:46:18.669 --> 00:46:21.649
like we're really not in control of anything. Um,

832
00:46:21.729 --> 00:46:23.409
BUT if you back off of that and you

833
00:46:23.409 --> 00:46:26.810
actually look at, you know, the neuroscience of decision

834
00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:29.929
making in real time, not just like what are

835
00:46:29.929 --> 00:46:32.489
the effects prior that that that feed out on

836
00:46:32.489 --> 00:46:35.530
statistically on behavioral patterns, but right now in an

837
00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:38.729
animal that's making a decision, what's the neuroscience that's

838
00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:42.500
actually happening, there you get this picture of this

839
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:47.649
extended holistic, deliberative, integrative processes of the of the

840
00:46:47.649 --> 00:46:51.510
whole system trying to accommodate to new information. Work

841
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:53.780
through a set of options and figure out what

842
00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:57.770
to do. And so for me that neuroscience. That

843
00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:01.209
that Robert doesn't really engage with that much, just

844
00:47:01.209 --> 00:47:03.850
paints a very different picture from the kind of

845
00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:08.050
behavioral epidemiology where you know the the picture that

846
00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:09.899
you get, I think it's just not an accurate

847
00:47:09.899 --> 00:47:12.889
one. It's just very inflated and and it lends

848
00:47:12.889 --> 00:47:17.800
itself to these rhetorical um. Arguments that I think

849
00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.719
don't help us get to uh uh an accurate

850
00:47:20.719 --> 00:47:21.560
scientific picture.

851
00:47:22.689 --> 00:47:24.760
Uh, YEAH, and please correct me if I'm wrong,

852
00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:27.770
but I think, or I got the impression from

853
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:32.610
your debates that there are at least many aspects

854
00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:36.919
where you agree, particularly when it comes to probably

855
00:47:37.209 --> 00:47:41.090
the basic science that provides a basis to the

856
00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:47.409
debate, like the neuroscience, the biology, probably evolutionary aspects

857
00:47:47.409 --> 00:47:51.159
of it as well, physics. Probably not so much,

858
00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:55.530
but, and also you probably disagree also when it

859
00:47:55.530 --> 00:48:00.169
comes to the social psychology that Doctor Sapolsky cites

860
00:48:00.169 --> 00:48:02.209
in his book, which I think is actually one

861
00:48:02.209 --> 00:48:05.169
of the weaker points because at least some of

862
00:48:05.169 --> 00:48:10.169
those studies haven't replicated well. So, but, but then

863
00:48:10.169 --> 00:48:13.729
at a certain point you part ways. Where do

864
00:48:13.729 --> 00:48:15.989
you think that point is exactly?

865
00:48:16.939 --> 00:48:19.500
Well, it's interesting. I mean, one of the things

866
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:23.820
that we do agree on is that the uh

867
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:29.260
most popular philosophical stance for many scientists and philosophers,

868
00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.719
which is compatibleism doesn't hold up, right? So the

869
00:48:32.719 --> 00:48:36.689
idea of compatibleism, which really, um, you know, is,

870
00:48:36.739 --> 00:48:39.860
is concerned with physical predeterminism, the idea that at

871
00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:43.439
the lowest level of physics, everything is deterministic. Um,

872
00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:45.610
THERE'S an argument to be, so, so usually in

873
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:48.080
the free will debate historically, it's like that's the

874
00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.189
way it's set up is this dichotomy, free will

875
00:48:50.189 --> 00:48:54.120
versus determinism. If determinism is true, free will has

876
00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.159
a problem, right? And so free will skeptics would

877
00:48:57.159 --> 00:49:00.639
say, yeah, that's that's true, um, but compatibleists will

878
00:49:00.639 --> 00:49:03.840
say no, even if the world is completely deterministic

879
00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.439
at physical levels, at the lowest levels of physics.

880
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:10.550
Um, WE can still say, we can still mount

881
00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:15.179
a defense at least of moral responsibility. If not

882
00:49:15.179 --> 00:49:16.560
free will in the sense that you could have

883
00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:20.260
done otherwise, at least we could say, well, still

884
00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:23.040
what you did, you did for your reasons and

885
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.100
you were the cause of it happening and the

886
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.929
source of causation is within you as an entity

887
00:49:27.929 --> 00:49:31.129
and therefore you can be held morally responsible. And

888
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.610
uh both Robert and I don't accept that view

889
00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:37.010
at all. I think we both sort of are,

890
00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.370
are a bit perplexed by it because it just,

891
00:49:40.939 --> 00:49:42.669
I mean for me, first of all, obviously there's

892
00:49:42.669 --> 00:49:44.899
no choice, right? So what are we even talking

893
00:49:44.899 --> 00:49:50.040
about? Um, BUT also more fundamentally, In a universe,

894
00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:51.929
if the universe were like that, how would you

895
00:49:51.929 --> 00:49:54.889
ever get to having agents? Where do they come

896
00:49:54.889 --> 00:49:57.649
from? You know, if we don't have variation and

897
00:49:57.649 --> 00:50:01.850
selection and macroscopic causation, I mean the the the

898
00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:06.850
whole point of of low level physical determinism is

899
00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:10.179
it leaves no scope for microscopic causation. There's nothing,

900
00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:12.489
there's no slack in the system. Everything just happens

901
00:50:12.489 --> 00:50:15.330
based on the low levels. So, um, yeah, so

902
00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:17.239
Robert and I agree on that. I think we,

903
00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:19.449
we agree on, you know, that taking an evolutionary

904
00:50:19.449 --> 00:50:22.649
approach is, is useful. We part ways on the

905
00:50:22.649 --> 00:50:26.000
neuroscience of decision making itself in that he has

906
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.209
this view, um. Where, you know, I think he,

907
00:50:31.239 --> 00:50:33.360
he thinks of the brain as a great big

908
00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:37.770
complicated stimulus response machine. Put in the stimulus which

909
00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:40.870
is given what we know about the current state

910
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:43.850
of the world uh and turn through the algorithm

911
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:45.889
and it spits out one answer, right? That's the

912
00:50:45.889 --> 00:50:49.850
sort of cartoon picture of deliberation that he invokes

913
00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:54.459
and that's his whole argument basically. Um, AND so,

914
00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:58.050
yeah, I completely disagree that that's an accurate picture

915
00:50:58.050 --> 00:50:59.899
of what's going on. It doesn't fit the neuroscience,

916
00:50:59.979 --> 00:51:03.209
it doesn't fit the psychology or cognitive science, um,

917
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:06.909
and it doesn't even fit the first person phenomenology

918
00:51:07.139 --> 00:51:09.000
of what it feels like to be making a

919
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.290
decision under conflict. So yeah, I guess that's our,

920
00:51:12.459 --> 00:51:14.580
that's that's where we part ways.

921
00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:19.590
OK, so let me ask you now, because I

922
00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:24.070
think that this is something that um Robert Sapolsky

923
00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:26.540
would also argue for and I want to hear

924
00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.260
your thoughts on it. Do you think that it

925
00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.590
would be possible for us to somewhere in the

926
00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:38.080
future by gathering a lot of information on people's

927
00:51:38.479 --> 00:51:43.280
uh personality, prior experiences, and so on to be

928
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:47.639
able to predict people's behavior with at least a

929
00:51:47.639 --> 00:51:51.919
high degree of accuracy. And if so, what kinds

930
00:51:51.919 --> 00:51:54.919
of implications would that have for the free will

931
00:51:54.919 --> 00:51:55.399
debate? Yeah.

932
00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:00.689
First of all, I think we do predict each

933
00:52:00.689 --> 00:52:03.010
other's behavior with a high degree of accuracy all

934
00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:07.169
the time, right? That's why we're not constantly surprised

935
00:52:07.169 --> 00:52:10.969
by everything that everybody does, because we have expectations

936
00:52:10.969 --> 00:52:15.570
of behavior based on the social settings based on

937
00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:18.409
knowledge of people's character and personality. I mean, so

938
00:52:18.409 --> 00:52:21.689
much so that when people really start acting out

939
00:52:21.689 --> 00:52:24.679
of character, we often take it as a sign

940
00:52:24.679 --> 00:52:28.889
of of mental illness, right? So we're really good

941
00:52:28.889 --> 00:52:32.280
at predicting people's individual people's behavior that we know.

942
00:52:33.209 --> 00:52:35.330
We're not as good at predicting the behavior of

943
00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:38.370
strangers, except in a broader sense where we say,

944
00:52:38.449 --> 00:52:41.570
OK, a person in this scenario, right, a person

945
00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:44.179
who has gone to a restaurant is likely to

946
00:52:44.179 --> 00:52:46.729
sit at a table and order food. That's fine,

947
00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:48.639
right, but we don't know if they're gonna prefer

948
00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:54.709
uh lasagna or calamari, so, um, so. Yeah, I

949
00:52:54.709 --> 00:52:56.659
think we can, we can think about, you know,

950
00:52:56.830 --> 00:53:00.209
predicting each other's behavior as something that we just

951
00:53:00.209 --> 00:53:02.830
do all the time. That's in fact that's kind

952
00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:06.790
of social cognition is the whole edifice on which

953
00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:10.439
civilization is built, right? That's that's our superpower, right?

954
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:13.110
That's what that's what enables us to be a

955
00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:17.469
hyper-social cooperative species, right? So, uh, so we already

956
00:53:17.469 --> 00:53:19.149
do that. Now the question is like could you

957
00:53:19.149 --> 00:53:22.270
do it uh in a really deterministic way by

958
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:25.959
having some Measurements of things, right? So, if we

959
00:53:25.959 --> 00:53:29.639
think about personality psychology, what personality psychologists try to

960
00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:34.399
do is look at the broad dimensions along which

961
00:53:34.399 --> 00:53:38.270
human behavior tends to vary. So one of those

962
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:41.669
would be, it's like extroversion introversion, that's a dimension

963
00:53:41.669 --> 00:53:45.080
along which people tend to vary. And it captures

964
00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:49.219
across the population and across many, many different contexts.

965
00:53:49.629 --> 00:53:52.909
It captures some patterns of behavior and allows you

966
00:53:52.909 --> 00:53:56.540
to kind of understand. In that context why someone

967
00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:59.500
who's more extroverted would tend to behave like this

968
00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:02.010
more often than not, right? But it's really statistical

969
00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:04.979
and it's really abstracted from particular contexts. In fact,

970
00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.179
that's the whole point is to get away from

971
00:54:07.179 --> 00:54:11.290
the particularities of any individual's life and any individual

972
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:15.580
situation context and instead see, here's the dimensions, here's

973
00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:19.370
the sort of broad Principles of human behavior. So,

974
00:54:19.659 --> 00:54:22.139
you know, if if I gave you a personality

975
00:54:22.139 --> 00:54:24.379
test and I have your scores in front of

976
00:54:24.379 --> 00:54:26.820
me right now, and then I, I wanted to

977
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.419
say, OK, hm, what's Ricardo likely to say next?

978
00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:32.580
Well, his conscientiousness score is 6 and his extraversion

979
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:37.500
score is 20. Uh, THAT has zero predictive power

980
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:39.939
for me, right? So the question of kind of

981
00:54:39.939 --> 00:54:43.280
what parameters would you need to get. Uh, IN

982
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:48.689
order to scientifically predict someone's behavior and ultimately, I

983
00:54:48.689 --> 00:54:52.360
think you'd have to collect all of the particularities

984
00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:55.050
of their history and all of the particularities of

985
00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:59.169
the context that they're in. In in such a

986
00:54:59.169 --> 00:55:03.209
way that it becomes so idiosyncratic, that it just

987
00:55:03.209 --> 00:55:06.360
doesn't become a scientific enterprise in the sense of

988
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.169
science looking for these abstract rules and principles that

989
00:55:09.169 --> 00:55:12.860
it can apply because it just becomes A web

990
00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:17.189
of particularities, right? So, um, so I'm not inclined

991
00:55:17.189 --> 00:55:20.580
to think that um we'll be able to make

992
00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:25.340
these kinds of predictions about anything. Complex, you know,

993
00:55:25.899 --> 00:55:28.979
it may be possible in a brain scanner to,

994
00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:31.820
you know, 100 milliseconds before somebody does it to

995
00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.540
predict whether they're going to flick their right hand

996
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:37.020
or their left hand. Fine. Like who cares? It

997
00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:39.659
doesn't help. Uh BUT but having, you know, more

998
00:55:39.659 --> 00:55:46.330
sophisticated kind of behavioral predictions. Uh, We can predict

999
00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:49.629
trends of behavior. We can sort of statistically predict

1000
00:55:49.629 --> 00:55:52.949
behaviors, um, but, you know, it's a question of

1001
00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:55.469
how does that help? I mean, for example, you

1002
00:55:55.469 --> 00:56:00.350
can predict statistically that you and I, because we

1003
00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:03.310
both have a Y chromosome, are more likely to

1004
00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:07.449
be violent, physically violent than people who don't. Now,

1005
00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:10.189
what are you gonna do with that information? Nothing.

1006
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:14.989
Were you gonna lock us up preemptively because we're

1007
00:56:14.989 --> 00:56:18.469
in the group of people who who commit 90%

1008
00:56:18.469 --> 00:56:19.389
of homicides.

1009
00:56:20.149 --> 00:56:23.840
Yeah, maybe minority report style or something like that,

1010
00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:26.389
yeah, exactly, so there's a lot of sort of

1011
00:56:26.389 --> 00:56:30.639
science fiction scenarios which can be appealed to. Uh,

1012
00:56:30.719 --> 00:56:33.280
BUT when you look at the actual science of,

1013
00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:35.840
of, of human behavior, what we have on the

1014
00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:38.879
one hand are these statistical aggregates and and and

1015
00:56:38.879 --> 00:56:41.840
patterns, and then on the other hand, the real

1016
00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:45.760
messy contextual particularities of any individual human's existence.

1017
00:56:46.689 --> 00:56:50.600
Yeah. So, uh, before we move on to other

1018
00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.129
topics, let me just ask you one last question

1019
00:56:53.129 --> 00:56:57.310
about your debates with Doctor Sapolsky. Did you change

1020
00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:01.270
your mind in any way, even if just a

1021
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:02.100
small way? Or,

1022
00:57:04.189 --> 00:57:06.070
you know, it would be good. I, it would

1023
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:08.189
seem like I were a good scientist, uh, if

1024
00:57:08.189 --> 00:57:10.070
I, if I did change my mind, right? I

1025
00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:13.229
should be open to having my mind changed, um.

1026
00:57:14.729 --> 00:57:18.870
I didn't change my position. I changed the way

1027
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:24.270
I think about. Talking about it, um, and you

1028
00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:27.810
know, it, it highlighted. I guess for me some

1029
00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:30.290
of the, the, the different views that people can

1030
00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:32.850
have, including not just Robert, but many, you know,

1031
00:57:32.929 --> 00:57:35.889
people in the audience of course of those debates

1032
00:57:35.889 --> 00:57:40.689
who um you know, also may bring something to

1033
00:57:40.689 --> 00:57:43.530
um to the debates and it might be a

1034
00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:44.969
kind of, you know, it might be this sort

1035
00:57:44.969 --> 00:57:49.040
of closet dualism. It might be a lack of

1036
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:52.429
um Uh, you know, belief in the concept of,

1037
00:57:52.439 --> 00:57:55.429
of, of emergence as a, as a naturalistic sort

1038
00:57:55.429 --> 00:57:58.429
of thing, or, you know, various other things like

1039
00:57:58.429 --> 00:58:01.110
hangups about mental causation, for example, like how could

1040
00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:03.750
a thought push material stuff around, those kinds of

1041
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:07.939
things. It's interesting to dig into the psychology, I

1042
00:58:07.939 --> 00:58:12.110
think, of free will skepticism because it often hangs

1043
00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:16.600
on underlying Things and notions of causation and things

1044
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.510
that aren't, uh, you have to, you have to

1045
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:22.439
excavate them a little bit. So, um, yeah, I

1046
00:58:22.439 --> 00:58:24.919
guess I learned those things. I don't, hm, did

1047
00:58:24.919 --> 00:58:27.719
I change my mind? Again, I should, I should

1048
00:58:27.719 --> 00:58:29.439
say I should find something to say I changed

1049
00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:32.600
my mind about. Um, I don't think I did

1050
00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.679
really, no.

1051
00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:36.909
I mean, even if we, if it was just

1052
00:58:36.909 --> 00:58:41.989
in terms of how you consider Doctor Sapolsky's arguments,

1053
00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:44.270
I mean, are you at least a little bit

1054
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:48.139
more sympathetic towards some of them, or

1055
00:58:48.429 --> 00:58:52.389
I'm, I think I understand where they're coming from

1056
00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:53.870
better and let me say, I mean, I, you

1057
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:57.149
know, I, Robert is a lovely guy, he's really

1058
00:58:57.149 --> 00:59:03.030
um I think genuine. Um, GUY and, um, you

1059
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:05.979
know, thoughtful, clearly, I, I don't agree with the

1060
00:59:06.189 --> 00:59:11.699
conclusions of his thinking, but, um. But yeah, you

1061
00:59:11.699 --> 00:59:14.050
know, I've I've enjoyed interacting with him and I

1062
00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:17.100
think he's, you know, it's his motivations are interesting

1063
00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:20.020
in the sense that I I I think you

1064
00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.310
know one of the reasons why he wants to

1065
00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:25.540
argue against free will is um this idea that

1066
00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:28.540
we're constantly blaming people, right? So, and I think

1067
00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:31.020
it's it's colored by the American system in which

1068
00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:35.790
he's embedded. That um there's this sort of meritocratic

1069
00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:39.429
view there where, you know, if you're successful, it's,

1070
00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:42.909
it's because you worked hard and you obviously deserve

1071
00:59:42.909 --> 00:59:45.429
your success because you have it, right? That's the

1072
00:59:45.429 --> 00:59:48.699
sort of the the tautology of the meritocratic argument.

1073
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:52.169
And if you're poor and um you know, you're,

1074
00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:55.544
it's just because you've made bad choices. AND you

1075
00:59:55.544 --> 00:59:57.385
should be blamed for that. And in a sense,

1076
00:59:57.425 --> 01:00:00.344
you shouldn't be entitled to any help, right, or

1077
01:00:00.344 --> 01:00:03.824
sympathy. And that's what he's kind of um arguing

1078
01:00:03.824 --> 01:00:06.304
against. I think that's his underlying motivation and it

1079
01:00:06.304 --> 01:00:08.024
goes all the way to the to the legal

1080
01:00:08.024 --> 01:00:11.425
system in terms of, um, you know, his argument

1081
01:00:11.425 --> 01:00:14.814
that we should take into account people's prior circumstances

1082
01:00:14.814 --> 01:00:17.939
and history and so on. But Um, so I'm

1083
01:00:17.939 --> 01:00:20.340
completely sympathetic to, to all of that, and I

1084
01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.820
think it's absolutely important to understand that, you know,

1085
01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:26.540
people in poverty, for example, don't have the same

1086
01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.939
degree of freedom as people who have more resources

1087
01:00:29.939 --> 01:00:33.699
and a luxury of more time and uh social

1088
01:00:33.699 --> 01:00:37.050
safety nets and financial safety nets that allow them

1089
01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.709
the freedom to make better choices and longer term,

1090
01:00:39.909 --> 01:00:41.590
you know, follow longer term goals and so on,

1091
01:00:41.659 --> 01:00:43.760
right? So I think all of that is really

1092
01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.040
important, um, but for me what that highlights is

1093
01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.600
that free will is not an all or none

1094
01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.639
thing. It's a graded thing, right? And it's important

1095
01:00:52.639 --> 01:00:55.639
to understand precisely for the reasons that Robert is

1096
01:00:55.639 --> 01:01:01.530
articulating why some people's freedom is is constrained by.

1097
01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:06.370
External circumstances but also by their internal constitution, right?

1098
01:01:06.449 --> 01:01:11.020
You know, someone may be genetically and developmentally more

1099
01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:14.340
impulsive than somebody else. And so, you know, should

1100
01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.659
we blame them for that? That's a, that's a

1101
01:01:17.659 --> 01:01:20.250
valid kind of discussion to have and it's an

1102
01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:23.179
interesting argument um to have and in fact my

1103
01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:26.699
prior book uh innate was all about how the

1104
01:01:26.699 --> 01:01:29.659
way our brain is wired shapes shapes who we

1105
01:01:29.659 --> 01:01:31.580
are in ways that are really innate that we

1106
01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:35.709
didn't choose, right? Um, THE problem is when Robert

1107
01:01:35.709 --> 01:01:39.939
goes all the way to the extreme metaphysical position

1108
01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:42.469
that nobody has any agency or free will at

1109
01:01:42.469 --> 01:01:46.590
any moment ever, then he completely undercuts the argument

1110
01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:48.989
that he wants to make. Like if everyone's at

1111
01:01:48.989 --> 01:01:52.949
zero, what comparison are you drawing? What contrast are

1112
01:01:52.949 --> 01:01:56.340
you drawing between people with lots of freedom and

1113
01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:59.429
and to exercise their agency and people with lower

1114
01:01:59.429 --> 01:02:01.959
freedom. If everyone's at zero, it doesn't. It just

1115
01:02:01.959 --> 01:02:05.399
doesn't seem to make any sense. So I'm very

1116
01:02:05.399 --> 01:02:08.520
sympathetic to the The notion that we should take

1117
01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.879
into account people's uh circumstances both sort of internally

1118
01:02:12.879 --> 01:02:18.139
and externally, in considering their behavior. In a way

1119
01:02:18.139 --> 01:02:19.699
I think we already do that. I mean the

1120
01:02:19.699 --> 01:02:22.090
legal system already does that, right? The legal system

1121
01:02:22.090 --> 01:02:26.179
already differentiates between minors and adults because we know

1122
01:02:26.179 --> 01:02:29.580
that the minors have less behavioral control. It differentiates

1123
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:33.379
between schizophrenics and healthy people, between people with drug

1124
01:02:33.379 --> 01:02:36.219
addiction or not and it differentiates between people who

1125
01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:38.620
were, you know, had a history of abuse and

1126
01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:44.000
neglect as children versus didn't. So, um. Yeah, I

1127
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.479
just don't think we need to go to push

1128
01:02:46.479 --> 01:02:50.399
the, the, take the, the metaphysical nuclear option to

1129
01:02:50.399 --> 01:02:53.800
make those points. I think, in fact, it, it

1130
01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.360
undermines making those points when you, when you do

1131
01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:56.639
that.

1132
01:02:57.709 --> 01:03:00.489
So just to close off this section on free

1133
01:03:00.489 --> 01:03:04.850
will, how do you think we should reframe the

1134
01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:09.010
free will debate in science? Because as far as

1135
01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:12.429
I understand it, it tends to start from a

1136
01:03:12.429 --> 01:03:13.959
determinist position.

1137
01:03:15.399 --> 01:03:20.270
Yeah, OK, so, um, It does. And so the

1138
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:21.919
first thing I'll say is that, is that yes,

1139
01:03:21.949 --> 01:03:23.389
we can just get rid of that, right? OK,

1140
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:27.270
so um I have a paper out um now

1141
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:30.790
on the archive with um my student Henry Potter

1142
01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:34.110
and George Ellis, who's a very eminent physicist. Which

1143
01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:37.550
is just collecting all of the evidence that physics

1144
01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:40.149
is not in fact deterministic, right? It's not deterministic

1145
01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:42.629
at quantum levels and it's not deterministic at classical

1146
01:03:42.629 --> 01:03:45.110
levels either and it never has been. It's just

1147
01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:49.300
an assumption or an idealization that's useful mathematically sometimes,

1148
01:03:49.629 --> 01:03:51.750
um, but there's no, it's not a result of

1149
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:54.949
physics. So the idea that we need to start

1150
01:03:54.949 --> 01:03:58.149
this debate on that turf is just wrong. We

1151
01:03:58.149 --> 01:04:00.669
don't we, that's not an accurate picture of what

1152
01:04:00.669 --> 01:04:04.139
the universe is like. So instead we have to

1153
01:04:04.139 --> 01:04:06.639
flip that and say, OK, well, actually in a

1154
01:04:06.639 --> 01:04:10.620
universe where there's this low level indeterminacy, where the

1155
01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:13.169
future is open and many things could happen, well,

1156
01:04:13.179 --> 01:04:15.409
now how does, how, how do you get a

1157
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:18.340
uh an agent with some control in that kind

1158
01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:21.139
of a system, right? How does an agent make

1159
01:04:21.139 --> 01:04:23.340
happen what it wants to happen in this big

1160
01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:27.620
possibility space and that reframing, I think, um, kind

1161
01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:33.820
of highlights the notion of emergent microscopic organization where

1162
01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:37.419
entities at higher levels have powers unto themselves that

1163
01:04:37.419 --> 01:04:40.620
constrain things lower down, and that's a flip uh

1164
01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:44.610
away from this bottom up reductive causation view. Um,

1165
01:04:44.659 --> 01:04:46.580
AND, and, and it also, you know, allows us

1166
01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:49.449
to take a kind of a more historical view

1167
01:04:49.449 --> 01:04:52.139
of, of the emergence of these things both evolutionarily

1168
01:04:52.139 --> 01:04:56.459
and within an individual's lifetime in terms of accumulating.

1169
01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.100
Um, CAUSAL potential as I was talking about earlier.

1170
01:05:00.219 --> 01:05:03.820
So that's, um, that's one aspect of I think

1171
01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:06.699
reframing the free will debate within science. But the

1172
01:05:06.699 --> 01:05:09.729
other aspect would be to just get over it,

1173
01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:11.899
right? You just get over the yes or no

1174
01:05:11.899 --> 01:05:15.739
question and say uh let's just agree yes and

1175
01:05:15.739 --> 01:05:18.580
then ask what in what way, right? And what

1176
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.899
does it mean? Uh, WHAT are the systems that

1177
01:05:20.899 --> 01:05:23.060
enable that and if you just like the easiest

1178
01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:25.370
thing to do is just replace free will with

1179
01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:30.600
Executive function or behavioral control or decision making or

1180
01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.600
action selection or whatever those kinds of things are,

1181
01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:34.790
right? And actually get down to the nuts and

1182
01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:39.080
bolts in a way that um doesn't get hung

1183
01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:44.280
up on metaphysics and can be operationalized like we

1184
01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:49.120
talked about earlier in artificial systems, right? So it

1185
01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.199
just, it just means that we can just get

1186
01:05:51.199 --> 01:05:53.360
down to it, to a to a science of

1187
01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.439
free will. Without, uh, you know, once, once we

1188
01:05:57.439 --> 01:06:01.159
get the clear, clear the metaphysical brush, uh, out

1189
01:06:01.159 --> 01:06:01.629
of the way.

1190
01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:06.610
Mhm. So let's get now into your recent paper,

1191
01:06:06.739 --> 01:06:10.820
the genomic code, the genome instantiates a generative model

1192
01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:14.860
of the organism. So how do you apply the

1193
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:19.330
concept of a generative model in this particular case?

1194
01:06:19.659 --> 01:06:21.729
Yeah, so, um, this is a paper I'm really

1195
01:06:22.169 --> 01:06:24.820
excited about. Uh, IT was with Nick Cheney who's

1196
01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.699
at the University of Vermont in the Department of

1197
01:06:27.699 --> 01:06:31.320
Computer Science. And so, It came about because I've,

1198
01:06:31.399 --> 01:06:35.280
uh, as a developmental biologist and geneticist, um, I've

1199
01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.800
always been concerned with the question of how the

1200
01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.959
genome instantiates the form of the organism, right? So

1201
01:06:40.959 --> 01:06:43.239
you can ask the question like why, and this

1202
01:06:43.239 --> 01:06:46.399
goes back to Aristotle. Why do kittens, why do

1203
01:06:46.399 --> 01:06:48.879
cats have kittens and dogs have puppies? Why is

1204
01:06:48.879 --> 01:06:51.510
that, right? And it sounds like a stupid naive

1205
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:53.909
kind of question to ask and that people kind

1206
01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:56.429
of go, what are you even talking about? But

1207
01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.229
it comes down to the question of like if

1208
01:06:58.229 --> 01:07:02.469
you have a fertilized cat zygote and a fertilized

1209
01:07:02.469 --> 01:07:06.149
dog zygote, like where's the information that determines how

1210
01:07:06.149 --> 01:07:09.310
those things are going to develop? Where's the cattiness

1211
01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:12.030
or the or the or the dogginess. And of

1212
01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:14.550
course, um, a lot of that is is down

1213
01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:17.350
to the genetic information in the genome as a

1214
01:07:17.350 --> 01:07:20.820
whole. Now, let me just say, of course it

1215
01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:22.580
needs an egg, of course it needs the right

1216
01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.340
environment. There are lots of things that are given

1217
01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.580
by the environment that are important and crucial for

1218
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.139
development to happen along typical lines that aren't encoded

1219
01:07:31.139 --> 01:07:32.830
in the genome and they don't have to be,

1220
01:07:32.939 --> 01:07:36.149
right? They're just, they're just given so that the

1221
01:07:36.149 --> 01:07:38.110
evolution doesn't have to do any effort to pack

1222
01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:40.780
that information into the genome. OK, so given that

1223
01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:44.310
context, cats will develop uh cat egg will develop

1224
01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.360
as a cat because it has cat DNA, right,

1225
01:07:46.379 --> 01:07:48.610
if it didn't, it wouldn't. So the question is

1226
01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:51.129
like, how can we think about that? And um

1227
01:07:51.129 --> 01:07:53.810
there there's a long history of ways of thinking

1228
01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:55.689
about that. You can think of terms like a

1229
01:07:55.689 --> 01:07:59.209
blueprint. That's a very common metaphor for the, the

1230
01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:02.520
DNA. And it's bad, like it's a bad metaphor

1231
01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:06.449
for several reasons. One is, um, a blueprint, if

1232
01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:08.229
you think of like a blueprint of a house,

1233
01:08:08.379 --> 01:08:11.090
it has this isomorphic relationship to the house, that

1234
01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:14.780
is bits of the blueprint. Uh, MATCH bits of

1235
01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.939
the house and the, the scaled layout of the

1236
01:08:17.939 --> 01:08:20.299
blueprint matches the layout of the house at a

1237
01:08:20.299 --> 01:08:23.740
different scale, right? So, nothing like that is there

1238
01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:26.299
in the genome with the phenotype of the organism.

1239
01:08:26.339 --> 01:08:28.459
There's no such relationship between a bit of the

1240
01:08:28.459 --> 01:08:31.660
genome and my little finger and another bit of

1241
01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:33.819
the genome and my eyeball and stuff like that,

1242
01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:37.410
right? So a blueprint metaphor falls down pretty quickly,

1243
01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:41.379
but also A blueprint uh shows you what the

1244
01:08:41.379 --> 01:08:44.180
final product should look like, but doesn't show you

1245
01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.339
how to build it, right? It's not a builder's

1246
01:08:46.339 --> 01:08:48.859
plan for how to get there. So that's what

1247
01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:51.060
the organism needs is a plan for how to

1248
01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.830
generate the thing that it wants to do, right?

1249
01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.020
So some people have used the idea of a

1250
01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:59.988
program. I think we can say there is a

1251
01:08:59.988 --> 01:09:02.548
developmental program in the sense that there's a series

1252
01:09:02.548 --> 01:09:04.758
of steps that tend to happen in embryo genesis.

1253
01:09:04.798 --> 01:09:08.198
You get gastrulation and then you get, uh, you

1254
01:09:08.198 --> 01:09:10.917
know, uh, the neural tube forms and then, you

1255
01:09:10.917 --> 01:09:12.917
know, all these steps happen in a, in a

1256
01:09:12.917 --> 01:09:16.167
certain order. So that's one meaning of the term

1257
01:09:16.167 --> 01:09:18.679
program. It's just a set of steps that happen

1258
01:09:18.679 --> 01:09:21.810
according to a certain schedule. But of course the

1259
01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:25.370
program uh invokes or evokes the idea of a

1260
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:28.169
computer program, right? This highly algorithmic thing where there's

1261
01:09:28.169 --> 01:09:31.689
a series of steps laid out, written really clearly

1262
01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:35.220
and separately. Um, THAT'S just run through in, in

1263
01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:37.060
series. And again, if you look in the genome,

1264
01:09:37.379 --> 01:09:40.189
you don't find a step that's written in one

1265
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:43.419
part of the genome that says gastrulate and another

1266
01:09:43.419 --> 01:09:45.580
step here that says neolate or make a brain

1267
01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:48.540
or whatever, right? So, so that view also kind

1268
01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:51.299
of um falls down and, and both the blueprint

1269
01:09:51.299 --> 01:09:56.060
and the program also. So really deterministic, right? Like

1270
01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:59.500
there's just, it's just algorithmic or it's just this

1271
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.259
clear kind of mapping, right? So those things are

1272
01:10:02.259 --> 01:10:06.810
not um good models either. Um, AND what we're

1273
01:10:06.810 --> 01:10:09.089
appealing to here is a different notion which is

1274
01:10:09.089 --> 01:10:13.330
really inspired by machine learning and by neuroscience as

1275
01:10:13.330 --> 01:10:15.959
well and it's the notion of a generative model.

1276
01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:18.649
And we're all familiar with that these days because

1277
01:10:18.649 --> 01:10:22.490
that's what chat GPT is, the generative model of

1278
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:25.370
language. Um, THAT'S what mid journey is, is a

1279
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:29.089
generative model of, of images, right? And the way

1280
01:10:29.089 --> 01:10:31.649
that that works is a model, say for, for

1281
01:10:31.649 --> 01:10:34.720
image generation is trained on lots and lots of

1282
01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:38.479
images that usually are um labeled in some way.

1283
01:10:38.569 --> 01:10:40.939
So um that's when we're doing, you know, when

1284
01:10:40.939 --> 01:10:43.810
you do the captcha thing that says tick all

1285
01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:46.089
the boxes with a bridge or a fire hydrant

1286
01:10:46.089 --> 01:10:49.720
or something like that, we're training these uh things

1287
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:54.029
for their, for their image recognition, right? So the

1288
01:10:54.029 --> 01:10:57.069
original kind of things were image classifiers, right, so

1289
01:10:57.069 --> 01:10:58.549
they could be trained on lots of pictures of

1290
01:10:58.549 --> 01:11:02.220
different things, dogs, cats, horses, houses, whatever, right? Told

1291
01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.830
what they are, and then they build these uh

1292
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:09.979
kind of compressed representations that distinguish these different categories.

1293
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:13.310
So the, the point of that is that they're

1294
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:18.870
abstracting general uh information about the pattern of dogginess

1295
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:22.100
versus cattiness, say. So that when they see a

1296
01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:23.919
new picture of a dog or a cat, they

1297
01:11:23.919 --> 01:11:27.080
can fit it into these high level abstract categories.

1298
01:11:27.879 --> 01:11:30.009
And then, of course, uh what happened was people

1299
01:11:30.009 --> 01:11:31.669
were using that to say, well actually I can

1300
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:33.850
use this to do it in reverse and make

1301
01:11:33.850 --> 01:11:35.569
a new picture of a dog, or a new

1302
01:11:35.569 --> 01:11:37.410
picture of a cat. So that's when it becomes

1303
01:11:37.410 --> 01:11:41.290
a generative model, they use that abstract compressed representation

1304
01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:44.970
of dogginess. Uh, TO generate a new picture of

1305
01:11:44.970 --> 01:11:47.850
a dog, right, a novel instance of that species.

1306
01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:51.160
And it struck me on hearing uh a description

1307
01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.700
of that one time. Um, YOU know, I was

1308
01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.100
listening to that and I was like, OK, so

1309
01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:58.899
that compressed representation is is like the genome. And

1310
01:11:58.899 --> 01:12:00.000
then I thought about it a bit more and

1311
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.419
I was like, wait, it's like it's really like

1312
01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:05.339
the genome. I mean that's this idea of of

1313
01:12:05.339 --> 01:12:09.899
uh accumulating. Through training in, in which, you know,

1314
01:12:09.979 --> 01:12:13.890
the analogy is now with evolution, a compressed representation,

1315
01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:17.819
which is a generative model that allows you to

1316
01:12:17.819 --> 01:12:20.859
decompress through development and generate a new instance of

1317
01:12:20.859 --> 01:12:23.750
a species, uh, that just seems to be a

1318
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:28.049
really apt analogy. And so in this paper, We,

1319
01:12:28.089 --> 01:12:30.029
we push on that bit and try and see

1320
01:12:30.029 --> 01:12:33.049
does this actually make sense? Because look, we're both

1321
01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:37.089
of us are highly aware of the um the

1322
01:12:37.089 --> 01:12:40.850
temptation to just appeal to the latest technology as

1323
01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:42.890
a metaphor for something in biology, right? I mean

1324
01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:45.830
there's a long history of doing that in neuroscience

1325
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:50.370
and genetics. Um, AND so we're very wary of

1326
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:53.709
taking this sort of naive metaphor and just, and

1327
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:55.509
just running with it. So what we do in

1328
01:12:55.509 --> 01:12:56.770
the paper is try and push on it a

1329
01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:59.259
bit and say, you know, does it make sense

1330
01:12:59.259 --> 01:13:01.430
to think of the genome as a generative model?

1331
01:13:01.709 --> 01:13:05.549
Is the information there in this kind of compressed

1332
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:08.910
representation where there are, you know, it's the details

1333
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:11.640
are not in there. What's in there is a

1334
01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.839
set of relations that's highly distributed. It's not localized,

1335
01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:20.839
it's not isomorphic. It's really um distributed again in

1336
01:13:20.839 --> 01:13:23.799
the same way that the representations within machine learning

1337
01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:27.259
um systems are. Where there are sort of, you

1338
01:13:27.259 --> 01:13:31.060
know, concepts of things like latent spaces and latent

1339
01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:34.689
variables in these representational spaces that become super useful.

1340
01:13:34.779 --> 01:13:37.500
And those are useful in machine learning. They're useful

1341
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.740
in neuroscience as well because in neuroscience we also

1342
01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:44.290
have we appeal to generative models when we, you

1343
01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:47.209
know, we were talking earlier about simulating. The outcomes

1344
01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:50.359
of our actions. We can simulate, you know, moving

1345
01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:53.720
within the world. That, that's employing a generative model

1346
01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.520
to imagine where we would be, what, what our

1347
01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.919
situation would be if we moved from here to

1348
01:13:57.919 --> 01:14:01.770
there, right? So, um, so that kind of concept

1349
01:14:02.399 --> 01:14:05.009
it just feels really powerful and to me it

1350
01:14:05.009 --> 01:14:08.259
feels very apt in terms of thinking about the

1351
01:14:08.259 --> 01:14:11.089
genome because it gets away from these really direct

1352
01:14:11.089 --> 01:14:13.970
1 to 1 mapping between bits of the genome

1353
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:17.299
and bits of the phenotype and instead it it

1354
01:14:17.299 --> 01:14:22.194
captures the much more distributed collective. Um, SORT of

1355
01:14:22.194 --> 01:14:26.794
holistic, uh, nature of those relationships and also the

1356
01:14:26.794 --> 01:14:29.154
somewhat plastic nature of them in that as they're

1357
01:14:29.154 --> 01:14:34.055
being decompressed, you know, development is this process where

1358
01:14:34.055 --> 01:14:36.595
the the the the organism is trying to kind

1359
01:14:36.595 --> 01:14:39.334
of progressively interpret the the the model as it

1360
01:14:39.334 --> 01:14:42.419
goes along. Uh, IN ways that are variable, right?

1361
01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:45.859
So a lot of these, um, machine learning systems

1362
01:14:45.859 --> 01:14:51.830
like variational autoencoders. HAVE variation within them, right, and

1363
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:55.189
they use that to generate a new instance of

1364
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:59.060
a dog that has some variability from this abstract

1365
01:14:59.299 --> 01:15:02.520
form. And of course that's what development does all

1366
01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.759
the time because you don't have to add the

1367
01:15:04.759 --> 01:15:07.120
noise, the noise is already in there. It's just

1368
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:12.029
in the processes of of molecular um jigglings around

1369
01:15:12.029 --> 01:15:14.189
like we talked about earlier in the nervous system.

1370
01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.319
So, so what development does is decompress that uh

1371
01:15:18.319 --> 01:15:22.319
representation, but in a, in a completely idiosyncratic way

1372
01:15:22.319 --> 01:15:24.890
every time it runs it. Right, so you can

1373
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:27.330
start with the exact same genome and you won't

1374
01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:29.520
get the exact same outcome, but you get something

1375
01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:31.649
sort of pretty close. So, so that was the

1376
01:15:31.649 --> 01:15:35.930
sort of um what engendered the um The the

1377
01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:38.129
analogy and we, you know, there's a bunch more

1378
01:15:38.129 --> 01:15:41.160
in that paper that um pushes on it in

1379
01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:43.169
in different ways and sees what it has to

1380
01:15:43.169 --> 01:15:43.529
offer.

1381
01:15:44.419 --> 01:15:46.069
Yeah, and I'm going to ask you a little

1382
01:15:46.069 --> 01:15:47.919
bit more about that, but I mean, when it

1383
01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:52.709
comes to, let's say that your generative model account

1384
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:57.390
is the correct one. Uh, HOW should we put

1385
01:15:57.390 --> 01:16:02.740
this perhaps in slightly more simpler terms, uh, to

1386
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:07.709
scientifically communicate this to lay people? Because I mean,

1387
01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:11.899
uh, uh, as you pointed to earlier, people tend

1388
01:16:11.899 --> 01:16:16.830
to have these very simplistic, uh, idea or picture

1389
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:21.029
of one gene corresponds to one trait or perhaps

1390
01:16:21.029 --> 01:16:23.964
a bunch of genes correspond to one trait. Or

1391
01:16:23.964 --> 01:16:29.064
perhaps there are traits that are produced or perhaps

1392
01:16:29.064 --> 01:16:32.104
some genes play a role in different kinds of

1393
01:16:32.104 --> 01:16:35.464
traits, but, uh, how do we move from that

1394
01:16:35.464 --> 01:16:39.705
kind of simplistic picture to what you're painting there?

1395
01:16:39.865 --> 01:16:43.705
Yeah, it's really tricky because um I mean the

1396
01:16:43.705 --> 01:16:46.225
appeal of a blueprint, for example, is it's it's

1397
01:16:46.225 --> 01:16:49.944
familiar, right? So if you're looking for a sort

1398
01:16:49.944 --> 01:16:54.950
of a science communication metaphor. Then obviously appealing to

1399
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:58.350
something familiar that people already understand and saying this,

1400
01:16:58.589 --> 01:17:01.229
this complicated thing is like that, and you already

1401
01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:03.549
understand that, therefore you can grasp what this is,

1402
01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:04.950
right? I mean, that's the sort of the essence

1403
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:10.790
of communication by by analogy. Um, THE trouble is

1404
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:12.310
like all of the simple ones that people are

1405
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:15.310
familiar with don't work. They're not apt. They're too

1406
01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:18.830
simple. And so the the generative model idea is

1407
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:22.589
really um tricky and difficult to understand and you

1408
01:17:22.589 --> 01:17:25.189
know, we know it is because the people who've

1409
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:29.890
done this trained these machine learning models. Now have

1410
01:17:29.890 --> 01:17:32.330
to do the work of understanding what the representations

1411
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:34.970
are inside them, right? So we've created this thing

1412
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:37.410
for the first time ever in our existence. We've

1413
01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:40.689
created artificial systems that we don't understand how they

1414
01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:43.850
work. It's it's incredible, right? We're having, there's now

1415
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:46.979
a natural science of these systems and people are

1416
01:17:46.979 --> 01:17:48.930
working on lots of different ways to sort of

1417
01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:52.620
increase the interpret interpretability of of the encodings and

1418
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:53.729
and so on so that we can get a

1419
01:17:53.729 --> 01:17:57.209
better grasp on them, but Uh, but the point

1420
01:17:57.209 --> 01:18:01.209
is it's actually just genuinely very complex, and you

1421
01:18:01.209 --> 01:18:07.209
get into these, um, really subtle, um, complicated ideas

1422
01:18:07.209 --> 01:18:12.520
like, you know, latent latent spaces and um orthogonal

1423
01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:16.450
dimensions in this big multi-dimensional space within this compressed

1424
01:18:16.450 --> 01:18:20.250
representation. And there you're into like really abstract mathematical

1425
01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:22.850
objects. They're very hard to wrap your head around.

1426
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:26.910
Um, BUT they're crucial, I think, to understanding that

1427
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:31.830
we're seeing those mathematical concepts applied in neuroscience to

1428
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:34.149
great effect. We're seeing them applied in machine learning,

1429
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:35.740
and I think we can apply them in terms

1430
01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:39.270
of genomic encodings as well in really important ways.

1431
01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:43.419
So, um, Which we could talk about in a

1432
01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:46.220
minute, but they just on your real question like

1433
01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.180
communicating it, I think this is a challenge, right?

1434
01:18:48.259 --> 01:18:54.180
So how can we get that across, um. I,

1435
01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:55.890
I, I, I just don't think we can do

1436
01:18:55.890 --> 01:18:58.520
it quickly, frankly, I think it just may be

1437
01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:01.600
the case that this is an instance where the

1438
01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:06.069
reality is genuinely complex and it's gonna have to

1439
01:19:06.359 --> 01:19:09.359
take some explaining and people are gonna have to

1440
01:19:09.359 --> 01:19:12.589
sit with those ideas that are very uh foreign

1441
01:19:12.589 --> 01:19:16.200
alien sort of ways of thinking about things and

1442
01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.040
um, yeah, do some work to wrap their head

1443
01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:22.330
around it. There's no easy. There's no easy fix

1444
01:19:22.330 --> 01:19:24.330
here in terms of the communication, yeah.

1445
01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:28.120
Yeah, that's fair enough. So let me ask you

1446
01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:32.790
now, uh, tell us about these concepts coming from

1447
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:40.270
developmental biology, robustness and evolvability, and how do they

1448
01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:43.660
apply to the encoding we are talking about here?

1449
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:46.350
Yeah, so these are really, really crucial. These two,

1450
01:19:46.549 --> 01:19:50.020
these two properties of robustness and evolvability which sound

1451
01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:51.669
like they should be opposed to each other, but

1452
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:54.359
they're actually two sides of the same coin. So

1453
01:19:54.359 --> 01:19:56.859
we talked about earlier, you know, the noisiness in

1454
01:19:56.859 --> 01:20:01.600
um molecular systems and how what evolution has selected

1455
01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:07.399
for is is collectively robust microscopic organizations. That are

1456
01:20:07.399 --> 01:20:09.680
in a sense insensitive to all this sort of

1457
01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.919
momentary fluctuations going on within them, and instead they

1458
01:20:12.919 --> 01:20:17.439
managed to maintain a regime of activity, right? A

1459
01:20:17.439 --> 01:20:21.879
a regime of dynamical processes, um, that at a

1460
01:20:21.879 --> 01:20:25.720
microscopic scale is, is, is robust and persistent. So

1461
01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:28.495
you can think about a single cell, uh. Um,

1462
01:20:28.515 --> 01:20:30.805
A single-celled organism as trying to do that. And

1463
01:20:30.805 --> 01:20:33.075
of course what it does is react to changes

1464
01:20:33.075 --> 01:20:37.174
in its internal states through homeostatic mechanisms. So it

1465
01:20:37.174 --> 01:20:39.535
takes some sort of negative feedback. It says, oh

1466
01:20:39.535 --> 01:20:41.694
no, I've been pushed, I've been pushed out of

1467
01:20:41.694 --> 01:20:43.444
where I want to be. I need to take

1468
01:20:43.444 --> 01:20:45.524
this action to bring that back down to where

1469
01:20:45.524 --> 01:20:47.095
it should be, right? And that's basically what a

1470
01:20:47.095 --> 01:20:49.975
lot of metabolism is is doing and what the

1471
01:20:49.975 --> 01:20:52.564
responses to external cues and so on are for.

1472
01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:56.640
Now, in development, you have the same kind of

1473
01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.529
problem. It's just magnified because instead of one cell

1474
01:20:59.529 --> 01:21:02.649
state, you've got thousands and thousands of different cell

1475
01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:05.629
states that you have to make. Uh, YOU have

1476
01:21:05.629 --> 01:21:08.390
to make them all stable, right? Each of those

1477
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:10.750
states now is the, the sort of we got

1478
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:15.100
these multiplexed options encoded in the genome, right? Where

1479
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:19.069
the genome has to encode a liver cell state

1480
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:21.790
of some genes on and off as a stable

1481
01:21:21.790 --> 01:21:24.950
attractor, uh, in a dynamical system and it has

1482
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:26.770
to encode a muscle cell state and a nerve

1483
01:21:26.770 --> 01:21:28.669
cell and all these different like thousands and thousands,

1484
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:31.740
right? And of course it has to build them

1485
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.060
in the right order, in the right place with

1486
01:21:34.259 --> 01:21:36.220
with respect to each other, right? So that's the

1487
01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:39.100
magic of developmental biology, that's what developmental biologists have

1488
01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:43.580
been studying for centuries and um we know a

1489
01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:47.419
lot about the mechanisms whereby embryos get patterned, different

1490
01:21:47.419 --> 01:21:51.100
cells differentiate in response to different signals, um, how

1491
01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:56.009
gene expression is, is, um, you know, modulated and

1492
01:21:56.009 --> 01:21:59.040
um. And put into these different patterns and then

1493
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.609
and then stably held in those patterns so that

1494
01:22:01.609 --> 01:22:04.990
cell types remain what they are, right? So all

1495
01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:07.270
of that has to be robust and it has

1496
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:10.069
to be robust to noise in the first instance,

1497
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:12.740
right? You got all these molecular stuff jittering around,

1498
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:15.310
the systems have to be able to buffer some

1499
01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:18.779
variation there. Now the interesting thing is you get

1500
01:22:18.779 --> 01:22:21.140
something for free when you have a robust system

1501
01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:23.939
like that, which is evolvability. And the reason is

1502
01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.819
if the system is robust to all those molecular

1503
01:22:25.819 --> 01:22:29.700
jitterings, it should also be robust to some genetic

1504
01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:33.779
variation that maybe says, OK, maybe make a little

1505
01:22:33.779 --> 01:22:35.169
bit more of this protein or a little bit

1506
01:22:35.169 --> 01:22:37.859
less of that protein under these conditions. Now, the

1507
01:22:37.859 --> 01:22:41.669
cells already used to working with slight variations in

1508
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:43.819
the levels of different proteins at different times, right?

1509
01:22:43.899 --> 01:22:46.660
It's evolved to be robust to that. As a

1510
01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:50.089
consequence, what happens is genetic variation can build up

1511
01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:54.759
in the system. Without affecting the phenotype, right? So

1512
01:22:54.759 --> 01:22:59.680
the phenotype is is channeled into the sort of

1513
01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:04.229
broadly speaking, uh, an optimal outcome. Or at least

1514
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:08.700
a viable outcome. Despite all this noise. Now, that's

1515
01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:12.160
up until a point when the genetic variation does

1516
01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.479
begin to affect the phenotype and then you get

1517
01:23:14.479 --> 01:23:17.200
evolvability, then natural selection steps in and goes, yeah,

1518
01:23:17.439 --> 01:23:19.240
I like that, or I don't like that, it's

1519
01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:20.560
a little bit better, it's a little bit worse,

1520
01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:24.359
right? Um, SO, so you get this, uh, the

1521
01:23:24.359 --> 01:23:27.759
robustness allows genetic variation to build up in the

1522
01:23:27.759 --> 01:23:30.839
population. That becomes then the substrate for evolution. So

1523
01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:33.879
we don't have to think of evolution as this

1524
01:23:33.879 --> 01:23:37.930
kind of One step at a time, one big

1525
01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:41.439
hit, uh, one big mutation totally changes things, right?

1526
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:45.169
Um, WHERE like one mutation means lizards suddenly didn't

1527
01:23:45.169 --> 01:23:48.000
have legs and now they're snakes. And like, so

1528
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:50.250
mommy and daddy lizard gave birth to a snake.

1529
01:23:50.370 --> 01:23:52.729
That just isn't the way that evolution happens, right?

1530
01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:55.330
But it happens in in much more gradual kind

1531
01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:59.089
of a way where these collective encodings in the

1532
01:23:59.089 --> 01:24:04.240
genome. That are uh very distributed that are affecting

1533
01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:08.310
different traits. Can change over time because of genetic

1534
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:11.350
variation, and then evolution can have a say as

1535
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:13.229
to as to whether that's that's good or not.

1536
01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:17.959
So you get evolvability, you get gradual evolvability from

1537
01:24:17.959 --> 01:24:22.910
these two aspects, the distributed encoding and the accumulation

1538
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:26.270
of, of genetic variation because of the robustness of

1539
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:27.350
the developmental system.

1540
01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:31.220
So, and this is, I think, an idea that

1541
01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:34.660
comes from also from developmental biology, please correct me

1542
01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:39.879
if I'm wrong, but then development can constrain evolution,

1543
01:24:40.029 --> 01:24:42.060
at least to some extent. Yeah,

1544
01:24:42.299 --> 01:24:46.660
absolutely. So, um, you know, evolution is not evolution

1545
01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:51.180
is exploring a possibility and that possibility space is

1546
01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:56.140
determined by where you are now, right? So, um,

1547
01:24:59.290 --> 01:25:01.680
Yeah, I mean that just some people kind of

1548
01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:05.790
make this out like it's it overturns uh Darwinian

1549
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:10.959
notion so it's this big challenge to adaptationism um

1550
01:25:10.959 --> 01:25:12.879
and it isn't, it's just a sort of a

1551
01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:16.990
the context in which that happens, right? Of course,

1552
01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.339
I couldn't have a mutation like uh Angel in

1553
01:25:20.339 --> 01:25:22.799
the X-Men and just sprout wings from my back,

1554
01:25:22.919 --> 01:25:26.200
right, because that phenotype is not available uh to

1555
01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:29.560
me, OK. Um, I could have a mutation that

1556
01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:32.729
gives, gives like web fingers. That's a, that's a

1557
01:25:32.729 --> 01:25:36.479
phenotype that's available from my current generative model. I

1558
01:25:36.479 --> 01:25:38.720
could get from A to B, right? By tweaking

1559
01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.350
the generative model a little bit, you could get

1560
01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:42.919
there. So it's a question of saying, OK, what's

1561
01:25:42.919 --> 01:25:46.959
the current generative model? What's the form that that's

1562
01:25:46.959 --> 01:25:50.600
broadly instantiating? And if you tweak it, how can

1563
01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.959
you push that form in in in different ways,

1564
01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:58.109
right? So, um, so that's just the context of,

1565
01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:02.560
um, that, that shapes the possibility space for, for

1566
01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:05.279
evolution. And of course what's interesting there is that

1567
01:26:05.279 --> 01:26:08.790
every change that you get reshapes the possibility space.

1568
01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.959
So, um, that's why evolution is this open-ended creative

1569
01:26:14.959 --> 01:26:17.959
process is because the possibility space is not fixed.

1570
01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:23.629
It's, it's like you know the video game worlds

1571
01:26:23.629 --> 01:26:25.229
where as you move around in the world, it

1572
01:26:25.229 --> 01:26:28.149
populates new things. It's kind of like that, right?

1573
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:30.979
So we're moving through this possibility space, new options

1574
01:26:30.979 --> 01:26:33.899
become um become available and I think that's an

1575
01:26:33.899 --> 01:26:38.629
important way of thinking about the dynamics of evolution

1576
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:42.430
through time. It's, it's just Uh, it's a creative

1577
01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:43.069
process.

1578
01:26:43.939 --> 01:26:47.709
So I think you've already addressed this topic, at

1579
01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:51.669
least to some extent earlier and this probably also

1580
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:55.229
links to the concept of robustness again, but how

1581
01:26:55.229 --> 01:26:59.109
is then with all of these noise that we

1582
01:26:59.109 --> 01:27:02.629
have during the process of development, how is a

1583
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:07.750
new individual of a certain type produced reliably?

1584
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:14.700
Yeah, OK, so, um, yeah, again, the robustness is

1585
01:27:14.859 --> 01:27:20.910
uh is a selected property, a selective selected collective

1586
01:27:20.910 --> 01:27:24.569
property of the whole genome, right, where, um, and,

1587
01:27:24.589 --> 01:27:28.490
and the reason The the reason that it's there,

1588
01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:31.430
even though evolution is not trying to make things

1589
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:34.020
robust, it's just like the the the ones that

1590
01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:38.910
don't produce robust offspring don't. Persist, right, so it's

1591
01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:41.979
just a kind of an outcome of um of

1592
01:27:41.979 --> 01:27:49.129
evolution selecting for genomes that robustly produce viable offspring

1593
01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:53.020
given this background of of noisy components, right, so

1594
01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:55.979
robustness is just is just what emerges from that

1595
01:27:55.979 --> 01:27:59.020
from that process without having to be directly selected

1596
01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:03.240
for. Um, SO, yeah, so you can think of,

1597
01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:08.450
of the developmental processes as, as, as channeling development

1598
01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:13.080
towards a particular kind of phenotypic attractor state which

1599
01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:17.399
is just viable member of the species. And within

1600
01:28:17.399 --> 01:28:19.209
that, of course, there's gonna be lots of variations.

1601
01:28:19.290 --> 01:28:21.890
So for example, within humans, right, we're about, we

1602
01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:25.729
have an average species typical height. But there's lots

1603
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:27.689
of variation around that and that's fine because it

1604
01:28:27.689 --> 01:28:32.890
doesn't uh uh materially affect um survival or fitness

1605
01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:35.569
or how many offspring we have. Uh, FOR the

1606
01:28:35.569 --> 01:28:38.729
most part. So, um, so there can be lots

1607
01:28:38.729 --> 01:28:43.290
of variation that's simply tolerated in the phenotype. OK.

1608
01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:47.910
And then of course occasionally you'll get, you know,

1609
01:28:48.069 --> 01:28:52.310
big mutations or big disturbances to the system that

1610
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:54.870
produce an outcome that's less well tolerated, and those

1611
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:58.979
are conditions that we call diseases or disorders um

1612
01:28:59.189 --> 01:29:01.459
that do have an effect on, on fitness and

1613
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:03.830
and generally what happens is that then they tend

1614
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:06.919
to be selected against right so. We think of

1615
01:29:06.919 --> 01:29:10.240
evolution as this force of positive selection, where it's

1616
01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.160
shaping these cool new things. It's like, oh, look,

1617
01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:15.160
wings, that's cool. Let me positively select for whatever's

1618
01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:18.540
making wings, uh, or running faster or seeing farther,

1619
01:29:18.839 --> 01:29:20.430
you know, all those kinds of things, but actually,

1620
01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:25.479
you know, most of the evolutionary action is negative

1621
01:29:25.479 --> 01:29:29.080
selection. It's saying nope, nope, nope, don't like that,

1622
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:32.160
that's not good. Um, SO, uh, you know, it's

1623
01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:36.640
just, uh, keeping, keeping the, it's just maintenance basically,

1624
01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:39.200
it's like keeping a bad mutations out of the,

1625
01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.919
out of the gene pool. So that kind of

1626
01:29:41.919 --> 01:29:44.229
process is, is happening all the time and that's

1627
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:47.069
the reason why we have this the the genome

1628
01:29:47.069 --> 01:29:51.509
is being in a sense protected um because, because

1629
01:29:51.509 --> 01:29:53.830
really bad mutations that impair the robustness are being

1630
01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:55.339
selected against all the time.

1631
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:59.270
Mhm. I mean, when you use there the word

1632
01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:04.229
channel link, it came to mind the idea uh

1633
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:08.109
suggested by Conrad Weington of the epigenetic landscape. I

1634
01:30:08.109 --> 01:30:09.979
mean, there, is there a link there?

1635
01:30:10.270 --> 01:30:14.310
Yeah, absolutely. So um Conrad Waddington in the 1940s

1636
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:17.459
and 1950s, um, he was an embryologist and he

1637
01:30:17.459 --> 01:30:22.830
had some very prescient um ideas about the way

1638
01:30:22.830 --> 01:30:24.589
that development works and a lot of what I've

1639
01:30:24.589 --> 01:30:27.759
just been talking about is absolutely informed by his

1640
01:30:27.759 --> 01:30:31.140
thinking. So. He had this this structure called the

1641
01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:34.009
epigenetic landscape, which, you know, some of your listeners

1642
01:30:34.009 --> 01:30:35.569
may have seen. It's a, it's a kind of

1643
01:30:35.569 --> 01:30:40.169
like a rolling contoured hillside, I imagine, um, slightly

1644
01:30:40.169 --> 01:30:41.979
sloping down with a with a little ball at

1645
01:30:41.979 --> 01:30:44.160
the top and the ball kind of rolls down

1646
01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.250
and it can, it can go one way or

1647
01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:48.299
it can go the other way, but when it

1648
01:30:48.299 --> 01:30:49.529
goes one way or the other, it kind of

1649
01:30:49.529 --> 01:30:52.560
gets channeled into these, into these valleys. So what

1650
01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:55.319
those valleys represent is the is the possibility space

1651
01:30:55.319 --> 01:30:59.479
and in more modern terms, uh, in dynamical systems

1652
01:30:59.479 --> 01:31:02.520
talk, we would call those attractor states. And in

1653
01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:05.790
fact, um, Waddington actually used that term of attractors

1654
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:09.040
in, in the landscape. So he kind of um

1655
01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:13.580
prefigured in this just a visual metaphor, the kind

1656
01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:16.649
of thing that we now see in our really

1657
01:31:16.649 --> 01:31:21.319
formal mathematical models of cellular differentiation and and development,

1658
01:31:21.359 --> 01:31:25.209
right. So his idea was that those different states

1659
01:31:25.209 --> 01:31:28.390
could represent, say, a skin cell or a nerve

1660
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:32.029
cell, right? But the point is that you don't

1661
01:31:32.029 --> 01:31:35.189
want to have intermediate cell types, right, as development

1662
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:39.029
is happening, you want to channel individual cells down

1663
01:31:39.029 --> 01:31:43.290
one trajectory or another to these stable final states

1664
01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:47.100
that you then want to have maintained. Now, you

1665
01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:50.100
can sort of expand that, right? You can draw

1666
01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:52.379
way way back and say you can talk about

1667
01:31:52.379 --> 01:31:56.700
the whole phenotypic um the whole phenotype of the

1668
01:31:56.700 --> 01:32:00.399
organism as a tractor states, right? So. Um, YOU

1669
01:32:00.399 --> 01:32:02.560
know, having, having 5 fingers on your hand is

1670
01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.080
in a tractor state and development is trying to

1671
01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.640
channel things in such a way that that's a

1672
01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:10.560
robust outcome, despite the fact that we all have

1673
01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:14.319
mutations that affect the level of different proteins that

1674
01:32:14.319 --> 01:32:17.580
are involved in in signaling and growth, uh, of,

1675
01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:21.120
of different fingers and so on, right? So, um,

1676
01:32:22.259 --> 01:32:25.459
So yeah, so the, the, the job there of

1677
01:32:25.459 --> 01:32:29.669
the developmental system again is to robustly channel the

1678
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:32.149
outcome both at the level of individual cell types

1679
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:36.270
and morphogenesis of of of the whole system and

1680
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:39.229
um you know, I think obviously also the the

1681
01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:42.910
patterning of the brain. And the kind of, you

1682
01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:46.910
know, nature of the organism we've been talking so

1683
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:48.790
far about the form of the organism because that's

1684
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:51.149
the most kind of obvious thing to wrap your

1685
01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:53.310
head around, the form of a cat versus a

1686
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:55.490
dog. But there's also the nature of a cat

1687
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:58.390
versus a dog, and that is entailed in the

1688
01:32:58.390 --> 01:33:00.729
form of the of the of the brain, right?

1689
01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:03.470
The way that their brains are wired. And and

1690
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:05.910
so that becomes a really interesting idea to think

1691
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:10.879
about um. How evolution is now having an opinion

1692
01:33:11.319 --> 01:33:14.899
about the behavioral dispositions or tendencies or capacities of

1693
01:33:14.899 --> 01:33:17.839
different species and whether that's a good phenotype or

1694
01:33:17.839 --> 01:33:20.640
not. Be behavior becomes a phenotype that is judged.

1695
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:24.419
But the underlying substrate is the wiring of the

1696
01:33:24.419 --> 01:33:28.450
brain, which is just a special instance of the

1697
01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:31.370
genome, the generative model encoding the form of the

1698
01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:31.850
organism.

1699
01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:36.560
Is there any link between what you were explored

1700
01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:40.279
in this article and the biology of free will?

1701
01:33:42.359 --> 01:33:48.359
Um, I guess kind of very, very broadly conceptually,

1702
01:33:48.479 --> 01:33:51.540
there are some themes there that, um, that I

1703
01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:54.839
think are interesting. The theme of, of, you know,

1704
01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:58.959
noise and indeterminacy being harnessed in some way and

1705
01:33:58.959 --> 01:34:01.689
channeled. I think you can make you can make

1706
01:34:01.689 --> 01:34:05.680
some analogies uh with the kind of processes we

1707
01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:09.160
were talking about in in deliberation and decision making.

1708
01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:12.959
Um, You know, they're kind of, they're kind of

1709
01:34:12.959 --> 01:34:17.470
loose in, in one sense. I'm, I'm a little

1710
01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:22.640
undecided myself as to how um how tight or

1711
01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:26.680
formal those analogies are, um, but I do, you

1712
01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:29.080
know, I do think there are some there that

1713
01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:32.979
are that are interesting. Um, YOU know, one aspect

1714
01:34:32.979 --> 01:34:36.569
of free will that some people talk about is

1715
01:34:36.589 --> 01:34:39.270
is just genetic determinism where they'll say, look, we

1716
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:42.180
can show that your genes affect your personality traits,

1717
01:34:42.490 --> 01:34:46.310
um, therefore, you know, you were just genetically wired

1718
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:49.979
this way, it's just in your DNA right? And

1719
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:52.950
actually, you know, when you look at the way

1720
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:55.790
that development actually proceeds, what you can see is

1721
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:58.990
that the, the generative model in the genome constrains

1722
01:34:58.990 --> 01:35:03.830
the possibility space, but, but still uh tolerates some,

1723
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:07.509
some variation within that space. And so if you're

1724
01:35:07.509 --> 01:35:10.819
thinking about the wiring of the brain and our

1725
01:35:10.819 --> 01:35:15.750
personality predispositions, there's a, it's actually quite tolerable the

1726
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:18.430
way that those things uh emerge, right? And of

1727
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:21.350
course you know we won't fully understand uh we

1728
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:25.229
nearly understand the relationship between wiring of specific circuits

1729
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:27.669
and those and those high level personality traits, and

1730
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:30.270
they probably don't map to individual circuits, they're probably

1731
01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:35.370
more collective um properties, right? But anyway, at least

1732
01:35:35.370 --> 01:35:37.129
in terms of free will, we can say, look,

1733
01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:41.810
the genetic deterministic argument just fails because development is

1734
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:45.680
just not deterministic, it's probabilistic. And the relationship between

1735
01:35:45.930 --> 01:35:50.069
the genome and the eventual outcome. Has to go

1736
01:35:50.069 --> 01:35:52.910
through development. It's not a blueprint, right? It has

1737
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:56.540
to involve these processes. Those processes are inherently variable.

1738
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:59.709
And so, uh, at least we can say it's

1739
01:35:59.709 --> 01:36:01.509
not just your genes that made you the way

1740
01:36:01.509 --> 01:36:03.950
you are. Maybe it doesn't help because then you

1741
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:06.569
can just say, OK, well, it's the idiosyncratic way

1742
01:36:06.569 --> 01:36:08.629
that my brain developed that makes me the way

1743
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:11.819
you are. I am, and you know, that's fine,

1744
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:14.950
that may absolutely be true. It does get to

1745
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:18.330
a different question which is Uh, you know, in

1746
01:36:18.330 --> 01:36:22.649
terms of things like genomic predictions, how accurate they

1747
01:36:22.649 --> 01:36:25.169
could ever be, not just in practice based on

1748
01:36:25.169 --> 01:36:27.640
what we know, but in principle. Like the, the,

1749
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:29.850
the, the nature of the relationship between the genome

1750
01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:33.549
and the phenotype. IS just limited. There's other sources

1751
01:36:33.549 --> 01:36:36.189
of variants that we'll never be able to get

1752
01:36:36.189 --> 01:36:39.979
at, because they're inherently part of the noise of

1753
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.629
of development.

1754
01:36:42.509 --> 01:36:45.950
So, for the last part of our conversation today,

1755
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.470
I would like to ask you about a recent

1756
01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:53.220
paper you've written with Doctor Henry Greeley on human

1757
01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:56.009
embryo editing. I've had Doctor Greeley on the show

1758
01:36:56.009 --> 01:37:00.575
twice. We uh we focus mostly on the side

1759
01:37:00.575 --> 01:37:02.615
of things and perhaps a little bit on the

1760
01:37:02.615 --> 01:37:06.524
philosophy as well. So tell us about this paper

1761
01:37:06.814 --> 01:37:10.055
and how it might link also to the topics

1762
01:37:10.055 --> 01:37:13.765
you explore in the previous paper we talked about

1763
01:37:13.765 --> 01:37:15.285
the genomic one.

1764
01:37:15.575 --> 01:37:18.939
Yeah, so um. This paper which I wrote with

1765
01:37:18.939 --> 01:37:23.509
Hank Greeley and Shai Carmi was a response to

1766
01:37:23.509 --> 01:37:25.859
a paper that came out in Nature which was

1767
01:37:25.859 --> 01:37:30.939
arguing that um that using some sort of statistical

1768
01:37:30.939 --> 01:37:34.859
models of risk for various disorders that are based

1769
01:37:34.859 --> 01:37:40.910
on um genetics, genetic studies. That we could drastically

1770
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:43.629
reduce the risk of some common conditions like heart

1771
01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:48.350
disease, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, diabetes, if we edited the genomes

1772
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:53.169
of embryos in multiple sites. Now, The important thing

1773
01:37:53.169 --> 01:37:55.970
about a condition like schizophrenia is it's, it's quite

1774
01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:59.359
highly heritable, a lot of the variation between people

1775
01:37:59.569 --> 01:38:01.729
who get schizophrenia or don't is down to genetic

1776
01:38:01.729 --> 01:38:04.089
differences, but it's not like there's one gene, right?

1777
01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:07.140
It's not like cystic fibrosis where you could say,

1778
01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:09.850
OK, if I have an embryo, um, I can

1779
01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:13.649
genotype this one gene and I'll definitely know with

1780
01:38:13.649 --> 01:38:15.649
a 100% predictive power whether or not it will

1781
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:18.490
develop cystic fibrosis, right? So there are some genetic

1782
01:38:18.490 --> 01:38:22.169
conditions like that, but common conditions. Like schizophrenia, heart

1783
01:38:22.169 --> 01:38:23.930
disease, the ones I mentioned, are not like that.

1784
01:38:23.970 --> 01:38:27.319
They're polygenic. So many, many genetic variants influence them

1785
01:38:27.319 --> 01:38:31.649
and probably thousands, right? Probably thousands of genetic variants

1786
01:38:31.649 --> 01:38:36.209
across the whole genome. Collectively contribute to differences in

1787
01:38:36.209 --> 01:38:40.169
individual risk of these conditions and collectively they explain.

1788
01:38:41.330 --> 01:38:44.370
Some percentage of the variants, usually it's a low

1789
01:38:44.370 --> 01:38:47.490
percentage, right, you know, for schizophrenia, the, the sort

1790
01:38:47.490 --> 01:38:49.490
of the common variants that we know about in

1791
01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:53.160
the genome maybe captured about 10% of the variants.

1792
01:38:53.250 --> 01:38:56.310
OK. So against that backdrop, the argument was that

1793
01:38:56.310 --> 01:39:00.600
if you edit as few as 10 sites, 10

1794
01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.000
of those common sites, each of which has a

1795
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.080
tiny little effect by itself, you could make a

1796
01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:06.830
drastic reduction in risk and, you know, the strategy

1797
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:12.299
was to Identify sites where there was a rare

1798
01:39:12.299 --> 01:39:17.299
mutation. That seemed to be protective, where the common

1799
01:39:17.299 --> 01:39:20.620
allele at a locus was actually the risk allele,

1800
01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:23.259
where like 99% of the people in the population

1801
01:39:23.509 --> 01:39:25.709
carry the risk allele for schizophrenia, which is a

1802
01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:28.229
weird thing, but there are sites like that where

1803
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:32.720
there's a a very rare mutation. Uh, THAT'S, you

1804
01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:35.919
know, like at 1%, 2% in the population, where

1805
01:39:35.919 --> 01:39:37.640
people who carry that seem to have a lower

1806
01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:39.839
risk. OK, so they looked at those and they

1807
01:39:39.839 --> 01:39:42.899
said, well, look, most people don't carry those rare

1808
01:39:42.899 --> 01:39:45.479
protective mutations, so maybe we could edit a bunch

1809
01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:47.600
of those into an embryo and now it would

1810
01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.600
be kind of super protected against these conditions. And

1811
01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:56.020
they use some statistical models which are Very mathematically

1812
01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:58.870
simple. So they basically just say, OK, each one

1813
01:39:58.870 --> 01:40:03.379
of these has a reduction in risk, statistically speaking

1814
01:40:03.379 --> 01:40:05.229
and across everyone who who carries it, who we

1815
01:40:05.229 --> 01:40:09.319
surveyed so far, of like You know, you go

1816
01:40:09.319 --> 01:40:11.799
from a risk of of one as a baseline

1817
01:40:11.799 --> 01:40:15.729
to 0.98 or something like that, right. Uh, AND

1818
01:40:15.729 --> 01:40:17.890
then if we add them up, um, multiple ones,

1819
01:40:17.899 --> 01:40:20.100
we just add them up together and that reduces

1820
01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:22.290
the risk by, by a certain amount. And you

1821
01:40:22.290 --> 01:40:23.209
know, if you put 10 of them in it,

1822
01:40:23.290 --> 01:40:27.290
they, their model suggested a massive reduction. So the

1823
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:29.410
paper came out in Nature, it was by Peter

1824
01:40:29.410 --> 01:40:33.939
Viser and and others including Julian Savulescu, who's a

1825
01:40:33.939 --> 01:40:39.200
biomedical ethicist, um. And it was surprisingly gung ho.

1826
01:40:39.399 --> 01:40:41.520
Like it was absolutely, first of all, it was

1827
01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:44.959
just an imagined scenario where we could in the

1828
01:40:44.959 --> 01:40:48.350
first instance, make these edits in embryos using CRISPR

1829
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:51.240
technology or something else with perfect precision. OK, so,

1830
01:40:51.319 --> 01:40:54.600
so they're, they're just imagining there's no chance of

1831
01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:56.799
something weird happening which is not at all where

1832
01:40:56.799 --> 01:41:01.310
the technology currently is. But even with that, um,

1833
01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.879
you know, they also just sort of took their

1834
01:41:03.879 --> 01:41:08.459
statistical modeling at face value. And it just basically

1835
01:41:08.459 --> 01:41:13.899
ignores multiple possible complications and, and risks. The complications

1836
01:41:13.899 --> 01:41:17.140
are, we don't know how those uh what affects

1837
01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:19.759
those uh genetic variants will have when you put

1838
01:41:19.759 --> 01:41:22.609
them in combination with each other, right? There's no

1839
01:41:22.609 --> 01:41:25.770
reason to think of this relationship as linear. It's

1840
01:41:25.770 --> 01:41:29.100
just a handy statistical model, but everything I was

1841
01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:31.580
talking about earlier with the generative model, these decompressed,

1842
01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:36.450
or sorry, these compressed representations. Distributed devolved kind of

1843
01:41:36.450 --> 01:41:40.399
um systems where you know they're highly, highly non-linear.

1844
01:41:40.609 --> 01:41:42.850
That's why it's complicated to understand them. That's why

1845
01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:45.049
the people who make the machine learning models can't

1846
01:41:45.049 --> 01:41:49.330
interpret them because they're just very, very non-linear relationships

1847
01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:52.839
with individual aspects of the thing that they're generating,

1848
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:54.959
right? And that's the absolutely going to be the

1849
01:41:54.959 --> 01:41:57.689
same thing true with our genome. So it's a

1850
01:41:57.689 --> 01:42:01.390
really naive statistical uh approach to just say ah

1851
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:05.470
we can just treat these as individual, independent to

1852
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:08.029
put them into this linear model and there's no

1853
01:42:08.029 --> 01:42:11.430
good really empirical um support for that in terms

1854
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:14.799
of predicting for individuals. So there was that, there

1855
01:42:14.799 --> 01:42:19.279
was the danger of playotropy, which is this term

1856
01:42:19.279 --> 01:42:22.919
which means that a genetic variant that say uh

1857
01:42:22.919 --> 01:42:25.560
decreases risk of schizophrenia might do lots of other

1858
01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:27.879
things, right? It might affect lots of other traits.

1859
01:42:27.919 --> 01:42:30.120
It might increase risk of heart disease. It might

1860
01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:33.939
increase risk of cancer, right? So, um, we know

1861
01:42:33.939 --> 01:42:38.459
absolutely that many, many genetic variants are leotropic. They

1862
01:42:38.459 --> 01:42:40.899
affect lots of different traits. So each individual trait

1863
01:42:40.899 --> 01:42:43.259
is affected by lots of variants, but each individual

1864
01:42:43.259 --> 01:42:47.419
variant typically affects many traits. So given that complexity.

1865
01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:52.299
It's very hard to predict. Uh, A whole array

1866
01:42:52.299 --> 01:42:55.220
of possible unintended consequences that might arise if you

1867
01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:59.410
select for. Protective alleles versus schizophrenia. It was like,

1868
01:42:59.419 --> 01:43:01.709
OK, well, what comes with that? We don't know.

1869
01:43:02.250 --> 01:43:04.140
Uh BECAUSE we just don't have the, the, the

1870
01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:06.660
information on each of those either individually or definitely

1871
01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:10.580
not in combination. So those were sort of major

1872
01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:13.299
issues and especially with rare alleles, you know, these

1873
01:43:13.299 --> 01:43:16.580
are alleles, these rare protective alleles. Well, they may

1874
01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:18.939
be rare for a reason, right? I mean, we

1875
01:43:18.939 --> 01:43:23.020
talked about um negative selection, keeping a lid on,

1876
01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:27.169
keeping, you know, deleterious mutations at a low frequency.

1877
01:43:27.419 --> 01:43:29.859
Well, the corollary is if we see things that

1878
01:43:29.859 --> 01:43:33.640
are at a low frequency, maybe they're deleterious. And

1879
01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:35.319
so even if there may be a sort of

1880
01:43:35.319 --> 01:43:38.479
a beneficial aspect in terms of reducing risk of

1881
01:43:38.479 --> 01:43:42.189
some condition, it's quite possible that those rare alleles

1882
01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:45.399
do have some negative um effects that could go

1883
01:43:45.399 --> 01:43:49.640
along with them. So we were really concerned with

1884
01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:53.910
the tenor of this paper which, you know, took

1885
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:57.790
this kind of fanciful idea both technologically and statistically

1886
01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:02.330
and really made the the the argument that Not

1887
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:04.560
only is this a thing that we could do,

1888
01:44:04.890 --> 01:44:06.689
but it's a thing that we should do, right?

1889
01:44:06.759 --> 01:44:10.370
Ethically speaking, Savulescu makes this argument that any time

1890
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:13.120
we could intervene anywhere in a way that would

1891
01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.879
be seen as having some benefit, we must do

1892
01:44:15.879 --> 01:44:18.399
that, right? That's sort of his, his ethical stance.

1893
01:44:19.009 --> 01:44:23.049
Whereas like many other people, um, I would take

1894
01:44:23.049 --> 01:44:27.080
instead the precautionary principle as a guide and say

1895
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:30.729
first do no harm. And uh you know, another

1896
01:44:30.729 --> 01:44:34.009
way to put this would be, uh, don't fuck

1897
01:44:34.009 --> 01:44:37.970
about with a complex system and expect good things

1898
01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:41.220
to happen. You know, it's like genuinely complex. It's

1899
01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:43.729
not this thing you can't linearly decompose it into

1900
01:44:43.729 --> 01:44:46.209
these different bits. That's just not how it works.

1901
01:44:46.290 --> 01:44:49.839
That's not the nature of the relationship between genotype

1902
01:44:49.839 --> 01:44:54.259
and phenotype. So, um, yeah, we got a little

1903
01:44:54.729 --> 01:44:57.709
I, I, I guess exercised over the, the tone

1904
01:44:57.709 --> 01:45:00.790
of it because it just felt, um, it felt

1905
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:04.950
a bit irresponsible, frankly, and, um, and it also

1906
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:09.350
feeds into this sort of resurgence of eugenics that

1907
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:14.439
we're seeing these days. Which is weird, uh, and

1908
01:45:14.439 --> 01:45:18.189
it's really fundamentally based on an idea that we

1909
01:45:18.189 --> 01:45:23.350
have much more knowledge and much greater predictive power

1910
01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:26.790
based on uh genotypic information than we actually do

1911
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:28.759
have or ever could have.

1912
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Uh, IT'S interesting that you mentioned eugenics because I

1913
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.040
was actually going to ask you a little bit

1914
01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:38.240
about that. I mean, not necessarily about eugenics, but

1915
01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:44.250
about a specific claim made by certain pro-natalist eugenicists,

1916
01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:48.839
uh, about the traits that are probably even more

1917
01:45:48.839 --> 01:45:54.140
complex genetically than heart disease, even like intelligence, because

1918
01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:58.632
I've heard some of them claiming. That through in

1919
01:45:58.632 --> 01:46:04.993
vitro fertilization and then embryonic selection, they can select

1920
01:46:04.993 --> 01:46:09.232
for uh uh uh they can already select for

1921
01:46:09.232 --> 01:46:13.823
higher intelligence. But I mean, there are a bunch

1922
01:46:13.823 --> 01:46:17.433
of complications there. Probably the biggest one is the

1923
01:46:17.433 --> 01:46:21.223
fact that intelligence, I mean, it seems that there

1924
01:46:21.223 --> 01:46:27.255
are probably thousands of Different genes associated with IQ

1925
01:46:27.255 --> 01:46:30.226
and all of that. So, I mean, I don't

1926
01:46:30.226 --> 01:46:34.195
know how many genes they would have to select

1927
01:46:34.195 --> 01:46:37.855
for or add it to even increase IQ by

1928
01:46:37.855 --> 01:46:40.585
1 or 2 points. But, uh, I mean, apart

1929
01:46:40.585 --> 01:46:43.985
from that or uh adding to that, what, what

1930
01:46:43.985 --> 01:46:44.985
do you think

1931
01:46:44.985 --> 01:46:48.025
about it? Yeah, so I mean obviously IQ is

1932
01:46:48.025 --> 01:46:52.250
an obsession with um People and it goes along

1933
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:56.060
with certain sort of social stances that that are

1934
01:46:56.060 --> 01:47:02.180
uh problematic in multiple ways. So IQ first of

1935
01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:04.490
all is a is a proxy that we use.

1936
01:47:04.529 --> 01:47:06.759
It's a it's a, you know, a quantitative measure

1937
01:47:06.759 --> 01:47:09.850
derived from various tests. Uh, YOU know, some people

1938
01:47:09.850 --> 01:47:11.410
say it only measures how good you are at

1939
01:47:11.410 --> 01:47:13.290
taking IQ tests. I don't think that's right at

1940
01:47:13.290 --> 01:47:16.870
all. I think IQ actually does capture um some

1941
01:47:17.049 --> 01:47:21.060
aspects of of cognition. That differ between people in

1942
01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:23.819
ways that have important consequences in the world. OK.

1943
01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:25.740
So, so we've got this very, but we have

1944
01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:28.660
this very imperfect proxy of it. Now with that

1945
01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:32.259
proxy, people have done, you know, IQ tests or

1946
01:47:32.259 --> 01:47:35.620
other cognitive tests or even just taking things like

1947
01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:38.970
educational attainment, how far people go in in in

1948
01:47:38.970 --> 01:47:41.870
education. And then they've looked for genetic variants that

1949
01:47:41.870 --> 01:47:45.069
are associated with those differences, right? And that's the

1950
01:47:45.069 --> 01:47:47.830
same way that people found the genetic variants associated

1951
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:49.930
with things like risk of heart disease and schizophrenia,

1952
01:47:50.069 --> 01:47:53.000
right? So they look across the whole thousands or

1953
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:58.319
hundreds of thousands of people literally. For the sites

1954
01:47:58.319 --> 01:48:01.359
in the genome where there may be 22 variants

1955
01:48:01.359 --> 01:48:03.540
that exists, like some people might have an A,

1956
01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:05.990
some people might have a G in the sequence.

1957
01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:08.169
And then they say, do people with the A

1958
01:48:08.439 --> 01:48:10.560
end up at the higher end of the IQ

1959
01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:13.080
spectrum or with greater educational attainment than people with

1960
01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:15.390
the G, right? So they do that across thousands

1961
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:17.520
and thousands and thousands of sites across the genome,

1962
01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:19.939
and then they find a kind of a catalog

1963
01:48:19.939 --> 01:48:22.029
of ones that are associated with greater or lower

1964
01:48:22.029 --> 01:48:25.029
IQ and then for any individual person, you can

1965
01:48:25.029 --> 01:48:27.049
go across that whole list and say, well, do

1966
01:48:27.049 --> 01:48:29.229
you have at the first one, do you have

1967
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:31.750
the plus or the minus version? And the second

1968
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:32.950
one, the plus or the minus. So you just

1969
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:35.100
add them up and you get a normal distribution,

1970
01:48:35.229 --> 01:48:38.509
and that's called your polygenic score, right? So what

1971
01:48:38.509 --> 01:48:41.620
you find, if you do that, is that across

1972
01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:47.310
the population. The polygenic score really does track. The

1973
01:48:47.310 --> 01:48:50.109
IQ or the educational attainment or cognitive ability, whatever

1974
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:51.990
it is that your phenotype was, right? Not just

1975
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:54.930
in the population that they developed the tool in,

1976
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:58.509
but in a test population. OK. So when you

1977
01:48:58.509 --> 01:48:59.950
look at a graph like that, you could say,

1978
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:03.629
OK, I'm gonna split people by, say, into 10

1979
01:49:03.629 --> 01:49:07.189
bins based on their polygenic scores, and for each

1980
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:09.830
of those ones I'm gonna plot the mean value

1981
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:12.649
in this cognitive test. And then you get a

1982
01:49:12.649 --> 01:49:15.640
nice linear sort of relationship where people with the

1983
01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:18.479
highest polygenic score on average score the best. And

1984
01:49:18.479 --> 01:49:20.040
you could look at that and go, wow, this

1985
01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:22.229
is great. Look at this great tool we have

1986
01:49:22.439 --> 01:49:26.629
to predict people's cognitive ability. Now the problem is

1987
01:49:26.979 --> 01:49:30.120
that absolutely obscures the fact that there's a whole

1988
01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:34.319
massive amount of variation that's unexplained, that's not captured

1989
01:49:34.319 --> 01:49:37.259
by the polygenic score, because if you look within

1990
01:49:37.439 --> 01:49:40.680
any of the bins. And you look vertically at

1991
01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:44.589
the spread of say IQ scores, it's huge, right?

1992
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:47.109
The average is a little bit higher than the

1993
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:49.589
one next to it, but the spread is still

1994
01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:52.310
huge. So if all you know about somebody is

1995
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:56.669
their polygenic score. You have hardly any predictive power

1996
01:49:57.209 --> 01:49:59.569
for them as an individual, because these, these are

1997
01:49:59.569 --> 01:50:03.890
statistical tools. They're for population averages, they're for population

1998
01:50:03.890 --> 01:50:08.250
variants. They're not designed to predict the phenotype of

1999
01:50:08.250 --> 01:50:11.850
an individual and they can't. They're really, really terrible

2000
01:50:11.850 --> 01:50:15.569
at it, right? So at best. You, what you

2001
01:50:15.569 --> 01:50:17.970
could get is a kind of a statistical prediction.

2002
01:50:18.049 --> 01:50:20.970
So if you have two embryos that are at

2003
01:50:20.970 --> 01:50:26.810
opposite ends of the polygenic spectrum, Statistically speaking, the

2004
01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:28.600
one at the, at the high end is more

2005
01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.490
likely to have a higher IQ than the one

2006
01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:32.290
at the low end. But there's a very good

2007
01:50:32.290 --> 01:50:34.100
chance that it would be the opposite way around

2008
01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:36.370
because at each of those, the spread is still

2009
01:50:36.370 --> 01:50:39.040
huge and the overlap between them is still almost

2010
01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:42.569
complete. So, um, so there's a question then I'm

2011
01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:46.370
like, uh, what do you do with that kind

2012
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:49.049
of information? How is that being presented by these

2013
01:50:49.049 --> 01:50:51.939
companies and I saw a new one. Uh, JUST

2014
01:50:51.939 --> 01:50:55.149
yesterday sprang up, that's offering people this kind of

2015
01:50:55.149 --> 01:51:01.479
uh. Uh, CUSTOM iPad sort of uh display to,

2016
01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:04.459
to, to select between their multiple embryos, right? And

2017
01:51:04.459 --> 01:51:06.899
it's so it's giving this rundown for each embryo

2018
01:51:06.899 --> 01:51:10.779
of like hair color, eye color, um, predicted height,

2019
01:51:10.939 --> 01:51:13.859
predicted IQ, risk of various conditions, and you know,

2020
01:51:13.979 --> 01:51:16.060
some of them will be higher risk of Alzheimer's

2021
01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:18.540
but blue eyes and lower risk of heart disease

2022
01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:20.859
and then, and, and you know, it's this Gattaca

2023
01:51:20.859 --> 01:51:22.709
like uh idea where you could pick these things,

2024
01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:27.500
right? So it's basically like a 23andMe genetic profile

2025
01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:29.600
where you know you send your DNA in and

2026
01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:30.990
they send you back and say your risk of

2027
01:51:30.990 --> 01:51:34.430
Alzheimer's is 22%. Uh, YOU know, it might have

2028
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:38.640
been 17%, but it's 22%. OK, what am I,

2029
01:51:39.149 --> 01:51:41.029
what do I do with that information? Nothing, right?

2030
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:43.930
So, so the question is what do you do

2031
01:51:43.930 --> 01:51:46.720
with it in terms of embryo selection and, and

2032
01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:49.799
there's very different views, first of all on whether

2033
01:51:49.799 --> 01:51:51.959
it's ethical for people to use that kind of

2034
01:51:51.959 --> 01:51:54.750
information and the system in the states is very

2035
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:57.080
deregulated, you can do whatever you want. The system

2036
01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:59.359
in Europe is highly regulated, you can only do

2037
01:51:59.359 --> 01:52:03.520
genetic testing for specific genetic disorders for the most

2038
01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:06.589
part. Um, BUT the other question is just like,

2039
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:09.549
would it work? Whether, regardless of whether it's a

2040
01:52:09.549 --> 01:52:11.990
good thing to do or not, just scientifically, technically

2041
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:14.500
speaking, would it work? Would having the polygenic score

2042
01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:18.720
between two embryos actually be a useful predictor? And

2043
01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:19.950
I think for the reasons I've just talked about,

2044
01:52:19.959 --> 01:52:23.069
it wouldn't. And especially more so because you're not

2045
01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:25.430
choosing between people at opposite ends of the spectrum.

2046
01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:28.540
Across the whole population. You're not sampling the whole

2047
01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:32.790
population's worth of variants, you're sampling sibling variants, which

2048
01:52:32.790 --> 01:52:35.430
obviously is much a much narrower range that you

2049
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:38.029
would be trying to make discriminations across. So the

2050
01:52:38.029 --> 01:52:42.640
ability of the polygenic score to actually really predict

2051
01:52:42.890 --> 01:52:44.879
would be even, you know, much, much less in

2052
01:52:44.879 --> 01:52:48.049
that scenario. So, um, I don't see any actual

2053
01:52:48.049 --> 01:52:51.370
utility there and I think the way that these

2054
01:52:51.370 --> 01:52:56.589
things are being advertised. Uh, ALMOST amounts to fraud.

2055
01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:00.120
Yeah, I mean, when it comes to eugenics, and

2056
01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:02.919
this will probably be my last question today, when

2057
01:53:02.919 --> 01:53:06.200
it comes to eugenics, uh, it, of course, the

2058
01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:11.020
ethics of it is very, uh, messy, but, uh,

2059
01:53:11.029 --> 01:53:15.560
even apart from that, there's a, the science behind

2060
01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:18.640
it. I mean, there's not much support for the

2061
01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:21.359
kinds of claims that People make it. I mean,

2062
01:53:21.450 --> 01:53:25.299
of course, there's also the more subjective aspects of,

2063
01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:30.200
OK, so we're select, we're selecting for better people

2064
01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:34.990
or we want better superior people to procreate among

2065
01:53:34.990 --> 01:53:39.470
themselves. I mean, whatever that means, I'm not sure

2066
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:41.959
it depends. I, I guess it's kind of arbitrary.

2067
01:53:42.745 --> 01:53:45.384
But uh I mean, the kinds of claims that

2068
01:53:45.384 --> 01:53:48.665
they tend to make in terms of the extent

2069
01:53:48.665 --> 01:53:52.015
to which it would be possible to change, I

2070
01:53:52.015 --> 01:53:57.024
don't know particular populations in terms of their phenotypes,

2071
01:53:57.305 --> 01:54:00.865
particular kinds of phenotypes, uh, it tends to be

2072
01:54:00.865 --> 01:54:03.015
very unscientific.

2073
01:54:03.225 --> 01:54:05.705
Yeah, yeah, and there's a lot of things about

2074
01:54:05.705 --> 01:54:09.790
this that, excuse me, are um. Yeah, both I

2075
01:54:09.790 --> 01:54:13.229
think sort of morally and ethically questionable, but also

2076
01:54:13.229 --> 01:54:16.470
scientifically. So one of the things that's interesting there

2077
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:18.189
is that you, you made this switch that many

2078
01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:20.350
of the people in this, in this sort of

2079
01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:23.500
discourse make, which is, first of all, they'll defend

2080
01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:26.790
the idea of of parental choice and basically what

2081
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:29.350
you could call kind of a consumer eugenics where

2082
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:32.339
right, mom and dad are having a baby. By

2083
01:54:32.339 --> 01:54:37.240
IVF they got multiple embryos, um, they already choose

2084
01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:39.779
between them. I mean, the embryologist chooses between them

2085
01:54:39.779 --> 01:54:41.950
in terms of just looking at them which one

2086
01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:45.060
is likely to get a healthy pregnancy. Uh, THEY

2087
01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:48.939
may be using some other genetic information, say they're

2088
01:54:48.939 --> 01:54:54.299
carriers of cystic fibrosis mutation, right? Um. And they

2089
01:54:54.299 --> 01:54:56.390
know that they are, and they do a genetic

2090
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:59.490
test and they select the embryo that doesn't have,

2091
01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:01.939
uh, you know, both copies of that gene, right?

2092
01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:04.580
And, and many people would say there's nothing wrong

2093
01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:07.330
with that, that's perfectly reasonable, good thing to do.

2094
01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:09.620
Um, OF course, many embryos are screened for things

2095
01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:12.979
like chromosomal disorders like Down syndrome and and regularly

2096
01:55:12.979 --> 01:55:17.040
that's a regular um target of of um embryo

2097
01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:20.589
selection as well. Question is like when you go

2098
01:55:20.589 --> 01:55:27.020
beyond that, um. How much scientific efficacy would there

2099
01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:30.700
be in terms of selecting for, uh, against, say,

2100
01:55:30.859 --> 01:55:34.589
risk of common disorders? There's some, I don't want

2101
01:55:34.589 --> 01:55:39.379
to say there's none. Um, THE problem is like

2102
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:41.910
one embryo might be high for schizophrenia risk, but

2103
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:43.629
low for heart disease, and you know, you're sort

2104
01:55:43.629 --> 01:55:46.879
of mixing and matching. Um, SO just on the

2105
01:55:46.879 --> 01:55:49.870
selection front that becomes uh uh just a technical

2106
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:52.109
challenge because there's so much going on, right? So

2107
01:55:52.109 --> 01:55:55.140
what are you trying to optimize for? And then

2108
01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:57.450
the question of selecting for traits, especially things like

2109
01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:59.990
IQ or personality traits and things like that, you

2110
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:02.569
get this sense and uh you know, the rhetoric

2111
01:56:02.569 --> 01:56:07.450
of better. People, higher quality people, uh, I find

2112
01:56:07.450 --> 01:56:14.009
it uh very. Personally, morally repugnant. Um, THAT'S not

2113
01:56:14.009 --> 01:56:16.450
an argument, that's not a scientific argument, that's my,

2114
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:18.890
that's my personal, um, feeling about it.

2115
01:56:19.399 --> 01:56:22.330
I mean it's not, it's not even a scientific

2116
01:56:22.330 --> 01:56:25.370
claim, right? I mean, yeah, yeah,

2117
01:56:25.770 --> 01:56:27.330
well, that's the thing, right, yes, I can't have

2118
01:56:27.330 --> 01:56:28.890
a scientific argument to it because it's not a

2119
01:56:28.890 --> 01:56:31.569
scientific claim, right, um, I have a I have

2120
01:56:31.569 --> 01:56:35.750
a personal opinion about it, um, that I just

2121
01:56:36.089 --> 01:56:41.580
find the, the that attitude distasteful. Uh, BUT then,

2122
01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:43.709
you know, OK, so all, all of that like

2123
01:56:43.709 --> 01:56:46.680
you've got this individual parental choice and, and, you

2124
01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:49.029
know, it's interesting if you start really digging into

2125
01:56:49.029 --> 01:56:53.089
that. Around the ethics of it, it's, it's actually

2126
01:56:53.089 --> 01:56:55.109
not that easy to come up with really good

2127
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:58.520
arguments against it. Cause you're you're moving from one

2128
01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:01.520
area where it's like obviously OK into areas where

2129
01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:04.720
it's like, well, OK, I wouldn't do it, but

2130
01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:06.600
should, should it not be allowed for anybody, like

2131
01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:09.009
where's the, where's the harm? uh, AND it become

2132
01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:12.109
a little bit difficult to talk about that. Um,

2133
01:57:13.359 --> 01:57:16.049
The more interesting thing here though is when it

2134
01:57:16.049 --> 01:57:20.000
becomes really eugenics eugenics, which is a program of

2135
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.930
gene change across a population. And there, this is

2136
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:26.490
the kind of argument where people move from the

2137
01:57:26.490 --> 01:57:29.689
idea of just personal parental choice into saying we

2138
01:57:29.689 --> 01:57:32.529
should do this for society as a whole. It

2139
01:57:32.529 --> 01:57:35.370
would be better for society as a whole to

2140
01:57:35.370 --> 01:57:38.770
have more people like this and fewer people like

2141
01:57:38.770 --> 01:57:42.750
that. And that is eugenics in a nutshell. And

2142
01:57:42.759 --> 01:57:46.720
we know the horrid uh history of eugenics when

2143
01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:51.479
it's implemented in uh state kind of a fashion

2144
01:57:51.479 --> 01:57:54.200
and we've seen it, you know, people refer most

2145
01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:57.839
obviously to Nazi Germany, but it had a much

2146
01:57:57.839 --> 01:58:02.419
longer lifespan in America, for example, where, you know,

2147
01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:08.069
many, many thousands of people were um forcibly sterilized.

2148
01:58:08.609 --> 01:58:11.250
Um, YOU know, because they either sort of intellectual

2149
01:58:11.250 --> 01:58:16.000
disability or epilepsy or some kind of um. Uh,

2150
01:58:16.089 --> 01:58:18.919
OTHER, you know, psychiatric disorder or something like that.

2151
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:21.490
So, you know, and this was going on to

2152
01:58:21.490 --> 01:58:25.169
the 1970s. So, we know what that looks like.

2153
01:58:25.250 --> 01:58:27.129
We know where that ends. And it's not a,

2154
01:58:27.330 --> 01:58:30.970
it's not a good place. Uh IT'S horrific and

2155
01:58:30.970 --> 01:58:34.250
um and it's based on, yeah, these notions that

2156
01:58:34.250 --> 01:58:39.020
some people are better than others. And like, we're

2157
01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:41.220
better in that case, it's like, it's better for

2158
01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:44.589
society to have people like that in it. And

2159
01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:48.560
um yeah, so again, I, I, I just find

2160
01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:54.459
that um morally objectionable, to put it mildly. And

2161
01:58:54.459 --> 01:58:58.060
something that we need to be um cognizant of

2162
01:58:58.060 --> 01:59:00.979
and you know on on alert for because those

2163
01:59:00.979 --> 01:59:04.020
kinds of of claims that rhetoric is is coming

2164
01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:08.020
back. It's based on a flawed understanding of, of

2165
01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:10.504
genetics as well as whatever. The, the, the sort

2166
01:59:10.504 --> 01:59:14.584
of morally problematic, uh, edifice of arguments that these

2167
01:59:14.584 --> 01:59:16.975
people make, but it's important, I think, at least

2168
01:59:16.975 --> 01:59:20.984
as as geneticists that we point out the scientific

2169
01:59:20.984 --> 01:59:24.145
limitations of it, the limit, the limits of genetic

2170
01:59:24.145 --> 01:59:30.024
determinism, um, and especially the complexities of the relationship

2171
01:59:30.024 --> 01:59:34.410
between genotypes and phenotypes where it's just hubris. To

2172
01:59:34.410 --> 01:59:36.660
think that we can predict things, that we can

2173
01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:38.410
go in and not just select, but maybe do

2174
01:59:38.410 --> 01:59:41.410
genome editing and know what the outcome is gonna

2175
01:59:41.410 --> 01:59:45.529
be and not face unanticipated consequences because complex systems

2176
01:59:45.529 --> 01:59:47.689
will kick you in the ass and that's exactly

2177
01:59:47.689 --> 01:59:49.370
what is likely to, to happen.

2178
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:52.540
I mean, isn't it also for even from a

2179
01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:56.950
biological perspective, does it make any sense at all

2180
01:59:56.950 --> 02:00:00.950
to talk about better rates and worst rates or

2181
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:03.029
good rates and bad rates. I mean, of course,

2182
02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:09.149
there are perhaps some very rare exceptions, very rare

2183
02:00:09.149 --> 02:00:15.470
conditions like Uh, cystic fibrosis, OK. Probably it's better

2184
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:18.910
for no one to, to have cystic fibrosis, but

2185
02:00:18.910 --> 02:00:23.509
apart from that, when we're talking about more complex

2186
02:00:23.509 --> 02:00:27.930
traits and Uh, lyotropic effects and all of that.

2187
02:00:27.970 --> 02:00:31.890
I mean, does it make sense even from a

2188
02:00:31.890 --> 02:00:37.169
pure scientific biological perspective to say that some traits

2189
02:00:37.169 --> 02:00:39.799
are good and others are bad.

2190
02:00:39.890 --> 02:00:43.450
Mm, no, uh, it doesn't, and of course it's

2191
02:00:43.450 --> 02:00:46.620
a value judgment, right? So the question is, uh,

2192
02:00:46.729 --> 02:00:48.370
what is it that you, that you're basing that

2193
02:00:48.370 --> 02:00:50.990
on? What is it that you value? And you

2194
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:53.990
know, if you're If you're a farmer who wants

2195
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:57.470
to improve milk yield in his herd of cattle,

2196
02:00:57.830 --> 02:01:00.310
then great, you know, that's, if that's the trait

2197
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:03.229
that you value, then you can select for that

2198
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:05.779
trait, and people, of course, have done that. Now,

2199
02:01:06.509 --> 02:01:08.990
the problem in animal breeding is what happens when

2200
02:01:08.990 --> 02:01:11.629
they really, really push selection for individual traits like

2201
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:15.589
that is these unanticipated consequences start cropping up. Bad

2202
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:17.790
things happen, other traits change in ways that you

2203
02:01:17.790 --> 02:01:20.209
didn't want. Um, YOU know, it's why we end

2204
02:01:20.209 --> 02:01:23.490
up with uh tomatoes that have no flavor, even

2205
02:01:23.490 --> 02:01:25.649
though they last on the shelf for weeks and

2206
02:01:25.649 --> 02:01:29.410
weeks, right? You know, so, so, um, those, there

2207
02:01:29.410 --> 02:01:32.490
are salutary lessons to take from the history of

2208
02:01:32.490 --> 02:01:34.930
animal and plant breeding where people have done exactly

2209
02:01:34.930 --> 02:01:40.160
this kind of project. Valued one particular trait and

2210
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:43.549
pushed it uh really hard to the detriment of

2211
02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:46.310
of other ones. Now, in human society, the question

2212
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:50.810
is Yeah, what traits are valued, and there are

2213
02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:52.819
many different ways that you can look at that,

2214
02:01:52.879 --> 02:01:57.370
you know, you could say. Which traits are associated

2215
02:01:57.370 --> 02:02:00.970
with life success and you then, then you have

2216
02:02:00.970 --> 02:02:03.370
to define success in some way where again you're

2217
02:02:03.370 --> 02:02:06.160
making value judgments. But let's say, uh, you know,

2218
02:02:06.290 --> 02:02:09.850
uh, income or it could be, you know, you

2219
02:02:09.850 --> 02:02:11.490
could take an evolutionary approach, you could say number

2220
02:02:11.490 --> 02:02:15.649
of offspring, right? Uh, YOU could say, uh, longevity,

2221
02:02:15.790 --> 02:02:18.399
you could say you could look at disease burden,

2222
02:02:18.569 --> 02:02:20.250
right? You know, all of those things are, are

2223
02:02:20.250 --> 02:02:22.410
things that you could use in your value judgment

2224
02:02:22.410 --> 02:02:25.689
just it's just pragmatic. You just make some choices,

2225
02:02:25.770 --> 02:02:28.089
right? And there are always gonna be some trade-offs

2226
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:30.450
uh between those things cause you probably won't be

2227
02:02:30.450 --> 02:02:32.899
able to maximize them all. At the same time.

2228
02:02:32.979 --> 02:02:35.540
So, you know, that's one way of thinking about

2229
02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:39.419
value in terms of for an individual, what's the

2230
02:02:39.419 --> 02:02:41.979
best way for them to be for them, for

2231
02:02:41.979 --> 02:02:44.819
their outcomes. But there's another way to look at

2232
02:02:44.819 --> 02:02:48.459
it, which is like across society, what is the

2233
02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:52.370
what is the best way, you know, for society

2234
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:56.500
to be. Um, AND again, you can make arguments

2235
02:02:56.500 --> 02:03:00.939
there for, you know, say diversity of cognitive styles

2236
02:03:00.939 --> 02:03:02.939
is actually really important. You know, if we, if

2237
02:03:02.939 --> 02:03:06.100
we homogenized everybody to one end of the IQ

2238
02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:09.060
spectrum, we might have a really limited set of

2239
02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:11.459
cognitive styles. We might miss out on kind of

2240
02:03:11.459 --> 02:03:14.305
some aspects of creativity, for example. That are really

2241
02:03:14.305 --> 02:03:16.575
important in society as a whole. So that's where

2242
02:03:17.214 --> 02:03:21.285
diversity becomes uh a value that you could uh

2243
02:03:21.285 --> 02:03:23.895
or a property that you could apply value to

2244
02:03:23.895 --> 02:03:26.055
and that would argue against kind of, you know,

2245
02:03:26.174 --> 02:03:31.165
eugenics, um, approaches that are narrowly focused on one

2246
02:03:31.165 --> 02:03:34.895
phenotype at a time. So, you know, there, there

2247
02:03:34.895 --> 02:03:38.299
are no Right or wrong answers to the, they're

2248
02:03:38.299 --> 02:03:42.299
just pragmatic questions of what we value individually and

2249
02:03:42.299 --> 02:03:45.649
what we value uh across society. And I guess

2250
02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:48.500
what I would say to take a step back

2251
02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:52.250
from the actual traits that we, that we're valuing.

2252
02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:57.790
IS to look at the mindset of even thinking

2253
02:03:57.790 --> 02:04:00.500
about those, those traits and trying to kind of

2254
02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:05.029
commodify our children uh in a way that sort

2255
02:04:05.029 --> 02:04:07.709
of almost represents them as products, some of which

2256
02:04:07.709 --> 02:04:09.430
are better than others, some of which are even

2257
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:14.109
defective, right? Um, AND to me, that having that

2258
02:04:14.109 --> 02:04:18.379
mindset in place instantiates a set of of of

2259
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:21.020
of values that I don't want to Uh, that

2260
02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:23.620
I don't want to embrace myself, you know, I

2261
02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:25.689
think we can have a set of values which

2262
02:04:25.689 --> 02:04:29.569
is, here's this amazing diversity of of human beings

2263
02:04:29.779 --> 02:04:34.700
with different forms and different minds, uh, everyone completely

2264
02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:37.770
unique, even if there were identical twins, they're still

2265
02:04:37.770 --> 02:04:41.140
idiosyncratic, never to be repeated again and that, uh,

2266
02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:47.209
you know, that incredible. Diversity, uh, should be embraced,

2267
02:04:47.620 --> 02:04:50.919
not just accepted, not just tolerated, but embraced and,

2268
02:04:50.939 --> 02:04:54.370
and, you know, we can and celebrate it. So

2269
02:04:55.049 --> 02:04:57.810
You know, that that's uh that that the the

2270
02:04:57.810 --> 02:05:02.979
unprespeifiable nature of that, of that human experience, uh,

2271
02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:05.680
to me is is the thing that has the

2272
02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:11.879
most value and um even engaging in the eugenics

2273
02:05:11.879 --> 02:05:15.720
kind of mindset, I think undermines and threatens that,

2274
02:05:15.879 --> 02:05:17.040
uh, that appreciation.

2275
02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:21.990
Great. So just before we go, would you like

2276
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:25.299
to tell people where they can find your work

2277
02:05:25.299 --> 02:05:26.240
on the internet?

2278
02:05:26.669 --> 02:05:29.419
Sure, uh, so I have a website called, um,

2279
02:05:29.509 --> 02:05:35.430
it's www.kjmitchell.com, which I need to update. Um, I

2280
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:38.589
have a blog site called Wiring the Brain and

2281
02:05:38.589 --> 02:05:42.430
a, uh, I'm on uh BlueSky these days, mostly,

2282
02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:47.140
um, wiring thera. BSky.social I think is the handle.

2283
02:05:47.629 --> 02:05:49.339
Um, AND of course if you're interested in any

2284
02:05:49.339 --> 02:05:52.790
of the um the academic papers that we've referred

2285
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:55.910
to, you can get them on my Google Scholar

2286
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:56.310
page.

2287
02:05:56.959 --> 02:05:59.080
Yeah, I will also link to them in the

2288
02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:02.669
description of the interview. So Doctor Mitchell, thank you

2289
02:06:02.669 --> 02:06:05.049
