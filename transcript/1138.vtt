00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:03.049
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.079
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops and

3
00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:08.920
today I'm joined by Adam Bo. He is an

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.779
interdisciplinary romantic love and human mating researcher who employs

5
00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.719
an ethological framework in his theory and analysis. We're

6
00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:20.745
going to talk about that. Today he's currently enrolled

7
00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:24.254
in a PhD in biological anthropology at the Australian

8
00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:28.825
National University School of Archaeology and Anthropology, and he

9
00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:32.705
holds a position as a sessional academic at Federation

10
00:00:32.705 --> 00:00:37.415
University Australia in the Institute of Health and Well-being.

11
00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:40.625
And today, we're going to explore the topic of

12
00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:44.224
romantic love. So, Adam, welcome to the show. It's

13
00:00:44.224 --> 00:00:45.075
a pleasure to everyone.

14
00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:46.854
My pleasure as well.

15
00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.880
So, first of all, let's start perhaps here with

16
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.080
a definition or an understanding of romantic love. So

17
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.709
what is romantic love?

18
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.240
It's a good question, cause, uh, it's a little

19
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.439
bit muddy. So what I mean when I say

20
00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:05.000
romantic love is, it's that thing that happens at

21
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.839
the beginning of a romantic relationship, where you go

22
00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:09.800
a little bit crazy and think your partner is

23
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.139
the best thing ever. It's essentially a motivational state

24
00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:17.449
associated with intense cognitions, emotions and behaviors. And it

25
00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:20.809
says a number of reproductive functions. It's, uh, commonly

26
00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:24.069
associated with the early stages of a romantic relationship

27
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.569
that can exist in the absence of a romantic

28
00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.050
relationship in something called unrequited love, and it can

29
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.400
less commonly exist after many years or decades or,

30
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.709
or even a lifetime. Uh, IT used to be

31
00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.949
called passionate love, uh, in the 80s and 90s.

32
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.309
Uh, Elaine Hatfield coined that term, and she's the

33
00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:44.629
grandmother of romantic love research. Um, BUT that's really

34
00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:46.660
only a term used in the humanities these days,

35
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.029
with a, with a few minor exceptions. But if

36
00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:50.830
any of your watchers are reading a paper on

37
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.620
passionate love, that's the same thing as romantic love.

38
00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:57.889
Um, IT contrasts with companionate love, which is that

39
00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:00.790
less intense type of love associated with feelings of

40
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.529
companionship that long-term married couples have. Um, AND the

41
00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:08.089
way I use it is basically the way that

42
00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:10.889
psychologists and big names in the area use it.

43
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:15.210
So, I do, Sandra Langislag does, Arthur Aaron, Bianca

44
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.509
Acevedo, Monazu. We all use the term romantic love.

45
00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:21.255
Uh, AND that's the convention, uh, I. See in

46
00:02:21.255 --> 00:02:23.595
the science. Uh, THAT being said, it's, it's a

47
00:02:23.595 --> 00:02:25.895
little bit muddy, because there are a number of

48
00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:29.565
researchers, mainly people from outside the science, who do

49
00:02:29.565 --> 00:02:32.214
a sporadic or a one-off, uh, paper on the

50
00:02:32.214 --> 00:02:35.005
topic of love, who use the term romantic love

51
00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:37.960
to mean any love in a romantic relationship. So

52
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.160
they could be referring to romantic love or companionate

53
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.119
love. And, uh, this is problematic because it's, it's

54
00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.119
a bit confusing. Uh, IT can lead to bad

55
00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.520
science. Um, FOR example, I read a paper recently,

56
00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:54.160
in meta-analysis of FMRI studies. So a big, big

57
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.880
study that I took a lot of time and

58
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.509
energy to do. And now we're testing the hypothesis

59
00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:02.039
related to romantic love. Uh, AND they did set

60
00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.195
it up quite well in the introduction. But they

61
00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:07.475
made the mistake in the analysis to include studies

62
00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:11.104
of people experiencing both romantic love and companionate love.

63
00:03:11.354 --> 00:03:14.115
And this resulted because of the confusion about the

64
00:03:14.115 --> 00:03:16.875
term romantic love. So I'll just, uh, say to

65
00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:18.914
your watchers, when you're reading a paper and someone

66
00:03:18.914 --> 00:03:21.384
says romantic love, try to make sure you understand

67
00:03:21.384 --> 00:03:24.375
what they're actually talking about. Hopefully they'll define what

68
00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:26.845
they're talking about. Um, BUT, uh, just be very

69
00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:29.475
careful because we don't want that confusion to, to

70
00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:29.755
continue.

71
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.779
Right. I mean, when it comes to the transition

72
00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:37.699
from romantic love to companionate love, is there a

73
00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.339
specific time frame we're talking about here? I mean,

74
00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.979
how long does romantic love tend to last?

75
00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:47.830
Uh, WE'RE not really sure. Scientists haven't been really

76
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.350
good at determining that. There haven't been sufficient longitudinal

77
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.869
studies. So there's been a, a few longitudinal studies,

78
00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.589
but I'm looking at this in particular. Um, THE

79
00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:59.429
indications I get from the summer of research I've

80
00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:01.710
read is it's in the vicinity of about 18

81
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.865
months when a Couple is in love with each

82
00:04:03.865 --> 00:04:06.425
other. Um, THERE'S gonna be variation with that. Some

83
00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:08.065
people will be in love for only 1 year,

84
00:04:08.345 --> 00:04:10.535
some for maybe 3 years. Uh, BUT in that

85
00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:13.065
1 to 2 year period seems to be about

86
00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:16.863
right. And, uh, there's evolutionary reasons why that might

87
00:04:16.863 --> 00:04:18.494
be the case. And I'm sure we're gonna get

88
00:04:18.494 --> 00:04:20.334
to some of those as, as we go on.

89
00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:25.744
What are the most common, I mean, let's call

90
00:04:25.744 --> 00:04:28.855
them symptoms, I guess, of romantic love.

91
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.450
Uh, SO, once again, nobody's done a really good

92
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.149
job at really pinpointing this. There are a number

93
00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:38.769
of scales that involve a number of items measuring

94
00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:44.130
the cognitions, emotions, and behaviors of romantic love. And

95
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.095
so one common Thing seems to be a desire

96
00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:50.364
for reciprocity. Um, WHEN you're in love with someone,

97
00:04:50.445 --> 00:04:52.554
you want them to love you back. Another one

98
00:04:52.554 --> 00:04:54.725
is sort of, um, what I refer to as

99
00:04:54.725 --> 00:04:59.434
hypermanic-like features. So elevated mood and physiological arousal seems

100
00:04:59.434 --> 00:05:02.690
to be common. Uh, OBSESSIVE thinking about a partner,

101
00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:06.890
so, um, repetitive thoughts about the loved one is

102
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.809
also quite common, and we tend to have an

103
00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:12.609
inflated sense of the other as well. So we,

104
00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.799
we tend to think, um, our loved one is

105
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.880
a lot better than they probably are.

106
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.010
I mean, uh, 6 years ago, I had a

107
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.690
conversation on the show with the late Doctor Helen

108
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.670
Fisher and she uh she told me about some

109
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.380
of the symptoms of romantic love she had studied

110
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.670
and she mentioned things like uh being obsessed with

111
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.450
the person, I mean, spending all day thinking about

112
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.369
the person and then Uh, some sleep deprivation sometimes

113
00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:48.410
and losing appetite. I mean, is that something that

114
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.529
you've also found or other romantic love researchers found

115
00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.959
in your research or not?

116
00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:57.690
Um, SO I'm familiar with Helen's work on the

117
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.929
topic and, and in particular, a 1998 paper where

118
00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:05.135
she described The, um, psychological features of romantic love.

119
00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:06.825
And she did a very good job. Uh, A

120
00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.945
lot of that was drawn off earlier work by

121
00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:11.864
Dorothy Tenov in 1979, who wrote a book, Love

122
00:06:11.864 --> 00:06:15.744
and Limerance. Um, Helen's articulation of the psychology of

123
00:06:15.744 --> 00:06:18.785
romantic love in that 1998 paper is, is absolutely

124
00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:20.774
spot on. I, I, I don't have any, uh,

125
00:06:21.024 --> 00:06:22.464
qualms with what she said there.

126
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.179
OK. So explain how you approach the study of

127
00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:33.309
romantic love by combining approaches from biological anthropology, human

128
00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:36.859
ethology, and psychology. How, how do you go about

129
00:06:36.859 --> 00:06:40.579
combining them and what do you draw from each

130
00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:40.980
of them?

131
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.899
So I guess you'd say that I'm both a

132
00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:49.579
multidisciplinary and an interdisciplinary researcher. So I'm multidisciplinary in,

133
00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:51.739
in the sense that, like you've alluded to, uh,

134
00:06:51.859 --> 00:06:55.970
I, uh, undertake studies in biological anthropology and psychology.

135
00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:58.720
And most of my biological anthropology work to date

136
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.100
has been looking at selective pressures and their relationship

137
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.420
to the evolution of reproductive states, particularly social monogamy

138
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.899
and paternal investment. Um, BUT I've also developed with

139
00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:12.299
Phil Cabin. ARE from the University of Canberra and

140
00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:15.260
the University of South Australia. What I understand is

141
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.140
the world's largest data set of people experiencing romantic

142
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.140
love. It's called the Romantic Love Survey 2022, and

143
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.570
the cross-sectional aspects available online. Anybody can go and,

144
00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:26.660
um, access that data and do studies if they

145
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.940
want. Um, AND that's allowed me to investigate sort

146
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.390
of evolutionary ideas related to romantic love, um, but

147
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.779
also just the modern environment and how romantic love

148
00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:40.839
looks, uh, today. Uh, SO some of the evolutionary

149
00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:42.799
ideas I've looked at are, are things like sexual

150
00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:46.440
selection by investigating sex differences, or variation in the

151
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.559
expression of romantic love. We know that variation's a

152
00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:53.239
necessary element, uh, for evolution to occur. Um, AND

153
00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:55.839
the survey studies have also even allowed us to

154
00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:58.670
gain some insights into the mechanisms, which I've Back

155
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.140
to, um, evolutionary history. Uh, THAT being said, I've

156
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.220
also just looked at sort of the modern world,

157
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.869
and I've got interesting papers on like SSRIs and

158
00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:11.190
romantic love, uh, and currently doing a paper on

159
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.649
risky driving and romantic love. Uh, SO there's a

160
00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:16.429
whole heap of gaps that are, are basically just

161
00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:20.869
being filled. Now, I'm interdisciplinary in that. I use

162
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:23.869
Tim Bergen's 4 question as an overarching framework in

163
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:26.959
all of my research. So Nico Tinbergen was a,

164
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:30.109
a ethologist, someone who studies animal behavior. He won

165
00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:32.950
a Nobel Prize with some others in the 60s,

166
00:08:32.989 --> 00:08:35.380
I believe, uh, for his work in this area.

167
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.880
And in 1963, he wrote a really informative paper

168
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.020
saying that if you want to have a comprehensive

169
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.840
understanding of any behavior. You need to approach it

170
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.299
from 4 perspectives. And those perspectives are considering the

171
00:08:48.299 --> 00:08:52.140
mechanisms that cause the behavior, the ontogeny or its

172
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.619
development across the lifespan, uh, the evolutionary functions that

173
00:08:55.619 --> 00:08:58.650
the behavior serves, as well as the hologeny. Um,

174
00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.820
AND I have basically applied this to both my

175
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.349
biological anthropology and psychology research, which means I'm not

176
00:09:05.349 --> 00:09:07.619
siloed, and I can draw on a full breadth

177
00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:11.099
of evidence wherever it comes from. It's pretty useful

178
00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:14.770
in making sense of existing findings, so previous research,

179
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.979
but it's also good at generating ideas that can

180
00:09:16.979 --> 00:09:19.539
be tested, and that's something that's really been missing

181
00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:23.309
from the science of romantic love. Um, SO the

182
00:09:23.309 --> 00:09:26.109
bioA research I do tells us about the selective

183
00:09:26.109 --> 00:09:29.710
pressures that cause social monogamy and in turn, romantic

184
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.349
love. And the psychology research tells us about the

185
00:09:32.349 --> 00:09:35.419
mechanisms of romantic love as well as the functions

186
00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:37.789
and the evolutionary history. And I, I found this

187
00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:41.630
to be quite a useful means of, of undertaking

188
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.270
the research, and I, I think it's a useful

189
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.549
contribution to the science.

190
00:09:46.059 --> 00:09:49.500
Yeah, we're going to go through Tim Bergen's for

191
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.409
questions applied to romantic love just in a bit.

192
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.780
But before that, do we know whether romantic love

193
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.500
is a human universal? I mean, do we have

194
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:04.700
any idea whether it is present across all studied

195
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.739
human societies or not?

196
00:10:07.289 --> 00:10:09.210
So it's a good question, and it's one that

197
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.250
I get asked a lot. So, I, I'll give

198
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.890
you the short answer. I think it is probably

199
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.200
a human universal, but we don't have the sufficient

200
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.599
evidence to be saying that unequivocally. Uh, THE best

201
00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:23.369
way I've heard it defined is it's either a

202
00:10:23.369 --> 00:10:27.030
universal or a near human universal. Uh, AND there's

203
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.020
two lines of evidence to consider, uh, when considering

204
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.429
whether it's a universal. And the first is a

205
00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:36.190
seminal study by Bill Jan Koviak and Edward Fisher

206
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:40.229
in 1992, which was an ethnographic analysis of a

207
00:10:40.229 --> 00:10:44.229
whole heap of ethnographies of 166 cultures from the

208
00:10:44.229 --> 00:10:46.679
standard cross cult. SURVEY, and they looked at these

209
00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:50.400
166 cultures, and they found ethnographic evidence of romantic

210
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.320
love in 145 cultures. So that's by far most

211
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.559
of them. Uh, THEY do note that just because

212
00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:58.919
they didn't find evidence doesn't mean that romantic love

213
00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:02.020
doesn't exist there. It just means that the ethnographers

214
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.250
didn't, uh, detail it. Now, uh, we have reason

215
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.929
to believe that romantic love evolved before modern humans

216
00:11:09.929 --> 00:11:13.770
emerged, um, so it is possible that, uh, it

217
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.440
is a universal feature, but some ethnic groups may

218
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.309
have lost, Uh, romantic love, uh, over generations. Um,

219
00:11:21.429 --> 00:11:23.460
BUT, uh, a study I've done, uh, looking at,

220
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:28.359
uh, the hologeny of, of non-human primates, uh, specifically

221
00:11:28.359 --> 00:11:31.539
territoriality and social monogamy, a paper I'm doing with,

222
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.070
uh, Katherine Blolia from the Australian National University, and

223
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.030
Simon Greenhill from the University of Auckland. We basically

224
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.989
found that in non-human primates, social monogamy is never

225
00:11:41.989 --> 00:11:45.809
lost when a species is territorial. Now modern humans

226
00:11:45.809 --> 00:11:49.450
are territorial, so it would be unique among primates

227
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.119
for us to have lost it at any stage.

228
00:11:52.369 --> 00:11:54.330
And so for that reason, I think it's unlikely

229
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.400
that any ethnic groups probably entirely lost romantic love.

230
00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.090
And it's for those reasons, I think romantic love's

231
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.419
probably a human universal.

232
00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:04.799
You know, I think this is a very interesting

233
00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:09.200
question because sometimes we hear from people, from the

234
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.659
humanities that uh the suggestion that romantic love is

235
00:12:14.659 --> 00:12:19.419
a social construct, that it's basically. Uh, CONSTRUCT of

236
00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:24.219
the Western culture from uh and started a few

237
00:12:24.219 --> 00:12:28.179
centuries ago with the romantics and people like that.

238
00:12:28.219 --> 00:12:32.289
I, I, I mean, does that hold any water

239
00:12:32.289 --> 00:12:32.739
or

240
00:12:32.739 --> 00:12:37.320
not? None at all. Um, WE'VE got sufficient evidence,

241
00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:41.369
uh, to show that social monogamy is very, very

242
00:12:41.369 --> 00:12:45.210
old, long before modern humans. Uh, SOCIAL monogamy assumes

243
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.929
to some extent romantic love, because romantic love causes

244
00:12:47.929 --> 00:12:51.039
social monogamy, at least for, uh, a, a period.

245
00:12:51.369 --> 00:12:53.929
Um, THERE'S been a number of studies looking at

246
00:12:53.929 --> 00:12:57.809
love, uh, cross-culturally. Uh, I recently, uh, studied a

247
00:12:57.809 --> 00:13:00.700
paper led by Some amazing researchers at the University

248
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.849
of Ratzlab in Poland that looked at love, not

249
00:13:04.099 --> 00:13:07.700
explicitly romantic love, but love, uh, in a romantic

250
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.140
relationship across nine cultures from non-weird societies. And, and

251
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.619
there's strong evidence of, of love in, in those

252
00:13:13.619 --> 00:13:16.090
nine societies, there's lots of other studies that have,

253
00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:19.700
have looked at many, many cultures. Everywhere you actively

254
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.260
go and look for it. Uh, THERE is romantic

255
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.070
love. Uh, I think. So when it comes to

256
00:13:26.359 --> 00:13:31.150
whether it's a recent invention, um, culture has, at

257
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:36.520
different stages, uh, repressed and promoted romantic love. So

258
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:41.280
there probably have been times where, um, people have

259
00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:46.109
experienced romantic love more. Obviously, um, I think you've

260
00:13:46.109 --> 00:13:49.340
had Matt Larsson on recently, who talked about the,

261
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:52.630
the trajectory of, of, uh, courtship and, and those

262
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.849
sorts of things over the subsequent, uh, generations. So,

263
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.669
um, it, it, there have been periods where it's

264
00:13:57.669 --> 00:14:00.210
been more common and less common and, and obvious

265
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.500
and, and secret and that sort of stuff. But,

266
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.849
uh, the basic biological motivational state has been around

267
00:14:05.849 --> 00:14:06.989
for a very long time.

268
00:14:08.659 --> 00:14:12.219
OK, so let's talk then about Tim Bergen's 4

269
00:14:12.219 --> 00:14:16.260
questions. I mean, let's explore romantic love through these

270
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:21.150
lens. First of all, which mechanisms are behind romantic

271
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.570
love?

272
00:14:22.549 --> 00:14:25.030
Uh, I'll, um, in response to that question, I'll

273
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:28.229
focus on the biological mechanisms, cause that's where we

274
00:14:28.229 --> 00:14:31.909
have the most research. And there are psychological make

275
00:14:31.909 --> 00:14:36.059
choice mechanisms like make preferences, attraction, and sexual desire,

276
00:14:36.429 --> 00:14:40.989
um, that certainly play a role, but, um, we

277
00:14:40.989 --> 00:14:42.750
haven't got a lot of research about how they

278
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.640
link in with romantic love. There's also social mechanisms

279
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.909
like familiarity and the feeling of needs, but there's

280
00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:49.549
only been a couple of studies, so I can't

281
00:14:49.549 --> 00:14:51.869
really go into detail on that. Uh, BUT in

282
00:14:51.869 --> 00:14:54.190
terms of the biology of romantic love, there's been

283
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:58.059
40 biological studies of romantic love, approximately 30, uh

284
00:14:58.059 --> 00:15:02.349
neuroimaging studies, about 10 endocrinological studies. And I think

285
00:15:02.349 --> 00:15:05.830
there's been two genetic studies. And, um, B and

286
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.909
Kushnick a paper I wrote with my supervisor at

287
00:15:07.909 --> 00:15:10.924
the time. Jeff Kushnick in 2021. We, um, went

288
00:15:10.924 --> 00:15:14.414
through all the evidence and we summarized the FMRI

289
00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:18.854
findings as indicating involvement in four broadly defined sets

290
00:15:18.854 --> 00:15:22.655
of circuitry. So those are reward and motivation, emotions,

291
00:15:22.854 --> 00:15:27.099
sexual desire, and social cognition. So reward and motivation

292
00:15:27.099 --> 00:15:30.590
uh is most associated with the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway.

293
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.049
So that's structures like the ventral tegmental area, nucleus

294
00:15:34.049 --> 00:15:38.059
accumbens, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex. The emotion areas

295
00:15:38.059 --> 00:15:41.130
are structures like the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex and

296
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:44.630
insula. Sexual desire and arouses, things like the chordate,

297
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:49.140
insular, putamen, and anterior cingulate cortex, and social cognition

298
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:53.140
areas like the amygdala, insular, and medial prefrontal cortex.

299
00:15:53.429 --> 00:15:55.419
Um, WHAT I do want to tell your watchers

300
00:15:55.419 --> 00:15:58.460
is you need to be cautious when interpreting FMRI

301
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.390
studies. So it might surprise them to know that

302
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:04.869
the test, retest reliability of task FMRI studies is

303
00:16:04.869 --> 00:16:07.599
only about 0.3. So the chance of getting the

304
00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:09.900
same findings in the same lab with the same

305
00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.919
people is actually pretty small. So you can't draw

306
00:16:12.919 --> 00:16:15.159
inferences from just a, a single study. You really

307
00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:17.359
need to have quite, quite a number of studies

308
00:16:17.359 --> 00:16:19.599
showing the same things. And all those structures that

309
00:16:19.599 --> 00:16:22.469
I've just listed have been repeatedly shown in FMRI

310
00:16:22.469 --> 00:16:25.799
studies to, uh, to be associated with romantic love.

311
00:16:26.169 --> 00:16:29.200
Uh, WHEN it comes to neurotransmitters and neurohormones, uh,

312
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.520
there's strong theoretical and empirical evidence to show that

313
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.349
dopamine, oxytocin, and opioids, most likely beta endorphin, play

314
00:16:38.349 --> 00:16:41.000
an important role. But there is some suggestion that

315
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.190
other neurotransmitters and neurohormones play a role, such as

316
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:49.039
serotonin, cortisol, testosterone, and nerve growth factor. Um, THAT

317
00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:52.479
being said, endocrinological studies are also notoriously noisy and

318
00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:55.580
inconsistent. So, for example, there's been 4 studies looking

319
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.700
at cortisol in romantic life. And like, you won't

320
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.940
believe me, all 4 studies came up with different

321
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.140
findings. Uh, SO, uh, once again, you can't just

322
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:09.459
rely on a single endocrinological study, uh, to, to

323
00:17:09.459 --> 00:17:11.790
know what's going on in romantic life. You've really

324
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.300
got to have quite a number all investigating the

325
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:14.780
same thing.

326
00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.050
Uh, WHEN it comes to the second question, which

327
00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:23.810
is related to development, what do we know about

328
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.219
the development of romantic love?

329
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.869
Uh, SO this is probably, uh, the one of

330
00:17:29.869 --> 00:17:32.500
Tim Bergen's 4 questions that we know least about.

331
00:17:32.989 --> 00:17:34.910
Uh, WHAT we do know is that romantic love

332
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.030
can actually express in juveniles. So there's been 2

333
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.709
studies that have shown, uh, the presence of romantic

334
00:17:40.709 --> 00:17:43.780
love in people under the age of 12. Now,

335
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.910
when they experience romantic love, it tends not to

336
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.229
be associated with the strong, uh, romantic attraction and

337
00:17:49.229 --> 00:17:52.150
sexual desire that you would normally find in romantic

338
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.910
love. Uh, AND it looks like romantic love with

339
00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:59.109
all its features seems to manifest after puberty. Um,

340
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.750
IT seems to be most common in adolescents, uh,

341
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.109
but it is very common in young adults and

342
00:18:04.109 --> 00:18:07.310
becomes less common as we age. But it can

343
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.819
occur at any age. There's heaps of anecdotal stories

344
00:18:10.819 --> 00:18:13.510
about people in nursing homes falling in love, for

345
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.930
example. Um, BUT that's really all we know. Uh,

346
00:18:16.069 --> 00:18:18.150
IT'S, it's the one area that, uh, we need

347
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.300
to do a lot more research in.

348
00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:23.209
Do we have any idea if it can occur

349
00:18:23.209 --> 00:18:27.859
in infants? I mean, what, what's the earliest age

350
00:18:27.859 --> 00:18:29.890
or ages it can occur?

351
00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.819
Um, SO the two studies that looked at juveniles,

352
00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:35.939
we're looking at sort of 8 to 12 year

353
00:18:35.939 --> 00:18:40.380
olds, roughly age range. So, um, by then, it

354
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:45.640
seems to, um. Uh, IT'S feasible that infants could

355
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.959
fall in love. Uh, I see no necessary reason

356
00:18:48.959 --> 00:18:52.280
why not, except for that perhaps when they're very

357
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.520
young infants, they're so focused on the mother that

358
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.800
the, uh, circuitry and, and brain and hormones are,

359
00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:03.400
are not, uh, able to focus their attention on,

360
00:19:03.489 --> 00:19:05.839
on someone else. They're just focusing on the mother.

361
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.760
So I suspect once they're no longer enthralled with

362
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.479
their mother, uh, it's a possibility.

363
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:15.239
Mhm. What functions does romantic love serve?

364
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.550
Uh, SO, like all types of love, uh, romantic

365
00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.229
love plays an important role in survival of the

366
00:19:22.229 --> 00:19:26.250
species. It essentially creates a team of two, instead

367
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:30.510
of a single mother, uh, that can facilitate survival

368
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.829
of the pregnant mother and the newborn infant. Uh,

369
00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:37.655
SO, at, at its grandest level, it promotes survival

370
00:19:37.655 --> 00:19:40.785
of offspring. Uh, THAT being said, romantic love is

371
00:19:40.785 --> 00:19:43.265
a bit unique among types of love in that

372
00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:47.305
it serves 4 very specific reproductive functions. So once

373
00:19:47.305 --> 00:19:49.145
again, with Jeff Kushnick and I, we, we looked

374
00:19:49.145 --> 00:19:52.185
at all the research and we sort of came

375
00:19:52.185 --> 00:19:56.464
up with 4 broad functions that romantic love serves.

376
00:19:56.584 --> 00:19:59.104
So it plays a role in Maho. When we're

377
00:19:59.104 --> 00:20:01.864
in love with someone, usually, we're pretty sure we

378
00:20:01.864 --> 00:20:04.104
want to be in a romantic relationship with that

379
00:20:04.104 --> 00:20:08.229
person. It plays a role in courtship, so sometimes

380
00:20:08.229 --> 00:20:10.109
we fall in love with someone before we're in

381
00:20:10.109 --> 00:20:13.150
a romantic relationship, and it motivates us to pursue

382
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:14.630
them and court them and make them be our

383
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:18.280
partner. It plays a role in sex. So couples

384
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.760
in love have a lot more sex than couples

385
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.310
who are not in love. And in our evolutionary

386
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.989
history, that would have usually resulted in pregnancy and,

387
00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.000
and procreation and so forth. It also plays a

388
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.760
role in paired bond formation. So it binds two

389
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.560
people together and gives them the shared experiences and

390
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.599
triggers the neurochemical processes required to form those really

391
00:20:39.599 --> 00:20:42.569
long-term bonds that can last years or decades or

392
00:20:42.569 --> 00:20:43.400
even a lifetime.

393
00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:48.540
Uh, SO what is the relationship then between romantic

394
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.189
love and pair bonding? I mean, when we see

395
00:20:51.189 --> 00:20:54.849
pair bonding in a particular species, should we look

396
00:20:54.849 --> 00:20:57.579
at it as a sign or as a potential

397
00:20:57.579 --> 00:21:00.739
sign of romantic love being present there?

398
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.849
Um, SO this is a difficult and slightly complex

399
00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:08.209
question to answer. And I know Helen Fisher got

400
00:21:08.209 --> 00:21:10.880
asked this question, uh, a heck of a lot.

401
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:16.040
Um, SO one of the functions of romantic love

402
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:20.209
is pair bond formation. And in humans, uh, social

403
00:21:20.209 --> 00:21:23.729
monogamy and pair bonds mean that the beginning stage

404
00:21:23.729 --> 00:21:28.010
where we create these relationships involves romantic love. That

405
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:32.194
being said, there's the possibility that That when romantic

406
00:21:32.194 --> 00:21:35.114
love emerged, it may not have emerged in the

407
00:21:35.114 --> 00:21:37.244
context of pair bonds, and it may have actually

408
00:21:37.244 --> 00:21:40.714
emerged as a sort of seasonal bonding. So you

409
00:21:40.714 --> 00:21:43.185
would have experienced romantic love for a period of,

410
00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:46.275
who knows, weeks or months or maybe a year

411
00:21:46.275 --> 00:21:48.714
or so. Uh, AND then at the end of

412
00:21:48.714 --> 00:21:51.194
it, people would part ways and go the other

413
00:21:51.194 --> 00:21:54.354
way. So in modern romantic love, pair bonds and

414
00:21:54.354 --> 00:21:59.239
romantic love are intricately entwined. Um, THAT being said,

415
00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.359
if you fall in love, it doesn't necessarily mean

416
00:22:01.359 --> 00:22:03.160
you will form those long-term pair bonds.

417
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.489
OK, so this, I imagine, will also be a

418
00:22:08.489 --> 00:22:12.930
tricky question or complicated question. Is romantic love an

419
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.260
evolved adaptation?

420
00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.359
I think it can better be described as a

421
00:22:18.359 --> 00:22:23.939
suite of adaptations and byproducts. So, David Bars in

422
00:22:23.939 --> 00:22:26.300
a book chapter in the Psychology of love and

423
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.780
then updated in subsequent, uh, editions, described love in

424
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.849
romantic relationships generally as a suite of adaptations. Uh,

425
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.209
AND in 2021, Jeff Kushnick and I extended this

426
00:22:39.209 --> 00:22:41.979
to suggest that romantic love, in particular, was a

427
00:22:41.979 --> 00:22:46.505
suite of adaptations and byproducts. Essentially, romantic. I've served

428
00:22:46.505 --> 00:22:51.485
so many unique specific functions and broad general functions,

429
00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:54.586
and involves so many different mechanisms that it, it,

430
00:22:54.836 --> 00:22:57.786
you, you can't consider it as a single adaptation.

431
00:22:57.916 --> 00:23:00.515
It's an amalgamation of a bunch of adaptations that

432
00:23:00.515 --> 00:23:04.276
all function together, uh, really well. Uh, AND we

433
00:23:04.276 --> 00:23:07.475
added the byproducts, uh, component on too, because we

434
00:23:07.475 --> 00:23:09.676
think there's some aspects that might have just piggybacked

435
00:23:09.676 --> 00:23:12.692
on. Other adaptations, uh, that are features of romantic

436
00:23:12.692 --> 00:23:15.812
love. So things perhaps like elevated mood might have

437
00:23:15.812 --> 00:23:19.572
just piggybacked on activity of the Msolimbic pathway or

438
00:23:19.572 --> 00:23:23.521
the behavioral activation system, and, uh, sleep variations. People

439
00:23:23.521 --> 00:23:26.291
in love, many of them experience variations to their

440
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:28.572
sleep. Uh, AND those may not be adaptations, those

441
00:23:28.572 --> 00:23:30.852
might just be byproducts. So I, I think it's,

442
00:23:30.932 --> 00:23:32.452
uh, it's fair to call it a suite of

443
00:23:32.452 --> 00:23:33.932
adaptations and byproducts.

444
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.250
Um, I, I mean, could you tell us more

445
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.810
about what these adaptations would be?

446
00:23:42.449 --> 00:23:46.479
Um, SO, to, to answer that, uh, you have

447
00:23:46.479 --> 00:23:49.640
to think about the, the functions, uh, that it

448
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:56.300
serves. So, um, Females in the animal kingdom tend

449
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.770
to be very choosy, uh, is the term used,

450
00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:02.780
uh, in terms of, of picking a mate. Uh,

451
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.599
THEY'RE unlikely to want to engage in sexual activity

452
00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:08.989
because they bear the highest cost of pregnancy and,

453
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:13.579
and reproduction. Romantic love serves as a sort of

454
00:24:13.579 --> 00:24:20.150
mechanism to increase females receptivity to Uh, romantic or

455
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.819
sexual advances. Um, WITHOUT romantic love, there's a, uh,

456
00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:26.390
a lot of people that would basically not enter

457
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:30.839
a romantic relationship, or, um, not, uh, have sex.

458
00:24:31.189 --> 00:24:34.229
Uh, ONE way of thinking about this is Frank's,

459
00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:38.270
uh, theory from 1988, uh, which basically says romantic

460
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.864
love is A commitment device. Uh, ANOTHER thing it

461
00:24:41.864 --> 00:24:45.064
does is it binds two people together, and it

462
00:24:45.064 --> 00:24:48.744
makes somebody invested in that relationship so that they're

463
00:24:48.744 --> 00:24:51.185
not going to go around and try to find

464
00:24:51.185 --> 00:24:54.025
another mate, uh, quickly, uh, a better mate, and

465
00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:56.625
so forth, so people can plan and, and invest

466
00:24:56.625 --> 00:25:00.704
in each other. Uh, SO those are two, adaptations

467
00:25:00.704 --> 00:25:02.665
that, uh, I, I think have occurred. But honestly,

468
00:25:02.744 --> 00:25:05.630
David David Buss says, um, Done some good work

469
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.630
on love and romantic relationships. He's got a whole

470
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.040
heap of, uh, of functions of romantic love. It,

471
00:25:10.069 --> 00:25:13.829
it overcomes a number of adaptive challenges. Um, IN

472
00:25:14.189 --> 00:25:16.670
the paper I've written with Jeff Kushnick, uh, I

473
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.579
think we, we've got about 50 different things that

474
00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.589
romantic love does. It's, uh, it's absolutely amazing.

475
00:25:23.989 --> 00:25:29.060
Evolutionarily speaking, do we know how old romantic love

476
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:29.540
is?

477
00:25:30.969 --> 00:25:35.239
No, uh, but we can make some educated guesses.

478
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.439
So the problem is that romantic love doesn't leave

479
00:25:38.439 --> 00:25:42.160
a fossil record. Um, WE can't just go back

480
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.930
and find a species and say, Oh, look, this

481
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.689
one was experiencing romantic love. Um, BUT we can

482
00:25:47.689 --> 00:25:49.969
make a number of educated guesses, and it's, it's

483
00:25:49.969 --> 00:25:52.130
sort of complicated how we get there. So coming

484
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.939
back to your question about pair bonds and, uh,

485
00:25:54.949 --> 00:25:59.250
romantic love, um, we have to first consider whether

486
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.920
we can trace the timing of the emergence of

487
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:07.550
the precursors to romantic love, or where these Uh,

488
00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:11.150
adaptations merged together and started looking like modern romantic

489
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:14.829
love. Um, SO we know that romantic love serves

490
00:26:14.829 --> 00:26:18.060
a role in pair bond formation, and that's, uh,

491
00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.709
associated with social monogamy. We know that social monogamy

492
00:26:21.709 --> 00:26:25.150
is associated with the reduction in sexual dimorphism. So

493
00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:29.030
species that are socially monogamous, there's different, uh, less

494
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.709
difference in stature and weight between females and males

495
00:26:32.709 --> 00:26:35.660
than in, um, species that are not socially monogamous.

496
00:26:35.819 --> 00:26:38.310
And, We can trace this in the fossil record.

497
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.869
It looks like a substantial reduction in sexual dimorphism

498
00:26:43.079 --> 00:26:45.839
first emerged in the vicinity of 2 million years

499
00:26:45.839 --> 00:26:50.400
ago in the hominin lineage, around Homo erectus or

500
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.939
mid Pleistocene, Homo. Um, uh, AND that seems to

501
00:26:53.939 --> 00:26:59.739
have been sustained throughout subsequent species, and, uh, maximizing

502
00:26:59.739 --> 00:27:03.819
its, uh, minimizing, sorry, it's difference, uh, around, um,

503
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.729
Homo hydrogen in the vicinity of half a million

504
00:27:06.729 --> 00:27:11.430
years ago. So this suggests that, Uh, an important

505
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.709
aspect of romantic love was present at least 2

506
00:27:14.709 --> 00:27:18.709
million years ago. Uh, THAT being said, it's possible

507
00:27:18.709 --> 00:27:21.569
that romantic love, something that looks like what we

508
00:27:21.569 --> 00:27:24.670
experienced today, may have emerged earlier as a form

509
00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.310
of seasonal bond, and that may not have been

510
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:30.829
associated with a reduction in sexual dimorphism. So it's

511
00:27:30.829 --> 00:27:32.949
possible it could have been earlier, but it, it's

512
00:27:32.949 --> 00:27:36.540
no later than about 2 million years ago. Now,

513
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.250
in terms of what modern romantic love looks like,

514
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.050
I think one of the driving selective pressures in

515
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.069
making it look the way it does is something

516
00:27:45.069 --> 00:27:49.420
called altriciality. So that's essentially a tendency for humans

517
00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:52.339
to be born almost premature because of our big

518
00:27:52.339 --> 00:27:54.260
brains, they wouldn't be able to fit through the

519
00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.260
birth canal. So we give birth to offspring with

520
00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.219
small underdeveloped brains who are basically useless for the

521
00:28:00.219 --> 00:28:03.810
1st 9 months. Um, AND I think the reason

522
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.410
that romantic love lasts in the vicinity. Of 18

523
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.489
months is because, uh, you would have pregnancy that

524
00:28:09.489 --> 00:28:11.530
would last in the vicinity of 9 months, and

525
00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.290
then this altritial state for, uh, on average about

526
00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:17.160
9 months. Uh, AND, and that would have extended

527
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.489
the length of time that people would have experienced

528
00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:23.050
romantic love. So, uh, I suspect, uh, we know

529
00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:26.000
that tritiality emerged in the vicinity of 1 to

530
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.130
2 million years ago. So sometime in 1 to

531
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.410
2 million year time frame ago, uh, it started

532
00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.160
to look probably a lot like what we experienced

533
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:35.410
today.

534
00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:41.369
So you mentioned 2 million years ago, then that

535
00:28:41.369 --> 00:28:45.520
puts us at the time of uh Homo erectus,

536
00:28:45.699 --> 00:28:45.849
right?

537
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.579
That's correct. That's that's the best.

538
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:53.290
Yeah. And I mean, how do we study romantic

539
00:28:53.290 --> 00:29:00.449
love in uh extinct hominin species and also how

540
00:29:00.449 --> 00:29:05.109
do we study it in ancient Homo sapiens? Uh

541
00:29:05.109 --> 00:29:10.050
ARE there any, for example, archaeological cues we can

542
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:10.609
look at?

543
00:29:11.329 --> 00:29:14.849
Um, SO, so like I said, sexual dimorphism is

544
00:29:14.849 --> 00:29:18.890
the, the main indicator of social monogamy. Um, AND

545
00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.930
that's where most of my thinking comes from. But

546
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:25.839
there's other changes in sexual dimorphism that, uh, occur,

547
00:29:26.189 --> 00:29:29.609
um, as well, such as, um, dental features. I

548
00:29:29.609 --> 00:29:32.760
think the canines reduce substantially, at least in males,

549
00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.920
uh, in species that are socially monogamous. And, um,

550
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:39.859
Helen Fisher actually speculated. Based on, uh, a reduction

551
00:29:39.859 --> 00:29:44.469
in dental, um, dimorphism and size, uh, that it

552
00:29:44.469 --> 00:29:46.819
might have emerged in the vicinity of 4.4 million

553
00:29:46.819 --> 00:29:50.739
years ago with Ardipithecus ramidus. Since she postulated that,

554
00:29:50.819 --> 00:29:53.219
um, we've got a lot more information about that

555
00:29:53.219 --> 00:29:56.180
species, and, uh, there's now questions as to whether

556
00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:59.859
it was either a hominid. So we are limited

557
00:29:59.859 --> 00:30:02.449
by what we can see in the fossil record,

558
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:06.530
um, and uh unfortunately that means we're never going

559
00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:09.819
to have a clear understanding of the evolution of

560
00:30:09.819 --> 00:30:11.250
romantic love in humans.

561
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.449
And what do we know about romantic love's phylogeny?

562
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:18.410
I mean, do we have a good understanding of

563
00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.380
its phylogenetic history?

564
00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.489
Uh, SO believe it or not, that's it, despite

565
00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.849
what I just said, uh, that's the thing we

566
00:30:26.849 --> 00:30:30.119
have the most comprehensive understanding of, um, and that's

567
00:30:30.119 --> 00:30:34.050
because it's really, really simple. So, chimpanzees and bonobos

568
00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:38.329
are our two closest living, uh, relatives, uh, and

569
00:30:38.329 --> 00:30:42.420
neither. OF those species display a state that's comparable

570
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.770
to romantic love. Uh, AS a result, we're pretty

571
00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:50.060
confident that romantic love emerged after the hominin split

572
00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.890
with the last common ancestor with those two species.

573
00:30:53.219 --> 00:30:56.959
So romantic love emerged in a hominin. We're the

574
00:30:56.959 --> 00:30:59.560
only living hominins around. There's a straight line from

575
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.750
that ancestor to us. Now, there would have been,

576
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.280
uh, some branches out with some dead ends from

577
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.640
our cousins who didn't make it. Um, Neanderthals, for

578
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.109
example, almost certainly experienced romantic love as well. Um,

579
00:31:12.239 --> 00:31:14.760
BUT in terms of living species, it's a straight

580
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.199
line from that hominin ancestor, probably Homo erectus, to

581
00:31:18.199 --> 00:31:18.520
us.

582
00:31:20.229 --> 00:31:25.420
Are there because you've talked there about uh primates

583
00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:30.689
and specifically great apes, but are there mammalian antecedents

584
00:31:30.689 --> 00:31:34.709
to romantic love? And if so, what would those

585
00:31:34.709 --> 00:31:34.949
be?

586
00:31:35.569 --> 00:31:37.750
Um, I think there are, and I think that's,

587
00:31:37.869 --> 00:31:40.760
uh, a useful way of thinking about things. This,

588
00:31:40.989 --> 00:31:44.219
this idea was first, um, proposed by Helen Fisher,

589
00:31:44.589 --> 00:31:47.310
uh, in, if it wasn't a '98 paper, it

590
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:51.219
was a, a 2000 paper, um, or 2001 paper,

591
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:56.790
I think. Uh, BASICALLY, she said that there are

592
00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:01.150
three emotional systems common to all mammals. So sexual

593
00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:07.689
desire, courtship attraction, and attachment. Um, AND so sexual

594
00:32:07.689 --> 00:32:10.010
desire is exactly what you think it would be.

595
00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:14.050
It, it drives us to become aroused and, and

596
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:17.489
engage in sexual activity. Courtship attraction is that initial

597
00:32:17.489 --> 00:32:21.329
attraction that motivates, uh, approach behaviors to, to pursue

598
00:32:21.329 --> 00:32:24.170
a mate, and attachment is associated with what you

599
00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:28.290
would find in, in pair bonds or in mother-infant

600
00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:31.839
love. Um, AND, and she basically said that courtship

601
00:32:31.839 --> 00:32:36.699
attraction was romantic love. Uh, AND therefore, romantic love

602
00:32:36.699 --> 00:32:40.819
has evolved out of, uh, an antecedent that is

603
00:32:40.819 --> 00:32:43.459
common to all mammals. Now, Helen was a bit

604
00:32:43.459 --> 00:32:47.339
wrong, uh, about courtship attraction and that being romantic

605
00:32:47.339 --> 00:32:52.140
love, but the general idea that these pre-existing mechanisms

606
00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.920
or systems, uh, that are common to mammals, uh,

607
00:32:56.099 --> 00:32:59.579
uh, are used in romantic love is true. So

608
00:32:59.579 --> 00:33:04.619
4% of, uh, mammals, pair bond, And something like

609
00:33:04.619 --> 00:33:07.699
30% of primate species pair bond, because pair bonding

610
00:33:07.699 --> 00:33:10.540
is associated with romantic love, it seems to indicate

611
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.680
that mammals to some extent and certainly primates, have

612
00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:18.089
the infrastructure needed to engage in pair bond formation.

613
00:33:18.339 --> 00:33:20.829
um, AND that's almost certainly the case.

614
00:33:22.569 --> 00:33:26.060
So what would be, or do you already have

615
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:31.780
an account of how romantic love evolved from its

616
00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:37.359
antecedents or precursors up to uh the more modern

617
00:33:37.359 --> 00:33:39.689
manifestations of romantic love?

618
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.199
So it's sort of. So it's a really good

619
00:33:44.199 --> 00:33:46.869
question, uh, and an interesting question and something I've

620
00:33:46.869 --> 00:33:49.109
thought a lot about. Uh, SO the topic of

621
00:33:49.109 --> 00:33:52.949
my PhD thesis is the evolutionary history of romantic

622
00:33:52.949 --> 00:33:55.109
love. And so I need to just be clear,

623
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.500
before I started my thesis 5 years ago or

624
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:02.270
so, we knew basically nothing about the evolutionary history

625
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.270
of romantic love. I, I know Helen Fisher was

626
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:07.824
renowned as the world's ending. Expert on the evolution

627
00:34:07.824 --> 00:34:10.385
of romantic love. But if you read her academic

628
00:34:10.385 --> 00:34:14.063
texts and even her popular science work, she actually

629
00:34:14.063 --> 00:34:17.225
didn't talk at all about the evolutionary history of

630
00:34:17.225 --> 00:34:19.784
romantic love. She spoke about the evolutionary history of

631
00:34:19.784 --> 00:34:24.264
pair bonds. She spoke about, um, the functions of

632
00:34:24.264 --> 00:34:26.304
romantic love. But when it comes to just the

633
00:34:26.304 --> 00:34:29.543
nitty gritty of, of romantic love, uh, there, there

634
00:34:29.543 --> 00:34:34.708
was almost nothing written about it. Um, SO, There's

635
00:34:34.879 --> 00:34:39.449
two scenarios in which romantic love evolved. Either it

636
00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:42.969
emerged as a type of seasonal bond, and that

637
00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:45.610
would have lasted a matter of months or maybe

638
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:48.020
a year or something that probably would have been

639
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.969
quite intense, and then sometime after that, pair bonds

640
00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:56.139
evolved out of that. Um, THE second scenario is

641
00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:59.540
that pair bonds evolved, and there was this short

642
00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.020
period, maybe a matter of hours or days at

643
00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:05.260
the beginning, that resulted in pair bond formation. And

644
00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:09.250
over time, as a result of altrutiality, probably extended.

645
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.219
Um, THERE'S reasons to believe one or the other

646
00:35:12.219 --> 00:35:16.449
might be likely, but having read what I've read,

647
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.780
I'm not convinced that one or the other is,

648
00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.300
is probably more likely. So at the beginning, there

649
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.929
would have been a series of mutations. Um, uh,

650
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:30.709
AND I think mutation, because social monogamy in primates

651
00:35:30.709 --> 00:35:33.949
is pretty bimodal. You can either tell a species

652
00:35:33.949 --> 00:35:37.389
is either socially monogamous or, or it's not. I,

653
00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:40.540
I know there's some people like Augustine Fuentes, who,

654
00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:43.469
who argue social monogamy is a continuum, but I

655
00:35:43.469 --> 00:35:45.389
think in, in his work, he sort of conflates

656
00:35:45.389 --> 00:35:48.270
sexual and social monogamy a little bit and doesn't

657
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:53.750
acknowledge that other behavioral repertoires can attach to, um,

658
00:35:54.429 --> 00:35:58.469
To pair bonding or socially monogamous behaviors. So, like,

659
00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:02.580
it's unlikely to have resulted from, from genetic drift

660
00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:04.669
or those other processes. I think, I think there

661
00:36:04.669 --> 00:36:08.590
were mutations. And then natural selection played a role

662
00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:12.260
because these mutations conveyed some sort of reproductive advantage.

663
00:36:12.469 --> 00:36:15.070
And as I've suggested, that's probably going to be

664
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:18.580
survival of the pregnant mother and survival of the

665
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:23.290
infant during the first altricial, um, stage. Um, THE

666
00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:27.399
other thing we know is that the species that

667
00:36:27.969 --> 00:36:31.649
first developed social monogamy or possibly romantic love was

668
00:36:31.649 --> 00:36:35.729
not territorial. So some of the biological anthropology research

669
00:36:35.729 --> 00:36:39.530
I've done has found that territoriality does not precede

670
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:43.169
the evolution of social monogamy in non-human primates. So

671
00:36:43.169 --> 00:36:46.719
that's, um, potentially selective pressure, if you will, or,

672
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:48.739
or some other factor. That they may have contributed

673
00:36:48.739 --> 00:36:52.399
to it. Um, THERE'S other theories about what selective

674
00:36:52.399 --> 00:36:55.879
pressures might have driven the evolution of social monogamy,

675
00:36:56.169 --> 00:36:59.729
um, or romantic love. So like infanticide or dispersed

676
00:36:59.729 --> 00:37:04.330
females or solitary females. But there's, uh, uncertainty in

677
00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:06.209
the literature, and we really don't know what, what

678
00:37:06.209 --> 00:37:10.290
the big drivers were. Um, NOW, another thing that

679
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:12.689
we do know is that sexual selection, probably from

680
00:37:12.689 --> 00:37:15.860
early on, uh, started to play a role. Uh,

681
00:37:15.979 --> 00:37:19.500
SO I've undertaken a, a study with Severy Luoto

682
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.669
and Phil Caberard that looked at sex differences in

683
00:37:21.669 --> 00:37:24.459
romantic love. And, uh, we looked at people from

684
00:37:24.459 --> 00:37:26.500
33 different countries, and we were able to find

685
00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.060
a number of small but meaningful differences in the

686
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.419
expression of romantic love. So we looked at things

687
00:37:32.419 --> 00:37:36.729
like how often people fall in love. Um, WHEN

688
00:37:36.739 --> 00:37:38.729
individuals fall in love relative to when they started

689
00:37:38.729 --> 00:37:43.429
their romantic relationship. Uh, HOW intensely they experience romantic

690
00:37:43.429 --> 00:37:47.060
love, how much they obsess about their partner, or

691
00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.270
think obsessively about their partner, and commitment. Uh, AND

692
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:52.310
we found a number of small, meaningful differences. I,

693
00:37:52.389 --> 00:37:55.669
I think the most notable is probably that males

694
00:37:55.669 --> 00:37:58.229
fall in love about 1 month earlier than do

695
00:37:58.229 --> 00:38:00.669
females. So in our sample, we found that men

696
00:38:00.669 --> 00:38:03.429
fall in love, on average, about 1 month after

697
00:38:03.429 --> 00:38:06.429
starting a romantic relationship, whereas women fall in love

698
00:38:06.429 --> 00:38:09.899
about 2 months after starting a romantic relationship. Uh,

699
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.239
AND we think this was, uh, as a result

700
00:38:12.239 --> 00:38:16.860
of sexual selection, basically because romantic love serves as

701
00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.679
an honest signal of commitment. Uh, LIKE I suggested

702
00:38:20.679 --> 00:38:24.199
before, females are choosier. They're not going to want

703
00:38:24.199 --> 00:38:27.280
to engage in sexual activity with someone who isn't

704
00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.719
going to help support them, uh, through, uh, a

705
00:38:30.719 --> 00:38:33.350
period of pregnancy, and, and In the, the infancy

706
00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:38.590
of the child. So women or females started, uh,

707
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:42.389
choosing to mate with men who displayed romantic love

708
00:38:42.389 --> 00:38:45.310
a little bit earlier. This was heritable, and their

709
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:47.989
offspring, in turn, the males would fall in love

710
00:38:47.989 --> 00:38:50.340
a bit earlier than the females and so forth.

711
00:38:50.909 --> 00:38:54.179
Um, SO there's a few other things we know.

712
00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.409
So, Uh, variation exists in the expression of romantic

713
00:38:58.409 --> 00:39:03.159
love, we know that, uh, One of the elements

714
00:39:03.159 --> 00:39:05.840
of, for romantic love, uh, for evolution to occur

715
00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.729
is variation. And I've done a study with Phil

716
00:39:08.729 --> 00:39:12.610
Cavanagh, again, that basically was able to demonstrate there's

717
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.409
extreme variation in terms of the intensity of romantic

718
00:39:15.409 --> 00:39:19.169
love, uh, obsessive thinking about a loved one, commitment

719
00:39:19.169 --> 00:39:22.649
and frequency of sex. So this sort of indicates

720
00:39:22.649 --> 00:39:26.530
that, uh, it's possible that aspects of romantic love

721
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:31.080
might still be under selection. Um, BUT honestly, other

722
00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.520
than that, we know very little. It's really hard

723
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.040
to study, and people just haven't been looking at

724
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.560
this for, well, basically since the beginning. I'm, I'm

725
00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.489
genuinely the first to, uh, have done a systematic

726
00:39:43.489 --> 00:39:45.750
investigation of, of how romantic love evolved.

727
00:39:46.959 --> 00:39:50.120
Uh, AND where does that variation that you mentioned

728
00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.360
there stem from? I mean, does it have anything

729
00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.439
to do with individual differences or is it something

730
00:39:57.439 --> 00:39:57.899
else?

731
00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:02.419
Yeah, so it's definitely individual differences. It's largely driven

732
00:40:02.419 --> 00:40:09.100
by biology and genes. Um, AND, um, it probably

733
00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:13.139
is colored by culture or the experience with the

734
00:40:13.139 --> 00:40:15.139
other partner. So, for example, if I have a

735
00:40:15.139 --> 00:40:18.649
partner who likes to have a lot of sex,

736
00:40:18.939 --> 00:40:21.060
I'm more likely to have a lot of sex.

737
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:25.350
So there, there's, uh, environmental factors that do play

738
00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:26.750
a role, but I think a lot of this

739
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:29.750
is driven by genetics. Uh, 11 thing I would

740
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:31.820
say is we don't know for certain if there's

741
00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:38.520
any, uh, reproductive advantages to any particular, um, variation,

742
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.270
uh, that we've found. I suspect what we might

743
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:43.030
find is that the couples that like to have

744
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.129
a lot of sex. Um, ARE probably more likely

745
00:40:46.129 --> 00:40:49.530
to accidentally get pregnant. So in the modern environment,

746
00:40:49.729 --> 00:40:52.169
the variation or the phenotype that has a lot

747
00:40:52.169 --> 00:40:57.189
of sex, uh, may be, um, more reproductively advantaged,

748
00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:59.889
and over the next 10 or 20 or 30

749
00:40:59.889 --> 00:41:03.330
1000 years, we might find that humans evolved to

750
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.280
have a lot more sex than we used to,

751
00:41:05.489 --> 00:41:06.449
uh, when we're in love.

752
00:41:07.429 --> 00:41:10.810
Mhm. So tell us a little bit more about

753
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:16.739
your hypothesis that romantic love evolved by co-opting mother

754
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.419
infant bonding.

755
00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:23.850
Yeah, so, um, Like I said, the, the topic

756
00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:27.429
of my thesis is, uh, the evolution of romantic

757
00:41:27.429 --> 00:41:31.050
love. And I wrote a review article using Tinbergen's

758
00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:34.449
framework, uh, with Jeff Kushnick, which detailed the, the

759
00:41:34.449 --> 00:41:37.209
four approaches in romantic love. And I, I needed

760
00:41:37.209 --> 00:41:41.540
to write some other papers, basically. Um, AND I

761
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:45.330
thought, uh, in, in that review, uh, I introduced

762
00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:49.120
two evolutionary theories, uh, Helen Fisher's theory of Independent

763
00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.379
Emotion systems. And Larry Young's uh theory that pair

764
00:41:53.379 --> 00:41:58.560
bonds evolved by co-opting mother-infant bonding. Um, SO I

765
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.959
basically read everything Helen Fisher had written on the

766
00:42:01.959 --> 00:42:04.879
topic. Uh, AND I realized she, she didn't actually

767
00:42:04.879 --> 00:42:07.669
talk much about the evolutionary history of romantic love.

768
00:42:07.919 --> 00:42:09.479
And, and some of the stuff she had to

769
00:42:09.479 --> 00:42:12.280
say was quite speculative, and, and the research had

770
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.379
progressed, so she, she was incorrect about a, a,

771
00:42:14.479 --> 00:42:16.760
a number of things. And, and I turned my

772
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.239
attention to Larry Young's work. Uh, AND it seems

773
00:42:20.239 --> 00:42:24.080
eminently reasonable that pair bonds may have evolved by

774
00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:28.219
co-opting mother infant bonding. So co-option is the evolutionary

775
00:42:28.219 --> 00:42:32.090
process whereby a trait takes on a new function.

776
00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:37.449
Um, SO think, for example, um, a, an umbrella.

777
00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:40.219
Um, IT'S used to keep the rain off our

778
00:42:40.219 --> 00:42:41.860
heads, but you can also give it a new

779
00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.060
function to keep the sun out of our eyes.

780
00:42:44.229 --> 00:42:46.620
Um, SO that's sort of an example by co-option.

781
00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.229
Anyway, I, I, I did a bit of reading,

782
00:42:49.239 --> 00:42:50.899
and I, I, I did a bit more reading

783
00:42:50.899 --> 00:42:54.520
about what we know about the psychology and neuroscience

784
00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.179
and endocrinology of romantic love. I found that some

785
00:42:57.179 --> 00:43:01.100
people had actually sort of tested, um, Larry Young's

786
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.100
theory. Um, AND there were a number of studies

787
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:09.189
that had compared. Uh, ROMANTIC love with maternal love.

788
00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:11.870
Uh, SO I thought, yeah, there's, there's enough here

789
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:15.439
to write a seminal paper considering whether romantic love

790
00:43:15.439 --> 00:43:18.879
in particular might have evolved, uh, by co-opting mother

791
00:43:18.879 --> 00:43:22.580
infant bonding. So, in that hypothesis paper, I start

792
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:26.179
off by looking at the psychology of romantic love

793
00:43:26.179 --> 00:43:28.659
and mother infant bonding. And there was a, a

794
00:43:28.659 --> 00:43:34.340
paper by Lekman and Mays in 1999, which basically

795
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:39.850
considered the romantic, uh, the psychology of, uh, Both

796
00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.520
mother infant bonding and romantic love. And they found,

797
00:43:42.689 --> 00:43:45.929
uh, a number of interesting similarities. Um, BOTH are

798
00:43:45.929 --> 00:43:50.010
altered mental states, both involve obsessive thoughts, both involve

799
00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:54.330
longing for rec reciprocity, um, both involve idealization of

800
00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:58.679
the other proximity seeking and time-limited duration. Psychologically speaking,

801
00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:02.270
um, that these two states look similar. So then

802
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:04.350
I had a look at the neuroimaging research, and

803
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:06.580
there was actually a paper by Bartels and Zzey.

804
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:09.189
Now, Bartels and Zey in 2000 were the first

805
00:44:09.189 --> 00:44:13.060
to undertake an FMRI, uh, study of romantic love.

806
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.550
And they followed this up in 2004 by looking

807
00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.370
at mothers with newborn infants, and they compared them,

808
00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:20.439
and they found a number of similarities in regions

809
00:44:20.439 --> 00:44:23.659
rich in oxytocin and basopressin. There's also been a,

810
00:44:23.709 --> 00:44:26.739
a, a few meta-analysis, so Ortegan colleagues did a,

811
00:44:27.129 --> 00:44:29.370
Uh, meta-analysis of a handful of studies of love,

812
00:44:29.379 --> 00:44:32.000
and they found similarities across all types of love.

813
00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:37.649
She and colleagues in 2022, uh, compared 9, studies

814
00:44:37.649 --> 00:44:41.090
of romantic love, and they found activity, uh, of

815
00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:43.989
the left ventral tegmental area was common to both

816
00:44:43.989 --> 00:44:46.610
romantic love and mother-infant bonding. And there was a,

817
00:44:46.649 --> 00:44:49.850
a great meta-analysis by Rigo and colleagues that, uh,

818
00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:53.209
considered 12 studies of mothers, of newborn. And the

819
00:44:53.209 --> 00:44:56.489
way they described the neural activity in mother infant

820
00:44:56.489 --> 00:44:59.370
bonding or maternal love was very similar to the

821
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:01.929
way uh people would describe romantic love. So this

822
00:45:01.929 --> 00:45:05.010
involved in particular structures like the ventral tegmental area,

823
00:45:05.129 --> 00:45:10.389
amygdala, striatum, and insular. Um, THERE'S also similarities in

824
00:45:10.389 --> 00:45:15.629
the endocrinology, so there's, um, strong empirical and theoretical

825
00:45:15.629 --> 00:45:19.350
reasons to believe that dopamine, oxytocin, and bata endorphin

826
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:24.739
are involved in in both states. Um, SO, The

827
00:45:24.739 --> 00:45:27.260
similarities were there, I in in my paper, I

828
00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:31.179
basically outline what the similarities are, and then I

829
00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:34.149
sort of use a bit of Fisher's model. Uh,

830
00:45:34.229 --> 00:45:38.399
AND evidence from Prairie voles and evidence from neuroimaging

831
00:45:38.629 --> 00:45:41.550
to sort of argue, uh, for a, a new

832
00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:46.310
revised mechanistic model of romantic love. So, uh, I

833
00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:50.060
basically say that romantic love evolved by co-opting three

834
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:54.020
specific systems from mother-infant bonding. So these are bonding

835
00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.590
attraction, which, uh, focuses energies on the loved one

836
00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:02.209
and promotes caregiving and proximity seeking. Uh, IT co-opted,

837
00:46:02.399 --> 00:46:06.840
uh, obsessive thinking. So in mother infant bonding, thinking

838
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.919
about the baby a lot stops you from forgetting

839
00:46:08.919 --> 00:46:11.199
the baby, so you can keep it alive. It's

840
00:46:11.199 --> 00:46:13.919
function in romantic love is a bit uncertain. I'm,

841
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.679
I'm not really clear, but it's obviously important cause

842
00:46:16.679 --> 00:46:20.040
it's still there. Uh, AND it also co-opted attachment,

843
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:23.489
which is, uh, that ability to create and maintain

844
00:46:23.489 --> 00:46:28.449
bonds. And these three systems combined with two pre-existing

845
00:46:28.449 --> 00:46:32.090
reproductive systems. So it combined with courtship attraction, which

846
00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:35.159
Helen Fisher has, has detailed, uh, uh, uh. A

847
00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:39.510
lot. Uh, AND it also merged with sexual desire.

848
00:46:39.639 --> 00:46:42.939
So I brought these reproductive aspects in with the,

849
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.939
the love that's similar to mother-infant bonding, and it,

850
00:46:45.959 --> 00:46:49.540
it creates this whole suite of adaptations and byproducts.

851
00:46:49.719 --> 00:46:53.560
Uh, Helen Fisher read a, uh, draft of the

852
00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.909
paper, and Larry Young, uh, read the published paper.

853
00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.500
Unfortunately, both of those people passed away last year,

854
00:47:00.679 --> 00:47:03.239
uh, quite sadly, but Larry Young said the paper

855
00:47:03.239 --> 00:47:06.030
was awesome. So I'll take that to mean there's

856
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:09.149
at least some scientific usefulness uh with what I've

857
00:47:09.149 --> 00:47:09.949
managed to write.

858
00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.899
Great. So, uh, let me ask you now, this

859
00:47:14.899 --> 00:47:19.260
studying romantic love tell us anything about what would

860
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:24.959
potentially be Our predominant mating system. I mean, because

861
00:47:24.959 --> 00:47:31.879
there's a very complicated, complex discussion surrounding this issue.

862
00:47:31.929 --> 00:47:37.600
I mean, whether we are predominantly monogamous or polygamous

863
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.840
and if we are polygamous, uh, I mean, uh,

864
00:47:40.919 --> 00:47:44.239
I, I, I wouldn't imagine that anyone would say

865
00:47:44.239 --> 00:47:48.399
that we are predominantly polyandros because that only occurs

866
00:47:48.399 --> 00:47:52.040
in a At best, a handful of societies in

867
00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:56.520
certain very specific ecological circumstances, it can occur, but

868
00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:01.199
it's certainly not uh that common. So, uh, or

869
00:48:01.199 --> 00:48:06.199
even another alternative would be polyamory. I mean, does

870
00:48:06.199 --> 00:48:10.469
studying romantic love, uh, or can it inform us

871
00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:14.919
about that? Or can it uh contribute anything to

872
00:48:15.199 --> 00:48:16.669
that sort of discussion?

873
00:48:17.139 --> 00:48:19.100
So I think it can contribute a bit, but

874
00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:23.060
it's definitely not going to answer the question. So

875
00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:28.689
humans are amazing, uh in that our human mating

876
00:48:28.689 --> 00:48:35.000
repertoire is full of variety. Um, SO, um, some

877
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.389
people can do polyamory, some people will be single,

878
00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.080
some people will have a series of, of short-term

879
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.199
trips throughout their life. Some people will be in

880
00:48:43.199 --> 00:48:46.199
a romantic relationship for their entire life. Some people

881
00:48:46.199 --> 00:48:49.790
will be polygynist. Um, ALL these things are possible,

882
00:48:50.159 --> 00:48:55.159
um, that some people don't experience romantic love, um,

883
00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.969
reinforces that even singledom is probably one of the

884
00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:04.070
Variety of human, human mating that humans exist. I,

885
00:49:04.149 --> 00:49:06.030
I think it's important to recognize that even in

886
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:08.679
a polygynous society, there's a lot of social monogamy

887
00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:11.389
that goes on. So men at the top, men

888
00:49:11.389 --> 00:49:14.709
at the top have many wives, men at the

889
00:49:14.709 --> 00:49:16.949
bottom have no wives, and there's a whole bunch

890
00:49:16.949 --> 00:49:20.169
in the middle with one. Maybe 2, but a

891
00:49:20.169 --> 00:49:22.879
lot, a lot of 1. SO I, I tend

892
00:49:22.879 --> 00:49:26.530
to think that social monogamy has won out. It

893
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:29.370
certainly interacts with culture in the modern world, to

894
00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:32.620
have one out. It's the norm and legally enforced

895
00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.689
in, in a lot of cultures. Um, I'm happy

896
00:49:34.689 --> 00:49:38.409
to back social monogamy as, as the predominant, uh,

897
00:49:38.449 --> 00:49:41.689
mating system in modern humans, at least, uh, as

898
00:49:41.689 --> 00:49:44.560
we experience now. And romantic love tells us just

899
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.129
that little bit of extra information that might inform

900
00:49:47.129 --> 00:49:47.610
that debate.

901
00:49:49.129 --> 00:49:53.669
And what are the relative contributions of genes slash

902
00:49:53.669 --> 00:49:58.550
biology and culture to romantic love and how it

903
00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:59.709
gets expressed?

904
00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:03.600
Yeah, probably not the best to answer that. I'm

905
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:08.570
really poorly read on uh the contribution that culture

906
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:12.500
makes to, Uh, behavior. Uh, IT'S definitely one of

907
00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.020
my weak points. You've got to remember, I'm just

908
00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.459
a PhD student. I haven't been doing this long

909
00:50:16.459 --> 00:50:19.090
enough to, to be really well read on things.

910
00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:22.870
Um, I know that there's some studies, mainly from

911
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:27.070
the University of Bratislav, um, uh, um, Pyotr Sorakowski

912
00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:29.780
and Marta Koval, um, have done a number of

913
00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:34.250
studies looking at things like modernization, collectivism, And gender

914
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:39.739
equality. And all those national level cultural indicators seem

915
00:50:39.739 --> 00:50:43.810
to influence how intensely people express passion, intimacy, and

916
00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:47.800
commitment, uh, when they're in romantic relationships. I, um,

917
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.810
use this, and I, I've got some preliminary evidence

918
00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:55.250
showing that the more gender equal, um, a country

919
00:50:55.250 --> 00:51:00.520
is, the less intensely. Um, PEOPLE experience romantic love.

920
00:51:00.929 --> 00:51:04.610
Um, SO there certainly are indications that cultural factors

921
00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:07.280
can play a role in how romantic love expresses.

922
00:51:07.489 --> 00:51:09.209
Now, in terms of the, the nitty gritty of

923
00:51:09.209 --> 00:51:11.649
what culture can do, I know Victor Karen Dashev

924
00:51:11.649 --> 00:51:15.030
has written two books on, on culture and love

925
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:18.080
generally. Uh, AND he does consider romantic love in,

926
00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:20.649
in bits and pieces. And he really emphasizes the

927
00:51:20.649 --> 00:51:25.489
cultural influence that, um, The, the, the, the influence

928
00:51:25.489 --> 00:51:28.969
that culture can have on expressing love. Uh, THAT

929
00:51:28.969 --> 00:51:32.090
being said, my reading of everything today leads me

930
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:36.370
to believe that romantic love is largely and primarily

931
00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:39.290
driven by biology. It's got all these common threads

932
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:42.370
that you would find across cultures. Um, AND the

933
00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:46.840
culture sort of adds that color. Uh, TO the

934
00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.199
expression of, of romantic love. Um, IT'S, it's very

935
00:51:50.199 --> 00:51:53.310
important and it can't happen without it. And obviously,

936
00:51:53.439 --> 00:51:56.449
the genes and culture are going to interact, uh,

937
00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.919
in, in, in particular ways, and you're going to

938
00:51:58.919 --> 00:52:01.639
get expression in all sorts of ways. Um, BUT,

939
00:52:01.719 --> 00:52:05.000
uh, uh, uh, it's very biologically driven. It's a

940
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.169
very powerful force.

941
00:52:07.479 --> 00:52:09.479
By the way, I, I, I don't, I'm not

942
00:52:09.479 --> 00:52:13.840
sure if you also study this kind of issues

943
00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:18.719
specifically, but do, do you know if there's any

944
00:52:18.719 --> 00:52:24.080
connection and what that connection would be between romantic

945
00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.320
love and marriage because, I mean, there are people

946
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:34.820
who study marriage specifically as a so. INSTITUTION, let's

947
00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:38.899
say, particularly anthropologists, and then there are people who

948
00:52:38.899 --> 00:52:43.709
study romantic love and mating systems and things like

949
00:52:43.709 --> 00:52:49.739
that. Sometimes, uh, marriage intersects with some of uh

950
00:52:49.739 --> 00:52:53.370
what people study when it comes to mating systems,

951
00:52:53.379 --> 00:52:57.610
but, uh, I mean, is there any link there?

952
00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:02.760
Um, SO I haven't read enough to be able

953
00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:05.479
to answer that question, but I, I can maybe

954
00:53:05.479 --> 00:53:09.080
make a comment about how romantic love might lead

955
00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:13.209
to marriage, mediated by pair bonds, for example. So

956
00:53:13.209 --> 00:53:15.800
I've got a, my, the romantic love survey's got

957
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.280
a longitudinal component. And I did a preliminary study

958
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.560
seeing if any of the features of romantic love

959
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:26.439
were associated with breaking up six months later. Nothing.

960
00:53:26.919 --> 00:53:31.409
Nothing associated with romantic love, um, was associated with

961
00:53:31.409 --> 00:53:35.959
breaking up six months later. So, I, I think,

962
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:41.159
um, Whatever it is that makes us continue into

963
00:53:41.159 --> 00:53:45.530
long-term pair bonds might be, Partly biological. There's been

964
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:49.840
one FMRI study that has looked at, um, predictors

965
00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.050
of staying together 40 months later, and they found

966
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:55.649
4 structures, activity in 4 structures was associated with

967
00:53:55.649 --> 00:53:58.810
staying together. Um, IN terms of, of what gets

968
00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:02.840
people to turn marriage into, uh, sorry, romantic love

969
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.169
into marriage, uh, I, I really don't have a

970
00:54:05.169 --> 00:54:07.169
clue, but that would be a fascinating area to

971
00:54:07.169 --> 00:54:07.449
study.

972
00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:12.020
Yeah. So let me ask you now about a

973
00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:15.469
specific aspect of romantic love. I think you've probably

974
00:54:15.479 --> 00:54:19.989
already touched on it earlier, but does romantic love

975
00:54:19.989 --> 00:54:22.780
lead to increased sexual activity?

976
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.120
Uh, ALMOST certainly. Um, SO like I said earlier,

977
00:54:27.239 --> 00:54:29.570
one of the functions of remaining Glove is actually

978
00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:34.560
sex. Uh, SO we, we know from representative studies

979
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.040
of the United States that long-term married couples have

980
00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.159
sex about one time per week. I mean, it,

981
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.199
there's obviously a lot of variation. Some people are

982
00:54:42.199 --> 00:54:43.879
not at all, and some people are a lot

983
00:54:43.879 --> 00:54:46.909
more, but on average, they found in this large

984
00:54:46.909 --> 00:54:49.659
representative study, the long-term married couples. Have sex about

985
00:54:49.659 --> 00:54:51.590
once per week. Data that I've got from the

986
00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:54.500
Romantic Love survey, which admittedly is young adults, so

987
00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.899
you would presume they would have sex a little

988
00:54:56.899 --> 00:54:59.979
bit more. Um, BUT they're having sex when they're

989
00:54:59.979 --> 00:55:02.449
in love, on average about 3 times per week.

990
00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.419
That's a fair bit more than, than once a

991
00:55:05.419 --> 00:55:09.639
week. Um, I think we can Pretty confidently say

992
00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:12.520
that uh romantic love causes people to have more

993
00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:15.989
sex, obviously when they're in a romantic uh relationship.

994
00:55:16.239 --> 00:55:21.260
So, is there anything else about romantic love, uh,

995
00:55:21.389 --> 00:55:23.629
you would like to tell us about that I

996
00:55:23.629 --> 00:55:26.120
might have missed in my questions,

997
00:55:26.129 --> 00:55:31.149
or? Uh, SO it's an incredibly understudied area for

998
00:55:31.149 --> 00:55:34.550
something that is probably a human universal, as the

999
00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:38.750
foundation for romantic relationship and family formation throughout almost

1000
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:41.429
the entirety of the world. There is a lot

1001
00:55:41.429 --> 00:55:44.949
of low hanging fruit. Researchers who are interested in

1002
00:55:44.949 --> 00:55:48.760
delving into a new, interesting topical area. Um, I'd

1003
00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:51.030
really encourage you to get on board. If you've

1004
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:53.510
got any questions, send me an email. I'll, I'll

1005
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:55.860
tell you how you can get involved. It's a

1006
00:55:55.860 --> 00:56:00.149
fascinating, interesting area of research. Um, IT, it, it's

1007
00:56:00.149 --> 00:56:02.580
an opportunity for people to, to make their careers,

1008
00:56:02.669 --> 00:56:05.909
uh, uh, on a new, new area. Um, GET

1009
00:56:05.909 --> 00:56:07.830
on board. It's, it's absolutely fascinating.

1010
00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:12.129
Yes, it certainly is. And where can people find

1011
00:56:12.129 --> 00:56:13.510
