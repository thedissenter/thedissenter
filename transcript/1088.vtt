00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:03.099
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:05.929
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:09.369
today I'm joined by Doctor Caroline Wisner. She's professor

4
00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.369
of Complexity Sciences at the University of Potsdam. And

5
00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.729
today we're going to talk about her book, What

6
00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:19.850
is a Complex System. So, Doctor Wisner, welcome to

7
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.610
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:25.139
Pleasure is with me. Thank you for having me.

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.950
OK, so let's start perhaps with a bit of

10
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.959
background here just for people who are not really

11
00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:35.619
familiar with the topic to get a little bit

12
00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:40.619
more familiarized with it. So, what is complexity, science,

13
00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:44.189
how old is it? Tell us a little bit

14
00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:45.790
about it and its history.

15
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.270
Yeah, happy to. Complexity science is not a very

16
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.389
old science. On the contrary, it's it's quite a

17
00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:58.759
recent science. And I suppose one of the reasons

18
00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:01.930
is that it relies on other sciences to have

19
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.019
been around at the time. 11 could say that

20
00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:09.180
complexity science really is from the 1980s, and of

21
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.059
course that can be debated. Um, AND the sciences

22
00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:17.220
that were very, you know, played a big role

23
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.059
at the time where things like well dynamical systems

24
00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:27.599
theory. Uh, CYBERNETICS, um, systems theory in general, cellular

25
00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:33.239
automata, and, and more broadly, um, computer science, which

26
00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.779
was quite a recent science at that time, actually.

27
00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:41.419
So, um, the origins of complexity sciences are, I

28
00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:45.739
would say, found in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s around

29
00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:49.059
those sciences which I'm happy to talk more about.

30
00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.019
Um, THERE was a theory of probability, statistical methods,

31
00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:57.769
that, that was all, um. PLAYED a huge role

32
00:01:57.769 --> 00:02:03.059
for complexity science to come about. And the uh

33
00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:06.059
availability of computational power really made it possible to

34
00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:09.970
think about complex systems the way we do now.

35
00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:17.729
Because complex systems, or yeah, um. Complex systems are

36
00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:23.210
very much data driven, because they rely so heavily

37
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.770
on a myriad of uh observations to be made

38
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.639
about tiny little things that together give something. Interesting,

39
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.610
um, and I'm sure we, we talk about more

40
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.759
examples throughout our conversation. Um, THAT I would say

41
00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:47.210
is complexity science is the Observation, modeling and prediction

42
00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:50.960
of systems that consist of many, many elements with

43
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.800
many, many interactions that together form something that the

44
00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:59.649
individual elements could not, um, some behavior that is

45
00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.539
emerging out of these interactions. If you like, I

46
00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:07.970
say a bit more about um. What people would

47
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.929
consider the starting point of complexity science, and that

48
00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:15.770
can be argued, of course, um, but one point

49
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.009
in history where we could pin it down if

50
00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:22.050
we wanted to is in the 1980s where people

51
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.050
started to think about, well, these, I'm not sure

52
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.809
I used the term emergence yet, but sooner or

53
00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:32.529
later we will have to um emerging phenomena that

54
00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:37.570
were Observed in computer programs were seemingly from very

55
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.029
simple rules, suddenly something emerged that was not built

56
00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.110
into these rules directly, but it came out of

57
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.479
um out of these rules as a as a

58
00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:52.889
consequence of many interactions, feedback. Um, NOISE to, uh,

59
00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.869
in, in some cases. And these cellular automata were

60
00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.830
studied and people started to think about, well, how

61
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.110
come that these very simple things can can exhibit

62
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.639
such interesting emergent behavior, the um The game of

63
00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.639
life might be familiar to some people in the

64
00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.309
audience, which is, which is really just a computer

65
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.600
program, and it doesn't even have any noise in

66
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.480
it. And yet it looks like on the screen

67
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.510
things start to become alive, whereas really underneath it

68
00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.279
it's just a collection of a small collection of

69
00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:28.660
very simple rules. So they studied this. At a

70
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.600
workshop in uh Los Alamos in the United States,

71
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.660
um, and pretty much in parallel to that, there

72
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.109
was a workshop also. In in uh in New

73
00:04:42.109 --> 00:04:49.160
Mexico, where they wanted to find out the synthesis

74
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.880
between the sciences. So these similarities that we're observing

75
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.059
in terms of emergent structure. Uh, THEY were, you

76
00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:02.359
know, pioneers really in the field that, that, um,

77
00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:06.010
got together asking, well, what are the, what is,

78
00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:08.970
is there a new kind of science here? Um,

79
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.790
AND in particular, So this, I'm, I'm just, I'll,

80
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.290
I'll say a few names, um. The workshop was

81
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.570
organized by uh John Cohen, and uh White House

82
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.489
science advisor, and um what, I think I said

83
00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:29.809
John Cohen, George Cohen is the right name. And

84
00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:33.869
out of this, they thought, well, actually, is there,

85
00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:36.279
you know, is there something else that can emerge

86
00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.760
in terms of bringing sciences together? So here we

87
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.920
have the science of dynamical systems, computer science, and

88
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.140
of course biology. And they wanted to think further

89
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.019
ahead even is there emerging sympathies in the social

90
00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:53.019
sciences, in anthropology, psychology, I mean this was really

91
00:05:53.019 --> 00:06:00.570
pioneering, um, a pioneering effort, and that happened in

92
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:07.179
1983 and 1984. So here one can argue that

93
00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:13.350
the the complexity signs as a research field began

94
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.670
in earnest. Standing on the shoulders of dynamical systems,

95
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:25.339
um, computer science, system science, cybernetics, of course. And

96
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.869
one thing I find interesting about this initial effort

97
00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:31.309
was they were really not just thinking about what

98
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:34.440
is the science here that that is, you know,

99
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.209
is, is, is asking us to be done. But

100
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.790
can we make a teaching institution out of it?

101
00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:45.989
And so PhD granting institution, that was the original

102
00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:51.690
idea and the ambition of these these people. Um,

103
00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:53.339
SO these people, I, I mentioned one of them,

104
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.540
George Cohen, Phil Anderson, uh, Charles Bennett, uh, Murray

105
00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:04.059
Gell Mann, um, um, Stan Farmer, uh, Stephen Wolfram.

106
00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:06.940
So it was, it was really a collection of,

107
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:13.489
it was physicists, computer scientists, economists. Who had this

108
00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:18.339
idea And this is part of what complexity science

109
00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:21.029
is. It is a way of thinking, which is

110
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:22.799
why it's so important to have it as a,

111
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.350
you know, as a teaching subject because you learn

112
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.070
to think in certain ways. How, how does structure

113
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.399
emerge in systems. That are seemingly very different, but

114
00:07:33.809 --> 00:07:38.529
appear to have a similar process of um structure

115
00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:39.339
emergence.

116
00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:44.630
So, but you mentioned different sciences or scientific disciplines

117
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:49.970
like systems theory, cybernetics, dynamical systems theory. How do

118
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.859
they relate to one another and to complexity science

119
00:07:54.859 --> 00:07:55.769
more generally?

120
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:04.549
Yeah. The um So cybernetics is um you know,

121
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.910
it's founded by Va and Osenblut in, in the

122
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:12.459
40s. And they called it a a theory of

123
00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:17.260
control and communication in living and non-living systems. So

124
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.739
Vena is was an engineer, was was a biologist,

125
00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:23.890
and they got together realizing that it looks like

126
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.380
there is a commonality between these non-living engineered and

127
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.980
the living biological systems, and they made this actually

128
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:37.900
quite um precise also using mathematics, calling it cybernetics.

129
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:43.330
Because the principles of, of control in these systems,

130
00:08:43.369 --> 00:08:45.150
you know, how do I control the hand movement

131
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:50.289
versus how do I control the flight of a

132
00:08:50.289 --> 00:08:53.400
rocket, which of course in the 40s was quite,

133
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.859
quite um At the forefront of people's thinking. Appears

134
00:08:57.859 --> 00:09:02.530
to be very similar and What does that have

135
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:06.369
to do with complexity science? It is this synthesis

136
00:09:06.369 --> 00:09:11.929
between two fields, in this case, engineering and biology,

137
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.030
where by digging down one finds common principles that

138
00:09:17.609 --> 00:09:21.200
hold in in both and that can be described

139
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.729
with similar, if not even the same mathematics. And

140
00:09:26.729 --> 00:09:30.330
that is true for this is something that complexity

141
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.179
science strives for to find these synthesis, so, uh,

142
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.030
using the same mathematics, using the same type of

143
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.229
model for systems that are physically speaking very, very

144
00:09:41.229 --> 00:09:46.729
different. So, that is cybernetics in the 40s. Um.

145
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:53.030
And then there is uh the systems theorist Ludwig

146
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.520
von Better Landy, who, I mean, he already started

147
00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.150
before um before the 40s, and his, I suppose

148
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.549
his, his main contribution is the book General Systems

149
00:10:04.549 --> 00:10:09.159
theory. Where he does exactly that, he's looking for.

150
00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:13.210
A general approach, or yeah, a new approach to

151
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.929
science as such in not being specific in these

152
00:10:17.929 --> 00:10:21.570
disciplinary silos, but looking for general principles that that

153
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:26.570
hold across uh different systems, universal principles and laws.

154
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:32.000
And that also is something that complexity science strives

155
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.559
for, um, so the modeling, the mathematical description, but

156
00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:40.359
also identifying general principles that hold across different systems,

157
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:47.250
universal principles, um, and laws. And then last but

158
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:53.309
not least is dynamical systems. That um took off,

159
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.599
well, you know, one could say in the 70s

160
00:10:57.039 --> 00:11:01.440
um with Lorenz's work on the uh on, on

161
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.770
chaos. It is, so there are two connections, I

162
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.729
would say between complex systems or complexity science and

163
00:11:08.729 --> 00:11:13.950
dynamical systems theory. One is that complex systems generally

164
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.909
are dynamical systems. Just broadly speaking, they move, they

165
00:11:18.909 --> 00:11:23.020
change over time. And because of that, many of

166
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.840
them are modeled using the tools from dynamic assistance

167
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.640
theory. The other connection between the two is that

168
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.200
both of them rely heavily on the availability of

169
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.909
computational power. The the types of, you know, strange

170
00:11:36.909 --> 00:11:41.479
tractors that people discovered at the time. They could

171
00:11:41.479 --> 00:11:46.109
not be studied in earnest without computational simulation, and

172
00:11:46.109 --> 00:11:49.479
the same is true for complexity signs. It could

173
00:11:49.479 --> 00:11:54.599
not exist without computational simulation, and of course, in

174
00:11:54.599 --> 00:11:58.210
addition to that, more and more important data analysis,

175
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.710
computational data analysis. So I would say those are

176
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:06.070
the main strands between those sciences and uh complexity

177
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:06.390
science.

178
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.729
But now to address the question posed in the

179
00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:14.520
title of your book, what is then a complex

180
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.030
system and what characterizes a complex system?

181
00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:25.400
Hm. Yes, that is the question. And there is

182
00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:32.599
Well, we, we didn't want to give a single

183
00:12:32.599 --> 00:12:37.609
sentence answer because systems, complex systems. They, you know,

184
00:12:37.729 --> 00:12:40.460
by nature cannot possibly be captured in a single

185
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.840
sentence. And yet in the end we we condense

186
00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.799
everything down to a single sentence just to help

187
00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:50.280
the discussion along, and I will start with that

188
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.679
simple sentence and then I'll unpack it a little

189
00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:56.320
bit to hopefully communicate that there is a lot

190
00:12:57.789 --> 00:13:03.710
inside of that sentence, so. Complex systems are systems

191
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:09.710
that exhibit some, but not necessarily all of the

192
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:18.210
features, um, spontaneous order and self-organization, nonlinearity. Robustness, nested

193
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:22.960
structure and modularity, history and memory, and adaptive behavior.

194
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.239
So I admit that was a very nonsense. Um,

195
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:30.119
AND what we're doing in the book is we're,

196
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:35.080
first of all, you know, distilling these features and

197
00:13:35.369 --> 00:13:37.489
to this day, nobody has come along and said,

198
00:13:37.849 --> 00:13:41.650
look, you've forgotten a feature. Um, SO, so far

199
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:46.969
so good. And the main idea in distilling these

200
00:13:46.969 --> 00:13:50.849
features is also asking what are the principal ingredients,

201
00:13:50.989 --> 00:13:54.929
so something that actually all complex systems, but not

202
00:13:54.929 --> 00:14:02.679
only them exhibit is numerosity, disorder, and diversity. Feedback

203
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:08.590
And non-equilibrium. Now, out of these emerges, and here

204
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.909
comes the term emergence in uh these other features

205
00:14:11.909 --> 00:14:18.059
that I've just mentioned, um. And I Suppose it's

206
00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:23.070
an open question. Um, TO ask whether these features

207
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:30.130
I just mentioned numerosity disorder feedback. ARE Only necessary

208
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.299
or are they also sufficient conditions. So if you

209
00:14:33.299 --> 00:14:36.260
find them in any system, then necessarily other things

210
00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.739
will follow such as self-organization or um or memory.

211
00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.020
So that's an open question. um, BUT this in

212
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.989
a nutshell is what complex systems are. The key

213
00:14:48.099 --> 00:14:51.260
is really the key starting point is in the

214
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:56.469
numerosity. So complex systems involve many interactions among many

215
00:14:56.469 --> 00:15:03.510
components. That is also something which um We try

216
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:07.799
to distill in Well, no, the, the last thing

217
00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:10.010
that the last sentence doesn't quite make sense. I,

218
00:15:10.169 --> 00:15:14.130
I'll, I'll take that out. Um, SO far, so

219
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.659
good. Short answer to what is a complex system.

220
00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.869
And are there different kinds of complex systems?

221
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:28.190
Yes, short answers, yes. Long answers just by thinking

222
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:34.239
about um these features, so. If I start At

223
00:15:34.239 --> 00:15:36.280
the end of the list I mentioned, at the

224
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.679
end of the list there was the term adaptive

225
00:15:38.679 --> 00:15:45.700
behavior. And in fact, Um, some would always use

226
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.900
the term adaptive together with complex systems, adaptive, complex

227
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:57.169
adaptive systems. And adaptivity, however, presupposes something which is

228
00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.780
um alive in, you know, in the broadest sense.

229
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.000
And to us, complex systems don't have to be

230
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.049
alive, so there are systems that we classify, we

231
00:16:09.049 --> 00:16:13.309
meaning my uh co-author James Layman, the philosopher, and

232
00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:19.200
I. Um, CALCIFIED complex. Um, BUT they're not living,

233
00:16:19.369 --> 00:16:22.090
so just there you have different types of complex

234
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.130
systems. You have those that have exhibit adaptive behavior

235
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.450
and those that do not simply because they don't

236
00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.299
exhibit any behavior. Um, SO that's, that's one way

237
00:16:31.299 --> 00:16:35.219
of, of thinking about different kinds of complex systems.

238
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.219
Generally, you could say, well, those that exhibit, for

239
00:16:38.219 --> 00:16:42.619
example, nested structure versus those that do not. Um,

240
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.380
YOU could say there are different kinds of complex

241
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.059
systems.

242
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.700
And I mean earlier you mentioned emergence. How does

243
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.340
emergence relate to complexity and in what ways are

244
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.909
complex systems non-reducible?

245
00:16:59.109 --> 00:17:06.160
Yeah. Emergence is often mentioned as a kind of

246
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.560
a definition, right? So, um, a system is complex

247
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.319
if it exhibits emergence, and then you ask what

248
00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:16.560
emergencies, and they say, oh, emergencies if something complex

249
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:22.390
suddenly arises. So that's not terribly helpful. Um, We,

250
00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:25.949
if we take emergence to be just, you know,

251
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.500
the very simple, um, Uh, Phil Anderson put it

252
00:17:31.739 --> 00:17:34.500
as more is different, which is a beautifully condensed

253
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.510
way of thinking about it. Um, Which means that

254
00:17:39.619 --> 00:17:43.270
Uh, The whole, so a collection of particles, a

255
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.829
collection of people, a collection of something, many elements

256
00:17:46.829 --> 00:17:49.790
behaves in a way that the individual parts, so

257
00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:54.050
the parts in isolation. Cannot, do not, and, and

258
00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:59.930
possibly cannot. Then you have something that emerges. No.

259
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.030
What does that have to do with what I

260
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.979
just said about features? The, um, if you take

261
00:18:06.979 --> 00:18:09.520
as the basics that you have a system that

262
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.119
has many elements, uh, with many interactions, there is

263
00:18:13.119 --> 00:18:16.189
stochasticity in there, which in nature there always is.

264
00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.300
And because there's so many interactions, there is then

265
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:26.900
also feedback between them, um. And out of that

266
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:31.640
emerges something which is not. Um, SORT of captured

267
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.390
by Talking about many elements interacting, and that is,

268
00:18:35.439 --> 00:18:40.410
for example, the emergence of structure. Um, And that

269
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.369
is such a key, the emergence of structure spontaneous

270
00:18:43.369 --> 00:18:48.209
self-organization is a key feature of complex system, and

271
00:18:48.209 --> 00:18:56.109
that emerges out of the individuals, individual elements. And

272
00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:01.189
emergence of structure. And even structure at different scales,

273
00:19:01.229 --> 00:19:04.050
which makes it even more interesting. There is one

274
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.209
type of emergence that we observe in complex systems

275
00:19:07.209 --> 00:19:11.630
that now we study. There is also emergence of

276
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.890
dynamics, uh, structure is something static, but it could

277
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.050
also be structure in time, right? And then you

278
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:22.800
have emergence of dynamics, you have emergence of laws,

279
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:29.079
universalities, um. I mean, physicists love phase transitions, so

280
00:19:29.079 --> 00:19:31.410
you could say that's a kind of an emergence

281
00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:35.739
of a universality, universal behavior. Out of the many,

282
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:43.000
you know, local interactions um between atoms, molecules. So

283
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.800
that is the main connection between emergence and a

284
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.750
complex system. And your question about the non-reducible. Is

285
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:59.430
Is a good question and it's directly answered by

286
00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.410
that the systems as a whole behave in a

287
00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:09.780
way that the elements in isolation cannot. So. The

288
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:15.020
thing is you find these non-reducible properties in Not

289
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.579
just in living systems. So in living systems, I

290
00:20:17.579 --> 00:20:20.140
mean, one of my favorite examples is an ant

291
00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.339
colony where you put thousands of ants of the

292
00:20:24.339 --> 00:20:30.119
same species together. And they form a social system,

293
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:34.089
right? They have distribution of labor, they, they, um,

294
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.969
um, you know, they stay alive over years and

295
00:20:37.969 --> 00:20:40.489
years, although the individual ants do not stay alive

296
00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:42.530
for that long, but the colony as a whole

297
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:47.040
has has a lifespan longer than the individuals, um,

298
00:20:47.369 --> 00:20:52.410
and all of this, you know, very fascinating um

299
00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:57.170
behavior that they exhibit. Cannot be exhibited by a

300
00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.319
single ant. And even more so if you put

301
00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:02.209
just a few ends, you know, I don't know,

302
00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:06.380
a handful or so often. They would not form

303
00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.099
that social structure and they would simply die of

304
00:21:09.099 --> 00:21:13.719
starvation, which, which is a, you know, I think

305
00:21:13.719 --> 00:21:17.219
it is in a nutshell what um why why

306
00:21:17.219 --> 00:21:22.400
these systems are not reducible. And similarly in in

307
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.359
a physical system which we can also think of

308
00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:29.469
as complex systems, um, we could say that the

309
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.280
the ideal gas laws, so that is a relation

310
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.170
between pressure and temperature and volume, which is super

311
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.410
fundamental physicists learn it in the first year, um,

312
00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:43.550
at university, if not earlier. And these properties are

313
00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.349
simply not assignable to a single atom, so something

314
00:21:46.349 --> 00:21:49.390
has emerged here, a form of, well, in this

315
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.339
case, a law which is not reducible to individuals,

316
00:21:53.589 --> 00:21:54.349
individual atoms.

317
00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.209
So, uh, I mean, we're going to walk through

318
00:21:58.209 --> 00:22:02.780
some examples of this, but what kinds of scientific

319
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.300
disciplines this complexity science applied

320
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.339
to? I would have to think hard to find

321
00:22:09.339 --> 00:22:12.380
a discipline where it cannot be applied to. I

322
00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.689
could find disciplines where it has been applied to

323
00:22:14.689 --> 00:22:18.280
successfully and for a while. Um, AND that is

324
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:26.489
certainly biology, neuroscience, um. And um more and more

325
00:22:26.489 --> 00:22:31.310
uh social systems, um, In, in the, to the

326
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:35.890
extent where we can get quantitative data. It is

327
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:41.489
beginning to be applied to um Psychology. And other

328
00:22:41.489 --> 00:22:49.630
related uh areas. So, The reason it's so broadly

329
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:54.349
applicable is that this type of emerging structure, emerging

330
00:22:54.349 --> 00:23:00.420
dynamics, emerging laws, is so universal. Um, SO one

331
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.229
could rather ask, You know, why has it come

332
00:23:03.229 --> 00:23:05.540
about so late in the in the history of,

333
00:23:05.709 --> 00:23:08.469
of science, which is, you know, it's just what,

334
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:15.880
50 years ago, um. Um, AND Yeah, I mean

335
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.280
that it's a difficult question. I don't think I

336
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.319
have the full answer to that. Um, IT'S very

337
00:23:21.319 --> 00:23:24.310
much data driven, so as we get in more

338
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.319
and more data on systems where we, we do

339
00:23:27.319 --> 00:23:30.280
observe some phenomena on the, what I like, you

340
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.599
know, what, what physicists and and others like to

341
00:23:32.599 --> 00:23:38.989
call the macroscopic um level. We simply because we

342
00:23:38.989 --> 00:23:41.189
don't have the means to, to measure on the

343
00:23:41.189 --> 00:23:45.709
microscopic level. So let's let's take this, um, let's

344
00:23:45.709 --> 00:23:49.540
take the example of The ideal gas law where

345
00:23:49.869 --> 00:23:53.589
on the macroscopic level, you know, people have been

346
00:23:53.589 --> 00:23:59.969
measuring for centuries, pressure and volume um and temperature

347
00:23:59.969 --> 00:24:02.500
and then realized, oh, there is actually, you know,

348
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:07.349
a very clear mathematical relation between them, but it

349
00:24:07.349 --> 00:24:10.589
took a while until it was first hypothesized and

350
00:24:10.589 --> 00:24:15.270
then actually measured in the lab the constituents of

351
00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:20.760
these gasses, the individual. Atoms and molecules. Um, AND

352
00:24:21.349 --> 00:24:23.810
And that led to, you know, first thermodynamics and

353
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:27.199
macro uh um uh statistical mechanics came along as

354
00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:32.790
the underlying microscopic theory that explained the macroscopics. And

355
00:24:32.979 --> 00:24:36.420
a similar development, I would argue we're observing in

356
00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.260
these other sciences, so we can now measure, you

357
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.380
know, movement of individual people simply because we have

358
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.420
all these, you know, every single one these days

359
00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.569
has has a mobile phone is often giving access

360
00:24:49.569 --> 00:24:52.099
to where they are, whom they call, and so

361
00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:54.410
on and so forth. So suddenly we can start

362
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:57.109
to think about the microscopic theory of these things,

363
00:24:57.689 --> 00:25:01.839
um, and we realize that. Yes, there are similar

364
00:25:01.839 --> 00:25:07.689
emerging laws. In, you know, be it, even, even

365
00:25:07.689 --> 00:25:09.439
in physics, we can still think about it that

366
00:25:09.439 --> 00:25:14.000
way, chemistry, biology for sure, uh, behavioral biology, and

367
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.760
all the way up to um all sorts of

368
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.630
human behavior.

369
00:25:19.359 --> 00:25:23.660
So let's go through some examples of scientific disciplines

370
00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:29.689
that complexity science applies to. Uh, HOW about ma

371
00:25:29.689 --> 00:25:32.689
and physics more generally? I mean, could you tell

372
00:25:32.689 --> 00:25:36.339
us a little bit about how complexity science applies

373
00:25:36.339 --> 00:25:37.550
to physics?

374
00:25:38.219 --> 00:25:44.150
Yes. That's a that's almost the hardest question. You're

375
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:50.770
starting with the hardest question because um Um, it's

376
00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.290
easy to answer in what way does physics, you

377
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:56.969
know. In what way does physics aid the field

378
00:25:56.969 --> 00:26:03.319
of complexity science, um. And that is easier because

379
00:26:03.319 --> 00:26:07.099
so many tools from sorry from physics are being

380
00:26:07.099 --> 00:26:10.510
used to study complex systems that are not considered

381
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:16.380
to be just physics systems, um, and statistic mechanics

382
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.569
which I've just described or which I've just mentioned,

383
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:24.839
a theory of, of phase transitions, critical phenomena. They

384
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.810
have all been studied for decades in physics, and

385
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:33.239
now the same concepts and Uh, even more important

386
00:26:33.239 --> 00:26:36.400
to say mathematics can be used for non-physics systems.

387
00:26:37.319 --> 00:26:44.180
Um, And In what way does complex systems apply

388
00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.670
to physics? I almost went down with it. Even

389
00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:55.760
try to answer this. Um, Rather, I put the

390
00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.079
question slightly differently, which is in what way do

391
00:26:59.079 --> 00:27:03.280
the concepts of complex systems apply to physics? And

392
00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.400
here, um, I mean, here we're right in the

393
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:12.479
heart of self-organization, right? Self-organization of non-living things because

394
00:27:12.479 --> 00:27:17.290
physics generally is about non-living things matter. Um, SO

395
00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.530
if, if we go to the universe, which is

396
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:22.489
full of structure, I mean anything from, you know,

397
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:29.290
galaxies to star systems to uh clouds of dust

398
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:32.869
and me and whatnot, I'm not an astrophysicist, but

399
00:27:32.869 --> 00:27:36.489
there's plenty of that, I know that. Um, WELL,

400
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:42.260
how did it form? It formed through self-organization and

401
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.790
the different forces that are involved, you know, we,

402
00:27:44.869 --> 00:27:47.630
we know a lot about them now, um, of

403
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:52.290
course, gravity. Uh, IS, is an important one in

404
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:57.560
this context. They form the interaction between these particles.

405
00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.550
And you just put in, that's the beauty of

406
00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.630
physics, you just put in a few very simple

407
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:07.630
laws, not trivial, but uh. Um, VERY compact laws

408
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:11.949
and out comes a myriad of different structures. So

409
00:28:11.949 --> 00:28:17.729
that is self-organization, and that is why also physics

410
00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:23.040
and the theory of non-living matter is effectively um.

411
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:27.479
Can be thought in through the concepts of of

412
00:28:27.479 --> 00:28:31.489
complexity science. Have I answered your question.

413
00:28:32.199 --> 00:28:34.459
Yes, I, I think so. I understand that it's

414
00:28:34.459 --> 00:28:37.780
a bit complicated. So, uh, let's move on to

415
00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:42.170
another area. How about the climate science? I mean,

416
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.369
what is it about the climate that we can

417
00:28:45.369 --> 00:28:49.180
have a better understanding of through complexity science?

418
00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:56.770
Yeah. There is climate science is, is really one

419
00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.920
of the areas where complexity science plays a role.

420
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.859
And there are several reasons for that. Um, ONE

421
00:29:03.859 --> 00:29:06.890
is that what complexity science is very good at

422
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:10.569
is The one thing I talked about already is

423
00:29:10.569 --> 00:29:14.420
this this form of self-organization. There's something else which

424
00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.699
is that a complex system is, is, is never

425
00:29:18.699 --> 00:29:23.459
isolated from its environment. Um, WHICH physicists like to

426
00:29:23.459 --> 00:29:27.079
do, so they're very good at. Isolating a system,

427
00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:30.000
putting it in vacuum or whatever, and then um

428
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.119
studying it, and that is simply not possible with

429
00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:35.359
the the climate as a whole, we can't put

430
00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:38.719
it in the lab and isolation, obviously. But even

431
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.760
parts of it, um you can um To some

432
00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:49.060
extent you can isolate certain processes, so um. Let's

433
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:52.459
say, I mean, you can isolate the uh dynamics

434
00:29:52.459 --> 00:29:55.380
of the weather from the dynamics of the climate

435
00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:59.959
because there are different time scales. But even that

436
00:30:00.469 --> 00:30:05.619
is, um, the time scales are overlapping. So 11

437
00:30:06.189 --> 00:30:11.270
challenge with climate is that it acts on Time

438
00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:16.390
scales and length scales that are overlapping. So you

439
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:19.349
can't say, oh this happens on the nanoscale, this

440
00:30:19.349 --> 00:30:23.109
happens on the, you know, dissolvable meters, and the

441
00:30:23.109 --> 00:30:25.949
rest is happening on thousands of kilometers, and in

442
00:30:25.949 --> 00:30:28.189
between is nothing. That is simply not the case.

443
00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:33.819
Which means that All of these time scales and

444
00:30:33.819 --> 00:30:36.510
length scales do interact with each other. That is

445
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.719
one of the challenges, if not the challenge in

446
00:30:38.829 --> 00:30:44.530
in Describing modeling predicting the climate. And here complexity

447
00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:47.609
science is equipped because it is, it has the,

448
00:30:47.689 --> 00:30:51.089
the concepts and also to some extent the methods

449
00:30:51.089 --> 00:30:54.329
to think about that. Um AND the methods, you

450
00:30:54.329 --> 00:30:57.920
know, they involve dynamical systems, they involve um network

451
00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:02.060
signs which is explicitly bad interactions where you can

452
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:06.959
then talk about different. Um, um. Lengths and time

453
00:31:06.959 --> 00:31:11.119
scales and model explicitly how they interact with each

454
00:31:11.119 --> 00:31:16.910
other, so. Um, That's why complexity science plays such

455
00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:20.300
a big role in, in, in climate science. Not

456
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.930
least through network theory. Mhm.

457
00:31:23.459 --> 00:31:27.969
So earlier you gave the example of ant colonies.

458
00:31:28.099 --> 00:31:33.060
In what ways are social insects complex systems? And

459
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.500
I would imagine this would also apply to other

460
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:40.660
kinds of animals, but focusing now specifically on new

461
00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.300
social insects, uh, could you tell us about that?

462
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:52.410
Yeah. You social insects are just super. I'm not

463
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.530
an expert, but I was, I was lucky enough

464
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:59.880
to read, you know, people's, uh, books by, by

465
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.400
people who really know. Um, Deborah Gordon, for example,

466
00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:11.189
um, knows everything about ants, I think, and Um,

467
00:32:11.609 --> 00:32:14.520
what makes them a complex system is that they,

468
00:32:15.329 --> 00:32:20.050
they really, in a nutshell, Exhibit what complex systems

469
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:21.630
do is, which is you put a lot of

470
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:28.380
entities together that individually Can't do that much. Um,

471
00:32:28.729 --> 00:32:33.849
SO ants, for example, um. An individual ant, well,

472
00:32:33.869 --> 00:32:35.849
it, it can walk and it can, you know,

473
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.319
it has senses, so on, but it, it could

474
00:32:38.319 --> 00:32:43.060
not survive on its own. Um, YOU put 1000

475
00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.650
of them together and they have, for example, a

476
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:49.880
modular structure in terms of the division of labor,

477
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.780
right? DIVISION of labor by definition, a single and

478
00:32:53.609 --> 00:32:57.569
it can't divide labor. Um, SO that is something

479
00:32:57.569 --> 00:33:01.880
that emerges out of the interactions, out of stochasticity,

480
00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:10.969
um. And The That's, that's the, the social aspect,

481
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.150
right? DIVISION of labor is something that is social.

482
00:33:14.069 --> 00:33:21.670
Group Exhibits or can exhibit. Um. And they I

483
00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:24.819
mean, we can go through all of the features,

484
00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:28.430
in fact, that I mentioned earlier on and think

485
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.540
about ants, and they have it all. I mean,

486
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:35.829
the numerosity is, you know, is a given, thousands

487
00:33:35.829 --> 00:33:39.699
of them together. The disorder is actually something which

488
00:33:39.699 --> 00:33:43.780
is key here. Uh, IT'S, it's there in every

489
00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:47.209
complex system, and here it's there because the, I

490
00:33:47.209 --> 00:33:49.810
mean the way an ant walks is not deterministic.

491
00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:55.979
Um, THERE are, you know, always disturbances, perturbations, um,

492
00:33:56.099 --> 00:33:59.180
it either meets another ant or it doesn't, um.

493
00:33:59.869 --> 00:34:02.619
And all of that leads to feedback between how

494
00:34:02.619 --> 00:34:06.030
ants move and what they perceive in their local

495
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:10.060
behavior. So there might be, for example, looking for

496
00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.899
food and then they meet another ant which signals

497
00:34:12.899 --> 00:34:15.739
that it has just found food, which then leads

498
00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:18.520
to coordinated behavior between these two ants. So there

499
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:22.649
is It starts with the disorder, feedback comes in,

500
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:28.149
and then out comes uh spontaneous self-organization and um

501
00:34:30.438 --> 00:34:33.560
That's, I mean, that leads to nonlinearity, which is

502
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.719
an abstract term, but it, one way to think

503
00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:39.719
about it is that um You know, more leads

504
00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:43.678
to more so. A few ants discover a good

505
00:34:43.678 --> 00:34:45.518
food source. Well, they recruit more and more ants

506
00:34:45.518 --> 00:34:47.799
to the same food source and so what started

507
00:34:47.799 --> 00:34:50.118
out with one ant becomes a lot of them

508
00:34:50.478 --> 00:34:55.188
uh going to the same food source. Um, And

509
00:34:55.188 --> 00:34:58.029
that is a is is is a form of

510
00:34:58.029 --> 00:35:04.629
feedback which leads to nonlinearity. And It suggests that

511
00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:08.159
it might make these systems very unstable, right, because

512
00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:10.199
all the ants suddenly run out to the food

513
00:35:10.199 --> 00:35:11.919
source, none of the ants will be left in

514
00:35:11.919 --> 00:35:14.600
the nest and, you know, an intruder comes and

515
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.820
destroys it, whatever. Um, BUT that is not what's

516
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:21.879
happening. um. Because there is also another type of

517
00:35:21.879 --> 00:35:23.800
feedback. I mean, there's so many types of feedback

518
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.439
here, but certainly to, uh, there's a positive feedback

519
00:35:27.439 --> 00:35:30.409
and the negative feedback. So the negative feedback means

520
00:35:30.409 --> 00:35:35.629
that the whole thing stays stable. Um, ON, on

521
00:35:35.629 --> 00:35:38.909
the level of the system. Because there are other

522
00:35:38.909 --> 00:35:42.979
needs inside the nest that are communicated through these

523
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:49.239
often stochastic interactions, always stochastic communication. Um, AND that

524
00:35:49.239 --> 00:35:51.929
leads to a robustness of the system as a

525
00:35:51.929 --> 00:35:56.560
whole. I mean, there could be, um, You know,

526
00:35:56.610 --> 00:36:02.479
you could, for example, uh. Scoop up Ants from

527
00:36:02.479 --> 00:36:05.000
outside of the nest. So suddenly no further food

528
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.439
is coming in and the ants that were originally

529
00:36:07.439 --> 00:36:09.719
there to, uh, you know, to tend to the

530
00:36:09.719 --> 00:36:12.729
nest and to the eggs and so on. They

531
00:36:12.729 --> 00:36:14.439
realize no food is coming in, no water is

532
00:36:14.439 --> 00:36:18.840
coming in, and then eventually, you know, stochastically one

533
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.229
after the other will. VENTURE out to get water.

534
00:36:22.379 --> 00:36:27.840
Um, SO they will actually change. The uh task

535
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.030
they had because of the interaction with the environment.

536
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.639
And that is a form of feedback, um, and

537
00:36:35.639 --> 00:36:39.639
that leads to a robustness. So, and, and on

538
00:36:39.639 --> 00:36:41.790
and on and on, of course, adaptive behavior, that's,

539
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.239
it's one form of adaptive behavior. They have it

540
00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:49.310
all, um, eusocial insect colonies have all the features

541
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:50.479
of complex systems.

542
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:54.350
So there, there are also, I suppose, many kinds

543
00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:58.560
of different social phenomena that occur in human societies

544
00:36:58.989 --> 00:37:01.989
that we could talk about here as examples, but

545
00:37:01.989 --> 00:37:05.790
let me ask you specifically about the economy. Is

546
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:09.939
the economy also a complex system, and if so,

547
00:37:10.149 --> 00:37:13.500
in what ways is it a complex system?

548
00:37:14.209 --> 00:37:17.500
Short answer to is the economy a complex system

549
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.350
is yes. And why is it a complex system?

550
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:29.169
It's Yeah, I'll give a short summary to begin

551
00:37:29.169 --> 00:37:31.600
with and then we, we could go a bit

552
00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.810
more into detail of the features, um, because the

553
00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:38.409
list of features is helpful. So the short answer

554
00:37:38.409 --> 00:37:44.899
is that the economy exhibits. Um, EMERGENT behavior, emergent

555
00:37:44.899 --> 00:37:49.270
dynamics that the individuals cannot. So for example, a

556
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.659
boom or a bust of a stock market, a

557
00:37:52.659 --> 00:37:57.780
sudden crash of, you know, certain stocks, is something

558
00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:03.350
that emerges out of a myriad of individual decisions

559
00:38:03.699 --> 00:38:08.610
that are usually the result of interactions between different

560
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:13.939
traders. So none of these traders individually decides, OK,

561
00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:17.389
uh. Uh, WELL, they, even if they decided to,

562
00:38:17.399 --> 00:38:19.469
they couldn't make it happen on their own, right?

563
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.149
So the, the trader in isolation cannot exhibit a

564
00:38:23.149 --> 00:38:24.909
boom or a bust, can only be in the

565
00:38:24.909 --> 00:38:28.669
collection of many traders together. And the simple rules

566
00:38:28.669 --> 00:38:31.939
that exist between them, which is If there's something

567
00:38:31.939 --> 00:38:37.610
to sell, then somebody else can buy it. So

568
00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:40.260
that in a nutshell is, is the reason why

569
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.179
I talked about the financial economy, but the economy

570
00:38:43.179 --> 00:38:48.360
in general is a complex system. And um the

571
00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.479
longer answer would be then to go through these

572
00:38:51.479 --> 00:38:56.330
different features. So, for example, Um, one feature I

573
00:38:56.330 --> 00:39:01.899
mentioned is nested structure. Um, SO at different scales,

574
00:39:02.149 --> 00:39:04.270
do we have structure that is then part of,

575
00:39:04.429 --> 00:39:07.909
you know, structure at a bigger scale. And certainly

576
00:39:07.909 --> 00:39:11.080
with the economy we start with individuals that, you

577
00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.199
know, every household is an economic entity if you

578
00:39:14.199 --> 00:39:17.370
like. Um, THAT is part of a bigger economic

579
00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:19.570
entity, which would be a neighborhood where, you know,

580
00:39:19.649 --> 00:39:21.370
there's a certain number of shops and people go

581
00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:25.250
and buy stuff, um. And that is part of

582
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:29.530
a bigger entity, which is, say, the national economy,

583
00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:32.090
which is part of a yet bigger economy, which

584
00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:39.020
is the international economy. And the um. The interactions

585
00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:43.320
are of different types. Uh, SO one interaction is

586
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:46.479
just, you know, buying and selling actual goods. Another

587
00:39:46.479 --> 00:39:52.399
interaction could be um financial dependencies, um, or other

588
00:39:52.399 --> 00:39:56.260
dependencies dependencies uh in terms of, of raw materials

589
00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.739
and what not. So there are all these different

590
00:40:00.189 --> 00:40:06.439
interactions within a level and between levels. Which means

591
00:40:06.729 --> 00:40:09.949
that it becomes actually quite, on the one hand,

592
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:14.129
quite difficult to predict. Um, SO if everybody suddenly

593
00:40:14.129 --> 00:40:17.010
starts to buy tulips, then, uh, you know what

594
00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:20.090
happens to the tulip market? Well, it's probably gonna

595
00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:26.570
crash. Um, But That the economy usually is not

596
00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:29.959
that simple, and so predicting something such as the

597
00:40:29.959 --> 00:40:34.370
economic crash or crisis in parts of the world

598
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:39.989
in 2008. WAS was actually predicted by some, but

599
00:40:39.989 --> 00:40:42.639
the system as a whole was not prepared and

600
00:40:42.639 --> 00:40:46.290
did not see it coming. Um, BECAUSE it was

601
00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:49.770
the result of many individual interactions. In this case,

602
00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:55.770
interactions as in the financial dependencies because some had

603
00:40:55.770 --> 00:41:00.629
bought debts of others packaged in complicated ways, and

604
00:41:00.729 --> 00:41:04.969
out of these myriad of interactions, suddenly a housing

605
00:41:04.969 --> 00:41:09.489
crisis emerged and a bigger financial crisis as a

606
00:41:09.489 --> 00:41:10.169
result of that.

607
00:41:11.129 --> 00:41:15.270
So you've mentioned earlier on that in more recent

608
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:18.750
times, complexity science has also been applied to the

609
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:23.510
study of human psychology. So, could you give us

610
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:27.310
perhaps some examples or tell us more broadly about

611
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:32.239
how complexity science also applies to human psychology and

612
00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:36.060
the study of the human brain in neuroscience?

613
00:41:38.459 --> 00:41:40.540
The second one is much easier than the first.

614
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:44.550
Um, OK, I cannot talk much about psychology. Well,

615
00:41:44.629 --> 00:41:46.830
I, I, I can't really talk about it at

616
00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:50.020
all. I know that psychologists are beginning to use

617
00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:56.840
complexity science, um. Because there is structure such as

618
00:41:58.239 --> 00:42:04.620
Um, you know, psychological, psychological traits are sort of

619
00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:10.949
emerging as key, key categories in how people behave,

620
00:42:11.479 --> 00:42:13.719
but really I feel I know way too little

621
00:42:13.719 --> 00:42:18.090
about that to comment properly. Um NEUROSCIENCE is much

622
00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:25.989
easier. To me Um, because the obvious complexes, and

623
00:42:25.989 --> 00:42:30.020
the brain is, is, in my view, is the

624
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:34.870
most Complex system. Although it a brain on its

625
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:36.909
own doesn't, you know, can't survive. It has to

626
00:42:36.909 --> 00:42:41.370
be part of a a body. Um, BUT the

627
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:46.689
brain consists of these, um, depending on, so humans,

628
00:42:46.729 --> 00:42:49.610
um, you know, millions of tens of millions of

629
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:55.949
neurons. Um, And they are as individual cells, you

630
00:42:55.949 --> 00:42:58.770
know, they can't do anything. Um, I mean, potentially

631
00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:01.860
they could conduct some current and that's it. Um,

632
00:43:01.889 --> 00:43:04.459
YOU put tens of millions of them together and

633
00:43:04.459 --> 00:43:07.300
you get something like consciousness, and that is, is

634
00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.989
mind boggling, right? And we haven't fully understood that,

635
00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.639
but we, we, I say we in, in the

636
00:43:13.639 --> 00:43:18.139
sense of the scientific community, uh, neuroscience community. Um,

637
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:21.870
UNDERSTAND a lot of about the, the ways in

638
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:25.909
which the brain self-organizes, uh, which is a hallmark

639
00:43:25.909 --> 00:43:30.030
of a complex system. And for example, uh, you

640
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:31.709
know, we, we know quite well that the brain

641
00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:35.149
has different areas of, um, which is, which is

642
00:43:35.149 --> 00:43:38.429
responsible, which are responsible for different parts of of

643
00:43:38.429 --> 00:43:41.270
brain activity, uh, some of them for consciousness, some

644
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:44.260
of them for instinctive behaviors, some of them for

645
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:53.360
immediate, you know, um, reactions, um, unconscious. And They

646
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.639
are made of the same stuff, and yet they

647
00:43:56.639 --> 00:44:01.129
do different things. Um, SO that's emergence right there.

648
00:44:02.209 --> 00:44:09.040
And um, One property, you know, out of exhibits

649
00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.489
all of the properties of of complex systems, all

650
00:44:11.489 --> 00:44:14.620
of the features. One of them, which to me

651
00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:19.570
is is really fascinating is robustness. Which is, I

652
00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:21.560
mean, one type of robustness that the human brain

653
00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.520
has is It keeps the same temperature within just

654
00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:29.000
a few tens of degrees, always, no matter whether

655
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.870
it's summer or winter, um, humid or dry, um,

656
00:44:34.239 --> 00:44:39.889
so it has a self-regulating. Um, PROCESS constantly going

657
00:44:39.889 --> 00:44:43.290
on, which is an emergent feature because individual neurons

658
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:47.620
couldn't do it. Um, So that's one basic type

659
00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.979
of robustness, which is really important for survival, the

660
00:44:49.979 --> 00:44:53.139
way we we've evolved. And the other type of

661
00:44:53.139 --> 00:44:58.500
robustness, which I find fascinating is a uh a

662
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:02.649
kind of a Well, it's a kind of an

663
00:45:02.649 --> 00:45:05.969
error correction. If parts of the brain are damaged,

664
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.639
other parts are able to take over the tasks,

665
00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:11.929
not always and not generally, but that is possible.

666
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:16.250
So, um, that is a form of of adaptive

667
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:20.639
behavior combined with the robustness that the brain exhibits,

668
00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:25.979
um. And Yeah, I'm not a neuroscientist, so I

669
00:45:25.979 --> 00:45:29.489
couldn't tell you exactly how these things are are

670
00:45:29.939 --> 00:45:33.179
explained and modeled, but the idea is, which is

671
00:45:33.179 --> 00:45:34.679
why it's so much fun to be a complexity

672
00:45:34.679 --> 00:45:38.260
scientist, because you can, um, you can actually, you're

673
00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.139
being paid to know a little bit about a

674
00:45:41.139 --> 00:45:44.909
lot of things. And that is what I know

675
00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:48.229
about neuroscience is, you know, these, these different aspects

676
00:45:48.229 --> 00:45:53.729
which are Truly concepts from complex systems are being

677
00:45:53.729 --> 00:45:57.439
studied and applied in, in, for example, human brain.

678
00:45:58.469 --> 00:45:59.110
Mhm.

679
00:45:59.439 --> 00:46:02.169
Now, I also have other episodes where I've talked

680
00:46:02.169 --> 00:46:05.750
about complexity science applied to different kinds of scientific

681
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:08.989
disciplines. So if people want, they can go and

682
00:46:08.989 --> 00:46:13.070
watch them. So let, we've already gone through examples

683
00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:18.030
of scientific fields and certain specific phenomena that complexity

684
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:20.909
science applies to. Let me uh now ask you

685
00:46:20.909 --> 00:46:24.350
a different kind of question. Can the behavior of

686
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:26.989
a complex system be predicted?

687
00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:29.870
It sounds like the answer should be no, because

688
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:33.870
we had all this stochasticity and emerging things that

689
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:39.260
individuals, you know, elements, uh, do not exhibit. And

690
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:43.550
this is. Where these, there are two phrases that

691
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:47.780
are being used and That are, I think confusing

692
00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:51.580
people. One is complexity comes out of simplicity and

693
00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:54.780
simplicity comes out of complexity. It seems like, you

694
00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.620
know, either one or the other has to be

695
00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:00.389
false. But both of them are true in certain

696
00:47:00.389 --> 00:47:03.699
senses. So what I think what we've talked about

697
00:47:03.699 --> 00:47:06.090
so far is how complexity can come out of

698
00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:09.020
simplicity. So you put a bunch of things together

699
00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.780
that individually can't do much. So a bunch of

700
00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.020
ants individually, you know, they run around in circles

701
00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:18.060
and die. Together they form these fantastically complex societies.

702
00:47:18.979 --> 00:47:22.399
Um, THAT looks like complexity comes out of simplicity.

703
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.979
At the same time, we see examples where simplicity

704
00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:32.070
comes out of complexity in the following sense, where,

705
00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:37.629
you know, you put 1023 atoms in a container.

706
00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:41.100
And close it off, and you will observe that

707
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:43.510
the pressure, the temperature and volume relate to each

708
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:49.020
other in a very precise mathematical way. That seems.

709
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.229
I mean, that is something terribly simple that comes

710
00:47:52.229 --> 00:47:56.600
out of. 10 to 23 elements that interact with

711
00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:01.290
each other in, you know, uh uncountable ways. And

712
00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:04.439
so the beauty of complexity science is that it

713
00:48:04.439 --> 00:48:06.870
can deal with both. So what it does is,

714
00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.739
you know, out of these myriad of interactions between

715
00:48:10.739 --> 00:48:14.719
ants, let's say, a simplicity emerges at the same

716
00:48:14.719 --> 00:48:20.050
time as a complexity, and the challenge of the

717
00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:24.120
science is to extract these simplicities and to make

718
00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:29.060
them into models, and these models are then The

719
00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:32.100
good models are able to extract just as much

720
00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:35.830
as they need out of the emerging structure, for

721
00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:38.739
example, and simplify it as such so that it

722
00:48:38.739 --> 00:48:43.330
does become predictable. And, and economics that is being

723
00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:47.060
done more and more, um, I mean, Don Farmer

724
00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:51.169
is a beautiful example of of extracting the, the

725
00:48:51.169 --> 00:48:56.050
regularities out of this seemingly terribly complicated system that

726
00:48:56.050 --> 00:49:00.860
makes it. Not deterministically predictable, but it, it makes

727
00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:05.760
us able to predict um. Probabilities. Mhm.

728
00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.879
So, I have one last question. Then earlier on,

729
00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:14.899
we talked about uh the relationship between different, these

730
00:49:14.899 --> 00:49:19.899
different kinds of scientific fields like uh cybernetic systems

731
00:49:19.899 --> 00:49:24.899
theory, dynamical systems theory, and complexity science itself. But

732
00:49:24.899 --> 00:49:30.379
is complexity science one single scientific theory, or is

733
00:49:30.379 --> 00:49:34.300
it more of a collection of branches from different

734
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.139
sciences?

735
00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:44.219
We argue that complexity science is. Well, it's it's

736
00:49:44.219 --> 00:49:48.489
a scientific theory that relies on other theories. So

737
00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:53.270
what is, what does that mean? Um. I, I

738
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:59.149
would say the and it. You know, 11 answer

739
00:49:59.149 --> 00:50:02.419
to the question is complexity science is a way

740
00:50:02.419 --> 00:50:06.350
of thinking. Which is why to link it back

741
00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:09.629
to the initial very early ideas of making it

742
00:50:09.629 --> 00:50:12.669
a teaching institution, I think is still so relevant.

743
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:18.879
Because we're not thrown by um By the idea

744
00:50:18.879 --> 00:50:25.350
of stochasticity. Um, GENERATING order. And that is a

745
00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:29.919
way of thinking. And using models from other disciplines

746
00:50:30.439 --> 00:50:33.040
um for a system is a way of thinking

747
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.250
and approach to science, and that was also the

748
00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:40.810
idea of the 1980s that we want a new

749
00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:47.969
approach to science, using statistical mechanics to study voting

750
00:50:47.969 --> 00:50:52.040
behavior, for example, is, is a new approach to

751
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:59.590
the science of social systems. Um, And that, in

752
00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:02.429
that sense, one could say complexity science is not

753
00:51:02.429 --> 00:51:08.770
a single theory. Because it is. It is sort

754
00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.860
of, you can think of it as a a

755
00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:14.879
hub and spokes. So a hub would be all

756
00:51:14.879 --> 00:51:18.229
the different mathematical and computational tools that we have

757
00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:21.850
coming from physics, from mathematics and computer science, and

758
00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:24.610
the spokes are reaching out to the different disciplines.

759
00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:30.929
Um, AND out comes something like computational neuroscience, which

760
00:51:30.929 --> 00:51:35.540
connects mathematics and networks and uh concepts of computer

761
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:39.610
science with theory of the brain. Um, WHICH is

762
00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:43.010
now its own scientific theory sort of emerged out

763
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:47.070
of ideas from complexity science, I would argue. Um,

764
00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:49.909
SO that is a longer way of saying complexity

765
00:51:49.909 --> 00:51:55.510
science is not a scientific theory, um, it's a

766
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:58.709
connection of scientific theories. It's, it's one way to

767
00:51:58.709 --> 00:51:59.149
think about it.

768
00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.889
OK. Since we still have time, let me just

769
00:52:01.889 --> 00:52:04.629
ask you one more question then. I mean, since

770
00:52:04.629 --> 00:52:08.189
you mentioned earlier on that complexity science is a

771
00:52:08.189 --> 00:52:12.189
fairly young science, um, how do you look at

772
00:52:12.189 --> 00:52:15.040
its future? I mean, do you have any ideas

773
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.590
about that, about what to expect from complexity science

774
00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:21.860
in the near future?

775
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:27.290
My outlook for complexity science is very positive. We

776
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:29.330
are, I mean, we are in a in a

777
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:35.409
phase where the problems we're facing are, are all

778
00:52:35.409 --> 00:52:37.850
about complex systems. We spoke a little bit about

779
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:40.570
climate already, um, you know, we're in the midst

780
00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:45.050
of climate change, and that requires the concepts and

781
00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:50.570
tools of complexity science, um. And, and that is

782
00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:53.770
what is going on in, in research institutions uh

783
00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:57.810
that do complexity science. They, they involve complexity sciences

784
00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:01.459
more and more. But yeah. Um, THE same is

785
00:53:01.459 --> 00:53:05.379
true with social systems. Um, I mean, by now

786
00:53:05.379 --> 00:53:07.300
we are so many people on this earth that

787
00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.580
it's, there's hardly any community that's disconnected from the

788
00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:15.310
rest of, of, uh, of humanity. And that leads

789
00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:20.189
to Well, opportunities, but also to lots of problems,

790
00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.600
um, you know, how do we, how do we

791
00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:26.040
agree on using the resources that the Earth offers

792
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.560
us. I mean, there's a connection between climate science

793
00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:34.320
and social science, um, and that to attack these

794
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:38.719
problems, complexity science in my view is key because

795
00:53:38.719 --> 00:53:43.090
it provides ways of thinking about how many interactions,

796
00:53:43.179 --> 00:53:47.620
so negotiations between individuals, between individuals. Uh, COMMUNITIES, individual

797
00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:53.409
countries, um. Can lead to an outcome which we

798
00:53:53.409 --> 00:53:56.679
want, right? So the idea is here or the,

799
00:53:56.709 --> 00:53:59.969
the challenge here is to to not just describe

800
00:53:59.969 --> 00:54:03.889
what is going on between uh the different actors.

801
00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:09.110
But to provide models that can help not just

802
00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:13.389
predict also control. Control in the sense of achieving

803
00:54:13.389 --> 00:54:16.850
an outcome that we want. And there it's a

804
00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:20.989
huge challenge for complexity signs. And it's the challenge

805
00:54:20.989 --> 00:54:25.929
that we're absolutely Yeah, we, we have to take

806
00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:29.370
on and we are taking on uh to tackle.

807
00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:35.260
Climate change to tackle, you know, polarization in in

808
00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.979
the political systems that we're observing, uh, more and

809
00:54:37.979 --> 00:54:44.500
more, uh, writing the year 2025 and Um, Massive

810
00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:49.939
changes are are ongoing. So, the future of complex

811
00:54:49.939 --> 00:54:52.389
designs is bright in the sense that the problems

812
00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:55.060
we're facing are problems of complex systems.

813
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:59.090
Mhm. Great. So the book is again, what is

814
00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:02.080
a complex system. I am leaving a link to

815
00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.340
it in the description of the interview. And Doctor

816
00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:08.580
Wiesner, just before we go apart from the book,

817
00:55:08.669 --> 00:55:11.669
are there any places on the internet where people

818
00:55:11.669 --> 00:55:13.219
can find your work?

819
00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:18.959
Yes, there is my personal website, Kavia.org, and there

820
00:55:18.959 --> 00:55:20.919
is also the website of my research group at

821
00:55:20.919 --> 00:55:24.689

823
00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:33.639
