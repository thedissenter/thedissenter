00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.829
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.619
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.880
joined by Doctor Eleanor Sherry. She is professor at

4
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.020
the Max Planck Institute of Ge uh geo Anthropology

5
00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:14.979
where she is the head of the Independent Max

6
00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:18.524
Planck Human Pill Systems Research Group. She is an

7
00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:23.284
archaeological scientist interested in exploring the articulation between material

8
00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:29.135
culture, genetics and biogeography to further theoretical methodological and

9
00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:33.169
scientific advances in the field of human evolution. And

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.770
today we're talking about how we study human evolution,

11
00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:40.810
the origins of Homo sapiens, whether it was in

12
00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:45.659
one single location or multiregional in Africa, our dispersal

13
00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:49.729
within Africa out of Africa migrations and other related

14
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.209
topics. So, Doctor Sherry, welcome to the show. It's

15
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.290
a pleasure to everyone.

16
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.630
Thank you very much for having me.

17
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.599
So just to introduce the topic here, tell us

18
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.639
a little bit about the kind of work you

19
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.720
do. I mean, when it comes to studying human

20
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.389
evolution, I guess that there would be many different

21
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.830
approaches here, but tell us perhaps generally how you

22
00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:18.599
go about combining things like genetics, biogeography and material

23
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.069
culture to study human evolution.

24
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.819
Sure, I think we still have quite a romantic

25
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.250
idea about, you know, the, the lonely professor, a

26
00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:33.300
renaissance professor who's good at everything, just working alone

27
00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:35.959
and, and figuring everything out. But of course, the

28
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.580
reality nowadays is very different. I like to think

29
00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:40.459
of it more like we're sort of like a

30
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.500
hockey team where everybody has, you know, a different

31
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.260
um role to play in that team. And we

32
00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:48.379
can only find the answers if we are able

33
00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:51.760
to work together. And that can be challenging because

34
00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:54.559
the field of human origins is is incredibly diverse.

35
00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.680
So there is a single theme we want to

36
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.849
know where we come from, but there are many

37
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.480
different ways to approach um the answer to that

38
00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:04.760
question which involve many different uh fields of research

39
00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:09.369
from like you mentioned genetics to archaeology, fossil studies,

40
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.449
climate studies. So it can be really diverse. But

41
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.279
I think we're all getting better at understanding each

42
00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.389
other and being able to work together. And that's

43
00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:21.479
what we try to do in my group uh

44
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.630
which includes people with a background in in genetics,

45
00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:30.949
in geochemistry, in geo chronology, in archaeology, um fossil

46
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.229
studies and so on. And together we all contribute

47
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.229
independent lines of evidence that come towards us, being

48
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.839
able to make sense of a coherent whole and

49
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.339
try to understand this basic question. Who are we

50
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.490
and where do we come from?

51
00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.949
And so, I mean, one of the biggest questions

52
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.539
slash debates in paleoanthropology that has been running for

53
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.520
a while and I guess it's still an active

54
00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:02.199
debate is about whether Homo sapiens, our species of

55
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.000
course originated in one single location in Africa or

56
00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.919
if it was multi regional. So what would you

57
00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:16.139
say are the best arguments coming from people from

58
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:17.699
both sides?

59
00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.000
Yeah. So I think, I think it's important to,

60
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.490
to think about sort of the historic nature of

61
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.899
this debate. So for a long time, it was

62
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.070
unclear whether humans originated in Africa or somewhere else.

63
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.479
Uh I think Asia was a major candidate, but

64
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.309
others claimed it might have been Europe. And this

65
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.410
debate really crystallized um into two opposing views that

66
00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.149
were very, very different in their nature. So the,

67
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.149
the, the first and older model, the multiregional model

68
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.529
saw humans originating from um across the old world.

69
00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:59.669
So that's Africa, Europe and Asia. And the idea

70
00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:02.059
was that populations lived in these different regions and

71
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.949
there was some degree of gene flow between them,

72
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.699
but essentially the humans that originated in, in these

73
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.710
regions are still the people living here today. And

74
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.490
that this model essentially explains the differences we see

75
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.598
between people today. Um But um there was another

76
00:04:20.608 --> 00:04:25.308
view put forward um prominently by Professor Chris Christopher

77
00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:28.660
Stringer at the Natural History Museum and he looked

78
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.390
at the fossil record um in both Africa and

79
00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:36.410
Eurasia and he looked at more complex statistical analyses

80
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.690
for the first time. Um And although we didn't

81
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.619
have dates going back to this time period when,

82
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.910
when these researchers were first active, um he looked

83
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.559
at the different traits on fossil skulls. So for

84
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.320
example, the shape of the chin or the space

85
00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:54.119
between the orbits of the eye, the shape of

86
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.420
the back of the skull, all sort of physical

87
00:04:56.429 --> 00:05:00.440
traits like this and looked at the differences between

88
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.359
them. And he started to see a pattern in

89
00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:07.290
which um the African fossils were more consistently closer

90
00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:10.929
to um modern humans today than fossils coming from

91
00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:14.410
Europe and Asia, from the Pleistocene at some point

92
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.019
in the Pleistocene. And so he proposed that humans

93
00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:21.540
originated in Africa. And this really went contrary to

94
00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:24.420
the established model and I don't think you can

95
00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:27.359
exaggerate the effect in which this has was really

96
00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.700
profound. So we see many um headlines today in

97
00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:33.190
the newspaper saying, you know, researchers rewrite story of

98
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.929
human origins. I mean, we, we haven't, this was

99
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.920
genuinely the last time really this happened. Um Other

100
00:05:39.929 --> 00:05:41.880
than when we discovered that there was some interbreeding

101
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.100
with, for example, neanderthals. So this was a huge,

102
00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:47.779
huge um upset and it upset a lot of

103
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.489
people. Um And the debate didn't really start to

104
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.269
become resolved until uh fossils started to be better

105
00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:57.140
dated. And we started to see that the oldest

106
00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:01.809
fossils were indeed African fossils. And um and then

107
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.640
we started to have genetics starting to come in

108
00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:06.339
in the 19 eighties. The first results looking at,

109
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.649
um DNA um suggested that um the oldest um

110
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.690
lineages were African. Now, at some point, um there

111
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.679
emerged a scholarly consensus based on all this information

112
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.390
that Africa was a homeland of humanity. But at

113
00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:27.230
some point that discussion turned into a, a sort

114
00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:31.130
of a where in Africa um discussion, which wasn't

115
00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:33.929
really in the original debates, it was sort of

116
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.869
Africa versus the rest of the old world. And

117
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.660
nowhere was a suggestion that there was one place

118
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.549
or one population in Africa that played a role,

119
00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:45.059
but somehow, um this is, this is what it

120
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.149
became. Um But I think there has been a

121
00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:52.750
little bit of a vindication for the multiregional lists

122
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.910
in that. Um We now know that there was

123
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.390
some gene flow between our species and other forms

124
00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:02.549
of human that existed in the Pleistocene, namely Neanderthals

125
00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:05.329
and Denisovans. And even though that's a very, very

126
00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:07.570
small percentage of what makes us human, so it

127
00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:10.089
doesn't change the fact that humans originate in Africa.

128
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.619
It does mean that some, some small part of

129
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.170
that multiregional model did have some truth. So I

130
00:07:17.179 --> 00:07:20.920
think in some ways everybody won a little bit

131
00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:22.339
of, of those debates.

132
00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:26.820
A and so, uh but let's focus then on

133
00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:31.500
Africa, since at least that I guess is consensual

134
00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:37.140
when it comes to whether we originated from one

135
00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:43.160
single population in Africa or subdivided populations in Africa

136
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.670
at this point, at least, what do we know

137
00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:50.489
about that? What does the best evidence out there

138
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.420
point to?

139
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.970
Ok. I think, I think to answer that question,

140
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.570
we need to go back in time and try

141
00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:58.970
to understand where that question even came from because

142
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.600
it wasn't part of the Africa versus multiregional debate.

143
00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:06.540
The Af the traditional debates that raged across the

144
00:08:06.549 --> 00:08:10.839
eighties and the seventies before that was, um, did

145
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.559
it happen across Africa? Did it happen across the

146
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.549
old world? And then in the 19 eighties, the

147
00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:20.820
genetic argument ultimately won. And then we started to

148
00:08:20.829 --> 00:08:23.519
get all the results of the geo chronology showing

149
00:08:23.529 --> 00:08:27.079
that the African fossils were the oldest. But the

150
00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:31.880
way human evolution began to be represented, moved from

151
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.349
these sort of popular linear kind of progression models

152
00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:39.369
to something that looks more like a tree, these

153
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.630
phylogeny that we're all familiar from this tree of

154
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.409
life idea. And an intuitive part of that model

155
00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:46.950
is that there has to be a point of

156
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.049
beginning and a point of beginning. It's very easy

157
00:08:51.059 --> 00:08:53.190
to move from thinking about that to thinking that's

158
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.590
a physical time and place. But if you think

159
00:08:57.599 --> 00:09:00.929
about the way evolution works, then it's, it's a

160
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.989
little bit more problematic because evolution is the process.

161
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.309
It's not as if um you know, so there

162
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.489
was this process of evolution that stopped, we appeared

163
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.289
and that's the end of history, you know, we,

164
00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:15.270
we, we still evolving. We are today a snapshot

165
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.250
in time and we will, we're still around a

166
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.059
million years from now will be different again. And

167
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:26.059
so the question of where in Africa did we

168
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.640
evolve? And is it one place or many wasn't

169
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.510
really a debate in the same way that out

170
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.419
of Africa? Sorry, that, that human evolution was a

171
00:09:36.429 --> 00:09:42.200
debate with multiregional and versus African origin because the

172
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.770
idea that we evolved in one place in Africa

173
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.270
was an idea that sort of happened very slowly

174
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.760
and that there was a tacit understanding of based

175
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:55.380
on the way we represented human evolution. So at

176
00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.369
some point, the search for a single center of

177
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:04.989
endemism somehow became justified over time. And from the

178
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.859
nineties to the noughties onwards, we started to see

179
00:10:07.869 --> 00:10:10.010
an increasing number of papers sort of making these

180
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.630
arguments about, for example, Eastern Africa being the homeland

181
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.599
of humans. And we started to see these pictures

182
00:10:17.609 --> 00:10:21.909
and magazines and documentaries of humans walking along Kilimanjaro

183
00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:23.690
in the background, you know, these sort of iconic

184
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.909
Savannah pictures. And I think, you know that the

185
00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:29.010
re insidiously took root in people's mind and we

186
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.309
stopped even questioning how much sense this model had.

187
00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:37.000
But as I mentioned, evolution is, is a is

188
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.340
a long and slow process. And humanity has very

189
00:10:39.349 --> 00:10:43.799
deep roots in Africa. And the process of evolution

190
00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:45.940
didn't take place in one place, it took place

191
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.890
in many different places because people moved around. So

192
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.169
in certain places, you can imagine particular traits appearing

193
00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:55.229
and then in others different ones appearing. And so

194
00:10:55.239 --> 00:10:58.359
there is a spatial and temporal element to human

195
00:10:58.369 --> 00:11:01.849
evolution. It's not something that appears as a package

196
00:11:01.859 --> 00:11:03.979
out of the ground in one place at one

197
00:11:03.989 --> 00:11:10.109
time. And so as, as these um questions about

198
00:11:10.119 --> 00:11:13.460
the center of endemism really started to take hold

199
00:11:13.469 --> 00:11:16.190
and there was this push for East Africa, it

200
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.349
sort of gave researchers like me pause for thought.

201
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.590
First of all, because, you know, a lot of

202
00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:26.090
the research was taking place in places like Eastern

203
00:11:26.099 --> 00:11:28.440
Africa because this is where fossils were being found,

204
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:32.929
this incredibly rich, amazing fossil fossiliferous area. But the

205
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.859
question is, did humans, is this really ground zero

206
00:11:36.869 --> 00:11:38.640
for human evolution or is this just a place

207
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.469
where we happen to be finding fossils? So is

208
00:11:40.479 --> 00:11:42.900
there some element of preservation bias here? And we

209
00:11:42.909 --> 00:11:45.000
only look here because we expect to find fossils

210
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.739
and because we find fossils there, then we're saying

211
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.330
this is where humans came from. Um And, and,

212
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.270
and the other question to me was, of course,

213
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.669
um you know, we, we don't ask these questions

214
00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:57.349
of other animals. We say, what, what was the

215
00:11:57.359 --> 00:12:01.159
center of origin of? I don't know the whales,

216
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.250
you know, or, or, you know, I mean, like

217
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.469
it's, it's, it's, it's a really, you know, or

218
00:12:07.479 --> 00:12:08.960
even one species of whales because it was one

219
00:12:08.969 --> 00:12:10.719
species of humans, like where do humpback whales come

220
00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:13.099
from? You know, these sort of questions are difficult

221
00:12:13.109 --> 00:12:16.650
to ask because animals move around. And then of

222
00:12:16.659 --> 00:12:18.669
course, we started to see that a lot of

223
00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:22.010
the, the fossils, early human fossils actual or putative,

224
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.489
you know, because people really get, get into these

225
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.299
debates. But a lot of the early fossils that

226
00:12:27.309 --> 00:12:31.150
have a lot of features in common um with

227
00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:34.119
us and each other don't appear from in one

228
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.849
place, they appear across the African continent at much

229
00:12:36.859 --> 00:12:40.340
the same age. So in, in um in Eastern

230
00:12:40.349 --> 00:12:43.469
Africa as well, there's um old evidence of material

231
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.340
culture um that's associated with, with Homo sapiens, but

232
00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:50.659
we found material culture that's just as old. Um

233
00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:52.989
The same material culture is distilled in, in Southern

234
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.270
Africa and northern Africa. And so the picture we

235
00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.119
started to see is that you don't have the

236
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.150
fossils on the material culture appearing in one place

237
00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:04.489
and radiating outwards from a single point of origin

238
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.929
instead across the African continent. We're seeing much the

239
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.260
same processes happening at much the same time. So

240
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.440
this suggests that there is more of a sort

241
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.780
of distributed origin story going on and that's what

242
00:13:16.789 --> 00:13:18.090
we wanted to make sense of.

243
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.119
But actually, this is uh uh I mean, a

244
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.130
very interesting debate and even I have here from

245
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.210
2019, that is five years ago, less than five

246
00:13:30.219 --> 00:13:31.880
years ago because I think it was in the

247
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.159
summer of 2019 that the paper came out by

248
00:13:35.179 --> 00:13:39.330
E Chen, all titled Human Origins in the Southern

249
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:44.690
African Paleo wetland and first migrations that's still going

250
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.429
back to uh uh uh basically this debate. In

251
00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.140
this case, the researchers here were making a case

252
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:57.539
that um perhaps we have originated in 11 single

253
00:13:57.549 --> 00:14:00.520
population. But in this case, it would be more

254
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:04.039
to the south of Africa around bots one if

255
00:14:04.049 --> 00:14:08.030
I remember correctly. So this is still ongoing.

256
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.979
Right. Yes. So the, the idea of, of a

257
00:14:11.989 --> 00:14:15.969
single center of endemism, um which is what they're

258
00:14:15.979 --> 00:14:20.359
calling for is actually sort of this older idea

259
00:14:20.369 --> 00:14:23.000
that people have had for a while. So it,

260
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.619
it is a sort of theory that had existed

261
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.830
for maybe a couple of decades. And yes, they

262
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.599
published this in 2019, which is I think was

263
00:14:31.609 --> 00:14:34.179
a year after our first paper trying to push

264
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.820
back on this idea and saying it doesn't fit

265
00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:39.359
the evidence. Um And the idea that, you know,

266
00:14:39.369 --> 00:14:42.270
Southern Africa was uh the sort of home of

267
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.909
humanity has also been something that was pushed for

268
00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:47.559
a while in, in, in many ways, in a

269
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.799
very problematic fashion. There was, you know, even this

270
00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:54.609
idea that that certain um modern populations of humans

271
00:14:54.619 --> 00:14:59.070
living in Southern Africa were somehow some relics of

272
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.590
the past, which is, which is an idea that

273
00:15:01.599 --> 00:15:04.869
that's very problematic because everybody has changed from 300,000

274
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.549
years ago. There is, there's no such thing as

275
00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:08.840
a, you know, a relic from the past. Um

276
00:15:08.849 --> 00:15:10.750
And so, you know, some of these ideas are

277
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.289
a little bit problematic in this way as well.

278
00:15:13.299 --> 00:15:15.900
But yes, they, they did publish this paper and

279
00:15:15.909 --> 00:15:18.820
um you know, iii, I don't like to sort

280
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.140
of go out all our criticisms of, of other

281
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.919
people's work and I think they did do some

282
00:15:22.929 --> 00:15:25.090
things in this paper that were commendable, like trying

283
00:15:25.099 --> 00:15:28.640
to bring in um a, a climate story and

284
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.090
trying to link it to the genes, I think,

285
00:15:30.099 --> 00:15:31.770
you know, that's, it's a really kind of good

286
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.700
thing to do. But unfortunately, this paper does suffer

287
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:38.179
from a number of what I guess I call

288
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.169
inferential pitfalls. And the biggest problem with it is

289
00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:44.390
it makes these very bold claims, you know, the

290
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.409
homeland of, of humans. But the, the data that

291
00:15:47.419 --> 00:15:51.960
it's based on is very weakly informative. Um It

292
00:15:51.969 --> 00:15:57.739
also treats genetic lineages as real populations and problematically,

293
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.770
it also assumes regional population continuity for hundreds of

294
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.650
thousands of years. So while maybe the other aspects

295
00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:06.140
of the paper can be a little bit hard

296
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.849
to grasp because they're quite technical issues. Um I

297
00:16:09.859 --> 00:16:11.950
think it's very easy to understand that you have

298
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.849
to find a group of people living today, even

299
00:16:13.859 --> 00:16:15.539
if all their arguments are right. But you find

300
00:16:15.549 --> 00:16:18.409
a group of people living today in southern Africa

301
00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:21.520
doesn't mean their ancestors were there two or 300,000

302
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.159
years ago. Are you really trying to make a

303
00:16:23.169 --> 00:16:26.510
claim that people haven't moved in that entire time

304
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.760
frame? But you know, I can, I can break

305
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.950
this down for you a little bit. Um

306
00:16:32.489 --> 00:16:33.260
Sure, go ahead.

307
00:16:33.849 --> 00:16:37.469
So this paper uses 100 and 98 I think

308
00:16:37.479 --> 00:16:40.280
it was mitochondrial genomes from present day South African

309
00:16:40.289 --> 00:16:43.960
individuals. Um And these were new and then it

310
00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:47.869
combined them with about 1000 uh more or less

311
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.049
already published genomes. And so that sounds like a

312
00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:54.489
lot, you know, you have like around 1200 genomes

313
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.309
that they're working with. Um But the first issue

314
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.979
is that it uses mitochondrial DNA. Um MITOCHONDRIAL DNA

315
00:17:01.989 --> 00:17:04.520
comes from the mitochondria, which is this organ now

316
00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:07.010
that we have in our cell that essentially powers

317
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.979
up the cell. And they are, they are interesting

318
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.618
because they have their own genome that's easier to

319
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.300
study. And it's separate from the DNA find in,

320
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.579
in the, in the cell nucleus. And although nuclear

321
00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:22.560
DNA is, is, is clearly the the the area

322
00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.260
where you're going to find most informative for ancestry,

323
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.670
sometimes it can be useful to look at mitochondrial

324
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.359
DNA because it's simpler. And indeed, you know, the

325
00:17:30.369 --> 00:17:32.479
early papers back going back to the 19 eighties

326
00:17:32.489 --> 00:17:34.849
that pointed human origins back to Africa did this

327
00:17:34.859 --> 00:17:39.290
using mitochondrial DNA. So it does tell us something,

328
00:17:40.189 --> 00:17:44.089
but it doesn't tell us a lot. Unlike nuclear

329
00:17:44.099 --> 00:17:46.869
DNA, it doesn't recombine with each generation. So what

330
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.219
that means is that um with every generation, you

331
00:17:50.229 --> 00:17:52.829
inherit 50% of your DNA, more or less from

332
00:17:52.839 --> 00:17:55.770
one parent and 50% from the other uh as

333
00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.369
do your siblings, but the sections that you inherit

334
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.739
are not the same like your brother or sister

335
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.589
have different, which makes you different. And so you're

336
00:18:03.599 --> 00:18:06.280
losing a little bit of ancestry every time. So

337
00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.180
you won't have the exact same DNA as your

338
00:18:08.189 --> 00:18:10.989
father or your mother and then your Children won't

339
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.050
again. So you're losing a little bit of information

340
00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.219
every time. Um But with the, with um with

341
00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:21.510
mitochondrial DNA, you don't really inherit anything other than

342
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.670
the mitochondrial DNA from your mother. So it's from

343
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.890
your mother's mother's mother's mother. It's inherited down the

344
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:30.079
female line. So if you go back 200,000 years,

345
00:18:30.089 --> 00:18:33.619
um it, it's much less informative than nuclear DNA.

346
00:18:34.089 --> 00:18:38.219
Um It, it doesn't recombine first of all. So

347
00:18:38.229 --> 00:18:39.949
you're not sort of, you don't have this continual

348
00:18:39.959 --> 00:18:44.050
process of getting this recombination, but you're absorbing, you,

349
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.339
you lose information but you gain information. Um But

350
00:18:47.349 --> 00:18:49.829
with mitochondrial DNA, by the time you coalesce back

351
00:18:49.839 --> 00:18:52.290
to the most recent common ancestor, you have retained

352
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.839
only a really small fraction of the DNA. Um

353
00:18:55.849 --> 00:18:59.290
THAT um um of the ancestry that you would

354
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.280
have had within that time frame. So all the

355
00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.790
ancestry that you had in the last 300,000 years

356
00:19:04.859 --> 00:19:07.410
going going back is, is really most of that

357
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.739
is lost if you just look at mitochondrial DNA.

358
00:19:11.199 --> 00:19:14.640
So it doesn't really matter if you have 1200

359
00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:20.959
mitochondrial genomes, you're still not gonna have most of

360
00:19:20.969 --> 00:19:24.910
the information from the human past, which means that

361
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.199
you have very little influential power. So it creates

362
00:19:29.209 --> 00:19:30.560
a huge problem if you're going to make a

363
00:19:30.569 --> 00:19:33.530
strong statement about events that took place hundreds of

364
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.109
thousands of years ago. So just a little bit

365
00:19:36.119 --> 00:19:38.109
of a contrast with genome wide studies where you're

366
00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:41.569
looking at nuclear DNA, you can look at individual

367
00:19:41.579 --> 00:19:45.250
genes and create gene trees for individual genes going

368
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.420
back hundreds of thousands of years. You look at

369
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.459
these independent gene trees and you gain several orders

370
00:19:50.469 --> 00:19:54.780
of magnitude, more statistical power. But even with this,

371
00:19:54.959 --> 00:19:58.619
without ancient DNA, it's extremely difficult to make precise

372
00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:04.979
inferences about populations in the deep past because many

373
00:20:04.989 --> 00:20:09.810
different demographic events can generate similar signals. And so

374
00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:14.160
it's very difficult to distinguish between models and you,

375
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.119
you essentially fall into a trap where it's very

376
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.520
difficult to make assumptions about the human past that

377
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.130
are, are justified because you need to make assumptions

378
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.560
about human mobility in that intervening period. So that's

379
00:20:25.569 --> 00:20:28.689
the problem with the data. So the next issue

380
00:20:28.699 --> 00:20:31.920
is is with lineages generally. So, so we talk

381
00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.930
about lineages, whether they're from mitochondrial DNA or individual

382
00:20:34.939 --> 00:20:38.859
genes. Um But it's important not to confuse these

383
00:20:38.869 --> 00:20:41.780
with populations and not populations. So if I derive

384
00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:44.810
um a tree from an individual gene on my

385
00:20:44.819 --> 00:20:48.010
DNA, that's not my population history, that's the history

386
00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.489
of a gene. Mhm. And today multiple distinct lineages

387
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.550
are usually shared across many different populations. OK. And

388
00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.099
that um that degree of sharing will be an

389
00:21:00.109 --> 00:21:02.199
outcome of all sorts of random processes that are

390
00:21:02.209 --> 00:21:05.959
shaped by population, demographic history, things of population movements

391
00:21:05.969 --> 00:21:08.560
and so on. There's no reason to assume that

392
00:21:08.569 --> 00:21:11.010
this would have been any different in the past.

393
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.270
And in fact, it, you know, it probably wasn't.

394
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.010
So it is really problematic to take say a

395
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.640
branch from mitochondrial DNA tree and assign it to

396
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:24.030
something that scientists call Haler groups, which are often

397
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.390
then viewed as population. So we say I came

398
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.079
from Haler group, a one, you know, that, that's

399
00:21:30.089 --> 00:21:32.229
a sort of random branch that some geneticist has

400
00:21:32.239 --> 00:21:36.550
assigned on a tree, it's not a population. Um

401
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.170
But unfortunately, it does get confused by these sort

402
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.930
of ancestry companies that give them these names and

403
00:21:41.939 --> 00:21:43.310
sort of say, you know, you came from this

404
00:21:43.319 --> 00:21:45.670
population called HAPA group. A one that came from

405
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.609
the Middle East. I mean, this is storytelling. Um

406
00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.430
So this is why that's a problem. Um And

407
00:21:52.439 --> 00:21:54.859
in addition to this, there were some statistical problems

408
00:21:54.869 --> 00:21:57.859
with the, with the analysis um itself where some

409
00:21:57.869 --> 00:22:00.130
assumptions of the tests were violated, but that's quite

410
00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.719
complicated. But in, in, in any sense, I don't

411
00:22:02.729 --> 00:22:05.479
think that matters as much as understanding the flaws

412
00:22:05.489 --> 00:22:08.760
of the data set itself. But really, even if

413
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.239
we ignore all this, let's say, let's say they're

414
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.800
right. And there is some evidence in, in this,

415
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:17.449
in this to show that the ancestors of this

416
00:22:17.459 --> 00:22:22.920
population were somehow um the original humans. How can

417
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:26.890
you say that they come from Southern Africa without

418
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.060
making the assumption that their ancestors were there 200,000

419
00:22:30.069 --> 00:22:32.560
years ago? And how do you square that with

420
00:22:32.569 --> 00:22:36.329
the abundant archaeological evidence of population movement, long range

421
00:22:36.339 --> 00:22:41.170
contracts on migration? Um All the fossil data. So,

422
00:22:41.609 --> 00:22:43.380
you know, it's, it's really problematic because there's a

423
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.349
lot of, a lot of data that's missed out

424
00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:50.300
that could have been in informative. And chan and

425
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.010
colleagues also refer to the fact that they're looking

426
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.869
for the origin of anatomically modern humans. And I've

427
00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.410
seen this in a sort of a response in

428
00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.180
interview and challenge. It's like we're not looking at

429
00:22:59.189 --> 00:23:00.910
the origins of humans, we're looking at the origin

430
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.329
of anatomically modern humans. Ok. So what does that

431
00:23:03.339 --> 00:23:08.280
mean? Because fossils show that modern and more primitive

432
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:12.189
anatomical traits that we no longer see today appear

433
00:23:12.199 --> 00:23:16.780
in different individuals in different mixtures? So some skull

434
00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.920
from one part of Africa might have more of

435
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.290
a rounded brain case, but like a more archaic

436
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.869
face, while someone else might have quite a more

437
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.560
of an archaic brain case, but like a really

438
00:23:25.569 --> 00:23:28.959
modern face or, you know, diff different features. Um

439
00:23:28.969 --> 00:23:31.619
And we see this mix um for a long

440
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:37.530
time and people like us. So people who, who,

441
00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.920
who have the constellation of traits that define modern

442
00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.739
people living today don't start to appear in single

443
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:48.430
individuals until sometime between 140,000 years ago. So that's

444
00:23:48.439 --> 00:23:51.329
long after we knew that humans emerged or anatomically

445
00:23:51.339 --> 00:23:54.280
modern humans emerged. So even this sort of language

446
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.479
is sort of problematic. And of course, it ignores

447
00:23:57.489 --> 00:23:59.849
the fact that fossils come from across the African

448
00:23:59.859 --> 00:24:04.709
continent and, and not just in one place. I

449
00:24:04.719 --> 00:24:07.540
mean, I think many former studies have demonstrated the

450
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.989
danger of making assumption, uh uh assumptions are made

451
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.079
of made unlimited data. So there have been many

452
00:24:13.089 --> 00:24:14.750
studies in the past where people have said this

453
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.949
is how it is very, very strongly. And then

454
00:24:16.959 --> 00:24:19.250
you find out that actually it was completely wrong,

455
00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:24.520
but this paper did receive like really wide dissemination,

456
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.609
it was really, really well publicized. And you know,

457
00:24:27.619 --> 00:24:30.339
the problem then for us is to try to

458
00:24:30.349 --> 00:24:32.849
correct those mistakes, to reach out to the public

459
00:24:32.859 --> 00:24:37.839
and say actually this is incorrect without causing people

460
00:24:37.849 --> 00:24:40.560
to lose their faith in science during a time

461
00:24:40.569 --> 00:24:42.300
when actually, I think we are having a crisis

462
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:45.770
of people's confidence in science. And each new headline

463
00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.290
that says human history has been rewritten is, is

464
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.709
really re reinforcing that, you know, we are not

465
00:24:51.719 --> 00:24:55.390
rewriting everything we know about um human prehistory worth

466
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.900
filling in the gaps, right? But I'm going to

467
00:24:58.910 --> 00:24:59.989
sell a headline like that.

468
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.329
No, I totally understand that. And I mean, when

469
00:25:04.339 --> 00:25:08.150
it comes to why these kinds of questions matter.

470
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.280
I mean, why does it matter whether we came

471
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:15.000
from one single population or several different populations in

472
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.569
Africa? I guess that it's not only the fact

473
00:25:18.579 --> 00:25:21.280
that we, of course, it's important for us to

474
00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.857
get the science right. Because this is a not

475
00:25:23.866 --> 00:25:28.057
getting the knowledge about our past as almost Sapiens

476
00:25:28.067 --> 00:25:31.656
and other s right. Which, even if you're only

477
00:25:31.666 --> 00:25:36.067
intellectually interested in it, I guess you already, it,

478
00:25:36.077 --> 00:25:39.357
it's important to get it right. But also when

479
00:25:39.366 --> 00:25:42.097
it comes to the science communication aspect of it,

480
00:25:42.107 --> 00:25:45.207
as you pointed to there, it's really frustrating because

481
00:25:45.217 --> 00:25:47.616
these studies come out and sometimes they get a

482
00:25:47.626 --> 00:25:50.193
lot of press and then people are where they

483
00:25:50.203 --> 00:25:53.604
have the the idea in mind that they came

484
00:25:53.614 --> 00:25:58.644
to a conclusion, a definite conclusion and they didn't

485
00:25:58.654 --> 00:26:02.843
really intend to correct people's ideas, the ideas of

486
00:26:02.854 --> 00:26:06.043
the more general population is very, very, very hard

487
00:26:06.213 --> 00:26:10.644
without people losing faith in science more generally, right?

488
00:26:10.654 --> 00:26:13.703
But also I would imagine and please correct me

489
00:26:13.713 --> 00:26:15.963
if I'm wrong here. But I would imagine that

490
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:20.270
another reason why this might be problematic and why

491
00:26:20.281 --> 00:26:24.211
these kinds of questions matter is that many times

492
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.620
they are not only informed by, but they also

493
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:34.470
inform some soc sociopolitical cultural issues. Like for example,

494
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.000
our origins in Africa or before we arrived at

495
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:44.290
that, at that consensus elsewhere. I mean, these issues

496
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:49.719
get very political, very quickly, uh usually for bad

497
00:26:49.729 --> 00:26:53.869
reasons because they tend to be associated with racism

498
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.079
and other kinds of bigotry. Uh And I mean,

499
00:26:57.089 --> 00:27:00.160
that, that's also another issue that we have to

500
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.949
take into account. Right. I mean, they, they are

501
00:27:02.959 --> 00:27:08.189
informed by this but they also inform those political,

502
00:27:08.199 --> 00:27:11.410
uh, let's say, manifestations and ideologies.

503
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.359
Right. Yes, I think you're absolutely right. Um, THEY

504
00:27:15.369 --> 00:27:20.709
do people, um, the way they, they imagine ancestry

505
00:27:20.719 --> 00:27:23.229
is how they think about, like, their recent ancestry.

506
00:27:23.239 --> 00:27:26.760
So everyone likes to think maybe about human origins,

507
00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.310
the way they might think about like the origin

508
00:27:29.319 --> 00:27:33.630
of their own ethnic group, their own family, their,

509
00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.239
their nation. And it, it rapidly gets mixed up

510
00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.880
in these ideas and people end up having an

511
00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.750
emotional connection. They want to look at ancestors who

512
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.609
look and sound and behave like them. Mhm And

513
00:27:45.619 --> 00:27:47.939
so if you say, well, your ancestors didn't look,

514
00:27:47.949 --> 00:27:49.739
behave or sound like you and went even from

515
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.939
the same region and some people can have an

516
00:27:51.949 --> 00:27:54.369
emotional reaction against that and it makes them upset.

517
00:27:55.619 --> 00:27:58.790
Um Especially if you, you're pointing to a very

518
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.880
different part of the world, maybe the one they've

519
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:04.349
never visited, maybe even one that they have some

520
00:28:04.459 --> 00:28:10.329
bigoted ideas about. Um So you know, how, how

521
00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:13.359
do we counteract that? Um And I think first

522
00:28:13.369 --> 00:28:15.839
of all is, is we need to educate people

523
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.670
on how they should think about ancestry generally because

524
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.910
your deep ancestry should not be thought of like

525
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.680
a family tree, even the way we think about

526
00:28:23.689 --> 00:28:25.599
our family tree is wrong because usually our family

527
00:28:25.609 --> 00:28:27.849
tree is a story of a surname, just one

528
00:28:27.859 --> 00:28:32.329
surname. Um The surname of all the other women

529
00:28:32.339 --> 00:28:35.560
who married into that family that gets lost. So,

530
00:28:35.569 --> 00:28:37.439
you know, you're still losing like most of the

531
00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:39.869
information, even when you think about a regular family

532
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.390
tree, if we go further back in time and

533
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.920
you ask, what is the origin of people living

534
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.859
today? The answer would be different again, because most

535
00:28:51.869 --> 00:28:56.150
of the genetic mutations have defined populations living today

536
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.439
appeared in the last 8000 years. So they appeared

537
00:28:59.449 --> 00:29:01.900
really with the advance of agriculture and the major

538
00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:07.270
biophysical changes that precipitated. So even, you know, I'm

539
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.270
not even going to say like, well, we're all

540
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.660
the same as people living 300,000 years ago because

541
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.839
we're not, we're more similar to people living much

542
00:29:13.849 --> 00:29:17.239
later on in time because we are continually changing.

543
00:29:17.739 --> 00:29:20.839
We're part of a story that twists and changed

544
00:29:20.849 --> 00:29:22.969
and we, we can, we should never think about

545
00:29:22.979 --> 00:29:26.869
immutable types that have always existed and will always

546
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.550
exist. We change, we are dynamic and we will

547
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.150
change again. People will get upset about what people

548
00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.719
are saying about us now probably. And that's really

549
00:29:36.729 --> 00:29:38.989
how we should, we should think about our ancestry.

550
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.660
So your question really has to be well defined.

551
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:46.989
What is my origin as a person from Malta

552
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:52.430
goes back to medieval times with um when, when

553
00:29:52.439 --> 00:29:56.869
the Maltese Islands were conquered by the Islamic dynasty

554
00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.550
from, from Tunisia where we got like our language

555
00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.459
and where people, you know, were replaced, the Byzantine

556
00:30:02.469 --> 00:30:04.689
people who lived here before, you know. So that's

557
00:30:04.699 --> 00:30:08.750
a completely different question to what is my origin

558
00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.719
as? Um I don't know, like a European or

559
00:30:12.729 --> 00:30:15.239
what is my origin as a human? You know,

560
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.520
the they're different scales and I think people need

561
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:18.880
to be a lot more clear on what, what

562
00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.160
they're answering um because people have changed and we

563
00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.599
will continue to change and we are in many

564
00:30:24.609 --> 00:30:27.969
ways very different to somebody living 300,000 years ago

565
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.739
and in many ways, very similar in terms of

566
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:33.680
our capacities as humans.

567
00:30:34.719 --> 00:30:39.739
Mhm A and so when it comes to understanding

568
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:43.130
how we evolved in Africa, I guess that this

569
00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:48.069
sort of debate between people who think we have

570
00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:53.040
evolved in one single location versus the more dispersed

571
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.459
idea, let's say, I also inform some of the

572
00:30:56.469 --> 00:31:00.439
ways we think about the selective pressures we, we

573
00:31:00.449 --> 00:31:04.729
were exposed to because many times particularly in the

574
00:31:04.739 --> 00:31:07.500
media, the press and so on. When these types

575
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:12.089
of questions uh are explored, people say or make

576
00:31:12.099 --> 00:31:15.560
claims like for example, oh, we've evolved in the

577
00:31:15.569 --> 00:31:18.569
rain forest or we've evolved in the, in the

578
00:31:18.579 --> 00:31:22.614
Savan or something like that. But if the dispersed

579
00:31:22.625 --> 00:31:27.074
model is the correct one, then how diverse were

580
00:31:27.084 --> 00:31:32.954
actually the landscapes we Homo Sapiens inhabited and evolved

581
00:31:32.964 --> 00:31:34.155
across Africa.

582
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.619
I think that's a really good question. I actually

583
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:39.329
think it's one of the most exciting questions we

584
00:31:39.339 --> 00:31:42.949
can ask at the moment because you know, the

585
00:31:42.959 --> 00:31:46.589
minute we move away from a single location and

586
00:31:46.599 --> 00:31:49.229
population model, then we're faced with the vastness of

587
00:31:49.239 --> 00:31:54.510
Africa and the diversity of Africa, the highlands lowlands

588
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.449
regions of diverse forest from dense rainforests. It's sp

589
00:31:57.479 --> 00:32:01.459
savannahs, mangroves on the coast, there's deserts, arid zones,

590
00:32:01.469 --> 00:32:04.589
great lakes, rivers. Um And of course, all these

591
00:32:04.599 --> 00:32:08.040
environments are like dynamically shifting. So what, what's rainforest

592
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:09.770
today may not always have been rainforests in the

593
00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.229
past. What's desert today may not always have been

594
00:32:12.239 --> 00:32:14.180
desert in the past. So we have these dynamic

595
00:32:14.189 --> 00:32:18.050
shifting landscapes and we're also faced with what we

596
00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.689
know about humans today that humans are the only

597
00:32:20.699 --> 00:32:24.130
animal on earth that has managed to colonize every

598
00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:30.709
single landscape from polar regions. Um Tundra desert, I

599
00:32:30.719 --> 00:32:33.709
mean, it, it, it's incredible and you know, is,

600
00:32:33.719 --> 00:32:37.390
is this something that only appeared recently or have

601
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.869
humans somehow always been able to do this? So

602
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.069
we have this weird juxtaposition in which we've been

603
00:32:43.079 --> 00:32:46.050
insisting on looking at humans as type to grasslands

604
00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.459
for most of human history. And this is something

605
00:32:48.469 --> 00:32:52.989
that's really at odds with our reality. Um And

606
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.250
also I think we have to look at bias

607
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:59.890
in the record. So, um you know, we've really

608
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.079
not scratched the surface of Africa. So I think

609
00:33:02.089 --> 00:33:04.709
there's an impression out there that you know, researchers

610
00:33:04.719 --> 00:33:06.599
have been working in Africa for a really long

611
00:33:06.609 --> 00:33:09.410
time, really kind of combed the continent and we've

612
00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:13.439
found these 10 skulls, you know, um, but the

613
00:33:13.449 --> 00:33:17.770
reality is we found maybe fossils from like 10%

614
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.719
of Africa and like 90% of Africa, we know

615
00:33:21.729 --> 00:33:28.189
very little about archaeological sites, maybe 25% of Africa,

616
00:33:28.199 --> 00:33:30.930
75% of Africa we know nothing about. So we

617
00:33:30.939 --> 00:33:34.369
know nothing about most of Africa. In other words,

618
00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.869
and we've been extrapolating from small regions to like

619
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:42.099
vast regions. So if we do that and we

620
00:33:42.109 --> 00:33:44.699
know that we, we can adapt to all these

621
00:33:44.709 --> 00:33:47.189
different landscapes today. And we know that probably we

622
00:33:47.199 --> 00:33:50.300
didn't live in one region, then it's very reasonable

623
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:55.410
to hypothesize that actually many different landscapes across Africa

624
00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.310
were inhabited by humans. Do we know that they

625
00:33:58.319 --> 00:34:01.349
did inhabit all these landscapes? This is work in

626
00:34:01.359 --> 00:34:06.150
progress. Um But we already know that humans, early

627
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.860
humans lived in man, yeah, mangrove forests and eco

628
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.840
to regions, you know, they lived in coastal forests,

629
00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.530
coastal grasslands, the edges of the desert. If, if

630
00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.310
the question then is sort of, when did this

631
00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.800
begin? When did this diversity begin? Do we see

632
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:21.899
it 300,000 years ago? Do we start seeing it

633
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:24.208
later in the record? The answer is we don't

634
00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:27.550
know yet. So this is something that we're only

635
00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.030
going to find out if we start to investigate

636
00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.550
the whole of the African continent, if we want

637
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.620
to understand human origins in a more realistic framework.

638
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:39.520
So we also have to look at bias in

639
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:43.879
the record. So it's, it's also much easier to

640
00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:46.560
look at these open highland regions in Africa of

641
00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:49.668
tectonic uplift where you find fossils, right? There's no

642
00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:53.179
vegetation, the visibility is amazing. These things are eroding

643
00:34:53.188 --> 00:34:56.629
out, there's uplift and you contrast that to dense

644
00:34:56.639 --> 00:35:00.909
lowland jungle where you don't see anything vegetation everywhere,

645
00:35:00.919 --> 00:35:04.280
preservation conditions are terrible, you know, bone very rarely

646
00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:07.129
survives. But that doesn't mean people were not there.

647
00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.959
And there's some really great research that's getting much

648
00:35:10.969 --> 00:35:13.850
smarter at looking at the signals of of human

649
00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.530
presence when you don't find maybe even artifacts or

650
00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.800
fossils. So there's some really inspiring work, for example,

651
00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:23.870
going on in the Amazonian rainforest where people are

652
00:35:23.879 --> 00:35:28.429
looking at um the distribution of particular trees and

653
00:35:28.439 --> 00:35:31.750
fruits and finding evidence that these things have been

654
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.689
moved around by people even though you might not

655
00:35:33.699 --> 00:35:36.469
always find the archaeology. So I think there are

656
00:35:36.479 --> 00:35:39.429
um really exciting new ways that are emerging um

657
00:35:39.439 --> 00:35:41.870
both within genetics and paleoecology to look at the

658
00:35:41.879 --> 00:35:44.790
signatures of, of people even when you don't find

659
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.360
um physical objects or bones showing that people were

660
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.439
there. And I think a lot of these methodologies

661
00:35:52.629 --> 00:35:55.070
can be applied in Africa to answer these questions

662
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:59.709
as well. So really to summarize um we don't

663
00:35:59.719 --> 00:36:01.719
know the answer to your question. We don't know

664
00:36:01.729 --> 00:36:05.709
how diverse and how early these environments were. But

665
00:36:05.719 --> 00:36:08.919
my guess would be that really from, from the

666
00:36:08.929 --> 00:36:13.590
beginning, proto humans and early humans were exploiting in

667
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.489
a range of different environments. And I think there'll

668
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.919
be some really exciting new research in this dimension.

669
00:36:19.929 --> 00:36:21.959
I think it's a very exciting question to ask.

670
00:36:22.479 --> 00:36:24.899
Mhm Yes. And I think that when it comes

671
00:36:24.909 --> 00:36:28.889
to studying our origins and human evolution, I think

672
00:36:28.899 --> 00:36:31.969
that uh you can look at it in two

673
00:36:31.979 --> 00:36:34.090
different ways. You can look at it as being

674
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.750
a little bit frustrating. The fact that we will

675
00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:41.560
probably always have an incomplete picture because we don't,

676
00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:46.020
we won't find every single possible fossil out there

677
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:49.179
or some of them might be lost forever. Some

678
00:36:49.189 --> 00:36:52.760
remains might not even have fossilized. So uh but

679
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.550
uh but you can also look at it uh

680
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.550
as a sort of um uh something that uh

681
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:02.879
that, that is really, I mean, interesting because uh

682
00:37:02.889 --> 00:37:06.909
over time, I it's fascinating because over time knowledge

683
00:37:06.919 --> 00:37:10.169
changes, you find uh a new site, you find

684
00:37:10.179 --> 00:37:14.040
new remains, you, you get more oh And with

685
00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:17.679
new technological developments, of course, as well. And with,

686
00:37:17.689 --> 00:37:22.110
with new techniques, we get uh closer uh step

687
00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.179
by step to a complete picture of human evolution.

688
00:37:26.189 --> 00:37:29.050
So there's still ongoing work and lots of work

689
00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.419
to do. But that's also fascinating, at least in

690
00:37:32.429 --> 00:37:34.050
my understanding. So.

691
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:38.969
Yes, absolutely. I think when I was an undergraduate

692
00:37:38.979 --> 00:37:40.810
back in the nineties, there was this sort of

693
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.909
sense that we knew most of it and we

694
00:37:42.919 --> 00:37:45.159
were just sort of filling gaps. And now I

695
00:37:45.169 --> 00:37:46.449
feel like I'm at a point where it's like

696
00:37:46.459 --> 00:37:50.399
we know so little and it's still a story

697
00:37:50.409 --> 00:37:51.239
to be told.

698
00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.889
No, it's really fascinating because there, there have also

699
00:37:54.899 --> 00:37:58.520
been over the past few decades, some more or

700
00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:03.000
less prominent philosophers arguing for the end of science

701
00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:07.600
because apparently we have already answered the main questions

702
00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:11.550
of. But II, I think that that there's many

703
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:15.969
more interesting things to find out because the we

704
00:38:15.979 --> 00:38:21.439
are not anywhere close to uh just closing the

705
00:38:21.449 --> 00:38:27.310
book on science. There's many other things. OK. So

706
00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.739
uh we've been talking a lot about Africa. What

707
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:36.949
about out of Africa migrations? I'm not sure if

708
00:38:36.959 --> 00:38:40.760
it's a plural or singular here. Let's get into

709
00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:43.419
that. So when it comes to migration out of

710
00:38:43.429 --> 00:38:47.939
Africa, migrations for Homo Sapiens specifically because of course,

711
00:38:47.949 --> 00:38:52.395
other previous ominous species also migrated out of Africa

712
00:38:52.405 --> 00:38:56.284
like Homo erectus, for example. But when it comes

713
00:38:56.294 --> 00:38:59.945
to Homo Sapiens for uh according to the best

714
00:38:59.955 --> 00:39:04.544
understanding we have now, was it one single migration,

715
00:39:04.554 --> 00:39:08.774
several different migrations? How did it play out exactly.

716
00:39:09.145 --> 00:39:10.705
So I think it, it depends on what your

717
00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:15.844
question is. So I think the answer is migrations,

718
00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:18.784
if we're just looking at this purely as human

719
00:39:18.794 --> 00:39:22.040
history, but we're looking at one migration, if we're

720
00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:25.899
looking at the ancestry of all non Africans today.

721
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:32.189
So we know that humans originated some time shortly

722
00:39:32.199 --> 00:39:35.149
before 300,000 years ago, let's say, let's give it

723
00:39:35.159 --> 00:39:38.020
a date of around 300,000 years ago for convenience.

724
00:39:39.209 --> 00:39:43.739
Um, BUT we also know that humans' ability to

725
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.469
get out of Africa is modulated by the Sahara

726
00:39:46.479 --> 00:39:51.239
desert. This was a time of ice ages. And

727
00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:55.050
when you have ice expanding in Europe, what you

728
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:59.409
have is desert expanding in North Africa. Uh WE

729
00:39:59.419 --> 00:40:01.679
don't get the ice going that far south, but

730
00:40:01.689 --> 00:40:05.570
you do get this sort of hyper aridity. Um

731
00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.479
At the same time when the ice retreats, you

732
00:40:07.489 --> 00:40:10.229
get more rainfall in northern Africa. And we see

733
00:40:10.239 --> 00:40:13.739
the desert shrinking when of course, there is like

734
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:17.010
an expansive desert is very difficult for people and

735
00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:20.479
animals to cross. But every time that desert shrinks

736
00:40:20.929 --> 00:40:24.040
during the periods between ice ages, then they can

737
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:26.939
get out. And what we see is that they

738
00:40:26.949 --> 00:40:32.879
did as along with other animals. The earliest signal

739
00:40:32.889 --> 00:40:37.090
that we know so far that suggests a migration

740
00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:39.830
out of Africa is as old as 260,000 years

741
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:46.189
ago. Around that time, the mitochondrial DNA of neanderthals

742
00:40:46.199 --> 00:40:50.669
ends up being replaced by the Neanderthal. Uh THE

743
00:40:50.679 --> 00:40:53.429
the mitochondrial DNA of a woman who was on

744
00:40:53.919 --> 00:40:57.629
the lineage of Homo sapiens. There was nothing special

745
00:40:57.639 --> 00:41:01.520
about that woman. It just so happened through stochastic

746
00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:05.239
processes that Neanderthal populations which were quite small, just

747
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:10.590
ended up inheriting the mitochondrial DNA of this lineage

748
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.709
until the older Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA was completely replaced.

749
00:41:15.129 --> 00:41:17.350
But what it would have been survives and what

750
00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:21.969
we see in Denisovans. So some humans at a

751
00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:25.250
very early stage get out of Africa and they

752
00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:30.250
become absorbed in Neanderthal populations. So this is nothing

753
00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.189
to do in a sense with like our story

754
00:41:32.199 --> 00:41:34.909
of everyone, anyone living today. But it's still part

755
00:41:34.919 --> 00:41:36.709
of the overall human story that I think is

756
00:41:36.719 --> 00:41:41.469
really fascinating. And then we move forward in time

757
00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.550
and we see fossils in in neighboring regions of

758
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:50.120
Africa um that also speak to this idea of

759
00:41:50.129 --> 00:41:53.209
a desert retreat and people moving out. So, um

760
00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:56.820
fossils in modern day re Carmel regions of Israel

761
00:41:56.830 --> 00:42:00.939
and Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, we start finding like

762
00:42:00.949 --> 00:42:03.949
these early fossils and perhaps even as far as

763
00:42:03.959 --> 00:42:07.969
Greece finding um early fossils of of, of Homo

764
00:42:07.979 --> 00:42:12.149
sapiens that are probably nothing to do with anybody

765
00:42:12.159 --> 00:42:15.840
living today. But still we find them there. And

766
00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:18.110
I think that's a really exciting story. But then

767
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.810
of course, the question is there were so many

768
00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:24.060
disposals out of Africa. What was so special about

769
00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.580
the later one that resulted in us? Why did

770
00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:30.459
everyone die out, left Africa before this time? And

771
00:42:31.379 --> 00:42:35.590
something between 60 50,000 years ago, some group left

772
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.350
Africa and they became successful enough that everyone who

773
00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.280
is an African today can trace their ancestry to

774
00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:43.399
this group. What was so special about them? Did

775
00:42:43.409 --> 00:42:46.320
they have a special technology? Did they have something

776
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:50.389
special about their culture. Um Was it that they

777
00:42:50.399 --> 00:42:52.959
live slightly longer, the grandparents who were around to

778
00:42:52.969 --> 00:42:55.800
help with the Children? You know, what, what was

779
00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:59.340
so special about them? The answer is we don't

780
00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:02.310
know, we don't know. But I think at this

781
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:06.030
point we have to admit that there doesn't seem

782
00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.760
to be any DNA that hasn't, that's still really

783
00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:10.820
in hiding. I think maybe there's some, like, maybe

784
00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:13.050
1% of DNA that no one's looked at where

785
00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:16.459
that could potentially harbor the signature of an earlier

786
00:43:16.469 --> 00:43:19.330
migration. But in like all the studies that have

787
00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.370
happened, it's not there. And it really does look

788
00:43:23.379 --> 00:43:26.639
like all Africans today are descended from this group

789
00:43:26.649 --> 00:43:31.469
that lived 60 to 50,000 years ago, 1 1000

790
00:43:31.479 --> 00:43:33.330
years ago. So what, what we can say for

791
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.760
sure is that even though this was a, a

792
00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:38.639
small population, it was big enough to be viable,

793
00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:47.169
maybe previous disposals were not. Um And they obviously

794
00:43:47.179 --> 00:43:51.429
were not swamped by, by neanderthals. Um It still

795
00:43:51.439 --> 00:43:54.790
was uh a genetic bottleneck for, for all Africans

796
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.510
because we can see that, you know, the DNA

797
00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.919
we inherited from these people is, is really like

798
00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:02.580
a small subset of the overall diversity we see

799
00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:06.219
in Africa. So we didn't inherit all of that

800
00:44:06.229 --> 00:44:08.620
diversity. We inherited a small part of it because

801
00:44:08.629 --> 00:44:10.949
it was a small population that left Africa at

802
00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.100
present. That's all we can really say. But it's

803
00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:18.780
still a very interesting question. What was so special

804
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:23.100
about them? Did they have some ability to um

805
00:44:23.929 --> 00:44:27.550
cope with the vastly different environments we see um

806
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:31.979
beyond Africa, uh we see diverse environments within Africa,

807
00:44:31.989 --> 00:44:34.850
but they're not the same as what we see

808
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.510
beyond Africa. If you move north, you end up

809
00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.770
in the pale optic zones, a significant temperature drop.

810
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:42.229
Or if you move to the east, you end

811
00:44:42.239 --> 00:44:45.239
up in the monsoonal oriental zones. A much more

812
00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:47.739
dense rainforest, much wetter even than the rainforest we

813
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.419
see in Africa. So you know that there are

814
00:44:49.429 --> 00:44:53.850
major differences, perhaps there was enough of them and

815
00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.889
they mix with some of the local Eurasian humans,

816
00:44:56.899 --> 00:44:59.260
maybe they absorbed some genes for immunity against the

817
00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:01.840
Eurasian diseases, maybe something like that help them out.

818
00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.469
Um We don't really know that story but all

819
00:45:05.479 --> 00:45:07.610
that can be said for sure is that there

820
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:11.489
were multiple dispersal out of Africa, but we non

821
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.110
Africans living today are only descended from one of

822
00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.290
those dispersal.

823
00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:21.699
And when it comes to that, uh last dispersal

824
00:45:21.709 --> 00:45:27.600
from which we originated, um do we know exactly

825
00:45:27.649 --> 00:45:32.360
the, I mean, information about the demographics and social

826
00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:37.679
structure of that population that migrated out of Africa?

827
00:45:37.689 --> 00:45:42.879
Because I was interested in understanding if something about

828
00:45:42.889 --> 00:45:46.919
those factors might have played a role in their

829
00:45:46.929 --> 00:45:50.260
success uh when they migrated out of Africa in

830
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:54.360
comparison to other earlier migrations. For example,

831
00:45:55.149 --> 00:45:58.570
unfortunately, we just don't know, but we can start

832
00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:03.959
to formulate some hypotheses. So for example, some genetic

833
00:46:03.969 --> 00:46:07.969
studies have suggested there may be evidence supports um

834
00:46:07.979 --> 00:46:12.260
intra African dispersal like uh an increase in inter

835
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:16.000
African dispersal prior to dispersal out of Africa, which

836
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:18.850
might mean that people were moving into new environments,

837
00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:21.010
that they were able, better able to colonize new

838
00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:25.800
environments. Maybe this gave them some special cultural advantage

839
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.689
when they were moving into new environments beyond Africa.

840
00:46:29.899 --> 00:46:34.179
We don't see any evidence so far for any

841
00:46:34.189 --> 00:46:39.810
technological developments with social developments, we already know that

842
00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:44.780
some human groups, by that time, we're probably practicing

843
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:49.820
social networking. And um but you know, we, we

844
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.790
might see this at an early stage as well

845
00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.169
because um some of the earlier dispersal out of

846
00:46:54.179 --> 00:46:57.280
Africa, we see people using, for example, shell beads

847
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.540
and things like that. So maybe it's just personal

848
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:03.790
ornamentation, but maybe this is also some group signaling,

849
00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.709
maybe it's part of like an extended social network

850
00:47:06.719 --> 00:47:09.330
where people were helping each other more. And in

851
00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:12.370
fact, we see this ethnographically today particular in um

852
00:47:12.379 --> 00:47:16.189
particularly in regions where the carrying capacity is low.

853
00:47:16.199 --> 00:47:18.790
So for example, maybe where it it doesn't rain

854
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.919
a lot, you don't have um a dense distribution

855
00:47:22.929 --> 00:47:25.209
of food. So people have to cooper more to

856
00:47:25.219 --> 00:47:28.280
food gathering and by building social networks, then if

857
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:30.050
times are bad for you, you know, you can

858
00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:33.110
go to that tribe, you know, like three days

859
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.040
walk that way and they'll, they'll help you because

860
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:39.500
we've been exchanging gifts for like centuries, for example,

861
00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:42.340
and the human's ability to do this and to

862
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.830
use material culture to say transcend co presence in

863
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.379
times before, like telephones, mobiles, the internet is like

864
00:47:49.389 --> 00:47:52.050
really, really important because it allows us to use

865
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.909
social relationships to transcend space and time. And so,

866
00:47:55.919 --> 00:47:59.080
if you know, humans are mastering this um at

867
00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:03.360
an early stage, then maybe, you know, this also

868
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:04.830
gives us an edge, but it's not something you

869
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.889
can easily see in the archaeological record. Mhm um

870
00:48:08.899 --> 00:48:11.520
As a very partial archaeological record. So, you know,

871
00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:14.530
these are the sorts of questions I think we

872
00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:19.250
can hypothesize about, but we certainly don't see, you

873
00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.540
know, humans coming out of Africa and you say

874
00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:23.080
something like, oh well, they have bow and arrow

875
00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:25.489
technology and that's what gave them the edge. You

876
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.989
know, we don't see something that simple. It's clearly

877
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.120
not a simple story.

878
00:48:29.129 --> 00:48:31.520
Uh What I was going to ask you is,

879
00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:35.969
so you mentioned, for example, sometimes people trying to

880
00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:40.889
point to certain technological developments as being behind the

881
00:48:40.899 --> 00:48:44.810
success of that specific population in moving out of

882
00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:49.193
Africa and expanding across the globe from that one

883
00:48:49.202 --> 00:48:53.202
population, of course. But uh I perhaps, um at

884
00:48:53.212 --> 00:48:57.173
least I personally don't care that much about what

885
00:48:57.183 --> 00:49:02.433
kinds of technological developments did we bring from Africa.

886
00:49:02.443 --> 00:49:07.333
But more the kinds of uh perhaps uh cultural

887
00:49:07.343 --> 00:49:13.693
features, social structure, structure features that would allow for

888
00:49:13.702 --> 00:49:18.295
us to move across different landscapes and step by

889
00:49:18.305 --> 00:49:23.815
step, adapt technologically, culturally, to live in the different

890
00:49:23.825 --> 00:49:28.186
kinds of environments, landscapes that we eventually occupied, I

891
00:49:28.196 --> 00:49:31.436
guess. At least for me that's a more interesting

892
00:49:31.446 --> 00:49:35.365
question than, oh, it was one population with bows

893
00:49:35.375 --> 00:49:38.635
and arrows or whatever that, that went out of

894
00:49:38.645 --> 00:49:42.446
Africa and they were already well equipped to survive

895
00:49:42.456 --> 00:49:43.815
anywhere, you know.

896
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.159
Yeah. So, um, we don't, we don't know, but

897
00:49:47.169 --> 00:49:48.889
we can imagine it must have been something like

898
00:49:48.899 --> 00:49:52.439
that because we don't see um any sort of

899
00:49:52.449 --> 00:49:55.719
smoking gun which is uh probably not the best

900
00:49:55.729 --> 00:49:57.860
uh pun to use. But like we, we don't

901
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.620
see that for the technology. Um INSTEAD, we have

902
00:50:00.629 --> 00:50:03.590
to assume it was something to do with how

903
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.780
people were able to network socially, how well they

904
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:11.310
were able to, to, to cooper and collaborate. And,

905
00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.879
you know, I think this really speaks to like

906
00:50:13.889 --> 00:50:18.909
our strengths as humans, right? That we, when we

907
00:50:18.919 --> 00:50:21.280
want to, we can collaborate and we can achieve

908
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:23.590
great things. And we see this really at the

909
00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.449
inception of humanity, we see a profound technological change

910
00:50:27.459 --> 00:50:30.250
taking place at 300,000 years ago that speak to

911
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.000
this because we start to see elements in the

912
00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:35.935
archaeological record that don't found together, that don't occur

913
00:50:35.945 --> 00:50:38.534
together in nature. So you have for example, a

914
00:50:38.544 --> 00:50:43.125
stone tip fixed to a wooden shaft using bindings

915
00:50:43.135 --> 00:50:46.804
made of plant material or animal material, using resins

916
00:50:46.814 --> 00:50:49.324
made according to recipes, you know, so you think

917
00:50:49.334 --> 00:50:51.554
someone had to know where to find the ingredients,

918
00:50:51.564 --> 00:50:54.764
someone had to know how to mix them properly.

919
00:50:54.784 --> 00:50:56.685
Someone had to know how to make the spears

920
00:50:56.695 --> 00:50:59.044
straight. Someone else is, is, is good at making

921
00:50:59.054 --> 00:51:01.364
the stone tips and finding the right more material.

922
00:51:01.375 --> 00:51:04.699
So this speaks to a co-operation at the very

923
00:51:04.709 --> 00:51:06.729
root of, of who we are and using that

924
00:51:06.739 --> 00:51:11.500
to um enhance our ability to survive to this

925
00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:15.189
spurs and to adapt to new environments. And we

926
00:51:15.199 --> 00:51:17.229
do adapt to new environments really quickly. You know,

927
00:51:17.239 --> 00:51:20.340
we know we left Africa between 60 50,000 years

928
00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:24.810
ago, that we reached Australia really rapidly passing through

929
00:51:24.959 --> 00:51:29.290
very different environments. In Borneo, there's evidence of people

930
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:33.669
processing toxic tubers in order to make them edible,

931
00:51:33.909 --> 00:51:37.860
um adapting to monkey hunting. And you know, you,

932
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:41.610
we see these changes happening very rapidly within like

933
00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:45.300
a few generations. Um So clearly people were able

934
00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:47.810
to cooper to, to adapt and to use their

935
00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.989
social capital to be able to do this. It

936
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.379
wasn't just about, you know, who had the biggest

937
00:51:52.389 --> 00:51:53.020
guns,

938
00:51:53.649 --> 00:51:58.600
right? So, and when it comes to how we

939
00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:04.229
dispersed out of Africa and the timings, because sometimes

940
00:52:04.239 --> 00:52:09.469
we see in popular writings and elsewhere, uh those

941
00:52:09.479 --> 00:52:14.169
need maps with precise dates as to how we

942
00:52:14.179 --> 00:52:18.459
dispersed into the Arabian Peninsula and then along the

943
00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:22.975
coast across India and then in to Oceania and

944
00:52:22.985 --> 00:52:27.625
then eventually up north, uh a across the Bering

945
00:52:27.635 --> 00:52:30.754
Strait into the Americans and so on. And uh

946
00:52:30.764 --> 00:52:35.534
supposedly, we were in South America around 15,000 years

947
00:52:35.544 --> 00:52:39.935
ago or so. But I, is that really precise?

948
00:52:39.945 --> 00:52:44.114
Are those states precise? And these, the movement mostly

949
00:52:44.125 --> 00:52:47.445
coastal across South Asia?

950
00:52:48.629 --> 00:52:50.739
Um No, I, I would say that they're not

951
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:53.330
precise. They are really just a model and, you

952
00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.060
know, as we know, all models are wrong, but

953
00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:57.820
it's just the best representation of what we know

954
00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:00.179
at the moment. So the dates are always based

955
00:53:00.189 --> 00:53:01.709
on whatever dates we have to hand. If you

956
00:53:01.719 --> 00:53:05.020
find something older, it's going to change everything. So,

957
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:06.469
um that's, that's sort of the way it has

958
00:53:06.479 --> 00:53:10.169
to work. Um The, the idea of a, a

959
00:53:10.179 --> 00:53:15.449
huge coastal dispersal doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Um

960
00:53:15.459 --> 00:53:19.409
People I'm sure use coastal routes where it was

961
00:53:19.419 --> 00:53:21.699
um useful to do so, but quite often it

962
00:53:21.709 --> 00:53:27.300
wasn't useful and inland routes would have been better.

963
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:29.969
And I think a famous example of that is

964
00:53:29.979 --> 00:53:33.510
a sort of out of Africa routes. Um There

965
00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.739
was a debate as to whether people crossed the

966
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:39.530
Bab Al Mandab Strait from the Horn of Africa

967
00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:43.610
to, to southern Arabia um across the Red Sea

968
00:53:43.939 --> 00:53:46.070
or whether they went on a land route following

969
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.760
the Nile and going across the Sinai Peninsula and

970
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:52.090
then either going south into Arabia or going um

971
00:53:52.889 --> 00:53:58.100
north up to uh the Levant area. Um So

972
00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:00.370
far there's been no evidence to really support this

973
00:54:00.379 --> 00:54:04.469
Bab Al Manda route. Um There's nothing, you know,

974
00:54:04.479 --> 00:54:07.340
that sort of shows that there's, you know, time

975
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:09.830
wise or even artifact wise. It really supports that

976
00:54:10.399 --> 00:54:12.270
so far. It looks like Southern Arabia is a,

977
00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:14.429
is a, is a cultural sink. You know, people

978
00:54:14.439 --> 00:54:17.389
get down there and then they sort of get

979
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.639
sort of stuck in these ecological bottlenecks and they

980
00:54:20.649 --> 00:54:24.399
diversify and they develop very sort of individualized, independent

981
00:54:24.459 --> 00:54:28.100
culture trajectories that are very interesting. But they, they

982
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:30.260
are interesting for their own sake rather than what

983
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:32.610
they're saying about this sort of overall story about

984
00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:36.739
how people dispersed. Um The, the way we, we,

985
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:38.939
we tend to like to think about the region

986
00:54:39.479 --> 00:54:41.479
um on these routes south of Africa is more

987
00:54:41.689 --> 00:54:45.679
um when, when the, when the routes open and

988
00:54:45.689 --> 00:54:49.810
close to the arid areas, um because they modulate

989
00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.830
that dispersal. So they're very important for us to

990
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.709
understand how they work. And also to think about,

991
00:54:54.719 --> 00:54:57.780
you know, the areas in terms of peripheral areas

992
00:54:57.790 --> 00:55:00.739
and cause of human habitation. So some areas are

993
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:04.340
continually habitable, more or less while others open and

994
00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:09.570
close. But they're both really important for understanding um

995
00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:12.139
population connections because you can move into a core

996
00:55:12.149 --> 00:55:16.020
area and you can stay there for jo generations.

997
00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:17.540
But unless you can get out and go to

998
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:20.719
other core areas, then you have population separation and

999
00:55:20.729 --> 00:55:22.919
it is the marginal areas in between and the

1000
00:55:22.929 --> 00:55:25.540
corridors that open and shut that allow people to

1001
00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:29.040
move around and exchange genes. So I think in,

1002
00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:30.540
in the, in the past, we've given a lot

1003
00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:33.010
of preeminence to the core areas because they're very

1004
00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:35.120
interesting. And you have these incredible sites that are

1005
00:55:35.129 --> 00:55:38.409
very deep and shows like continual um occupation. And

1006
00:55:38.419 --> 00:55:40.850
of course, they're like super interesting, I mean, amazing

1007
00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.979
places to work. But we've also found out that

1008
00:55:43.989 --> 00:55:47.419
unless we understand the margins in between and the

1009
00:55:47.429 --> 00:55:50.939
peripheral areas come and go in terms of habitability,

1010
00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:55.159
then we're only understanding half the human story. And

1011
00:55:55.169 --> 00:55:58.850
I think this is why understanding which, which areas

1012
00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:01.149
when they were warmer, when they were wetter when

1013
00:56:01.159 --> 00:56:03.800
it's possible to cross these regions, then we will

1014
00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:07.540
better understand, I guess those arrows on maps and

1015
00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:09.659
trying to make them more accurate.

1016
00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:14.080
And I would imagine that there are probably some

1017
00:56:14.090 --> 00:56:19.379
regions of the globe, like, for example, South Asia,

1018
00:56:19.389 --> 00:56:23.899
Central Asia that have been a little bit neglected,

1019
00:56:23.909 --> 00:56:28.899
right? In terms of studying fossils, their sites and

1020
00:56:28.909 --> 00:56:31.129
some other things like that. I mean, when it

1021
00:56:31.139 --> 00:56:35.100
comes to South Asia specifically, I'm trying to have

1022
00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:38.229
Doctor Sheila uh through uh on the show and

1023
00:56:38.239 --> 00:56:40.620
I think that she's done lots of work on

1024
00:56:40.629 --> 00:56:45.419
that about the how there's some many places across

1025
00:56:45.429 --> 00:56:50.770
South Asia where there's not been lots of work

1026
00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:51.290
done.

1027
00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:54.209
Right. Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think, you know,

1028
00:56:54.219 --> 00:56:56.149
we, we, I I've been speaking about Africa as

1029
00:56:56.159 --> 00:56:58.469
being a region where there hasn't been a lot

1030
00:56:58.479 --> 00:57:00.110
of work done, but actually that's also true of

1031
00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:03.500
vast regions of Asia as well. Um, BUT as

1032
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:05.459
an Africanist, obviously, I, I tend to sort of

1033
00:57:05.469 --> 00:57:07.570
stick more to Africa because that's the area that

1034
00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:09.419
I study, but it's absolutely true of Asia as

1035
00:57:09.429 --> 00:57:12.600
well. And it's really important to understand how people

1036
00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:15.949
maybe get into areas like India that's hemmed in

1037
00:57:15.959 --> 00:57:18.209
by mountains, you know, once they get in, it's

1038
00:57:18.219 --> 00:57:19.729
not so easy to get out. So you have

1039
00:57:19.739 --> 00:57:23.280
processes of diversification that are really interesting um to

1040
00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:25.350
understand there as well. And of course, you know,

1041
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:28.110
Eurasia was an empty. When Homo sapiens moved into

1042
00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.620
it, there were many different populations and I don't

1043
00:57:30.629 --> 00:57:32.669
think we're still completely clear on the degree of

1044
00:57:32.679 --> 00:57:36.429
diversity between these populations and the late survival of,

1045
00:57:36.439 --> 00:57:39.600
of, of, of different groups, whether they're the same

1046
00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:42.979
species or not is something that people argue a

1047
00:57:42.989 --> 00:57:45.139
lot about. I, I tend to avoid that discussion

1048
00:57:45.149 --> 00:57:47.449
because I think, you know, whether or not they

1049
00:57:47.459 --> 00:57:49.260
are or not, doesn't matter to me the fact

1050
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:53.010
is they're on neanderthals, Denisovans and, and humans are

1051
00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:55.919
on separate evolutionary trajectories. They're clearly in a process

1052
00:57:55.989 --> 00:57:58.989
of separation. And I think, you know, that's, that's

1053
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.459
the way we should think about it. Um So,

1054
00:58:01.469 --> 00:58:03.429
yes, I think, you know, it's really important to

1055
00:58:03.439 --> 00:58:06.830
understand all these peripheral regions, areas that haven't been

1056
00:58:07.129 --> 00:58:10.669
well studied um to understand what happened next in

1057
00:58:10.679 --> 00:58:11.709
the human story.

1058
00:58:12.419 --> 00:58:15.520
Mhm. Uh So, uh, before I move on to

1059
00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:17.250
the next question, let me just ask you. Do,

1060
00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.520
do you think that 10 minutes will be enough

1061
00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:24.959
to talk about Homo Sapiens in Saudi Arabia or?

1062
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:26.629
Yeah, it should be. Yeah.

1063
00:58:26.979 --> 00:58:30.600
Yeah. Ok. Ok. So, uh, I have then one

1064
00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:32.949
last topic that I would like to ask you

1065
00:58:32.959 --> 00:58:35.699
about today. So I know that you've also done

1066
00:58:35.709 --> 00:58:40.159
work on Homo Sapiens in Saudi Arabia specifically. So,

1067
00:58:40.379 --> 00:58:42.570
uh tell us a little bit about that. What

1068
00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:46.229
do we know about how we moved into Saudi

1069
00:58:46.239 --> 00:58:51.330
Arabia, how we got there and reps, why we

1070
00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:52.000
moved there.

1071
00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:57.899
So Saudi Arabia um is an extension of what

1072
00:58:57.909 --> 00:59:01.399
we call the Sahara Sahara Arabian arid belt. And

1073
00:59:01.409 --> 00:59:03.479
this is this arid belt across the earth that

1074
00:59:03.489 --> 00:59:06.919
sort of moves from um the western Sahara all

1075
00:59:06.929 --> 00:59:10.179
the way to the sort of um western tar

1076
00:59:10.189 --> 00:59:14.560
desert of India. And generally, when you see environmental

1077
00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:17.300
amelioration in one part of it, at times, you

1078
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:20.500
see amelioration across the whole belt. Um And so

1079
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:22.639
we, we try to understand them together even though

1080
00:59:22.649 --> 00:59:26.050
there are obviously some differences. And so if we're

1081
00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:28.679
interested in the Sahara shrinking and how this allows

1082
00:59:28.689 --> 00:59:30.909
people in and out, then we also have to

1083
00:59:30.919 --> 00:59:35.100
ask the same questions about the Arabian deserts. And

1084
00:59:35.110 --> 00:59:37.580
Arabia is also very interesting because as you know,

1085
00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:42.939
it's this geographic nexus between Africa, Europe and Asia

1086
00:59:44.689 --> 00:59:47.639
and it's going to modulate those connections. So people

1087
00:59:47.649 --> 00:59:49.399
get out of Africa, then they have to face

1088
00:59:49.409 --> 00:59:51.540
these deserts. If the gate is closed and they

1089
00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:55.530
can't proceed. Um If it's open, then they can.

1090
00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:57.979
And when it's wetter, of course, they can get

1091
00:59:57.989 --> 01:00:01.459
into northern regions of Southwest Asia, but then they

1092
01:00:01.469 --> 01:00:06.189
can also move um eastwards as well. And Arabia

1093
01:00:06.199 --> 01:00:08.179
then is, is, is a place to try to

1094
01:00:08.189 --> 01:00:10.870
answer the question. So that's where the interests in

1095
01:00:10.879 --> 01:00:13.830
Arabia came from Arabia. When we started working, there

1096
01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.570
was also really poorly understood. So there had been

1097
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:19.719
reports of lots of stone tools there, but there

1098
01:00:19.729 --> 01:00:24.750
were mostly surface scatters, very few excavations. Um Except

1099
01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.729
for a few done by this pioneer called Norman

1100
01:00:26.739 --> 01:00:30.250
Whelan, who, who, who conducted some excavations in the,

1101
01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.530
in the middle of Saudi Arabia. Uh And so

1102
01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:37.449
we knew that there was archaeology there just like

1103
01:00:37.459 --> 01:00:39.449
we knew there was archaeology in West Africa, but

1104
01:00:39.459 --> 01:00:41.949
no one had ever really investigated it in, in

1105
01:00:41.959 --> 01:00:45.850
great detail. And so we went to Saudi Arabia

1106
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.729
with, with Michael Petrolia who, who led that project

1107
01:00:49.419 --> 01:00:51.239
to try to understand what was going on there.

1108
01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:54.149
But we never intended to find, well, we never

1109
01:00:54.159 --> 01:00:56.300
expected to find, I should say an environment that

1110
01:00:56.310 --> 01:01:00.870
had thousands of lakes at a certain point like

1111
01:01:00.879 --> 01:01:06.290
thousands of lakes. Um um THESE ephemeral lakes, some

1112
01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.179
of them were all year around lakes. But there

1113
01:01:08.189 --> 01:01:10.399
was this landscape that was, you know, full of

1114
01:01:10.409 --> 01:01:13.699
hippos and elephants and maybe it looks a bit

1115
01:01:13.709 --> 01:01:17.510
more like Eastern Africa does today. And then even

1116
01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.290
more surprisingly, we found human remains in that landscape,

1117
01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.270
not just in the form of the stone tools,

1118
01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.370
but also as fossils. So we found a human

1119
01:01:25.379 --> 01:01:28.219
finger bone that was dated to about 90,000 years

1120
01:01:28.229 --> 01:01:31.189
ago, which was really exciting because it suggested that

1121
01:01:31.199 --> 01:01:33.570
some of the dispersal that we see a signature

1122
01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:37.590
of further north in Southwest Asia in modern day

1123
01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:42.389
Israel, um where maybe more widespread and you know,

1124
01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:44.750
one of the questions was, were they still around

1125
01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.530
60,000 years ago? Probably not because it started to

1126
01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:49.179
become a lot more, a lot more arid then.

1127
01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:53.000
But it is um uh sort of building this,

1128
01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:56.300
this forgotten story of, of, of some of the

1129
01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:59.679
earlier dispersal. But now we also think maybe we,

1130
01:01:59.689 --> 01:02:01.989
maybe we have neanderthals in this area as well.

1131
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.149
Maybe they're moving further south into these arid areas

1132
01:02:06.159 --> 01:02:09.409
because you know, the they're not much further north

1133
01:02:09.419 --> 01:02:10.969
to where we're looking in Saudi Arabia. So it's

1134
01:02:10.979 --> 01:02:13.889
not inconceivable that they're further south as well. And

1135
01:02:13.899 --> 01:02:17.409
then moving on in time, we find all these

1136
01:02:17.419 --> 01:02:20.600
uh um sort of major periods of prehistory in

1137
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:24.010
the stone age represented in Arabia as well. So

1138
01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:26.110
we can clearly see it, it does play this

1139
01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.929
important role in modulating connections between Africa, Southwest Asia

1140
01:02:30.939 --> 01:02:33.350
and further a field as well. So this is

1141
01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.879
what, what really drove this realization that we can't

1142
01:02:36.889 --> 01:02:39.159
just look at the cause of habitation. We have

1143
01:02:39.169 --> 01:02:41.550
to look at the peripheries as well. And Arabia

1144
01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.419
had just has this incredibly rich archaeological record. A

1145
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:48.679
very diverse archaeological record shows that people have been

1146
01:02:48.689 --> 01:02:52.389
going there over the past, probably like up to

1147
01:02:52.399 --> 01:02:55.820
a million years. Um It wouldn't surprise me and

1148
01:02:55.830 --> 01:03:00.899
leaving behind their diverse material culture traces, they go

1149
01:03:00.909 --> 01:03:03.669
extinct or they move on. The next wave comes.

1150
01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:05.479
So, yeah, so we had wave after wave of

1151
01:03:05.489 --> 01:03:08.129
humans probably coming from different regions of the old

1152
01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:12.199
world. Sometimes Africa, sometimes from the North, sometimes from

1153
01:03:12.209 --> 01:03:14.649
the East, probably coming into Arabia at different points

1154
01:03:14.659 --> 01:03:18.120
in time to take advantage of these ameliorated environments.

1155
01:03:18.129 --> 01:03:21.189
This growth of like probably savannah and gross and

1156
01:03:21.199 --> 01:03:23.760
like environments like we see in East Africa today.

1157
01:03:24.719 --> 01:03:28.290
And I think this really shows us that well,

1158
01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:32.590
it encapsulates this complexity of demography and human evolution.

1159
01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.429
Like who were these people? Where did they come

1160
01:03:34.439 --> 01:03:37.899
from? And the material culture traces are really different

1161
01:03:37.909 --> 01:03:40.080
with each greening episode. They come in with a

1162
01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:43.540
completely different material culture and even sometimes at the

1163
01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:46.340
same time in different parts of Arabia, you see

1164
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:50.989
very, very different um material culture remains which it's

1165
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.030
so different that it really speaks to different groups

1166
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.929
of people. We don't know if it's different species

1167
01:03:54.939 --> 01:03:58.379
but definitely different groups of people. So I think

1168
01:03:58.389 --> 01:04:01.500
what we see in Arabia has really driven this

1169
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:04.560
idea of the importance of looking at cause and

1170
01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:09.179
peripheries when it comes to population movements and it's

1171
01:04:09.189 --> 01:04:12.219
been a real revelation to see how much archaeology

1172
01:04:12.229 --> 01:04:14.419
there is in a place of people previously dismissed

1173
01:04:14.429 --> 01:04:15.540
as empty desert.

1174
01:04:16.439 --> 01:04:19.500
Mhm. A and by the way, when it comes

1175
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:25.860
to how Saudi Arabia looks like nowadays, does it

1176
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:28.909
have any, because it's much more arid than it

1177
01:04:28.919 --> 01:04:31.530
was back then? I mean, tens of thousands of

1178
01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.580
years ago. Does it have anything to do with

1179
01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:36.020
human activity?

1180
01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:40.929
No, I don't back then. The greening of,

1181
01:04:40.939 --> 01:04:43.489
of, no, I mean, I'm asking why it is

1182
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:47.399
much more arid nowadays. If it, yeah, if it's

1183
01:04:47.409 --> 01:04:50.810
the result of human activity or, or not,

1184
01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:54.090
probably starting to become part of human activity. But,

1185
01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.850
um, the sort of drying trend where it started

1186
01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:00.590
was a natural one. But of course, as, as

1187
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.409
we see climate change, it's getting hotter and drier

1188
01:05:03.939 --> 01:05:06.479
um, in, in certain parts of the world anyway.

1189
01:05:06.489 --> 01:05:09.050
Not, not others are getting like floods of course.

1190
01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:10.689
And extreme weather. So it's not, you know, a

1191
01:05:10.699 --> 01:05:13.770
one size fits all climate change. But, um, yes,

1192
01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.939
I mean, certainly now, um, we should be in

1193
01:05:16.949 --> 01:05:20.209
an interglacial period but it's not very wet in,

1194
01:05:20.219 --> 01:05:24.090
um, in the desert belt. Mhm. So it was

1195
01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.610
considerably wetter about 8000 years ago and has been

1196
01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.459
on a drying trend since then.

1197
01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:33.879
Mhm. So, Doctor Sherry, I, I'm starting to get

1198
01:05:33.889 --> 01:05:36.790
mindful of your time. So perhaps it would be

1199
01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.149
better for us to wrap up the interview here.

1200
01:05:39.159 --> 01:05:41.709
And maybe somewhere in the future we might have

1201
01:05:41.719 --> 01:05:47.120
another conversation just about Arabia itself, which I guess

1202
01:05:47.129 --> 01:05:50.090
would be very interesting. So, just before we go,

1203
01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.439
just before we go, would you like to tell

1204
01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.889
people where they can find you and your work

1205
01:05:54.899 --> 01:05:55.790
on the internet?

1206
01:05:57.479 --> 01:05:59.929
Um, I have a website which is my name,

1207
01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:03.330
Elena sherry.com. I try to put my publications up

1208
01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:06.429
there wherever I'm allowed to do. So, because sometimes

1209
01:06:06.439 --> 01:06:09.090
there are copyright issues that I can't overcome. Um

1210
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:10.979
But I try to have my papers up there.

1211
01:06:10.989 --> 01:06:14.590
So if anything has been interesting to anyone today,

1212
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:18.250
um I, I have my scientific papers up there,

1213
01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:21.100
but I also like to try to reach out

1214
01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:25.020
in comprehensible language. So not just complicated, complicated analyses.

1215
01:06:25.179 --> 01:06:29.030
So I do also have some um online um

1216
01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:32.850
work on websites like the conversation where I try

1217
01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.919
to sort of crystallize some of these ideas in,

1218
01:06:34.929 --> 01:06:37.179
in, in a simpler way. And also I think

1219
01:06:37.189 --> 01:06:39.649
on my website, I, I have links to wherever

1220
01:06:39.659 --> 01:06:41.389
I can, some of the more sort of uh

1221
01:06:41.399 --> 01:06:44.419
popular audience pieces where I try to explain these

1222
01:06:44.429 --> 01:06:46.989
ideas um in a, in a simpler way as

1223
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.989
well. Um Because you know, iii I am sure

1224
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.550
people don't want to log in and, and read

1225
01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:56.110
about boring, complicated mathematical problems.

1226
01:06:57.489 --> 01:07:00.399
OK, great. So I'm leaving links to that in

1227
01:07:00.409 --> 01:07:03.399
the description box of this interview and thank you

1228
01:07:03.409 --> 01:07:05.360
