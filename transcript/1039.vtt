00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.220
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.860
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lopes, and today I'm

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.180
joined by Doctor Jonathan Bobali. He's a professor of

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.159
linguistics at Harvard University. He specializes in morphology, syntax,

5
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.809
and typology, and today we're talking mostly about morphology,

6
00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:24.110
morphosyntax, human universal, universals in language and other related

7
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.860
topics. So, Doctor Bobali, welcome to the show. It's

8
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.969
a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.020
Thank you, thank you for having me.

10
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.229
So, I've already had a few interviews on linguistics

11
00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:39.590
on the show, but actually I've never spoken before

12
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.430
about morphology specifically, at least as far as I

13
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.979
remember. So could you tell us a little bit

14
00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.444
to start off with? What morphology is, I mean,

15
00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:53.834
as someone who is interested in morphology in linguistics,

16
00:00:54.084 --> 00:00:58.205
what kinds of questions are you interested in and

17
00:00:58.205 --> 00:01:00.365
what kinds of questions do people who work on

18
00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:03.325
this specific topic try to answer?

19
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.360
Great, yes, that's a great question. It's actually sort

20
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.000
of one of the smaller disciplines within linguistics, so

21
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.120
it's not surprising that you haven't heard much about

22
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.860
it. And so morphology is the study of words.

23
00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:17.540
The, the, the morph means form. It's the, the

24
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.500
form of words and the kinds of questions we

25
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.059
look at, um, we look at, um, uh, correspondences

26
00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:27.860
between form and meaning beyond the arbitrary. So, famously

27
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.860
100 years ago, more than that now, uh, Ferdinand

28
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.260
de Sousa pointed out that the reason the word

29
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.940
dog means dog is sort of arbitrary. It's just

30
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.540
a bunch of sounds, and they mean what they

31
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.029
mean. But beyond that, the word dogs just doesn't

32
00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:43.199
happen to mean a number of dogs. It means

33
00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:45.120
a number of dogs because it's got dog in

34
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.760
it and another piece and that other piece means

35
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.879
plural or indicates plural. Um, SO we like to

36
00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:54.279
look at cross linguistically, uh, at these complex words

37
00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:56.980
that have multiple pieces inside them, and we ask,

38
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.239
you know, what are the, are there any limits,

39
00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.440
any possible rules on the combination of those words

40
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.760
or the combination of the pieces to create words.

41
00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:08.210
So you get some neat puzzles like ambiguity. Um,

42
00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:11.038
THE word unlockable is a fun and interesting word

43
00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:13.770
in English because it can, it means almost its

44
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.770
own opposite. On the one hand, it means something

45
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.050
that is able to be unlocked. On the other

46
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.449
hand, it means something that cannot be locked. It

47
00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.259
is unlockable, you know, a door that has no,

48
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.360
no, no binding to connect it or etc. And

49
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.750
so we have a theory cross linguistically of what

50
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.949
the what the we try to develop a theory

51
00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:34.240
of how these relationships between form and meaning uh

52
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.080
are constrained in languages, like you said in the

53
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.380
introduction, whether there are any universals to this is

54
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.330
an open question.

55
00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:45.789
And what are these building blocks of words? I

56
00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:49.669
mean, what are the units that we're dealing with

57
00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:50.869
here exactly?

58
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.910
So the easiest way to think about this and

59
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.190
the way we like to think about it the

60
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.589
most, the sort of most constrained view, is what

61
00:02:56.589 --> 00:03:00.220
we call morphemes. It's morphology. We study. Morphemes, phonology

62
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.220
studies, phonemes, etc. Um, SO the, the, the pieces,

63
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.460
the, the un in unlockable, the Able and unlock

64
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.389
unlockable, the zoo in dogs, we call these morphemes.

65
00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.339
These are minimal, minimal pairings of, of form and

66
00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:16.940
meaning. And I say form rather than sound, uh,

67
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.490
we've discovered over the last, uh, time, uh, decades

68
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.820
that sign languages have exactly have analogous structures have

69
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.759
very much the same structures as spoken languages. So

70
00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.529
you'll see classical definitions that say pairings of sound

71
00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:31.860
and meaning, but it's really pairings of form and

72
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.460
meaning. These languages have exactly the kind of riot

73
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.289
structure that we see. There is, I should say,

74
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.889
right, morphology is based on the study of morphemes,

75
00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.339
but it's not always easy to break things down

76
00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.809
into pieces. So the past tense of run in

77
00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.970
English is ran. It's not like or the path,

78
00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.000
the plural of man is men. It's not like

79
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.080
dogs. You don't say mans. So it's less clear

80
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.960
that there's there's little pieces or morphemes in these

81
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.800
things, um, but it's the same general kinds of

82
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.149
ideas.

83
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.589
Uh, SO when it comes to morphemes and basically

84
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.039
how you break down words into smaller components, is

85
00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:14.365
that something that's, that You as a linguist, for

86
00:04:14.365 --> 00:04:19.785
example, just do because it's useful scientifically speaking to

87
00:04:19.785 --> 00:04:24.964
understand, to understanding how language works, or does it

88
00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:29.725
have a correspondent in terms of how we cognitively

89
00:04:29.725 --> 00:04:34.484
process language? I mean, do those smaller components correspond

90
00:04:34.484 --> 00:04:37.454
to something uh cognitively speaking?

91
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.299
But absolutely we believe that this is cognitively instantiated.

92
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.190
This is, this is a key piece of it.

93
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.510
Um, SO the kinds of evidence, uh, that we

94
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.589
take for looking cross linguistically, uh, we analyze individual

95
00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.829
languages as static systems. We say, what are the

96
00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:55.070
pieces of it. But we also ask how children

97
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.410
acquire these things, when they acquire these things. A

98
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.269
famous, um, uh, example that you may have come

99
00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:04.325
across elsewhere. Is what's called the WOUG test. Uh,

100
00:05:04.434 --> 00:05:07.494
THIS was, uh, Jean Berko Gleeson in the 1950s,

101
00:05:07.825 --> 00:05:10.304
uh, did a test with children to show, uh,

102
00:05:10.364 --> 00:05:12.665
these were 3 and 4 year old children. You

103
00:05:12.665 --> 00:05:15.024
draw a little figure that they've never seen before,

104
00:05:15.144 --> 00:05:17.535
some imaginary animal. You say, this is a wug.

105
00:05:18.065 --> 00:05:19.704
Uh, AND then you have two of them and

106
00:05:19.704 --> 00:05:21.704
you say, what are these? And kids say, these

107
00:05:21.704 --> 00:05:23.345
are wugs, and they know that this is the

108
00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:27.609
right way of doing it. Interestingly, Um, in English

109
00:05:27.609 --> 00:05:31.290
we have this distinction between and sir. So dogs

110
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.320
and cats, you don't say cat zoo and you

111
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.970
don't say dogs, so you could in principle, there's

112
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.179
nothing about the articulatory system that constrains us, and

113
00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:41.570
we can see this with what's called minimal pairs.

114
00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:44.250
I'm in Boston right now. There's the famous baseball

115
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.250
stadium Fenway Park. This is in a fen. A

116
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.369
fen is a kind of swamp, and when there's

117
00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:53.480
more than one, we say the Fenzoo with because

118
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.940
that's the the plural rule. Um, BUT, uh, we

119
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.890
can say the word fence. There's nothing wrong with

120
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.339
having a se after an N. It's totally reasonable.

121
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.140
You can put an S after an end, but

122
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.660
you don't. And kids know this when they are

123
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.119
3 and 4 years old without ever being taught.

124
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.540
This is the advantage of the log test. So

125
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.059
we know that there must be some developing cognitive

126
00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:19.209
system that manipulates these rules, um, uh, that, uh,

127
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.019
to some extent children have long before they have

128
00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:26.320
uh a conscious introduction or uh instruction about language.

129
00:06:26.549 --> 00:06:29.510
And so, Ultimately, this, this, this test was done

130
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.829
in the 1950s. People are now working on neuroimaging

131
00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:36.070
tests and uh much fancier tests, but we know

132
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.910
it is cognitively instantiated. Exactly how is a much

133
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.190
harder question that goes beyond. I,

134
00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:45.989
I understand that. But let me just ask you

135
00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:48.950
another question about that then. I mean, in that

136
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:55.920
case, uh, basically children, infants learning without direct instruction.

137
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.670
Are you referring to how they learn the rules

138
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.750
of the language they are being exposed to, or

139
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.070
are we talking about a broader cognitive system that

140
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.690
operates potentially across all languages or across different.

141
00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:17.859
That's a beautiful question. That's a beautiful question. Both.

142
00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:22.049
The answer is both. Um, SO, uh, they're learning

143
00:07:22.049 --> 00:07:23.929
the rules, as you say, in this case, the

144
00:07:23.929 --> 00:07:25.769
rule is a rule of adding the rule has

145
00:07:25.769 --> 00:07:28.730
two components. One is adding S or Z, and

146
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.529
one is choosing between S or Z. The choice

147
00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:34.010
between S or Z is is a phonological rule.

148
00:07:34.059 --> 00:07:35.839
It has to do with the way sounds combine,

149
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.489
and as I said, it's a non-obvious rule. If

150
00:07:38.489 --> 00:07:40.929
you think about it, uh, we can say the

151
00:07:40.929 --> 00:07:42.929
S after an N, but we don't in the

152
00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:45.809
plural. So there's something very special and and uh

153
00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:48.640
English specific about it that children need to learn.

154
00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:50.250
So this is a rule, but it's also a

155
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.579
piece. The S is the S plural is a

156
00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:55.269
piece. It's one of these morphemes. So we are

157
00:07:55.269 --> 00:07:59.350
interested in how children acquire the language that they

158
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.299
are exposed to as you frame it. Um, LONG

159
00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:04.750
before any parents aren't saying, this is how you

160
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.190
say the plural, this is how you say the

161
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.589
plural. And also, children have to figure out why

162
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:12.510
you don't say mans. They sometimes make errors and

163
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.910
say things like this, or foots, right? Why you

164
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.790
say feet. So they have to learn the pieces,

165
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:18.739
they have to learn the rules, and all of

166
00:08:18.739 --> 00:08:21.859
these things involve, uh, so the specific pieces and

167
00:08:21.859 --> 00:08:24.769
the specific. Rules are specific to the language that

168
00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:26.970
they're learning. And this is a really interesting area

169
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.290
of study. How do they do this? How do

170
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.808
they do this so quickly? There is a sparsity

171
00:08:32.808 --> 00:08:35.039
of data. There's, there's a limited amount of time

172
00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.090
in the day. There's a limited number of words

173
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.549
that kids hear. There's an infinite number of possible

174
00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:43.250
rule systems that they could be acquiring that would

175
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.219
be compatible, that would describe accurately. The language they're

176
00:08:47.219 --> 00:08:49.739
exposed to, but they tend very quickly to hone

177
00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:51.390
in on the same one, and they get there

178
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.900
very fast, and that's neat. That's a very interesting

179
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.859
idea. And that then asks this question you said

180
00:08:56.859 --> 00:09:00.460
earlier about the the broader cognitive system of all

181
00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:05.010
of language. So, It, it seems to be that

182
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.919
they are not just what we used to consider

183
00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:10.250
a blank slate. This was a proposal from a

184
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.700
long time ago, that the, the child's mind is

185
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.210
a blank slate upon which the experience writes. It

186
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.650
seems to be constrained in various ways. There are

187
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.849
patterns there are, first of all, children learn very

188
00:09:20.849 --> 00:09:23.690
quickly and converge on some hypotheses and, and not

189
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.330
others. And secondly, cross linguistically, this comes back to

190
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
what we were saying. Cros linguistically, certain patterns occur

191
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.179
in. Many languages and other, uh, patterns don't occur,

192
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.940
uh, in any languages that we know of. And

193
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.539
that suggests it's another type of evidence that suggests

194
00:09:39.539 --> 00:09:43.500
that there's some kind of cognitive limitation on the

195
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.940
hypotheses, if you will, that that learners will, will

196
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.260
pause it when they're analyzing the language data. And

197
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.059
we're trying to capture that. We're trying to figure

198
00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:56.340
that out, kind of reverse engineer the system, but

199
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.690
from the data that we have.

200
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:03.010
Mhm. So we'll get more into human universals and

201
00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.679
language and more specifically morphology later on in our

202
00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:09.859
conversation. There are some other very interesting questions to

203
00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:13.679
explore here. But just before that, uh, I think

204
00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:16.450
that you've already touched a little bit on this

205
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:20.210
question in your previous answers, but what can we

206
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.650
learn about language by studying morphology then?

207
00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:27.010
We can learn a lot. I hope we can

208
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.640
learn a lot because this is what I do,

209
00:10:28.809 --> 00:10:31.650
right? Um, SO, uh, one thing we can try

210
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.440
to figure out again by looking at what patterns

211
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.409
occur and what patterns don't occur, uh, we can

212
00:10:37.409 --> 00:10:40.030
begin to build an idea, um, of how the

213
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.929
human cognitive system works. Ultimately, that's the goal is

214
00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:44.760
to get to the cognitive system, but it's a,

215
00:10:44.849 --> 00:10:47.960
it's a distant goal. It's on the horizon right

216
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.400
now, we look for it, we're at the level

217
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.090
of looking for these patterns cross linguistically. If I

218
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.200
could, for example, Uh, switch to one of the

219
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.400
universal patterns at the moment. Now, we'll come back.

220
00:10:58.479 --> 00:10:59.719
I know you want to talk about this in

221
00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:01.760
more detail later, but I think this gives you

222
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.059
a good way of of answering this question. Um,

223
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.580
uh, WORK I did a number of years ago,

224
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.630
um, uh, looked at comparatives and superlatives. So you

225
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.750
say good and you say better, and in a

226
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.590
language where you say, so you say big, bigger,

227
00:11:15.669 --> 00:11:20.070
biggest, right? Um, Portuguese, you do these paraphrastically, I

228
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.710
think, right? You say the analog of big, more

229
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.099
big, and the more big. Yes, um, but the,

230
00:11:28.109 --> 00:11:30.989
um, uh, the interesting thing is for the irregular

231
00:11:30.989 --> 00:11:35.419
ones like, uh, good, better, best. You never find

232
00:11:35.419 --> 00:11:38.859
a language that says good, the equivalent of better

233
00:11:38.859 --> 00:11:41.530
with a totally different form, and then goes back

234
00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.979
and says goodest. You don't you you don't say

235
00:11:43.979 --> 00:11:46.849
good, better, goodest. Why not? Well, this turns out

236
00:11:46.849 --> 00:11:50.219
to be like sort of an interesting finding across

237
00:11:50.219 --> 00:11:51.940
lots and lots and lots of languages. I believe

238
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.919
it's a universal. I know I have no counter

239
00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:56.299
examples. Uh, AND if that's true, what does that

240
00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.979
tell us? OK, we've documented the languages, we've made

241
00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:01.530
a list and we have this neat fact. But

242
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.210
the explanation that seems to be on the table

243
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.960
is one that goes along the lines of saying,

244
00:12:07.289 --> 00:12:10.049
uh what does best mean? There's sort of two

245
00:12:10.049 --> 00:12:14.010
things best could mean. One could mean just exceedingly

246
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.119
good, like very, very, very good. Uh, THIS would

247
00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:20.039
be these Isimo type adjectives that you have in

248
00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:22.890
romance that we lack in, in English, something like

249
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.419
Bellissimo or whatever, um. But another one is the

250
00:12:26.419 --> 00:12:28.940
more specific one, and the more specific one, the

251
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.260
meaning of the superlative is more adjective than all

252
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.849
others, right? So if I say something is the

253
00:12:35.859 --> 00:12:38.820
the tallest mountain, right, it is taller than all

254
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.059
other mountains, and that taller piece is comparative inside

255
00:12:42.059 --> 00:12:44.969
it has this comparative meaning inside it. In English,

256
00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:47.530
taller and tallest don't look like they have the

257
00:12:47.539 --> 00:12:50.580
the morphology inside them, in Portuguese they do, because

258
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.030
you put the definite article in front. But it

259
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.030
looks, the only way to understand why this is

260
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.940
a universal is if all languages really are Portuguese,

261
00:12:59.229 --> 00:13:04.190
but hidden. So English tallest really is the more

262
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.070
tall, the one that is taller than all of

263
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.650
the others. If that's true, we learned this from

264
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.849
morphology from looking at the various pieces in the

265
00:13:10.849 --> 00:13:15.369
words. But what we've discovered is a constraint on

266
00:13:15.369 --> 00:13:19.270
the way we as humans conceptualize, at least for

267
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:23.039
the language system, the meaning of the superlative relationship.

268
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:24.890
So you wouldn't get that from a textbook. If

269
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.729
you look at a textbook of English or German

270
00:13:26.729 --> 00:13:28.890
or whatever, it just says, here's the comparative, here's

271
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.349
the superlative. But it turns out this is the

272
00:13:31.349 --> 00:13:33.710
way we conceive of it. Why? There's all different

273
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.989
ways we could have conceived of it. There's all

274
00:13:35.989 --> 00:13:37.950
different ways the world could have been, but it

275
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.989
is this way. And so you ask this as

276
00:13:40.989 --> 00:13:44.219
a long-winded answer, but you asked about the, uh,

277
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.270
what studying morphology tells us, and here it's telling

278
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:51.349
us something about the cognitive, uh, uh, conception of

279
00:13:51.349 --> 00:13:55.294
in this case, um, uh. The meaning of the

280
00:13:55.294 --> 00:13:59.325
superlative, but all kinds of aspects of, of how,

281
00:13:59.575 --> 00:14:03.135
uh, concepts are encoded in language seem to follow

282
00:14:03.135 --> 00:14:06.534
these kinds of universal generalizations. And that's exciting because

283
00:14:06.534 --> 00:14:09.525
it's non-obvious and it comes from the linguistic system.

284
00:14:10.655 --> 00:14:12.455
I can give you a second example quickly if

285
00:14:12.455 --> 00:14:12.854
you want,

286
00:14:13.525 --> 00:14:14.534
but yes, please go ahead.

287
00:14:14.815 --> 00:14:18.385
OK. So, uh, another neat example that comes from

288
00:14:18.385 --> 00:14:21.534
morphology, this one's a little bit complicated, but again,

289
00:14:21.614 --> 00:14:24.969
it's a meaning one. Um, uh, IF you think

290
00:14:24.969 --> 00:14:28.890
about, um, words like open or closed, they can

291
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.169
be adjectives or they can be verbs. And so

292
00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:33.489
if we say, uh, so, you know, I'm in

293
00:14:33.489 --> 00:14:35.809
New England and New England has snowy weather in

294
00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:38.450
the winter, so imagine we think about a mountain

295
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.650
pass, and you say that the mountain pass, let's

296
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.729
imagine there's a, let's imagine there's a shoulder of

297
00:14:44.729 --> 00:14:47.849
a mountain, it has no dip inside it, um.

298
00:14:48.099 --> 00:14:50.599
And what happens at some point is there's a

299
00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:53.510
rockfall or an avalanche and a, and a dip

300
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.599
appears. This dip has never been there before, and

301
00:14:55.599 --> 00:14:57.119
now we have a pass. We say a pass

302
00:14:57.119 --> 00:14:59.669
has opened up, right? Then there's another rock fall

303
00:14:59.669 --> 00:15:01.950
and it fills it in. We can say, oh,

304
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.010
the pass is closed again. Right? Well, that's interesting

305
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.840
again here is really interesting because it has never

306
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.359
been closed before. Nobody had closed it before. It

307
00:15:13.359 --> 00:15:16.239
opened once and then went closed again. So what

308
00:15:16.239 --> 00:15:19.099
this again. IS doing is it's saying it's returning

309
00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.909
to the state of being closed. The verb, the

310
00:15:22.909 --> 00:15:27.190
action, close the past, has never happened before. But

311
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.900
it's a return, we call it a restituive reading.

312
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.590
It is returned to the state. You can think

313
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.630
of all kinds of examples. A student at McGill

314
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.059
wrote a dissertation looking at this. You can think

315
00:15:36.059 --> 00:15:39.780
of, um, an underwater cave that's full of water.

316
00:15:39.989 --> 00:15:41.640
And then the water level goes down and it

317
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.270
and it dries out, and then Global warming, the

318
00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.190
water level rises again, and the the cave is

319
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.979
filled in again, right? We can use this again,

320
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:55.830
even though it's false to say you that we

321
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.349
filled in, like the action of filling in has

322
00:15:58.349 --> 00:16:00.580
happened for a second time. It only happened once,

323
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.469
but it returns it to its previous state. So

324
00:16:03.469 --> 00:16:05.460
you might think, so there's an analysis out there

325
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.869
that says, OK, this is because the semantics of

326
00:16:07.869 --> 00:16:11.669
the word again, what again means is ambiguous in

327
00:16:11.669 --> 00:16:13.619
English. It can mean either of these two things.

328
00:16:13.869 --> 00:16:15.789
But it turns out it means the same ambiguity,

329
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.270
the same two things in language after language after

330
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:22.530
language. Um, uh, A student at University of Connecticut

331
00:16:22.789 --> 00:16:25.510
wrote a dissertation showing this for Chinese, for Mandarin

332
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.349
that shows exactly the same ambiguity. So why is

333
00:16:28.349 --> 00:16:32.270
this morphology? Well, in a number of languages, the

334
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.840
way you say to open or to close has

335
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.739
an extra morpheme. It's like in English we say

336
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.590
the screen is wide, actually, let's say the screen

337
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.390
is narrow. I want to widen it. There's a

338
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.409
wide piece and a morpheme in. And so they

339
00:16:47.409 --> 00:16:50.780
again can refer just to the adjective or to

340
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.000
the adjective plus the verbal morpheme, the complex verb.

341
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.729
That ambiguity is a morphological ambiguity. It's hidden in

342
00:16:57.729 --> 00:16:59.770
English because when we say open, it looks like

343
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.530
it's the same word, but it really isn't. There's

344
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.744
really two pieces in. And we can pick them

345
00:17:03.744 --> 00:17:06.064
up semantically, and we can do this in language

346
00:17:06.064 --> 00:17:09.704
after language after language. So again, we've learned something

347
00:17:09.704 --> 00:17:13.864
about the way language is encode our perception of

348
00:17:13.864 --> 00:17:17.255
events in the world. So we encode a notion

349
00:17:17.255 --> 00:17:20.509
like opening. As having two pieces. There's a causal

350
00:17:20.509 --> 00:17:23.788
piece, and there's a state piece, and the linguistic

351
00:17:23.788 --> 00:17:26.388
system can pick out those pieces individually. It's a

352
00:17:26.388 --> 00:17:28.668
bit of a complex example. But these are the

353
00:17:28.668 --> 00:17:31.588
kinds of things that we study, um, over and

354
00:17:31.588 --> 00:17:34.749
over and over. Again, as you framed it, there's

355
00:17:34.749 --> 00:17:36.708
a fun day to day part, which is finding

356
00:17:36.708 --> 00:17:39.209
the pieces. And segmenting it into, but that's just

357
00:17:39.209 --> 00:17:42.300
the starting part. At the end behind it, we're

358
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.540
asking these deeper questions about why do we find

359
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.660
the same, uh, patterns in language after language? And

360
00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.020
what does that tell us about human cognition, both

361
00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.699
the system of language and the system of encoding

362
00:17:53.699 --> 00:17:55.579
meaning in language. Mhm.

363
00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.650
And what is more for syntax?

364
00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:05.209
Yeah, cool. Good question. Um, SO, uh, morphosyntax has

365
00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:06.849
two pieces in it, right? It has morpho and

366
00:18:06.849 --> 00:18:09.489
it has syntax. It's a complex word. It's morphemes.

367
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.400
And so morpho is, is the morphology part, and

368
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.319
syntax is how words combined together to make phrases.

369
00:18:15.569 --> 00:18:17.010
And so one of the things we ask as

370
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.250
morphologists, we pay an eye to, so when I

371
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:22.520
looked at dog and dogs, I was looking primarily,

372
00:18:22.599 --> 00:18:24.380
the example I gave you was about the silent,

373
00:18:24.489 --> 00:18:27.719
the so the alternation. But there's also a study

374
00:18:27.719 --> 00:18:31.880
of of how individual words relate to syntax, to

375
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.000
the study of phrases and the study of sentences.

376
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.829
So, uh, just to take an example, your dog

377
00:18:38.839 --> 00:18:42.699
dogs example, um, that's a plural word and so

378
00:18:42.699 --> 00:18:45.280
it would occur in a plural syntactic environment, you

379
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.719
would say one dog, two dogs. Interesting on this,

380
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.000
one of the things you could look at in

381
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.050
morphosyntax, um. Some languages like English, Portuguese, and others

382
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.329
have a number distinction. We have singular and plural.

383
00:18:57.369 --> 00:19:00.010
There's other languages with other number distinctions, that's also

384
00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.859
very interesting. Um, AND we use the plural when

385
00:19:02.859 --> 00:19:05.239
we say when we count, we say two dogs,

386
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.520
and we use the plural when we talk about,

387
00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.770
uh, a plural group. We say, oh, dogs are

388
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:13.469
in the garden or something of this sort. Um,

389
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.790
THERE are languages that have no number distinction that

390
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.630
never mark this, um, and there are interestingly languages

391
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.349
that mark plural dog dogs, when you say I

392
00:19:23.349 --> 00:19:26.150
like dogs, or I saw dogs yesterday, but not

393
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.270
when you put a number there. You say two

394
00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.579
dogs, Turkish is of this sort. You say, uh,

395
00:19:31.709 --> 00:19:33.579
they have a plural, there's a clear plural marker,

396
00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:36.250
but when you use it with a number. Evidently

397
00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.369
the number conveys enough information. The plural in English

398
00:19:39.369 --> 00:19:42.050
is somehow redundant in that fact. 2, you already

399
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.209
said 2, but we have to say dogs, you

400
00:19:44.209 --> 00:19:49.310
can't say two dogs. So morphosyntax studies, um, so

401
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.630
where morphology proper studies the internal form of words

402
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:56.189
and maybe their connection to sound and meaning, morphosyntax

403
00:19:56.189 --> 00:20:01.430
studies the the syntactic contexts in which words do

404
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.310
and don't occur. And again, we ask the same

405
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.750
kinds of questions about universals and recurring patterns and

406
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.510
how children acquire those patterns and what they tell

407
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.510
us about the cognitive apparatus.

408
00:20:12.699 --> 00:20:15.900
But what is then the relationship or how should

409
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.619
we look at the relationship between morphology and syntax?

410
00:20:19.699 --> 00:20:23.859
Is it that one drives the other, or is

411
00:20:23.859 --> 00:20:28.640
it that both influence each other in different ways?

412
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.260
Yeah, uh, this is something if you get a

413
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.020
bunch of morphologists together at a conference, we will

414
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:39.939
fight. Um, SO, um, um. So let's go back,

415
00:20:39.969 --> 00:20:42.979
so, so to unlockable or even just take lockable,

416
00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:46.189
right? Or or or teacher and teachable and teach

417
00:20:46.189 --> 00:20:48.550
and stuff. Teaches a verb, so it goes in

418
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.959
a particular place in the in the syntax in

419
00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.589
a language like English has particular set of properties.

420
00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.449
Uh, A teacher is a noun, so I can't

421
00:20:56.449 --> 00:20:59.130
teach you and I can't teach you. It's a

422
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.329
teachable as an adjective, so it's gonna have a

423
00:21:01.329 --> 00:21:04.489
different syntax. And it seems reasonable from this kind

424
00:21:04.489 --> 00:21:07.209
of example to say, to take the phrase you

425
00:21:07.209 --> 00:21:10.170
use that morphology drives syntax, that you build the

426
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.089
words, you, you have the word teach, it's a

427
00:21:12.089 --> 00:21:14.959
verb, and so it has a particular syntax. Um,

428
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.310
OR you make the word teacher, it's a noun,

429
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.869
and so it had because you have added this

430
00:21:19.869 --> 00:21:23.780
suffix er, it has a particular a different syntax,

431
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.829
a nominal syntax, you say the teacher is whatever

432
00:21:26.829 --> 00:21:31.319
tall, short, boring, interesting something. Um, AND so this

433
00:21:31.319 --> 00:21:33.949
makes you think, OK, that the the morphology is

434
00:21:33.949 --> 00:21:36.530
prior. First you put the pieces together and then

435
00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:39.270
what you've done in the morphology drives or determines

436
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:43.630
your syntax. But there's other examples that work differently,

437
00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:45.959
that seem to suggest the other direction, and this

438
00:21:45.959 --> 00:21:49.599
is why this is a live question. Um, LET'S

439
00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:50.969
see if I can give you an example in

440
00:21:50.969 --> 00:21:56.709
quick form. So, um, I, I, in English we

441
00:21:56.709 --> 00:22:00.849
have in inflectional morphology we're relatively poor. In some

442
00:22:00.849 --> 00:22:03.550
languages, when you take the verb, the verb shows

443
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.939
what the person and number of the subject are.

444
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:07.750
In English, you get that a bit with B

445
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.670
I M U R, uh she is, etc. BUT

446
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.670
with regular verbs in the present tense, we only

447
00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:17.349
have a two-way distinction. He, she, it works and

448
00:22:17.349 --> 00:22:19.349
everything else is work. I work, you work, they

449
00:22:19.349 --> 00:22:22.689
work, etc. There's no ending on these things. And

450
00:22:22.689 --> 00:22:25.250
it actually turns out to be hard to, you

451
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.489
could sort of say that works is driving the

452
00:22:27.489 --> 00:22:30.219
syntax. Works is third person singular. It takes a

453
00:22:30.219 --> 00:22:32.310
third person singular subject because it has the S

454
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.770
on it. But the other one doesn't have any

455
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.609
information on it. So you could say, OK, it

456
00:22:37.609 --> 00:22:40.010
just doesn't contribute any information, and that's why you

457
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.489
have a pronoun. I work, you work, they work

458
00:22:42.489 --> 00:22:45.770
but uh Turkish to dog. You don't need to

459
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.849
have an ending on it cause the ending is

460
00:22:47.849 --> 00:22:50.660
redundant. But if that's the case, you should be

461
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.479
able to say he work, she work, or it

462
00:22:52.479 --> 00:22:55.500
work. These would be fine. They're equally informative as

463
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.900
I work, they work, you work, etc. There's no

464
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.609
reason that should be the case. So here you

465
00:23:00.609 --> 00:23:02.810
want to say that the syntax is driving the

466
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:06.939
morphology, that you've chosen your subject first. You say,

467
00:23:06.969 --> 00:23:09.479
I want to talk about myself, I say I,

468
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:14.359
and then I choose the, the best fitting form

469
00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:17.369
of the verb for that context. And English has

470
00:23:17.369 --> 00:23:20.449
a poor range of choices. Portuguese has more. Into

471
00:23:20.449 --> 00:23:22.969
has more, lots of languages have more. English is

472
00:23:22.969 --> 00:23:25.209
very poor. I've got two choices, S or nothing.

473
00:23:25.609 --> 00:23:27.750
And S is the best choice for a third

474
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.699
person singular. And if I'm not 3 person singular,

475
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.219
I don't choose S. So that there, the information

476
00:23:34.219 --> 00:23:36.339
seems to work the other way. First you determine

477
00:23:36.339 --> 00:23:39.260
the syntactic context, and then you choose the form

478
00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:44.349
that best fits that context. And so, um. We

479
00:23:44.349 --> 00:23:47.189
have evidence here that's pulling us in two different

480
00:23:47.189 --> 00:23:49.750
directions as to whether morphology drives syntax, and a

481
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.250
lot of the work that's done today is to

482
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.670
ask, can we go back to the evidence that

483
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:58.969
looks like it goes one way and rethink it,

484
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.989
reanalyze it so that it, everything really goes in

485
00:24:01.989 --> 00:24:06.130
one direction, a simpler theory maybe. Um, I think

486
00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.410
that's true. I think we can get a lot

487
00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.290
of work done by saying that that morphology never

488
00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.739
drives syntax, that it always works the way it

489
00:24:12.739 --> 00:24:15.410
works, works, that it's always the way that you

490
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.839
have that you determine the syntax first, somewhat abstractly,

491
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:22.130
and then you determine the morphological form relative to

492
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.969
that syntax. Um, BUT it's a harder, more abstract

493
00:24:25.969 --> 00:24:26.880
argument to make.

494
00:24:27.939 --> 00:24:32.260
But in this particular case, really understanding and coming

495
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.020
to a conclusion when it comes to this debate

496
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:39.130
as to whether morphology drives syntax or the other

497
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:44.709
way around. Would this have broader implications as to

498
00:24:44.709 --> 00:24:50.109
how we understand the cognition behind language? I mean,

499
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:55.550
would this basically have ramifications to other aspects of

500
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:59.125
how we process language or is it restrict To,

501
00:24:59.155 --> 00:25:03.604
to the question itself regarding morphology and

502
00:25:03.604 --> 00:25:06.265
so it would, but every, every time we go

503
00:25:06.265 --> 00:25:08.204
up a level, and I'm sure this is true

504
00:25:08.204 --> 00:25:09.685
with other people you talk to in other fields,

505
00:25:09.765 --> 00:25:11.675
every time you go up a level of abstraction,

506
00:25:11.724 --> 00:25:14.084
the, the, the questions become more abstract and it's

507
00:25:14.084 --> 00:25:16.685
harder to make a compelling argument one way or

508
00:25:16.685 --> 00:25:20.160
another. But the, the works case, the works versus

509
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.359
work case, this is an example of we describe

510
00:25:23.359 --> 00:25:25.560
it, it's described in many, many terms by different

511
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.349
people, but it's competition. You think about language as,

512
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.280
as, um, uh, I said choosing the best form,

513
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.560
here's our superlative again, choosing the best form for

514
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.640
the particular syntactic context. And there's a view out

515
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:43.550
there that this is a fundamental property of language

516
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.640
that all of it involves some level some notion

517
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.079
of competition. This is clear in what's called pragmatics,

518
00:25:50.119 --> 00:25:53.599
it's clear in other kinds of realms. Um, LET

519
00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:58.839
me come back to another example. Um, I, uh,

520
00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.630
one of the things with number cross linguistically, as

521
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.550
I said, English has singular and plural. Some languages

522
00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.310
also have a dual, which marks exactly 2. So

523
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.099
there would be three forms of the word dog.

524
00:26:09.189 --> 00:26:14.069
Innuut works this way. Um, um, uh, WE talk

525
00:26:14.069 --> 00:26:16.709
about the Inuit language, the Inuit people, the Inuit

526
00:26:16.709 --> 00:26:19.109
is the plural, Inuk is the singular, and then

527
00:26:19.109 --> 00:26:21.910
there's another form, Inuk, which is when there's exactly

528
00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.760
2. Um, AND, uh, when we ask about these

529
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.319
languages, these are the all the major possibilities in

530
00:26:28.319 --> 00:26:30.689
the world's languages. Either you have a singular plural

531
00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:34.030
distinction or you have singular plural and dual. The

532
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.719
interesting thing is that in some cases the dual

533
00:26:36.719 --> 00:26:39.270
is restricted. You only have the dual at certain

534
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:43.760
times. The plural, when the plural is contrasted with

535
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.959
a dual, means 3 or more. If I have

536
00:26:46.959 --> 00:26:50.599
a dual form available and I use the plural

537
00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:54.239
form, Inuit, I mean, for example, 3 or more

538
00:26:54.239 --> 00:26:56.680
and not 2. So the plural there seems to

539
00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.640
mean something different than it does in English or

540
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.439
Portuguese. But if I have a dual, if I

541
00:27:01.439 --> 00:27:04.319
don't have the dual form available, then the plural

542
00:27:04.319 --> 00:27:06.319
just means more than one, that's sort of normal

543
00:27:06.319 --> 00:27:09.319
meaning of plural. So again, we think about this

544
00:27:09.319 --> 00:27:10.959
as a term uh as a a sense of

545
00:27:10.959 --> 00:27:13.719
competition. I've gone back into morphology, but we think

546
00:27:13.719 --> 00:27:16.439
about this in terms of competition. You look at

547
00:27:16.439 --> 00:27:20.400
the best form, the most informative form that's available

548
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.599
for the particular environment that you're looking at. And

549
00:27:23.599 --> 00:27:26.479
so it has to be a competition among competing

550
00:27:26.479 --> 00:27:29.030
forms. There's a theory that this is how language

551
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:32.189
works brought not just morphology, but generally when we

552
00:27:32.189 --> 00:27:35.430
say a sentence, we, we use the where there's

553
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.030
um competing kinds of uh constraints. I'm trying to

554
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.140
be lazy as a speaker and say the shortest

555
00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.150
thing, but I'm also trying to be as informative

556
00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:46.819
as possible to you, and I'm balancing these domains.

557
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:51.229
And so this kind of competition might deeply characterize

558
00:27:51.229 --> 00:27:54.390
all of language, the cognitive system that involves language.

559
00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.760
And so we, when we look at morphology, we're

560
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.959
looking at a piece of this system and asking,

561
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.520
do the, in particular on the technical aspect, do

562
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.709
the kinds of ways we need to, the kinds

563
00:28:05.709 --> 00:28:08.920
of assumptions we need to make about characterizing the

564
00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:14.244
cognitive system to understand the morphology, match up. With

565
00:28:14.244 --> 00:28:16.925
the kinds of ways people deal with competition in

566
00:28:16.925 --> 00:28:20.685
pragmatics or in syntax and semantics, etc. And this

567
00:28:20.685 --> 00:28:22.364
is an exciting area. I mean, I wish I

568
00:28:22.364 --> 00:28:23.844
could tell you, yes, the answer is yes, and

569
00:28:23.844 --> 00:28:26.084
we know this. Um, BUT, you know, then I

570
00:28:26.084 --> 00:28:27.525
could just hang up my hat and say, we've

571
00:28:27.525 --> 00:28:29.895
finished the, the field. There's a lot of open

572
00:28:29.895 --> 00:28:32.354
questions. I think there's all exciting reasons to think

573
00:28:32.354 --> 00:28:36.084
this is true. Um, BUT not everybody sees it

574
00:28:36.084 --> 00:28:37.645
that way. And so there's work still to be

575
00:28:37.645 --> 00:28:37.925
done.

576
00:28:38.569 --> 00:28:40.810
No, this is the, I guess, the beauty of

577
00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:44.689
science. It's an ongoing enterprise and it's also fascinating

578
00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:49.369
to notice over time how knowledge changes and evolves.

579
00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:54.229
So, but let's get then into human universal specifically

580
00:28:54.229 --> 00:28:58.469
in language. So, what do you make of universal

581
00:28:58.469 --> 00:29:04.064
grammar and the Work by Noam Chomsky earlier, you

582
00:29:04.064 --> 00:29:08.505
suggested that you're not very much into, uh, blank

583
00:29:08.505 --> 00:29:13.635
slightest approaches to, I guess, human cognition more broadly,

584
00:29:13.714 --> 00:29:18.035
but to language more specifically. But specifically about Noam

585
00:29:18.035 --> 00:29:21.435
Chomsky's work, because if I understand it correctly, even

586
00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:27.650
Uh, what universal grammar entails, uh, for he himself,

587
00:29:27.729 --> 00:29:30.420
it has changed over time

588
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:35.359
slightly, right? So, so. There's a lot of, uh,

589
00:29:35.369 --> 00:29:38.569
a lot of discussion of this, uh, peripheral discussion,

590
00:29:38.609 --> 00:29:40.609
and I think there's a lot of, of, uh,

591
00:29:40.969 --> 00:29:44.770
uh, confusion about the terminology or, or different people

592
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:47.170
that are talking it somewhat cross purposes because they're

593
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:51.239
using the terminology in different ways. Um, THE, the,

594
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.810
the, the initial proposal and I think the part

595
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.609
that has, has remained unchanged in this, and I

596
00:29:57.609 --> 00:30:00.140
think that the part of it, it. It should

597
00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.969
almost be uncontroversial, is this sort of polar opposition

598
00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:06.209
between the blank slate and not the blank slate.

599
00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.699
So, uh, put a pin in the notion of

600
00:30:09.699 --> 00:30:12.979
universal grammar just for a moment. What we say

601
00:30:12.979 --> 00:30:17.400
is, um, why is it that children, uh, uh,

602
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.250
learn languages quickly, they learn a lot of properties

603
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:23.729
without, uh, explicit instruction, and they converge on the

604
00:30:23.729 --> 00:30:25.969
same answers or the same structures or the same

605
00:30:25.969 --> 00:30:30.319
patterns in language after language after language, sometimes universal

606
00:30:30.319 --> 00:30:33.349
to the extent that we know. Um, AND Chomsky's

607
00:30:33.349 --> 00:30:38.030
answer was, if they are just reacting to the

608
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.969
environment, this was the behaviorist idea as a blank

609
00:30:40.969 --> 00:30:43.630
slate, this would be a surprising fact, a surprising

610
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:47.369
outcome. Um, AND he suggested that there are, um,

611
00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:53.020
universal cognitive constraints, inherent biases that shape the way

612
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.420
children are going to interact with the data in

613
00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:59.569
the world around them. We know such biases exist

614
00:30:59.569 --> 00:31:01.619
independently. I'm sure you've talked to people in other

615
00:31:01.619 --> 00:31:04.660
fields. Um, THE easy one to appreciate is that

616
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.430
newborn babies. Fixate on two circles and a line.

617
00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.229
If you put that pattern on the wall the

618
00:31:10.229 --> 00:31:12.310
day they're born, they look at that. So they're

619
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:16.880
they're somehow preprogrammed to look for faces. It's probably

620
00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.589
not the case that they, you know, they are

621
00:31:18.589 --> 00:31:23.250
looking for faces, but there's some inherent hardwired bias,

622
00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.640
uh, that affects their visual and attention system that

623
00:31:26.849 --> 00:31:29.150
chooses the way the massive amount of data that's

624
00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:33.040
coming towards them is filtered. And Chomsky's proposal was

625
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.430
that there are such filters for language, and this

626
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:39.599
is universal grammar. Universal grammar is not that we

627
00:31:39.599 --> 00:31:41.920
all share the same rule for making plurals that

628
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.520
we all share um the the like you pick

629
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.000
up a grammar book and it says, you know,

630
00:31:46.079 --> 00:31:48.000
you write the subject before the verb, none of

631
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.400
that is universal. The universal grammar refers to these

632
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.829
filters or these biases. Um, AND that's at that

633
00:31:55.829 --> 00:31:57.780
level that, that seems to be right, that just

634
00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.750
seems to be right. The debates now, and this

635
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:04.189
is where, um, where you might say that Chomsky's

636
00:32:04.189 --> 00:32:06.790
thinking about this over time has changed, is what

637
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.069
is the content of those biases, what are the

638
00:32:09.069 --> 00:32:11.930
form. And that there's two ways of thinking about

639
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.010
this, and you may have heard these terms before.

640
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.060
One is it, um, is it domain specific or

641
00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:22.140
domain general? So are our biases specific to language?

642
00:32:22.219 --> 00:32:24.420
Are the pieces that are hardwired, the constraints that

643
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.209
make us approach the data in a particular way,

644
00:32:27.459 --> 00:32:31.260
are those specific to language, or are they general

645
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.060
cognitive properties? So I gave you an argument. My

646
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:39.814
view would say. Universal grammar, our inherent cognitive capacities,

647
00:32:40.185 --> 00:32:42.744
tells us that the only way to make a

648
00:32:42.744 --> 00:32:46.545
true superlative is one that contains the comparative. You

649
00:32:46.545 --> 00:32:49.175
can only build the meaning more x than all

650
00:32:49.175 --> 00:32:52.415
others if you can build the meaning more X.

651
00:32:52.645 --> 00:32:55.704
So if our, our brains manipulate or our minds

652
00:32:55.704 --> 00:32:59.564
manipulate symbolic representations, this is a constraint on possible

653
00:32:59.564 --> 00:33:03.670
symbolic representations. That's cool, right? Um, AND so I

654
00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:05.619
would see that as a part of universal grammar,

655
00:33:05.709 --> 00:33:07.989
we're constrained to approach the data that way, and

656
00:33:07.989 --> 00:33:11.550
that's consistent with sort of Chomsky's view. But what

657
00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:14.709
I don't know is whether the source of that

658
00:33:14.709 --> 00:33:19.630
constraint is about linguistic symbolic representations, or about symbolic

659
00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:23.949
representations in the brain generally, including non-linguistic representations. And

660
00:33:23.949 --> 00:33:26.989
that's a hard, hard, hard thing to do, to

661
00:33:26.989 --> 00:33:31.420
try to figure out, right? Um, THE counting universal

662
00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.380
as well, right? So I said there are 3

663
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.380
possibilities. Languages have no marking of number. You have

664
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:40.380
marking of singular plural distinctions on nouns like in

665
00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.300
English after a number, or just in general when

666
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.780
you're talking about plurals, or you do it when

667
00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.819
you're just talking about plurals, but Turkish like, not

668
00:33:48.819 --> 00:33:52.060
after the noun. It's not just about redundancy. If

669
00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.180
it was just about redundancy, English would be just

670
00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.390
like Turkish, 2 dog would be totally fine. Um,

671
00:33:57.459 --> 00:33:59.209
AND so we ask about the nature of the

672
00:33:59.209 --> 00:34:02.819
symbolic system. Um, AND so you, you then you

673
00:34:02.819 --> 00:34:07.260
want to ask, how fine-grained is universal grammar in

674
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:13.659
this system? How fine-grained are the predetermined constraints on

675
00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:17.020
the cognitive system that yield these patterns as the

676
00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.899
output? What are the contributions that come from outside

677
00:34:19.899 --> 00:34:23.790
of language, general psychology, general cognition, and what are

678
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:27.530
the constraints that come from a language system? And

679
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:31.570
certainly over time, uh, Chomsky's view and other people's

680
00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:36.010
view on both the, the content, what is language

681
00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.810
specific and what is more domain general, and what

682
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.879
is the form of the specific restrictions has changed.

683
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.899
Early work had a lot richer universal grammar in

684
00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:49.208
terms of its content of the actual specific formulation.

685
00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.520
And the thinking has changed that that it's actually,

686
00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.708
it may have less that is specific to language,

687
00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:58.530
but that comes from general systems and has specific

688
00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:03.050
instantiations in language. Um, AND I, you know, this

689
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:04.979
is what I spent my day looking at and,

690
00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:11.729
and, uh, I, I don't see evidence against at

691
00:35:11.729 --> 00:35:15.370
the broad level, the view that there are hardwired

692
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:18.169
constraints that surface in the way children learn and

693
00:35:18.169 --> 00:35:20.370
in the way we see these patterns cross linguistically

694
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.729
as universals. I'm happy to fight with people about

695
00:35:23.729 --> 00:35:26.159
the narrow details, but at the broad level that

696
00:35:26.169 --> 00:35:29.389
that seems to be right. OK,

697
00:35:29.469 --> 00:35:32.540
but at this point then, if I were to

698
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.070
ask you, what do you know, what do we

699
00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:39.669
know about human universals in language? What can we

700
00:35:39.669 --> 00:35:43.070
say about that? I mean, what are the universals

701
00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.149
that we can point

702
00:35:44.149 --> 00:35:48.250
to? Yeah, so there's actually, uh, there's quite a

703
00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:54.300
few, and there's um I uh I. There's quite

704
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.300
a few, a few, quite a few at the

705
00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.379
level of description. I can give you a whole

706
00:35:58.379 --> 00:36:00.979
bunch. Most of them are, and so this is

707
00:36:00.979 --> 00:36:04.820
actually another interesting point, um, of terminology. There's, there's

708
00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.479
many different kinds of universals and people use this

709
00:36:07.479 --> 00:36:12.620
in different, uh different uh ways. Um, MOST in

710
00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.639
morphology, most people using the term universal mean it

711
00:36:15.639 --> 00:36:19.139
in what we call an implicational universal. It does

712
00:36:19.139 --> 00:36:23.354
not mean that all languages have. Some particular property,

713
00:36:23.524 --> 00:36:26.245
but rather statements of the form. If a language

714
00:36:26.245 --> 00:36:29.445
has this property, then it has that property. So

715
00:36:29.445 --> 00:36:33.324
for example, if a language has a dual number

716
00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:36.915
form, a form that marks two elements like dog

717
00:36:36.925 --> 00:36:38.685
dogs, we don't in English, we only have singular

718
00:36:38.685 --> 00:36:42.084
plural. If a language marks a distinction between dual

719
00:36:42.084 --> 00:36:45.635
and non-dual, it also marks a distinction between plural

720
00:36:45.635 --> 00:36:48.594
and non-plural, 3 and above, and that's that was

721
00:36:48.594 --> 00:36:53.100
first observed. 50, 60, 70 years ago, and of

722
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:56.219
course, you know, scientists are an ordinary bunch. Anytime

723
00:36:56.219 --> 00:36:58.860
someone proposes a universal, a whole bunch of young

724
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.340
energetic people try to show that it's wrong, and

725
00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.020
they point to various examples and we look at

726
00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:05.060
them more closely, and it isn't wrong. It's right,

727
00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:09.149
it's true, right? So there's um Uh, there is

728
00:37:09.149 --> 00:37:12.310
somebody, uh, Hans Planck in Germany who keeps, uh,

729
00:37:12.389 --> 00:37:16.149
uh, an archive of, of proposed universals with notes

730
00:37:16.149 --> 00:37:20.409
on their various kinds of, um, counter alleged counterexamples,

731
00:37:20.469 --> 00:37:23.510
etc. There are a lot in morphology, there are

732
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:27.149
a lot of these kinds of universals, implicational universals.

733
00:37:27.189 --> 00:37:30.629
There are things we know, um. There are a

734
00:37:30.629 --> 00:37:33.469
lot more proposed universals, some of which are proposed

735
00:37:33.469 --> 00:37:35.909
over smaller samples, and we don't know yet whether

736
00:37:35.909 --> 00:37:38.070
they're right, but there are a lot of universals

737
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.870
of this sort, um, and I could, you know,

738
00:37:40.949 --> 00:37:42.639
I could give you lists. I've alluded to a

739
00:37:42.639 --> 00:37:45.469
few others already with like the, the no good

740
00:37:45.469 --> 00:37:51.510
better goodness type universal um prenominal systems, systems of

741
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.750
I, me, you, he, she, it, then. There are

742
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:59.139
really at a fundamental level in terms of person

743
00:37:59.139 --> 00:38:03.270
marking, first person, second person, etc. There are really

744
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:06.550
fundamentally only two systems that languages have. There are

745
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.830
only 2, and everything else is a variation on

746
00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:11.389
one of those two systems. And the two systems

747
00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:13.909
are the English style or Portuguese or European style

748
00:38:13.909 --> 00:38:16.350
system, where you have 1 person, 2nd person, and

749
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:20.270
third person. I am, you are, she is, right?

750
00:38:20.629 --> 00:38:23.439
And then there are languages that have that, plus,

751
00:38:23.449 --> 00:38:27.250
in addition, for the first person plural, we, they

752
00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:30.090
make a distinction that we call an inclusive versus

753
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:34.090
an exclusive we. So when I say we find

754
00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:38.129
this interesting, I'm actually ambiguous about whether I'm including

755
00:38:38.129 --> 00:38:40.610
you, right? I could mean me and the other

756
00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:42.850
linguists, or I could mean you and me because

757
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:45.300
we're talking about it. There are languages where you

758
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.489
have to specify, where you have to actually just

759
00:38:47.489 --> 00:38:50.290
make that distinction. But again, if our, if our

760
00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:54.370
persons are first person, me, second person, you, and

761
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.449
third person, the inclusive is built by combining the

762
00:38:57.449 --> 00:39:00.090
first and the second person semantically. It's, it takes

763
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:03.449
the same pieces and it combines them. There are

764
00:39:03.449 --> 00:39:09.409
sociologists, um. Irving Goffman was one such uh sociologist

765
00:39:09.659 --> 00:39:12.540
who worked on personal interaction. And so we talk

766
00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.739
in linguistics and I say you, right? I mean

767
00:39:14.739 --> 00:39:17.219
you, oh, what's the, what's the second person? And

768
00:39:17.219 --> 00:39:19.580
we can describe it as the addressee, the one

769
00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:22.090
I'm talking to, or the hearer or the interlocutor

770
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:24.659
in the various ways. He notes that there's a

771
00:39:24.659 --> 00:39:30.899
lot of different usages of language where these concepts

772
00:39:30.899 --> 00:39:33.580
break apart. So in theater we can talk about

773
00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.800
a stage whisper. I look at some other actor

774
00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.439
on stage, but I say something which is clearly

775
00:39:39.439 --> 00:39:42.000
for the benefit of the audience or vice versa,

776
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.280
think of all these kinds of things, but languages

777
00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.879
never make these distinctions, you know, special forms for

778
00:39:46.879 --> 00:39:50.030
any of this. So again, we have universals of

779
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:53.040
language. They're telling us something about the cognitive system,

780
00:39:53.189 --> 00:39:55.179
and there's lots and lots and lots of these,

781
00:39:55.389 --> 00:39:59.469
but we still don't quite know to what extent

782
00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:03.500
is the the understanding of these universals arises, uh,

783
00:40:03.629 --> 00:40:06.989
independent of language and is reflected in language. So,

784
00:40:07.189 --> 00:40:09.510
you know, in the universal of person, there's a

785
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:12.070
bunch of interesting ones about how first person works.

786
00:40:12.395 --> 00:40:15.084
Um, THIS may be because of what we call

787
00:40:15.084 --> 00:40:18.764
a theory of mind. Some children learn early on

788
00:40:18.764 --> 00:40:20.915
in their experience. They don't have a birth, but

789
00:40:20.915 --> 00:40:23.125
they get later, is a sense of self. They

790
00:40:23.125 --> 00:40:25.524
recognize that they exist and are distinct from the

791
00:40:25.524 --> 00:40:27.794
rest of the world. I recognize I exist, the

792
00:40:27.794 --> 00:40:30.554
ego of the self, or whatever, right? And language

793
00:40:30.554 --> 00:40:33.495
then reflects that and prioritizes expression of the first

794
00:40:33.495 --> 00:40:37.840
person, right, in interesting ways morphologically. So, so these

795
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.770
universals are out there, but if you're looking for

796
00:40:40.919 --> 00:40:44.280
universals of the form, all languages do this, no

797
00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.919
languages do that. Those are rarer and fewer and

798
00:40:47.919 --> 00:40:51.090
farther between. But, but like for first person, second

799
00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:54.199
person, third person, all languages have some way in

800
00:40:54.199 --> 00:40:56.239
which first person and second person play a role

801
00:40:56.239 --> 00:41:00.149
in their systems. And so, so. This has to

802
00:41:00.149 --> 00:41:03.760
come from somewhere. This is, these are robust, well

803
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:07.389
understood universals. Um, THERE is a lot of dissent,

804
00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:12.959
but much of the dissent. Some of the dissent

805
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.969
says, OK, we see variation in language, uh, it's

806
00:41:16.969 --> 00:41:20.169
a dissent about some technical details, some technical aspect

807
00:41:20.169 --> 00:41:23.270
about a particular formulation of a universal, or about

808
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.370
whether the universal is reflecting something that is domain

809
00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:29.129
specific to language as opposed to domain general. Those

810
00:41:29.129 --> 00:41:31.739
are harder questions to resolve.

811
00:41:32.159 --> 00:41:36.459
Mhm. And when it comes to morphology, specifically, which

812
00:41:36.459 --> 00:41:40.280
is the main theme of our conversation today, how

813
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:45.669
do you compare it across languages, which sometimes, uh,

814
00:41:45.679 --> 00:41:48.709
seem very different from one another?

815
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.459
Yep, uh, so on the day to day level,

816
00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.250
it's kind of hard. Um, BUT, uh, but with

817
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.560
some of the stuff we've talked about today, uh,

818
00:41:57.729 --> 00:42:01.199
involves comparison. So there's, there's various ways you can,

819
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:04.489
uh, compare, um, you can think about this in

820
00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:09.129
terms of pinning down the form and comparing, or

821
00:42:09.129 --> 00:42:11.000
you can think about this in terms of pinning

822
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.040
down the meaning, and then comparing the different ways

823
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.635
in which that meaning. Expressed. So plurality, this is,

824
00:42:17.715 --> 00:42:21.274
this you can compare across languages that, you know,

825
00:42:21.685 --> 00:42:23.965
we, we have a general universal sense of the

826
00:42:23.965 --> 00:42:25.564
number of objects. You have one object, you have

827
00:42:25.564 --> 00:42:27.284
more than one object, and then you can ask

828
00:42:27.284 --> 00:42:28.764
how do you, how do you express that in

829
00:42:28.764 --> 00:42:30.764
your language, and you can go and you can

830
00:42:30.764 --> 00:42:33.945
get a pretty good sense. People writing descriptive grammars,

831
00:42:34.044 --> 00:42:36.004
people go out and work with their community or

832
00:42:36.004 --> 00:42:38.439
from their own community. I hope there's more of

833
00:42:38.439 --> 00:42:42.520
that, that people from endangered languages and minority dialects

834
00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.959
will begin to describe their own languages and publish

835
00:42:44.959 --> 00:42:46.929
this. And when they do this, then we have

836
00:42:46.929 --> 00:42:48.570
these resources and we can go and we can

837
00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:53.010
look at that. And people use the same often

838
00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:57.100
similar frameworks for describing a language, partly because a

839
00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.449
lot of the cognitive concepts are very similar. So

840
00:42:59.449 --> 00:43:01.810
like number, you'll find a chapter on number in

841
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.250
any language that has a uh grammar of a

842
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:06.729
language that has a number representation, or you could

843
00:43:06.729 --> 00:43:08.570
go out in the field and do the experiments

844
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:10.810
yourself by putting like one or two objects in

845
00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:13.179
front of it. Um, AND then writing down the

846
00:43:13.179 --> 00:43:16.260
words and or recording the words and and listening

847
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.179
to them and segmenting them. So some stuff can

848
00:43:19.179 --> 00:43:24.179
be done fairly easily, uh, cross linguistically, um, the,

849
00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:27.260
the differences we see tend to be differences in

850
00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:31.739
form more than differences in the fundamental concepts. And

851
00:43:31.739 --> 00:43:33.699
so when you pin the concept down, you can

852
00:43:33.699 --> 00:43:36.530
then just begin to compare the forms cross linguistically.

853
00:43:36.899 --> 00:43:39.860
Um, YOU, uh, going the other way with with

854
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:44.770
form. Um, uh, THERE are interesting questions you can

855
00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:47.979
ask about, uh, prefixes and suffixes, so you can,

856
00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:50.909
you can gender identify a content word, a verb

857
00:43:50.909 --> 00:43:53.229
or a noun, and then you can look at

858
00:43:53.229 --> 00:43:54.709
the pieces that are attached to it and say,

859
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.110
are they attached on the left or on the

860
00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:58.939
right. I gave the example unlockable at the beginning

861
00:43:58.939 --> 00:44:01.229
of our discussion that has a prefix and a

862
00:44:01.229 --> 00:44:03.030
suffix piece that comes in front, and the piece

863
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:05.040
that comes at the back. There's a lot of

864
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.449
interesting facts about languages tend to be more suffixing

865
00:44:08.449 --> 00:44:11.169
than they are prefixing. All languages regardless of their

866
00:44:11.169 --> 00:44:15.250
basic word order. This not all languages. Overall, the

867
00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:19.270
vast majority of morphology is suffixing rather than prefixing,

868
00:44:19.679 --> 00:44:21.939
regardless of the word order of the language, whether

869
00:44:21.939 --> 00:44:24.725
verbs come before objects or objects come before. THAT'S

870
00:44:24.725 --> 00:44:27.344
an interesting fact. But then you could say I

871
00:44:27.344 --> 00:44:29.375
could do a form-based comparison. I could look at

872
00:44:29.375 --> 00:44:33.225
all of the prefixes in a variety of languages

873
00:44:33.455 --> 00:44:38.014
and ask, do I have universal patterns in the

874
00:44:38.014 --> 00:44:41.735
meanings they do and don't represent negation always prefixel,

875
00:44:41.774 --> 00:44:45.300
is negation always suffixel, etc. So you can, you

876
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.939
can, despite the surface variation, when you break it

877
00:44:48.939 --> 00:44:52.620
down into a more abstract symbolic representation and talk

878
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.060
about the root word and the prefix and the

879
00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.120
suffix and the order of the suffixes, you can

880
00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.409
ask, uh, and then characterize these not in terms

881
00:45:01.409 --> 00:45:03.729
of, you know, whether it's a ze or a

882
00:45:03.729 --> 00:45:06.459
or or a ah, but in terms of what

883
00:45:06.459 --> 00:45:09.149
it represents in terms of meaning or function, you

884
00:45:09.149 --> 00:45:11.239
can get a system that's that's much more directly

885
00:45:11.239 --> 00:45:11.860
comparable.

886
00:45:12.719 --> 00:45:17.719
Mhm. So I have one final question then, and

887
00:45:17.719 --> 00:45:22.310
again, regarding how we think about human universals in

888
00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:25.560
language, at least to a certain extent. So, Uh,

889
00:45:25.679 --> 00:45:27.800
I, I want to ask you this because I've

890
00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.350
already actually posed more or less the same question

891
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:35.040
to several other linguists, and I'm curious about your

892
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:39.850
take on it. So, let's say that uh universal

893
00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:44.469
grammar or some form of universal grammar is correct.

894
00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.679
And there are aspects of our cognition that is

895
00:45:47.679 --> 00:45:52.760
associated with language that we share as humans across

896
00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:57.639
all cultures, all societies. If that is correct, uh,

897
00:45:57.649 --> 00:46:01.649
then, uh, I mean, should we expect it to

898
00:46:01.649 --> 00:46:06.459
be. Uh, DOMAIN specific, that is the cognition associated

899
00:46:06.459 --> 00:46:11.300
with language is specialized for the processing of language

900
00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:15.179
or for it to be domain general and language

901
00:46:15.179 --> 00:46:18.419
being something that simply, if you want to take

902
00:46:18.419 --> 00:46:21.939
an evolutionary approach on this, of course, simply piggyback

903
00:46:22.219 --> 00:46:26.689
on uh parts of our cognitive system that evolved

904
00:46:26.689 --> 00:46:29.479
for other purposes, primarily.

905
00:46:29.699 --> 00:46:33.860
So, so, um Let me react to the way

906
00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.820
you phrased this one particular word you asked about,

907
00:46:36.899 --> 00:46:39.500
should we expect it to be one way or

908
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.179
another. And I guess the question is in light

909
00:46:42.179 --> 00:46:47.219
of what would we have expectations. Um, MY own,

910
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.550
maybe this is my own personal history of this,

911
00:46:49.699 --> 00:46:54.060
but the, the, um, uh, a priori with no,

912
00:46:54.179 --> 00:46:57.540
with no other um uh assumptions, no other beliefs,

913
00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.409
and no other study about it. I would expect

914
00:47:00.409 --> 00:47:02.520
that everything is domain general. I would say, you

915
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.919
know, why, why would there be a domain specific

916
00:47:05.919 --> 00:47:09.560
part of, of ultimately the brain somehow encoded in

917
00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.520
the brain that makes us filter the world in

918
00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.600
a particular way. But the same thing I think

919
00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.120
would be true of vision. Why would babies fixate

920
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.919
on a face on uh two dots in a

921
00:47:20.919 --> 00:47:25.080
line? Once we discover that that's true, it is

922
00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.544
true. Right? There must be so there is some

923
00:47:27.544 --> 00:47:30.665
domain specific fixation module that tells you to look

924
00:47:30.665 --> 00:47:32.625
for faces, right? And then you can sort of

925
00:47:32.625 --> 00:47:35.024
ask in evolutionary terms why that exists and people

926
00:47:35.024 --> 00:47:36.544
give stories about it, and I think it has

927
00:47:36.544 --> 00:47:38.425
to do with, you know, making sure you don't

928
00:47:38.425 --> 00:47:39.965
get left alone in the jungle and this kind

929
00:47:39.965 --> 00:47:43.989
of stuff. Um, THE, um, uh, so you could

930
00:47:43.989 --> 00:47:46.030
ask them about language, right? We could, we could

931
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:50.750
recast this, uh, a priori, just coming to the

932
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:53.429
topic from the beginning, why would it be the

933
00:47:53.429 --> 00:47:56.219
case that there would be any domain specific, um,

934
00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:00.310
uh, universals, but there appeared to be domain specific

935
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:03.550
universals. So again, for the, for the notion of

936
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:07.540
person. There are culturally relevant distinctions that are never

937
00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:11.020
made monomorphemically, where there's just a single morpheme that

938
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:14.500
makes that meaning. Um, THE inventory of meanings that

939
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.169
we make in person, author of the speech act,

940
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.110
addressee of the Speech Act, and other, right? Uh,

941
00:48:20.639 --> 00:48:22.419
AND then the inclusive that combines the two, and

942
00:48:22.419 --> 00:48:26.020
that's it. Those are the only possibilities. Um, THAT

943
00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.290
seems to be domain specific in the sense that

944
00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:31.649
culturally and consciously, we can certainly make and manipulate

945
00:48:31.649 --> 00:48:34.919
and use other distinctions. So it's not coming. In

946
00:48:34.919 --> 00:48:38.320
any obvious way from culture, that these are the

947
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:41.719
uh the the the categories that language is gonna

948
00:48:41.719 --> 00:48:44.310
have, but these are the categories that language has.

949
00:48:44.679 --> 00:48:46.760
So then we can ask, you know, we rephrase

950
00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:49.639
your question rather than saying what would I expect

951
00:48:49.639 --> 00:48:51.639
out of the blue to be the state of

952
00:48:51.639 --> 00:48:56.760
affairs, more interesting question is, how representative is that

953
00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.560
example compared to all of the other examples. Look

954
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.489
at the other examples and ask about them, uh,

955
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.975
how How much are they telling us something domain

956
00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:07.614
specific or domain general? And that's hard and requires

957
00:49:07.614 --> 00:49:10.455
collaboration of people. I'm going this evening to a

958
00:49:10.455 --> 00:49:14.524
panel on collaboration among psychologists, computationalists, and linguists, right?

959
00:49:14.695 --> 00:49:16.205
How do we get to this stuff? I can't

960
00:49:16.205 --> 00:49:18.695
know all of the pieces outside of language. How

961
00:49:18.695 --> 00:49:20.135
do we, how do we get to figure out

962
00:49:20.135 --> 00:49:24.415
these questions? Even there, when we say it's domain

963
00:49:24.415 --> 00:49:26.614
general, and this goes back to the question about

964
00:49:26.614 --> 00:49:29.094
the evolution of the thinking of the representation of

965
00:49:29.094 --> 00:49:33.030
universal grammar. It is, it is fundamentally clear that

966
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:36.149
languages person systems are built on these categories and

967
00:49:36.149 --> 00:49:39.949
that that this is not specifically domain general, that

968
00:49:39.949 --> 00:49:43.790
it's these categories, but what is domain specific? Is

969
00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:47.629
it these categories with this interpretation that we are

970
00:49:47.629 --> 00:49:50.500
forced to do, or Is it something that says,

971
00:49:50.699 --> 00:49:53.699
given the way psychology works and theory of mind

972
00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:59.350
works, etc. THERE is a domain specific categorization function

973
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:03.540
that constrains the way linguistic categories are built out

974
00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.659
of the primitives that are fed to it from

975
00:50:05.659 --> 00:50:09.110
a domain external system. I had no idea, um,

976
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.479
but I think it's a really, really fundamentally interesting

977
00:50:12.479 --> 00:50:15.899
question. Um, uh, BUT it's a slightly different question

978
00:50:15.899 --> 00:50:19.090
than the one about expectations. It's about, given the

979
00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:20.580
evidence that we have, what do we make of

980
00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.540
this evidence, and what is it telling us about

981
00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.939
how the, uh, how the ultimately how the cognitive

982
00:50:25.939 --> 00:50:26.820
system works.

983
00:50:28.219 --> 00:50:31.909
Great. So, Doctor Bobali, just before we go, would

984
00:50:31.909 --> 00:50:34.429
you like to tell people where they can find

985
00:50:34.429 --> 00:50:36.600
you and your work on the internet?

986
00:50:37.149 --> 00:50:40.429
Oh, cool. OK, sure. So, so uh my last

987
00:50:40.429 --> 00:50:42.270
name, which I guess you'll see somewhere in a

988
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:44.149
link or something, B O B A L J

989
00:50:44.149 --> 00:50:47.030
I K Silent J uh dot com is a

990
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:49.629
is a a link that points to my Harvard

991
00:50:49.629 --> 00:50:51.739
web page and you can find my work there,

992
00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:55.600
um. Uh, I, yeah, uh, you'll find links to

993
00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.280
my work there, um, uh, a lot of the

994
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.020
work that you'll find there is more specific, um,

995
00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:03.600
than these kinds of questions. Uh, I think there

996
00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.679
are other authors who actually write, uh, very engagingly

997
00:51:06.679 --> 00:51:08.879
about these kinds of questions that I would suggest,

998
00:51:08.949 --> 00:51:11.149
uh, you know, could plug a couple of people.

999
00:51:11.239 --> 00:51:13.000
David Adger just wrote a book that came out

1000
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.870
last year. I don't know if you've interviewed him,

1001
00:51:14.959 --> 00:51:18.989
uh, I think it's called Language Unlimited, um. Uh,

1002
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.750
THAT'S a more, more of a discussion for people

1003
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:23.590
who are interested, not in the technical details of

1004
00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:26.340
linguistics. Uh, IT'S a great discussion of some new,

1005
00:51:26.399 --> 00:51:30.510
um, uh, higher level questions accessible. Uh, BUT sure,

1006
00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:32.350
if people want uh my work and I'm happy

1007
00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:35.729
to hear feedback, um, uh, my website, the Harvard

1008
00:51:35.729 --> 00:51:36.500
website's good.

1009
00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.709
Right, so I'm leaving the link in the description

1010
00:51:39.709 --> 00:51:42.870
box of the interview and Doctor Bobalik, thank you

1011
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:44.770
so much again for taking the time to come

1012
00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:46.750
on the show. It's been a real pleasure to

1013
00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:47.189
talk to you.

1014
00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:49.439
Thank you, thank you very much for having me.

1015
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.590
This has been a lot of fun.

1016
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:54.350
Hi guys, thank you for watching this interview until

1017
00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:56.489
