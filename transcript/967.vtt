00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:02.819
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:05.570
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Loops. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:08.710
joined by Doctor Channa Prakash. He is the Dean

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.819
of the College of Arts and Sciences at Tuskegee

5
00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.909
University. His research expertise is on genetic improvement of

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.829
food crops that are of importance to developing countries

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.020
and training of scientists and students in plant biotechnology.

8
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.469
Dr Prakash has also been actively involved in announcing

9
00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:32.950
the societal awareness of food biotechnology issues around the

10
00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:36.819
world. And today we're talking about gene editing techniques

11
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.580
in plants, GMO s more generally organic agriculture and

12
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.720
some of the behavior of activists in regards to

13
00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:49.150
environmentalism and agriculture, more specifically. So, Doctor Prakash, welcome

14
00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.830
to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

15
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.099
Thank you very much Ricardo. I'm honored to be

16
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.490
here.

17
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.740
So let's start with your work on gene editing

18
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.409
techniques in L. So tell us a little bit

19
00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:04.989
about what you do there and perhaps for the

20
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.699
audience to start with, mm perhaps many people are

21
00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:13.489
not familiar with what gene editing actually is. So

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.930
perhaps please start there and tell uh explain a

23
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.199
little bit what these techniques are really about.

24
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.080
Uh Thank you. So much. Um MANY of you,

25
00:01:24.089 --> 00:01:26.800
your audience around the world, especially in Europe are

26
00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:30.639
very familiar with uh GMO S or genetically modified

27
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.120
organisms. It's a very controversial topic. Uh Many genetically

28
00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:38.209
modified crops are by and large are not allowed

29
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.889
to be grown by European farmers. Although Europe imports

30
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.650
a lot of genetically modified foods stuff, especially for

31
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.750
the livestock feed. But nevertheless, there is a new

32
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.250
uh and better, more precise technique that has come

33
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.480
about in the last few years and that is

34
00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:59.169
called gene editing. The difference between GMO and gene

35
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.209
editing is very simple GMO. S involve introduction of

36
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.199
foreign genes into an organism. So when you take

37
00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.750
say a gene from potato and put it into

38
00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:15.029
tomato, that's a GMO. But gene editing is essentially

39
00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.710
changing the few letters in the alphabet of the

40
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.449
DNA of within the organism without necessarily introducing foreign

41
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.190
genes that is genome editing or gene editing. Uh

42
00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:32.399
It's a very revolutionary new technique called CRISPR cr

43
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.570
ISP R that was invented uh co invented by

44
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.509
a scientist from Europe and a scientist from the

45
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.119
United States. They both uh uh women who've got

46
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.380
the Nobel Prize uh three years ago for the

47
00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:51.229
invention is radically transforming the whole area of genetic

48
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.949
alteration, especially in the biomedical area. And that involves

49
00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.410
gene editing CRISPR uh the way to SSA a

50
00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:03.029
good analogy to say that is like if you're

51
00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.449
typing something on your phone and does the auto

52
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.699
correction and correct your spelling mistakes. And that's what

53
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.490
we do with gene editing to make correct some

54
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.580
of the spelling mistakes in the DNA and, and

55
00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:21.770
by doing so, we could introduce subtle but significant

56
00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:23.740
changes in the crop plants.

57
00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.960
Mhm. But when it comes to the results we

58
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.250
can get, uh, are there big differences between using

59
00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:37.509
more conventional, um, techniques that we use with genetically

60
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.259
modified organisms? And on the other hand, using gene,

61
00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:44.975
because I know and we're going to get into

62
00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:47.184
that in a bit that there's many myths and

63
00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:51.535
misconceptions surrounding GMO S and that's probably where most

64
00:03:51.544 --> 00:03:54.725
of the controversy stems from, right? But in this

65
00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:58.595
particular case, since people, even though they might be

66
00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:03.744
mistaken or misled, uh have these ideas surrounding GMO

67
00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:06.764
S, do you think that perhaps they shouldn't be

68
00:04:06.774 --> 00:04:10.184
as worried when it comes to gene editing techniques

69
00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:10.645
or?

70
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.639
Right. You know, as far as science is concerned,

71
00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.149
we there is we have been growing GMO S

72
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.019
for the past 30 years and we have not

73
00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.720
had a single instance of harm to the human

74
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.760
health or the livestock health or even an environmental

75
00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:28.440
mishap. We have not had that. But nevertheless, it

76
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.260
remains controversial primarily because the perception that we are

77
00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:37.130
putting something foreign into your food and also because

78
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.019
of uh orchestrated opposition to this technology. And uh

79
00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:45.380
so the consumer's mind uh especially in Europe has,

80
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.179
has really been uh very much opposed to the

81
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.100
concept of GMO S. But on the other hand,

82
00:04:52.109 --> 00:04:55.420
gene editing is not much different from what we

83
00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:59.200
have been doing uh in changing our crop plants

84
00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:03.519
or even livestock for hundreds or even thousands of

85
00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:06.440
years. You see every crop plant that you grow

86
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.880
today around the world, including everything that you grow

87
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.679
there in Europe. All those crops have been altered

88
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.359
over 10,000 years when we started uh experimenting with

89
00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:23.739
agriculture. You see, we, we started growing um food

90
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.540
plants by exper by essentially growing wild crops. And

91
00:05:27.549 --> 00:05:29.359
a lot of those wild crops were unfit for

92
00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:33.309
agriculture and we started selecting those that could be

93
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.790
grown with less toxins and they don't shatter and

94
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.660
that are easier to cook and things like that.

95
00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.820
And so over a period of time, all our

96
00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:47.450
crop plants have been radically altered to suit the

97
00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:50.850
way that could be conveniently grown, conveniently cooked and

98
00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:54.299
they are nutritious. They are uh uh not uh

99
00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:56.989
don't have toxins in the food things of that

100
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.250
nature. And the last 100 years, we have done

101
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.109
that in more scientific manner using uh hybridization, using

102
00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:07.649
the principles of genetics. And one of the most

103
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.040
important tools that we have used is called muto

104
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.209
genesis. We have literally, we have taken the seeds

105
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.089
and expose them to radiation exo expose them to

106
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.950
chemicals to bring both changes of mutations. If there

107
00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:23.850
is no particular trait in the crop. J plasm,

108
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.950
we introduce that artificially. And so people farmers and

109
00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:32.970
scientists have been bringing about changes in your food,

110
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.519
crops and livestock for a long time. And this

111
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.399
gene editing represents one of the most newer techniques,

112
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.790
the one that is more precise, one that is

113
00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:47.070
knowledge driven and for one for which we have

114
00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:51.170
much greater understanding and we recognize it's far more

115
00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:54.450
superior and safer than any of the other techniques

116
00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:57.049
that we have used in making those changes. And

117
00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:59.559
why do we need to be messing with our

118
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.410
food? Why do we need gene editing is an

119
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.885
important question and it is because we still need

120
00:07:04.894 --> 00:07:07.695
to feed, you know, eight or 9 billion people.

121
00:07:07.815 --> 00:07:10.524
And there's a lot of uh challenges to agriculture,

122
00:07:10.535 --> 00:07:14.225
especially with the global climate change. And we need

123
00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:17.304
all the tools in our toolbox and gene editing

124
00:07:17.315 --> 00:07:21.315
represents one of the, the most important and powerful

125
00:07:21.325 --> 00:07:22.415
tools that we have.

126
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.600
And so what would you say are the main

127
00:07:25.609 --> 00:07:30.410
goals of using gene editing in plants specifically? Are

128
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.179
you trying to alter or improve certain specific traits?

129
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.989
And in what context, what circumstances? Exactly.

130
00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:43.790
Yes. Uh GENE editing because it involves fine changes

131
00:07:43.799 --> 00:07:47.059
of just few nucleotides in the DNA is best

132
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:52.109
suited for changing uh simple traits, traits like uh

133
00:07:52.119 --> 00:07:56.000
making our plants more resistant to diseases, for instance,

134
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.420
like for ins uh just now a British scientist

135
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.700
uh have uh introduced uh tomatoes that are purple

136
00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:06.299
in color, they almost look like blueberries. And uh

137
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:09.519
and this is now for the first time in

138
00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:12.980
the United States here, uh we as home gardeners

139
00:08:12.989 --> 00:08:15.579
can go buy those tomato seeds and grow those

140
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:18.440
tomato uh in our backyard. Why do we want

141
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:23.320
purple tomatoes? Those purple tomatoes? Apparently they introduced the

142
00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:26.769
gene from the an edible snap dragon, the snap

143
00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:29.290
dragon flowers that you may be familiar with, that

144
00:08:29.299 --> 00:08:33.289
are very blue color flowers. And they've introduced that

145
00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:37.820
into tomato because they have very high uh healthy

146
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:42.070
compounds called an anthocyanins that are uh apparently good

147
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.950
for our health. And so, gene editing uh is

148
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.750
very useful in making small changes in deleting characters,

149
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.070
such as if there are certain foods with high

150
00:08:54.309 --> 00:08:57.429
uh undesirable elements. Like, you know, we have cyanide

151
00:08:57.469 --> 00:09:02.210
in cassava, we have uh the uh um uh

152
00:09:02.219 --> 00:09:04.885
uh anti nutritional factors in some of the grain

153
00:09:04.895 --> 00:09:08.025
legumes that we eat. So we can remove those

154
00:09:08.034 --> 00:09:12.354
uh undesirable elements from our food. But most importantly,

155
00:09:12.364 --> 00:09:16.755
gene editing ha has proved very useful in in

156
00:09:16.815 --> 00:09:20.354
empowering our crop plants to be more resilient to

157
00:09:20.364 --> 00:09:24.265
certain environmental factors. We can make them more crops

158
00:09:24.275 --> 00:09:27.525
more resistant to temperature, you know, increasing global climate

159
00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:30.500
change. That is one uh we can, there are

160
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.419
examples of the scientists have uh improved the crops

161
00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:38.700
more tolerant to flooding and tolerant to drought conditions,

162
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:44.619
tolerant to salt. And uh and there's really no

163
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.820
limit on what we can do with gene editing,

164
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.280
especially with simple traits, even complex traits such as

165
00:09:51.289 --> 00:09:55.599
yield ha ha have has been increasing yield has

166
00:09:55.609 --> 00:10:00.030
been achieved by m by editing several genes so

167
00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:03.270
that tomatoes can be a larger size and the

168
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.690
rice, we could produce more rice uh per unit

169
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.799
area using less water. And, and so almost all

170
00:10:12.809 --> 00:10:17.030
areas of farming can be altered and improved using

171
00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:17.909
this technique.

172
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.900
And so when it comes to tackling the effects

173
00:10:21.909 --> 00:10:25.940
of climate change specifically, is it that what we

174
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.570
are interested in here mostly is in developing temperature

175
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:36.820
resilient plants or are there other environmental issues like

176
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.830
for example, uh droughts and floods that we might

177
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:46.169
also help tackle here by developing certain specific traits

178
00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:46.900
in plants?

179
00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.719
Absolutely. Uh If you look around the literature and

180
00:10:50.729 --> 00:10:53.469
what scientists have achieved, you know, I'm an editor

181
00:10:53.479 --> 00:10:56.119
in chief of a very prominent journal in this

182
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.340
area called GM Crops and Food. And so I

183
00:10:59.349 --> 00:11:03.369
tend to uh uh almost on a daily basis,

184
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.479
come across examples of where scientists are have developed

185
00:11:07.489 --> 00:11:11.419
crops, plants that are res that are uh that

186
00:11:11.429 --> 00:11:15.989
are more tolerant to environmental stresses such as salinity.

187
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.340
Because increasing salt is one of the problems of

188
00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:24.960
sea level increase, uh encroaching of cultivated land with

189
00:11:24.969 --> 00:11:29.440
the sea and increased use of flooding water and

190
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.059
rice and fertilizers have made a lot of our

191
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.840
plants, uh a lot of our soils alkaline, so

192
00:11:35.849 --> 00:11:40.114
we can uh we can improved tolerance to salinity,

193
00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:43.434
even acidity is a problem in some areas. And

194
00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:47.094
of course, temperature flooding and drought are the most

195
00:11:47.104 --> 00:11:51.474
important traits that uh crops have been altered, using

196
00:11:51.484 --> 00:11:54.844
genetic. And another very interesting research that's going on

197
00:11:54.854 --> 00:11:57.275
is as you can see, uh one of the

198
00:11:57.284 --> 00:11:59.864
reasons why we have global climate change is because

199
00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:04.219
of the increased carbon dioxide. And so scientists are

200
00:12:04.229 --> 00:12:09.440
specifically developing trees and fast growing grasses that can

201
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.500
capture more carbon. So that's called carbon sequestration. So

202
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:17.690
they're able to, to literally trap carbon dioxide that

203
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.739
is in the atmosphere and reduce the carbon dioxide

204
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.155
uh uh surrounding the crop areas. And, and you

205
00:12:25.164 --> 00:12:27.604
know, this is kind of a a newer more

206
00:12:27.614 --> 00:12:31.025
frontier areas of research that we could do using

207
00:12:31.034 --> 00:12:34.284
generating. And there's a company uh here in the

208
00:12:34.294 --> 00:12:37.265
United States, I think with uh also which also

209
00:12:37.275 --> 00:12:41.344
Israel based company, which is literally trying to develop

210
00:12:41.354 --> 00:12:43.945
rice crops that can, that can be grown in

211
00:12:43.955 --> 00:12:47.530
the sea. And so just imagine uh in two

212
00:12:47.539 --> 00:12:50.359
thirds of our earth is covered by sea and

213
00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:52.809
we cannot grow any food crops on that. Uh

214
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.159
But if you are able to, to grow rice

215
00:12:56.169 --> 00:12:59.109
or any other crop on the ocean, and that

216
00:12:59.119 --> 00:13:01.619
is going to be a, a really game changer

217
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.119
when it comes to feeding the world.

218
00:13:03.809 --> 00:13:07.440
Yes. Uh And so, I mean, what would you

219
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.429
say are perhaps some of the biggest challenges in

220
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.109
developing these plants, these plants that are the result

221
00:13:15.119 --> 00:13:17.299
of gene editing techniques.

222
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.799
Well, the challenges are two for one that is

223
00:13:20.809 --> 00:13:23.799
technical. Uh WE need to have a great under

224
00:13:23.809 --> 00:13:28.030
greater understanding of the genomics, the underlying genes. We

225
00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:30.500
need to know what kind of genes control, what

226
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.729
kind of traits. And uh uh we have AAA

227
00:13:33.739 --> 00:13:39.169
very uh explosion of knowledge going on. Uh AND

228
00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:41.770
not only in the genetics of many of these

229
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.719
but what we call as uh proteomics out of

230
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.273
the, the genes and quote for proteins, what kind

231
00:13:47.283 --> 00:13:50.513
of proteins? And then uh we have metabol loic,

232
00:13:50.523 --> 00:13:53.992
what kind of metabolites that they, they secrete? And

233
00:13:54.002 --> 00:13:58.612
so uh concomitant with increase in our knowledge or

234
00:13:58.622 --> 00:14:02.543
explosion of genomics. There's also uh as you know,

235
00:14:02.552 --> 00:14:07.773
a a tremendous knowledge increase applications in artificial intelligence,

236
00:14:08.072 --> 00:14:11.893
uh computational power, all of that is helping and

237
00:14:11.903 --> 00:14:16.205
our understanding of the basic biology of crop plants.

238
00:14:16.286 --> 00:14:18.986
And that is important. While we have a good

239
00:14:18.995 --> 00:14:21.466
understanding of crops that are grown in the West

240
00:14:21.476 --> 00:14:25.426
such as like maize or soybean, uh we do

241
00:14:25.435 --> 00:14:28.435
not necessarily have such an understanding of many of

242
00:14:28.445 --> 00:14:30.695
the crops that are grown in the developing world

243
00:14:30.705 --> 00:14:34.625
such as sweet potato or cassava or bananas. And

244
00:14:34.635 --> 00:14:37.906
so that is one limitation crops that need to

245
00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:40.726
be improved in the developing world in the tropical

246
00:14:40.736 --> 00:14:45.150
areas, need more attention, need more funding. And uh

247
00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:48.619
and that is one limitation that is being overcome

248
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.530
and it's just a matter of time. And secondly,

249
00:14:51.539 --> 00:14:56.799
is the public acceptance and the global policies enabled

250
00:14:56.869 --> 00:15:00.830
at where these generated crops can be tested and

251
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.630
can be commercially released. While countries such as the

252
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.650
United States and even country like India now have

253
00:15:07.659 --> 00:15:10.950
a enabling policy where they say that hey, if

254
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.059
you have developed a crop by gene editing and

255
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.510
if it doesn't involve any foreign genes introduced as

256
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.559
a con as a consequence of that, then you

257
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.979
could more or less treat it like a conventionally

258
00:15:23.989 --> 00:15:26.820
bred crops and don't have to go through a

259
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.890
huge regulatory approval process that what is involved for

260
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.969
the GM. And that way, many of these generated

261
00:15:34.979 --> 00:15:39.200
crops, especially by the public sector, the universities which

262
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.739
don't necessarily have a huge budget to get regulatory

263
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.640
approvals can bring such crops um mainly again in

264
00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:51.299
the in the emerging economies and the developing countries.

265
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.650
But Europe is still sitting on the fence today,

266
00:15:54.659 --> 00:15:58.090
there is a very important decision that the European

267
00:15:58.099 --> 00:16:01.260
Union uh is uh looking at and the members

268
00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.979
of the parliament are going to be hoping to

269
00:16:02.989 --> 00:16:06.309
see if just like all other countries including the

270
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:11.640
United States, Japan and Australia can European Union also

271
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:16.799
allow gene edited crops uh to be regulated as

272
00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.260
conventionally bred crops and do not have to go

273
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.940
through the the GMO road. And so let's hope

274
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.619
Europe come to its census and vote favorably.

275
00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:29.909
Mhm We'll come back to that certainly in a

276
00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:33.770
bit. Uh But you mentioned earlier that the potential

277
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.500
of gene editing techniques applied to plants is virtually

278
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.179
limitless. So would that mean that for example, in

279
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.950
regards to what we talked about a few minutes

280
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.880
ago, since we have a very wide variety of

281
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.359
crops across the globe that it could potentially apply

282
00:16:52.489 --> 00:16:57.580
to virtually all crops and be perhaps tailored in

283
00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:02.049
each specific crop to each specific environmental context. So

284
00:17:02.059 --> 00:17:05.550
let's say with climate change, if temperatures go up

285
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.390
in a particular place, perhaps in that particular place

286
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.448
for that particular crop, we could have the genes

287
00:17:11.458 --> 00:17:13.808
in a way to make the plant more temperature

288
00:17:13.818 --> 00:17:17.468
resilient or if there's more floods in a particular

289
00:17:17.479 --> 00:17:21.368
place or droughts, we could also uh perhaps tweak

290
00:17:21.378 --> 00:17:25.917
with some genes to make the specific plants more

291
00:17:25.928 --> 00:17:29.259
resilient to those kinds of events is that it

292
00:17:29.808 --> 00:17:33.428
Yeah, absolutely. Uh There is no limit on what

293
00:17:33.438 --> 00:17:38.400
uh crops uh can be altered, what crop traits

294
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.250
can be altered. We are only limited by our

295
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.209
knowledge and the knowledge is improving and uh e

296
00:17:44.219 --> 00:17:49.010
extending. And uh there are, you know, uh there

297
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.430
are still, there are going to be certain limitations

298
00:17:51.439 --> 00:17:53.939
for instance. So far, I have not seen very

299
00:17:53.949 --> 00:17:56.640
good examples of gene editing trying to improve the

300
00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:02.280
pest resistance of crops. Uh BECAUSE gene editing can

301
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:07.040
only bring about changes and what DNA it has

302
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.209
and what traits that are there and what trait

303
00:18:10.219 --> 00:18:14.079
that are either suppressed or uh when that could

304
00:18:14.089 --> 00:18:16.800
be unleashed that are hidden. But on the other

305
00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:20.800
hand, uh uh currently, much of our crops that

306
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:25.410
are pest resistant is because of a, a technology

307
00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.589
called BT, it comes from AAA bacterial gene called

308
00:18:29.599 --> 00:18:33.339
from bacteria called das thy. And that's what protects

309
00:18:33.349 --> 00:18:37.949
our cotton against uh uh cotton shoot borer and

310
00:18:37.959 --> 00:18:41.579
things of that nature. And uh Kakon, many of

311
00:18:41.589 --> 00:18:44.609
those props have BT genes there. But at this

312
00:18:44.619 --> 00:18:48.949
moment, gene editing, uh except in few instances, not

313
00:18:48.959 --> 00:18:52.619
been very useful for pics. But nevertheless, other than

314
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:56.709
that, uh uh especially for quality traits, gene editing

315
00:18:56.719 --> 00:19:01.040
has proved uh really, really useful. And over time,

316
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.689
I am sure for practically any trait in any

317
00:19:04.699 --> 00:19:07.650
crop. Uh As long as there is DNA, we

318
00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.839
can study them, we can change them.

319
00:19:11.219 --> 00:19:14.430
So let me ask you a general question about

320
00:19:14.439 --> 00:19:17.180
gmos and I want to address this question because

321
00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:21.579
it is extremely common and there's many, many misconceptions

322
00:19:21.589 --> 00:19:26.199
surrounding it. So you mentioned earlier, for example, when

323
00:19:26.209 --> 00:19:30.109
it comes to potential health is issues that we

324
00:19:30.119 --> 00:19:34.369
have now 30 plus years of assessing the potential

325
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.030
effects that GMO S could have on human health

326
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.650
particularly. And I mean, I've seen even open letters

327
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.349
written by or signed by hundreds of uh scientists,

328
00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:51.089
sometimes even Nobel Prize winners saying that there's no

329
00:19:51.099 --> 00:19:54.770
evidence at all that should make people worry about

330
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.280
potential health risks here. But apart from that, would

331
00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.380
you say that there are any legitimate worries at

332
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.410
all about the development of GMO S?

333
00:20:07.569 --> 00:20:11.589
No, not really because uh you know, it, I

334
00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:16.130
it doesn't mean that some problem would not arise

335
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.089
in the future, but it is not unique to

336
00:20:19.099 --> 00:20:21.959
GMO S. You see, uh we have had some

337
00:20:21.969 --> 00:20:25.400
problems even with conventional plant breeding. For instance, a

338
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.109
celery variety was developed in California a few years

339
00:20:28.275 --> 00:20:30.864
ago when workers were uh who were in the

340
00:20:30.875 --> 00:20:34.055
working with those, but only that particular variety started

341
00:20:34.064 --> 00:20:36.885
developing the rashes and they found out that, that

342
00:20:36.895 --> 00:20:39.984
salary because they had made it more pest resistant.

343
00:20:39.994 --> 00:20:43.175
And so they had increased the particular chemical naturally

344
00:20:43.185 --> 00:20:46.180
producing chemical and this was by conventional breeding. And

345
00:20:46.189 --> 00:20:48.819
so we had to take the salary variety away

346
00:20:48.829 --> 00:20:52.719
from cultivation. And so things like that can happen

347
00:20:52.729 --> 00:20:57.099
even while developing GMO S. Uh FOR instance, there

348
00:20:57.109 --> 00:21:00.369
was a, a study that 20 years ago, a

349
00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:04.000
company had uh borrowed genes from Brazil nut and

350
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.819
put it into soybeans trying to make it more

351
00:21:06.939 --> 00:21:11.939
uh uh with high protein and better protein quality.

352
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.359
Uh CERTAIN types of uh amino acids are not

353
00:21:15.369 --> 00:21:19.040
found in soybeans, sulfur containing amino acids that are

354
00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:23.060
important for livestock feeding. And so they got sulfur

355
00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:26.479
containing amino acid type of protein genes from Brazil.

356
00:21:26.489 --> 00:21:29.670
I can put it into protein. And then uh

357
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.160
in that protein uh in soybeans, they found that

358
00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:37.000
it did increase the allergenicity of those soybeans because,

359
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.349
you know, some people are allergic to Brazil nut.

360
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.170
So if you have a peanut allergy or ground

361
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.959
nut allergy, and if I take a, a gene

362
00:21:44.969 --> 00:21:47.760
from groundnut and put it into rice or tomato,

363
00:21:47.979 --> 00:21:51.439
you may increase that allergy. So what I'm trying

364
00:21:51.449 --> 00:21:54.560
to say here is it's not that we are

365
00:21:54.569 --> 00:21:57.810
not going to have any problems with GMO. Sw.

366
00:21:58.069 --> 00:22:01.079
What we have is we have sufficient chucks and

367
00:22:01.089 --> 00:22:04.689
balances the, the kind of testing that we have.

368
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.949
And because it is so knowledge driven, we could

369
00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:12.660
a priori even before uh conducting many of these

370
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:16.989
experiments, we can expect potential problems with certain types

371
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.180
of GMO and we can avoid it. But on

372
00:22:19.189 --> 00:22:22.719
the other hand, look at the tremendous benefits and

373
00:22:22.729 --> 00:22:26.839
the possibilities. Right now, we have research going on

374
00:22:26.849 --> 00:22:31.189
trying to develop hypoallergenic uh ground nuts or peanuts,

375
00:22:31.199 --> 00:22:37.229
hypoallergenic, soybean and uh and bananas that can produce

376
00:22:37.239 --> 00:22:41.150
uh vitamin A and golden rice, which can uh

377
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.369
of course help with the vitamin A. And so

378
00:22:44.439 --> 00:22:47.829
when you look at all the potential positive health

379
00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:52.099
benefits of uh GMO S and gene editing some

380
00:22:52.109 --> 00:22:56.140
of the, the, the hypothetical problems that can happen

381
00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:00.660
are very minuscule and they could be uh predicted

382
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.859
and can be avoided and they are not unique

383
00:23:03.869 --> 00:23:06.430
because you can have the same allergy problem. Uh

384
00:23:06.469 --> 00:23:10.180
If you just cross uh a wild tomato with

385
00:23:10.189 --> 00:23:13.180
a, a cultivated tomato by traditional breeding, you could

386
00:23:13.189 --> 00:23:15.300
bring many of the allergens and toxins from the

387
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.479
wild species into the cultivated. So uh even environmental

388
00:23:19.489 --> 00:23:23.719
problems uh you can introduce even by conceal breeding.

389
00:23:25.319 --> 00:23:28.000
And isn't it also the case that when people

390
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:33.270
argue for example that by using gene modification techniques

391
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.050
or even perhaps some of them would argue the

392
00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.280
same for gene editing specifically that we are sort

393
00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:44.280
of messing with nature because we are introducing certain

394
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:48.520
types of genes where they wouldn't be naturally found,

395
00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:51.650
isn't it the case that we have actually been

396
00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.189
doing that? But not with this level of knowledge

397
00:23:55.199 --> 00:24:00.869
and precision since we started agriculture uh 10,000 years

398
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.729
ago, 14,000 years ago, with both plants and animals

399
00:24:04.739 --> 00:24:09.250
through artificial selection. But without any control at all,

400
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.349
when it comes to the genetic material and also

401
00:24:12.359 --> 00:24:15.010
with techniques like hybridization.

402
00:24:15.699 --> 00:24:18.670
Yeah, absolutely. Uh You see, we have been doing

403
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.089
it for a long time and so it's not

404
00:24:21.099 --> 00:24:24.040
something uh new that we are messing with the

405
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.349
nature. We started messing with the nature. Uh WHEN

406
00:24:27.359 --> 00:24:30.060
we walked out of the caves and started planting

407
00:24:30.069 --> 00:24:32.310
seeds and when we found out some of those

408
00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:36.160
seeds were uh not very good. We started, you

409
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.560
know, looking for a better uh crops within that.

410
00:24:39.569 --> 00:24:42.079
And that's how the whole selection process slowly occurred.

411
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.319
And so there is uh it is a responsible

412
00:24:46.329 --> 00:24:50.540
way of trying to manipulate what is around us

413
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:53.459
in a way that could help feed the humanity,

414
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:56.219
but doing so in a manner that is sustainable

415
00:24:56.229 --> 00:24:59.780
because we do recognize that agriculture, uh you know,

416
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:03.910
feeding 8 billion people on this planet entails some

417
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.890
environmental damage, correct. We have cleared massive amounts of

418
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.670
forest lands to grow these crops, uh, you know,

419
00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.910
the thousands of years ago or even still doing

420
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.430
it in many parts of the world and that

421
00:25:15.439 --> 00:25:18.500
is undesirable. And secondly, we use a lot of

422
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:22.250
chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides and we use a lot

423
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.050
of heavy equipment that causes damage to the soil.

424
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.760
And so what the question is not what we

425
00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.859
are messing with the nature. Not. Ok. Ok. That's,

426
00:25:31.869 --> 00:25:35.739
that's, I think that's irrelevant because we are already,

427
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.699
you know, we, we, we, we, we are doing

428
00:25:37.709 --> 00:25:40.569
that in a very big way and for many

429
00:25:40.579 --> 00:25:44.530
thousands of years. But moving forward, uh the question

430
00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.040
is how can we uh continue to, to feed

431
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.869
the humanity but in a manner that is less

432
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.900
damaging to the environment, less damaging to soil, less

433
00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.910
damaging to the air and less damaging to water

434
00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.750
and to make sure that uh uh uh ability

435
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.369
to grow food today is does not compromise uh

436
00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.510
the ability for our future generations to be growing

437
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.260
food. And so I uh for when you answer

438
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:18.359
that question, the sustainability uh can be achieved through

439
00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:21.439
knowledge through science, you know, not through ideology. You

440
00:26:21.449 --> 00:26:23.969
know, people say organic farming, a lot of that

441
00:26:23.979 --> 00:26:28.069
is just uh not, you know, the scientifically uh

442
00:26:28.079 --> 00:26:30.900
I I it does not show that when you

443
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.900
just have organic crops that are sustainable, but I

444
00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:38.489
do believe using um technology such as gene editing

445
00:26:38.599 --> 00:26:42.839
combined with all other uh principles of sustainability would

446
00:26:42.849 --> 00:26:46.760
help us to move forward uh to continue to

447
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.410
feed the humanity in a responsible manner and in

448
00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:51.579
a sustainable manner.

449
00:26:52.699 --> 00:26:57.939
So where do you think these misconceptions that people

450
00:26:57.949 --> 00:27:03.459
have surrounding GMO S stem from? And particularly why

451
00:27:03.469 --> 00:27:06.390
is it that people here where I live in

452
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.550
the European Union seem to be particularly worried about

453
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.939
it? Do you think that there's perhaps that it

454
00:27:12.949 --> 00:27:17.050
stems perhaps mostly from the fact that some people

455
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.390
have been putting out some misconceptions out there on

456
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.060
the internet and elsewhere and then people get across

457
00:27:23.069 --> 00:27:26.920
them and because they are ignorant of the science

458
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:30.199
surrounding GMO S, they just believe them because they

459
00:27:30.209 --> 00:27:34.520
sound credible to some extent. Or are there perhaps

460
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.949
other aspects here to consider as well?

461
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.849
Uh I, I think there, there are multiple reasons.

462
00:27:41.859 --> 00:27:45.270
Uh YOU know, the, the, the internet has certainly

463
00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.969
played a role but I think as human beings,

464
00:27:47.979 --> 00:27:51.859
we, we have, and, you know, I, we have

465
00:27:51.869 --> 00:27:56.609
evolved naturally to be very suspicious of anything that

466
00:27:56.619 --> 00:27:59.670
is different about our food, which that's how it

467
00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.430
has protected us even during our kill in days.

468
00:28:03.439 --> 00:28:06.250
Uh When we saw something, uh if we saw

469
00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:09.849
an almond, uh that, uh uh you know, which

470
00:28:09.859 --> 00:28:13.699
we have never eaten before. And we, we were,

471
00:28:13.709 --> 00:28:16.900
uh we, those who are careful in what they

472
00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:20.109
put into their mouth survived and proc created. You

473
00:28:20.119 --> 00:28:23.880
see, so we have that hard wired into our

474
00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:28.479
uh evolutionary system to be suspicious of food. And

475
00:28:28.489 --> 00:28:31.000
uh and you can see a lot of examples

476
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:35.670
uh uh like when we started uh uh pasteurizing

477
00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.160
milk, for instance, it was not really accepted. It

478
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.270
was, there were a lot of demonstration, there was

479
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.160
a lot of opposition because that was messing with

480
00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:46.400
my, you know, what can be more sacred than

481
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:50.109
milk. And uh it took almost 100 years uh

482
00:28:50.119 --> 00:28:54.939
after Louis Pasture invented pasteurization before it was accepted.

483
00:28:55.099 --> 00:28:57.979
And uh a lot of other technologies, the canning

484
00:28:57.989 --> 00:29:01.619
of food, freezing of food, uh processing of food

485
00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.680
there have been in, there have been oppositions and

486
00:29:04.689 --> 00:29:09.439
people don't readily accept. And even, you know, when

487
00:29:09.449 --> 00:29:11.010
I go to a new country and when I

488
00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.609
see something uh different food, II, I don't, you

489
00:29:15.619 --> 00:29:18.199
know, I'm always uh very cautious about it. You

490
00:29:18.209 --> 00:29:19.790
see what I mean? So I think that is

491
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.800
humanity. But on the other hand, we humans have

492
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.310
uh experimented with new food, Euro Europe. Um You

493
00:29:27.319 --> 00:29:30.400
know, for Italy tomato is so sacred. Now, what

494
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.724
is uh uh less Italian than tomatoes? But you

495
00:29:34.734 --> 00:29:39.084
know, Italians never ate tomato until 16th century. Irish.

496
00:29:39.094 --> 00:29:42.685
The potato is, is integral to Ireland. But, but

497
00:29:42.694 --> 00:29:45.655
there was no potato in Ireland until again, 16th

498
00:29:45.665 --> 00:29:50.704
century, you see coffee was introduced into England and

499
00:29:50.714 --> 00:29:54.194
tea was introduced. They're all new crops. And over

500
00:29:54.204 --> 00:29:58.189
time, we have uh we have uh learned to

501
00:29:58.199 --> 00:30:00.380
accept them if you like it. And if you

502
00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.819
find it useful for us. And so GMO s

503
00:30:03.829 --> 00:30:06.959
are again when they came along, uh it was

504
00:30:06.969 --> 00:30:10.209
a radical idea for people to think that something

505
00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:13.814
foreign genes are being put. But now we more

506
00:30:13.824 --> 00:30:17.395
and more knowledge, we recognize that such things happen

507
00:30:17.405 --> 00:30:19.704
in nature. For instance, they did a study of

508
00:30:19.714 --> 00:30:23.385
sweet potatoes. They, in, in, in Peru, there's an

509
00:30:23.395 --> 00:30:26.755
international potato center where they have thousands and thousands

510
00:30:26.765 --> 00:30:29.204
of varieties of sweet potato. And they found that

511
00:30:29.214 --> 00:30:32.180
all the sweet potatoes that they had in the

512
00:30:32.189 --> 00:30:36.869
collection had a, a bacteria, bacterial gene in them

513
00:30:37.189 --> 00:30:40.900
that was introduced uh directly like very similar to

514
00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:43.520
the same bacteria we use to make GMO S.

515
00:30:43.969 --> 00:30:46.630
And so mother nature has been making GMO S

516
00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.930
all the time and uh it's just that it

517
00:30:49.939 --> 00:30:52.239
happens naturally and we didn't know much about it.

518
00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.180
I didn't, we, we didn't worry about it, but

519
00:30:54.189 --> 00:30:57.239
when we have uh scientists doing it, we tend

520
00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.199
to worry about it, but that's one factor. But

521
00:31:00.209 --> 00:31:04.810
secondly, true. Uh THERE was an orchestrated opposition to

522
00:31:04.819 --> 00:31:07.650
GMO S in, in many countries, especially the rich

523
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.400
countries by a, by a very uh well funded

524
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:15.060
organizations such as Greenpeace saw this as a very

525
00:31:15.069 --> 00:31:19.199
lucrative activities to protest against uh GMO S because

526
00:31:19.209 --> 00:31:23.209
it represented taking on big corporations like Monsanto at

527
00:31:23.219 --> 00:31:25.910
the time. And there was a lot of anti-americanism

528
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.880
involved in that in Europe. Uh And so going

529
00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:34.109
after big companies like Monsanto uh was favored and

530
00:31:34.119 --> 00:31:37.119
tabloids did a lot of havoc in the early

531
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.939
two thousands with a lot of fake stories about

532
00:31:39.949 --> 00:31:43.959
GMO S causing impotence, you know, causes hair loss

533
00:31:43.969 --> 00:31:47.180
and things like that. And uh and secondly, uh

534
00:31:47.189 --> 00:31:51.689
European farmers also were afraid of GMO S because

535
00:31:51.699 --> 00:31:55.089
as you know, Europe farmers, like many farmers are

536
00:31:55.099 --> 00:31:59.839
very heavily subsidized. And uh and they felt that

537
00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.760
if you bring in a tool that improve the

538
00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:05.949
productivity, the governments might take the subsidy away from

539
00:32:05.959 --> 00:32:10.280
them. Even today, German French Belgian farmers are protesting

540
00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:13.180
for a different reason, variety of reasons. And so

541
00:32:13.189 --> 00:32:16.250
all of that mixed together, uh I think in

542
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:21.140
Europe uh was suspicious and the green parties held

543
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:24.010
uh the balance to power in countries like Germany

544
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.369
also had a platform of anti GMO and uh

545
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.689
and all of that contributed to the mess that's

546
00:32:29.699 --> 00:32:30.540
Europe today.

547
00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:33.969
Do you think that perhaps some of that when

548
00:32:33.979 --> 00:32:36.459
it comes to the European Union also has to

549
00:32:36.469 --> 00:32:41.109
do with some sort of economic protectionism? Because if

550
00:32:41.119 --> 00:32:46.069
it, if they make it harder for plants that

551
00:32:46.079 --> 00:32:50.420
are GMO s basically to come into the eu

552
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:54.005
and be sold here, then they are basically protecting

553
00:32:54.015 --> 00:32:58.375
at least to a certain extent European farmers

554
00:32:58.494 --> 00:33:01.974
a absolutely, you know, follow the money because for

555
00:33:01.984 --> 00:33:04.665
a any time when there is a, you know,

556
00:33:04.675 --> 00:33:06.974
when there is an apprehension when there is a,

557
00:33:06.984 --> 00:33:10.675
a protectionism, it's because you're trying to protect something

558
00:33:10.864 --> 00:33:14.670
and then Europe, um you know, uh uh uh

559
00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:18.609
did that mainly in the beginning. Uh MANY of

560
00:33:18.619 --> 00:33:21.630
the countries did that to keep some of the,

561
00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.609
the American uh uh products away. But on the

562
00:33:24.619 --> 00:33:27.229
other hand, you know, Europe, when it suits their

563
00:33:27.239 --> 00:33:31.010
interest, didn't have any problem because Europe, uh cheese

564
00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.469
is so integral to European culture, right? I mean,

565
00:33:33.479 --> 00:33:36.589
what, what is uh uh France without your cheese

566
00:33:36.599 --> 00:33:39.650
or German, without your cheese? And uh almost uh

567
00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.689
80% 90% of all the cheese that's produced in

568
00:33:42.699 --> 00:33:46.189
Europe uses the common in DNA genetically engineered enzymes

569
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.969
and they are not labeled, people have no problem

570
00:33:48.979 --> 00:33:52.510
with them. Uh But there is biotechnology underlying all

571
00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.319
of your cheese today. And almost every uh vial

572
00:33:56.329 --> 00:33:59.449
of insulin that is sold in Europe today is

573
00:33:59.459 --> 00:34:03.359
genetically engineered. And so there's no controversy about that.

574
00:34:03.369 --> 00:34:05.479
They are not labeled GMO S and nobody is

575
00:34:05.489 --> 00:34:08.458
protesting on the streets against that. And so the

576
00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:11.280
only reason they are protesting against GM crops uh

577
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:14.360
is because of uh some of these political factors

578
00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:18.899
even there, Europe is the largest consumer of GM

579
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:21.850
product in the world because Europe is uh next

580
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:26.560
to China imports more soybean genetically modified soybean to

581
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:31.938
feed your livestock than any other uh continent. And

582
00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:34.530
so there is a certain level of hypocrisy going

583
00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.208
on here.

584
00:34:36.138 --> 00:34:38.858
So, in a related topic, I would like to

585
00:34:38.868 --> 00:34:42.319
ask you now a little bit about organic agriculture.

586
00:34:42.329 --> 00:34:45.518
That is something that people in the EU and

587
00:34:45.529 --> 00:34:50.978
regulators specifically seem to be very fond of. So,

588
00:34:51.388 --> 00:34:53.603
um this is, of course, is a topic that

589
00:34:53.614 --> 00:34:56.955
is not only related to agriculture, food production, but

590
00:34:56.965 --> 00:35:00.864
also to environmentalism. At least some of the goals

591
00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:03.834
here would be environmental goals. So what do you

592
00:35:03.844 --> 00:35:08.604
make of the promises of people who support organic

593
00:35:08.685 --> 00:35:09.554
agriculture?

594
00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.719
Conceptually, it looks like a good idea. Uh ORGANIC

595
00:35:14.729 --> 00:35:17.729
agriculture, you know, why not? Why do we have

596
00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:23.090
to uh you know, put poisonous chemicals into our

597
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.540
food? Right? I mean, if it's gonna cause so

598
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:29.189
much health problem, if it's destroying our environment, why

599
00:35:29.199 --> 00:35:31.580
are we doing it? Why are farmers putting all

600
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.439
of those chemicals? Right. So on the face of

601
00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.500
it, when you really, when you're not well informed,

602
00:35:37.729 --> 00:35:41.250
that's the kind of argument. But the the point

603
00:35:41.669 --> 00:35:44.689
uh the most important factor remember here is the

604
00:35:44.699 --> 00:35:50.010
organic agriculture is a very small niche, ideologically driven

605
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.969
uh uh segment within agriculture. It's probably about 2%

606
00:35:54.979 --> 00:35:58.110
3% at the most 5% of the food in

607
00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.860
maybe in countries as uh you know, Germany or

608
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:03.020
France. It may be a little bit higher. But

609
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:08.620
overall organic is a an elite uh segment of

610
00:36:08.629 --> 00:36:11.899
the food because it costs more. So you are

611
00:36:11.909 --> 00:36:14.929
you, so it is not a solution to all

612
00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:18.439
the the put security issues in the world because

613
00:36:18.449 --> 00:36:20.370
you won't be able to feed the poor with

614
00:36:20.379 --> 00:36:24.100
organic. And secondly, organic costs more because it is

615
00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:27.260
less productive. If you don't put uh uh uh

616
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:30.530
if you don't amend the soil fertility uh of

617
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.919
what nutrients you are taking away from that. And

618
00:36:32.929 --> 00:36:35.949
trying to put that only with using manure and

619
00:36:35.959 --> 00:36:38.939
not using the def fertilizer, you won't be able

620
00:36:38.949 --> 00:36:42.090
to produce a lot of crop. OK. And so

621
00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:44.959
as a consequence of that, it takes a lot

622
00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:47.840
more land to grow the same amount of food.

623
00:36:47.919 --> 00:36:49.850
All right. So where are you going to get

624
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.229
that land? You're gonna be cutting down the forest,

625
00:36:52.239 --> 00:36:55.929
correct? So which is far more destructive, cutting more

626
00:36:55.939 --> 00:36:58.699
forest or adding a little bit of uh nitrogen

627
00:36:58.709 --> 00:37:00.719
into the soil to produce the same amount of

628
00:37:00.729 --> 00:37:05.000
food. And so organic, you know, on the just

629
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.520
if you're, if you're not aware of all the

630
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:11.229
details related to environment and sustainability sounds like a

631
00:37:11.239 --> 00:37:15.090
good idea. But as a food policy issue, organic

632
00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:19.080
is a very terrible idea because organic foods cost

633
00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:22.760
more organic foods, take away a lot more land

634
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:27.229
to grow and, and finally, they are not any

635
00:37:27.239 --> 00:37:31.360
way more healthier. Uh BECAUSE uh again and again,

636
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.020
the evidence show that uh if you if you

637
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:39.229
use this very controlled amounts of pesticides and monitor

638
00:37:39.239 --> 00:37:41.590
the levels of pesticide rescues in your food like

639
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.209
we do here in the US, there is uh

640
00:37:44.219 --> 00:37:47.050
it's not as much a problem as it's made

641
00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.610
out to be. And if we use uh uh

642
00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.879
U fertilizers in a very responsible manner and with

643
00:37:52.889 --> 00:37:56.594
now increasing technology with precision agriculture, we use less

644
00:37:56.604 --> 00:37:59.524
and less of those. And finally, with a lot

645
00:37:59.534 --> 00:38:03.905
of new technology including conservation tillage, uh increasing the

646
00:38:03.915 --> 00:38:06.645
use of herbicide tolerant crops through GMO S or

647
00:38:06.655 --> 00:38:09.274
gene editing. We now don't have to till the

648
00:38:09.284 --> 00:38:13.685
land, tilling the land uh to using plows is

649
00:38:13.695 --> 00:38:18.185
one of the most destructive acts uh in agriculture.

650
00:38:18.264 --> 00:38:21.905
And uh the, the when you think of uh

651
00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:25.709
uh the uh in the dust bowl during the

652
00:38:25.719 --> 00:38:29.179
depression time in the United States, it's because of

653
00:38:29.189 --> 00:38:32.070
the flowing of the land where all the soil

654
00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.070
was blown through the air and water. You see,

655
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.350
and when you see the muddied rivers of Mississippi,

656
00:38:37.425 --> 00:38:39.705
it's because of the tilling of the land in

657
00:38:39.715 --> 00:38:44.705
Iowa and Illinois upstream is the the very precious

658
00:38:44.715 --> 00:38:47.985
organic matter in the soil. So we have now

659
00:38:48.104 --> 00:38:53.264
almost eliminated tilling of the land using biotechnology. And

660
00:38:53.274 --> 00:38:58.510
so in, in, in reality, using science and innovation,

661
00:38:58.679 --> 00:39:02.409
we can bring more goodness to the environment than

662
00:39:02.439 --> 00:39:06.000
what ideologically driven organic pest in. In fact, organic

663
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.429
agriculture uses a lot of pesticides. Many people don't

664
00:39:09.439 --> 00:39:11.909
know that they use pesticides like sulfur, which is

665
00:39:11.919 --> 00:39:14.750
not even organic and it's a lot more toxic

666
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:20.139
and so organic is simply a a you know,

667
00:39:20.149 --> 00:39:23.840
a a segment of agriculture that people with a

668
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.989
lot of money can afford, but it is not

669
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.330
something that is going to help feed the world.

670
00:39:29.929 --> 00:39:33.350
Mhm Actually that, that last point you made there

671
00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.550
was one thing that I was going to ask

672
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.350
you about because actually it's very misleading. The fact

673
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:44.239
that many times people who produce food through organic

674
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:48.929
agriculture and promote it as such, label it as

675
00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:52.850
chemical free. I mean, of course, just on the

676
00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.530
face of it, it makes no sense because everything

677
00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:59.840
is composed of chemicals. But even if we ignore

678
00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:03.139
that bit, it's not at, at all the case

679
00:40:03.149 --> 00:40:07.120
that they do not resort to any pesticides at

680
00:40:07.149 --> 00:40:11.889
all. And sometimes even pesticides that are more damaging

681
00:40:11.899 --> 00:40:15.300
to the environment and to human health potentially, uh

682
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:19.580
just because they are labeled as natural by the

683
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.340
food uh system. Right.

684
00:40:23.139 --> 00:40:26.560
Certainly. And you, you, you said it right because

685
00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:30.639
uh it's really deceptive marketing practices trying to claim

686
00:40:30.649 --> 00:40:33.110
everything is natural. And you know, there, there have

687
00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.030
been studies that have been done. There's a very

688
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.550
extraordinary scientist called Bruce Ames at UC Berkeley was

689
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.449
one of the most sighted scientists for 30 years.

690
00:40:41.459 --> 00:40:44.300
And he has done some studies to show that

691
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:47.540
when we consume a cup of coffee, the natural

692
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.389
chemicals that are there in the coffee are a

693
00:40:49.399 --> 00:40:53.879
lot more toxic than trace elements of pesticides that

694
00:40:53.889 --> 00:40:56.620
can, that are used to grow coffee. And so

695
00:40:56.629 --> 00:41:00.780
by worrying about that, we are really uh trying

696
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:04.949
to, to, to deny the advance of technology and

697
00:41:04.959 --> 00:41:07.915
innovation that could help produce more food and, and

698
00:41:07.925 --> 00:41:10.675
it can be dangerous too. For instance, recently in

699
00:41:10.685 --> 00:41:13.794
Sri Lanka, a couple of years ago, the the

700
00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:19.205
president of Sri Lanka based on misinformation and mis

701
00:41:19.215 --> 00:41:21.895
avise from some of the environmentalists including one really

702
00:41:21.905 --> 00:41:26.794
worshiper as Lady from India, uh banned uh pesticides,

703
00:41:26.804 --> 00:41:31.000
banned fertilizers. And uh Sri Lanka is a agriculturally

704
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:34.139
very rich country. You know, Sri Lanka grows some

705
00:41:34.149 --> 00:41:36.949
of the best quality tea that you consume uh

706
00:41:36.959 --> 00:41:39.870
in the Europe and Sri Lanka is agriculturally fairly

707
00:41:39.879 --> 00:41:42.840
self sufficient country. They grow enough rice to feed

708
00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:46.110
themselves and even export. And it's a middle income

709
00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.030
country uh have much higher uh per capita income

710
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.330
than its northern neighbor India for instance. But by,

711
00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:58.469
by simple, the single act of banning uh importing

712
00:41:58.479 --> 00:42:02.409
fertilizers and banning the use of pesticides with a

713
00:42:02.419 --> 00:42:07.739
degree. Sri Lanka literally precipitated an economic catastrophe to

714
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:11.330
the country. And uh uh even two years since

715
00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.709
they have not fully recovered from the, the huge

716
00:42:14.719 --> 00:42:19.530
reckless damage that was done. And uh uh it

717
00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:22.370
also reminds me of another uh uh uh uh

718
00:42:22.379 --> 00:42:27.614
very pseudo scientists expert in uh during ST times

719
00:42:27.625 --> 00:42:30.415
in the US, Sr and the Soviet Union, a

720
00:42:30.425 --> 00:42:34.754
guy called Lysenko uh advised the Stalin that the

721
00:42:34.764 --> 00:42:36.804
genetics at the time we didn't have GMO S

722
00:42:37.074 --> 00:42:39.284
but they were worried about hybrids and genetics. The

723
00:42:39.294 --> 00:42:43.665
conventional breeding said that they are somehow antithetical to

724
00:42:43.675 --> 00:42:48.084
the communism and they are against communist principles. And

725
00:42:48.094 --> 00:42:51.064
so they banned uh uh breeding of crops and

726
00:42:51.074 --> 00:42:54.419
they banned scientific agriculture. And as a consequence of

727
00:42:54.429 --> 00:42:59.689
that, the the the Russian uh food production came

728
00:42:59.699 --> 00:43:04.620
down and China later embraced this, Mao embraced that.

729
00:43:04.629 --> 00:43:07.100
Uh AND during the Cultural Revolution and we didn't

730
00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.570
know much about that, but a lot of information

731
00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.760
came out later that literally millions and millions of

732
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:16.659
people died as a consequence of the pseudoscience. And

733
00:43:16.669 --> 00:43:21.320
so, you know, organic agriculture or opposition to GMO

734
00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:25.399
S might look cute uh for some, but it

735
00:43:25.409 --> 00:43:28.270
has some very serious consequences from when you look

736
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:32.750
from a policy level, embracing pseudoscience as consequences. And

737
00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.729
that one politicians need to be very careful about

738
00:43:35.739 --> 00:43:38.330
that, especially in Europe because, you know, there is

739
00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.739
a lot more uh tendency to have these romantic

740
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:44.959
notions about these things uh in Europe more than

741
00:43:44.969 --> 00:43:47.679
other places. And uh you need to be very

742
00:43:47.689 --> 00:43:48.659
careful about that

743
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:52.439
when it comes to Li Zenko, if I remember

744
00:43:52.449 --> 00:43:56.330
correctly and if not, please correct me here. Um

745
00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.810
I think that he was sort of an extreme

746
00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:05.790
environmentalist and didn't really care much or if or

747
00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.969
at all about genetics. And so that was the

748
00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:11.729
main issue here, right? I I mean, it was

749
00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:17.600
trying to cultivate crops. We uh uh while at

750
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:22.260
the same time ignoring entirely the genetic side of

751
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.679
things

752
00:44:22.689 --> 00:44:27.810
there. Correct. Yes. Yeah, he, he, his philosophy was

753
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:31.929
we can re shape the crops uh improve the

754
00:44:31.939 --> 00:44:36.290
crops by e environment, but you know, like slowly

755
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.719
uh growing uh some crops uh acclimatizing them. So

756
00:44:40.729 --> 00:44:43.219
let's say you want to make them more tolerant

757
00:44:43.229 --> 00:44:46.419
to heat or tolerant to cold, we can gradually

758
00:44:46.429 --> 00:44:48.899
expose them to cold or heat and we can

759
00:44:48.909 --> 00:44:52.370
make any crop adaptable to these conditions. And you

760
00:44:52.379 --> 00:44:55.919
know, there, there may be a certain uh uh

761
00:44:55.929 --> 00:44:58.860
truth to that with some epigenetics and things like

762
00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:03.040
that. But nevertheless, what he did was he used

763
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:07.229
that very pseudo scientific basis of that vernal organization

764
00:45:07.239 --> 00:45:09.270
and things of that nature. They called it science

765
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:17.479
to literally ban uh uh genetics, ban conventional hybridization.

766
00:45:17.649 --> 00:45:19.360
And so much so that there was a great

767
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:23.959
extraordinary scientist called VLO uh in, in, in Soviet

768
00:45:23.969 --> 00:45:26.550
Union at the time, he is literally the father

769
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:31.179
of biodiversity. He is the one who helped identify

770
00:45:31.189 --> 00:45:34.060
that all our crop plants have a origin in

771
00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.879
some places and they came. And then if you

772
00:45:36.889 --> 00:45:39.020
go back to the centers of origin, you can

773
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:43.379
find uh even today a great diversity of wild

774
00:45:43.389 --> 00:45:46.840
species like potato, you can find it in Peru,

775
00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:49.979
right? And if you want to find relatives of

776
00:45:49.989 --> 00:45:52.560
coffee, you go to Ethiopia. If you want to

777
00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:54.810
find relatives of rice, you go to Asia, I

778
00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.645
think like that. He was the one who first

779
00:45:56.655 --> 00:45:59.864
identified that all crop plants have their origin and

780
00:45:59.875 --> 00:46:02.715
they go to their origin. And he collected all

781
00:46:02.725 --> 00:46:07.375
those wild and he looms literally hundreds of thousands

782
00:46:07.385 --> 00:46:09.875
of that and made the concept of gene bank,

783
00:46:10.225 --> 00:46:15.304
which is fundamental to all agricultural development and what

784
00:46:15.635 --> 00:46:18.965
Lysenko and Stalin did was to literally put Bala

785
00:46:19.375 --> 00:46:22.959
on all scientists who were working on breeding into

786
00:46:22.969 --> 00:46:27.320
jail and, and the father of biodiversity and father

787
00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:31.669
of agricultural innovation of 20th century, died of starvation

788
00:46:31.679 --> 00:46:36.280
in Gulag in Russia. And so this is, this

789
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:39.979
is one of the sad uh uh uh stories

790
00:46:39.989 --> 00:46:42.669
that we have learned from our history. And you

791
00:46:42.679 --> 00:46:44.399
know what they say about the history. If we

792
00:46:44.409 --> 00:46:48.000
ignore history, what happens and uh we the ugly

793
00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:51.959
head of that uh opposition to science keeps coming

794
00:46:51.969 --> 00:46:54.719
again and again and again in different forms. And

795
00:46:54.729 --> 00:46:56.989
one needs to be very careful about it. Doctor

796
00:46:57.199 --> 00:47:01.760
Norwin blog, the the father of Green Revolution. And

797
00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:05.540
uh used to one many times again as to

798
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.439
some of these pseudo they are not environmentalists. You

799
00:47:08.449 --> 00:47:09.860
know, we are all in the, we are the

800
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:13.389
environmentalist because we know what is the, what is

801
00:47:13.399 --> 00:47:16.310
the environment we live with that? And uh these

802
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:20.189
are pseudo environmental, they are using environment as a,

803
00:47:20.199 --> 00:47:23.110
as a an excuse or a regard to uh

804
00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:28.040
to advance their specific ideological causes or even to,

805
00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:33.020
to, to for fundraising and, and their own prosperity.

806
00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.399
Mhm So we'll come back to that point about

807
00:47:37.409 --> 00:47:40.459
environmentalists in a second. But let me just ask

808
00:47:40.469 --> 00:47:43.040
you a little bit more about Sri Lanka, which

809
00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:45.489
you mentioned a few minutes ago because this is

810
00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.459
actually something that was brought to my attention by

811
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.350
a supporter, a patron of the show, Bernard. So

812
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.310
and if I understand it correctly in Sri Lanka,

813
00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.560
then, uh, they already have an economic crisis but

814
00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:04.510
then it got worsened by the government basically banning

815
00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:10.310
pesticides and adopting an agricultural system solely based on,

816
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.020
uh, organic agriculture.

817
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:16.000
Right. Exactly. Yeah. And now Sri Lanka, because of

818
00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:20.530
the, the COVID and, uh, they are very high

819
00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:24.659
reliance on tourism was already in bad shape at

820
00:48:24.669 --> 00:48:26.939
that time. But so are many countries, you know,

821
00:48:26.949 --> 00:48:29.739
there are so many countries that are rely, rely

822
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:32.729
on uh tourism as the main economic source of

823
00:48:32.739 --> 00:48:35.679
income, dozens and dozens of countries in the world

824
00:48:35.689 --> 00:48:38.030
and they didn't go bankrupt and they were able

825
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.399
to sustain. And Sri Lanka is economically had very

826
00:48:40.409 --> 00:48:44.629
sound uh economic underpinnings. And uh because it is

827
00:48:44.639 --> 00:48:48.500
also an agricultural country and by, by taking this

828
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:53.370
very reckless decision to go organic overnight, uh you

829
00:48:53.379 --> 00:48:55.469
know, and if they wanted to embrace principles of

830
00:48:55.479 --> 00:49:00.100
organics, reduce uh environmental degradation to over use of

831
00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:03.300
chemicals is an admirable goal. And be because we

832
00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:06.620
understand that places like India, there has been some

833
00:49:06.629 --> 00:49:09.899
problems in use of agrichemicals. And so that is

834
00:49:09.909 --> 00:49:12.860
a legitimate issue that needs to be addressed. But

835
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:16.219
by, by taking a reckless decision and going organic

836
00:49:16.229 --> 00:49:21.300
overnight, I think he precipitated the economic downfall of

837
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:24.100
Sri Lanka. And uh and so there is, it

838
00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:29.000
did, there were street protests and uh the president

839
00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:32.800
had to, to resign. And uh two months into

840
00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:36.120
that, Sri Lanka is still not fully recovered uh

841
00:49:36.129 --> 00:49:39.844
from the problem. So that shows that one needs

842
00:49:39.854 --> 00:49:44.014
to be very careful uh about taking important policy

843
00:49:44.024 --> 00:49:48.044
decisions that are not uh based on science that

844
00:49:48.054 --> 00:49:50.584
are not based on reason. But if you just

845
00:49:50.594 --> 00:49:53.895
listen to some of the pseudo uh activists and

846
00:49:53.905 --> 00:49:57.405
pseudo environmentalists, you bring a, a huge damage to

847
00:49:57.415 --> 00:49:58.084
your country.

848
00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:01.510
So let's get into the last topic of our

849
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.870
conversation today. Then that is something you've already touched

850
00:50:04.879 --> 00:50:07.750
a little bit on. But what, what are your

851
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:14.080
general thoughts on environmentalism as a movement and on

852
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:20.239
people who, who sometimes are genuine e environmental activists,

853
00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:24.139
but other times perhaps label themselves as such, but

854
00:50:24.149 --> 00:50:30.820
are maybe ignorant or delusional or misled in some

855
00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:32.139
particular ways,

856
00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.270
right? I think environmentalism in a very broad sense

857
00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:39.919
is an important uh movement that is uh that

858
00:50:39.929 --> 00:50:42.260
has brought a lot of good, uh especially when

859
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:45.500
you look at global climate change, uh which has

860
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:49.100
been a, which is an important factor. It is

861
00:50:49.229 --> 00:50:52.229
really transformed. You know, it is a, it's an

862
00:50:52.239 --> 00:50:56.219
existential threat uh to the uh the, the world

863
00:50:56.229 --> 00:51:00.639
civilization today. And uh I believe in understanding and

864
00:51:00.649 --> 00:51:03.229
awareness of that and it's a very scientific issue.

865
00:51:03.239 --> 00:51:05.830
We need to be aware of what causes this

866
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.429
and how we can do it and what are

867
00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:09.919
some of the uh solutions for that. And so

868
00:51:09.929 --> 00:51:14.469
it's a very science based uh uh approach that

869
00:51:14.479 --> 00:51:17.270
we, we need to have to, to solve that.

870
00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:21.330
But on the other hand, what has happened here

871
00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:25.000
is this the so-called the environmentalists who are causing

872
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:31.199
damage are those that simply bring pseudoscience and ideology

873
00:51:31.209 --> 00:51:33.699
into the mix here? And so this is where

874
00:51:33.709 --> 00:51:36.370
it's a problem for us, especially for a common

875
00:51:36.379 --> 00:51:39.729
person to separate the wheat from the chaff uh

876
00:51:39.739 --> 00:51:43.489
to recognize what are some of the most pressing

877
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:48.310
issues. Uh The wicked problems that are threatening the,

878
00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.860
the future of humanity today here. Then uh then

879
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:57.219
see how, what solutions that we we can move

880
00:51:57.229 --> 00:52:01.020
forward. What is unfortunately happened here is uh uh

881
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:04.659
uh individuals who are really who are in the

882
00:52:04.669 --> 00:52:07.250
fore front uh in the in the minds of

883
00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:11.169
the public who were seen as very poor environment,

884
00:52:11.179 --> 00:52:14.020
are doing a lot more damage to the progress

885
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.580
of the society. And people like Wan Na Shiva

886
00:52:16.739 --> 00:52:19.959
in India is the one who advised Sri Lankan

887
00:52:19.969 --> 00:52:22.360
government along with some of the other scientists like

888
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:25.419
Hans Heron uh who was a World World Food

889
00:52:25.429 --> 00:52:29.489
Prize winner uh did uh did do, did far

890
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.040
more great damage. You know, Lysenko was a scientist,

891
00:52:32.159 --> 00:52:35.070
he was a geneticist, but he simply misled the

892
00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.560
country. Uh There was a a AAA very famous,

893
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:40.189
there is a very famous scientist here in the

894
00:52:40.199 --> 00:52:43.429
US called Duisburg in UC Berkeley, one of the

895
00:52:43.439 --> 00:52:46.800
most prestigious universities in the uh in the world.

896
00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:50.379
And he uh was of the opinion, he's a

897
00:52:50.389 --> 00:52:53.399
member of National Academy of sciences too, which is

898
00:52:53.409 --> 00:52:56.030
the highest honor a scientist and can get here

899
00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:00.360
in the US of the opinion that HIV uh

900
00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:03.959
uh virus does not cause A I DS. And

901
00:53:03.969 --> 00:53:07.500
uh and uh in South African government believed him.

902
00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:10.659
And as a consequence of that, they banned all

903
00:53:10.669 --> 00:53:14.350
the therapeutic uh proteinase inhibitors and things of that

904
00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:16.909
age cocktail that has really kept A I DS

905
00:53:16.919 --> 00:53:18.649
in check all around the world in the last

906
00:53:18.659 --> 00:53:21.590
30 years, the banned and as a consequence of

907
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:27.020
embracing the pseudoscience and pseudo uh uh Star Wars

908
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:31.676
like this, they saw about 203 100,000 and people

909
00:53:31.686 --> 00:53:34.575
died in Sri Lanka. I'm sorry, in South Africa,

910
00:53:34.746 --> 00:53:38.585
because of uh the A I DS uh drugs

911
00:53:38.595 --> 00:53:42.686
were not allowed into the country. And so one

912
00:53:42.696 --> 00:53:47.125
must be very wary of uh individuals that have

913
00:53:47.135 --> 00:53:51.365
a, a vested interest in advancing certain causes. But

914
00:53:51.375 --> 00:53:54.025
on the other hand, uh we do have to,

915
00:53:54.035 --> 00:53:58.585
to, to, to understand that the uh scientific voice

916
00:53:58.595 --> 00:54:01.541
such as I CCC, for instance, coming up for

917
00:54:01.552 --> 00:54:04.622
the, the um for the global climate change and

918
00:54:04.632 --> 00:54:09.602
also to listen to the established scient scientists and

919
00:54:09.612 --> 00:54:13.392
the scientific community to see what kind of solutions

920
00:54:13.402 --> 00:54:15.632
that we can embrace in a way that we

921
00:54:15.642 --> 00:54:21.211
could bring about addressing this. Uh uh SO solutions

922
00:54:21.221 --> 00:54:24.832
bring about the solutions to the addressing the problems

923
00:54:24.842 --> 00:54:29.290
in a manner that is uh not ideologically driven,

924
00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.760
but fairly science driven.

925
00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.459
Mhm. Right. A and this is very unfortunate and,

926
00:54:35.469 --> 00:54:37.949
and this will be my last question also because

927
00:54:37.959 --> 00:54:43.209
I guess that many times what some environmentalists put

928
00:54:43.219 --> 00:54:47.500
out as information is in fact, misinformation, it is

929
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:51.699
very misleading and unfortunately, the general public and this

930
00:54:51.709 --> 00:54:55.320
is something that we can't really blame the common

931
00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:59.620
people for because they are not uh informed about

932
00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:05.324
such matters. Uh It sounds good, it sounds intuitive

933
00:55:05.334 --> 00:55:08.284
but is it is misleading and it not only

934
00:55:08.294 --> 00:55:14.024
applies to agriculture to, for example, misconceptions surrounding organic

935
00:55:14.034 --> 00:55:19.125
agriculture, GMO S but also even more broadly to

936
00:55:19.135 --> 00:55:23.004
some of the solutions, the best solutions that we

937
00:55:23.014 --> 00:55:26.225
would have on the table to fight back against

938
00:55:26.235 --> 00:55:28.165
climate change. Right.

939
00:55:28.429 --> 00:55:31.770
Exactly, climate change and even health issue when there

940
00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.639
was a global pandemic, there was quite a lot

941
00:55:33.649 --> 00:55:36.149
of opposition to the vaccines and it was at

942
00:55:36.159 --> 00:55:38.129
the end of the day, it was the vaccine

943
00:55:38.139 --> 00:55:40.580
and then a and a very new innovation and

944
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:44.459
tested innovation MRN a vaccine that help really bring

945
00:55:44.469 --> 00:55:47.969
about an end to that. And, and so I

946
00:55:47.979 --> 00:55:51.639
believe we must be open minded about many of

947
00:55:51.649 --> 00:55:54.629
the possibilities of innovation, including how we address climate

948
00:55:54.639 --> 00:55:59.239
change. And uh we if we are uh if

949
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:04.560
we invoke uh uh uh precautionary principle uh that

950
00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:08.320
until we know for sure, this particular solution is

951
00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:11.149
very, very safe that we cannot use it, then

952
00:56:11.159 --> 00:56:14.389
there is, we cannot move forward because humanity has

953
00:56:14.399 --> 00:56:20.459
moved forward the last 7000 years. By embracing change,

954
00:56:20.479 --> 00:56:24.100
but by embracing change in a very informed manner.

955
00:56:24.159 --> 00:56:27.060
And now with our knowledge in the, in the

956
00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:30.260
last 100 years, even last 30 years, as we

957
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:32.729
have an explosion of knowledge, because the science has

958
00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:34.929
advanced so much, whether it's in the areas of

959
00:56:34.939 --> 00:56:38.080
health, whether it's in the area of uh agriculture,

960
00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:42.679
uh climate change. And so let's use our knowledge

961
00:56:42.689 --> 00:56:45.729
in a sensible manner to bring about a change

962
00:56:45.739 --> 00:56:51.020
without necessarily how to bringing about any problems as

963
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:52.159
a consequence of that.

964
00:56:53.389 --> 00:56:56.729
So, Doctor Prakash, uh just before we go, would

965
00:56:56.739 --> 00:56:59.239
you like to tell people where they can find

966
00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:01.250
you and your work on the internet?

967
00:57:02.159 --> 00:57:06.429
Yeah, certainly. Yeah. If you are on Twitter, uh

968
00:57:06.459 --> 00:57:10.439
if you look for Ag Bow World, that is

969
00:57:10.449 --> 00:57:12.020
my handle, you know, I used to run a

970
00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:15.800
website called AG Biow World. AG is in agriculture,

971
00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:20.600
bio biotechnology or biology and world. Uh If you,

972
00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:23.419
if you look for AG by a world on

973
00:57:23.429 --> 00:57:26.520
either on Facebook or Twitter, you'll find me every

974
00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:30.340
day talking about these issues, uh posting funny memes

975
00:57:30.409 --> 00:57:33.719
on this issue and trying the hope that uh

976
00:57:33.729 --> 00:57:37.129
we could help educate and also learning. Uh I'm

977
00:57:37.139 --> 00:57:41.310
learning every day uh from smart people like you

978
00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:41.989
Ricardo.

979
00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.919
Well, thank you so much for the kind words,

980
