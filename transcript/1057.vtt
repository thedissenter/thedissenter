00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.089
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:05.739
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:07.969
today I have a return guest for you, Doctor

4
00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:12.130
Daniel Hoyer. He's senior research associate and managing director

5
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.939
for CCAT, Global History Data Bank, research scientist with

6
00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.940
the Social AI Research Group and founder of Soda.

7
00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.395
Last time we talked about his great book figuring

8
00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:24.145
out the past. I'm leaving a link to it

9
00:00:24.145 --> 00:00:26.995
in the description down below. And today we're talking

10
00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:31.104
about cliodynamics or the use of maths and data

11
00:00:31.104 --> 00:00:34.435
to study history instead of some other more traditional

12
00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:37.555
approaches. So, Doctor Hoyer, welcome back to the show.

13
00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:38.875
It's always a pleasure to

14
00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:40.595
everyone. Yeah, thank you so much for having me,

15
00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:41.185
Ricardo.

16
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.819
So, I mean, let's start perhaps with the most

17
00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:48.299
basic question here. So, what is cliodynamics?

18
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.729
Cliodynamics, it is an interesting kind of new field.

19
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.540
Really, all it means is bringing a sort of

20
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.389
scientific method to studying the past. And so it

21
00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:59.939
stands for Cleo is sort of the old Greek

22
00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:02.590
use of history, which is what it's named after.

23
00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.819
And dynamics is really just a study of how

24
00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:07.980
and why things change over time. And so it's

25
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.529
trying to bring the kind of formalism, the um

26
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.519
You know, theory testing hypothesis testing from science into

27
00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:20.419
understanding um the way that historical societies have changed

28
00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:21.080
over time.

29
00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:25.389
And how does it compare to other more traditional

30
00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:26.739
approaches in the history?

31
00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:29.129
It's a really interesting question. I, I, I think,

32
00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:31.370
you know, it's a little more um in line

33
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.610
with the traditional approaches than it seems at first.

34
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.540
I think it can accommodate many different uh methods

35
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.769
and tools. I'd say the main difference, as I

36
00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:43.050
say, is, is really trying to bring that formalism,

37
00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:47.410
that language of science of quantitative reasoning. So bringing

38
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.050
in statistics, bringing in math, bringing in sort of

39
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.110
modeling, um, trying to make your, your assumptions uh

40
00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:59.004
Explicit, trying to be formal about, OK, here's an

41
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:01.845
hypothesis, here's how I'm going to test it. Here's

42
00:02:01.845 --> 00:02:04.394
a sort of causal mechanism that we can explore.

43
00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:07.095
Let's see if it holds up in, in multiple

44
00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:10.205
different contexts. And again, that's kind of the scientific

45
00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:13.285
approach, but if it's very comfortably with as well,

46
00:02:13.324 --> 00:02:18.574
the qualitative, um, you know, detailed context finding of

47
00:02:18.574 --> 00:02:21.085
traditional history. So I think it's actually, you know,

48
00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:23.244
pretty in line with some of the traditional methods

49
00:02:23.244 --> 00:02:25.085
is just adding a new layer to it.

50
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.050
OK, but what kinds of sources can you resort

51
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.449
to and what kinds of uh specific methodologies do

52
00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.009
you have? Because for example, in, at least in

53
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:40.320
some sciences, we can do experiments, but in this

54
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.130
case, is that possible? I mean, how do you

55
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.750
approach it?

56
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.490
Yeah, well, you know, we, we call, we call

57
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.800
studying history, um. Natural experiments, and so it's not

58
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.639
quite the same as science, you know, you can't

59
00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.720
control all the factors. It is different, it is

60
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.520
harder because you, you know, you're, you're not in

61
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.720
control. You can't say, OK, I'm gonna hold these

62
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.440
three things steady and only um manipulate this one

63
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.839
thing. You just sort of get what you get.

64
00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:08.009
But, I mean, and this is where clear dynamics

65
00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:10.610
kind of comes in. If you are making your

66
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.809
assumptions very clear, if you are, um, and this

67
00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.889
is the, the benefit of the scientific method. It

68
00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.289
just puts everything on the table. You have to

69
00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:22.809
spell it out using math, you know, It is

70
00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.809
very useful. And just having that kind of language

71
00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:29.770
of math helps to, um, you know, set the

72
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.009
stage and say, OK, well, here's, here's what I

73
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.649
think. Here's the connection between these variables. This is

74
00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:38.610
a hypothesis. Then you could actually go in the

75
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.130
past and look for, OK, did that hold up?

76
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.009
Did it not? Where does that pattern hold? Where

77
00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:46.500
are the deviations from it? And so, you know,

78
00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:50.250
the more societies, the more cases, the more evidence

79
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.139
you can gather using traditional historical means. You can

80
00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.100
then put them into um this framework and use

81
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.860
that as the sort of natural experiments to say,

82
00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:03.500
OK, well, yes, it, you know, 85% of the

83
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.419
cases that holds this way, but in these other

84
00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.740
15% it doesn't, and here's why, and you can

85
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.139
start to really unpack that. So again, you know,

86
00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:13.009
it's it's not so much. It's not so much

87
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:15.380
the, the sources, the type of evidence that you

88
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.858
use, it's really just that approach to I have

89
00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:21.410
a hypothesis, I'm gonna test it. It just happens

90
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.260
to be what you're using to test is um

91
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.170
knowledge about the about the past.

92
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.540
And so, how does it relate to perhaps some

93
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.820
more traditional approaches in history that are more based

94
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.619
or focused on what we could call narratives, that

95
00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:41.459
is, this happened, that happened, that person did this,

96
00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:43.940
the other person did that and this and that

97
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.799
event happened. So how does it relate to that?

98
00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:49.119
It, yeah, it's a really good question. It, it's,

99
00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:52.059
you know, as I say, it's more in line

100
00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:53.779
and it seems at first. I think the, the

101
00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.170
real You know, it's not replacing anything. Let me

102
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.890
put it that way. OK really what it's adding,

103
00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:00.609
it's trying to add this extra layer. So it

104
00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:02.970
says, OK, well, that's great, and let's keep doing

105
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.929
that, and that's really important to have that, as

106
00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:08.000
you say, these narratives, these sort of stories about,

107
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.890
well, these are the key figures, these are the

108
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.829
actions they took, these are the reactions. And then

109
00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:16.799
on top of that you're adding, OK, well, You

110
00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:19.399
know, why, why did they do that? What were

111
00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:22.559
the pressures that were placed on them? Did other

112
00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.720
societies face similar pressures? And if so, did they

113
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.000
respond in similar ways? If not, why not? What

114
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.760
are the long term effects? And so it's really

115
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.480
kind of taking that step back and say, OK,

116
00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:36.399
what's the bigger picture? What are the broad patterns,

117
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.799
the dynamics that we're seeing? And when you, you

118
00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:42.220
know, when you're At that level, right? When you're

119
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.989
at the kind of macro level, when you're looking

120
00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:46.239
at many, you know, dozens or even hundreds of

121
00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:49.589
different cases at once, it's really hard to just

122
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.720
keep all that in your head. And this is

123
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.519
where that sort of scientific method, the clear dynamics

124
00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:58.640
tools come into play as they help you organize

125
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.339
and keep control of all that different um uh

126
00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:05.440
evidence and material in order to really pick apart

127
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.200
these are the patterns, these are the causal uh

128
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.549
drivers of of this and that. Mhm.

129
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.570
Does it help answer some traditional questions in the

130
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.739
history, like, for example, when people debate or have

131
00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:21.920
the debate between big men or big ideas kind

132
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.570
of approaches to history or, for example, some more

133
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.529
materialist approaches versus ideological approaches, stuff like that. Does

134
00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.079
it help answer those kinds of questions?

135
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.609
I, I would say so. I mean, I think

136
00:06:34.609 --> 00:06:36.690
it's, it's not only does it help, it's kind

137
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.170
of the best way to approach those. You know,

138
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.929
one of the things we say in the oak

139
00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:43.160
group all the time is, You know, if you

140
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.239
look at sort of the study of history, they

141
00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:48.350
are really, really good at knowing a ton about

142
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.559
the societies that they explore. They're really, really good

143
00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:55.359
about coming up with ideas, basically hypotheses for why

144
00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:58.670
things happen. The traditional approaches are not so good

145
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.890
at um at getting rid of some of the

146
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.450
options, right? Really good at uh expanding and adding.

147
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.970
They're not so good at resolving. And this is

148
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.980
where the sort of scientific method included comes in.

149
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.850
You know, for example, I can't even remember somebody

150
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.609
counted once there were like 80+ um different hypotheses

151
00:07:18.609 --> 00:07:22.529
put forward very reasonable by learned scholars about why

152
00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:26.299
Rome collapsed. Eating, like, oh that's, that's a lot.

153
00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:28.140
It can't be all of them, and they just

154
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.820
keep adding and adding and OK, well here's a

155
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.799
new take and what about this, and here's another

156
00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:35.899
factor, and that's great. So the scientific method, what

157
00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:37.549
it is good at is coming in and say,

158
00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:40.739
OK, this is fantastic. These are all different hypotheses.

159
00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:44.140
They make different assumptions. Let's go test them with

160
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.989
the data. Let's go explore the history and say,

161
00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:49.540
OK, well, this one holds, this one is unlikely

162
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.769
to be the case because it doesn't actually follow.

163
00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:54.619
And again, it just adds that Structure making things

164
00:07:54.619 --> 00:07:57.579
more explicit to be able to start to reduce

165
00:07:57.579 --> 00:08:00.329
the number of our hypotheses. You know, something like

166
00:08:00.329 --> 00:08:03.579
the, the big man, big ideas, um, sort of

167
00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:05.619
debate is a similar thing like it, it rages

168
00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:08.980
for centuries, really. Um, YOU know, people go back

169
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.660
and forth and, you know, you can, you can

170
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.619
induce um evidence on all sides. Clear dynamics comes

171
00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:17.859
in and says, OK, well, you know, what, what,

172
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.760
what would it look like if it was Big

173
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.600
men, so-called these, you know, major individuals with power,

174
00:08:24.679 --> 00:08:28.200
with authority driving historical events, or if it's, you

175
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.760
know, people are being compelled by ideas and how

176
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.398
do they shape. Yeah, let's actually explore that. Let's

177
00:08:34.398 --> 00:08:36.837
see which ones, you know, tend to lead to

178
00:08:36.837 --> 00:08:39.398
these major changes that we can explore in different

179
00:08:39.398 --> 00:08:42.278
societies. Yeah. You know, we, we've done a little

180
00:08:42.278 --> 00:08:43.999
bit of that kind of work. We've looked at

181
00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:46.749
sort of ideological developments. It turns out, of course,

182
00:08:46.838 --> 00:08:48.758
as you might expect, it's a little bit of

183
00:08:48.758 --> 00:08:51.078
both, right? You need all of it. It's, you

184
00:08:51.078 --> 00:08:54.758
know, individuals responding to ideological changes which themselves are

185
00:08:54.758 --> 00:08:57.880
responding to individual actions. So you can, you can

186
00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.760
draw this complex web, you know, when we look

187
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.719
at, for example, um, our work on the axial

188
00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:07.789
age, we show individuals matter, societies matter, ideas matter,

189
00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:10.400
material constraints matter, what else is going on in

190
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.440
the world, environments matter. All these things matter. And

191
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.340
the only way you can really expose all of

192
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.059
That and, as I say, the only way you

193
00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:21.500
can keep all of those different forces in your

194
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.179
mind at one time is by using this sort

195
00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:28.219
of quantitative formulas. It really, really helps, um, being

196
00:09:28.219 --> 00:09:30.299
able to put that together so that you can

197
00:09:30.299 --> 00:09:33.510
even approach a question like, you know, is it,

198
00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:35.340
is it big men or is it big ideas

199
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.179
that drive history?

200
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.500
Yeah, and I guess that without an approach such

201
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.309
as this and a more scientific approach to history,

202
00:09:42.359 --> 00:09:45.919
I mean, people, traditional historians, and I'm not trying

203
00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.559
to be disrespectful, but there is respectful here in

204
00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:51.229
any way, but, uh, they can just come up

205
00:09:51.229 --> 00:09:53.960
with more and more and more different factors that

206
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.679
they think might have played a role. Perhaps it

207
00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:58.000
was that person, perhaps it was that person over

208
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.010
there. Perhaps it was some of the Societal, perhaps

209
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.729
it was a societal context because it was perhaps

210
00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:07.489
it was an invasion by another country, something like

211
00:10:07.489 --> 00:10:10.369
that to, to explain the fall of a particular

212
00:10:10.369 --> 00:10:14.270
empire, for example. But without this kind of approach,

213
00:10:14.309 --> 00:10:16.530
at the end of the day, it's, I guess

214
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.890
it would just be a matter of taste or

215
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.369
of being convinced by a certain explanation that, uh,

216
00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:26.849
For, for people to really think that would be

217
00:10:26.849 --> 00:10:28.210
the right answer, I guess.

218
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.099
Yeah, exactly. You know, and when, when I go

219
00:10:31.099 --> 00:10:33.520
to conferences, when I go to workshops, of historians,

220
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.659
you do get these debates and you get these

221
00:10:36.659 --> 00:10:39.340
arguments of, oh, you know, well, well, here's, here's

222
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.909
good evidence that it is, you know, this, this

223
00:10:41.909 --> 00:10:44.820
charismatic leader. Here's good evidence that it is, you

224
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.349
know, this environmental change. And really, almost all the

225
00:10:48.349 --> 00:10:51.030
time, they're both right, right? Like these are very

226
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.299
learned smart people. They know what they're talking about,

227
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.869
and they are reducing proper evidence, but it's only

228
00:10:56.869 --> 00:10:58.409
telling one part of the story. And if you

229
00:10:58.409 --> 00:11:01.650
only focus on that, as you say, you know,

230
00:11:01.789 --> 00:11:03.739
you can, you can get convinced that this is

231
00:11:03.739 --> 00:11:05.669
the answer, and then somebody else focuses on a

232
00:11:05.669 --> 00:11:07.830
different part, and they're convinced that that's the answer.

233
00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:09.859
You need a framework to be able to say,

234
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.750
OK, well, they actually fit together. Here's how they

235
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.979
influence each other. This is, you know, at one

236
00:11:15.979 --> 00:11:18.979
level of analysis with the individuals, environmental forces at

237
00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:22.140
a different level of analysis. So they actually are

238
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.020
completely um compatible explanations. But unless you have that

239
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:30.409
framework to um be able to See how these

240
00:11:30.409 --> 00:11:33.969
different uh forces at different levels interact, you're never

241
00:11:33.969 --> 00:11:35.570
gonna be able to unpack it. And again, you

242
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.880
know, it's not like Cleodynamics wants to come in

243
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.210
and and stop like all of that knowledge, all

244
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:45.349
the traditional um historical approaches are super necessary. JUST

245
00:11:45.349 --> 00:11:47.559
wants to add a new extra layer to say,

246
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.369
OK, well, yeah, let's take all of this great

247
00:11:50.369 --> 00:11:53.419
learning and let's put it into this kind of

248
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:59.270
hypothesis testing type of scientific um method in order

249
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.309
to sort of move beyond some of these these

250
00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:03.270
arguments as you mentioned.

251
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.210
Mhm. So let me confront you with another big

252
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.250
question in history just before we move on to

253
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:15.429
smaller questions and more circumscribed questions here. So this

254
00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:17.190
history repeat itself?

255
00:12:18.289 --> 00:12:20.030
Uh, THAT'S a really good question. I mean, this

256
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.909
is. This is exactly the kind of thing that

257
00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:25.109
my colleagues and I with Seat want to look

258
00:12:25.109 --> 00:12:27.030
into and and start to ask these questions, and

259
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.070
you can only even ask this question when you

260
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.710
are looking at the grand sweep of history, when

261
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.739
you're looking at thousands of thousands of years and

262
00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:37.989
hundreds of different societies. You know, where, where I

263
00:12:37.989 --> 00:12:41.309
land on this, I would say, There's uh I

264
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.700
I'm misquoting Mark Twain here, but he said something

265
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.250
along the lines of, um, history doesn't repeat itself,

266
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.580
but it does rhyme. And I think that kind

267
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.739
of captures it. There's always, every society, there's always

268
00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:57.469
unique circumstances, no two are exactly the same. No

269
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.460
two events are quite exactly the same. The context

270
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.460
shifts, the environment shifts, the interaction with your neighbors

271
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.979
is a little bit different, but, um, there are

272
00:13:07.979 --> 00:13:10.500
definitely patterns, and I think that's what the rhyming

273
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.419
really gets at. There are things that occur again

274
00:13:13.419 --> 00:13:17.739
and again. Humans are, you know, we've changed, we've

275
00:13:17.739 --> 00:13:21.580
evolved, but there's a lot. Sort of at our,

276
00:13:21.619 --> 00:13:23.380
at the heart of who we are as a

277
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.330
species that has remained constant for thousands of years.

278
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.210
How we take care of ourselves and our families,

279
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.969
how we organize in groups, how we sort of

280
00:13:31.969 --> 00:13:36.150
engage in collective action, you know, maintain material, you

281
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.619
know, food and shelter, all of these different drives

282
00:13:38.619 --> 00:13:41.700
are the same and our our solutions to problems

283
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.099
that arise are often the same, you know, confronting

284
00:13:45.099 --> 00:13:49.950
with violence, um. But also cooperation, supporting each other,

285
00:13:50.039 --> 00:13:51.950
mutual aid, all of these things you can see

286
00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.750
happen again and again and again, responding to the

287
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.549
same kinds of circumstances that come up. So there

288
00:13:56.549 --> 00:13:58.559
are, there are a lot of rhymes, but it

289
00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:01.890
is important to understand. You know, A, what are

290
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.679
the sort of unique circumstances, and B, what I

291
00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:09.239
think is really critical is, is getting at, you

292
00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:12.520
know, these patterns don't just happen on their own,

293
00:14:12.599 --> 00:14:15.440
right? It's not just some magical thing that that

294
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.239
makes us act in certain ways. There are reasons,

295
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.309
you know, those reasons keep occurring, which is why

296
00:14:22.309 --> 00:14:26.169
these patterns happen again and again. But there are,

297
00:14:26.229 --> 00:14:29.950
there are drivers, there are causal forces that lead

298
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.710
to these outcomes, and it's really important to understand

299
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.469
that so that we can repeat the ones we

300
00:14:35.469 --> 00:14:38.030
want to repeat, and maybe move beyond the kind

301
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.630
of things we don't want, like war, like violence,

302
00:14:40.719 --> 00:14:42.549
like all of the stereotyping that, you know, all

303
00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:44.380
the bad things that we do to each other.

304
00:14:45.479 --> 00:14:47.979
They are recurrent, they are patterns, but they don't

305
00:14:47.979 --> 00:14:50.140
have to be, right? There are specific reasons why

306
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.020
we act that way, that we can um move

307
00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.929
beyond and I think having that perspective is really,

308
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.700
really crucial in history really helps um reveal where

309
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.580
we, where we can be better, I would say.

310
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.599
And I imagine that these sort of patterns, we

311
00:15:05.599 --> 00:15:08.320
should expect them or they were to be expected

312
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.359
because, I mean, if two different societies or more

313
00:15:11.359 --> 00:15:14.429
than two different societies are exposed to the same

314
00:15:14.429 --> 00:15:18.760
circumstances, if, for example, social, economic, political factors are

315
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.159
similar, if they are affected by, for example, natural

316
00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:26.919
disasters, something like that, or if people react the

317
00:15:26.919 --> 00:15:30.645
same way. To similar sorts of circumstances or their

318
00:15:30.645 --> 00:15:35.044
leaders make similar sorts of decisions, then we would

319
00:15:35.044 --> 00:15:38.604
expect, even though not exactly the same results, but

320
00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:39.794
similar results,

321
00:15:39.804 --> 00:15:41.945
right? Yeah, exactly, exactly. And we do see that,

322
00:15:42.085 --> 00:15:44.005
uh, you know, the natural disasters is really good

323
00:15:44.005 --> 00:15:46.924
because those have been happening forever, right, as long

324
00:15:46.924 --> 00:15:49.604
as human societies that happen, dealing with floods, with

325
00:15:49.604 --> 00:15:52.565
earthquakes, with droughts, and you can see, you know,

326
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.309
There's a fairly narrow range of reactions that societies

327
00:15:56.309 --> 00:15:59.830
have, and it depends on, you know, um, their,

328
00:15:59.929 --> 00:16:03.049
their circumstances are, are they wealthy? Is there material,

329
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.169
is their infrastructure built up? Is there trust in

330
00:16:06.169 --> 00:16:09.210
sort of the state to respond? If so, you

331
00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.130
tend to see one kind of reaction where you

332
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.450
see, you know, a redistribution of resources, you'll see

333
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.710
aid, you'll see rebuilding pretty quickly. In in societies

334
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.030
where the same kind of thing happens where, you

335
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:23.390
know, inequality has taken hold, where government kind of

336
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.469
dysfunctional, where there's a lot of sort of corruption.

337
00:16:27.739 --> 00:16:30.450
The, the sort of response mechanisms aren't quite there.

338
00:16:30.619 --> 00:16:33.940
You see those kind of disasters spiral into humanitarian

339
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.179
crises, leads to violence, leads to unrest, leads to

340
00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:40.780
rebellions, it's, you know, over and over you can

341
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.260
spot dozens and dozens of different cases that follow

342
00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.460
one of those kind of two broad types, and

343
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.669
it's pretty clear. You know, what are the conditions

344
00:16:48.669 --> 00:16:50.859
that lead one or the other. Again, those are,

345
00:16:50.989 --> 00:16:52.820
you know, in every different part of the world,

346
00:16:52.909 --> 00:16:55.909
every different time period, we've seen um the same

347
00:16:55.909 --> 00:16:57.270
sort of things materialize.

348
00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:01.099
So something that you've been interested in, and this

349
00:17:01.099 --> 00:17:04.290
is a more uh more specific question now, is

350
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:09.160
inequality, social and economic across history. So what do

351
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.479
we know about it through clear dynamics and what

352
00:17:12.479 --> 00:17:16.260
are the effects it had on human histories through

353
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.479
human society, sorry, throughout history? Yeah,

354
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.239
yeah, yeah. Um, I mean, this is, this is

355
00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:22.280
the big question. I, I would say we know

356
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.229
too much about it, unfortunately, um, you know, this

357
00:17:25.229 --> 00:17:28.040
is. Again, this is one of these common patterns

358
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.680
that we see again and again of societies, you

359
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.359
know, even, even ones that for a time, are

360
00:17:33.359 --> 00:17:36.680
experiencing growth and, um, you know, looking after the

361
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.339
well-being of the population. It'll tend to shift, uh,

362
00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:45.030
you know, those structures get co-opted, um. Wealth and,

363
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.369
and sort of power holders can um divert resources

364
00:17:48.369 --> 00:17:51.469
sort of to their own aims, aims, inequality then

365
00:17:51.469 --> 00:17:54.130
takes root. Again, we see this time and time

366
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.969
again. I'm, I'm hard pressed to think of a

367
00:17:55.969 --> 00:17:59.229
society that hasn't experienced this for at least some,

368
00:17:59.489 --> 00:18:02.520
some portion of its of its life span. You

369
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.680
know, one of the things that I've been saying

370
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.719
lately, and, and this is really at the heart

371
00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:08.630
of my recent research is trying to look at

372
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.719
inequality, why does it happen? What does it do

373
00:18:10.719 --> 00:18:13.430
to societies, how do we get past it. You

374
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.709
know, I, I've been calling it um one of

375
00:18:15.709 --> 00:18:19.589
history's great, uh, villains here, and it just, it's

376
00:18:19.589 --> 00:18:21.989
so corrosive in so many ways, at so many

377
00:18:21.989 --> 00:18:24.250
levels. You know, there's the sort of the obvious

378
00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.430
as inequality holds, those at the sort of bottom

379
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:30.530
end of the spectrum are left without. They are,

380
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.979
you know, don't have the resources, they are often

381
00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:35.670
um excluded from the halls of power, from political

382
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.869
decisions, their material circumstances are poor, right? Their well-being

383
00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:42.989
declines. That's horrible. But that's kind of the obvious

384
00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:45.699
one. Everyone knows that, that's clear. I think what's,

385
00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:47.910
what's less clear what we've been able to reveal

386
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.910
by clear dynamics, again, by, you know, looking specifically

387
00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:54.430
at all of these different societies. OK, what happens?

388
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.229
What happens to different groups? How do people react?

389
00:18:57.349 --> 00:19:00.469
Why do these things take hold? What we find

390
00:19:00.469 --> 00:19:03.060
is that, um, you know, inequality is just as

391
00:19:03.229 --> 00:19:05.609
corrosive at the other end of the spectrum, right?

392
00:19:05.709 --> 00:19:07.910
Even those at sort of the top, right, the

393
00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:13.189
wealthy elite, the politically powerful. It seems like they're

394
00:19:13.189 --> 00:19:17.359
doing well, and they, you know, try to maintain

395
00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:22.109
these systems that divert a society's resources more and

396
00:19:22.109 --> 00:19:24.270
more and more into their own hands themselves and

397
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:27.630
their family. This is how inequality grows, right? You're

398
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.560
accumulating wealth at sort of this, this top level,

399
00:19:30.859 --> 00:19:33.910
the rich 1%, the 10%, whatever you wanna uh

400
00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:38.180
market it as. But it's, it's, it's ephemeral, right?

401
00:19:38.189 --> 00:19:40.300
It's fleeting. It, it looks like you're being taken

402
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.900
care of, but it actually breeds, um, hostility, it

403
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.420
breeds frustration, it breeds competition, you know, you can

404
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.300
sort of accumulate all this stuff, but you can

405
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.699
never get everything you want. You can never translate

406
00:19:52.699 --> 00:19:55.339
all that wealth into political prominence, like, people are

407
00:19:55.339 --> 00:19:58.060
gonna be left behind. You're gonna promise your children

408
00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.650
that they're gonna be as well off as you

409
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.339
are. It doesn't always happen. This leads to frustration,

410
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.869
this leads to anger, this leads to resentment. And

411
00:20:05.869 --> 00:20:08.469
when that starts to bubble up, you start to

412
00:20:08.469 --> 00:20:11.790
see a lot of um maladaptive behavior. You see

413
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:15.219
partisan fighting, you see conflict, you see these sort

414
00:20:15.219 --> 00:20:18.469
of fundamentalist attitudes start to take hold, you start

415
00:20:18.469 --> 00:20:21.180
to do more and more extreme things, trying to

416
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.790
change or recapture what you think you're owed, um,

417
00:20:24.829 --> 00:20:28.060
you know, You can look around the world today,

418
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.859
right? We're seeing this all over the place, like

419
00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:33.300
a lot of the, um, you know, political infighting,

420
00:20:33.339 --> 00:20:36.859
a lot of the um sort of different attitudes,

421
00:20:36.939 --> 00:20:39.939
a lot of the sort of political dysfunction, democratic

422
00:20:39.939 --> 00:20:43.300
backslidings people are calling it. You can trace to

423
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.540
these these long periods of inequality that have been

424
00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.939
growing for decades, and, you know, people are are

425
00:20:49.939 --> 00:20:53.084
upset because they are being left without. But people

426
00:20:53.084 --> 00:20:55.635
are also being upset because they have accumulated too

427
00:20:55.635 --> 00:20:59.844
much, and it's over, they're overproduced, right? There's, there's

428
00:20:59.844 --> 00:21:02.765
too many people with too much wealth, too much

429
00:21:02.765 --> 00:21:05.964
power, fighting with each other, not actually getting what

430
00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:08.364
they want. It seems like they are, but they're

431
00:21:08.364 --> 00:21:11.619
not. And that's a really volatile situation to be

432
00:21:11.619 --> 00:21:14.930
in, and the society tends to be very fragile,

433
00:21:15.219 --> 00:21:17.959
um, to that, you know, when, when equality takes

434
00:21:17.959 --> 00:21:21.849
root and is allowed to fester for decades. It

435
00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:24.250
leads to violence, it leads to unrest, it, it,

436
00:21:24.329 --> 00:21:27.569
in many cases leads to complete societal collapse and

437
00:21:27.569 --> 00:21:30.770
um I think, you know, unfortunately, this pattern is

438
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.849
repeating itself now, but as you say, The clear

439
00:21:33.849 --> 00:21:37.130
dynamics approach, because you can track specifically, OK, here

440
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.770
is the well-being of, of different groups, you can

441
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.969
see how it changes over time, you can see

442
00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:44.790
it happening in different societies, you know, we have

443
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:49.609
a theoretical framework and methods to um uncover when

444
00:21:49.609 --> 00:21:52.770
and where and why inequality like this sets in.

445
00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.989
And again, the, you know, the news isn't great.

446
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:59.060
Historically reveals, history reveals that more often than not,

447
00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:03.310
the societies where this happens undergo some pretty catastrophic

448
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:07.469
violence, major civil war, uh, or, or, um, similar.

449
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.630
So, unfortunately, you know, I, it's it's always depressing

450
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.040
when I talk about this. So it's not great

451
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.550
news, but, you know, the more we can learn

452
00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.310
about it, the more we understand the drivers. I

453
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.270
do think there's a, there's a chance that we

454
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:22.030
can, um. You know, start to respond and, and

455
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.939
deal with it, uh, in the present.

456
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.349
But I mean, do we have a good understanding

457
00:22:27.349 --> 00:22:32.030
of which factors drive inequality? I mean, what gives

458
00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.390
rise to inequality, basically.

459
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:39.900
Oh, a lot of things, um, you know, it,

460
00:22:39.939 --> 00:22:44.959
it, it sort of It because it occurs so,

461
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.680
so frequently, a lot of times what we see

462
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.520
is there will be a shift, where society will

463
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.959
sort of, you know, come into being, it's putting

464
00:22:54.959 --> 00:22:58.819
in particular structures to grow, it's growing its wealth,

465
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.920
it's building things, it's growing its infrastructure, it's maybe

466
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.000
expanding its territory, it's growing its people, its population

467
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.349
grows. And, you know, there's often um some inequalities,

468
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:13.270
but they're usually kept fairly low. Most societies, when

469
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.989
they are functioning well, have mechanisms to keep that

470
00:23:15.989 --> 00:23:19.790
inequality kind of at bay. There's, you know, taxes,

471
00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.630
there's spending, there's welfare programs, even in ancient societies,

472
00:23:22.709 --> 00:23:26.939
there were programs and infrastructure that were looking to

473
00:23:27.229 --> 00:23:30.709
distribute the resources broadly to all of the people.

474
00:23:30.869 --> 00:23:33.150
So everyone was benefiting a little bit as, as

475
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.920
a society. Excuse me, as the society is going

476
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.630
along. What happens is usually there ends up being

477
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:43.989
a mismatch in that structure. So one part of

478
00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:46.189
it will kind of still grow while the other

479
00:23:46.189 --> 00:23:50.189
parts stop, and that kind of breeds these um

480
00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:55.390
Opportunities for diverting the resources more and more to

481
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:57.630
those with power, to those with wealth. And it

482
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.170
starts really slowly. I mean, this is why it

483
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.189
creeps in, right? It's not like it just happens

484
00:24:01.189 --> 00:24:03.869
overnight that everyone can see it and somebody passes

485
00:24:03.869 --> 00:24:05.109
a law that says, OK, all of a sudden,

486
00:24:05.189 --> 00:24:07.550
you know, all of the tax revenue of the

487
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.030
society is going to go to me and my

488
00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.420
friends. Like, it's not that dramatic. And this is,

489
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.790
I think, why it allow it, it's able to

490
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.109
um take root. It's, it's hard to see on

491
00:24:16.109 --> 00:24:18.630
the ground when you're living in it. You know,

492
00:24:18.709 --> 00:24:21.900
but there will be people or families with particular

493
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.780
um You know, have, have a little bit more

494
00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.050
authority, have a little bit more wealth than others,

495
00:24:27.819 --> 00:24:29.939
and instead of, of, you know, all of a

496
00:24:29.939 --> 00:24:32.729
sudden. Not all of a sudden, but over time,

497
00:24:33.219 --> 00:24:35.500
the structures that were were sort of keeping that

498
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.089
at bay, start to get loosened a little bit,

499
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.300
right? You say, OK, well, you know, everything is

500
00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.339
going well. There's, there's sort of population growth, the

501
00:24:44.339 --> 00:24:47.180
economy is growing, there's a lot of people, labor's

502
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.060
getting a little bit cheap. I can take a

503
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.180
little bit more, right? I'm, I'm a, a business

504
00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.459
owner. I'm, I'm interested in sort of buying this

505
00:24:54.459 --> 00:24:56.859
labor. It's getting a little bit cheap, my profits

506
00:24:56.859 --> 00:24:59.619
are growing. I'm gonna use those profits to buy

507
00:24:59.619 --> 00:25:01.420
a little bit more land. I'm gonna use those

508
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.500
profits to secure my position for myself and my

509
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.979
children a little bit further. And then they have

510
00:25:06.979 --> 00:25:10.520
an extra Their wealth has been grown in that

511
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.089
generation, then they do the same thing. So in

512
00:25:12.089 --> 00:25:14.250
the next generation, it grows a little more. And

513
00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.959
it takes a little bit of time, but over

514
00:25:15.959 --> 00:25:19.650
generations, it can become really um obscene, the, the

515
00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:21.369
amount of wealth and the amount of inequality, right?

516
00:25:21.469 --> 00:25:23.729
So it's, it's that kind of of action, right?

517
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.469
It's, it's decisions by individuals, especially those with wealth

518
00:25:27.469 --> 00:25:29.890
and power, to give themselves a little bit more

519
00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.810
wealth and power. And when you do that a

520
00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:35.410
bunch of different times, you end up with Fairly

521
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:39.489
drastic inequality. And, you know, you start to, people

522
00:25:39.489 --> 00:25:42.569
with wealth who are also, um, you know, hold

523
00:25:42.569 --> 00:25:45.530
positions of political authority, they're kind of in charge

524
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:48.439
of the rules. And if the rules are um

525
00:25:48.569 --> 00:25:52.839
curtailing their ability to, to, uh, divert resources to

526
00:25:52.839 --> 00:25:55.849
themselves, they can change those rules. They can, you

527
00:25:55.849 --> 00:25:58.359
know, lower the tax rates. They can make sure

528
00:25:58.359 --> 00:26:00.849
that, you know, instead of the state spending its

529
00:26:00.849 --> 00:26:04.829
money on Schools and hospitals, um, you know, they're

530
00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:09.099
spending it on, um, You know, uh, uh, buying

531
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.250
the goods that me and my wealthy people produce,

532
00:26:12.349 --> 00:26:15.099
right? Whether it's, you know, agricultural goods and oil,

533
00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.630
or fancy ceramics or tiles or whatever it happens

534
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.250
to be. And again, this is even ancient scieties

535
00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:23.069
go through this. And slowly you pick away, you

536
00:26:23.069 --> 00:26:24.949
sort of turn on that wealth pump, as my

537
00:26:24.949 --> 00:26:27.390
friend, uh, Peter Thurn calls it. And then all

538
00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:29.270
of a sudden now the resources that had been

539
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:33.660
redirected back to the majority population. ARE being redirected

540
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.150
to just that sort of uh wealthy 1% elite,

541
00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.579
and that's, that's really how it takes hold. And

542
00:26:39.579 --> 00:26:41.900
it takes many different forms, but it's always that

543
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.579
kind of process.

544
00:26:44.239 --> 00:26:46.819
But I mean, for a society to reach such

545
00:26:46.819 --> 00:26:50.579
high levels of inequality that it starts crumbling or

546
00:26:50.579 --> 00:26:54.780
the societal structure, the societal cohesion starts crumbling. I

547
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.500
mean, it has to be done uh intentionally, right?

548
00:26:58.589 --> 00:27:02.260
I mean, it's people, the economic elites, uh, together

549
00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:06.843
with politicians making those decisions. It's not something that

550
00:27:06.843 --> 00:27:09.802
just occurs. I'm, I'm not sure if this is

551
00:27:09.802 --> 00:27:11.963
the best word to use, but to use it,

552
00:27:12.162 --> 00:27:15.282
to use here, but it's not something that occurs

553
00:27:15.282 --> 00:27:19.003
naturally, right? Because I'm asking you that because sometimes

554
00:27:19.003 --> 00:27:23.203
we hear suggestions from certain people, certain pundits, for

555
00:27:23.203 --> 00:27:28.135
example, that if, uh, inequality. It rises, it's just

556
00:27:28.135 --> 00:27:31.546
the system, it's just how the system works. It's

557
00:27:31.546 --> 00:27:34.745
inevitable, something like that. But I mean, at least

558
00:27:34.745 --> 00:27:37.015
according to what you just, you just said there,

559
00:27:37.225 --> 00:27:40.615
it seems to me that, that it's not inevitable.

560
00:27:41.125 --> 00:27:43.395
Yeah, that's a really good question. Um, YOU know,

561
00:27:43.505 --> 00:27:45.026
I, I would say again, this is, this is

562
00:27:45.026 --> 00:27:48.520
why clear dynamics is helpful. Because it helps uh

563
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.569
but it's true, it gives us that frame to

564
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.439
um really explore a question like that. So what

565
00:27:53.439 --> 00:27:55.599
we find, and if you look at, for example,

566
00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.329
evolutionary work, if you even look at other species,

567
00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.959
what we find is that there's a bit of

568
00:27:59.959 --> 00:28:04.030
a contradiction in the way that humans work. OK.

569
00:28:04.219 --> 00:28:08.359
So there is You know, yeah, natural, is maybe

570
00:28:08.359 --> 00:28:09.640
not the right word. There's not really a good

571
00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.479
word for it. It is very common and there

572
00:28:12.479 --> 00:28:17.430
are reasons why humans and many, most other species,

573
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.719
um, are OK with hierarchies, right? Hierarchies are very

574
00:28:21.719 --> 00:28:24.359
dangerous, but they're also can be very helpful, right?

575
00:28:24.479 --> 00:28:29.280
Like there's a coordination challenge, having somebody in charge,

576
00:28:29.439 --> 00:28:31.500
even just to set the. Agenda, right? If you

577
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.060
ever been in like a meeting with more than

578
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.569
3 people, you know, it can be pretty chaotic,

579
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.579
unless there's kind of somebody in charge, somebody like

580
00:28:38.579 --> 00:28:40.900
you who's actually leading the interview, asking the questions,

581
00:28:40.979 --> 00:28:43.939
right? There is a reason why these sorts of

582
00:28:43.939 --> 00:28:46.780
hierarchies emerge in humans and other groups, right? So

583
00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.060
we're very comfortable with that. It is very helpful

584
00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.339
in a lot of circumstances, especially as societies become

585
00:28:52.339 --> 00:28:55.699
bigger in scale. It's just so hard. To coordinate

586
00:28:55.699 --> 00:28:59.020
to keep track, to manage hundreds if not millions

587
00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.300
of different people, without some kinds of positions of

588
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.420
authority, um, in, in some way. So there is

589
00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.020
that, that is, you know, natural, if, if that's

590
00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.619
the word you want to use, and, and many

591
00:29:10.619 --> 00:29:12.739
people do as, as you point out. So there

592
00:29:12.739 --> 00:29:15.260
is something there, right? There is something useful in

593
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.859
that. There's a reason that that emerges again and

594
00:29:17.859 --> 00:29:20.660
again and again in different contexts throughout history and,

595
00:29:20.709 --> 00:29:24.209
and even in other species. On the other hand,

596
00:29:24.459 --> 00:29:30.020
humans are naturally evolved to be pretty averse and

597
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:37.180
um Sort of disgusted by gross inequities. So those

598
00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.819
kind of two things don't seem like they go

599
00:29:38.819 --> 00:29:40.619
together, but they sort of do, right? Like, even

600
00:29:40.619 --> 00:29:43.300
if you, if you run psychological experiments, you can

601
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.849
sort of tell people, you know, in the abstract,

602
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.020
you know, is it, is it fair if, you

603
00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:53.150
know, person X has 100 times more wealth than

604
00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:57.430
person Y, pretty much everybody will say, yes, that's

605
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.949
not fair, that shouldn't happen, some rules should come

606
00:29:59.949 --> 00:30:02.760
in, even those with extreme wealth would say that's

607
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.430
not right, some rules should happen. So we are,

608
00:30:06.579 --> 00:30:10.930
you know, inclined to not accept those kinds of

609
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.959
extreme inequalities, especially when it becomes embedded in the

610
00:30:13.959 --> 00:30:17.280
person, rather than the position. Right? So there's hierarchies

611
00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.939
in terms of having uh a person like a

612
00:30:19.939 --> 00:30:23.099
president, a prime minister, whatever. But one of the

613
00:30:23.099 --> 00:30:25.020
reasons we have sort of term limits and these

614
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.030
kinds of rules is to get around this contradiction.

615
00:30:28.099 --> 00:30:30.099
We want there to be somebody in charge, but

616
00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:32.459
we don't want often a person to have too

617
00:30:32.459 --> 00:30:35.250
much power. So we, we try to have these

618
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.260
institutions that kind of balance those two things. And

619
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:42.239
with wealth, again, this happens that. In many cases,

620
00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:45.010
when things are going well, you will have hierarchies

621
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:47.199
emerge, you'll have people who are, you know, in

622
00:30:47.209 --> 00:30:50.359
in charge of political stuff or military or economic.

623
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.640
They gain these sort of extra uh amounts of

624
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.199
power. Because of their position, and it works for

625
00:30:58.199 --> 00:31:01.349
a time. But when they, when they sort of

626
00:31:01.349 --> 00:31:03.229
hold on to that, when they use that power

627
00:31:03.229 --> 00:31:05.390
to give themselves a little bit more to solidify

628
00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:08.630
that, to pass it on to their children, so

629
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.750
that it's not just the office itself that holds

630
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.750
power, it's, it's me and my family. That becomes

631
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.229
a little bit of a different situation. That's how

632
00:31:16.229 --> 00:31:19.510
it can then grow generation after generation and become

633
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.709
sort of this entrenched, uh, uh, inequity that just

634
00:31:23.709 --> 00:31:27.010
builds and grows and becomes farther. You know, so

635
00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.489
it is the result of decisions, but it's not

636
00:31:29.489 --> 00:31:33.810
always. It's not always just purely selfish and and

637
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:37.319
with ill intent, you know, people honestly think, OK,

638
00:31:37.479 --> 00:31:41.160
well, you know, I'm, I'm performing a service, I'm

639
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:46.160
the governor, I'm, you know, the CEO, whatever. I

640
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.510
deserve a little bit more. I'm doing something important.

641
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.079
My action, you know, provides this benefit to the

642
00:31:52.079 --> 00:31:54.910
society. And so, you know, I want to look

643
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:56.550
after my kids. And I mean, I'm not thinking

644
00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:59.270
about the impact on the wider society. If I

645
00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:02.709
was, maybe I wouldn't do the same thing. But

646
00:32:02.709 --> 00:32:04.729
if you're nearly focused on, OK, well, I want

647
00:32:04.729 --> 00:32:06.469
to take care of myself and my family, so

648
00:32:06.469 --> 00:32:08.510
I'm gonna act in this way. And it seems

649
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:12.819
small, and there's no immediate effect from it. But

650
00:32:12.819 --> 00:32:14.619
then in the next generation, your kid does the

651
00:32:14.619 --> 00:32:16.140
same thing, and then their kid does the same

652
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.099
thing, and then 100 other kids do the same

653
00:32:19.099 --> 00:32:21.540
thing. And before you know it, it's gone out

654
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.739
of control. So it's not, it's not quite always

655
00:32:24.739 --> 00:32:27.219
as intentional, you know, I don't think that the

656
00:32:27.219 --> 00:32:31.650
individuals are necessarily always the villains in the story.

657
00:32:31.819 --> 00:32:33.760
It is the system, right? It's, it's the system

658
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.609
that uh You know, you need institutions, you need

659
00:32:38.609 --> 00:32:42.130
rules, you need regulations that prevent that kind of

660
00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.390
action, because if you don't have them, if those

661
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:51.469
institutions are weakened, then very small. Seemingly with good

662
00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:54.430
intent kind of actions can lead to these terrible

663
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.150
consequences down the road. I think that's where we

664
00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.630
are. And again, this is why, one of the

665
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:04.119
reasons why the historical um Approach is so important

666
00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:05.890
is, you know, you can, you can look at

667
00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:08.449
sort of the state of inequality today in any

668
00:33:08.449 --> 00:33:12.260
kind of snapshot. But you're never gonna understand why

669
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.739
it happened, unless you look 25, 30, 50 years

670
00:33:16.739 --> 00:33:18.459
before, cause it takes a lot of time for

671
00:33:18.459 --> 00:33:20.500
it to get to where it is today, right?

672
00:33:20.619 --> 00:33:24.020
So you really need that, that long-term dynamic kind

673
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.660
of understanding, because it is, it's not just one

674
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.699
big decision by a selfish jerk. It's a bunch

675
00:33:29.699 --> 00:33:33.699
of little decisions by pretty well-meaning um individuals that,

676
00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.739
that lead to these bad situations. I don't know

677
00:33:36.739 --> 00:33:38.020
if that, if that makes sense, but there is

678
00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.890
that kind of contradiction of You know, we, we

679
00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:43.489
do want and and accept some kinds of hierarchy,

680
00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.420
but we also don't want too much inequality, and

681
00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.569
it's really hard to maintain a balance there. It's

682
00:33:48.569 --> 00:33:51.260
sort of a constant uh vigilance is needed.

683
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.650
So earlier when I asked you the first question

684
00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:59.050
about inequality, you mentioned phenomenon like elite overproduction and

685
00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:03.170
infighting, but is it that in more unequal societies,

686
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.609
we also see more competition not only among people

687
00:34:06.609 --> 00:34:08.530
who are already part of the elites and then,

688
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.688
and want to accumulate even more wealth and power

689
00:34:11.688 --> 00:34:16.020
and so on. But also across the other socioeconomic

690
00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.840
stra, I mean, is there also more competition for

691
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.489
people to try to reach those higher spots because

692
00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:25.280
they are the most secure in their societies.

693
00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.889
Yeah, uh, that's extremely well put. I mean, I

694
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:29.688
think that's exactly right. And this is again, what

695
00:34:29.688 --> 00:34:32.050
we see time and time again, um, when we

696
00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:33.810
explore these situations, and this is what I mean

697
00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:38.570
that. Inequality is corrosive throughout. You know, it is,

698
00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:42.379
as this wealth accumulates, generally what we find, and

699
00:34:42.379 --> 00:34:45.090
this is, this is common again throughout, um, you

700
00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:49.530
know, different contexts. But as people amass wealth and

701
00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:52.728
authority, they always wanna almost always wanna translate that

702
00:34:52.728 --> 00:34:55.560
into other aspects. So, you know, if you get

703
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.189
rich, you want to also be a politician or

704
00:34:58.189 --> 00:35:01.760
you also, whatever, whatever the society values. You want

705
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.159
to have this sort of prestigious uh authority in

706
00:35:04.159 --> 00:35:08.040
this other position. Generally, those are kind of limited,

707
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.199
those are fixed, right? Like, you look at the

708
00:35:10.199 --> 00:35:13.080
US, there's 100 senators, there's always been 100 senators,

709
00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.639
that's it. So no matter how many rich people

710
00:35:15.639 --> 00:35:18.560
think they deserve a Senate seat, there's only ever

711
00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.860
going to be 100 at a time. And so,

712
00:35:20.939 --> 00:35:23.399
the more rich people come in, the more wealth

713
00:35:23.399 --> 00:35:25.780
of masses, the more people think they have a

714
00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.300
shot or deserve one of those positions, the more

715
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.300
there's going to be frustration, because uh, you know,

716
00:35:31.459 --> 00:35:33.500
people are gonna be left out. But as you

717
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:38.290
say, As that is happening, people, you know, just

718
00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.360
below that are seeing this, oh, well, you know,

719
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:42.080
if I just had a little bit more wealth,

720
00:35:42.169 --> 00:35:44.320
I could be like them. I could join that

721
00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.850
class. Oh, they look like they're having a lot

722
00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.290
of fun. They look like they're doing great, you

723
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:50.889
know, yeah, I'm pretty well off, but I'm not

724
00:35:50.889 --> 00:35:52.850
super rich like my neighbor. I went to this

725
00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.250
party with that guy. I want to be like

726
00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:58.129
him. So you then strive to get that extra

727
00:35:58.129 --> 00:36:00.879
wealth, but a bunch of other people are doing

728
00:36:00.879 --> 00:36:04.270
that too. So again, that competition goes in. And

729
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:05.949
as you say at the same time, as this

730
00:36:05.949 --> 00:36:10.669
inequality is um uh getting deeper, it also means

731
00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:12.530
that there's more and more people sort of in,

732
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:17.139
in the bottom 80%, let's say, of the socioeconomic

733
00:36:17.439 --> 00:36:21.949
um strata, who are suffering, right, legitimately. Their well-being

734
00:36:21.949 --> 00:36:25.429
is declining, they don't have material resources, they don't

735
00:36:25.429 --> 00:36:28.260
feel like they're being included in the political process

736
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:32.179
because they're not, um, and they're frustrated, they're angry.

737
00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:38.120
And that breeds competition as well, both with, you

738
00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.739
know, anger at, at the wealthy elites who are

739
00:36:41.739 --> 00:36:43.239
in these halls of power. You say, well, how

740
00:36:43.239 --> 00:36:45.520
come you have everything, I want you to change

741
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.600
the system, I want to bring you down, I

742
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.949
want to, you know, change things up. But also,

743
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.919
as you say, with each other, we do find

744
00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:55.639
that factions tend to form, you do see this

745
00:36:55.639 --> 00:37:00.320
sort of partisanship, even among the non-elite um classes.

746
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.479
Again, a lot of it is, well, you know,

747
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.760
maybe it's, you're different than me, maybe you're the

748
00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.959
reason why I'm suffering, you know, there's a reason

749
00:37:08.959 --> 00:37:12.790
that sort of Xenophobic nationalist kind of attitudes. Again,

750
00:37:12.909 --> 00:37:16.870
these are not modern phenomena. You see these across

751
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:20.709
history, when things aren't going well, when inequality takes

752
00:37:20.709 --> 00:37:23.229
hold, people start to lash out. They want to

753
00:37:23.229 --> 00:37:25.969
look for a scapegoat, they wanna see, OK, who,

754
00:37:25.989 --> 00:37:27.979
who is keeping me down, who is an other,

755
00:37:28.149 --> 00:37:30.379
who's who's a different group, who's different than me,

756
00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:33.919
that I can maybe blame for, for what's going

757
00:37:33.919 --> 00:37:36.570
on or or focus my anger on. So you

758
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.570
see those kind of splits, you see those factions

759
00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.820
forming, you want to, you know, you want to

760
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.530
be upwardly social socially mobile, but maybe you're being

761
00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:47.639
prevented because the system, the structure has now developed,

762
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.530
inequality has developed to a way that, that you're

763
00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.320
not there. And when you combine both of those,

764
00:37:53.409 --> 00:37:57.610
when there's factions and unrest among the non-elites, and

765
00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:01.939
there's overproduction and competition among the elites, They tend

766
00:38:01.939 --> 00:38:05.199
to join up, and that's when you really see

767
00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:10.310
violence spike. Like most major civil wars follow that

768
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:12.479
path, right? It, it's a very, as I say,

769
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.280
it's a very dangerous, very volatile situation. I should

770
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.709
say, You know, there is a line of thought

771
00:38:17.709 --> 00:38:20.790
that says, well, that's actually necessary, that the only

772
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:22.709
way you can, you know, once you get in

773
00:38:22.709 --> 00:38:24.830
the situation where the system isn't working, where you

774
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.629
have this inequality, you need something to break it.

775
00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:31.449
There is some historical evidence for that. It's a

776
00:38:31.449 --> 00:38:34.129
little choppy, but there are, you know, some suggestions

777
00:38:34.129 --> 00:38:37.770
that, OK, you need some dramatic events to change

778
00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:42.260
the system, like a civil war. I, I am

779
00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:45.260
always of the opinion that, you know, we can

780
00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.820
have the change without the violence. Like civil wars

781
00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:51.500
are awful. Um, THEY are horrible, all wars are

782
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.850
horrible, they're violent, that's what we want to avoid,

783
00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.459
and we also want to improve people's lives. We

784
00:38:56.459 --> 00:38:58.169
should be able to do the one without having

785
00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:03.530
to have the other, um, and, you know, It's,

786
00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:07.090
it's, uh, It's also the case that not every

787
00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:11.209
civil war or or major dramatic, you know, violent

788
00:39:11.209 --> 00:39:14.729
uh revolution or rebellion, it doesn't always lead to

789
00:39:14.729 --> 00:39:17.199
improvement in people's well-being in the next phase, like,

790
00:39:17.209 --> 00:39:21.010
oftentimes it leads to authoritarian crackdowns. And so there's

791
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:24.050
no guarantee. Um, SO, you know, it's a little

792
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:25.469
bit of a be careful what you wish for.

793
00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.399
Like, it's, it's, there are, like, I, I get

794
00:39:27.399 --> 00:39:30.330
the mindset that sort of says, well, maybe this

795
00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.209
is something we need, maybe this is something we

796
00:39:32.209 --> 00:39:36.419
should be pushing for. You know, it's historically, we

797
00:39:36.419 --> 00:39:38.820
find that it's not, it's not as straightforward as

798
00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.979
it may seem sometimes. I guess that's where I'm

799
00:39:40.979 --> 00:39:43.060
trying to get to. That was a long answer

800
00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.830
to your question, but it's a really important topic,

801
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.129
I think, and so, yeah, yeah.

802
00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.659
But when we reach a point in a particular

803
00:39:49.659 --> 00:39:53.780
society where a revolution is about to occur, I

804
00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.489
mean, what leads to a revolution is people at

805
00:39:57.489 --> 00:40:01.020
the bottom because by then we have uh a

806
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:04.699
huge number of people who are, who have been

807
00:40:04.699 --> 00:40:07.979
basically abandoned by the system and are incredibly frustrated.

808
00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:12.139
Is it them mobilizing among themselves, or is it,

809
00:40:12.219 --> 00:40:14.929
for example, some people who are part of the

810
00:40:14.929 --> 00:40:18.620
elites mobilizing them for revolution?

811
00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:21.159
Yeah, it's a really good question. That's actually part

812
00:40:21.159 --> 00:40:23.199
of a research project that I have right now

813
00:40:23.199 --> 00:40:26.040
ongoing with a colleague, Rachel Ainsworth. We're trying to

814
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.239
look into revolution specifically, why do they happen and

815
00:40:29.239 --> 00:40:32.679
especially what happens afterwards, like what are the conditions

816
00:40:32.679 --> 00:40:35.719
that a revolution will lead to improvements in people's

817
00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:38.739
lives and when doesn't. And it's really interesting. So,

818
00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:42.310
you know, you definitely have movements of, you know,

819
00:40:42.379 --> 00:40:45.149
that kind of grassroots um style movement where you

820
00:40:45.149 --> 00:40:53.639
have a groundswell of popular unrest, um. Rarely, almost

821
00:40:53.639 --> 00:40:58.080
never, is that sufficient for a major system change

822
00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.560
revolution. You can have violence, you can have sort

823
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.239
of protests, you can have unrest because of that

824
00:41:03.239 --> 00:41:06.399
sort of popular groundswell, maybe sometimes you can get

825
00:41:06.399 --> 00:41:09.199
institutional reforms because of it. Um, I'm actually working

826
00:41:09.199 --> 00:41:10.919
on a piece right now that looks at different

827
00:41:10.919 --> 00:41:13.879
cases, for example, um, you know, we, we've been

828
00:41:13.879 --> 00:41:18.800
looking at, uh, the mid-nineteenth century England. Again, popular

829
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.070
groundswell of, of unrest, there was violence, there was

830
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.520
protests, there was major strikes at factories. This is

831
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.959
early industrial England. And what happened was, you know,

832
00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:31.120
the elite, the political class were fairly cohesive. So

833
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.639
it didn't, it didn't lead to a civil war.

834
00:41:32.719 --> 00:41:35.949
It didn't spiral, but there was kind of enough

835
00:41:35.949 --> 00:41:38.679
politicians, enough elite who said, well, you know, this

836
00:41:38.679 --> 00:41:40.520
isn't going well, this isn't gonna end well for

837
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.800
us. We should probably take some of these demands

838
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.600
seriously, and it led to actually this period of

839
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.439
good reforms, like, Um, safety protections for workers in

840
00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:51.679
factories and wage protections, and, you know, a lot

841
00:41:51.679 --> 00:41:54.189
of good kind of welfare policies came from it.

842
00:41:54.679 --> 00:41:56.909
We wouldn't call that a revolution, right? That's, that's

843
00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.959
a mini rebellion, that sort of protest that led

844
00:41:59.959 --> 00:42:02.600
to this period of reform. When you're talking about

845
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:09.290
like a major armed revolution. You know, That's, that's

846
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.310
so big that we historians can actually sort of

847
00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:15.649
identify it as a revolution. In almost every case,

848
00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.580
you get that that groundswell of unrest and people

849
00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:22.270
sort of taking up arms to make change. But

850
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:25.629
it has to link up with frustrated elites as

851
00:42:25.629 --> 00:42:28.679
well. Like without, if, if the people in power

852
00:42:29.149 --> 00:42:32.989
hold together, if they are completely united, a revolution

853
00:42:32.989 --> 00:42:35.939
doesn't have a chance in pretty much any situation.

854
00:42:36.149 --> 00:42:39.340
You need at least some factions of those with

855
00:42:39.389 --> 00:42:42.709
with wealth and power to get on board for

856
00:42:42.709 --> 00:42:46.110
it to turn into a real major revolutionary moment

857
00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.340
in in pretty much every case, I would say,

858
00:42:48.669 --> 00:42:51.659
um. And again, for good and bad, sometimes that

859
00:42:51.659 --> 00:42:56.500
leads to, you know, um, Positive system change, sometimes

860
00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.419
it's just a bunch of violence and things are

861
00:42:58.419 --> 00:43:00.580
kind of worse afterwards. You, you get a little

862
00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.419
bit above. But in almost every sort of major

863
00:43:03.419 --> 00:43:08.489
revolutionary case, it is a combination of Non-elites getting

864
00:43:08.489 --> 00:43:13.600
frustrated and elites um also being uh sort of

865
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:16.610
feeling left out by the current status quo and

866
00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.489
wanting, wanting to upend things, wanting things to change.

867
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.219
But is that because uh the elites, if they

868
00:43:24.219 --> 00:43:28.340
all get together, they have power over or they

869
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.340
can control the military and so they are more

870
00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:34.500
powerful than the rest of the population. BECAUSE I

871
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.699
was wondering because one could think that, oh, but

872
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.860
the people at the bottom are so, so many

873
00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.719
that they can overthrow the elites anyway. But I,

874
00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.739
I mean, why is it that they need, that

875
00:43:45.739 --> 00:43:48.850
they need some support from at least a faction

876
00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:49.860
of the elites?

877
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:52.209
Yeah, uh, it, it, it is that sort of

878
00:43:52.209 --> 00:43:56.290
suppressive mechanism. Like if, if those who are in

879
00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:59.610
most control of the wealth, the political authority, the

880
00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:02.840
military authority, the use of violence, if they are

881
00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.969
united and are willing to sort of use their

882
00:44:05.969 --> 00:44:09.209
authority to suppress dissent, they can suppress dissent in

883
00:44:09.209 --> 00:44:11.770
almost every case. Try to think of of examples

884
00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:14.250
where, where, um, you know, I mean, you, you

885
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:17.090
can see that all the time. It's short-lived, I

886
00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.209
will say like, you can't, you can't have a

887
00:44:19.209 --> 00:44:21.290
society that does that for hundreds of years and

888
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:24.649
it functions super well. Eventually, it will crack, right?

889
00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:28.600
Eventually, um, You know, you're devoting so much time

890
00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:33.360
and effort to dissent. That either, you know, an

891
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.520
elite group will splinter off and then you're not

892
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.209
united anymore, or what happens most of the time,

893
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:40.949
those are weakened societies that are taken over by

894
00:44:40.949 --> 00:44:44.500
somebody else. Um, RIGHT, not, it's not a viable

895
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:48.550
long-term strategy, but it can suppress, uh, dissent, it

896
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:51.989
can suppress a potential revolution in, in the short

897
00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:53.830
term. You know, you think of like Jack Goldstone,

898
00:44:53.989 --> 00:44:58.060
um, writes a lot about This and about, you

899
00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:01.770
know, the way that any sort of major revolution

900
00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:04.729
needs to have some power holders in charge, you

901
00:45:04.729 --> 00:45:08.679
can find suppression. Yeah, all over the place and,

902
00:45:08.709 --> 00:45:11.979
and, you know. If, if, if, if the powers

903
00:45:11.979 --> 00:45:15.300
that you want to, they generally can, but only

904
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.699
for a time. And so, you know, this, this

905
00:45:17.699 --> 00:45:18.939
is what I mean is that, you know, that's

906
00:45:18.939 --> 00:45:21.540
not necessarily the, the right path. If you want

907
00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:26.929
things to change, you know, it's, it's History suggests

908
00:45:26.929 --> 00:45:29.969
that you, you want to get people on board,

909
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:32.330
you want to build coalitions, you want to do

910
00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:36.449
some of that, um, You know, it can't just

911
00:45:36.449 --> 00:45:39.729
be popular uprising. OK, we're, you know, we're gonna

912
00:45:39.729 --> 00:45:42.169
come with pitchforks and, and take your stuff, that

913
00:45:42.169 --> 00:45:44.189
tends not to work out so well for anybody,

914
00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:48.739
um. A caution to the uh to the organizers

915
00:45:48.739 --> 00:45:50.510
out there, I guess. Yeah.

916
00:45:50.919 --> 00:45:53.280
So uh what do we have good examples of

917
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.800
societies who across history have been able to, so

918
00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.040
to speak, right the ship before it got to

919
00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.719
a point where they could no longer do it

920
00:46:03.719 --> 00:46:08.879
where extreme inequality was so high that the revolution

921
00:46:08.879 --> 00:46:12.830
or some sort of uprising was not preventable.

922
00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.419
Yeah, um, it's a really good question and, and

923
00:46:16.419 --> 00:46:17.939
one of the things I'm trying to focus on

924
00:46:17.939 --> 00:46:21.179
right now, it's harder to find than you would

925
00:46:21.179 --> 00:46:22.699
like it to be. There's only a sort of

926
00:46:22.699 --> 00:46:26.290
smattering of different examples, um. You know, it is,

927
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:30.040
it is difficult to sort of assess and discover,

928
00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:32.449
you know, a revolution that didn't happen that is

929
00:46:32.449 --> 00:46:36.110
really tricky. You know, I think of You know,

930
00:46:36.189 --> 00:46:38.090
for example, you know, I was just talking about

931
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:42.510
um the 19th century in England. You can look

932
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:45.149
at, you know, English history in sort of the,

933
00:46:45.159 --> 00:46:46.909
the large sweep of things. You look at sort

934
00:46:46.909 --> 00:46:50.780
of the 17th century, you look at You know,

935
00:46:50.939 --> 00:46:53.020
inequality was on the rise. There was a lot

936
00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.129
of unrest. There was, you know, pretty extreme um

937
00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.939
suffering by large segments of the population. This is

938
00:46:58.939 --> 00:47:03.830
sort of late medieval, um, early modern, um, period.

939
00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.729
You know, it's, it's sort of post feudal, uh,

940
00:47:06.739 --> 00:47:08.899
kind of situation. There's, there's a lot of extreme

941
00:47:08.899 --> 00:47:11.979
restrictions on many people, you know, in terms of

942
00:47:11.979 --> 00:47:13.699
their wealth, in terms of their movement, in terms

943
00:47:13.699 --> 00:47:17.080
of their access. There was a, a groundswell of,

944
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:21.219
of unrest. But that had been suppressed for hundreds

945
00:47:21.219 --> 00:47:23.889
of hundreds of years, right? Like, it was unequal,

946
00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.580
you know, sort of medieval feudal period. Europe was

947
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:29.040
highly unequal. And it's not like everyone was rioting

948
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.929
in the streets every year. This is sort of

949
00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:33.840
part of the example of what I mean. When,

950
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:35.729
when sort of the elites, when the power holders

951
00:47:35.729 --> 00:47:38.870
were united, they could, they could keep that at

952
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:43.500
bay fairly well. You know, 17th century in England,

953
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:47.229
this starts to creep into this inequality, this different

954
00:47:47.229 --> 00:47:50.669
factioning that's forming, you know, fights between different religious

955
00:47:50.669 --> 00:47:54.830
branches, fights between sort of the, the landed economic

956
00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:56.679
elite and some of the other sort of elites

957
00:47:56.679 --> 00:47:58.750
who are growing up and and getting wealth from

958
00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:01.199
trade and other sources. It's starting to create these

959
00:48:01.199 --> 00:48:05.909
frictions. Um, YOU can see, you know, For a

960
00:48:05.909 --> 00:48:07.340
lot of reasons we don't need to get into,

961
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:09.560
but it, it spirals into one of these major

962
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.389
periods and it turns into civil war, right? It's,

963
00:48:12.429 --> 00:48:14.679
it's a serious thing. All of these different conditions

964
00:48:14.679 --> 00:48:19.270
are there, inequality, unrest, lead overproduction, different sources of,

965
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:21.550
of wealth and power coming to a head, leading

966
00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:25.189
to this friction. So that that happens, and that's

967
00:48:25.189 --> 00:48:28.820
the most common thing. Again, what happens, you know,

968
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.100
you look at the same, the same country a

969
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:35.969
few 100 years later. Inequality is again taken root

970
00:48:35.969 --> 00:48:37.489
for the same kind of reasons, you know, it

971
00:48:37.489 --> 00:48:39.719
was reset a little bit after the Civil War,

972
00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:42.610
but then over time, over generations, it grew back

973
00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:47.850
up. Unrest is there, industrial, uh, industrialization is coming

974
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.530
to the country. So people are getting really, really,

975
00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:54.699
really rich from this industrial movement, but also many

976
00:48:54.699 --> 00:48:57.300
people are suffering, right? There's just no protection, there's

977
00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.719
no wage protections, there's no safety regulations in early

978
00:49:00.719 --> 00:49:04.020
factories in early industrial Europe. You know, it's, it's

979
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:07.419
a horrible conditions. People are really suffering. There's a

980
00:49:07.419 --> 00:49:09.129
lot of people who are moving to the cities

981
00:49:09.129 --> 00:49:11.689
cause they just can't find enough land and work

982
00:49:11.689 --> 00:49:15.530
in the, in the uh farmlands. Mhm. So they

983
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:16.969
moved to the cities and all they can find

984
00:49:16.969 --> 00:49:20.129
are these really horrible jobs in these factories. The

985
00:49:20.129 --> 00:49:23.489
conditions are terrible, they're way, way overworked. They're dying,

986
00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:28.040
they're, you know, Disease is rampant. It's awful. So

987
00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.000
there's a lot of unrest. There's violence, there's things

988
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.159
that are happening. And in many cases, the elite

989
00:49:34.159 --> 00:49:36.520
would come in and say, well, you know, too

990
00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.639
bad. I'm gonna suppress this, I'm gonna kind of

991
00:49:38.639 --> 00:49:40.070
keep this at at bay. And for a while,

992
00:49:40.159 --> 00:49:42.040
they did that, right? There were, there were strikes,

993
00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.719
there were riots in factories where workers, you know,

994
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.800
walked out on masse, and the military was called

995
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.620
in and said, OK, you know, we're putting a

996
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.800
stop to this. We are suppressing this. So that

997
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.669
definitely happened. But what it takes, and there's, there's

998
00:49:55.669 --> 00:49:57.580
a handful of other cases where this happens. This

999
00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.379
happens in um early 20th century US as well,

1000
00:50:00.389 --> 00:50:03.659
basically the same exact process with this early industrial

1001
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:06.689
situation. You know, what happens is you, you, you

1002
00:50:06.689 --> 00:50:10.110
see the suffering, you see how much Money, how

1003
00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:12.189
much time, how much resources, how much effort are

1004
00:50:12.189 --> 00:50:17.300
being spent just suppressing this dissent. There was enough

1005
00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.429
people in Parliament in England at the time, in,

1006
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:23.310
in the mid-nineteenth century, you know, it's not, not

1007
00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:25.860
necessarily that their, their motives were entirely pure and,

1008
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:27.929
and prosocial. They were maybe saying, oh, you know,

1009
00:50:28.229 --> 00:50:29.820
the only way I'm gonna hold on to my,

1010
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:33.469
my, um, wealth and, and authority is we need

1011
00:50:33.469 --> 00:50:35.350
to take some of these things seriously. We, we

1012
00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:37.949
need to say, OK, these people are upset. They

1013
00:50:37.949 --> 00:50:43.409
have specific um um uh demands. Maybe it would

1014
00:50:43.409 --> 00:50:45.889
be better and cheaper for us as a state

1015
00:50:45.889 --> 00:50:48.149
to actually meet some of them. So there was

1016
00:50:48.149 --> 00:50:50.610
a switch, right? So, at first, you're standing in

1017
00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:56.360
the military to suppress riots at these factories. Then

1018
00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.239
enough politicians are saying, well, you know, we should

1019
00:50:58.239 --> 00:51:01.000
take this seriously. There were, you know, the, the

1020
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.239
labor groups were in, in um conversation with some

1021
00:51:04.239 --> 00:51:06.439
of these elites, and they said, well, you know,

1022
00:51:06.679 --> 00:51:08.719
we are suffering, you should do something about it.

1023
00:51:08.879 --> 00:51:10.479
You should make our lives better, and we wouldn't,

1024
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.689
we wouldn't protest so much. And you start to

1025
00:51:13.689 --> 00:51:15.830
pass all these different laws. You start to pass

1026
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:19.909
safety regulations at factories, you start to give um

1027
00:51:20.459 --> 00:51:22.810
non-property owners the vote for the first time in

1028
00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:24.689
the mid-nineteenth century. So there was this sort of

1029
00:51:24.689 --> 00:51:28.370
political reform, you know, there was wage protections, there

1030
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:31.449
was all this spending on, um, you know, what

1031
00:51:31.449 --> 00:51:33.689
they called at the time porthouses, which was this

1032
00:51:33.689 --> 00:51:37.550
attempt to Uh, provide food and shelter for those,

1033
00:51:37.689 --> 00:51:40.090
uh, who are, who are suffering. It didn't really

1034
00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:42.330
work that well. Like it wasn't a, a super

1035
00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:44.719
great system, but at least it was a start,

1036
00:51:44.729 --> 00:51:46.659
it was an attempt. It was something to build

1037
00:51:46.659 --> 00:51:51.800
on. And it, it worked, right? Disent leveled off

1038
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.679
and without, you know, without a ton of violence,

1039
00:51:54.850 --> 00:51:59.800
you actually improved people's lives significantly. Um. You know,

1040
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.879
again, it was partial, it didn't go as far

1041
00:52:01.879 --> 00:52:04.040
as it should have, but it was at least

1042
00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:07.399
a start. It was a nonviolent way to actually

1043
00:52:07.399 --> 00:52:09.790
improve people's well-being. And I think though there are

1044
00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:12.600
enough examples that look like that, that we can

1045
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.879
sort of point to and see. It requires, you

1046
00:52:15.879 --> 00:52:19.639
know, just as a major revolution requires unrest among

1047
00:52:19.639 --> 00:52:25.689
the elite power holders. Successful nonviolent reform. Often, pretty

1048
00:52:25.689 --> 00:52:30.250
much, almost always, um requires some buy-in from the

1049
00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:32.770
elite power holders to say, yes, this is better

1050
00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:34.840
for all of us, even if I'm giving up

1051
00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.530
some of my wealth and privilege, it's better for

1052
00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:41.320
everybody, including myself. To have a system, a society

1053
00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:44.209
that works, that is stable, that can last in

1054
00:52:44.209 --> 00:52:46.750
the long term. It's really changing that sort of

1055
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:49.409
short term thinking of, I need to hold on

1056
00:52:49.409 --> 00:52:52.409
to what I have right now for longer term

1057
00:52:52.409 --> 00:52:54.090
thinking, saying, well, if I give up a little

1058
00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:56.889
bit now, everyone will be better off in the

1059
00:52:56.889 --> 00:52:59.010
long term. I. That's really at the heart of

1060
00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:03.090
the successful, um, reform kind of movements. Really hard

1061
00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:05.520
to convince people in the moment to do that,

1062
00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:08.010
that have that kind of long perspective. But I

1063
00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:11.409
really think that's a lot of where these conversations

1064
00:53:11.409 --> 00:53:13.729
today, where we're seeing, uh, again, the same kind

1065
00:53:13.729 --> 00:53:16.729
of patterns sprout up. This is where we, we

1066
00:53:16.729 --> 00:53:18.689
want to be, um, going and what we want

1067
00:53:18.689 --> 00:53:19.810
to sort of hold on to.

1068
00:53:20.889 --> 00:53:23.090
OK, uh, I was actually going to ask you

1069
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:26.179
exactly about that. So, do we see the same

1070
00:53:26.179 --> 00:53:30.050
kinds of dynamics and patterns playing out in our

1071
00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:34.929
contemporary societies when it comes to inequality, social unrest,

1072
00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:38.239
elite overproduction, and phenomena like that.

1073
00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:41.449
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, this is something, so, you

1074
00:53:41.449 --> 00:53:45.360
know, uh, our new organization Soda for Societal dynamics,

1075
00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:48.010
really, this is why it exists. It's sort of

1076
00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:50.750
an offshoot of our work with Sasha. You know,

1077
00:53:50.919 --> 00:53:53.949
it's such that we're trying to understand these patterns

1078
00:53:53.949 --> 00:53:57.709
and understand history. Soda is kind of uh uh

1079
00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:01.550
giving us that platform to say, OK, well, Let's

1080
00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:03.350
take what we've learned. Let's take what we know

1081
00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:06.830
about these historical processes and apply them to lessons

1082
00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:08.939
for the present day. How can we use this

1083
00:54:08.939 --> 00:54:12.590
to maybe help, um, you know, improve people's lives

1084
00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.229
today. And one of the reasons that we, we

1085
00:54:15.229 --> 00:54:18.389
started this organization is, is this realization that we

1086
00:54:18.389 --> 00:54:21.510
are repeating, you know, we are, we are, um,

1087
00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:25.219
filling out the same rhyme from the past. And,

1088
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.489
you know, one of the questions we had, Peter

1089
00:54:27.489 --> 00:54:29.979
Kurchen and I, when we started a few years

1090
00:54:29.979 --> 00:54:32.570
ago looking into crises, where we're like, OK, well,

1091
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:36.699
we assume that modern crises, you know, from, let's

1092
00:54:36.699 --> 00:54:39.840
say the 20th century on. ARE gonna look pretty

1093
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.399
different from, you know, pre-industrial crises. That was sort

1094
00:54:42.399 --> 00:54:44.879
of our assumption. So we started to look into

1095
00:54:44.879 --> 00:54:48.320
it, we were exploring more contemporary societies. And more

1096
00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.560
and more we found, oh wait a minute, this

1097
00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:54.919
actually looks kind of the same, even though we

1098
00:54:54.919 --> 00:54:57.649
have all this new technology, the economy is totally

1099
00:54:57.649 --> 00:55:02.000
different, the way we produce things, fossil fuels, industrialization,

1100
00:55:02.159 --> 00:55:05.399
the internet, now AI we have all these amazing

1101
00:55:05.399 --> 00:55:07.040
technologies, right? There's a lot of things that are

1102
00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.520
totally new. But as I say, humans are still

1103
00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.840
humans, and we are still doing many of the

1104
00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.679
same things and falling into many of the same

1105
00:55:14.679 --> 00:55:16.879
patterns that we saw before. It was actually even

1106
00:55:16.879 --> 00:55:20.830
surprising to us about how many similarities there are,

1107
00:55:21.399 --> 00:55:24.590
you know, again. The same things that I've been

1108
00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:29.169
talking about, you see people. Being able to, you

1109
00:55:29.169 --> 00:55:31.790
know, in many countries, especially in sort of the

1110
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:35.570
western or global North world, you know, late 1970s,

1111
00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:40.469
early 1980s, there was this period where You know,

1112
00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:43.580
the prevailing kind of economic and political wisdom was,

1113
00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:45.949
you know, oh, there's too many regulations, there's too

1114
00:55:45.949 --> 00:55:48.469
much rules, we need to grow the economy at

1115
00:55:48.469 --> 00:55:54.469
any cost. And this sort of allowed and promoted

1116
00:55:54.989 --> 00:55:58.600
individuals with wealth and power to, to kind of

1117
00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.719
set the rules. And again, as as we were

1118
00:56:00.719 --> 00:56:03.719
talking about a few minutes ago, what happens, it's

1119
00:56:03.719 --> 00:56:06.620
what always happens. You get some wealth, you get

1120
00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:08.500
some authority, you say, OK, well, now, well, let's

1121
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.610
change the, you know, um tax code a little

1122
00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:13.500
bit more. Let's let's ease up on some of

1123
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.739
these banking regulations so that we could grow the

1124
00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:18.899
economy, and it worked. The economies have been growing.

1125
00:56:19.719 --> 00:56:22.770
But it's also a small number of people have

1126
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.879
been capturing more and more of that wealth, right?

1127
00:56:24.889 --> 00:56:28.889
The economy, economic growth is going into very few

1128
00:56:28.889 --> 00:56:31.810
people's hands, and it's, it's over time, right? It's,

1129
00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:36.209
it's multiple generations, tweaking uh tax rule, tweaking a

1130
00:56:36.209 --> 00:56:39.370
banking rule, you know, tweaking the way that the

1131
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:43.010
economy works, buying real estate, how insurance, like, a

1132
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:46.949
little bit at a time, generation after generation. Now,

1133
00:56:46.959 --> 00:56:50.189
we are finding ourselves in the situation where inequality

1134
00:56:50.189 --> 00:56:52.600
is at levels it hasn't been in hundreds of

1135
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:58.010
years. In many, in many countries. So it's, it's

1136
00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:00.010
exactly the same kind of pattern. It's surprising at

1137
00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:02.409
how similar it is, even though so much of

1138
00:57:02.409 --> 00:57:07.060
our world is so different. Those kind of core

1139
00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:10.580
human traits, or human behaviors and responses are really

1140
00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:13.020
the same. And what this means is, we are

1141
00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:15.139
now facing the same things that people have faced

1142
00:57:15.139 --> 00:57:17.899
in the past, where we have this unrest, where

1143
00:57:17.899 --> 00:57:21.179
we have this elite overproduction and fighting, we have

1144
00:57:21.179 --> 00:57:24.500
this partisanship, we have this scapegoating and this sort

1145
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:28.860
of uh retreat to fundamentalist, nationalist kinds of ideas.

1146
00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:32.649
And we are seeing the violence that often happens

1147
00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:34.729
from these situations start to arise today too, right?

1148
00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:38.129
It is not surprising, um, given the situation that

1149
00:57:38.129 --> 00:57:40.530
we are seeing what we're seeing today, but it

1150
00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:42.550
also means that we can, you know, the good

1151
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:46.050
news is that it means that we can borrow

1152
00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:48.290
and adapt some of these things from the past

1153
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:53.239
that worked. To ease tensions, those still should be

1154
00:57:53.239 --> 00:57:56.169
uh applicable and useful today. These kinds of reforms,

1155
00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:59.530
improving people's livelihoods, you know, there are ways to

1156
00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:02.469
do this. Um, YOU know, we just need the,

1157
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:04.570
the sort of political and social will to, to

1158
00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:07.929
put it into practice, but yeah, um, you know,

1159
00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:11.050
the, the patterns are still there. It's, it's really,

1160
00:58:11.129 --> 00:58:13.360
it's eerie how how similar these are.

1161
00:58:13.879 --> 00:58:14.260
Mhm.

1162
00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:14.820
But

1163
00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:17.169
what do you mean exactly when you say that

1164
00:58:17.169 --> 00:58:20.540
we are living in an age of poly crisis?

1165
00:58:20.659 --> 00:58:22.719
What, what are poly crises?

1166
00:58:24.629 --> 00:58:26.550
So that I mean, this is, this is really.

1167
00:58:28.709 --> 00:58:31.129
It's a framework to help us understand exactly what's

1168
00:58:31.129 --> 00:58:33.510
happening today. And this is, you know, one of

1169
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:37.010
the things that is different, not entirely, there are,

1170
00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:38.909
there are situations in the past that are similar

1171
00:58:38.909 --> 00:58:42.719
to this, but, um, never before have we seen

1172
00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:46.379
on such a, on such a global, truly global

1173
00:58:46.379 --> 00:58:51.669
scale. So many different societies all at once experiencing

1174
00:58:51.669 --> 00:58:54.139
the same kind of thing, right? The, the coordination,

1175
00:58:54.229 --> 00:58:59.479
the synchrony. Between these, these patterns, that's kind of

1176
00:58:59.479 --> 00:59:02.449
new, that's pretty scary. Again, there's a reason it's

1177
00:59:02.449 --> 00:59:04.610
because, you know, the, the economy is global. There's,

1178
00:59:04.729 --> 00:59:07.370
there's the same sorts of things are now affecting

1179
00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:09.850
the same societies at the same time, in a

1180
00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:12.639
way that hadn't happened before, right? COVID is a

1181
00:59:12.639 --> 00:59:15.810
global disease because we're all interconnected. And this is

1182
00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:19.020
really what the polycrisis idea is trying to capture.

1183
00:59:20.389 --> 00:59:25.169
It's that The state of our systems, our economic

1184
00:59:25.169 --> 00:59:31.060
system, our communications technology, travel, um, you know, our

1185
00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:33.979
political system, we are so entangled with each other,

1186
00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:37.899
right? Everything you can imagine, every kind of system,

1187
00:59:37.979 --> 00:59:42.580
every country is really intimately connected and interacts with

1188
00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:46.020
others. And what this means is that if one

1189
00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:49.419
system goes into dysfunction, say there's, you know, a

1190
00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:51.780
recession in one country, a major recession in one

1191
00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:55.389
country. It's going to affect the economy of other

1192
00:59:55.389 --> 00:59:58.870
countries, right? We're all interconnected. And if the economy

1193
00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:01.429
of all these countries is affected, it's also going

1194
01:00:01.429 --> 01:00:04.310
to affect the politics of many countries. It's gonna

1195
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:09.229
affect food production. It's gonna affect the environment. Everything

1196
01:00:09.229 --> 01:00:12.270
is interconnected, right? So one thing drives another thing,

1197
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:14.820
which drives another thing, which impacts the first thing.

1198
01:00:14.989 --> 01:00:19.090
It's this really complex mechanism, this feedback. My, I

1199
01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:21.370
have friends at the Cascade Institute who've done a

1200
01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:24.050
really good job of trying to articulate this, and

1201
01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:26.469
this is, you know, they use this term polycrisis

1202
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:30.250
to describe the state of the world where all

1203
01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:33.290
of our systems are interconnected, and almost all of

1204
01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:36.929
them are under crisis right now. And again, it's

1205
01:00:36.929 --> 01:00:39.689
these long-term stressors that build up the way that

1206
01:00:39.689 --> 01:00:42.689
inequality builds up over decades, the way that our

1207
01:00:42.689 --> 01:00:45.580
environment has been suffering for decades because of our,

1208
01:00:45.629 --> 01:00:49.729
our production and consumption habits. These are long-term stresses

1209
01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.050
that have built up that have put all these

1210
01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:54.389
different systems at risk. And then you have these

1211
01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:56.800
triggering events, right? These fast moving trigger events that

1212
01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:02.300
hit those structures. A flash flood, a hurricane, you

1213
01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.780
know, uh, uh, a blip in the economy, you

1214
01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:08.020
know, a recession, but because the stress is so

1215
01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:12.399
high, when these things happen, It tends to permeate

1216
01:01:12.399 --> 01:01:15.919
and lead to enormous damage. Whereas if those same,

1217
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.120
you know, trigger events had happened, uh, when everything

1218
01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.149
was healthy, they would have just been a little

1219
01:01:21.149 --> 01:01:22.840
blip that, you know, it would have caused some

1220
01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.919
damage, but we would have been able to recover

1221
01:01:24.919 --> 01:01:27.520
quickly. But because we're under such high stress and

1222
01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.040
all of these things are so connected, one thing

1223
01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.159
goes wrong in one place, it tends to, to

1224
01:01:33.159 --> 01:01:35.959
permeate throughout the globe and lead to a ton

1225
01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:40.580
of dysfunction. And that keeps us um at risk,

1226
01:01:40.659 --> 01:01:42.580
that keeps us kind of vulnerable for the next

1227
01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:44.790
thing to happen. And this is really what the

1228
01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:47.679
poly crisis is, this is what we're facing. We

1229
01:01:47.679 --> 01:01:50.250
have, there have been poly crises in the past,

1230
01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.489
at least. At least periods that are similar to

1231
01:01:53.489 --> 01:01:55.790
the pot crisis, so there is still a role

1232
01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:59.590
for history to play here. Um, BUT it is,

1233
01:01:59.709 --> 01:02:01.750
you know, there are still some unique aspects as

1234
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:05.780
well, just how global, how truly, um, large scale

1235
01:02:06.199 --> 01:02:09.790
this interconnection is, that's happening today, which means it

1236
01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:12.219
just, it, it, it puts an even greater premium

1237
01:02:12.219 --> 01:02:15.310
on us to deal with some of these long-term

1238
01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:18.550
stresses like this deep rooted inequality that has taken

1239
01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:20.860
hold in so many different countries, like it is.

1240
01:02:21.719 --> 01:02:23.810
That is really one of the core things that

1241
01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:26.479
is, is putting us so at risk, and therefore,

1242
01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.879
that's one of the things that can help get

1243
01:02:28.879 --> 01:02:32.239
us out of it. Even the environmental degradation we're,

1244
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.479
we're, um, seeing, a lot of that is fueled

1245
01:02:35.479 --> 01:02:38.919
by inequality, right? But this over uh amassing of

1246
01:02:38.919 --> 01:02:42.300
wealth and consumption. So, you know, as I always

1247
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:45.179
say, like dealing with inequality is a climate solution,

1248
01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.449
right? These are not inter, these are not um

1249
01:02:47.899 --> 01:02:50.419
completely separate uh problems or phenomenon. I think this

1250
01:02:50.419 --> 01:02:52.500
is, this is what the crisis is really trying

1251
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:56.500
to expose, um, how, how that all works together.

1252
01:02:57.550 --> 01:03:00.790
OK, so one last question then you've already alluded

1253
01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:03.669
to this before, but uh when it comes to

1254
01:03:03.669 --> 01:03:08.429
these public crises and perhaps focusing more on inequality

1255
01:03:08.429 --> 01:03:10.870
itself, because that's what we've been talking about the

1256
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:15.060
most here today. I, I mean, Does Clio dynamics

1257
01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.500
have anything to tell us or do we have

1258
01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.310
anything to learn from it about what we should

1259
01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:23.300
do to tackle this issue? I mean, do you

1260
01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:27.580
have any suggestions, any lessons about it that that

1261
01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:28.620
we could apply today?

1262
01:03:29.399 --> 01:03:32.260
Yeah, I mean, this is, it's such a, it's

1263
01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:34.260
such a big important question and something I think

1264
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:37.540
a lot about, you know, it's not, it's not

1265
01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:40.699
as clear cut as, OK, well, you know, history

1266
01:03:40.699 --> 01:03:42.260
says we need to do A, B, and C,

1267
01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.129
so we just do them. And, you know, it's,

1268
01:03:44.139 --> 01:03:46.790
it's a sort of one size fits all roadmap.

1269
01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:49.379
On the other hand, I do think that clear

1270
01:03:49.379 --> 01:03:51.909
dynamics does have a lot to say. It does,

1271
01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:56.310
it, it can help. Really what it helps is,

1272
01:03:57.129 --> 01:03:59.560
first of all, just exposing the depth of the

1273
01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.399
problem. And again, you know, as we talked about,

1274
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.639
a lot of people know that inequality is a

1275
01:04:04.639 --> 01:04:07.409
big problem today. I don't think that many people,

1276
01:04:07.439 --> 01:04:09.639
even, you know, I, I've talked to some politicians

1277
01:04:09.639 --> 01:04:12.520
and some policymakers, and it comes as a surprise

1278
01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.719
to them just how deep the roots of the

1279
01:04:15.719 --> 01:04:19.350
problem are, that it goes back decades and generations,

1280
01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.750
that it is so structural, that, you know, it's,

1281
01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.469
it's not just We want to assume that it's,

1282
01:04:25.479 --> 01:04:28.600
you know, 11 policy, one rule that we can

1283
01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.080
undo that led to it. When you start to

1284
01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:34.080
expose that it's, you know, dozens of different actions

1285
01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.239
and different things over, you know, 20 to 30

1286
01:04:37.239 --> 01:04:40.689
years. It just shows you that it's a, the,

1287
01:04:40.729 --> 01:04:43.219
the problem is a bigger scope than you think.

1288
01:04:43.909 --> 01:04:47.040
And history can help us expose just how deep

1289
01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.959
these roots are, and that leads to different kinds

1290
01:04:49.959 --> 01:04:52.000
of solutions and different kinds of actions that need

1291
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.840
to be taken. So you're not just, you know,

1292
01:04:53.959 --> 01:04:56.560
dealing with the surface problem, you're really getting at

1293
01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.600
the roots, you're really getting at the, the true

1294
01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:00.919
causes of the problem. And I think clear dynamics

1295
01:05:00.919 --> 01:05:04.600
is really helpful in exposing that. The other thing

1296
01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.439
is that, you know, as, as we have talked

1297
01:05:07.439 --> 01:05:10.679
about, there are periods where inequality has grown high.

1298
01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:12.810
There are even periods where, you know, environmental and

1299
01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:16.679
ecological distress, like we're experiencing today, has been very

1300
01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:20.760
prominent. Some societies dealt with it really poorly and

1301
01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.469
collapsed. Some societies dealt with it a little bit

1302
01:05:23.469 --> 01:05:27.189
better and we're able to maintain some resilience. We

1303
01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:29.229
can learn lessons from that. We can, we can

1304
01:05:29.229 --> 01:05:32.199
see what people have done in the past when

1305
01:05:32.199 --> 01:05:34.739
facing the same kind of problems we're facing today,

1306
01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:37.750
both for good and bad. And this gives us

1307
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:40.310
options, right? Again, it's not, it's not a one

1308
01:05:40.310 --> 01:05:42.669
for one roadmap, right? It's not like, you know,

1309
01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:45.310
it's not historians should be, you know, the rulers

1310
01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:48.860
of us all. We have some ideas. We can

1311
01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.100
give you options. We can tell you what has

1312
01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:53.620
worked, what hasn't worked in in context, we can

1313
01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.850
tell you what is similar, what isn't similar today.

1314
01:05:56.729 --> 01:05:59.699
And this should form part of the conversation, not

1315
01:05:59.699 --> 01:06:02.219
the whole of it. But I think these ideas,

1316
01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:05.340
this understanding needs to be part of the discussions

1317
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:10.090
that advocates, that um NGOs, that government officials, that,

1318
01:06:10.179 --> 01:06:13.719
you know, UN officials, policymakers are having. ABOUT what

1319
01:06:13.719 --> 01:06:16.360
to do when we see inequality, what has worked

1320
01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.350
in the past? What has the context been? Can

1321
01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.719
we apply some of these lessons today? And I

1322
01:06:21.719 --> 01:06:23.840
think there are a lot that we can, we

1323
01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.320
have to, we have to reshape some of the

1324
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.439
things for our, our modern circumstances. But I think

1325
01:06:28.439 --> 01:06:31.530
it would be a mistake to overlook and ignore

1326
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.699
what history has to teach us, because, you know,

1327
01:06:36.239 --> 01:06:38.600
we are, we are, we are and always have

1328
01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.030
been humans responding to these kinds of pressures. And

1329
01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:44.909
the way that we have done that successfully and

1330
01:06:44.909 --> 01:06:49.149
unsuccessfully in the past, can really help narrow our

1331
01:06:49.149 --> 01:06:52.620
possibility space for, for where we're trying to go

1332
01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:54.629
uh today and in the future. So I, I

1333
01:06:54.629 --> 01:06:56.989
do think there is a major role for clear

1334
01:06:56.989 --> 01:06:59.530
dynamics in this kind of approach. And this is,

1335
01:06:59.709 --> 01:07:01.189
this is what we're, we're trying to be part

1336
01:07:01.189 --> 01:07:04.020
of these conversations um right now.

1337
01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:07.870
Great. So if people are interested, where can they

1338
01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:10.100
