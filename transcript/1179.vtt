00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:03.190
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.250
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.289
today I'm joined by Doctor Jaap de Hod. He

4
00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.130
is Samuel C. Dobbs, Professor in the Department of

5
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.450
Biology at Emory University, and today we're talking about

6
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.489
his book, Doctors by Nature How Ants, Apes, and

7
00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.930
Other Animals Heal Themselves. So, Doctor Duhode, welcome to

8
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.389
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:29.149
Thanks so much for having me.

10
00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:34.119
OK, so what is the premise of the book?

11
00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.599
I mean, uh, what do you explore there exactly

12
00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:42.349
in terms of how animals can produce, I guess,

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.819
and use their own medicines.

14
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.240
That's right, yeah, so I'm just, um, you know,

15
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.360
what, what I like about the book is like

16
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.759
just the pictures of animals and, uh, and that's

17
00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:54.490
really where, where it comes from. It's a fascination

18
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.259
with nature and with animals and Humans have a

19
00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:01.880
tendency to think they are special and, and especially

20
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.580
people in Western societies love the idea that we're

21
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.540
separate from nature and we have, we do things

22
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.819
that other species cannot do. And so for a

23
00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.260
long time, we thought that humans are the only

24
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.660
species that can use medicine and now we know

25
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.940
that a lot of different animals can use medicines

26
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.550
as well. So the book is really about Uh,

27
00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:21.559
all the evidence we have right now for all

28
00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:24.379
sorts of animals from ants to apes that use

29
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.959
medicines, that, that use drugs from nature to heal

30
00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:31.440
themselves or even heal each other. And also the

31
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.519
lessons we can learn from that because it turns

32
00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:37.599
out that animals have some really cool medical know-how

33
00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:39.919
that we can learn from, that we have learned

34
00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:43.480
from, and that we can actually learn from even

35
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.160
today and in the future to treat better our

36
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.319
own. Uh, PETS and our livestock, honey bees, but

37
00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.839
also discover drugs that we can use for ourselves.

38
00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:58.120
But how do we determine that a particular species

39
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.639
or a particular animal uses a natural product as

40
00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:05.160
medicine? What counts as medicine?

41
00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:10.328
That's a really good question and. Defining medicine is

42
00:02:10.328 --> 00:02:13.048
actually really difficult. And when I was writing the

43
00:02:13.048 --> 00:02:15.529
book, I actually tried to write a chapter on

44
00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.128
what is medicine, and in the end, that chapter

45
00:02:18.128 --> 00:02:19.679
didn't make it in the book. It was too

46
00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.889
confusing. Um, IF you ask, you know, anyone around

47
00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.809
you, you know, to define medicine, everyone is going

48
00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.569
to give a different answer. So what I focused

49
00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.869
the book on is talking about medication, using medicines

50
00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:34.768
or drugs. So I use medicines, drugs, as, as

51
00:02:34.768 --> 00:02:38.059
the same thing. Basically, compounds or chemicals that you

52
00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:42.539
can get from the environment, um, whether it's plants

53
00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:46.580
or fungi or animals, minerals that animals use or

54
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.210
humans use to treat their infections. And so that's

55
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.419
the other thing I really focused on is infectious

56
00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:57.240
diseases, whether it's bacteria or viruses, worms, uh, protozoans.

57
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.559
Basically things that make you sick. And so, Then

58
00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:04.080
really what it comes down to is finding the

59
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.679
evidence that an animal uses a compound from the

60
00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:11.360
environment when it is sick or to prevent it

61
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.080
from being sick, um, and that you can then

62
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.070
demonstrate that that compound actually has activity against the

63
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.039
parasites or the pathogens that it is infected with,

64
00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:25.149
and that it intentionally uses them. Only when it's

65
00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.470
needed. And so that is the, that those are

66
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.649
some of the criteria. And when you do that,

67
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.589
um, you can apply that to a lot of

68
00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.910
different animals and that's how we have discovered that

69
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.710
apes do it and ants and bees and all

70
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.649
sorts of other animals.

71
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.250
Mhm. So in the book you go through through

72
00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:45.509
4 different ways that animals use natural products to

73
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:52.070
fight infections and alleviate disease, namely prophylaxis, therapeutic medication,

74
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.990
body anointing, and fumigation. Could you explain each of

75
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.210
them before we go through examples?

76
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.000
Yeah, yeah, and so I, I'd say that the

77
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.039
one that's really the, the kind of the most

78
00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:06.360
um like what we do as when we use

79
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.800
medicines is therapeutic medication, right? So this is the

80
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.080
idea that when you are sick, you go and

81
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.279
use a medicine that then cures you of the

82
00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:19.130
disease or relieve it, relieves the disease symptoms. And

83
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.010
so this is the form of medicine that is

84
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.929
usually the most easy to demonstrate because what you're,

85
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.609
what you're doing, um, and to give an example,

86
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.130
so really, it started with chimpanzees actually in the

87
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.559
1980s. And so what, what primatologist Mike Hoffman, who

88
00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:38.609
works at Kyoto University, he worked together with a

89
00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:42.130
trad traditional healer in Tanzania. His name was Mohammadi,

90
00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:45.890
and they found that a chimpanzee was using particular

91
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.869
leaves from a plant called bitter leaf. And sucking

92
00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:52.470
the juices out of the pith of the branches,

93
00:04:53.049 --> 00:04:56.149
um, and that dislodged or killed parasites in, in

94
00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:58.790
the gut of the chimpanzee. So what you're looking

95
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.109
at then is, is a case where you see

96
00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:03.910
an animal who is sick. It uses a specific

97
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.070
plant in this case or a particular compound that

98
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.940
works against the disease. And then the animal recovers.

99
00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:14.059
Um, AND also related to that, and that comes

100
00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:16.579
back to your previous question, what is medicine, is

101
00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:19.220
that you can demonstrate that there are costs to

102
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.619
it as well. There are side effects. You know,

103
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.820
when you, we use medicines and we go through

104
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.260
the little leaflet that comes with the medicine and

105
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.299
we go to the pharmacy. It's all, all sorts

106
00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:29.100
of side effects and you see that in animals

107
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.429
too. So, therapeutic medication is really the use of

108
00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:36.290
medicines when you are already sick and you use

109
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.809
the medicines to treat that disease. And, and it

110
00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:41.809
doesn't have to be yourself, so animals can also

111
00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:45.790
do that to each other. Um, PROPHYLAXIS is kind

112
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.250
of preventative, and so this is the kind of

113
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.149
thing that, you know, when I travel to a

114
00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:54.549
country where there is a lot of malaria, I

115
00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:58.869
take prophylaxis. I start taking my anti-malarial tablets even

116
00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:01.390
before I go, right? And because the risk of

117
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.029
becoming infected is so high that it's worth taking

118
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:09.029
the medicine despite the side effects, um. Even before

119
00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.029
you go, because you know you're very likely to

120
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:13.779
get the disease. So animals do this too. It's

121
00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.609
a little bit harder to demonstrate, right? Because when

122
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.390
you see an animal that is sick and it

123
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.410
changes its behavior, now it uses a particular compound

124
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.630
and it, it recovers, that's easier to demonstrate. But

125
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.730
we have a lot of examples of, of prophylaxis

126
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:31.989
and um some of them, for example, there, there

127
00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:35.470
are particular primates that live in areas where there

128
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.950
is a lot of infectious with, with worms and

129
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.070
they start eating berries that have a lot of

130
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.029
toxins and they only do it in the areas

131
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:45.630
where there is a very high infection risk. And

132
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.220
so that is an example of, of prophylaxis. Body

133
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.619
anointing, that is, so anointing in, in human cultures

134
00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:56.899
often has the connotation of, uh, you know, religion,

135
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.179
so you get anointed, and, you know, in, in

136
00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:01.220
religion or, you know, the Queen of England or

137
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.540
the King of England gets anointed during the, the

138
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.260
ceremony. But it's also the use of repellents that

139
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.549
you smear into your skin or into your hair.

140
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.700
So when we apply mosquito spray, when we want

141
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.739
to prevent from being bitten by mosquitoes, that's anointing.

142
00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:18.859
And animals do that too. And so there are

143
00:07:18.859 --> 00:07:23.500
examples of lemurs and capuchins, and they use all

144
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.010
sorts of things, um, including sometimes they steal the

145
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.890
mosquito repellent from humans and start smearing it in

146
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.540
their own fur, um, but more naturally, what they

147
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.920
do is they use plants or even millipedes. So,

148
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:40.540
some millipedes produce really toxic, uh, substances that toxic

149
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.880
liquids that the millipedes use to protect themselves against

150
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.829
predators. And what the lemurs and, and capuchins do

151
00:07:46.829 --> 00:07:50.140
is they, they grab the millipedes, start pulling them

152
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.750
apart, and then, then smear all those liquids in

153
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.549
their fur and also in the fur of each

154
00:07:54.549 --> 00:07:57.670
other, and that stops them from being bitten by

155
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.670
mosquitoes and butterflies. So that's annoying thing. And then

156
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.690
the final one, like you mentioned is fumigation and

157
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.869
so this is You know, say you have an

158
00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:11.589
infestation of, of parasites in your house and, you

159
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:13.670
know, where I live in Atlanta, there, there are

160
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.579
quite a few, you know, houses where you may

161
00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:19.269
find cockroaches, for example. They are very, very common

162
00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:22.429
here in Atlanta, Georgia. And so people may actually

163
00:08:22.429 --> 00:08:24.790
call pest control and they come around and, and

164
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.829
fumigate your house to try to get rid of

165
00:08:26.829 --> 00:08:29.369
those. And, you also see it as part of

166
00:08:29.369 --> 00:08:31.989
mosquito control in a lot of different places where

167
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.289
they actually come in and, and mist your house

168
00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:37.808
with the mosquito spray. So that's basically creating this

169
00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:40.369
gas that then kills the, the things that make

170
00:08:40.369 --> 00:08:43.890
you sick or prevent them from coming in. And

171
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.049
so, animals do this too, and so birds do

172
00:08:47.049 --> 00:08:51.489
this often by putting Plants in their nests, very

173
00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:55.409
volatile, uh, plants with volatile chemicals that smell very

174
00:08:55.409 --> 00:08:58.450
strongly. Some even use cigarettes and put those in

175
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.729
their nests and that keeps all sorts of parasites

176
00:09:00.729 --> 00:09:04.719
away, whether that's uh mites or lice or ticks,

177
00:09:04.929 --> 00:09:07.570
things that eat blood of the, the chicks, and

178
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.369
that is a way to, to prevent that from

179
00:09:10.369 --> 00:09:10.950
happening.

180
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.880
Mhm. OK, so you've already mentioned a few examples

181
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.159
of each of these different kinds of uh therapeutic

182
00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:23.840
approaches that other animals use, but uh let me

183
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.239
ask you about some specific examples that you go

184
00:09:27.239 --> 00:09:28.960
through in the book. So when it comes to

185
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:34.039
prophylaxis, you talk about Japanese monkeys that eat antiparasitic

186
00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:38.000
plants in areas with parasites. So could you tell

187
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.760
us about that?

188
00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:42.049
Yeah, so that is, um, and like I said

189
00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:44.929
earlier, prophylaxis is often a little bit harder to,

190
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.359
to demonstrate. But so what, what people often do,

191
00:09:48.369 --> 00:09:50.330
and this was in the, indeed, when, when you

192
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.570
look across Japan, there is a lot of, there's

193
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.409
a very big gradient in the environment, um, in

194
00:09:56.409 --> 00:09:59.570
the climate, but also in the amount of parasites

195
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.210
that the animals encounter. And so what researchers did

196
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.690
is, is really look at all those different populations

197
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.169
of those Japanese monkeys and find that in areas

198
00:10:09.169 --> 00:10:12.049
where they're more likely to become infected, they use

199
00:10:12.049 --> 00:10:15.510
more of those, um. Uh, TOXIC plants that work

200
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.099
against those parasites. Um, AND that's similar to other

201
00:10:19.099 --> 00:10:22.159
species of primate in Africa that I mentioned earlier

202
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.690
where they live in areas with a lot of

203
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.219
infection risk. They eat more of the berries that

204
00:10:26.219 --> 00:10:28.299
can kill some of the parasitic worms.

205
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:34.219
Mhm. And an example of therapeutic medication is wooly

206
00:10:34.219 --> 00:10:39.239
bear caterpillars that use toxic alkaloids to kill parasitic

207
00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:41.859
fly maggots. Tell us about

208
00:10:41.859 --> 00:10:45.869
that. That's a great story. So, you know, it's,

209
00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:48.030
it's a great story in so many ways. First

210
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.830
of all, the, the, the, the, the parasites, in

211
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.150
this case, we're talking about a parasitoid fly. And

212
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.989
so what parasitoid flies do, they lay their eggs

213
00:10:57.989 --> 00:11:01.469
on the caterpillars and then the maggots hatch out

214
00:11:01.469 --> 00:11:03.710
and they eat their way into the insides of

215
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.349
the caterpillar. And then they grow and eat up

216
00:11:06.349 --> 00:11:09.049
the tissues of the caterpillar and they're, they're very

217
00:11:09.049 --> 00:11:11.729
clever in the sense that they, they don't eat

218
00:11:11.729 --> 00:11:15.219
the You know, the critical organs, so the caterpillar

219
00:11:15.219 --> 00:11:18.750
keeps living and eating, and so these maggots develop.

220
00:11:18.789 --> 00:11:21.109
And when the maggots are ready to pupate themselves,

221
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.469
to turn into an adult fly, they eat their

222
00:11:23.469 --> 00:11:25.789
way out of the caterpillar and basically at that

223
00:11:25.789 --> 00:11:28.429
point, the caterpillar dies. So they kind of burst

224
00:11:28.429 --> 00:11:31.500
out of the, the caterpillar and it's reminiscent of

225
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.429
the, the alien movie where you had the alien,

226
00:11:34.729 --> 00:11:38.250
you know, jumping out of, of the captain's stomach

227
00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:42.500
and um. You see, I, I'm, I'm, I'm smiling

228
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.489
because You know, when you study parasites, you, you

229
00:11:46.489 --> 00:11:50.010
start appreciating them. So it's, it's, it's ultimately gross,

230
00:11:50.049 --> 00:11:53.330
but it's also extremely fascinating. So, you know, I,

231
00:11:53.409 --> 00:11:55.609
I, I give, I, I definitely give love to

232
00:11:55.609 --> 00:11:58.210
the, to the victims, but I also give love

233
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.969
to the, to the parasites and, and then you

234
00:12:00.969 --> 00:12:02.690
probably see that in the book as well. But

235
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.650
um, yeah, and so what happens, so these wooly

236
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:10.099
bear caterpillars. They can eat, unlike a lot of

237
00:12:10.099 --> 00:12:11.820
other caterpillars, they can actually eat a lot of

238
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.219
different, different species of plant, and some of those

239
00:12:15.219 --> 00:12:18.659
plants contain alkaloids, and when they eat enough of

240
00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:22.599
those alkaloids, that actually kills the parasitoid flies. And

241
00:12:22.599 --> 00:12:25.869
it turns out that when they are infected, they

242
00:12:25.869 --> 00:12:28.780
prefer to eat food that is high in alkaloids,

243
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.469
and that then kills those flies. And, but it's

244
00:12:32.469 --> 00:12:34.830
really the, the story is so much cooler because

245
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:39.440
what researchers also did, they They stuck tiny little

246
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.799
electrodes in the taste buds of the caterpillars. So

247
00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:45.239
it turns out those caterpillars have 4 different taste

248
00:12:45.239 --> 00:12:48.679
buds, and one of those is specifically reacting to

249
00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:50.559
those alkaloids. So they have one taste bud that

250
00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:53.599
specifically tastes alkaloids, and when they put electrodes in

251
00:12:53.599 --> 00:12:58.059
those and then looked at infected and uninfected caterpillars,

252
00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.840
and they exposed them to the alkaloids, they saw

253
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.039
that those taste buds. In caterpillars that were infected

254
00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:06.710
started responding much more strongly. And so what that

255
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:10.080
means is that when the caterpillars are infected, the

256
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.919
alkaloids taste really good, and that's why they eat

257
00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:14.919
more and then they eat enough to kill the

258
00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:18.479
flies. And so it's a really beautiful example, not

259
00:13:18.479 --> 00:13:20.359
just of what they do, but how they do

260
00:13:20.359 --> 00:13:22.919
it and how the body tells them, you know,

261
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.000
eat these alkaloids, they taste good, they're good for

262
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.159
you.

263
00:13:25.979 --> 00:13:29.369
Yeah, when it comes to body anointing, one of

264
00:13:29.369 --> 00:13:31.500
the, one of the examples you give in the

265
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.659
book is the one of lemurs that rub anti-parasitic

266
00:13:35.659 --> 00:13:39.780
substances into their fur to deter parasites like lice,

267
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.919
mites, and mosquitoes, right?

268
00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:45.659
That's right. And you know, and, and I, and

269
00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:49.659
I will say it is very Um, it's a

270
00:13:49.659 --> 00:13:52.419
really nice example. We're not 100% sure yet that

271
00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:55.570
they really do adjust for the medicine part, because

272
00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.659
what you see these lemurs and the capuchins do,

273
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.140
they, you know, they, they kind of go in

274
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.200
this trance. They really enjoy it and, and And

275
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.799
also what they do is they do it to

276
00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:08.599
each other. So they start rubbing the, the millipedes

277
00:14:08.599 --> 00:14:11.349
or the other substances into each other's fur. So

278
00:14:11.349 --> 00:14:13.719
it also has a social function, right? So we

279
00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:15.960
don't know. Maybe they do it because it's fun

280
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.280
and it, it creates these social bonds, um, like,

281
00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:22.000
you know, people may go to the, to the

282
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.440
pub at night and share a beer and, you

283
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.150
know, as a social thing. And so it could

284
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.659
be that they do it for fun and social

285
00:14:29.659 --> 00:14:32.109
interactions and a, and a side effect is that

286
00:14:32.109 --> 00:14:35.640
it also prevents against infection or, you know, it's,

287
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.030
it's both of them and that's something that we

288
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.229
don't know 100% yet.

289
00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:44.840
Mhm. And finally, when it comes to fumigation, tell

290
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.719
us about the example of birds that line their

291
00:14:47.719 --> 00:14:52.820
nests with aromatic plants to kill mites, ticks, and

292
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.580
lice.

293
00:14:54.229 --> 00:14:57.580
Yeah, so this was. Well recognized. So in the

294
00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.140
1980s, there was the time when, um, when I

295
00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.020
said earlier, Mike Hoffman and Mohammadi, when they discovered

296
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.340
that chimpanzees can use therapeutic medication. The 1980s, people

297
00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.859
also realized that a lot of birds put these

298
00:15:10.859 --> 00:15:15.219
aromatic plants into their, their nests and So there

299
00:15:15.219 --> 00:15:17.099
were a lot of different hypotheses for why they

300
00:15:17.099 --> 00:15:19.340
did it, but some people said they probably do

301
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.219
it to keep parasites away. And so then you

302
00:15:22.219 --> 00:15:25.020
can do experiments and see where, you know, if

303
00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.179
the birds collect more of the plants that they

304
00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:30.020
end up with fewer parasites. But really the best

305
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.424
evidence for That kind of fumigation has come more

306
00:15:33.424 --> 00:15:37.695
recently from studies in Mexico City where researchers found

307
00:15:37.695 --> 00:15:41.075
that birds, and in this case it's finches and

308
00:15:41.075 --> 00:15:45.015
sparrows, that they line their nests with cigarette butts

309
00:15:45.234 --> 00:15:49.590
and it's, it's a really interesting story. Um, AND

310
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:53.059
so, Monte Suarez Rodriguez, who was an undergraduate student,

311
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.960
actually starting this project, she started her project really

312
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.799
trying to find out what is the effect of

313
00:15:58.799 --> 00:16:02.150
cities and urbanization on the nest building of birds,

314
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.400
and she had this idea that all the trash

315
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.760
that people put in, put out ends up in

316
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.080
nests and maybe it's really bad for the chicks.

317
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:14.450
And then she found this white fluffy material. In

318
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.530
some of the nests, and she couldn't figure out

319
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.200
what it was until it rained and then she

320
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.010
smelled the smoke, and that's when she realized, oh,

321
00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:24.049
they're the cigarettes, so it's the filters of the

322
00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:26.650
cigarette butt, so people will smoke and then throw

323
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.929
their their, the filter on the floor when they're

324
00:16:28.929 --> 00:16:31.080
done, and then the birds would collect them and

325
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.950
then pull all of all the fibers out and

326
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.909
put it in their nest. And then what she

327
00:16:35.909 --> 00:16:38.309
found is that when the birds have more of

328
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:39.989
these cigarette butts in their nests, so some of

329
00:16:39.989 --> 00:16:42.150
them have more than 30 of these butts in

330
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.820
their nests, they had fewer parasites. Um, AND then

331
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.539
what, what she did, and that's really cool, then

332
00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:49.750
she did a real cool experiment where she could

333
00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.929
actually create or manipulate the nests of the birds

334
00:16:53.109 --> 00:16:55.270
to make them all the same. And then in

335
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.150
some of the nests, she added ticks that were

336
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.510
alive and could suck the blood of the, the

337
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.380
chicks or ticks that were dead or no ticks

338
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.880
at all. And then she would see how many

339
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.160
butts, the cigarette butts, the birds would collect and

340
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.229
finally when there's live ticks, they collect a lot

341
00:17:11.229 --> 00:17:14.439
more cigarette butts. And so it's a really direct

342
00:17:14.439 --> 00:17:18.319
response to the parasites in the nest and that

343
00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:21.670
helped the chicks. They, you know, they survive better,

344
00:17:21.719 --> 00:17:25.250
they fledge the, the nest, um, but again, also,

345
00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:27.680
it's a medicine and as you can imagine, you

346
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.319
know, we know smoking isn't good. And it's also

347
00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:32.760
not good for birds, and so there were some

348
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.359
effects on their, their blood cells, so it helped

349
00:17:35.359 --> 00:17:37.839
against parasites, but there were also side effects of

350
00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:39.859
the, of the use of the cigarettes.

351
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.439
Mhm. Do the animals know at all that they

352
00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:48.920
are medicating themselves and how can we study that?

353
00:17:49.719 --> 00:17:53.079
Yeah, so that's a really great question. And this

354
00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:57.030
has been the question. Or the idea that animals

355
00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.530
know or need to know what they're doing, I

356
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.719
think has really stood in the way of our

357
00:18:01.719 --> 00:18:05.729
progress in understanding animals using medicine. And even in

358
00:18:05.729 --> 00:18:09.770
the 1980s when Mohammadi and, and Hoffmann, when they

359
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.969
really first described the experiments with chimpanzees, a lot

360
00:18:12.969 --> 00:18:16.729
of people just didn't believe it. And scientists were

361
00:18:16.729 --> 00:18:19.250
really skeptical and they said there is just no

362
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:22.780
way that, that animals can do this. And You

363
00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.989
know, then people slowly started accepting it and, and

364
00:18:26.989 --> 00:18:29.380
they could because they said, well, chimpanzees are very

365
00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.410
much like humans, right? And even with my own

366
00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:35.969
work, when I started looking at this in monarch

367
00:18:35.969 --> 00:18:38.180
butterflies, there were so many people who said, there's

368
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.380
just no way. They, they, they're not smart enough,

369
00:18:40.459 --> 00:18:43.390
they don't have the capacity to do this. So,

370
00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.250
my, my response to do they know? Maybe some

371
00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.349
of them. I think a lot of them don't.

372
00:18:51.369 --> 00:18:53.890
Not in the way that we know what we're

373
00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.170
doing. Um, BUT I gave you the example of

374
00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.530
the, the wooly bear caterpillars, and it's so cool,

375
00:18:58.609 --> 00:19:01.130
right? Because you, you have a case there where

376
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:05.130
the caterpillar is infected and then the body tells

377
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.250
the caterpillar, eat these alkaloids because they taste good,

378
00:19:08.489 --> 00:19:10.650
right? The caterpillar doesn't need to know it's infected.

379
00:19:10.729 --> 00:19:12.969
The caterpillar doesn't need to know that the alkaloids

380
00:19:12.969 --> 00:19:15.250
are going to help. Um, ALL it needs to

381
00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.000
know is that if I eat alkaloids, you know,

382
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.050
they taste good. And so I think there's this

383
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.439
In a way, different levels of knowledge, right? So

384
00:19:23.439 --> 00:19:26.609
when we think, does some, someone know, we think

385
00:19:26.609 --> 00:19:30.780
about using our, you know, big brain and really

386
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.239
thinking about, oh, I'm gonna use this because I

387
00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:35.709
know it's going to help me and I know

388
00:19:35.709 --> 00:19:38.010
that because there have been trials and the doctors

389
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.010
told me and everything. But I think there's also

390
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.770
a lot of things, even humans, a lot of

391
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:45.369
things we do without thinking about it. Um, AND

392
00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:47.930
so I think for most animals, they probably don't

393
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.969
know they're using the medication and But that doesn't

394
00:19:51.969 --> 00:19:54.430
mean they're not using it. Um, THEY'RE using medicine,

395
00:19:54.449 --> 00:19:56.410
it helps them, but they don't have to be

396
00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.489
aware, consciously aware of what they're doing.

397
00:19:59.209 --> 00:20:05.209
Mhm. And are these behaviors learned or innate in

398
00:20:05.209 --> 00:20:05.910
some way?

399
00:20:06.489 --> 00:20:09.650
So they can be both, and so again with

400
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.290
the wooly bear caterpillars, they don't learn it. It's

401
00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.569
their, their body telling them this tastes good, eat

402
00:20:15.569 --> 00:20:18.449
it. There are also a lot of animals that

403
00:20:18.449 --> 00:20:23.510
can learn and really good experiments from sheep and

404
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:27.410
goats. There's been really wonderful research at Utah State

405
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.520
University for many decades now, where people have done

406
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.969
experiments with sheep and with goats and cattle. And

407
00:20:33.969 --> 00:20:36.739
what you can do is, um, for example, what,

408
00:20:36.869 --> 00:20:39.229
what they can do is they have sheep that

409
00:20:39.229 --> 00:20:42.530
are infected with worms or not, give them different

410
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.160
foods, and then They, they realize, or, or, you

411
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.239
know, some of the foods in this case, it's

412
00:20:48.239 --> 00:20:51.319
particular food with tannins. Tannins are the chemicals um

413
00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:53.599
that a lot of plants produce. If, if you're

414
00:20:53.599 --> 00:20:55.479
a fan of red wine and, you know, you

415
00:20:55.479 --> 00:20:58.040
have kind of that like that, that stringent that

416
00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.319
the feeling that your mouth kind of gets sucked

417
00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:03.439
together, that's the, that's the effect of tannins. And

418
00:21:03.439 --> 00:21:07.390
the, um, so, so. Goats and sheep don't like

419
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.750
those, but when they eat that, when they're infected,

420
00:21:09.829 --> 00:21:13.150
what happens is actually, it helps them clear parasitic

421
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.540
worms in their guts. And now they have made

422
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.699
that association. And so the next time they have

423
00:21:18.699 --> 00:21:22.780
the symptoms of the parasites, they will specifically choose

424
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.500
that food when they are given the choices. And

425
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.489
so that means they have learned from their experience,

426
00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:31.900
they have learned through association. They associated the consumption

427
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.819
of particular plants with recovery from this disease, and

428
00:21:36.819 --> 00:21:39.140
so they'll use it next time. So that's individual

429
00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.310
learning. Um, BUT coming back to your earlier question,

430
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.660
do they need to know what they're doing? And

431
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.630
the answer is no. They're making that association. They

432
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.670
don't know what is in the food. They don't

433
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.709
know that they have worms, but they, what they

434
00:21:53.709 --> 00:21:56.310
know is they have discomfort, right? They have symptoms

435
00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:02.030
of infection, and they, their body has learned that

436
00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:07.349
by eating particular plants that discomfort disappears and You

437
00:22:07.349 --> 00:22:10.209
know, so, so even, and, and, and, and the

438
00:22:10.209 --> 00:22:13.390
researchers have shown that even but you can create

439
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:19.150
these associations when the animals are under anesthesia. So

440
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.839
you can put them to sleep. And then give

441
00:22:21.839 --> 00:22:25.750
them particular foods and, and that relief relieve symptoms

442
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.010
or not, and then the animal learns it. So

443
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.319
the animal doesn't even have to be awake to

444
00:22:30.319 --> 00:22:32.599
learn it. It's, it's really the body learning it,

445
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.239
right? So, again, it comes with the question, with

446
00:22:35.239 --> 00:22:36.900
individual learning, do they know it? They don't have

447
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.119
to know it. They don't have to be consciously

448
00:22:39.119 --> 00:22:39.359
aware.

449
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:44.660
Mhm. Uh, Tell us about your research on monarch

450
00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:49.079
butterflies and how they use milkweeds against parasites.

451
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.290
Sure, yeah. So I Came to monarch butterflies in

452
00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:57.810
2005 and I always like telling people, I don't

453
00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.050
study monarch butterflies because they're pretty, but because they

454
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.010
become sick. And you know, monarch butterflies are very

455
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.369
famous. They're very pretty and they migrate thousands of

456
00:23:07.369 --> 00:23:11.760
miles or, or kilometers either way, thousands um from

457
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.449
Canada and the United States down to Mexico every

458
00:23:14.449 --> 00:23:18.959
fall. So they're really, really impressive creatures. They're I,

459
00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.359
I was interested because they become infected and they

460
00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:23.400
become infected with a parasite that is a little

461
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.079
bit like the malaria parasites that infect us, the

462
00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:30.359
same general group of protozoan parasites. Um, AND those

463
00:23:30.359 --> 00:23:33.660
parasites can make the monarchs very sick, so, The

464
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.699
monarchs get infected with these parasites. They grow into

465
00:23:36.699 --> 00:23:40.579
tissues and then ultimately they essentially poke little holes

466
00:23:40.579 --> 00:23:43.829
in the abdomen of the adult butterfly that sometimes

467
00:23:43.829 --> 00:23:45.819
it gets stuck in the pupal case. If not,

468
00:23:45.859 --> 00:23:48.939
they kind of can die really quickly from dehydration.

469
00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.199
They cannot fly very well, so it's a very

470
00:23:51.199 --> 00:23:54.380
detrimental parasite. And so this is what I was

471
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:59.239
really interested in and Monarch butterflies, unlike the wooly

472
00:23:59.239 --> 00:24:02.479
bear caterpillars that we mentioned, monarch butterflies are very

473
00:24:02.479 --> 00:24:05.239
much specialized on milkweeds, so they can only eat

474
00:24:05.239 --> 00:24:08.439
milkweeds as caterpillars, but they can eat multiple species.

475
00:24:08.599 --> 00:24:11.040
So in North America, we have about 30 species

476
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.680
that they can use, and those species vary in

477
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.079
the concentrations of toxic chemicals called cardenolides, and these

478
00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:20.719
are the, the chemicals. If, you know, if we

479
00:24:20.719 --> 00:24:24.589
eat milkweeds, some species would be OK, but I

480
00:24:24.589 --> 00:24:27.069
always tell my students don't eat milkweed because they

481
00:24:27.069 --> 00:24:30.510
have evolved these chemicals to kill and so, you

482
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:33.270
know, those chemicals actually can stop our heart, so

483
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:36.750
it's really bad. But monarchs are, are mostly resistant

484
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:40.650
to these chemicals and um So when I first

485
00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:43.739
started working on the monarchs and growing the milkweeds,

486
00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:46.290
and I'm really thinking about the different types of

487
00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.729
milkweeds that the monarchs use, for me it was

488
00:24:48.729 --> 00:24:52.050
a very logical question to ask if the different

489
00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.369
milkweeds with different concentrations, if, if some of the

490
00:24:55.369 --> 00:24:58.069
plants that have really high concentrations of these chemicals,

491
00:24:58.369 --> 00:25:01.199
if they could work against the parasites. And so

492
00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:03.560
then we did experiments where we had monarchs that

493
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.000
we reared in the lab on the different species

494
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.739
of milkweed, the monarchs were infected or not, and

495
00:25:08.739 --> 00:25:12.239
then I found that the monarchs, when they eat

496
00:25:12.239 --> 00:25:15.420
plants with high concentrations of these cardenolites, so more

497
00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.239
toxic plants, it reduces the probability of infection, so

498
00:25:19.239 --> 00:25:21.640
the monarchs are less likely to become sick in

499
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.079
the first place. When they do get infected, they

500
00:25:24.079 --> 00:25:28.170
become less sick. And so, It was really in

501
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.689
that sense of medicinal. Some of these milkweeds are

502
00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:33.130
medicinal. And then the next question was, OK, well,

503
00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:36.790
if that's the case, can monarchs use this and

504
00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.969
when they are sick, specifically use those medicinal milkweeds.

505
00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:46.540
How about apes that swallow lives to dislodge worms?

506
00:25:47.689 --> 00:25:51.739
So that is uh another great example of, um,

507
00:25:51.969 --> 00:25:54.130
so, so a lot of the, the examples we

508
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.930
have talked about so far are really chemical and

509
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.689
so, you know, with the, like I just mentioned,

510
00:25:59.699 --> 00:26:03.569
the monarch butterflies and, um, but, but they, but

511
00:26:03.569 --> 00:26:05.650
they do and actually let, let me tell you

512
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:08.369
that before I get to the, to the hairy

513
00:26:08.369 --> 00:26:12.800
leaves in the, in the chimpanzees, but um Yeah,

514
00:26:12.949 --> 00:26:15.680
so the monarchs use these high cardenolite species and

515
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.239
in fact when you give them choices, the caterpillars

516
00:26:19.239 --> 00:26:22.439
don't actually make choices, and it's the mothers that

517
00:26:22.439 --> 00:26:24.750
do. So what we have found is that the

518
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.359
mother monarch butterflies, when they lay eggs, when they

519
00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:29.719
are infected, and the way that works is when

520
00:26:29.719 --> 00:26:32.479
they're infected, they pass on some of those parasites

521
00:26:32.479 --> 00:26:34.160
to the eggs that they're laying and then the

522
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.280
caterpillars become infected when they come out of the

523
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.680
eggs. And So, but, but what the mothers can

524
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.479
do is when they have choices, they prefer to

525
00:26:41.479 --> 00:26:44.319
lay their eggs on those more medicinal milkweeds, and

526
00:26:44.319 --> 00:26:47.660
that then reduces infection in their future offspring. So

527
00:26:48.729 --> 00:26:52.569
that's based on chemicals. Um, EARLIER I mentioned chimpanzees

528
00:26:52.569 --> 00:26:56.329
that use the, the bitter leaf plant and use

529
00:26:56.329 --> 00:27:00.270
the toxic chemicals from the, from the plants. Um,

530
00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:03.089
WE have talked about, you know, cigarettes in, in

531
00:27:03.089 --> 00:27:05.449
nests and that is based on the nicotine as

532
00:27:05.449 --> 00:27:07.890
well as other chemicals in the smoked cigarette butts

533
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.079
that work against parasites. And so, but yeah, there's

534
00:27:12.079 --> 00:27:15.780
other forms, and so the chimpanzees, in addition to

535
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.640
using chemicals, they can also use mechanical medication if

536
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.569
you like. So, And this goes back, I think,

537
00:27:23.609 --> 00:27:27.930
to the 1960s. Jane Goodall had already noticed that

538
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.449
sometimes when you look at the dung of chimpanzees,

539
00:27:30.489 --> 00:27:33.010
it has leaves in it that are not fully

540
00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.609
digested. And so what that means is that the

541
00:27:35.609 --> 00:27:38.849
chimpanzees swallow leaves and just swallow them completely. Don't,

542
00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:41.369
don't chew them, they don't digest them and then

543
00:27:41.369 --> 00:27:46.160
pass them into their stool. And So the question

544
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.640
then was why, why are they doing that? And

545
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.160
so also in the 1980s and the 1990s, it

546
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.219
was Mike Hoffman and a lot of his colleagues

547
00:27:54.219 --> 00:27:58.109
really showing That's what all these leaves have in

548
00:27:58.109 --> 00:28:00.400
common is they're very rough. They have a lot

549
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.640
of hairs on them. So it's like, it's a

550
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.920
little bit like, like sandpaper and so you, you

551
00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.479
can imagine swallowing that is really not fun. And

552
00:28:09.479 --> 00:28:12.000
so actually what the chimpanzees do is they fold

553
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.449
the leaves, so they become smaller and then swallow

554
00:28:14.449 --> 00:28:17.239
them. And then what they found is that because

555
00:28:17.239 --> 00:28:22.030
they're all very hairy, they basically, um, Take the

556
00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:24.630
parasites out of the gut because the parasites, so

557
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.750
we're talking about worms, they get stuck in those

558
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.709
hairs. It's like a Velcro and they get stuck,

559
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.869
um, and then they get pooped out. And the

560
00:28:31.869 --> 00:28:33.709
other thing that the leaves do is because they're

561
00:28:33.709 --> 00:28:36.510
so rough, they, they really irritate the gut, so

562
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.390
the chimpanzees will get diarrhea and really purge those

563
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.670
parasites out of their system and they can use

564
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.729
a lot of different leaves to do this. A

565
00:28:45.729 --> 00:28:47.170
lot of different plants, but what they have in

566
00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.770
common, they're always very rough. It's like, uh, yeah,

567
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.119
and that, that's what, what Hoffman told me is

568
00:28:52.119 --> 00:28:54.290
that it's like the Velcro effect because if you

569
00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.329
pull a worm off it, it, it sounds like

570
00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:59.609
this Velcro strip. So, yeah, it's a really cool

571
00:28:59.609 --> 00:29:01.449
example of how animals do this.

572
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.319
Another great example that you explore in the book

573
00:29:05.319 --> 00:29:09.310
has to do with bees that incorporate sticky resin

574
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:12.280
into their hives to combat pathogens,

575
00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:17.479
right? Correct, yeah. So this is a really intriguing

576
00:29:17.479 --> 00:29:20.280
again because, you know, people have known for a

577
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.680
long time that honey bees produce propolis, and so

578
00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.280
propolis is a mix of the resin that they

579
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.979
collect from trees and other plants, and they mix

580
00:29:28.979 --> 00:29:31.160
it with the wax and then they make it

581
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.020
into this substance called propolis. And then what, what

582
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.359
wild bees do is they line their whole nest

583
00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:39.640
because wild bees, they would make their nests in

584
00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.589
a hollow tree that has a lot of crevices

585
00:29:41.589 --> 00:29:44.089
and a lot of rough surfaces. And they put

586
00:29:44.089 --> 00:29:48.849
this stuff all over it. Um, AND so, and

587
00:29:48.849 --> 00:29:52.000
our honey bees, when we use them in beekeeping,

588
00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.650
they do it too. And actually beekeepers find it

589
00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:57.329
really annoying because what they, what the bees do

590
00:29:57.329 --> 00:29:59.229
is they put it at the top where the

591
00:29:59.229 --> 00:30:01.770
lid closes the box and so then you have

592
00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:04.290
to pry it open. So they basically just scrape

593
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.660
it off and remove it all the time. But

594
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.500
the funny thing is that people have used propolis

595
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.819
as medicine for a really long time. So you

596
00:30:11.819 --> 00:30:14.189
can go to some places in South America, for

597
00:30:14.189 --> 00:30:16.500
example, and find propolis on every corner of every

598
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.719
street because people use it for all sorts of,

599
00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.540
you know, health issues, whether it's, it's colds or

600
00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.540
other things. So people have known it's medicinal, but

601
00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.579
no one seemed to think that honeybees use it

602
00:30:28.579 --> 00:30:30.459
for the same reason. So they just thought it

603
00:30:30.459 --> 00:30:33.859
was some kind of cement that they use. Um,

604
00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.790
BUT now we know, based on a lot of

605
00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.219
beautiful experiments. That the honey bees, um, when they

606
00:30:40.219 --> 00:30:43.719
collect this resin, make this propolis, it helps against

607
00:30:43.719 --> 00:30:48.780
viruses and bacteria, even against those varroa destructor mites,

608
00:30:48.859 --> 00:30:51.780
the mites that are really detrimental to the honeybees

609
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.699
and they spread viruses, um, and, and what is

610
00:30:55.699 --> 00:30:58.780
intriguing too is that, you know, so what beekeepers

611
00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.810
have done is essentially Take the bees out of

612
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:04.150
those hollow trees, right, and put them in these

613
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:06.770
boxes made of smooth planks, and there's nowhere for

614
00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:08.849
the bees to put the propolis. The only place

615
00:31:08.849 --> 00:31:10.569
they can put it is at the top where

616
00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:14.280
the beekeepers don't like it. But, so researchers from

617
00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.680
the United States Department of Agriculture and University of

618
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.599
Minnesota, they have shown that if you just make

619
00:31:20.599 --> 00:31:24.000
grooves in those planks, there's all that space again

620
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.479
for the honeybees to fill up and then they'll

621
00:31:26.479 --> 00:31:28.599
put that propolis in there. And so you can

622
00:31:28.599 --> 00:31:33.520
actually reintroduce that medication by the honeybees into the

623
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.959
beekeeping uh practices that we use. So, it's a

624
00:31:36.959 --> 00:31:39.310
really easy and cheap way to bring back that

625
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.180
medicine and let the bees help themselves.

626
00:31:42.489 --> 00:31:47.160
Mhm. Uh, YOU also talk about animals that host

627
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.199
microbes to help them against infections. Could you tell

628
00:31:50.199 --> 00:31:54.479
us about the example of salamanders that host bacteria

629
00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:59.160
on their skin, uh, that inhibit deadly fungi?

630
00:32:00.459 --> 00:32:04.780
Yes, so we know that, you know, the microbiome,

631
00:32:04.859 --> 00:32:07.819
so basically the microbes that live in our bodies

632
00:32:07.819 --> 00:32:10.420
and on our bodies, we, we just learn more

633
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.300
and more about them and find out that in

634
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.579
many cases they're really important for maintaining health and

635
00:32:15.579 --> 00:32:18.459
that they can also really help against infections. And

636
00:32:18.459 --> 00:32:20.339
so we, we have plenty of examples of our

637
00:32:20.339 --> 00:32:23.939
own gut flora, right, when that gets disrupted, we

638
00:32:23.939 --> 00:32:27.000
may get really big issues with some bacterial infections.

639
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:29.989
And so we see that, we increasingly see that

640
00:32:29.989 --> 00:32:33.510
in animals too. And yes, so for some of

641
00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:37.430
the salamanders and other amphibians, they, they essentially have

642
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:39.349
bacteria living on their skin. So we have known

643
00:32:39.349 --> 00:32:42.670
for a while that they have toxins that work

644
00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:46.719
against predators, but also fungal parasites in this case.

645
00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.410
And then we didn't really know where those toxins

646
00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:51.010
were coming from, and it turns out that it's

647
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:54.050
actually the microbes living on the skin that produced

648
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:57.890
them. So if that gets disrupted, that is, you

649
00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:01.819
know, then they become more prone to infections. And

650
00:33:01.819 --> 00:33:04.219
so that kind of knowledge is really interesting. What

651
00:33:04.219 --> 00:33:07.739
we don't know yet is if animals can use

652
00:33:07.739 --> 00:33:10.859
that as, as medication, right? So we know some

653
00:33:10.859 --> 00:33:14.300
examples of animals eating dirt, um, so whether it's

654
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.500
soil or clay and, and there is different hypotheses

655
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.239
for why they do that. So one of them

656
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.739
is that they get minerals and can neutralize toxins

657
00:33:22.739 --> 00:33:25.420
in their, in their guts, but another hypothesis is

658
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.900
that they do it to obtain the microbes to,

659
00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.780
to get the right microbes that protect them against

660
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.209
diseases. And so that research is only really just

661
00:33:34.209 --> 00:33:36.650
starting. So, what we know now is that there

662
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:39.689
are microbes that they help against infections and the

663
00:33:39.689 --> 00:33:42.800
next step is, you know, in terms of probiotics,

664
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.359
do animals do, do a good job of that

665
00:33:45.359 --> 00:33:47.729
and do they know what microbes to get for

666
00:33:47.729 --> 00:33:49.689
when they need them? And that's hopefully in the

667
00:33:49.689 --> 00:33:51.489
next few years we get some examples there.

668
00:33:52.829 --> 00:33:57.670
So during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were many people

669
00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.150
who were bothered by the fact that they had

670
00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:04.229
to socially distance themselves and some of them had

671
00:34:04.229 --> 00:34:07.469
to be quarantined and things like that, but there

672
00:34:07.469 --> 00:34:11.909
are non-human, other non-human animals that also use social

673
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:14.580
distancing to avoid infecting others,

674
00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.728
correct. Yeah, it's really interesting. So, as I said

675
00:34:18.728 --> 00:34:20.648
before, my, my book very much focused on the

676
00:34:20.648 --> 00:34:23.049
use of medicines and drugs, right, but there are

677
00:34:23.049 --> 00:34:27.447
so many other ways that animals also protect themselves

678
00:34:27.447 --> 00:34:31.608
and each other against infections. And so social distancing

679
00:34:31.608 --> 00:34:34.089
is not something that humans came up with, and

680
00:34:34.089 --> 00:34:36.368
we see that in all sorts of other animals

681
00:34:36.368 --> 00:34:40.000
there are Examples in, in bees and ants, for

682
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.580
example, that when they're infected, they start keeping their

683
00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:46.560
distance and so they start interacting with fewer individuals

684
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.699
in the colonies. Um, THERE'S also a quarantine. Um,

685
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.918
AND there's also practices that we would as humans

686
00:34:53.918 --> 00:34:57.520
probably not approve of. So, in honey bees, for

687
00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:01.199
example, when they detect there is infected individuals, they

688
00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:03.040
take them and dump them out of the, the

689
00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.040
colony. So, and they won't let them back in.

690
00:35:05.149 --> 00:35:08.320
So that's an extreme form of, of quarantine. Um,

691
00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.760
SOME ants actually when they, when they realize they're

692
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.310
sick, they, they leave the nest and die in

693
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:19.020
isolation. So it's a form of, you know, Basically

694
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:23.290
removing yourself from the colony to stop, um. You

695
00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:27.870
know, spreading disease. We now have examples of queen

696
00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:31.370
ants that eat worker ants that are infected, so

697
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.510
it's, it's cannibalism to stop the spread of infection.

698
00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:38.090
And recent examples also show that ants can do

699
00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:41.689
surgery, which is really amazing. So they can actually,

700
00:35:41.929 --> 00:35:44.370
when, when they realize there's an injured leg or

701
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.449
a leg that is infected with bacteria or a

702
00:35:47.449 --> 00:35:50.530
fungus, they can actually cut off the leg to

703
00:35:50.729 --> 00:35:53.050
stop the spread of that, that infection to the

704
00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:55.909
rest of the body of the ant. So yeah,

705
00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:00.679
I think it's just intriguing because All these things,

706
00:36:01.219 --> 00:36:04.020
you know, that we use for medical interventions. If

707
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.179
you look carefully, they're out there, other animals use

708
00:36:07.179 --> 00:36:07.620
them too.

709
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.219
Yeah, I, I see, I saw that by reading

710
00:36:12.219 --> 00:36:15.879
your book. So what is the importance of learning

711
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:20.280
when it comes to animals protecting themselves from disease?

712
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.719
There are many different answers to that, and I'll

713
00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:28.800
start with my fundamental answer, which is that I,

714
00:36:28.959 --> 00:36:32.219
I feel like we We have a duty to

715
00:36:32.219 --> 00:36:35.100
understand our natural role and, you know, for me

716
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.780
that's very easy because I love animals and I

717
00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:41.139
love nature, but I think it's just so important

718
00:36:41.139 --> 00:36:44.139
to understand what is out there and understand animals

719
00:36:44.139 --> 00:36:47.850
for who they are and what they use. And

720
00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.979
I think that's also important from a preservation, conservation

721
00:36:51.979 --> 00:36:54.860
point of view, right? When oftentimes when we think

722
00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.459
of nature conservation, We think about, OK, we need

723
00:36:58.459 --> 00:37:02.260
to protect the food and the habitat of the

724
00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.100
animals. We hardly ever think about, OK, what, what

725
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.060
are the medicines that they need. But just like

726
00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.260
humans, they need food, they need shelter, they need

727
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.020
medicine, and so that really changes the way we

728
00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:16.060
think about preserving the right habitats and environments for

729
00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.780
these animals. So I think that's, that, that's really

730
00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:22.479
the natural answer. There's also more like a human

731
00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:26.209
application answer, and that is that When we think

732
00:37:26.209 --> 00:37:29.330
about our own health, and we think about the

733
00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:32.209
drugs and the medicines that we use, even today,

734
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:36.129
most of those still come from nature and most

735
00:37:36.129 --> 00:37:39.560
of that is from plants. So, We can, we

736
00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.399
can look at, at the medicines we use. Um,

737
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.959
ASPIRIN is a great example. So aspirin is, is

738
00:37:45.959 --> 00:37:48.600
a drug that most of us have used at

739
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.510
some point in our lives. It's one of the,

740
00:37:50.739 --> 00:37:54.479
the most widely sold pharmaceutical drugs on the planet.

741
00:37:55.129 --> 00:37:57.959
And it's a beautiful little white pill, and by

742
00:37:57.959 --> 00:38:00.159
looking at that, you may not realize that this

743
00:38:00.159 --> 00:38:03.669
was actually discovered by bears to start with because

744
00:38:03.889 --> 00:38:06.790
what bears do when they come out of hibernation,

745
00:38:06.889 --> 00:38:09.620
as you can imagine, lying still for months on

746
00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.840
end is not good for your body, so they're

747
00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.889
really sore and stiff when they come out out

748
00:38:13.889 --> 00:38:15.649
of hibernation. The first thing they do is they

749
00:38:15.649 --> 00:38:18.770
eat the, the bark of willow trees, which has

750
00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:22.290
a lot of salicylic acid and that reduces inflammation

751
00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:25.379
and relieves pain and everything like that. And people

752
00:38:25.379 --> 00:38:28.139
have known this for thousands of years and so

753
00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:31.699
they started copying that behavior and then ultimately, it

754
00:38:31.699 --> 00:38:36.280
was rediscovered in the 1700s in, in Britain and

755
00:38:36.419 --> 00:38:40.449
then the people, you know, extracted the chemicals and

756
00:38:40.449 --> 00:38:43.020
then later changed that chemical formula a little bit

757
00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.780
to make aspirin. But I think it's a great

758
00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.419
example to show that. You know, by looking at

759
00:38:48.419 --> 00:38:50.639
nature, we can learn and some of the, the

760
00:38:50.639 --> 00:38:55.120
most important, um, medicines we have come from nature.

761
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.439
And so by looking at animals, we can learn

762
00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.530
new things that we can use for ourselves. We

763
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.340
can learn about medicines we can use to improve

764
00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.770
the health of our own, uh, pets, our livestock,

765
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:11.610
our honey bees. We mentioned earlier, the honeybees. Honeybees

766
00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.760
aren't doing well. Um, AND part of the reason

767
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.840
is that we took away their medicine, but we

768
00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.159
can reintroduce it, right? And we wouldn't have known

769
00:39:19.159 --> 00:39:21.760
that if we hadn't done the research that was

770
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.120
really just driven by, I want to know what

771
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.679
these animals are doing and so you can bring

772
00:39:26.679 --> 00:39:28.719
that back. So it's, it's good for the animals,

773
00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.169
it's good for us, and yeah, nature has a

774
00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:34.090
lot to offer that we can still learn from.

775
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:38.780
And when it comes to animals protecting themselves from

776
00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:43.780
disease, another couple of things that they can experience

777
00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.959
is nausea and neophobia, correct?

778
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.080
Yes. So I think what, what is interesting about,

779
00:39:53.199 --> 00:39:56.879
so, so the, the neophobia that really comes in,

780
00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.760
you know, about how animals learn what to use

781
00:40:00.239 --> 00:40:03.699
and So most animals are very conservative when it

782
00:40:03.699 --> 00:40:09.260
comes to eating food and specifically new things. And

783
00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.219
that is, um, you know, that actually protects animals

784
00:40:12.219 --> 00:40:14.820
a lot against eating the wrong things. But it

785
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.860
also means that, you know, that, that's sometimes very

786
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.040
important when you think about how do animals learn

787
00:40:20.459 --> 00:40:23.100
what medicines to use, what medicinal plants to use.

788
00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.580
Sometimes they need that experience from other individuals so

789
00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.209
they can learn from each other that it is

790
00:40:28.209 --> 00:40:31.239
OK to eat a particular thing. Um, SO that's

791
00:40:31.239 --> 00:40:32.639
where that neophobia comes in.

792
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:38.620
Can animals also use food as medicine, and if

793
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.020
so, could you give us examples of that?

794
00:40:42.159 --> 00:40:45.479
Yeah, so that's, you know, that goes back to

795
00:40:45.479 --> 00:40:48.699
the question of what is, what is medicine and

796
00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.479
depending on who you talk to, you're gonna have

797
00:40:50.479 --> 00:40:53.169
a different answer, but it is clear that in

798
00:40:53.169 --> 00:40:56.360
a lot of forms of human medicine, food is

799
00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:01.000
important. So one example is traditional Chinese medicine where

800
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.959
the consumption of green tea is a really important

801
00:41:03.959 --> 00:41:08.909
aspect of maintaining health and so, You know, but

802
00:41:08.909 --> 00:41:11.590
there are discussions. So in the literature, so some

803
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:13.989
of my colleagues would argue that food cannot be

804
00:41:13.989 --> 00:41:17.189
medicine. Others would say that it can be. But

805
00:41:17.189 --> 00:41:20.709
we know that there are examples, there are just

806
00:41:20.709 --> 00:41:23.149
other species of caterpillars, for example, when they are

807
00:41:23.149 --> 00:41:28.659
infected. They don't go and eat particular toxic food,

808
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:31.750
but instead, they eat food that gives them more

809
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:35.310
protein and they use that protein to, you know,

810
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.360
pay for their immune system to really um You,

811
00:41:39.479 --> 00:41:42.679
you know, because immunity is a very costly physiological

812
00:41:42.679 --> 00:41:46.040
response. So they use, they, they specifically eat more

813
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.840
protein, so they can mount a stronger immune response

814
00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.120
against the viruses they have. So I think that's

815
00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.840
a really good example of where food is medicine.

816
00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.040
The other thing I will say is that, you

817
00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:00.280
know, the distinction between food and medicine and toxins

818
00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.159
is, is one of those. And so a lot

819
00:42:03.159 --> 00:42:06.510
of things that are food. If you eat too

820
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.629
much of it, it becomes, you know, toxic and

821
00:42:09.629 --> 00:42:11.790
somewhere in the middle of maybe medicine, right? So

822
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:15.550
you can think about drinking coffee, um, you know,

823
00:42:15.629 --> 00:42:18.229
you, you can consider coffee as a food, but

824
00:42:18.229 --> 00:42:20.429
you can also consider it as a medicine because

825
00:42:20.429 --> 00:42:23.709
the caffeine can really help you become alert and

826
00:42:23.709 --> 00:42:25.750
be, be able to do things that otherwise you

827
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:28.909
cannot do. But if you inject caffeine directly into

828
00:42:28.909 --> 00:42:31.350
your bloodstream in a high concentration, you die, right?

829
00:42:31.389 --> 00:42:34.629
So In some sense, food, medicine, toxin, it's all

830
00:42:34.629 --> 00:42:36.790
on a spectrum, right? So in some sometimes I

831
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:39.709
feel like we're trying to make the distinction where

832
00:42:39.709 --> 00:42:42.770
there isn't one because it's really this whole range.

833
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:47.510
Right, uh why do dogs eat grass?

834
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.750
That's a good question, and It's actually, there has

835
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.760
been very little research on this. So it's one

836
00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.389
of the, the surprising things I learned in writing

837
00:42:57.389 --> 00:43:00.300
the book was how little people have actually studied

838
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:04.750
this behavior in a scientific way. And, but what

839
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:07.590
we do know is from a lot of other

840
00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:10.350
animals related to dogs that they often eat grass.

841
00:43:10.389 --> 00:43:13.590
So there have been over the decades many examples

842
00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:18.510
of carnivores, whether it's mountain lions, lynxes, wolves, coyotes.

843
00:43:18.989 --> 00:43:22.840
A lot of these animals eat grass and oftentimes

844
00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.199
when people look at, they, they find either the

845
00:43:26.199 --> 00:43:29.830
feces of the animals or they find vomit and

846
00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:32.239
they find the grass in it and together with

847
00:43:32.239 --> 00:43:35.639
the grass there are parasites. And so oftentimes this

848
00:43:35.639 --> 00:43:38.580
is worms or other parasites that you can find

849
00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.540
there. Um, AND what those grasses have in common,

850
00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.040
the grasses that all these animals use are very,

851
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.800
very rough. They're very much like the Velcro-like leaves

852
00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.520
that we discussed for the chimpanzees. And so, it

853
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.159
seems that what these animals are doing is they're

854
00:43:54.159 --> 00:43:56.800
going for grass that is really, really rough. They

855
00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.679
eat it. So probably what's going on, they, they,

856
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.239
they have stomach upset or gut upset, they don't

857
00:44:01.239 --> 00:44:03.239
feel good. They eat the grass and then they

858
00:44:03.239 --> 00:44:05.719
either throw up or they have diarrhea, and that

859
00:44:05.719 --> 00:44:08.840
gets rid of whatever made them feel that discomfort,

860
00:44:08.969 --> 00:44:11.439
whatever made them feel sick. And so when you

861
00:44:11.439 --> 00:44:15.040
look at our dogs, And our cats that of

862
00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.719
course are descended from those wild carnivores. They often

863
00:44:19.719 --> 00:44:22.840
still eat grass and oftentimes when they do it,

864
00:44:22.919 --> 00:44:26.520
they either throw up afterwards or they, they, they

865
00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.360
get diarrhea afterwards, not always, and they don't, and,

866
00:44:30.439 --> 00:44:33.239
and I think this is actually great because what

867
00:44:33.239 --> 00:44:36.550
it shows is that oftentimes our, our pets don't

868
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:38.320
do it because they have worms, right? Because most

869
00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.820
of our pets don't. But sometimes they do it

870
00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.820
because they ate something wrong, like a piece of

871
00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.659
Lego or a Barbie head, you know, things that

872
00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:47.500
that they may find in the house and they

873
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.379
eat it and it doesn't sit well, so they

874
00:44:49.379 --> 00:44:51.260
feel that discomfort, they eat grass and they get

875
00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.979
rid of it. And that goes back to earlier

876
00:44:53.979 --> 00:44:55.620
when we said, you know, do animals need to

877
00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.270
know what they're doing? So for them it doesn't

878
00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:01.600
matter if there is a gut, uh, a gut

879
00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.419
parasite like a worm or a piece of Lego.

880
00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.919
It just doesn't feel good and they eat grass

881
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.840
and then they get rid of it, right? So

882
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.280
they feel the symptoms and in this case, I

883
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.719
think it's a very innate behavior. They go for

884
00:45:13.719 --> 00:45:17.100
that grass and then they get rid of whatever

885
00:45:17.199 --> 00:45:17.800
bothered them.

886
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:23.459
Do we have any idea about when humans started

887
00:45:23.459 --> 00:45:27.179
using medication? I mean, I know that we have

888
00:45:27.179 --> 00:45:33.159
examples in the archaeological record regarding Neanderthals and the

889
00:45:33.159 --> 00:45:36.699
specific case of Otsi, but I mean, what do

890
00:45:36.699 --> 00:45:37.810
we know about that?

891
00:45:38.379 --> 00:45:42.100
Yeah, so the The Neanderthals that you just mentioned,

892
00:45:42.219 --> 00:45:46.939
we know from basically a Neanderthal dental records. It's

893
00:45:46.939 --> 00:45:48.939
really cool. Right, so you can look at the

894
00:45:48.939 --> 00:45:51.699
fossils of Neanderthals and their teeth are preserved and

895
00:45:51.699 --> 00:45:54.699
the teeth are often the best preserved parts. Um,

896
00:45:54.899 --> 00:45:57.179
YOU know, we have to really, uh, I mean

897
00:45:57.179 --> 00:45:58.699
you get the calculus, when we go to the

898
00:45:58.699 --> 00:46:01.139
dentist and they scrape your, your teeth, they get

899
00:46:01.139 --> 00:46:05.030
rid of that calculus, that calculus actually provides really

900
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:08.879
good. Fossil record because it traps all sorts of

901
00:46:08.879 --> 00:46:12.409
chemicals and microbes and they get fossilized. So, what

902
00:46:12.409 --> 00:46:15.370
researchers did is do gene genetic analysis, but also

903
00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:19.750
chemical analysis and they found Specific chemicals that only

904
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.669
occur in, in some plants that humans only ever

905
00:46:22.669 --> 00:46:24.949
use as medicine as medicine and not as food.

906
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:27.510
So there we go, medicine, food, but things that

907
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:30.139
we generally don't eat as food, but we use

908
00:46:30.139 --> 00:46:32.510
as medicine. And so that's why they concluded, you

909
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:37.320
know, around 40, 43,000 years ago, Neanderthals use medicine.

910
00:46:37.629 --> 00:46:39.030
But you know, the question is when did they

911
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:42.389
start using it? When you look at And animals

912
00:46:42.389 --> 00:46:45.790
in general, we're increasingly finding that all sorts of

913
00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:48.899
animals use it. So, and chimpanzees use it, right?

914
00:46:48.989 --> 00:46:52.189
So I would say probably as long as there

915
00:46:52.189 --> 00:46:55.550
have been humans. So, you know, humans use medicine,

916
00:46:55.659 --> 00:46:58.669
chimpanzees use medicine. Our common ancestor lived somewhere between

917
00:46:58.669 --> 00:47:01.739
6 and 8 million years ago. Um, AND then,

918
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:05.120
you know, their common ancestor with the other primates

919
00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:09.370
lived way longer ago than that. So I'd say.

920
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:13.199
Our ancestors used medicine and humans have always used

921
00:47:13.199 --> 00:47:16.070
medicine as long as we have have existed.

922
00:47:16.729 --> 00:47:20.810
But do you think that all hominins who use

923
00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:21.520
medicine?

924
00:47:21.969 --> 00:47:24.889
I would think so. I think all, you know,

925
00:47:24.969 --> 00:47:27.090
the more we look at primates, so we know

926
00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.330
all apes use medicine and so a lot of

927
00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:32.610
this started with chimpanzees, but people have looked at

928
00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:37.439
gorillas and bonobos and orangutans. They are, they're all

929
00:47:37.439 --> 00:47:40.879
using medicine. And humans are using medicine. So all,

930
00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:44.139
all the apes use medicine. So I am, you

931
00:47:44.139 --> 00:47:46.780
know, I, I cannot prove it. I don't have

932
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.500
the evidence for it, but I think that my,

933
00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.860
my my hypothesis is that yes, all hominins have

934
00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:53.620
used medicine.

935
00:47:55.129 --> 00:47:59.330
Uh, HOW can we benefit from studying the medicating

936
00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:01.790
behaviors of other animals?

937
00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:07.270
Yeah, so I mentioned aspirin before, um, but even

938
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:09.840
today we can learn completely new things that we

939
00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:13.719
didn't know. And one really nice example is cats

940
00:48:13.719 --> 00:48:16.800
and catnip and silver vine. So a lot of

941
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.679
people who have cats will know that when you

942
00:48:18.679 --> 00:48:20.800
give them catnip or you give them toys that

943
00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.600
have catnip chemicals in them, they, they go crazy

944
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.639
over it. They love, they bite it and they

945
00:48:25.639 --> 00:48:28.120
start rolling around and then they go like in

946
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.439
this kind of this ecstasy that those lemurs and

947
00:48:30.439 --> 00:48:33.080
capuchins have with the millipedes. So they really, really

948
00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.770
love it. And it's not until, so people have

949
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:39.719
known about this for A long time and we,

950
00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.600
we actually have evidence that they're in some Neolithic

951
00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:46.360
villages thousands of years ago, people grew catnip, and

952
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.199
we don't use it for anything else. So that,

953
00:48:48.439 --> 00:48:50.280
you know, the implication is they use it for

954
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.760
their cats. Um, BUT why do cats like it

955
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.040
so much? So, it's only recently that researchers in

956
00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.889
Japan They started looking at silver vine, so silver

957
00:49:01.889 --> 00:49:05.840
vine like catnip elicits this response in the cats,

958
00:49:05.919 --> 00:49:10.239
but it's stronger even than catnip, um, and really

959
00:49:10.239 --> 00:49:11.899
trying to figure out why are they doing this.

960
00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:15.909
And it turns out that the chemicals in the

961
00:49:15.909 --> 00:49:17.830
silver vine, so what the cats do is when

962
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:20.389
they start rolling around, they coat themselves in these

963
00:49:20.389 --> 00:49:24.580
chemicals, and then with experiments, the researchers showed that

964
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:28.479
those chemicals protect against mosquitoes. Now mosquitoes are really

965
00:49:28.479 --> 00:49:31.469
bad for cats. Um, THEY suck blood, but more

966
00:49:31.469 --> 00:49:34.669
importantly, they transmit all sorts of parasites again, such

967
00:49:34.669 --> 00:49:38.449
as heartworm, which is really detrimental to cats, and

968
00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:41.459
um, But yeah, so, so what the cats do

969
00:49:41.459 --> 00:49:43.500
is they coat themselves in this chemical. So it's

970
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:47.909
another example of anointing that we um discussed earlier.

971
00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:51.550
And then the researchers actually really felt bad for

972
00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:54.590
the cats, so, because it's really sad to have

973
00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:56.540
your cats being bitten by mosquitoes. So then they

974
00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:59.139
applied the chemicals to their own arm and stuck

975
00:49:59.139 --> 00:50:01.510
their arms, one with the chemicals, one without, in

976
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:03.909
a cage with mosquitoes and found that it works

977
00:50:03.909 --> 00:50:07.649
for humans too. And so they patented that chemical

978
00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.669
to see if we can develop it into a

979
00:50:09.669 --> 00:50:13.149
human mosquito repellent. Right? So what that means is

980
00:50:13.149 --> 00:50:16.260
that even today, we can learn things from, from

981
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.229
nature and develop things that otherwise we wouldn't have

982
00:50:20.229 --> 00:50:20.639
developed.

983
00:50:22.169 --> 00:50:25.850
So still in the realm of applications, and this

984
00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:29.090
will be my last two or three questions, I

985
00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:32.030
would like to ask you about specific examples of

986
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.409
applications of this kind of knowledge. So in the,

987
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.929
in farms and in the livestock industry, people have

988
00:50:38.929 --> 00:50:43.169
to worry about animal health and that, and them

989
00:50:43.169 --> 00:50:48.254
sometimes developing antibiotic. Resistance. So how can we use

990
00:50:48.254 --> 00:50:53.375
insights into the medication behaviors of goats and sheep

991
00:50:53.675 --> 00:50:58.774
to improve animal health and reduce antibiotic resistance?

992
00:50:59.114 --> 00:51:02.385
Absolutely. So I think it's, it goes back to

993
00:51:02.385 --> 00:51:04.834
the idea, you know, similar to the honeybees, the

994
00:51:04.834 --> 00:51:08.104
way we keep our livestock is very non-natural, right,

995
00:51:08.215 --> 00:51:13.030
unnatural, um, because we basically We reproduce this kind

996
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:17.270
of mixed ration food where because as humans we

997
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:19.179
think it has everything in it that it needs

998
00:51:19.179 --> 00:51:21.590
because it's all the right nutrients, right? What it

999
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:23.790
doesn't have in it is the right medicines and

1000
00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:26.229
that is why we have to give them antibiotics

1001
00:51:26.229 --> 00:51:29.419
and elmintics that kill worms. And so we just

1002
00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:31.070
add that to the food and that creates a

1003
00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:34.389
lot of problems with antibiotic resistance. But then the

1004
00:51:34.389 --> 00:51:37.350
research that we talked about earlier really shows that

1005
00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:41.080
these animals are really good at Not just using

1006
00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.239
the medicine when they need it, but really balancing

1007
00:51:43.239 --> 00:51:47.959
their own, their own diet. And so But the

1008
00:51:47.959 --> 00:51:49.760
research has shown us that when you, even when

1009
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.679
you, so this was with cattle actually, so you

1010
00:51:52.679 --> 00:51:55.560
give them either the the mixed ration or you

1011
00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.879
give them 4 different foods that actually make up

1012
00:51:57.879 --> 00:52:00.260
that ration and like you let the animals decide

1013
00:52:00.399 --> 00:52:02.800
how much of each they eat. And it turns

1014
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:07.000
out every animal chooses slightly different ratios of the

1015
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.199
chemical or or the foods and that makes sense

1016
00:52:09.199 --> 00:52:12.270
because everyone has different preferences and needs. Um, BUT

1017
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:15.709
on average, they ate 20% less because they don't

1018
00:52:15.709 --> 00:52:18.790
need to overeat to get what is really most

1019
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:21.989
limiting. Um, SO what that means is these animals

1020
00:52:21.989 --> 00:52:24.330
are really good at regulating their own diet and

1021
00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:27.149
choosing the medicine when they need it. So, but

1022
00:52:27.149 --> 00:52:29.949
the researchers in Utah State really, their idea was

1023
00:52:29.949 --> 00:52:32.949
to put all these animals back in a meadow

1024
00:52:33.199 --> 00:52:35.389
and then make sure the meadow has all sorts

1025
00:52:35.389 --> 00:52:38.389
of different plants, right? It doesn't just, and they

1026
00:52:38.389 --> 00:52:40.629
said even if you just have 6 different plants,

1027
00:52:40.949 --> 00:52:43.070
and that goes a long way. So rather than

1028
00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:45.840
just one type of grass grow different types of

1029
00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.949
plants, the animals can sample from, um, some of

1030
00:52:48.949 --> 00:52:52.429
them can work as prophylaxis, other can work as

1031
00:52:52.429 --> 00:52:56.429
therapeutic medication. Um, BUT even they said in, in

1032
00:52:56.429 --> 00:53:00.350
more industrial settings, you could provide those different foods

1033
00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:02.389
to the animals, right? It doesn't have to be

1034
00:53:02.389 --> 00:53:05.310
one ration, but give them those choices and make

1035
00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:07.790
sure there are those medicinal plants in there as

1036
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:10.149
well. And so you don't have to rely so

1037
00:53:10.149 --> 00:53:11.469
much on the antibiotics.

1038
00:53:12.169 --> 00:53:16.449
Mhm. In the domain of beekeeping, uh, how can

1039
00:53:16.449 --> 00:53:21.030
we apply the anti-parasitic behaviors of bees there?

1040
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:26.379
Yeah, so the, we mentioned the really straightforward way

1041
00:53:26.379 --> 00:53:29.260
earlier on, right? So you can, right now we

1042
00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:31.959
have those bee boxes that consist of these planks

1043
00:53:31.959 --> 00:53:34.979
that are really smooth and so not making them

1044
00:53:34.979 --> 00:53:37.300
smooth and putting grooves in the side so the

1045
00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:40.540
bees have some place to put their propolis is

1046
00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:44.739
a really important and easy way um to, to

1047
00:53:44.739 --> 00:53:47.620
help the bees medicate themselves and that, you know,

1048
00:53:47.739 --> 00:53:50.250
then we don't. Have as many problems with the

1049
00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:52.989
bees and they're happier and we are happier.

1050
00:53:55.169 --> 00:53:58.860
And finally, tell us about how we can develop

1051
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:03.879
bug repellents from compounds discovered by cats.

1052
00:54:04.649 --> 00:54:07.330
Yeah, so that's the story that we mentioned earlier

1053
00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:09.770
with, you know, the cats that use the silver

1054
00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:13.510
vine plants and what the researchers did there is

1055
00:54:13.699 --> 00:54:17.010
really extract all the chemicals from those plants, really

1056
00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:19.010
figure out what are the chemicals that the cats

1057
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:21.810
find most attractive, and in doing that, they found

1058
00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:25.050
a specific chemical in the silver vine that the

1059
00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:27.810
cats find really attractive and that when they coat

1060
00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:31.399
themselves in that, it stops the, the mosquitoes from,

1061
00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:35.040
from biting them. So, you know, then the next

1062
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.110
step is to, to see, you know, can we

1063
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:39.500
use this chemical? Does it work on humans? Is

1064
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:42.429
it safe on humans? And then can we start

1065
00:54:42.429 --> 00:54:46.770
producing it. So, It's a great example because it's

1066
00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:49.639
very recent. It's in progress and I love that

1067
00:54:49.639 --> 00:54:52.250
example because it tells us that learning from animals

1068
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:54.889
is not something of, of the past, it's something

1069
00:54:54.889 --> 00:54:55.729
we can do today.

1070
00:54:56.530 --> 00:55:00.449
Mhm. Great. So the book is again Doctors by

1071
00:55:00.449 --> 00:55:04.889
Nature How Ants, Apes, and Other Animals Heal Themselves.

1072
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.129
I, I, of course, I'm leaving a link to

1073
00:55:07.129 --> 00:55:10.949
it in the description down below. And Doctor DeRod,

1074
00:55:11.129 --> 00:55:13.270
uh, just before we go apart from the book,

1075
00:55:13.379 --> 00:55:16.570
where can people find your work on the internet?

1076
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:20.429
So I'm on, uh, I've got a website, it's

1077
00:55:20.429 --> 00:55:25.870
my name.com, Yaprodo.com. I'm on Instagram, Blue Sky, as
