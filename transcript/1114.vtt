00:00:00.479 --> 00:00:03.460
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.429
Dissenter. I'm your host as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:09.739
today I'm joined by Doctor Sybil Hart. She's professor

4
00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:13.109
emeritus in the Department of Human Development and Family

5
00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:17.110
Sciences at Texas Tech University. And today we're talking

6
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.940
about her book Attachment and Parent Offspring Conflict. So,

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.510
Doctor Hart, welcome to the show. It's a huge

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.350
pleasure to

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.190
everyone. Thank you so much for having me.

10
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.709
So, I mean, tell us first about attachment theory.

11
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.279
What is it and why do you bring it

12
00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:41.279
into the framework you apply in this book, in

13
00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:45.799
this particular case in a book surrounding attachment and

14
00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:47.869
parent offspring conflict.

15
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.099
So we have a long standing interest in the

16
00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:58.990
field of psychology and earlier in psychiatry. Into the

17
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.669
basis of a relationship that appears to be universal,

18
00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:07.660
that is the one between children and mothers. And

19
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.239
it has attached itself to politics and religion. And

20
00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:20.750
culture wars and so it certainly has expanded beyond

21
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.370
our discipline. So if you are somebody who studies,

22
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.080
you know, gravity, it's not like it's a topic

23
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.599
of conversation in everyday life, whereas this relationship is

24
00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:36.919
something that is so pivotal to understanding ourselves that

25
00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:41.569
we have spent a tremendous amount of intellect. Uh,

26
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.830
uh, DEVOTED to understanding where it comes from, what

27
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.629
is it like, how to make it better? When

28
00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:54.309
can it work under what kind of circumstances. So

29
00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:58.940
it's not just any relationship, it's The one that

30
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.540
nobody can avoid. So the theories that started to

31
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.139
enter into sort of the scientific realm were probably

32
00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.059
those of Freud. And the interesting part about that

33
00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:17.179
theory was that he understood that babies come into

34
00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.250
the world not as a blank state. Even though

35
00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:25.179
there's been very little really good hard scientific evidence

36
00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:28.100
to prove a lot of the ideas, but the

37
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.279
foundational notion that the mother-child relationship is somehow Grounded

38
00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.889
in our minds before we even enter into the

39
00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.970
world is a really important idea. Now, his idea

40
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.059
was that it came from experience. And that experience

41
00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.679
was in utero. So the 9 months of gestation

42
00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.860
perhaps gave a baby some idea of what mom

43
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.539
was like, uh, again. A notion that resonates and

44
00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.899
still does resonate with a lot of people, writers

45
00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.009
and a lot of fiction have kind of sprung

46
00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.710
from that idea, but actually, And we have some

47
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.990
evidence that, you know, if the intrauterine environment is

48
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.949
flooded with cortisol because the mother is stressed, it'll

49
00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.910
have some kind of an effect on, on children,

50
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.070
but it's, it's a long shot and, and hardly

51
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.669
something that can prove personality or a relationship. So

52
00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.500
where do you go from there? Well, the other

53
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.660
thing that Freud talked about was breastfeeding. OK, so

54
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.539
if you're talking about experience, not in utero, the

55
00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:35.820
other experience that would be universal would have been

56
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.990
breastfeeding. And this also resonated. TREMENDOUSLY well, which is

57
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.720
why it's an idea that really hasn't, uh, gone

58
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.479
away, that there's something about that breastfeeding relationship that

59
00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:57.160
is special and unique and Profoundly important to development

60
00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:00.850
and something that happens in, in a way that

61
00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:04.000
if it goes wrong, it's like a permanent disaster.

62
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.279
And again, the problem was, lo and behold, babies

63
00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:11.639
form bonds with people who don't feed them. They

64
00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.440
love their dads, they love their grandmothers, they love

65
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.079
all kinds of people. So, and they love people

66
00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.160
who don't feed them. The fact is, so it

67
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.089
took away from uh breastfeeding, but that didn't take

68
00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:27.279
away from the idea that there's something pivotal about

69
00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:33.089
this relationship and It, it is one that has

70
00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:39.100
Been written about Um, so much that you can't

71
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.730
help but think there must be more to this

72
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.250
that we need to understand. So he turned to

73
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.299
the newer theories, these were, uh, Bowby's work, and

74
00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:53.730
he said, Well, babies are born with something that

75
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.420
isn't like having a blank slate. It's like there's

76
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.579
something shaped through prehistory that makes this an important

77
00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:06.329
part of a baby's life. And in his mind,

78
00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:09.450
it had to have adaptive value because he understood

79
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.570
from the writing at the time that in order

80
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.450
for some kind of a personality trait to have

81
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.130
evolved, it had to have been adaptive in the

82
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.570
environment that we grew up in, which isn't anything

83
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.290
like the environment we live in today. And so

84
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.200
this came to be the focus on, on, um,

85
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:35.910
attachment relationships having been formed by a predisposition. That's

86
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.670
based on the adaptive value of forming a relationship

87
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.459
with a caregiver who provides safety, who acts as

88
00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:47.959
a safe haven. And so this was coming out

89
00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:52.070
in the 1970s. So basically, the idea was, well,

90
00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:55.679
if breastfeeding isn't pivotal, it must be something else

91
00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:58.920
that was adaptive, and in his mind, it was

92
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.339
predation. And That idea got sort of expanded a

93
00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:07.149
bit. It wasn't just fear of lions and tigers

94
00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:11.179
and snakes. It could be just environmental hazards, and

95
00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:15.820
this has been the prevailing theory in mainstream psychology

96
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.709
for the last, I don't know. Uh, IT'S getting

97
00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:25.299
to be close to a century now. Mhm. So

98
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:33.309
that problem. Um, WHICH is really difficult to address.

99
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.720
But from the time of Bowlby's writing, Until now,

100
00:06:39.989 --> 00:06:45.089
a lot has changed. Um, We still think that

101
00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:50.130
there's something about this mother-child relationship that is a

102
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.390
pivotal importance to becoming a human being. And yet

103
00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.000
Bowby's theory is one that didn't really explain the

104
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.679
primacy of that relationship. And so in a way,

105
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:14.230
I found the writing disconnected from my experience. And

106
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.459
I think the experience of of a lot of

107
00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:21.049
women anyway. That you knew there was something special

108
00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:24.130
about this relationship and you couldn't, you couldn't pinpoint

109
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.570
it. If, if you really think that we evolved

110
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:32.049
this relationship because of its importance to survival by

111
00:07:32.049 --> 00:07:37.649
providing safety from environmental hazards, that anybody can provide

112
00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:41.260
it just like anybody can feed a baby. So

113
00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:44.059
where do mothers come into all of this? Well,

114
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.500
I think I kind of took it personally and

115
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.579
so I kind of ignored it for a while

116
00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:51.540
thinking, you know, you're not being the unbiased scientist,

117
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.940
you're acting like the mother, so take off your

118
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.410
mother hat. And but after a while you think,

119
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.380
no, there's got to be more to it. And

120
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.739
so really it comes to thinking. There's something about

121
00:08:03.739 --> 00:08:08.140
breastfeeding, but maybe it's not breastfeeding. Maybe it's breast

122
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.070
milk. And when you start thinking about it that

123
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.500
way, I'm going to use this analogy even though

124
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.820
some people might find it offensive, but if you

125
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.130
think about sexual behavior, And you think about all

126
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.089
that goes on between men and women in order

127
00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:26.859
to produce a baby, and you think about seminal

128
00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:33.770
fluid. They're entirely different categories of understanding. Different people

129
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.409
study them. They publish in different journals. They talk

130
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:39.090
about different things. They hardly even ever get together.

131
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.859
There's this group of people and those group of

132
00:08:42.859 --> 00:08:46.169
people. And it became very obvious that these two

133
00:08:46.479 --> 00:08:52.580
features that are both important for procreation. Um, Don't

134
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.739
really have anything to do with one another. And

135
00:08:55.739 --> 00:08:58.580
that was pretty much illustrated when IVF came about.

136
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:04.039
When IVF came about. It became clear that you

137
00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:07.890
can produce a baby without the behavior. It's that

138
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.260
liquid, that fluid that creates life. And in the

139
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
very beginning, I'm old enough to remember when there

140
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.219
was sort of this brouha over the test tube

141
00:09:15.219 --> 00:09:19.580
babies thinking that will they be loving human beings

142
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.580
even though they weren't created in the way babies

143
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.500
have been created forever. And so when you think

144
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.739
about breastfeeding, you really need to think about the

145
00:09:28.739 --> 00:09:33.380
behavior as distinct from the fluid. And then you

146
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.630
start to come up with a theory that starts

147
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:43.289
to explain why mothers are important. Now, of course,

148
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.909
when Boldby was writing, Uh, there was wet nurses.

149
00:09:48.119 --> 00:09:51.239
Wet nurses were very, very common. This means that

150
00:09:51.239 --> 00:09:53.320
the woman gives birth to the baby, hands the

151
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.239
baby over to this lovely lady who will breastfeed

152
00:09:56.239 --> 00:09:58.760
your baby until your baby is weaned, and then

153
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.280
hand you back the baby. And you know, babies

154
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.760
turned out fine. Well, actually they didn't turn out

155
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.599
so great, but it worked for a lot of

156
00:10:05.599 --> 00:10:09.679
people, a lot of the time. And then came

157
00:10:09.849 --> 00:10:14.510
formula. And in addition came baby food. I mean,

158
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.450
if you were living in a cave 2 million

159
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.500
years ago or even 300,000 years ago when Homo

160
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.260
sapiens came along, you did not have Gerber's baby

161
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.630
food in little jars. You didn't have a blender

162
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.659
to mash up your mashed potatoes and add water.

163
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.640
You Didn't have cereal, you didn't have, you know,

164
00:10:34.719 --> 00:10:36.359
you didn't have a metal fork. I mean, I

165
00:10:36.359 --> 00:10:37.760
don't know what you did to feed a baby.

166
00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:41.119
It wasn't that easy. You're very reliant on breast

167
00:10:41.119 --> 00:10:44.140
milk, and in fact, babies couldn't survive without breast

168
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.520
milk. And so, What we start to understand about

169
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.090
the mother in the ancestral setting is, is that

170
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.299
she was the sole source of breast milk. And

171
00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:59.950
the behavior that yes, anybody could provide, anybody could

172
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.750
hold a baby and, and love a baby and

173
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.000
stimulate and provide all of the things that attachment

174
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.150
theorists have shown us are critical to baby's development.

175
00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:12.710
But in the ancestral environment, it would only be

176
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.799
the mother who could provide enough breast milk to

177
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:15.710
keep a baby alive.

178
00:11:17.349 --> 00:11:21.200
So in regards to that ancestral environment you are

179
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.919
referring to, there's this concept of the environment of

180
00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:29.200
evolutionary adaptiveness that you also talk about in your

181
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:35.479
book. So what characterizes this environment, which aspects of

182
00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:40.440
it are the most important for what you explore

183
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.270
in the book?

184
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.179
So I think one of the key features of

185
00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:48.619
that environment that's received a lot of attention is

186
00:11:48.619 --> 00:11:53.340
that these were small clans, 50 people, including children.

187
00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:59.349
Multiple caregiving was the norm. So babies born, there's

188
00:11:59.349 --> 00:12:02.869
the mother, there's the grandmother, there's some aunts, there's

189
00:12:02.869 --> 00:12:07.479
some other children. It's a small, close-knit, tight society.

190
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:15.700
And the writers who started the anthropologists, um, Margaret

191
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.859
Mead, for instance, who would be studying these environments

192
00:12:19.859 --> 00:12:23.429
that seemed similar, we're looking at these close knit

193
00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.020
groupings and seeing how they function, and it really

194
00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.299
changed the way we understood relationships and families and

195
00:12:31.299 --> 00:12:34.359
the mother-child relationship. And in a way it created

196
00:12:34.359 --> 00:12:36.119
some kind of conflict. On the one hand you

197
00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:38.599
have the attachment theorists who're saying, OK, this mother-child

198
00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:41.280
relationship is really pivotal to development. On the other

199
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.070
hand, the evolutionary psychologists and anthropologists are saying that

200
00:12:45.479 --> 00:12:47.840
we grew up in a network which was full

201
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.039
of all of these people, and so the mother

202
00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:52.099
was just one among many caregivers, and it sort

203
00:12:52.099 --> 00:12:54.679
of diminished the role of mothers and increased the

204
00:12:54.679 --> 00:13:01.039
role of all of these caregivers. And then there

205
00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:03.679
would be sort of an, an idea of the

206
00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:05.679
way to understand this to ask, OK, which one

207
00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:08.520
is more important? Is it the mother-child relationship or

208
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.479
is it the multiple caregivers and which one came

209
00:13:11.479 --> 00:13:14.280
first and which one is better, and, and how

210
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.479
does this all work? And so this actually created

211
00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:20.909
a fair amount of conflict between these two settings,

212
00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:26.210
um. Because you couldn't quite integrate, how is the

213
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.960
mother important if we arose in an environment where

214
00:13:29.289 --> 00:13:34.679
mothers were not the only caregivers. What I've proposed

215
00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:38.960
is that you can understand breastfeeding not only by

216
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.200
looking at the difference between the behavior versus the

217
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.359
fluid that gets transmitted, the breast milk, but you

218
00:13:46.359 --> 00:13:48.000
can also look at it from the point of

219
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.590
view that it actually sets the stage for a

220
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.809
different kind of interaction to take place. So, the

221
00:13:54.809 --> 00:13:59.770
fact is, newborn babies uh have to be reclining.

222
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.559
They can't consume solid food. If you put solid

223
00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:05.950
food into a newborn baby's mouth, they will either

224
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.349
choke or spit it out. And as it turns

225
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:13.630
out, that first year is almost exclusively one that

226
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:18.099
would be characterized by what's called exclusive breastfeeding, meaning

227
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:23.710
nothing, not even premasticated food, not even water, nothing

228
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.549
enters this baby's mouth except breast milk. So that

229
00:14:27.549 --> 00:14:30.390
really determines who the baby's going to be with.

230
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.700
Once you have a baby that can sit up,

231
00:14:34.109 --> 00:14:37.739
hold up its head, swallow food, you can begin

232
00:14:37.739 --> 00:14:41.590
to feed other foods, soft foods, and even in

233
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.869
the ancestral environment, you could have some source of

234
00:14:44.869 --> 00:14:48.229
protein other than breast milk that could sustain a

235
00:14:48.229 --> 00:14:51.260
baby. And so what it did was it really

236
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.679
organized the different kinds of social relationships that would

237
00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:59.440
evolve if you're only fed by a mother and

238
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.239
you're a baby, and if anybody knows anything about

239
00:15:01.239 --> 00:15:04.080
babies, they're hungry all the time. I mean, like

240
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.380
you try to put them on a schedule that

241
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.559
really doesn't work because after you finish feeding them

242
00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:10.789
like 10 minutes later they're hungry again and so

243
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:15.380
um they're always with the mother. Now, anybody can

244
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.559
feed them. The solid foods doesn't have to be

245
00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:20.780
provided by the mother, it can be provided by

246
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.619
the grandmother or an aunt or a sibling, or

247
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:29.859
anybody else. So, This kind of feeding behavior that

248
00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:32.700
is governed by maturation of the infant, meaning the

249
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.179
ability to sit up, hold up the head, swallow

250
00:15:35.179 --> 00:15:39.900
food, actually determines who provides care. And so now

251
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.590
you go from this 1st 9 months. Where babies

252
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.840
are always fed by the mother to the next

253
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.729
2 years where they still require breast milk to

254
00:15:50.729 --> 00:15:54.200
survive. There's no medical care. There's no source of

255
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.090
protein that will do the job. They still require

256
00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.489
it, but they don't require it exclusively. And in

257
00:16:00.489 --> 00:16:03.580
fact, their nutritional demands require more than the breast

258
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.090
milk can provide. And so it drives these other

259
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:12.849
relationships. Now, are these relationships the same? No. There's

260
00:16:12.849 --> 00:16:15.630
a lot of differences between them. And so when

261
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:20.890
you think about how Breastfeeding and the baby's requirement

262
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:26.929
for breast milk governed who is the caregiver and

263
00:16:26.929 --> 00:16:29.599
what is that caregiver like. You really come up

264
00:16:29.599 --> 00:16:34.409
with some really interesting kinds of phenomena. One of

265
00:16:34.409 --> 00:16:37.929
them is the fact that a baby born 300,000

266
00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:41.010
years ago in a cave somewhere in Africa, and

267
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.729
you can be a baby born 50,000 years ago

268
00:16:44.729 --> 00:16:48.340
in Siberia. And your 1st 9 months will be

269
00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:52.260
pretty much the same. You're going to get fed

270
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.179
by your mother at her breast with skin to

271
00:16:55.179 --> 00:16:59.820
skin contact and the warmth almost continuously. You can't

272
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.820
walk, you can't even crawl, so you're in her

273
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.979
arms almost all the time, no matter who you

274
00:17:05.979 --> 00:17:08.300
are, no matter where you are, no matter what

275
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.979
epoch you live in. It's extraordinary. Now contrast this

276
00:17:11.979 --> 00:17:15.739
with, OK, the next 2 years, you're still a

277
00:17:15.739 --> 00:17:20.160
baby. You're still sleeping with your mother. You're still

278
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.229
breastfeeding at night, but in the day, anything's possible.

279
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.239
So you might be in Siberia wearing a sealskin

280
00:17:28.239 --> 00:17:30.660
fur, you might be in Africa wearing nothing at

281
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.439
all. You might be fed fish from a stream

282
00:17:34.439 --> 00:17:37.829
or a walrus from the ice pack. You could

283
00:17:37.829 --> 00:17:40.800
be in an environment where you talk all day

284
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.030
to people in an environment where you never talk,

285
00:17:43.079 --> 00:17:44.839
you could be carried all day on somebody's back,

286
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.599
you could be strapped in, you could be anywhere.

287
00:17:47.239 --> 00:17:49.689
Well one thing the anthropologists and the cultural psychologists

288
00:17:49.689 --> 00:17:51.469
have done a great job is showing how diverse

289
00:17:51.469 --> 00:17:55.739
these environments are. And that diversity is such a

290
00:17:55.739 --> 00:17:57.670
contrast with what goes on in the 1st 9

291
00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.349
months of life. So, back to the environment evolutionary

292
00:18:01.349 --> 00:18:06.469
adaptiveness, you have an environment that is small, close-knit.

293
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.020
Environment where the mother would be the only source

294
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.829
of breast milk because there aren't a lot of

295
00:18:12.829 --> 00:18:16.589
other women available and if those women are lactating,

296
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.469
they're going to save their milk for their own

297
00:18:18.469 --> 00:18:21.920
babies. So this is a bond that is carved

298
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:27.040
into our minds over millions of years of evolution

299
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.750
that that first year is the year you spend

300
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.800
in your mother's arms. Contrast with what happens after

301
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.959
that where you better be flexible and adaptive and

302
00:18:37.959 --> 00:18:40.560
able to socialize with all the different demands of

303
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.400
every single environment. So it's not OK to say

304
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.359
which is better or which is more important. They

305
00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:51.359
just work in different ways. If the mother-child relationship

306
00:18:51.359 --> 00:18:54.800
is very much based on survival, I mean that.

307
00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:00.030
You can't live without your mother. She is irreplaceable.

308
00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:02.619
Change that to the next 2 years where you

309
00:19:02.619 --> 00:19:04.619
have some control. Maybe you want to play with

310
00:19:04.619 --> 00:19:06.739
this person. Oh, you're hungry and tired, you're going

311
00:19:06.739 --> 00:19:09.300
to go to that person. Oh, but that person's

312
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.900
a hunter who just came back with food, so

313
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.699
you're going to go to him. And now you're

314
00:19:12.699 --> 00:19:15.939
learning how to navigate this complex environment, and on

315
00:19:15.939 --> 00:19:19.579
top of that, what you have is competition. So

316
00:19:19.579 --> 00:19:23.579
your 1st 9 months, your first year, You're not

317
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:27.339
only fed by mother, but you're the only baby

318
00:19:27.339 --> 00:19:31.760
fed by mother. You are the world to her.

319
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:36.270
Guess what? Times change. Those other babies also want

320
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.550
to get care from all of those alo maternal

321
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:41.910
caregivers, and now you're in competition. One is going

322
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.390
to be cuter, one is faster, one is clever,

323
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.750
one is hungrier, one is sicker. Who knows what

324
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.310
you're competing with. There might be environments where there's

325
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.229
lots of babies, there might be environments where there's

326
00:19:51.229 --> 00:19:54.199
very few babies, who knows? It could be anything,

327
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.579
but You are not the privileged child that you

328
00:19:58.579 --> 00:20:01.739
were in your first year. And so that carves

329
00:20:01.739 --> 00:20:09.689
out a whole different set of Um, capacities that

330
00:20:09.689 --> 00:20:12.819
will advantage a toddler, and they're very different from

331
00:20:12.819 --> 00:20:15.329
the ones that advantage a newborn baby.

332
00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:21.400
So, what would you say are the main evolutionary

333
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:26.170
pressures that infants go through in their 1st 3

334
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.290
years of life? And I know that a big

335
00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:33.290
one has to do with infant mortality and uh

336
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:38.180
Different causes of infant mortality. So tell us more

337
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.109
about that.

338
00:20:39.469 --> 00:20:42.670
So one of the things, um, since the time

339
00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.670
of Bowby's writing, I mean, these paleoanthropologists have done

340
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:51.099
an amazing job of figuring out life expectancy. Who

341
00:20:51.099 --> 00:20:53.770
were the people who survived, how long did they

342
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:57.579
survive, and what killed them? Boy didn't have that

343
00:20:57.579 --> 00:21:01.579
information. And what we have is an idea of

344
00:21:01.579 --> 00:21:06.420
how, what age people died, um, because the bones

345
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:12.209
and teeth. Can provide that information. So it It

346
00:21:12.349 --> 00:21:16.599
is sort of clear, um, infancy would have been

347
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:22.510
uh responsible for a tremendous proportion of the deaths

348
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:27.500
that took place. That's an important kind of, uh,

349
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:33.510
fact that pretty much is indisputable. What's less clear

350
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:37.420
is exactly how they died. Um, THE soft tissue

351
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.550
isn't present anymore. And so you just have to

352
00:21:41.739 --> 00:21:45.020
um do your best guess. And I, I, you

353
00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.979
know, I do this in humility, maybe, maybe somebody

354
00:21:47.979 --> 00:21:51.010
will say that, you know, there were environmental hazards

355
00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:55.979
that were responsible for evolutionary pressures. um, BUT if

356
00:21:55.979 --> 00:22:00.380
you look at the, the environments that are closest

357
00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.469
to the ones that we involved in, and there's

358
00:22:02.469 --> 00:22:07.130
less and less of them. It is not environmental

359
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:14.510
hazards. It's disease, and, um, disease, most people think

360
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.839
of disease as something separate from nutrition. There's hunger

361
00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:20.839
and there's disease, and they're different. They're actually one

362
00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:24.640
topic, so that it is possible for a child

363
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.680
to survive tuberculosis without antibiotics, but it'll be a

364
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.010
well-fed child, a hungry child, a starving child will

365
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:38.430
not. And so you start to understand, um, again,

366
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.099
so much has been uh shown relating to breast

367
00:22:42.099 --> 00:22:45.390
milk that it provides not just nutrition. But its

368
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:49.709
resistance to disease and the infant's ability to fight

369
00:22:49.709 --> 00:22:53.880
off disease is far from mature until about 3

370
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:58.109
years. And so there's, there's good reason to think

371
00:22:58.109 --> 00:23:02.180
that the evolutionary pressures that were of greatest significance,

372
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.640
the ones that are responsible for half of children

373
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.189
dying, were the ones responsible for deaths in children

374
00:23:10.189 --> 00:23:13.250
under 3 years of age. And they had to

375
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:18.290
be relating to disease, and disease was relating to

376
00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:24.209
hunger and malnutrition or undernutrition. And so there's, there's

377
00:23:24.209 --> 00:23:26.880
a very strong argument that I made and I,

378
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.209
I think that it will be supported, that the

379
00:23:30.209 --> 00:23:35.130
main um evolutionary pressure was not from environmental hazards,

380
00:23:35.209 --> 00:23:40.430
it was from basically toxins in the environment. And

381
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:47.140
undernutrition, um, it's a sobering way of understanding how

382
00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:52.270
harsh the environment was. One of the things certainly

383
00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.310
I learned in in writing this book was just

384
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:59.310
delving into the literature on undernutrition and uche or

385
00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:04.109
core and how closely that's relating. To the topic

386
00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:09.750
of breast spacing, breastfeeding, premature weeding, the introduction of

387
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:14.660
formula, and a number of factors. That play a

388
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:20.180
tremendous role in being responsible for infant mortality. And

389
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.099
so the pressures that existed then, I think, are

390
00:24:23.099 --> 00:24:27.270
still the pressures that exist now. Uh, WE have

391
00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.880
better ways of treating them. Um, THEY can be

392
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:37.170
reversed if there's care. Um But sometimes you just

393
00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:41.770
wonder how How babies survived at all. When, when

394
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.849
you read about, you know, you landed up in,

395
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.449
uh, OK, I'm originally Canadian. I mean, I understand

396
00:24:47.449 --> 00:24:50.660
cold weather really well, you know, how did you

397
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.930
raise a baby, you know, 30,000 years ago in

398
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.339
Siberia and cross the Bering Strait? I mean, how

399
00:24:58.339 --> 00:25:04.060
did that even happen? Um, SO the environment was

400
00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:09.739
harsh, and that harshness in and of itself. Created

401
00:25:09.739 --> 00:25:15.010
barriers to nutrition, which created barriers to health. And

402
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.530
it's not as sexy as, you know, lions and

403
00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:21.000
tigers, but in a way you can understand how,

404
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:22.890
you know, the theories that were written were written

405
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.800
by men, and what men feared was predation and

406
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.329
lions and tigers. But you know, babies didn't really

407
00:25:28.329 --> 00:25:30.290
worry about lions and tigers or even snakes because

408
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:31.930
you have to be on the ground to encounter

409
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.489
a snake, and they weren't on the ground. Usually

410
00:25:33.489 --> 00:25:36.790
they were carried. I mean, some would have been

411
00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.069
laid on the ground, would have encountered snakes, but

412
00:25:39.069 --> 00:25:42.750
the ever present pressure that I think you can't

413
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.619
get away from, regardless of whether you were in

414
00:25:45.619 --> 00:25:50.270
the Sahara Desert or in Siberia. Under nutrition.

415
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:55.500
Mhm. But there's also the risk factor of a

416
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.900
closed birth spacing, right? And that perhaps ties to

417
00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.140
something that you mentioned earlier when it comes to

418
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:09.500
the infant potentially having to share resources, maybe some

419
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.180
also nutritional resources with other infants.

420
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:18.140
Correct. So we have a literature that talks quite

421
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.250
a bit in evolutionary psychology about the need for

422
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:27.030
infanticide. I mean, if you didn't have birth control,

423
00:26:27.439 --> 00:26:31.760
uh, you cannot terminate a pregnancy, so you give

424
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.619
birth to this baby and then you, you sacrifice

425
00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:38.959
this baby. Most of the time, this was an

426
00:26:38.959 --> 00:26:44.619
imperative of sad, difficult, regrettable imperative. And it would

427
00:26:44.619 --> 00:26:48.540
happen generally because a mother felt she could not

428
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.859
sustain this child. It would also happen because the

429
00:26:51.859 --> 00:26:53.780
child was deformed in some way and didn't have

430
00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:58.239
a chance of surviving, even if it was properly

431
00:26:58.239 --> 00:27:01.670
fed. So you have studies which show that if,

432
00:27:01.729 --> 00:27:03.949
if a mother gave birth to twins, one would

433
00:27:03.949 --> 00:27:08.239
be sacrificed. The idea being, it's a very, very

434
00:27:08.239 --> 00:27:11.750
harsh environment when it comes to nutrition, mothers have

435
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:17.150
enough to sustain only one child. And, you know,

436
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:20.660
I write also about this 9-month period, that first

437
00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.119
year, when you're reliant on breast milk, and it's

438
00:27:24.119 --> 00:27:28.500
an important 9 months. You have attachment, clear-cut attachment

439
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:32.640
at 9 months. You have mobility at 9. Months

440
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.260
you have cognitive development, joint attention available at 9

441
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.839
months. What else happens at 9 months? The possibility

442
00:27:40.839 --> 00:27:43.119
of the birth of a sibling. This would be

443
00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:46.359
the greatest tragedy for a child to encounter. Now

444
00:27:46.359 --> 00:27:50.640
you have to share your mother. And it's impossible

445
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.479
for this poor woman to really feed two children,

446
00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.640
so she's going to choose one. Now, it's really

447
00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.760
when I, you know, I used to write a

448
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.199
lot about jealousy, and some people would say, well,

449
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.000
you know, I don't see it these days. I

450
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.839
mean, my kids get along with one another. It's

451
00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:06.199
not a matter of life and death. If you

452
00:28:06.199 --> 00:28:08.520
have another child, you can have twins and they'll

453
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.439
both be fine. You can hire a nanny, you

454
00:28:10.439 --> 00:28:13.630
can breastfeed both, you can put formula, they'll live.

455
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.270
Maybe it won't be the perfect environment. And maybe

456
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.469
you'll be a little bit exhausted and so exhausted

457
00:28:19.469 --> 00:28:21.910
you don't even remember it, but the babies will

458
00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:24.229
live. We're talking in an environment where it was

459
00:28:24.229 --> 00:28:27.469
a matter of life and death. So the birth

460
00:28:27.469 --> 00:28:29.709
of a sibling was a matter of life or

461
00:28:29.709 --> 00:28:33.150
death. The mother could also be impacted, meaning that

462
00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:35.709
if the interbirth interval is something less than 2

463
00:28:35.709 --> 00:28:39.250
years, this mother's chance of surviving childbirth is not

464
00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:45.219
good. So maternal mortality meant infant mortality because if

465
00:28:45.219 --> 00:28:49.979
the mother dies, the toddler dies. So, obviously, the,

466
00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:54.660
the conditions where you have to find a way

467
00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.500
to encourage birth spacing are of paramount importance to

468
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.459
the survival of the species. One of the interesting,

469
00:29:01.619 --> 00:29:06.250
um, literatures that I, I ran into, um, Talked

470
00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:11.930
about the explosion, the population explosion that happened around

471
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:17.359
9000 years ago when agrarian villages started to be

472
00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:21.170
formed. And so in these villages, the populations would

473
00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:25.910
expand. Uh, YOU could find wet nurses, you could

474
00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:30.569
find animal husbandry, you could have goat milk or

475
00:29:30.569 --> 00:29:33.040
cow's milk or maybe some other kind of milk.

476
00:29:33.949 --> 00:29:37.520
And you would think that, oh, all of these

477
00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.520
great things happened. It was an advance because everybody

478
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.339
became specialized, some people did this, some people did

479
00:29:44.339 --> 00:29:46.979
that. I mean, it gave birth to the society

480
00:29:46.979 --> 00:29:49.000
that we are in today, and we live more

481
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.640
like that than we do living like in caves.

482
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.160
Oh, but the infant mortality rate went down. Why

483
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.290
would that happen? Well, it went down because birth

484
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:03.719
spacing was no longer regulated. By the, the 3

485
00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:07.270
years of breastfeeding that had been compulsory pretty much.

486
00:30:07.439 --> 00:30:09.630
It was compulsory because your baby didn't have teeth.

487
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.219
My mothers didn't know that the baby required breast

488
00:30:12.219 --> 00:30:14.780
milk for nutrition. She might not know that, you

489
00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:19.319
know, passive resistance to disease, uh, doesn't really work

490
00:30:19.319 --> 00:30:25.089
very well. Uh, um, UNLESS you breastfeed, but, um,

491
00:30:25.579 --> 00:30:27.780
they go teeth. Oh, the baby has teeth, you

492
00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.900
can chew the food, you really need molars cause

493
00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.380
you don't have the blender, you don't have a

494
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.040
metal fork, you know, pounding something with a stone

495
00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.500
really doesn't work as well as what we have

496
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.010
available today. So you really have to breastfeed for

497
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:44.329
3 years now. You have these villages. You have

498
00:30:44.329 --> 00:30:48.119
other sources of breast milk, wet nurses, cow's milk.

499
00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:52.089
You have villages, they start to grow grains and

500
00:30:52.089 --> 00:30:54.650
grains can be cooked and mashed up into something

501
00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:56.530
soft that you can feed a baby, and so

502
00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:00.369
they would breastfeed for less than 3 years, not

503
00:31:00.369 --> 00:31:02.930
because they were lazy, but because the, the, the

504
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:06.719
calories that are required are extraordinary, greater than for,

505
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.229
uh, pregnancy. So if you're breastfeeding a 2 year

506
00:31:10.229 --> 00:31:11.949
old, it's taking a lot of calories out of

507
00:31:11.949 --> 00:31:13.949
you, and, yes, it's taking up a lot of

508
00:31:13.949 --> 00:31:16.510
time and energy that you can give to somebody

509
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:20.040
else to do and now you're free to. Birth

510
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.020
rate exploded, population exploded, but the infant mortality rate

511
00:31:24.229 --> 00:31:29.859
actually went up. So having, um, birth spacing is

512
00:31:29.859 --> 00:31:34.459
crucial to survival of children and to women. And

513
00:31:34.459 --> 00:31:38.339
in most of these literatures, when you open up

514
00:31:38.339 --> 00:31:42.260
the books on infant mortality in some of the

515
00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.060
really harsh environments that exist today, public health is

516
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:52.000
almost exclusively about what, birth control, birth spacing, breastfeeding.

517
00:31:52.699 --> 00:31:56.969
Um, Gates Foundation funded a large number of studies,

518
00:31:56.979 --> 00:31:59.780
and they talk about the 1st 1000 days, that

519
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:04.189
is pregnancy, first year and second year. So the

520
00:32:04.189 --> 00:32:08.670
epidemiologists would, you know, the literatures don't really connect

521
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:12.510
really perfectly well. The epidemiologists would talk about infancy

522
00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:16.930
is 0 to 12 months. And then they have

523
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:21.170
this early childhood 12 months to 5 years, but

524
00:32:21.489 --> 00:32:24.140
really that barrier at 12 months is not a

525
00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.439
good one. It's really, it should be 24 months,

526
00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.349
and these 1st 1000 days goes up to that

527
00:32:30.349 --> 00:32:33.849
second birthday, meaning that your chances of you are

528
00:32:33.849 --> 00:32:37.969
incredibly delicate up until that time. After that, you

529
00:32:37.969 --> 00:32:41.930
are somewhat more robust up until the age of

530
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:45.329
5, so mortality is high up until 5, but

531
00:32:45.329 --> 00:32:47.520
the highest rates are in the 1st 2 years,

532
00:32:47.569 --> 00:32:49.719
and the second year is as high as the

533
00:32:49.719 --> 00:32:52.930
first year but for different reasons. For the first

534
00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.530
year, it's usually in the first few months after

535
00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:59.569
childbirth and their birth complications. From then through to

536
00:32:59.569 --> 00:33:04.729
the 2nd birthday, it is about nutrition. And for

537
00:33:04.729 --> 00:33:08.760
the mother, it's about the just the energetic burden

538
00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.250
of breastfeeding while being pregnant, which is too much

539
00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:16.920
for women in these very, very harsh environments. So

540
00:33:16.969 --> 00:33:20.760
we understand a lot about birth spacing, not just

541
00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:25.579
um. A question about will the kids get along

542
00:33:25.579 --> 00:33:27.979
with one another. It's really a matter of survival.

543
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.780
And really if it's not a matter of survival,

544
00:33:30.859 --> 00:33:32.579
there are plenty of families with kids who were

545
00:33:32.579 --> 00:33:34.540
born 1 year apart or 2 years apart, or

546
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.020
even twins, and they're just fine. We live in

547
00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.339
a very different environment. There are many substitutes for

548
00:33:40.339 --> 00:33:43.770
breast milk, and everything else that breastfeeding would provide,

549
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.979
which is the loving attentive care, can be provided

550
00:33:46.979 --> 00:33:53.020
by caregivers, nannies, babysitters, relatives, fathers, you name it.

551
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.060
It's, it's a very flexible. IN that respect.

552
00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:59.469
So let me ask you now a question that

553
00:33:59.469 --> 00:34:02.010
I think will also serve as a sort of

554
00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:06.640
segue into the topic of parent offspring conflict here.

555
00:34:06.969 --> 00:34:10.409
Um, WHAT kinds of behaviors on the part of

556
00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:15.168
infants serve to protect them against the risks we've

557
00:34:15.168 --> 00:34:19.050
talked about here, like, for example, under nutrition, close

558
00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.250
birth spacing, and so on.

559
00:34:22.299 --> 00:34:26.409
So this is um Let me digress for a

560
00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:29.610
minute. Um, WHEN I was a child living in

561
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.208
a multilingual environment, I would be surprised if you

562
00:34:32.208 --> 00:34:35.000
sneezed and you were English, you'd say bless you,

563
00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.580
and if you sneezed and you spoke German, it's

564
00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:42.458
gesundheit, which means health. They don't translate, um, and

565
00:34:42.458 --> 00:34:44.370
this is that just was sort of peculiar to

566
00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.320
me. And so all I could take from that

567
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.679
is two people are talking about the same event,

568
00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:56.239
but And they It's an important event. It's not

569
00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:58.560
a random event. They don't say something when you

570
00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.229
cough or when you hiccup, only when you sneeze.

571
00:35:01.399 --> 00:35:03.550
Why would that be? Oh, there's something about this.

572
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:09.300
So parent offspring conflict and attachment behavior and sibling

573
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:16.239
rivalry are actually talking about the same kind of

574
00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:20.699
event where separation between the mother and the child

575
00:35:20.919 --> 00:35:24.959
is the crux of the dilemma. And the attachment

576
00:35:24.959 --> 00:35:26.800
theorists look at it very much from the point

577
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.040
of view of the child. The child demonstrates protest

578
00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:35.760
behavior, separation protest, jealousy protest. They understand it as

579
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.399
being behavior that is necessary to keep the mother

580
00:35:38.399 --> 00:35:42.169
from leaving. And there's a vast body of literature

581
00:35:42.169 --> 00:35:45.179
on why it happens, how it happens, when it

582
00:35:45.179 --> 00:35:48.060
happens, what are, what do we know about the

583
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.979
different ways in which it happens? Do they show

584
00:35:50.979 --> 00:35:54.689
resistance? Are they especially feisty? Are they more passive?

585
00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.219
Are they male? Are they female? Do they live

586
00:35:57.219 --> 00:36:00.590
in in group environments, and individual environments? Are they

587
00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:03.060
in daycare? Are they not? It's like all this

588
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.729
information about what happens when the mother leaves. Not

589
00:36:06.729 --> 00:36:10.010
so much attention to why the mother leaves. Why

590
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:12.649
the mother leaves would be something that Bowby saw

591
00:36:12.649 --> 00:36:16.129
as an atypical event, because in his environment it

592
00:36:16.129 --> 00:36:18.969
was. It was either what he wrote about where

593
00:36:18.969 --> 00:36:21.729
it was either a war broke out and we're

594
00:36:21.729 --> 00:36:23.689
shipping our children off to the countryside where we

595
00:36:23.689 --> 00:36:26.129
think it'll be safer for them, which is traumatic

596
00:36:26.129 --> 00:36:29.199
for the mothers and for the children. Or somebody's

597
00:36:29.199 --> 00:36:31.340
in the hospital, which is also traumatic for the

598
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.659
mothers and babies. These are atypical events, they don't

599
00:36:33.659 --> 00:36:36.780
happen in a normal environment. Or he's, well these's

600
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.139
early work was uh dealing with a lot of

601
00:36:39.139 --> 00:36:43.469
psychopathology. And so uh it would be atypical. These

602
00:36:43.469 --> 00:36:48.060
were mothers who were criminals, they're on drugs. Nowhere

603
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.389
was it seen as something that happens as a

604
00:36:50.389 --> 00:36:56.939
rather typical, inevitable, possibly even adaptive kind of activity.

605
00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:00.280
So now you're talking about parent and offspring conflict.

606
00:37:00.639 --> 00:37:04.550
So it's taken very much from the point of

607
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:09.149
where It's a social environment. Other people help you.

608
00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.919
You help these other people. You have to take

609
00:37:11.919 --> 00:37:14.310
care of your other children. You have a partner.

610
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.439
You have other demands. People took care of you

611
00:37:17.439 --> 00:37:19.840
when you were pregnant and throwing up for the

612
00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.600
1st 3 months. Now you have to take care

613
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.639
of them. Your baby isn't the only child in

614
00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:28.360
the world. You have other obligations, and you have

615
00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:33.500
to navigate that in a way. That is unavoidable

616
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:37.189
and perhaps in a way that is as sensitive

617
00:37:37.459 --> 00:37:41.459
and tactful as it can possibly be. And after

618
00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:43.939
all, there are other caregivers in the environment, so

619
00:37:43.939 --> 00:37:47.100
it shouldn't be so bad because there's dad and

620
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.780
the grandmother and other children. So it's seen as

621
00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.780
a typical event. It might even be an adaptive

622
00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.790
event from my point of view, but let's just

623
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:58.580
go back to this. So here's two different ways

624
00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.620
of looking at the same thing and how do

625
00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.379
you put it together so that you can see

626
00:38:03.379 --> 00:38:06.449
how they actually are talking about the same thing

627
00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.860
that the attachment theories really aren't recognizing why mother's

628
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.179
doing what she's doing in a way that could

629
00:38:13.179 --> 00:38:18.439
possibly make sense. And uh Trivers was talking about

630
00:38:18.439 --> 00:38:22.080
parent and offspringing conflict as the child just Uh,

631
00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:27.570
demonstrating and a psychological weapon, so which it kind

632
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.419
of is, and that's as much as he had

633
00:38:29.419 --> 00:38:31.379
to say and nobody had anything more to say.

634
00:38:31.459 --> 00:38:34.780
It's a weapon you target the mom and mom

635
00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:38.340
caves, if you're lucky and cave, you know, if

636
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:42.070
you weaponize it enough, so she' care. Uh, SO

637
00:38:42.489 --> 00:38:44.209
how do you put these together? Well, you put

638
00:38:44.209 --> 00:38:47.929
it together simply by understanding they're both right, that

639
00:38:47.929 --> 00:38:51.199
yes, others would leave, it's adaptive, it's appropriate behavior.

640
00:38:51.449 --> 00:38:54.590
On the other hand, the psychological weapon is actually

641
00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:59.659
attachment behavior. Attachment behavior would not have happened if

642
00:38:59.659 --> 00:39:02.659
mothers didn't leave. Otherwise, why would you protest if

643
00:39:02.659 --> 00:39:05.010
you simply say, Oh, Mummy, I'm hungry right now.

644
00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.020
You may feed me. That if that was enough,

645
00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.500
that's what babies would have done because actually it's

646
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.899
really exhausting for a baby to scream and cry

647
00:39:12.899 --> 00:39:16.129
and demonstrate the psychological weapon known as attachment behavior.

648
00:39:16.419 --> 00:39:19.340
Wouldn't you rather just simply, you know, wave and

649
00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:23.320
say feed me? And of course, um, The idea

650
00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:28.270
is that the babies who demonstrated the most vigorously

651
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:32.719
were the ones who survived. If they hadn't. They

652
00:39:32.719 --> 00:39:35.080
wouldn't bring her back. If they didn't bring her

653
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.520
back, they got really, really hungry, and if they

654
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.919
got really hungry, they also got really sick. So

655
00:39:40.919 --> 00:39:43.290
they had to demonstrate this behavior, and they wouldn't

656
00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:46.419
have done it. If the mothers had said, oh,

657
00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:48.729
I'll just stop all my other obligations and stay

658
00:39:48.729 --> 00:39:50.290
here and feed you all day until you're 12

659
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:53.100
years old, that's just never going to happen. So

660
00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:58.919
the attachment system is a system that in another

661
00:39:58.919 --> 00:40:01.949
body of literature can almost be viewed as the

662
00:40:01.949 --> 00:40:05.469
terrible twos or a sibling rivalry. There's many ways

663
00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:07.310
of looking at it, and they're all really talking

664
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:10.669
about the same thing, meaning I didn't get enough

665
00:40:10.669 --> 00:40:16.889
from money and the terrible twos. Attachment behavior, the

666
00:40:16.889 --> 00:40:20.280
psychological weapon, they're all talking about the same thing.

667
00:40:20.449 --> 00:40:22.850
What babies have to do to retain access to

668
00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:27.669
that caregiver. In the environment of evolutionary adaptiveness. You

669
00:40:27.669 --> 00:40:31.949
know, they would protest and there's many, many descriptions

670
00:40:31.949 --> 00:40:35.429
of that behavior, very colorful descriptions on like that,

671
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.750
but you live in an environment where there's multiple

672
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:40.889
caregivers available and so usually you get over it

673
00:40:40.889 --> 00:40:42.790
and you find out that the first few days

674
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.229
of daycare that are a little bit upsetting, but

675
00:40:45.229 --> 00:40:48.030
after all, they're not so bad because this daycare

676
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:49.949
centers kind of fun, the teachers are nice, the

677
00:40:49.949 --> 00:40:51.629
kids are fun to be with, and so they,

678
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:55.500
they kind of adapt. Um, IF protest behavior was

679
00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:59.419
pathology, you would find that. So it's adaptive behavior.

680
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.739
It's just not pleasant behavior, but they're really talking

681
00:41:02.739 --> 00:41:05.449
about the same thing, much as you're talking about,

682
00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:10.459
you know, gesundheit versus bless you when somebody sneezes.

683
00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:13.939
They're just pinpointing it from a different sort of

684
00:41:13.939 --> 00:41:17.300
angle. And so when mothers see it. SIBLING rivalry,

685
00:41:17.679 --> 00:41:21.300
uh, and evolutionary psychologists talk about a psychological weapon,

686
00:41:21.469 --> 00:41:24.750
and attachment theorists talk about protest behavior, you know,

687
00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:27.590
there's, there's shades of it. And what the attachment

688
00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:30.189
theorists have really done a great job of is

689
00:41:30.189 --> 00:41:33.580
saying there's ways of expressing this that are adaptive.

690
00:41:34.469 --> 00:41:37.419
When we used to do research on jealousy protest,

691
00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:41.270
you, you just see a range of behavior that

692
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:46.219
is awesome. And the most normal, the one. You

693
00:41:46.219 --> 00:41:48.820
know, approach Mother Wine and cling. It's like they

694
00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.260
all went to the United Nations and agreed. Approach

695
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.169
Mother Wine and cling, we'll get what we want.

696
00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:57.100
You'll have a subset, and they are different, and

697
00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.939
they have a repertoire that you really need to

698
00:41:58.939 --> 00:42:01.659
pay attention to. They're the kids who just freeze

699
00:42:01.659 --> 00:42:07.870
on the spot. There are the kids who Do

700
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:11.510
nothing until the mother comes back, and then they

701
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:15.770
throw a major temper tantrum. And you have the

702
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:21.090
kids who are, are just inconsolable once the mother

703
00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:24.610
comes back. There's just any kind of behavior. And

704
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:27.510
so the way to understand this jealousy is really

705
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:31.580
to understand the way we understand attachment behavior, but

706
00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.310
there is a, a way of expressing protest behavior

707
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:37.209
that is normal, adaptive, and a sign that the

708
00:42:37.209 --> 00:42:40.209
child is well adjusted, and there are these other

709
00:42:40.209 --> 00:42:45.669
behaviors. That are really cause for concern. So, well,

710
00:42:45.699 --> 00:42:47.860
they've done a very good job of refining the

711
00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:52.699
construct of the psychological weapon and say, OK. Deployed

712
00:42:52.699 --> 00:42:55.800
this way, they work, they make sense, they're under

713
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.820
control, they're well regulated, this child will be fine.

714
00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.929
Even though it's negative, this child will be fine.

715
00:43:02.219 --> 00:43:04.659
And then you have these other behaviors, I mean.

716
00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:09.120
If a child clings to the experimenter rather than

717
00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.560
the mother who's holding the other baby, it's not

718
00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.719
a good sign. Almost invariably when you see that

719
00:43:14.719 --> 00:43:17.560
it's a child with a depressed mother, and they

720
00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:23.000
need help. So you know, you benefit tremendously from

721
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.159
both of these views and from the evolutionary psychologists

722
00:43:26.159 --> 00:43:29.560
who talk about the trade-offs. They're just being realistic.

723
00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:33.020
They're not mother bashing because she left her child.

724
00:43:33.189 --> 00:43:35.590
They're saying this is the environment that we live

725
00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:40.199
in. Mothers have to divide up their energy. There

726
00:43:40.199 --> 00:43:43.879
are other caregivers, and babies need to learn how

727
00:43:43.879 --> 00:43:47.639
to navigate a social environment where they deal with

728
00:43:47.639 --> 00:43:49.280
people other than mummy.

729
00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:54.090
And I mean, do we have a good understanding

730
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:59.449
of the factors that explain the development of those

731
00:43:59.939 --> 00:44:03.010
maladaptive behaviors you mentioned there?

732
00:44:03.459 --> 00:44:08.330
Uh, YEAH, I mean, we have, um, So you

733
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:10.959
have mothers leaving because, you know, a war broke

734
00:44:10.959 --> 00:44:14.560
out, somebody's in the hospital, uh, and you have

735
00:44:14.729 --> 00:44:20.929
other conditions where it's linked with maternal psychopathology. And

736
00:44:20.929 --> 00:44:24.889
if you can pinpoint the child behavior. Just statistically

737
00:44:24.889 --> 00:44:28.090
you could say this is abnormal statistically. And then

738
00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:31.010
you take that group and you say, OK, tell

739
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:34.000
me about their environment. You will end up saying,

740
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:36.649
tell me about their mothers. There might be more

741
00:44:36.649 --> 00:44:39.929
in their environment, and often there is, but the

742
00:44:39.929 --> 00:44:42.120
key thing for a very young baby will be,

743
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:45.120
tell us about these mothers. And what you find

744
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.530
is a lot of maternal psychopathology, a lot of

745
00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:53.810
postpartum depression, uh, drug, alcohol use, poverty that exacerbates

746
00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:57.469
every problem that you ever had. Uh, LACK of

747
00:44:57.469 --> 00:45:00.530
social support. I mean, we have a large literature

748
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:06.000
on that. What we don't have. IS a literature

749
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:13.010
on how breastfeeding actually feeds into this. So If

750
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:19.080
breast milk is important for infant health, What does

751
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:23.689
milk production What does breastfeeding behavior do for mothers?

752
00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.340
And we really don't have the full answer to

753
00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:31.899
that. There is some evidence that there's a protective

754
00:45:31.899 --> 00:45:38.919
influence. Um, BUT we don't fully recognize. So yes,

755
00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:44.679
mothers on some combination of drugs, alcohol, depression, you

756
00:45:44.679 --> 00:45:48.620
can say, OK, these children, we understand, you know,

757
00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:51.739
what's going on. So the next question becomes, OK,

758
00:45:51.879 --> 00:45:54.520
so what can you do about this? How can

759
00:45:54.520 --> 00:46:03.030
you Prevent it? How can you? Modify it And

760
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:06.030
so there's always a question of what does, what

761
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:11.219
does breastfeeding do for this? Um, We don't have

762
00:46:11.219 --> 00:46:15.580
a very clear answer. There's some sense that even

763
00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.699
though the breast milk consumption has nothing to do

764
00:46:18.699 --> 00:46:22.100
with attachment in babies, it's the behavior. In mothers,

765
00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:25.139
milk production sets up a very different set of

766
00:46:25.139 --> 00:46:29.620
hormones that's, I mean, it's like being pregnant, you're

767
00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:34.409
different. And there's some sense that it has some

768
00:46:34.409 --> 00:46:39.179
kind of protective effect. Does that mean all mothers

769
00:46:39.179 --> 00:46:42.219
need to breastfeed? No. Does it mean that if

770
00:46:42.219 --> 00:46:46.350
a mother is in a high risk situation, somehow

771
00:46:46.739 --> 00:46:53.860
that profile, that endocrine profile of lactogenesis and lactation

772
00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:59.300
would somehow change the way the mother reacts to

773
00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.780
becoming a mother and caring for a child? It's

774
00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.070
possible. Mhm.

775
00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:09.199
So, uh, and how about uh fathers? I mean,

776
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:14.229
because in our own species, particularly compared to uh

777
00:47:14.469 --> 00:47:22.870
to our close, closest primate relatives, um, apparently, human

778
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:28.939
males tend to invest more heavily into their offspring.

779
00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:33.290
So, I mean, Uh, what, what is the role

780
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:37.689
that fathers might play here and, uh, I mean,

781
00:47:38.429 --> 00:47:43.159
do they matter when it comes to exploring this

782
00:47:43.159 --> 00:47:47.840
issue of attachment and parent offspring conflict?

783
00:47:48.929 --> 00:47:54.270
So, in an environment where Sustenance can be provided

784
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:57.479
by anyone. That means it does not depend on

785
00:47:57.479 --> 00:48:01.189
the mother breastfeeding. In an environment where you have

786
00:48:01.189 --> 00:48:04.459
decent healthcare systems, where if a child does get

787
00:48:04.459 --> 00:48:06.350
sick, you go to the doctor and they probably

788
00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:09.560
get antibiotics and they'll be just fine. So we

789
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.580
live in an environment where fathers are as important

790
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:17.000
as mothers, and these roles have changed tremendously on

791
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.330
it. Look at young men now and I think

792
00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:24.379
about my father, boy, they're different species. So, uh,

793
00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:27.689
the younger men have started to realize women are

794
00:48:27.689 --> 00:48:30.050
changing. They're going to work even though they have

795
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:34.340
young babies, even while they're pregnant, and men are

796
00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:39.050
picking up where they feel like there's a void

797
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:40.610
for them and a lot of them enjoy it

798
00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:45.290
a lot. If you think about how we evolved,

799
00:48:45.459 --> 00:48:50.219
I'm not so sure men were that relevant to

800
00:48:50.219 --> 00:48:54.260
caring for babies, and I think that the, the,

801
00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.860
the love relationship between infant and mother and infant

802
00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:00.419
and other caregivers, if we had to think about

803
00:49:00.419 --> 00:49:04.469
the evolved basis of that love relationship, it's different.

804
00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:09.070
That not one isn't better than the other, but

805
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:12.510
they're just different. If that mother-child relationship was the

806
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:15.189
one that was really pivotal to survival and the

807
00:49:15.189 --> 00:49:19.750
infant caregiver relationship was one where the baby had

808
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.020
more agency and who they chose to be with.

809
00:49:23.389 --> 00:49:26.179
Then it's the one where they had to use

810
00:49:26.179 --> 00:49:28.820
and develop some kind of social skills and to

811
00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.979
have some kind of flexibility so they know how

812
00:49:30.979 --> 00:49:33.820
to navigate this environment and maybe they seek out

813
00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.520
their fathers and fathers felt as though they contribute

814
00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.290
because they've been sought out. Uh, IT sort of

815
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:43.570
creates not one being more important, but just different.

816
00:49:43.649 --> 00:49:46.330
And I would say that to the extent that

817
00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:49.209
we can characterize that mother-infant relationship because it was

818
00:49:49.209 --> 00:49:52.250
so, I mean, it was so ubiquitous in the

819
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:55.169
very same way wherever you were on the planet

820
00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:59.370
versus that father relationship which would have varied tremendously

821
00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:02.409
depending upon where you were, uh, it's so it's

822
00:50:02.409 --> 00:50:08.060
harder to characterize that relationship. But it's just as

823
00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:11.239
important because without those social skills, I mean we

824
00:50:11.239 --> 00:50:14.169
would indulge our babies forever. And they have to

825
00:50:14.169 --> 00:50:17.330
learn that to function in a society. And so

826
00:50:17.489 --> 00:50:20.090
it's just a different kind of love relationship. One

827
00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:22.810
of the problems of attachment theory and in all

828
00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:25.010
theories is, is that you're sort of stuck with

829
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:27.010
this word love, you know, when Bowby came up

830
00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:29.530
with attachment and, and Ainsworth is saying, you know,

831
00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:32.169
it's just another word for love. It's, you're trying

832
00:50:32.169 --> 00:50:36.090
to come up with other words. And why? Because

833
00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:39.090
you really need to find a way to refine

834
00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:43.250
this construct and different languages, you know, my Japanese

835
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:45.290
colleague would talk about Ama. I mean, there's just

836
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:48.419
different words that we use to talk about love

837
00:50:48.419 --> 00:50:51.530
and now we're just sort of constrained by, OK,

838
00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.689
it's attachment, OK, it's love. OK, so what is

839
00:50:54.689 --> 00:50:56.219
it? Well, we don't have the words and when

840
00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:59.969
you don't have the words, it becomes harder to

841
00:50:59.969 --> 00:51:04.020
describe, but I think that My hope would be

842
00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:08.209
that as we start to appreciate the father-child relationship,

843
00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:11.250
we don't compare it to the mother-child relationship, we

844
00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:14.510
just say this evolved in a different way and

845
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:16.709
maybe if we understand the context in which it

846
00:51:16.709 --> 00:51:19.739
evolved, we will understand it. In a way that

847
00:51:19.739 --> 00:51:21.860
is much more refined and maybe we'll even come

848
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.540
up with words that are better than the ones

849
00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.820
that we have now. One of the other things

850
00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:30.439
that always amused me with language, it was English

851
00:51:30.439 --> 00:51:35.010
has like and love. French does not. And other

852
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.969
languages don't either. And so like, well, what is

853
00:51:37.969 --> 00:51:40.169
it? Like, do only English people love? I mean,

854
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:42.139
it was just so confusing for me, but it

855
00:51:42.139 --> 00:51:46.540
still leaves me with a sense of Are they

856
00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:50.850
just different in degree? Or are they just different?

857
00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:53.889
And um I don't have an answer to that,

858
00:51:53.969 --> 00:51:56.209
but I wish we had more words. um, IN

859
00:51:56.209 --> 00:51:58.760
any case, to answer your question, I think the

860
00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:03.800
evolved basis of the father infant. Friendship will come

861
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:08.560
to light if we Consider it as having evolved

862
00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:10.399
in a different context.

863
00:52:11.639 --> 00:52:14.199
So let me just ask you then one last

864
00:52:14.199 --> 00:52:19.600
question. You mentioned earlier how love relationships with mothers

865
00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:25.600
differ from those with non-maternal caregivers, but in what

866
00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.669
ways exactly? I mean, do

867
00:52:27.669 --> 00:52:31.060
we? In the present day setting, they don't. OK.

868
00:52:31.379 --> 00:52:36.530
Just say that they evolved. In a different capacity

869
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:40.770
and so the mother-child relationship and the caregiver relationship

870
00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:44.770
now really would be indistinguishable. The fact that they

871
00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:48.729
evolved in a different context might suggest that there's

872
00:52:48.729 --> 00:52:52.570
something different about them, but we have not determined.

873
00:52:52.929 --> 00:52:56.129
You can't do a study today and find what

874
00:52:56.129 --> 00:52:59.689
that difference is. It's, it's not as though the

875
00:52:59.689 --> 00:53:02.760
mother is irreplaceable because she's not.

876
00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:09.120
Right. Right. So, the book is again attachment and

877
00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:12.399
parent offspring conflict. I'm leaving a link to it

878
00:53:12.399 --> 00:53:16.270
in the description of the interview. And Doctor Hart,

879
00:53:16.429 --> 00:53:19.870
just before we go, apart from the book, are

880
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:23.510
there any places on the internet where people can

881
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:24.540
find your work?

882
00:53:25.439 --> 00:53:28.459
Um, THERE'S a number of publications in the scientific

883
00:53:28.459 --> 00:53:31.300
literature, a couple of books, but I must admit

884
00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:33.179
I haven't done a lot of videos, so this

885
00:53:33.179 --> 00:53:34.010
would be the one.

886
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.760
