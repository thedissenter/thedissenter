00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.809
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:05.650
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:08.569
joined by Dr Andrew Coy. He is an assistant

4
00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:12.430
teaching professor of Philosophy at Arizona State University. He

5
00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.149
works primarily at the intersection of moral philosophy, moral

6
00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:20.569
psych theology and metaphysics on issues surrounding free will

7
00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.729
and moral responsibility. And today we're focusing mostly on

8
00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:29.680
moral responsibility, punishment, forgiveness and other related topics. So

9
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.790
Dr Currie, welcome to the show. It's a big

10
00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:32.799
pleasure to have you.

11
00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:35.099
Thank you. I'm very happy to be here. Thank

12
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.069
you for inviting me.

13
00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:39.990
OK. So I would like to start with this

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.159
question that is sort of related to moral responsibility

15
00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:48.569
in a way, but we have this common idea

16
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.939
that agents can be blame worthy only for acts

17
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.849
that are morally wrong. But is the, is there

18
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.369
any issue with that claim?

19
00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:03.750
Good. Yeah. So I guess I'll start by saying

20
00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:06.849
a little bit about how I and many philosophers

21
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.269
kind of understand these kinds of notions. Um So,

22
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.180
so first of all, we have rightness and wrongness

23
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.879
and these are typically understood to be like evaluations

24
00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:20.349
of actions. So murder is wrong. That's a kind

25
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.919
of action, it's kind of normative or ethical status

26
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.139
is that it's wrong um giving to charity when

27
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.919
you can easily do so and it will create

28
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.449
some good in the world is the right sort

29
00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:32.629
of thing to do. So again, that's a kind

30
00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:35.400
of action. And then the idea is that it's

31
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.220
normative or ethical status is that if it's right

32
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.139
morally, right? And so there's different views on what

33
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.139
makes right acts right or wrong acts wrong. So

34
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.279
for example, many of you will have heard of

35
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.940
the theory of utilitarianism. So utilitarianism says that here's

36
00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:56.959
what makes an act right? It produces the most

37
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.500
overall happiness. Um And then there's other sorts of

38
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.040
views kind of common going views for rightness and

39
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.149
wrongness. So another is virtue, ethics frequently associated with

40
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.020
Aristotle. And then cons moral philosophy is another account

41
00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:14.809
of what makes right act right or wrong acts

42
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.970
wrong. So moral responsibility, by contrast, which I take

43
00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:23.110
to be the extent to which someone is blame

44
00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.479
worthy or praiseworthy. This is a different sort of

45
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.869
evaluation. So rather than targeting like an action most

46
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.259
fundamentally, it targets people or say agents beings with

47
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.130
a capacity for action. Um So more responsibility than

48
00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.770
is kind of commonly construed in terms of the

49
00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:49.279
appropriateness of certain reactive attitudes. Um That's a phrase

50
00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.850
that goes back to 1/20 century 20th century philosopher

51
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.839
named PF Strauss. So if someone's blame worthy, well,

52
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.960
then they're worthy of blame or blaming attitudes. And

53
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.300
these are attitudes like resentment, indignation or in the

54
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:08.000
first personal case, guilt. Um On the other hand,

55
00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:10.339
if someone is praiseworthy, then they're worthy of different

56
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.389
sort of attitudes by praising attitudes, gratitude appreciation, things

57
00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:18.009
like this. So that's kind of how I understand

58
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.800
rightness and wrongness on the one hand, and then

59
00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:24.399
blame worthiness and praiseworthiness. On the other hand, so

60
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.869
that claim that you mentioned kind of links blame

61
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.479
worthiness very closely with wrongness. So it says that

62
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.380
only wrong acts can be blameworthy, which is to

63
00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.770
say that wrongness is a necessary condition of blameworthiness.

64
00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:43.009
Blame worthiness is limited to wrong acts. And so

65
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.580
the problem for me with that kind of claim

66
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:47.460
is that because these are just kind of fundamentally

67
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.929
different sorts of evaluations, what matters for blameworthiness isn't

68
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.389
necessarily what matters for wrongness. And if you link

69
00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:57.520
them very tightly in that way, then it turns

70
00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.919
out that blame worthiness can be affected by factors

71
00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:02.649
that it seems like shouldn't be able to affect

72
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.940
it. And then that gives rise to what I

73
00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:10.179
would call a problematic form of moral luck. So

74
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.949
the idea here to kind of illustrate and give

75
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.139
some concrete cases here. So I think, I think

76
00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:17.320
it's possible that there's cases in which a person

77
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.619
is blameworthy, but they didn't do anything wrong. So

78
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.690
that would be uh what philosophers call a counterexample

79
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.570
to that principle or that claim that you mentioned

80
00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:29.670
initially. So for a first sort of case, we

81
00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:32.779
might imagine a case in which someone acts with

82
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.549
sinister motives or morally criticized motives, but kind of

83
00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:39.179
by luck gets it right. They accidentally get it

84
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.130
right. So, for one of many examples, we can

85
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.869
kind of cook up, imagine someone who's involved in

86
00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:48.190
a road rage incident. Right. So someone cuts them

87
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.630
off, they get flooded with anger and they shoot

88
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.779
and kill the p the driver that cut them

89
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.679
off, right? Clearly a blame worthy action, right? But

90
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.079
it could turn out that the person who died

91
00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:05.709
was unbeknownst to the killer, like a serial killer,

92
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.049
right? So it's like good that the person was

93
00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.739
killed because they would have gone on to say

94
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.290
commit many more murders. So at least on some

95
00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:17.350
accounts of rightness and wrongness, like on utilitarianism, that

96
00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:20.470
act would be counted as right. And so if

97
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.440
we accept that common claim, then we could not

98
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.690
say that the person is blameworthy for that road

99
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.089
rage incident. But intuitively that seems incorrect. And then

100
00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:32.019
for a second sort of case, I think there

101
00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.540
is, I think we can think of cases in

102
00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:37.250
which a person again acts with sinister, morally critic,

103
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.359
sizeable motives, but knowingly does the right thing. So

104
00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:43.489
it's like they know they are doing the right

105
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.230
thing, they know it's the right thing, but they

106
00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:48.260
can still act for bad motivations. And the idea

107
00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:51.059
here is that for many acts that are right

108
00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.760
they're right because the considerations in favor of them

109
00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:58.980
outweigh the considerations against them. But a person might

110
00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:02.410
act just purely in virtue of the considerations that

111
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.540
count against the action. So for example, here, we

112
00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:10.579
might imagine um a case of the sadistic pediatrician.

113
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.359
So this is a person who just hates kids,

114
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.589
wants nothing more than to cause kids pain and

115
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.959
thinks what career should I go into? I know

116
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.779
pediatrics because then I can give kids shots all

117
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.190
day long, hurt them and no one will suspect

118
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.450
a thing kind of a loophole that I found

119
00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:34.070
here. So, so. Right. So the pediatrician does the

120
00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:37.040
right thing by giving Children their needed shots and

121
00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:41.510
vaccinations, but does so only because they want to

122
00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:44.380
cause pain. And again, so here it's like, well

123
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.760
intuitively, I wouldn't want, I wouldn't want to be

124
00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:49.549
around that person. Right. I would react to that

125
00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:52.600
person with blaming attitudes and I would think that

126
00:06:52.609 --> 00:06:55.540
that would be the appropriate response. Um, BUT they're

127
00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:58.899
doing the right thing. Um, AND so just as

128
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.239
a person might be blameworthy for doing something that

129
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.250
isn't wrong, we kind of have the flip side

130
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.890
when we turn to praiseworthiness as well. So a

131
00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:08.760
person might indeed be praiseworthy for doing something that

132
00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:11.690
is wrong. Right. So for example, if they're reasonably

133
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.369
trying to do the right thing, so suppose you

134
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.859
give someone what you reasonably believe to be a

135
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:21.059
very needed and life saving medication. But it's been

136
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.829
secretly replaced with poison or maybe unbeknownst to you,

137
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.820
the person has a fatal allergy to that medication.

138
00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:30.149
There's nothing, no way that you could have known.

139
00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:33.209
Um, SO in that sort of case still, it

140
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.279
seems like to me, the person's worthy and maybe

141
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.970
a praising attitudes, even though what they did wasn't

142
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.079
right, at least on many moral theories, many theories

143
00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:47.410
of rightness and wrongness. Um, AND so the lesson

144
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.760
that I take from thinking about these sorts of

145
00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:53.000
cases is that for me, what matters for blame

146
00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.829
worthiness and praiseworthiness is really like exclusively a person's

147
00:07:56.839 --> 00:08:02.760
internal psychological states, their character, their motives, their values,

148
00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:07.420
these sorts of things. But on most moral theories,

149
00:08:07.429 --> 00:08:11.179
rightness and wrongness are not exclusively a function of

150
00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:15.100
the person, the agents, internal psychological state. So it's

151
00:08:15.109 --> 00:08:17.350
not true on utilitarianism, that's not true in virtue

152
00:08:17.359 --> 00:08:20.519
ethics. Arguably it's not true on consent, moral theory

153
00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:24.899
as well. Um And so instead for these, for

154
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.209
many of these theories anyways, what matters for rightness

155
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.489
and wrongness is some other things, some effect out

156
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.859
in the world. At least it's not only a

157
00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:35.799
person's internal psychological states. So I defend kind of

158
00:08:35.808 --> 00:08:41.250
an internalist. And so given, given those, given those

159
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.539
facts, then linking blame worthiness very tightly to wrongness

160
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.469
will lead to what I call problematic forms of

161
00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:51.599
moral luck. And so this is when blame worthiness

162
00:08:51.609 --> 00:08:54.520
can be affected by factors that are from the

163
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.979
agent's perspective, just a matter of luck. Um, SO

164
00:08:58.989 --> 00:09:01.770
for example, right. For the road raging driver. Um,

165
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.099
IT'S just a matter of luck that the victim

166
00:09:04.109 --> 00:09:05.770
turned out to be a serial killer. So it

167
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.349
seems like that fact shouldn't be able to affect

168
00:09:08.359 --> 00:09:10.260
the blame worthiness of that person.

169
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.690
Mhm. Yes. So, uh, yeah, I was just about

170
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.739
to ask you because you mentioned the three biggest

171
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.479
moral theories out there. I think we could call

172
00:09:21.489 --> 00:09:26.210
them. There is virtue, ethics, utilitarianism slash consequentialism and

173
00:09:26.219 --> 00:09:30.200
deontology or cant ethics. And uh I was just

174
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.570
trying, as you were talking, I was trying to

175
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.413
remember if any of them had any add, something

176
00:09:37.422 --> 00:09:41.862
specific to say about internal states and intentionality and

177
00:09:41.872 --> 00:09:44.513
motives and all of that. And of course, the

178
00:09:44.523 --> 00:09:48.833
consequentialist slash the utilitarians, I don't think they even

179
00:09:48.942 --> 00:09:53.783
care about that at all. Uh They can remember

180
00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:57.572
because I, I can't really remember a precise uh

181
00:09:57.583 --> 00:10:01.495
for example, book or author of, of any of

182
00:10:01.505 --> 00:10:07.245
those big moral theories that really talks much about

183
00:10:07.335 --> 00:10:12.296
uh internal states. Am I wrong here or not?

184
00:10:12.835 --> 00:10:17.596
So, it's sometimes addressed by some of these theories.

185
00:10:17.606 --> 00:10:20.515
So um I think John Stuart Mill who is

186
00:10:20.526 --> 00:10:24.630
one of the famous defenders of utilitarianism, um kind

187
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.489
of like agree or seems to make some comments,

188
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.059
suggesting some degree of agreement with kind of the

189
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.280
line of thought that I'm developing. So um so

190
00:10:33.289 --> 00:10:37.010
Mill says that the consequences matter very much or

191
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.200
determine the rightness or wrongness of the action, but

192
00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:42.900
they don't kind of directly matter for the moral

193
00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:44.690
worth of the person. So, in so far as

194
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.280
by moral worth, you mean something like moral responsibility,

195
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.679
then he, as one defender of utilitarianism might be

196
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.929
willing to, he might not want to accept that

197
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.559
claim that only wrong acts can be blameworthy. Um,

198
00:11:00.489 --> 00:11:04.950
A kind of big theme of deontology, deontological accounts

199
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.440
of moral responsibility and moral worth is that it's

200
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.849
about doing the right thing for the right reasons.

201
00:11:12.179 --> 00:11:14.159
And so that's kind of one step in the

202
00:11:14.169 --> 00:11:18.590
direction of thinking that what matters for responsibility is

203
00:11:18.599 --> 00:11:22.070
your motivations. But in so far as, you know,

204
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.919
that's kind of an expression of this idea that

205
00:11:23.929 --> 00:11:29.210
only, uh, not all right acts are praiseworthy, but

206
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.500
praiseworthiness is limited to right acts. And so in

207
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.750
so far as, and I'm not a content expert.

208
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.489
So I'm, you know, I'm not totally sure whether

209
00:11:39.619 --> 00:11:42.530
I have the right interpretation of content ethics. Um

210
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.739
But in so far as the ge ontological theory

211
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.340
does not say that the right thing is limited

212
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.010
to or the factors that determine rightness or wrongness

213
00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.960
are not limited to our internal psychological states, then

214
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.940
you'll get this problem that I'm kind of suggesting.

215
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.859
Yeah, I was also asking you that because it

216
00:12:04.869 --> 00:12:08.039
seems to me that at least when I hear

217
00:12:08.049 --> 00:12:14.840
these big ethicists talk about what's morally good or

218
00:12:14.849 --> 00:12:18.039
bad, they tend to focus a lot on the

219
00:12:18.049 --> 00:12:23.159
acts themselves. I mean, either the consequences are of

220
00:12:23.169 --> 00:12:26.919
the acts or the acts themselves based on some

221
00:12:27.289 --> 00:12:32.450
a priori values, for example. But it's mostly about

222
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.859
the acts and if the person herself had some

223
00:12:36.869 --> 00:12:40.440
good or bad intention as, uh, as long as

224
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:45.190
they did what's morally right to do. I mean,

225
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:51.140
they don't seem to care much about intentionality, motives

226
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.429
and stuff like that.

227
00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:55.000
Yeah, I think that's right. And, you know, their

228
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.830
focus is, I think a different sort of thing

229
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.640
than as someone who works on responsibility, what my

230
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.890
focus is. So, you know, there, if someone does

231
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.559
something good, if they add value to the world,

232
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.340
say, by saving lives or producing some good effect

233
00:13:10.349 --> 00:13:13.859
out there, then they might be willing to stop

234
00:13:13.869 --> 00:13:16.159
their inquiry into the responsibility of the person. They're

235
00:13:16.169 --> 00:13:19.359
like, well, good goodness was produced. So we might

236
00:13:19.369 --> 00:13:21.729
not have any interest in pursuing the question of

237
00:13:21.739 --> 00:13:23.409
responsibility further at that point.

238
00:13:24.049 --> 00:13:30.489
Mhm. And so are there, uh, any traditionally, let's

239
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.190
say in ethics and people focused, um, much on

240
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.280
moral responsibility itself or, or is that a more

241
00:13:40.289 --> 00:13:43.929
recent, uh, issue that people care about?

242
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:48.080
Yeah, that's a, that's a good question. So, I

243
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.590
mean, so discussion of responsibility kind of historically is

244
00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:55.460
tied up with the free Will debate. So that

245
00:13:55.469 --> 00:13:59.030
debate has been, you know, going on for 3000

246
00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:04.369
years. Um, AND one way to think of free

247
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:09.059
will is that it's the sense of control that

248
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.239
moral responsibility requires it's whatever kind of control we

249
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.429
would have to have if we were to be

250
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.500
morally responsible for our actions. So a lot of

251
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.440
the interest kind of in the free will debate,

252
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.719
um I think is generated from interest and uh

253
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:29.090
responsibility or interpersonal relations, whether punishment makes sense. Um

254
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.200
There's been kind of, I guess in the second

255
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.549
half of the 20th century with, um, this paper

256
00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:40.200
by PF Strauss, which is called freedom and resentment.

257
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.650
There is kind of renewed interest in looking at

258
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.580
moral responsibility and kind of directly looking at it

259
00:14:45.799 --> 00:14:49.599
um somewhat apart from what interest we might have

260
00:14:49.609 --> 00:14:51.619
in free will. And so I would say that

261
00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.940
there's been a bit of a resurgence in looking

262
00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.200
at responsibility kind of directly since then.

263
00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.159
Yeah. And I mean, it's not that people in

264
00:15:00.169 --> 00:15:06.530
human societies haven't been caring about attributing moral responsibility,

265
00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:09.739
either praise or blame for a very, very long

266
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.974
time, I guess as far as we exist uh

267
00:15:11.984 --> 00:15:16.325
uh as humans, right? So I was just trying

268
00:15:16.335 --> 00:15:18.674
to understand this really when it comes to the

269
00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:24.304
philosophers themselves, how much they've been interested in this

270
00:15:24.315 --> 00:15:27.085
specific topic traditionally?

271
00:15:27.544 --> 00:15:30.104
Yeah, many, so many, I mean, many historical philosophers

272
00:15:30.114 --> 00:15:31.775
will say something or other about it. So K

273
00:15:31.875 --> 00:15:34.044
does have an account of moral worth, kind of

274
00:15:34.054 --> 00:15:37.700
I was uh describing earlier that uh for an

275
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.869
act to have more worthy to be praised where

276
00:15:40.049 --> 00:15:41.650
you must do the right thing from the right

277
00:15:41.659 --> 00:15:44.520
reasons. Um So you get, so there are elements

278
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.299
of it kind of throughout the history of philosophy.

279
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.020
So moving on to a sort of relate comes

280
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:56.200
to criminal attempts specifically, I mean, uh sometimes it

281
00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:00.719
seems that, uh really, for example, in the case

282
00:16:00.729 --> 00:16:06.580
of murder, really committing murder or just attempting murder,

283
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:11.799
but unsuccessfully, sometimes it's a matter of luck. So

284
00:16:11.809 --> 00:16:14.419
do you think that when it comes to thinking

285
00:16:14.429 --> 00:16:21.039
about punishing people, uh, that really matters? I mean,

286
00:16:21.049 --> 00:16:24.640
because sometimes if you attempted murder, but you just

287
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:29.390
ended up not killing the person out of luck.

288
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.750
I mean, do you think that should really matter

289
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.299
when evaluating those cases?

290
00:16:36.619 --> 00:16:39.059
Yeah, good. So you kind of brought up, um,

291
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.890
what's known as the problem of criminal attempts or

292
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.989
the puzzle of criminal attempts? So, as a kind

293
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.260
of starting point here, right, in most penal systems

294
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.630
across the world, right? Murder gets punished much more

295
00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.520
severely than attempted murder, right? In the US. If

296
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.039
you're committed, if you're convicted of first degree murder,

297
00:16:57.049 --> 00:17:00.729
you might face the death penalty. Um, WHILE on

298
00:17:00.739 --> 00:17:02.510
the other hand, right, if you're convicted of attempted

299
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.489
murder, you might get a much more lenient sentence

300
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:12.900
of 1015 years. Um, POSSIBLY something like that, the

301
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.829
big difference, the punishment you're kind of eligible for.

302
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.219
Um, BUT then it seems like success or failure

303
00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:21.709
is often just up to, is a matter of

304
00:17:21.719 --> 00:17:24.500
luck, right? Whether the intended victim happened to be

305
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.739
wearing a bulletproof vest underneath their suit, the skill

306
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.819
of the surgeons attending to the victim, right? The

307
00:17:30.829 --> 00:17:33.290
surgeons are like super good. They might save the

308
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.150
life of the intended victim. And then there is

309
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.920
no murder and it's just attempted murder. Um And

310
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:42.770
then kind of a influential example coming from Thomas

311
00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.859
Nagel in a paper called Moral Luck. He introduced

312
00:17:45.869 --> 00:17:48.160
this idea that maybe after the trigger is pulled,

313
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.130
a bird flies into the path of the bullet

314
00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.640
intercepts the bullet and the victim is spared. So

315
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.459
it seems like whether a murderous attempt is successful

316
00:17:57.469 --> 00:18:00.819
or unsuccessful can often come down to luck. And

317
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.540
I might even argue, always comes down to luck

318
00:18:04.199 --> 00:18:07.030
and then to kind of broaden the scope of

319
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.750
the problem, we can notice that it's not just

320
00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.939
uh consequences or results that are attempted in which

321
00:18:12.949 --> 00:18:15.930
you have the same problem, right? So negligent drivers

322
00:18:15.939 --> 00:18:19.579
or drunk drivers who kill, get much more severe

323
00:18:19.589 --> 00:18:24.020
punishment than equally negligent drivers who don't or drunk

324
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.130
drivers who don't. Um But again, whether there's like

325
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.819
a pedestrian in the road as the driver cns

326
00:18:29.829 --> 00:18:32.609
by is not something that's in their control. So

327
00:18:32.619 --> 00:18:35.050
it's a matter of luck as far as the

328
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.810
driver is concerned. So, so the problem is a

329
00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:40.140
little bit bigger than just attempts, although the literature

330
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.569
itself, uh kind of cashes this out in terms

331
00:18:43.579 --> 00:18:47.369
of attempts. Um So then this raises the question,

332
00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.030
right? Um, ARE the successful, more blame worthy, are

333
00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.550
successful murderers in general, more blame worthy than they

334
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.739
are given that success or failure. Seems like it

335
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.390
can come down to luck or negligent drivers who

336
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.500
kill more blame worthy than equally negligent drivers who

337
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.979
don't. And so they kind of get a grip

338
00:19:06.989 --> 00:19:08.589
on this question and to try and engage this

339
00:19:08.599 --> 00:19:13.150
question. Um KIND of philosophers like to run thought

340
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.010
experiments which are um you know, kind of analogous

341
00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.170
to a scientific experiment. So we try and kind

342
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.229
of hold all factors fixed that we don't want

343
00:19:24.239 --> 00:19:26.689
to test for. We just wiggle the test factor

344
00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.369
and we see if it makes a difference in

345
00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.140
our experiment. So if we want to know whether

346
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.689
results or consequences matter, then we can compare two

347
00:19:35.699 --> 00:19:39.119
cases in which everything is exactly the same. Except

348
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:43.780
for this one thing, whether the result materializes and

349
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.250
if altering, whether the result occurs leads to kind

350
00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.550
of a change in our judgment of blameworthiness. Um

351
00:19:49.819 --> 00:19:53.579
THEN that's some evidence that results matter for blameworthiness.

352
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.050
And if you don't get any change in blame

353
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.819
worthiness, when you compare these cases while wiggling whether

354
00:19:58.829 --> 00:20:01.819
the result occurs or not, then that would be

355
00:20:01.829 --> 00:20:04.660
some evidence that results don't matter for blame worthiness.

356
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.300
So uh to do this, we can like imagine

357
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.619
a case in which an assassin um very carefully

358
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.579
aims his rifle at some intended victim, pulls the

359
00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:18.780
trigger. So there there's the attempt, it's a completed

360
00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:22.040
attempt. And then in the first scenario it's just

361
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.170
kind of a regular case with no funny business

362
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.579
and the victim is shot and killed. But in

363
00:20:26.589 --> 00:20:31.959
the second scenario, again, the triggers already been pulled.

364
00:20:31.969 --> 00:20:34.550
So all factors up to and including the like

365
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.680
the movement of the finger are identical across the

366
00:20:36.689 --> 00:20:38.670
two cases. And the second scenario, imagine that a

367
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.030
bird flies into the path of the bullet and

368
00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.739
intended victim is spared harm. So if you kind

369
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.369
of reflect on this case, and you try to

370
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.900
imagine it vividly um for many people and including

371
00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:55.189
myself, it's highly intuitive that they're equally blameworthy. And

372
00:20:55.199 --> 00:20:59.390
uh some experimental philosophers have kind of run experiments

373
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.930
and surveys testing this kind of judgment. It's a

374
00:21:01.939 --> 00:21:05.819
fairly robust judgment that people have. Um YOU know,

375
00:21:05.829 --> 00:21:07.310
an idea here is, well, how could the mere

376
00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:09.689
presence of the bird make a difference to the

377
00:21:09.699 --> 00:21:12.810
south and blame worthiness, right? Like it doesn't seem

378
00:21:12.819 --> 00:21:15.729
like he could cite that factor as a genuine

379
00:21:15.739 --> 00:21:18.959
mitigating or excusing factor. He's like, well, there was

380
00:21:18.969 --> 00:21:20.319
a bird in the path of the bullet. You

381
00:21:20.329 --> 00:21:22.530
shouldn't be so mad at me, right? That seems

382
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:27.030
incorrect. Um So regardless of the presence or absence

383
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.150
of the bird, right, the assassin has the same

384
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.949
morally objection of all motives. And if you think

385
00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:35.479
that therefore they're equally blame worthy, kind of as

386
00:21:35.489 --> 00:21:39.449
I do, then that's to reject what foster call

387
00:21:39.459 --> 00:21:44.250
resultant moral luck. And so resultant moral luck exists,

388
00:21:44.459 --> 00:21:47.000
if the mere results of our actions can affect

389
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.130
blame worthiness. And then this kind of line of

390
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.890
thought suggests that they can't. Ok. So that's kind

391
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.369
of moral responsibility. And now how does this relate

392
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.569
back to punishment? So, um, so one view of

393
00:21:58.579 --> 00:22:02.579
punishment is called retributive is, and on that view,

394
00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:05.979
punishment is about giving people what they deserve and

395
00:22:05.989 --> 00:22:09.380
what they deserve is proportional to their blame worthiness.

396
00:22:09.729 --> 00:22:14.459
So, retributive is links deserve punishment to blame worthiness.

397
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.750
And then if we reject resultant moral luck, as

398
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.050
I think we should and accept retributive is about

399
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.609
punishment, which I'm actually kind of not sure about.

400
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.689
Um, THEN yes, equal attempts should be punished equally

401
00:22:26.699 --> 00:22:30.410
regardless of success. Um And notice here that the

402
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.119
kind of primary motivation for this position is this

403
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.119
rejection of results and moral luck. Um If there

404
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.910
were resultant moral luck, right? If that, if that

405
00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.510
was a genuine feature of the Norman landscape, if

406
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.800
it did exist, then it's easy to see why

407
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:47.099
we should punish success more than failure, right? Because

408
00:22:47.109 --> 00:22:50.260
the successful just are more blame worthy than the

409
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.099
unsuccessful, purely in virtue of their success. So it

410
00:22:53.109 --> 00:22:57.339
seems like this debate about criminal attempts, um largely

411
00:22:57.349 --> 00:23:00.839
comes down to a debate about resultant moral luck.

412
00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:08.599
Mhm. But if we reach the conclusion philosophically that

413
00:23:08.619 --> 00:23:13.310
uh the attempted uh uh the people who attempted

414
00:23:13.319 --> 00:23:17.560
murder but were unsuccessful are as blame worthy as

415
00:23:17.569 --> 00:23:22.574
the successful murderers. Do you think that should necessarily

416
00:23:22.584 --> 00:23:26.685
have legal ramifications I mean, ho how basically do

417
00:23:26.694 --> 00:23:29.685
you look at the relationship between the work done

418
00:23:29.694 --> 00:23:34.685
by moral philosophers and ethicists and the legal and

419
00:23:34.694 --> 00:23:36.324
penal system?

420
00:23:37.469 --> 00:23:40.290
Yeah. So I think moral philosophy has the luxury

421
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:45.250
of being able to be ideal. Whereas uh thinking

422
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:50.199
about punishment and actually like legal punishment is has

423
00:23:50.209 --> 00:23:54.260
to engage with kind of realities of the world,

424
00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.880
right? Such as like, can you implement that system?

425
00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:01.410
Um HOW cost effective is it? So, so that's

426
00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.229
why I say like it kind of depends on

427
00:24:03.239 --> 00:24:06.020
whether you accept this view of punishment called retributive

428
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:09.660
is which just kind of directly links deserved punishment

429
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:15.170
with blameworthiness. Um BUT we might not accept um

430
00:24:15.199 --> 00:24:18.150
retributive and then, you know, some other factors that

431
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.530
might play into it is it could turn out

432
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.560
to be empirically true that uh as a matter

433
00:24:24.569 --> 00:24:28.469
of fact, success is pretty good evidence for more

434
00:24:28.479 --> 00:24:31.890
blameworthy psychological states. And so there's a strong enough

435
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:36.760
correlation in the real world that would justify punishing

436
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:43.160
success in general more than mere attempted murder. So

437
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.339
it depend on these other kind of factors, I

438
00:24:45.349 --> 00:24:45.640
think.

439
00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.229
Yeah, also because I was just thinking that uh

440
00:24:49.239 --> 00:24:53.520
we're focusing mostly on retributive is here. But uh

441
00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:57.180
and a possible alternative would be what people have

442
00:24:57.189 --> 00:25:01.750
been calling restorative justice, right? And I, I'm not

443
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.939
sure I haven't looked into that sort of literature,

444
00:25:04.949 --> 00:25:07.489
I'm not sure to what extent it works and

445
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.199
in what specific cases it works or not, but

446
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.579
perhaps at least in, uh, in the case of

447
00:25:14.589 --> 00:25:19.900
an attempted unsuccessful murder, there would at least be

448
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.910
some more space, hypothetical space there for restorative justice

449
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.829
because at least the potential victim is still, or

450
00:25:28.839 --> 00:25:30.459
would be still alive.

451
00:25:31.349 --> 00:25:32.910
Yeah. Yeah, I think that, yeah, I think that's

452
00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.290
right. So, and again, that's kind of to, to

453
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:41.189
say that there's stuff, there's factors beyond, um, the

454
00:25:41.199 --> 00:25:44.380
blame, that facts, other than the blame worthiness, facts

455
00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.319
might determine what kind of punishment is appropriate, right?

456
00:25:47.329 --> 00:25:49.939
So, if the victim is still alive, then there

457
00:25:49.949 --> 00:25:52.790
might be some possibility for a restorative process there.

458
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.790
Mhm And so I would like for you to

459
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.949
tell us now a bit about this idea of

460
00:25:58.959 --> 00:26:03.329
the penal lottery. So what is this about?

461
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.800
Yeah. So for a bit of background here, um

462
00:26:08.219 --> 00:26:10.319
so the idea of a penal lottery comes from

463
00:26:10.329 --> 00:26:13.459
David Lewis, um who is one of the kind

464
00:26:13.469 --> 00:26:20.079
of most influential 20th century analytic philosophers um widely

465
00:26:20.089 --> 00:26:23.420
known for his work in Metaphysics um developing uh

466
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.619
semantics for possible worlds, this kind of idea of

467
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:29.500
thinking about modality in, in terms of possible worlds.

468
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:33.160
And he's also done some very interesting work in

469
00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:36.359
philosophy of law and ethics. So he wrote this

470
00:26:36.369 --> 00:26:39.930
paper in 1989 or is published in 1989 called

471
00:26:39.939 --> 00:26:42.430
The Punishment that leaves something to chance where he

472
00:26:42.439 --> 00:26:46.290
takes up the problem of criminal attempts. And he

473
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.689
defends the idea that it makes sense to punish

474
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:53.020
success more than failure, even if the successful are

475
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:56.439
not necessarily more blameworthy than unsuccessful. Like even if

476
00:26:56.449 --> 00:26:59.040
you reject result of moral luck, as I've kind

477
00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:03.430
of indicated my sympathies towards. So just as a

478
00:27:03.439 --> 00:27:06.030
little bit of personal background. So I came across

479
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.650
this paper maybe 10 years or so ago when

480
00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.020
I was teaching a course and I just thought

481
00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.119
this is the most clever thing I've ever seen.

482
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:17.020
And at that point, I was already kind of

483
00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.689
convinced that because equal attempts are equally blameworthy, they

484
00:27:20.699 --> 00:27:24.540
should be punished equally. Let me just so I

485
00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:27.709
have motion activated lights that drive me crazy every

486
00:27:27.719 --> 00:27:32.959
day. No problem. Um So, so Lewis's argument gave

487
00:27:32.969 --> 00:27:34.959
me real pause about my own view. I was

488
00:27:34.969 --> 00:27:36.819
like, oh gosh, I have, I've been wrong about

489
00:27:36.829 --> 00:27:38.619
this. And so I got kind of obsessed with

490
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:41.579
it trying to see if the argument was sound

491
00:27:41.589 --> 00:27:43.479
or if there is a problem somewhere. And then

492
00:27:43.489 --> 00:27:46.589
I also recommend for interested viewers. I highly recommend

493
00:27:46.599 --> 00:27:49.040
that paper as just a kind of fun, lively

494
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.530
and engaging piece of philosophy. Ok. So what is

495
00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:56.849
the penal lottery? So imagine that two criminals make

496
00:27:56.859 --> 00:28:01.489
equal murderous attempts. Um And suppose that they subject

497
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.589
their victim to a 50% chance of death and

498
00:28:04.599 --> 00:28:08.609
to kind of make this precise imagine that they

499
00:28:08.619 --> 00:28:10.520
both kind of engage in this grim game of

500
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.910
Russian roulette where they load three bullets into their

501
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.439
six shooter revolver. They spin the cylinder and pull

502
00:28:17.449 --> 00:28:20.089
the trigger while aiming it at an innocent victim.

503
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.699
So it's clear that there's a 50% risk of

504
00:28:23.709 --> 00:28:27.319
death. And in one case, suppose that the victim

505
00:28:27.329 --> 00:28:31.000
dies. In the other case, the hammer of the

506
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.930
gun lands on an empty chamber and the victim

507
00:28:32.939 --> 00:28:36.339
is spared harm. And then suppose that they're both

508
00:28:36.349 --> 00:28:40.949
tried and convicted um of this attempt of subjecting

509
00:28:40.959 --> 00:28:44.380
their victim the intended victim to a 50% chance

510
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.430
of death. Ok. So how are we going to

511
00:28:46.439 --> 00:28:50.119
punish them for, for the attempt crucially for Lewis.

512
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.209
So Lewis imagines the possibility that we punish them

513
00:28:53.449 --> 00:28:56.699
for the attempt itself with a penal lottery in

514
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.630
which they have to face the exact same risk

515
00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:03.339
that they subjected their victim to. So he imagines

516
00:29:03.349 --> 00:29:06.449
this kind of grim game of drawing straws. So

517
00:29:06.459 --> 00:29:09.650
on, on the steps of the gallows, the criminal

518
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.810
must draw straws and if a short straw is

519
00:29:12.819 --> 00:29:15.719
drawn, put to death, if they get a long

520
00:29:15.729 --> 00:29:19.750
straw, they're released. Um And the idea here is

521
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.420
that we tailor the odds that the criminal face

522
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:27.209
in this penal lottery to the odds of harm

523
00:29:27.219 --> 00:29:29.510
that they subjected the victim to. So because they

524
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.599
were both convicted of subjecting their victim to a

525
00:29:32.609 --> 00:29:37.439
50% chance of death. Well, then we from the

526
00:29:37.449 --> 00:29:39.209
bundle of straws, there's going to be five short

527
00:29:39.219 --> 00:29:41.880
straws and five long straws. So it's a 50%

528
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:47.250
chance then that they get executed if however, they

529
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.969
were convicted of subjecting their victim to a 60%

530
00:29:50.979 --> 00:29:53.449
risk of harm. Well, then we just add, you

531
00:29:53.459 --> 00:29:55.260
know, we take one long straw and cut it.

532
00:29:55.349 --> 00:29:59.140
And so then there's six short straws and four

533
00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:02.359
lung. So suppose that the first draws a short

534
00:30:02.369 --> 00:30:05.219
straw, um, and the second draws a long straw.

535
00:30:05.229 --> 00:30:07.589
So the first is put to death, the second

536
00:30:07.599 --> 00:30:11.060
is released. Ok. So now we can ask, so

537
00:30:11.069 --> 00:30:13.650
that's the penal lottery. Now we ask is that

538
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:18.479
just is has that served justice? And Lewis's point

539
00:30:18.489 --> 00:30:19.739
is that, well, it kind of seems like it

540
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:24.650
does uh kind of met out retributive justice. And

541
00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.849
even if you think that the two criminals are

542
00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:30.250
equally blame worthy, even if you reject resultant moral

543
00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.290
luck, right? They both face the same penal lottery

544
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.530
with the same odds. And so there's a kind

545
00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.770
of a clear sense in which the penal lottery

546
00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:42.449
respects the retributive principle of Lex Talionis or an

547
00:30:42.459 --> 00:30:45.469
eye for an eye tooth for a tooth. Ok.

548
00:30:45.479 --> 00:30:48.829
So that's the regular penal lottery. And then Lewis

549
00:30:48.839 --> 00:30:51.290
goes through a series of cases where he makes

550
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.050
some alterations to the lottery but says it doesn't

551
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.540
matter, doesn't make a difference to whether the lottery

552
00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.680
is just or unjust. This is like the really

553
00:30:59.689 --> 00:31:03.290
clever bit, I think. So in the initial case,

554
00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:07.630
the drawing of straws occurs after we held the

555
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.569
trial and after the criminals were convicted of making

556
00:31:11.579 --> 00:31:14.689
that attempt. Um But Lewis notices that we could

557
00:31:14.699 --> 00:31:16.969
just, we could also hold the drawing before the

558
00:31:16.979 --> 00:31:20.329
trial. Right. We just, we do the drawing of

559
00:31:20.339 --> 00:31:22.469
straws before the trial and then we hold the

560
00:31:22.479 --> 00:31:24.979
trial to see whether the criminal is convicted. And

561
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.260
if they are convicted, then they have to face

562
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.520
the lottery according to which, which straw was drawn,

563
00:31:30.729 --> 00:31:33.520
I think. Well, look if, if a short straw

564
00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:35.800
is drawn before the trial, then why would we

565
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:37.750
even bother carrying out the trial? There'd be no

566
00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.380
point because, right, if the, if the alleged criminal

567
00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.479
is not convicted, they're released and if they are

568
00:31:44.489 --> 00:31:46.660
convicted, they're released. So either way it doesn't matter.

569
00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:50.140
And the solution here for Lewis is to make

570
00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:54.250
the lottery what he calls impure. So instead of

571
00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.920
freedom for the winners, you give them a short

572
00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.569
prison sentence, you don't give them death like you

573
00:31:59.579 --> 00:32:01.619
do if they draw the short straw, but you

574
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:05.729
give them a little bit of punishment. Ok. And

575
00:32:05.739 --> 00:32:08.969
again, Lewis thinks at this stage that, that change

576
00:32:08.979 --> 00:32:11.930
from a pure lottery to an impure lottery doesn't

577
00:32:11.939 --> 00:32:15.040
affect kind of fundamentally whether the lottery is just

578
00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.540
or not just. And then the next step in

579
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:22.739
a series of cases is to a device, right?

580
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:26.219
So there's nothing um it, it doesn't have to

581
00:32:26.229 --> 00:32:27.810
be drawing of straws, right? It could be some

582
00:32:27.819 --> 00:32:30.839
other way to conduct the lottery like you could

583
00:32:30.849 --> 00:32:34.239
roll a dice. Um, IF the odds were 5050

584
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.380
you could flip a coin, right? And that wouldn't

585
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.319
seem to make a difference as to whether the

586
00:32:38.329 --> 00:32:42.239
lottery was just or unjust. And then, so Lewis

587
00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.839
suggests that instead of drawing straws, we could employ

588
00:32:45.849 --> 00:32:48.459
what he calls a reenactment of the crime. So

589
00:32:48.469 --> 00:32:51.060
the thought here is like we hold a play

590
00:32:51.229 --> 00:32:54.170
in which we have actors and they reenact kind

591
00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.099
of the events of the crime. And then we

592
00:32:57.109 --> 00:33:01.000
look to see what results happened in the reenactment.

593
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.900
So if the victim in the reenactment dies and

594
00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.699
the criminal has lost his lottery and is therefore

595
00:33:06.709 --> 00:33:09.150
put to death if the victim in the reenactment

596
00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.949
survives, and the criminal has won his lottery and

597
00:33:11.959 --> 00:33:16.270
gets a short prison sentence and notice here that

598
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.469
if you, if you get the reenactment, perfect might

599
00:33:19.479 --> 00:33:20.579
be hard to do. But if you get it

600
00:33:20.589 --> 00:33:24.689
perfect, then the odds of harm in the reenactment

601
00:33:24.699 --> 00:33:27.589
will perfectly match up with the odds of harm

602
00:33:27.599 --> 00:33:32.459
in the actual criminal event itself. Ok? But of

603
00:33:32.469 --> 00:33:35.189
course, this doesn't seem very practical, right? It's going

604
00:33:35.199 --> 00:33:38.280
to be hard to hold a reenactment, let alone

605
00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:41.689
a perfect reenactment. And here's like the punch line

606
00:33:41.699 --> 00:33:44.380
for Lewis. Um, WELL, just look, here's an easy

607
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:49.920
solution. Just replace reenactment with enactment. Just use the

608
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:55.160
actual criminal event as its own lottery. Um So

609
00:33:55.849 --> 00:33:58.400
if the actual victim dies, then the criminal has

610
00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:01.310
lost his lottery and if the actual victim survives

611
00:34:01.319 --> 00:34:05.079
and the criminal has won his lottery and here

612
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.359
we get a perfect match in those odds just

613
00:34:07.369 --> 00:34:10.060
by default because we just have one event that's

614
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.050
playing two roles. Right. It's the criminal event for

615
00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.159
which the criminal is being punished, but it's also

616
00:34:16.168 --> 00:34:20.168
its own lottery event. And then the, this final

617
00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:23.260
case we would set is just the current system.

618
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:26.489
That's what we have. Um, IT'S an impure penal

619
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.168
lottery by enactment. Um, SO we can understand the

620
00:34:30.178 --> 00:34:33.239
current system along these lines. And then he thinks

621
00:34:33.248 --> 00:34:35.658
if we do, it's not obvious that it's unjust,

622
00:34:35.668 --> 00:34:38.398
right. So he thinks you start with that the

623
00:34:38.408 --> 00:34:41.208
first penal lottery case in which they draw straws

624
00:34:41.217 --> 00:34:42.938
on the steps of the gallows. And you say,

625
00:34:43.447 --> 00:34:46.408
well, that doesn't seem obviously wrong. It's at least

626
00:34:46.418 --> 00:34:49.197
tricky to say why that would be unjust. And

627
00:34:49.208 --> 00:34:52.239
he thinks that same judgment transfers down to each

628
00:34:52.248 --> 00:34:54.648
of these cases, the final case just being the

629
00:34:54.658 --> 00:34:58.090
current system. Um So he thinks it makes sense

630
00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.540
or at least it doesn't obviously not make sense

631
00:35:00.629 --> 00:35:03.899
to punish success more than failure, even if the

632
00:35:03.909 --> 00:35:08.100
successful are not necessarily more blameworthy than unsuccessful. So

633
00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:13.520
that's, so that's Lewis's um argument um for uh

634
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.000
the justice of the kind of current system that

635
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.689
appeals to the penal lottery. Um So what's the

636
00:35:18.699 --> 00:35:20.719
problem with it? Is there a problem with it?

637
00:35:20.729 --> 00:35:23.270
So, in Lewis's paper, it kind of gets buried

638
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.469
within some of the technical details related to different

639
00:35:27.479 --> 00:35:31.199
notions of risk or probability. But the basic issue

640
00:35:31.209 --> 00:35:33.360
is that it requires that the severity of the

641
00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:36.550
punishment that is deserved is simply a matter of

642
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.780
the objective risk imposed on the victim. Because only

643
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:44.179
then could we use the criminal event itself as

644
00:35:44.189 --> 00:35:46.979
its own lottery? But I think it's not plausible

645
00:35:46.989 --> 00:35:50.679
that objective risk imposed. Um KIND of is what

646
00:35:50.689 --> 00:35:55.439
determines blame worthiness or criminal dessert. So for one,

647
00:35:55.939 --> 00:36:00.139
epistemic considerations seem to clearly matter, right? So if

648
00:36:00.149 --> 00:36:02.830
you believe that the guns loaded and you pull

649
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.939
the trigger, but someone has secretly replaced all the

650
00:36:05.949 --> 00:36:09.879
bullets with blanks, um This greatly reduces the objective

651
00:36:09.889 --> 00:36:12.320
risk of harm, right? Maybe from like 100% to

652
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:15.389
0%. But it doesn't, at least if you have

653
00:36:15.399 --> 00:36:17.810
that intuition that we should reject resulted more luck.

654
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.879
It seems like it doesn't directly affect the blame

655
00:36:19.889 --> 00:36:23.290
worthiness of the person, right? That person still tried

656
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.919
to um to cause a murder or to cause

657
00:36:26.929 --> 00:36:29.570
a killing. So the problem is that the objective

658
00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:33.409
risk imposed, which for Lewis determines the severity of

659
00:36:33.419 --> 00:36:35.689
the penal lottery that the criminal has to face

660
00:36:35.909 --> 00:36:37.969
is just as much a matter of luck as

661
00:36:37.979 --> 00:36:41.530
his success or failure. So I think that Lewis

662
00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.679
has not delivered on his promise to offer us

663
00:36:43.689 --> 00:36:46.469
an explanation of why it makes sense to punish

664
00:36:46.479 --> 00:36:49.899
success more severely than failure. That doesn't just kind

665
00:36:49.909 --> 00:36:54.000
of directly appeal to the existence of Resultant Morlock,

666
00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:56.800
which is like very a very controversial claim in

667
00:36:56.810 --> 00:37:01.540
the debate, um, because, or at least something close

668
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.580
enough to result in moral luck, like luck and

669
00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:05.139
objective risk imposed.

670
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.090
Mhm. So, I would like to ask you a

671
00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:13.919
little bit about forgiveness now and obviously the only

672
00:37:13.929 --> 00:37:17.149
people we can forgive are the blame worthy. I

673
00:37:17.159 --> 00:37:21.159
mean, it wouldn't make sense to forgive the praiseworthy

674
00:37:21.169 --> 00:37:25.225
because there's nothing to forgive but since, uh, but,

675
00:37:25.235 --> 00:37:28.024
but it seems that there might be some problem

676
00:37:28.034 --> 00:37:31.054
there because the blame worthy are the ones that

677
00:37:31.064 --> 00:37:36.465
are appropriately blamed and not forgiven. So what, how

678
00:37:36.475 --> 00:37:38.225
do we deal with this issue?

679
00:37:39.389 --> 00:37:43.219
Yeah. So that's exactly right. So I like these,

680
00:37:43.229 --> 00:37:45.580
I like kind of philosophical puzzles or paradox kind

681
00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:47.100
of in the way that you're just suggesting I

682
00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:50.129
found the idea of forgiveness to be kind of

683
00:37:50.139 --> 00:37:53.429
puzzling or paradoxical. So there's some people have argued

684
00:37:53.439 --> 00:37:56.879
that there's a full blown paradox of forgiveness and

685
00:37:57.169 --> 00:37:58.879
it's kind of like just what you were saying.

686
00:37:58.889 --> 00:38:00.909
So it seems like forgiveness has to have a

687
00:38:00.919 --> 00:38:04.330
point, right? You haven't done anything bad to me.

688
00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:06.550
And if I were like, Ricardo, I forgive you,

689
00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.129
you would just be like, what are you talking

690
00:38:08.139 --> 00:38:10.840
about? That doesn't make any sense. So it seems

691
00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:14.610
like forgiveness has to be directed at the blame

692
00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.209
worthy, right? For forgiveness to have a point has

693
00:38:17.219 --> 00:38:19.500
to be directed at the blame worthy. But if

694
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:22.010
a person's blame worthy, well, then they're worthy of

695
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:26.629
blame and forgiveness is not blaming or ceasing to

696
00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:30.260
blame. Um SO, if a person is blame worthy,

697
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.290
then it seems like they, that blame is justified,

698
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.399
not forgiveness. Um And so the conclusion here is

699
00:38:36.409 --> 00:38:40.610
just that appropriate forgiveness is impossible, like never occurs.

700
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.729
Um Only the blame worthy can be appropriately forgiven,

701
00:38:43.919 --> 00:38:45.929
but the blame worthy are worthy of blame, not

702
00:38:45.939 --> 00:38:50.590
forgiveness. So, in some of my work, I've so

703
00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.389
how, so how do we deal with this paradox

704
00:38:53.399 --> 00:38:57.110
of or puzzle of forgiveness? Um So in some

705
00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.340
of my work, I've drawn a distinction between what

706
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:03.939
I call synchronic and diachronic responsibility or synchronic and

707
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.939
what one form of which is synchronic and diachronic

708
00:39:07.949 --> 00:39:11.939
blame worthiness. So the idea here is that say

709
00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:15.449
seeing chronic blameworthiness is a person's blame worthiness for

710
00:39:15.459 --> 00:39:18.550
an action at the time of its occurrence, like

711
00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:23.370
at that moment and then diachronic blameworthiness is a

712
00:39:23.379 --> 00:39:26.850
person's blame worthiness for an action at some time

713
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.159
after. So any time that we're considering the question

714
00:39:30.169 --> 00:39:32.149
of a person's blame worthiness for something in the

715
00:39:32.159 --> 00:39:35.030
past, this is going to be a question of

716
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.439
diachronic blame worthiness. So they have these different temporal

717
00:39:38.449 --> 00:39:42.209
dimensions. So, synchronic blame worthiness is blame, blame worthiness

718
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:45.820
at the time of the action. While diachronic blameworthiness

719
00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:49.219
kind of stretches out over time. So it's blameworthiness

720
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:52.129
now for something in the past or blame worthiness

721
00:39:52.139 --> 00:39:54.280
at a later time or an action at an

722
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:58.719
earlier time. So that's the, that's the distinction and

723
00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.969
um many philosophers would think that this is a

724
00:40:02.979 --> 00:40:06.489
distinction that doesn't make a difference because they think

725
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.870
that blameworthiness can never diminish over time. So if

726
00:40:09.879 --> 00:40:13.850
that's true, then diachronic blame worthiness would always be

727
00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.620
exactly equal testing, chronic blame worthiness for an action.

728
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:21.399
Um And so they think that because I think

729
00:40:21.629 --> 00:40:24.090
they think that the past can't be changed, um

730
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.320
which is correct and that your blame worthiness is

731
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:30.699
set in stone, which that part I reject. So

732
00:40:30.709 --> 00:40:33.479
I think that blame worthiness can diminish and extinguish

733
00:40:33.489 --> 00:40:37.120
over time. So diachronic blame worthiness for a given

734
00:40:37.129 --> 00:40:40.820
act might come apart from synchronic blame worthiness for

735
00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:43.719
that act. So as an analogy to kind of

736
00:40:43.729 --> 00:40:46.129
get a grip on the sort of distinction I

737
00:40:46.139 --> 00:40:49.510
have in mind here. Um So here's one property

738
00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.149
that I have. So I have the property of

739
00:40:51.159 --> 00:40:56.250
being from California. Um I'm not in California, I'm

740
00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:00.030
in Arizona, uh adjacent to California and then Southwester

741
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.830
United States. Um But I still have the property

742
00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.820
of being from California, right? But no matter where

743
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.959
I go in the world or how old I

744
00:41:07.969 --> 00:41:10.699
get, I will still have that property. It's sticky,

745
00:41:10.889 --> 00:41:13.669
I can't lose it and it's robust, it doesn't

746
00:41:13.679 --> 00:41:16.719
diminish. I will always have that property can't lose

747
00:41:16.729 --> 00:41:18.110
it and I'll always have it to the same

748
00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:22.739
degree. So that's one kind of property that people

749
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.840
have. But here's another sort of property, consider the

750
00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.679
product is not sticky and robust in the way

751
00:41:28.689 --> 00:41:31.239
the property of being from California is right. So

752
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:33.729
the property of being a fast swimmer is when

753
00:41:33.739 --> 00:41:37.040
that does diminish over time, right? As people age.

754
00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.600
Um AND it can ultimately ultimately be lost, right?

755
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:42.989
You can lose the ability to swim at all.

756
00:41:43.409 --> 00:41:45.510
So the property of being a fast swimmer is

757
00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.330
a property that can clearly change over time, it

758
00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:52.489
can diminish and even fully extinguish over time. So

759
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.780
then the question is, which category does the property

760
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.449
of being blame worthy fall into? And on my

761
00:41:59.459 --> 00:42:02.770
view, um the property of being blameworthy is more

762
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.909
like the property of being a fast swimmer than

763
00:42:05.919 --> 00:42:08.169
it is the property of being from California. So

764
00:42:08.179 --> 00:42:12.270
in my view, um blame worthiness can change depending

765
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.739
on can change over time, depending on what one

766
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.659
is like just in the same way that being

767
00:42:16.669 --> 00:42:19.879
a fast swimmer can change over time depending on

768
00:42:19.889 --> 00:42:24.709
one's physical abilities. And so if we appeal, if

769
00:42:24.719 --> 00:42:27.699
we kind of have this distinction in our toolbox,

770
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:29.939
then I think we can use it to resolve

771
00:42:29.949 --> 00:42:33.300
the kind of puzzle of forgiveness. So while it's

772
00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:35.840
true that we can only forgive those who were

773
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:39.280
blameworthy, those who were syn chronically blame worthy at

774
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:42.100
some earlier point in time, they might not now

775
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:44.830
be blameworthy at all. Um And if they're not

776
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.889
now blameworthy, then we should no longer blame them.

777
00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.679
And for me that counts as forgiveness. Um So

778
00:42:51.689 --> 00:42:54.639
they should be forgiven. So on this approach, um

779
00:42:54.649 --> 00:42:58.669
appropriate forgiveness is a matter of kind of tracking

780
00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.379
blame worthiness across time and someone who becomes not

781
00:43:02.389 --> 00:43:05.000
blame worthy for a past act is someone who

782
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:07.879
deserves or warrants forgiveness?

783
00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:13.290
And how about the notion of repentance? Do you

784
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.199
think it would apply here? At least to the

785
00:43:16.209 --> 00:43:22.419
extent that particularly particular morally wrong acts would be,

786
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:27.189
uh, I mean, people would consider people able to

787
00:43:27.199 --> 00:43:29.729
repent for them because of course, there are some

788
00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:33.929
acts that perhaps people consider that the person, the

789
00:43:33.939 --> 00:43:37.629
blame worthy person went too far and there's no

790
00:43:37.639 --> 00:43:41.070
possible repentance there, but at least for the acts

791
00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.330
that people can repent for. Do you think it

792
00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.229
would apply here?

793
00:43:46.459 --> 00:43:48.659
Yeah. Yeah. So, so the notion of repentance is

794
00:43:48.669 --> 00:43:50.850
kind of closely bound up with the idea of

795
00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:54.689
forgiveness. And the idea here is that kind of

796
00:43:54.699 --> 00:43:59.719
intuitively. Um It seems like repentance if someone genuinely

797
00:43:59.729 --> 00:44:02.350
repents, um then it seems like that is that

798
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.860
provides some reason, moral reason or reason of the

799
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:08.550
right kind to forgive. So it's like if someone

800
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:12.159
repents, that's a good reason to consider maybe forgiving

801
00:44:12.169 --> 00:44:15.699
them. Um And so why, why would repentance have

802
00:44:15.709 --> 00:44:20.530
that kind of normative power? And so my answer

803
00:44:20.659 --> 00:44:24.300
to that is that when we genuinely repent, um

804
00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:29.610
one changes psychologically in ways that just directly reduce

805
00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.709
blame worthiness. So the idea is that repentance just

806
00:44:32.719 --> 00:44:35.850
directly reduces blame worthiness. So why is that? Well,

807
00:44:36.699 --> 00:44:41.530
repentance involves breaking certain psychological connections with one's past

808
00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:44.500
self as one way to put it. Um YOU

809
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:47.449
kind of dissolve the motivations and the values that

810
00:44:47.459 --> 00:44:51.840
led to the initial act in question. Um You

811
00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:54.889
might no longer if the genuinely repentant presumably are

812
00:44:54.899 --> 00:44:57.070
people who are no longer disposed to act in

813
00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:00.870
those bad ways anymore. And so on my view,

814
00:45:01.189 --> 00:45:05.520
um that just directly and straightforwardly makes the person

815
00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:10.429
less diachronic blame worthy for the earlier action, right,

816
00:45:10.439 --> 00:45:13.310
in the same way that losing the ability to

817
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:17.270
move your legs might just directly reduce the extent

818
00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.090
to which you're a fast swimmer. So the repentant

819
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.689
then deserve forgiveness simply because they've become less blameworthy

820
00:45:23.889 --> 00:45:26.540
for the past action. And so I think this

821
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:29.350
makes sense. I mean, for me, it seems intuitively

822
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.459
plausible and again, we can like run a thought

823
00:45:31.469 --> 00:45:34.979
experiment here, right? If you compare the repentant to

824
00:45:34.989 --> 00:45:37.429
some, if you compare a case in which someone

825
00:45:37.439 --> 00:45:39.750
is genuinely repentant for some bad act, and you

826
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.939
compare that to another case where the person committed

827
00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:45.530
exactly the same sort of initial act, but they

828
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.419
are not repentant. It seems like obvious that the

829
00:45:48.429 --> 00:45:53.000
repentant deserves less blame than the non repentant, at

830
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.379
least I would make that case.

831
00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:00.500
Mhm. And how exactly can we determine how much

832
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:03.179
punishment someone deserves?

833
00:46:04.459 --> 00:46:06.909
Yeah. So as I've kind of alluded to earlier,

834
00:46:06.919 --> 00:46:10.260
I'm less confident about my views on punishment than

835
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:13.290
I am about my views on more responsibility. So

836
00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:17.679
I've kind of settled views on responsibility. Um, So,

837
00:46:18.479 --> 00:46:22.939
so in my view, synchronic responsibility or synchronic blame,

838
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:27.570
blame, worthiness or praiseworthiness is a matter of quality

839
00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.560
of will. This is a phrase, another phrase that

840
00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:34.659
comes from PF Strauss essay, freedom and resentment. So

841
00:46:34.919 --> 00:46:37.889
quality of will for me is a matter of

842
00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:41.020
the internal psychological states of the person at the

843
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:45.969
time of the action and um particular psychological states

844
00:46:45.979 --> 00:46:48.330
at that time, like ones that were relevant to

845
00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.719
why they were blameworthy in the first place. So

846
00:46:50.729 --> 00:46:54.520
values and concern concerns as expressed in the action.

847
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:58.600
And so appeal to kind of these internal states

848
00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:02.780
as being the determinant of synchronic blameworthiness is supposed

849
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:06.489
to provide an explanation for why resultant moral luck

850
00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.459
doesn't exist. So it's kind of like I want

851
00:47:09.469 --> 00:47:12.939
my theory of responsibility to not allow for a

852
00:47:12.949 --> 00:47:16.270
resultant moral luck. And here's, here's a theory that

853
00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.530
does that and provides I think a satisfying explanation

854
00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.399
as to why that is so right. So the

855
00:47:22.409 --> 00:47:26.320
results of our actions don't affect our motives, right?

856
00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:28.909
The motives that we, because the motives occur first,

857
00:47:28.919 --> 00:47:32.139
right? There's no backwards causation here. So because the

858
00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:34.469
results of our actions don't affect the quality of

859
00:47:34.479 --> 00:47:37.050
will with which a person acts and that's why

860
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:41.129
they can't affect responsibility. So, so the idea here

861
00:47:41.139 --> 00:47:44.409
is that responsibility at the time of the action

862
00:47:44.429 --> 00:47:47.340
is fully determined by your quality of will, which

863
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.750
is kind of the motivations that you, that you

864
00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:54.620
have and then diachronic responsibility in turn is a

865
00:47:54.629 --> 00:47:58.169
matter of the persistence of those psychological states across

866
00:47:58.179 --> 00:48:01.379
time or the persistence of that quality of will.

867
00:48:01.709 --> 00:48:05.060
So here, if we're inquiring into the question of

868
00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:07.969
diachronic responsibility, we're going to be asking questions like

869
00:48:07.979 --> 00:48:11.290
this. Do the values and concerns that were expressed

870
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.100
in the action, do those persist across time? Have

871
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:18.040
they diminished? Have they been extinguished or eliminated altogether?

872
00:48:18.879 --> 00:48:22.070
So, in my view, if they persist, which they

873
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:27.010
frequently do, then blameworthiness persists undiminished. Um If those

874
00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.199
psychological states diminish, then we're going to get a

875
00:48:29.209 --> 00:48:33.179
corresponding diminishment and blameworthiness. And even in some cases,

876
00:48:33.189 --> 00:48:36.040
they might be entirely eliminated in which a person

877
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:38.820
might be no longer blameworthy at all for some

878
00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:41.379
earlier action that they used to be blameworthy for.

879
00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.899
Ok. So that's, that's kind of my view on

880
00:48:44.909 --> 00:48:49.250
responsibility. And then if we accept this retributive view

881
00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:53.629
about punishment, where you link punishment, deserved punishment to

882
00:48:53.639 --> 00:48:57.060
blame worthiness, then we can get an account of

883
00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:00.350
punishment where deserved punishment for an action is kind

884
00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.840
of tailored to one's current degree of blame worthiness

885
00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:07.149
for the action. And I think that maybe that

886
00:49:07.159 --> 00:49:11.149
will result in the most plausible version of retributive

887
00:49:11.159 --> 00:49:13.600
is, um but kind of, as I said before,

888
00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:15.870
I'm not sure whether I want, whether I want

889
00:49:15.879 --> 00:49:18.020
to accept retributive is so it seems like other

890
00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:21.159
sorts of factors other than blame worthiness might matter

891
00:49:21.169 --> 00:49:25.580
for punishment like deterrence. Um THINGS like that.

892
00:49:27.129 --> 00:49:30.429
Uh And so, uh one more question related to

893
00:49:30.439 --> 00:49:33.270
punishment and then we'll move on to other things.

894
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:38.550
So, is there any amount of punishment that can

895
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.149
render the blame worthy, not blame worthy anymore?

896
00:49:44.479 --> 00:49:46.649
Yeah. So that's, I think a really interesting question

897
00:49:46.659 --> 00:49:50.419
that brings up some metaphysical issues that I think

898
00:49:50.429 --> 00:49:53.040
we have to kind of have a good grasp

899
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:56.620
of if we're trying to think about responsibility and

900
00:49:56.629 --> 00:50:00.129
punishment over time. So my answer is that yes,

901
00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.649
some kinds of punishment can eliminate blame worthiness though.

902
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:07.270
It might be for sort of surprising reasons. So

903
00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.959
suppose that there's a blameworthy person who's been convicted

904
00:50:10.969 --> 00:50:14.929
of convicted of a crime and they've been sentenced

905
00:50:14.939 --> 00:50:18.050
to death and they've been put to death. Ok?

906
00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.939
And let's also assume that death is non-existent. It's

907
00:50:21.949 --> 00:50:25.030
annihilation. Let's suppose for the moment anyways that there's

908
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.510
no afterlife. So death is just you're gone. Ok?

909
00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.989
So if the person has been put to death,

910
00:50:32.889 --> 00:50:35.050
then I think this is true. I think that

911
00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.570
this is an undeniable metaphysical fact. Um, AFTER the

912
00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:40.889
person's been put to death, there's just no one

913
00:50:40.899 --> 00:50:45.209
around that is at that later time, blameworthy for

914
00:50:45.219 --> 00:50:48.379
the earlier action, right? So after the person's been

915
00:50:48.389 --> 00:50:50.280
put to death for the crime, if we were

916
00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:52.790
to survey all the people on earth, all the

917
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.500
people in the world, no one would be the

918
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:58.510
person who is blameworthy for that crime, right? That

919
00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:03.020
person just not around any longer. So, in this

920
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.250
way, I think that that just kind of necessarily

921
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:08.129
extinguish his blame worthiness as well as you know,

922
00:51:08.139 --> 00:51:11.439
all our other intrinsic properties. Um And I think

923
00:51:11.449 --> 00:51:13.310
that this kind of explain, like it seems like

924
00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.719
there's a unique sort of tragedy to crimes like

925
00:51:15.729 --> 00:51:20.149
murder suicides or crimes in which uh the perpetrator

926
00:51:20.159 --> 00:51:22.669
of the crime dies in the crime or shortly

927
00:51:22.679 --> 00:51:26.290
after. Right. So there's something uniquely tragic about that.

928
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.820
And I think this is why right, The person

929
00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:30.689
is just not around to be held responsible and

930
00:51:30.699 --> 00:51:35.540
that is disappointing to us. So if blame worthiness

931
00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:38.889
is extinguished, kind of necessarily when the person no

932
00:51:38.899 --> 00:51:41.810
longer persists or when the person no longer exists.

933
00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:45.469
Then to me, this suggests that persisting blame worthiness

934
00:51:45.479 --> 00:51:47.540
is a matter of the persistence of something or

935
00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:51.560
other about the person. So on some views, it's

936
00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:55.139
simply a matter of whether the person itself persist

937
00:51:55.149 --> 00:51:56.780
through time, that is whether the person is still

938
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.909
alive or not. Um This is turns out to

939
00:51:59.919 --> 00:52:01.709
be a matter of what philosophers call the question

940
00:52:01.719 --> 00:52:04.679
of personal identity over time, what makes a person

941
00:52:04.689 --> 00:52:07.899
the same person over time? Um So on that

942
00:52:07.909 --> 00:52:11.760
view, blame worthiness, persists undiminished so long as the

943
00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:15.110
person still persists or still alive. Um So on

944
00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.610
that view, the property of being blame worthy is

945
00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:19.939
like the property or my property of being from

946
00:52:19.949 --> 00:52:22.090
California. It's not one you can lose, you will

947
00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.840
retain it up until you go out of existence.

948
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:28.350
Um Now I don't accept that view because I

949
00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:32.060
think that people can persist but yet change in

950
00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:36.310
ways that are relevant to blame worthiness. So if

951
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:39.489
you kind of dig into the literature on personal

952
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.409
identity, it turns out that on all the leading

953
00:52:41.419 --> 00:52:45.489
accounts of personal identity, personal identity is compatible, not

954
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.449
just with a great deal of change, but with

955
00:52:47.459 --> 00:52:52.330
complete psychological change. Like with, it's compatible with not

956
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:57.020
retaining any of your psychological states whatsoever. So long

957
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:59.510
as it's gradual enough, this turns out to be

958
00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:02.340
true on both like biological and psychological approaches to

959
00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:06.110
personal identity. Um So in my view, persisting blame

960
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.489
worthiness, instead of being a matter of the persistence

961
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.270
of the person as construed by these accounts of

962
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.360
personal identity. Um IT'S a matter of the persistence

963
00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:17.189
of certain aspects of their psychology, right? So if

964
00:53:17.199 --> 00:53:20.679
the morally deficient values and concerns that explain why

965
00:53:20.689 --> 00:53:23.149
the person was initially blame worthy, persist and blame

966
00:53:23.159 --> 00:53:27.129
worthiness persists if they've diminished, then blameworthiness has diminished.

967
00:53:27.139 --> 00:53:30.199
And if they've been eliminated, then so too is

968
00:53:30.209 --> 00:53:33.360
blameworthiness? Ok. And then back to the issue of

969
00:53:33.370 --> 00:53:37.570
punishment in so far as punishment might affect those

970
00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.629
psychological states, like whether the person has those values

971
00:53:40.639 --> 00:53:43.510
or concerns and then punishment can affect blame worthiness.

972
00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.020
So the relation here is going to be kind

973
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:48.030
of indirect. So that's what I think is going

974
00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.500
on in the case of death or in the

975
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:53.610
case of punishment by the death penalty, right? And

976
00:53:53.639 --> 00:53:56.969
the execution just eliminates all of those psychological states.

977
00:53:56.979 --> 00:53:59.149
And so there just is no one around anymore

978
00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:01.739
that's blameworthy for that act. Um But it might

979
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:04.719
happen in more, less kind of extreme ways as

980
00:54:04.729 --> 00:54:07.620
well. So blame worthiness could also be affected by

981
00:54:07.629 --> 00:54:11.189
punishments that result in relevant psychological change as when

982
00:54:11.199 --> 00:54:14.729
a criminal has been reformed or rehabilitated, such that

983
00:54:14.739 --> 00:54:17.639
they no longer retain those problematic aspects of their

984
00:54:17.649 --> 00:54:20.959
psychology that led to the bad action in the

985
00:54:20.969 --> 00:54:21.709
first place.

986
00:54:22.649 --> 00:54:26.209
Mhm. But I mean, since you mentioned the issues

987
00:54:26.219 --> 00:54:29.149
surrounding personal identity there, which I am more or

988
00:54:29.159 --> 00:54:31.979
less familiar uh in the term, in the way

989
00:54:31.989 --> 00:54:36.179
that philosophers deal with them. I mean, because sometimes

990
00:54:36.189 --> 00:54:41.729
when people improve their moral character, let's say people

991
00:54:41.919 --> 00:54:46.040
uh make statements like, oh, she, she's no longer

992
00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:50.360
the same person, she, she's a better person. Now,

993
00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:54.270
I mean, to, to the extent that you tie

994
00:54:54.722 --> 00:55:00.032
issues surrounding punishment with personal identity, would you consider

995
00:55:00.042 --> 00:55:04.472
that if over time the person improves and changes

996
00:55:04.482 --> 00:55:09.193
their psychological traits, the ones that are relevant here

997
00:55:09.202 --> 00:55:14.673
to ethics, morality and punishment that would also constitute

998
00:55:14.916 --> 00:55:18.615
a change in terms of their personal identity? Because

999
00:55:18.625 --> 00:55:23.065
since we have this sort of folk intuitive psychological

1000
00:55:23.075 --> 00:55:26.726
approach to saying that the person is a different

1001
00:55:26.736 --> 00:55:31.365
person now, would that have any bearing in terms

1002
00:55:31.375 --> 00:55:34.885
of the moral philosophy here or not?

1003
00:55:35.375 --> 00:55:39.850
Yeah. Yeah. Excellent. So there's different sense. So we

1004
00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:42.040
mean different things when we talk or we can

1005
00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:44.969
mean different things when we speak of a person's

1006
00:55:44.979 --> 00:55:48.550
self or whether the person is the same person

1007
00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.080
or not, the same person over time, right? So

1008
00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:53.229
if you consider the sentence, he is not the

1009
00:55:53.239 --> 00:55:56.270
same person that he once was, right? The first

1010
00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.300
occurrence of he seems to imply that there is

1011
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:01.870
identity that holds from the earlier time to the

1012
00:56:01.879 --> 00:56:03.979
later time. That's kind of the strict sense of

1013
00:56:03.989 --> 00:56:08.580
numerical identity. The second sense is something like a

1014
00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:12.229
person's, it's a looser sense of identity. Um A

1015
00:56:12.239 --> 00:56:15.270
person's moral self, maybe we might say, or a

1016
00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:19.429
person's practical self or um you know what the

1017
00:56:19.439 --> 00:56:21.689
person is like, what values do they have?

1018
00:56:21.699 --> 00:56:27.129
Yeah, perhaps in a more uh intuitive sort of

1019
00:56:27.139 --> 00:56:29.780
folk psychology kind of way of putting it. I

1020
00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:34.540
would say the essence of the person changed in

1021
00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:37.689
a way sometimes that's the way people think and

1022
00:56:37.699 --> 00:56:39.370
talk about it. Right.

1023
00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:42.959
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So, so I would say I

1024
00:56:42.969 --> 00:56:46.489
do want to kind of tie responsibility to the

1025
00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:49.699
moral sense of self say, but I want to

1026
00:56:49.709 --> 00:56:53.409
divorce it from the numerical identity sense of self.

1027
00:56:53.419 --> 00:56:55.889
So, right, if right, if you think of like,

1028
00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.379
right, someone goes to university and they have this

1029
00:57:00.389 --> 00:57:04.120
kind of, you know, experience in which they kind

1030
00:57:04.129 --> 00:57:06.840
of like maybe reject some of the previous values

1031
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:08.860
that they had, that were a result of their

1032
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:11.310
upbringing and they come to kind of really find

1033
00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.179
themselves and they say I'm no longer the same

1034
00:57:13.189 --> 00:57:16.389
person. So that's kind of this moral sense that

1035
00:57:16.399 --> 00:57:19.540
has to do with kind of the psychological content

1036
00:57:19.989 --> 00:57:23.550
that the person has your values, your concerns and

1037
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:26.209
things like that. But on the other hand, like

1038
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:28.760
the legal system, when they're trying to determine, like

1039
00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:31.889
who did the crime, they don't care about that.

1040
00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:34.189
Right. If you say, well, look, that was, that

1041
00:57:34.199 --> 00:57:35.810
was when I went to college or that was

1042
00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.439
before I went to college before I was a

1043
00:57:37.449 --> 00:57:39.229
different person. But now I'm a different person that's

1044
00:57:39.239 --> 00:57:42.060
not going to work. So like turned off again,

1045
00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:43.750
that's not going to get you off the hook.

1046
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.330
So I think both we have both these notions

1047
00:57:46.719 --> 00:57:49.510
that we appeal to in daily life and then,

1048
00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.330
yeah. So my, yeah, my claim is that uh

1049
00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.070
that strict sense, that kind of legal sense of

1050
00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:58.050
identity is not the one that's relevant to punishment.

1051
00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.409
Um What matters more is what is the person

1052
00:58:01.419 --> 00:58:03.639
like now? Like, are they still, do they still

1053
00:58:03.649 --> 00:58:06.239
have these criticized psychological states or not?

1054
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:11.360
Ok. So I have two more questions here. I

1055
00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:14.199
mean, in fact, it's one question, but it's two

1056
00:58:14.209 --> 00:58:17.790
parts to the same question. So going back to

1057
00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:22.770
moral responsibility itself, uh when it comes to attributions

1058
00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:26.689
of moral responsibility, how do we determine if an

1059
00:58:26.699 --> 00:58:30.270
individual is blame worthy or praiseworthy?

1060
00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:33.360
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. So we, so we talked

1061
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:36.679
about some of this, so So in my view,

1062
00:58:36.989 --> 00:58:40.840
synchronic responsibility to put my view kind of succinctly.

1063
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:44.239
So on my view, synchronic responsibility is a matter

1064
00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:47.560
of the quality of will, the person's quality of

1065
00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:50.689
will at the time of action and then responsibility

1066
00:58:50.699 --> 00:58:53.989
across time or diachronic responsibility is a matter of

1067
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.320
the persistence of those qualities of will.

1068
00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:02.320
Mhm. And do you think that uh this way

1069
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:06.229
of approaching things would also apply to collectives and

1070
00:59:06.239 --> 00:59:07.860
not just individuals?

1071
00:59:08.649 --> 00:59:11.659
Yeah. So, so yes, I think that it does,

1072
00:59:11.669 --> 00:59:14.050
I think that this kind of basic picture can

1073
00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:17.590
apply to collectives as well. So, collectives are groups

1074
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:21.510
of people um organized in more or less structured

1075
00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:30.300
ways. So like nations, governments, um corporations. So, so

1076
00:59:30.310 --> 00:59:32.830
I defend a kind of attitude based account of

1077
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:36.540
responsibility on which responsibility is like largely a function

1078
00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:40.639
of the person's attitudes or psychological states and then

1079
00:59:40.649 --> 00:59:43.479
to kind of engage the question of collectives. Um

1080
00:59:44.139 --> 00:59:45.709
AS a first step, it kind of seems to

1081
00:59:45.719 --> 00:59:48.669
make sense to think that some collectives can have

1082
00:59:48.679 --> 00:59:53.590
various attitudes like beliefs, desires and values, right? So

1083
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:57.639
we frequently attribute attitudes to collectives, like governments and

1084
00:59:57.649 --> 01:00:01.760
corporations, right? We might say that this government has

1085
01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:03.629
this particular goal, right? I mean, think of like

1086
01:00:03.639 --> 01:00:06.290
a government's platform where they're like, this is what

1087
01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.320
we want to do, right? That I think that

1088
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:11.199
you can understand that as being a desire of

1089
01:00:11.209 --> 01:00:14.840
the collective or the beliefs of the collective, um

1090
01:00:16.219 --> 01:00:19.709
you know, Furthermore, like, we frequently might criticize a

1091
01:00:19.719 --> 01:00:22.879
corporation by saying, look, I saw that I saw

1092
01:00:22.889 --> 01:00:26.429
those commercials that this corporation did about carrying, you

1093
01:00:26.439 --> 01:00:30.250
know, they maybe washed uh an oil covered duck

1094
01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.120
with some soap. But really that corporation might not

1095
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.969
care so much about the environment despite this pr

1096
01:00:35.979 --> 01:00:39.209
campaign, right? And then like mission statements which you

1097
01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:41.409
can find on the website of any like giant

1098
01:00:41.419 --> 01:00:45.750
corporation seem like their declarations of what they tell

1099
01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.320
us are their deeply held values or beliefs. Um

1100
01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:51.949
And then they might be kind of authentic or

1101
01:00:51.959 --> 01:00:54.949
inauthentic or we might raise those questions. So it

1102
01:00:54.959 --> 01:00:59.330
seems like at least suitably structured collectives can have

1103
01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.030
attitudes or at least a close enough analog to

1104
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:06.209
attitudes like beliefs, desires, values. Um AND then they

1105
01:01:06.219 --> 01:01:08.080
can act on them, they can act on those

1106
01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:11.699
attitudes, they can act on the basis of their

1107
01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:14.010
beliefs. So as to realize their desires, I mean,

1108
01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:21.080
that's what these collectives do. Um And then some

1109
01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:25.020
of those attitudes might have moral content. So we

1110
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:28.770
might be able to evaluate um kind of whether

1111
01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:33.310
we think those priorities of the collective are defensible

1112
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:37.389
or indefensible. So in that sense, it seems like

1113
01:01:37.399 --> 01:01:40.929
collectives that collectors that have the capacity for goal

1114
01:01:40.939 --> 01:01:44.110
directed behavior, which requires some degree of structure, kind

1115
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.830
of maybe a hierarchical structure. So it seems to

1116
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.260
make sense kind of idea here is that they

1117
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:51.919
can, that corporations or collectors can have a quality

1118
01:01:51.929 --> 01:01:56.620
of will and responsibility just is um an evaluation

1119
01:01:56.629 --> 01:01:59.830
of quality of will. And then just like as

1120
01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.270
with individuals, we can think about whether those qualities

1121
01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:06.159
of will, whether those values desires beliefs persist over

1122
01:02:06.169 --> 01:02:09.580
time or don't persist. Um Right. Does a corporation

1123
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:12.370
still have say those problematic values or has it

1124
01:02:12.379 --> 01:02:14.850
turned over a new leaf? Um So I think

1125
01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:17.389
that the kind of the basic theoretical framework that

1126
01:02:17.399 --> 01:02:20.969
I've been describing um for thinking about responsibility in

1127
01:02:20.979 --> 01:02:23.149
terms of quality of will. I think that it

1128
01:02:23.159 --> 01:02:25.989
does apply to collectors as well as individuals.

1129
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:30.959
Great. So um just before we go, would you

1130
01:02:30.969 --> 01:02:33.760

1131
