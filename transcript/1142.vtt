00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.789
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:06.829
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes and

3
00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:09.829
today I'm joined by Doctor Gul Sallali. She's assistant

4
00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:14.710
professor in evolutionary Anthropology at University College London. Her

5
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.670
research focuses on human behavior and health using evolutionary

6
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.510
approaches. And today we're going to cover topics like

7
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.510
transitions from small scale groups to larger scale ones,

8
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.319
cumulative culture. The mulla Baka hunter gatherers and some

9
00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:36.970
other related topics. So, Doctor Salali, welcome to the

10
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.650
show. It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.880
Thanks, Ricardo and uh thank you so much for

12
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.959
inviting me. I'm very excited to be part of

13
00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:47.630
your great podcast.

14
00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:52.009
Great. So, I know that uh just to start

15
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.209
off with, I know that you are interested in

16
00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:58.330
sociocultural evolution, and I would like to start with

17
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.729
this question then. Do we have a good understanding

18
00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:08.010
and explanation for transitions from small scale human groups

19
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.709
to large scale hierarchically more complex ones? I mean,

20
00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:14.839
do we know how they occur?

21
00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:20.349
Well, that's one of the big questions in anthropology

22
00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:24.069
and archaeology. So how did humans go from living

23
00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.050
in small scale relatively egalitarian groups like hunter gatherer

24
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.309
bands or tribes to larger scale, more complex, and

25
00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:39.129
often hierarchical societies like nation states. But there is

26
00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:43.769
no one single explanation. Uh, THERE are multiple factors,

27
00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:48.290
uh, which we can count as like environmental, demographic,

28
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.959
and cultural factors. And I could say that one

29
00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.160
major turning point was the emergence of agriculture, because

30
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.919
when people start agricultural practices that meant that there

31
00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:05.839
is storage available and that there may be food

32
00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:10.600
surpluses and people started settling, and this meant that

33
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.070
there are higher population densities. And this higher population

34
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.750
densities, which means that there are more people now

35
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.029
living in one place, that created some challenges. So

36
00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:25.479
first, for example, how you are going to manage

37
00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:30.429
resources and also there could be conflicts among people

38
00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:32.889
because now there are many more people around you.

39
00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:37.490
Um, SO these are challenges, but also, uh, population,

40
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.470
larger population densities also. Uh, CREATED new opportunities for,

41
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.080
for example, large scale cooperation. There were new opportunities

42
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.039
for exchanging information among, uh, many more people. And

43
00:02:54.039 --> 00:03:00.449
over time, those pressures and also opportunities push societies

44
00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:08.300
towards more uh complex and hierarchical political structures. Um,

45
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.169
AND also some scholars argued geography may play a

46
00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:17.570
role here, uh, so often in less fragmented landscape.

47
00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:23.770
There are great opportunities for information to circulate uh

48
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.729
through uh extended uh people, many other people, and

49
00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:32.210
that allows for technologies to separate further which can

50
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.899
accelerate cultural evolution. Um, AND this is some scholars

51
00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:42.020
argued why uh we see some large scale civilizations,

52
00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:46.500
the emergence of first, uh, large scale civil civilizations

53
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.919
in places like Eurasia. Um, AND then I mentioned

54
00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:56.320
cultural factors playing a role. Um, SO what I

55
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.759
mean by that is conflict, often conflict and cooperation

56
00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:06.600
dynamics. Uh, SO especially in, um, areas with limited

57
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.070
resources, what happens with Growing population is that groups

58
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.470
start coming into more contact, um, and if there

59
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.149
are limited resources that push groups into conflict and

60
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:24.898
warfare. And what we see in human history is

61
00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:28.949
that groups that are better able to coordinate themselves

62
00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.058
but that are better able to cooperate um that

63
00:04:33.058 --> 00:04:37.609
are more likely to out compete to other groups

64
00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:41.819
and this often results in um also the evolution

65
00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.279
towards larger groups through through warfare. And the kind

66
00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:51.890
of coordination mechanisms could involve things like uh shared

67
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:59.350
rituals, strong institutions, or more centralized leaderships. Um, I

68
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.709
actually modeled some of these processes in a project

69
00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:06.190
that we did 10 years ago, so it's been

70
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.470
a while since I really focused on this line

71
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.190
of research, but this was an exciting project because

72
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.459
I collaborated with a population ecologist and an anthropologist.

73
00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:22.880
And we were actually interested there to use an

74
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.839
analogy from biology. So one of the major transitions

75
00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.970
we see in biology is a transition from single

76
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.480
cell organisms to multicellular organisms, and we thought there

77
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.640
are some parallels between this process and the transition

78
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.679
from small scale to large scale groups because in

79
00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:48.250
both situations. The kind of single cell or small

80
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.929
scale group need to relinquish their autonomy, but then

81
00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:56.130
there are also some uh opportunities. For example, if

82
00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.630
you're in a multicellular organism, then you may be

83
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.609
better protected against some external pressures. And so we

84
00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:10.850
use this analogy and we, we made an agent-based

85
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.130
model. And one of the main um main things

86
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.649
we were looking at is how uh distribution of

87
00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:23.730
resources kind of contributed to these transition dynamics from

88
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.519
small scale to large scale groups and how population

89
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:34.119
um structures population. Dynamics also influence that. So if

90
00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:38.239
for example, in a low productivity patch in a

91
00:06:38.239 --> 00:06:43.160
low productivity place, if you have a certain number

92
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.019
of people, there is going to be less capacity

93
00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:51.209
for that land to maintain the people, so. Then

94
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.709
there may be more, uh, depending on what landscapes

95
00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:01.549
are available in surrounding places that they may push

96
00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:06.529
groups into conflict or cooperation. So what we see

97
00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:11.750
is that when there are some right ecological conditions,

98
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.380
for example, in our models, if there are several

99
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:23.459
adjacent patches or landscapes that have higher productivity, then

100
00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:27.339
we see that transition from more small scale to

101
00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:32.700
larger scale groups. And what we see over generations

102
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.630
is that once this transition happens, we see that

103
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.500
the landscape was dominated by a few really large

104
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.910
groups and a number of smaller ones. So there

105
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:51.070
was this U-shaped distribution of human groups over generations

106
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:57.079
once that transition happens. Um, AND that's, um, similar

107
00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.790
to that's what we see in most human history

108
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.190
as well. The world is dominated by a few

109
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.619
nations and a number of much smaller ones. Uh,

110
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.250
BUT of course the reality is much more complex

111
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.429
and it's not that kind of linear growth often

112
00:08:14.429 --> 00:08:18.480
in history we see these cycles of rise and

113
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.380
collapse of big nations. So in short, um, this

114
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.660
kind of big complex question, there are environmental factors

115
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:35.419
like resource availability, resource distribution, but there are also

116
00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:39.308
factors like demography, how many people live in an

117
00:08:39.308 --> 00:08:43.489
in an area and also cultural factors, how groups

118
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.489
exchange information and able to coordinate themselves.

119
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:55.299
Great. That was a very comprehensive answer. So, you,

120
00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.719
you've also studied and you even mentioned that briefly

121
00:08:59.719 --> 00:09:03.549
in your previous answer. Uh, YOU'VE also studied the

122
00:09:03.549 --> 00:09:06.510
topic of cultural evolution. So when it comes to

123
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.429
that, what is cumulative culture?

124
00:09:11.119 --> 00:09:13.919
That's a good question, and I'm suspecting that some

125
00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:18.770
of your audiences already knows about this topic. Well,

126
00:09:19.219 --> 00:09:22.539
when we speak about cumulative cultural evolution, we're talking

127
00:09:22.539 --> 00:09:27.099
about a process by which knowledge, skills and technologies

128
00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:32.739
build up incrementally over generations. And this build up

129
00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:38.059
often generates uh such cultural products that are very

130
00:09:38.059 --> 00:09:41.390
complex, that are so complex that They are not

131
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:47.000
often possible for one single individual to invent by

132
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.599
themselves. So for example, if you think about a

133
00:09:51.599 --> 00:09:57.349
smartphone, it's a combination of technologies developed over generations

134
00:09:57.349 --> 00:10:03.909
by many people, uh, technologies like touchscreen, camera, information

135
00:10:03.909 --> 00:10:08.030
technology. So this is, I always think that's a

136
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.130
good example of a product of cumulative cultural evolution.

137
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.380
Mhm. And are there aspects of social dynamics that

138
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.289
relate to cultural evolution uh cumulative culture, sorry. I

139
00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:26.289
mean, I read in your work particularly about the

140
00:10:26.289 --> 00:10:30.010
role of knowledge sharing networks, so could you tell

141
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:30.770
us about that?

142
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.830
Yeah, my colleagues and I have been interested in

143
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:39.830
this question. What are the mechanisms that gave rise

144
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:45.549
to cumulative cultural evolution? And um I have been

145
00:10:45.549 --> 00:10:51.070
conducting field work in hunter gatherer groups and many

146
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:55.479
evolutionary anthropologists, we are interested in looking at extant

147
00:10:55.479 --> 00:10:59.599
hunter gatherer groups because We lived by hunting and

148
00:10:59.599 --> 00:11:03.080
gathering for most of the human history. So what

149
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.869
we're interested in is that what can, for example,

150
00:11:06.919 --> 00:11:09.559
the social structure that we see in hunter gatherer

151
00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:14.799
groups could tell us about information sharing, how, how

152
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:19.320
those uh the structures interplay with with how people

153
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:25.419
exchange information and whether um this. Uh, COULD be

154
00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:29.739
one of the mechanisms of cumulative cultural evolution, how

155
00:11:29.739 --> 00:11:34.369
the way people share information affect their ability to

156
00:11:34.789 --> 00:11:39.739
develop more complex technologies and cultural traits. So we,

157
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.780
we have been interested in this kind of questions.

158
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:48.539
Um, AND for that, we, we often couple field

159
00:11:48.539 --> 00:11:53.510
data, so we couple, for example, data of social

160
00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.380
networks in extant hunter gatherer groups. So we have

161
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:02.299
these detailed genealogies, um, so we have information on

162
00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:06.130
how people in one location are related to each

163
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.020
other and then we also have information on Uh,

164
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:15.469
how frequently those people interact with each other. Um,

165
00:12:15.479 --> 00:12:19.469
AND then we couple this with some data on

166
00:12:19.719 --> 00:12:24.919
um knowledge systems. For example, I've been interested in

167
00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:28.869
how hunter gatherers living in the, in the forest

168
00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:33.760
accumulate plant knowledge because they, they have really vast.

169
00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:39.859
Uh, KNOWLEDGE of different plants, um, in one of

170
00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:42.900
my field works. I was looking into that in

171
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.739
a hunter gatherer population in Congo, and from the

172
00:12:46.739 --> 00:12:50.450
initial interviews, there were over 200 different plant species

173
00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:55.119
that people mentioned using. So it's really diverse knowledge.

174
00:12:56.119 --> 00:12:59.640
So, uh, one of our studies we found, we

175
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.400
looked at, uh, the social networks in hunter gatherers

176
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.719
and what we observe is that it's it they

177
00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:11.150
are what physicists would or computer scientists would call

178
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.960
a small world network. So there are tightly knit

179
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.830
clusters, groups of people that are connected with each

180
00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.039
other and they spend a lot of time with

181
00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:27.429
each other. And these really tightly linked groups are

182
00:13:27.429 --> 00:13:33.030
occasionally connected to other, other groups, and what we

183
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.859
observe is that this kind of small world network

184
00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:40.669
structure where there is clustering of several groups and

185
00:13:40.669 --> 00:13:44.390
some links between these groups and these links could

186
00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:49.830
be. Friends in different groups that you visit or

187
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.869
some distant family members in different groups that you

188
00:13:52.869 --> 00:13:57.559
visit. We see that that kind of uh clustered

189
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:04.520
uh network structure actually facilitates um cumulative cultural evolution.

190
00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:10.010
And the reason for that is that um. It

191
00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:14.760
allows first the knowledge to specialize in one group

192
00:14:15.169 --> 00:14:18.849
and then then if you are connected to different

193
00:14:18.849 --> 00:14:23.760
groups, um, then you could, you have the opportunity

194
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.690
to exchange this diverse knowledge. You have the opportunity

195
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:34.900
to recombine this diverse knowledge. And in many studies

196
00:14:35.349 --> 00:14:40.510
in cumulative cultural evolution, we see that this recombination

197
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:46.130
process is quite important for innovation. Um, WELL, there

198
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.859
are some arguments that innovations often are not the

199
00:14:50.859 --> 00:14:55.169
result of an individual, uh, smartness, like not the

200
00:14:55.169 --> 00:14:58.239
result of one person all of a sudden inventing

201
00:14:58.239 --> 00:15:05.210
something, but it's more about people recombining ideas in

202
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:09.770
a different way, so that producing new, new forms

203
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:16.270
of knowledge. Um, AND this also, uh, what we

204
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.950
see in the hunter gather social networks also replicated

205
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.390
in a way in more experimental lab studies with

206
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.469
groups of people and how they invent solutions to

207
00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:33.099
a particular problem. Um, SO one idea, what I

208
00:15:33.669 --> 00:15:37.859
talked about as small world networks is also, uh,

209
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.710
sometimes people refer to as partial connectivity. Um, SO

210
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.500
when people did experiments in the lab, they found

211
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.799
that if you have a 20 groups all trying

212
00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:55.510
to generate a solution together for a particular problem,

213
00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.010
the solutions that they come up with is often,

214
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.039
uh, they are often less efficient than the solutions

215
00:16:04.039 --> 00:16:07.840
if you first divide these people into like groups

216
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.859
of say 5 or 10. And they work on

217
00:16:10.859 --> 00:16:15.820
the solutions within their groups and then connect them

218
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.280
together and then allow them to exchange information. So

219
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.840
the solutions that these partially connected groups come up

220
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.349
with often are better than the fully connected groups,

221
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:33.919
which is kind of a similar process that we

222
00:16:33.919 --> 00:16:38.229
see in hunter gatherers in a more larger scale.

223
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.989
That's very interesting. So you've done work among the

224
00:16:43.989 --> 00:16:48.320
Muenele Bayaka hunter-gatherers. I hope I'm pronouncing the name

225
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.159
correctly. If not, please correct me. Uh, uh, WHAT

226
00:16:52.159 --> 00:16:55.640
characterizes their society and then I'm going to ask

227
00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.080
you about particular aspects of their society that you've

228
00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:00.750
studied.

229
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:06.260
Mhm. Yeah, so in the Bayaka hunter gatherers are

230
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.848
one of the uh hunter gatherer groups who live

231
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.739
in across the Congo Basin. Uh, SO, uh, the

232
00:17:14.739 --> 00:17:21.050
community I've been, um, visiting and studying since 2013.

233
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.060
They live in the northern Republic of Congo in

234
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:29.530
a wider dance rainforests. It's one of the largest

235
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:35.520
swamp forests in the world. Um, AND they, their

236
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.199
main subsistence mode is through hunting and gathering, and

237
00:17:39.199 --> 00:17:44.310
there's division of labor. So, uh, usually manhunts and

238
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.089
men also collect honey, and women, they forage wild

239
00:17:50.199 --> 00:17:55.119
plants, for example, tubers, wild leaves, and also women

240
00:17:55.119 --> 00:18:01.420
do collective fishing. Um, AND one of the key

241
00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:06.729
characteristics of these forest hunter togetherers are their mobiles,

242
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:12.719
so they change the groups uh who that's vary

243
00:18:13.219 --> 00:18:17.689
between 20 to like say 60 people, uh, they

244
00:18:17.859 --> 00:18:21.579
change their campsites depending on the the season and

245
00:18:21.579 --> 00:18:26.270
the availability of food resources. Uh, ALSO, people often

246
00:18:26.489 --> 00:18:31.569
go to stay in different camps where uh their

247
00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:37.079
extended family members or friends live. Um, AND there

248
00:18:37.079 --> 00:18:40.640
is immediate consumption of food, so there is no

249
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.920
food storage as in like industrialized populations or in

250
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.390
agricultural in like where what we see in farmers,

251
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.800
people often eat uh food that they gathered the

252
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.760
same day, or if not, they could smoke meat,

253
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.339
but even then the meat could be should be

254
00:19:02.339 --> 00:19:07.310
consumed in a few days. Um, AND following that,

255
00:19:07.349 --> 00:19:11.270
there is also no wealth accumulation, uh, especially with

256
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:16.310
mobility and that immediate kind of food consumption. You,

257
00:19:16.439 --> 00:19:19.359
you can't really, you know, accumulate many resources. It

258
00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:23.959
doesn't make much sense. Um, AND there is egalitarian

259
00:19:23.959 --> 00:19:28.310
social structure so they people don't have a leader,

260
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.839
um, but the, the community, the conflicts are often

261
00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:40.000
managed together by discussions. Um, THAT'S also part of

262
00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:42.359
why, you know, but that's also part of being

263
00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:45.939
a smaller scale society, as I mentioned. For the

264
00:19:46.439 --> 00:19:51.910
the first introduction part that when group sizes increase,

265
00:19:52.109 --> 00:19:55.489
that kind of conflict management don't work anymore, you

266
00:19:55.489 --> 00:19:58.270
know, you can't just solve problems just by discussing

267
00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.229
because there's so many people and some people are

268
00:20:00.229 --> 00:20:05.020
even anonymous to you. But yeah, in, in extant

269
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.979
hunter gatherers in mobile hunter-gatherers, we see that kind

270
00:20:08.979 --> 00:20:13.800
of more egalitarian social structure. And uh there is

271
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:19.560
cooperative care of children, so it's unlike the more

272
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:25.560
western uh way of raising children and family structure,

273
00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:29.079
which is more like nuclear family. Children are looked

274
00:20:29.079 --> 00:20:32.390
after by not only by the father and mother,

275
00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:35.800
but by other community members. We've done some research

276
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.199
on this as well that I could talk about

277
00:20:38.199 --> 00:20:40.770
if we have time. And then there is food

278
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.079
sharing, so there, there is a norm of, uh,

279
00:20:44.099 --> 00:20:46.160
there's a social norm that if a meat is

280
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.640
brought into the camp that it needs to be

281
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.300
shared with the community members and there are some

282
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.439
rules on which part of the meat should be

283
00:20:55.439 --> 00:20:59.780
shared with whom. So that's in general that the

284
00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:05.420
characteristics of um of a mobile, uh more uh

285
00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.609
less hierarchically structured hunter gatherer society.

286
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.869
So, and one of the phenomenon that you've studied

287
00:21:12.869 --> 00:21:17.040
among them has to do with future discounting. What

288
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.560
is this phenomenon and what functions do immediate return

289
00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.680
systems serve?

290
00:21:24.989 --> 00:21:30.579
Mhm. Yes, so future discounting is this um is

291
00:21:30.579 --> 00:21:35.619
this concept that the preference for more immediate rewards

292
00:21:35.619 --> 00:21:41.060
over larger and delayed rewards. So this, this concept

293
00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:46.540
is used um most commonly in behavioral economics experiments,

294
00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:51.170
so. People, for example, ask you a question of,

295
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.780
oh, do you prefer to receive $10 tomorrow or

296
00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:00.219
$100 in a month. So that's kind of these

297
00:22:00.219 --> 00:22:03.819
kind of experiments they use to measure how much

298
00:22:03.819 --> 00:22:07.660
your discounting feature and they look at different variables

299
00:22:08.099 --> 00:22:12.900
in um what explains people's level of future discounting.

300
00:22:14.579 --> 00:22:17.949
So I was interested in this phenomenon testing this

301
00:22:17.949 --> 00:22:24.510
phenomena in in hunter gatherer groups because, um, by

302
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:28.770
definition their their society is immediate return, so the

303
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:32.630
food is consumed immediately, as I said, um, and

304
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:36.670
there is not much concept of savings or storing

305
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:41.800
something for later. For example, in Bayaka they do

306
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:48.300
trade with farmers, but it's often the case that

307
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.520
when they trade the forest products and um they

308
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.439
don't necessarily get money from the farmer traders, but

309
00:22:57.439 --> 00:23:01.560
they exchange with some farmers' products or alcohol or

310
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.380
cigarettes. There is not, I haven't witnessed many occasions

311
00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:10.599
where A Bayaka would say, oh, let me get

312
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.160
earn this money, and then I will like save

313
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.760
this money up and then in a month, maybe

314
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.359
I will buy this. Um, SO I was interested

315
00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:22.189
in like looking, then I had this idea that

316
00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.880
the, uh, future discounting or levels of future discounting

317
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.560
is probably influenced by the by the kind of

318
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:36.780
subsistence, uh, we have. And I predicted that once

319
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:42.250
people started storing foods, like once the emergence of

320
00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:47.250
agriculture started. People also started, it made more sense

321
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:51.650
for people to think about more future orientedly, you

322
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:55.890
know, start saving, or you had to wait for

323
00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:59.369
the crops to grow or for for your animals

324
00:23:59.369 --> 00:24:03.569
to grow to to grow up. Um, SO I

325
00:24:03.569 --> 00:24:07.800
wanted to test these ideas in a smaller scale.

326
00:24:08.729 --> 00:24:12.170
There is variation in how much Bayaka hunter gatherers

327
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:17.849
are markets integrated. Um, SO almost all Bayaka, they

328
00:24:17.849 --> 00:24:21.689
trade with farmers, even, even the ones living further

329
00:24:21.689 --> 00:24:25.400
away from the farmer villages like in the forest,

330
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:30.770
usually farmers come and live with them so that

331
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.819
they can continue trading. They can continue by getting.

332
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.880
Wild animals and then selling uh the hunter's other

333
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:44.060
products. So there is that kind of trade for

334
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.420
almost every Bayaka, but there is a variation in

335
00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:50.010
how much they engage in this trade. For example,

336
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.660
uh, some communities I I stayed with in northern

337
00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:01.339
Congo, they prefer living in larger settlements in logging

338
00:25:01.339 --> 00:25:07.180
towns, um, and these Baako communities often engage in

339
00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.150
more wage labor. So I did, I conducted interviews

340
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.199
in those locations and also in locations where the

341
00:25:14.199 --> 00:25:17.030
Bayak live further away from these towns and I

342
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:21.469
found that um yes, they, the engagement and wage

343
00:25:21.469 --> 00:25:25.869
labor, so like working in farmers' farms or working

344
00:25:25.869 --> 00:25:29.540
for the the logging company is much higher in

345
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:34.219
uh Bayaka settlements that are closer to towns. Also,

346
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:38.339
I found that so the Bayaka. Pay bride price.

347
00:25:38.829 --> 00:25:43.589
I found that in people who live closer to

348
00:25:43.589 --> 00:25:48.229
those those towns, logging towns, they pay higher sums

349
00:25:48.229 --> 00:25:52.109
of bride price and there is larger variation in

350
00:25:52.109 --> 00:25:55.349
how much people pay as a bride price so

351
00:25:55.349 --> 00:25:58.670
this kind of Shows that there may be some

352
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:03.910
inequalities emerging among people in terms of how much

353
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.939
money they they may have or they might save.

354
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:11.569
So, um, I wanted to use that variation and

355
00:26:11.569 --> 00:26:17.959
I did this experiment where I asked people whether

356
00:26:17.959 --> 00:26:20.770
they would like to have one stock cube today.

357
00:26:20.849 --> 00:26:23.920
So stock cubes are, you know, these like uh

358
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.410
muggy kind of food additives that people really like

359
00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:33.560
to use um uh to, you know, flavor their

360
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:37.550
dishes. Um, SO I asked people whether they would

361
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:42.430
like to have one, stock cube today or they

362
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:45.910
would like to have 5 tomorrow. So you may

363
00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:49.900
ask or if any behavior the economists are listening,

364
00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:54.020
like what is this temporal discount model is just

365
00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:58.229
today versus tomorrow. I tried so many different combinations,

366
00:26:58.329 --> 00:27:01.800
but it's such an alien concept, like, again, saving,

367
00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.540
for example, for 5 days, it didn't work. Everyone

368
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:09.729
would say, give me just now, you know. So

369
00:27:09.729 --> 00:27:15.209
my, you know, my choice was between today, 11

370
00:27:15.209 --> 00:27:19.699
today versus 5 tomorrow. Um, AND what we found

371
00:27:19.699 --> 00:27:24.939
was that people living more in forests or engaging

372
00:27:24.939 --> 00:27:29.729
in trade, but less perhaps less often, um, they

373
00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:34.420
chose mostly they chose, yeah, just now, give me

374
00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:39.180
one now, whereas people living more in those settlements

375
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.969
closer to towns who engage in more wage labor.

376
00:27:43.729 --> 00:27:49.119
They, um, half of the, uh, the participants chose

377
00:27:49.119 --> 00:27:52.689
to wait for tomorrow. Also, I did this in

378
00:27:52.689 --> 00:27:56.390
with a small group of farmers and their replies

379
00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:00.880
were their choices were similar to the, to the

380
00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.530
Bayaka who were living closer to towns.

381
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.400
Uh, WHEN it comes to culture and again among

382
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.599
the Bayaka hunter-gatherers, you have studied also the phenomenon

383
00:28:13.599 --> 00:28:18.750
of global weirding. What is this phenomenon about and

384
00:28:19.239 --> 00:28:23.439
what did you learn about changes specifically in planet

385
00:28:23.439 --> 00:28:24.109
knowledge?

386
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:29.050
Mhm. Again, this is like the discontinuation of my

387
00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:34.810
interests uh of seeing variation among different hunter gatherer

388
00:28:35.609 --> 00:28:39.319
groups. They are the same community just to emphasize,

389
00:28:39.329 --> 00:28:42.969
but some people, some Bako choose to live closer

390
00:28:42.969 --> 00:28:46.489
to, uh, to these towns and choose to engage

391
00:28:46.489 --> 00:28:52.239
in more wage labor, especially younger, younger generation. Um,

392
00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:56.079
SO when it comes to global weirding, so perhaps

393
00:28:56.079 --> 00:28:59.959
I should start by what weird means in this

394
00:28:59.959 --> 00:29:05.109
context. Uh, SO weird is this acronym that was

395
00:29:05.109 --> 00:29:10.160
coined by, uh, Joe Henri and his colleagues, uh,

396
00:29:10.319 --> 00:29:17.020
which stands for Western educated industrialized rich democratic societies.

397
00:29:17.599 --> 00:29:21.930
And they published this paper back in 2010, I

398
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:27.810
think, kind of showing how much research in psychology

399
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:33.010
and behavioral sciences are conducted with weird population and

400
00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.329
how this is problematic because we don't get to

401
00:29:36.329 --> 00:29:40.810
see the full spectrum of human behavior and variation

402
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:45.920
on human behavior. Um, SO that's this acronym has

403
00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.969
been used done in research, often in psychology research,

404
00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.250
and it was um a seminal paper in the

405
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.680
sense that calling for scientists to do more conducting

406
00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:05.910
to more um studies on non-weird societies. And um,

407
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.310
and in response to I think that paper, uh,

408
00:30:09.319 --> 00:30:12.119
there was, um, I think it was Paul Rosen

409
00:30:12.119 --> 00:30:16.439
who coined, or no, maybe it was um I

410
00:30:16.439 --> 00:30:19.079
found that global weirding term, I think in an

411
00:30:19.079 --> 00:30:24.199
eon uh essay online and I quite liked the

412
00:30:24.199 --> 00:30:28.930
term because Um, that's what we are seeing in

413
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.449
most parts of the world, that, uh, the cultural

414
00:30:32.449 --> 00:30:39.410
products from the Western industrial populations are started, they

415
00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:45.619
started to dominate, uh, the, the cultural landscape of

416
00:30:45.619 --> 00:30:49.630
many other societies. So that's, I think what that's

417
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:57.099
what. People referred as global weirding. For example, GPS

418
00:30:57.099 --> 00:31:01.430
technology uh are used more and more commonly instead

419
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:08.040
of uh traditional wayfinding techniques. Um, SO in line

420
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.089
with that kind of how these new cultural products

421
00:31:12.089 --> 00:31:14.760
are replacing the older ones, I wanted to look

422
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:20.270
at, uh, plant knowledge and uses in Bayaka community

423
00:31:20.689 --> 00:31:25.520
and also their preference for traditional medicine. So historically,

424
00:31:25.709 --> 00:31:28.930
because Bayaka don't have much access to Western medicine.

425
00:31:29.349 --> 00:31:35.540
The first, um, um, healing practice is based on

426
00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:41.979
traditional plant medicine. And I wanted to see how

427
00:31:42.459 --> 00:31:46.140
the variation in this kind of market integration uh

428
00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:50.939
is correlated with people's knowledge and use of medicinal

429
00:31:50.939 --> 00:31:56.890
plants and also whether their preferences for traditional medicine

430
00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:02.880
versus Uh, Western medicines are shifting. Um, AGAIN, this

431
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.979
was an ideal setting to do this research is

432
00:32:05.979 --> 00:32:09.339
also because the logging town I mentioned where I

433
00:32:09.339 --> 00:32:12.939
do some of my research, there is um a

434
00:32:12.939 --> 00:32:17.979
hospital there, like a small hospital maintained by the

435
00:32:17.979 --> 00:32:25.339
logging company and uh sometimes uh Bayaka hunter gatherers

436
00:32:25.339 --> 00:32:28.819
also use the hospital. So I wanted to see

437
00:32:28.819 --> 00:32:35.109
whether Uh, people living settled close to those, uh,

438
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:40.810
this town, and the Baka prefer still prefer traditional

439
00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:45.119
medicine practices or they would prefer going to, uh,

440
00:32:45.209 --> 00:32:48.760
the hospital. And what I find is that again,

441
00:32:49.089 --> 00:32:53.290
um, the generation, the settlements close to that town

442
00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:59.410
is is relatively new. So Most living there are

443
00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:06.680
younger generations and that uh participants mentioned preferring uh

444
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.250
Western medicine or traditional medicine more more often compared

445
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:15.369
to other locations where I did field work where

446
00:33:15.369 --> 00:33:19.650
is further away from that logging town. Uh, THEY

447
00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:24.589
said they would majority said they uh use traditional

448
00:33:24.589 --> 00:33:29.079
medicine. And only if it doesn't work, then they

449
00:33:29.079 --> 00:33:33.520
consider trying to get to the hospital nearby. I

450
00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:38.910
also found that in the logging town, people had

451
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:43.319
fewer uses of plants, so they knew fewer plants

452
00:33:43.319 --> 00:33:47.119
and they also need fewer wild plants. So there

453
00:33:47.119 --> 00:33:50.040
is kind of these shifts, but it doesn't mean

454
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.760
that they are not hunting and gathering or they

455
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.640
don't know about the forest. These people still do

456
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.640
hunt and gather and they still have much more

457
00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.510
knowledge of forests than a layperson like me. But

458
00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:06.949
there are some changes based on where people choose

459
00:34:06.949 --> 00:34:07.510
to live.

460
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.340
So another thing that you've studied has to do

461
00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:17.659
with the social organization of mobile hunter-gatherers. So their

462
00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:23.208
social organization is characterized, among other things, by low

463
00:34:23.208 --> 00:34:27.860
within camp relatedness and fluid met groups. In what

464
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:33.110
ways do factors like pair bonding and sex egalitarianism

465
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.418
contribute to that?

466
00:34:36.418 --> 00:34:39.989
Yeah, that's a, that's a good question and um.

467
00:34:41.138 --> 00:34:44.648
Maybe I can talk about a bit, uh, the.

468
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.478
Uh, KIND of the mating system we see in

469
00:34:49.478 --> 00:34:54.120
the Baka and many other immediate immediate return hunter

470
00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:58.560
gatherers is serial monogamy. So there are long term

471
00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:03.120
pair bones as opposed to, say, polygenyva in many

472
00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.879
farmer groups you see one man marrying multiple um

473
00:35:07.879 --> 00:35:11.129
women at the same time, but this doesn't occur

474
00:35:11.129 --> 00:35:17.500
that much in the Baka. Uh, MOSTLY people marry

475
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.860
one person, they stay together with one person, but

476
00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.530
they can divorce after a while and marry another

477
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.860
person, so that's what we mean by serial monogamy.

478
00:35:27.919 --> 00:35:33.909
Um And in Bayaka, both sexes have equal say

479
00:35:33.909 --> 00:35:37.590
in where they live after they marry. So that's

480
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:43.989
what we anthropologists call a multi-local residence pattern. This

481
00:35:43.989 --> 00:35:46.810
is again in contrast to what we see in

482
00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:53.149
many farmers, uh, farmer societies who that are more

483
00:35:53.149 --> 00:35:58.479
often partly local, so often. When you marry, uh,

484
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:03.209
you as a bride tend to move to the

485
00:36:03.209 --> 00:36:06.610
groom's side of family. So you, you start living

486
00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:13.040
with your husband's family. Um, SO what's, uh, my

487
00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.389
colleagues and I thought that this actually could contribute

488
00:36:16.389 --> 00:36:20.399
to the level of relatedness we see in different

489
00:36:20.399 --> 00:36:27.030
groups. Um, SO if you. There is some, there

490
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:30.229
may be some difference in how much people are

491
00:36:30.229 --> 00:36:35.350
related if everyone is living with the groom's side

492
00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:38.830
of family or if people are free to choose

493
00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:41.189
which side of the family to live. So some

494
00:36:41.189 --> 00:36:44.229
people go live with their wife's family and some

495
00:36:44.229 --> 00:36:48.229
people go live with their husband's family. And also

496
00:36:48.229 --> 00:36:51.110
the reason for that is the rule of exogamy

497
00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.699
that we see in many populations. So in the

498
00:36:53.699 --> 00:36:58.629
Bayaka, for example, there is a rule against marrying

499
00:36:58.629 --> 00:37:03.360
your own family. Um, SO that also kind of

500
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:10.229
creates uh that mixing with unrelated people. Um, SO

501
00:37:10.229 --> 00:37:13.310
to test these ideas, uh, my colleagues and I

502
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:16.709
used both our empirical data that we collected in

503
00:37:16.709 --> 00:37:20.830
the field. As I mentioned, we did lots of

504
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:24.540
genealogical interviews, so we knew in one place how

505
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:28.419
people were related to each other. Uh, SO we

506
00:37:28.419 --> 00:37:31.959
did that research both in in Bayaka hunter gatherers

507
00:37:31.959 --> 00:37:35.340
and some of my colleagues did the same with

508
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.860
ACTA hunter gatherers in the Philippines, and there are

509
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:44.780
also some uh previous anthropological work published showing the

510
00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:49.979
relatedness in other hunter gatherer groups. Um, AND we

511
00:37:49.979 --> 00:37:54.419
also collected some data on relatedness among farmer, patri

512
00:37:54.419 --> 00:37:59.310
local farmer groups. Um, AND we coupled this with

513
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:05.149
an agent-based model where we simulate what happens, what

514
00:38:05.149 --> 00:38:10.290
happens when people married someone and started living with

515
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:15.070
the husband's side of family versus what happens when

516
00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:18.419
people married someone and some chose to live with

517
00:38:18.419 --> 00:38:21.469
the wife's part of family and some chose to

518
00:38:21.469 --> 00:38:24.850
live with the husband's side of family. And what

519
00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:29.760
we see is that over, over generations, over simulation

520
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.659
time is that when there is sex equality in

521
00:38:34.659 --> 00:38:41.620
residential decision making, uh, this pattern results in uh

522
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:44.520
groups that are less related to each other. So

523
00:38:44.879 --> 00:38:48.870
in one location, there may be more number of

524
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:52.639
unrelated people overall to to you as a person.

525
00:38:53.379 --> 00:38:58.100
Whereas in in occasions in groups where people only

526
00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.540
lived with say their husband's side of family over

527
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.820
time that led to groups that are more related

528
00:39:06.219 --> 00:39:10.620
to each other. So this also really what we

529
00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.699
see in the simulation results also match very well

530
00:39:14.699 --> 00:39:19.699
with what we gathered through the empirical data that

531
00:39:19.699 --> 00:39:24.300
for example, in all the hunter gatherer populations that

532
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:28.060
we studied, the number of unrelated people in the

533
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:32.919
camp to a focal person was 17%. Whereas this

534
00:39:32.919 --> 00:39:37.429
number for the patri local farmer group was 4%.

535
00:39:37.639 --> 00:39:40.639
So in the hunter gatherer groups, there were many

536
00:39:40.639 --> 00:39:44.870
more unrelated people because of that decision making processes.

537
00:39:46.459 --> 00:39:50.959
So, you are also interested in evolutionary approaches to

538
00:39:50.959 --> 00:39:54.909
mental health. What do we know about the prevalence

539
00:39:54.909 --> 00:39:59.790
of mental disorders among hunter-gatherer populations?

540
00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:03.449
Well, I must say not much. This is a

541
00:40:03.449 --> 00:40:09.050
topic that's been, I think that many more scholars

542
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:14.290
are more interested in now looking into um under

543
00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:20.120
examining mental health problems in hunter gatherers. But methodologically

544
00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:24.699
it's challenging when we talk about kind of measuring

545
00:40:24.699 --> 00:40:29.429
the prevalence of a certain mental health disorder like

546
00:40:29.429 --> 00:40:33.830
say autism or depression rates. Um, THERE are several

547
00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:38.620
reasons why it's methodologically challenging. One is the definition

548
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:43.229
and categorization of these mental health disorders, let alone

549
00:40:43.229 --> 00:40:46.909
in small scale populations in the Western world, it's,

550
00:40:46.989 --> 00:40:53.669
it's still debated, you know, there are often we

551
00:40:53.669 --> 00:40:57.870
see changes to diagnostic manuals because there are some

552
00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:01.469
disagreements among the professionals about how you would categorize

553
00:41:01.469 --> 00:41:05.620
a certain. Disorder mental disorder. So there is this

554
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:12.649
problem of categorization. Um, BUT also, uh, most of

555
00:41:12.649 --> 00:41:16.439
the diagnostic tools are based on, say, scales and

556
00:41:16.439 --> 00:41:19.959
really long questionnaires, and these are really hard to

557
00:41:19.959 --> 00:41:27.290
translate into a different cultural. Community, especially this community,

558
00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:31.500
uh, the dominant culture is oral culture that there

559
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.360
is nothing written and it like, you know, it's

560
00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:39.610
sometimes quite hard to translate a questionnaire into Um,

561
00:41:39.899 --> 00:41:45.489
into a way that would really take into account

562
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:52.389
that culture's, uh, view, worldview. Um, SO we some

563
00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:57.800
anthropologists, um, who are interested in these problems, and

564
00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:03.120
now we're, we established a network, we're having workshops

565
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.320
and discussing these issues and trying to find ways

566
00:42:07.719 --> 00:42:14.530
to uh Answer these questions, look at these mental

567
00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:18.209
health problems in small scale populations in a way

568
00:42:18.209 --> 00:42:21.760
that is culturally appropriate, uh, in a way that

569
00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.060
takes into account that culture's own world views and

570
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:32.360
how these illnesses could be manifested differently in different

571
00:42:32.489 --> 00:42:38.810
different cultures. So that's that's actually an ongoing work.

572
00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:44.800
Uh, YEAH, and, but with all of those limitations,

573
00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:48.449
are we able to tell if there are differences

574
00:42:48.449 --> 00:42:54.489
in rates of mental disorders between hunter-gatherer societies and

575
00:42:54.489 --> 00:42:56.560
industrialized societies?

576
00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:02.830
Um From what we know from very limited studies

577
00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:07.340
looking into mental health problems in extant hunter gatherers,

578
00:43:07.409 --> 00:43:10.750
for example, there is a, there was a recent

579
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:16.629
study on postpartum depression in Haza women, and the

580
00:43:16.629 --> 00:43:22.520
researchers found high rates of postpartum depression. Um, AMONG

581
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.360
Hasa women, but the reasons that they give were

582
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:30.830
quite different to the reasons that we see in

583
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:34.439
the Western world. So in the West, one of

584
00:43:34.439 --> 00:43:37.229
the correlates of PPD is the lack of social

585
00:43:37.229 --> 00:43:44.239
support, whereas in Hatsa, women didn't mention much lack

586
00:43:44.239 --> 00:43:48.290
of social support, but what they mentioned was anxieties

587
00:43:48.919 --> 00:43:52.520
related to infants' health. And we know that in

588
00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:55.610
in these populations there is still very high childhood

589
00:43:55.610 --> 00:44:01.080
mortality. Um, SO the reasons for depression and anxiety

590
00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:05.570
after giving birth is mostly related to that. And

591
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:13.449
in another study, some researchers looked into depression symptoms

592
00:44:13.449 --> 00:44:18.010
in the Tesimane horticulturalists. So these are people who

593
00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:24.100
mix hunting with some gardening. Um, AND they find

594
00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:28.899
that again, um, around 10% of the participants, uh,

595
00:44:28.919 --> 00:44:34.699
could be, uh, could be defined as as depressed

596
00:44:34.699 --> 00:44:39.250
based on the scale that they, they used. So

597
00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.610
it's not like it's not that there is, we

598
00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:46.560
don't see any prevalence of these mental health problems

599
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:51.169
in small scale hunter gatherer groups, but again in

600
00:44:51.169 --> 00:44:55.810
the testimony, what the researchers found is that the

601
00:44:55.810 --> 00:45:01.699
symptoms of depression were correlated with rate of infections,

602
00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:05.050
so people who have higher infection rates tend to

603
00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:09.810
be more depressed. And so what we see in

604
00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:13.129
general is that yes, there are mental health problems

605
00:45:13.129 --> 00:45:17.649
in these societies as well, but the underlying reason

606
00:45:17.649 --> 00:45:22.610
could be quite different to the underlying reasons that

607
00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:26.939
we see in the Western world. And also there

608
00:45:26.939 --> 00:45:31.699
are some studies that look at overall well-being and

609
00:45:31.699 --> 00:45:35.939
that looks at self-reported happiness in these communities and

610
00:45:35.939 --> 00:45:41.280
in general, the results suggest that they have like

611
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.169
the foragers like Khasa, Tsimane or Baka in Cameroon.

612
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:52.090
Uh, THEY have higher self-reported happiness compared to many

613
00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:57.989
people in industrialized societies. So mental health problems occur,

614
00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:02.669
but also the kind of life satisfaction, overall life

615
00:46:02.669 --> 00:46:05.500
satisfaction could be higher as well.

616
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.320
AND what could explain these differences?

617
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:16.320
Well, I think, um, to me, rather than to

618
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:19.600
me, the interesting question is not the rate of

619
00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:24.350
pre prevalence of these mental health disorders in different

620
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.830
human groups, because I think that Uh, there is

621
00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:33.300
a reason why we have emotions, again, like evolutionaries,

622
00:46:33.459 --> 00:46:36.500
I'm guessing that you interviewed Randy I and he,

623
00:46:36.709 --> 00:46:40.729
he's like, he's really good at explaining all these.

624
00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.510
So based on that view, you would expect to

625
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:49.229
see every kind of emotion and also the spectrums

626
00:46:49.229 --> 00:46:52.870
in any in any society. But what I'm more

627
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:59.149
interested in understanding the uh the mechanisms and the

628
00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:05.320
differences in mechanisms given rise to these. Um, Hard

629
00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:10.110
emotions or mental health problems, uh, in different societies.

630
00:47:10.959 --> 00:47:15.439
So, um, in one of book chapters, my colleague

631
00:47:15.439 --> 00:47:20.800
Nick Chowdhury and I talked about evolutionary mismatches that

632
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:25.830
may underlie some of these challenges that we face

633
00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:34.149
in um in more. Uh, INDUSTRIALIZED Western societies. So

634
00:47:34.149 --> 00:47:39.389
we, we compare, for example, social structure, um, child

635
00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:45.540
rearing practices, childhood, um, in more small scales like

636
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:49.550
hunter gatherer groups with more Western groups and how

637
00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:54.739
these differences in social structure might have might contribute

638
00:47:54.739 --> 00:47:59.370
to Some of the challenges, emotional difficulties we're experiencing

639
00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:04.679
in the Western world. One example is, um, again

640
00:48:04.679 --> 00:48:08.729
in, in the Bayaka I mentioned that uh there

641
00:48:08.729 --> 00:48:13.280
is another hierarchical social structure, so the group is

642
00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:18.479
egalitarian and there is tight social networks, so people,

643
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:24.229
the community is very important. Whereas in many industrialized

644
00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:28.550
cultures, there is a big emphasis on social status

645
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:33.139
and the society is much more hierarchical. And this

646
00:48:33.139 --> 00:48:39.020
may put additional pressures on individuals to achieve things

647
00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.860
that they may not be able to, you know,

648
00:48:42.979 --> 00:48:47.409
and I think these pressures can result in um

649
00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:52.090
problems like anxiety and depression. And they say in

650
00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:56.340
Randya in his papers really beautifully. I think discuss

651
00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:02.760
these how these structural. Uh, COMPONENTS in the modern

652
00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.320
world could actually cause problems.

653
00:49:07.169 --> 00:49:09.810
Right. Yeah, I have an interview on the show

654
00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:13.399
with Doctor Randy Nessie. So if people are interested

655
00:49:13.399 --> 00:49:16.080
about his book, Good Reasons for Bad Feelings, if

656
00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.649
people are interested, they can go and watch it

657
00:49:18.649 --> 00:49:23.719
as well. Um, TALKING now about physical health, what

658
00:49:23.719 --> 00:49:28.449
do we know about patterns of physical activity among

659
00:49:28.449 --> 00:49:34.929
children in hunter-gatherer societies and children in industrialized societies?

660
00:49:36.639 --> 00:49:41.300
Yeah, so I really enjoy spending time with Bayaka

661
00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.969
children because they're full of life and they always,

662
00:49:45.179 --> 00:49:48.340
they always want to show you the forest and

663
00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:51.969
the activities they do, they, they, they are very

664
00:49:51.969 --> 00:49:55.459
keen to involve you in their activities. So I

665
00:49:55.459 --> 00:49:58.100
like hanging out in the field with children a

666
00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:01.860
lot. And they are very physically active. From the

667
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:06.459
moment they start walking, they start engaging in physically

668
00:50:06.459 --> 00:50:11.179
demanding activities like even walking in this forest is

669
00:50:11.179 --> 00:50:15.270
really challenging because it's very dense rainforests with a

670
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:17.860
closed canopy, so you have to use machete all

671
00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:21.729
the time to open way, um, and then it's

672
00:50:21.729 --> 00:50:25.699
swamp forests, so you're if you're, uh, for example,

673
00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:30.979
fishing. AND walking in the streams, you're constantly getting

674
00:50:30.979 --> 00:50:35.560
stuck in mud. Um, AND of course children are

675
00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:39.919
much more talented compared to me in walking in

676
00:50:39.919 --> 00:50:45.439
swamps. Um, SO children are exposed to these activities,

677
00:50:45.639 --> 00:50:49.719
even when their babies as they are being carried

678
00:50:49.719 --> 00:50:52.939
on the back of their mothers or other caregivers,

679
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:57.399
often other children. Um, AND also from the moment

680
00:50:57.399 --> 00:51:00.750
they start walking, they, they get to practice these

681
00:51:00.919 --> 00:51:07.560
challenging activities. Um, SO the kind of life, and

682
00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:12.239
also the subsistence that they do hunting and foraging

683
00:51:12.239 --> 00:51:15.719
requires them to be really physically active. And on

684
00:51:15.719 --> 00:51:18.399
top of that play is a very important part

685
00:51:18.399 --> 00:51:24.639
of growing and hun together childhood. Um. So what

686
00:51:24.639 --> 00:51:28.439
I wanted to do is I wanted to look

687
00:51:28.439 --> 00:51:33.199
at the physical activity patterns in Bayaka children and

688
00:51:33.199 --> 00:51:36.830
compare that to what we see in in Western

689
00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:40.919
children. And so we gathered this data in the

690
00:51:40.919 --> 00:51:44.719
field. We use activity trackers. They're like Fitbit like

691
00:51:44.719 --> 00:51:48.959
devices, and we ask children to carry them on

692
00:51:48.959 --> 00:51:53.020
their usually upper arms. Uh, FOR a period of

693
00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:57.489
time, usually a week. Um, AND then, uh, my

694
00:51:57.489 --> 00:52:01.739
former PhD students analyzed the data, and there are

695
00:52:02.229 --> 00:52:04.629
in the UK and in the US we are

696
00:52:04.629 --> 00:52:08.260
lucky that there are publicly available data sets of

697
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:13.030
physical activity in children. So we, we could then

698
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:17.520
gather these data sets and compare the activity patterns

699
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:22.149
among these groups, and what we found is not

700
00:52:22.149 --> 00:52:28.270
surprisingly that Bayaka children were much more active on

701
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:31.830
average than um children in the UK and the

702
00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:36.669
US. Um, FOR example, on average, we found that

703
00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:41.760
Bayaka children per day engaged over 3 hours of

704
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:47.330
moderate to vigorous physical activity. And uh that's 3

705
00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:53.489
times of the WHO recommendation already, and it's much

706
00:52:53.489 --> 00:52:59.070
more than an average British teenager. Um But there

707
00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:03.929
are some other interesting patterns. So for example, uh,

708
00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:08.790
in our sample, we had like children from. 3

709
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:13.189
to 16, and what we saw is that their

710
00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:18.120
physical activity levels increased by age. But when we

711
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.389
look at children in the US, we saw a

712
00:53:21.389 --> 00:53:26.750
different pattern on opposite direction. I think it was

713
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:31.110
after around 5, physical activity in children in the

714
00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:36.139
US started declining. And we interpret this as perhaps

715
00:53:36.139 --> 00:53:39.429
the consequence of formal schooling where, you know, children

716
00:53:39.429 --> 00:53:43.389
starts in they have more structured education and they

717
00:53:43.389 --> 00:53:47.189
start sitting down over periods of time. So that

718
00:53:47.189 --> 00:53:50.669
was one contrast between the two groups. And then

719
00:53:50.669 --> 00:53:57.590
in Bayaka, children, their activity levels varied more by

720
00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:00.389
days. So like in one day say they would

721
00:54:00.389 --> 00:54:02.379
do a lot of activities, but in the next

722
00:54:02.379 --> 00:54:05.699
day they may do much less. Whereas there wasn't

723
00:54:05.699 --> 00:54:10.750
as much variation in activity levels among the children

724
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:15.669
in the US. And then another interesting finding was

725
00:54:15.669 --> 00:54:20.860
that uh we did a small analysis of the

726
00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:24.459
um going to bed times and wake up times.

727
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:28.199
And what we saw is that, you know, in

728
00:54:28.199 --> 00:54:32.830
the Western world, we talk about teenagers sleeping uh

729
00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:38.510
all all morning. The researchers say teenage chronotype, I

730
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:43.969
think. Um, WE saw that in Bayaka, yes, teenagers

731
00:54:43.969 --> 00:54:47.060
went to bed later, but everyone woke up together,

732
00:54:47.209 --> 00:54:50.520
so there wasn't like staying, staying in bed for

733
00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:51.449
for a long time.

734
00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:56.780
Yeah, and what can we learn about childhood physical

735
00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:01.459
activity and well-being that we could apply to industrialized

736
00:55:01.459 --> 00:55:06.939
societies to promote better health outcomes when it comes

737
00:55:06.939 --> 00:55:09.219
to non-communicable diseases?

738
00:55:11.429 --> 00:55:14.889
Um, WELL, I guess that that requires a bit

739
00:55:14.889 --> 00:55:19.290
some uh reforms in the education system as well.

740
00:55:19.389 --> 00:55:23.570
So when we look at Paaka childhood, one of

741
00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:29.290
the most striking features of children is the autonomy

742
00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:33.429
that they have. Um, SO most of the time

743
00:55:33.429 --> 00:55:38.360
when they, when they're playing in playgroups, there isn't

744
00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:42.870
an adult. There is just children of mixed ages.

745
00:55:43.229 --> 00:55:46.030
Um, FOR example, last time when I was in

746
00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:52.110
the field, um, I want in one morning, a

747
00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:55.629
bunch of children, maybe 1012 children, decided that they

748
00:55:55.629 --> 00:55:58.389
wanted to go for fishing. It was fishing season.

749
00:55:58.719 --> 00:56:01.969
So they just took small pots and small machetes

750
00:56:01.969 --> 00:56:05.250
and baskets and just went off the forest by

751
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:09.790
themselves and then fish small fish. Um, SO that

752
00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:14.330
that kind of autonomy is quite striking, and that

753
00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:18.459
we often don't get to give that much of

754
00:56:18.459 --> 00:56:21.840
autonomy to children. I think we don't see them

755
00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:27.459
as um You know, perhaps we don't trust them

756
00:56:27.459 --> 00:56:31.310
as much. But one of the reasons why also,

757
00:56:32.139 --> 00:56:35.340
Baka children could do that is because of this

758
00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:39.699
kind of mixed age structure where older children do

759
00:56:39.699 --> 00:56:43.979
look after the younger ones and um the younger

760
00:56:43.979 --> 00:56:48.419
ones often learn skills and knowledge of the forest

761
00:56:48.419 --> 00:56:53.570
by observing and imitating the older ones. Um, SO

762
00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:56.129
I think there could be more emphasis on like

763
00:56:56.129 --> 00:57:02.919
peer learning, um, and more perhaps cooperation among children.

764
00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:07.270
Of course, playing and outdoor activities. I mean, the

765
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:10.550
whole home of Bayaka children is the forest, so

766
00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:17.439
it's um it's very different, um. Kind of architectural

767
00:57:17.439 --> 00:57:23.639
environments compared to the environments of people living in

768
00:57:23.639 --> 00:57:26.000
the cities, but I think there are some, you

769
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.610
know, there are some new trends, relatively new trends

770
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:33.239
in education as well. They are like forest schools

771
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:37.209
or like more schools, I think now emphasize outdoor

772
00:57:37.209 --> 00:57:42.610
activities in childhoods. I think one of the determinants

773
00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:46.290
of well-being also as an educator, I see in

774
00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:49.330
my own students, they are older students, they are

775
00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:53.590
undergraduate students, but over years. What I see is

776
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:59.300
that growing rise of anxiety and depression problems. And

777
00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:02.949
I think the main reason for that is our

778
00:58:02.949 --> 00:58:07.939
education system being really performance based. Uh, WHEREAS in

779
00:58:07.939 --> 00:58:14.229
Bayaka children, uh, the learning is from children's intrinsic

780
00:58:14.229 --> 00:58:19.189
motivation. They, they learn because that's the way of

781
00:58:19.189 --> 00:58:22.070
life. They need to, you know, be able to

782
00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:26.399
get food in the forest. So that kind of

783
00:58:26.399 --> 00:58:31.879
I did the. And the need to learn comes

784
00:58:31.879 --> 00:58:36.320
intrinsically, whereas I think in our education system, there

785
00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.959
is a lot of emphasis, not on the process

786
00:58:38.959 --> 00:58:42.199
of the learning, but on the outcome, on the

787
00:58:42.199 --> 00:58:48.909
performance, which cause tremendous amount of stress to people.

788
00:58:49.439 --> 00:58:52.679
But it's unfortunately also the reflection of how our

789
00:58:52.679 --> 00:58:55.520
society works, how the adult life works.

790
00:58:56.429 --> 00:59:00.260
Right. So still on the topic of health or

791
00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:02.899
health factors, I would like to ask you now

792
00:59:03.409 --> 00:59:09.530
about alcohol, alcohol consumption among hunter-gatherers. Uh, TELL us

793
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:12.850
specifically about the work you've done on that topic

794
00:59:13.179 --> 00:59:19.250
among the Bae hunter-gatherers again and how alcohol consumption

795
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:21.840
relates to health outcomes.

796
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:28.280
Mhm. Yes, so in many hunter gatherer groups around

797
00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.729
the world, what we see is that these groups

798
00:59:31.159 --> 00:59:36.370
are often more are marginalized. They have restrictions on

799
00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:39.879
their land use and they experience more and more

800
00:59:39.879 --> 00:59:44.239
restrictions on their mobility because of the external pressures.

801
00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:48.820
Um, FOR example, in Congo, there's pressures from logging

802
00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:53.060
companies and even conservation groups. So there's, there are

803
00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:57.800
some incentives to make people settle down in um,

804
00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:04.830
in places, um, and those pressures also, um, bring

805
01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:11.300
about friction and lack of autonomy in what people

806
01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:15.969
want to. HAVE in their future, and they also

807
01:00:15.969 --> 01:00:19.969
threaten their traditional ways of life. So I think

808
01:00:19.969 --> 01:00:24.050
especially the lack of autonomy people have contributes to

809
01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:28.659
that um increasing levels of alcohol consumption that we

810
01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:33.409
observe over the years of like every time we

811
01:00:33.409 --> 01:00:39.219
go back to field, um, I could say that

812
01:00:39.449 --> 01:00:45.139
there is more and more um. Emphasis on. Um,

813
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:51.040
SPENDING all their money, money in a way that's

814
01:00:51.639 --> 01:00:56.209
spending all their foraging efforts in alcohol. So for

815
01:00:56.209 --> 01:01:00.399
example, many buy a car, when they sell meat

816
01:01:00.399 --> 01:01:03.800
to farmers, they in exchange, they get out they

817
01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:09.800
prefer getting alcohol than, for example, other agricultural products

818
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:14.790
like cassava roots. Um, SO we were interested in

819
01:01:15.439 --> 01:01:20.840
actually looking at quantitatively alcohol consumption because we know

820
01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.879
that in many parts of the world that's what's

821
01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:27.800
happening with indigenous populations. There is alcohol consumption, but

822
01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.760
there is not much study on, uh, quantitatively looking

823
01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.280
at it. So we conducted interviews in the field

824
01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:40.129
with communities, we stayed in. About how much they

825
01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:43.639
drink per day, what kind of drinks they drink,

826
01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.580
but we also did these interviews with pregnant and

827
01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:51.929
breastfeeding women. So one thing to to say that

828
01:01:51.929 --> 01:01:56.090
there though like uh drinking alcohol is a big

829
01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:59.330
part of rituals in in the among the Bayaka

830
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:01.810
and it's not surprising, you know, it's the same

831
01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:03.729
for us like when we are we have weddings

832
01:02:03.729 --> 01:02:06.770
and in many cultures, not all, but in many

833
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:09.729
cultures, alcohol is part of these celebrations. So in

834
01:02:09.729 --> 01:02:14.929
the sense, Bayaka also love to drink alcohol um

835
01:02:14.929 --> 01:02:19.709
in big rituals, initiation ceremonies. But there is also

836
01:02:19.709 --> 01:02:23.780
day to day drinking we observe, especially in men.

837
01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:27.370
And so when we looked at our data, what

838
01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:33.070
we found is about 50 55% of men and

839
01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:39.030
35% of women in among our participants exceeded WHO

840
01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:44.110
thresholds for risky drinking. Um, SO it's quite a

841
01:02:44.110 --> 01:02:48.889
high rate of alcohol consumption among the participants. And

842
01:02:48.889 --> 01:02:54.020
also we found that, um, like in accordance with

843
01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:58.709
our field observations as well, about 40% of women

844
01:02:58.929 --> 01:03:01.879
who are pregnant or breastfeeding said they they drink

845
01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:05.050
alcohol. So there is some lack of, I think.

846
01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:11.879
Information or knowledge on how alcohol consumption may influence

847
01:03:12.169 --> 01:03:17.370
child development um in the community, and there are

848
01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:23.290
consequences of it. So when when when people drink

849
01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:27.570
large amounts of alcohol, we see that uh there

850
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:30.409
are more fights occurring in the community and there

851
01:03:30.409 --> 01:03:35.560
is more violence. Um, AND also that kind of

852
01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:41.199
makes it easier for the neighboring traders to exploit

853
01:03:41.199 --> 01:03:46.949
farm and the Bayaka's labor, and most often, uh,

854
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:53.040
farmer traders, they give alcohol to some Bayaka men,

855
01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:57.149
especially in advance, and then those men are done

856
01:03:57.149 --> 01:04:01.189
in debt. They, they have debts to these. Uh

857
01:04:01.189 --> 01:04:04.260
PEOPLE where they need to engage in labor or

858
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:07.500
they need to hunt meat for them, so that

859
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:12.489
kind of dependence relationship emerges as a result of

860
01:04:12.489 --> 01:04:18.459
alcohol consumption. And we also found some positive associations

861
01:04:18.459 --> 01:04:23.570
between alcohol consumption and blood pressure and experiencing diarrhea

862
01:04:23.699 --> 01:04:26.860
um in the past weeks.

863
01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:31.790
So, I have one last topic I would like

864
01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:34.479
to ask you about. Could you tell us about

865
01:04:34.479 --> 01:04:38.550
the work you've done on childcare networks and how

866
01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:41.669
they contribute to learning to parent?

867
01:04:42.159 --> 01:04:46.860
Mhm. So this is a recent work that uh

868
01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:50.530
we did again with my my colleague Nicil Choudhury.

869
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.439
He, uh, when we were in the field, he

870
01:04:53.439 --> 01:05:00.399
did these detailed observations following children, infants age 0

871
01:05:00.399 --> 01:05:04.719
to 4 over an extended period and using this

872
01:05:04.719 --> 01:05:10.040
data, um, we could look at who contributes to

873
01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:15.090
childcare, uh, how people respond to infants stresses, like

874
01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:19.669
for example, when when infants cry. We also coupled

875
01:05:19.919 --> 01:05:23.639
these observations with the social network data we gathered

876
01:05:23.639 --> 01:05:27.949
that I mentioned before. So we had this um

877
01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:33.600
a quite detailed uh or like large, more larger

878
01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.000
scale data set where we could see who interacts

879
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.389
with whom more often, so we could then see

880
01:05:40.639 --> 01:05:46.399
uh who were interacting with infants more common. And

881
01:05:46.399 --> 01:05:50.709
we could use that data to look at who

882
01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:56.270
uh provides care to children more often. And we

883
01:05:56.270 --> 01:06:00.810
were looking, we were most interested in cooperative childcare.

884
01:06:00.949 --> 01:06:04.659
So in anthropology, we talk about all the mothers,

885
01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:08.070
which means uh people other than the mother who

886
01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:10.669
takes care of children. And I think in a

887
01:06:10.669 --> 01:06:15.540
nutshell, the most interesting results that we see both

888
01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.070
in the the Bayaka and also in the ACTA

889
01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:22.340
hunter gatherers in the Philippines is that the majority

890
01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:25.899
of these all mothers are older children, children themselves,

891
01:06:25.979 --> 01:06:32.120
so they contribute a lot to childcare. Um, ONE

892
01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.820
of the reasons is also that there are large

893
01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:39.469
numbers of children, so together collectively their contribution is,

894
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:44.820
is high. And um what I'm interested in and

895
01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:48.459
what I'm at the moment, writing as a blog

896
01:06:48.459 --> 01:06:51.860
post for the Sapiens magazine, which hopefully will be

897
01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:56.699
published soon, is that that contribution of children to

898
01:06:56.699 --> 01:07:06.459
childcare also prepares children to be good parents to

899
01:07:06.459 --> 01:07:11.810
they prepare them. HAVE to respond to The babies,

900
01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:16.050
they prepared, um, they make them learn how to

901
01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:20.040
parent themselves as well. For example, in the field,

902
01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:25.530
I often see teenage girls, uh, putting breastfeeding babies

903
01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:29.320
into them onto their breasts, although they don't have

904
01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:33.959
milk themselves, uh, they get to suit the babies,

905
01:07:33.969 --> 01:07:35.570
but at the same time, this is kind of

906
01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:41.050
a practice for breastfeeding for the teenage girls. Which

907
01:07:41.959 --> 01:07:46.060
um we know it's quite a challenging, uh, process.

908
01:07:46.389 --> 01:07:50.030
We, we would think breastfeeding, I guess for a

909
01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:54.510
naive person would be like quite easy. It's a

910
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:58.260
natural process, but it's actually not many Western women

911
01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:04.350
experience. Many women report experiencing many difficulties breastfeeding or

912
01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:08.590
initiating breastfeeding. So I think um the involvement in

913
01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:13.969
childcare. Uh, IN Bayaka children also helps them learn

914
01:08:13.969 --> 01:08:15.409
parenting skills.

915
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:21.560
Great. So, Doctor Salali, just before we go, would

916
01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.959
you like to tell people where they can find

917
01:08:23.959 --> 01:08:25.649
your work on the internet?

918
01:08:27.259 --> 01:08:30.419
Yes, so they can find my work on my

919
01:08:30.419 --> 01:08:35.779
website. Um, IF they Google my name, Denis Salala,

920
01:08:35.799 --> 01:08:38.669
uh, they will come up with um my UCL

921
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:42.379
profile, but also I have a website and on

922
01:08:42.379 --> 01:08:45.220
Google Scholar, I have most, I think I have

923
01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:50.859
all my papers publicly available. Also, I have a

924
01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:56.580
YouTube channel where I put short videos of our

925
01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:00.250
field work. So I recently uploaded a 10 minute

926
01:09:00.419 --> 01:09:04.299
documentary on Baka childhood called Rising in the Forest,

927
01:09:04.339 --> 01:09:07.229
so they could also check that if they're interested.

928
01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.580
Great. So thank you so much for taking the

929
