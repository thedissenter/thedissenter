00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:03.140
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.340
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.500
today I'm joined by Dr. Eric Sprenkel. He's a

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.329
professor of clinical psychology at Minnesota State University in

5
00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:18.420
Mankato, and today we're talking about his book DIY

6
00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:23.819
The Wonderfully Weird History and Science of Masturbation. So

7
00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:26.440
Dr. Sprenkel, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure

8
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.379
to everyone. Yeah,

9
00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:29.000
my pleasure as well. Thanks for having me.

10
00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:33.159
OK, so, I, I mean this is a very

11
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.970
particular kind of topic, masturbation, but why did you

12
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.659
feel the need to write a book about it,

13
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.080
and what is basically the premise of your book?

14
00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:46.220
Sure, yeah, I, I wasn't expecting to write this

15
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.520
book. It wasn't like a part of my five

16
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.819
year academic plan or anything like that. It just

17
00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:53.810
kind of I fell into my lap through social

18
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.009
media. I was posting some things about masturbation, some

19
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.240
things I thought were pretty noncontroversial to talk about,

20
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.759
and I started receiving a lot of comments from

21
00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:06.610
random people about how I was being unprofessional and

22
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.089
unethical because I wasn't warning my followers and fans

23
00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:13.250
about all the dangers about masturbation, things like depression

24
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.330
and social anxiety and losing testosterone and muscle mass

25
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.010
and all these things that I wasn't too familiar

26
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.120
with of hearing, especially the psychological parts of like

27
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.440
depression and social anxiety, and so I, I did

28
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.000
a quick kind of look around of like, where

29
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.559
is this coming from, uh, what's fueling these beliefs,

30
00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:34.440
and that I just went down a lot of

31
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.360
rabbit holes and I started, you know, jotting some

32
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.519
things down and it turned into a book outline

33
00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:40.480
and I went from there.

34
00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:45.500
Awesome. So, I mean, of course you cover the

35
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.480
history and science of masturbation in your book as

36
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.660
you, as the subtitle mentioned. So, uh, let's go

37
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.660
through some of the history and then the science

38
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.919
later on. So, uh, and let's start perhaps not

39
00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:03.599
so much with the human history of masturbation, but.

40
00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:07.069
What perhaps we could call the biological history or

41
00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.070
the deep history of masturbation. So, uh, is masturbation

42
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.229
common in the animal kingdom?

43
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.639
Yeah, I don't know how to quantify common given

44
00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.759
the number of organisms on this planet. Um, BUT

45
00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.119
it's certainly not a rare occurrence, especially among a

46
00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.970
lot of mammals. Um, AND there, there's like myths

47
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.979
about, oh, only captive animals masturbate as kind of

48
00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:36.229
an anti-masturbation. Message of like, oh, it's not natural,

49
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.210
if you're confined, then you do it, but out

50
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.729
in the wild where you're supposed to be, you

51
00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.250
don't see it. And and that's not true at

52
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.520
all. There's plenty of instances, observed instances of of

53
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.589
wild animals masturbating. And one, just for an example,

54
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.240
um, Just from a few years ago, this was

55
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.550
actually after I, I finished the draft of my

56
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.830
book, so it's not included in it, but there

57
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.229
was a walrus that went ashore along a beach

58
00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:05.089
in this town on the eastern coast of England

59
00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.110
on New Year's Eve, I believe it was 2023,

60
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.800
maybe 2022, 1 of those. And it just started

61
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.970
masturbating along along the beach, and it was such

62
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.410
a spectacle in the town that the town had

63
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.610
planned fireworks celebration that night for for New Year's,

64
00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.929
and they decided to respect the masturbating walrus, and

65
00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:25.929
they canceled the fireworks show and not to disrupt

66
00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:28.750
them. And eventually, and this was a walrus that

67
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.949
was being tracked to, his name was Thor, and

68
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.369
eventually he just went back into the North Sea

69
00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:36.070
on his journey. So yeah, there's plenty of instances

70
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.089
of of animals masturbating. We're not unique in that.

71
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.029
We are unique in the sense of like, we

72
00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.869
are tend to be a little bit more orgasm

73
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:46.389
focused, and it's our ability to fantasize to help

74
00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.949
with that, but in terms of touching genitals for

75
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.110
pleasure, it, it exists in a lot of species.

76
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.250
But do we know why, uh, the species of

77
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.169
animals that masturbate, why they do that? I mean,

78
00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:04.350
does it serve any particular evolved functions?

79
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.000
Depending on the species, so if we look at

80
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.690
one of our closest, the closest relative that we

81
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.610
have, bonobo, the, the pygmy chimpanzee. Um, THEY do,

82
00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:15.720
they, they express themselves sexually in a lot of

83
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.798
ways to reduce tension, to resolve conflicts, just to

84
00:04:19.798 --> 00:04:22.250
kind of chill out, and a lot of like

85
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.609
motivations for humans, uh, as well, uh, to, to

86
00:04:25.609 --> 00:04:28.170
masturbate. But otherwise, it's just an artifact of having

87
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.019
a sex drive and not necessarily an available partner

88
00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:35.369
in your immediate surroundings, and to, to, to engage

89
00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:39.239
in a solo sexuality in order to satisfy at

90
00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:40.769
least some aspect of that drive.

91
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.820
And when it comes to human societies, what do

92
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.040
we know about masturbation and the kind of uh

93
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.359
norms, perhaps social norms about masturbation, the kind of

94
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.964
uh Beliefs people have about masturbation in more traditional

95
00:05:00.964 --> 00:05:06.795
societies and and traditional societies like hunter gatherers, for

96
00:05:06.795 --> 00:05:10.364
example, if we know anything about that and in

97
00:05:10.364 --> 00:05:11.845
early civilization.

98
00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:14.899
Yeah, we don't know anything specifically about masturbation with

99
00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:17.839
like hunter-gatherer societies, we can only can can assume

100
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.700
of what it looked like, but in terms of

101
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.700
recorded history, and even the ancient civilizations, Greeks, Romans,

102
00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:28.309
things like that. Um, THERE is evidence that masturbation

103
00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:31.140
existed within those civilizations, but it wasn't really paid

104
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.989
much mind to. Uh, IT certainly existed void of

105
00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:39.350
any kind of, uh, sinful, uh, prohibition, void of

106
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.019
any kind of scare tactics about health effects that

107
00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:45.470
we see now or over at least the past

108
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.269
couple of 100 years of warning that, oh, if

109
00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:50.589
you masturbate, X, Y, or Z is going to

110
00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:53.809
happen to your body or your mind. It was

111
00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:56.049
non-existent in that way. So it was really just

112
00:05:56.049 --> 00:05:59.040
kind of an inconsequential behavior at the time. Uh,

113
00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:01.290
AT most, it was the butt of jokes, and

114
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.809
so it was kind of viewed as like this

115
00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:07.410
secondary or second tier rather behavior to partnered sex,

116
00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:11.010
which was uh what what should be ideal, and

117
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.690
that if you didn't have a partner, then I

118
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.489
guess you could masturbate. So there are some jokes

119
00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:17.769
about being lonely and masturbating and things like that,

120
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.209
but it certainly wasn't used as a scare tactic

121
00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:25.410
or anti-masturbation messaging. To try to persuade people against

122
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.799
it,

123
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.869
but it was not stigmatized or pathologized,

124
00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:34.029
or was it? No, not in those two, civilizations

125
00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:36.350
that I mentioned. Now, you do have, you know,

126
00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:40.070
an ancient one as well within Judaism, um, and

127
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.170
I, I get more into that with the religious

128
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.709
aspect of things because it was more of a

129
00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:47.350
religious prohibition, uh, on it, and that, that's, that

130
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.760
has existed for a few 1000 years. Um, AND

131
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.059
so that took on a little bit of a

132
00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:55.750
different take on it, and that certainly has influenced,

133
00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:58.920
uh, Christianity's prohibition against it, and so on and

134
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.480
so forth, but within kind of classical Greek Roman

135
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.640
times, there, there wasn't much of a, that much

136
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.320
of a taboo of it other than just kind

137
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.079
of it being viewed again as like the second

138
00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:10.859
tier behavior.

139
00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:16.690
And when was it in history or perhaps particularly

140
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.799
in Western history because I would imagine that's the

141
00:07:19.799 --> 00:07:23.329
one you would focus the most on that uh

142
00:07:23.329 --> 00:07:29.250
masturbation started being problematized in any way, like for

143
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.809
example being considered a sin or a disease.

144
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.940
Yeah, so the idea of like a religious prohibition

145
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.779
goes back to the story of Onan in the

146
00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:43.130
Book of Genesis. Now that wasn't an anti-masturbation like

147
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.779
fable in and of itself. It was more of

148
00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:50.100
a fable about obedience and so obeying God's commands

149
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.339
and family responsibilities and things like that. But it

150
00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:56.649
turned into this message of don't waste your seed,

151
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.660
because the story of Onan dealt with Onan's quote

152
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.980
unquote spilling his seed upon the ground as opposed

153
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.320
to Um, having an ejaculation within his, this is

154
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.160
a long story with Onan, but if you're, you're

155
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.869
unfamiliar, his brother died, and God commanded that he

156
00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:15.399
continue his brother's family line by marrying and having

157
00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:17.779
sex with his dead brother's wife. So this was

158
00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:20.190
Have been his sister-in-law, and he didn't like the

159
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.109
idea of that, didn't mind the sex part, but

160
00:08:22.109 --> 00:08:24.989
didn't like the idea of the reproduction part. And

161
00:08:24.989 --> 00:08:26.750
so while they were having sex at the moment

162
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.589
of orgasm, he withdrew his penis and spilled his

163
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:31.549
seed upon the ground, and then God killed him

164
00:08:31.549 --> 00:08:34.450
for that transgression. And so that again, that often

165
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.609
has been viewed as, oh, this is an anti-masturbation

166
00:08:38.609 --> 00:08:41.799
story, um, but it is actually just like obey

167
00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:45.450
God kind of story. But rabbis later in the

168
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.650
religious text, the Talmud, really took time to interpret,

169
00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:50.510
well, what does this mean to not spill your

170
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.489
seed, what more can we kind of learn from

171
00:08:52.489 --> 00:08:54.690
the story of Onan, and they really took the

172
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.409
not spilling the seed thing very, very literally, of

173
00:08:57.409 --> 00:08:59.770
like, you need to save your seed, it has

174
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.090
one purpose only, and that's for the purpose of

175
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.820
procreation. Anything less is disobeying God's mandate of what

176
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.059
we should be doing with our genitals. And so

177
00:09:08.059 --> 00:09:10.099
they created all these different types of rules as

178
00:09:10.099 --> 00:09:13.580
a way to avoid spilling seed, and that that

179
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.179
backed up the, the progression of, well, what leads

180
00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:21.039
to ejaculation? It's like, well, arousal does genital stimulation,

181
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.219
and so they started putting a lot of prohibitions

182
00:09:23.219 --> 00:09:25.500
on these earlier behaviors, you know, as a way

183
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.059
to avoid giving accidental seed spilling, so to speak.

184
00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:33.909
Um, AND then in Christianity, it wasn't really explicitly

185
00:09:33.909 --> 00:09:40.070
mentioned, um, until about the 11th century, mid 11th

186
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.260
century with the Pope at that time, who was,

187
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.150
uh, was the first one to explicitly say that

188
00:09:46.469 --> 00:09:49.869
masturbation is a gravely disordered act in a sin,

189
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.669
essentially, um, and that position has been reaffirmed by

190
00:09:53.669 --> 00:09:56.750
numerous popes over the past 1000 years, up until

191
00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.130
including Pope Benedict, um, about 10 years ago.

192
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.599
How about it being considered some sort of pathology

193
00:10:05.599 --> 00:10:10.429
or disease? Has it ever been considered such in

194
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.159
medicine or by the medical system, or even by,

195
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.880
for example, psychiatrists or clinical psychologists? Yeah,

196
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.280
we started seeing the introduction that masturbation is now

197
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.119
physically harmful to you, not just spiritually harmful, but

198
00:10:25.119 --> 00:10:30.330
physically. Around the early 1700s in England. And what's

199
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.049
largely pointed to is this anonymous pamphlet called Onania,

200
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.570
which again references that story from the Bible, Onan.

201
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.929
Um, AND in it, there was still a lot

202
00:10:41.929 --> 00:10:47.239
of like preachy, like spiritual warnings about masturbation, you're

203
00:10:47.239 --> 00:10:49.039
going to go to hell, it's a slippery slope

204
00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:51.479
to other sins, you start touching yourself today, you're

205
00:10:51.479 --> 00:10:54.239
going to be thieving and murdering the next time

206
00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:57.010
you know it. Um, BUT this was the first

207
00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:01.469
instance of, oh, masturbation is also going to cause

208
00:11:01.469 --> 00:11:05.650
depression and change your skin and just prematurely age

209
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.500
you, and so all these physical effects now started

210
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.969
taking shape, and that had an influence on physicians.

211
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.900
Around that time, both in Europe and into the

212
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.500
United States, and you saw writings later in the

213
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.780
1700s and then definitely into the 1800s, where otherwise

214
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.460
well respected physicians and even physicians who were pretty

215
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.260
ahead of their time in a lot of other

216
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.429
areas and were pretty progressive. And they're still revered

217
00:11:28.429 --> 00:11:31.280
that way today. They had these very backwards view

218
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.440
on sexuality in general, but in particular masturbation, and

219
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.840
so they have a lot of writings too, through,

220
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.799
especially throughout the 1800s of how masturbation is very,

221
00:11:38.919 --> 00:11:40.140
very detrimental to your health.

222
00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.419
In your book you go through the history of

223
00:11:44.419 --> 00:11:49.219
crusaders or what you call crusaders against masturbation. Who

224
00:11:49.219 --> 00:11:53.500
are these anti-masturbation crusaders? Of course I would imagine

225
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.739
that some of them would include the, the ones

226
00:11:57.739 --> 00:12:01.085
you've already made reference. TO there when talking about

227
00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:05.705
religious people, for example, and I would imagine some

228
00:12:05.705 --> 00:12:09.835
of the claims made by them would track onto

229
00:12:10.025 --> 00:12:15.065
also those sort of religious medical claims, but who

230
00:12:15.065 --> 00:12:16.864
are they? Who are they?

231
00:12:17.304 --> 00:12:20.674
Yeah, broadly speaking, they're an interesting group and sometimes

232
00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:22.984
they're strange bedfellows because they don't really share much

233
00:12:22.984 --> 00:12:26.760
in common ideologically other than this one area. Um,

234
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.140
SO, like you said, definitely the religious moralists who

235
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.820
say like this is a sin, this is bad,

236
00:12:30.859 --> 00:12:33.500
and sometimes they can get into like some pseudo-scientific

237
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.039
health, uh, claims as well with that, but they're

238
00:12:36.039 --> 00:12:38.940
primarily grounded in this belief that masturbation is a

239
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.169
sin, uh, that's spiritually harmful to you. And then

240
00:12:42.169 --> 00:12:45.770
there's a lot of quack doctors, again, going back

241
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.099
a couple of 100 years, but still today, and

242
00:12:48.099 --> 00:12:49.460
I, I, and that was kind of like the

243
00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.500
surprising thing with the book that I thought the

244
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.400
history piece was going to be separate from talking

245
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.549
about the science today. But pretty much the anti-masturbation

246
00:12:57.549 --> 00:13:00.989
claims being made today are really just mirrors of

247
00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:05.270
what was being said 200 years ago, even by

248
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.469
physicians back then, as well as some physicians today.

249
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.539
Fortunately, fewer physicians today, but they, they, they're still

250
00:13:11.539 --> 00:13:14.229
out there. Um, SO there are some like, uh,

251
00:13:14.299 --> 00:13:16.630
you know, quack physicians, and then there are just

252
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.409
like what I consider like the wellness influencers on,

253
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.070
on social media, uh, those who claim that, oh,

254
00:13:22.109 --> 00:13:24.309
if you follow these five steps, you're on your

255
00:13:24.309 --> 00:13:27.460
way to like physical wellness. And unfortunately, a lot

256
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.659
of those, um, a lot of that advice does

257
00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:34.539
get into one's sexuality and, and ideas of purity

258
00:13:34.539 --> 00:13:38.140
and being pure, and this idea that, uh, especially

259
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.299
for men that ejaculating is reducing your testosterone and

260
00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:44.580
making it more difficult to gain muscle mass, and

261
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:49.979
you're essentially physically feminizing yourself through ejaculation. And so

262
00:13:49.979 --> 00:13:52.590
then you, then you have those wellness influencers. And

263
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.929
then kind of indirectly, you have um some branches

264
00:13:56.929 --> 00:13:59.789
of feminism, not all, but some branches primarily like

265
00:13:59.789 --> 00:14:04.450
what's called radical feminism. Um, THAT I say indirectly

266
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.150
because their target is more with pornography and the

267
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:11.390
sex industry, but pornography is for masturbation, and so

268
00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:15.210
the issues overlap with that. Um, AND then a

269
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.229
surprising one too are like white nationalists and white

270
00:14:18.229 --> 00:14:21.390
supremacists and others who engage in some types of

271
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.349
conspiratorial thinking and their belief that porn in particular

272
00:14:25.349 --> 00:14:27.950
and masturbating to porn is a way to kind

273
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:32.260
of degrade and erode white men. Um, AND for

274
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.659
minorities to take over. So some conspiratorial thinking too.

275
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.099
Yeah, later we're going to go back to some

276
00:14:40.099 --> 00:14:42.179
of what you said there. We're going to talk

277
00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:45.659
about the no fat people or no fat movement

278
00:14:45.659 --> 00:14:49.299
and people who make claims about semen retention and

279
00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:54.859
also the overlap between anti-masturbation and anti-pornography. We're going

280
00:14:54.859 --> 00:14:57.559
to talk about that, but tell us. About the

281
00:14:57.559 --> 00:15:01.239
figure because he was a very prominent figure of

282
00:15:01.239 --> 00:15:05.000
John Kellogg. I mean, what did he represent in

283
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.750
terms of anti-masturbation?

284
00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:11.080
Yeah, so John Kellogg was a physician at the

285
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.599
late 1800s, early 1900s. He was part of a

286
00:15:14.599 --> 00:15:17.179
psychiatric hospital. It's called a sanitarium at that time.

287
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.780
In Michigan in the United States, and he was

288
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.119
part of like this kind of wellness and hygiene,

289
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.219
purity kind of movement within the health industry at

290
00:15:26.219 --> 00:15:29.489
that time. So, he was a big proponent of

291
00:15:29.489 --> 00:15:32.530
kind of experimental methods of treating mental illnesses through

292
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.869
like hydrotherapy, different types of like interactions with water.

293
00:15:36.119 --> 00:15:39.200
Sometimes it can be very like sadistic methods, um,

294
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.679
but he also had a lot of beliefs about

295
00:15:40.679 --> 00:15:44.929
how diet influences behavior, and he was very, very

296
00:15:44.929 --> 00:15:48.969
caught up with his religious beliefs and in having

297
00:15:48.969 --> 00:15:51.169
his religious beliefs inform a lot of his medical

298
00:15:51.169 --> 00:15:55.809
opinions, particularly around sex and particularly around masturbation. He

299
00:15:55.809 --> 00:15:58.530
viewed masturbation as like the mulloch of the species,

300
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.729
and that it was doubly abominable, doubly because it

301
00:16:01.729 --> 00:16:04.010
was not only a sin in itself, but it's

302
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.130
also a sin against your own body. And so

303
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.969
he, uh, going with the the food piece, he

304
00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:13.169
thought introducing a bland diet was the best way

305
00:16:13.169 --> 00:16:17.479
to kind of suppress sexual desire, particularly masturbatory desire,

306
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.409
and so he actually invented a very bland toasted

307
00:16:22.409 --> 00:16:27.250
cornflake, um, to, to in hopes to to achieve

308
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.549
this goal. And if you haven't put the name

309
00:16:29.549 --> 00:16:31.969
and the flake together, this is where kind of

310
00:16:31.969 --> 00:16:35.250
the essentially the origin story of Kellogg's cornflakes. It

311
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.260
was actually his brother, Will Kellogg, that took the

312
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.090
company more commercial. Um, John Kellogg wanted just to

313
00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.729
keep the cereal as a treatment, uh, intervention within

314
00:16:45.729 --> 00:16:49.369
his hospital. Um, BUT nonetheless, that, that was the,

315
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.489
the initial invention of toasted cornflakes. Fortunately, they have

316
00:16:53.489 --> 00:16:55.929
no impact on sexual desire, so feel free to

317
00:16:55.929 --> 00:16:56.929
eat those as you please.

318
00:16:58.219 --> 00:17:01.900
And tell us about the practices of circumcising the

319
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.520
foreskin of the penis without anesthesia and dousing the

320
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:11.040
clitoris with carbolic acid. I mean, what were the

321
00:17:11.219 --> 00:17:12.459
purposes of that?

322
00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:14.420
Yeah, so this was just kind of made in

323
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:19.010
passing in one of John Kellogg's books, um. So

324
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.530
I don't know how widely it was practiced. I

325
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.209
didn't look into that, and so I just kind

326
00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.130
of make a brief reference to it because it

327
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.290
was just a brief reference in his book and

328
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.790
I was focused more on him as a character.

329
00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:34.560
And essentially his reasoning behind including that and advocating

330
00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.739
for it, again, whether he actually practices or not,

331
00:17:38.469 --> 00:17:42.599
um, was to have the child associate something very

332
00:17:42.599 --> 00:17:45.760
negative with their genitals early on as a way

333
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.040
to avoid coming in contact with their own genitals

334
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.520
through masturbation. So it was just a a a

335
00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:56.939
a mechanism of essentially uh torturing a child, so

336
00:17:56.939 --> 00:17:58.939
they would be afraid to touch their genitals because

337
00:17:58.939 --> 00:18:00.739
now they associate their genitals with pain.

338
00:18:02.199 --> 00:18:07.760
Does, uh uh do uh modern or contemporary practices

339
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.140
of female genital mutilation have also anything to do

340
00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.650
with anti-masturbation or not?

341
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.660
I would say less anti-masturbation, more just like control

342
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.380
over sexuality more in general.

343
00:18:21.069 --> 00:18:21.079
Hm,

344
00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:24.469
OK, and it does, and that is being influenced

345
00:18:24.469 --> 00:18:27.750
by different cultural beliefs and practices and what was

346
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.790
coming out of John Kellogg, but certainly the end

347
00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.270
game or the end goal is the same. It's

348
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.699
like, let's reduce sexual drive, let's reduce sexual desire,

349
00:18:36.989 --> 00:18:39.390
because these genitals should only be used for one

350
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.069
very specific purpose. Um, SO that in the, in

351
00:18:43.069 --> 00:18:46.410
the sense, it's, it's, it's, there's significant overlap, but

352
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.270
the cultural reasoning is, is pretty significantly different.

353
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:56.339
Something I learned by reading your book, which before

354
00:18:56.339 --> 00:18:59.699
that I wasn't aware of at all, is that

355
00:18:59.699 --> 00:19:04.219
there's masturbation in masturbation in utero, right? Yeah, I

356
00:19:04.219 --> 00:19:06.290
mean, how, how does that happen?

357
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.780
Yeah, so I had heard that, I don't know

358
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.819
where, some, someplace along my studies I had at

359
00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:13.260
least heard it, I don't think I've ever read

360
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.859
it, uh, so it must have just been during

361
00:19:14.859 --> 00:19:17.319
a lecture or something. And I was like, oh,

362
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.780
let's see, cause I started my, my book off,

363
00:19:19.959 --> 00:19:22.430
uh, a little bit with a developmental perspective first

364
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.760
of like childhood masturbation, and I was like, well,

365
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.859
let's even back up further, because I remember hearing

366
00:19:26.859 --> 00:19:29.209
this thing at one point in my studies. And

367
00:19:29.209 --> 00:19:30.849
looking into it, and there's actually quite a bit

368
00:19:30.849 --> 00:19:35.609
of research that has gone into uh observing fetuses

369
00:19:35.609 --> 00:19:40.689
in utero masturbating. So through uh ultrasound technology. There,

370
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.719
the, the first studies came out of the 80s.

371
00:19:43.109 --> 00:19:46.310
And um yeah, they, they see a uh uh

372
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.280
a fetus um through ultrasound, and they're grasping their

373
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.119
penis and making hand movements. Some of, since they

374
00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:55.920
have the flexibility and the weightlessness of the amniotic

375
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.640
sac, essentially, they, uh, they've been observed uh sucking

376
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.760
on their own penis. Um, FEMALE fetuses too have

377
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.069
been observed masturbating through this technology as well. So

378
00:20:07.069 --> 00:20:10.930
it is well documented. And the mechanism behind it,

379
00:20:10.969 --> 00:20:12.979
it's, it can freak people out and be like,

380
00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:15.239
Whoa, what's going on? We don't normally think of

381
00:20:15.239 --> 00:20:17.849
fetuses as being like very sexually active, let alone

382
00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:22.119
masturbating during the mother's pregnancy. But you know, it's,

383
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.560
it's at that stage of development, they, they don't

384
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.089
have any sex drive, right? They don't have any

385
00:20:27.089 --> 00:20:30.810
kind of endocrine development that would motivate them to

386
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:34.329
seek out sexual stimulation because like they're horny, they

387
00:20:34.329 --> 00:20:37.069
don't have that ability. They don't have any cognitive

388
00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:41.030
functioning where they're fantasizing about the other like sexy

389
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.160
fetuses in the Lamaze class or anything like that.

390
00:20:43.239 --> 00:20:45.920
They don't have that capacity, right? So what's actually

391
00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.839
going on is this is just a basic stimulus

392
00:20:48.839 --> 00:20:52.400
response. They're moving around, they're squirming in utero, and

393
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.050
they happen just through happenstance to come across their,

394
00:20:55.199 --> 00:20:58.839
their genitals. In some capacity, and it was reinforcing

395
00:20:58.839 --> 00:21:01.060
cause it felt good. It was soothing, right? It's

396
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.099
no different than observing in utero thumb sucking or

397
00:21:04.099 --> 00:21:07.079
other types of body rocking. All it's doing is

398
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.609
serving to, to soothe the, the individual. Pretty similar

399
00:21:11.609 --> 00:21:14.380
to at least one motivation that even adults have

400
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.219
with most masturbation is it's, can be self-sooothing. And

401
00:21:18.219 --> 00:21:20.390
so, we obviously as adults have a lot of

402
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:24.140
motivations, different motivations to masturbate. Fetuses, you really just

403
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.060
kind of have that one, and so that's what's

404
00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.500
getting documented and observed.

405
00:21:28.709 --> 00:21:33.750
And in regards to childhood masturbation, how does it

406
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:37.550
develop and is there any problem at all with

407
00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:37.829
it?

408
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.109
Yeah, it's developed pretty similarly as it is in

409
00:21:41.109 --> 00:21:44.000
utero. It's just through happenstance, uh, you know, they're

410
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.880
exploring their bodies, they're exploring their world. Their world

411
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.400
only exists within like a couple of feet of

412
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.709
them, that's their entire universe. And so, of course,

413
00:21:51.719 --> 00:21:55.160
they're going to be exploring through their sensory system

414
00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.000
of, you know, trying to make sense out of

415
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.479
their surroundings, and that includes exploring their own body.

416
00:21:59.949 --> 00:22:02.290
And so, oftentimes they do not have the dexterity

417
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.819
to, to even manually manipulate their, their genitals. So

418
00:22:05.819 --> 00:22:08.430
a lot of times they come across genital stimulation

419
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:12.030
through uh crossing their legs or rubbing up against

420
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.510
something like in their crib or wherever they may

421
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.189
be lying down. And just like anything else, like

422
00:22:17.189 --> 00:22:20.270
I mentioned before, it's stimulus response. They do something

423
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.150
by accident, it feels good, it's reinforcing, they do

424
00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.589
it again. And so it starts serving that function

425
00:22:25.589 --> 00:22:28.150
of a, this is just something to feel good.

426
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.540
Uh, TO do, and it can be soothing, uh,

427
00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:32.709
as well. Again, no different than like thumb sucking

428
00:22:32.709 --> 00:22:35.910
or body rocking, very common child, uh, you know,

429
00:22:35.989 --> 00:22:39.420
infant and toddler types of behaviors. Occasionally, it can

430
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.270
be caused by some type of genital infection, like

431
00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.750
a urinary tract infection in which the soothing is

432
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.510
actually more to soothe the pain. And so, there

433
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.229
is more of a concerted effort to touch the

434
00:22:51.229 --> 00:22:55.229
genitals because they hurt. And then, even after the

435
00:22:55.229 --> 00:22:59.319
infection, uh, goes away, And there's no longer pain,

436
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.920
the, the behavior stays around because they learn that

437
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.119
this is a uh a soothing behavior. This can

438
00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:06.959
feel good, this can alleviate pain. There's no more

439
00:23:06.959 --> 00:23:08.949
pain there, so they're just left with, oh, this

440
00:23:08.949 --> 00:23:12.780
just feels good. Um, FOR the most part, this,

441
00:23:12.859 --> 00:23:14.780
this isn't a problem at all. It can be

442
00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.140
shocking to parents, it can be embarrassing for families,

443
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.250
especially once the child is old enough to like

444
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.180
walk around, and now they're doing this, you know,

445
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.290
in the living room during a dinner party in

446
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.030
front of grandma and grandpa or something. Um, AND

447
00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.339
so those are instances in which parents can just

448
00:23:28.339 --> 00:23:30.469
redirect the behavior of like, you know, there's nothing

449
00:23:30.469 --> 00:23:32.060
wrong with that. Let's just not do it in

450
00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.560
front of grandma. How about we do this by

451
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.540
yourself, you know, in your own room or in

452
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.949
the bathroom. So that's an opportunity for parents to

453
00:23:38.949 --> 00:23:41.540
like just redirect the behavior as opposed to scolding

454
00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.479
the behavior. But oftentimes parents are quick to kind

455
00:23:44.479 --> 00:23:46.760
of have this knee jerk reaction cause they're like

456
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.160
shocked and taken aback. And so they, they can

457
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.510
scold, be like, no, don't do that without the

458
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.069
context of like, no, the behavior was fine, just

459
00:23:54.069 --> 00:23:55.880
like where you were doing it was, was not

460
00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.520
that fine. So, and typically those types of redirections

461
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.160
are very effective, right? It may take a couple

462
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.040
of trials uh for, for that message to kind

463
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.079
of sink in of like where this is appropriate

464
00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:11.459
to do, where this isn't. If that message isn't

465
00:24:11.459 --> 00:24:14.099
sinking in, that could be cause for concern that

466
00:24:14.099 --> 00:24:16.619
there's something else going on, why the, the child

467
00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:21.339
isn't able to develop uh social norms, rules, follow

468
00:24:21.339 --> 00:24:22.930
norms, things like that. So that's not like a

469
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:25.650
masturbation problem, that's more of like a developmental kind

470
00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.369
of problem that should be looked at as to

471
00:24:28.369 --> 00:24:31.699
why they aren't learning the differences between appropriate places

472
00:24:31.699 --> 00:24:33.060
and inappropriate places.

473
00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.910
And how do children learn to be shameful about

474
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.150
masturbation and sex more generally? Yeah,

475
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.109
so that's an interesting thing about sex in general,

476
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.750
and masturbation in particular, is that it's not an

477
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.099
inherently shameful practice. We have to be taught that

478
00:24:48.099 --> 00:24:50.709
it's shameful, um, and so it can be very

479
00:24:50.709 --> 00:24:55.170
easily induced with a lot of shame. By that

480
00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.609
type of reaction I was mentioning earlier of like,

481
00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.119
you know, the child gets caught by a parent,

482
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.969
and instead of like redirecting the behavior, talking about

483
00:25:02.969 --> 00:25:06.020
privacy in appropriate places and things like that, it's

484
00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.489
just met with like, no, don't do that, that's

485
00:25:08.489 --> 00:25:11.290
bad, that's wrong, that's sinful, that's bad for you,

486
00:25:11.329 --> 00:25:14.609
whatever the case may be, without any further explanation.

487
00:25:14.849 --> 00:25:16.729
And yeah, that's going to start, you know, that,

488
00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.290
that's a form of punishment, you know, that's a

489
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.449
verbal punishment. In terms of if we're thinking behaviorism,

490
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.709
you know, we have reinforcement, we have punishment, that's

491
00:25:23.709 --> 00:25:25.869
going to be a form of punishment, whereas trying

492
00:25:25.869 --> 00:25:30.069
to decrease the frequency of that behavior. And so,

493
00:25:30.699 --> 00:25:32.880
That drive may still be there for the child

494
00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.300
to masturbate in some capacity. It feels good, it's

495
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.140
soothing, whatever, passes the time they're bored, um, but

496
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.819
now they're left with, oh, but mom and dad

497
00:25:41.819 --> 00:25:44.500
yelled at me last time they saw me do

498
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.030
this, and so maybe I shouldn't do this, or

499
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.650
they do it and then they feel guilty and

500
00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:50.660
ashamed that they're doing it, right? And so it

501
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.739
can be instilled very, very early on in their

502
00:25:53.739 --> 00:25:56.979
development. Other times, more subtle ways shame can get

503
00:25:56.979 --> 00:25:59.489
introduced is just by not talking about it at

504
00:25:59.489 --> 00:26:01.979
all. We live in a culture enough, and I

505
00:26:01.979 --> 00:26:04.380
think, you know, whether that's Europe or the United

506
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.380
States, we live in a lot of cultures in

507
00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.020
which sex and particularly masturbation just has this cloud

508
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.589
of taboo over it for a variety of reasons.

509
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.140
And even if we don't hear that specifically, especially

510
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.180
from a primary caregiver, we start picking that up

511
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.780
through media, picking it up through friends or peer

512
00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.260
group. That this is something that maybe is a

513
00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.500
little embarrassing, a little taboo, we shouldn't talk about.

514
00:26:28.619 --> 00:26:30.670
No one seems to be talking about it. And

515
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.869
the lack of talking is actually a message in

516
00:26:32.869 --> 00:26:35.750
and of itself. It is reinforcing the taboo. We're

517
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.670
talking about everything else that's going on in our

518
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.030
lives, everything else that's going on with our bodies,

519
00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:43.430
but this one particular behavior seems to be getting

520
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.939
ignored. And so the child starts connecting the dots.

521
00:26:46.949 --> 00:26:49.150
It's like, well, why is that? That must mean

522
00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.260
this is something bad, this is something, you know,

523
00:26:51.339 --> 00:26:54.709
shameful, and that can start instilling some feelings of

524
00:26:54.709 --> 00:26:55.750
shame around it as well.

525
00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.430
So earlier you told us about some of the

526
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.670
negative attitudes that people from some of the most

527
00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:09.270
popular religions in the world, particularly Catholicism, Judaism, have

528
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:14.989
about masturbation. Does, does Satanism have anything to do

529
00:27:14.989 --> 00:27:15.780
with it? The

530
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.359
Satanism? Yeah, and so this was one area of

531
00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:22.079
the book that my publisher was like, what are

532
00:27:22.079 --> 00:27:24.239
you doing here? This seems a little out of

533
00:27:24.239 --> 00:27:26.520
left field. Um, I didn't think it was out

534
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.640
of left field because I, I, I tied in

535
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.660
a lot of like those religions, especially with Christianity,

536
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.619
how they view oftentimes. Masturbation is the work of

537
00:27:36.619 --> 00:27:39.119
the devil, you're being tempted by Satan, there's a

538
00:27:39.119 --> 00:27:40.880
lot of these beliefs of like you're going to

539
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.760
hell, and so I wanted to actually incorporate Satan

540
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.339
in the form of the new religious movement, uh,

541
00:27:47.359 --> 00:27:50.160
Satanism, you're like, oh, OK, like, well, what do

542
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.750
they think? About masturbation. And it is the opposite

543
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:57.209
of that, uh, pretty much that masturbation is just

544
00:27:57.209 --> 00:27:59.369
part of bodily autonomy. And if it feels good,

545
00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.729
you want to do it, do it. If you

546
00:28:00.729 --> 00:28:02.689
have no interest in it, then, then don't do

547
00:28:02.689 --> 00:28:05.390
it. It's pretty much like, do what thou wilt,

548
00:28:05.489 --> 00:28:08.689
right? Um, IT'S your own body, who cares? Um,

549
00:28:08.969 --> 00:28:11.640
YOU know, you shouldn't have these arbitrary rules placed

550
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.010
on you when it doesn't have any impact on

551
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:14.949
anybody else but you.

552
00:28:15.739 --> 00:28:19.260
Mhm. So let's talk then about the no fat

553
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:24.780
movement, semen retention, and influences around it. So what

554
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:30.390
kinds of claims do they make about masturbation and

555
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:35.660
what are the physical be and what they, what

556
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.670
do they say about what are the supposed physical

557
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.849
benefits of masturbation abstinence?

558
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.599
Yeah, so. Kind of got into this a little

559
00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:48.040
bit earlier with the, uh, the origin of the

560
00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.560
book. So, cause that that was coming from semen

561
00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.800
retentionist. So semen retentionist is anybody who thinks that

562
00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.640
it's important for your physical health, your mental well-being

563
00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:01.640
to retain your semen by not ejaculating. No fat

564
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.119
people, um, fapping, the, uh, the slang term for

565
00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:08.160
masturbation, Fapping, so just no fat, so abstaining from

566
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.520
masturbation. There's the capital N and F in that

567
00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.439
of NFA. That's more the established group that started

568
00:29:16.439 --> 00:29:19.640
off on, I believe, Reddit, and they definitely have

569
00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.800
a presence all over different social media platforms, but

570
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.479
no fp lowercase has just kind of turned into

571
00:29:25.479 --> 00:29:28.199
shorthand for not wanting to masturbate for some type

572
00:29:28.199 --> 00:29:32.099
of ideological or health reason. Um, SO they're definitely

573
00:29:32.099 --> 00:29:35.339
anti-masturbation, and they think masturbation is harmful to your

574
00:29:35.339 --> 00:29:38.810
body and therefore, uh, by extension, that abstaining from

575
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.579
masturbation is healthy for your body and, and can

576
00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:45.729
promote wellness. And so, they think that masturbation causes

577
00:29:45.729 --> 00:29:49.780
depression, social anxiety, uh, loss of testosterone, and therefore

578
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.819
a loss of, uh, muscle mass. They think it

579
00:29:52.819 --> 00:29:57.719
decreases motivation. And so, you're less likely to uh

580
00:29:57.719 --> 00:30:02.180
get a girlfriend, uh, get married, have children. Uh,

581
00:30:02.199 --> 00:30:04.890
THEY definitely believe that it causes brain damage primarily

582
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.819
by watching pornography. Um, THEY think it leads to

583
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.310
sexual dysfunction, primarily in the form of erectile, uh,

584
00:30:12.319 --> 00:30:15.319
difficulties, so ED. So, all these different things. And

585
00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:19.140
then the reverse is true. That if you abstain,

586
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.410
you're gonna have high levels of testosterone, muscle gain.

587
00:30:22.459 --> 00:30:25.060
You're gonna have the confidence and motivation to seek

588
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:29.739
out job opportunities, relationships, dating, children, all these things.

589
00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.819
You're gonna have the best sexual functioning, so all

590
00:30:32.819 --> 00:30:36.400
these things. The problem is, none of that's real.

591
00:30:36.579 --> 00:30:40.560
Um, IT, it, it's all misinformation. And a lot

592
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.760
of it is just complete nonsense. I don't even

593
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:47.439
know where it originated from. Other times, it's a

594
00:30:47.439 --> 00:30:51.380
misinterpretation of some studies that they think are claiming

595
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.500
to support that masturbation is harmful in this way.

596
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.420
But it's an inaccurate reading of the research. So

597
00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.500
this is what you have to keep in mind,

598
00:31:00.579 --> 00:31:03.979
like these research studies that sometimes are are freely

599
00:31:03.979 --> 00:31:06.380
available online, which I think is ultimately a good

600
00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.540
thing, but you have to be a trained scientist

601
00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.900
to to understand, like a lot of it and

602
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.300
be able to make sense out of like, what

603
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.380
are these claims, what was the methodology, how does

604
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.180
this one article fit into the body of literature

605
00:31:18.619 --> 00:31:21.430
within this whole topic, right? The average layperson does,

606
00:31:22.439 --> 00:31:24.000
does not have those skills, right? Cause it is

607
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.959
a skill set that uh scientists had to to

608
00:31:26.959 --> 00:31:29.930
train for. And so they read these studies, they

609
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:32.609
think, oh, this study shows that testosterone dropped over

610
00:31:32.609 --> 00:31:35.290
a period of abstinence, that must mean masturbation is,

611
00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:38.410
is bad for your testosterone and abstaining from masturbation

612
00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:41.609
and definitely is going to boost your testosterone. And

613
00:31:41.609 --> 00:31:43.089
there are a couple of studies that looked at

614
00:31:43.089 --> 00:31:46.390
testosterone and abstinence, but it's not claiming actually what

615
00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:49.089
uh the semen retentionists think. So, a lot of

616
00:31:49.089 --> 00:31:52.449
it's just scientific illiteracy and not being able to

617
00:31:52.449 --> 00:31:54.069
accurately interpret data.

618
00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:00.239
So you said then that all the, at least

619
00:32:00.239 --> 00:32:06.680
their most common claims regarding er increasing anxiety, depression,

620
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:12.229
lower motivation. Um, I mean, lower levels of testosterone

621
00:32:12.229 --> 00:32:14.569
and all of that, that they are wrong. So

622
00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:19.869
what do we know scientifically about masturbation? I mean,

623
00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:22.869
what can you tell us scientifically about it? What

624
00:32:22.869 --> 00:32:29.510
are the health benefits and are there any negatives

625
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:34.030
at all for health, for, uh, psychological health or

626
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:34.849
anything like that?

627
00:32:35.689 --> 00:32:37.699
For the most part, masturbation is just a brief

628
00:32:37.699 --> 00:32:41.219
moment of pleasure, and it's largely inconsequential, right? It's

629
00:32:41.219 --> 00:32:45.010
not gonna be necessary for optimal health, and it's,

630
00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.959
it's not gonna be a detriment to your health

631
00:32:47.219 --> 00:32:50.329
either, right? So I think We have to be

632
00:32:50.329 --> 00:32:53.050
cautious. People in my field, in the sexual health

633
00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:57.800
field within psychology. Uh, NOT to oversell masturbation. I

634
00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.199
kind of get into this at the end of

635
00:32:59.199 --> 00:33:00.839
my book when I was starting to see a

636
00:33:00.839 --> 00:33:05.020
lot of other sex therapists, sex researchers, sex educators

637
00:33:05.319 --> 00:33:09.839
start making some Lofty claims about the benefits, the

638
00:33:09.839 --> 00:33:13.750
health benefits of masturbation and be like. Uh, I

639
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:15.229
think that's a little bit of a stretch to

640
00:33:15.229 --> 00:33:18.349
generalize, right? Results may vary, and that's the, the

641
00:33:18.349 --> 00:33:21.650
important thing. There are mechanisms with orgasm, not unique

642
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:27.069
to masturbation, but orgasm in general. The biochemical processes,

643
00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:30.989
the neurobiochemical processes involved with having an orgasm, yeah,

644
00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:34.689
that could be related to lower levels of stress,

645
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:40.270
uh, improved sleep, uh, temporary decreases in experiencing pain.

646
00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.780
It can even decrease nasal congestion, right? There's all

647
00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.660
these factors that go on in our body during

648
00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:50.260
an orgasm and afterwards that would explain why somebody

649
00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:53.500
may have those outcomes and effects and feel as

650
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:57.339
if, you know, their, their nasal congestion was uh

651
00:33:57.339 --> 00:34:00.569
reduced after an orgasm, or they're, they always sleep

652
00:34:00.569 --> 00:34:03.219
better when they, they masturbate right before bed, right?

653
00:34:03.589 --> 00:34:06.469
So there is a, there are explanations as to

654
00:34:06.469 --> 00:34:09.199
why that would be scientific explanations, and for those

655
00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.188
people that would be viewed as obviously as like

656
00:34:11.188 --> 00:34:14.668
a benefit. But results may vary. Not everybody feels

657
00:34:14.668 --> 00:34:17.947
that way after masturbating. Um, IT can just certainly

658
00:34:17.947 --> 00:34:19.868
be, like I mentioned, for most people, just kind

659
00:34:19.868 --> 00:34:22.868
of like this inconsequential behavior, other than the consequence

660
00:34:22.868 --> 00:34:25.898
being pleasure. And that's the number one motivator, uh,

661
00:34:25.908 --> 00:34:28.148
to, to masturbate. There have been some studies that

662
00:34:28.148 --> 00:34:30.018
look at what are all your motivations to, to

663
00:34:30.018 --> 00:34:32.029
masturbate. And there were things that I just mentioned,

664
00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:36.388
more health-related things like improved sleep, decrease stress, unwind,

665
00:34:36.658 --> 00:34:39.628
relax, reduce pain, especially from menstrual cramps, things like

666
00:34:39.628 --> 00:34:43.679
that. But the number one reason by far was

667
00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:46.159
I masturbate because it feels good. And that's, that's

668
00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:48.520
all it needs to be. Now, the upside of,

669
00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.958
of that, um, are there any health, uh, effects

670
00:34:51.958 --> 00:34:57.408
negatively? And it could be. Um, OTHER than like

671
00:34:57.408 --> 00:34:59.368
extreme cases, right? I, I don't want, I don't

672
00:34:59.368 --> 00:35:01.438
want to keep this grounded in reality where like,

673
00:35:01.779 --> 00:35:06.099
you know, hypothetically, someone's masturbating, uh, 300 times a

674
00:35:06.099 --> 00:35:08.579
day with sandpaper. It's like, yeah, that's, that's probably

675
00:35:08.579 --> 00:35:10.898
gonna have a negative impact on, on your genitals,

676
00:35:10.979 --> 00:35:13.858
right? Um, BUT let's, let's keep this more in

677
00:35:13.858 --> 00:35:16.779
kind of reality. Um, THE more likely negative effects

678
00:35:16.779 --> 00:35:19.500
are going to be psychological. And these are going

679
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.500
to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, largely, and it's known

680
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.540
as moral incongruence. This is what happens when you

681
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.179
have this belief of something is bad, it's wrong,

682
00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.350
it's immoral. It's a sin. I shouldn't be doing

683
00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:34.270
this, but you do it anyways. That creates this

684
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:38.550
incongruence between your values and your behavior. And this

685
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.949
incongruence has been associated with a lot of different

686
00:35:40.949 --> 00:35:43.449
types of psychological distress, which it makes sense, right?

687
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:45.870
You're doing something that you told yourself you should

688
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.110
not be doing. And so you can feel shame,

689
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:51.669
you can feel guilt, embarrassment, things like that. And

690
00:35:51.669 --> 00:35:53.969
so, that's not going to be healthy for an

691
00:35:53.969 --> 00:35:56.389
individual to feel bad about their own behaviors.

692
00:35:57.179 --> 00:36:03.050
Yeah, uh, does moral incongruence link to people identifying

693
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:05.100
as masturbation addicts?

694
00:36:05.459 --> 00:36:08.820
Yeah, 100%. It's one, sometimes the, depending on the

695
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.659
study, one of the top predictors of those who

696
00:36:12.659 --> 00:36:15.850
self-label as a masturbation addict or a porn addict,

697
00:36:15.939 --> 00:36:19.000
um, what's driving that is not so much the

698
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.500
frequency in which they are masturbating. Um, SO it's

699
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.379
not like everybody who claims to be a masturbation

700
00:36:25.379 --> 00:36:28.979
addict is masturbating 1015 times a day. Oftentimes they're

701
00:36:28.979 --> 00:36:31.399
just masturbating once a day, a couple of times

702
00:36:31.399 --> 00:36:33.979
a week, something that's very normal for somebody else

703
00:36:33.979 --> 00:36:35.500
that they don't view it as a problem at

704
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.959
all. It's not impacting their life. But for somebody

705
00:36:37.959 --> 00:36:40.500
with moral incongruence, when they've told themselves, I should

706
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.010
not be doing this at all, just doing it

707
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:46.340
once can create this incongruence and this distress. And

708
00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.340
then if you're doing something you told yourself I

709
00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.300
shouldn't be doing, how do you make sense out

710
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.639
of that? Well, I'm out of control. I must

711
00:36:52.639 --> 00:36:54.429
be addicted to it, cause why else would I

712
00:36:54.429 --> 00:36:56.419
be doing this if I wasn't addicted? I want

713
00:36:56.419 --> 00:36:58.500
to stop. I want to cut back, but I

714
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.409
can't. Uh, SO again, less about frequency, it could

715
00:37:01.409 --> 00:37:02.860
just be once a week that they're doing it,

716
00:37:02.899 --> 00:37:05.379
that they're trying to stop. And uh they're more

717
00:37:05.379 --> 00:37:07.780
likely to label themselves as a masturbation addict as

718
00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:08.239
a result.

719
00:37:09.239 --> 00:37:12.199
And this moral incongruence, I mean, the sources of

720
00:37:12.199 --> 00:37:16.760
it might be religious beliefs against masturbation and some

721
00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.120
of these other beliefs put forth by, for example,

722
00:37:20.479 --> 00:37:26.489
the no fat people and the anti-masturbation crusaders.

723
00:37:26.719 --> 00:37:30.320
Yeah, 100%. It's largely fueled by religious beliefs about

724
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.260
masturbation. Um, BUT I mean, in a, from a

725
00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:37.510
secular perspective and religious beliefs aside, you could have,

726
00:37:37.719 --> 00:37:39.409
so what was very common when I used to

727
00:37:39.409 --> 00:37:43.679
do clinical work before getting into academia. I can't

728
00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:47.949
recall more than like 2 patients I ever saw.

729
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:50.689
And I was treating, uh, I was a psychologist

730
00:37:50.689 --> 00:37:53.469
at a sexual health clinic and a large program

731
00:37:53.469 --> 00:37:55.870
that we had was dealing with what was called

732
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:58.050
at the time, at least, compulsive sexual behavior. And

733
00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:00.449
so a lot of those guys were, um, you

734
00:38:00.449 --> 00:38:02.209
know, they were masturb what they thought were, they

735
00:38:02.209 --> 00:38:04.560
were masturbating too much, watching porn and masturbating too

736
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.570
much, things like that. I can only think of

737
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:09.550
like 2 instances in which the patients were single

738
00:38:09.729 --> 00:38:11.919
and came in, like single as in like not

739
00:38:11.919 --> 00:38:15.340
having a partner, a girlfriend or a spouse. Um,

740
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:17.290
SO, all the other guys were coming in because

741
00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:20.179
this was causing problems in the relationship. If they

742
00:38:20.179 --> 00:38:22.060
were single, it wasn't going to be a problem.

743
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.300
But it was an issue in the relationship. So

744
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.610
you can also have this moral incongruence where it

745
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:29.370
doesn't fit the values of the relationship more so

746
00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:32.020
than the individual. And so if the relationship, if

747
00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.860
your partner is saying, I'm not comfortable with you

748
00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.219
masturbating, I think it's a form of cheating, I

749
00:38:36.219 --> 00:38:38.340
get insecure because I think like, why are you

750
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.419
masturbating? If we could be having sex, are you

751
00:38:40.419 --> 00:38:43.260
unsatisfied? It just creates a lot of what I

752
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.899
think is unnecessary stress on the relationship, but this

753
00:38:46.899 --> 00:38:48.500
is a reality for a lot of couples of

754
00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.219
how they feel about one partner masturbating or looking

755
00:38:51.219 --> 00:38:54.709
at porn. And so they have this rule, or

756
00:38:54.709 --> 00:38:56.389
a lot of times it's even an unspoken rule

757
00:38:56.389 --> 00:38:59.870
that masturbation, especially masturbating to porn, should not be

758
00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.889
happening in this relationship. But of course the person

759
00:39:02.889 --> 00:39:04.989
does it anyways, and so that creates that same

760
00:39:04.989 --> 00:39:07.689
incongruence. They're doing something that they know they shouldn't

761
00:39:07.689 --> 00:39:09.550
be doing, but are doing it anyways. They can

762
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:12.429
feel guilt, shame, embarrassment, and if they get caught,

763
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:14.629
which they often do, then you have a pretty

764
00:39:14.629 --> 00:39:18.629
significant relationship conflict on your hands. So that's outside

765
00:39:18.629 --> 00:39:21.060
of any kind of religious teaching. Uh, CAUSE that

766
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.739
can just maybe a relationship rule that has nothing

767
00:39:23.739 --> 00:39:26.550
to do with religion. But even with the single

768
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.340
guys, a lot of the no fat guys are

769
00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:32.919
actually not religious at all, um. And so their

770
00:39:32.919 --> 00:39:35.439
belief is more about how this is impacting their

771
00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:37.439
body, and so they just really buy into a

772
00:39:37.439 --> 00:39:39.959
lot of health misinformation. And so they don't want

773
00:39:39.959 --> 00:39:43.389
to masturbate for that reason. They're scapegoating masturbation as

774
00:39:43.389 --> 00:39:46.360
a reason why they don't have bigger muscles, why

775
00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.080
they don't have the girlfriend that they want, maybe

776
00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.479
why they don't have the job that they want,

777
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.520
right? So masturbation is pointed to as this is

778
00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.199
why cut out masturbation, you'll start seeing improvements in

779
00:39:55.199 --> 00:39:57.709
all areas of your life. So they take that

780
00:39:57.709 --> 00:40:00.129
on themselves. That's their new goal, like their fitness

781
00:40:00.129 --> 00:40:03.479
goal almost. And if they slip, which they always

782
00:40:03.479 --> 00:40:06.790
do. Um, THEN they're gonna feel really bad about

783
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:09.189
themselves and label themselves as a sex addict because

784
00:40:09.189 --> 00:40:12.409
they're doing something that they had prohibited for themselves.

785
00:40:13.689 --> 00:40:19.399
When it comes to incongruence that stems from relationship

786
00:40:19.399 --> 00:40:22.979
values because your partner is not comfortable with you

787
00:40:22.979 --> 00:40:27.739
masturbating, is there anything that people can do about

788
00:40:27.739 --> 00:40:31.100
it? I mean, to deal with that in their

789
00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.159
own relationship.

790
00:40:33.679 --> 00:40:37.280
Yeah. Um, THIS can be complex because, you know,

791
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.080
this often relies on couples therapy to really um

792
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.550
understand what is the, uh, the opposition, uh, to

793
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:48.719
masturbation. What is this actually about? A lot of

794
00:40:48.719 --> 00:40:52.639
times, even like masturbation itself isn't the scapegoat, but

795
00:40:52.639 --> 00:40:56.719
what's bringing people into therapy is porn. That, oh,

796
00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.360
my partner is watching porn, he's a porn addict,

797
00:40:59.679 --> 00:41:02.360
um, he needs to not watch this at all.

798
00:41:02.439 --> 00:41:05.780
This is causing problems in our relationship. And that's

799
00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.830
where you start as a couples therapist of like

800
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:10.139
working through, OK, like, what does this look like?

801
00:41:10.229 --> 00:41:12.709
What are your values around this? But it's pretty

802
00:41:12.709 --> 00:41:16.260
clear, and this was certainly my experience doing clinical

803
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:20.199
work. That It's less about the porn and more

804
00:41:20.199 --> 00:41:22.280
about the masturbation. So if you take porn out

805
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.620
of the equation, it's like, OK, are you comfortable

806
00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:28.429
with your partner just masturbating to fantasy? And typically

807
00:41:28.429 --> 00:41:31.510
no. And so the issue wasn't about whether their

808
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.760
eyes were open looking at a screen or closed,

809
00:41:34.939 --> 00:41:37.469
playing a fantasy in their own mind. The problem

810
00:41:37.469 --> 00:41:39.830
was that they had a solo sex life or

811
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.750
a sex life that didn't include them, right, as

812
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.790
their partner, right? And that brought up the same

813
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:48.310
stuff like, are you dissatisfied, um, you know, I,

814
00:41:48.469 --> 00:41:50.139
I think this is a form of cheating. I'm

815
00:41:50.139 --> 00:41:53.030
not comfortable with you experiencing sexual pleasure without me,

816
00:41:53.149 --> 00:41:55.129
kind of all these things, right? And there's no

817
00:41:55.129 --> 00:41:59.010
right or wrong there, um, of like, which partner

818
00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:00.929
is right, which values do you have to adhere

819
00:42:00.929 --> 00:42:03.840
to, but the couple's work then is like, is

820
00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.050
there any kind of middle ground? Can we explore

821
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:10.250
this enough of like, what could be a reasonable

822
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.449
solution to this, if this person desires masturbation, but

823
00:42:13.449 --> 00:42:15.689
you are adamantly opposed to it. And there may

824
00:42:15.689 --> 00:42:17.810
not be a resolution, and this could be a

825
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.780
relationship killer for some that they, they just cannot

826
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.139
see eye to eye, and it's just going to

827
00:42:22.139 --> 00:42:25.820
lead to secrecy and continuous violations of trust and

828
00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.449
betrayal. But for others, there may be um like

829
00:42:29.449 --> 00:42:33.649
some type of middle ground of like, where there,

830
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.129
it's at least out in the open, uh, because

831
00:42:36.129 --> 00:42:38.889
a lot of what's damaging with this within relationships

832
00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:42.169
is the secret keeping, um, that the one partner

833
00:42:42.169 --> 00:42:45.090
is secretly masturbating, masturbating to porn, and then they

834
00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:46.929
get caught, and it's like, oh, this is what

835
00:42:46.929 --> 00:42:48.729
you were doing in here. I thought you were

836
00:42:48.729 --> 00:42:50.889
doing, you know, something else. So, it's a completely

837
00:42:50.889 --> 00:42:53.649
different perception of what your partner's doing, uh, if

838
00:42:53.649 --> 00:42:56.090
they're doing something in secret that they're intentionally hiding

839
00:42:56.090 --> 00:43:00.080
from you. So that's oftentimes the most destructive element

840
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.520
with this is just the secrecy and less so

841
00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.419
about the porn and less so about the masturbation.

842
00:43:04.639 --> 00:43:06.610
And so for those those couples, it's like, OK,

843
00:43:06.719 --> 00:43:09.860
can we acknowledge that masturbation exists in this relationship?

844
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:12.669
And one of you or both of you do

845
00:43:12.669 --> 00:43:15.179
enjoy masturbating from time to time. For the most

846
00:43:15.179 --> 00:43:17.520
part, it does not influence the relationship in any

847
00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:21.000
way. We can explore how masturbation meets certain needs

848
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.739
that partnered sex does not, just as partnered sex

849
00:43:23.739 --> 00:43:27.100
meets certain needs that masturbation cannot. They're separate behaviors.

850
00:43:27.399 --> 00:43:29.560
And if they can all agree on that, then

851
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.239
the issue isn't secret anymore, but they can still

852
00:43:32.239 --> 00:43:34.879
have a sense of privacy that they can masturbate

853
00:43:34.879 --> 00:43:37.510
in private, but it's no longer a secret. There's

854
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.979
no way of like, quote unquote getting caught.

855
00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:44.250
But does that tend to be a frequent issue

856
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:48.729
in relationships where one of the partners masturbates and

857
00:43:48.729 --> 00:43:52.050
the one and the other doesn't, or is it,

858
00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:56.290
or do you find that most couples tend to

859
00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:59.649
just deal well with it or not care about

860
00:43:59.649 --> 00:44:00.889
it? I mean.

861
00:44:01.459 --> 00:44:02.959
Yeah, it's a little bit of a mixed bag

862
00:44:02.959 --> 00:44:06.290
and pers perspectives are skewed because a lot of

863
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:10.379
times questions are asked this to clinicians, uh, myself

864
00:44:10.379 --> 00:44:12.179
included, so we're seeing where it already kind of

865
00:44:12.179 --> 00:44:15.820
exploded in relationships or kind of dealing possibly just

866
00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:20.669
with one type of dynamic. But oftentimes it is

867
00:44:20.669 --> 00:44:23.110
either just one partner does it and the other

868
00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:26.530
doesn't at all. Uh, OTHER times one partner watches

869
00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.260
porn and masturbates, the other person just masturbates and

870
00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:32.239
doesn't watch porn. OK. And then other times it

871
00:44:32.239 --> 00:44:35.070
can be a frequency discrepancy of like, oh, they're

872
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:38.639
masturbating several times a week, whereas like, I'm not

873
00:44:38.639 --> 00:44:40.639
against masturbation, but I only do it like once

874
00:44:40.639 --> 00:44:42.590
a month. And so that's more of like a

875
00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:45.679
desire discrepancy that's very common in relationships, but more

876
00:44:45.679 --> 00:44:48.120
so a desire discrepancy about how often you have

877
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.080
partnered sex. But those desire discrepancies can also play

878
00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.199
out with masturbation, because we can start making assumptions

879
00:44:54.199 --> 00:44:56.919
about our partner based on their frequency of masturbation.

880
00:44:57.199 --> 00:44:58.229
So it can come out in a couple of

881
00:44:58.229 --> 00:44:58.760
different ways.

882
00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:04.520
But on the topic of uh masturbation addiction, is

883
00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.969
there really such a thing, or is it just

884
00:45:07.969 --> 00:45:12.649
simply a matter of moral or relationship incongruence?

885
00:45:13.669 --> 00:45:16.989
For how we think about addiction, it doesn't really

886
00:45:16.989 --> 00:45:20.780
line up that well with masturbation or with porn,

887
00:45:20.989 --> 00:45:22.949
right? So if we think of substance use and

888
00:45:22.949 --> 00:45:28.270
substance use disorders of experiencing an intoxication from the

889
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:31.350
substance and then continuing to seek out that feeling

890
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:34.159
of intoxication. To the point that we're developing a

891
00:45:34.159 --> 00:45:37.159
tolerance, and we develop that tolerance over time, and

892
00:45:37.159 --> 00:45:38.760
that we need to start taking more of the

893
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.239
substance more frequently or in higher doses in order

894
00:45:41.239 --> 00:45:44.270
to get that same feeling of intoxication. And then

895
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:46.949
if we develop that tolerance and stop, we have

896
00:45:46.949 --> 00:45:50.570
some type of withdrawal syndrome. That's, that's not playing

897
00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:53.590
out with masturbation. Physiologically, it does not play out

898
00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:55.709
in that way. There's not tolerance, there's not withdrawal.

899
00:45:55.939 --> 00:45:58.790
It may feel difficult to, you know, if you're

900
00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:01.429
a daily masturbator, then to stop masturbating, but that's

901
00:46:01.429 --> 00:46:03.989
not a withdrawal syndrome of your body's like used

902
00:46:03.989 --> 00:46:06.699
to orgasms. Because what's, what's the half-life of an

903
00:46:06.699 --> 00:46:09.229
orgasm? It's just a couple of seconds, right? Whereas

904
00:46:09.229 --> 00:46:12.669
you ingest um cocaine or heroin, it has a

905
00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:15.110
much longer half-life in your body where you're experiencing

906
00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.500
the effects of it. So, in a lot of

907
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.110
ways, it does not operate similarly to addiction, and

908
00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:24.550
so it's, I certainly do not. Categorize it in

909
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:28.899
that way. But I want to say that can

910
00:46:28.899 --> 00:46:34.469
people Experience significant problems in their life, in their

911
00:46:34.469 --> 00:46:39.550
relationships, uh, because of masturbation, absolutely, right, and so

912
00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:41.149
that's where it kind of gets more into that

913
00:46:41.149 --> 00:46:43.709
moral incongruence thing and that that can certainly be

914
00:46:43.709 --> 00:46:46.139
destructive in someone's life, and that is related to

915
00:46:46.139 --> 00:46:50.689
masturbation, obviously, but it's more related to their attitudes

916
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:54.050
toward masturbation and the conflict now up against their

917
00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:58.030
masturbatory behavior. The other avenue in which to explore

918
00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:01.870
that's clinically relevant. It's what's called emotional regulation or

919
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:05.429
dysregulation. And that's, that's shown up in the literature

920
00:47:05.429 --> 00:47:08.389
too of the self-described like porn addicts or sex

921
00:47:08.389 --> 00:47:11.429
addicts that if it's not related to this moral

922
00:47:11.429 --> 00:47:16.479
incongruence, there can be some motivation for emotional regulation,

923
00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:18.870
that they have a lot of stress that may

924
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:21.090
not be diagnosable. It's just kind of general stress,

925
00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:23.429
or it could be a diagnosable condition of a

926
00:47:23.429 --> 00:47:26.979
mood disorder, an anxiety disorder, you know, something that

927
00:47:26.979 --> 00:47:31.570
is psychiatric. For them, that they're looking for coping

928
00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:34.800
mechanisms. And there's nothing inherently wrong, obviously, with looking

929
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.770
for coping mechanisms, we all need them. And masturbation

930
00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:39.629
can be that, and there's nothing inherently wrong with

931
00:47:39.629 --> 00:47:43.489
that. People will get into problems with masturbation if

932
00:47:43.489 --> 00:47:47.409
it's their only coping mechanism, right? And then especially

933
00:47:47.409 --> 00:47:50.090
if you have high levels of stress, psychiatric disorders

934
00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:52.810
in which you need a whole array of coping

935
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:56.290
strategies to deal with your symptoms, uh, to better

936
00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:58.889
manage your symptoms, if you're only relying on masturbation,

937
00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:01.250
that's where you're gonna start seeing some compulsive use

938
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.600
of it, some high frequency use, some use in

939
00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:06.530
inappropriate places. You're stressed out at work, you masturbate

940
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:09.469
at work. Looking at, looking at porn on your

941
00:48:09.469 --> 00:48:11.719
work computer, gonna get in trouble, you know, at

942
00:48:11.719 --> 00:48:15.889
your job, right? That's all kind of Looked at

943
00:48:15.889 --> 00:48:18.090
as, oh, you're a porn addict, you're a sex

944
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:20.209
addict because you looked at this at work, you

945
00:48:20.209 --> 00:48:21.800
know, you're out of your mind. It's like, well,

946
00:48:22.169 --> 00:48:24.879
digging a little bit deeper, the function of that

947
00:48:24.879 --> 00:48:28.209
behavior was emotional regulation, right? To, to regulate a

948
00:48:28.209 --> 00:48:31.209
dysregulated body. Um, SO we can see at that

949
00:48:31.209 --> 00:48:33.810
like the masturbation and whether it's to porn or

950
00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:37.330
not, it's more of a function to alleviate symptoms

951
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:38.850
of some other type of pathology.

952
00:48:40.149 --> 00:48:44.969
Right. Just going back for a second to the

953
00:48:44.969 --> 00:48:47.929
no fat people, and I mean, in this particular

954
00:48:47.929 --> 00:48:51.169
case, uh, I heard this kind of claim not

955
00:48:51.169 --> 00:48:53.889
only from them but also from some of the

956
00:48:53.889 --> 00:49:00.850
other anti-masturbation crusaders because they say that it's, or

957
00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:04.530
some of them claim that it's not just masturbation.

958
00:49:04.635 --> 00:49:09.264
That is harmful, but even ejaculation itself, I mean,

959
00:49:10.635 --> 00:49:15.074
why wouldn't, uh, if that's the case, why wouldn't

960
00:49:15.074 --> 00:49:19.554
it also be harmful to ejaculate during sex? Does

961
00:49:19.554 --> 00:49:21.385
this make any sense at all?

962
00:49:21.715 --> 00:49:23.594
No, it doesn't make sense. There and there's only

963
00:49:23.594 --> 00:49:26.794
been a couple of people throughout like this anti-masturbation

964
00:49:27.034 --> 00:49:29.820
health crusade over the past couple of years. That

965
00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:33.739
were ideologically consistent. Franklin Graham, he was a reverend

966
00:49:33.739 --> 00:49:35.699
in New England in the early 1800s. He was

967
00:49:35.699 --> 00:49:38.979
consistent thinking that any orgasm was bad for your

968
00:49:38.979 --> 00:49:41.290
body, right? So, at least that made sense. Like

969
00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:45.060
if you think having an orgasm and particularly ejaculating

970
00:49:45.189 --> 00:49:47.679
is doing all this physical damage to your body,

971
00:49:47.699 --> 00:49:50.100
and like what you, what you said, well, wouldn't

972
00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:53.060
that happen with intercourse, uh, just as much as

973
00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.560
it would during masturbation? And like, yeah, it should.

974
00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.870
Um, AND so, Graham recognized that. Um, BUT a

975
00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:02.149
lot of others do not, especially today, it's, it's

976
00:50:02.149 --> 00:50:07.199
rare to see that distinction, uh, made, um. Or

977
00:50:07.199 --> 00:50:09.800
lack of lack of distinction, rather. Usually what you

978
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.020
see today is that, no, masturbation is physically harmful

979
00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:16.310
to you, ejaculation from masturbation is physically harmful to

980
00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:19.830
you, but partnered sex is healthy for you, right?

981
00:50:19.959 --> 00:50:21.439
You need to strive to do that because that's

982
00:50:21.439 --> 00:50:23.750
what nature has intended for you. That's what God

983
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:26.360
has intended for you, whatever their argument, underlying argument

984
00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:30.360
is. Physiologically, it doesn't really matter. There are some

985
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.280
differences in terms of how we make sense out

986
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.919
of situations, right? That's why, you know, we can

987
00:50:34.919 --> 00:50:37.550
get certain needs met with a partner sexually that

988
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:40.840
we can't individually and vice versa. Um, SO there

989
00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.520
are some like, you know, relational needs that get

990
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.040
met. There's some bonding, there's some feelings of closeness.

991
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:50.379
With partnered sex that aren't necessarily there with masturbation.

992
00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:54.360
But in terms of the physical mechanism of expelling

993
00:50:54.439 --> 00:50:57.860
semen from your body, that semen doesn't care if

994
00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.209
it's going inside of a vagina or landing on

995
00:51:00.209 --> 00:51:04.280
an iPad. Physiologically, No difference.

996
00:51:05.949 --> 00:51:11.840
And do people also report better orgasms during sex

997
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.560
than during masturbation?

998
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:17.139
I've seen some studies that try to look at

999
00:51:17.139 --> 00:51:22.719
that, and yeah, there has been greater satisfaction with

1000
00:51:22.719 --> 00:51:27.600
uh partnered sex orgasms than solo sex. Um, BUT

1001
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.120
then you hear, you know, other studies, I haven't

1002
00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.120
seen like any empirical data on this, so they're

1003
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.280
left with just anecdotes which are not data, but

1004
00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:39.959
saying that I can only climax from solo sex,

1005
00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:44.149
right, primarily women, right, that Um, masturbation is my

1006
00:51:44.149 --> 00:51:47.729
only means to orgasm, um, or if they can't

1007
00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:49.909
orgasm with a partner, it's kind of like, uh,

1008
00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:52.189
it took forever and it finally got there, and

1009
00:51:52.189 --> 00:51:54.750
I was like, yeah, OK, but masturbating with my

1010
00:51:54.750 --> 00:52:00.629
vibrator, consistent, reliable, and very, very intense orgasms, right?

1011
00:52:00.909 --> 00:52:03.989
But the research on guys has shown that subjectively,

1012
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:09.179
obviously the subjective experience. That masturbation is kind of

1013
00:52:09.179 --> 00:52:13.739
second tier to partnered sex. Now, whether, and it's

1014
00:52:13.739 --> 00:52:15.780
impossible to kind of measure that unless they are

1015
00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:19.419
hooked up to physiological reading equipment that would measure

1016
00:52:19.419 --> 00:52:22.340
the intensity of the muscle contractions during orgasm and

1017
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:26.419
is that different than with a partner? So maybe

1018
00:52:26.419 --> 00:52:29.139
there are physiological differences, but my guess would be

1019
00:52:29.139 --> 00:52:32.260
it's more of a perceptual difference, right, that having

1020
00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.379
sex with a partner, having an orgasm with a

1021
00:52:34.379 --> 00:52:37.540
partner has a lot more reinforcers attached to it,

1022
00:52:37.739 --> 00:52:40.899
a lot less taboo attached to it. So the

1023
00:52:40.899 --> 00:52:43.020
perception is it's a lot more enjoyable.

1024
00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:47.679
Are there any way, any other ways apart from

1025
00:52:47.939 --> 00:52:53.780
moral incongruence and relationship incongruence that people might feel

1026
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:55.820
bad after masturbation?

1027
00:52:57.239 --> 00:53:04.540
Um Well, those are the drivers, uh, of why

1028
00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:07.540
they may feel bad, the mechanism of which they

1029
00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:11.739
may feel bad. Oftentimes is legit, and it's not

1030
00:53:11.739 --> 00:53:15.219
just, you know, they're making it up that, and

1031
00:53:15.219 --> 00:53:16.969
I, I didn't think that interacting with some of

1032
00:53:16.969 --> 00:53:19.459
these guys early on in the, the, the book

1033
00:53:19.459 --> 00:53:21.270
development when they were telling me that they feel

1034
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:26.139
depressed and a motivated. A little socially anxious after

1035
00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:29.429
they had an orgasm for masturbation. I didn't think

1036
00:53:29.429 --> 00:53:31.689
they were making that up. I, I believe that

1037
00:53:31.699 --> 00:53:34.429
that's what they felt. And my belief with this

1038
00:53:34.429 --> 00:53:37.350
is that it, it operates similarly to how somatic,

1039
00:53:37.429 --> 00:53:40.229
a lot of somatic disorders exist. So, for those

1040
00:53:40.229 --> 00:53:43.510
unfamiliar, somatic disorders is a category of mental disorders

1041
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:46.139
that include things like, in layman's terms, like being

1042
00:53:46.139 --> 00:53:52.100
a hypochondriac, right? Um, That you, whether or not

1043
00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:55.239
there's actually something physically there, you interpret it as

1044
00:53:55.239 --> 00:53:57.479
something very, very wrong with you, you know, a

1045
00:53:57.479 --> 00:54:00.959
headache isn't just like, oh, I have tension today,

1046
00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.639
right? A headache is an indication that you have

1047
00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:05.399
a brain tumor, right? Um, AND sometimes you may

1048
00:54:05.399 --> 00:54:09.159
not even have anything detectable, um, that a physician

1049
00:54:09.159 --> 00:54:12.000
could find wrong with you, but you're convinced that,

1050
00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:13.959
you know, something is wrong with you, right? So

1051
00:54:13.959 --> 00:54:17.250
whether there is an underlying factor or not, Um,

1052
00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:18.929
this is all kind of like a manifestation of

1053
00:54:18.929 --> 00:54:22.810
a somatic disorder. How this plays out with masturbation

1054
00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:25.610
and guilt and feeling bad afterwards is that, yeah,

1055
00:54:25.689 --> 00:54:29.729
the, the post-orgasm experience does have a plethora of

1056
00:54:29.729 --> 00:54:33.729
neurotransmitters and hormones involved that are supposed to, to

1057
00:54:33.729 --> 00:54:38.520
make you feel at ease, satiated, calm, right? Things

1058
00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.389
like that. And most people interpret that that's a

1059
00:54:41.389 --> 00:54:45.310
pleasurable experience, as it kind of, you know, took

1060
00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:47.750
the, the steam out of the pressure a little

1061
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:50.989
bit, um, or pressure out of the steam, whatever

1062
00:54:50.989 --> 00:54:55.510
that analogy is, um. And it satisfied the sexual

1063
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:58.110
drive, so you feel satiated, so you feel less

1064
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:00.709
driven, at least in this one area. But for

1065
00:55:00.709 --> 00:55:04.830
those who feel masturbation should be avoided, they could

1066
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:09.250
misinterpret those feelings, same feelings, but instead of feeling

1067
00:55:09.649 --> 00:55:15.709
satiated and relaxed, they feel unmotivated and depressed. So

1068
00:55:15.709 --> 00:55:19.699
that's how they're interpreting the sensation of post orgasm,

1069
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:22.800
that it robbed them of all motivation. Uh, NOT

1070
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.000
just sexual motivation, but oh, now they can't go

1071
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.439
to the gym, uh, they can't walk up to,

1072
00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:30.709
to women and introduce themselves, right? They feel depressed,

1073
00:55:30.719 --> 00:55:32.520
even though other people say like, oh no, this

1074
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.520
is just kind of feeling relaxed. It's like, no,

1075
00:55:34.629 --> 00:55:38.040
this feels like depression to me, right? And so

1076
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.919
those kinds of things can, can happen. And it's

1077
00:55:39.919 --> 00:55:41.959
more, I'm not calling it a somatic disorder, but

1078
00:55:41.959 --> 00:55:44.520
it operates similarly as a somatic disorder.

1079
00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:49.760
OK. So, are there people, uh, I mean, I,

1080
00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.399
I, I'm, I guess there are, but, uh, are

1081
00:55:52.399 --> 00:55:58.979
there particular people, maybe feminists who start from an

1082
00:55:58.989 --> 00:56:05.760
anti-porn position and then end up in an anti-masturbation

1083
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:09.679
position, and if so, what kinds of claims do

1084
00:56:09.679 --> 00:56:10.800
they tend to make?

1085
00:56:11.629 --> 00:56:14.149
Yeah, the, the feminist arguments against porn, that's been

1086
00:56:14.149 --> 00:56:16.610
going on since, you know, at least the 1970s.

1087
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:19.149
They've been known as like the sex wars or

1088
00:56:19.149 --> 00:56:21.550
the porn wars through the 1970s and the 198980s.

1089
00:56:21.919 --> 00:56:23.989
It's hotly contested. Again, it's not all branches of

1090
00:56:23.989 --> 00:56:26.870
feminism. There's plenty of branches of feminism that embrace

1091
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:29.629
pornography, workers' rights, viewing it more from a, you

1092
00:56:29.629 --> 00:56:32.110
know, worker's perspective, things like that. So there is

1093
00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:36.989
a particular ideology within feminism that views pornography as

1094
00:56:36.989 --> 00:56:41.270
violence against women, degradation against women, exploitation and objectification

1095
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:45.590
of women. So those are ideological arguments, right? And

1096
00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:49.679
you can't debate that scientifically because that's like, Debating,

1097
00:56:49.919 --> 00:56:51.479
thinking that porn is a sin. I was like,

1098
00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.229
well, OK, if that's your belief, then that's your

1099
00:56:53.229 --> 00:56:55.419
belief. I can't point to studies where it says,

1100
00:56:55.479 --> 00:56:58.199
no, this isn't a sin, right? Um, SO the

1101
00:56:58.199 --> 00:57:01.120
problem is that both with like the religious arguments,

1102
00:57:01.199 --> 00:57:04.110
the spiritual arguments, and some of the feminist arguments

1103
00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:09.260
against pornography. They're largely ideological, but oftentimes they kind

1104
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:12.850
of cherry pick some empirical evidence, some of the

1105
00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:17.060
science to support their claims. Oftentimes, like I mentioned

1106
00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:21.020
earlier, they're selecting articles based on a misunderstanding and

1107
00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:25.500
misinterpretation of what that study actually is saying. Um,

1108
00:57:26.179 --> 00:57:28.989
SO some scientific illiteracy is going on. But I

1109
00:57:28.989 --> 00:57:33.320
would say that for the most part, feminist anti-porn

1110
00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:38.159
arguments don't turn into anti-masturbation arguments as easily as

1111
00:57:38.159 --> 00:57:43.120
religious anti-porn arguments turn into anti-masturbation. And that's because

1112
00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.879
for the religious ideology, all of it is a

1113
00:57:46.879 --> 00:57:52.760
sin, Masturbation, porn, watching porn without masturbation, it's all

1114
00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:55.600
outside of the purview of what God wants for

1115
00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:00.439
your sexuality. For the feminist argument, it's it largely

1116
00:58:00.439 --> 00:58:03.939
is focused on the exploitation of women within pornography

1117
00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:06.639
and concerns about seeing that, what that's going to

1118
00:58:06.639 --> 00:58:11.040
do to men in real life and enact aggression

1119
00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.520
against women in real life.

1120
00:58:13.729 --> 00:58:18.620
But, but sometimes they make claims about the, uh,

1121
00:58:18.699 --> 00:58:21.739
the effects that watching porn might have on the

1122
00:58:21.739 --> 00:58:24.350
sexual health of men as well.

1123
00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.580
Yeah, they do, but that's still focused on porn,

1124
00:58:27.699 --> 00:58:30.699
uh, for the most part, and not necessarily masturbation.

1125
00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:36.840
Um, WHERE I do see occasionally a feminist anti-porn

1126
00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:41.040
argument go into just an anti-masturbation argument, gets into

1127
00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:44.399
some thought policing of like, OK, take the porn

1128
00:58:44.399 --> 00:58:47.199
out of the equation. Are you free to masturbate

1129
00:58:47.199 --> 00:58:49.639
to to whatever? It's like, no, like, what are

1130
00:58:49.639 --> 00:58:53.080
you thinking about, uh, right? And is that those

1131
00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:57.729
fantasies. Just similar to the, the pornography that they

1132
00:58:57.729 --> 00:59:01.590
opposed to. Does it include instances of male dominance

1133
00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:05.409
and female submission, right? Um, SO they, I, I've

1134
00:59:05.409 --> 00:59:08.209
seen it sometimes they're concerned about fantasy life during

1135
00:59:08.209 --> 00:59:10.489
masturbation, and that would be more of an anti-masturbation

1136
00:59:10.489 --> 00:59:15.969
argument. Similarly, using sex toys, uh, male sex toys,

1137
00:59:15.979 --> 00:59:18.969
uh, for sexual pleasure of like flashlights, pocket pussies.

1138
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:23.030
Um, ESPECIALLY sex dolls, um, that that comes up

1139
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:25.260
with the same arguments that this is just acting

1140
00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:28.189
out male dominance against women sexually.

1141
00:59:28.989 --> 00:59:32.750
And that it promotes the objectification of women,

1142
00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:36.340
right? Correct, yeah, and, and especially with like the

1143
00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:39.250
sex toys, there, there isn't really data to support

1144
00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:40.830
that those fears are, are true.

1145
00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:44.379
Yeah, and I also, uh, and now I want

1146
00:59:44.379 --> 00:59:47.939
to focus specifically on porn because I mean, there's,

1147
00:59:48.159 --> 00:59:50.800
uh of course you said that there's not a

1148
00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:57.600
big link between Anti-porn feminism and anti-masturbation feminism, but

1149
00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:01.199
they also make lots of claims about pornography itself

1150
01:00:01.199 --> 01:00:05.139
that might be wrong. I mean they also claim

1151
01:00:05.139 --> 01:00:11.179
that watching porn causes sexual violence. Is there any

1152
01:00:11.179 --> 01:00:12.580
evidence to support that?

1153
01:00:13.419 --> 01:00:15.419
Not overall, right? So there's been a couple of

1154
01:00:15.419 --> 01:00:18.179
meta-analyses that have been done on this issue, the

1155
01:00:18.179 --> 01:00:20.659
link between violence and pornography, and for the most

1156
01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:24.340
part, watching pornography is going to be very inconsequential

1157
01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:28.139
to a person's own behavior, particularly aggressive and violent

1158
01:00:28.139 --> 01:00:31.459
behavior. But this is where it gets very nuanced.

1159
01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:34.560
So, you know, a lot of times anti-porn arguments,

1160
01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.580
uh, label all porn bad and that it's going

1161
01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:41.379
to have a negative effect on all viewers. There's

1162
01:00:41.379 --> 01:00:44.219
no research to support that whatsoever, not even close,

1163
01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:47.290
right? So we can't say that porn is inherently

1164
01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:49.850
harmful to people and especially in this area that

1165
01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:53.850
causes violence or aggression, particularly against women. No research

1166
01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.530
to support that. So now we have to look

1167
01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:57.570
at it a little bit more nuanced of like,

1168
01:00:57.649 --> 01:01:01.570
well, is there certain types of pornography that could

1169
01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:04.600
lead to aggressive and violent behavior against women, or

1170
01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.370
is it more about the viewer and certain viewers

1171
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:10.330
may be more at risk of engaging in violent

1172
01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:13.489
behavior after watching whatever type of pornography. So it

1173
01:01:13.489 --> 01:01:16.520
is more about the latter. That it's less about

1174
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.760
the content in the pornography, even though there has

1175
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.439
been some links early on about exposure to violent

1176
01:01:22.439 --> 01:01:26.350
pornography can lead to some, at least attitudinal changes,

1177
01:01:26.639 --> 01:01:29.800
uh, short term in the viewer of being more

1178
01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.510
accepting against uh of uh aggression toward women, more

1179
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:35.580
accepting of like rape myths and things like that.

1180
01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:40.760
Um. But largely looking at the data, we have

1181
01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.600
to look at the individual and the individual watching

1182
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.520
it. So it's less about the porn and more

1183
01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.409
about who's watching it. And there has been one,

1184
01:01:48.479 --> 01:01:50.520
a couple of studies that looked at those who

1185
01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:54.320
are already at high risk of having recidivism, meaning

1186
01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.090
they, they've already committed a sex crime, and they're

1187
01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:58.989
at high risk, and there's a lot of factors

1188
01:01:58.989 --> 01:02:02.000
that go into being at high risk again. For

1189
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.989
offending for a 2nd, or 3rd, or a 4th

1190
01:02:03.989 --> 01:02:06.760
time, those individuals tend to be a little bit

1191
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.719
more susceptible to the effects, especially of violent watching

1192
01:02:09.719 --> 01:02:13.580
violent pornography, right? So that's a very, very different

1193
01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.679
conversation of like, all porn's bad because Men who

1194
01:02:17.679 --> 01:02:19.520
watch it are going to be aggressive and violent

1195
01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.399
toward women versus actually those who have already been

1196
01:02:22.399 --> 01:02:25.260
violent toward women and who have a high propensity

1197
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:28.080
to do it again. If they're watching violent porn,

1198
01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:30.300
that can make them a little bit more susceptible

1199
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.229
to being engaging in violence in real life. So

1200
01:02:33.229 --> 01:02:36.300
it goes from very broad to very, very narrow.

1201
01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.270
So unless you're on the sex offender registry already,

1202
01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.760
more than likely you don't have to worry about

1203
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.280
porn effects because there's so much that goes into

1204
01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.540
violence, um, that isn't. Um, I mean, part of

1205
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:52.500
the equation of watching pornography passively, right? It's characteristics

1206
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.300
that make one aggressive and violent with or without

1207
01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:58.179
pornography. Um, SO those are the, those are the

1208
01:02:58.179 --> 01:03:00.580
factors that are more of a driver, uh, for

1209
01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.540
violence against women than, uh, than pornography alone is.

1210
01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:07.229
You know, I always tend to be very skeptical

1211
01:03:07.229 --> 01:03:10.909
about these kinds of claims of porn causing sexual

1212
01:03:10.909 --> 01:03:13.790
violence and things like that, because I mean we

1213
01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:17.429
have a very long history of people making claims

1214
01:03:17.429 --> 01:03:21.669
about particular kinds of content causing violence, like violent

1215
01:03:21.669 --> 01:03:25.570
movies causing violence, violent video games causing violence, and

1216
01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:29.669
there's never any even correlation to find

1217
01:03:29.669 --> 01:03:33.580
there. Yeah, so, you know, like pornography gets scapegoated

1218
01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.379
a lot. It gets scapegoated for a lot of

1219
01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:41.550
social ills, relational ills, individual ills. Um AND the,

1220
01:03:41.679 --> 01:03:44.479
the belief and concern that it's leading to violence

1221
01:03:44.479 --> 01:03:47.439
is one of the oldest ones in pornography's history,

1222
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:49.639
at least modern pornography of like starting in the

1223
01:03:49.639 --> 01:03:52.830
70s and the 80s. Uh, BUT you're right, it's

1224
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:55.110
really no different than some of the moral panics

1225
01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:58.110
that have happened with heavy metal music, uh, with

1226
01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:00.860
Mortal Kombat in the 90s, right? So that was,

1227
01:04:01.189 --> 01:04:04.330
that was my era of Mortal Kombat and Doom

1228
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:07.270
and heavy metal music, all those things that were

1229
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:09.639
around me growing up and all parents that were

1230
01:04:09.639 --> 01:04:12.350
in political commentators were concerned of like, we're all

1231
01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:14.350
going to turn into like school shooters because of

1232
01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:17.229
this, and it's like, that's not the driving factor.

1233
01:04:17.389 --> 01:04:19.389
School shooters aren't bred out of a video game.

1234
01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:21.850
If that was the case, we would have a

1235
01:04:21.850 --> 01:04:24.969
lot more shootings than we actually do already. So

1236
01:04:24.969 --> 01:04:27.370
there has to be other factors at play that

1237
01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:29.629
actually have nothing to do with the media, uh,

1238
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:29.949
itself.

1239
01:04:31.239 --> 01:04:33.840
Yeah, I, I mean, even if I remember correctly,

1240
01:04:33.919 --> 01:04:38.489
even after the Columbine massacre, some people blamed Marilyn

1241
01:04:38.489 --> 01:04:41.360
Manson and his music for the violence there.

1242
01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.879
Yeah, and the, the, the ironic part was with

1243
01:04:43.879 --> 01:04:46.080
that was the, those shooters didn't even listen to

1244
01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.840
Marilyn Manson. They, they listened to music that was

1245
01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.310
similar, like Rammstein, KMFDM, but not Manson, but Manson

1246
01:04:52.310 --> 01:04:54.040
was the easy scapegoat at that time because he

1247
01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:57.320
was the most visible, especially in the US. Um,

1248
01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.600
SO yeah, there will always be scapegoats, uh, for

1249
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.520
the, for this kind of thing, and it is,

1250
01:05:01.639 --> 01:05:04.040
I, I think a lot right now that we

1251
01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.709
see with what has happened in the past that

1252
01:05:06.709 --> 01:05:09.750
we have labeled in hindsight as moral panics, right?

1253
01:05:09.959 --> 01:05:15.060
This kind of societal. Panic, anxious response to something

1254
01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:17.979
that we think is happening culturally, that's this phenomenon

1255
01:05:17.979 --> 01:05:20.260
that we need to like crack down on. Uh,

1256
01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:22.500
WE see a lot of that with pornography today

1257
01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:27.979
of like these very, very generalized hyperbolic claims of

1258
01:05:27.979 --> 01:05:31.500
porn effects, uh, that don't focus on nuance at

1259
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:34.459
all and just have these sweeping generalizations that all

1260
01:05:34.459 --> 01:05:37.739
porn is gonna cause these effects. And like, we

1261
01:05:37.739 --> 01:05:38.659
know that's not true.

1262
01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:45.449
So we talked about masturbation addiction earlier. What about

1263
01:05:45.449 --> 01:05:49.209
porn addiction? Because that's also something that we some

1264
01:05:49.209 --> 01:05:51.550
uh a type of claim that we hear from

1265
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:56.709
anti-porn feminists and other kinds of, for example, religiously

1266
01:05:56.709 --> 01:06:02.254
motivated people when they blame porn for this and

1267
01:06:02.254 --> 01:06:05.735
that kind of thing. Um, I mean, is there

1268
01:06:05.735 --> 01:06:08.975
such a thing, or, or is, or, or is

1269
01:06:08.975 --> 01:06:13.314
it, or is the problem again related to moral

1270
01:06:13.314 --> 01:06:14.475
incongruence?

1271
01:06:14.655 --> 01:06:16.774
Yeah, the, the latter. So everything that we talked

1272
01:06:16.774 --> 01:06:20.014
about with masturbation addiction applies to porn addiction, and

1273
01:06:20.014 --> 01:06:22.175
in fact, the research actually doesn't do a great

1274
01:06:22.175 --> 01:06:25.379
job of separating the two. They treat them as

1275
01:06:25.379 --> 01:06:28.610
the same because as as one researcher has pointed

1276
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:31.419
out, porn is for masturbation. It's actually very rare

1277
01:06:31.419 --> 01:06:32.699
for people just to kind of sit around and

1278
01:06:32.699 --> 01:06:36.709
watch pornography. And not use it for masturbation. That's

1279
01:06:36.709 --> 01:06:40.030
why we call it porn use, um, instead of

1280
01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:41.879
just porn watching, what are we using it for?

1281
01:06:41.989 --> 01:06:43.989
We're using it to masturbate, right? We don't use

1282
01:06:43.989 --> 01:06:46.310
that for other media either. We don't say Netflix

1283
01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:49.270
use, we say we're watching Netflix, not using Netflix.

1284
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:51.389
Uh, SO even the language that we have around

1285
01:06:51.389 --> 01:06:55.449
porn indicates that it implies that. It is for

1286
01:06:55.449 --> 01:06:58.570
masturbation, and it's, it's difficult to, to tease those

1287
01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:00.889
two apart. And that, that creates a problem with

1288
01:07:00.889 --> 01:07:02.929
the research because everything that we know about porn

1289
01:07:02.929 --> 01:07:06.129
addiction, is it really about porn or is it

1290
01:07:06.129 --> 01:07:08.570
just about masturbation? And some of the studies that

1291
01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:10.729
try to differentiate between the two have found that

1292
01:07:10.729 --> 01:07:13.570
masturbation is actually more of the ingredient that is

1293
01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:17.090
leading to some effects or non-effects than the porn

1294
01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:19.010
itself. And I certainly have seen that clinically, as

1295
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:22.500
I was mentioning. Uh, BEFORE that, for couples who

1296
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.540
are struggling with some type of one of their

1297
01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.060
porn use, we take porn out of the equation,

1298
01:07:27.139 --> 01:07:29.780
but they're still masturbating. Are the problems still there?

1299
01:07:30.139 --> 01:07:33.379
Yeah, they're still there, right? Um, SO yeah, the

1300
01:07:33.379 --> 01:07:36.219
mechanisms behind porn addiction are, are very, very slim,

1301
01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:38.209
similar to what we were talking about with masturbation

1302
01:07:38.209 --> 01:07:38.580
addiction.

1303
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:44.969
But clinically, I mean, from a clinical psychology perspective,

1304
01:07:45.209 --> 01:07:50.689
medically, is there anything that can be harmful about

1305
01:07:50.689 --> 01:07:55.989
watching porn, consuming porn, masturbating to porn, anything like

1306
01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:56.270
that?

1307
01:07:56.689 --> 01:07:59.850
Nothing that can be said definitively of like, absolutely

1308
01:07:59.850 --> 01:08:01.810
you watch this kind of porn, this is what's

1309
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:04.050
gonna happen to your brain, to your body, to

1310
01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:07.389
your behavior. There's no research to suggest that. The

1311
01:08:07.389 --> 01:08:09.989
best things that we have um would be like

1312
01:08:09.989 --> 01:08:12.949
correlational studies that show like just a relationship between

1313
01:08:12.949 --> 01:08:15.629
two variables, not necessarily cause effect. And this is

1314
01:08:15.629 --> 01:08:18.109
where that scientific literacy is so important because there

1315
01:08:18.109 --> 01:08:20.549
is one famous study that came out several years

1316
01:08:20.549 --> 01:08:25.549
ago in Germany. That uh looked at gray matter

1317
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:27.970
in the brain through brain imaging, I think it

1318
01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:31.930
was MRI specifically, um, and how that related, the

1319
01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:33.490
amount of gray matter in their brain and how

1320
01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:36.049
that related to the participants' porn use. And what

1321
01:08:36.049 --> 01:08:39.450
they found is that the more porn that the

1322
01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:42.770
participants consumed, the lower amount of gray matter that

1323
01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:45.890
they had, uh, as evidence from these uh these

1324
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:49.729
MRI scans. And of course, anti-porn people, anti-masturbation people

1325
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:52.729
run with that headline of like, porn causes brain

1326
01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:55.970
damage. Porn causes decrease of gray matter in the

1327
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:59.859
brain. It's like one, the study, the study's design,

1328
01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:03.140
the methodology, you can't conclude that it's not cause

1329
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.899
effect. We have a relationship between two variables and

1330
01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:09.339
a very interesting relationship, right? Um, AND that, yeah,

1331
01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:11.819
as one goes up, one goes down, but it

1332
01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:13.740
could be the opposite direction. It may not be

1333
01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:16.379
the porn causing the differences, right? If we could

1334
01:09:16.379 --> 01:09:18.979
test this in an experimental way where we could

1335
01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:24.669
more infer causality. It one possible uh scenario is

1336
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:28.830
that, yes, more porn causes decrease, decreases in gray

1337
01:09:28.830 --> 01:09:32.209
matter in the brain. Or it could be that

1338
01:09:32.549 --> 01:09:35.990
um decreases in gray matter in the brain lead

1339
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:39.629
to people watching more pornography. Maybe it's sensation seeking,

1340
01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:42.649
stimulation seeking, something like that, right? But it started

1341
01:09:42.649 --> 01:09:44.549
with the lower gray matters, it wasn't the porn

1342
01:09:44.549 --> 01:09:46.709
that caused it. Or often the case with these

1343
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:49.709
correlational studies, it's some 3rd variable or 4th variable,

1344
01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:52.189
5th variable. That's not even part of the, the

1345
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:55.950
study that wasn't uh examined or assessed, that's contributing

1346
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:58.740
to both the decreases in gray matter and the

1347
01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:04.290
increases. In, um, in pornography watching, right? And so

1348
01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:07.009
the two aren't actually directly related. There's no cause

1349
01:10:07.009 --> 01:10:09.589
effect between the two, it's something else causing both

1350
01:10:09.729 --> 01:10:13.049
in the individual, right? That one study, we don't

1351
01:10:13.049 --> 01:10:16.310
know, we cannot conclude the directionality of that relationship.

1352
01:10:16.649 --> 01:10:19.370
And furthermore, for just this as an example for

1353
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:21.129
this one study, because the study gets cited a

1354
01:10:21.129 --> 01:10:24.350
lot. Anytime you see porn use causes brain damage,

1355
01:10:24.649 --> 01:10:26.330
and they do have a citation, more than likely

1356
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:28.089
it's this study, so I like to dissect it

1357
01:10:28.089 --> 01:10:30.169
a lot. The other, the most important thing to

1358
01:10:30.169 --> 01:10:32.810
me, other than the directional problems that we can

1359
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:36.229
infer. IS that the study was done on 64

1360
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:38.520
men, which was a fine sample size, especially dealing

1361
01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.479
with like brain imaging, right? Those are pretty intensive

1362
01:10:41.479 --> 01:10:44.600
studies. But all 64 men in the study were

1363
01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.359
completely healthy. There were no functional impairments. There were

1364
01:10:47.359 --> 01:10:51.279
no observable cognitive impairments. There was no psychiatric disorders

1365
01:10:51.279 --> 01:10:54.339
present, anything like that. So, they were all healthy

1366
01:10:54.339 --> 01:10:56.959
men, regardless of the amount of porn that they

1367
01:10:56.959 --> 01:10:59.839
watched, even though they saw some differences in the

1368
01:10:59.839 --> 01:11:03.000
brain scans, right? Those brain scans did not lead

1369
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.759
to any type of functional or cognitive impairment, making

1370
01:11:05.759 --> 01:11:08.529
the brain scans kind of I don't want to

1371
01:11:08.529 --> 01:11:11.049
say inconsequential, but this is why you don't do

1372
01:11:11.049 --> 01:11:14.810
kind of fishing expeditions with, uh, body, uh, imaging,

1373
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:17.970
right, and scanning, because you may find these kind

1374
01:11:17.970 --> 01:11:23.330
of interesting things that are technically an anomaly, but

1375
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:25.609
there's no symptoms that go along with them, so

1376
01:11:25.609 --> 01:11:28.290
you can't make sense as to the pathology of

1377
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:30.879
it, right? And so even with the lower brain,

1378
01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:35.979
uh, gray matter, uh, brain volume. That has zero

1379
01:11:35.979 --> 01:11:38.899
impact on these guys' lives. So it's like, well,

1380
01:11:38.979 --> 01:11:41.100
what impact can we actually say that any of

1381
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.660
this is having, because this is 64 healthy men.

1382
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:50.180
Yeah, so what do you make then of anti-porn

1383
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:54.609
crusaders, uh, because, I mean, of course, I, I

1384
01:11:54.609 --> 01:11:58.569
could ask you to comment on the more moral

1385
01:11:58.569 --> 01:12:01.750
side of things, which is something that many times

1386
01:12:02.169 --> 01:12:07.410
anti-porn feminists, um, come up to the uh to

1387
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:10.649
the table with, I mean, with, uh, moral kinds

1388
01:12:10.649 --> 01:12:14.729
of arguments and then. We could get into a

1389
01:12:14.729 --> 01:12:18.330
conversation about the porn industry and things like that,

1390
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:20.520
but of course I don't imagine that you are

1391
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.930
an expert on that, and I'm not sure if

1392
01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:26.490
you're even interested in the more moral or political

1393
01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:30.609
side of pornography, but from the perspect the perspective

1394
01:12:30.609 --> 01:12:35.169
of a psychologist, what do you think of anti-porn

1395
01:12:35.169 --> 01:12:37.250
crusaders and their claims?

1396
01:12:38.649 --> 01:12:40.970
Well, from a therapeutic perspective, if, you know, a

1397
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:43.490
patient comes in saying that they're anti-porn, it's not

1398
01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:46.399
me to judge that or change their mind, right?

1399
01:12:46.569 --> 01:12:49.810
They're coming from it from whatever ideological perspective, like

1400
01:12:49.810 --> 01:12:52.330
that's their value system, right? And they have to

1401
01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:56.209
uh accept patient autonomy with that. Um, SO it's

1402
01:12:56.209 --> 01:12:58.009
more of an issue when it comes into the

1403
01:12:58.009 --> 01:13:00.290
political arena of like, oh, I feel this way

1404
01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:02.640
about porn, so therefore no one should watch it.

1405
01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:04.609
It should be illegal. There should be all these

1406
01:13:04.609 --> 01:13:07.069
restrictions placed on it because I believe it's bad,

1407
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:08.890
right? And that's when you can start pushing back,

1408
01:13:09.009 --> 01:13:10.879
be like, is it bad? What are you basing

1409
01:13:10.879 --> 01:13:14.089
that off? And will these restrictions actually reduce the

1410
01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:16.569
effects that you think this is having, right? Or

1411
01:13:16.569 --> 01:13:20.890
is this just more state involvement in media? Um,

1412
01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:22.930
AND is that a good thing, right, overall for

1413
01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:25.689
like for free speech issues, right? So there are

1414
01:13:25.689 --> 01:13:28.890
a lot of ideological issues that can come into

1415
01:13:28.890 --> 01:13:32.410
it, but also these ideological issues often rely on

1416
01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:35.890
scientific arguments to support their ideology, especially in the,

1417
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:37.529
in the realms of public policy, and that's when

1418
01:13:37.529 --> 01:13:40.700
you can kind of push back. So my belief

1419
01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.560
of it, kind of looking at the big picture

1420
01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.740
is kind of what we've kind of talked about

1421
01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:49.350
a little bit sometimes is, is. That being anti-porn

1422
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:53.229
is largely missing the point, and it's largely scapegoating

1423
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:55.990
something that actually has very little to do with

1424
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:59.790
or is, is a small piece of what you're

1425
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:03.129
actually concerned about. So if you're concerned about violence,

1426
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:06.709
right, and you put you're hyperfocused on pornography and

1427
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:08.470
you want to ban pornography because you think it

1428
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:11.470
leads to violence and just general violence, not violence

1429
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:15.140
necessarily only to women, um, but violence among like

1430
01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:21.939
men. Um, THAT it's just creating violent behavior. It's

1431
01:14:21.939 --> 01:14:24.379
like, well, is pornography the really the best thing

1432
01:14:24.379 --> 01:14:26.689
to go after, right? The top priority to go

1433
01:14:26.689 --> 01:14:28.839
after. There's a lot of other media that have

1434
01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:32.189
violent content in that that we can regularly consume

1435
01:14:32.189 --> 01:14:34.330
openly, and we don't have to secretly consume it.

1436
01:14:34.419 --> 01:14:35.700
Go onto YouTube and you can watch the most

1437
01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:40.140
violent videos imaginable. Real life violence, not situated, not

1438
01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:43.060
uh simulated, uh, even aggression within maybe like a

1439
01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:46.100
BDSM scene in porn, but we can live stream

1440
01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:48.609
essentially wars going on all over the world, right?

1441
01:14:48.979 --> 01:14:52.100
Is that more of a concern about having an

1442
01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:55.740
influence on violent behavior than pornography? Personally, that's just

1443
01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:58.629
my opinion, I think it should be, right? Um,

1444
01:14:58.669 --> 01:15:00.100
AND that's why I think like, so what is

1445
01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.229
it about porn actually that gets you so upset

1446
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:05.310
that you think this is the top priority to

1447
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:07.830
address your issue that you're so concerned about. And

1448
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:09.509
I think it really does come down to just

1449
01:15:09.509 --> 01:15:13.470
a discomfort with sex in general, a discomfort of

1450
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:17.870
seeing that so blatantly um displayed in pornography that

1451
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:20.589
it creates a lot of discomfort. I think, you

1452
01:15:20.589 --> 01:15:24.060
know, even if a casual person is pretty comfortable

1453
01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:26.109
with the idea of pornography, they may watch it

1454
01:15:26.109 --> 01:15:30.089
from time to time. But if pornography, you know,

1455
01:15:30.509 --> 01:15:33.229
was shown to them in an environment that they're

1456
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:35.229
not used to seeing it, it would be very

1457
01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:38.950
shocking and embarrassing and maybe possibly even shameful. They

1458
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:40.870
would feel guilty about it. It stirs up a

1459
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:43.790
lot of emotions because of the cultural taboos that

1460
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:46.790
many cultures have about sex in general and here's

1461
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:49.350
sex displayed on the screen, right? And then we

1462
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:51.350
start thinking about, well, this can't be healthy, right?

1463
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:53.339
I'm having this reaction to it, even though I

1464
01:15:53.339 --> 01:15:55.839
thought I myself was a sex positive person. This

1465
01:15:55.839 --> 01:15:58.649
is like too much, right? There's too much sex,

1466
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.680
um, because it's close-ups of genitals or I don't

1467
01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.399
like the position that they're in, that looks a

1468
01:16:03.399 --> 01:16:05.720
little too aggressive. Are they consenting to this? Let's

1469
01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.720
look at the, the workplace conditions, right? So then

1470
01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.540
it kind of gets into a workers' rights issue.

1471
01:16:09.879 --> 01:16:12.720
Um. But all these things can get stirred up

1472
01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.240
in the individual that they feel uncomfortable about, and

1473
01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.490
they project that onto the media, saying that the

1474
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:19.649
media is harmful, and other people are going to

1475
01:16:19.649 --> 01:16:22.169
be more harmed by it. If I'm feeling this

1476
01:16:22.169 --> 01:16:24.450
way, oh my goodness, what's a 19 year old

1477
01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:26.810
going to feel when they see this, right? That's

1478
01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:28.359
going to be detrimental. So it's a lot of

1479
01:16:28.359 --> 01:16:31.529
assumptions based on a projection of our own discomfort

1480
01:16:31.529 --> 01:16:36.129
with seeing explicit depictions of people fucking.

1481
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:39.470
OK, so, uh, I mean, I was going to

1482
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:41.919
ask you just one last question, but something else

1483
01:16:41.919 --> 01:16:44.680
came to my mind that I think it's also

1484
01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:48.560
interesting to address here, particularly because now, and I

1485
01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:51.879
don't want you to comment on, uh, the technological

1486
01:16:51.879 --> 01:16:54.560
side of things specifically, but now in the UK

1487
01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:58.600
for example, there are people pushing for laws to

1488
01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.220
try to. I mean that that basically forced people

1489
01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:06.339
to identify themselves online to try to reduce porn

1490
01:17:06.339 --> 01:17:10.419
consumption or the exposure, the exposure of children to

1491
01:17:10.419 --> 01:17:15.020
porn, yeah, the age verification and all of that,

1492
01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:20.560
but I mean just from purely a psychological perspective.

1493
01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:22.770
Uh, I know this is, this is going to

1494
01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:25.689
be a very controversial question, particularly, um, even more

1495
01:17:25.689 --> 01:17:32.569
so for conservative people, but are there negative psychological

1496
01:17:32.569 --> 01:17:39.930
effects of, uh, children and adolescents watching porn or

1497
01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:43.790
watching people having sex or anything like that?

1498
01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.680
Yeah, so the, the way the research can be

1499
01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:51.560
done ethically is that we can't have experimental studies

1500
01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.819
to, to, to look at cause effect, right? There's,

1501
01:17:54.879 --> 01:17:57.359
there's no institutional review board at any university that

1502
01:17:57.359 --> 01:17:59.430
is going to green light a study where you're

1503
01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:01.319
taking a bunch of 14 year olds into a

1504
01:18:01.319 --> 01:18:04.229
room, showing them pornography, and then measuring outcomes afterwards.

1505
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:06.060
That study is just not going to be approved.

1506
01:18:06.549 --> 01:18:08.359
Uh, SO at best, you have to rely on

1507
01:18:08.359 --> 01:18:11.640
correlational research, which can provide some, some information on

1508
01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.129
things, but again, we're just showing relationships between two

1509
01:18:14.129 --> 01:18:17.040
things, not necessarily a causal relationship, just two things

1510
01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.839
vary with one another. So, with that, um, some

1511
01:18:21.839 --> 01:18:24.640
of the research that I've seen is, um, You

1512
01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:28.879
know, they're, they're, from my perspective, and why I've

1513
01:18:28.879 --> 01:18:31.870
largely avoided correlational research in my own career, because

1514
01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:34.319
I don't like the problem of those third variables,

1515
01:18:34.439 --> 01:18:38.270
those unexplained third variables that could explain relationships, uh,

1516
01:18:38.319 --> 01:18:42.479
causal relationships, um, especially within media studies. Because when

1517
01:18:42.479 --> 01:18:44.479
you look at if there's any type of relationship

1518
01:18:44.479 --> 01:18:47.439
that's established between early exposure to pornography and some

1519
01:18:47.439 --> 01:18:51.439
type of negative outcome, health outcome, behavioral outcome, things

1520
01:18:51.439 --> 01:18:53.580
like that. Like, well, what else is going on,

1521
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:55.660
right? And a big one that often gets overlooked,

1522
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:57.629
it has been studied and controlled for in some

1523
01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:59.790
instances and has been pointed to as a key

1524
01:18:59.790 --> 01:19:05.770
factor is, uh, parental supervision, right? And so, those

1525
01:19:05.770 --> 01:19:09.870
with less parental supervision oftentimes have greater access to

1526
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:12.950
a whole host of different types of media. And

1527
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:15.229
media that's designed and made for adults and that

1528
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:19.330
they're going to be watching, um, anyways, and certain

1529
01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:23.270
negative health outcomes or behavioral outcomes. It's like, well,

1530
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:26.049
is it the media that's contributing to those outcomes

1531
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:28.910
or more so the lack of supervision that could

1532
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:32.169
be independently related to those outcomes as well, right?

1533
01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.910
Uh, SO there's, for me, the research is too

1534
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:39.310
muddy to make big conclusions, especially definitive conclusions of

1535
01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:41.819
like, Yeah, if you're 15 years old and you

1536
01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:44.220
come across a pornography link, and you click on

1537
01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.899
that link, this is what to expect, uh, to

1538
01:19:46.899 --> 01:19:49.410
your health, to your behavior, to your psychological well-being.

1539
01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.180
There's no research that can answer that definitively.

1540
01:19:53.439 --> 01:19:57.319
OK, so I have one last question then, uh,

1541
01:19:57.709 --> 01:20:01.259
because this is something that you, uh, talk about

1542
01:20:01.399 --> 01:20:04.149
at the very end of your book. Who are

1543
01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:09.600
the sex educators and the moderates fighting back against

1544
01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:13.319
the anti-masturbation crusaders? And I mean, why do you

1545
01:20:13.319 --> 01:20:18.120
think it's impo uh sex education is important when

1546
01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:23.350
it comes to how people deal with. Uh, MASTURBATION

1547
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.939
and things like that.

1548
01:20:25.209 --> 01:20:27.250
Yeah, so I'd say this is definitely within our

1549
01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:30.729
domain, right? So any type of mental health provider,

1550
01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:35.490
psychologists, social workers, counselors, therapists who specialize in sexual

1551
01:20:35.490 --> 01:20:38.529
health, sexual behavior, sexual disorders, this is definitely within

1552
01:20:38.529 --> 01:20:40.770
our domain. We're the experts in this. We're the

1553
01:20:40.770 --> 01:20:43.870
most comfortable with this behavior. We have the less.

1554
01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:49.020
We're least, least likely to have a lot of

1555
01:20:49.479 --> 01:20:52.160
negative feelings come up when talking about sex that

1556
01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.680
could be projected in a way that's kind of

1557
01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:58.600
hyperbolic or overgeneralizing to, to things and engaging in

1558
01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:01.279
scare tactics. Doesn't say it doesn't happen even within

1559
01:21:01.279 --> 01:21:03.759
our own field. It's just, it's, we have more

1560
01:21:03.759 --> 01:21:06.359
training that's less likely to happen. Uh, SO this

1561
01:21:06.359 --> 01:21:08.990
is definitely within our wheelhouse to address, um, and

1562
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:11.479
I think we should be addressing it because there's

1563
01:21:11.479 --> 01:21:15.120
a lot of misinformation. Out there. And it's like

1564
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:20.129
uh trying to use, um, you know, like a,

1565
01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:23.250
a leaf blower against the tsunami. Uh, YOU'RE not

1566
01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:25.430
going to stop that wave, uh, from coming in.

1567
01:21:25.810 --> 01:21:27.790
Um, BUT the best we can do is try

1568
01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:30.689
to be consistent enough in our messaging that maybe

1569
01:21:30.689 --> 01:21:34.870
somebody somewhere will hear it and understand like, OK,

1570
01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:37.930
what messaging should I actually believe on this? The

1571
01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:40.790
one that's coming from those with expertise in this

1572
01:21:41.089 --> 01:21:45.129
or some random A person with a podcast who's

1573
01:21:45.129 --> 01:21:48.930
spouting nonsense and selling supplements and who promises if

1574
01:21:48.930 --> 01:21:53.410
you masturbate less, um, you're going to gain 500%

1575
01:21:53.410 --> 01:21:56.729
in your testosterone. It's like, hopefully, intuitively, that does

1576
01:21:56.729 --> 01:21:58.410
not make sense that that would be the case.

1577
01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:01.729
Obviously, they have uh ulterior motive to sell their

1578
01:22:01.729 --> 01:22:04.859
motivate uh sell their supplements, sell their motivation coaching

1579
01:22:04.859 --> 01:22:07.009
sessions, things like that. So maybe we need to

1580
01:22:07.009 --> 01:22:09.220
start looking for more credible sources of where we

1581
01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:11.609
get our information as it relates to, to masturbation.

1582
01:22:12.129 --> 01:22:16.430
So there's been a lot of these uh pro-masturbation.

1583
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:21.390
Um, uh, CRUSADERS and proponents uh throughout history. Uh,

1584
01:22:21.399 --> 01:22:23.240
ONE of the biggest ones from the 70s was

1585
01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.939
uh Betty Dodson. Uh, SHE was just an educator.

1586
01:22:26.339 --> 01:22:28.990
Um, BUT the more recent ones too, I always

1587
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:31.189
like to point to is Dr. David Lay. He's

1588
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:35.430
a psychologist, and, um, Dr. Nicole Prauss, I believe

1589
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:37.069
she's a neuroscientist, and they,

1590
01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:39.200
I, I've, I've have her on my show.

1591
01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:41.669
Oh, great. Yeah, yeah, both of them have done

1592
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:43.950
great work in this area of pushing back against

1593
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:46.270
misinformation and pushing back against a lot of the

1594
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:49.029
claims of no fat semen retentionists and things like

1595
01:22:49.029 --> 01:22:51.750
that, and they have the experience and the publications

1596
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:52.490
to back it up.

1597
01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:58.140
Mhm. Great. So the book is again, DIY, The

1598
01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:02.459
Wonderfully Weird History and Science of Masturbation. I'm leaving

1599
01:23:02.459 --> 01:23:04.620
a link to it in the description of the

1600
01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:07.899
interview. Uh, AND Doctor Sprankel, just before we go,

1601
01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:10.180
apart from the book, would you like to tell

1602
