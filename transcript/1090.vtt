00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:03.269
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.159
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.159 --> 00:00:09.020
today I'm here with a return guest, Doctor Daniel

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.199
Conroy Beam is associate professor of psychology in the

5
00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.869
Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University

6
00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.420
of California. Santa Barbara. And today, we're going to

7
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.209
talk about the manosphere and how people they misuse

8
00:00:24.209 --> 00:00:28.020
research in evolutionary psychology. And by the way, I'm

9
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.540
also leaving a link in the description to my

10
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.099
first interview with Doctor Conroybin. So, Doctor Conroybin, welcome

11
00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:36.860
back to the show. It's always a pleasure to

12
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.500
have you on.

13
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.979
All right, thank you so much for having me

14
00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:40.220
back. I'm excited to talk.

15
00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:44.250
So, first of all, uh, and I mean, as

16
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.729
a way of introducing the topic for people who

17
00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.529
might not be familiar with it, uh, even though

18
00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:52.490
I think that at least people who spend some

19
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.849
time on the internet and social media should at

20
00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:59.529
least come across the word manosphere, at least that,

21
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.500
but what is the manosphere exactly?

22
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.500
Yeah, good, good question, and it's a hard question.

23
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.900
I, I, I've been thinking about how to answer

24
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.900
this. Uh, I'm not sure there is a good

25
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.339
short answer. Uh, I mean, the best I could

26
00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:20.010
say it's a nebulous, uh, loose collection of different

27
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.699
online communities, as well as the influencers and media

28
00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:29.099
that cater to them. Uh, MAYBE. There probably is

29
00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:31.860
no like one single uniting thing, but the the

30
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.419
closest you can get to uniting thing is uh

31
00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:38.940
sort of concern with men's issues uh in society

32
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.419
at large today. Uh, THERE'S a heavy influence in

33
00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:44.660
a lot of corners in the manosphere, heavy focus

34
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.889
on issues of like dating and relationships, that's probably

35
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.339
uh the biggest uh concern that unites a lot

36
00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:57.099
of manosphere communities and manosphere influencers. But also concerns

37
00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.410
about sort of like social justice, but uh with

38
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.819
uh inequalities towards men. Uh, SO this includes things

39
00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.099
like, you know, men's rights advocates who are concerned

40
00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.020
about like sort of legal and social perceived legal

41
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.089
and social inequalities that men experience in in modern

42
00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:15.630
society. ALL the way to like, you know, pick

43
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.949
up artists who are mainly concerned with, like, just,

44
00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.149
you know, dating advice, how to, like, hack uh

45
00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.429
psychology to have more success in dating and relationships,

46
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.029
maybe not even relationships, maybe just dating. And then

47
00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:28.710
of course like the extreme end on the other

48
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.990
side are our incels who are like primarily concerned

49
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.509
with uh, you know, their own personal lack of

50
00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:39.699
success in the dating realm, and so. And you

51
00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:41.690
know, as well as all the influencers that can

52
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.419
catered these people, so like the big names are,

53
00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:45.770
you know, probably people you've heard of, you're like

54
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.279
Andrew Tate's, you're fresh and fits, you know, maybe

55
00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:51.279
as far as like your Jordan Peterson's, maybe even.

56
00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:57.160
Uh, TOUCHING, bordering upon your like Joe Rogan's even,

57
00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.490
you know.

58
00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:03.339
So it's basically a large collection of people that

59
00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:07.190
includes, I mean, pickup artists, the red pill community,

60
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.179
the black pill community, uh some of the insult

61
00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.169
community, and I mean, basically people like that,

62
00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.979
right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, those I, I would characterize

63
00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:19.979
as being, yeah, all big parts of the the

64
00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.339
manosphere community. Mhm.

65
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.429
So, I mean, uh, the main reason why I

66
00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:27.309
invited you on the show to talk about the

67
00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.740
manosphere, because, I mean, I could have invited other

68
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.070
people to talk about the same topic, is because

69
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.410
at a certain point, and you're going to tell

70
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.285
us about that, you found About that your own

71
00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:43.845
research was being misused by people from the manosphere.

72
00:03:43.895 --> 00:03:46.854
So tell us about that. How did you learn

73
00:03:46.854 --> 00:03:50.414
about it and what kinds of, what, or what

74
00:03:50.414 --> 00:03:54.085
parts of your research were, were being misused by

75
00:03:54.085 --> 00:03:56.455
them? I mean, tell us all about it.

76
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.080
Yeah, no, I mean, I, so I want to

77
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.279
be clear, and it's, you know, I appreciate, yeah,

78
00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:04.550
there are other people you could. So I want

79
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.119
to be clear, like, I'm not an expert on

80
00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:09.520
the manosphere, right? I'm not a sociologist, I'm not

81
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.919
a historian, right? I don't want to claim that

82
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.800
I have like special insight into like the workings

83
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.170
or the history of the manosphere or these kinds

84
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.298
of like social communities. You know, when I am,

85
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.359
I'm an expert in human mating, right, the psychology

86
00:04:22.359 --> 00:04:24.579
of human mating. That's where my work is, that's

87
00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:26.100
what I focus on, that's what I, you know,

88
00:04:26.179 --> 00:04:28.220
think about day to day, uh, you know, the

89
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.890
manosphere, you know, being in this sphere, of course,

90
00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:35.179
in the mating sphere, right? Like, of course, I

91
00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:37.660
was vaguely aware of the manosphere for a long

92
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.369
time. It's, you know, these things come up, right?

93
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.019
Uh, SO I, I sort of like knew it

94
00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:47.820
was out there, um. You know, students would talk

95
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.190
to you, they discover like, oh, you study human

96
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.149
mating, like, what do you think about this like

97
00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:55.630
pickup artist YouTube, YouTuber that I watch or something

98
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.359
like that, they would like ask you your opinions

99
00:04:57.359 --> 00:05:00.440
on these things or, you know, Jeffrey Miller. You

100
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.049
know, he wrote that book, was it called Date,

101
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.399
I think, um, which was supposed to be like

102
00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:08.470
a sort of more scientifically informed pickup artistry book.

103
00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:09.480
I think that came out when I was in

104
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.320
grad school, you know, I'm a fan of like

105
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.959
a YouTube video essay too. I'll often throw something

106
00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:16.410
up when I'm working, you know, I'm a big

107
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.160
fan of like FT S signifier, who talks about

108
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.850
a lot of these things, you know, I've seen

109
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.839
some of like your interviews on these things. So

110
00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.100
it was like I was like aware of it,

111
00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:24.359
but I always sort of kept it at an

112
00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:25.959
arm's length because I was just like this is

113
00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:31.160
just a unserious, uninteresting, kind of gross question, if

114
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.200
I'm being honest, uh of online communities, and, you

115
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.799
know, I'm interested in the science, so I just

116
00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:38.399
sort of ignored it. Um, I, I wasn't like

117
00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:42.059
really forced to like confront it and yeah, see,

118
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.200
see my connection to it, uh, until it was

119
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.160
actually one of your prior guests, so, uh, Louis

120
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.600
Louis Baho, we've had on the podcast before, so

121
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.720
this was maybe. Two years ago now or something

122
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.920
like that, uh, Louis actually came out to Santa

123
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.880
Barbara to visit. So Louis, uh, Louis is like

124
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.519
a sociologist by trading, um, uh, and, um, he

125
00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:08.640
was doing his PhD on connections between evolutionary psychology

126
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.440
and the manosphere. Uh, SO he came out to

127
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.239
Santa Barbara, he spent like, I think like a

128
00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:13.880
month with us, you know, hanging around my lab

129
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.750
meeting, hanging around the, the Center for Evolutionary Psychology,

130
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.839
and he gave us a talk on his work

131
00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:21.239
on, you know, ways in which evolutionary psychology gets

132
00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:23.760
used in the manosphere. Um, AND I, I just,

133
00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:27.059
I remember like sitting in the Center for Evolutionary

134
00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:30.040
Psychology lab space, like listening to Louis talk, and

135
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.799
he's like, yeah, you know, um, the intel community,

136
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.070
they maintain this Wikipedia page, you know, called the

137
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.760
scientific Black Pill, that's just a giant, you know,

138
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.239
basically annotated bibliography of, you know, peer reviewed research

139
00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:47.359
papers that they claim support their worldview and like

140
00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:49.119
a lot of your guys' work is in here.

141
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.989
Uh, AND he, you know, we just like pulled

142
00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:54.200
it up, uh, and we're just like searching for,

143
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.470
you know, our names and people's names that we

144
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.910
knew. And yeah, I just, I remember the like

145
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.429
feeling of like vertigo, like seeing, you know, my

146
00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:06.140
papers and my friends' papers being cited in this

147
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.589
like, you know, annotated bibliography of like misogyny as

148
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:15.660
like, uh, you know, supporting these these ideologies that

149
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.989
I didn't think my work supported. I still don't

150
00:07:17.989 --> 00:07:19.980
think my work supported. Uh, SO that was really

151
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.250
my, my like inroad into this. I like I

152
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.019
owe a debt to Louis, uh, to opening my

153
00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:26.980
eyes to this, and, you know, I just been

154
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.660
sort of grappling since then with like, yeah, how

155
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.459
do I, how do you move forward, right? How

156
00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:36.510
do you make sense of like, You know, why

157
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.200
is our work getting used in this way and,

158
00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:39.959
and what does that mean like for us as

159
00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:40.760
scientists?

160
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:46.510
OK, but when it comes to your own research,

161
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.709
what kinds of claims were people from the Venosphere

162
00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:54.190
making based on it? And, and I mean, in,

163
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:59.309
in what ways were those claims misrepresenting your

164
00:07:59.309 --> 00:08:01.470
research? Yeah, so I mean, like to give a

165
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.649
specific example, uh, so, you know, I wrote this,

166
00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:06.429
this, this op ed about this, uh, which is

167
00:08:06.429 --> 00:08:09.070
also part of how I've gotten uh roped into

168
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.549
this, this, uh, conversation. Um, uh, OR this, you

169
00:08:12.549 --> 00:08:15.149
know, this whole broader conversation, um, but, you know,

170
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.970
one specific example. Um, WAS, uh, it was a

171
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.850
paper of mine that was cited in this scientific

172
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.640
black pill is like Wikipedia page of, uh, of,

173
00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:29.769
of, of peer reviewed articles that support sort of

174
00:08:29.769 --> 00:08:33.849
like Incel worldviews. Um, I, I, I'm forgetting a

175
00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:35.530
little bit the details of how it was cited.

176
00:08:35.609 --> 00:08:37.409
I mean, it was a paper on sex differences

177
00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:40.739
and mate preferences that I had published. Um, uh,

178
00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.679
AND they, they cited it as evidence that like

179
00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:47.719
women prefer dominant partners, uh, women who prefer dominant

180
00:08:47.719 --> 00:08:51.520
men as partners. Um, uh, AND it was interesting

181
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.640
because they had quoted, uh, like a colleague of

182
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.919
mine, uh, who was a co-author on that paper,

183
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.640
as I recall, as describing the paper as having

184
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.119
found that, having found that women prefer dominant men

185
00:09:04.119 --> 00:09:06.679
as partners. Um, AND this was supposed to, you

186
00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.590
know, support the idea that like, you know, women

187
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.070
are always looking to trade up from, you know,

188
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.390
the low status loser to some like high status

189
00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.510
losers. You can't trust women to be faithful to

190
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.510
you long term because they're always gonna dump you

191
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.570
for some higher status dominant alpha. Right, this is

192
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.979
the, the interpretation that they drew out of my

193
00:09:23.979 --> 00:09:26.770
paper. But I mean, the, the crazy thing was,

194
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.219
you know, I like, I looked at that and

195
00:09:28.219 --> 00:09:30.820
I was like, I don't remember us having a

196
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.580
measure of preference for dominance in that paper, right?

197
00:09:33.659 --> 00:09:36.460
Like, I'm pretty sure I don't generally ask that.

198
00:09:36.789 --> 00:09:38.289
You know, it was an older paper for me

199
00:09:38.289 --> 00:09:39.890
at that time, so maybe I just forgot what

200
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.369
measures we had in that paper, but yeah, I

201
00:09:41.369 --> 00:09:43.330
went back to the paper. We did not ask

202
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.650
about preferences for dominance in that paper, right? That

203
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.210
paper had no evidence of uh any sex difference

204
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.049
in preference for dominance. I mean, I, I'm, I

205
00:09:53.369 --> 00:09:56.369
believe such a preference, such a difference has been

206
00:09:56.369 --> 00:09:58.390
found before, but that was not in our paper,

207
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:03.000
um, and even, you know, people have like Uh,

208
00:10:03.099 --> 00:10:05.900
defended that quote that that citation because it was,

209
00:10:05.979 --> 00:10:08.140
it's actually a colleague who quoted the paper saying

210
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.380
that and the the Intel wiki was just uh

211
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.010
the scientific black but was just quoting the colleague.

212
00:10:13.419 --> 00:10:16.150
But even if you go to the colleague's quotation,

213
00:10:16.299 --> 00:10:17.539
right, if you go to the paper that they're

214
00:10:17.539 --> 00:10:20.880
quoting from, um, you know, my colleague is saying

215
00:10:21.359 --> 00:10:23.640
They aren't saying that this paper, they aren't saying

216
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.789
that women have a preference for, right? Like, uh,

217
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.309
the section that they quoted was from the discussion

218
00:10:30.309 --> 00:10:33.289
section of that paper, uh, where they were considering

219
00:10:33.289 --> 00:10:36.260
alternative explanations to what they were actually talking about

220
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.159
in that paper. So they were saying, you know,

221
00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:40.520
you might argue, for example, that women have a

222
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.400
preference for dominance, but the very next sentence was

223
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.960
them arguing against that idea, right? So even, even

224
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:51.010
the quotation that they chose, like, That quote was

225
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.090
referring to evidence that didn't exist, uh, but even

226
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.450
like even that quote, like, the researchers were not

227
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.010
arguing for what they cherry picked out of that

228
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.090
sentence, they were actually arguing the opposite, and that

229
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.969
was just like a sort of devil's advocate kind

230
00:11:03.969 --> 00:11:05.530
of like, even if you thought this were true,

231
00:11:05.609 --> 00:11:08.130
here's some alternative evidence. Uh, SO it's just like

232
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.330
a, it was a a crazy, uh, like, uh

233
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:18.390
just uh uh. Weird like game of telephone where

234
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:23.830
like my paper morphed into like this claim that

235
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.070
was never found in the paper like that morphed

236
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:30.619
into this like counterpoint that was like cherry picked

237
00:11:30.619 --> 00:11:33.309
selectively out of the discussion section. Uh, SO, you

238
00:11:33.309 --> 00:11:34.789
know, if you didn't know these things, if you

239
00:11:34.789 --> 00:11:36.909
didn't know the literature, if you're just like a

240
00:11:36.909 --> 00:11:39.880
curious frustrated young guy. This is gonna look to

241
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.119
you like, oh, this is a like a great

242
00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:45.229
resource. Here's all of these like scientific papers with

243
00:11:45.229 --> 00:11:48.679
direct quotations that like back up this worldview that

244
00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:51.320
seems really coherent and really interesting, but you just

245
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.039
like scratch the surface a little bit and you

246
00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:55.000
see like, at least in my case, right, like

247
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.200
this is, there's no connection between what the black

248
00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.640
bill said about the work and what the work

249
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.599
was actually saying.

250
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:05.760
Yeah, by the way, what was the paper about

251
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:06.440
exactly?

252
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.289
The original paper?

253
00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:09.489
Yes,

254
00:12:09.809 --> 00:12:12.440
um, I don't even recall which one was it,

255
00:12:12.609 --> 00:12:17.710
um. I think this was a paper on uh

256
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.030
using like multivariate approaches to look at sex differences

257
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:25.549
and make preferences. So, you know. There was um

258
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.929
some argument. Essentially, you know, sex differences and mate

259
00:12:29.929 --> 00:12:31.729
preferences have been of interest for a long time

260
00:12:31.729 --> 00:12:34.559
because there are, you know, relevant theoretical questions there.

261
00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:39.210
Um, AND most people, when they look at mate

262
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.090
preferences, people have a lot of preferences. This is

263
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.609
something that I think the intels also overlook, right?

264
00:12:44.619 --> 00:12:46.090
If you ask people what they're looking for in

265
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.130
a partner. They say a lot of things, right?

266
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.119
They say they want somebody who's kind and intelligent

267
00:12:51.119 --> 00:12:54.099
and attractive and, you know, funny, and, you know,

268
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.500
shares my, you know, religious worldview and etc. ETC.

269
00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.169
They, they generally won't stop talking until you stop

270
00:13:00.169 --> 00:13:03.049
them from talking. Um, BUT when we consider, you

271
00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:05.169
know, sex differences and make preferences, we often just

272
00:13:05.169 --> 00:13:07.010
pick one of those at a time, look at

273
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.169
the difference on that dimension, write it down, move

274
00:13:09.169 --> 00:13:10.530
on to the next one, move on to the

275
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.890
next one. THIS was like sort of the start

276
00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.809
of what became like a cornerstone of my research

277
00:13:15.809 --> 00:13:18.979
area, which is like Make choices highly multivariate, right?

278
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.349
Like we're looking for lots of things, uh, we're

279
00:13:21.349 --> 00:13:23.270
trying to satisfy lots of preferences at the same

280
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.059
time, uh, and so we shouldn't look at life

281
00:13:26.059 --> 00:13:28.429
one dimension at a time, we should consider all

282
00:13:28.429 --> 00:13:30.669
of these things collectively and, you know, how big

283
00:13:30.669 --> 00:13:33.270
are the differences across all of these dimensions. So

284
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.669
that was part of why it was like, Again,

285
00:13:35.789 --> 00:13:39.030
so jarring to see them sort of like laser

286
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.830
focus on my paper, you know, laser focus on

287
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.390
like sex differences and dominance, because very few of

288
00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.270
my papers are ever about like we should emphasize

289
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.070
this one difference a lot, right? Most of my

290
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.429
papers are like, you know, what is the bigger

291
00:13:51.429 --> 00:13:53.349
picture, right? How do we not lose the forest

292
00:13:53.349 --> 00:13:56.030
for the trees? Uh, SO, uh, yeah, I did

293
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.500
not remember emphasizing a sex difference and dominance per

294
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.750
se, uh, and it's cause I didn't. Mhm.

295
00:14:01.929 --> 00:14:05.609
And do you know if uh this kind of

296
00:14:05.609 --> 00:14:10.890
phenomenon of people in the menosphere misusing, uh, research

297
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:15.250
in evolutionary psychology is a more generalized thing? I

298
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.669
mean, is that something that they do frequently or

299
00:14:19.669 --> 00:14:23.419
not? Yeah, yeah, I mean, I, I think, you

300
00:14:23.419 --> 00:14:26.609
know, uh, I would encourage all of my colleagues,

301
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.340
all of my colleagues in evolutionary psychology to like

302
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:34.900
peruse the scientific black pill. It's uh uncomfortable, but

303
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.570
eye opening experience to see, you know, how our

304
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.780
work gets interpreted sort of one step out. I

305
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.739
think there's a lot of ideas that start in

306
00:14:44.739 --> 00:14:48.179
evolutionary psychology and make it into these manosphere circles,

307
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.210
but they They just something's getting lost in translation,

308
00:14:52.289 --> 00:14:55.250
right? They're getting distorted uh in ways that, you

309
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.169
know, in some cases some people might agree with,

310
00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.780
I don't know. But I think in many cases,

311
00:14:59.789 --> 00:15:03.940
probably not. Um, YOU know, I know, uh, uh,

312
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.549
I'm a little hazy on the details now, but

313
00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:08.020
I remember uh there was another like in that

314
00:15:08.049 --> 00:15:10.710
that same talk where Louis was like showing this

315
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.190
to us, uh, he had a specific example of

316
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.789
uh my colleague Patrick Durkey. They had cited some

317
00:15:15.789 --> 00:15:18.890
work of of Patrick's as making some claim about

318
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.780
like, Dating and and mating advice or something like

319
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.700
that. But the crazy thing is Patrick doesn't study

320
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.260
mating, right? Patrick studies status and personality, right? It

321
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.739
was again like the claim that they were making

322
00:15:30.739 --> 00:15:34.859
on Patrick's work, I know, is not something that

323
00:15:34.859 --> 00:15:37.419
Patrick studies, is not something that Patrick is interested

324
00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:40.010
in. It was just like. They do this kind

325
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.030
of like really superficial sort of like keyword search

326
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.489
and like any sort of like word that you

327
00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:49.890
can interpret as being connected to what the argument

328
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.690
they want to make, uh, like they just grab

329
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.690
that, they cherry pick the the citation, they cherry

330
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.390
pick, you know, the quotation if it's useful, uh,

331
00:15:58.409 --> 00:16:00.450
and it, you know, it ends up looking like.

332
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.780
This exhaustive, uh, uh, you know, resource base, um,

333
00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:09.369
but it's, it's all pretty selective, it's all pretty,

334
00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:13.859
uh, embellished, you know, it doesn't. Doesn't, you know,

335
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.140
connect with the real back and forth that's happening

336
00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.539
in these actual literatures. Uh, IT'S, you know, I,

337
00:16:19.619 --> 00:16:23.780
I think like incels, you know, uh, Louis, you

338
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.820
know, had, uh, I was actually just reading his

339
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.700
dissertation recently and he had uh he had this

340
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.169
like meme, this is like manosphere meme. Uh, THAT

341
00:16:32.169 --> 00:16:34.049
he quoted in it, it was like, you know,

342
00:16:34.289 --> 00:16:36.289
on the one hand, scientists are like, you know,

343
00:16:36.409 --> 00:16:38.520
here's the evidence, what conclusions can we draw from

344
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.570
this? And on the other hand, it was like

345
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.609
feminists and what feminists do you like, here's the

346
00:16:41.609 --> 00:16:43.719
conclusion, what facts can we find to support it,

347
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.650
and it's ironic cause like that's exactly what they're

348
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.520
doing, right? Like, they have a worldview that they

349
00:16:48.729 --> 00:16:50.219
that they believe in and they want to support,

350
00:16:50.229 --> 00:16:53.049
and they're just, you know, trolling through the literature

351
00:16:53.049 --> 00:16:56.210
to find anything that could be loosely interpreted as

352
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.650
supporting that worldview and ignoring everything else and just

353
00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.299
like extracting. Uh, A long list of things that

354
00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:03.500
they could use as like easy talking points to

355
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.189
like Gish gallop, uh, people in debates over their

356
00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:10.180
worldview. um. You know, to give another like concrete

357
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:15.050
example, uh, you know, one idea, one scientific idea

358
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.699
that looms really large in manosphere circles, uh, is

359
00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:22.790
the dual mating strategy hypothesis, right? So this is,

360
00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:26.689
this is a hypothesis that genuinely was very popular

361
00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:30.739
in evolutionary psychology, genuinely was like the scientific state

362
00:17:30.739 --> 00:17:34.680
of the art in like 2010, right? Like, uh,

363
00:17:34.739 --> 00:17:37.459
and this is, you know, the idea that Uh,

364
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.939
you know, there are shifts in women's mating psychology

365
00:17:41.189 --> 00:17:43.069
over the course of the menstrual cycle, you know,

366
00:17:43.349 --> 00:17:46.739
specifically, you know, around ovulation near the fertile window,

367
00:17:46.949 --> 00:17:49.270
but the exact details of this have changed over

368
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.420
time as the science has progressed, but, you know,

369
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.430
at least part of the original idea was like

370
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.150
there's this increased interest in, you know, short term

371
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.510
mating, especially with like attractive, dominant men, uh, as

372
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.829
a means of pursuing this dual mating strategy where

373
00:18:01.829 --> 00:18:05.150
you get sort of like, uh uh you sort

374
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:09.640
of Conceive offspring with partners who have, you know,

375
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.520
good genes or indicators of good genes, uh, but

376
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.959
then you potentially pursue investment for those offspring, uh,

377
00:18:15.979 --> 00:18:17.920
for men who don't necessarily have those markers for

378
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.959
men who are, you know, better long term partners,

379
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.229
uh, more cooperative, you know, good provider kind of

380
00:18:24.439 --> 00:18:28.810
partners, um. This was a really popular idea in

381
00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:33.119
2010, um, and it's still, you know, has its

382
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.290
supporters, although the idea has like progressed and matured

383
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.489
a lot over that time, right? The, the versions

384
00:18:40.489 --> 00:18:43.489
of the dual mating strategy hypothesis that exist in

385
00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:46.489
the scientific literature today do not look very much

386
00:18:46.489 --> 00:18:48.890
like the versions that get discussed in the manosphere

387
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.170
today, right? So the manosphere has taken this as

388
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.920
like, you know, women are sort of like untrustworthy.

389
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:59.089
Uh, LIKE, you know, uh, all they wanna do

390
00:18:59.089 --> 00:19:03.099
is just like, Have sex with chads, uh, and

391
00:19:03.099 --> 00:19:07.260
then, you know, dupe losers into supporting the children

392
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.619
that they produce with these like genetically superior alpha

393
00:19:10.619 --> 00:19:14.219
males, right? Uh AND science supports that, uh, but

394
00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:15.939
like, you know, the versions of the dual mating

395
00:19:15.939 --> 00:19:19.250
strategy hypothesis that exists today are much more subtle,

396
00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.300
much more sophisticated, you know, uh, have much more

397
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:29.140
like, you know, conditional, uh, caveats and, uh, even

398
00:19:29.709 --> 00:19:32.229
Like within the field too, like, I think the

399
00:19:32.229 --> 00:19:35.030
popularity of the dual mating strategy hypothesis has waned

400
00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.790
a lot, right? There are prominent competitors, prominent alternative

401
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.349
explanations that now I would say on average are

402
00:19:41.349 --> 00:19:44.550
more popular, right? So my colleague Jim Roy has

403
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.150
been arguing from day one, the dual mating strategy

404
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.869
hypothesis is wrong, uh, that women don't have this

405
00:19:49.869 --> 00:19:52.910
dual mating strategy, uh, that what, what shifts we

406
00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.739
do see across the menstrual cycle are mostly byproducts

407
00:19:55.739 --> 00:19:59.155
of adaptations that are designed to calibrate. Behavior across

408
00:19:59.155 --> 00:20:02.435
different menstrual cycles. It's like there's really, really prominent

409
00:20:02.435 --> 00:20:05.875
disagreement about this hypothesis within the scientific literature that

410
00:20:05.875 --> 00:20:09.515
is absent from manosphere discussions of the science, right?

411
00:20:09.594 --> 00:20:11.515
They do not know. I mean, good for my

412
00:20:11.515 --> 00:20:14.114
colleague Jim, they don't know who he is. They

413
00:20:14.114 --> 00:20:16.114
don't know his ideas. He lives a happier life

414
00:20:16.114 --> 00:20:18.714
than I do. Uh, BUT like they're not discussing,

415
00:20:18.915 --> 00:20:21.714
you know, the scientific debate that's emerging because they

416
00:20:21.714 --> 00:20:23.035
don't care about the debate, they don't care about

417
00:20:23.035 --> 00:20:24.594
the evidence, they just want to cherry pick the

418
00:20:24.594 --> 00:20:26.954
stuff that supports their worldview. And they're also not

419
00:20:26.954 --> 00:20:29.770
discussing. You know, the advances, even on the dual

420
00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.130
mating strategy side, they're not discussing the advances and

421
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.560
the subtleties that that like that side is offered,

422
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.449
they're just like frozen in this like, you know,

423
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.930
superficial interpretation of this like 2010 version of this

424
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.219
hypothesis because, you know, that's what sports are willing

425
00:20:43.219 --> 00:20:43.930
to do, that's all they need.

426
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.170
So, you've already given us a specific example there,

427
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.729
but are there other examples among the claims you

428
00:20:52.729 --> 00:20:56.599
came across over time that you think are, uh,

429
00:20:56.619 --> 00:20:58.650
I, I mean, that you would think are the

430
00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:03.890
most worrying coming from the madnessere that would, that

431
00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:07.770
link at least with some evolutionary psychology research. I

432
00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:12.609
mean, claims that maybe Are the most harmful, like,

433
00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:18.119
for example, misogynistic claims or claims that inspire hate

434
00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:21.170
toward women, for example, which are very common. I

435
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.719
mean, do you have any other examples like that?

436
00:21:25.329 --> 00:21:28.010
I mean, yeah, that's a pretty bad one. I

437
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.420
think, I think this interpretation of this dual mating

438
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.489
strategy hypothesis is pretty popular, and I think it

439
00:21:33.489 --> 00:21:35.969
does ground, uh, you know, I said there's not

440
00:21:35.969 --> 00:21:38.489
a lot of things that unite the manosphere, but

441
00:21:38.489 --> 00:21:43.760
I do think. Uh, ANTI-FEMINIST attitudes, you know, if

442
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.560
we wanna say misogynist attitudes, I, I think that's

443
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.199
like another uniting feature, uh, in a lot of

444
00:21:50.199 --> 00:21:53.319
Manosphere claims, uh, and I do think this interpretation

445
00:21:53.319 --> 00:21:56.640
of the dual mating strategy hypothesis does in particular

446
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.030
like lend itself a lot to these sorts of

447
00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:02.640
misogynistic attitudes, right? Um, AND there's also, there's this

448
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.020
like Odd tendency, you know, again, I would also

449
00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.180
recommend to all my colleagues, you know, go read

450
00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.619
the red pill subreddit, just like just check in

451
00:22:10.819 --> 00:22:13.619
periodically, again, it's not gonna feel good, uh, but

452
00:22:13.619 --> 00:22:15.979
it's gonna be eye opening in terms of, you

453
00:22:15.979 --> 00:22:19.219
know, how, how our ideas and our ways of

454
00:22:19.219 --> 00:22:22.510
thinking get appropriated in these fears. Uh, AND there's

455
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:26.459
just like there's this weird tendency where Like when

456
00:22:26.459 --> 00:22:31.469
it comes to thinking about women's mating psychology, these

457
00:22:31.469 --> 00:22:35.430
people are, you know, really dedicated amateur scientists, right?

458
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.390
Like they're really willing to put women's mating psychology

459
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:41.119
under a microscope and, you know, analyze it in

460
00:22:41.119 --> 00:22:44.510
these like pseudo evolutionary terms, and that's where like,

461
00:22:44.709 --> 00:22:46.930
you know, the dual mating strategy hypothesis is useful,

462
00:22:46.989 --> 00:22:50.150
right? You can characterize women as being just sort

463
00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:56.510
of like Yeah, like Darwinian automatons who are just,

464
00:22:56.589 --> 00:23:00.910
you know, Controlled like puppets by their genes towards

465
00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:04.479
like dating, having sex with these alpha male chads

466
00:23:04.479 --> 00:23:08.199
and, you know, duping these like, you know, poor

467
00:23:08.199 --> 00:23:12.300
betas and supporting uh supporting their lifestyles, right? It's,

468
00:23:12.479 --> 00:23:16.199
it's a very anti-woman, uh, uh, and it, you

469
00:23:16.199 --> 00:23:20.079
know, very much deprives uh. How do I say

470
00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:21.880
this? You, you could get the impression, you know,

471
00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.000
they did, they are interested in the evolutionary psychology

472
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.400
of men's mating psychology as well. Uh, THEY do

473
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.239
acknowledge that, you know, men's mating psychology is evolved

474
00:23:29.239 --> 00:23:31.880
too, but if you read these, it would be

475
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.000
very easy to come away. If you read the

476
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.479
way they actually talk about these things, it's very

477
00:23:35.479 --> 00:23:38.689
easy to come. WITH the belief that like, only

478
00:23:38.689 --> 00:23:41.640
men have free will, uh, like men are out

479
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.890
here just trying to do the right thing, just

480
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.040
trying to live a good life, uh, but they

481
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.489
are sort of victims to women's mating psychology in

482
00:23:49.489 --> 00:23:52.250
large part because of this dual mating strategy logic,

483
00:23:52.329 --> 00:23:56.010
right? Um, SO I think that does support, I

484
00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:57.689
don't know if it creates, but it does support

485
00:23:57.689 --> 00:24:02.380
this particularly misogynistic, I think anti-feminist worldview. Uh, I

486
00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.310
think there are other things. You know, like I

487
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.709
said, my specialties and preferences, um, and when you

488
00:24:07.709 --> 00:24:10.589
read, you know, another major part of especially like

489
00:24:10.589 --> 00:24:13.869
Incel worldviews, as I understand it, um, is this

490
00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:19.300
like obsession, there's a belief that women Really value

491
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.020
physical attractiveness, uh, again, stemming from this dual mating

492
00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.949
strategy hypothesis, like the idea that what women are

493
00:24:25.949 --> 00:24:28.660
looking for are these like good genes indicators, this

494
00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:34.819
like masculinity, dominance, height, uh, muscularity, etc. ETC. That's

495
00:24:34.819 --> 00:24:37.859
like what women really care about, um, and they

496
00:24:37.859 --> 00:24:40.819
don't care about, you know, people who are kind

497
00:24:40.819 --> 00:24:44.260
and good-hearted and, you know, uh, uh, you know,

498
00:24:44.339 --> 00:24:46.540
nice guys finish last sort of woe is me

499
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:51.209
kind of attitude. Uh, SO they have this belief

500
00:24:51.209 --> 00:24:55.829
that like physical attractiveness really is what matters in

501
00:24:55.959 --> 00:24:59.930
uh human relationships, and they really ignore all of

502
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:03.400
the substantial evidence that like physical attractiveness is not

503
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.489
the most important thing to most people, uh, which

504
00:25:06.489 --> 00:25:09.489
is one of the most robust findings from preference

505
00:25:09.489 --> 00:25:12.729
research, you know, this is where evolutionary psychologists can

506
00:25:12.729 --> 00:25:15.060
catch some flack, right? Uh, I think a lot

507
00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:18.000
of the evolutionary psychology of, of mate preferences for

508
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.699
reasons, but nonetheless has really heavily emphasized sex differences

509
00:25:22.699 --> 00:25:25.540
and mate preferences. And when you look at, you

510
00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.680
know, If you order mate preferences in terms of

511
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.400
like how sex differentiated they are, yeah, things like

512
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.880
age, physical attractiveness, resources, those are some of the

513
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.880
larger sex differences in mate preferences. So those are

514
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.319
the things that men and women disagree on the

515
00:25:40.319 --> 00:25:41.640
most in terms of what they're looking for in

516
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.719
a partner. But if you order preferences in terms

517
00:25:43.719 --> 00:25:46.119
of what do people actually find important, what do

518
00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:48.839
people actually find value in a partner, like physical

519
00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:52.010
attractiveness is pretty. Middling for most people around the

520
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.089
world, and it has been for as long as

521
00:25:54.089 --> 00:25:56.530
people have been doing this research, right? Physical attractiveness

522
00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.569
is not the most important thing to men or

523
00:25:58.569 --> 00:26:00.729
women, to most men or women. The things that

524
00:26:00.729 --> 00:26:03.209
are most important to people are things like kindness,

525
00:26:03.329 --> 00:26:05.930
right? That is generally the thing that appears towards

526
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.449
the top of most people's lists. Uh, AND that

527
00:26:08.449 --> 00:26:12.439
I think gets zero play in these circles, or,

528
00:26:12.489 --> 00:26:16.380
you know, they sort of. Accuse women uh of

529
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.859
being deceitful about how much they value kindness, but

530
00:26:18.859 --> 00:26:21.069
of course men are not being deceitful, that couldn't

531
00:26:21.069 --> 00:26:23.459
be, uh, so yeah, I think that's another way

532
00:26:23.459 --> 00:26:27.569
where the literature gets distorted, um, uh, in ways

533
00:26:27.569 --> 00:26:30.560
that that support these, I think. Yeah, I think

534
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:37.020
misogynistic, uh, anti-feminist worldviews. Um, THERE'S other things, uh,

535
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.150
there's one idea, I think maybe Louie introduced this

536
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.469
to me. I don't remember where I learned about

537
00:26:41.469 --> 00:26:44.579
this, but there's something that like a reasonably popular

538
00:26:44.579 --> 00:26:48.910
idea among uh in cells called uh Breau's law

539
00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.349
or something like that, um, which is like, it's

540
00:26:52.349 --> 00:26:55.030
supposed to be an idea from evolutionary biology that

541
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.819
like, Basically like the female of the species like

542
00:26:58.819 --> 00:27:03.250
dictates all like patterns of interactions, uh, it's like,

543
00:27:03.339 --> 00:27:05.979
you know, if there's no benefit to an interaction

544
00:27:05.979 --> 00:27:09.170
from females, then like females have power to like

545
00:27:09.579 --> 00:27:12.020
uh end that interaction, and this is supposed to

546
00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.939
be, again, this contributes to this sort of like

547
00:27:13.939 --> 00:27:18.489
anti-feminist worldview that like, you know, women secretly control

548
00:27:18.489 --> 00:27:21.780
society and that like feminism is a like a

549
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.010
covert agenda to advance women's interests in society over

550
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.160
men. And you know, they cite this Briau's law

551
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.250
as like, you know, evidence that this is grounded

552
00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.890
in like evolutionary biological principles. Like I had never

553
00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:37.849
heard of Briau's law before I started reading this

554
00:27:37.849 --> 00:27:41.810
man stuff. Uh, IT turns out like. I tried

555
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.290
to include this like in an early draft of

556
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.400
my my Boston Globe thing, but it got cut.

557
00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.290
But like it turns out like Brio was like

558
00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.609
a surgeon, like he wasn't even a scientist, he

559
00:27:49.609 --> 00:27:51.930
was just like a French surgeon who just said

560
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.640
this. Uh, I don't think it was based on

561
00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.250
any evidence really, it was just this guy's opinion.

562
00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.969
Um, AND I don't think it really caught on

563
00:27:59.969 --> 00:28:02.890
at the time. Somehow it got rediscovered and, you

564
00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.050
know, the manosphere has decided that this is like

565
00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.449
a scientifically supported law, but like, no scientist I've

566
00:28:07.449 --> 00:28:09.569
ever heard of. I've never heard a scientists talk

567
00:28:09.569 --> 00:28:11.170
about this. I've never heard a science reference this

568
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:15.430
scientist referenced this, um. You know, psychology is not

569
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.349
generally the kind of science that issues laws. Like

570
00:28:18.349 --> 00:28:21.229
we don't, we don't understand the mind enough to

571
00:28:21.229 --> 00:28:23.270
be making laws. Uh, MAYBE if you're like a

572
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.430
psychophysicist, maybe if you're talking about like how bright

573
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:27.109
a point of light is on a wall, like

574
00:28:27.109 --> 00:28:29.589
maybe you can start dictating, you can, you can

575
00:28:29.589 --> 00:28:33.160
start expressing some laws, but like, Uh, it's very

576
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.020
unusual to hear like a psychological scientist or an

577
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.560
anthropologist talk about laws other than maybe like scaling

578
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.400
laws and like how big an organism's arm is

579
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.189
relative to its body or something like that. Uh,

580
00:28:45.319 --> 00:28:48.640
SO it's again, it's just like a complete fabrication

581
00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:51.079
that has like the veneer of science on it,

582
00:28:51.239 --> 00:28:52.880
but like, again, you scratch the surface a little

583
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.140
bit and you see like there's no actual scientific

584
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.839
basis for this for this idea.

585
00:28:57.709 --> 00:29:00.750
Yeah, but I mean, from your own perspective as

586
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:05.079
an evolutionary psychologist, why do you think that evolutionary

587
00:29:05.079 --> 00:29:09.939
psychology became so popular among people from the menosphere?

588
00:29:09.949 --> 00:29:12.699
What makes it so appealing to them?

589
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.260
It's a good question. And it's something I've been

590
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.619
asking myself for two years now. Uh, AND I,

591
00:29:20.739 --> 00:29:23.650
I, I'm afraid I don't have a great answer.

592
00:29:23.979 --> 00:29:28.619
Um. I think there's there's multiple things that that

593
00:29:28.619 --> 00:29:31.020
could be contributing here. It's probably not just one

594
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.739
thing. Um, I mean, for one, you know, to

595
00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:38.739
our credit, I guess, uh, we as evolutionary psychologists,

596
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.939
we have a lot to say about human mating

597
00:29:40.939 --> 00:29:42.660
and human relationships, and that is a big part

598
00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.579
of what the manosphere cares about, right? These are

599
00:29:44.579 --> 00:29:48.930
people who are frustrated with their experiences in love.

600
00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:53.089
They're turning to the the modern science of dating

601
00:29:53.089 --> 00:29:56.170
and relationships and love, and, you know, evolutionary psychologists

602
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:59.459
have done a good job mapping human mating psychology

603
00:29:59.459 --> 00:30:03.130
and and providing insights into human relationships. And so

604
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.449
I, I think it's pretty natural you would come

605
00:30:05.449 --> 00:30:07.810
across evolutionary psychology if you're looking for, you know,

606
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.130
a greater understanding of, of, you know, why things

607
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:11.489
aren't going the way you want them in your

608
00:30:11.489 --> 00:30:13.880
personal life. That's like we're not the only game

609
00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.839
in town, right? Social psychologists have also made a

610
00:30:15.839 --> 00:30:19.270
lot of really valuable contributions. So sociologists, so anthropologists,

611
00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.319
uh, so there is something out of all of

612
00:30:22.319 --> 00:30:24.040
the people who have something to say, they are

613
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.160
picking out us in particular, um, and so I

614
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.160
think we as evolutionary psychologists, I think we do

615
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.880
have to think hard about, you know, what are

616
00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.959
we doing that's making our science stand out as

617
00:30:34.959 --> 00:30:38.790
interesting to these people with these particularly hateful uh

618
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:43.099
worldviews. I think there is a long history of,

619
00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.479
you know, right wing movements appropriating evolutionary theory. Um,

620
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:53.410
I think it's, it's not hard. THERE'S a a

621
00:30:53.729 --> 00:30:57.569
dim read of like selfish gene, you know, geneic

622
00:30:57.569 --> 00:31:01.130
level selection that I think, um, you know, caters

623
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:06.449
to particular sort of like right wing authoritarian worldviews,

624
00:31:06.569 --> 00:31:10.010
right? Like survival of the fittest kind of, especially

625
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.800
if you're prone to committing the naturalistic fallacy and,

626
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.290
and, you know, believing that, you know, what is

627
00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:17.800
natural is good or should be. You know, I

628
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.319
think the idea that like selection works by, you

629
00:31:21.319 --> 00:31:23.750
know, sort of cut out the weak and leaving

630
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:26.199
only the strong for the survival of the species

631
00:31:26.199 --> 00:31:28.800
or whatever, I think can be appealing to people

632
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.959
who have um certain certain kind of right wing

633
00:31:31.959 --> 00:31:34.599
ideologies, which I think does tie into sort of

634
00:31:34.599 --> 00:31:38.890
anti-feminist ideologies and misogynistic ideologies. Um, YOU know, there's

635
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:42.040
also, of course, a long history of association between,

636
00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:45.719
uh, you know, evolutionary thinking and eugenics, of course,

637
00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:48.290
um, and I think a lot of these, I

638
00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:51.000
don't think eugenics per se is a part of

639
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.050
the manosphere ideology, but I would not, uh, I

640
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:57.229
think there is a general, uh, these days, a

641
00:31:57.229 --> 00:32:00.530
trend in especially a lot of online communities, a

642
00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:03.390
lot of online right wing communities. Uh, YOU know,

643
00:32:03.469 --> 00:32:05.709
eugenics is having a resurgence, and I would not

644
00:32:05.709 --> 00:32:08.469
be surprised if there's some overlap between, you know,

645
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:11.670
the kinds of people who, uh, these manosphere ideologies

646
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.310
appe appeal to you as well as the kinds

647
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:18.400
of people, um, who, you know, these. Uh, NEO

648
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.329
eugenics ideas appeal to you. So I, I think

649
00:32:21.329 --> 00:32:26.310
it's not hard. Uh, IT'S unfortunately not hard to

650
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.989
kind of fall into these right wing ideologies from

651
00:32:28.989 --> 00:32:31.709
evolutionary thinking, uh, especially if you have a kind

652
00:32:31.709 --> 00:32:34.949
of superficial read of what evolutionary theory is or

653
00:32:34.949 --> 00:32:37.069
says. Um, SO I think that's just like a

654
00:32:37.069 --> 00:32:40.430
constant struggle that you have to fight with when

655
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.189
you are a scientist in these evolutionary spaces, right?

656
00:32:43.239 --> 00:32:49.150
Like, not, uh, not catering to these like. Uh,

657
00:32:49.439 --> 00:32:51.949
AGAIN, superficial reads of what evolutionary theory is that

658
00:32:51.959 --> 00:32:55.969
that promotes these right wing ideologies, um. And then

659
00:32:55.969 --> 00:33:00.800
I also think Partly because of this, um, there's

660
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.770
a long history of evolutionary approaches to behavior, especially

661
00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:08.689
human behavior, being controversial, right? Um, I think because

662
00:33:08.689 --> 00:33:11.680
of these, you know, long standing right wing associations,

663
00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:14.810
there is an understandable from people with especially left

664
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:19.250
wing ideologies, there's an understandable hesitance around evolutionary approaches,

665
00:33:19.369 --> 00:33:21.589
behaviors that can be a sort of knee jerk,

666
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:25.250
uh, rejection of these kinds of approaches, knee jerk

667
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:29.479
criticism of these approaches. Um, SO it gets automatically,

668
00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.280
no matter what you're doing or saying, I think

669
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.800
taking an evolutionary approach to human behavior automatically is

670
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.640
controversial, um, and it automatically controversial to people with

671
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.560
more, you know, left leaning ideologies, and so I

672
00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.209
think for that reason the field can take on.

673
00:33:45.489 --> 00:33:48.479
It takes on a reputation as being like kind

674
00:33:48.479 --> 00:33:51.800
of a safe space for provocateurs, right? Uh, THIS

675
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.199
is the place where you go if you want

676
00:33:54.199 --> 00:33:56.560
to say controversial things, especially if you want to

677
00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.400
say things that run contrary to left wing ideologies,

678
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.319
right? Um, SO I think there are a lot

679
00:34:02.319 --> 00:34:05.599
of people. Who come to the field, not because

680
00:34:05.599 --> 00:34:07.839
they have a deep interest in, like, you know,

681
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.918
Santa Barbara style adaptation, uh, but just cause like

682
00:34:10.918 --> 00:34:13.550
they enjoy making people mad and they just especially

683
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:17.070
enjoy making, you know, left leaning people mad, um,

684
00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.360
and I think there are some scientists who have

685
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.719
that kind of motivation, right? I think they come

686
00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:23.750
to the field just because they want to say

687
00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.918
controversial things, and I think there are a lot

688
00:34:25.918 --> 00:34:28.560
of lay people who, you know, the field has

689
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.389
gained that reputation. Um, AND so they come to

690
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:33.750
the field, like, if I know I'm, you know,

691
00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.909
I don't like feminism, if I know I've got

692
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:39.179
these misogynistic ideas, I know I want some scientific

693
00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:43.560
backing for these kind of anti-left wing ideas, then,

694
00:34:43.708 --> 00:34:45.668
you know, hey, there's this evolutionary psychology thing that

695
00:34:45.668 --> 00:34:48.120
people on the left seem to hate, uh, and,

696
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:50.728
you know, has these like provocative people who are

697
00:34:50.728 --> 00:34:52.830
running their mouths, right? Like this seems like maybe

698
00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.310
a good place to find the kind of scientific

699
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.389
support that I'm looking for, uh, and I, I

700
00:34:57.389 --> 00:35:02.159
really worry that The field uh is maybe kind

701
00:35:02.159 --> 00:35:04.870
of trapped in this sort of positive feedback loop

702
00:35:05.399 --> 00:35:08.110
where I, I think by virtue of having this

703
00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:13.600
reputation as being uh a safe place to stir

704
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.280
a controversy, right, it attracts people who are more

705
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:21.120
interested in controversy than science. Uh, THOSE people do

706
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.639
and say controversial things, which earns the field that

707
00:35:24.639 --> 00:35:26.800
more of that reputation, which attracts more of these

708
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.429
people. Uh, AND I think makes it more and

709
00:35:29.429 --> 00:35:32.419
more an appealing place to these, these manosphere communities.

710
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.110
So even though I don't think these things have

711
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.620
a deep connection to the like the theoretical logic

712
00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.989
of the field, it's like sort of hard to

713
00:35:41.989 --> 00:35:45.459
shake out of this reputation and and hard to

714
00:35:45.469 --> 00:35:49.250
to get away from these, these, you know, Cycles

715
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:50.159
of controversy.

716
00:35:50.979 --> 00:35:54.820
And what do you make of evolutionary psychologists who

717
00:35:54.820 --> 00:36:00.350
are public intellectuals and align themselves with the manosphere

718
00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:04.260
or at the very least sympathize with the manosphere?

719
00:36:06.379 --> 00:36:15.330
Uh, uh, WE'RE being recorded, right? Um, YOU know.

720
00:36:17.149 --> 00:36:20.510
I think there are lots of people out there

721
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:23.469
with lots of different motivations, some of which I

722
00:36:23.469 --> 00:36:28.229
think are purer than others. Um, uh, I, it's

723
00:36:28.229 --> 00:36:31.260
a really, it's not an easy thing to know

724
00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:35.570
what to do about, right? Um. You know, I,

725
00:36:35.699 --> 00:36:39.250
I think there's certainly a part of me, uh,

726
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.340
especially there was once a part of me that

727
00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.379
was like, Yeah, I just wanna close my eyes

728
00:36:44.379 --> 00:36:45.699
to all of this stuff and just do my

729
00:36:45.699 --> 00:36:47.939
science, right? The best thing we can do is

730
00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:50.060
just put as much truth out there into the

731
00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:53.870
world, and eventually that truth will filter out. Like,

732
00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.419
someone else will, you know, I'm a scientist, I'm

733
00:36:56.419 --> 00:36:59.250
not a public intellectual, I'm not a good popularizer.

734
00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.100
Like, it, it's not my job, and it can't

735
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.580
be my job to like communicate what I do

736
00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.179
to the masses. I'm just gonna do my science

737
00:37:05.179 --> 00:37:07.260
and like somebody else. I'll trust that somebody else

738
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.500
will communicate this accurately to the masses. Um, THAT'S,

739
00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:14.760
that's a comforting idea. Uh, BUT like that's Clearly

740
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.560
doesn't work, right? Um, I, I think we as

741
00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:21.850
scientists do have an obligation to, you know, communicate.

742
00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:24.570
Our findings to the public, right? The public is

743
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:27.530
bankrolling this work, we're doing it ostensibly for the

744
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.929
public good. We have an obligation, I think, to

745
00:37:29.929 --> 00:37:31.649
make sure that our work is actually promoting the

746
00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:33.290
public good and it's, you know, the the the

747
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:36.370
public is actually educated on on on what science

748
00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.969
is finding, um, so I think there are people

749
00:37:38.969 --> 00:37:44.370
out there who are doing a noble job trying

750
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:49.600
to accurately communicate. You know, modern understanding of society

751
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.530
and dating from science, you know, I, I would

752
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:55.929
count you among them, uh, um, and I think

753
00:37:55.929 --> 00:37:57.810
that's something that like we as scientists need to

754
00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.520
do more and need to do better. I do

755
00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.479
think there are. Uh, SO those public intellectuals I

756
00:38:04.479 --> 00:38:08.500
admire, and you know, incels like. I, I don't

757
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.370
want to say like incels are necessarily bad people,

758
00:38:11.459 --> 00:38:15.500
right? Um, I think incel ideologies are bad. I

759
00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.500
think they're despicable. Um, I think they have led

760
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.699
to tangible harm. I think both to women and

761
00:38:20.699 --> 00:38:21.820
to men, like, I think the men who fall

762
00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.850
into this are being harmed by these, these like

763
00:38:25.239 --> 00:38:31.290
uh fatalistic false ideologies, um. But I don't think

764
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:33.090
like the men who fall into this are necessarily

765
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.370
bad people, right? I can understand, you know, I've

766
00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:37.500
I've like had friends who have fallen into these

767
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.000
circles, right? Like I think there's a, a not

768
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.250
terribly distant universe where I could have fallen into

769
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.010
these sorts of these sorts of ideologies, right? Like,

770
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.810
I get it, um, and so I think, you

771
00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:52.729
know, it is good to Um, try to engage

772
00:38:52.729 --> 00:38:54.610
with these men, right? I, I think, like, I

773
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:58.129
think it's a noble effort, uh, to try to

774
00:38:58.129 --> 00:39:00.050
show these people that you don't have to believe

775
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:01.570
these things. I think there is a read of

776
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:05.280
the science that is more hopeful, is not anti-feminist,

777
00:39:05.689 --> 00:39:07.489
and I think there are people out there trying

778
00:39:07.489 --> 00:39:08.929
to do that, and I think that's a good

779
00:39:08.929 --> 00:39:12.209
thing, uh, and I admire those public intellectuals, uh,

780
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:16.719
but it's also engaging with these kinds of communities,

781
00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:22.219
it can be difficult. Because, you know, by engaging,

782
00:39:22.389 --> 00:39:24.909
you know, the academic freedom types will say, you

783
00:39:24.909 --> 00:39:28.510
know, everything should kind of live or die in

784
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:30.590
the marketplace of ideas, right? Like you should not

785
00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:32.870
be afraid to debate anything and, you know, if

786
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.909
your idea is really good, it will survive. And

787
00:39:35.909 --> 00:39:37.709
there's some truth in that, but at the same

788
00:39:37.709 --> 00:39:40.669
time, like, engaging some of these ideologies can run

789
00:39:40.669 --> 00:39:43.709
the risk of legitimizing them in ways that really

790
00:39:43.709 --> 00:39:46.080
backfire, right? Some of these ideas are just bad,

791
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.300
they're just stupid, and they should just be ignored.

792
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:50.110
And, you know, if you try to debate these

793
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:52.830
people, you know, there are people out there who

794
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:55.350
are not earnestly interested in debate, right? They are

795
00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:58.110
ideologues, you're not gonna change their mind, you're not

796
00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.739
gonna change their communities' minds, and by debating them,

797
00:40:00.909 --> 00:40:03.100
you're just making them, especially if you're coming with

798
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.590
like, you know, university credentials, and if you're, you

799
00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:09.629
know, using your valuable time as a scientist to

800
00:40:09.629 --> 00:40:11.250
debate with these people, you're sending a signal to

801
00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.750
the world that like, this is an ideology that's

802
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.270
worth paying attention to. So even if you feel

803
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:20.469
as though you've like definitively uh uh bested them

804
00:40:20.469 --> 00:40:22.510
in the marketplace of ideas, like, there's a lot

805
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.459
of ideologues out there who are not gonna care

806
00:40:24.459 --> 00:40:25.719
what you have to say, and they're just gonna

807
00:40:25.719 --> 00:40:27.429
say like, look, we got the scientists to pay

808
00:40:27.429 --> 00:40:29.560
attention to us, that means we've got something worth

809
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.429
saying. Uh, SO I think you need to I

810
00:40:33.429 --> 00:40:35.149
think engaging with these communities can be good, but

811
00:40:35.149 --> 00:40:36.830
you need to do it really carefully in a

812
00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:40.189
way that's not legitimizing them, uh, in a way

813
00:40:40.189 --> 00:40:43.149
that's not, uh, giving them clout that they don't

814
00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:45.510
deserve. Uh, I think there are some people who

815
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:50.139
even sort of flirt with, um, You know, I

816
00:40:50.139 --> 00:40:53.540
think in an effort to maybe ingratiate themselves a

817
00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.629
little bit with these communities to get better access,

818
00:40:55.739 --> 00:40:58.860
I think there's way people who maybe inadvertently end

819
00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.500
up sort of promoting some of these ideologies, and

820
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.780
then I think there are people, I think there

821
00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.879
are people who are just cynical, uh, and, um,

822
00:41:06.979 --> 00:41:09.939
you know, they're public intellectuals just because they want

823
00:41:09.939 --> 00:41:11.620
to be famous and this just happened to be

824
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.780
their best way to do that. Uh, I think

825
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.179
they don't have, you know, the public's interest in

826
00:41:16.179 --> 00:41:18.209
mind. Uh, I think this is just a good

827
00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:20.850
way to get a paycheck for them, um, and

828
00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:23.889
so they are, you know, gleefully, I don't think

829
00:41:23.889 --> 00:41:26.330
they care about these issues. I don't think they

830
00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:29.530
care whether Manosphere ideologies are right or not. I,

831
00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:31.239
I think they're bullshitters. I think they don't care

832
00:41:31.239 --> 00:41:33.129
what the truth is, they just care what butters

833
00:41:33.129 --> 00:41:35.610
they're bread, um, and those people I think are

834
00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:38.649
despicable. Uh, I won't name names, but, you know,

835
00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.320
you can probably guess who I think they are

836
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:44.560
from, you know, uh. Just their attitudes and, you

837
00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:49.239
know, my social media, um, but, uh, yeah, those

838
00:41:49.239 --> 00:41:52.949
people I think are, I think they're willing to

839
00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.040
sell out the field. I think they're willing to

840
00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.239
sell out the science, uh, to make a quick

841
00:41:58.239 --> 00:42:00.949
buck for themselves, uh, and I think that's what's

842
00:42:00.949 --> 00:42:04.199
sort of perpetuating this, this positive feedback cycle that

843
00:42:04.199 --> 00:42:07.360
is really damaging, you know, I think evolutionary psychology

844
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.750
is like one of the best. Scientific enterprises in

845
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:12.310
the history of psychology. I think this is the

846
00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:13.949
best way to do psychology. I think this is

847
00:42:13.949 --> 00:42:16.949
our best hope to understand the human mind and

848
00:42:16.949 --> 00:42:20.110
like harness this to improve society, um, but I

849
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:23.229
think I, I worry about our ability to achieve

850
00:42:23.229 --> 00:42:25.629
that because there are these, I, I think bad

851
00:42:25.629 --> 00:42:30.909
actors who um are willing to cash in on

852
00:42:30.909 --> 00:42:33.820
whatever scientific credibility the rest of us are working

853
00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.229
hard to build, uh, in order to get, you

854
00:42:36.229 --> 00:42:40.209
know, An extra high paying speaking gig or, you

855
00:42:40.209 --> 00:42:43.090
know, a nice, you know, editorial position on some

856
00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:47.110
white supremacist magazine or something like that. Um, uh,

857
00:42:47.129 --> 00:42:49.040
SO yeah, those people I think are are bad.

858
00:42:50.479 --> 00:42:51.850
Did I answer your question? Uh,

859
00:42:53.239 --> 00:42:56.750
YEAH, yes, I, I think so. So, uh, uh,

860
00:42:56.879 --> 00:42:59.280
let me ask you now, I, I, I mean,

861
00:42:59.399 --> 00:43:01.280
I, I'm not sure to what extent this will

862
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:04.520
be a little bit speculative, but, uh, from what

863
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:08.600
you understand, what do you think are the motivations

864
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.215
of people who made a name for themselves in

865
00:43:12.215 --> 00:43:14.455
the menosphere. I mean, is it, is it, what

866
00:43:14.455 --> 00:43:18.985
is it? Money, social status? I mean, maybe I,

867
00:43:19.094 --> 00:43:21.205
I'm, I'm not sure. I don't know their own

868
00:43:21.495 --> 00:43:25.814
personal stories, but, uh, I would imagine that perhaps

869
00:43:25.814 --> 00:43:28.804
at least one or two of them would have,

870
00:43:28.814 --> 00:43:34.854
uh, a history of, uh, bad past relationships or

871
00:43:34.854 --> 00:43:37.735
something like that. So, I, I mean, but what

872
00:43:37.735 --> 00:43:39.054
do, what do you think about it?

873
00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.290
Yeah, yeah, I, I don't think there's like 11

874
00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:44.929
easy answer, and I think I, I, you know,

875
00:43:44.969 --> 00:43:47.010
I kind of said part of what I think

876
00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:49.449
about this, right? It, you know, I think the

877
00:43:49.449 --> 00:43:52.370
manosphere itself is, is nebulous. It, it's a loose

878
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:54.520
collection of a lot of different people and communities.

879
00:43:54.989 --> 00:43:57.560
Um, SO I don't think there's like one motivation

880
00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.929
you can ascribe to all people who are in

881
00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:06.530
these circles. Um, LOOK, I, it's easy and fun.

882
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:11.000
To be cynical, uh, and just say all of

883
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.679
these people are grifters, they're just in it to

884
00:44:13.679 --> 00:44:16.290
get a paycheck for themselves, you know, they don't,

885
00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:20.050
they don't care about. You know, they don't care

886
00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:21.679
about these people, they don't care about the ground

887
00:44:21.679 --> 00:44:23.719
truth of these ideologies, they're just, yeah, they're just

888
00:44:23.719 --> 00:44:27.600
after money and status for themselves, and that's actually,

889
00:44:27.659 --> 00:44:30.510
I think like a good heuristic when it comes

890
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:34.439
to uh influencers of all stripes, right? Like that's

891
00:44:34.439 --> 00:44:36.520
probably gonna lead you right more often it leads

892
00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.760
you wrong. So if you want a pat answer,

893
00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.199
yeah, like it just you can trust that most

894
00:44:41.199 --> 00:44:43.830
people are doing the things that they're doing, uh,

895
00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.600
just cause, you know, it gives them money and

896
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.010
status, um. But I, I, I don't think that's

897
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:51.090
true of everybody. Uh, YEAH, I think there's probably

898
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:52.850
a spectrum here. I think there are people who

899
00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:57.280
do have some more. Misguided as they may be,

900
00:44:57.379 --> 00:44:59.320
have some more genuine motivations, and then I think

901
00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.840
there are people who are just like cynical cash

902
00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.520
grab people. So, you know, I think like, like

903
00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:08.040
Andrew Tate. Uh, FRESH and fit, like, I don't

904
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.679
think they care about their audiences, right? I don't

905
00:45:10.679 --> 00:45:13.449
think they want to help anybody, right? They're con

906
00:45:13.449 --> 00:45:16.120
artists, right? You know, if you're watching this, you

907
00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.639
know, you're somebody who's like, you know, maybe adjacent

908
00:45:18.639 --> 00:45:20.600
to the Intel circle, maybe you're curious about these

909
00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.840
things, like, I promise you, Andrew Tate doesn't give

910
00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.070
a shit about you. Like he's a con artist.

911
00:45:25.199 --> 00:45:26.719
He's in it to make as much money for

912
00:45:26.719 --> 00:45:31.530
himself. He's like no. A convicted criminal, um, like,

913
00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:34.330
yeah, I don't think he has a deep commitment

914
00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:37.010
to any particular worldview. Uh, I don't think he

915
00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:39.850
has a deep interest to like helping men live

916
00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:42.250
better lives or whatever. Uh, I think he just

917
00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:44.530
wants to make as much money, um, and have

918
00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:48.189
as much status as he can get, um. You

919
00:45:48.189 --> 00:45:49.949
know, other people like, you know, I don't know

920
00:45:49.949 --> 00:45:55.739
your Jordan Petersons, Jordan Peterson think he's helping people?

921
00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:59.040
Uh, I think he's wrong. I think he's misguided.

922
00:45:59.429 --> 00:46:00.979
I think he is doing a lot of harm,

923
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:03.860
uh, but like, is he, I, I could believe

924
00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.750
that he is so deluded that he doesn't think

925
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:07.469
he's doing that. Like, I could believe that he

926
00:46:07.469 --> 00:46:09.110
thinks he's doing the right thing and he's just

927
00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:12.580
wrong about what the right thing is. Um, uh,

928
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.129
BUT I I don't think he likes money and

929
00:46:14.129 --> 00:46:16.919
status too, right? Uh, I think he's, you know,

930
00:46:17.169 --> 00:46:19.330
he could have stayed in his university position and

931
00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:21.260
he could have done these things, you know, by,

932
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.850
by doing the science, but he chose to become

933
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:30.179
this, you know, Uh, firebrand, uh, you know, controversial

934
00:46:30.179 --> 00:46:33.689
public intellectual influencer type, so I, I, you know,

935
00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:36.010
I think, I think that he does have some

936
00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:40.379
self-interest as well, um. You know, I, I think,

937
00:46:40.409 --> 00:46:44.750
you know, these like dating coach pickup artists, kind

938
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:48.570
of YouTubers and TikTok guys and book writers, you

939
00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:52.229
know. I think those guys maybe have the most.

940
00:46:53.459 --> 00:46:57.139
Pure intentions again, I think their ideas are misogynistic

941
00:46:57.139 --> 00:47:00.060
and wrong, uh, but I think, you know, for

942
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.500
the most part, I think they do think that

943
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.169
they're like helping men with their dating problems, right?

944
00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:07.580
Um, AND, you know, making some money, but we

945
00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.340
all got to make money. Uh, SO I think

946
00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:12.419
there's a diversity of motivations out there, um, some

947
00:47:12.419 --> 00:47:13.969
of which are pure and some which are not,

948
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.530
um, and it can be hard to tell, uh,

949
00:47:16.699 --> 00:47:19.479
in some cases exactly how pure there are, uh,

950
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:21.270
but in some cases, you know, again, you're, you're

951
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:24.889
amputates at all. Uh, IT'S pretty clear that they,

952
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.899
they have no intentions of helping anyone in their

953
00:47:26.899 --> 00:47:27.300
lives.

954
00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:31.290
Right. I, I mean, it seems to me, I

955
00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:33.090
don't know if you will agree with this or

956
00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:34.610
not, but it seems to me at the end

957
00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:39.290
of the day that what the menosphere mostly offers

958
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:44.439
men are rationalizations for their failures. Do you agree

959
00:47:44.439 --> 00:47:46.840
with that or at least to some extent?

960
00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:54.580
It's, it's, it's tough. I I don't know that

961
00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.229
I want to say like. I guess it depends

962
00:47:57.229 --> 00:47:59.909
on what you mean by rationalizations, you know, again,

963
00:48:00.189 --> 00:48:03.260
it's so easy and so tempting to be cynical,

964
00:48:04.129 --> 00:48:05.979
um, you know, it's so easy to just say

965
00:48:05.979 --> 00:48:09.149
like, these people are losers and they're just looking

966
00:48:09.149 --> 00:48:12.780
for excuses for why they're losers. Uh, BUT I,

967
00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.260
I don't think that's what we should say, and

968
00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:18.260
I don't think that's quite right. Um, I, I

969
00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:21.100
think there are people out there, yeah, who are

970
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.820
like that, but I, I think, you know, I,

971
00:48:24.909 --> 00:48:27.510
again, not being a sociologist, not being like an

972
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:30.989
expert in manosphere or like intel psychology, in my,

973
00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:33.830
my opinion as like a mating psychology person who's

974
00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:36.149
just been sort of exposed to these things, my

975
00:48:36.149 --> 00:48:39.560
impression is like, these are men who have some

976
00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:44.040
genuine frustrations, right? Uh SOME understandable frustrations, right? Like,

977
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:46.949
you know, dating, mating mating is a big part

978
00:48:46.949 --> 00:48:49.350
of life, right? Uh, IT'S a thing that it

979
00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:51.379
makes sense to have lots of strong feelings about.

980
00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.739
Um, AND if it's not going the way that

981
00:48:53.739 --> 00:48:55.300
you want it to go, like that does feel

982
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.590
terrible, right? Uh, IT feels terrible for good reasons.

983
00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:01.199
Um, AND so I think if you're the kind

984
00:49:01.199 --> 00:49:04.020
of guy who just for whatever reason, you're not

985
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:07.340
having the success you want in relationships, I think

986
00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:10.010
it's reasonable to turn to Google and say like,

987
00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.979
you know, what's going on, right? Why am I

988
00:49:12.979 --> 00:49:15.939
not having the life I want to have, you

989
00:49:15.939 --> 00:49:17.939
know, how do I explain the situation that I'm

990
00:49:17.939 --> 00:49:19.979
in, and, you know, what can I do to

991
00:49:19.979 --> 00:49:21.909
try to get out of it? And I think

992
00:49:21.909 --> 00:49:25.189
a lot of manosphere communities sort of emerged originally

993
00:49:25.189 --> 00:49:27.629
as like attempts to offer those kinds of answers,

994
00:49:27.989 --> 00:49:30.879
uh, and they sort of fell into this kind

995
00:49:30.879 --> 00:49:36.340
of misogynistic anti-feminist, uh hateful at times violent track,

996
00:49:36.489 --> 00:49:40.030
uh, at some point, um, but, you know, in

997
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:43.689
principle, I think like, Uh, these, the, the kinds,

998
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.520
especially, you know, if you're not talking about these

999
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.080
like grifter influencers who I think are, you know,

1000
00:49:48.159 --> 00:49:50.320
appropriating these communities to their own interests. We're just

1001
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.679
talking about like the men who are reading these

1002
00:49:52.679 --> 00:49:55.280
things, uh, who are posting these things, who are

1003
00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.320
just trying to like Get some advice. Like I,

1004
00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:00.639
I think they are just like, yeah, they're just

1005
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.889
like any person who's like, why is my, you

1006
00:50:03.889 --> 00:50:05.649
know, sourdough not turning out the way I want

1007
00:50:05.649 --> 00:50:07.969
it to, right? Like they're just going to internet

1008
00:50:07.969 --> 00:50:10.330
communities, they're going to communities of of people like

1009
00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:12.409
them and trying to get advice and it's just

1010
00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:17.050
like has fallen into this, this strange um uh

1011
00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:20.560
strange misogynistic uh tone. Uh, SO I don't know

1012
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.600
if it's like, I don't wanna say it's rationalizations

1013
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.439
for their failures. I think it's just like, it's

1014
00:50:24.439 --> 00:50:26.159
just people trying to understand how to live a

1015
00:50:26.159 --> 00:50:29.919
better life, um, and I'm, you know, sympathetic to

1016
00:50:29.919 --> 00:50:33.489
them for that reason, um, but I do think

1017
00:50:33.489 --> 00:50:36.000
it gets, it gets co-opted by people who don't

1018
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.320
necessarily have these people's best interests in mind.

1019
00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:42.770
OK, so when it comes to those people who

1020
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:45.770
do not have these other people's best interests in

1021
00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:50.370
mind and the kinds of uh erroneous and very

1022
00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:54.439
negative claims that they make about women and other

1023
00:50:54.439 --> 00:50:57.810
and other kinds of things, um, do you think,

1024
00:50:57.889 --> 00:51:00.449
uh, in what ways do you think that those

1025
00:51:00.449 --> 00:51:04.570
claims might also hurt the men who are attracted

1026
00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:05.699
to the men's?

1027
00:51:07.379 --> 00:51:10.340
I, I, I, yeah, I think it's bad for

1028
00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.659
these men, right? Um, uh, I think, you know,

1029
00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.260
and there's research out there, right, like on, especially

1030
00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:21.139
in cells, right? I, I think are very hopeless,

1031
00:51:21.459 --> 00:51:25.219
fatalistic people. I think by virtue of being convinced

1032
00:51:25.219 --> 00:51:29.260
of this worldview that basically like if you are

1033
00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:33.300
physically unattractive, you are sort of like doomed by

1034
00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:37.459
Darwin. To live this unhappy life, where like, I

1035
00:51:37.459 --> 00:51:39.300
mean, you know, I think the intel worldview is

1036
00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.620
basically either like you're a chad and you're doomed

1037
00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.179
to live this like playboy lifestyle where sure you'll

1038
00:51:45.179 --> 00:51:47.340
get lots of sex, but you'll never experience true

1039
00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:50.479
love, or you're like a beta. And like your,

1040
00:51:50.489 --> 00:51:53.209
your fate is to be like duped by women

1041
00:51:53.209 --> 00:51:56.929
forever, like, maybe you'll get like brief glimpses of

1042
00:51:56.929 --> 00:51:59.689
what feels like love, but you'll ultimately be, you'll

1043
00:51:59.689 --> 00:52:02.780
ultimately be betrayed by like feminism and women's mating

1044
00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:08.530
psychology. It's a really grim outlook. Um, AND I

1045
00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:11.810
think it does contribute to a lot of depression

1046
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:13.770
and anxiety. Maybe, I don't know if it contributes,

1047
00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:15.889
maybe it caters to the depression anxiety that was

1048
00:52:15.889 --> 00:52:18.290
already there, but like, it's certainly not helping these

1049
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:20.649
men, you know, feel good about their lives, right?

1050
00:52:20.699 --> 00:52:24.949
I think it is providing, um. It it's providing

1051
00:52:24.949 --> 00:52:27.750
a worldview that just sort of keeps them stably

1052
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:30.479
hopeless, um, and I, you know, I think that's

1053
00:52:30.479 --> 00:52:34.899
why this does, uh, as we see, like, often

1054
00:52:35.229 --> 00:52:38.270
result in self-harm or violence towards others, right? I

1055
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:43.479
think, uh, so it is a very negative. Um,

1056
00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.560
NEGATIVE, I think these are very negative communities for

1057
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.439
the men in them. Uh, AND again, I think

1058
00:52:47.439 --> 00:52:49.719
these worldviews are false, right? I think these are

1059
00:52:49.719 --> 00:52:53.719
based on misinterpretations of, of, uh, the science. I

1060
00:52:53.719 --> 00:52:56.270
think they're based on misinterpretations of society, and so

1061
00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.330
if we could debate to them what the science

1062
00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:01.479
actually says and show them the world is not

1063
00:53:01.479 --> 00:53:05.110
as hopeless as these, you know, like manosphere communities

1064
00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:07.969
are persuading them that it is, yeah, I do

1065
00:53:07.969 --> 00:53:08.959
think they would be better off.

1066
00:53:10.449 --> 00:53:13.409
Mhm. And I also think, I mean, just to

1067
00:53:13.409 --> 00:53:17.449
talk about a specific example, I think that sometimes

1068
00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:21.489
they might even hurt the chances of some of

1069
00:53:21.489 --> 00:53:25.080
these men who are attracted to the menosphere because

1070
00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:28.129
if you go on, I don't know, uh, or

1071
00:53:28.129 --> 00:53:30.679
if you listen to the Fresh and Fit podcast

1072
00:53:30.679 --> 00:53:33.659
or something along those lines and you hear, and

1073
00:53:33.659 --> 00:53:36.500
you constantly hear from them things like you have

1074
00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:39.274
to be, you have to go to the gym,

1075
00:53:39.354 --> 00:53:42.064
you have to have this chiseled body and face.

1076
00:53:42.125 --> 00:53:44.834
You have to wear expensive clothes, you have to

1077
00:53:44.834 --> 00:53:47.395
have an expensive car, you have to have a

1078
00:53:47.395 --> 00:53:50.955
six-figure salary, a good house, uh, and all of

1079
00:53:50.955 --> 00:53:53.435
those kinds of things. I mean, that, that, that's

1080
00:53:53.435 --> 00:53:56.864
not really true that you have to have all

1081
00:53:56.864 --> 00:54:00.635
of those things to be successful in the mating

1082
00:54:00.635 --> 00:54:02.915
market. And perhaps some of the men who listen

1083
00:54:02.915 --> 00:54:07.280
to this just Uh, just quit because they can't

1084
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.870
have access to all of those things, I guess,

1085
00:54:10.159 --> 00:54:14.949
yeah, yeah, uh, it's true, it's true, um, yeah,

1086
00:54:14.959 --> 00:54:17.229
uh, and I, I don't, I don't. I don't

1087
00:54:17.229 --> 00:54:21.399
get it. I don't get. This is maybe my

1088
00:54:21.399 --> 00:54:23.030
failure. Maybe this is why, like, I didn't become

1089
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:24.929
an incel or something, but like I, I just

1090
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:27.590
Like, you look at these guys who are telling

1091
00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:29.800
you like this is the like secret to like

1092
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.350
happiness and relationship success like these people aren't happy,

1093
00:54:32.429 --> 00:54:35.590
they're not having relationship success and like look like

1094
00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:37.510
again it's like you're like a, you know, incel

1095
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:41.300
curious person watching this, like, I like not to

1096
00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.590
do my own horn, but like I'm an expert

1097
00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:45.620
in human mating psychology. uh I do good work,

1098
00:54:45.709 --> 00:54:48.550
I think, in these areas. I have like, you

1099
00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:52.790
know, I have some ideas about how human mating

1100
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:54.989
relationships work that other people, you know, seem to

1101
00:54:54.989 --> 00:54:58.239
think. Uh, ARE onto something, and also like, I'm,

1102
00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:02.780
I'm like a ugly chubby dork, uh, who like

1103
00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:04.100
does not make a ton of money. I'm an

1104
00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:06.860
academic, like, and I, you know, I'm happily married.

1105
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.020
I'm, I'm, I'm happy, right? My wife and I

1106
00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:12.060
had been together for 14 years or something like

1107
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.250
that, right, like. Like these people who are selling

1108
00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:17.729
you this worldview, like, they don't have what they're

1109
00:55:17.729 --> 00:55:22.300
selling you, right? I do, right? I'm, I'm the

1110
00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:25.169
established expert on human mating psychology, and I, you

1111
00:55:25.169 --> 00:55:26.570
know, I've been living a good life. I have

1112
00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:27.810
a good, I have a relationship, like you don't,

1113
00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:29.370
yeah, you don't need to like go to the

1114
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:30.370
gym if you want to go to the gym,

1115
00:55:30.489 --> 00:55:32.090
like, you know, work out if that makes you

1116
00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:33.770
happy, it's good to be healthy, you should take

1117
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:37.010
care of your body, but like, you don't need

1118
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:40.110
to be this like weird vision of this alpha

1119
00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:41.860
male chad, that's not even what women are actually

1120
00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:45.540
looking for. Uh, AND the data supports that, right,

1121
00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:48.370
like these people, these people are lying to you,

1122
00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:50.810
like you, you don't need to believe these things.

1123
00:55:51.709 --> 00:55:54.820
Right. So what do you think should be done

1124
00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:59.580
by evolutionary psychologists themselves to fight back against the

1125
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:01.770
misuse of their own research?

1126
00:56:02.979 --> 00:56:09.810
I don't know. Um, uh, I don't know. Um.

1127
00:56:10.659 --> 00:56:12.840
You know, I, I think step one is at

1128
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.159
least acknowledging it, right? Uh, I think, you know,

1129
00:56:16.239 --> 00:56:18.000
like I said, for a long time, I was

1130
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.800
sort of vaguely aware the stuff was out there,

1131
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:21.620
but I was, I was very happy to keep

1132
00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:24.040
it at arm's length, um, and I think that

1133
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.070
was the wrong idea, right? Um, CAUSE I think

1134
00:56:27.139 --> 00:56:29.439
if we, as long as we ignore it, it

1135
00:56:29.439 --> 00:56:32.560
just kind of, it festers on its own, right?

1136
00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:35.040
Like these communities are gonna keep taking our science,

1137
00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.560
they're gonna keep cherry picking and misquoting and misinterpreting

1138
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.280
it. Uh, AND it's just gonna, it's gonna take

1139
00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.760
on a weird life of its own, um, which

1140
00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.879
is gonna, you know, contribute to this harm, and

1141
00:56:45.879 --> 00:56:47.709
I think it's also gonna reflect back on the,

1142
00:56:47.719 --> 00:56:50.159
the reputation of the field. So I, I don't

1143
00:56:50.159 --> 00:56:53.709
think we can ignore it, um. You know, I,

1144
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:58.870
I don't think, um, Again, I think we have

1145
00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:02.189
to be careful though with how we engage these

1146
00:57:02.189 --> 00:57:06.560
communities. I think there are people out there who,

1147
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:10.030
with uh sometimes good intentions, uh, but I think

1148
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:13.550
have tried to like approach these communities from a

1149
00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:16.870
scientific background, um, but do it in a way

1150
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:20.080
that I think ends up legitimizing these ideologies or

1151
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.469
legitimizing these worldviews. Uh, AGAIN, I, I, I, you

1152
00:57:23.469 --> 00:57:27.110
have to be careful with how you Broach those

1153
00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:29.300
conversations and broach those debates. So I don't think

1154
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:32.739
like evolutionary psychologists should be going out there and

1155
00:57:32.739 --> 00:57:36.580
like having debates with like manosphere influencers or going

1156
00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:39.010
on manosphere podcasts and like trying to show them

1157
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:41.260
the way cause I, I think that that gives

1158
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:45.239
these people clout that they don't deserve, um. So

1159
00:57:45.239 --> 00:57:46.959
I, I don't have the right answer here. I'm

1160
00:57:46.959 --> 00:57:49.280
not confident that I've done the right thing, you

1161
00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.090
know, my, my gut reaction was, you know, I,

1162
00:57:52.199 --> 00:57:55.510
I do think Uh, one good thing we can

1163
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:59.800
do is just be vocal that like we do

1164
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:04.709
not agree with these ideologies, right? Like, despite what

1165
00:58:04.709 --> 00:58:07.389
you might read on, you know, the red pill

1166
00:58:07.389 --> 00:58:09.790
subreddit or what you might read in the scientific

1167
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:12.350
black pill community like we as a scientists, as

1168
00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:15.659
scientists I think have a minimum obligation. Of just,

1169
00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:19.439
you know, publicly and loudly saying, right, like, we

1170
00:58:19.439 --> 00:58:21.639
are the ones doing the science and we do

1171
00:58:21.639 --> 00:58:25.330
not think the science necessarily leads to these ideologies.

1172
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Some scientists may disagree. They're wrong, but that's fine.

1173
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.899
People are allowed to be wrong, but like I,

1174
00:58:30.959 --> 00:58:33.239
I think it's important for those of us who

1175
00:58:33.239 --> 00:58:35.800
are level headed and reasonable and right about these

1176
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.639
things, to at least like publicly say it, like,

1177
00:58:38.679 --> 00:58:41.800
come out and say like, I don't think that

1178
00:58:41.899 --> 00:58:45.139
these scientific findings necessarily lead to this worldview, because

1179
00:58:45.139 --> 00:58:46.699
that at least makes it that much a little

1180
00:58:46.699 --> 00:58:50.810
bit harder uh for these mantisphere communities to appropriate

1181
00:58:50.810 --> 00:58:55.020
uh these ideologies, right? If we scientists aren't at

1182
00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:58.659
least showing that there's disagreement among the scientists, uh,

1183
00:58:58.719 --> 00:59:00.340
if we aren't showing that like you can be

1184
00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:03.939
an evolutionary psychologist and not be anti anti-feminist and

1185
00:59:03.939 --> 00:59:07.620
not be a misogynist, then I think that silence,

1186
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:10.959
you know, speaks volumes to. You know, I'm thinking

1187
00:59:10.959 --> 00:59:13.580
about like, you know, a 15 year old kid

1188
00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:16.909
who's like, you know, just starting out his like

1189
00:59:16.909 --> 00:59:18.939
dating career, and it's not going the way that

1190
00:59:18.939 --> 00:59:20.979
he wants it to, and he's frustrated and he's

1191
00:59:20.979 --> 00:59:24.620
depressed, and he's looking for an explanation for what's

1192
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.810
happening to him and how to do better, and,

1193
00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:30.169
you know, if you go into these incel communities

1194
00:59:30.169 --> 00:59:33.320
and you see these like pseudo scientific You know,

1195
00:59:33.489 --> 00:59:36.889
justifications for this worldview, and then you go to

1196
00:59:36.889 --> 00:59:39.209
the scientists and the scientists are saying nothing. The

1197
00:59:39.209 --> 00:59:43.290
scientists, you know, aren't at least disagreeing with these

1198
00:59:43.290 --> 00:59:45.850
things. They aren't at a minimum saying, uh, I

1199
00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:47.570
don't think that's how you interpret these things, but

1200
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:49.169
then they, you know, that is sort of like

1201
00:59:49.169 --> 00:59:53.209
tacit approval of these these ideologies, right? So I

1202
00:59:53.209 --> 00:59:54.750
think we as scientists at a minimum have an

1203
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:57.879
obligation to come out and say clearly in public,

1204
00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.149
which I tried to do, um. That like you

1205
01:00:01.149 --> 01:00:03.350
don't have to draw these interpretations out of this

1206
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:06.270
worldview. Um, YOU know, I, I think I've been

1207
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:09.379
accused of saying that like, Uh, I, I don't

1208
01:00:09.379 --> 01:00:11.899
know that like scientists should like self-censor for this

1209
01:00:11.899 --> 01:00:14.979
reason or something like that, like, you know, that

1210
01:00:14.979 --> 01:00:17.820
I think we should like not study certain topics

1211
01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:19.780
or something like that. I think that's stupid. Like,

1212
01:00:20.139 --> 01:00:23.659
look at my CV like uh I certainly don't

1213
01:00:23.659 --> 01:00:25.860
think we should avoid studying these topics. I think

1214
01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.860
these topics are really important, but I think we

1215
01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:30.459
just need to be clear as we're studying these

1216
01:00:30.459 --> 01:00:34.290
things, um. And again, like I don't think, I

1217
01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:36.610
don't think we should necessarily be making policy recommendations

1218
01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:40.570
either. I'm not qualified to dictate public policy. I'm

1219
01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:44.409
not qualified, uh, you know, to write like divorce

1220
01:00:44.409 --> 01:00:46.850
laws or I'm not qualified to give dating advice

1221
01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:49.370
even, like I am not, I'm not that kind

1222
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:51.870
of person. Uh, SO I don't think evolutionary psychologists

1223
01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:53.149
need to be going out there and saying this

1224
01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:55.659
is the ideology that I think my work supports,

1225
01:00:55.949 --> 01:00:57.949
uh, but I do think, you know, especially when

1226
01:00:57.949 --> 01:01:01.580
people are perverting our work to support harmful ideologies,

1227
01:01:01.629 --> 01:01:02.909
I think we do have an obligation to come

1228
01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:05.629
out, come out publicly and say no, that is

1229
01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:08.310
not, you know, at least a necessary interpretation of

1230
01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:09.370
what my science says.

1231
01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:13.699
Mhm. So as a last question, let me just

1232
01:01:13.699 --> 01:01:16.939
put this through you to see what you, what

1233
01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:19.989
are your ideas about it. So, in the psychology

1234
01:01:19.989 --> 01:01:24.580
today post titled Combating the Misuse of Evolutionary Psychology

1235
01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:27.860
Research, Andrew Thomas, who I've already had on the

1236
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:32.489
show, is, is also an evolutionary psycho. He suggests

1237
01:01:32.489 --> 01:01:37.560
three ways by which researchers can address misinterpretations. And

1238
01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.969
the first one is avoid absolutes. The second one

1239
01:01:40.969 --> 01:01:45.770
is emphasize similarities, not just differences. And the last

1240
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:49.199
one is highlight agencies. So what do you think

1241
01:01:49.199 --> 01:01:49.810
of that?

1242
01:01:52.149 --> 01:01:58.030
I think I think, uh, Those are good first

1243
01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:01.469
steps, um, you know, I think those are just,

1244
01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:06.100
that's just good science, right? Um, I think, uh,

1245
01:02:06.469 --> 01:02:12.000
as scientists. We shouldn't be issuing absolutes anyway, right?

1246
01:02:12.179 --> 01:02:15.159
Uh, SCIENCE doesn't, you know, it isn't math, right?

1247
01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:18.070
We can't prove things, um, you know, we work

1248
01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:23.479
in trends and expectations and generalities, um, and so

1249
01:02:23.479 --> 01:02:26.780
avoiding absolutes is, is just, you know, how you

1250
01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:28.909
should do your science to begin with, regardless of,

1251
01:02:29.159 --> 01:02:31.719
you know, manosphere communities or whatever, um, and I

1252
01:02:31.719 --> 01:02:36.899
do think, uh, again, this is, uh, A common

1253
01:02:36.899 --> 01:02:39.139
place where you see the research getting lost in

1254
01:02:39.139 --> 01:02:41.060
translation as it makes it out to these manosphere

1255
01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:44.770
communities. Like I do think Especially if you're not

1256
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.879
especially statistically savvy, especially if you're not like immersed

1257
01:02:47.879 --> 01:02:50.439
in this kind of data, you know, day in,

1258
01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.520
day out, and have a good intuition for what

1259
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.060
these data mean, uh. A lot of the effect

1260
01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:01.060
sizes in like the statistical effect sizes in human

1261
01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:05.260
mating literature are really small, uh, like, and that

1262
01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.340
gets lost in translation as it makes it out

1263
01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:10.300
onto like the scientific black pill wiki, right? Like

1264
01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.340
you would think by reading these sort of like

1265
01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:15.324
narrative description of what evolution. PSYCHOLOGISTS are finding, yeah,

1266
01:03:15.405 --> 01:03:18.274
you would think that these are like large absolute

1267
01:03:18.274 --> 01:03:20.685
differences. But then when you actually look at the

1268
01:03:20.685 --> 01:03:22.564
data, like a lot of the differences we're talking

1269
01:03:22.564 --> 01:03:25.004
about are pretty small because human behavior is complicated.

1270
01:03:25.044 --> 01:03:28.764
It's always caused by multiple factors when multiple factors

1271
01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:32.084
cause something, each one necessarily has a smaller impact.

1272
01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.879
Uh, AND so I think being clear, it's hard

1273
01:03:35.879 --> 01:03:37.800
to make this clear. It's hard to like grok

1274
01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.800
intuitively what like a coins D of point to

1275
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.669
means, but like I promise you it's pretty small.

1276
01:03:43.959 --> 01:03:45.959
Like that's the kind of difference that you can

1277
01:03:45.959 --> 01:03:49.320
notice, uh, you know, in a carefully controlled scientific.

1278
01:03:50.094 --> 01:03:52.034
But you're probably not going to notice very much

1279
01:03:52.034 --> 01:03:54.135
as you're walking down the street, right, with your

1280
01:03:54.135 --> 01:03:57.554
human eye. So I think, you know, psychologists in

1281
01:03:57.554 --> 01:04:01.514
general could do a better job of being clear

1282
01:04:01.514 --> 01:04:04.284
about what, how big are the effects we're actually

1283
01:04:04.284 --> 01:04:05.995
studying, what do these actually mean for people's day

1284
01:04:05.995 --> 01:04:08.435
to day lives? Um, SO I think that's, that's

1285
01:04:08.435 --> 01:04:11.879
a good thing to be mindful of. Um. And

1286
01:04:11.879 --> 01:04:14.949
I do think evolutionary psychologists. Again, for good reasons,

1287
01:04:14.969 --> 01:04:17.409
sex differences are important and, you know, they do

1288
01:04:17.409 --> 01:04:21.090
provide like good theoretical leverage in terms of like

1289
01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:24.760
testing ideas about uh the nature of the mind,

1290
01:04:24.879 --> 01:04:27.290
but evolutionary psychologists, I do think have way overemphasized

1291
01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:29.530
sex differences. I say this as a person who's

1292
01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:31.969
done a lot of sex differences research, who has

1293
01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:34.649
some sex difference research ongoing. Like, I think these

1294
01:04:34.649 --> 01:04:36.919
things matter, but I, I do think we've like,

1295
01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:40.939
um. We studied sex differences to the exclusion of

1296
01:04:40.939 --> 01:04:44.139
actually studying psychology, uh, to some degree, and I

1297
01:04:44.139 --> 01:04:45.620
do think the field could use a bit of

1298
01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:48.139
a course correction on that. Again, I think that's

1299
01:04:48.139 --> 01:04:50.300
true independent of the manosphere, right? I, I think

1300
01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:53.459
there's just a lot of things, um. There's a

1301
01:04:53.459 --> 01:04:56.340
lot of things where, yeah, I think we've studied

1302
01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:59.379
differences in the psychology, but we forgot to study

1303
01:04:59.379 --> 01:05:01.370
how the psychology actually works in the first place,

1304
01:05:01.379 --> 01:05:02.739
and so I, I do think that's a good

1305
01:05:02.739 --> 01:05:07.870
idea. Agency. Um, I think it's a weird one,

1306
01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:12.419
that's like that's maybe a more philosophical thing, uh,

1307
01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:16.550
you know, uh, you know, I, I, I don't

1308
01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:18.669
understand how one can be a professional psychologist and

1309
01:05:18.669 --> 01:05:21.110
believe in free will, uh, but you know, I

1310
01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:23.919
think where agency comes in, where agency gets lost

1311
01:05:23.919 --> 01:05:26.209
in translation again is I think the sort of

1312
01:05:26.209 --> 01:05:30.560
manosphere. Uh, TAKE on things is generally like men

1313
01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.840
have agency and women do not, right? And so

1314
01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:35.020
I think like if you're gonna focus on agency,

1315
01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.199
you either need to, uh, yeah, be clear on

1316
01:05:38.199 --> 01:05:41.209
everybody's agency, or you need to be clear on,

1317
01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:44.919
you know, no one's agency, right? Um, YOU know,

1318
01:05:44.959 --> 01:05:46.550
at the end of the day, like, yeah, I'm

1319
01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:48.959
a psychologist. I think behavior is caused, and I

1320
01:05:48.959 --> 01:05:51.949
think we can scientifically understand those causes. Um, I

1321
01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:55.439
don't think that provides, you know, excuse from moral

1322
01:05:55.439 --> 01:05:58.479
culpability for your behavior. Um, BUT I think, you

1323
01:05:58.479 --> 01:06:01.399
know, you certainly don't want to be, uh, projecting

1324
01:06:01.399 --> 01:06:03.629
an image that like women are sort of like

1325
01:06:03.629 --> 01:06:07.080
slaves to their genetic interests, but men are sort

1326
01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.879
of endowed with mystical free will that allows them

1327
01:06:09.879 --> 01:06:12.479
to to to make good decisions or something like

1328
01:06:12.479 --> 01:06:15.120
that. Um, YOU know, I, I, so I think

1329
01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.719
those are all good scientific recommendations. I don't think

1330
01:06:18.719 --> 01:06:22.159
that goes far enough though, right? I, I think.

1331
01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.850
Uh, WE as evolutionary psychologists do need to look

1332
01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:29.739
inward, um, and we do need to be, we

1333
01:06:29.739 --> 01:06:31.409
do need to be more careful with our language.

1334
01:06:31.719 --> 01:06:33.540
Uh, WE do need to be more careful, I

1335
01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:38.179
think, with the kinds of, uh, you know, topics

1336
01:06:38.179 --> 01:06:40.419
that we pursue that like like we are actually

1337
01:06:40.419 --> 01:06:42.739
pursuing things that are in the public interest and

1338
01:06:42.739 --> 01:06:45.449
that we're talking about them in ways that, um,

1339
01:06:45.459 --> 01:06:49.199
cannot be easily appropriated uh in these harmful ways,

1340
01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:53.110
um, but I think There's only so much we

1341
01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:56.270
can do like within ourselves. Like you can write

1342
01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:59.830
your paper as carefully as you want. If someone

1343
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:02.709
wants to appropriate it, they're going to, right? There's

1344
01:07:02.709 --> 01:07:05.699
no magic set of words that you can say

1345
01:07:05.949 --> 01:07:08.270
that is gonna prevent, you know, a grifter or

1346
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:11.310
an ideologue from perverting it in some way that

1347
01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:15.070
suits their interests. So I think those are things

1348
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:17.229
that are worth doing, but I think there is

1349
01:07:17.229 --> 01:07:20.030
something more we have to do. I don't know

1350
01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.320
what that is, right? I don't think those recommendations

1351
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.399
are enough. Like I said, I think part of

1352
01:07:25.399 --> 01:07:27.739
it is we do have to stick our necks

1353
01:07:27.739 --> 01:07:30.040
out a little bit. We do have to, you

1354
01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:33.199
know, get in front of the public and, you

1355
01:07:33.199 --> 01:07:36.679
know, object to our research being used in ways

1356
01:07:36.679 --> 01:07:41.340
that we do not endorse, um. Cause, yeah, I,

1357
01:07:41.409 --> 01:07:43.570
I don't think there's any, any way of writing

1358
01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:45.530
your paper that's gonna prevent that from happening. At

1359
01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:47.050
some point you need to get up and say,

1360
01:07:47.169 --> 01:07:49.330
like, no, I think that's wrong, don't use my

1361
01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:49.969
research this way.

1362
01:07:51.729 --> 01:07:55.489
Great. So let's send on that note then. And

1363
01:07:55.489 --> 01:07:57.810
uh just before we go, would you like to

1364
01:07:57.810 --> 01:08:00.669
tell people where they can find your work on

1365
01:08:00.669 --> 01:08:03.010
the internet? And I don't know, would you have

1366
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:06.889
any suggestions if people are interested in learning more

1367
01:08:06.889 --> 01:08:11.540
about the specific topic on the manere and the

1368
01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:15.860
misappropriation or the misuse of evolutionary psychology?

1369
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:18.819
Yeah, I mean, you can find my work on

1370
01:08:18.819 --> 01:08:21.939
my website Dan Conroybeam.com. We have all of our

1371
01:08:21.939 --> 01:08:23.689
papers there if you're interested in reading the primary

1372
01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:26.339
literature, you can also follow me on Blue Sky

1373
01:08:26.339 --> 01:08:28.850
De Conroy Beam is my handle on all socials.

1374
01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.500
Um, YOU know, if you're interested in evolutionary psychology,

1375
01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.979
I'd go straight to the source, you know, read

1376
01:08:33.979 --> 01:08:36.379
up on the Center for Evolutionary Psychology website. There's

1377
01:08:36.379 --> 01:08:39.339
a premiere there that's like a great basic introduction

1378
01:08:39.339 --> 01:08:42.368
to like the core principles of the field. Um,

1379
01:08:42.377 --> 01:08:44.139
AND if you're interested in this sort of like

1380
01:08:44.139 --> 01:08:47.707
intersections between uh evolutionary psychology and the manosphere, honestly,

1381
01:08:47.818 --> 01:08:50.328
you know, I, I could not recommend the person

1382
01:08:50.328 --> 01:08:52.499
who got me into this, right? Louis Baho and

1383
01:08:52.499 --> 01:08:54.258
his work, I think has been really eye opening

1384
01:08:54.258 --> 01:08:55.898
for me, uh, I think it is a great

1385
01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:57.337
place to learn more, and, you know, I gave

1386
01:08:57.337 --> 01:09:00.514
a plug to. FD signifier before, uh, you know,

1387
01:09:00.554 --> 01:09:02.792
I've watched the rest of Ricardo's interviews as well,

1388
01:09:02.863 --> 01:09:04.953
but I'd also check out FD signifier. He's also

1389
01:09:04.953 --> 01:09:07.594
like interviewed evolutionary psychologist before. I think he's a

1390
01:09:07.594 --> 01:09:11.002
thoughtful guy who has really interesting perspectives on, on

1391
01:09:11.002 --> 01:09:13.394
science and society in the metasphere. So I've enjoyed

1392
01:09:13.394 --> 01:09:14.344
his content too.

1393
01:09:15.509 --> 01:09:17.629
Great. So I will be leaving links to all

1394
01:09:17.629 --> 01:09:19.750
of that in the description of the interview and

1395
01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:23.589
also to our first interview. So Doctor Konrahim, thank
