00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.119
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:06.079
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes and

3
00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:08.720
today I'm joined by Doctor Vicky O. She is

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.159
an associate professor in the Anthropology department and director

5
00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:15.965
of the Primate Ecology and molecular Anthropology lab. At

6
00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:19.735
the University of California Santa Cruz. And today we're

7
00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:23.364
going to talk mostly about the evolution of the

8
00:00:23.364 --> 00:00:27.795
human diet or of human diets in the plural.

9
00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:30.524
So, Vicky, welcome to the show. It's a huge

10
00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:31.364
pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.840
Yeah, thank you Ricardo for inviting me. Uh, I'm

12
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.200
very excited to, and I'm very curious if I

13
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.840
can answer like the many questions that you have.

14
00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:42.759
Uh, I saw that you, you, you want to

15
00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:45.669
dive into deep time with me, so, so let's

16
00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:46.110
go.

17
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.509
Yeah, sure. So let's start with this. How can

18
00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:57.069
we study human diets through archaeological and fossil remains?

19
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.470
I mean, what do we look at and what

20
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.790
kinds of evidence can we find in the fossil

21
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.489
remains?

22
00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.430
Right? So like what kind of methods we can

23
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.434
actually. Employ, right? So, so let me like kind

24
00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:13.544
of clarify what we're, we're talking about. So like,

25
00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:15.735
uh, if we're talking about the evolution of the

26
00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:19.074
human diet, right, uh, we're like much more like

27
00:01:19.074 --> 00:01:23.114
temporarily, uh, constrained if we think about that, we're

28
00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:26.355
thinking that, um, our own species Homo sapiens probably

29
00:01:26.355 --> 00:01:31.760
evolved. Uh, EARLIER than, uh, 300,000 years ago, right?

30
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.889
Um, BUT a lot of people that, um, are

31
00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:38.529
studying actually, uh, the evolution of the human diet

32
00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:41.489
go much, much further back into time, right? So

33
00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:45.739
we're actually like looking further into, um, our more

34
00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:49.220
ancestral. Uh, LINEAGE of our species, right, like looking

35
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.610
into, uh, early Homo and all the other, uh,

36
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.900
hominin species that we know of in South and,

37
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.529
uh, East Africa, um, that are, you know, our,

38
00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:03.459
our, uh, cousins and sister Texans, uh, in early

39
00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.250
human evolution and so. The, the spectrum of methods

40
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.289
that we as uh biological anthropologists use is actually

41
00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.130
like um uh it's actually a pretty big tool

42
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.490
kit and increasingly, uh, scholars are using many different

43
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.899
lines of evidence about the dietary adaptations of uh

44
00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:30.460
fossil hominins, uh, or, uh, early humans, um. Uh,

45
00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:32.330
TO kind of like have a, a bigger picture,

46
00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.820
right? And so one of the methods that allows

47
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.210
us actually to go pretty deep into time is

48
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.960
the one, that I'm specialist in, which is, uh,

49
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.449
isotope analysis. Uh, AND so I'm happy to talk

50
00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.690
about that much more. But, um, just to give

51
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.110
you a little bit more of a framework, there

52
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.660
are many other methods that we actually look at.

53
00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:56.330
So, um, before isotopes were kind of like on

54
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.345
the table, uh, as a, as a Biomolecular tool

55
00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:04.024
to look into diet. We mainly were looking at

56
00:03:04.024 --> 00:03:09.695
the morphology of these um early fossil hominins, uh,

57
00:03:09.705 --> 00:03:14.774
looking particularly at their mastication apparatus and their teeth,

58
00:03:14.904 --> 00:03:18.865
right? Because the, the size and shape, uh, so

59
00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:22.304
the morphology of the teeth actually say a lot

60
00:03:22.304 --> 00:03:26.264
about what a given critter, uh, is evolved to

61
00:03:26.264 --> 00:03:29.949
consume. Um, AND along with like just like the

62
00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.270
morphology of the teeth, but also like the whole

63
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.710
mastication apparatus. Another way of looking into, um, the

64
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.789
dietary adaptations of, of creatures is to actually look

65
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:45.600
at dental wear, right? So if We're using our

66
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.729
teeth as animals to process foods, right? Like so

67
00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:55.610
our teeth are actually this incredible interface that we

68
00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.830
have between the environment. That the ecosystem that provides

69
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.259
the food resources and our own body, right? Like

70
00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.460
that first point of contact uh is actually the

71
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.020
dentition. And so the teeth often leave a lot

72
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.949
of very, very interesting. Traces of what has been

73
00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:20.108
chewed in the terms of scratch marks and and

74
00:04:20.108 --> 00:04:24.700
pits uh that form um through the consumption of

75
00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:28.500
maybe soft foods, but particularly through uh hard and

76
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.239
tough, uh, and abrasive foods. Um, SO then, besides.

77
00:04:34.299 --> 00:04:36.489
These two lines of evidence. So also in the

78
00:04:36.489 --> 00:04:38.820
microware world, there has been a lot of like

79
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.010
incredible, uh, work over the last like, uh, decade

80
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.489
or two in terms of really going into like

81
00:04:44.489 --> 00:04:49.209
the micro surface texture that, uh, is associated with

82
00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:52.570
eating different kinds of foods. Uh, WHAT I'm specialized

83
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.700
in, as I already said, is isotopes. And in

84
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.329
deep time, uh, we also work with teeth. Uh,

85
00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:03.510
SO when we are actually looking at the uh

86
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.820
biomolecular, uh, or, or sorry, biochemical signal that uh

87
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.144
we find in, uh, for example, uh, Early fossil,

88
00:05:13.295 --> 00:05:17.165
um, hominins, uh, or also later in, uh, Homo

89
00:05:17.165 --> 00:05:20.054
sapiens, uh, in our sister Texans, like, for example,

90
00:05:20.214 --> 00:05:25.654
uh, Neanderthals. Um, WE often like refer to tiny

91
00:05:25.654 --> 00:05:30.725
little pieces of the tooth enamel, um, and measure

92
00:05:30.975 --> 00:05:35.214
the isotope ratio of specific elements that are very

93
00:05:35.214 --> 00:05:39.255
abundant in our food and indicate something of the

94
00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:42.709
nature of the food that was eaten. And we

95
00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:45.350
rely on teeth, not because like the teeth are

96
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.980
having that interaction with the food items themselves, but

97
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.989
because the teeth, uh, are incorporating all the elements

98
00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:58.350
that we actually consume through food and also through

99
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.709
water, and they become deposited in our tooth, or

100
00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:09.619
teeth, um, where they mineralize and will remain locked

101
00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:14.450
for eternity. Which is uh really incredible. And so

102
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.239
that allows us actually to go very deep into

103
00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:20.049
time, for example, some of the very early prominences

104
00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:24.049
that have been analyzed for isotopes include, uh, you

105
00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:29.170
know, Ardipithecus hamius, you know, 4.2, 4.4 million years

106
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.489
somewhere around there, um, where we can actually like

107
00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:37.149
measure the biochemical signal in the tooth enamel. And

108
00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:41.989
say something about what categories of food uh these

109
00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:45.029
early hominins were consuming. In this case, like the

110
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:48.609
question was, are they living in an environment and

111
00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:52.869
consuming resources in an environment that's more uh uh

112
00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:56.269
forest like, more like a closed canopy, more moist

113
00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:58.500
environment, or is it like out in the open,

114
00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:03.429
more dry savanna landscape of East Africa. And so,

115
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.670
um, isotopes are, uh, a really, really important uh

116
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.950
tool that has been used like later, uh, or

117
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.619
in, in, um, a more recent, uh, time, uh,

118
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.190
epoch, uh, we can also, you know, move away

119
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.950
from just being able to work with teeth. We

120
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.595
can actually work. With bones, um, particularly by extracting

121
00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:28.915
the proteins out of the bones. Uh, SO the

122
00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:31.635
bones in our, uh, the bones and the proteins

123
00:07:31.635 --> 00:07:34.714
in our bones are really like derived from the

124
00:07:34.714 --> 00:07:38.035
proteins that we consume through food, right? And so

125
00:07:38.035 --> 00:07:41.309
there's this direct relationship here. And so a lot

126
00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:43.950
of work, for example, on uh Neanderthals, but also

127
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.670
early modern humans has been done in uh bone

128
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.350
collagen, where we look at uh the carbon and

129
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:56.799
nitrogen stable isotope ratios specifically to get an idea

130
00:07:56.799 --> 00:08:02.654
about the position of uh these species. um, IN,

131
00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:05.515
in their, in their food web, right? Are they

132
00:08:05.515 --> 00:08:09.394
herbivores? Uh, ARE they omnivores or are they like

133
00:08:09.394 --> 00:08:13.355
true carnivores, as we know now for a long

134
00:08:13.355 --> 00:08:15.475
time, for example, for, uh, a lot of groups

135
00:08:15.475 --> 00:08:18.454
of Neanderthals that they were really like top predator,

136
00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:23.850
um, carnivores. They also plants, but like we were

137
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.440
incredible uh hunters and meat eaters.

138
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.839
So, I have 2 or 3 follow-up questions to

139
00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:35.320
all of that. So the first one is, how

140
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.210
detailed of a picture can we get about the

141
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:43.599
specific ominence diet? I mean, can we pinpoint specific

142
00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:46.299
kinds of foods or can we only learn about

143
00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:50.380
some of the more General categories of foods that

144
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.940
it ate, uh, or perhaps if it was harder

145
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.169
or softer food or if it was more, uh,

146
00:08:58.179 --> 00:09:02.380
plant-based or meat-based. I mean, how much can we

147
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.299
extract in terms of information from fossils about diet?

148
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.890
Yeah, that's, that's exactly like the, the big, the

149
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.570
big question that we've been working on, uh, as

150
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.849
a scientific community for decades to actually like bring

151
00:09:16.849 --> 00:09:20.130
more tools into the tool kit to get more

152
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.169
and more precise with our, um, estimation and evaluation

153
00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:28.770
of past diets. Because each method is actually very

154
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.780
limited. And what we can say. So, and you're,

155
00:09:31.789 --> 00:09:35.140
you're really touching on this, um, we cannot say,

156
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:40.700
uh, this species was eating this, um, um, fruit

157
00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:44.989
or this specific herb, or they were eating this

158
00:09:44.989 --> 00:09:48.469
specific kind of mammal, right? But what we can

159
00:09:48.469 --> 00:09:52.559
say, for example, using, uh, isotope ratios. Is often

160
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.099
how much of the diet was composed of vegetation

161
00:09:58.099 --> 00:10:01.489
and how much was composed of, for example, the

162
00:10:01.489 --> 00:10:08.330
meat or other tissues of, uh, herbivorous animals, right?

163
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:12.929
So this, particularly with isotopes, it's really linked or

164
00:10:12.929 --> 00:10:15.849
our understanding of how we use the method is

165
00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:18.530
really want to understand how much they're actually consuming.

166
00:10:18.989 --> 00:10:23.919
Uh, MEAT versus, uh, vegetation, right? Uh, BECAUSE like

167
00:10:23.919 --> 00:10:26.469
in early human evolution, we have like this big

168
00:10:26.469 --> 00:10:29.289
debate about, you know, man the hunter or man

169
00:10:29.289 --> 00:10:32.309
the hunted, right? Um, THAT kind of like only

170
00:10:32.309 --> 00:10:35.820
resolves like around the time of. Homo erectus, where

171
00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:38.549
I think everybody has this consensus that we understand

172
00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:42.640
that they were indeed hunting, uh, possibly also still

173
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.599
scavenging opportunistically, but that they were very well uh

174
00:10:46.599 --> 00:10:50.669
able to hunt uh larger game. Uh, IN the

175
00:10:50.669 --> 00:10:54.690
earlier, uh, um, uh, hominin record, it is much

176
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.190
more tricky. Uh, SO in early Homo or Homo

177
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:02.630
habilis, it's not as, uh, clear how much these

178
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.469
guys are actually eating meat, but we would like

179
00:11:05.469 --> 00:11:09.940
to know. Because the whole hypothesis about um the,

180
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:14.030
the really incredible investment into brain growth, right, and

181
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.150
having like, uh, in our lineage, this trajectory towards

182
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.030
getting like bigger and bigger brains and becoming smarter

183
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:25.299
and smarter. The main hypothesis for the longest time

184
00:11:25.299 --> 00:11:28.020
has been that this was driven by consumption of

185
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.559
meat and then some people like made it a

186
00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:33.219
little bit more uh specific. It's not actually the

187
00:11:33.219 --> 00:11:36.690
meat is also it's just like high caloric um

188
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.895
animal resources. Like, for example, fat, right? If we

189
00:11:40.895 --> 00:11:44.695
think about like brain tissue is incredibly nutritious, that's

190
00:11:44.695 --> 00:11:48.645
not necessarily meat, um, uh, or also bone marrow,

191
00:11:48.734 --> 00:11:53.174
being incredibly rich in in fats, for example, and

192
00:11:53.174 --> 00:11:56.414
we don't consider that meat, right? Uh, AND the

193
00:11:56.414 --> 00:11:58.534
cool thing is like that, uh, we have this

194
00:11:58.534 --> 00:12:02.215
limitation, uh, in, in each method, but sometimes these

195
00:12:02.215 --> 00:12:05.054
methods that have a little bit of a complimentary

196
00:12:05.054 --> 00:12:08.099
information. So for example, as you already said, like

197
00:12:08.099 --> 00:12:13.979
for example, the uh uh dental wear analysis doesn't

198
00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:16.539
say something about like if meat or if plants

199
00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:19.539
were consumed, but is uh provides a lot of

200
00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:25.090
information if hard foods or tough foods were consumed,

201
00:12:25.299 --> 00:12:27.979
right? And so if you like different lines of

202
00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:32.309
evidence together, we have like this emerging. Picture if

203
00:12:32.309 --> 00:12:35.869
a certain diet was more likely. For example, if

204
00:12:35.869 --> 00:12:40.580
a specific specimen of early hominin was maybe eating

205
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.599
a little bit of meat, um, uh, or was,

206
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.630
uh, as we see in like some specimens, they

207
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:52.900
probably like seasonally eating like incredibly hard. Um, um,

208
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.630
FOOD resources where you can think about like, what

209
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.700
can that be? What, what kind of seed pod

210
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.630
or not is that hard that it would leave

211
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.549
these like indentations on the in the teeth, um.

212
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.119
So, uh, here, I would really like to also

213
00:13:08.119 --> 00:13:11.989
emphasize that, uh, method development is, uh, ongoing in

214
00:13:11.989 --> 00:13:14.280
this, uh, field of research, right, all these different

215
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.119
methods, they're getting like more and more luids and

216
00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:21.150
fine grained and, uh, getting to, um, the nature

217
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.479
of food resources, uh, that we can identify in

218
00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:28.780
the fossil record. Um, NAMELY, uh, in the isotope

219
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.700
world, we just recently had a gigantic breakthrough methodologically,

220
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.460
uh, by finally being able to measure nitrogen isotopes

221
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.729
into tooth enamel. So up to very recently, up

222
00:13:41.729 --> 00:13:44.320
to like a few years ago, we were limited

223
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.479
to measure carbon isotopes, uh, into the enamel of

224
00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:54.369
fossils and oxygen isotopes. Well, carbon isotopes actually in

225
00:13:54.369 --> 00:13:58.049
the archaeological record and the fossil record, basically only

226
00:13:58.049 --> 00:14:02.039
tell you something about, uh, a critter, um, being

227
00:14:02.039 --> 00:14:06.969
out, uh, foraging in an open savannah landscape that

228
00:14:06.969 --> 00:14:11.364
it's dominated by specific. um TYPE of grasses that

229
00:14:11.364 --> 00:14:14.674
has a different photosynthetic pathway, uh, we call them

230
00:14:14.674 --> 00:14:18.494
uh C4 grasses, and they have a very distinct

231
00:14:18.494 --> 00:14:22.965
carbon isotope signature compared to all the other plants

232
00:14:22.965 --> 00:14:27.155
on planet Earth that have a C3 photosynthetic pathway.

233
00:14:27.364 --> 00:14:29.484
And those plants, for example, uh, particularly in the

234
00:14:29.484 --> 00:14:33.155
African context, are more limited to a more denser

235
00:14:33.155 --> 00:14:39.049
woodlands and, and forest environments. So, so far, Carbon

236
00:14:39.049 --> 00:14:41.750
isotopes could only in combination with oxygen, tell us

237
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:46.419
something about if a hominin was thriving out in

238
00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:49.619
the savannah woodland, or if they were living in

239
00:14:49.619 --> 00:14:53.539
a forest, which again, is, you know, gives you

240
00:14:53.539 --> 00:14:56.140
an idea of what environment they utilize, which is

241
00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.450
valuable and very important, but it doesn't really get

242
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.739
to this question like, well, what are they actually

243
00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:07.559
eating? So, uh, since very recently, um, uh, some

244
00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:12.450
colleagues, uh, are able to measure nitrogen isotopes in

245
00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.359
tooth enamel, and that was a gigantic breakthrough because

246
00:15:16.359 --> 00:15:22.239
there's actually incredibly tiny amounts of nitrogen that are

247
00:15:22.239 --> 00:15:27.039
found in tooth enamel. So nitrogen is an element

248
00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:31.119
that is associated with protein, proteins in uh in,

249
00:15:31.159 --> 00:15:35.239
in the, in the body. Um, AND you maybe

250
00:15:35.239 --> 00:15:39.559
can imagine that in our white tooth enamel, and

251
00:15:39.559 --> 00:15:43.239
tooth crown, there's very little protein in there, right?

252
00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:46.000
That stuff doesn't really need to be flexible or

253
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.744
be able to bend to pressure. We want this

254
00:15:48.744 --> 00:15:50.864
stuff to be as hard as possible. So tooth

255
00:15:50.864 --> 00:15:55.744
enamel is actually the hardest um material that we

256
00:15:55.744 --> 00:15:59.104
have in the in the body, right? Which is

257
00:15:59.104 --> 00:16:01.465
why we can use it in such deep time

258
00:16:01.465 --> 00:16:05.580
context, which is awesome. However, nitrogen is actually the

259
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:12.219
isotope that has the biggest um differentiation between trophic

260
00:16:12.219 --> 00:16:15.140
levels. So in nitrogen, we can really see if

261
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.409
an animal is a an herbivore or a carnivore,

262
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.539
or if it's like an animal that's like somewhere

263
00:16:21.539 --> 00:16:26.820
intermediate, you know, utilizing both plants and animal resources

264
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.909
in the diet. And so it was really frustrating

265
00:16:29.909 --> 00:16:33.460
that given there's such tiny amounts of nitrogen in

266
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:38.280
enamel. It was kind of impossible for us to

267
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.429
measure these tiny amounts. And actually like when I

268
00:16:41.429 --> 00:16:45.349
um started working with isotopes uh as a student,

269
00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:48.599
um, it was never even mentioned really, right? Like

270
00:16:48.599 --> 00:16:52.020
in the in the chemical formula of um hydroxyappatite,

271
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.559
which makes tooth enamel, there's no nitrogen in there,

272
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.520
so we've never really talked about these tiny quantities

273
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.080
of nitrogen that are actually embedded in the mineral

274
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.719
matrix of uh the tooth enamel. And so, a

275
00:17:05.719 --> 00:17:08.760
really cool new method that was, uh, as far

276
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.079
as I understand, uh, developed at the University of

277
00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:15.290
Princeton. Uh, AND is now, uh, applied very widely,

278
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.050
uh, by my colleague Tina Ludike at the Max

279
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.500
Planck Institute for Chemistry. They, um, are utilizing this

280
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.140
new method where they hand over tiny amount of

281
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:32.859
tooth enamel to bacteria that target these tiny amounts

282
00:17:32.859 --> 00:17:36.130
of the nitrogen in the tooth enamel. They eat

283
00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:41.170
it up, and then they literally Uh, fart out

284
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.069
whatever they ate, uh, and then you can actually

285
00:17:45.069 --> 00:17:47.819
collect that, you know, kill the bacteria and then

286
00:17:47.819 --> 00:17:51.140
collect the gas that they were producing, and that's

287
00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.729
enough. Then to actually hand it over to a

288
00:17:53.729 --> 00:17:58.369
mass spectrometer and measure it. And so, uh, Tina's

289
00:17:58.369 --> 00:18:02.119
team uh at the Max Planck uh in uh

290
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.290
uh Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, they are now

291
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.810
starting to work on all of these fossil hominids

292
00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:12.560
that we have been speculating about for decades now,

293
00:18:12.729 --> 00:18:17.010
what their diet. Very, uh, adaptation actually looked like

294
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.449
with contradictory evidence coming from carbon isotopes or from

295
00:18:21.449 --> 00:18:24.609
dental wear, or from morphology and also like from

296
00:18:24.609 --> 00:18:29.489
the entire environmental context. And, um, they're not producing

297
00:18:29.489 --> 00:18:33.369
actually data for some of these fossil hominins. And

298
00:18:33.369 --> 00:18:37.930
from there you can see that it looks like

299
00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:43.829
some of these species were largely Herbivores, they are

300
00:18:43.829 --> 00:18:50.589
mainly determined like their main dietary everyday um uh

301
00:18:50.589 --> 00:18:55.859
adaptation was consuming plants, materials, uh, and then occasionally

302
00:18:55.859 --> 00:18:59.250
they also were consuming meat. And so like that

303
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.170
is kind of like um there will be a

304
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:05.079
lot of very, very uh incredible new papers published

305
00:19:05.079 --> 00:19:08.689
uh by, by this lab, um uh over the

306
00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:11.680
next few years uh as they like move through

307
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.550
analyzing all these, um, specimens, uh, from the archaeological

308
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:20.329
record in in eastern South Africa. Um, AND this

309
00:19:20.329 --> 00:19:24.145
is. Also where my work on, uh, extant chimpanzees

310
00:19:24.145 --> 00:19:27.244
actually comes in because like over the last decade

311
00:19:27.244 --> 00:19:30.234
or so, or maybe 15 years by now, um,

312
00:19:30.324 --> 00:19:35.915
I've been like trying to, um, demonstrate, uh, how

313
00:19:36.244 --> 00:19:39.834
these isotopes that we use to measure in uh

314
00:19:39.925 --> 00:19:43.989
the archaeological and fossil record. How they actually look

315
00:19:43.989 --> 00:19:48.079
like in chimpanzees today, right? And chimpanzees being like

316
00:19:48.079 --> 00:19:50.829
one of the animals out there that we use

317
00:19:50.829 --> 00:19:54.790
as a reference model for early human evolution, uh,

318
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.530
because there's so many things that are um. Um,

319
00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:02.050
YOU know, intriguing about chimpanzees, not just their ecology,

320
00:20:02.089 --> 00:20:05.040
but also like their comparable body size. They are,

321
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.140
uh, very, very social primate. They're tool users, right?

322
00:20:08.229 --> 00:20:11.530
They, they, they're, they're very uh sophisticated creatures that

323
00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:14.880
have culture. Um, AND so we're kind of like,

324
00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:18.609
uh, leaning very much on, um, and chimpanzees, they're

325
00:20:18.609 --> 00:20:21.380
not a perfect model, but they're very useful model.

326
00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:24.680
Um, AND I've been working a lot on kind

327
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.189
of developing an isotopic framework. Well, how do these

328
00:20:28.189 --> 00:20:33.079
isotopes actually, uh, look like in chimpanzees where we

329
00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:36.439
know what they're eating, we know how much meat

330
00:20:36.439 --> 00:20:41.640
they're eating, and how useful are these um biochemical

331
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.040
tools actually in detecting these low rates of meat

332
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.219
consumption. And my work has been a little bit

333
00:20:48.219 --> 00:20:53.410
critical uh about how useful um these isotopes actually

334
00:20:53.709 --> 00:20:56.020
uh are in this context, and I'm like happy

335
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.650
to talk about that, uh, a little bit more.

336
00:20:59.239 --> 00:21:02.439
Mhm. So, yeah, we're all, I'm also going to

337
00:21:02.439 --> 00:21:05.920
ask you about other great apes, particularly the closest

338
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.790
to us, that would be chimpanzees and bonobos. But

339
00:21:10.239 --> 00:21:12.839
uh let me ask you also in regards to

340
00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:18.599
dentition, uh, can we get information from TIFF by

341
00:21:18.599 --> 00:21:22.439
just looking, simply by looking at the types of

342
00:21:22.599 --> 00:21:26.800
dentition that a particular hominin species has, and I

343
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.060
mean, Looking at uh the different types of teeth,

344
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.699
the incisors, the canines, the premolars, and the molars,

345
00:21:34.709 --> 00:21:38.579
and perhaps the number of each type of teeth

346
00:21:38.579 --> 00:21:42.300
they have and uh perhaps dental anatomy as well.

347
00:21:42.339 --> 00:21:45.739
Can we just get information just from that?

348
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:51.699
Generally speaking, yes, um, but like, um, the, the

349
00:21:51.699 --> 00:21:55.819
primates, the primate order actually has uh a very

350
00:21:55.819 --> 00:22:00.020
generalized dentition. Uh, OUR teeth are, uh, so we

351
00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.420
have the same number of teeth, right? Like we

352
00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.410
share the same number of teeth with, uh, uh,

353
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.290
all great apes, uh, and with, um, uh, other,

354
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.714
uh, primates that are around. Planet Earth today. And

355
00:22:12.714 --> 00:22:14.954
we also have the same number and typology of

356
00:22:14.954 --> 00:22:18.234
teeth that we share with our, um, fossil hominid

357
00:22:18.234 --> 00:22:23.114
ancestors, right? Um, AND generally, like our dentition is

358
00:22:23.114 --> 00:22:26.474
quite generalized. Our teeth are good for pretty much

359
00:22:26.474 --> 00:22:30.604
everything and nothing, right? But it's true that, uh,

360
00:22:30.635 --> 00:22:36.239
particularly tooth size, uh, can be linked to Uh,

361
00:22:36.349 --> 00:22:41.420
how much we actually invested into chewing, right, mastication.

362
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.189
And so we have like some candidate species, for

363
00:22:44.189 --> 00:22:49.270
example, uh, parent parentthropus boisea, uh, that many of

364
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:52.349
your listeners may have heard about, uh, as Nutcracker

365
00:22:52.349 --> 00:22:56.145
man, um, uh, a Texan. Of uh hominids, uh,

366
00:22:56.175 --> 00:22:59.135
that we find in East Africa, and they have

367
00:22:59.135 --> 00:23:03.415
these gigantic mastication apparatus, these gigantic jaws and like

368
00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:06.685
really, really big teeth, including like very, very big

369
00:23:06.685 --> 00:23:10.734
molars. And so they are really like um teeth

370
00:23:10.734 --> 00:23:15.819
that look like they're like, um. Able to chop

371
00:23:15.819 --> 00:23:19.780
down and grind down like really either tough or

372
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.699
very hard um matter and then here we really

373
00:23:23.699 --> 00:23:28.349
think that they're more consuming. Uh, VEGETATION, right? And

374
00:23:28.349 --> 00:23:29.829
then the big question is like, what kind of

375
00:23:29.829 --> 00:23:34.910
vegetation and how can, uh, eating, um, a relatively

376
00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:38.979
poor vegetation matter that's very top, such as grasses,

377
00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.630
how on earth can that fuel the relatively large

378
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.739
brain that we find in this hominin species, right?

379
00:23:45.989 --> 00:23:49.619
So like parental poise, there is like, uh, um,

380
00:23:49.709 --> 00:23:52.079
a, a plethora of Incredible papers out there that

381
00:23:52.079 --> 00:23:55.709
are like showing like the contradiction of brain size

382
00:23:55.709 --> 00:24:00.670
and a mastication in, uh, this particular, uh, species.

383
00:24:00.959 --> 00:24:05.560
But generalized, uh, dentition, uh, means that, uh, our

384
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.939
teeth are not showing any evidence for being specialized,

385
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.520
for example, uh, as you would see in a

386
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:18.800
carnivore, to, um, Uh, to capture prey and bring

387
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.449
down prey, right? Like, so we don't have a

388
00:24:21.449 --> 00:24:25.000
teeth that suggests that we're carnivores, uh, and none

389
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.880
of the, uh, fossil hominids, right? So we don't,

390
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.719
um, for a long time we already have not

391
00:24:31.719 --> 00:24:35.920
these gigantic, um, uh, uh, canines that you, for

392
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.520
example, still see in chimpanzees, and chimpanzees probably also

393
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.375
don't have them for um. IN association with diet,

394
00:24:44.535 --> 00:24:46.974
right, chimpanzees still have like particularly the males, like

395
00:24:46.974 --> 00:24:50.494
relatively large canines. They're quite impressive and can do

396
00:24:50.494 --> 00:24:52.895
quite some harm, but they don't have them because

397
00:24:52.895 --> 00:24:55.694
of the fact that they occasionally hunt and bring

398
00:24:55.694 --> 00:24:58.994
down, um, a prey. They have it for male

399
00:24:58.994 --> 00:25:03.734
male competition. They basically just have it, um, so

400
00:25:03.734 --> 00:25:06.405
they can, you know, beat each other up, uh,

401
00:25:06.415 --> 00:25:10.189
better, right? Um, AND which makes sense because the

402
00:25:10.189 --> 00:25:12.670
females have like slightly, they still have like larger

403
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.589
uh canines than, than we do, but females have

404
00:25:15.589 --> 00:25:18.400
smaller canines than males do, which suggests that it's

405
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.310
not a dietary, um, uh, in relationship to diet,

406
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:27.030
but it is more related to sexual competition. Um,

407
00:25:27.469 --> 00:25:31.375
SO that said, the number of teeth. Is the

408
00:25:31.375 --> 00:25:36.344
same across all of us nutcracker men, chimpanzees, uh,

409
00:25:36.354 --> 00:25:39.484
us, nematas, we all have pretty much the same,

410
00:25:39.734 --> 00:25:43.574
a very, very similar, um, dentition, which is why,

411
00:25:43.854 --> 00:25:47.775
um, actually looking into the dental wear and isotope

412
00:25:47.775 --> 00:25:51.614
ratios, uh, is a, is a more, uh, useful

413
00:25:51.614 --> 00:25:54.045
proxy to help us solve this puzzle.

414
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:59.319
So earlier you mentioned chimpanzees. Is there any other

415
00:25:59.319 --> 00:26:02.479
great ape species that you also study?

416
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.869
Um, YEAH, so I'm actually like very, very, uh,

417
00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.520
lucky, uh, to be, uh, one of the people

418
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.560
who studies all African great apes, um, uh, using

419
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.920
isotopes. Um, SO, uh, I started working, um, on

420
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.489
bonobos, uh, and here really the question was, uh,

421
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.119
how does the isotopic. Profile of, uh, our closest

422
00:26:26.119 --> 00:26:29.989
cousin, right, chimpanzees and bonobos being our closest, um,

423
00:26:30.199 --> 00:26:34.000
living relatives, uh, on planet Earth today. And so

424
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.910
the question really was, uh, how does the isotopic

425
00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.469
profile for carbon and nitrogen isotopes of this, uh,

426
00:26:40.479 --> 00:26:44.949
incredible a species that's endemic to, um. The forest,

427
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.619
uh, of the Congo, south of the Congo River.

428
00:26:47.949 --> 00:26:50.310
How does it look like? Because, uh, just a

429
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.819
few years before that, uh, my colleagues actually, uh,

430
00:26:54.829 --> 00:26:59.699
made the first observations that Bonobos, uh, regularly hunt

431
00:27:00.069 --> 00:27:03.589
for, uh, primate prey. There was like before that

432
00:27:03.589 --> 00:27:08.979
some anecdotal information that bonobos were occasionally, you know,

433
00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:13.640
uh, capturing like some smaller. Animal, um, there's like

434
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.310
some early papers where, uh, researchers described Bonobos capturing

435
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.760
like a little tree squirrel or something like that,

436
00:27:20.949 --> 00:27:23.150
and then basically playing it to death. And then

437
00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.229
when the animal is dead, you know, oh, I

438
00:27:25.229 --> 00:27:28.069
might as well eat it, right? But, uh, my

439
00:27:28.069 --> 00:27:31.040
colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology,

440
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.510
uh, specifically at the site of Lucota, they really

441
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.670
made observations that these, uh, bonobos are not just

442
00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:41.260
occasionally using the opportunity. To grab a diker, which

443
00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.160
is a small forest antelope, uh, that often just

444
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.819
like hunkers down and so you can imagine it's

445
00:27:46.819 --> 00:27:50.459
actually easy to actually capture, relatively speaking, but they

446
00:27:50.459 --> 00:27:52.130
were actually like going up in the trees and

447
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.579
hunting for monkeys, right? And so like that kind

448
00:27:55.579 --> 00:27:59.849
of like. Changed our entire uh perception of bonobos,

449
00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:02.530
right, the species that we would normally refer to

450
00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:06.020
as make love not war. They're always chill, they,

451
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:10.170
um, uh, they, they're never showing aggression in any

452
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.920
kind, right? Like, no, they actually do hunt. Uh,

453
00:28:13.959 --> 00:28:19.000
ACTIVELY, and they kill, um, other primates, um, and

454
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.160
then more recently we actually know that the rates

455
00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.400
of male male aggression in bonobos is actually even

456
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.079
higher than what we see in, uh, chimpanzees. There

457
00:28:26.079 --> 00:28:28.310
was a really fascinating paper that came out, uh,

458
00:28:28.319 --> 00:28:30.800
last year or so, uh, or maybe 2 years

459
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.449
ago, uh, by now. Um, BUT so I first

460
00:28:34.449 --> 00:28:38.119
started working on bonobos just to see if using

461
00:28:38.119 --> 00:28:43.530
the stable isotope approach, measuring hair samples from sleeping

462
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:47.569
nests of these, uh, animals, do we detect these

463
00:28:47.569 --> 00:28:51.770
low amounts, uh, but, you know, reoccurring, uh, meat

464
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.729
eating events, uh, these low amounts of meat, do

465
00:28:54.729 --> 00:28:57.810
we detect that in their isotope profiles that we

466
00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:01.579
have? Uh, IN here. Um, AND that was my,

467
00:29:01.619 --> 00:29:04.699
my first, um, project on grade 8. I was

468
00:29:04.699 --> 00:29:07.619
still a PhD student by then, um, doing actually

469
00:29:07.619 --> 00:29:12.020
working on archaeological research questions. And, um, I would

470
00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.380
have to, I have to say no, we actually

471
00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.300
do not see, uh, any spikes in their nitrogen

472
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:22.219
isotope ratios after they had like a phase where

473
00:29:22.219 --> 00:29:26.489
they were doing a lot of hunting. Um, OR,

474
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.819
uh, we had like a very, very interesting phase,

475
00:29:29.979 --> 00:29:32.939
uh, that we could capture in that study, where

476
00:29:32.939 --> 00:29:36.369
for about a week, uh, there was, um, um,

477
00:29:36.459 --> 00:29:40.099
a caterpillar boom in the forest. Uh, SO there's

478
00:29:40.099 --> 00:29:42.060
apparently like, I don't know if it's, we don't

479
00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.170
even know if it's like one or several species

480
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:49.329
of butterflies that are just reproducing, uh, uh, over,

481
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.939
you know, they're, they're not seen for years and

482
00:29:51.939 --> 00:29:54.390
then you have like this one. SEASON where the

483
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.209
whole forest is just raining down with these gigantic

484
00:29:57.209 --> 00:30:00.349
caterpillars. And the bonobos were having, like, they were

485
00:30:00.349 --> 00:30:02.670
having a feast, you know, they were eating pounds

486
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:05.510
and pounds of these caterpillars every day. And I

487
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:09.550
measured the nitrogen isotope ratios of these caterpillars. And

488
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.250
you could see that, yeah, they are eating vegetation,

489
00:30:12.349 --> 00:30:15.750
so they are looking like a typical herbivore. So

490
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:18.780
they actually have a similar isotope signature as an

491
00:30:18.829 --> 00:30:24.359
antelope, a forest antelope would. Um, AND so the

492
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.239
prediction was then, well, if they're eating these caterpillars

493
00:30:28.239 --> 00:30:30.420
for a full week, we should see a meat

494
00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:34.439
eating response, right? Like the the nitrogen iso values

495
00:30:34.439 --> 00:30:37.939
of the bonobos eating them would spike in that

496
00:30:37.939 --> 00:30:41.910
time period, but it didn't. What we did see,

497
00:30:41.949 --> 00:30:46.930
however, was that um adolescent males that are um

498
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:51.270
relatively low ranking and bonobo society, right? Uh BONOBOS

499
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:55.510
are uh living in a matriarchy, so females having

500
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.550
a very, very strong bonds with each other that

501
00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:02.209
allow them uh to actually rule the, the community.

502
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:07.270
And so, adolescent and uh upcoming males are relatively

503
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:11.280
low in their social dominance uh rank in the

504
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.800
community. And we could see that yes, indeed their

505
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.760
nitrogen profiles were much lower than everybody else's, kind

506
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.199
of supporting the the observation that they often get

507
00:31:21.199 --> 00:31:24.239
kind of like left out of any meat eating.

508
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:28.849
Um, OPPORTUNITIES. So that was kind of the only

509
00:31:28.849 --> 00:31:34.880
indicator that we have that maybe nitrogen isotopes can

510
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.079
to some degree track the presence of presence or

511
00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:42.839
absence of meat in a great apes diet, but

512
00:31:42.839 --> 00:31:46.800
it was kind of like inconclusive, um. I then

513
00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.079
moved on uh to another really awesome opportunity to

514
00:31:51.079 --> 00:31:57.369
um do an isotopic study on, um. Lowland gorillas

515
00:31:57.369 --> 00:32:02.020
from Gabon, um, so, uh, western lowland gorillas that

516
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.890
are uh coexisting, so living in symmetry, uh, with,

517
00:32:06.979 --> 00:32:10.300
uh, chimpanzees, uh, in a field sites, uh, at

518
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.619
the Atlantic coast of Gabon, an incredible place called

519
00:32:13.619 --> 00:32:17.890
Loango, um, and here the question was a very,

520
00:32:17.939 --> 00:32:20.099
very different one. It was not really related to

521
00:32:20.099 --> 00:32:23.540
meat consumption, um, but we just wanted to see

522
00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:28.036
how much these uh Um, gorillas and chimpanzees that

523
00:32:28.036 --> 00:32:31.936
utilize a similar environment that overlap with each other

524
00:32:31.936 --> 00:32:35.936
dietarily, um, how much they actually overlap. And if

525
00:32:35.936 --> 00:32:38.255
there's maybe a seasonal difference in how much they

526
00:32:38.255 --> 00:32:43.125
overlap in their diet. Because, um, this kind of

527
00:32:43.495 --> 00:32:46.296
conflict or the question is like, is, is there

528
00:32:46.296 --> 00:32:50.095
like resource competition between gorillas and chimpanzees was like

529
00:32:50.095 --> 00:32:52.806
something that, uh, I thought was very, very interesting.

530
00:32:53.215 --> 00:32:56.112
Because we always think that Gorillas, oh yeah, you

531
00:32:56.112 --> 00:32:59.732
know, they just eat like terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, you

532
00:32:59.732 --> 00:33:01.371
know, they just sit around on the ground and

533
00:33:01.371 --> 00:33:04.812
just eat leaves. And that's absolutely not true. Particularly,

534
00:33:04.932 --> 00:33:07.582
uh, lowland gorillas actually eat a lot of ripe

535
00:33:07.582 --> 00:33:11.921
fruit. Um, AND from previous work, we knew that,

536
00:33:12.251 --> 00:33:15.131
uh, the gorillas in loanbo, yeah, they kind of

537
00:33:15.131 --> 00:33:17.452
like have a different feeding preference, so they like

538
00:33:17.452 --> 00:33:20.251
slightly different fruit than chimpanzees. But there are a

539
00:33:20.251 --> 00:33:22.732
lot of species of fruit that both chimpanzees and

540
00:33:22.732 --> 00:33:26.329
gorillas actually really like. And so you can imagine

541
00:33:26.329 --> 00:33:29.369
that there's a conflict potential, right? Like if these

542
00:33:29.369 --> 00:33:34.119
two species, um. Compete over the same resource. And

543
00:33:34.119 --> 00:33:36.760
so looking actually at the isotope ratios in the

544
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:41.160
hair of uh chimpanzees and gorillas from Luongo, we

545
00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.680
could see that they have a lot of like

546
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.640
ni niche partitioning, so they are like their dietary

547
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:51.199
profiles are separate with the gorillas eating indeed, much

548
00:33:51.199 --> 00:33:55.520
more terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, and the chimpanzees really being

549
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.239
much, much more specialized in ripe fruits, but there

550
00:33:58.239 --> 00:34:02.449
was also a lot of overlap. Um, PARTICULARLY seasonally,

551
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:04.650
there's like a couple of fruit species that they

552
00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:08.208
both like, and, uh, that might be like kind

553
00:34:08.208 --> 00:34:11.010
of like boring to kind of, uh, uh, look

554
00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:14.050
into the specifics of that, but just a couple

555
00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:16.810
of years ago, there was actually the first observation

556
00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:23.219
ever made of the chimpanzees at Loango actually killing

557
00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:27.360
uh a lowland gorilla, uh, it's at this specific

558
00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:31.149
field site, right? Um, WHICH was, uh, as far

559
00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:32.949
as I know, like was kind of like an

560
00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:35.510
open question, like, what, what do chimpanzees and gorillas

561
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:37.228
do when they bump into each other in the

562
00:34:37.228 --> 00:34:39.870
wild, right? And so we can assume that like

563
00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.629
if groups bump into each other, right particular gorillas

564
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:45.429
having like these enormous silverback males that are very

565
00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:49.569
capable. In defending their community and their family, um,

566
00:34:49.809 --> 00:34:52.368
that they would probably like avoid each other, right?

567
00:34:52.539 --> 00:34:55.539
Uh, JUST like we know, chimpanzees bumping into elephants,

568
00:34:55.618 --> 00:34:57.698
you know, they go like, Oh, we'd rather get

569
00:34:57.698 --> 00:34:59.878
out of here, right? But in this case, they

570
00:34:59.878 --> 00:35:04.128
actually bumped into a single individual. And the chimpanzees,

571
00:35:04.178 --> 00:35:09.269
they killed this gorilla, right? And so the, then

572
00:35:09.269 --> 00:35:14.239
the picture kind of works that. Um, YOU know,

573
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.959
showing this level of aggression to another species of

574
00:35:17.959 --> 00:35:21.739
great ape in their habitat. Actually makes a little

575
00:35:21.739 --> 00:35:25.070
bit of sense because they have dietary overlaps, so

576
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:29.189
they're competing over resources. And so um that was

577
00:35:29.189 --> 00:35:31.790
kind of like a um uh I hope that

578
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:33.949
my colleagues at Loango will not have to witness

579
00:35:33.949 --> 00:35:35.469
this again because I think it was a very

580
00:35:35.469 --> 00:35:39.659
horrible thing to actually see and uh observe. Um,

581
00:35:39.669 --> 00:35:42.179
BUT I think it's really interesting how, again, like

582
00:35:42.179 --> 00:35:46.250
the competition over food resources, how that obviously also,

583
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:50.260
uh, predicts, you know, social behavior and also social

584
00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.129
behavior or behavior between species.

585
00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:57.939
So when it comes to comparative biology in the

586
00:35:57.939 --> 00:36:02.090
specific case of diet and the diets of great

587
00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:08.020
apes, to what extent can we derive information from

588
00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:12.100
studying, for example, chimpanzees and bonobos that would apply

589
00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:17.810
to our last common ancestor and perhaps the earlier

590
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:18.800
ominence?

591
00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.330
Mhm. Yeah, I think this is a very, very

592
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:24.870
interesting question. So, um, I like doing this, this

593
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:27.229
work on, you know, looking at bonobos and, you

594
00:36:27.229 --> 00:36:30.790
know, looking at um uh niche petitioning between gorillas

595
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:33.709
and chimpanzees, um, I actually started looking into like

596
00:36:33.709 --> 00:36:36.909
a lot of other like also chimpanzee populations across

597
00:36:36.909 --> 00:36:40.540
Africa. And so here I think chimpanzees are a

598
00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.459
particular useful model in terms of using this method,

599
00:36:44.629 --> 00:36:48.889
uh, isotope analysis, because chimpanzees have adapted to a

600
00:36:48.889 --> 00:36:54.149
vast range of environmental conditions throughout the African continent,

601
00:36:54.229 --> 00:36:57.110
right? When we have chimpanzees that are living uh

602
00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:01.830
in primary evergreen rainforests, uh, for example, we have

603
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:06.370
some uh incredible study populations in West Africa. Uh,

604
00:37:06.419 --> 00:37:09.620
THEY are living in these ancient forests, um, they,

605
00:37:09.709 --> 00:37:12.540
they never see a grassland, right? Uh, AND the

606
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.379
food resources that they can, um, uh, utilize in

607
00:37:16.379 --> 00:37:20.139
these ecosystems, um, are completely different from some of

608
00:37:20.139 --> 00:37:23.500
the chimpanzee populations out there that live in woodland

609
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.899
savannah environments, um, that are very open, um, very

610
00:37:27.899 --> 00:37:34.025
dry, very seasonally, uh, incredibly dry, very hot. Um,

611
00:37:34.226 --> 00:37:35.855
AND so we, we actually know for a couple

612
00:37:35.855 --> 00:37:37.936
of years that we have chimpanzees that are living

613
00:37:37.936 --> 00:37:42.365
in absolutely outrageous environments. For example, in, uh, the,

614
00:37:42.375 --> 00:37:45.506
the Senegal, uh, where previously people never thought that

615
00:37:45.506 --> 00:37:48.065
they could survive out there because it is so

616
00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:52.105
dry seasonally and also so hot. Um, AND so

617
00:37:52.105 --> 00:37:55.385
that makes chimpanzees actually an incredibly useful model for

618
00:37:55.385 --> 00:38:00.231
early human evolution, uh, if we're thinking that. Um,

619
00:38:00.392 --> 00:38:05.822
A lot of the drivers of, uh, bipedalism and

620
00:38:06.231 --> 00:38:10.912
brain growth and increased sophistication and tool use may

621
00:38:10.912 --> 00:38:14.521
have been driven in that environmental shift from our

622
00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:17.501
ancestors kind of like moving out of the forests,

623
00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:22.191
um, into more open environments of woodland savannah, and

624
00:38:22.191 --> 00:38:25.112
here it's very important to also um understand that

625
00:38:25.112 --> 00:38:29.469
it's not. Our ancestors leaving their environments and moving

626
00:38:29.469 --> 00:38:32.820
somewhere else, but it's the environment that's changing, right?

627
00:38:33.209 --> 00:38:37.979
Um, SO we have uh large climatic uh changes,

628
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.149
um, uh, in, in the, the, the, the Pleistocene

629
00:38:42.149 --> 00:38:47.070
that are really like affecting the um expansion of

630
00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:51.979
grasslands in Africa, so forests are receding. That environment

631
00:38:51.979 --> 00:38:55.340
that our earlier ancestors, our common ancestors that we

632
00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:58.860
shared with with chimpanzees and bonobos, we're probably a

633
00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:02.800
forest adapted uh critter, um, and then the environment

634
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.580
is changing and, you know, you can either go

635
00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:09.139
with it or you, you know, basically go extinct

636
00:39:09.139 --> 00:39:11.899
by like sticking to these little pockets of of

637
00:39:11.899 --> 00:39:14.739
forest, or you, uh, may, might might still survive

638
00:39:14.739 --> 00:39:17.530
in those pockets as, you know, chimpanzees and bonobos,

639
00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:22.320
their ancestors, obviously. Uh, SURVIVED by going the route

640
00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.879
of staying in the forest, right? Whereas like early

641
00:39:24.879 --> 00:39:29.030
hominins like they were probably really thriving and proliferating

642
00:39:29.239 --> 00:39:32.479
uh into different species, uh, because of the expansions

643
00:39:32.479 --> 00:39:36.120
of these woodland grasslands and the mosaic of like,

644
00:39:36.159 --> 00:39:39.870
you know, little gallery forests around rivers, uh, so

645
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:43.550
that I really Mix of different habitat types, um,

646
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:47.110
that, uh, that you can find like emerging in

647
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:49.989
South and, uh, in East Africa. And so there

648
00:39:49.989 --> 00:39:53.909
are some chimpanzees that you can basically find across

649
00:39:53.909 --> 00:39:58.310
equatorial Africa that match all these different environments, which

650
00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:01.179
is really amazing. Um, SO we have, uh, for

651
00:40:01.229 --> 00:40:03.379
For example, the loan chimpanzees, they are a great

652
00:40:03.379 --> 00:40:06.459
candidate, uh, if you're interested in a hominin that

653
00:40:06.459 --> 00:40:09.899
lives in a mosaic of environments. So you have

654
00:40:09.899 --> 00:40:14.570
patches of, uh, open savannah, uh, you have swamps,

655
00:40:14.689 --> 00:40:18.300
you have gallery forests, um, and so that is

656
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.750
the environment that the loan chimpanzees live in. Uh,

657
00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.409
WE think a lot of our Uh, ancestors in

658
00:40:25.409 --> 00:40:28.729
East Africa particularly, uh, came out of, uh, a

659
00:40:28.729 --> 00:40:32.649
savannah type that we refer to as miombo, Myombo

660
00:40:32.649 --> 00:40:35.639
woodland. Uh, THOSE are very, very, it's a very

661
00:40:36.169 --> 00:40:40.469
particular kind of, uh, woodland because it's. Dominated by

662
00:40:40.469 --> 00:40:44.469
um a specific kind of trees, um that actually

663
00:40:44.469 --> 00:40:49.989
produce a relatively uh nutrient poor soils, um, uh,

664
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.919
and so this is kind of like the environment

665
00:40:51.919 --> 00:40:54.100
that we think a lot of our ancestors evolved

666
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.649
in. Um, SO they're like relatively open environments with

667
00:40:58.649 --> 00:41:02.879
these miombo trees, so these are woody legumes, um,

668
00:41:03.129 --> 00:41:06.010
and then interspaced by like, you know, uh, gallery

669
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.689
forests around like some creeks and rivers, um, you

670
00:41:09.689 --> 00:41:13.699
know, in a relatively hilly, uh, landscape. Um, AND

671
00:41:13.699 --> 00:41:15.860
so we have chimpanzees that live in these kind

672
00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:20.979
of environments, like, particularly, uh, one, population of chimpanzees

673
00:41:20.979 --> 00:41:24.209
that, um, I had the privilege, uh, to, um,

674
00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.459
uh, to study and I have, uh, you know,

675
00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.939
several ongoing projects is uh a field site called

676
00:41:29.939 --> 00:41:35.290
Isa Valley in Tanzania, and this is absolutely stunning,

677
00:41:35.379 --> 00:41:39.560
um. Uh, FIELD site, uh, you know, uh, your

678
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.479
listeners, if they want to like, uh, get an

679
00:41:41.479 --> 00:41:43.310
idea, they can like check it out. It's uh,

680
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.540
they can find it under the website called GERC,

681
00:41:46.439 --> 00:41:51.310
um, uh, I think it is it gmerc.com. Um,

682
00:41:52.169 --> 00:41:57.120
uh, SO the Isa Valley is these open savannah

683
00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:03.469
woodlands. Interspersed with these beautiful Miabo trees that provide

684
00:42:03.469 --> 00:42:07.020
seed pots that are, you know, uh, relatively, uh,

685
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:11.739
large food resources that chimpanzees love to utilize, um,

686
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:15.139
interspaced by like these beautiful gallery forests. And these

687
00:42:15.139 --> 00:42:18.870
chimpanzees are a very, very useful model actually for

688
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:22.995
fossil hominins because it's a very similar environment. Um,

689
00:42:23.185 --> 00:42:26.695
YOU know, we have a long dry season, um,

690
00:42:26.864 --> 00:42:29.344
uh, we have a relatively short, uh, rainy season,

691
00:42:29.425 --> 00:42:33.185
so climatically probably also very, very similar, um, and

692
00:42:33.185 --> 00:42:35.864
a similar environment and the spec like also the

693
00:42:35.864 --> 00:42:40.534
species community out there being like relatively comparable to,

694
00:42:40.745 --> 00:42:44.370
uh, the species community that was around. Uh, A

695
00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:46.629
couple of million years ago. And so we actually

696
00:42:46.629 --> 00:42:50.959
have like several, uh, projects, uh, going on, um,

697
00:42:50.969 --> 00:42:55.010
uh, at ISA with isotopes. And so here, the

698
00:42:55.010 --> 00:43:00.050
big challenging thing is actually that this Mbo environment

699
00:43:00.389 --> 00:43:06.659
is, um, producing relatively low, low nitrogen isotope values

700
00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:10.750
because these trees that are dominating this landscape are

701
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.580
legumes. And I don't know how much you know

702
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.935
about. LEGUMES, but legumes are, uh, able to actually

703
00:43:17.935 --> 00:43:22.294
fixate, um, nitrogen from the air, right? So they're

704
00:43:22.294 --> 00:43:25.574
not exclusively most other plants are just taking it

705
00:43:25.574 --> 00:43:28.715
up, uh, from the soil through with the help

706
00:43:28.715 --> 00:43:32.344
of bacteria. Well, these trees, legumes, including, you know,

707
00:43:32.495 --> 00:43:35.254
like your, your bees and beans and your lentils

708
00:43:35.254 --> 00:43:38.534
and your peas and your alfalfa, all these plants

709
00:43:38.534 --> 00:43:42.175
are actually able to fixate air nitrogen, also to

710
00:43:42.175 --> 00:43:46.260
the help of bacteria. And so the nitrogen iso

711
00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:50.489
values are very, very low in this environment. Um,

712
00:43:50.659 --> 00:43:53.699
AND so now that we are actually able to

713
00:43:53.699 --> 00:43:58.649
measure nitrogen isotope ratios in fossil hominins, right? So,

714
00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:02.050
um, this new method that was developed in Princeton,

715
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:06.185
we need more framework. Works from these kind of

716
00:44:06.185 --> 00:44:09.625
environments that are pretty messy in terms of the

717
00:44:09.625 --> 00:44:14.705
isotope ratio. So produce really weird values. And we

718
00:44:14.705 --> 00:44:18.985
need a good contextual framework to understand, well, how

719
00:44:18.985 --> 00:44:22.504
does meat eating look like in this environment? Right?

720
00:44:23.104 --> 00:44:27.120
Um. Where all the nitrogen iso values are relatively

721
00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:31.000
low because of the presence of these woody legumes,

722
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:34.729
um, another project that we, uh, just started at

723
00:44:34.729 --> 00:44:37.169
this field site that, uh, I just wanted to

724
00:44:37.169 --> 00:44:41.570
mention because I'm beyond excited about this project is

725
00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:45.159
we're looking into the role of mushrooms as well.

726
00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:48.074
So I don't know, uh, how. You love mushrooms,

727
00:44:48.155 --> 00:44:51.034
but like I'm very, very much interested in, uh,

728
00:44:51.314 --> 00:44:54.395
uh, also foraging for mushrooms here in the beautiful

729
00:44:54.395 --> 00:44:58.784
redwood forests of California. Um, AND mushrooms are, uh,

730
00:44:58.794 --> 00:45:01.794
a very important food resource, and we still have

731
00:45:01.794 --> 00:45:07.620
no idea if And if yes, how much? FOSSIL

732
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.979
hominids and early hominids may have been actually using

733
00:45:10.979 --> 00:45:15.219
this incredible food resource, right? Because if we know

734
00:45:15.219 --> 00:45:19.300
that early hominins were large brained, that would suggest

735
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:23.330
that they're relatively smart, right, and have a quite

736
00:45:23.659 --> 00:45:28.560
detailed understanding of their environment. We know that chimpanzees

737
00:45:28.689 --> 00:45:33.879
uh have those abilities, right? Like chimpanzees know exactly

738
00:45:33.879 --> 00:45:36.689
which trees are fruiting when and where to go,

739
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:40.750
depending on the season. And they can, um, have,

740
00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.879
uh, uh, really like mental maps of their, their

741
00:45:43.879 --> 00:45:48.439
territory in terms of where food resources are. Um,

742
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.239
AND chimpanzees know which mushrooms they can eat and

743
00:45:52.239 --> 00:45:55.800
which one they can't. And mushrooms are incredibly high

744
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.229
in protein, and also like some of them have

745
00:45:58.229 --> 00:46:01.889
a very, very uh important uh trace minerals in

746
00:46:01.889 --> 00:46:06.552
them. Right? And so we're actually doing a project

747
00:46:06.552 --> 00:46:08.393
now, uh, looking at like, well, how do the

748
00:46:08.393 --> 00:46:12.353
isotopes actually look like in these mushrooms? Because there's

749
00:46:12.353 --> 00:46:14.673
incredible work that has been done on a variety

750
00:46:14.673 --> 00:46:18.183
of mushrooms. Mushrooms can look like meat in terms

751
00:46:18.183 --> 00:46:22.113
of the isotope ratios. So if we ever determined

752
00:46:22.113 --> 00:46:26.143
that we might find a fossil hominin taxon that

753
00:46:26.196 --> 00:46:29.025
has really high nitrogen isole ratios and the community

754
00:46:29.025 --> 00:46:31.906
goes like, Oh, we finally found this one hominin

755
00:46:31.906 --> 00:46:34.625
that was like eating tons of meat. We might

756
00:46:34.625 --> 00:46:36.986
actually want to think about like, well, were they

757
00:46:36.986 --> 00:46:39.496
eating a lot of meat? Were they maybe also

758
00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:43.025
eating mushrooms, right? That's something that was actually proposed

759
00:46:43.025 --> 00:46:47.305
also for Neanderthals, right? Neanderthals in Europe, having these

760
00:46:47.305 --> 00:46:51.199
really high nitrogen isotope values. And a lot of

761
00:46:51.199 --> 00:46:55.610
that we can explain by them, um, hunting mammoths,

762
00:46:55.719 --> 00:46:59.760
wooly mammoths, um, that for whatever reason also has

763
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.080
unusual high nitrogen iso values. So if you eat

764
00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.280
a critter like that, you will really like your

765
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.780
isotope ratios will look like you are a top,

766
00:47:07.879 --> 00:47:11.959
uh, carnivore. But we also know that, uh, Neanderthals

767
00:47:11.959 --> 00:47:16.360
were utilizing a ton of plant resources, uh, year

768
00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:22.229
round, right? Um. And so my question is still

769
00:47:22.229 --> 00:47:26.280
like, well, what about the mushrooms, right? Um, AND,

770
00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:28.590
uh, I find it very interesting because like, at

771
00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:30.870
least here in Santa Cruz, like mushrooms are very,

772
00:47:30.909 --> 00:47:35.310
very much beloved by the local community. Um, THERE'S

773
00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:37.500
like a, they're very much an up and coming,

774
00:47:37.709 --> 00:47:41.709
uh, food resource here. Um, AND, uh, I really

775
00:47:41.709 --> 00:47:44.070
like the, the idea that we're finally getting at

776
00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:48.260
that question of mushrooms in the diet of chimpanzees.

777
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:53.030
Great. So, uh let me ask you now, what

778
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:56.600
do we know about the human diet during the

779
00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.989
Paleolithic?

780
00:47:59.979 --> 00:48:02.060
Yeah, um, that's a great question. So I was

781
00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.929
kind of like a little bit touching on that,

782
00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:06.770
right? So if you're thinking about like moving out

783
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:09.020
of Africa, do you want to stay in Africa?

784
00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:11.399
Are we moving out of Africa into like the

785
00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:14.689
more interesting questions of what's happening during the Paleolithic

786
00:48:14.689 --> 00:48:16.689
in in Europe, where we have like all these

787
00:48:16.689 --> 00:48:20.689
different uh hominins running around, like Homo sapiens being

788
00:48:20.689 --> 00:48:24.370
around and the Neanderthals being around and Denisovans being

789
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:28.742
around. Um, SO just to make clear, uh, I'm

790
00:48:28.742 --> 00:48:32.653
not a Paleolithic archaeologist, right? So I personally have

791
00:48:32.653 --> 00:48:37.062
never done any work on, uh, Paleolithic hominins, um,

792
00:48:37.423 --> 00:48:40.482
uh, but my PhD adviser Mike Richards, for example,

793
00:48:40.693 --> 00:48:43.262
um, did a lot of work on, um, on

794
00:48:43.262 --> 00:48:47.443
the dietary ecology of Neanderthals using stable isotope analysis,

795
00:48:48.022 --> 00:48:50.613
um, and he was studying like a lot of

796
00:48:50.613 --> 00:48:54.555
fossil. Prominence, uh, uh, sorry, Neanderthals, uh, from various

797
00:48:54.555 --> 00:48:58.496
sites, uh, in, uh, in Europe, uh, in Eurasia.

798
00:48:58.916 --> 00:49:02.166
Um, AND so yeah, what we know of, of

799
00:49:02.166 --> 00:49:05.756
these, um, guys is, uh, a lot of information

800
00:49:05.756 --> 00:49:08.595
of course comes from the formal assemblages that we

801
00:49:08.595 --> 00:49:11.385
can find at these sites. Again, at that point,

802
00:49:11.436 --> 00:49:18.399
we don't have any big questions if um. Humans

803
00:49:18.489 --> 00:49:23.209
were cognitively and physiologically able to hunt and bring

804
00:49:23.209 --> 00:49:26.919
down large game. Uh, I think like the community

805
00:49:26.919 --> 00:49:30.959
is very much, uh, agrees that with Homo erectus

806
00:49:30.959 --> 00:49:35.719
leaving Africa, uh, we have this relatively tall, actually

807
00:49:35.719 --> 00:49:40.830
impressively tall hominin that can apparently like conquer Eurasia,

808
00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:45.199
um, and possibly also by following, uh, herds of,

809
00:49:45.239 --> 00:49:50.679
of herbivores, right? Seasonally migrations of large herbivores, um.

810
00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:55.719
So, um, uh, the interesting thing that, uh, researchers

811
00:49:55.719 --> 00:50:00.830
have looked at is, um, the, the dietary ecology

812
00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:04.520
of these different hominins that are utilizing similar uh

813
00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:08.830
spaces, for example, within Europe. Um, AND so some

814
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:12.389
of the interesting question was, uh, and then, you

815
00:50:12.389 --> 00:50:14.270
know, like I, I already talked a little bit

816
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:18.709
about like the niche differentiation between sympatrick, so co-existing

817
00:50:18.709 --> 00:50:21.429
gorillas and chimpanzees. Well, how does it look like

818
00:50:21.429 --> 00:50:25.189
with two hominids, right? Uh, SO in most places

819
00:50:25.189 --> 00:50:27.750
that we were around in Africa, for example, we

820
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:30.965
were. Coexisting at the same time, where our ancestors

821
00:50:30.965 --> 00:50:34.205
were co-existing with other hominid species, which is something

822
00:50:34.205 --> 00:50:39.084
that we can, uh, not really imagine because, uh,

823
00:50:39.155 --> 00:50:43.564
Homo sapiens has been alone on this, um, planet

824
00:50:43.564 --> 00:50:46.534
now for quite some time, right? Like 10s of

825
00:50:46.534 --> 00:50:50.770
thousands of years. But, um. In our past, there

826
00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:53.969
have always been some hominins around, right? Like, so

827
00:50:53.969 --> 00:50:57.620
we know that, um, for example, Homo naledi, right?

828
00:50:57.649 --> 00:51:02.399
uh um AN African, uh, South African hominin was

829
00:51:02.649 --> 00:51:06.050
clearly around when Homo sapiens was running around already

830
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:07.679
for a long time. That's we just have to

831
00:51:07.679 --> 00:51:10.320
think about that. So similarly, it's kind of crazy

832
00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.199
to think that you have Neanderthals and modern or

833
00:51:13.199 --> 00:51:17.600
anatomically modern humans coexisting in Europe. And the big

834
00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:19.919
question is like, well, what do they do, right?

835
00:51:20.159 --> 00:51:23.159
Well, through genetics, we of course know that there

836
00:51:23.159 --> 00:51:27.530
was some. Interactions between the two species, right, with

837
00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:32.830
uh anyone alive, any human alive today, um, outside

838
00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:37.389
or outside of uh African ancestry, actually having, you

839
00:51:37.389 --> 00:51:41.699
know, uh, Denisovan and also uh Neanderthal DNA, uh,

840
00:51:41.709 --> 00:51:45.149
in our genome. Um, BUT the big question was

841
00:51:45.149 --> 00:51:48.600
about like the diet. So how do these two

842
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:57.120
Coexisting, overlapping in space and time prominence, um, how

843
00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.040
do they diets allow for that, right? Or are

844
00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:03.719
they competing um dietarily? And so the, the picture

845
00:52:03.719 --> 00:52:06.320
that kind of emerged over the last few decades

846
00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.840
and uh I would like to claim that isotope.

847
00:52:08.969 --> 00:52:13.260
Analysis was part of, um, uh, of the puzzle

848
00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:18.219
here. Really looks like that, um, Neanderthals, um, were

849
00:52:18.219 --> 00:52:20.540
initially thought to like be very much like just

850
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:27.040
large game hunters, like incredibly sophisticated in, um. Uh,

851
00:52:27.139 --> 00:52:31.260
TRACKING and bringing down like gigantic mammals such as

852
00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:36.379
the wooly mammoth, but also wooly rhino, um, horses,

853
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:40.449
uh, and so on and so forth. Whereas, um,

854
00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:47.300
an anatomically modern humans, um, probably, you know, also

855
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:52.330
being capable in hunting large game, but Also not

856
00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:56.969
being shy of eating small animals, right? Like so

857
00:52:56.969 --> 00:53:02.489
small to medium sized mammals, um, or aquatic birds,

858
00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:05.159
and so on and so forth, right? Um, SO

859
00:53:05.159 --> 00:53:08.090
it's not the point that, uh, nanotis were not

860
00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:11.169
utilizing these resources at all, but it just seems

861
00:53:11.169 --> 00:53:17.830
that modern humans were just more, uh, More versatile

862
00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:21.159
in what they would, you know, what resources that

863
00:53:21.159 --> 00:53:24.840
they would uh exploit. Whereas Neanderthals really seem to

864
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.719
have a thing for uh the wooly mammoth for

865
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:32.679
for quite some time. Um, AND, uh, which makes

866
00:53:32.679 --> 00:53:35.189
sense, right? Like you can bring down one animal

867
00:53:35.189 --> 00:53:38.409
and like your, your family or community can actually

868
00:53:38.409 --> 00:53:40.929
utilize that resource for quite a long time, right?

869
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:42.790
If we think that they probably have the ability

870
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:45.409
to, to smoke meat, uh, and then also the

871
00:53:45.409 --> 00:53:47.689
winters being relatively long and cold that you could

872
00:53:47.689 --> 00:53:49.530
also like, you know, freeze the meat and so

873
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:53.040
on and so forth. Um, HOWEVER, over the last,

874
00:53:53.129 --> 00:53:58.280
uh, decades and, uh, the, the role of, um,

875
00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:01.919
plants in the diet, particularly of nano tiles, um,

876
00:54:01.929 --> 00:54:04.399
has shifted, so there has been like some incredible,

877
00:54:04.649 --> 00:54:08.479
uh, work by, for example, uh, my colleague, um,

878
00:54:08.489 --> 00:54:11.459
Amanda Henry, who's also was at the Max Planck

879
00:54:11.459 --> 00:54:14.250
now, she's at Leiden University um in uh the

880
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:18.439
Netherlands. Uh, SHE did some incredible work about cooking,

881
00:54:18.679 --> 00:54:23.550
right? And just finding evidence of Neanderthals actually cooking

882
00:54:23.919 --> 00:54:27.639
plant matter, uh, and, you know, getting a higher

883
00:54:27.639 --> 00:54:32.320
caloric return from actually like cooking vegetation, uh, by

884
00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:36.879
analyzing, uh, dental calculus, so that mineralized tartar that

885
00:54:36.879 --> 00:54:38.679
we have on our teeth, and that would actually

886
00:54:38.679 --> 00:54:41.479
build up like big chunks if we wouldn't have

887
00:54:41.479 --> 00:54:46.746
our dental cleanings. Regularly, um, you actually find a

888
00:54:46.746 --> 00:54:50.025
lot of like, um, uh, plant remains or, or

889
00:54:50.025 --> 00:54:52.706
also like the proteins of, of animals, uh, that

890
00:54:52.706 --> 00:54:54.666
we consume that are kind of like entrapped in

891
00:54:54.666 --> 00:54:57.946
there. Uh, AND so Amanda Henry, uh, found like

892
00:54:57.946 --> 00:55:00.785
a lot of evidence for starch grains that nano

893
00:55:00.785 --> 00:55:05.266
tiles were utilizing, uh, starches, starchy plant foods, uh,

894
00:55:05.345 --> 00:55:09.186
in different places, uh, ranging from what today is,

895
00:55:09.345 --> 00:55:12.451
um, the levan. Uh, RANGING all the way into,

896
00:55:12.691 --> 00:55:16.622
uh, Central Europe, the Neanderthals were always cooking plants.

897
00:55:16.931 --> 00:55:20.332
Um, AND it's a really, really, uh, incredible, um,

898
00:55:20.681 --> 00:55:23.132
uh, research there. And of course, like we, we

899
00:55:23.132 --> 00:55:27.251
know that early humans, um, leaving Africa were probably

900
00:55:27.251 --> 00:55:31.541
also eating a lot of plant matter. But, uh,

901
00:55:31.552 --> 00:55:33.771
the focus has always been on like, well, how

902
00:55:33.771 --> 00:55:35.731
much meat are they eating and what kind of

903
00:55:35.731 --> 00:55:39.479
animals are they bringing down. Uh, OF course, we

904
00:55:39.479 --> 00:55:42.320
have a, uh, uh, a lot of, uh, archaeological

905
00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.479
sites where we have like these gigantic assemblages of

906
00:55:45.479 --> 00:55:48.989
all the fauna that was left behind by these,

907
00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:52.659
uh, Paleolithic, uh, hunters, no matter if they're Neanderthals

908
00:55:52.659 --> 00:55:53.879
or modern humans.

909
00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.669
Does it make sense at all to talk about

910
00:55:58.959 --> 00:56:03.280
a paleo diet? I mean, was there, and now,

911
00:56:03.639 --> 00:56:06.320
uh, I want to focus particularly on Homo sapiens

912
00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.159
because I guess it's about our, uh, it's on

913
00:56:09.159 --> 00:56:13.040
our own species that people are focusing when they

914
00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.830
talk about a supposed paleo diet. Uh, I mean,

915
00:56:16.919 --> 00:56:21.360
were we really eating one single type of diet

916
00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.669
in the Paleolithic?

917
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:26.449
Uh, YEAH, that's a great question. Uh, I would

918
00:56:26.449 --> 00:56:29.719
say like probably no, right? Because like, within the,

919
00:56:29.739 --> 00:56:32.600
the, if we think about like the Paleolithic and

920
00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:35.239
the Ricardo, I'm not even sure like if the

921
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:40.080
the term paleo diet refers to the paleolithic, right?

922
00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:43.729
Uh, I think it just refers to paleo in

923
00:56:43.729 --> 00:56:47.679
terms of the ancient diet or the original diet,

924
00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:51.189
right? The the diet we evolve with and like

925
00:56:51.189 --> 00:56:53.229
if we would like um break it down to

926
00:56:53.229 --> 00:56:56.189
like that definition, is like, then you have to

927
00:56:56.189 --> 00:56:58.919
like return the question and say like, well when

928
00:56:58.919 --> 00:57:03.070
paleo, right? Are we talking about um when we

929
00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:05.629
were hunter gatherers? Are we talking about where we

930
00:57:05.629 --> 00:57:07.989
were still living up in trees and like eating.

931
00:57:08.149 --> 00:57:10.870
RIPE fruit, like chimpanzees, like how far back in

932
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:14.030
time do you want to go? But my understanding

933
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:18.790
what people refer to as paleo diet is referred

934
00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:23.469
to as some vaguely ancestral diet before we became

935
00:57:23.469 --> 00:57:29.229
sedentary and engaged in agriculture. Uh, AND so that

936
00:57:29.229 --> 00:57:32.860
just, I'm just sick thinking that because there's um

937
00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:35.469
quite a lot of meat and as far as

938
00:57:35.469 --> 00:57:39.709
I know, also fish in that diet, right? Um.

939
00:57:40.409 --> 00:57:43.860
And with the emphasis is, I think, uh, as

940
00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:47.129
far as I understand, the, the paleo diet move

941
00:57:47.129 --> 00:57:50.899
is to avoid carbohydrates, right? Or having like a

942
00:57:50.899 --> 00:57:54.379
diet that's relatively low in carbohydrates, relatively high in

943
00:57:54.870 --> 00:58:01.520
proteins, high in fats. And largely avoiding carbohydrates. And

944
00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.830
so here is actually the problem um that um

945
00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:10.159
all I think most of paleoanthropologists and biological anthropologists

946
00:58:10.159 --> 00:58:14.929
agree on. We know that starchy foods, so carbon,

947
00:58:15.399 --> 00:58:20.520
carbohydrate, rich foods, were probably very essential to early

948
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:23.889
human evolution. Um, AND so there's incredible work that

949
00:58:23.889 --> 00:58:27.600
was done by, for example, um, uh, uh, Richard

950
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:32.330
Ringham, uh, and, uh, Rachel Caudi, uh, that actually

951
00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:38.320
showed that, um, the role of tubers, uh, in

952
00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:42.209
the diet in the early, um, uh, in the

953
00:58:42.209 --> 00:58:45.689
early diet of hominins was probably one of the

954
00:58:45.689 --> 00:58:48.905
catalysts. Of brain growth or like there's what we

955
00:58:48.905 --> 00:58:52.145
call, uh, you know, hominids getting bigger and bigger

956
00:58:52.145 --> 00:58:54.504
brains. So it might not have just been meats

957
00:58:54.504 --> 00:58:56.864
and then going out and and hunting and getting

958
00:58:56.864 --> 00:59:00.425
like a very, very nutritious meal full of protein

959
00:59:00.425 --> 00:59:06.020
and fat, but it was probably, um. More or

960
00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:09.899
at least equivalent um uh individuals from the community

961
00:59:09.899 --> 00:59:13.739
going out and digging up tubers, for example, right?

962
00:59:13.899 --> 00:59:20.050
So if um researchers are studying um the diet

963
00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:23.790
of uh existing uh hunting. Gather us no matter

964
00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:26.439
if we're talking about forest hunter gatherers that are

965
00:59:26.439 --> 00:59:28.899
still existing in in some parts of the world,

966
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.699
for example, in the Central African rainforest, or if

967
00:59:32.699 --> 00:59:34.989
we're looking at like some of the last savannah,

968
00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:38.820
um, hunter gatherers, uh, for example, the Haza in,

969
00:59:38.909 --> 00:59:44.870
uh, what is today Tanzania. These people, um, particularly

970
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:48.929
the women spent a lot of time in, uh,

971
00:59:49.139 --> 00:59:52.260
searching and very successfully knowing exactly where to go

972
00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:56.570
to find tubers that are incredibly rich in starches

973
00:59:56.570 --> 00:59:59.780
and that are then Process, for example, pounded or

974
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:04.300
cooked to actually like um uh uh um utilize

975
01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:08.600
the the starches, uh, starches, you know, um, uh,

976
01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:11.780
are then turned into sugars, you know, pure, uh,

977
01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:15.659
carbohydrates. And so that's exactly also what Amanda Henry

978
01:00:15.659 --> 01:00:19.810
found in all these Neanderthals in, in Eurasia, is

979
01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.939
they are probably eating some kind of tubers, right?

980
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.810
Like anything that's like rich in starches. And so,

981
01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:29.510
um. To get back to your question about the

982
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:33.659
paleo diet, if I envision a paleo diet, yes,

983
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:37.870
I probably do see some amounts of meat in

984
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:41.590
there, uh, cooked meat, right? Because in that time

985
01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:45.274
period, we have fire, we have like the. SECURED

986
01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:49.165
and undisputed evidence for fire use that dates to

987
01:00:49.165 --> 01:00:53.054
around like 700 or 800,000 years ago, right? We

988
01:00:53.054 --> 01:00:55.334
think that we use fire before that, but we

989
01:00:55.334 --> 01:00:57.895
just don't have solid evidence for it. Uh, BUT

990
01:00:57.895 --> 01:01:02.860
at that time, we're cooking. Um, AND we're cooking

991
01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:06.020
some meats and we're probably still eating a good

992
01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:10.860
amount of fruit, nuts, seeds, but we're also eating

993
01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:13.219
a lot of tubers. And so if you would

994
01:01:13.219 --> 01:01:17.659
transfer that into a modern day paleo diet, you

995
01:01:17.659 --> 01:01:22.020
would probably eat a lot of potatoes, uh, and

996
01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:27.260
yam, and, uh, also other uh starchy foods, for

997
01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:32.014
example, cereals, right? Uh, THAT'S also, you know, cereals

998
01:01:32.014 --> 01:01:35.294
are, you know, domesticated grasses, right? And so we

999
01:01:35.294 --> 01:01:39.824
can assume that, uh, early, um, um, foragers were

1000
01:01:39.824 --> 01:01:42.735
also utilizing, you know, the seeds of, of wild

1001
01:01:42.735 --> 01:01:46.284
grasses, right? And then ultimately we start domesticating them

1002
01:01:46.284 --> 01:01:50.820
because we thought they're so good. So. Yeah, the,

1003
01:01:50.879 --> 01:01:53.159
the whole paleo diet, but also the paleo diet

1004
01:01:53.159 --> 01:01:55.360
question, I think it's shifting all the time. It's

1005
01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.639
very much like uh um it's a, it's a

1006
01:01:58.639 --> 01:02:01.399
it's a fashion trend, right? In, in what to

1007
01:02:01.399 --> 01:02:05.949
eat, because people want to eat well, um, and,

1008
01:02:05.959 --> 01:02:08.360
uh, yeah, if there would be a little bit

1009
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.639
more carbs in paleo diet, I think it would

1010
01:02:10.639 --> 01:02:12.550
be more authentically paleo.

1011
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.360
And I mean, what were the main changes to

1012
01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.629
our diet that were brought about with the advent

1013
01:02:20.629 --> 01:02:21.800
of agriculture?

1014
01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:27.270
Well, agriculture changed everything, right? Um, AND like uh

1015
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:30.780
just uh to to. Uh, KIND of take a

1016
01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.760
step back of like the, you know, when I,

1017
01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.800
when I was a student, like we still called

1018
01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.270
it the Neolithic Revolution, right, which always like, uh,

1019
01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.280
had like this uh uh tone to it like

1020
01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.520
that it was a very, very rapid process and

1021
01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.239
it's just like, you know, some, some community invented

1022
01:02:47.239 --> 01:02:50.439
it somewhere and like boom everything uh changed from

1023
01:02:50.439 --> 01:02:53.959
one day to the other. Um, SO the idea

1024
01:02:53.959 --> 01:02:59.679
that uh plans could actually be, uh. Manipulate it,

1025
01:02:59.919 --> 01:03:04.080
right? Um, AND, uh, to, to increase yields and

1026
01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.800
the reliability of finding these plants in a given

1027
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.639
place and utilize them year after year, um, and

1028
01:03:11.639 --> 01:03:14.429
then actually becoming so good at it to become

1029
01:03:14.429 --> 01:03:18.320
like sedentary. That was invented by um uh uh

1030
01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.399
hunter gatherer forager communities in different parts of the

1031
01:03:21.399 --> 01:03:23.520
world, right? It just didn't happen only in the

1032
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.919
Levant, it happened in different places in the world.

1033
01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:30.689
Um, THAT humans probably started with, um, some of

1034
01:03:30.689 --> 01:03:33.530
these grasses, for example, as I mentioned, right, like

1035
01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:35.570
we have like some of these grasses that are

1036
01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:39.600
being domesticated, for example, in, uh, East Asia, uh,

1037
01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.770
which then later turns into rice, and then we

1038
01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:45.830
have in the Levant, uh, uh, some wheat varieties

1039
01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:50.575
that we, uh, call emer. Corn, little barley, um,

1040
01:03:51.115 --> 01:03:54.865
that are have wild precursors that are already relatively

1041
01:03:54.865 --> 01:03:58.696
nutritious. And then we see that people are selecting

1042
01:03:58.906 --> 01:04:02.746
for specific traits in these plants that are favorable

1043
01:04:02.746 --> 01:04:06.345
for not only eating them, but also harvesting and

1044
01:04:06.345 --> 01:04:09.402
storing them, right? So for example, one trait. I

1045
01:04:09.402 --> 01:04:12.041
want to look at, or look for in a

1046
01:04:12.041 --> 01:04:16.031
grain is that the, the seeds of a plant

1047
01:04:16.241 --> 01:04:18.642
that shattered very little, so you could like pick

1048
01:04:18.642 --> 01:04:21.882
it and bring it, transport it without losing all

1049
01:04:21.882 --> 01:04:24.662
the seeds right away. That was probably a trait

1050
01:04:24.662 --> 01:04:26.951
that you were going for. If you want to,

1051
01:04:27.122 --> 01:04:30.082
you know, use some of those seeds and spread

1052
01:04:30.082 --> 01:04:34.080
them out. And then have them uh flourish and

1053
01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.320
provide food for the next season, right? So people

1054
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.320
were doing that in many different places uh in

1055
01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.000
the world. Um, uh, THE beautiful thing is then

1056
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.655
also we have like the proliferation of the. Of

1057
01:04:46.655 --> 01:04:50.455
of pottery that again, starts already with hunter-gatherers. We

1058
01:04:50.455 --> 01:04:53.854
have hunter-gatherers, uh, for example, in East Asia that

1059
01:04:53.854 --> 01:04:59.175
are already already using pottery, uh, as hunter-gatherer fishery

1060
01:04:59.175 --> 01:05:04.750
communities, right? Um. But the diet really changes because

1061
01:05:05.219 --> 01:05:10.699
um humans are suddenly able to spend more time

1062
01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:15.500
uh in what we before in hunter gatherer communities

1063
01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.620
refer to more as like base camps, like more

1064
01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:23.429
temporary uh season. uh, CAMPSITES that are moved, um,

1065
01:05:23.679 --> 01:05:25.810
at least like annually, you have to like go

1066
01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:27.840
somewhere else for like, you know, maybe the rainy

1067
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.239
season or leave somewhere for the dry season and

1068
01:05:30.239 --> 01:05:32.959
so on and so forth. So these people are

1069
01:05:32.959 --> 01:05:38.570
now able to stay in the same place. Um,

1070
01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:45.159
AND. Not only utilize the environment for um obtaining

1071
01:05:45.159 --> 01:05:49.040
foods, but also start producing foods, right? uh STARTING

1072
01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:53.330
domesticate variety of plants, not only uh cereals, but

1073
01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:56.810
also legumes uh that we talked about earlier, right?

1074
01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.010
Like we start like seeing like some, you know,

1075
01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:02.520
for example, beans and peas, uh, being domesticated in

1076
01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.800
different places in the world, uh, and then of

1077
01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:10.429
course animals. And so part of that sedentary lifestyle

1078
01:06:10.429 --> 01:06:13.040
is being in the same place and using the

1079
01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:18.120
resources that you start producing. And what changes is

1080
01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:23.090
many things. So the diet particularly gets more starchy

1081
01:06:23.439 --> 01:06:27.080
than probably it ever has been before, because these

1082
01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:30.399
cereals are very nutritious, very hard in high in

1083
01:06:30.399 --> 01:06:35.280
carbohydrates. They're easy to store, relatively speaking, particularly when

1084
01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.739
you have pottery. Um, AND so people have a

1085
01:06:38.739 --> 01:06:42.080
lot of starches in their, uh, in their diet.

1086
01:06:42.379 --> 01:06:45.409
A lot of starches in your diet easily translates

1087
01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:49.459
into sugars, and you probably know that what happens

1088
01:06:49.459 --> 01:06:52.060
with your teeth if you have a relatively high

1089
01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:56.540
sugar diet, you start having like some oral hygiene.

1090
01:06:56.655 --> 01:06:59.004
Issues that are coming up, right? So that is

1091
01:06:59.004 --> 01:07:03.764
something that we, uh, initially, um, always connected with

1092
01:07:03.764 --> 01:07:07.975
the onset of agriculture that people get really shitty

1093
01:07:07.975 --> 01:07:11.885
teeth, right? People have like much, much higher frequencies

1094
01:07:11.885 --> 01:07:15.385
of lesions through cavities, through what we call carriers,

1095
01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:19.665
right? Um, AND so that, that has always been

1096
01:07:19.665 --> 01:07:22.889
like that picture with the onset of agriculture. Your

1097
01:07:22.889 --> 01:07:26.840
teeth are going bad and there's other health implications,

1098
01:07:26.929 --> 01:07:31.649
of course, living in the same place, um, probably

1099
01:07:31.649 --> 01:07:36.899
also um population number expanding, and we're living side

1100
01:07:36.899 --> 01:07:40.219
by side with all these domesticated animals. So we

1101
01:07:40.219 --> 01:07:44.959
suddenly are starting to deal with zoonotic disease, right?

1102
01:07:45.370 --> 01:07:50.239
So it's actually like in terms of Human health,

1103
01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:53.500
I think there's like some consensus that in terms

1104
01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.969
of human health, it was a little bit of

1105
01:07:54.969 --> 01:07:58.530
a bad idea to to to transfer from hunter

1106
01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:04.810
gatherer for your lifestyle into agriculture. Um, ALSO, what

1107
01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:07.169
we see in that time period, uh, at least

1108
01:08:07.169 --> 01:08:10.600
like what I'm familiar with more in Eurasia, uh,

1109
01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:14.530
is as soon as people become sedentary, also human-human

1110
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:18.870
conflict, uh, starts to get bigger, right? And then,

1111
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:20.970
of course, like, uh, at least like in the

1112
01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:24.279
Bronze Age, then we really have the proliferation or

1113
01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:27.850
the, the evolution of like social dominance hierarchies with

1114
01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:32.859
within human uh communities, um. And so on and

1115
01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:35.779
so forth. So whereas we often think of hunter

1116
01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:40.419
gatherer societies being more agilitarian, right? Uh, AND resources

1117
01:08:40.419 --> 01:08:44.379
being shared among group members. Um, BUT yeah, so

1118
01:08:44.379 --> 01:08:46.540
I think like really the, the idea is that

1119
01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:50.009
uh the onset of agriculture has a toll on

1120
01:08:50.009 --> 01:08:54.049
particularly the dental health of humans. There's some evidence

1121
01:08:54.049 --> 01:08:58.419
from archaeological sites of uh hunter gatherer populations that

1122
01:08:58.419 --> 01:09:02.823
are predating agriculture. That actually suggests that that might

1123
01:09:02.823 --> 01:09:06.143
be oversimplification of the picture. So we have some

1124
01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:09.542
hunter gatherer communities that are, for example, heavily dependent,

1125
01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:14.263
uh, rely on, um, on nuts, for example, acorns,

1126
01:09:14.872 --> 01:09:18.591
right? And acorns are really, really uh incredible food

1127
01:09:18.591 --> 01:09:21.712
resource if you know how to um actually process

1128
01:09:21.712 --> 01:09:26.416
them to make Copalatable. Uh, BUT once you reach

1129
01:09:26.416 --> 01:09:30.416
that, then you have a high caloric return, easy

1130
01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:33.015
to collect food resource, but it's high in starch,

1131
01:09:33.255 --> 01:09:35.886
hence it's high in sugar. And so we see

1132
01:09:35.886 --> 01:09:38.456
some hunter gatherer populations that eat a lot of

1133
01:09:38.456 --> 01:09:41.854
acorns, and they also have dental problems, just like

1134
01:09:41.854 --> 01:09:43.965
early agricultural societies do.

1135
01:09:44.759 --> 01:09:49.470
Mhm. Uh, BUT I mean, generally speaking, at least

1136
01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:54.109
when we're talking about the early farmers, their diets

1137
01:09:54.109 --> 01:09:58.740
were poorer than the diets of the hunter-gatherers,

1138
01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:01.310
right? I would not say that their diets were

1139
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:06.589
poor. Um, OBVIOUSLY they were doing pretty well. It

1140
01:10:06.589 --> 01:10:11.549
was a lifestyle that was becoming very successful and

1141
01:10:11.549 --> 01:10:17.740
expanded. Relatively rapidly. And so, that said, like, you

1142
01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.700
know, I think there's an argument to be made

1143
01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:24.970
that the agricultural life that overpowered hunter gatherer communities

1144
01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:28.529
where where they actually like expanded into, right? We

1145
01:10:28.529 --> 01:10:34.290
see hunter gatherer populations uh either disappearing or assimilating

1146
01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:39.080
this lifestyle, right? So, uh, there must be some

1147
01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:42.890
success in that story, um, probably also connected with

1148
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:49.060
the ability to, um, Uh, produce higher number of

1149
01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.660
offspring, right? We have like a population expansion, uh,

1150
01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:56.259
in that time period. So I wouldn't really say

1151
01:10:56.259 --> 01:10:59.779
that that it was, uh, like a negative outcome

1152
01:10:59.779 --> 01:11:03.379
for these people was highly successful. Um, THE one

1153
01:11:03.379 --> 01:11:06.060
thing is that I kind of like, my, my

1154
01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:09.220
personal view at least is, um, that life was

1155
01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.509
harder as a farmer, right? So we have many

1156
01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.600
Many studies that show that hunter gatherers, um, can

1157
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.629
actually acquire, uh, in a very sustainable way enough

1158
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:25.609
resources to meet their daily energetic, you know, caloric,

1159
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:29.910
uh, requirements by just spending a few hours, you

1160
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:31.990
know, out in the, in the bush or in

1161
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:37.069
the forest and utilizing wild plants, mushrooms, wild animals.

1162
01:11:37.939 --> 01:11:40.229
And spending a lot of time like in in

1163
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:45.229
communal and social activities after that. With agriculture, we

1164
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:50.029
actually have societies that have to work their butts

1165
01:11:50.029 --> 01:11:55.629
off to um to to actually get enough like

1166
01:11:55.629 --> 01:11:58.850
the labor, the number of hours of labor expand,

1167
01:11:59.390 --> 01:12:02.950
right? And so, uh, but then those people are

1168
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:06.830
also like able to produce more offspring, right? Uh,

1169
01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:10.220
PROBABLY because of the invention of like food storage

1170
01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:14.319
and all these things, so. Uh, I'm a person,

1171
01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:17.649
like I would rather prefer working less, uh, and

1172
01:12:17.649 --> 01:12:20.919
spending more time doing the things I love, uh,

1173
01:12:21.209 --> 01:12:28.060
um, but, um. It is uh uh um a

1174
01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:32.120
technology like using domesticated animals and domesticated plants that

1175
01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:36.080
apparently has been incredibly successful. Otherwise, we wouldn't be

1176
01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.109
where we are right now.

1177
01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.399
Right, but it wasn't it the case that when

1178
01:12:40.399 --> 01:12:44.120
it comes to their health, uh, I mean, their

1179
01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.959
nutrition in general wasn't as good as the nutrition

1180
01:12:48.959 --> 01:12:54.009
of hunter-gatherers because at least the early farmers were

1181
01:12:54.009 --> 01:12:58.720
shorter in stature and or is that outdated information?

1182
01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.189
Well, I'm actually like not sure what like the

1183
01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.470
the current uh discourse is uh regarding that. Um,

1184
01:13:06.479 --> 01:13:08.160
I don't know if like the, the picture is

1185
01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.839
very much like more about like later in like

1186
01:13:10.839 --> 01:13:14.399
the medieval period that like these farming communities are

1187
01:13:14.399 --> 01:13:17.000
getting like incredibly short and like, you know, are

1188
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.479
like always like struck by. Like some incredible pandemic

1189
01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:23.589
diseases and famines and so on and so forth.

1190
01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.560
You know, when I'm thinking about like early hunter

1191
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.939
gatherers, like I'm really thinking about um some of

1192
01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:33.720
these incredible archaeological sites, for example, in Anatolia, where

1193
01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.080
we have people that are still doing like small

1194
01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:40.209
scale hunting. Uh, BUT they are also domesticating wild

1195
01:13:40.209 --> 01:13:42.850
animals, and they have a range of domesticated plants

1196
01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:46.529
to their disposal. So they're like transitioning, uh, very

1197
01:13:46.529 --> 01:13:49.040
much into a more sedentary lifestyle, but they still

1198
01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.330
have like a lot of wild resources that they

1199
01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:53.370
can utilize, right? So we see that in a

1200
01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:57.129
lot of, um, uh, different places in the. WORLD

1201
01:13:57.129 --> 01:14:01.240
that, uh, hunter, uh, hunter gatherers like give up

1202
01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:05.689
that lifestyle, um, to, to join, uh, probably like

1203
01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:12.180
more sedentary agricultural, uh, societies, possibly even in uh

1204
01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:18.009
these uh scenarios where, you know. Big game has

1205
01:14:18.009 --> 01:14:20.770
moved on, and uh these farmers are sitting there

1206
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:23.770
and are they're like utilizing the the resources that

1207
01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:26.450
they have gathered over the last 9 months and

1208
01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:29.970
they're doing just fine, right? Uh, AND if needed,

1209
01:14:30.009 --> 01:14:32.660
they can slaughter a goat or, or a sheep,

1210
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:38.100
um. Uh, AND so, um, I, I don't think

1211
01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:42.100
that that picture of like earlier farmers being like

1212
01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:48.129
completely deprived and sick and tiny statured, uh, humans,

1213
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:51.779
uh, is, is uh up to date anymore. Mhm.

1214
01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:55.359
OK, so, uh, I'm really getting mindful of your

1215
01:14:55.359 --> 01:14:59.560
time. We are reaching our time limit here. So

1216
01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.120
perhaps if you agree, we could have somewhere in

1217
01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:05.750
the near future another conversation just to wrap up

1218
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:09.279
this bit about human diet, particularly now in the

1219
01:15:09.279 --> 01:15:12.560
Neolithic, and then also to talk about your more

1220
01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:17.080
recent work on the transatlantic slave trade. So, uh,

1221
01:15:17.089 --> 01:15:20.500
just before we go, where can people find your

1222
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.890
work on the internet?

1223
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.240
Oh yeah, so, uh, I'm actually like uh a

1224
01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:28.779
person who's not using social media for my science

1225
01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:32.549
communication at all. Uh, I have uh a website

1226
01:15:32.939 --> 01:15:35.799
uh where you can find me, um, that is

1227
01:15:35.799 --> 01:15:43.240
www uh PEA minus lab.com, so P E M

1228
01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:48.629
A. Uh LAB.COM, uh, and I try to keep

1229
01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:52.040
that updated with all my recent, uh, news coming

1230
01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:56.930
out, any kind of media coverage or um publications,

1231
01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:59.080
and, uh, I also like really try to, to

1232
01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:02.229
highlight the work of my incredible team of undergraduate,

1233
01:16:02.490 --> 01:16:06.120
uh, students, uh, and my, my post, um, previous

1234
01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:09.439
postdocs and, and uh graduate students, uh, on that

1235
01:16:09.439 --> 01:16:11.830
website. So yeah, uh, please guys check that out.

1236
01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.479
And you can also like find some more on.

1237
01:16:13.636 --> 01:16:17.246
Uh, INFORMATION about my work on, um, the transatlantic

1238
01:16:17.246 --> 01:16:19.335
slave trade. I, that's kind of like the thing

1239
01:16:19.335 --> 01:16:22.936
that I'm working on, uh, pri primarily now, uh,

1240
01:16:23.016 --> 01:16:27.456
besides my work, um, uh, on, uh, um, the

1241
01:16:27.456 --> 01:16:30.136
dietary ecology of African great apes. So I'm like

1242
01:16:30.136 --> 01:16:33.855
really doing weird twofold research, right? I'm a primatologist

1243
01:16:33.855 --> 01:16:36.096
and an archaeological scientist at the same time, a

1244
01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:38.976
lot of people find that quite, uh, confusing, but

1245
01:16:38.976 --> 01:16:42.645
I find it, uh, very, very, uh, stimulating. So,

1246
01:16:42.985 --> 01:16:44.992
uh. Um, YEAH, and Ricardo, I'd love to have

1247
01:16:44.992 --> 01:16:48.551
another conversation with you about my, my, my work

1248
01:16:48.551 --> 01:16:52.392
in, uh, more historical archaeology, actually, right? When I

1249
01:16:52.392 --> 01:16:54.751
never thought that I would ever get into, um,

1250
01:16:54.952 --> 01:16:57.381
particularly like I'm, I'm working on a, a very,

1251
01:16:57.472 --> 01:17:00.711
very prominent site in Portugal, uh, called the Valle

1252
01:17:00.711 --> 01:17:03.821
degaara in Lagos, um, which is the only site

1253
01:17:03.821 --> 01:17:07.892
that we know of in entire Europe where, um,

1254
01:17:08.251 --> 01:17:11.432
uh, enslaved Africans have been found in a, in

1255
01:17:11.432 --> 01:17:14.250
a mass burial. And so I'd love to talk

1256
01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:16.410
about that with you at another occasion.

1257
01:17:17.319 --> 01:17:20.399
OK, great. So very much looking forward to that

1258
