00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.150
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.309
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs, and

3
00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:09.220
today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor Alan

4
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.989
Buchanan. In our first interview, we talked about his

5
00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:16.489
book, Our Moral Fate, and today we're talking about

6
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.280
his latest one. Ideology and revolution, how the struggle

7
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.239
against domination drives the evolution of morality and institutions.

8
00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.200
So, Doctor Buchanan, welcome back to the show. It's

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.219
always a huge pleasure to talk with you.

10
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.959
Thank you for having me.

11
00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:37.479
So, uh, tell us first, what is, before we

12
00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:41.400
get into specifics here, what is the main argument

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.439
of your book?

14
00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:47.200
OK, the idea is that this is a contribution

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.549
to understanding social change. And that one driver of

16
00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:59.610
social change is a kind of co-evolutionary interaction between

17
00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:05.459
hierarchs, people who occupy positions of power and authority

18
00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:10.230
over others, and people who resist their exercising that

19
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.910
control. So there's a continuing struggle between hierarchs and

20
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.430
resisters to hierarchy. And the idea is that in

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.870
this struggle, Each party has to form coalitions to

22
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.489
be effective, and to form coalitions, they have to.

23
00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:33.069
Invoke ideologies that include ideas about how you rightfully

24
00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.029
come to have power and how you rightfully exercise

25
00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:43.410
power. And so different concepts about authority and inequality,

26
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.029
and about the justification of authority and the inequality

27
00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:49.750
goes with it, they evolve and change over time

28
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.769
through this interaction. And I use an analogy. Between

29
00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:58.069
uh uh uh uh the idea of a, of

30
00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.190
a parasite attacking a host organism. The parasite is

31
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.470
the hierarchs, the host organism is the rest of

32
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.949
us. And the parasite attacks, and the host organism

33
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.789
develops some kind of defense, some way of resisting

34
00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:18.910
the pathogen. And then, The pathogen, the parasite mutates

35
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.550
and develops a better strategy that tries to go

36
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.669
around the defense that's just been developed by the

37
00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.580
host organism, and so on and so on. So,

38
00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:34.929
there's a co-evolutionary process, uh, and in this process

39
00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.899
are generated all sorts of new moral ideas, moral

40
00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:44.250
concepts, and institutions to embody them. So that's the,

41
00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:46.669
the basic idea. If you want to understand social

42
00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.429
change, one aspect of social change is changing ideas

43
00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:55.649
about authority, about hierarchy. And about when it's justified

44
00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:59.179
and when it isn't justified. And the only way

45
00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.059
you can understand that process and why, for example,

46
00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:04.139
now we have the concept of the rule of

47
00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.559
law, uh, and the concept of democracy, which earlier

48
00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:10.919
generation didn't have, you have to look at the

49
00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:16.160
particulars of this interaction between hierarchies, hierarchs and resistor

50
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.699
to hierarchy. So that's the basic idea.

51
00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.369
Uh, BUT why is it important to, to understand

52
00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.570
social change in your mind?

53
00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:31.669
Oh, excellent question. Well, ultimately, the reason I'm interested

54
00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.589
in social change is because I'm interested in the

55
00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:38.589
possibilities for moral progress, that is for social change

56
00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:42.449
that's good from a moral point of view. And

57
00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:47.259
to try to understand moral progress and to try

58
00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.179
to know how we can bring it about, you

59
00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.860
have to understand the mechanisms of social change, right?

60
00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.020
You can't just propose some better state of affairs

61
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.460
and say, well, now let's do it, right? You've

62
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.354
got to understand what the feasibility constraints are. About

63
00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:07.274
how social change really occurs and whether the, the,

64
00:04:07.354 --> 00:04:10.315
the better state that you are hoping for can

65
00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:13.414
come about through the actual processes that are available

66
00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:16.024
for social change. So the idea is we know

67
00:04:16.024 --> 00:04:19.673
more about this, we could perhaps guide social change

68
00:04:19.673 --> 00:04:22.375
in a better direction. That's the hope.

69
00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:28.290
And, uh, explain your approach to social change, the

70
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.730
one you present in your book. Tell us about

71
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.549
your conflict theory of social change.

72
00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:38.489
OK. Uh, FIRST of all, the theory has two

73
00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:43.970
parts that are closely related. There's a descriptive explanatory

74
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.149
part of the theory. And it doesn't make moral

75
00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:49.709
judgments. It just tries to describe some of the

76
00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:53.890
mechanisms of change, not in general, but about changes

77
00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:58.059
that have to do with political institutions and our

78
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.149
understandings of what justifies them. So there's the descriptive

79
00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:04.410
explanatory part. That's a kind of social science enterprise.

80
00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:07.869
Then there's the normative part, that is the attempt

81
00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:11.739
to develop some. Theory, some set of principles that

82
00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:15.420
allows you to evaluate the changes that have been

83
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.540
described and explained by the social science part of,

84
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.209
of the theory. And my idea is that uh

85
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.369
what you get when you combine these things is

86
00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:28.970
a conflict theory of certain kinds of social changes,

87
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.209
conflict between hierarchs and resistor to hierarchy. Now this

88
00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:38.570
is uh similar and different in some ways from

89
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.529
Marx's theory of history, right? He has a conflict

90
00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:45.640
theory also, conflict between classes. My view is a

91
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.089
little more uh fluid than that because I think

92
00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:53.970
that it's a conflict between Coalitions of resisters and

93
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.380
coalitions of hierarchs, and the composition of the coalitions

94
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.890
changes. There's an attempt on both parties to recruit

95
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.529
new people to come into their coalitions to make

96
00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:07.850
them more powerful. So, you can't just say it's

97
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:13.010
between uh You know, proletariats and capitalists. It's more

98
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.369
complicated than that. And as things change over time,

99
00:06:16.489 --> 00:06:21.649
different groups participate. And one coalition is always trying

100
00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:24.500
to recruit members from the other coalition or undermine

101
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.730
the effectiveness of the coalition. So, again, it's an

102
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.829
interactive, uh, kind of evolutionary process.

103
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.149
Mhm. So, yeah, you, you've already told us then

104
00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:37.470
about the um how your theory of social change

105
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.670
relates to Marxism. So, uh let's now define some

106
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.309
terms here. So what is Hierarchy, I mean, what

107
00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:48.029
does that mean?

108
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.429
Yeah, um, by a hierarchy, I mean a, a

109
00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:57.209
kind of persisting social structure in which some individuals

110
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.390
have a place in that structure that gives them

111
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.470
power over others that others don't have over them.

112
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.230
So it's a, a, a structure of unequal power

113
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.200
relations, uh, hierarchy, and usually it has a kind

114
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:16.119
of, uh, of step-like structure so that uh the

115
00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:20.040
people at the highest level uh can give direction

116
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.480
and control over the next level down, and those

117
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.959
people have some power over the next level down

118
00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:29.720
from there. So it's a kind of a series

119
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.959
of nested power relations. Usually, that's the way it

120
00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:36.140
works. And you can think about You know, a

121
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.220
federal system like uh the United States or uh

122
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.410
many other countries where there's a kind of structure

123
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.779
of authority and at the top is the central

124
00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:50.420
government, and then there are various provinces or states

125
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.179
or regions, and there are people in power there

126
00:07:55.179 --> 00:07:59.190
that have power over localities within their province. Uh,

127
00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:01.869
AND so we come to the county level, the

128
00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:05.019
city level, etc. So that's the kind of, uh,

129
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:08.630
structure I'm talking about. Now, there are political hierarchies

130
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.390
of the kind that I just described, but there

131
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:15.709
are also, uh, hierarchies in, uh, personal relationships. For

132
00:08:15.709 --> 00:08:19.429
example, in traditional, uh, marriages in the West, there's

133
00:08:19.429 --> 00:08:22.109
a kind of hierarchy of authority. So the husband

134
00:08:22.109 --> 00:08:25.179
has authority over the wife that the wife doesn't

135
00:08:25.179 --> 00:08:28.700
have over the husband. I'm interested mainly in the

136
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:34.320
more inclusive, larger hierarchies which are political, uh, and

137
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.058
resistance to those, but the notion of hierarchy is

138
00:08:38.058 --> 00:08:40.380
much broader than that in general,

139
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.539
right? And what is domination?

140
00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:49.229
Well, there's a, uh, there are different competing philosophical

141
00:08:49.229 --> 00:08:53.510
theories about domination. Uh, Philip Pettit, uh, following the

142
00:08:53.510 --> 00:09:00.250
classical, uh, Republican tradition, thinks of domination as the

143
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:05.429
power of some human individuals, either as individuals or

144
00:09:05.429 --> 00:09:11.900
in groups. To arbitrarily interfere with the activities of

145
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.289
someone else. Now, I, I view domination more broadly.

146
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.359
I think you could be dominated not just by

147
00:09:17.359 --> 00:09:22.000
particular individuals, but by social structures. And you can

148
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.479
also actually be dominated by your own ideological beliefs,

149
00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:29.280
that is, your beliefs can interfere with your thinking

150
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.080
clearly about your situation, with your recognizing what's truly

151
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.200
in your interest, etc. So, I have a broader

152
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.520
notion of domination, but I'm mainly concerned with the

153
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.989
kind of domination exercised by people in The higher

154
00:09:44.989 --> 00:09:48.109
strata of hierarchies, the, the people at the top

155
00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:52.390
hierarchies, and how they have the power to interfere

156
00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:57.140
arbitrarily, that is without good moral reason. In the

157
00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.979
lives of people who are lower down in the

158
00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:03.549
hierarchy than they are. So that, now, I, I

159
00:10:03.549 --> 00:10:05.830
use the term domination very broadly in the book

160
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.909
and I say this explicitly that I'm really concerned

161
00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:14.169
with the whole range of negative uh uses of

162
00:10:14.179 --> 00:10:22.890
hierarchical power, exploitation, uh, domination, uh, uh. There are

163
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.599
other, uh, other kinds of abuses of the hierarchy.

164
00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:30.169
I'm, I'm concerned gen generally with abuses of hierarchical

165
00:10:30.169 --> 00:10:34.520
power and strategies of resistance to those abuses. So,

166
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.369
I'm not just focusing on domination in itself. I'd

167
00:10:38.369 --> 00:10:41.109
use the term domination broadly as a covering term

168
00:10:41.489 --> 00:10:44.969
for other, other kinds of abuses of hierarchical power,

169
00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:46.929
including uh exploitation.

170
00:10:48.719 --> 00:10:53.599
So let's get into the the morality aspect here.

171
00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:57.140
Why is it that both parties to the struggle

172
00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.119
in this particular case you talk about the hierarchs

173
00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:04.909
and the resisters strategically deploy moral concepts? I mean,

174
00:11:04.989 --> 00:11:06.210
what's. The function of that,

175
00:11:06.909 --> 00:11:09.710
that's the crucial question. Uh, I mean, you might

176
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.109
think, look, if there's a struggle between hierarchs and

177
00:11:12.109 --> 00:11:15.900
resisters, uh, they'll just, uh, each party will just

178
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.229
organize themselves by appealing to the self-interest of their

179
00:11:19.229 --> 00:11:21.780
group, right? Why should morality have anything to do

180
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.210
with it? Well, I think the idea is that

181
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.549
the reason that human beings are such good cooperators

182
00:11:29.549 --> 00:11:33.739
that they're Uh, have larger cooperative schemes and more

183
00:11:33.739 --> 00:11:37.719
flexible kinds of cooperation than any other. Living things

184
00:11:37.719 --> 00:11:42.760
on the planet is that they're able to achieve

185
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:48.989
cooperation by appealing to moral norms. This is important

186
00:11:48.989 --> 00:11:52.919
because an obstacle to cooperation and to forming any

187
00:11:52.919 --> 00:11:56.479
kind of coalition for cooperation is the self-interest of

188
00:11:56.479 --> 00:11:59.559
the individuals. Like there may be something that we're

189
00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:02.799
all supposed to do for the sake of cooperation.

190
00:12:03.299 --> 00:12:07.229
But any particular individual may have some incentives to

191
00:12:07.229 --> 00:12:12.229
defect from that scheme of cooperation. Uh, THE classic

192
00:12:12.229 --> 00:12:14.909
example in game theory is called the stag hunt.

193
00:12:15.229 --> 00:12:17.710
The idea is that, uh, two or more people

194
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.479
are cooperating to try to capture a, a deer

195
00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:23.349
or a stag of some kind to, to eat

196
00:12:23.349 --> 00:12:26.520
it. And there's a division of roles so that,

197
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.159
you know, you're supposed to stand over here and

198
00:12:30.159 --> 00:12:33.840
try to direct the, the, the stag when it's

199
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.599
running toward the person who's going to kill or

200
00:12:36.599 --> 00:12:40.239
capture it. And somebody else is supposed to do

201
00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:43.000
the killing and capturing. Well, suppose I'm sitting there

202
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.599
waiting for the stag, and I see a rabbit

203
00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:48.150
come by. And I can get the rabbit just

204
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.330
like this, and I can have it for myself.

205
00:12:50.909 --> 00:12:53.869
Well, if I do that, if I defect from

206
00:12:53.869 --> 00:12:57.429
playing my proper role, then this thwarts the cooperation

207
00:12:57.429 --> 00:13:00.590
of, of getting the stag. So, the, the, the

208
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.229
short-term interests of individuals can give them incentives to

209
00:13:04.229 --> 00:13:08.070
defect from their commitment to a cooperative scheme. One

210
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.630
of the things that morality does is to say,

211
00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:13.229
no, no, you shouldn't do that. You promised that

212
00:13:13.229 --> 00:13:15.700
you would be here. This bag, you made a,

213
00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:19.789
a commitment, and you are obligated to honor that

214
00:13:19.789 --> 00:13:23.849
commitment. And then you can enlist both the force

215
00:13:23.849 --> 00:13:28.130
of conscience and also uh sanctions by the community

216
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.650
for the violation of moral rules, including rules about

217
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.049
promise keeping. So the idea is that one of

218
00:13:34.049 --> 00:13:36.049
the reasons that humans are so good at cooperation

219
00:13:36.049 --> 00:13:40.169
is that their cooperation is morally structured. And if

220
00:13:40.169 --> 00:13:43.419
you, if you think of forming a coalition either

221
00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:47.330
as to resist or to reinforce hierarchy, those are

222
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.390
forms of cooperation. And so you get better cooperation,

223
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:55.330
you are better at recruiting people for your coalition

224
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.169
and keeping them sustained in their participation in it,

225
00:13:59.429 --> 00:14:01.390
if you can make a moral appeal, not just

226
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.469
an appeal to self-interest. Now, here's the second step

227
00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:08.429
in the argument, and that is that Moral appeals

228
00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:11.630
are more effective if they're embedded in an ideology,

229
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.109
that is, they're supported by a web of other

230
00:14:14.109 --> 00:14:17.909
beliefs about, in this case, about the proper uses

231
00:14:17.909 --> 00:14:21.909
of power, of hierarchical power. So this then becomes

232
00:14:21.909 --> 00:14:25.859
a competition that has a moral aspect, but the

233
00:14:25.859 --> 00:14:29.989
moral aspect is embedded in ideology. So there are

234
00:14:29.989 --> 00:14:33.780
competing ideologies and The ideologies are used by each

235
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.190
group to try to recruit and support coalitions and

236
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.669
to achieve collective action on the part of the

237
00:14:39.669 --> 00:14:43.809
coalitions. And they evolved in relationship to each other.

238
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.130
I mean, there was a, a capital, early capitalist

239
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.130
ideology, and then there was a leftist, Marxist ideology

240
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.809
which attacked it, and the capitalist ideology modified itself

241
00:14:55.809 --> 00:14:59.630
to try to respond, and then the leftist ideology

242
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.450
changes. So, there's a competition among ideologies, but it's

243
00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.409
all based on the need to form effective coalitions,

244
00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:10.489
either coalitions of resisters or coalitions of hierarchs.

245
00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.609
And so there is an ideology,

246
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:18.109
these ideologies generate new moral concepts, new moral ideas,

247
00:15:18.729 --> 00:15:23.010
right, but then there's a sort of co-evolution between

248
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.650
the opposing moralized strategies, correct?

249
00:15:27.049 --> 00:15:30.770
That, that's right. Right. Now, interesting thing about the

250
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.479
term evolution. Evolution doesn't mean progress, right? When we

251
00:15:34.479 --> 00:15:37.440
talk about the evolution of the biological species, it's

252
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.719
a mistake to say that the present-day chicken is

253
00:15:40.719 --> 00:15:44.510
a better chicken than the earlier chickens. Uh, BETTER

254
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:49.030
here just means more reproductively fit, able to pass

255
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.710
on, on more genes, and that depends on the

256
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.909
environment. So what's a, a, a good version of

257
00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:58.830
the chicken, chicken 2.0, uh, in one environment, maybe

258
00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:01.109
a bad one if the, if the standpoint of

259
00:16:01.109 --> 00:16:04.520
rebirth of fitness, if the environment changes. So similarly,

260
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.349
if you say that there's a co-evolutionary process between

261
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.200
Hierarchs and resistors that doesn't tell you that it's

262
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.479
going to end in things getting better, that things

263
00:16:12.479 --> 00:16:15.520
are gonna get better, and that's just a, a,

264
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.190
a different question. But the question is, can you

265
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.820
identify some patterns over the history of this struggle.

266
00:16:22.669 --> 00:16:27.690
Where The interaction actually has been morally progressive. It's

267
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.200
produced some good results. Can you identify those patterns,

268
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.169
and then if you have that knowledge, can that

269
00:16:33.169 --> 00:16:38.090
help you steer future social changes, uh, in a,

270
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.489
in a better direction. So if you find out

271
00:16:40.489 --> 00:16:44.429
that there are some especially effective strategies for resistors

272
00:16:44.489 --> 00:16:47.150
that have worked in the past. And you still

273
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.510
have a problem of dominating hierarchies, then the question

274
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.869
is, can you apply that knowledge about what's worked

275
00:16:53.869 --> 00:16:56.690
in the past to limit their power to help

276
00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:01.349
solve contemporary problems about the abuses of hierarchical power?

277
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:06.650
So there's something that I think you haven't addressed

278
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.910
there yet. How is it that ideologies make moral

279
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.010
appeals more effective?

280
00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:18.118
Yeah, I think um they do it by um

281
00:17:19.098 --> 00:17:22.140
supporting the moral appeals with a web of beliefs.

282
00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:23.729
The example I, I think I give in the

283
00:17:23.729 --> 00:17:27.459
book is, suppose that um somebody just has a

284
00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:31.979
kind of instinctive negative reaction toward abortion. They just

285
00:17:31.979 --> 00:17:35.790
say, abortion's wrong, we shouldn't allow it. Uh, AND

286
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:40.670
then, uh, somebody questions that. Uh, WELL, if the

287
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:45.229
person had an ideology which placed abortion in a

288
00:17:45.229 --> 00:17:50.650
larger framework, for example, a Catholic, uh, ideology about

289
00:17:50.989 --> 00:17:55.030
the proper function of sexuality and of rep of

290
00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:59.109
reproduction, uh, that sex should be for the sake

291
00:17:59.109 --> 00:18:04.229
of reproduction and that, uh, insoulment begins very early.

292
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.839
Then they would have a, a, a set of

293
00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:12.150
reasons for their belief that abortion is wrong. And

294
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.439
if they, that belief was challenged, they'd be better

295
00:18:15.439 --> 00:18:18.400
able to sustain that belief in the face of

296
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.689
criticism if they had this web of supporting beliefs,

297
00:18:22.719 --> 00:18:24.829
if it made sense in a larger kind of

298
00:18:24.829 --> 00:18:29.520
picture about moral principles. So I think that's one

299
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:35.310
reason why um Moral appeals that are invoked to

300
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.349
try to form and sustained coalitions in this struggle

301
00:18:38.349 --> 00:18:42.739
are more effective if they're not just freestanding and

302
00:18:43.219 --> 00:18:46.469
without support, but instead, if they're supported by a

303
00:18:46.469 --> 00:18:50.390
larger web of beliefs. And the thing about ideologies

304
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.040
and the beliefs they contain is That they have

305
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.400
what I call uh belief immune systems. That is,

306
00:18:56.479 --> 00:19:00.280
they have mechanisms for sustaining those beliefs in the

307
00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.560
face of contrary evidence. Uh, I'll give you an

308
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.880
example from my own life. I grew up in

309
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.599
an apartheid society in, in Little Rock, Arkansas. It

310
00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:13.599
was literally apartheid, institutionalized racism, top to bottom. And

311
00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:15.239
I was brought up as a racist, as a

312
00:19:15.239 --> 00:19:18.579
white, white kid. And I was uh told one

313
00:19:18.579 --> 00:19:21.099
of my ideological beliefs was that Black people are

314
00:19:21.099 --> 00:19:25.540
of inferior intelligence. Well, we had a housemaid, Louise,

315
00:19:25.619 --> 00:19:28.829
who was a Black person. She was very intelligent.

316
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.060
So one day, I think I was about 7

317
00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.060
or 8 years old, I say to my mother,

318
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.270
look, uh, These people are supposed to be not

319
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.849
very smart. Louise is one of them. She's very

320
00:19:38.849 --> 00:19:41.469
smart. How can that be? Do you know what

321
00:19:41.469 --> 00:19:43.949
my mother's answer was? She had a belief immune

322
00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:47.469
system in her ideology, racist ideology, which enabled her

323
00:19:47.469 --> 00:19:51.270
to reconcile the obvious intelligence of Louise with this

324
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.989
general belief about the inferior intelligous. She said, Louise

325
00:19:54.989 --> 00:20:00.949
must have some white blood. So she had some

326
00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:04.750
white blood and that countered the general tendency of

327
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:09.010
black people supposedly. This is an example of how

328
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:16.089
ideologies include these cognitive dissonance resolution mechanisms that enable

329
00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:21.130
to sustain beliefs when they're challenged. Uh, AND that's

330
00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.729
one of the things that makes ideology so motivationally

331
00:20:24.729 --> 00:20:30.530
effective, and it protects the moral element from challenges

332
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.329
and dissent.

333
00:20:32.709 --> 00:20:37.310
Right. So earlier I asked you about the co-evolution

334
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:42.109
between the opposing moralized strategies of hierarchs on the

335
00:20:42.109 --> 00:20:46.130
one side and uh resisters on the other. So,

336
00:20:46.229 --> 00:20:50.150
uh, could you explain also how the sort of

337
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:54.709
co-evolutionary dynamics also acts as a driver for the

338
00:20:54.709 --> 00:20:59.869
evolution of morality more broadly and of institutions.

339
00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:04.420
Yeah, I think, I think it's An exaggeration to

340
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.650
say it derives the evolution of morality generally. It

341
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.939
derives a particular part of political morality, uh, the

342
00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:14.020
part that has to do with the, the way

343
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.579
you rightfully gain power and rightfully exercise power. So

344
00:21:17.579 --> 00:21:21.180
it's, it's more limited in that way. But, uh,

345
00:21:21.579 --> 00:21:26.900
for example, uh, hierarchs, uh, in, in, say, Europe

346
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.339
in, in the Middle Ages used to justify their

347
00:21:30.339 --> 00:21:35.300
authority by saying that. Uh, THEY were, uh, appointed

348
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.380
by God, the divine right of, of kings sort

349
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:44.180
of theory. Uh, OR, uh, they also, uh, perhaps

350
00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.699
had the, uh, uh, an ideological, uh, take on

351
00:21:47.699 --> 00:21:51.040
why they should have authority that they were providing

352
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.979
a service of security and protection for their people

353
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.979
in exchange for people giving them a certain amount

354
00:21:57.979 --> 00:22:02.920
of the social surplus. Now, uh, at a certain

355
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.319
point, uh, you know, beginning early in the Enlightenment

356
00:22:06.319 --> 00:22:11.550
period, uh, the theological justification, the divine right of

357
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.319
king's view, no longer is, is, as convincing to

358
00:22:15.319 --> 00:22:18.640
as many people. And people begin to think that

359
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:23.420
whether a monarchy is justified or not depends upon

360
00:22:23.959 --> 00:22:27.189
how well the monarch is serving the people. All

361
00:22:27.189 --> 00:22:31.030
of the people eventually, not just the property classes,

362
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.329
the elites. And so there's a shift, and you

363
00:22:34.329 --> 00:22:37.209
get this in, there was a, a, a British,

364
00:22:37.349 --> 00:22:40.130
uh, philosopher named Filmer, and he wrote a book,

365
00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.750
uh, on patriarchy, which he claimed that he was

366
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.780
trying to support the divine right of theory of

367
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.589
King's view, and he claimed that contemporary monarchs were

368
00:22:49.589 --> 00:22:52.939
the descendants of Adam. And that they were, there

369
00:22:52.939 --> 00:22:55.849
was this lineage, this pedigree that gave them the

370
00:22:55.849 --> 00:23:00.069
authority that they had, and John Locke, the philosopher,

371
00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:04.000
wrote in his, uh, first, uh, treatise of government,

372
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.959
uh, a blow by blow refutation of, uh, Filmer's

373
00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.020
version of the divine right theory, and, uh, Locke

374
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.339
won. He clearly won, and he didn't win because

375
00:23:15.339 --> 00:23:19.109
he Immediately changed everybody's mind. There were already changes

376
00:23:19.109 --> 00:23:21.540
going on in the culture that were making the

377
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.750
divine right ideology less plausible to more people. So

378
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:29.130
then you get in Locke this idea that uh

379
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.680
The government, the rulers are really just the fiduciary

380
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.000
agents of the people. They serve at the will

381
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.800
of the people and only are legitimate if the

382
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.569
people consent to their rule. And this sets up

383
00:23:43.569 --> 00:23:50.130
a completely different framework for understanding resistance to hierarchies

384
00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:56.020
and for justifying revolution, because now, Uh, accept this

385
00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:01.729
new ideology, revolution to be justified whenever the people

386
00:24:01.739 --> 00:24:03.900
decide they don't want this set of people to

387
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.579
be their agent. Uh, AND they don't have to

388
00:24:06.579 --> 00:24:09.859
prove that they've been abusing their power. They don't

389
00:24:09.859 --> 00:24:12.699
have to show that there's been violation of a

390
00:24:12.699 --> 00:24:15.979
contract in that sense. It's just completely up to

391
00:24:15.979 --> 00:24:19.199
them. They're totally in charge. The rulers have no

392
00:24:19.199 --> 00:24:21.780
independent rights whatsoever. They only have the rights that

393
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.489
are conferred by their being designated as the agent.

394
00:24:24.699 --> 00:24:28.694
This is a radical change. In how authority is

395
00:24:28.694 --> 00:24:33.114
conceived and how resistance to authority, including a revolution,

396
00:24:33.604 --> 00:24:36.814
uh, is, is conceived. Uh, SO, uh, those are

397
00:24:36.814 --> 00:24:39.145
the kinds of changes that I'm talking about and,

398
00:24:39.454 --> 00:24:42.734
uh, often the changes come about in a completely

399
00:24:42.734 --> 00:24:46.795
unintended way. I mean, if you think about, uh,

400
00:24:46.935 --> 00:24:51.935
what happened in 1215 in England, at, at Runnymede

401
00:24:51.935 --> 00:24:56.290
where The barons of England gang up on King

402
00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:59.489
John and force him to sign the Magna Carta.

403
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.270
Now, The barons don't have any interest in protecting

404
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.469
the rights of the common people. They're worried about

405
00:25:07.469 --> 00:25:10.109
the encroachment of King John on their rights and

406
00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:13.630
privileges. So what they want to do is constrain

407
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.060
the monarch for their sake. But they do this

408
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.819
by issuing a document that says the king is

409
00:25:19.819 --> 00:25:25.280
not above the law. Now This is the beginning

410
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.239
of the idea that nobody is above the law

411
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.270
and that the law should apply equally to everyone.

412
00:25:31.319 --> 00:25:33.199
It's the beginning of the idea of the rule

413
00:25:33.199 --> 00:25:35.719
of law and equality before the law. The Magna

414
00:25:35.719 --> 00:25:38.400
Carta also includes a clause saying that there should

415
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.959
be a council of notables of higher aristocrats who

416
00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:46.199
are supposed to advise and constrain the king. This

417
00:25:46.199 --> 00:25:50.540
is the seed from which parliament grew. Now, when

418
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.890
the rule of law develops to encompass everybody, the

419
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.930
commoners, as well as the elites, and when you

420
00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:01.369
begin to get representative institutions, you have a power

421
00:26:01.369 --> 00:26:04.449
shift, which actually takes power away from the people

422
00:26:04.449 --> 00:26:07.489
who originated this process, the barons who were trying

423
00:26:07.489 --> 00:26:10.810
to constrain. Uh, THE king. They had no idea

424
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.369
that this was going to happen. It wasn't their

425
00:26:12.369 --> 00:26:15.729
intention. They didn't desire any such thing. Similarly, John

426
00:26:15.729 --> 00:26:18.800
Locke, you know, Locke does the second treatises of

427
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.770
government and gives an argument for revolution against an,

428
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:26.369
an overweening monarch, and he invokes the idea of

429
00:26:26.369 --> 00:26:29.369
natural rights, that, you know, the government is violating

430
00:26:29.369 --> 00:26:32.089
natural rights. Now, Locke is a member of an

431
00:26:32.089 --> 00:26:35.890
elite. He's a white male. He actually is a

432
00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:39.530
shareholder in a slave company, the Royal Africa Company,

433
00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.930
right? But this idea of natural rights that he

434
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:47.369
uses for the sake of the privileges and interests

435
00:26:47.369 --> 00:26:50.170
of his class, vis a vis the monarchy, later

436
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.569
is taken up by abolitionists, and after that, by

437
00:26:53.569 --> 00:26:57.530
feminists, and put to uses that are completely contrary

438
00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.290
to the interest of people like Locke, who first

439
00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:03.959
invoked the ideas. So this happens over and over

440
00:27:03.959 --> 00:27:08.339
again, this kind of backfire, uh, uh, mechanism, uh,

441
00:27:08.349 --> 00:27:11.000
that can contribute to, to moral progress.

442
00:27:12.989 --> 00:27:17.989
So as we've talked about this struggle between hierarchs

443
00:27:17.989 --> 00:27:23.770
and resisters is obviously uh political. It's also moral.

444
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:28.069
Can it also be epistemic in nature? And if

445
00:27:28.069 --> 00:27:29.619
so, in what ways?

446
00:27:29.989 --> 00:27:34.069
Yes, I think this is really important. I think

447
00:27:34.069 --> 00:27:38.380
that theories of social change often don't, uh, Give

448
00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:44.459
sufficient credit to epistemic improvements, improvements in the social

449
00:27:44.459 --> 00:27:48.030
environment in which we form beliefs and gain knowledge.

450
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.479
Let me give you an example from the struggle

451
00:27:50.479 --> 00:27:54.420
between hierarchy and resisters. Uh, SUPPOSE at a certain

452
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.920
point, you're say, looking at the history of England,

453
00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:01.819
uh, and you, you see that, uh, uh, There's

454
00:28:01.819 --> 00:28:05.579
been a, a movement that's exerted pressure on parliament,

455
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:11.949
and eventually, parliament has responded by uh recognizing a

456
00:28:11.949 --> 00:28:15.550
right to freedom of expression and freedom of association.

457
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.869
For example, the right to form unions, which were

458
00:28:17.869 --> 00:28:22.589
illegal for many, many decades. OK. Now, that's a,

459
00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.869
an accommodation, a concession that the people in power

460
00:28:25.869 --> 00:28:29.819
make to the demands for freedom of expression, freedom

461
00:28:29.819 --> 00:28:36.569
of association. And When this happens, then People are

462
00:28:36.569 --> 00:28:42.089
able to meet together, exchange views, develop their views

463
00:28:42.089 --> 00:28:46.109
about the rightful use of power. And they may

464
00:28:46.109 --> 00:28:49.829
then, on the basis of that knowledge and that

465
00:28:49.829 --> 00:28:52.790
coordination of their beliefs that they could only achieve

466
00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.349
because they had a right to freedom of expression

467
00:28:54.349 --> 00:28:57.229
and the rights of association, they make further political

468
00:28:57.229 --> 00:29:00.150
demands, like the extension of, of the right to

469
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:04.150
vote. OK, they're able because they have gotten this

470
00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:09.349
first gain, which improves their social epistemic environment, which

471
00:29:09.349 --> 00:29:14.709
improves their uh opportunities for learning together how best

472
00:29:14.709 --> 00:29:18.709
to pursue their interest against the resisters. They're able

473
00:29:18.709 --> 00:29:21.469
then to make new political demands and get new

474
00:29:21.469 --> 00:29:24.630
rights like the right for, you know, to vote

475
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:28.260
for larger numbers of people. So, part of what

476
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.420
goes on in the struggle is that There's an

477
00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:37.520
effort by the hierarchies to restrict the social epistemic

478
00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.920
environment in a way that disempowers potential resisters, right?

479
00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.099
If you can restrict freedom of expression, prevent the

480
00:29:45.099 --> 00:29:48.380
formation of unions and other forms of political association,

481
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.020
that's gonna handicap the people who are trying to

482
00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:56.520
resist you. So, when the resistors succeed in making

483
00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.719
certain political demands, it has the effect often of

484
00:29:59.719 --> 00:30:02.959
improving the social epistemic environment, which enables them to

485
00:30:02.959 --> 00:30:05.469
go on and make further kinds of gains. So,

486
00:30:05.479 --> 00:30:07.680
there's, there's a sense in which it's also a

487
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.310
struggle about who's going to control the social epistemic

488
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.619
environment, the environment in which people can come to

489
00:30:15.069 --> 00:30:19.800
recognize what their interests are, uh, mobilize effectively, develop

490
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:24.185
strategies. Uh, CONVERGE on strategies, uh, uh, like agreement

491
00:30:24.185 --> 00:30:26.704
on. So it's really a struggle about that as

492
00:30:26.704 --> 00:30:30.464
well. And, uh, uh, 11 dimension the struggle takes

493
00:30:30.464 --> 00:30:33.805
is getting the right to education for people, right?

494
00:30:33.905 --> 00:30:36.625
I mean, well, if you can keep people benighted,

495
00:30:36.744 --> 00:30:40.045
uh, illiterate, it's very hard for them to organize,

496
00:30:40.704 --> 00:30:43.984
uh, and, uh, so if, if you, if you

497
00:30:43.984 --> 00:30:47.234
see the struggle as including either by intention or,

498
00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:51.239
or just as a matter of unintended consequences. A

499
00:30:51.239 --> 00:30:56.020
struggle over who's gonna control the, the, the environment

500
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.500
in which we learn how to operate effectively in

501
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.829
politics. Then that gives you a whole, a whole

502
00:31:01.829 --> 00:31:05.180
new dimension to it. Uh, AND, uh, in, in,

503
00:31:05.229 --> 00:31:08.949
in general, it's in the interest of, uh, dominating

504
00:31:08.949 --> 00:31:14.859
hierarchies to have a defective social epistemic environment. Uh,

505
00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.969
BECAUSE a better social epistemic environment is going to

506
00:31:17.969 --> 00:31:20.670
provide resources for people to resist them better.

507
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.910
So, let's get into one of the main topics

508
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:28.349
of your book. Let's talk about revolution. So, first

509
00:31:28.349 --> 00:31:32.030
of all, what is revolution? How do you define

510
00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:32.270
it?

511
00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.550
You know, uh, when I started studying this, I

512
00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:36.670
had no idea how the term had undergone a

513
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:42.930
change. Originally, a revolution meant a kind of return

514
00:31:43.229 --> 00:31:46.380
to a starting point. Now, that's not what we

515
00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.540
mean by revolution at all. No, I mean, there

516
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.500
was these, there were these views in ancient Greece

517
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.939
and Rome of cyclical periods, right? Where you might

518
00:31:53.939 --> 00:31:56.459
have a democracy and then it would degenerate and

519
00:31:56.459 --> 00:31:59.209
come back to a kingship, sort of over and

520
00:31:59.209 --> 00:32:01.819
over again. Revolution in the way that a wheel

521
00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:05.319
revolves, right? That was the original. But then, uh,

522
00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.170
later in, in the, in the 1600s, maybe, maybe

523
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.849
a little earlier, a revolution comes to be thought

524
00:32:12.849 --> 00:32:16.140
of as a fundamental change in the type of

525
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:22.250
government brought about not through uh Law-like processes, but

526
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:26.119
by some extralegal and often violent process. So, a

527
00:32:26.119 --> 00:32:29.920
fundamental change in the type of government. Now, it's

528
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.729
interesting that there's a debate among scholars about whether

529
00:32:32.729 --> 00:32:35.930
the so-called American Revolution was really a revolution or

530
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.689
not, because in some ways, it was just an

531
00:32:38.689 --> 00:32:41.719
extrapolation of political developments that have been going on

532
00:32:41.719 --> 00:32:46.140
in the UK since Magna Carta, right? The growing

533
00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.500
power of the parliament and the diminishing power of

534
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.060
the monarch. Well, the Americans just took it to

535
00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.209
the last step. They got rid of the monarch,

536
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.739
right? But otherwise, they, they incorporated a lot of

537
00:32:57.739 --> 00:33:00.619
the features of the, of the English political legal

538
00:33:00.619 --> 00:33:02.819
system. So, there's one group that says that now,

539
00:33:02.969 --> 00:33:05.219
it's not really an American revolution, it's not that

540
00:33:05.219 --> 00:33:07.140
profound. And there are other people, oh no, it

541
00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.885
really was. Uh, uh, A, a change in the

542
00:33:10.885 --> 00:33:13.314
fundamental, a fundamental change in the type of government,

543
00:33:13.525 --> 00:33:14.724
but then you have to get down and say,

544
00:33:14.805 --> 00:33:16.814
well, what counts as a fundamental change? And uh,

545
00:33:17.045 --> 00:33:19.724
so I've sides of that debate. I've looked at

546
00:33:19.724 --> 00:33:23.405
cases where everybody would agree it's a revolution, the

547
00:33:23.405 --> 00:33:27.234
French Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, uh, the Chinese, uh,

548
00:33:27.244 --> 00:33:31.484
Maoist revolution, uh, and then I've, I've asked the

549
00:33:31.484 --> 00:33:37.250
question, well, Under what circumstances are revolutions likely to

550
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.410
produce morally progressive results? I mean, we have some

551
00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:44.209
pretty bad results from the major revolutions. And so

552
00:33:44.209 --> 00:33:47.770
the question is, what role should revolution play in

553
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.810
a theory of progressive moral change? And how do

554
00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:56.489
you explain the radical difference in outcomes between, say,

555
00:33:56.569 --> 00:33:59.130
the American Revolution, if you call it that, or

556
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.989
the English Revolution of 1688 on the one hand.

557
00:34:02.869 --> 00:34:06.469
And the outcome of the French Revolution and the

558
00:34:06.469 --> 00:34:09.728
Bolshevik Revolution on the other. And I have a

559
00:34:09.728 --> 00:34:13.080
theory about this. I have a theory that What

560
00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.958
largely determines the outcome of a revolution is the

561
00:34:16.958 --> 00:34:20.820
context in which the revolution occurs. And in particular,

562
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
I distinguish between two really different contexts. One I

563
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.228
call the Lockian context and the other, the Hobbesian

564
00:34:28.228 --> 00:34:34.219
context. Now, the Lockian context, you have civil society

565
00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:39.319
organizations and you have people who have learned how

566
00:34:39.319 --> 00:34:44.638
to cooperate in a peaceful, consensus-based way, and you've

567
00:34:44.638 --> 00:34:48.779
had leaders who've emerged in these civil society organizations.

568
00:34:49.118 --> 00:34:52.118
So there's something to work with when a revolution

569
00:34:52.118 --> 00:34:55.520
occurs. On the other hand, if you have a

570
00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:01.139
really ruthless dictatorship, it's prevented civil society from existing.

571
00:35:01.439 --> 00:35:05.320
It doesn't allow any private organizations unless it totally

572
00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.750
controls them. And so there's nobody there who has

573
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:13.629
any experience in government. And no experience in building

574
00:35:13.629 --> 00:35:18.909
consensus peacefully, persuading people. There's no basis for the

575
00:35:18.909 --> 00:35:21.229
kind of trust that you need. And what happens

576
00:35:21.229 --> 00:35:24.010
in the hobbying context is that the revolution starts,

577
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:27.229
there are two struggles that the, the people who

578
00:35:27.229 --> 00:35:30.389
want to make the revolution have to, to engage

579
00:35:30.389 --> 00:35:33.110
in. They've got to get enough people to participate.

580
00:35:34.209 --> 00:35:37.820
And they don't have any institutions by which they

581
00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:41.540
can persuade people to participate, and they often use

582
00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.580
coercion to get people to participate. They try to

583
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.659
make it more costly for you to sit out

584
00:35:47.659 --> 00:35:49.419
the revolution or be on the side of the

585
00:35:49.419 --> 00:35:53.340
regime than to participate. They even use terrorism against

586
00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.000
their own people to do this. The other problem

587
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.020
they have to solve is leadership. You need somebody

588
00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.860
to organize the revolutionary effort, and if there are

589
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:08.889
no Uh, institutions and no traditions of peacefully selecting

590
00:36:08.889 --> 00:36:13.370
leaders. There's often a bloody and violent competition to

591
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:16.379
see who's going to lead the revolution. Now, in

592
00:36:16.379 --> 00:36:18.979
those circumstances, the sort of Hobbesians, where there are

593
00:36:18.979 --> 00:36:23.459
no supporting non-governmental institutions that can help solve the

594
00:36:23.459 --> 00:36:27.239
participation and the leadership problem, you end up having

595
00:36:27.239 --> 00:36:31.979
a kind of uh uh ruthless competition, uh, and

596
00:36:31.979 --> 00:36:36.020
the people who end up uh successfully leading the,

597
00:36:36.139 --> 00:36:40.300
the competition, uh, leading the revolution have already developed

598
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:46.360
habits of, of ruthlessness and brutality and top-down. Exertion

599
00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.360
of authority. And they don't just magically give those

600
00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.080
up the minute they, they, uh, win the revolutionary

601
00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.659
struggle. On the other hand, if you take like

602
00:36:55.659 --> 00:37:00.699
the American Revolution. There were colonial legislatures in all

603
00:37:00.699 --> 00:37:03.300
of the 13 colonies that have been in operation

604
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:08.290
for over 100 years. And They had developed a

605
00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:14.270
culture of democratic consensual decision-making. Leaders had emerged. There

606
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:16.669
was a lot of social capital in the form

607
00:37:16.669 --> 00:37:19.590
of trust. And then there was the Continental Congress,

608
00:37:19.629 --> 00:37:24.469
which operated, uh, immediately before the, the, the fighting

609
00:37:24.469 --> 00:37:27.659
started and, and through the revolution. And so they

610
00:37:27.659 --> 00:37:31.649
had resources for solving the problem of getting enough

611
00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:36.550
people to participate and solving leadership problem without top-down

612
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.030
brutal coercion. And I think this made a difference

613
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:43.820
in the outcome. Of the American Revolution, uh, and

614
00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.399
why you can see it went in a different

615
00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:50.520
direction from these revolutions where they didn't have those

616
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:55.739
social resources. Uh, SO, uh, and, and this has

617
00:37:55.739 --> 00:38:00.419
kind of a paradoxical implication, namely, where you lead,

618
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.620
where you need revolution the most, where the regime

619
00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.699
is the most oppressive, you're less likely to get

620
00:38:06.699 --> 00:38:09.899
good results from a revolution. That's not a happy

621
00:38:09.899 --> 00:38:14.669
conclusion for me to draw, right? Uh, YOU know,

622
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.860
uh, 00, by the way, there's a lesson here

623
00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.959
about the Iranian Revolution in 1979. The Shah had

624
00:38:20.959 --> 00:38:25.270
pretty much destroyed all civil society organizations except the

625
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:30.639
network of madrassas and mosques, the, the clergy-led, uh,

626
00:38:31.399 --> 00:38:34.239
organizations. And so when the Shah was toppled, the

627
00:38:34.239 --> 00:38:37.270
only people in a position. To take control of

628
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:41.189
the revolution were the Muslim clerics, and they happen

629
00:38:41.189 --> 00:38:46.229
to be extremely fundamentalist and one of the theocracy.

630
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:50.350
And so that, that's a case where you had

631
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.590
almost a totally Hobbscene situation. You had nothing going

632
00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.590
on in civil society that could be a resource

633
00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:59.590
for a relatively peaceful revolutionary transition, but you did

634
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:03.340
have one group that was intact. And because they

635
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.379
were the only group intact, they were able to

636
00:39:05.379 --> 00:39:07.669
take control and we're seeing the results of that

637
00:39:07.669 --> 00:39:10.020
now. Mhm.

638
00:39:10.959 --> 00:39:14.550
You know, it's very interesting, while you were talking,

639
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.040
something that came to my mind and in the,

640
00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.639
in the meanwhile, I looked it up because I

641
00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:24.699
didn't, I, I didn't have it memorized, but are

642
00:39:24.699 --> 00:39:30.320
you familiar with Eric Chenoev's work on revolutions and

643
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.439
when they are successful or not?

644
00:39:33.899 --> 00:39:39.379
Um, I'm not sure. I thought I had read

645
00:39:39.379 --> 00:39:42.280
when was this book published? How, uh,

646
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.679
I'm, I'm not talking about the specific book. I'm,

647
00:39:45.689 --> 00:39:49.870
uh, she, she's a sociologist if I remember correctly,

648
00:39:50.159 --> 00:39:53.080
and she does work. I, I know that she

649
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.679
has a book published. I can't remember the exact

650
00:39:55.679 --> 00:39:58.000
title now, but I, I, I mean, I'm, I'm

651
00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.260
just going to

652
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.320
go through, say, say her name again. Say her

653
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:02.719
name again.

654
00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:05.360
Erica Chenoweth.

655
00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:11.040
I'm, I'm, uh, Embarrassed that I'm not familiar with

656
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:11.250
it. Uh,

657
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.060
NO, no, no, no, it's not a problem at

658
00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.979
all. I, I mean, I, I'm going, I'm just

659
00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:17.620
going through, I'm going to go through some of

660
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:22.020
the, what she identified as the key factors for

661
00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.860
success, and perhaps you can tell me what you

662
00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.419
think about them and if they sort of uh

663
00:40:28.419 --> 00:40:31.155
correspond to. Some of the ideas you already have,

664
00:40:31.235 --> 00:40:34.155
so she says that, uh, one of the key

665
00:40:34.155 --> 00:40:38.995
factors is mass mobilization and momentum. So movements must

666
00:40:38.995 --> 00:40:43.114
achieve a high level of broad and diverse participation

667
00:40:43.114 --> 00:40:45.745
from across society, and, uh,

668
00:40:45.754 --> 00:40:52.709
she says that that this means, uh. Inclusive efforts

669
00:40:52.709 --> 00:40:56.629
to to build a coalition right appeal to the

670
00:40:56.629 --> 00:40:59.189
interest of broader sections of the population to get

671
00:40:59.189 --> 00:41:02.739
a critical mass. So I'm, I'm right, yeah.

672
00:41:03.379 --> 00:41:05.860
Uh, RIGHT, and I, I think if I remember

673
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:10.080
correctly, I think that she says that usually around

674
00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:16.300
3% of the population is enough to conduct a

675
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:20.919
revolution. So, uh, and then she also points to

676
00:41:21.139 --> 00:41:24.620
the factions from pillars of support, and that includes

677
00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:28.772
people. Like the military, the police, economic elites, which

678
00:41:28.772 --> 00:41:32.772
basically weakens the autocrats' power, uh, and then she

679
00:41:32.772 --> 00:41:37.532
also talks about resilience and backfire, that is movements

680
00:41:37.532 --> 00:41:43.252
must withstand escalating state repression by maintaining discipline and

681
00:41:43.252 --> 00:41:46.946
turning violent acts by the regime against itself. Making

682
00:41:46.946 --> 00:41:51.946
the repression seem unjust and turning public opinion against

683
00:41:51.956 --> 00:41:55.325
against the government, uh, and then she also refers

684
00:41:55.325 --> 00:42:00.565
to uh tactical innovation, I mean strategic innovation in

685
00:42:00.565 --> 00:42:06.125
nonviolent tactics such as strikes and civil disobedience, so

686
00:42:06.125 --> 00:42:08.246
I mean what do you think about that?

687
00:42:08.969 --> 00:42:10.850
Uh, uh, I agree with all of this, and

688
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:13.250
by the way, it's, it, it's similar to a

689
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.870
book that I do talk about a little bit

690
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:18.030
in the, in, in, in my book, um, that

691
00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.560
Tries to uh also give an account of uh

692
00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:29.239
when revolutions succeed and where, when revolutionary leaderships maintain

693
00:42:29.239 --> 00:42:32.399
power through the revolution and after the revolution, and

694
00:42:32.399 --> 00:42:35.949
they name the same kinds of factors. Uh, NOW,

695
00:42:35.959 --> 00:42:39.320
on this thing about resilience, um, uh, I think

696
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.520
it's important to focus on the fact that any

697
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.080
revolutionary movement is going to have setbacks. And the

698
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.800
question is, can it continue and keep its sufficient

699
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.879
level of support even if it has setbacks? And

700
00:42:51.879 --> 00:42:55.429
I think this is one place where, um, there

701
00:42:55.429 --> 00:42:59.080
are two factors that distinguish the revolutions that succeed

702
00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:03.479
in, in, uh, surviving setbacks. One is that they

703
00:43:03.479 --> 00:43:08.149
have to have a highly disciplined leadership. Uh, uh,

704
00:43:08.199 --> 00:43:11.919
AND, and, and the Marxist, the Leninist ideology is

705
00:43:11.919 --> 00:43:15.060
that you have to have a core group of

706
00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:21.020
professional revolutionaries subject to rigid party discipline who will

707
00:43:21.479 --> 00:43:25.199
continue no matter what happens. The other factor is

708
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.810
You need an ideology which will explain away your

709
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:33.409
failures. Right. And in the case of the French

710
00:43:33.409 --> 00:43:37.379
Revolution, when the French army first goes on a,

711
00:43:37.459 --> 00:43:39.939
a, a, a mission of conquest, they first uh

712
00:43:39.939 --> 00:43:43.260
invade Austria, and they have terrible setbacks. They're defeated

713
00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.620
in the first battles. Well, the, the revolutionary leadership

714
00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.820
in Paris says, oh, it's not because we gave

715
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.540
them bad instructions. It's not because, you know, we

716
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:59.459
did anything wrong. It's the foreign aristocrat plot. There

717
00:43:59.459 --> 00:44:04.090
were traitors among our generals. That's why we failed,

718
00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:09.320
OK. And similarly, when uh the economic policies uh

719
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:13.260
of uh expropriating grain from the countryside in, in

720
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:18.199
Russia, To feed the industrial workers, uh, fail to

721
00:44:18.199 --> 00:44:23.360
increase productivity. The explanation is klas, rich peasants who

722
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.100
are really bourgeoisie or undermining the efforts or wreckers,

723
00:44:27.469 --> 00:44:33.280
that, you know, hidden bourgeois counterrevolutionaries. These ideologies always

724
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:38.639
invoke some kind of mechanism to try to insulate

725
00:44:38.639 --> 00:44:44.250
the leadership from people recognizing their failures. That's, that's

726
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:47.129
really, I think, a crucial element of, of what

727
00:44:47.129 --> 00:44:49.449
goes on. But, no, I agree with, uh, and,

728
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:53.850
and these items that she mentions as the determining

729
00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:57.250
factors in whether refers succeed or not, they're, they're

730
00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:01.159
fairly widely endorsed. I mean, in the, the, uh,

731
00:45:01.169 --> 00:45:03.850
other books that I've read, say a, a, a

732
00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:06.689
similar, uh, tell a similar kind of story about

733
00:45:06.689 --> 00:45:10.090
why some revolutions succeed and some fail. Now, a

734
00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:13.260
factor that she didn't mention. That I think is

735
00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.580
important in some revolutions is whether there is third

736
00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:22.729
party support or opposition. For the revolutionaries, right, uh,

737
00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.379
and, uh, in, in the, in the case of

738
00:45:25.379 --> 00:45:29.139
the American Revolution, there was tremendous support by France.

739
00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.939
France sent, sent, uh, uh, many soldiers and lots

740
00:45:32.939 --> 00:45:37.580
of munitions and war supplies, uh, to the, to

741
00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:41.340
the, uh, rebelling Americans, uh, to fight against the

742
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:44.899
British. And I don't think that. The Americans would

743
00:45:44.899 --> 00:45:48.260
have won the Revolutionary War, uh, or it would

744
00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.520
have taken them maybe another 10 years to win

745
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.959
it without French support. There was also Spanish support.

746
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.260
The, the French were out in the, in the

747
00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:59.689
open about their support. The, the Spanish found it,

748
00:45:59.699 --> 00:46:03.379
uh, advisable to do it covertly. Uh, THEY set

749
00:46:03.379 --> 00:46:08.300
up shell merchant, uh, Uh, companies, uh, and, but

750
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.419
they, uh, they transported a tremendous amount of military

751
00:46:11.419 --> 00:46:16.100
supplies to the Americans, uh, uh, covertly during the

752
00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.979
revolution. So, uh, the American Revolution wasn't just, uh,

753
00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.929
a matter of the Americans in a self-sufficient way

754
00:46:22.929 --> 00:46:26.639
defeating the British. They had tremendous help from, uh,

755
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.020
from Spain and from England, uh, from Spain and

756
00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.489
France. Yeah.

757
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:36.449
And what do you make of When, for example,

758
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:40.750
has happened in the French Revolution, uh, after the

759
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:43.669
revolution there was a period called the reign of

760
00:46:43.669 --> 00:46:47.709
terror, and so I mean sometimes it happens that

761
00:46:47.709 --> 00:46:51.969
in revolutions and particularly when they're headed by particular

762
00:46:51.969 --> 00:46:55.909
people who tend to have certain paranoid tendencies and

763
00:46:55.909 --> 00:47:00.860
so want to purge everyone internally and externally. They

764
00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.929
might deem to be enemies of the new regime

765
00:47:04.929 --> 00:47:08.500
or the revolution. I mean, when something like that

766
00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:12.659
happens, do you deem that to be a failed

767
00:47:12.659 --> 00:47:14.459
revolution, or not? Uh,

768
00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.530
BOY, that's, that's a really good question. I mean,

769
00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.340
the, the, the terror in the French Revolution, the,

770
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:22.879
the, the terror was, uh, uh, about 18 months,

771
00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:29.979
uh, 1793, 1794, uh, and, uh. So some people

772
00:47:29.979 --> 00:47:32.219
who, who just focus on that say the French

773
00:47:32.219 --> 00:47:36.139
Revolution was a failure. Um. I think it's hard

774
00:47:36.139 --> 00:47:40.669
to make. Overall judgments about whether a revolution was

775
00:47:40.669 --> 00:47:44.030
a failure or success. Um, THEY could be successful

776
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:46.149
in some ways and not in others. One way

777
00:47:46.149 --> 00:47:51.010
the French Revolution was successful was that it undermined

778
00:47:51.229 --> 00:47:56.719
hereditary privilege. Uh, AND it separated two kinds of

779
00:47:56.719 --> 00:48:00.320
power that the, uh, the nobility had in the

780
00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.719
past. They had property rights, but they also had

781
00:48:03.719 --> 00:48:05.850
ruling rights. If you were the lord of an

782
00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:09.320
estate. You not only owned the property and could

783
00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.239
extract uh surplus value from your peasants, but you

784
00:48:13.239 --> 00:48:16.040
were the magistrate, you were the judge who you

785
00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.679
had a government power and a private property power.

786
00:48:18.919 --> 00:48:22.040
The French Revolution separated those. The government power all

787
00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.899
went to the centralized state. And the private property

788
00:48:25.899 --> 00:48:29.300
was left intact, and the inequality of the private

789
00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:34.419
property system was not significantly changed by the French

790
00:48:34.419 --> 00:48:38.040
Revolution. The property owning of the church was destroyed,

791
00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:42.199
but the church lands were generally then bought by

792
00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:45.179
people who are already wealthy. In fact, there's some

793
00:48:45.179 --> 00:48:50.500
evidence that, uh, economic inequality increased after the revolution.

794
00:48:50.989 --> 00:48:55.590
Rather than decrease. So if you're concerned about arbitrary

795
00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:59.810
inequal economic inequalities, the French Revolution was a failure

796
00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:04.310
on that. If you were concerned about the idea

797
00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:08.070
of careers open to talent and abolishing hereditary privilege,

798
00:49:08.169 --> 00:49:12.179
it was a success. To a large extent Uh,

799
00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:14.139
so I think, you know, you, you have to

800
00:49:14.139 --> 00:49:18.979
make a more fine-grained judgment, um, but, uh, you,

801
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.739
you mentioned this sort of paranoid tendency in the

802
00:49:21.739 --> 00:49:23.820
terror. Well, that happened not just in the French

803
00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:28.580
Revolution but also in, uh, uh, the Bolshevik revolution

804
00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:31.989
and in the Stalinist regime that followed the revolution.

805
00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:37.540
Uh, Stalin just basically destroyed anybody who he thought

806
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:41.419
might possibly be an enemy. Uh, NOW, you've got

807
00:49:41.419 --> 00:49:47.580
to realize that this wasn't entirely paranoid because Stalin

808
00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:51.100
grew up in the context of the Bolshevik Party,

809
00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:56.530
which was this completely ruthless professional revolutionary group led

810
00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:01.000
by Lenin. And all the people around him were

811
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.280
quite ready to murder him if they thought they

812
00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.159
could gain power by doing it. The, the sense

813
00:50:07.159 --> 00:50:10.159
in which he wasn't paranoid, but it was because

814
00:50:10.159 --> 00:50:15.300
of the particular culture of the Bolshevik Party. Uh,

815
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.719
ANY sign of weakness on the part of the

816
00:50:17.719 --> 00:50:21.554
leader would mean people would form some coalition and

817
00:50:21.554 --> 00:50:23.754
step forward and try to topple him. So, he

818
00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:27.774
just acted preemptively. He destroyed anybody that he thought

819
00:50:28.114 --> 00:50:32.034
might possibly mobilize against him at some point. Uh,

820
00:50:32.114 --> 00:50:34.465
AND this meant killing his old friends and comrades.

821
00:50:34.514 --> 00:50:36.834
He, he wiped out the old Bolsheviks, the people

822
00:50:36.834 --> 00:50:39.715
that had with him had created the revolution and

823
00:50:39.715 --> 00:50:43.534
put him in power. Uh, REALLY quite incredible.

824
00:50:45.399 --> 00:50:50.919
And I mean, what, uh, what kind of distinction

825
00:50:50.919 --> 00:50:56.000
can we establish between democratic and fascist revolutions?

826
00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.520
Uh, WELL, you know, it's interesting. I, I say

827
00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.350
that I'm not gonna talk about fascist revolutions because

828
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:04.919
I'm concerned about the potential of revolutions to be

829
00:51:04.919 --> 00:51:08.879
morally progressive. I think that fascist revolutions by their

830
00:51:08.879 --> 00:51:12.360
very nature are, are not likely to be progressive

831
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:16.469
except maybe in some unintended consequence way. Um, BUT,

832
00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:23.370
uh, uh, fascist revolutions are, um, Anti-democratic, so far

833
00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:27.350
as the, the fascist ideology includes the leadership principle,

834
00:51:27.969 --> 00:51:29.370
that is that there has to be, you know,

835
00:51:29.479 --> 00:51:31.409
in the Italian case of the Duce or in

836
00:51:31.409 --> 00:51:36.050
the German case, the, the Fuhrer, uh, somebody who

837
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:40.090
has absolute power, some individual who has absolute power,

838
00:51:40.129 --> 00:51:41.649
and there's a, there's a sort of cult of

839
00:51:41.649 --> 00:51:44.750
personality, uh, theory about the virtues of the leader.

840
00:51:45.699 --> 00:51:49.820
That's the stinctive of fascism. Fascism also, uh, as

841
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:52.419
far as I know, most scholars of fascism say

842
00:51:52.419 --> 00:51:56.419
fascism has a central element of racism or racial

843
00:51:56.729 --> 00:52:01.780
inequality, racial hierarchy. Uh, AND of course, democratic revolutions

844
00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.899
are, are in principle aimed at a more inclusive

845
00:52:04.899 --> 00:52:09.959
view about who matters. Uh, THEY deny fundamental, uh,

846
00:52:09.979 --> 00:52:15.689
natural differences in, in status among individuals. Uh. So

847
00:52:15.689 --> 00:52:20.110
I think uh Now, interesting about fascist revolutions, you

848
00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:22.830
know, in the United States now, there's this tremendous

849
00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:25.830
political division between people on the extreme left and

850
00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:30.149
extreme right. And uh many people on the extreme

851
00:52:30.149 --> 00:52:35.169
right think that there's a, a, a really robust

852
00:52:35.229 --> 00:52:39.070
danger of a communist or socialist revolution in the

853
00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:41.899
United States. Now I think there's a risk of

854
00:52:41.899 --> 00:52:43.850
a revolution, but I don't think there's a risk

855
00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:46.219
of a, I think there's more of a risk

856
00:52:46.219 --> 00:52:51.560
of a fascist. Uh, REVOLUTION. And one reason there

857
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:53.040
is that, if you think about what it would

858
00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.199
take, well, first of all, there has never been

859
00:52:55.199 --> 00:53:00.510
a successful communist revolution in an advanced industrial country.

860
00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:05.560
They've been basically peasant revolutions, OK. So that makes

861
00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.800
it improbable that there would be a communist revolution.

862
00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:11.239
And one reason that communist revolutions don't occur in

863
00:53:11.239 --> 00:53:15.280
advanced capitalist society is that there are entrenched institutions,

864
00:53:15.479 --> 00:53:18.800
including the Constitution, property rights systems, and a huge

865
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.159
amount of power in the form of the people

866
00:53:21.159 --> 00:53:23.979
who have the most wealth in the capitalist economy.

867
00:53:24.379 --> 00:53:27.820
And it's very hard to, to overcome that. With

868
00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.939
fascism, you don't have to do that. You don't

869
00:53:29.939 --> 00:53:33.179
have to destroy the capitalist system. Instead, you co-opt

870
00:53:33.179 --> 00:53:36.909
the capitalists. I mean, what, what the, uh, uh,

871
00:53:37.219 --> 00:53:40.060
what the Nazis did was they promised the capitalists

872
00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:43.419
that they would uh protect them against the communist

873
00:53:43.419 --> 00:53:48.409
revolution, against the Bolshevik, uh, Jewish conspiracy. And that

874
00:53:48.409 --> 00:53:51.229
they would be able to maintain their power so

875
00:53:51.229 --> 00:53:54.870
long as they cooperated with the, the leader. The,

876
00:53:54.909 --> 00:53:59.979
the, so, it's much easier. For a fascist revolution

877
00:53:59.979 --> 00:54:02.659
to occur in a, in an advanced capitalist country

878
00:54:02.659 --> 00:54:04.699
because they don't have to overthrow capitalism to do

879
00:54:04.699 --> 00:54:07.739
it, right? Uh, THAT'S one reason. But also, in

880
00:54:07.739 --> 00:54:10.639
the United States, there's always been a sort of,

881
00:54:10.659 --> 00:54:17.360
uh, element of Authoritarian pop populism that's been a,

882
00:54:17.439 --> 00:54:20.159
a, a kind of continuity, and there was a

883
00:54:20.159 --> 00:54:23.719
strong Nazi Party in the American, uh, in American

884
00:54:23.719 --> 00:54:27.580
society until uh the US entered World War II.

885
00:54:27.919 --> 00:54:31.000
There were large rallies, Nazi rallies in Madison Square

886
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.159
Garden and elsewhere, and there were key, uh, public

887
00:54:34.159 --> 00:54:37.860
figures like Charles Lindbergh, the famous aviator, who were

888
00:54:38.159 --> 00:54:42.179
very sympathetic to the Nazis in Germany. Um, ALSO,

889
00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:45.679
you got to realize that At the time of

890
00:54:46.649 --> 00:54:50.399
between the two wars, about 20% of the American

891
00:54:50.399 --> 00:54:54.280
population was of German descent. And, uh, many of

892
00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:56.280
them were quite sympathetic to what was going on

893
00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.439
in Germany. Uh, I think that this is sort

894
00:54:58.439 --> 00:55:00.120
of a, a bit of a regression but a

895
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:04.379
briefing. I think that Franklin Delano Roosevelt with his

896
00:55:04.379 --> 00:55:07.629
New Deal, his Institution of a sort of a

897
00:55:07.629 --> 00:55:11.389
minimal welfare state in the United States. AVERTED a

898
00:55:11.389 --> 00:55:14.909
fascist revolution. In the 1930s, there were fascist revolution,

899
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:18.709
anti-democratic revolutions going on everywhere. It looked like democracy

900
00:55:18.709 --> 00:55:21.360
was on its way out. And I think it

901
00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.840
could have, as a result of people perceiving that

902
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.120
democracies hadn't dealt with the Great Depression, right? They

903
00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:31.489
hadn't solved the economic problem. And I think that

904
00:55:31.489 --> 00:55:33.000
there was a lot of sentiment like that in

905
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.439
the United States, and I think that by producing

906
00:55:36.439 --> 00:55:38.879
these welfare programs and pulling the country out of

907
00:55:38.879 --> 00:55:43.860
the Great Depression, uh, What Roosevelt did was to

908
00:55:44.199 --> 00:55:50.050
undercut the, the, uh Potential for a fascist revolution.

909
00:55:50.429 --> 00:55:52.510
I think it's exactly what Bismarck did, you know,

910
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:55.669
Bismarck instituted the German welfare state, not because he

911
00:55:55.669 --> 00:55:58.709
cared about the common people, but because he thought

912
00:55:58.709 --> 00:56:02.250
it would avoid a socialist revolution. And he was

913
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:06.489
right. So, so I think, uh, you know, if

914
00:56:06.489 --> 00:56:08.489
you talk about, I don't think a revolution is

915
00:56:08.489 --> 00:56:10.949
very likely in the United States of any kind.

916
00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:12.909
But if I had to bet which was more

917
00:56:12.909 --> 00:56:16.449
likely, I certainly wouldn't bet on a socialist or

918
00:56:16.449 --> 00:56:19.449
communist revolution, not, not in a country with the

919
00:56:19.449 --> 00:56:22.689
disparity of income that we have and the political

920
00:56:22.689 --> 00:56:26.149
power that goes with it. I mean, Elon Musk

921
00:56:26.149 --> 00:56:29.840
is worth $400 billion. Mhm.

922
00:56:31.909 --> 00:56:34.290
It's insane. It's completely insane.

923
00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.709
Yeah, it's, well, and, uh, in major US corporations,

924
00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:42.629
the CEO has a rate of composition that's over

925
00:56:42.629 --> 00:56:46.370
300 times higher than that of the average workers,

926
00:56:47.790 --> 00:56:50.919
and those enormous disparities of wealth translate into disparities

927
00:56:50.919 --> 00:56:56.139
of political power. Yeah, and it's very hard to

928
00:56:56.139 --> 00:56:57.879
overthrow that political power.

929
00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:03.419
Right. And you also haven't had the Communist Party

930
00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:06.370
in the US for a very long time,

931
00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.379
right? Well, you know, one of the results of

932
00:57:09.379 --> 00:57:13.419
the Cold War was that it destroyed the left-wing

933
00:57:13.419 --> 00:57:17.320
presence in American labor. American Labor is the most

934
00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:20.199
conservative labor group in the world, as far as

935
00:57:20.199 --> 00:57:23.840
I know. Uh, IN, in the Cold War, the

936
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:29.370
struggle against the Soviet Union resulted in purging. Uh,

937
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:32.929
FROM every part of society, anybody on the left,

938
00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:36.030
I mean, anybody was viewed as, you know, a,

939
00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:39.739
a fellow traveler of the Soviet communists if they

940
00:57:39.739 --> 00:57:45.199
had the mildest social democratic ideas. Uh, AND, uh,

941
00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:47.149
so that's, you know, we're, we're living with the

942
00:57:47.149 --> 00:57:50.320
consequences of the Cold War today. I mean, the

943
00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:53.199
US quote, won the Cold War, but at a

944
00:57:53.199 --> 00:57:59.159
price of, uh, really debilitating its, uh, domestic politics

945
00:57:59.159 --> 00:58:04.000
from uh seriously considering anything like social democracy of

946
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.320
the kind that you have in Europe.

947
00:58:07.139 --> 00:58:10.340
Yeah, you, you know, here, here in Portugal, we

948
00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:13.419
still have a Communist Party that is a very

949
00:58:13.419 --> 00:58:18.260
old party over 100 years old, and they participated

950
00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:23.580
during the, uh, right-wing dictatorship that ran from 1932

951
00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:28.699
up to 1974 here in Portugal. They participated in

952
00:58:28.699 --> 00:58:32.850
resistance against the regime and they They were jailed

953
00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:36.169
and politically persecuted and then they also helped with

954
00:58:36.169 --> 00:58:41.409
the revolution in 1974, but I mean nowadays they

955
00:58:41.409 --> 00:58:45.570
are pretty much a reformist party. I mean they,

956
00:58:45.649 --> 00:58:49.489
they pretty much want to work within capitalism and

957
00:58:49.489 --> 00:58:55.330
just reform things like improving uh working conditions, increasing

958
00:58:55.330 --> 00:59:00.040
the minimum wage, more social. Benefits improving the education

959
00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:03.760
system, the healthcare system. I mean, the most extreme

960
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.800
view that they have, I think, is that they

961
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.520
think we should leave the European Union, but apart

962
00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:10.239
from that,

963
00:59:10.879 --> 00:59:13.520
yeah, no, this has happened in many, many communist

964
00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:16.060
parties, I think. I mean, the, the, the, the

965
00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:21.120
strategy of the, of the bourgeoisie of creating a

966
00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:26.350
welfare state that just Uh, generous enough to, uh,

967
00:59:26.689 --> 00:59:30.449
prevent people from becoming revolutionaries, but not generous enough

968
00:59:30.449 --> 00:59:33.209
to change the basic power structure. This has been

969
00:59:33.209 --> 00:59:36.860
a brilliant success, and then it means that, uh,

970
00:59:36.889 --> 00:59:40.610
parties that previously might have been revolutionaries become reformists,

971
00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:44.209
you know, as you're saying, and, uh, yeah, uh.

972
00:59:45.169 --> 00:59:47.340
But if, you know, if Marx is right, there

973
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:52.139
are the, the most fundamental Negative features of capitalism

974
00:59:52.139 --> 00:59:55.020
cannot be reformed away. Uh, AS long as you

975
00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:59.969
have, uh, employer monopoly, you have people who have

976
01:00:00.739 --> 01:00:03.699
Control over the means of production and can dictate

977
01:00:03.699 --> 01:00:07.580
the terms and unfair bargains of who works for

978
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:11.939
them, you're going to have exploitation and domination and

979
01:00:12.219 --> 01:00:15.659
that, according to the Marxist view, that's an inherent,

980
01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:19.320
not a contingent feature of the capitalist system. And

981
01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.520
the only way you can get rid of that

982
01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.479
is by getting rid of the capitalist system. And

983
01:00:22.479 --> 01:00:25.330
I think there are very few people who, who

984
01:00:25.399 --> 01:00:28.189
are willing to take the risks of an unpredictable

985
01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:32.350
outcome of a revolution. Uh, IF they're, you know,

986
01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:36.129
doing well enough in the, in the capital system.

987
01:00:36.469 --> 01:00:38.550
Uh, AND, and the capitalist system has other kinds

988
01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:42.129
of mechanisms. I mean, the whole consumer culture and,

989
01:00:42.439 --> 01:00:47.939
uh, advertising, uh, diverts people's attention from the flaws

990
01:00:47.939 --> 01:00:51.370
of the political system and the economic system, and,

991
01:00:51.449 --> 01:00:53.709
uh, puts them on a sort of a path

992
01:00:53.709 --> 01:00:57.969
of perpetual striving for more and better things. Uh,

993
01:00:58.030 --> 01:01:00.469
YOU know, and, and, uh, I think as long

994
01:01:00.469 --> 01:01:04.110
as that's, uh, powerful, um, people will put up

995
01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:08.199
with a lot of defects in the system. Um

996
01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:13.750
Yeah, so in regards to revolutions, uh, there is

997
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:16.530
one thing I haven't asked you about yet. So,

998
01:01:17.149 --> 01:01:21.830
um, when it comes to political ideologies, how can

999
01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:27.229
they either facilitate or thwart revolutionary collective action?

1000
01:01:28.229 --> 01:01:32.689
Good, good. Um, I think that, uh, the way,

1001
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.649
uh, the Frankfurt School and people on the left,

1002
01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:40.149
uh, and, and Marx himself thought about ideologies, he

1003
01:01:40.149 --> 01:01:45.270
thought of them as misrepresenting, uh, a system of

1004
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:50.110
domination in a way that, uh, prevents people from

1005
01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:55.689
taking seriously the idea of overthrowing the system. So

1006
01:01:55.689 --> 01:01:58.419
it, it's not that it, uh, ideology in this

1007
01:01:58.419 --> 01:02:01.580
sense causes a collective action problem. It prevents people

1008
01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.629
from even getting to the point of seriously considering

1009
01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:09.260
acts that might have collective action problems. Uh, SO

1010
01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.219
I mean, if, if you have an ideology that

1011
01:02:11.219 --> 01:02:14.449
tells you that The inequalities in your society are

1012
01:02:14.449 --> 01:02:18.459
natural or inevitable or they're the result of dessert,

1013
01:02:18.659 --> 01:02:21.340
you know, that people have more dessert more, then

1014
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:25.260
you, you're not gonna be thinking seriously about trying

1015
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:28.860
to change the system. Um, ON the other hand,

1016
01:02:28.939 --> 01:02:34.659
you can have emancipatory or revolutionary ideologies which tell

1017
01:02:34.659 --> 01:02:39.689
people that. The way things have been represented is

1018
01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:42.689
false. The system is not working in your interest.

1019
01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:44.639
It's not going to work in your interest, so

1020
01:02:44.639 --> 01:02:49.750
it's got to be a fundamental change, and The

1021
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:54.330
idea is that this kind of uh emancipatory revolutionary

1022
01:02:54.330 --> 01:03:00.310
ideology will motivate people in such a way that

1023
01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:05.100
they don't do the kind of self-interested calculations that

1024
01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:08.070
lead to collective action problems. I mean, the classic

1025
01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:10.830
collective action problem is the free-rider problem, you know,

1026
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.750
you say, well, yeah, revolution would be a good

1027
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:14.709
idea, but whether the revolution is gonna succeed or

1028
01:03:14.709 --> 01:03:17.149
not is not gonna depend on whether I participate.

1029
01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.120
My participation could be a cost to me. It

1030
01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.879
might even get me killed. So I'll just sit

1031
01:03:22.879 --> 01:03:25.959
back and see if other people do it. Another

1032
01:03:25.959 --> 01:03:27.750
version of the collective action problem is called the

1033
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:31.479
assurance problem. I'd be willing to make the sacrifices

1034
01:03:31.479 --> 01:03:33.439
and run the risk of participating in rep if

1035
01:03:33.439 --> 01:03:36.520
I had assurance that enough other people would participate

1036
01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:40.040
to reach the critical threshold necessary for success, but

1037
01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.600
I don't have that assurance. Well, the thing about

1038
01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:48.010
Ideology, so far as they include moral commitments, especially

1039
01:03:48.010 --> 01:03:52.409
ideas about justice, is they tell people that you

1040
01:03:52.409 --> 01:03:55.850
ought to do this regardless. That is you, you,

1041
01:03:55.939 --> 01:03:58.489
you should have an unconditional commitment. You should, you

1042
01:03:58.489 --> 01:04:00.649
should do it even if you're not sure that

1043
01:04:00.649 --> 01:04:03.469
enough other people participate. It's a matter of your

1044
01:04:03.689 --> 01:04:08.840
expressing your moral identity of showing integrity. And even

1045
01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.629
if you think you could sit out the revolution,

1046
01:04:11.879 --> 01:04:14.439
you shouldn't sit out the revolution because this is

1047
01:04:14.439 --> 01:04:18.100
your revolution. This is for, for your sake, and

1048
01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.520
you are the people who have to do it.

1049
01:04:20.639 --> 01:04:23.760
It, it can sort of substitute the I thinking

1050
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.159
for the we thinking, right? This is what we

1051
01:04:26.159 --> 01:04:30.040
ought to do. All of us. And, and so

1052
01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.659
there, there's a sense in which ideologies can either

1053
01:04:33.159 --> 01:04:39.550
thwart collective action or promote collective action. Uh, I,

1054
01:04:39.629 --> 01:04:42.590
I think of ideologies as maps that are shared

1055
01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:47.510
by people. They give a characterization of the landscape,

1056
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:51.409
and they give guidance. They coordinate people's beliefs about

1057
01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:53.889
the way things are, the way things could be,

1058
01:04:54.429 --> 01:04:58.070
and they enable collective action by getting people to

1059
01:04:58.070 --> 01:05:01.850
think in terms of we rather than I.

1060
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:08.659
Mm. Right, but do you think that ideology itself

1061
01:05:08.659 --> 01:05:12.379
can play a role, a causal role in revolution?

1062
01:05:12.419 --> 01:05:15.340
I mean, because as you know, I mean, we

1063
01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:19.810
can have perhaps a, a sort of Marxist materialist

1064
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:22.719
approach to this and say, oh no, it's not

1065
01:05:23.379 --> 01:05:28.915
ideas or ideologies that Cause revolutions, it's the material

1066
01:05:28.915 --> 01:05:31.774
conditions that people live in, it's the material conditions

1067
01:05:32.155 --> 01:05:34.975
people respond to, or you can be perhaps an

1068
01:05:34.985 --> 01:05:39.155
anthropologist or a human behavioral ecologist and say, oh,

1069
01:05:39.195 --> 01:05:44.834
it's not ideology itself, it's the ecological, the social,

1070
01:05:44.915 --> 01:05:48.679
the economic, the political conditions people live in. That

1071
01:05:48.679 --> 01:05:53.100
lead them to uh participate in revolutions and then

1072
01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:57.399
ideologies are something that comes after the fact in

1073
01:05:57.399 --> 01:05:59.959
the sense that they are sort of post hoc

1074
01:05:59.959 --> 01:06:05.620
rationalizations and ways of trying to create a coherent

1075
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:12.675
uh a coherent uh. Intellectualization of what we're wanting

1076
01:06:12.675 --> 01:06:17.314
to do there and perhaps mobilizing people and enabling

1077
01:06:17.314 --> 01:06:20.715
what's already going to happen anyway, so I mean,

1078
01:06:20.875 --> 01:06:25.915
uh, is it possible to establish whether ideologies really

1079
01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:29.354
do have or play a causal role in revolutions

1080
01:06:29.354 --> 01:06:29.935
or not?

1081
01:06:30.649 --> 01:06:33.290
Yeah, I think, I think that they can play

1082
01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.530
a causal role and there's good evidence that they

1083
01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:40.810
do because differences in ideologies correlate at least pretty

1084
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:44.899
strongly with differences in The way, the way revolutions

1085
01:06:44.899 --> 01:06:48.300
are conducted and then the outcomes, uh, and if

1086
01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:51.100
you contrast the kind of ideology of the American

1087
01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:54.010
Revolution with the ideology of the Bolsheviks or the,

1088
01:06:54.379 --> 01:06:57.219
uh, or the radical French during the terror, you

1089
01:06:57.219 --> 01:07:00.929
can see that they're not just differences in ideologies,

1090
01:07:01.219 --> 01:07:05.100
but they seem to, uh, correlate very strongly with

1091
01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.699
differences in the way the revolution is conducted and

1092
01:07:07.699 --> 01:07:13.020
the outcomes. I don't think ideologies are Autonomously effective.

1093
01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:17.060
I think whether an ideology has any causal effect

1094
01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:21.719
depends upon uh, uh, a complex of contextual features,

1095
01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:24.739
uh, and that, uh, you don't wanna think of

1096
01:07:24.739 --> 01:07:29.300
it as, well, ideology versus interest. You, you wanna

1097
01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:34.500
think of ideologies as harnessing and coordinating interest and

1098
01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:38.580
providing justifications for pursuing interest in ways that go

1099
01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:41.949
against the ordinary moral rules. So it's not like

1100
01:07:41.949 --> 01:07:46.229
ideology or interest or ideology or material conditions. It's,

1101
01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:50.510
uh, if ideologies have a causal role, it's only

1102
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:54.949
because there are various enabling conditions, um, alignment with

1103
01:07:54.949 --> 01:07:59.659
the interest, important interest and, uh, material conditions, epistemic

1104
01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:03.070
conditions that allow the diffusion of the ideology. Now

1105
01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:05.959
I think that most people writing on revolution, uh,

1106
01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:10.389
now. Uh, ACKNOWLEDGE that there's some causal role for

1107
01:08:10.389 --> 01:08:14.229
ideologies, they just disagree as to how significant the

1108
01:08:14.229 --> 01:08:17.310
role is or which aspects of the process or

1109
01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:22.930
the outcome are causally influenced by, uh, ideologies. Um,

1110
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:27.580
AGAIN, I think It would be surprising if ideology

1111
01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:30.430
didn't have some causal role, given the way I

1112
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:34.189
framed the problem, that is that the revolutionaries and

1113
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:37.589
the counterrevolutionaries have to form coalitions and sustain those

1114
01:08:37.589 --> 01:08:40.870
coalitions and if possible, recruit people from the other

1115
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:43.580
coalition into their group, right? This was the, the

1116
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.310
author that you mentioned said this is important. They

1117
01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:48.910
need to get defection of some key people, military

1118
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:51.399
people and others to join the revolution. Yes, if,

1119
01:08:51.649 --> 01:08:54.679
if that's, if that's the problem. Then you have

1120
01:08:54.679 --> 01:08:57.559
to ask, well, what's gonna motivate people to join

1121
01:08:57.559 --> 01:09:02.198
your coalition, and if you only depended on self-interest,

1122
01:09:02.408 --> 01:09:05.298
it might be very hard to recruit people because

1123
01:09:05.398 --> 01:09:07.578
you have the free rider of the insurance problem.

1124
01:09:07.917 --> 01:09:11.559
But if you can appeal to their moral identity,

1125
01:09:11.758 --> 01:09:15.770
if you can tap into their moral motivations. Then

1126
01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:18.930
you be more likely not just to recruit them

1127
01:09:18.930 --> 01:09:22.770
initially, but to keep them participating in the coalition

1128
01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:26.250
even when there are adverse uh problems that you

1129
01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:29.129
run into setbacks of the revolution. So, uh, I

1130
01:09:29.129 --> 01:09:33.207
think it's uh Well, uh, uh, I mean, think

1131
01:09:33.207 --> 01:09:35.749
about it. Both parties in a real revolutionary struggle

1132
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:39.769
make ideological appeals. I mean, think about Franco, your,

1133
01:09:39.929 --> 01:09:43.469
in your neighboring country, in Spain, you know, uh.

1134
01:09:44.109 --> 01:09:46.750
I mean, you know, he, he basically said, look,

1135
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:50.629
these, these socialists and communists, they want to destroy

1136
01:09:50.629 --> 01:09:53.390
our religion and they want to destroy our family,

1137
01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:58.149
and religion and family and patriotism are the most

1138
01:09:58.149 --> 01:10:00.990
important virtues of human beings. This was, this was

1139
01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:05.620
basically the simplified version of, of Franco's uh Message

1140
01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.859
and also order, right, that that these are people

1141
01:10:08.859 --> 01:10:11.100
who want to destroy the order. They don't know

1142
01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:13.100
what they're going to replace it with, and if

1143
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.689
the order is destroyed, there will be chaos and

1144
01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:19.060
everybody will suffer. So the, the appeal to these

1145
01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:25.569
sort of patriarchal traditional values, religion, nationalism. Um, THE

1146
01:10:25.569 --> 01:10:29.930
family along with the claim that we'll protect you

1147
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:32.890
against disorder, if that's not an ideology, I don't

1148
01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:35.609
know what it is, and I, I think it'd

1149
01:10:35.609 --> 01:10:39.910
be surprising. If Franco and his people were so

1150
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:42.910
stupid that they expended a lot of resources on

1151
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:45.750
pushing that message, if it had no, if they

1152
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:47.870
thought it would have no effect whatsoever, and on

1153
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:51.189
the other side there was a, an ideology. Now

1154
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:53.029
the other side was split into different groups. There

1155
01:10:53.029 --> 01:10:55.509
were, you know, there were anarchists and there were

1156
01:10:55.509 --> 01:10:59.359
communists and others, uh, but they had some, uh,

1157
01:10:59.379 --> 01:11:03.029
commonalities. One commonality was that they had an ideology

1158
01:11:03.029 --> 01:11:07.350
of secularization. They wanted to. To destroy the political

1159
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:09.830
power of the, of the Catholic Church in Spain.

1160
01:11:10.589 --> 01:11:13.029
Uh, SO I, I think, you know, if you're

1161
01:11:13.029 --> 01:11:15.709
trying to motivate people to take the risk of

1162
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:21.399
involving themselves in either revolution or counterrevolution, You've got,

1163
01:11:21.779 --> 01:11:24.740
uh, uh, appeal to them, um, and not just

1164
01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.259
on the basis of self-interest. Uh, AND that's why

1165
01:11:27.259 --> 01:11:31.279
I think ideologies do, do play some role. Um,

1166
01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:34.419
NOW, you know, there's a, a famous book on

1167
01:11:34.419 --> 01:11:38.200
called, uh, The State and Social revolution by Scope

1168
01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:42.200
pole. And she says that uh uh two apparently

1169
01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.540
contrary things. She says, well, yes, ideologies but Play

1170
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:48.140
some role, then she says, but they, they don't

1171
01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:50.459
really determine the outcome of the revolution. And what

1172
01:11:50.459 --> 01:11:53.660
she means is that the ideology can claim that

1173
01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:56.100
they're gonna provide equality for everybody, and then you

1174
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:58.560
end up with a dictatorship in the, in the,

1175
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:02.419
so that's completely compatible with everything I say about

1176
01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:05.220
it, about it. It's not that there will be

1177
01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:08.250
fidelity to all elements of the evolution of the

1178
01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:12.859
ideology if the revolution succeeds, but nonetheless, the ideology

1179
01:12:12.859 --> 01:12:17.120
can play a role in. Uh, In the success

1180
01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.830
of the revolution, along with other factors, if it

1181
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:23.520
enables people to believe that they have to defer

1182
01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.459
completely to the leadership. And maintain discipline and if

1183
01:12:28.459 --> 01:12:31.660
it explains away the temporary setbacks and failures of

1184
01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:33.100
the revolutionary leadership.

1185
01:12:34.629 --> 01:12:37.919
Mhm. OK, so I would like to ask you

1186
01:12:37.919 --> 01:12:42.439
just one question that falls under the rubric of

1187
01:12:42.439 --> 01:12:45.600
the ethics of revolution because I mean if we

1188
01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.740
were to get now into uh an in-deep exploration

1189
01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:53.479
of the ethics of revolution, we could be here

1190
01:12:53.479 --> 01:12:56.729
for the next 3 hours, I guess. And, and

1191
01:12:56.729 --> 01:12:58.859
I mean, in a couple of weeks, I'm going

1192
01:12:58.859 --> 01:13:02.049
to interview Doctor Jeff McMahon from the University of

1193
01:13:02.049 --> 01:13:05.649
Oxford about the ethics of political violence. So I

1194
01:13:05.649 --> 01:13:08.169
guess that's some of that, I will leave for

1195
01:13:08.169 --> 01:13:10.640
that interview. But let me just ask you then,

1196
01:13:11.009 --> 01:13:14.080
what do you think is the distinction between just

1197
01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:17.229
and unjust revolutionary violence?

1198
01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:21.339
Uh. Here's the distinction I make in the book

1199
01:13:21.339 --> 01:13:24.500
that I think is made often enough. There are

1200
01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:29.160
two arenas in which revolutionary violence may, may occur.

1201
01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:36.600
One is in Coercing people to participate and violently

1202
01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.319
solving the leadership problem. Those two things have to

1203
01:13:39.319 --> 01:13:42.819
be done before there can be a revolutionary war

1204
01:13:43.399 --> 01:13:47.549
against the state, because a war means an organized

1205
01:13:47.549 --> 01:13:51.759
military effort, right? The state already has solved that

1206
01:13:51.759 --> 01:13:55.160
problem. It, it's already solved the, the problem of

1207
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.640
having enough troops and having a leadership structure, but

1208
01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.970
the revolutionaries have to create that before they can

1209
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:05.600
really go to war with the, the regime. Now

1210
01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:08.790
they can engage in acts of violence either against

1211
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:10.479
the regime or against their own people to try

1212
01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:13.200
to get them on board, but those are two

1213
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.330
different settings in which violence can occur. And in

1214
01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:22.149
the Real revolutionary War setting, I think there's, generally

1215
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:26.470
speaking, the ethics of wars in general apply. Because

1216
01:14:26.479 --> 01:14:29.089
by that time, the revolutionary group has become more

1217
01:14:29.089 --> 01:14:31.319
like a state. It's already organized. It has an

1218
01:14:31.319 --> 01:14:33.609
army, it's a command structure, but, but in the,

1219
01:14:33.729 --> 01:14:37.609
in the earlier phase, I'm not sure that the

1220
01:14:37.609 --> 01:14:40.479
principles of just war tell us a lot about

1221
01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:43.680
what's right or. Wrong on the part of the

1222
01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.040
use of revolutionaries to solve, you know, the participation

1223
01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.040
of leadership problem. That's a separate, and it's very,

1224
01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:53.319
it's a very difficult situation because they have so

1225
01:14:53.319 --> 01:14:56.399
few resources at the beginning. There's such an asymmetry

1226
01:14:56.399 --> 01:14:59.919
of military power. Uh, AND if you look at

1227
01:14:59.919 --> 01:15:04.779
the actual tactics of Revolutionaries at, in, in that

1228
01:15:04.779 --> 01:15:09.509
arena at that early stage, uh, they often engage

1229
01:15:09.509 --> 01:15:13.390
in acts which you otherwise just call terrorism, right?

1230
01:15:13.439 --> 01:15:16.669
I mean, uh, one is what's called the propaganda

1231
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:19.259
of the deed where, and, and by the way,

1232
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:22.640
the best film ever made on revolution is the

1233
01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.990
Battle of Algiers, directed by Gilo Pontecorvo. It's, it's

1234
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:29.189
a, it's a film that's used as a training

1235
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:34.580
film by the CIA and al-Qaeda. That tells you

1236
01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:37.020
something about it, OK. And in it, at the

1237
01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:40.299
very beginning, uh, uh, a, a young man comes

1238
01:15:40.299 --> 01:15:42.580
up and just shoots a French policeman on the

1239
01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:46.200
street. Now, the people who told him to do

1240
01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.600
that are under no illusion that this is going

1241
01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:52.799
to make the French government change its behavior. The

1242
01:15:52.799 --> 01:15:55.009
audience for that act of violence is not the

1243
01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:58.290
French government, it's the Algerian people. IS to tell

1244
01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:02.049
the Algerian people we have power, we can hurt

1245
01:16:02.049 --> 01:16:08.040
them. Because one thing An oppressive ideology does is

1246
01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.609
deprive people of a sense of agency. That they

1247
01:16:11.609 --> 01:16:14.779
can change the regime. So when this guy goes

1248
01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:18.339
up and he shoots this policeman, he's saying, we

1249
01:16:18.339 --> 01:16:22.459
can hurt them. We have power. That's the beginning

1250
01:16:22.459 --> 01:16:25.339
of revolutionary consciousness. The other thing that revolutionaries do

1251
01:16:25.339 --> 01:16:29.410
is If anything, I think more morally problematic, and

1252
01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:34.890
that is they deliberately provoke the regime to excessive

1253
01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:39.080
use of force. They organize a peaceful demonstration, but

1254
01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.569
then they do something to make sure that the

1255
01:16:41.569 --> 01:16:45.529
government will respond with excessive force. And when this

1256
01:16:45.529 --> 01:16:49.049
happens, it radicalizes a lot of people because people

1257
01:16:49.049 --> 01:16:52.120
get the message the government doesn't care about us.

1258
01:16:52.359 --> 01:16:55.680
There's no limit to the brutality they'll use. There's

1259
01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.560
no alternative but revolution. So, there, there are many

1260
01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:03.799
strategies that successful revolutionaries use that are highly morally

1261
01:17:03.799 --> 01:17:09.919
problematic. Um, AND that's where the real hard work

1262
01:17:09.919 --> 01:17:13.080
of the ethics of revolutionary violence occurs. It's not

1263
01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:16.680
in this later when those problems have been solved

1264
01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:19.959
and you have a real revolutionary army that can

1265
01:17:19.959 --> 01:17:23.339
act in a state-like fashion against the, the regime,

1266
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.020
and I, I think that, uh, it's just enorm

1267
01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.669
enormously difficult, you know, if the current regime is

1268
01:17:30.669 --> 01:17:34.979
horrible enough. Uh, AND the only alternative is revolution,

1269
01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.229
then you might think that some acts of revolutionary

1270
01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:40.140
violence are justified that otherwise would never be justified

1271
01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:44.229
in any other less extreme circumstances. But the problem

1272
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:47.660
is, if you, uh, if you have a revolutionary

1273
01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:53.259
leadership that, uh, Persistently engages in these very morally

1274
01:17:53.259 --> 01:17:57.310
problematic acts of violence, it's a delusion to think

1275
01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:59.899
that once they consolidate power, they're going to quit

1276
01:17:59.899 --> 01:18:03.270
acting like that. They will, they will develop the

1277
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:07.270
habit of violence. And also, uh, in the process

1278
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:09.229
of coming to their position of power, they've made

1279
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:13.189
enemies. They have to worry about those enemies trying

1280
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:15.509
to overthrow them, right? They've hurt a lot of

1281
01:18:15.509 --> 01:18:18.580
people. And so that's another reason why they tend

1282
01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:24.200
to Consolidate power and use it preemptively to destroy

1283
01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.899
anybody who might be a threat, and that means,

1284
01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.770
you know, you're going to get a very nasty

1285
01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:29.500
regime.

1286
01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.479
Right, so, uh, I mean, I would like to

1287
01:18:33.479 --> 01:18:37.029
get now into the topic of moral progress. I

1288
01:18:37.029 --> 01:18:39.160
have a few questions I would like to ask

1289
01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:41.759
you about it, and then I have just two

1290
01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:47.899
final questions about hierarchy. So, um, We've talked actually

1291
01:18:47.899 --> 01:18:51.560
about moral progress in our previous conversation about your

1292
01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.180
other book, Our moral faith, but uh I would

1293
01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:56.279
like to ask you now, how do you respond

1294
01:18:56.279 --> 01:19:02.520
to challenges coming from skepticism about moral progress, namely

1295
01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:08.959
it being tainted by its misuses in justifying colonialism

1296
01:19:09.299 --> 01:19:12.919
and the truth and the truth of normative ethical

1297
01:19:12.919 --> 01:19:13.939
relativism.

1298
01:19:14.689 --> 01:19:17.250
Yeah. Um, I, I do talk about this quite

1299
01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:19.330
a bit in the book. Uh, uh, I think

1300
01:19:19.330 --> 01:19:23.450
there are Two different sources of skepticism about, or

1301
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:27.490
at least two sources of skepticism about, about moral

1302
01:19:27.490 --> 01:19:30.250
progress discourse. One is what you said is the

1303
01:19:30.250 --> 01:19:33.169
tainted view is that this concept has been so

1304
01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:39.890
abused in justifying colonialism or in justifying brutal state

1305
01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:43.169
communist regimes that we just should take it off

1306
01:19:43.169 --> 01:19:47.490
the table. It's too dangerous, OK. Well, I'm reluctant

1307
01:19:47.490 --> 01:19:49.479
to agree with that because there are lots of

1308
01:19:49.479 --> 01:19:52.839
concepts that have been misused, but we find it's

1309
01:19:52.839 --> 01:19:55.790
still important to be able to use them. The,

1310
01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:58.589
the concept of virtue, for example, right? I mean,

1311
01:19:58.899 --> 01:20:03.790
in Roman times, virtue meant basically Physical courage of

1312
01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:07.790
males, right? In the Victorian era, virtue means the

1313
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:11.109
chastity of women to a large extent, right? It's

1314
01:20:11.109 --> 01:20:14.109
based on a totally sexist part. So, but I

1315
01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:16.229
think, I still think we need the term virtue,

1316
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:19.270
you know, and there's a whole virtue ethics literature

1317
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:21.709
now. So I, I think the question is, can

1318
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:25.250
we rehabilitate the term and dissociate it from these

1319
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:27.509
abuses, and I think it's worth trying to do

1320
01:20:27.509 --> 01:20:30.259
that. Now, another source that you mentioned is ethical

1321
01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:32.899
relativism is if you think that there's no such

1322
01:20:32.899 --> 01:20:36.419
thing as what's right or wrong in general, but

1323
01:20:36.419 --> 01:20:38.700
things are only right or wrong relative to a

1324
01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:42.899
particular culture or moral code, then you won't be

1325
01:20:42.899 --> 01:20:46.060
able to talk about moral progress for humanity. You

1326
01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:47.660
might be able to talk about moral progress for

1327
01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:50.959
this group, you know, improvements relative to their moral

1328
01:20:50.959 --> 01:20:54.180
standards, but you can't do that. Well, uh, I

1329
01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:57.299
think there's some truth in In ethical relativism, I

1330
01:20:57.299 --> 01:21:04.279
think that people overestimate the extent of Correct moral

1331
01:21:04.279 --> 01:21:08.040
principles. I think there's a, there's a very small

1332
01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:12.560
set of moral principles that are universally valid, that

1333
01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.240
is, they're, that they are principles that anybody ought

1334
01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.950
to try to observe regardless of other differences in

1335
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:20.620
their moral code. So I think there's like a

1336
01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:24.299
range of relativism that's quite large, but there's a

1337
01:21:24.299 --> 01:21:28.779
small area of non-relativism, uh, and, and, and as

1338
01:21:28.779 --> 01:21:33.129
long as you're talking about moral progress only, uh,

1339
01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:36.609
refers to that relatively small core of things like,

1340
01:21:36.689 --> 01:21:39.580
you know, slavery is bad, for example, then I

1341
01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:42.759
think you're on, you're immune to criticisms from the

1342
01:21:42.759 --> 01:21:47.419
ethical relativists. Um, NOW the other, the other source

1343
01:21:47.419 --> 01:21:54.299
of Skepticism about moral progress judgments is The fact

1344
01:21:54.299 --> 01:22:00.060
that Some change can be good in one dimension

1345
01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:04.740
or one aspect of morality, but have negative consequences

1346
01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:09.140
in another. And so, uh, social change is often

1347
01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:12.180
a mixed bag. There are positive and negatives. And

1348
01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:15.060
it may not be possible to sort of total

1349
01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:17.939
it all up and get a net score as

1350
01:22:17.939 --> 01:22:20.930
to whether it was an improvement or not, because

1351
01:22:20.939 --> 01:22:23.939
some of these different dimensions may be incommensurable. They

1352
01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.700
just, they, they're not the kinds of things you

1353
01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:27.859
could put on a common scale. So if you

1354
01:22:27.859 --> 01:22:31.740
take the plurality of values really seriously, And that

1355
01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:34.939
they're not all reducible to one thing, and you

1356
01:22:34.939 --> 01:22:38.439
realize that social change can favor some values while

1357
01:22:38.859 --> 01:22:42.419
not favoring others, it's very hard to make uh

1358
01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:46.220
moral progress judgments. Uh, YOU could say, well, uh,

1359
01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:49.680
the abolition of slavery in the British Empire, uh,

1360
01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:54.089
was an improvement in that situation. But then you

1361
01:22:54.089 --> 01:22:56.319
have to ask, well, what else was going on?

1362
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:59.009
Here, here's another example, OK. I think there's been

1363
01:22:59.009 --> 01:23:03.569
an improvement in attitudes toward non-human animals in this

1364
01:23:03.569 --> 01:23:07.209
sense. You don't have public cat burnings in Paris

1365
01:23:07.209 --> 01:23:09.080
anymore, which they used to have in the 16th

1366
01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:13.069
century, right? And you don't have public displays of

1367
01:23:13.319 --> 01:23:17.529
excruciatingly cruel punishment for criminals in the way that

1368
01:23:17.529 --> 01:23:19.729
you used to, to have. You know, you don't

1369
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:21.370
draw on a quarter of people or break them

1370
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:25.330
on the wheel or That kind of thing. Uh,

1371
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:28.350
BUT take the case of animals. OK, we don't

1372
01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:32.310
have public cat burnings and, uh, dog fights and,

1373
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:36.310
and, uh, cockfights are, uh, illegal in many places.

1374
01:23:37.209 --> 01:23:42.689
But you have massive suffering through factory farming. We're

1375
01:23:42.689 --> 01:23:47.729
probably hurting more animals now. Causing more animal suffering

1376
01:23:47.729 --> 01:23:51.100
than we ever have. Uh, AND so,

1377
01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:53.609
uh, well, let, let me just tell you, uh,

1378
01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:58.459
it's a very, I, I would say unfortunate thing,

1379
01:23:58.549 --> 01:24:02.259
but for example, here in Portugal, uh, and in

1380
01:24:02.259 --> 01:24:05.209
Spain as well in the south of France, we

1381
01:24:05.209 --> 01:24:07.169
still have, uh, bullfighting.

1382
01:24:07.879 --> 01:24:11.160
So yeah. Yeah, I, I am not a fan

1383
01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.390
of bullfighting. I mean, I, I just, I can't

1384
01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:16.660
see that. The justification for it, but I think

1385
01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:20.770
the overall tendency is to reduce the regions of

1386
01:24:20.770 --> 01:24:23.660
where that's done, uh, yeah, but at the same

1387
01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:29.620
time, uh, We have Millions of animals raised in

1388
01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:34.299
factory farms under really horrible conditions. So can you

1389
01:24:34.299 --> 01:24:36.419
say, oh, there's been progress in the treatment of

1390
01:24:36.419 --> 01:24:39.450
non-human animals? The answer is yes and no. It's

1391
01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:41.939
not just yes or, or no. And I think

1392
01:24:41.939 --> 01:24:43.500
this is true in many cases. So I think

1393
01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:46.770
that, uh, if you admit a plurality of values

1394
01:24:46.770 --> 01:24:49.540
and that social changes can have different effects for

1395
01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:54.629
different values, it's very hard to make. Uh Moral

1396
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:58.270
progress judgments that are sort of uh conclusory or

1397
01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:02.560
summing up uh judgments about net progress or not.

1398
01:25:03.069 --> 01:25:05.189
Uh, BUT I also think that you can make

1399
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:08.509
judgments about regression. I think that, you know, we

1400
01:25:08.509 --> 01:25:10.549
may have made progress in a certain area and

1401
01:25:10.549 --> 01:25:13.930
then we fall back in that particular area. And

1402
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:16.870
in, in the, our moral faith book and in

1403
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:19.669
this book, I, when I talk about regression, I

1404
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:23.899
typically think about cases where Uh, there's either a

1405
01:25:23.899 --> 01:25:29.069
reversion to harsher economic conditions like a world depression,

1406
01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:33.500
or there are, uh, demagogues who convince people that

1407
01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:37.140
there's some terrible threat from some other group like

1408
01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:39.660
immigrants. But I don't think those are the only

1409
01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:42.259
sources of regression because in the United States right

1410
01:25:42.259 --> 01:25:46.810
now, I think the major cause of regression is

1411
01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:53.200
backlash against moral progress. Mm, uh, things that you

1412
01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.200
and I would consider to be instances of moral

1413
01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.589
progress in the United States like civil rights for

1414
01:25:58.589 --> 01:26:03.520
African-Americans, more equal rights for women and gay people.

1415
01:26:04.859 --> 01:26:07.189
These are not viewed as good things by many

1416
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:10.990
people because they create losers. People lose status and

1417
01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:16.009
privilege when those forms of moral progress occur. And

1418
01:26:16.029 --> 01:26:18.229
in a revolution, you just take those people out

1419
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:21.589
and shoot them. You don't have. But in a

1420
01:26:21.589 --> 01:26:25.470
democracy, you can't do that. They're there. And they're

1421
01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:29.790
resentful and they're bitter because of what, what you

1422
01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:32.669
and I regard as moral progress has cost them.

1423
01:26:33.029 --> 01:26:35.490
Also globalization of the economy is a good example,

1424
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:39.370
and they are ripe for being recruited and mobilized

1425
01:26:40.029 --> 01:26:42.430
by somebody who'll come along and say, I feel

1426
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:46.649
your pain. I know that you've been mistreated. I

1427
01:26:46.649 --> 01:26:49.410
know that society is going in a direction that

1428
01:26:49.410 --> 01:26:53.750
you find disgusting that you can't stand. And in

1429
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:56.509
the United States now, there is this tremendous sort

1430
01:26:56.509 --> 01:27:01.029
of counter-revolution going on, or reaction, uh, whatever you

1431
01:27:01.029 --> 01:27:03.069
call it. And I think it has some very

1432
01:27:03.069 --> 01:27:07.790
regressive features. Um, SO, I think that a theory

1433
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:10.229
of moral progress has to include a theory of

1434
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:14.220
regression. And the theory of regression should give a

1435
01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:19.620
prominent role to backlash, that is to the, the

1436
01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:26.750
paradoxical fact that Moral progress often brings Factors that

1437
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:32.520
cause moral regression. I think that's has not been

1438
01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.020
sufficiently appreciated.

1439
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:41.069
So, but to to try to tie this to

1440
01:27:41.069 --> 01:27:44.270
one of the main topics we've explored today, that

1441
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:48.509
is the struggle between the hierarchs and the resisters.

1442
01:27:48.589 --> 01:27:54.270
Do you think that this struggle has produced progressive

1443
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.770
results?

1444
01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:57.299
Yeah, I think it has in some cases. I

1445
01:27:57.299 --> 01:28:01.060
mean, I think that the transition from thinking of

1446
01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:06.720
uh The ruler as somebody appointed by God, uh,

1447
01:28:06.979 --> 01:28:10.720
uh, who has absolute power over those rules to

1448
01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.720
the idea that government is a fiduciary agent acting

1449
01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:17.160
on behalf of the general welfare, I think that's

1450
01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:20.279
a tremendous change. I think the idea that the

1451
01:28:20.279 --> 01:28:22.439
law is not in the king's mouth, but that

1452
01:28:22.439 --> 01:28:26.200
the law applies equally to everybody is a, a

1453
01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:31.080
big advantage. Uh, I think that the idea of

1454
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:35.870
That your birth, who, who your parents are should

1455
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:40.750
not determine, uh, your status in society or your

1456
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:45.549
eligibility for certain, uh, positions, that is the, the

1457
01:28:45.549 --> 01:28:48.910
rejection of the idea of hereditary privilege, uh, or

1458
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:51.830
in the French Revolution, the slogan was career is

1459
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:55.390
open to talents, right? It was a fantastic change

1460
01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:59.689
because through, throughout all of history in most societies,

1461
01:29:00.419 --> 01:29:02.430
Who your parents were, the class you were born

1462
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:06.870
to determined almost everything about your opportunities. So, those

1463
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:09.189
are, and I think that the abolition of chattel

1464
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:11.669
slavery, now I, I say abolition of chattel slavery

1465
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:14.770
because there still is slavery. There's still some chattel

1466
01:29:14.770 --> 01:29:16.470
slavery and there are other forms of slavery that

1467
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:20.470
still exist. But people are working on it, you

1468
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:23.669
know, uh, it's interesting is the last time I

1469
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:29.569
consulted this, the, the leader of the contemporary anti-slavery.

1470
01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:33.299
Society is a direct descendant of one of the

1471
01:29:33.299 --> 01:29:36.729
leaders of the British abolitionist movement. Uh, uh, I

1472
01:29:36.729 --> 01:29:39.319
think he's a descendant of either Wilberforce or Clarkson.

1473
01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:43.100
So, there, there, there's been an intergenerational community that's

1474
01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:46.770
been committed to first wiping out slavery in its

1475
01:29:46.770 --> 01:29:51.500
most extreme form, Atlantic chattel slavery, and then attacking

1476
01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:55.229
other forms of servitude. Um, AND, uh, I, I

1477
01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:57.629
think there has been progress in that. I know

1478
01:29:57.629 --> 01:30:00.390
there's been progress in the rights and status of

1479
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:05.080
women. I mean, if you were You know, do

1480
01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.229
a thought if you, if you were going to

1481
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:08.890
be a woman. When would you like to be

1482
01:30:08.890 --> 01:30:11.290
born? I don't think it would be anytime earlier

1483
01:30:11.290 --> 01:30:14.830
than now, basically, I think, or, or the last

1484
01:30:14.839 --> 01:30:18.359
25 years, I mean. Uh, THE condition of women

1485
01:30:18.359 --> 01:30:21.000
in many places, not everywhere, many places.

1486
01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:24.399
Well, well, I, I mean, uh, sometimes you actually

1487
01:30:24.399 --> 01:30:30.100
hear some crazy things from conservatives where they say

1488
01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:33.609
that or claim that women back in the 1950s,

1489
01:30:33.839 --> 01:30:38.000
particularly in the US, were happier because they had

1490
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.640
kids and stayed home,

1491
01:30:39.839 --> 01:30:43.330
so. Yeah, I mean, that, well, that, it raises

1492
01:30:43.330 --> 01:30:46.259
an interesting question and that is, uh, what's the

1493
01:30:46.259 --> 01:30:50.270
connection between having rights and being happy? Uh, AND,

1494
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:53.069
and getting more rights doesn't necessarily make you happy,

1495
01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:59.490
right? Um, BUT at least having, uh, certain rights,

1496
01:30:59.870 --> 01:31:04.930
uh, gives you opportunities to pursue paths that you

1497
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:07.649
hope will make you happy. But yeah, I mean,

1498
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:10.629
there is this saying, you know, the truth will

1499
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:12.509
set you free, but it will also make you

1500
01:31:12.509 --> 01:31:17.729
miserable, right? And that, that's. Well, that's all too

1501
01:31:17.729 --> 01:31:22.500
often true. I mean, um, this actually raises a

1502
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:24.370
question I've been thinking about before, I just mentioned,

1503
01:31:24.379 --> 01:31:27.330
and that is, a lot of political philosophers think

1504
01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:32.339
that justice is an absolute value. That uh if

1505
01:31:32.339 --> 01:31:36.939
there's any uh conflict, it's improper to trade off

1506
01:31:36.939 --> 01:31:40.339
some increment of justice for any other value. I

1507
01:31:40.339 --> 01:31:42.549
don't think that's right. I think in some cases,

1508
01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:48.020
uh, Welfare matters more than justice. Uh, SUPPOSE you

1509
01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:50.140
have two job options, and one of them, you

1510
01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:55.520
got high pay, great benefits, opportunities for advancement, but

1511
01:31:55.779 --> 01:31:58.660
there's still a little residual discrimination against you as

1512
01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:02.379
a woman. It's not fully just. The other alternative

1513
01:32:02.379 --> 01:32:04.810
is a job where there's no discrimination against you

1514
01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:07.100
as a woman, the pay is lousy, the benefits

1515
01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:11.089
are lousy, there are no opportunities for advancement. WHICH

1516
01:32:11.089 --> 01:32:12.729
job would you choose? If you say I would

1517
01:32:12.729 --> 01:32:15.410
choose the one that's fully just, you're putting an

1518
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:19.240
absolute value on justice relative to everything else. I

1519
01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:23.589
think that's not. That's not reasonable. Uh, BUT once

1520
01:32:23.589 --> 01:32:26.709
you recognize there could be trade-offs between justice and

1521
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:30.870
welfare, the criticism of capitalism becomes much more complicated,

1522
01:32:30.959 --> 01:32:33.629
right? Because whatever else you can say about capitalism,

1523
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:36.890
it delivers higher levels of welfare for more people.

1524
01:32:38.029 --> 01:32:41.620
That has ever occurred in history. Now it does

1525
01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:45.799
that by a system of incentives that predictably generates

1526
01:32:45.799 --> 01:32:51.459
unjust inequalities. Right, right, so what do you want?

1527
01:32:51.569 --> 01:32:53.129
I mean, you could get, maybe you can get

1528
01:32:53.129 --> 01:32:56.250
rid of all those unjust inequalities, but you undercut

1529
01:32:56.250 --> 01:33:01.459
the incentive system that produces the general prosperity. I

1530
01:33:01.459 --> 01:33:04.500
think we've got excessive inequality in the US, right?

1531
01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:06.500
I don't think to have an acceptable level of

1532
01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:09.020
welfare in the US, Elon Musk has to have

1533
01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:14.740
$400 billion right? So there's welfare necessary equalities of

1534
01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:20.089
capitalism. There are surplus inequalities. And I think That

1535
01:33:20.089 --> 01:33:24.209
most existing capitalist countries have high levels of surplus

1536
01:33:24.209 --> 01:33:28.709
and equality, and for that reason, They're not acceptable,

1537
01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:31.009
even if you think that welfare could be traded

1538
01:33:31.009 --> 01:33:34.270
off against justice to some extent. Mhm.

1539
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:39.620
OK, so let me ask you then finally, um,

1540
01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:43.229
when it comes to this struggle between the hierarchs

1541
01:33:43.229 --> 01:33:47.589
and the resisters, do you think that an understanding

1542
01:33:47.589 --> 01:33:51.459
of it, uh, of uh how it has occurred

1543
01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:55.549
so far, can yield knowledge of how to curb

1544
01:33:55.549 --> 01:33:58.990
the tendency of hierarchs to abuse their power?

1545
01:34:00.089 --> 01:34:02.240
I think so, and I wanna revert back to

1546
01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:04.569
something you brought up, that is the epistemic dimension

1547
01:34:04.569 --> 01:34:07.089
of the struggle. I think that what we've learned

1548
01:34:07.089 --> 01:34:08.930
from looking at the history of the struggle is

1549
01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:12.490
that when the struggle produces improvements in the social

1550
01:34:12.490 --> 01:34:19.200
epistemic environment, It equips resistors with more resources for

1551
01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:22.720
making further improvements. So I think that's one of

1552
01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:26.359
the things that is important in thinking about how

1553
01:34:26.359 --> 01:34:29.379
we can restrain hierarchy. By the way, I think

1554
01:34:29.379 --> 01:34:33.520
that the object is not to abolish hierarchy. I

1555
01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:37.310
think the complex, large-scale societies need some kind of

1556
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:41.890
hierarchy. Uh, THE question is, can you, uh, have

1557
01:34:41.890 --> 01:34:45.529
hierarchies that are less prone to abuse rather than

1558
01:34:45.529 --> 01:34:48.770
more prone to abuse? Uh, uh, AND, and I

1559
01:34:48.770 --> 01:34:52.049
also think, this is really speculative, that in a

1560
01:34:52.049 --> 01:34:57.009
modern large-scale complex pluralistic society, you can't sustain a

1561
01:34:57.009 --> 01:35:01.479
hierarchy. Without a lot of coercion, unless there's an

1562
01:35:01.479 --> 01:35:07.779
ideology. That supports the hierarchy. So I'm not in

1563
01:35:07.779 --> 01:35:10.040
favor of either trying to get rid of ideologies

1564
01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:14.200
or hierarchies. Uh, I'm more concerned with how you

1565
01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:20.080
can identify and promulgate ideologies that are. Less destructive

1566
01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:23.279
than many are and how you can have hierarchies

1567
01:35:23.279 --> 01:35:28.479
that are uh less prone to abuse than the

1568
01:35:28.479 --> 01:35:32.330
ones that we've had in the past. Um, And

1569
01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:34.850
I think you can learn something from past experiences

1570
01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:37.729
about that. Uh, uh, uh, uh, GAINS in the

1571
01:35:37.729 --> 01:35:42.049
epistemic, the social epidemic environment where more people have

1572
01:35:42.049 --> 01:35:45.370
access to knowledge that's relevant to judging the behavior

1573
01:35:45.370 --> 01:35:49.390
of the hierarchs, right? And can communicate with other

1574
01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:53.310
people, their dissatisfaction with the hierarchy and can mobilize

1575
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:58.589
because of the information technologies. That's crucial. Anything that

1576
01:35:58.589 --> 01:36:01.250
can be done to improve that is likely to

1577
01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:03.830
uh give, you have to think about what are

1578
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:09.129
the resources of resistors for curbing the abuses hierarchy.

1579
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:12.430
And I think their epistemic resources are of crucial

1580
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:20.290
importance, education. Information technology access, uh, And also there

1581
01:36:20.290 --> 01:36:23.410
has to be a certain amount of transparency on

1582
01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:25.649
the part of the way the hierarchs operate. There

1583
01:36:25.649 --> 01:36:27.970
has to be information available about what the hell

1584
01:36:27.970 --> 01:36:30.810
they're doing. Uh, AND of course, it's in their

1585
01:36:30.810 --> 01:36:33.009
interest to, to not let us know what they're

1586
01:36:33.009 --> 01:36:37.490
doing. So there's a struggle for access to information

1587
01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:39.799
about what they're actually doing. Right.

1588
01:36:41.439 --> 01:36:44.859
So I have just one final question then, uh,

1589
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:47.240
and uh on the topic of hierarchy, and I

1590
01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:50.000
guess that it connects to some of what you

1591
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.140
just said there. Do you think that hierarchy is

1592
01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.240
unavoidable?

1593
01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:01.660
I think if you're gonna have a well-functioning large-scale,

1594
01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:07.040
complex society with a plurality of values, uh, I

1595
01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:08.799
think you have to have hierarchy of some kind.

1596
01:37:08.919 --> 01:37:11.759
I don't, and organization theorists say this. They say

1597
01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:15.439
for any large-scale organization, Whether it's a state or

1598
01:37:15.439 --> 01:37:19.549
a corporation. You need some structure of authority to

1599
01:37:19.549 --> 01:37:22.819
reduce transaction costs, to be able to come to

1600
01:37:22.819 --> 01:37:24.750
decisions about what to do rather than just sort

1601
01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:29.180
of endlessly debating about it, that there are efficiency

1602
01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:32.430
constraints that that push you in the direction of

1603
01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:37.509
having some kind of hierarchy. In large scale complex

1604
01:37:37.509 --> 01:37:41.729
organizations. I, I, I think that's That's right. Um,

1605
01:37:42.129 --> 01:37:44.569
SO it's not a question of, you know, finally

1606
01:37:44.569 --> 01:37:49.069
defeating a hierarchy. It's a matter of controlling hierarchies.

1607
01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:52.970
Uh, THAT'S the crucial question, uh, and, and what's

1608
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:56.250
the role of ideology in either controlling them or

1609
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:59.870
making them less. Subject to control.

1610
01:38:00.779 --> 01:38:05.870
Mhm. OK, great. So, the book is again, Ideology

1611
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:10.029
and Revolution, how the struggle Against domination Drives the

1612
01:38:10.029 --> 01:38:14.060
evolution of morality and the institutions. I'm, of course,

1613
01:38:14.189 --> 01:38:16.830
leaving a link with in the description of the

1614
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:20.250
interview. And Doctor Buchanan, thank you so much for

1615
01:38:20.250 --> 01:38:21.770
taking the time to come on the show again.

1616
01:38:21.850 --> 01:38:25.359
It's been a really fascinating conversation. Well,

1617
01:38:25.850 --> 01:38:28.049
thank you for the opportunity. I said this before

1618
01:38:28.049 --> 01:38:30.569
in a previous interview. You are by far the

1619
01:38:30.569 --> 01:38:32.810
best interviewer I've ever encountered. I've had a lot

1620
01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:35.089
of them, but you really read and understand the

1621
01:38:35.089 --> 01:38:37.089
work and you ask the best questions, and you

1622
01:38:37.089 --> 01:38:41.720
allow enough time. This is really important, uh. Yeah.

1623
01:38:41.850 --> 01:38:45.089
01 last thing. I want you to engineer a

1624
01:38:45.089 --> 01:38:47.089
trip to Portugal for me. I want, uh, I,

1625
01:38:47.209 --> 01:38:49.490
I, I've been to Portugal once. I really loved

1626
01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:52.229
it. I thought the people were incredibly generous and

1627
01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:56.169
beautiful country, and, uh, and sometime I wanna talk

1628
01:38:56.169 --> 01:38:59.529
to you about how, how little Portugal has maintained

1629
01:38:59.529 --> 01:39:04.649
its independence from Spain. Over the centuries, right? I

1630
01:39:04.649 --> 01:39:07.430
mean, when you look at the map, you'd say,

1631
01:39:08.359 --> 01:39:10.930
Why don't the Spanish control the whole thing? Right?

1632
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:13.419
Now, I know it has to do with alliances

1633
01:39:13.419 --> 01:39:15.129
to some extent, like with the British.

1634
01:39:15.979 --> 01:39:18.500
