00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.839
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.599
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:08.399
today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor Marina

4
00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:12.159
Garcia Granero. She's an assistant professor of moral philosophy

5
00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:15.779
at the University of Valencia. Last time we talked

6
00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:20.000
about some aspects of Nietzsche's philosophy like Zoun, the

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.540
Uberman race, biopolitics. Today, we're talking about some other

8
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.180
aspects of his philosophy like the genealogical method, the

9
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.220
death of God, nihilism, and some other related topics.

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.819
So, Marina, welcome back to the show, uh to

11
00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:36.799
the show. It's always a pleasure to have you

12
00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.810
everyone.

13
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.659
Thank you for having me. It's good to be

14
00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:39.380
back on the show.

15
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.569
So let's start with the genealogical method then. What

16
00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:46.599
are, what are the goals of it?

17
00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:51.139
So genealogy has become a prominent method in contemporary

18
00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:56.250
philosophy. It serves as a deconstructive or narrative approach

19
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.819
to explore the origins of beliefs, concepts, values, practices,

20
00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:05.809
for instance, the notions of truth, altruism, justice, and

21
00:01:05.809 --> 00:01:10.930
it has gained particular recognition as an anti-essentialist tool.

22
00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:15.760
It's especially useful for social and political critique, however,

23
00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:21.569
Nietzsche's approach to genealogy has deeper nuances and distinctive

24
00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:25.739
characteristics that make it unique. And differentiate it from,

25
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.730
let's say the popular understanding that we have now.

26
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.750
Evidently, Nietzsche did not coin the term genealogy. It

27
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.180
comes from the natural sciences. Think of the genealogical

28
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.230
tree or arrangement, but he did pioneer the genealogical

29
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.870
method as a philosophical tool. Genealogy as a philosophical

30
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.830
method clearly stated. So he presented it as a

31
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.849
richer and more nuanced uh method than the. Historical

32
00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:58.389
approaches from English genealogist, the English evolutionists, and it's

33
00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:01.629
actually quite funny because he always labels and calls

34
00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:04.389
his, he, he calls them the English even when

35
00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:06.550
they're not English like Paulre, he was German but

36
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.639
he called him English. So, and Nietzsche himself uh

37
00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.429
in Human to human, a book from the Mid

38
00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:18.289
period, uh, as it is well known. He was

39
00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.839
influenced by these authors and he undertook a history

40
00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.119
of the emergence of thought, it's long phrase, but.

41
00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:27.919
What he meant is that what I mean here

42
00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:32.440
is that he was deeply inspired by this evolutionary

43
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.470
framework and inquiry, but by the time he later

44
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.309
wrote uh on the genealogy of morals, his genealogy

45
00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:48.470
becomes a counterpoint to evolutionary histories, evolutionary genealogies, so.

46
00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:54.070
He shares with uh these thinkers, uh, he, he,

47
00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:59.679
he, he also rejects metaphysics, essentialism. He, he cares

48
00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:04.910
about uh unraveling the extra moral origins of morality

49
00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.720
to be, uh, and by these authors I'm referring

50
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.320
to Herbert Spencer, Alfred Spias, Jean Marie Guillo, and

51
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.960
I also already said Pare and Walter Budget. I

52
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.399
did mention him in our first interview because Uh,

53
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:23.449
he also, he became familiar with the notion of

54
00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.729
hut breeding with that author. So what I'm saying

55
00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:30.889
is that he becomes, uh, he's truly inspired by

56
00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.970
these authors, but then he emancipates himself from them.

57
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.529
He presents a different project. So in Nietzsche's framework,

58
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.169
genealogy, uh, has. 22 different goals that that are

59
00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.649
deeply connected and the two goals are necessary. It

60
00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:51.809
has two distinct steps. So the first step is

61
00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:55.320
shared, it is common with the English evolutionist. It's,

62
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.289
it's the, I already mentioned history of the genesis

63
00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:02.250
of thought and so Nietzsche wants to understand how

64
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.729
ideas and cultures are created and sustained. It's like

65
00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:11.289
the genealogical tree of Christian values, uh, European societies,

66
00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:16.250
etc. ETC. But the second more critical step is

67
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.010
original to Nietzsche, and he questions the value of

68
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.529
values, the value of these ideas, these practices, these

69
00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:28.739
institutions, and this second step is what distinguishes a

70
00:04:28.739 --> 00:04:33.369
genuine genealogy from a mere history of morality. Uh

71
00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:36.809
THIS second step is what makes a genealogy worthy

72
00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:41.790
of its name. So paradoxically, for Nietzsche, the English

73
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.950
genealogists do not deserve that name. So And uh

74
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.510
he, he acknowledges their contribution, for example, at the

75
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.019
beginning of the genealogy of morals in the preface,

76
00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:57.160
but then he tempers his initial praise with criticism

77
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.359
because their account lacks philosophical rigor. He, he denounces

78
00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:06.149
that these authors, the English genealogist, and mostly Herbert

79
00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:12.929
Spencer. Continue to affirm and legitimize the same crystal

80
00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:15.369
values, Christian values under a new guise, a new

81
00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:20.980
scientific guise, and so. Uh, INSTEAD of subjecting them

82
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.309
to uh critical scrutiny, instead of analyzing them, contesting

83
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:29.510
them, uh, they still legitimize them, for example, the,

84
00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:34.190
the utility of altruism from a revolutionary perspective. It's

85
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.109
the same value but through a new lens and

86
00:05:37.109 --> 00:05:42.500
so. Let's say that Nietzsche's genealogy has an evolutionary

87
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.820
inspiration, let's say or basis, but it introduces a

88
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.769
critical dimension in the second step, the second goal

89
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.269
that is particular to it. And so, uh, the

90
00:05:55.269 --> 00:06:00.609
history of thought by itself stops short of evaluating

91
00:06:00.609 --> 00:06:02.970
the value of values and that's where Nietzsche drew

92
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.440
the line. So in fact, he criticized, he wrote,

93
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.450
they still believe in values just like the Christian,

94
00:06:10.609 --> 00:06:15.329
they still have the same relation to values. So,

95
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.500
uh, instead, and I'm doing with this, Nietzsche, he

96
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.079
critically examines how values are transmitted and maintained across

97
00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:26.940
cultures and through power structures and whether it's worth

98
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.619
preserving them, for example, why is it that Christian.

99
00:06:30.725 --> 00:06:34.355
And values have become so successful and pervasive for

100
00:06:34.355 --> 00:06:38.515
centuries that for him is a crucial question for

101
00:06:38.515 --> 00:06:42.234
genealogy, not so much how did they arise, but

102
00:06:42.234 --> 00:06:44.915
why is it that still persists today and is

103
00:06:44.915 --> 00:06:45.795
it worth it?

104
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.070
And so how do these goals of the genealogical

105
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.660
method relate to nihilism?

106
00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:56.989
So as I was saying, uh, genealogy as a

107
00:06:56.989 --> 00:07:00.850
method builds on the philosophical ideas of Darwinism and

108
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.630
it pushes back against the idea that species are

109
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.149
eternal, for example, it assumes that humans are deeply

110
00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:12.869
connected to nature, it rejects explanation based on final

111
00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:18.320
causes, final purposes and genealogy, let's say that. Uh,

112
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.829
IT incorporates the philosophical consequences of Darwinism, that's what

113
00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:27.179
I want to say, and this also includes rejecting

114
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.109
the argument that God's existence could be proven by

115
00:07:31.109 --> 00:07:35.459
looking at the design of the world, so. When

116
00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:39.799
evolutionary thinking gained traction in the 19th century, it

117
00:07:39.799 --> 00:07:42.350
started to chip away at the authority of religion

118
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.320
and morality, and over time this led to their

119
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.869
decline and even self destruction and for this reason,

120
00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:56.000
genealogy ties to nihilism because it makes us question

121
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.100
our values and it redefines our relationship to morality

122
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:06.019
from transcendence to eminence. When values stop feeling absolute

123
00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:10.619
or unquestionable. They become things we can actually discuss

124
00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:13.910
and even change and by showing that our beliefs,

125
00:08:14.109 --> 00:08:18.109
our habits and values come from human to human

126
00:08:18.109 --> 00:08:22.589
origins, genealogy contributes to this loss of the sacred

127
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:26.750
or the divine and here's the twist. Socratic philosophy

128
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.440
and Christian morality with their focus on truthfulness and

129
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.190
the pursuit of truth, they planted the seed for

130
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.320
this own unraveling, this uh nihilism or More precisely

131
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.308
the event of the death of God because this

132
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.309
truthfulness, this will to truth gave us the drive

133
00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:51.520
for knowledge, the same drive that uh for example

134
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.510
with uh new evolutionary discoveries. Ended up undermining them,

135
00:08:56.669 --> 00:09:02.000
undermining uh the moral Christian hypothesis, creationism, etc. ETC.

136
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.700
And so in fact this is what Nietzsche meant

137
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.830
by the sentence God is death, the God is

138
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.510
death, and we have killed him. This is what

139
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.799
he truly adds to Hegel's previous declaration on the

140
00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:19.630
death of God, the ideals of good, truth and

141
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:25.070
beauty. That once served as our guiding principles are

142
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:29.830
now exposed as illusions. They're no longer able to

143
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:34.450
shield us from the deeper realization of nihilism so

144
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.460
ironically it's the same way to truth that led

145
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.349
to the collapse of these ideas and the profound

146
00:09:42.349 --> 00:09:46.150
existential shift that we're now facing. Christian religion, in

147
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:50.179
fact, would probably have experienced a different faith. If

148
00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:53.460
it hadn't promoted such an attachment to truth or

149
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.340
aesthetic values.

150
00:09:56.809 --> 00:09:59.849
And what is the death of God?

151
00:10:00.989 --> 00:10:04.059
Well, the death of God, the way I see

152
00:10:04.059 --> 00:10:08.179
it is best understood as a cultural event in

153
00:10:08.549 --> 00:10:12.270
beginning in late 19th century Europe, and I want

154
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.390
to stress this word event. To mean that is,

155
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:22.080
it is historically and uh locally uh situated because

156
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:28.030
there is uh A tendency to conflate to treat

157
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.280
nihilism in the death of God as synonymous, and

158
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.599
they're not. We could say that the death of

159
00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:37.309
God is an event while nihilism uh refers to

160
00:10:37.309 --> 00:10:41.039
many things. NIHILISM uh is part of a human

161
00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:46.000
condition refers also to. Type of ideas, etc. I'm

162
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.750
sure we will talk later about that, but so.

163
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.109
The thing about the death of God is that

164
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.479
it's not about whether you or I or anyone

165
00:10:55.479 --> 00:10:58.799
listening chooses to believe our God in God or

166
00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:03.390
not. It's not a question of personal faith or

167
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:08.559
theoretical atheism. Instead it reflects a deeper collective issue.

168
00:11:08.929 --> 00:11:13.849
It's the collapse of the principles that once gave

169
00:11:13.849 --> 00:11:16.609
a structure and meaning to life. It's the collapse

170
00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:21.250
of the foundations of our Christian societies. So the

171
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.969
fact is that the idea of God as the

172
00:11:24.969 --> 00:11:30.000
ultimate metaphysical and moral principle. No longer works as

173
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.559
a collective anchor for our politics, societies of values.

174
00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:39.799
Those values have lost their strength or credibility, or

175
00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:43.590
at least part of it. And so The death

176
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.510
of God as an event, it manifests as a

177
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:51.349
sense of aimlessness, a kind of cultural disorientation because

178
00:11:51.349 --> 00:11:55.489
those Christian values have lost their authority, their power

179
00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:01.979
to orient ourselves and our society, so. The metaphysical

180
00:12:01.979 --> 00:12:06.330
hypothesis of God no longer provides the same security

181
00:12:06.539 --> 00:12:10.359
or the same collective consolation. This idea of consolation

182
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.979
plays a major role in nihilism. So also interestingly.

183
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.780
The death of God doesn't happen because life is

184
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.679
falling apart. It's quite the opposite. It happens because

185
00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:27.400
things are going relatively well. We have major advances

186
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:33.679
in science, technology, social stability, even material prosperity. And

187
00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:37.489
Nietzsche notes this in the Lezerheide, which is his

188
00:12:37.489 --> 00:12:41.039
most extensive and systematic treatment of nihilism. It's a

189
00:12:41.369 --> 00:12:45.890
posthumous fragment from 1886 and it's famously known as

190
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.450
Lesser Haidee because of the location in Switzerland where

191
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.880
it was written. And so in that fragment nietzsche

192
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.640
states we can now bear a significant reduction in

193
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.909
the value of money because we enjoy relative prosperity

194
00:13:02.909 --> 00:13:07.119
and culture and so the very success of these

195
00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:10.229
advancements as I was saying at the beginning, science,

196
00:13:10.239 --> 00:13:16.380
etc. The economy that undermines the need for uh

197
00:13:16.809 --> 00:13:19.929
the sustain that God provided, the traditional foundations of

198
00:13:19.929 --> 00:13:20.599
our culture.

199
00:13:23.909 --> 00:13:27.070
Uh, AND how do people react to this experience

200
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.619
of the death of God?

201
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.900
Well, the death of God is a double-edged sword.

202
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.109
On the one hand, it can, it can be

203
00:13:34.109 --> 00:13:37.679
experienced as a liberation and for instance, in contemporary

204
00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:44.380
philosophy, the school has emphasized this result of liberation.

205
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.109
With the breakdown of transcendence and traditional values, there

206
00:13:49.109 --> 00:13:54.229
is obviously an opportunity for autonomy, to experiment, to

207
00:13:54.229 --> 00:13:58.840
develop our individuality. And so the death of God

208
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.830
as an event pushes us to recognize that meaning

209
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.599
isn't inherent in the world, meaning, meaning is a

210
00:14:06.599 --> 00:14:10.559
human creation that we introduce into the world. It's

211
00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:12.320
not something to be found, it's something to be

212
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.969
created and meaning is not something that corresponds with

213
00:14:17.969 --> 00:14:23.700
the external world like truth in the. Correspondence account.

214
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.429
But what I mean is that meaning is fictitious.

215
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:32.419
It, it opens up a space. For different narrations,

216
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.969
world musics, stories, and so. Before the death of

217
00:14:36.969 --> 00:14:40.770
God, there was no space for pluralism. So these

218
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:46.010
are positive outcomes from uh the event. Modern manifestations

219
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:50.559
of morality are more pluralistic, religion is less dogmatic,

220
00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:55.119
philosophy is more critical. And so after the death

221
00:14:55.119 --> 00:14:58.679
of God people gain power over how they interpret

222
00:14:58.679 --> 00:15:00.719
and live in the world, but on the other

223
00:15:00.719 --> 00:15:04.559
hand, the death of God is dangerous because it's

224
00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:09.200
not just Christian morality that's affected. Political institutions such

225
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.320
as democracy are also impacted because Christian values such

226
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.760
as altruism and love of thy neighbor were the

227
00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.609
ones legitimizing those institutions and so. When those values,

228
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:27.369
political values, social values, moral values lose their divine

229
00:15:27.369 --> 00:15:31.409
foundation, it might create a sense of endlessness that

230
00:15:31.409 --> 00:15:36.210
can affect not just individuals but entire communities. It's

231
00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:38.330
what I was saying before, the death of God

232
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.969
is not about atheism as a personal question, but

233
00:15:41.969 --> 00:15:45.239
the collective role played by the thought of God,

234
00:15:45.349 --> 00:15:51.049
the foundation of the God. So. Nihilism, and the

235
00:15:51.049 --> 00:15:53.159
event of the death of God, it's not just

236
00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:56.969
a personal crisis, it has profound implications for society

237
00:15:56.969 --> 00:16:00.359
as a whole. Now that our ideals have been

238
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:05.669
exposed as human constructs, human constructs. Without the divine

239
00:16:05.669 --> 00:16:09.010
quarantine, it, it, it forces us to confront the

240
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:14.679
fragility of meaning. In fact, Nietzsche uses very striking

241
00:16:14.679 --> 00:16:18.530
language to describe the death of God in pharmacological

242
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.979
terms, also in the lenser high death fragment. He

243
00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:26.140
explains that Christian morality acted as a kind of

244
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.169
pharmaon, a term that means both poison and remedy.

245
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:36.469
So Christian morality prevented humanity from falling into despair,

246
00:16:36.659 --> 00:16:42.700
into rejecting life life or succumbing into nihilism, so.

247
00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:46.700
Christian morality kept us going by giving us a

248
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.539
sense of purpose and meaning, but after the death

249
00:16:49.539 --> 00:16:53.419
of God, that antidote is gone and so the

250
00:16:53.419 --> 00:16:57.450
symptoms of despair can worsen. But at the same

251
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.630
time, as I already mentioned, there's potential for recovery

252
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.699
and emancipation. So The death of God is both

253
00:17:05.699 --> 00:17:09.108
a challenge and an opportunity, and I'm not saying

254
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:13.348
either or, it's both. There are valid reasons for

255
00:17:13.348 --> 00:17:18.130
each reaction. It's both a liberation and a catastrophic

256
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.040
event. It can lead us to despair, suffering, and

257
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.229
sense of loss. Uh, WE might feel a sense

258
00:17:24.229 --> 00:17:27.358
of dependency. We don't know where to turn for

259
00:17:27.358 --> 00:17:30.719
meaning, but on the other hand, it can spark

260
00:17:30.719 --> 00:17:35.040
critical discussions about morality, values, emotions, and this is

261
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.880
something Nietzsche had in mind with his idea of

262
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.810
the transvaluation of values. He aimed at the complete

263
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.400
re-evaluation of how we live.

264
00:17:45.239 --> 00:17:48.790
So, let's talk now a little bit about nihilism.

265
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.910
What is nihilism and since we've just talked about

266
00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.949
the death of God, is it synonymous with the

267
00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:58.150
death of God or are there any differences here?

268
00:17:59.319 --> 00:18:02.150
So the death of God, as I just said,

269
00:18:02.239 --> 00:18:05.719
is an event, but it's just part one part

270
00:18:05.719 --> 00:18:10.510
or stage of a much broader concept or history

271
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:14.400
of nihilism so nihilism isn't limited to the death

272
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:20.630
of God. It includes. Other phenomena previous stages before

273
00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.630
the event of the death of God, for example,

274
00:18:23.819 --> 00:18:28.719
Greek pessimism or uh Christian religion as a nihilistic

275
00:18:28.719 --> 00:18:33.040
idea. So it's crucial not to reduce nihilism to

276
00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.680
the death of God. It's just one stage in

277
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.760
the longer history of nihilism, for instance, and I

278
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.540
just uh read about this. In a chapter for

279
00:18:42.819 --> 00:18:47.020
a collecting volume on uh on mimeticos and on

280
00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.180
nihilism and mimetic studies, uh, Rene Giga, uh, the

281
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.170
founder of mimetic theory, Reneiga, his interpretation of nihilism

282
00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.939
is very problematic because he reduces it to the

283
00:18:58.939 --> 00:19:02.180
event of, of the death of God and this

284
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:07.729
oversimplifies niss deeper insights into our nihilistic condition, so.

285
00:19:08.729 --> 00:19:12.719
The fact is that uh Nietzsche actually presents, present

286
00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:15.959
the nihilism in different layers and we need to

287
00:19:15.959 --> 00:19:18.640
consider all of them to fully grasp what he

288
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.920
means by it. So one way to think about

289
00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.719
this comes from the work of a prominent niche

290
00:19:24.719 --> 00:19:28.189
scholar Paul van Toeren. And his book Nietzsche and

291
00:19:28.189 --> 00:19:33.069
European nihilism, and there he argues that Nietzsche conceptualizes

292
00:19:33.069 --> 00:19:37.260
nihilism in at least 3 stages, each marking a

293
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.640
distinct phase in the evolution of nihilistic thought. And

294
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.810
to really grab nihilism, we have to look at

295
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.969
all these stages and Van Tongeren, he actually speaks

296
00:19:47.969 --> 00:19:51.130
also about 1/4 stage, but let's stick to the

297
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.910
first three. So the thing is that The first

298
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:58.729
layer of nihilism. Uh, IS the absolute lack of

299
00:19:58.729 --> 00:20:01.969
meaning in the world. Uh, THE great example of

300
00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:06.520
this is Greek pessimism. In the 5th century before

301
00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.180
our era, so Nietzsche sees uh Greek culture, uh

302
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:15.680
Greek pessimism as the original form of nihilism, the

303
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.239
tragic realization that life is absurd and meaningless and

304
00:20:20.239 --> 00:20:24.579
that uh. We are, as we are as individuals

305
00:20:24.579 --> 00:20:27.119
or even as as a cultural societies, we are

306
00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:31.359
insignificant in the grand ever changing flow of of

307
00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:35.199
existence and so he looks at the pre-Platonic Greeks

308
00:20:35.199 --> 00:20:38.160
as a model for, for these states. It's a

309
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.290
fact that the Greeks were pessimist and in many

310
00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.349
ways the greatness came from this. They were able

311
00:20:45.349 --> 00:20:50.589
to. See and accept the fundamental truth of life's

312
00:20:50.589 --> 00:20:54.400
tragedy and they didn't look away from this harsh

313
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.640
reality they faced it head on and that was

314
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.520
part of what made their philosophy so profound. They

315
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.520
didn't run from the tragic nature of life they

316
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.119
embraced it. They didn't try to super code it

317
00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:10.719
with comforting ideas, as did Socrates later, as did

318
00:21:10.719 --> 00:21:14.989
Christian religion later, for example, and so. This is

319
00:21:14.989 --> 00:21:20.369
a first nihilism before any philosophical or religious system

320
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:27.209
uh uh created later. To console us, so the

321
00:21:27.209 --> 00:21:30.969
tragic Greeks remain open to suffering, to illness, and

322
00:21:30.969 --> 00:21:35.520
they unveil the abyss, the paradox. Many times, let's

323
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.979
think about this in contemporary terms or events. The,

324
00:21:39.989 --> 00:21:43.599
the events happening in our lives in the world,

325
00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.439
for example, a, a, a pandemic, a devastating fire

326
00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:49.810
or a flood, we just had a devastating flood

327
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.979
here in Valencia. They exceed our very limited human

328
00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:57.650
power and that is the tragic insight of life

329
00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:03.770
that Nietzsche vindicated. And so after let's say this

330
00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:07.150
stage of Greek culture we moved to what Nietzsche

331
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:11.619
calls nihilistic ideas and these are the ideas of

332
00:22:11.619 --> 00:22:14.780
European culture from Plato all the way to the

333
00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:19.300
19th century and uh these ideas were built to

334
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:24.199
protect. Uh, TO protect ourselves from the tragic insect

335
00:22:24.199 --> 00:22:27.369
of life, and that's why they are nihilistic because

336
00:22:27.369 --> 00:22:33.180
they negate. The fundamental tragic insight of life with

337
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:38.829
these ideals, Nietzsche. Let's say includes Christianity, democracy, scientific

338
00:22:38.829 --> 00:22:45.310
positivism, romanticism, his own romanticism in his youth. And

339
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:49.109
so this is where human when humanity starts to

340
00:22:49.109 --> 00:22:54.069
build and construct things like Gods, truth, being, ideas

341
00:22:54.069 --> 00:22:59.290
that Act as a defense mechanism against the tragic

342
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:02.489
experience of the first nihilism. They no longer, they

343
00:23:02.489 --> 00:23:05.729
can no longer endure that tragic experience. They have

344
00:23:05.729 --> 00:23:09.449
to conceal it with ideals such as God, truth,

345
00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:14.160
being, etc. BEAUTY as well and so. Uh, IN

346
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.239
fact, Nietzsche argues that Christianity succeeded. He, uh, it

347
00:23:18.239 --> 00:23:21.969
gained so much power because it, uh, it made

348
00:23:21.969 --> 00:23:25.949
sense of suffering and evil. It offered the idea

349
00:23:25.949 --> 00:23:30.060
of a perfect world and give and give meaning

350
00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:34.520
to death. But of course these ideas were nihilistic

351
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.930
and with the uh. Their own will to truth

352
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:43.050
ultimately reveal themselves as uh false and so. The

353
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:47.130
fact is is that uh these annihilistic ideals instead

354
00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:52.069
of accepting life as it was, they offered external

355
00:23:52.069 --> 00:23:56.839
idealized views that cover up reality and Nietzsche's alternative,

356
00:23:57.609 --> 00:24:01.010
however, was to embrace life as it is without

357
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:05.329
trying to impose some idealized meaning onto it, what

358
00:24:05.329 --> 00:24:09.209
he called the innocence of becoming. And so to

359
00:24:09.209 --> 00:24:14.569
conclude and to uh Let's say say it in

360
00:24:14.569 --> 00:24:18.040
very briefly, it has 3 key dimensions. First is

361
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.880
a human condition, as I was saying, the fundamental

362
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:26.520
meaninglessness and absurdity of life. Secondly, uh, nihilism refers

363
00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:30.160
to the nihilistic ideas that we create to shield

364
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.369
ourselves from that tragic truth. And third is the

365
00:24:34.369 --> 00:24:35.880
event of the death of the God that I

366
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.400
already spoke about when the ideals, when those ideals

367
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.319
and values lose their authority.

368
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:48.420
And people sometimes describe Nietzsche himself as being nihilistic.

369
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:52.979
Was Nietzsche nihilistic or guilty of nihilism in any

370
00:24:52.979 --> 00:24:53.189
way?

371
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:57.290
Well, that's a great question because it's uh it

372
00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.540
truly is something that we hear constantly. Wasn't it

373
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.449
nihilistic? Oh yes he was or he wasn't, he

374
00:25:02.449 --> 00:25:07.510
and to overcome nihilism, so. In my view, uh,

375
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.760
there's a key test to help answer this, and

376
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.449
it's the attempt of a self critique. It's a

377
00:25:14.449 --> 00:25:18.550
new preface that he wrote. Uh FOR the Birth

378
00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.880
of Tragedy, his first book, 13 years later, uh

379
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:29.040
after the original publication in 8687. So The attempted

380
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.560
a self critique is part of uh multiple new

381
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.880
prefaces that he wrote in those years to revisit

382
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.359
and republish his previous works and put them into

383
00:25:39.359 --> 00:25:45.099
perspective to let's say uh clarify where he, where

384
00:25:45.099 --> 00:25:50.680
he stands, what ideas remain and where his views

385
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.729
have changed. So these prefaces help us understand Nietzsche's

386
00:25:54.729 --> 00:25:58.359
journey. And show us how his thought evolved over

387
00:25:58.359 --> 00:26:03.160
time. And uh interestingly, that test uh is the

388
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.290
first time, the first uh Occurrence of the word

389
00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:11.400
nihilism, not the death of God, nihilism in a

390
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.329
published text, not the posthumous fragment, a published text

391
00:26:14.329 --> 00:26:17.030
by Nietzsche in life along with beyond good and

392
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:20.430
evil from the same year, so. Let's focus. The

393
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.260
thing is that in the attempt of the self

394
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:28.670
critique. He criticizes his past romantic quest to find

395
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.390
meaning, to find meaning as as if meaning was

396
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.670
something external like uh hiding behind the rock or

397
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.550
something like that, that his quest to find meaning

398
00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:43.219
in life through art, uh, mostly Wagnerian art obviously

399
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.510
because uh he realizes that he in his youth,

400
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:51.729
he was not strong enough to. Endure the original

401
00:26:51.729 --> 00:26:56.599
meaninglessness of life, the tragic insight of life. So

402
00:26:56.599 --> 00:26:58.880
in the original edition of The Birth of Tragedy,

403
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.329
he was actually nihilistic. He had nihilistic ideas. He

404
00:27:03.329 --> 00:27:08.160
was guilty of pursuing uh a nihilistic idea when

405
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.369
he looked to Schopenhauer's philosophy and Wagner's music as

406
00:27:12.369 --> 00:27:17.349
a way to regenerate German culture and so. In

407
00:27:17.349 --> 00:27:20.750
that new preface, he realizes that this very quest

408
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.780
for meaning, for, for meaning, this need for meaning

409
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:31.829
is the same sort of counseling idealism that he

410
00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:38.189
criticizes in Christianity in Socrateism, it, it, let's say.

411
00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:42.790
It plays the same credentive role and that's where

412
00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:45.680
he, he acknowledges that he made a mistake. He

413
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.520
realizes that the uh this need for meaning often

414
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.020
amounts to an aversion to life and that's why

415
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.319
it's nihilistic because it's an aversion to life. It's

416
00:27:55.319 --> 00:27:57.640
a rejection of the world as it is. It's

417
00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.160
an inability to cope with the world as it

418
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.839
is. And so there, very interesting, interestingly, he argues

419
00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:09.569
for a pessimism of strength. And so this is

420
00:28:09.569 --> 00:28:13.969
the strength to embrace life's absurdity and the inherent

421
00:28:13.969 --> 00:28:19.250
lack of meaning without turning to comforting metaphysical or

422
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:24.930
moral explanations, including Wagnerian art and so there we

423
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:30.089
see that what Nietzsche. It's actually suggesting what he's

424
00:28:30.089 --> 00:28:33.930
pointing at is to learn to live within nihilism,

425
00:28:34.229 --> 00:28:39.439
within that meaninglessness of life in a world without

426
00:28:39.439 --> 00:28:43.310
inherent meaning. In, in fact, uh, uh, prominent niche

427
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.390
scholar, Wernic Stemeyer, he, he always puts it in

428
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:51.989
those terms. He speaks about orienting ourselves within nihilisms.

429
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:56.400
He speaks about, uh, Nietzsche's philosophy of orientation, not

430
00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.239
overcoming but orientation, and so. To to sum it

431
00:29:00.239 --> 00:29:04.839
up, Nietzsche was nihilistic in the sense that he

432
00:29:04.839 --> 00:29:09.459
acknowledged the pessimistic conscience from the Greeks. He recognized

433
00:29:09.459 --> 00:29:13.030
that the world doesn't align with our moral values,

434
00:29:13.319 --> 00:29:16.680
that the truth, that the truth doesn't exist, for

435
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:22.660
instance, that's a pessimistic uh conscience, awareness, so. But

436
00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.099
he's not nihilistic in the same way that Christian

437
00:29:25.099 --> 00:29:30.420
ideals are or Wagner was romanticism was, so he

438
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:34.339
ultimately we need to live with this tragic insight

439
00:29:34.339 --> 00:29:37.449
not to try to cover it it up. So

440
00:29:37.449 --> 00:29:40.420
but instead of coming to terms with the pessimistic

441
00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:45.880
conscience, so a truthful person, a truthful person. We

442
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.560
should recognize that the world does not conform to

443
00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.430
our moral values and that is the nihilistic conscience

444
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:53.670
that Nietzsche vindicated.

445
00:29:55.439 --> 00:30:01.750
Mhm. So, I mean, uh, how does nihilism manifest

446
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.219
in contemporary society?

447
00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:10.739
Well, uh, It's important to understand. That while the

448
00:30:10.739 --> 00:30:14.979
death of God involves breaking free from traditional authorities.

449
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:22.000
Nietzsche warned that it often leads people. To seek

450
00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:27.439
new authorities, new sources of unconditional commands to provide

451
00:30:27.439 --> 00:30:29.969
us with new goals and direction, so this is

452
00:30:29.969 --> 00:30:33.640
like. A question like, uh, what happens after the

453
00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.750
death of God? Where are we at? So. And,

454
00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.989
and then again, we should. Going back to Nietzsche's

455
00:30:40.989 --> 00:30:44.709
text, even before the announced of the death of

456
00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:49.530
God in aphorism 125 of the gay Science, he

457
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:55.109
had already hinted at God's death in aphorism 108.

458
00:30:55.890 --> 00:31:00.280
There he warned that even after God's death, his

459
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:04.369
shadows, quote unquote shadows that's the word would remain

460
00:31:04.369 --> 00:31:07.089
he said God is dead, but as it is

461
00:31:07.089 --> 00:31:09.890
the way of being with men there will perhaps

462
00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:14.010
be caves for centuries in which the shadow will

463
00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.729
show itself and we still have to defeat that

464
00:31:16.729 --> 00:31:22.699
shadow and so. Uh, IF we pay attention to

465
00:31:22.699 --> 00:31:26.489
these terms, we see that these shadows and caves,

466
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.859
these are obviously metaphors reminding us of Plato, and

467
00:31:31.859 --> 00:31:35.500
they suggest that even after God is gone, people

468
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:39.819
continue to project their needs for authority. They, they

469
00:31:39.819 --> 00:31:44.890
are still, let's say externalizing the same function, uh,

470
00:31:45.339 --> 00:31:51.180
previously. Uh, PROVIDED by God. And so, Even after

471
00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.780
God is done, uh, people may say, we may

472
00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.939
say long for something or someone to provide them

473
00:31:57.939 --> 00:32:02.020
with meaning, purpose, because after all, the loss of

474
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.099
a clear stable reference point like God it can

475
00:32:06.099 --> 00:32:10.180
feel unbearable. Some people can't help but look for

476
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:15.869
new surrogates and replace God. With something that provides

477
00:32:15.869 --> 00:32:20.439
the same sense of security and so We might

478
00:32:20.439 --> 00:32:24.459
say that uh Europeans, people, etc. IT'S always awkward

479
00:32:24.459 --> 00:32:28.800
to use these terms we whatever so uh they

480
00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.989
remain attached to the idea of God even though

481
00:32:33.199 --> 00:32:35.400
they can no longer believe in it. That's the

482
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.930
issue it's like uh. A self-referential situation in which

483
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.180
there's a difficult, it's difficult to find an exit

484
00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:47.040
to it and so. Nietzsche's point is that after

485
00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.229
the death of God, the faith in truth doesn't

486
00:32:50.229 --> 00:32:53.560
necessarily disappear. We still have faith in the saving

487
00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.400
power of truth. We might cling to this idea

488
00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.170
that the truth can save us, even if it

489
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:04.260
comes from something other than God and so. We

490
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.439
might look for new systems, political, cultural, social that

491
00:33:08.439 --> 00:33:12.140
stepping to fulfill the same role and Nietzsche warned

492
00:33:12.459 --> 00:33:16.739
that idols such as the state, nationalism, race, the

493
00:33:16.739 --> 00:33:21.459
market, science, etc. AND so uh. They can act

494
00:33:21.459 --> 00:33:24.859
as shadows of God, they, because they offer omnipotent

495
00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:28.890
myths and take care of the responsibility, uh, uh,

496
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.380
they, they take the responsibility of individuals to make

497
00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:36.630
their own decisions, what he called self-legislation. And so

498
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.520
We can see for instance this dynamic playing in

499
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.479
various historical and political contexts. For instance, in their

500
00:33:44.479 --> 00:33:48.239
analysis of the Nazi myths, uh, well-known text titled

501
00:33:48.239 --> 00:33:51.890
The Nazi myths, uh, philosophers Philippe Laulabba and Jean

502
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:55.560
Lignani, they discussed how after the collapse of religious

503
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.439
transcendence. German culture found itself in kind of a

504
00:33:59.439 --> 00:34:02.689
double bind. On the one hand, it was losing,

505
00:34:02.839 --> 00:34:06.599
it was losing its religions and political structures, but

506
00:34:06.599 --> 00:34:09.719
on the other it was drawn to romanticism and

507
00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:14.949
nostalgia for medieval Christianity and. This creates a fertile

508
00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:18.310
ground for the rise of Nazism which promised the

509
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:22.070
restoration of the sacred to things like I already

510
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:25.899
said, nationalism raised the idea of a unified people

511
00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:30.429
and strong leader, etc. SO. In sociological terms we

512
00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:33.550
might say that this was in part a response

513
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:37.389
to the nihilistic emptiness that people felt in the

514
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:41.708
wake of uh religious control loss. So when we

515
00:34:41.708 --> 00:34:45.889
talk about nihilism today, we see its roost in

516
00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:50.310
its sorry it's roots in this persistent struggle for

517
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:53.949
meaning after the death of God and how new

518
00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:57.179
authorities often emerge to fill that void.

519
00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:03.679
Uh, AND this nihilism also manifest in science and

520
00:35:03.679 --> 00:35:05.469
technological advancement.

521
00:35:05.679 --> 00:35:09.790
Yeah, absolutely. In fact, these shadows can surface in

522
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:12.590
politics, as I already say, science and even technology,

523
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:18.689
and Nietzsche uh uh explicitly criticize how social Darwinism

524
00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.040
in the wake of the death of God position

525
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.669
itself. As a kind of new idol, he observed

526
00:35:25.669 --> 00:35:30.030
that Darwinism owes to Christianity the foolish confidence in

527
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:33.189
the course of things for the better, let's say

528
00:35:33.189 --> 00:35:36.889
it played the same functions in this sense, he.

529
00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:42.570
Criticized that social Darwinism, inherited the Christian notion of

530
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.770
progress but reframe it with uh within a scientific

531
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:49.290
framework, a new, a new quote, uh, a new

532
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:54.209
way to legitimize it and so. He challenged those

533
00:35:54.209 --> 00:36:00.050
authors, Herbert Spencer, Paul, etc. AND utilitarianism, John Stewart

534
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:04.250
me like, likewise, because he believed, obviously there are

535
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:09.449
multiple differences between these authors, but let's uh talkroomodo

536
00:36:09.449 --> 00:36:12.250
as a group. He believed that they as a

537
00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:18.840
group, social evolutionism and utilitarianism. They perpetuated the same

538
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.080
Christian values under a new guise, and the these

539
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.300
evolutionary ethics, according to him, to Nietzsche, they legitimized

540
00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:30.689
the same moral framework but presented them as uh

541
00:36:30.689 --> 00:36:35.580
rooted in evolutionary imperatives rather than the divine authority.

542
00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.050
We know that uh Spencer upheld altruism, the same

543
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:44.199
values steeps in Christian morality, but framing it as

544
00:36:44.199 --> 00:36:49.850
socially useful and so. Uh, THEY managed to maintain

545
00:36:50.669 --> 00:36:53.850
its essential function, function as a shadow of God,

546
00:36:54.139 --> 00:37:00.149
so. No, uh, supernatural authority was necessary. Instead, biological

547
00:37:00.149 --> 00:37:05.179
imperatives dictated the same moral values acting thus of

548
00:37:05.179 --> 00:37:08.489
the death of, sorry, as a shadow of God.

549
00:37:09.219 --> 00:37:13.899
And so Uh, they managed to save our faith

550
00:37:14.189 --> 00:37:18.030
in humanity, in, in human beings by prompting the

551
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:22.199
same values that echoed the same, uh, anthropological ideas

552
00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:27.929
of Christianity and so. Uh, IT, uh, ultimately, as

553
00:37:27.929 --> 00:37:31.919
I was saying, uh, at the beginning. When I

554
00:37:31.919 --> 00:37:38.000
compare their original genealogies versus Nietzsche's genealogy, the problem

555
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.760
is that these evolutionary thinkers. Didn't uh challenge Christian

556
00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.840
power structures like democracy or the church or morality

557
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.600
itself. It replaced one authority with another from the

558
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.409
divine to the biological and so. The problem is

559
00:37:56.409 --> 00:38:03.169
that science, while obviously invaluable, er. It cannot determine

560
00:38:03.169 --> 00:38:07.550
the value of values and that's uh a task

561
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.830
that lies beyond its domain and that's a key

562
00:38:12.209 --> 00:38:18.739
idea. Of one of Nietzsche's fragments titled Anti-Darwin. So

563
00:38:18.739 --> 00:38:24.459
Nietzsche criticized Darwinian morality for essentially really minimizing those

564
00:38:24.459 --> 00:38:33.040
values and uh knowing, knowing that. The uh science.

565
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.379
Uh, THERE'S still faith in the saving power of

566
00:38:36.379 --> 00:38:40.860
truth and, and there's still, uh, an eschatological vision

567
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.320
of progress in science. And so that's also one

568
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.840
of the main topics in the attempted self critique.

569
00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:50.540
He questioned whether this excessive faith in science was

570
00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:55.419
simply a defense mechanism against pessimism because it's evading

571
00:38:55.419 --> 00:38:59.510
the truth of life, it's tragic insight. In, in,

572
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:06.429
there's a misplaced optimism perpetuating false promises. So Nietzsche's

573
00:39:06.429 --> 00:39:10.270
thought challenges us to go beyond merely studying his

574
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:14.909
philosophy and instead, uh, it pushes us to adopt

575
00:39:14.909 --> 00:39:18.870
his genealogical perspective and if we look at at

576
00:39:18.879 --> 00:39:21.830
at today's world, let's say today's current movements, philosophical

577
00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:27.389
movements, scientific movements, transhumanism represents an interesting case to

578
00:39:27.389 --> 00:39:31.229
apply this nietzsche perspective. And as discussed in our

579
00:39:31.229 --> 00:39:35.189
previous interview, transhumanism, we know is a philosophical and

580
00:39:35.189 --> 00:39:39.429
intellectual movement advocating for the use of advanced technologies

581
00:39:39.429 --> 00:39:47.000
to enhance. Our physical, cognitive, psychological capacities and For

582
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.439
example, to overcome our limitations, disease, aging, and even

583
00:39:51.439 --> 00:39:56.590
death. And so at the core transhumanism envisions technology

584
00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:00.840
as a means to transcend our biological constraints and

585
00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:06.320
redefine, let's say the essence of humanity, but. If

586
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.399
we evaluate transhumanism from a niche lens, the uh

587
00:40:10.399 --> 00:40:14.320
if we if we undertake that, that task, we

588
00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.320
might raise important questions. For example, what moral framework

589
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.399
does it aim to establish? What are the values

590
00:40:21.399 --> 00:40:24.300
that will dominate in such a, in a world

591
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:31.590
shaped by those principles and If we connect Nihilism

592
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.889
with uh transhumanist technologies. We might see that transhumanism

593
00:40:38.889 --> 00:40:42.030
fails to grapple with the tragic insight of life

594
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:45.909
from the ancient Greeks. It intends to view the

595
00:40:45.909 --> 00:40:50.070
human cognition negatively through the lens of this important

596
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:54.100
concept of biological constraints. And so we already spoke

597
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.300
in our previous interview about Sean Soner, an advocate

598
00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.979
for so-called Nietzsche Transhumanism. He attempts to reframe transhumanism

599
00:41:01.979 --> 00:41:05.530
as a life affirming project, a life aligned with

600
00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:11.199
Nietzsche's values. And with Nietzsche's vision of self-overcoming, self-transcendence.

601
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:17.050
However, many Nietzsche scholars criticize that transhumanism can perpetuate

602
00:41:17.649 --> 00:41:23.169
aesthetic ideals or nihilistic tendencies, and this highlights the

603
00:41:23.169 --> 00:41:27.860
need for a deeper exploration. And, and not to

604
00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.500
replicate the shadows of God or not to fall

605
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:36.929
into nihilism. And so we must ask whether transhumanism

606
00:41:36.929 --> 00:41:43.080
carries forward nihilistic structures of religions without God, worship

607
00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.969
without divinity, for instance, and whether this promise for

608
00:41:46.969 --> 00:41:50.969
a better life functions as a new shadow of

609
00:41:50.969 --> 00:41:54.489
God. The way I see it, uh, Nietzsche will

610
00:41:54.489 --> 00:42:00.449
criticize this ingrained habit of seeking meaning from an

611
00:42:00.449 --> 00:42:06.459
external source. And that persist and undermines our true

612
00:42:06.459 --> 00:42:13.110
power for self-legislation that And so, uh, so-called niche

613
00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:17.699
transhumanism and transhumanism in general because, uh, the mainstream

614
00:42:18.159 --> 00:42:22.429
uh current in transhumanism doesn't at all uh connect

615
00:42:22.429 --> 00:42:26.530
with ietzsche, like for instance. Uh, Nick Bostrom, he,

616
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:29.750
he, he rejects Nietzsche. He's, uh, instead utilitarian, but

617
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:35.850
the thing is transhumanism broadly understood should maybe. Ensure

618
00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.350
that technology does not replace God's role in shaping

619
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:40.179
human values.

620
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:47.489
So one last question then, can nihilism be overcome?

621
00:42:48.459 --> 00:42:51.780
Well, that's a perfect question to conclude and very

622
00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:57.429
timely because In contemporary discussions of Nietzsche, especially in

623
00:42:57.429 --> 00:43:01.510
the Anglophone world, it's become quite common to talk

624
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:07.709
about overcoming nihilism. However, uh, this idea wasn't introduced

625
00:43:07.709 --> 00:43:12.949
by Nietzsche but later by Heidegger, and Heidegger's understanding

626
00:43:12.949 --> 00:43:20.219
of nihilism differs significantly from Nietzsche's nihilism. And The

627
00:43:20.219 --> 00:43:24.020
scholarly editions of Nietzsche's works and particularly the posthumous

628
00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:28.739
fragments. WHICH are central to the topic of nihilism

629
00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:34.229
because the published text. On nihilism are very, very

630
00:43:34.229 --> 00:43:40.080
few. Uh, THESE editions have undergone substantial revisions and

631
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.040
advancements since Heidegger's time, and by this I mean

632
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:50.379
that. While Heidegger's interpretation remains influential, it should be

633
00:43:50.379 --> 00:43:55.260
approached with caution because it reflects his own philosophical

634
00:43:55.260 --> 00:44:00.020
ideas rather than a direct representation of Nietzsche's views

635
00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:04.459
given obviously the limited uh resources available to him

636
00:44:04.699 --> 00:44:08.959
when it comes to Nietzsche's corpus. So, Now entering

637
00:44:08.959 --> 00:44:12.479
into Nietzsche, it's important to clarify that Nietzsche never

638
00:44:12.479 --> 00:44:19.719
explicitly speaks of overcoming nihilism. Instead, he speaks a

639
00:44:19.719 --> 00:44:23.959
few times of quote unquote the self overcoming of

640
00:44:23.959 --> 00:44:28.320
nihilism and even then this idea only appears in

641
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.709
three unpublished notes and these notes notes are very

642
00:44:32.709 --> 00:44:39.080
cryptic, under underdeveloped. They are. Essentially brief headings for

643
00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:43.120
potential future writings like, OK, a chapter on the

644
00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:48.719
self overcoming on nihilism and even then critically if

645
00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:53.479
we think about it, the idea of uh nihilism

646
00:44:53.479 --> 00:44:58.239
self overcoming itself is very different from the idea

647
00:44:58.239 --> 00:45:02.699
of. Uh, A person, someone, let's say actively overcoming

648
00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:06.020
nihilism, let's say the structure is different because by

649
00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:10.419
the self overcoming of nihilism, Nietzsche would might have

650
00:45:10.419 --> 00:45:15.659
been thinking about. The fact that er Christian ni

651
00:45:15.659 --> 00:45:22.040
nihilistic ideas. HAD their own corruption ingrained in them

652
00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:25.840
because of the will to truth. OK. So, can

653
00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:29.280
nihilism be overcome? I believe that the answer depends

654
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.399
on the type of nihilism that we're talking about,

655
00:45:32.479 --> 00:45:37.310
let's say the layer or the states. So nihilistic

656
00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:40.350
ideals can indeed be overcome. In fact, as I've

657
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.510
just said, they are destined to be, uh, Christian

658
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:47.189
ideas, let's say, uh, our will to truth, etc.

659
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:51.270
OUR attachment to truth, uh, they compel us to

660
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:57.729
critically examine and dismantle contingent constructs of aesthetic ideas

661
00:45:57.729 --> 00:46:01.979
and face us with the original nihilism of pessimism

662
00:46:02.189 --> 00:46:05.260
and so. If we move forward to the next

663
00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.860
stage, let's say the death of God and the

664
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.250
shadows of God, our dependence on external authorities and

665
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:16.020
the shadows of God, uh, and that can also

666
00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:19.899
be overcome. However, if we go back to the

667
00:46:19.899 --> 00:46:24.060
original foundation, the original layer of nihilism, nihilism as

668
00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:29.189
a human condition. The deeper existential pessimism, the recognition

669
00:46:29.189 --> 00:46:34.110
of life's tragic nature, and the fundamental meaninglessness, that's

670
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:38.169
something that cannot be overcome. In fact, The very

671
00:46:38.169 --> 00:46:42.520
desire to overcome this kind of original nihilism is

672
00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:46.840
in itself problematic. As I've said, uh, Nietzsche warns

673
00:46:47.129 --> 00:46:52.040
that attempting to erase or escape this inherent absurdity

674
00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:57.620
and randomness of existence. Often leads to heteronymous relationships.

675
00:46:58.449 --> 00:47:03.330
For instance, uh, individuals can become instrumentalized in the

676
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:08.050
church, for instance, in political institutions, in fascism, etc.

677
00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:12.770
IN the service of fanatism or uh dogmatic projects

678
00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:18.060
and so. Even if Nietzsche does not speak of,

679
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:24.610
as I said again, overcoming nihilism. Uh In the

680
00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:27.649
well known lets and hier fragment he does present

681
00:47:27.649 --> 00:47:31.560
a situation that in practical terms I think could

682
00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.489
amount to it or at least come close. He

683
00:47:34.489 --> 00:47:37.929
argues that human power has grown to such an

684
00:47:37.929 --> 00:47:41.929
extent that we should no longer need external consolation

685
00:47:41.929 --> 00:47:47.649
to ease our despair that given our increasing control.

686
00:47:48.409 --> 00:47:51.689
Over nature, for instance, we might put this, let's

687
00:47:51.689 --> 00:47:54.919
say into question mark with all the climate disaster,

688
00:47:54.939 --> 00:47:58.330
but our increasing control over nature thanks to technology,

689
00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:01.610
for instance, uh, we should be able to live

690
00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:07.570
with a diminished sense of value of uh. Of

691
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:10.649
human existence, for example, we should be able to

692
00:48:10.649 --> 00:48:14.929
coexist in a society without relying on the theological

693
00:48:14.929 --> 00:48:18.149
concept of human dignity, for instance, the idea that

694
00:48:18.149 --> 00:48:20.669
humans are made in the image of God and

695
00:48:20.669 --> 00:48:23.489
thus possess intrinsic value due to a connection to

696
00:48:23.489 --> 00:48:28.969
the divine. We could find other immanent values. We

697
00:48:28.969 --> 00:48:31.989
could ground them in in other perspectives to fulfill

698
00:48:31.989 --> 00:48:35.840
that role of the unconditional and not because it's

699
00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.550
true or false because that that doesn't matter. Nietzche,

700
00:48:38.639 --> 00:48:40.429
as we know in beyond good and evil section

701
00:48:40.429 --> 00:48:43.879
4, he says whether a judgment is, is, is

702
00:48:43.879 --> 00:48:46.909
false, that's completely out of question. It doesn't matter.

703
00:48:47.159 --> 00:48:52.120
The point is to assess. What role that judgment

704
00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:56.199
er plays, whether it promotes life, whether it serves

705
00:48:56.199 --> 00:49:01.699
our our development, whether it uh promotes life and

706
00:49:01.699 --> 00:49:04.560
even leads to its selection and, and then that's

707
00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.149
he uses yum or breeding so let's say that.

708
00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:13.110
Uh, ONCE we move beyond this framework of, of,

709
00:49:13.439 --> 00:49:17.199
let's say, uh, uh, through as a correspondence, the

710
00:49:17.199 --> 00:49:21.560
foundation of the divine, etc. ETC. We might find

711
00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.949
alternative ways to establish that social order without depending

712
00:49:25.949 --> 00:49:30.209
on religious or metaphysical foundations. So we could offer

713
00:49:30.209 --> 00:49:32.729
alternative foundations to it and in this sense, and

714
00:49:32.729 --> 00:49:37.020
I will end with this. He distinguishes between the

715
00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:40.139
weak and the strong in this context again in

716
00:49:40.139 --> 00:49:44.889
the Lenzerheide fragment by weak, uh, he means, uh

717
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:49.500
those uh people who still seek re replacements for

718
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.620
the death god and they, they still seek a

719
00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:56.780
new source of absolute meaning or redemption and instead

720
00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.540
the strong, uh, on the other hand. Are those

721
00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:04.739
who can endure life's absurdity without documents, and those

722
00:50:04.739 --> 00:50:09.770
that affirm the absolute the meaninglessness of the world

723
00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:14.739
and so seeing that meaninglessness not as a problem

724
00:50:14.739 --> 00:50:18.199
to solve. But uh even uh as uh a

725
00:50:18.199 --> 00:50:20.280
positive aspect of life, as I was saying, it

726
00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:24.419
opens this up, it opens up a space for

727
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.679
pluralism, etc. ETC. And in fact, for Nietzsche, our

728
00:50:29.679 --> 00:50:34.479
ability to transcend this absurdity without erasing it. Is

729
00:50:34.479 --> 00:50:38.699
what defines our humanity. The original lack of meaning,

730
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.840
it will come out forever because nihilistic ideas will

731
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.629
fall one after the other and so the original

732
00:50:45.629 --> 00:50:50.000
lack of meaning will constantly reappear and what defines

733
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.120
our essentially human experience is to try to endure

734
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.969
it and make sense of it. It's not actually

735
00:50:55.969 --> 00:51:00.889
a question of overcoming nihilism but coming to terms

736
00:51:00.889 --> 00:51:04.030
with it, not how to overcome, but how do

737
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:07.250
we respond to it. It's not, it's the fact

738
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:13.179
that Western culture traditionally shaped by Christian values. Could

739
00:51:13.179 --> 00:51:17.169
take Nietzsche's advice to cultivate the pessimism of strength

740
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:21.250
and this means, uh, this means learning to live

741
00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:25.330
as I was saying previously within nihilism to uh

742
00:51:25.739 --> 00:51:28.939
come to terms with life's tragic vision instead of

743
00:51:28.939 --> 00:51:33.899
seeking redemption or construct a new all-encompassing ideology and

744
00:51:33.899 --> 00:51:41.699
so. It's about uh experiencing life's uncertainty and uh

745
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.810
and embracing the lack of ultimate meaning with, with

746
00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:50.010
the increasing power that we hold over ourselves and

747
00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:53.399
the world, we no longer need to depend as

748
00:51:53.399 --> 00:51:57.840
heavily on moral, religious or philosophical constructs for comfort,

749
00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:03.820
comfort. Today, Our challenge is to accept life's randomness

750
00:52:04.389 --> 00:52:06.669
while finding ways to affirm and make sense of

751
00:52:06.669 --> 00:52:10.270
it without denying the tragic aspects.

752
00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:15.199
Great. So, Marin, uh, just before we go, would

753
