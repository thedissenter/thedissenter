00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.400
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.360
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.560
today I'm joined by Doctor Willem Frankenhaus. He is

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.500
an associate professor of evolutionary psychobiology at the University

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.159
of Amsterdam and a senior researcher at the Max

6
00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.840
Planck Institute for the Study of Crime Security and

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.479
Law. And today we're going to talk about uh

8
00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:30.889
harsh and unpredictable environments and how people develop in

9
00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:34.810
there. So, Doctor Frankenhaus, welcome to the show. It's

10
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.360
a huge pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:38.330
Thank you for reminding me.

12
00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:46.810
So what characterizes harsh and unpredictable environments? What counts

13
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.759
as such?

14
00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:52.930
Yeah, that's a great place to start. So, um,

15
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.340
as with many concepts in the field, there are

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.970
different definitions out there, but the most widely used

17
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.300
one, especially in the human field, um, is to

18
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.239
define harshness as age-specific rates of morbidity and mortality.

19
00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:13.739
So like morbidity could be damage to the body,

20
00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:18.410
for example, and mortality speaks for itself, um. And

21
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.559
then unpredictability is sometimes defined as, you know, stochastic

22
00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:30.290
variation uh through space or time in these age-specific

23
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.879
rates of morbidity and mortality. Now, In the human

24
00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:39.709
field, uh, when people study harsh and unpredictable environments,

25
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.839
they actually often do not directly measure morbidity or

26
00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:48.449
mortality, and so they are not directly measuring. You

27
00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:51.370
know, the concepts that they are working with, but

28
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.809
they are using proxies, so things that tend to

29
00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:59.529
be associated in most populations, uh, with morbidity and

30
00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:05.129
mortality. So for example, um, exposures to violence or

31
00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:06.730
low levels of resources.

32
00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:11.038
Right. Uh, I mean, just before we get into

33
00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:15.229
how people developing these kinds of environments and perhaps

34
00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:19.639
the kinds of a psychological abilities that they develop

35
00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:24.699
their. Is there an expected human childhood, uh, a

36
00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:28.220
typical way that children develop and I mean, if

37
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.380
so, what would it be and what kinds of

38
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.660
implications would it have for how we understand and

39
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.850
study childhood development?

40
00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:40.699
Yeah, that's a great question that really goes to

41
00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.139
the core of, of many things, uh, I'm, I'm

42
00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.000
working on. And, um, you know, for many fields

43
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.779
in, in, in psychology and maybe even social science

44
00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:55.119
more generally, certainly also anthropology, for example, um. It's

45
00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:58.869
an important question what the types of experiences were

46
00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:02.110
that human children would have experienced over the course

47
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.600
of our species evolution, and of course, you know,

48
00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:08.559
there are some experiences that might have been universal,

49
00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:11.550
but then there will also have been variation across

50
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.160
time and across populations in the types of experiences

51
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.990
children would have had, and Both of these things

52
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.669
matter because they can provide insight into the kinds

53
00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.710
of developmental mechanisms that the human species has evolved

54
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.470
that all human children uh come equipped with, uh,

55
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.729
in order to learn about their environment and development

56
00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:39.479
mentally adapt to their environment. And so the term

57
00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.949
expected childhood is, is actually a term that uh

58
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.309
in sort of the evolutionary psychology field, uh, is

59
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:50.350
not often used, but in the clinical psychology literature,

60
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:54.789
it is often used and there people are interested

61
00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:57.699
in this notion because there is a You know,

62
00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.059
a theory in that field, and, and, and I

63
00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:03.059
will also express some skepticism towards that theory in

64
00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:05.619
a moment. There's a theory in that field that

65
00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:12.210
says that when children experience negative events that fall

66
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.529
outside of the species typical range. They are more

67
00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:22.899
likely to develop uh psychopathology. And so, um, an

68
00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:25.940
example that, that's often discussed in this context are

69
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.779
children growing up in, in, in harsh orphanage situations,

70
00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:34.220
OK, where they have very restricted movement and very

71
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.579
regimented care that is not very responsive to their

72
00:04:37.579 --> 00:04:40.779
needs in some of these orphanages, of course, there's

73
00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.630
also a lot of variation in, in, in orphanages,

74
00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:47.600
um. And so there I think, you know, most

75
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.760
or all people would agree that that's not the

76
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.480
kind of context in which, uh, you know, the

77
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.760
children would have encountered across human evolution. But then

78
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.480
there are other contexts where um it's really an

79
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.320
empirical question, uh what, you know, whether or not

80
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.119
children would have experienced this type of contexts and,

81
00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:09.029
and so in the clinical field. Um, YOU know,

82
00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:13.070
when children are exposed, for example, to, um, you

83
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.540
know, to, to violence, um, or, or, you know,

84
00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:21.649
uh, harsh parenting. You know, let me just say

85
00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:25.489
upfront, like, of course, that's highly undesirable. It's not

86
00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:28.170
desirable that children are exposed to violence or, or

87
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.480
to harsh parenting, but When they do, to what

88
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.839
extent will children be able to develop kind of

89
00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:38.959
strategies and skills for navigating that difficult context? OK.

90
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And so if you think these types of experiences

91
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.040
are very, you know, would have pretty much rarely

92
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.200
or never occurred over the course of human evolution,

93
00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:49.880
then you might think that children would not have

94
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.079
many tools in their tool kits to be able

95
00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:54.600
to develop strategies and skills for dealing with them.

96
00:05:55.049 --> 00:05:57.250
But if these kinds of contexts would have occurred

97
00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.899
over the course of human human evolution, not always,

98
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.019
but you know, often enough to exert selection pressures

99
00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:07.809
on the developmental mechanisms of children, then you would

100
00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:10.010
be able to just, you know, you would expect

101
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.410
such strategies and skills. And if that's the case,

102
00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:15.579
it's interesting to then study what those strategies and

103
00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:18.989
skills might be, how children use them. You know

104
00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:22.190
how these strategies and skills might interfere with with

105
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.750
other contexts that are maybe safe and supportive, you

106
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.029
know, how to leverage these skills in ways that

107
00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.059
benefit them, but maybe we can get there later.

108
00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:35.429
But it's important for, for clinical psychology when they

109
00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:37.859
are starting to invoke this notion of the expected

110
00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:42.359
childhood. To not rely on an intuitive notion of

111
00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:44.739
what the expected childhood might have been like, but

112
00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:49.450
to really leverage, you know, many decades of data

113
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.890
collection that other fields in this area have done.

114
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:59.179
So, so anthropology, primatology, bioarchaeology, um, human history, and

115
00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:01.890
so I see the expected childhood really as a

116
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.410
concept where there is a lot of scope for

117
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.339
interdisciplinary synergy.

118
00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:12.649
Mhm. Yes, we'll certainly get into at least some

119
00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:16.190
of those topics later on in our conversation. Uh,

120
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.489
LET me ask you now, what do we know

121
00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:25.160
about how repeated or chronic childhood adversity shaped social

122
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.049
and cognitive abilities?

123
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:34.690
Yeah. So over the past decades, um, the, the,

124
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.609
the effects of, of, of, of adversity, by which

125
00:07:38.609 --> 00:07:42.290
I mean prolonged exposure to, to intense stress. So

126
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.329
for example, growing up in a violent household or

127
00:07:45.329 --> 00:07:49.170
neighborhood or, you know, being frequently exposed to low

128
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.130
levels of resources, you know, struggling to make your

129
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.829
ends meet, um. The, the effects of, you know,

130
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.730
of this adversity, um. Uh, HAS been studied mainly

131
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.640
from the perspective of how they create, you know,

132
00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:07.899
struggles for, for, for people, uh, and how these

133
00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:13.100
struggles can lead to, um, You know, lowered functioning

134
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.250
in some domains of life. And, and so decades

135
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:21.119
of research suggests that people are exposed to adversity,

136
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.850
uh, you know, on average, there will be large

137
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.140
individual differences, but on average, you know, tend to

138
00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:31.529
score lower on certain cognitive tests, including some of

139
00:08:31.529 --> 00:08:35.289
the tests related to school performance and the inference

140
00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.729
that people then tend to make from from this

141
00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:41.159
deficit perspective, which I will also, uh, you know,

142
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.479
critique a little bit in a moment. Is that

143
00:08:44.479 --> 00:08:48.010
um exposures to adversity kind of impair brain structure

144
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:53.400
and function in ways that lower cognitive performance. OK.

145
00:08:53.719 --> 00:08:56.520
And so, so the focus has been on how

146
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:02.950
adversity impairs. You know, social and cognitive development, um,

147
00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.549
and so there are countless articles in many journals,

148
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.710
um, you know, highlighting for a particular population exposed

149
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.750
to a particular adversity performance on a certain kind

150
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.380
of cognitive test is lowered. Now, I think this

151
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.710
body of work is really important. But I also

152
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.869
don't think it's the whole story and so my

153
00:09:25.869 --> 00:09:29.830
goal is not to completely try to um you

154
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.979
know, critique that whole body of work and say,

155
00:09:32.109 --> 00:09:34.640
you know, there's there's nothing in there. I do

156
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.700
think these impairment processes can in some cases operate.

157
00:09:39.229 --> 00:09:42.750
Uh, BUT I think in some cases when people

158
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.349
think they are documenting an impairment, they might actually

159
00:09:45.349 --> 00:09:48.349
not be documenting an impairment, but a strategy that

160
00:09:48.349 --> 00:09:51.469
people use in a harsh and unpredictable environment, so

161
00:09:51.469 --> 00:09:54.190
really it would be an adaptive response rather than

162
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.190
an impairment. And I think there are also cases

163
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.859
where people in harsh and unpredictable environments actually develop

164
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.950
skills, um, that are not documented by some of

165
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.710
the, the tests that are typically used. So, um,

166
00:10:08.059 --> 00:10:10.880
I think it's an empirical question to which extent,

167
00:10:11.169 --> 00:10:13.969
you know, in, in any particular case, impairment processes

168
00:10:13.969 --> 00:10:18.770
are operating and developmental adaptation processes are operating, and

169
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.729
I think the assumption has been too much that

170
00:10:21.729 --> 00:10:24.130
it's only these impairment processes. And so I would

171
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.965
like the field to work towards. A more balanced

172
00:10:26.965 --> 00:10:32.255
view that incorporates also developmental adaptation and then you

173
00:10:32.255 --> 00:10:35.645
know makes differential predictions from both of these processes,

174
00:10:36.025 --> 00:10:39.414
um, uh, to see in which cases people develop

175
00:10:39.414 --> 00:10:41.895
strategies and skills and in which cases really there

176
00:10:41.895 --> 00:10:43.135
would be an impairment.

177
00:10:43.979 --> 00:10:48.250
Mhm. And what specific kinds of social and cognitive

178
00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:52.330
abilities are relevant in the context of uh repeated

179
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.770
or chronic childhood adversity? I mean, I, I think

180
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.609
that in your work, I read about attention, learning,

181
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.630
memory, problem solving, and some other abilities like this.

182
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.250
So, could you tell us about that?

183
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:12.679
Yeah. So, The way that we approach this, um,

184
00:11:12.729 --> 00:11:16.349
this perspective is to think. To ask the question,

185
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.260
what which type of adversity are particular individuals exposed

186
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.059
to? So for example, exposure to violence is is

187
00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:29.219
quite different than growing up in a loving nonviolent

188
00:11:29.219 --> 00:11:32.820
family context, but with low levels or unpredictable levels

189
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.359
of resources. And so, so I think it's important,

190
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:40.890
um, to not take what is sometimes called a

191
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.750
cumulative stress approach. So a cumulative stress approach is,

192
00:11:44.929 --> 00:11:46.479
is an approach where you kind of count up

193
00:11:46.479 --> 00:11:48.890
the different stressors that, that, that people have in

194
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.729
their lives and, and then people use these to

195
00:11:51.729 --> 00:11:55.559
predict, uh, outcomes like for example, um, you know,

196
00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.880
um, cognitive performance or, or a risk of psychopathology.

197
00:12:01.169 --> 00:12:04.609
So this cumulative approach does, does predict. Some of

198
00:12:04.609 --> 00:12:06.729
these outcomes, but that's not the focus in this

199
00:12:06.729 --> 00:12:09.130
line of work. Here we take what what you

200
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.840
might call dimensional approach, and with this dimensional approach,

201
00:12:12.849 --> 00:12:16.090
you ask for particular types of adversity, what would

202
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.969
be possible strategies and skills that an individual would

203
00:12:18.969 --> 00:12:22.929
need to navigate this particular challenge, and then you

204
00:12:22.929 --> 00:12:25.849
can develop hypotheses about these skills. So to make

205
00:12:25.849 --> 00:12:29.469
it concrete, a specific example. Imagine that a child

206
00:12:29.469 --> 00:12:31.669
is growing up in a world that is, you

207
00:12:31.669 --> 00:12:36.109
know, that is changing very rapidly. So sometimes, you

208
00:12:36.109 --> 00:12:38.359
know, suddenly there is a potential reward in the

209
00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:41.549
environment, but it's also gone quickly or suddenly out

210
00:12:41.549 --> 00:12:45.869
of nowhere, there might be a threat emerging. OK.

211
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.090
And so a child that's in an environment like

212
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.650
this, you could hypothesize, you know, and, and this

213
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.770
is also a thought that, that other researchers have

214
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.929
proposed, so I don't want to take credit for

215
00:12:56.929 --> 00:13:00.500
it, but you might hypothesize that individuals would Um,

216
00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.880
you know, would be more vigilant and as a

217
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.359
result, they might be good at picking up changes

218
00:13:07.359 --> 00:13:12.359
in their environment or rapidly updating their information state

219
00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:14.250
because they're in a world that's changing quickly, whereas

220
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.479
if you're in a world where, you know, maybe

221
00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:18.679
you come home and your parents say, oh, you

222
00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:21.770
know, why don't you go do your homework? Um,

223
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.020
IN your bedroom, it's stable, quiet, you know, and

224
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.020
then 2 hours from now when you come, come

225
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.940
down, uh, from your bedroom, there will be, there

226
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.940
will be dinner. Dinner will be ready, right? So

227
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.530
now this child can really focus with sustained attention

228
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.909
on this. You know, learning this, this, this, this

229
00:13:38.909 --> 00:13:41.190
homework, whereas another child is in a much more

230
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:45.510
dynamic context where many things are happening, including threats

231
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.059
but also opportunities, um, and, and that child would

232
00:13:49.059 --> 00:13:52.750
be potentially shifting their attention more, updating their working

233
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:57.140
memory faster. And so you might imagine that, uh,

234
00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.590
children in those contexts would develop enhanced attention shifting

235
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.799
or enhanced working memory updating. Maybe particularly if they

236
00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:08.400
were in that type of context. OK. So in

237
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.320
some cases, it's not just the developmental exposures that

238
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.750
matter, but also what is the context within which

239
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.549
we test people's abilities.

240
00:14:16.549 --> 00:14:21.309
Mhm. And are there unique strengths and uh abilities

241
00:14:21.309 --> 00:14:25.750
that develop in response to high stress environments? And

242
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.669
if so, what would these strengths and abilities be?

243
00:14:30.409 --> 00:14:36.270
Yeah. So, I like to distinguish between, you know,

244
00:14:36.429 --> 00:14:39.669
strategies and, and so those I see as decision

245
00:14:39.669 --> 00:14:43.590
making and behavior that is tailored to the demands

246
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:47.950
of adverse environments and hidden talents and those I

247
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.309
consider enhanced cognitive abilities, you know, enhanced in order

248
00:14:51.309 --> 00:14:55.770
to solve the challenge in an adverse environment. And

249
00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.349
I think there, you know, there is good evidence

250
00:14:59.349 --> 00:15:04.400
for adaptive strategies in harsh and unpredictable environments. Um,

251
00:15:04.479 --> 00:15:08.159
THERE'S, you know, there's a body of research that

252
00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:10.710
has grown over the past decades in this area.

253
00:15:11.039 --> 00:15:13.710
There is mathematical theory, um, that is used to

254
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.719
also make predictions in some cases. Um, THE hidden

255
00:15:17.719 --> 00:15:21.270
talents approach is much more recent. It's, it's an

256
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:24.669
approach that, uh, is about 10 years old, you

257
00:15:24.669 --> 00:15:27.390
know, fewer researchers have worked on it. And so

258
00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.650
I think the evidence for, for hidden talents for

259
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.429
these enhanced cognitive abilities is more limited. I do

260
00:15:34.429 --> 00:15:37.950
think there are interesting leads in the literature and

261
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:42.070
interesting findings, and some findings have been replicated, but

262
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.989
in other cases, the evidence is more mixed. So

263
00:15:44.989 --> 00:15:48.500
some studies do find it, others don't, or, um,

264
00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:50.525
you know, there's. One study that has found it,

265
00:15:50.815 --> 00:15:52.585
but we don't know the extent to which the

266
00:15:52.585 --> 00:15:55.934
result replicates or generalizes. So I would say that

267
00:15:55.934 --> 00:15:59.215
yes, there is evidence for strategies and there's some

268
00:15:59.215 --> 00:16:02.215
evidence for hidden talents, but that approach, um, you

269
00:16:02.215 --> 00:16:03.885
know, needs to be fleshed out more.

270
00:16:05.119 --> 00:16:09.049
Uh, SINCE you've already mentioned hidden talents, could you

271
00:16:09.049 --> 00:16:12.320
explain what these hidden talents are?

272
00:16:12.869 --> 00:16:18.409
Yeah, so hidden talents are cognitive abilities or cognitive

273
00:16:18.409 --> 00:16:22.559
processes, um, that, you know, that through a process

274
00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:28.090
of developmental adaptation have become strengthened or enhanced. You

275
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:31.530
know, in people who are exposed to a particular

276
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.109
form of adversity. So a concrete example that I

277
00:16:34.109 --> 00:16:36.239
think makes it very clear, and this is actually

278
00:16:36.609 --> 00:16:39.289
a study that's been done already a few decades

279
00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:42.539
ago, um, before kind of people, you know, were,

280
00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:44.609
were, were looking at these things from a hidden

281
00:16:44.609 --> 00:16:48.760
talents perspective, um, children who, you know, who grow

282
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:53.239
up in, in, in, in very abusive households. Uh,

283
00:16:53.369 --> 00:16:57.330
THEY, you know, in this particular study, they, when

284
00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:02.210
they were shown faces that were partially degraded, so

285
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.329
imagine like a photo of an angry face or

286
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:08.189
a happy face, and then there's like pixels overlaying

287
00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:09.848
on the picture. So it's kind of hard to

288
00:17:09.848 --> 00:17:14.170
see what's exactly the emotional expression. So children who

289
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.400
were physically abused relative to a non-abused control group.

290
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.790
Um, THEY, they were more accurate at reading, uh,

291
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.920
the angry face. This is a study that was

292
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.160
led by Seth Pollock in 2002. And, and so

293
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.319
why is this really interesting? It's very interesting because

294
00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:33.000
it's showing that these children from, from these abusive

295
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.949
backgrounds who, who would on average typically in most

296
00:17:35.949 --> 00:17:39.719
studies perform lower on on certain cognitive tests, they

297
00:17:39.719 --> 00:17:44.050
actually performed higher on this cognitive test, specifically on

298
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.920
in recognizing uh an angry emotional expression. And so

299
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.859
that, that you could characterize as an enhancement in

300
00:17:51.859 --> 00:17:55.640
their ability to detect information in the environment. Now,

301
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.910
I will say that not all studies find this,

302
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.400
uh, there are, there's another finding in the literature

303
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.680
which is actually more common, um, and that's when

304
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.500
people find what's called a hostile attribution bias. So

305
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:14.069
when there's kind of imperfect information. Like ambiguous information

306
00:18:14.069 --> 00:18:17.660
like a degraded face, um, you know, people who

307
00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.780
have had many negative experiences, for example, to violence,

308
00:18:20.829 --> 00:18:22.469
they might just be more likely to give a

309
00:18:22.469 --> 00:18:25.310
negative experience, but they would do that not only

310
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.430
when the face is actually expressing anger, in which

311
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.630
case they're accurately inferring it, but also if the

312
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:35.229
face would be, for example, happy. Right. And so

313
00:18:35.229 --> 00:18:38.310
if you're, if you're interpreting an ambiguous but actually

314
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.900
happy face as angry, that's not being more accurate.

315
00:18:42.109 --> 00:18:45.709
That's, that's sort of over attributing anger to to

316
00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:47.709
the face. Uh, AND so there's on the one

317
00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:50.310
hand enhanced accuracy in some cases, and that I

318
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.910
would consider consistent with with hidden talents, but if

319
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.989
there is, um, you know, basically bias towards a

320
00:18:56.989 --> 00:19:00.189
hostile attribution, that that would not be considered a

321
00:19:00.189 --> 00:19:00.910
hidden talent.

322
00:19:02.609 --> 00:19:06.729
So when it comes to enhanced emotion detection in

323
00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:11.290
unpredictable environments and particularly when it, when it is

324
00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:18.479
associated with danger, I mean, is there uh enhanced

325
00:19:18.479 --> 00:19:21.880
emotion detection in those kinds of environments? And if

326
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:26.569
so, which kinds of emotions, uh, would, uh, I

327
00:19:26.569 --> 00:19:29.569
mean, what are the kinds of emotions whose detection

328
00:19:29.569 --> 00:19:30.829
would be enhanced?

329
00:19:31.589 --> 00:19:35.310
Yeah. So the finding I just described from 20

330
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.030
years ago that was focused on, on, on, on

331
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.510
threat, um, and children who had been abused, but

332
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.109
there is actually a body of research and this

333
00:19:44.109 --> 00:19:48.170
body, I think, you know, I have, you know,

334
00:19:48.349 --> 00:19:50.829
I have substantial trust in because there are quite

335
00:19:50.829 --> 00:19:53.150
a large number of studies, there is quite a

336
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.239
large number of studies. Um, MANY of, of whom,

337
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.589
uh, or at least several of whom have adopted

338
00:19:59.839 --> 00:20:04.040
kind of gold standard open science practices like pre-registration

339
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.079
or have used a registered report format, and, and

340
00:20:07.079 --> 00:20:12.239
that work is on empathic accuracy. And, um, and

341
00:20:12.239 --> 00:20:15.729
so it's inferring people's kind of internal emotional states.

342
00:20:16.449 --> 00:20:19.060
And um, but that work is not focusing on

343
00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.329
people who have been abused, but it's focusing on

344
00:20:22.579 --> 00:20:28.270
people who come from uh uh less favorable socioeconomic

345
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.689
backgrounds. OK, so that's, that's a different group, um.

346
00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:36.589
But one of the thoughts, there are several theories

347
00:20:36.589 --> 00:20:39.510
about, about why, why this pattern occurs, but in,

348
00:20:39.589 --> 00:20:41.939
in, I would say about 2/3 of the studies

349
00:20:41.939 --> 00:20:44.239
that have been done in, in, in this context,

350
00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.790
people who come from less favorable socioeconomic backgrounds score

351
00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.550
higher on empathic accuracy, OK? And this is true

352
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.550
both when they are shown static pictures uh of

353
00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:59.939
emotion of very subtle emotional expression, so, um. So

354
00:20:59.939 --> 00:21:02.750
you'll see a picture of uh of just the

355
00:21:02.869 --> 00:21:04.660
the eyes of an individual and then they are

356
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.739
either looking angry, suspicious, sad, or, you know, wary

357
00:21:09.739 --> 00:21:12.459
or something, and those are sort of subtle differences,

358
00:21:12.859 --> 00:21:16.020
um, but, but people from less favorable socioeconomic backgrounds

359
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.660
are more likely to um to judge these more

360
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.469
accurately in most studies. And um there's also work

361
00:21:23.469 --> 00:21:26.229
on this with uh dynamic stimuli. So there you

362
00:21:26.229 --> 00:21:28.150
don't see just a, you know, a slice of

363
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.829
a face, but you actually see a person kind

364
00:21:29.829 --> 00:21:34.780
of talking and expressing emotion. And so, You know,

365
00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:39.599
it's, it's not known exactly why this. Pattern occurs

366
00:21:39.599 --> 00:21:41.750
there there could be different reasons for this. Um,

367
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.089
IT could be for example that um people in

368
00:21:45.099 --> 00:21:50.280
in in less favorable socioeconomic conditions are more dependent

369
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.439
on each other, right? So if you have all

370
00:21:52.439 --> 00:21:57.140
the resources in the world, um. In a way,

371
00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.969
you're less dependent on other people because, you know,

372
00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.530
with the resources that you have, you can always

373
00:22:04.479 --> 00:22:06.209
You know, for example, if you need a ride

374
00:22:06.209 --> 00:22:07.770
to the airport, you can, you can, you can

375
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:09.969
buy a taxi, you know, or if your fridge

376
00:22:09.969 --> 00:22:12.569
breaks down, you can ask somebody else, uh, or

377
00:22:12.569 --> 00:22:14.089
you can just buy a new fridge. But if

378
00:22:14.089 --> 00:22:16.329
you're more interdependent, if you have fewer resources, you

379
00:22:16.329 --> 00:22:18.770
might just need You know, you need each other

380
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.650
more sometimes and so um and so then being

381
00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:24.839
attuned to other people's internal states could be um

382
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:27.770
you know a a a favorite response and so

383
00:22:28.209 --> 00:22:32.489
through phenotypic plasticity through developmental adjustments, it's possible that

384
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.290
that people uh from from kind of less favorable

385
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:39.890
socioeconomic backgrounds become more empathically accurate. What's I think

386
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.569
not really known in in this particular literature is

387
00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:44.969
to what extent is this shaped by sort of

388
00:22:44.969 --> 00:22:49.810
developmental experiences versus an individual's current state. OK, so

389
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.089
if you take someone who came from sort of

390
00:22:52.089 --> 00:22:55.969
well resourced early environments, but now they're currently experiencing

391
00:22:55.969 --> 00:22:59.599
low resources, to what extent does that shift their

392
00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.170
ability versus is it more like a gradually developed

393
00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.449
trait over the course of development. But it is

394
00:23:05.449 --> 00:23:08.329
one of the examples where the empirical evidence, I

395
00:23:08.329 --> 00:23:12.780
think is, is, uh, you know, relatively convincing. Mhm.

396
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.709
And when and how do people living in high

397
00:23:16.709 --> 00:23:22.739
stress environments develop strengths or become more psychologically vulnerable?

398
00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:25.339
I mean, when is it, when and how is

399
00:23:25.339 --> 00:23:28.780
it that one or the other happens?

400
00:23:29.609 --> 00:23:32.400
Yeah, well, that's a, that's a, you know, that's

401
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.319
a um. You know, that's a, that's a big

402
00:23:37.319 --> 00:23:39.439
and a challenging question. It's a, it's a very

403
00:23:39.439 --> 00:23:43.640
important question and um in terms of kind of

404
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.239
vulnerability, for example, the psychopathology, I will, I will

405
00:23:48.239 --> 00:23:50.920
not say too much about that because uh my

406
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:55.569
expertise in that area is, is more limited. But

407
00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:59.140
I would say that um if you zoom out,

408
00:23:59.319 --> 00:24:05.000
you know, the more severely intense the stressful experiences

409
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.680
are, the more distressing they are, the more prolonged

410
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.880
these experiences are through time. Is it a week?

411
00:24:11.959 --> 00:24:16.449
Is it, you know, your whole life? And um

412
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.229
the more domains of your life in which you

413
00:24:19.229 --> 00:24:23.430
are experiencing these different stressors, the more, you know,

414
00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:29.349
likely people are to develop, um. You know, Psychological

415
00:24:29.349 --> 00:24:33.390
vulnerabilities. Now, it's also true that actually sometimes people

416
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.589
talk about this in a little bit of a

417
00:24:34.589 --> 00:24:38.310
deterministic way, but actually, you know, in, in quite

418
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:43.219
stressful environments. Many people and, and, and you know,

419
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.729
often the majority of people do not actually develop

420
00:24:45.729 --> 00:24:48.660
these vulnerabilities uh but it is true that people

421
00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.170
in such environments are on average more likely to

422
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:56.859
develop such vulnerabilities. Now there are also factors that

423
00:24:56.859 --> 00:25:00.020
um that are sometimes called protective factors in the

424
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:03.910
literature on resilience, um. And those protective factors are

425
00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.550
things that make it sort of less likely that

426
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:10.869
somebody will develop these vulnerabilities despite being in these

427
00:25:10.869 --> 00:25:16.069
challenging circumstances. And, and one example of a protective

428
00:25:16.069 --> 00:25:20.859
factor for children is, um, you know, the presence

429
00:25:20.859 --> 00:25:25.979
of caring adults slash role models in their environment.

430
00:25:26.109 --> 00:25:28.750
So, um, you know, imagine that there's a child

431
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.180
and it's growing up in a family, um. You

432
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.430
know, that's, that's really struggling, um. And maybe the

433
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:39.189
parents, you know, are, are struggling to, you know,

434
00:25:39.349 --> 00:25:42.800
to, to find the time to really Help their

435
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.439
children with the challenges that they're facing, uh, whether

436
00:25:45.439 --> 00:25:48.310
it be, you know, going to school safely or,

437
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.829
uh, you know, getting their homework solved. Um, IMAGINE

438
00:25:53.829 --> 00:25:55.390
that there would then be an uncle or a

439
00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.439
neighbor that's, you know, very supportive of this child,

440
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.719
that, that really makes it more likely that this

441
00:26:00.719 --> 00:26:03.189
child is going to, um, not have these kinds

442
00:26:03.189 --> 00:26:07.790
of vulnerabilities play a role. But you know, even

443
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:12.270
people who do develop potentially these vulnerabilities, it could

444
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.550
still be the case that they also have strengths

445
00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:19.219
that are unrecognized by perspectives that only focus on

446
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.430
um on sort of deficits and vulnerabilities. So, um,

447
00:26:23.589 --> 00:26:25.709
I, I think of these things as in some

448
00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:27.859
cases being mutually compatible.

449
00:26:29.329 --> 00:26:34.369
Mhm. Uh, ARE there environments where impulsive behavior is

450
00:26:34.369 --> 00:26:35.079
adaptive?

451
00:26:36.609 --> 00:26:40.920
Right. So, um, you know, just like the expected

452
00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.209
childhood, uh, but even more so with impulsivity, there

453
00:26:44.209 --> 00:26:47.310
are different definitions of this, uh, concept in the

454
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:51.359
field, and so that matters because, um, you know,

455
00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.130
Impulsivity defined one way might be adaptive in context

456
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:58.530
A, whereas impulsivity defined another way might be adaptive

457
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.699
in context B, um, or there are actually some

458
00:27:01.699 --> 00:27:05.680
definitions of impulsivity, which, which a priori define it

459
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.170
as a maladaptive behavior. So then you then it's

460
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.359
never possible to say that it's adaptive, you know,

461
00:27:11.959 --> 00:27:17.359
um, but I, I think so, so. Um, IT'S

462
00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:22.439
possible to distinguish between information impulsivity and temporal impulsivity.

463
00:27:22.479 --> 00:27:25.439
And so information impulsivity is about how much information

464
00:27:25.439 --> 00:27:27.869
do I want to gather before making a decision.

465
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.579
And so, um, And so if I, you know,

466
00:27:32.739 --> 00:27:35.380
if I, um, if I'm really thinking through the

467
00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.699
consequences of my actions and gathering information on, you

468
00:27:38.699 --> 00:27:42.060
know, the possible outcomes, then I'm not very information

469
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.369
impulsive, whereas, you know, if I very quickly make

470
00:27:44.369 --> 00:27:47.540
a decision without thinking through or without gathering information

471
00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.359
about the possible outcomes, that's, that's, you know, that's

472
00:27:50.359 --> 00:27:52.540
impulsive. So think about like somebody who immediately, they

473
00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.219
see a nice house, they just buy it right

474
00:27:54.219 --> 00:27:56.300
away if they, if they can, but then suddenly

475
00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.949
they realize that there are consequences. And temporal impulsivity

476
00:28:00.949 --> 00:28:03.479
is more about the extent to which you prefer

477
00:28:03.729 --> 00:28:07.150
so so all or most people prefer sooner or

478
00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:12.030
later outcomes, um, but, but there's a lot of

479
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.869
individual variation in, in, in how strong this preference

480
00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:18.550
for immediate outcomes is and so temporal impulsivity is

481
00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:23.229
uh focused on, um, you know, how much do

482
00:28:23.229 --> 00:28:26.459
people prefer the immediate outcome and so let's focus

483
00:28:26.459 --> 00:28:32.510
on. When would temporal impulsivity be adaptive, so Maybe

484
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.420
you are familiar with the, the marshmallow test. Is

485
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.449
that something you've heard about so children are offered,

486
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.119
you know, one marshmallow now or 2 marshmallows later,

487
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:48.839
maybe after 10 or 15 minutes. And um, And

488
00:28:48.839 --> 00:28:52.050
so some children eat the the marshmallow instantaneously and

489
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:53.839
then there are other children and, and they wait

490
00:28:53.839 --> 00:28:55.969
and there are nice videos of this online if

491
00:28:55.969 --> 00:28:57.930
you think this sounds fun, you can, you know,

492
00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:01.250
Google it and, and you'll find uh also children

493
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.650
who, for example, open up the marshmallow and take

494
00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.569
some of the inside and eat it and then

495
00:29:05.569 --> 00:29:07.170
close it back and put it, you know, back

496
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.890
waiting for the researcher to come back so they

497
00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:11.089
get the second marshmallow. But they have at least

498
00:29:11.089 --> 00:29:17.170
also had some immediate rewards. Anyway, um, So, so

499
00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.089
when children grow up in a world where future

500
00:29:20.089 --> 00:29:24.880
rewards are much more uncertain than immediate rewards, maybe

501
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.849
because their environment is changing quickly or because they

502
00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:32.089
have little control over their environment or over or

503
00:29:32.089 --> 00:29:34.369
about where they are in their environment, maybe, you

504
00:29:34.369 --> 00:29:37.170
know, they, they just kind of moved around and

505
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.089
they don't know whether they're going to be around.

506
00:29:39.579 --> 00:29:42.050
Um, TO, to cash in on the later reward,

507
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:46.079
maybe other people are either unwilling or unable to,

508
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:48.329
um, you know, to, to, to give them the

509
00:29:48.329 --> 00:29:52.290
future rewards and so children who grow up in

510
00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:56.280
such environments are more likely. To take the first

511
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.400
marshmallow instead of wait for the later marshmallows. And

512
00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:03.949
in the literature, um, this was often characterized as

513
00:30:03.949 --> 00:30:06.900
a sort of a failure to delay gratification or

514
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.959
short-sightedness or an impairment in their inhibition, you know,

515
00:30:10.079 --> 00:30:12.670
their ability to kind of inhibit their immediate urge

516
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.079
to, to grab this first marshmallow. But, um, other

517
00:30:17.079 --> 00:30:20.140
researchers, including, for example, Martin, you know, Martin Daly

518
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.839
and, and, and, and others, they argued that In

519
00:30:23.839 --> 00:30:26.680
a world where future rewards are unlikely to materialize,

520
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.319
it might actually be, you know, adaptive for an

521
00:30:29.319 --> 00:30:32.550
organism to um take the much more certain immediate

522
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.280
rewards. And so if you ask me, you know,

523
00:30:35.359 --> 00:30:38.719
what are the conditions in which impulsivity, uh, might

524
00:30:38.719 --> 00:30:42.920
be adaptive, um, you know, uh, those conditions, you

525
00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.560
know, it matters in part based on how likely

526
00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.640
the future reward is and there's also mathematical modeling

527
00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.199
that has. You know, analyzed, uh, this problem and

528
00:30:52.209 --> 00:30:56.300
and that supports also uh. Yeah, this hypothesis. And

529
00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.729
so, It matters because this is a case, remember

530
00:30:59.729 --> 00:31:02.089
at the beginning um I mentioned that there are

531
00:31:02.089 --> 00:31:04.969
some cases where people characterize something as an impairment,

532
00:31:05.209 --> 00:31:08.609
but actually, you know, it's possible to view it

533
00:31:08.609 --> 00:31:10.209
or to reframe it as a as a as

534
00:31:10.209 --> 00:31:12.770
an adaptive strategy. So if it's true that a

535
00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.489
child is growing up in a world where future

536
00:31:14.489 --> 00:31:17.930
rewards are unlikely to materialize and it's showing. You

537
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.969
know, a a stronger preference for these immediate rewards

538
00:31:20.969 --> 00:31:23.890
rather than saying, oh this child has a deficit,

539
00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.890
it might be more accurate to say this child

540
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:30.199
is responding adaptively in just the same way that

541
00:31:30.369 --> 00:31:33.849
any other or most other individuals would had they

542
00:31:33.849 --> 00:31:38.040
grown up in this context. And what's really striking,

543
00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.869
and there's some very interesting work on this, um,

544
00:31:41.079 --> 00:31:45.930
among others by Celeste Kids and Yuko Munakata and

545
00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:49.760
Laura Michaelson, where they have shown that the extent

546
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.310
to which children wait for this second marshmallow, um,

547
00:31:53.369 --> 00:31:55.719
it depends also on the extent to which they

548
00:31:55.719 --> 00:31:58.780
trust. The extent to which, for example, an adult

549
00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.140
is, is going to give that that that that

550
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:05.619
later reward. OK. So, um, in, in one set

551
00:32:05.619 --> 00:32:10.420
of studies, uh, what's been manipulated is, um, whether

552
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:14.160
the child, you know, in a previous interaction, the,

553
00:32:14.229 --> 00:32:16.859
the adult actually lived up to their promise towards

554
00:32:16.859 --> 00:32:18.900
the child, and if they didn't, the child thinks,

555
00:32:18.939 --> 00:32:21.410
oh, this adult is maybe not so reliable, you

556
00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.020
know, I'm, I'm actually not going to wait for

557
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.819
the second marshmallow, so children who do development mentally

558
00:32:25.819 --> 00:32:29.989
come from On average, you know, relatively reliable environments,

559
00:32:30.339 --> 00:32:33.060
um, they kind of quickly adjust their behavioral strategy,

560
00:32:33.589 --> 00:32:36.510
um, when the experimenter might not be reliable towards

561
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:40.229
them. And in another set of studies, the adult

562
00:32:40.229 --> 00:32:43.670
was behaving unreliably towards another adult rather than to

563
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.790
the child itself. But then the child, you know,

564
00:32:45.869 --> 00:32:47.989
noticed this and, and was like, OK, well in

565
00:32:47.989 --> 00:32:50.050
that case, I'm, I'm less likely to wait for

566
00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:52.420
my future rewards. Yeah.

567
00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:57.189
Right. So, uh, I think this is sort of

568
00:32:57.189 --> 00:33:00.619
related to the previous question. In what kinds of

569
00:33:00.619 --> 00:33:05.280
contexts do people develop a present oriented psychology?

570
00:33:06.089 --> 00:33:09.239
Yeah, yeah, I agree that is um that is

571
00:33:09.239 --> 00:33:15.319
related because so a present oriented psychology, um, we

572
00:33:15.319 --> 00:33:19.709
could characterize as a as a psychology that's prioritizing.

573
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.489
The present over the future in general and so

574
00:33:22.489 --> 00:33:27.290
that includes potentially like immediate rewards over future rewards

575
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:31.060
but also it might for example you know um

576
00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.890
be the case that the organism is, is very

577
00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:35.650
attuned to threats that that might be currently present

578
00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.079
so that you're also focused on the present, uh,

579
00:33:38.089 --> 00:33:42.400
on rapidly updating information now and maybe you know,

580
00:33:42.969 --> 00:33:45.890
using cognition to do that maybe more than sort

581
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:49.410
of focusing, you know, storing things. Into long term

582
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.890
memory, which is a more future oriented thing in

583
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:57.510
some in some sense. Um, AND, and so, You

584
00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:01.900
know, It's a complicated question, but you know, from

585
00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.780
a bird's eye view, I, I'd say in environments

586
00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:09.870
that are um. You know, that, that are changing

587
00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.800
rapidly. Um, ONE of the tricky bits is that

588
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.629
change can take different forms, so environments might change.

589
00:34:18.478 --> 00:34:21.050
In a way where you know the current state

590
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.090
of the world does predict next states of the

591
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:27.409
world. So for example, if today's weather predicts tomorrow's

592
00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:30.370
weather, um, we would say that the state of

593
00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.570
the world is auto correlated. There is a correlation

594
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:37.810
from today with tomorrow, um, but change might also

595
00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.850
be what people might call stochastic, um, and so

596
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:44.688
then, uh, you know, tomorrow is is is is

597
00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:46.850
is not so predictable, uh, from today. Of course

598
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:49.629
this is a continuum. Uh, uh, HAD the extent

599
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:52.120
to which there is auto correlation and it can

600
00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.540
differ for different dimensions of the environment, so it

601
00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.810
could be that, for example, um, you know, threat

602
00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:01.659
is, is, is, is relatively highly auto correlated, but

603
00:35:02.139 --> 00:35:05.219
resources are not or vice versa. And so in

604
00:35:05.219 --> 00:35:07.300
general, and this is really one of the, I

605
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.300
almost want to say sort of a soapbox that

606
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:13.620
I like to get on, um, when we're studying.

607
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:18.590
Developmental adaptations to, you know, childhood environments or or

608
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:24.629
environments in general, it's really, really crucial to characterize

609
00:35:24.629 --> 00:35:29.540
the environment in a very precise and fine-grained way.

610
00:35:30.219 --> 00:35:33.330
And so, This is one of the things that

611
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:37.909
I really like about Like ecologists and evolutionary biologists,

612
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.879
but also, you know, vision scientists, for example, in,

613
00:35:40.989 --> 00:35:44.510
in, in human cognition, um, is that they're interested

614
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.310
in the adaptive fit between organisms and their environment.

615
00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:51.810
And they really try to characterize the environment in

616
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:53.989
a lot of detail. And so that means, for

617
00:35:53.989 --> 00:35:55.909
example, not just saying, oh, there, there are high

618
00:35:55.909 --> 00:35:57.949
or low levels of threats, but also how does

619
00:35:57.949 --> 00:36:01.030
threat change through space and time. And you know,

620
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:03.810
is it different for neighborhoodhood threat versus, you know,

621
00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:12.060
family threat? And um, You know, when you characterize

622
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.939
the environment much more precisely, you can also develop

623
00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:18.290
more precise hypotheses about what would be the kind

624
00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:22.060
of cognitive strategy or behavioral strategy or skill that

625
00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:26.620
would benefit the individual, um, in that context. Yeah.

626
00:36:27.439 --> 00:36:27.449
Mhm.

627
00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:32.879
Why is there a high prevalence of violence in

628
00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.840
deprived communities?

629
00:36:36.159 --> 00:36:41.479
Yeah. Well, I, I would first say that it's

630
00:36:41.479 --> 00:36:51.050
um. It's It's true in Some countries that in

631
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:54.969
deprived communities, uh, there are higher rates of violence

632
00:36:54.969 --> 00:36:58.770
than there are in more affluent communities, but there

633
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:04.959
are also um communities where uh resources are low,

634
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:10.750
where violence is not necessarily more prevalent. Um, AND,

635
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.790
and so, um, you know, when we think through

636
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.989
these questions, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, uh, yeah,

637
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.310
it's important to, to acknowledge that variation, I think.

638
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.879
But it is true that in in in in

639
00:37:23.879 --> 00:37:27.040
some industrialized countries, uh this, this, this is the

640
00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.350
case and um the reasons for this are really

641
00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:36.179
multifactorial, like there are many reasons for this. Um,

642
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.229
AND, and sometimes those reasons are hard to tease

643
00:37:38.229 --> 00:37:40.510
apart, but I will focus maybe on one reason.

644
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:47.429
In deprived, in resource deprived communities, there are many,

645
00:37:47.659 --> 00:37:50.100
there are relatively many people who are struggling to

646
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:55.239
make ends meet. OK, and so for example, they,

647
00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:57.280
they might not be able to, you know, to,

648
00:37:57.479 --> 00:37:59.760
to feed their children that evening or or buy

649
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:04.030
clothes that they need for their children or they

650
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:06.760
cannot pay rent and so they risk being evicted

651
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.840
from their house, which has major downstream consequences. If

652
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.689
you're evicted from your house, it might be much

653
00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:14.520
harder to sustain your job. If you don't sustain

654
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.520
your job, your income, you know, falls out and

655
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.719
you know, maybe you end up in a homeless

656
00:38:19.719 --> 00:38:21.639
situation with a lot of threats living on the

657
00:38:21.639 --> 00:38:24.500
street. So people are in sort of, uh, you

658
00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.620
know, in a really difficult situation. And when people

659
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.649
are and sometimes be, you know, a concept that

660
00:38:31.739 --> 00:38:35.379
that Daniel Nettle and Benoit Cupon, for example, use

661
00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:39.139
for this is is something like a desperation threshold

662
00:38:39.139 --> 00:38:41.100
below which people are not able to meet their

663
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:45.209
basic needs. When you are below this threshold, it

664
00:38:45.209 --> 00:38:51.679
might. You know, it it might be. A reasonable

665
00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:55.840
response for an individual to try to engage in

666
00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.439
a high risk behavior and by a high risk

667
00:38:58.439 --> 00:39:00.870
behavior I mean a behavior that could lead them

668
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:03.479
to actually have a very favorable outcome above this

669
00:39:03.479 --> 00:39:06.800
desperation threshold, even if it's also possible that it

670
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.000
actually leads them to be in a worse position.

671
00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:13.350
OK, so for example, if I choose a safe

672
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:17.030
option like a low wage job, um, but that's

673
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:19.270
not going to help me actually pay the rent

674
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:21.389
anymore, and I will get evicted and I will

675
00:39:21.389 --> 00:39:24.300
run into all these problems, that low wage job

676
00:39:24.909 --> 00:39:27.560
is not such an attractive option. If there's another

677
00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:32.340
option which might involve violence like robbery. Um, YOU

678
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.139
know, that's a much more high risk option. Something

679
00:39:34.139 --> 00:39:36.020
really bad could happen for me, but it could

680
00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.459
also be the case that now I do have

681
00:39:37.459 --> 00:39:40.300
these resources that I need to, you know, to,

682
00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:43.699
to, you know, pay rent, or in some cases,

683
00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.340
you know, if people, um, struggle with drug addiction,

684
00:39:46.379 --> 00:39:49.379
it might help them satisfy this sort of for

685
00:39:49.379 --> 00:39:53.100
them basic need of of of procuring um the

686
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.979
drugs. Now let me just highlight that the vast

687
00:39:55.979 --> 00:39:58.969
majority of people in deprived communities do not engage

688
00:39:58.969 --> 00:40:03.610
in violence. But a subset of them, um, you

689
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:06.479
know, might use that as a strategy to obtain,

690
00:40:06.629 --> 00:40:09.070
you know, resources that they need in order to,

691
00:40:09.169 --> 00:40:13.139
um, Get above the desperation threshold. Now what's what's

692
00:40:13.139 --> 00:40:17.600
interesting about this desperation threshold idea um is that

693
00:40:17.899 --> 00:40:21.020
it also predicts, so it doesn't just predict that

694
00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.459
below the threshold maybe, you know, in some cases

695
00:40:23.459 --> 00:40:26.899
risk taking is favored, including violence could be viewed

696
00:40:26.899 --> 00:40:29.379
as a form of risk taking in some cases,

697
00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.989
but when you're above the thresholds you actually wanna

698
00:40:32.989 --> 00:40:35.419
not take very many risks. You don't want variance

699
00:40:35.419 --> 00:40:38.280
in your outcomes because variance in your outcome. Could

700
00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.719
also mean you fall below the threshold. So then

701
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.199
what this idea predicts is that when you're above

702
00:40:43.199 --> 00:40:46.600
the threshold, you actually are more risk averse. And

703
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.879
so it predicts a discontinuity where if an individual

704
00:40:49.879 --> 00:40:53.070
feels like they're below the desperation threshold, then it,

705
00:40:53.229 --> 00:40:55.520
it increases the chances that they will take more

706
00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.399
risk and and. More risk can be taken in

707
00:40:58.399 --> 00:41:00.439
different ways. You can also buy lottery tickets, which

708
00:41:00.439 --> 00:41:03.199
is nonviolent, but for some people it might mean

709
00:41:03.199 --> 00:41:07.699
using violence to try to obtain resources. Mhm.

710
00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:12.449
So earlier when we talked about hidden talents, this

711
00:41:12.449 --> 00:41:15.679
is something that you touched on a little bit.

712
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:20.320
What is resilience and how do people develop it?

713
00:41:20.719 --> 00:41:26.020
Yeah. So it's interesting and actually um my, my,

714
00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:28.750
my uh colleague and collaborator Bruce Ellis, um, I

715
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:31.149
think he phrased this well in a paper, uh

716
00:41:31.149 --> 00:41:35.030
we, we wrote together, um, because this is a

717
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:38.110
question that's, that's commonly asked when people are interested

718
00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:40.030
in hidden talents, they say, oh, is this, is

719
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:44.070
this the resilience approach basically, um, and the resilience

720
00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:46.169
approach, you know, it has been around for a

721
00:41:46.169 --> 00:41:49.469
few decades, uh, uh, a leading researcher in this

722
00:41:49.469 --> 00:41:53.280
area has been, for example, Anne Masten. And um

723
00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.439
she's written a book, Ordinary Magic, which is explaining

724
00:41:56.439 --> 00:42:01.520
uh the approach and The way that Bruce Ellis

725
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.820
characterized it, um, is, is as follows. So the,

726
00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:10.260
in the resilience literature, people ask, you know, Despite

727
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:16.179
exposures to adversity, Some individuals do achieve kind of

728
00:42:16.179 --> 00:42:19.739
favorable outcomes like having, you know, a stable income,

729
00:42:19.899 --> 00:42:23.860
having stable social relationships, not struggling with mental health

730
00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:27.939
or addictions or not, you know, and so they

731
00:42:27.939 --> 00:42:32.459
have particular outcomes despite the adversity they experienced. They

732
00:42:32.459 --> 00:42:36.520
beat the odds, you know, um. Whereas the hidden

733
00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:41.070
talents approach says not despite but because of adversity,

734
00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.830
because of the exposures to certain kinds of adversity,

735
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.199
people might develop skills that help them navigate this

736
00:42:48.199 --> 00:42:50.639
difficult challenge. So if you have low resources, for

737
00:42:50.639 --> 00:42:53.620
example, and you're more dependent on other. On their

738
00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.979
individuals maybe you develop enhancements in empathic accuracy. Now

739
00:42:56.979 --> 00:42:58.879
this idea is also not specific to the hidden

740
00:42:58.879 --> 00:43:02.139
talents approach. There are um researchers in kind of

741
00:43:02.139 --> 00:43:05.419
social and cognitive psychology that have that have developed

742
00:43:05.419 --> 00:43:07.110
these ideas as well, but it does fit with,

743
00:43:07.159 --> 00:43:09.899
with the hidden talents approach. And so here it's

744
00:43:09.899 --> 00:43:13.659
not despite of, but because of adversity an individual

745
00:43:13.659 --> 00:43:17.790
has developed uh a particular outcome. There's another important

746
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:21.919
related. Difference, and that is that the resilience approach

747
00:43:21.919 --> 00:43:26.250
tends to focus on um on outcomes that are

748
00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:29.719
socially kind of valued, that are considered socially desirable

749
00:43:29.719 --> 00:43:34.580
within society, within a particular society. But that's not

750
00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.939
necessarily true for the hidden talents approach. So for

751
00:43:36.939 --> 00:43:40.409
example, if it's the case that I grow up

752
00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:45.340
in a social environment where status, you know, is

753
00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:50.969
attained or resources are obtained through coercion in part,

754
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.060
OK, and so maybe through, you know, um, intimidating

755
00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:59.020
other people, intimidating other people or making sure that

756
00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:04.820
they don't mess with me. OK. The ability to,

757
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.709
um, you know, to get people to think that

758
00:44:08.709 --> 00:44:11.260
they should not mess with me in that environment,

759
00:44:11.429 --> 00:44:13.949
the ability to maybe intimidate other people in that

760
00:44:13.949 --> 00:44:18.270
context is a strategy that is benefiting potentially that

761
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:22.010
individual. But it's not something that people, you know,

762
00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:25.510
that would be generally considered socially desirable. But if,

763
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.949
if people in that context, in some cases develop

764
00:44:27.949 --> 00:44:33.189
enhancements in this ability. Um, YOU know, that, that

765
00:44:33.189 --> 00:44:34.949
would be considered a hidden talent. So I, I

766
00:44:34.949 --> 00:44:37.709
would say that the hidden talents approach does not

767
00:44:37.709 --> 00:44:42.020
necessarily focus on outcomes that are beneficial for society.

768
00:44:42.469 --> 00:44:44.590
Uh, IT might in some, in some cases people

769
00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:46.149
might, you know, when you, when you have a

770
00:44:46.149 --> 00:44:47.989
skill, it can be used for good or for

771
00:44:47.989 --> 00:44:50.399
bad in the sense of in a societal sense.

772
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:52.870
So if I'm better at, you know, let's say

773
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:54.989
reading other people, I could use it to help

774
00:44:54.989 --> 00:44:56.790
other people, but I could also use it to

775
00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.290
exploit other people, right? And so. The skill here

776
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:02.169
is what the focus is of the hidden talents

777
00:45:02.169 --> 00:45:05.159
approach and then whether it's used in a socially

778
00:45:05.159 --> 00:45:09.090
desirable way or socially undesirable way is less important

779
00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:13.010
to the hidden talents approach. Um, ALTHOUGH in this

780
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.090
approach too, we're very interested in, you know, when

781
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:19.189
we characterize people's skills. How can we help them

782
00:45:19.189 --> 00:45:22.379
leverage these skills in ways that benefit them and

783
00:45:22.379 --> 00:45:23.899
that benefit also society?

784
00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:30.199
Mhm. So taking into account what we've been talking

785
00:45:30.199 --> 00:45:34.479
about in terms of how humans develop in different

786
00:45:34.479 --> 00:45:38.320
kinds of contexts, are there, are there high degrees

787
00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:43.750
of phenotypic plasticity in humans, particularly when it comes

788
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:48.360
to being able to tailor development to different conditions?

789
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:56.189
Right, So, So, so phenotypic plasticity, the ability of

790
00:45:56.189 --> 00:46:01.409
organisms to um adjust their phenotypes, uh, in response

791
00:46:01.409 --> 00:46:04.429
to environmental conditions or another definition that sometimes used

792
00:46:04.429 --> 00:46:06.770
as sort of the capacity of a genotype to

793
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:10.179
produce, to express or produce different phenotypes depending on

794
00:46:10.179 --> 00:46:14.879
environmental conditions is widespread in nature. And so, you

795
00:46:14.879 --> 00:46:20.629
know, most or all species exhibit phenotypic plasticity in

796
00:46:20.629 --> 00:46:25.070
some traits. OK, so an example of a phenotypically

797
00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:28.989
plastic trait would be the stress response system if

798
00:46:28.989 --> 00:46:31.979
you grow up in a world that is safe

799
00:46:31.979 --> 00:46:33.870
and supportive and stable and you have a lot

800
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:37.070
of control over outcomes, your stress response system is

801
00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:39.070
going to on average develop differently than if you

802
00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.469
grow up in the world. You know, where there's

803
00:46:41.469 --> 00:46:44.629
threats, there's unpredictability, you have little control over outcomes,

804
00:46:44.709 --> 00:46:47.139
and so there's plasticity in the stress response system.

805
00:46:47.199 --> 00:46:50.760
It's shaped through developmental processes in a particular way,

806
00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:54.520
on average. Now there are also traits where we

807
00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.110
don't exhibit phenotypic plasticity. So for example, the number

808
00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.159
of eyes in humans is not phenotypically plastic. If

809
00:47:00.159 --> 00:47:03.439
we grow up in a world that's where there's

810
00:47:03.439 --> 00:47:06.429
relatively low amounts of sunlight, it's not the case

811
00:47:06.719 --> 00:47:08.949
that we, you know, that we develop a third

812
00:47:08.949 --> 00:47:12.179
eye, for example, right? And so it's always important

813
00:47:12.179 --> 00:47:14.790
when asking about phenotypic plasticity to sort of say.

814
00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:19.260
OK, in which traits are we considering phenotypic plasticity?

815
00:47:19.969 --> 00:47:23.030
And then to sort of say, and, and, you

816
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.979
know, what are the types of inputs to which

817
00:47:25.979 --> 00:47:31.100
this trait can respond. OK. And um and so

818
00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:34.409
I, you know, humans are certainly uh uh in

819
00:47:34.419 --> 00:47:39.909
in in many traits, um. Uh, A highly phenotypically

820
00:47:39.909 --> 00:47:44.830
plastic species. Uh, SO, so some, some, some animals,

821
00:47:44.959 --> 00:47:48.409
um, they, they can learn about some very specific

822
00:47:48.409 --> 00:47:52.810
thing. Um, BUT they, you know, they cannot, you

823
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:55.290
know, they can learn that a particular input is

824
00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:58.750
associated with a particular output. Uh, IT'S acquired through

825
00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:02.229
experiences, but, but they can learn the breadth of

826
00:48:02.229 --> 00:48:05.189
information that humans can learn, right? And so, so

827
00:48:05.189 --> 00:48:08.760
humans can learn a very broad range of information.

828
00:48:08.909 --> 00:48:11.810
Now it's not the case that Animal learning always

829
00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:14.929
is of course just simple stimulus response like animals

830
00:48:14.929 --> 00:48:18.179
can also in some cases learn uh very complex

831
00:48:18.179 --> 00:48:21.270
uh and quite broad things but but humans um

832
00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:23.689
are unusual in the extent I think to which

833
00:48:23.689 --> 00:48:27.370
we, um, which we can do this and you

834
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:31.399
know that's, that's not so it's interesting because sometimes.

835
00:48:32.219 --> 00:48:34.979
That's characterized it so, you know, we, they have

836
00:48:34.979 --> 00:48:37.800
sort of the other non-human animals have specific learning

837
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.850
mechanisms and humans have, you know, general learning mechanisms.

838
00:48:40.969 --> 00:48:46.179
I don't really love this terminology, um. Because you

839
00:48:46.179 --> 00:48:49.580
know, the various ways that humans can learn also

840
00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.979
require many different mechanisms, I think, and this is

841
00:48:51.979 --> 00:48:54.260
not just something that I'm, you know, that I'm

842
00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:57.419
saying it's also, uh, you know, a point of

843
00:48:57.419 --> 00:49:00.179
view that's quite common in evolutionary psychology that humans

844
00:49:00.179 --> 00:49:03.580
don't have less but actually have more, um, learning

845
00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:07.659
mechanisms. So for example, humans can learn through teaching,

846
00:49:07.899 --> 00:49:11.239
right? So, um, uh, somebody who, who, who already

847
00:49:11.239 --> 00:49:14.179
knows uh how to solve a problem or make

848
00:49:14.179 --> 00:49:17.489
something. They might modify their behavior in a way

849
00:49:17.489 --> 00:49:20.959
that makes learning for other individuals, naive individuals, easier.

850
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:24.610
OK, now there's discussions about how much teaching occurs

851
00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:26.770
in different cultures and so on, but it's clear

852
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:30.610
that humans can learn through teaching and um many

853
00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:33.850
other non-human animals do not learn through teaching, but

854
00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:36.370
teaching then gives us an additional mechanism through which

855
00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:43.280
we can acquire information, right? And so, um. I

856
00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.030
am not an expert in culture, but what I

857
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:50.070
gleaned from the literature is that Most researchers think

858
00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:54.709
that cumulative culture where, you know, we transmit cultural

859
00:49:54.709 --> 00:49:58.870
skills, uh, cultural knowledge, um, and then develop innovations

860
00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:02.709
on this knowledge and then transmit the revised cultural

861
00:50:02.709 --> 00:50:04.570
knowledge and in that sense, we can, you know,

862
00:50:04.709 --> 00:50:08.590
incrementally increase the complexity of the tools we build

863
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.669
or of the languages we use or of any

864
00:50:10.669 --> 00:50:12.550
kind of thing that helps us adapt to our

865
00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:17.469
environments that cumulative culture is, you know. Either unique

866
00:50:17.469 --> 00:50:20.830
to humans or almost unique to humans. And you

867
00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:24.870
know, to my understanding in this literature, the consensus

868
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:27.629
is also that it's cumulative culture that has enabled

869
00:50:27.629 --> 00:50:33.419
humans to inhabit such extremely diverse ecologies. Right. So

870
00:50:33.419 --> 00:50:37.330
we live in freezing cold, you know, very hot,

871
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.340
uh, and, and, you know, um, with many forests

872
00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.860
or, you know, with very barren landscapes. So we

873
00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.659
live in cities, you know, we can live in

874
00:50:45.659 --> 00:50:49.719
all these types of environments, um. Yeah, because we,

875
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.679
we, we are highly phenotypically plastic. We can adjust

876
00:50:52.679 --> 00:50:56.520
to a very wide range of conditions. Yeah. Mhm.

877
00:50:57.189 --> 00:51:01.030
So, one last question or topic here. Uh, WHEN

878
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:04.739
it comes to development, I've seen and also through

879
00:51:04.739 --> 00:51:07.270
some of the interviews I've done myself, that we

880
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:10.909
can observe the use of life history theory both

881
00:51:10.909 --> 00:51:16.270
in psychology and in evolutionary biology. But are psychologists

882
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:19.949
and biologists using the term in the same way

883
00:51:19.949 --> 00:51:23.629
and are the research programs similar or not?

884
00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:30.800
Yeah. So there are similarities and differences and, and

885
00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:33.239
so let me just highlight a couple of similarities.

886
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.879
So there are similarities in some of the key

887
00:51:35.879 --> 00:51:40.300
concepts. So for example, the notion of trade-offs. Have,

888
00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.689
um, is, is, is central to, to both fields,

889
00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:48.139
and so, um, uh, you know, there are different

890
00:51:48.139 --> 00:51:51.370
types of trade-offs like resource trade-offs and functional trade-offs,

891
00:51:51.639 --> 00:51:54.120
but let me just, uh, for now, say, you

892
00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:57.419
know, the idea that um If you, you know,

893
00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:01.469
use your resources to grow a larger body, for

894
00:52:01.469 --> 00:52:04.709
example, you do not have those resources available for

895
00:52:04.709 --> 00:52:08.669
maybe, you know, producing, um, offspring quickly, uh, you

896
00:52:08.669 --> 00:52:11.850
know that those kinds of trade-offs are central to

897
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:15.949
to both um literatures. Another thing that's central to

898
00:52:15.949 --> 00:52:19.590
both literatures is a focus on life history traits.

899
00:52:19.629 --> 00:52:21.520
And so those are the traits that kind of

900
00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.709
define the life cycle of an organism. So, you

901
00:52:24.709 --> 00:52:28.350
know, the, the age at which it matures, the

902
00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:32.129
number of offspring it produces, the investments it makes

903
00:52:32.129 --> 00:52:34.629
in offspring, and, and, and so those types of

904
00:52:34.629 --> 00:52:37.989
traits are also central to to both approaches. So

905
00:52:37.989 --> 00:52:41.810
there is some common core, but They are sort

906
00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:44.770
of partially overlapping Venn diagrams, and now I'll mention

907
00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:47.090
some of the differences where the Venn diagrams are

908
00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:54.709
not overlapping. Well, so in the In the human

909
00:52:54.709 --> 00:53:01.850
literature, um. You know, it's, it's quite common to

910
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:05.989
for researchers to include what you might call kind

911
00:53:05.989 --> 00:53:10.790
of more psychological traits um into what people think

912
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:13.699
are life history strategies. So they will, for example,

913
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:17.530
argue that people who mature fast and you know,

914
00:53:17.669 --> 00:53:21.469
start reproducing at a young age. Um, THAT that's

915
00:53:21.469 --> 00:53:24.149
part of a life history strategy, sort of a

916
00:53:24.149 --> 00:53:27.629
suite of correlated responses to a particular environment, and

917
00:53:27.629 --> 00:53:30.919
that suite of responses also includes maybe risk taking

918
00:53:30.919 --> 00:53:33.070
and impulsivity to mention two of the traits that

919
00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:37.030
you asked about earlier. Um, THAT'S not the way

920
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:41.179
it's typically talked about in the evolutionary biology literature.

921
00:53:41.469 --> 00:53:44.469
OK, so this broader range of traits that's included

922
00:53:44.469 --> 00:53:48.570
in the human literature, um, that's one difference and

923
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:54.780
I think. One of the challenges of this, it's,

924
00:53:55.179 --> 00:53:58.850
you know, is is that. The, and this is

925
00:53:58.850 --> 00:54:01.919
another difference is that the theory in evolutionary biology,

926
00:54:02.139 --> 00:54:06.959
um, on which life history that framework is based

927
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:12.489
is um is often mathematically formalized. So people have

928
00:54:12.489 --> 00:54:16.810
expressed, you know, in, in equations exactly what the

929
00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:19.250
variables are, how they are thought to relate to

930
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:24.399
each other, computed under different scenarios, what natural selection,

931
00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:28.820
you know, would favor. Um, AND people have done

932
00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:32.080
this for these life history traits. OK. Now in

933
00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:37.070
the human literature. Almost no one is doing this

934
00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:39.629
mathematical modeling. There are some exceptions, but it's very

935
00:54:39.629 --> 00:54:43.709
rare, um, this mathematical modeling in humans and also

936
00:54:43.709 --> 00:54:45.989
the extent to which people draw on the mathematical

937
00:54:45.989 --> 00:54:49.080
modeling in the evolutionary biology literature is very limited

938
00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:53.409
in most cases. But then people do make claims

939
00:54:53.409 --> 00:54:55.169
about it would be adaptive for that, you know,

940
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:58.360
natural selection would favor in these types of scenarios,

941
00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:00.810
uh, not just, you know, earlier reproduction, for example,

942
00:55:00.889 --> 00:55:03.409
but also higher risk taking and more impulsivity, but

943
00:55:03.409 --> 00:55:05.860
that claim is then not based on mathematical theory.

944
00:55:07.489 --> 00:55:11.189
And so an evolutionary biologist would question that. They

945
00:55:11.189 --> 00:55:14.340
would say, you know, it could be empirically true

946
00:55:14.949 --> 00:55:18.629
that these things hang together in some or all

947
00:55:18.629 --> 00:55:21.629
human populations and if that's the case, that's interesting

948
00:55:21.629 --> 00:55:24.139
and that requires an explanation and maybe it requires

949
00:55:24.139 --> 00:55:27.310
an evolutionary explanation, maybe another type of explanation, but

950
00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:30.389
it's not a prediction from life history theory in

951
00:55:30.389 --> 00:55:32.590
so far as we view life history theory as

952
00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:35.389
a formalized body of theory in the way that

953
00:55:35.389 --> 00:55:40.100
we're using it in evolutionary biology. Um, AND so,

954
00:55:40.989 --> 00:55:43.909
uh, yeah, as a researcher, also, on the one

955
00:55:43.909 --> 00:55:49.709
hand, I'm really enthusiastic about social scientists, including psychologists,

956
00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:53.020
you know, building these bridges with, with life history,

957
00:55:53.399 --> 00:55:57.270
uh, theory. There's also uh uh sophisticated literature and

958
00:55:57.270 --> 00:56:00.300
anthropology that's that's doing this which I really appreciate.

959
00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:03.699
But I also think it's really important that the

960
00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:06.719
the kind of social scientists keep a close eye

961
00:56:06.719 --> 00:56:10.590
on uh the the formalized theory that's being developed

962
00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:14.550
in evolutionary biology and that um that we are

963
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:18.959
very explicit about when are we. Predicting something based

964
00:56:18.959 --> 00:56:21.770
on a mathematical model or which mathematical model or

965
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:25.610
under which scenarios versus, you know, here we observe

966
00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:28.750
an empirical pattern that we think potentially, you know,

967
00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:32.520
could be viewed in light of life history, um,

968
00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:35.860
in terms of life history theory. I'd like to

969
00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:37.850
say one more thing about that, if that's OK.

970
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:41.889
I think in evolutionary biology, people see life history

971
00:56:41.889 --> 00:56:46.850
theory. More as a framework. And so what is

972
00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:49.209
the difference between a theory and the framework? Um,

973
00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:51.929
THIS is a whole discussion in itself. But you

974
00:56:51.929 --> 00:56:55.290
know, you could say that, you know, a theory

975
00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:58.169
allows for, if especially if it's formalized, it allows

976
00:56:58.169 --> 00:57:03.870
for deducing predictions. Whereas a framework is more um

977
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:08.080
a description of what are the important concepts and

978
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.989
which things are, you know, related to each other.

979
00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:15.570
But how those relationships pan out, that could depend

980
00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:20.850
on the context. And so for example, um, whereas

981
00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:23.409
a psychologist, it's common in the human literature that

982
00:57:23.409 --> 00:57:25.560
people will write something like in a harsh and

983
00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:29.810
unpredictable environment, faster life history strategies are favored and

984
00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:31.850
so you know, people reproduce at a younger age

985
00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:36.360
and so on and so on. But actually the

986
00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:39.820
mathematical modeling shows that that actually depends, for example,

987
00:57:39.879 --> 00:57:43.399
at which ages this harshness causes the most mortality.

988
00:57:43.479 --> 00:57:45.199
Is that early in childhood or is it more

989
00:57:45.199 --> 00:57:48.090
in adulthood? It depends on whether the population is

990
00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:52.000
currently, you know, growing or is currently, uh, sort

991
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.899
of carrying capacity in the ecology. And, and so,

992
00:57:56.469 --> 00:57:58.939
so in biology, you would not usually read some

993
00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:01.629
general statement like this. They would say, you know,

994
00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:04.669
under these and these and these conditions, mathematical modeling

995
00:58:04.669 --> 00:58:06.469
suggests that it would be adaptive to have such

996
00:58:06.469 --> 00:58:09.229
and such life history strategy. And so it's possible

997
00:58:09.229 --> 00:58:12.909
to build within the life history framework. Specific theories

998
00:58:12.909 --> 00:58:16.389
that address particular scenarios, but it's not viewed as

999
00:58:16.389 --> 00:58:18.669
a theory that makes all these predictions in the

1000
00:58:18.669 --> 00:58:20.790
way that the human field does. So I like

1001
00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:22.909
that this bridge is being forged. I think it's

1002
00:58:22.909 --> 00:58:24.989
great that there are these bridges between the social

1003
00:58:24.989 --> 00:58:28.699
and biological sciences, but I do think there is,

1004
00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:32.510
um, you know, uh, it's important for us to

1005
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:35.030
try to build these bridges as, as best we

1006
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.379
can.

1007
00:58:36.419 --> 00:58:41.419
Mhm Great. So just before we go, Doctor Frankenhaus,

1008
00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:44.189
uh, would you like to tell people where they

1009
00:58:44.189 --> 00:58:47.060
can find you and your work on the internet?

1010
00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:51.280
Yeah, so, um, you can, you can find my

1011
00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:54.679
work, uh, you know, by, by typing it there

1012
00:58:54.679 --> 00:58:57.120
are two websites where you can, can learn more

1013
00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:00.120
about, uh, about my work. One is my, my

1014
00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.719
personal web page and so, uh, you could look

1015
00:59:02.719 --> 00:59:05.419
at Will Franken has, uh, and, and then you'll,

1016
00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:10.780
you'll find it online. Um, We talked earlier about

1017
00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:14.939
adversity and about, um, you know, trying to develop

1018
00:59:14.939 --> 00:59:17.909
an approach that is not just focusing on sort

1019
00:59:17.909 --> 00:59:20.739
of the the the struggles and potential impairments but

1020
00:59:20.739 --> 00:59:23.750
also on strength and strategies and sort of a

1021
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:26.149
more well rounded view and I'm of course not

1022
00:59:26.149 --> 00:59:29.310
the only researcher who is interested in developing such

1023
00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:33.040
an approach. um THERE are in fact. Uh, THERE'S

1024
00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:36.280
really a growing number of researchers across different fields

1025
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:39.360
of psychology, but also beyond psychology interested in doing

1026
00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:44.030
this. And so, um, with these researchers, we started,

1027
00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:46.600
uh, uh, uh, a network and the network is

1028
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:50.060
focused on science communication. OK, because we think that

1029
00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:52.219
the way that people growing up in conditions of

1030
00:59:52.219 --> 00:59:54.729
adversity, the way they are represented in the scientific

1031
00:59:54.729 --> 00:59:58.100
literature, but also in the media, um, is sometimes

1032
00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:01.530
not doing justice to the full picture. And so,

1033
01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:05.469
um. You know, there's a, a, a network now

1034
01:00:05.469 --> 01:00:10.020
which is about communicating and expanding research on adversity.

1035
01:00:10.389 --> 01:00:14.649
It's the CERA network CERA. And so if you're

1036
01:00:14.649 --> 01:00:16.760
interested in in reading about sort of the science

1037
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.389
communication aspect of how people grow up in adverse

1038
01:00:20.389 --> 01:00:22.830
environments and how we can try to do a

1039
01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:27.229
good job of of representing them, um, um. You

1040
01:00:27.229 --> 01:00:29.110
know, in, in a way that does justice to

1041
01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:31.139
the, to the complexity of their lives and the

1042
01:00:31.139 --> 01:00:35.149
nuances in their strategies and, and abilities, uh, looking

1043
01:00:35.149 --> 01:00:38.379
up this, this, this network website might be interesting,

1044
01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:40.629
and there are also some products that we're developing

1045
01:00:40.629 --> 01:00:45.090
with this network focused on this particular topic. Mhm.

1046
01:00:45.629 --> 01:00:48.270
