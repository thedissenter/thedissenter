00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.009
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.530
Center. Today I'm joined by Doctor John Hibbing. He's

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.020
the Foundation Regents University Professor of Political Science and

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.460
Psychology at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. And today

5
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.659
we're talking about his book Predisposed, the Left, the

6
00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:20.430
Right, and the Biology of Political Differences. So, Doctor

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.620
Hibbing, welcome to the show. It's a huge pleasure

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.139
to have you on.

9
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.729
Thank you, Ricardo. I'm delighted to be here.

10
00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.879
So, uh, we, I, I, I need to ask

11
00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.159
you about the left and the right, but before

12
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.680
we get into the science itself, what is, what

13
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.799
is the most common view people have of political

14
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:41.669
differences? Where do people think they stem from?

15
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.669
Well, um, uh, I've taught political science for a

16
00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:48.549
lot of years, and I frequently ask my students

17
00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.299
that. Where do you think your political views came

18
00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.630
from? And it probably won't surprise you that the

19
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.470
most common answer is my parents that, uh, the

20
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.659
kind of socialization I received as a child, uh,

21
00:00:59.669 --> 00:01:01.990
was very influential to me. Sometimes you'll hear that

22
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.779
the media, uh, was relevant, but, uh, yeah, usually

23
00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:08.029
people believe that their parents have provided the basis

24
00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:09.190
for their political beliefs.

25
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.699
Uh, BUT is there any truth to that or

26
00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:17.839
not? Well, not really, um, you know, uh, in

27
00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:19.879
fact, if you look at the evidence, it suggests

28
00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:24.120
that parental socialization is actually fairly weak, uh, certainly

29
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.120
not irrelevant, um, but it's not nearly as strong

30
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.830
as you might imagine, especially on individual issues, uh,

31
00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:32.290
you know, when you break it down to a

32
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.120
specific issue rather than a more global orientation to

33
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.430
the left or right, uh, then you see that

34
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.230
that, uh. Uh, CHILDREN are really quite dissimilar to

35
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.589
their, to their parents. So I think we, we

36
00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:45.629
tend to maybe attribute a little bit more influence

37
00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:48.180
to parents than they actually have.

38
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.949
And when it comes to the left right divide,

39
00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:57.110
how do you operationalize left and right when it

40
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.830
comes to understanding the psychology behind people who fall

41
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.589
more on one end of the spectrum than the

42
00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:05.089
other?

43
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.899
Right. Yeah, that's an easy thing to be confused

44
00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.940
about and that my hunches will probably talk more

45
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.059
about this as the the session goes on, but

46
00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:16.820
to get us started, um, I really think the

47
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.820
core differences between the left and the right have

48
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.240
to do with your attitude toward new things, uh,

49
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.899
maybe different people, maybe, uh, people coming in from

50
00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.179
outside the country, uh, how tolerant you are of

51
00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:30.660
people who break the rules, how open you are

52
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.020
to new ideas, uh, as opposed to being very

53
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.175
devoted to tradition. And protection and the way we've

54
00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:39.535
always done things so that's, uh, you know, obviously

55
00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:41.335
the, the former is more of the left, the

56
00:02:41.335 --> 00:02:43.375
latter is more the right those I think are

57
00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:46.455
the, the core things. I think maybe some of

58
00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:49.175
the confusion on this issue comes when people try

59
00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:51.804
to bring in too many things I talk about,

60
00:02:51.815 --> 00:02:55.145
um, corruption or infrastructure or even the tax code,

61
00:02:55.455 --> 00:02:57.255
uh, we, we kind of blend that into the

62
00:02:57.255 --> 00:03:00.270
left and right and. You know, sometimes that's certainly

63
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.589
true, but I think the core differences between the

64
00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:04.350
left and the right where we really need to

65
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.589
focus on those issues about orientation to others in

66
00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:10.270
groups, out groups, uh, tradition as opposed to new

67
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.679
ideas.

68
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.889
And would you expect to find these differences between

69
00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.410
left and right or even these two constructs, let's

70
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.110
say across at least all industrialized societies or yeah

71
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.130
uh that's, you know, I think when you operationalize

72
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.210
it the way I did, uh, and don't focus

73
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.529
on a specific issue like abortion or the tax

74
00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:32.889
code, uh, then I do think you can expect

75
00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.369
to see, I think we do see, um, the

76
00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:38.000
these differences between the left and the right, um,

77
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.839
pretty much the world over, not just even in

78
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.600
industrialized countries but. Um, YOU know, some of the

79
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.880
anthropologists have gone back and looked at hunter gatherer

80
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.600
societies, and they do tend to see, uh, a

81
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.600
clear difference between individuals who are very wedded to

82
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.720
the way we've always done things and those who

83
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.699
are open to new ideas and new groups, uh,

84
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.679
maybe, uh, uh, an immigrant coming from the tribe

85
00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:58.429
over the hill.

86
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.300
So let me just ask you right away a

87
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.419
question that I think many people would be interested

88
00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.539
in, interested in knowing the answer to. So why

89
00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:11.300
is it that so many times we react so

90
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.740
negatively to others, we espouse different political views, and

91
00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:19.339
why does it seem, does it seem that many

92
00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.260
times it's so hard for us to have political

93
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.980
conversations with someone holding opposing orientations?

94
00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:28.890
Yeah, yeah, that's and you're absolutely right that's a

95
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.339
core question. um, YOU know, for me, maybe this

96
00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.640
isn't surprising since I'm a political scientist, but I

97
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.839
see politics as kind of at the core of

98
00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:41.679
human existence we're very social creatures and politics, when

99
00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:44.239
you think about it, is really how to structure

100
00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:46.829
social life, how, how should our social unit look?

101
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.399
How should we be oriented to other social units?

102
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.959
How should we, you know, treat people who break

103
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:54.630
the rules and things like that so. Um, I

104
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.950
think, I think that's really something we need to

105
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.589
sort out, you know, we, we're not the fastest

106
00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:01.630
runners on the planet, we're not the strongest, we

107
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.109
don't have the sharpest claws, the best vision, but

108
00:05:04.109 --> 00:05:07.350
we are very good about organizing social units, so

109
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.029
I think this is, this is something that cuts

110
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:11.350
very close to the bone for us where we

111
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.390
feel very strongly about it. So if you have

112
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.390
a different view of how to structure a social

113
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.739
unit than I do. Uh, THAT can get me

114
00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:19.700
very upset and I, I, I think that maybe

115
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.739
that's gonna damage our social unit. That's not the

116
00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:23.980
way we should run things. So I think at

117
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.299
that level it, it becomes very important to us

118
00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:28.100
and it makes it very easy for us to

119
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.019
feel extremely strongly about political issues.

120
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.149
But do you think that perhaps there are particular

121
00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:39.109
circumstances like for example, economic and political instability that

122
00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:43.190
lead to an, to an even bigger difficulty in

123
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.869
conversing with people from the other side of the

124
00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:48.630
spectrum. I'm asking you that because particularly at the

125
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.109
present moment, more or less worldwide, it seems that

126
00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:57.220
we are going through a very big polarization, right?

127
00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:59.950
Yeah, and you know, yeah, I, I would guess,

128
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.950
I would say. That part of the reason for

129
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.279
that is I think a lot of the issues

130
00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.989
that we are debating do involve these core issues

131
00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:08.750
of identity in groups and out groups um you

132
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.589
know we got a lot of of uh movement

133
00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:14.029
of peoples around the world today, um, uh, from

134
00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:15.950
the south to the north and otherwise so I

135
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.470
think when those are the key issues that's when

136
00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:21.109
we really do get uh a danger of of

137
00:06:21.109 --> 00:06:23.029
there being blood on the streets if you will,

138
00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:26.109
politically, uh, I think if we argued about infrastructure

139
00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:28.839
or whether the government should be centered. In the,

140
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.649
the nation's capital or in the regions, you know,

141
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.329
those are issues we can deal with a little

142
00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:35.609
bit more easily, but when the issues are, uh,

143
00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:39.369
immigration, defense, protection, uh, in groups and out groups,

144
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.850
then I think uh the, the feelings get uh

145
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.739
overly intense.

146
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.209
And when it comes to differences in political orientation,

147
00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:53.470
are they different in nature from, for example, differences

148
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.390
in tastes in art, humor, food, and so on?

149
00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:02.350
Uh, YEAH, let me maybe answer that with two

150
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.399
different threads, um. On the one hand, I, you

151
00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:08.410
know, I think these tastes in food and art

152
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.720
and humor, uh, and tastes in politics, uh, they

153
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.829
can kind of all go together, um, we, uh,

154
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.760
back to this notion of how you're oriented toward

155
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.920
new things or old things, um, you know, it

156
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.640
might not surprise you to learn that people who

157
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.880
are conservative politically, people who are on the right.

158
00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:29.010
Uh, TEND to like art that is very traditional,

159
00:07:29.299 --> 00:07:32.489
uh, and realistic, whereas, uh, people on the left

160
00:07:32.489 --> 00:07:35.100
are more open to art that is, uh, avant-garde

161
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.339
or, uh, abstract, um, so I think we need

162
00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:40.630
to view politics as part of this larger package

163
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.579
of who we are psychologically, um, socially, and like

164
00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:46.160
a taste in food and art and humor and

165
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.179
whatever it might be. So in that sense they're

166
00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:51.670
part of the package. However, uh, I do think,

167
00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:53.640
uh, the, the kind of thrust of your question

168
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.679
is probably right in that there's something different about

169
00:07:56.679 --> 00:07:59.839
politics. Um, YOU know, it's, it's one thing if

170
00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:02.679
you like abstract art and I like realism in

171
00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:05.459
art. That's fine. That doesn't really impinge me. I

172
00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:07.130
don't have to watch the art that you do,

173
00:08:07.459 --> 00:08:10.220
but with politics we're making policies for an entire

174
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.859
social unit for a country if you will, and

175
00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:15.299
so therefore your views become very relevant. They could

176
00:08:15.299 --> 00:08:17.429
impinge upon me in a way that they don't

177
00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:20.380
impinge upon me, you know, if you like meat

178
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.130
and I don't you know that that that's fine,

179
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.579
but when we make politics for the unit and

180
00:08:24.579 --> 00:08:26.820
these these global policies, then I think it becomes

181
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:27.579
more contentious.

182
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.250
And when it comes to uh the basis of

183
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.000
our political preferences, let's say, do you think that

184
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.919
they have an evolutionary basis to them? And if

185
00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:43.239
so, what would have led to the evolution of

186
00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:44.119
these differences?

187
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.349
Right, yes, um, uh, I do think that I,

188
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.840
I am not an evolutionary psychologist, but I do

189
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.880
think looking to evolution for insights is a very

190
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.719
useful thing. And I think in this case, um,

191
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.409
back to my comments about Social units being essential

192
00:09:01.409 --> 00:09:03.049
to who we are as humans, that's that's been

193
00:09:03.049 --> 00:09:06.330
something that's that's uh crucial to us for a

194
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.859
long long time really probably since before we were

195
00:09:08.859 --> 00:09:12.150
humans so we had to make decisions about how

196
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.049
the social unit should be structured so I think

197
00:09:14.049 --> 00:09:16.309
we've we've been debating these issues for a long

198
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.729
long time um and I think that's why politics

199
00:09:19.729 --> 00:09:21.890
is uh is central and I think if you

200
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.010
view it in those kinds of terms it's helpful

201
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.250
to understand what what kinds of things did we

202
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.359
need to decide about the social unit. Um, WAY

203
00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:31.760
back when, and it's surprising how similar they are

204
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.159
today. And my hunches, uh, we'll, we'll talk about

205
00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:35.919
a few of these as the sessions go on.

206
00:09:36.349 --> 00:09:36.409
Mhm.

207
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.039
So at the sort of point in your book,

208
00:09:39.049 --> 00:09:43.349
you talk about 5 bedrock social dilemmas that distinguish

209
00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:45.440
the left from the right. I think that you've

210
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.440
already mentioned some of these, but they include degree

211
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.159
of adherence to traditional values slash moral codes. The

212
00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:55.590
second one treatment of our group slash rule. Breakers

213
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.559
number 3, the role of group slash individual number

214
00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:02.799
4, authority and leadership and number 5, redistribution and

215
00:10:02.799 --> 00:10:05.679
egalitarianism. Would you like to perhaps tell us a

216
00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:08.799
little bit about these social dilemmas or why is

217
00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:11.760
it these 5 that you think are the most

218
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.390
important here?

219
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.679
Well, yeah, I, I, you know, I'm sure there

220
00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:18.039
are others that we could bring in but it

221
00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:20.280
seemed to me those are 5 good illustrations of

222
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.239
the kinds of things that we needed to decide

223
00:10:22.239 --> 00:10:26.799
as uh as social creatures, um, um, we needed

224
00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:28.440
to think about things like how is our social

225
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.320
unit gonna be led, uh, are we going to

226
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.039
have a leader or are we gonna have a

227
00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:34.799
very decentralized kind of thing. Uh, WHAT should we

228
00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:37.359
do about punishing people who break the rules? Should

229
00:10:37.359 --> 00:10:40.039
they be, uh, ostracized from the group, thrown out,

230
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.640
banished, uh, put to death, uh, put in stocks,

231
00:10:43.659 --> 00:10:45.479
you know, we have lots of options, or should

232
00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:47.469
we just say, you know, you're a naughty person,

233
00:10:47.599 --> 00:10:50.559
don't do that again, um, what about the, the

234
00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:52.679
tribe over the hill? How should we orient ourselves

235
00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:56.469
to, to, uh, outsiders? Should we welcome them? It's

236
00:10:56.469 --> 00:10:58.349
it's kind of interesting. A lot of anthropologists these

237
00:10:58.349 --> 00:11:00.270
days are coming around to the idea that even

238
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.989
in hunter gatherer societies there was always a little

239
00:11:02.989 --> 00:11:05.659
bit more migration from one group to the other,

240
00:11:05.989 --> 00:11:08.559
uh, than we might have thought. So, um, you

241
00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:11.109
know, some individuals might say that's a good thing,

242
00:11:11.479 --> 00:11:16.190
uh, it provides variety, new ideas, um. Diversity of

243
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.429
the gene pool even uh others might say, oh

244
00:11:18.429 --> 00:11:20.190
my God, you know that that we can't have

245
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.950
these people who are not like us as a

246
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.039
threat to the way we've always done things, um,

247
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.599
so those kinds of things are very important. Um,

248
00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:30.880
HOW to distribute resources, you know, if, if you're

249
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.090
a hunter and come home with, with a kill,

250
00:11:33.479 --> 00:11:34.719
do you get to keep it or should that

251
00:11:34.719 --> 00:11:37.760
be distributed across the village? Uh, IT seemed just

252
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.000
to us like those are some pretty essential things

253
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.200
that any group would need to decide, and that's

254
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.080
why we refer to them as bedrock dilemmas, things

255
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.950
that that really do need to be sorted through.

256
00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:48.109
And there are people who differ on that. There's,

257
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.119
you know, people on one side of authority, they

258
00:11:51.119 --> 00:11:53.320
want a strong leader and other people say no,

259
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.320
that leader might get too powerful and abuse us

260
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.559
and be more dangerous than why we had the

261
00:11:57.559 --> 00:11:58.950
leader to protect us in the first place.

262
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:05.119
But since we're talking here mostly about predispositions, namely

263
00:12:05.119 --> 00:12:10.669
psychological predispositions, where, what is a predisposition exactly? What

264
00:12:10.669 --> 00:12:13.710
does it mean to say that someone is predisposed

265
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.000
to a particular kind of behavior toward particular kinds

266
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
of preferences and things like that?

267
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.349
I guess to me that just means that we

268
00:12:21.349 --> 00:12:25.599
have tendencies inside us that exist prior to any

269
00:12:25.599 --> 00:12:29.840
given situation so you know maybe you are somebody

270
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.049
who uh is suspicious of out groups and immigrants

271
00:12:33.049 --> 00:12:36.960
and therefore a situation arises and then boom your

272
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.119
predisposition kind of kicks into gear very readily that's

273
00:12:40.119 --> 00:12:41.909
not to say there might be something that could

274
00:12:41.909 --> 00:12:45.659
change your views. Um, BUT it, it probably takes

275
00:12:45.659 --> 00:12:48.979
a lot to change those views, whereas your predisposition

276
00:12:48.979 --> 00:12:52.140
leads you in a certain direction, um, uh, more

277
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.500
readily than if you weren't predisposed that way. So

278
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.580
yeah, I guess my answer would be some kind

279
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.820
of tendency that exists before a particular situation arises

280
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.169
that would be a predisposition.

281
00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:07.429
Right. So there are political scientists and political psychologists

282
00:13:07.429 --> 00:13:13.590
who approach uh political differences starting from personal personality

283
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.549
traits and trying to understand if particular sets of

284
00:13:16.549 --> 00:13:20.429
personality traits predispose people to being more on the

285
00:13:20.429 --> 00:13:22.830
left or on the right. Is there a link

286
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.229
there really between personality and political views?

287
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.330
I think there is, um, uh, without going into

288
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.010
this too deeply, you probably know that uh psychologists

289
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.090
tend to organize personality around five traits, uh, openness

290
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:46.210
to new experiences, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. So

291
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.049
those are the, the five famous ones, and, uh,

292
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.400
there've been a lot of studies that have tried

293
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.729
to see if that correlates with political views or

294
00:13:52.729 --> 00:13:55.359
people on the left this way or that way.

295
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.700
Really on most of the, the personality traits we

296
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.539
don't find much of a relationship, especially on neuroticism,

297
00:14:01.729 --> 00:14:06.739
agreeableness, and extroversion, you know, uh uh a liberalist,

298
00:14:06.869 --> 00:14:08.659
uh, people person on the left is as likely

299
00:14:08.659 --> 00:14:11.909
to be an extrovert or a neuroticism, a neuroticist

300
00:14:11.909 --> 00:14:15.299
as uh somebody on the right, um, we do

301
00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:17.859
see a lot more difference though with regard to

302
00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:20.289
the trait of openness, uh, and I think that

303
00:14:20.289 --> 00:14:21.580
fits with some of the things we were talking

304
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.799
about just a minute ago. Being open to new

305
00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:26.510
experiences, not surprisingly people on the left tend to

306
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.150
be a little bit more open to new experiences

307
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.549
so there's been a fairly strong correlation there um

308
00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:33.619
in a variety of countries it's not just in

309
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.950
in developed countries but around the world we tend

310
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.750
to see that some people have found a slight

311
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.349
relationship with conscientiousness that people on the right are

312
00:14:41.349 --> 00:14:44.270
a little bit more conscientious that one's not nearly

313
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.909
as strong and and it may be a little

314
00:14:45.909 --> 00:14:49.369
bit more debated. Um, SO I guess my, sorry

315
00:14:49.369 --> 00:14:51.539
for the, the long answer, but the short of

316
00:14:51.539 --> 00:14:53.609
it would be that yes, uh, especially on the

317
00:14:53.609 --> 00:14:55.729
trait of openness, we do see a correlation between

318
00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:57.289
personality traits and politics.

319
00:14:57.989 --> 00:15:01.640
But in this particular case, the correlation between personality

320
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.869
traits and political views, would it be a causal

321
00:15:05.869 --> 00:15:10.750
relationship that is, would people who have certain particular

322
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:15.789
kinds of uh psychological personality traits be predisposed or,

323
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.869
or that would cause them to prefer uh views

324
00:15:19.869 --> 00:15:22.309
from the right side or the left, the left

325
00:15:22.309 --> 00:15:24.030
side of the political aisle or?

326
00:15:24.539 --> 00:15:28.419
Yes, great question and um not surprisingly that's a

327
00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:30.250
very difficult one to study. People have tried to

328
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.719
tease that out, which comes first politics or personality,

329
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.169
um, and I don't think we've got a satisfactory

330
00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:39.450
answer to that. uh, I guess I'm a little

331
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.049
bit less concerned with which comes first and uh

332
00:15:43.049 --> 00:15:46.340
to me. Um, THEY'RE all kind of part of

333
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.179
this big ball of wax which is who we

334
00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:51.289
are, um, so you've got your, your political orientation,

335
00:15:51.419 --> 00:15:55.020
your personality orientation, your taste in food and art

336
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.419
like we talked about before, uh, I think that's

337
00:15:57.419 --> 00:15:59.059
just part of who we are and then that

338
00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:02.260
kind of branches off into these different areas of

339
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.940
life including politics. So, um, uh, I hope that

340
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.460
doesn't sound like a cop out but I think

341
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.500
maybe we don't need to, to identify exactly what

342
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.130
comes first to me. Being open to new experiences

343
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.530
that that's kind of it's a personality trait but

344
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.250
it's also something that is almost political if you

345
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.090
believe in politics as this organization of social life

346
00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:21.719
as I do.

347
00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:26.780
So that's about personality traits, but then we also

348
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.640
have moral foundations theory developed by people like Jonathan

349
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.159
Haidt and others. What do you make of it?

350
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.440
Do you think that there's something to that kind

351
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:41.679
of research linking certain moral foundations with uh with

352
00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:43.320
the political orientations?

353
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.729
I do, yeah, uh, just as was the case

354
00:16:46.729 --> 00:16:49.419
with personality, I think, I think, uh, moral foundations

355
00:16:49.419 --> 00:16:51.900
is very helpful to think about kind of what,

356
00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:56.380
what moral preferences and, and issues tend to drive

357
00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.700
you more than others. So, again, without going into

358
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.500
too much detail, you probably know that uh height

359
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.339
specifies five moral foundations harm avoidance, um, justice slash

360
00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:12.689
equality. And there's authority and in-group outgroup and uh

361
00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:15.608
loyalty, loyalty authority in-group outgroup, yeah,

362
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.489
so and also purity I

363
00:17:18.489 --> 00:17:20.300
think purity, that's right, yeah, thank you. You're right,

364
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:24.739
yeah, um. So the issues like purity and loyalty

365
00:17:24.739 --> 00:17:27.618
authority and in group out group, um, those tend

366
00:17:27.618 --> 00:17:28.739
to show up a little bit more on the

367
00:17:28.739 --> 00:17:30.979
right side of the political spectrum as I think

368
00:17:30.979 --> 00:17:33.579
this fits with what we've been talking about, whereas

369
00:17:33.579 --> 00:17:34.859
people on the left tend to be a little

370
00:17:34.859 --> 00:17:38.369
bit more concerned with with harm avoidance and um

371
00:17:38.619 --> 00:17:40.939
equality or or or justice so I think there's

372
00:17:40.939 --> 00:17:45.439
a relationship there, um. My colleagues and I have

373
00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:47.920
done some analysis of the extent to which moral

374
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.520
foundations are heritable, and there we were a little

375
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.280
bit surprised to find that that they're not as

376
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.489
heritable as some of the political straight up political

377
00:17:54.489 --> 00:17:57.199
views so in that sense I I think maybe

378
00:17:57.199 --> 00:17:59.390
there might be something a little bit more foundational

379
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.920
about political orientation and moral foundations but um you

380
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.000
know I'm a big fan of the work of

381
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.550
Jonathan Haidt and I think uh I think uh

382
00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.400
thinking about moral foundations is certainly useful and very

383
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.469
relevant to politics.

384
00:18:12.189 --> 00:18:15.489
And one of the things associated with moral foundations

385
00:18:15.489 --> 00:18:18.089
is that at a certain point height and these

386
00:18:18.089 --> 00:18:23.290
collaborators added 6th moral foundation that is liberty, and

387
00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.569
they connected it to people who identify as being

388
00:18:26.569 --> 00:18:29.515
libertarian. Do you think that the kind of approach

389
00:18:29.515 --> 00:18:31.875
that you present in your book would also account

390
00:18:31.875 --> 00:18:37.025
for people across other dimensions, like, for example, or

391
00:18:37.025 --> 00:18:40.984
across other spectrums, like, for example, the authoritarian libertarian

392
00:18:40.984 --> 00:18:44.314
spectrum or is it just for the left right

393
00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:44.875
divide?

394
00:18:46.099 --> 00:18:50.369
Yeah, um. You know, I think libertarians are very

395
00:18:50.369 --> 00:18:53.839
interesting and and uh. I'm not sure we can

396
00:18:53.839 --> 00:18:55.880
place them clearly on the left or the right,

397
00:18:56.239 --> 00:18:58.479
um, you know, that this desire for liberty right

398
00:18:58.479 --> 00:19:00.869
now in the United States we're having a political

399
00:19:00.869 --> 00:19:03.119
campaign, you know, and, and the candidate on the

400
00:19:03.119 --> 00:19:05.760
left, Kamala Harris is very supportive of reproductive rights,

401
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.839
so she talks a lot about liberty. We don't

402
00:19:07.839 --> 00:19:10.040
want the government telling us how to run our

403
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.959
lives, what decisions to make with regard to reproduction,

404
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.640
um, so that sounds libertarian, but then of course

405
00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.250
many things that Donald Trump on the right. Uh,

406
00:19:18.339 --> 00:19:22.459
SAYS, uh, echo these libertarian tendencies about, you know,

407
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.369
the right to bear arms and, and things like

408
00:19:24.369 --> 00:19:28.989
that. So I think, um. I think libertarianism and

409
00:19:28.989 --> 00:19:31.819
authority is not quite as as much cutting to

410
00:19:31.819 --> 00:19:34.180
the core of these issues as the in group

411
00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.739
out group kinds of things are and that that's

412
00:19:35.739 --> 00:19:38.099
something we can talk about but certainly uh others

413
00:19:38.099 --> 00:19:40.219
would disagree with me on that but uh I

414
00:19:40.219 --> 00:19:42.699
think it's it's relevant but I don't think it's

415
00:19:42.699 --> 00:19:44.300
really at the center of things. I think a

416
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.180
lot of people. You know, they, they want liberty

417
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.150
or authority, depending on what the issues are that

418
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.910
are being advocated. So, um, and that says to

419
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.640
me that it's those issues that are really at

420
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.829
the core rather than how we get there.

421
00:19:58.189 --> 00:20:00.959
Mhm. Yeah, that's a great point. So, uh, but

422
00:20:00.959 --> 00:20:04.599
now a question that is even more basic, let's

423
00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:07.439
say, in terms of the science, the neuroscience and

424
00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:11.760
the cognitive science, particularly, are there also differences in

425
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.579
perception between the left and the right?

426
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.959
Um, HOW do you mean that, that, that, uh,

427
00:20:17.979 --> 00:20:19.339
people on the left, the people on the right

428
00:20:19.339 --> 00:20:24.530
see the world differently? Yes, OK, yeah, um, yeah,

429
00:20:24.579 --> 00:20:26.699
there are, um, there are all kinds of differences

430
00:20:26.699 --> 00:20:29.579
so that we've found in, uh, kind of how

431
00:20:29.579 --> 00:20:31.380
people look at the world and what they see

432
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.420
when they look out at the world. Um, THERE'S

433
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.060
one study we've done where we show uh a

434
00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.699
computer screen filled with lots of faces, and these

435
00:20:39.699 --> 00:20:41.420
faces are all of the same person with the

436
00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.140
same expression. Except one, and then that's the same

437
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.060
person, but he or she has either a happy

438
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.500
or an angry expression. They call that an an

439
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.979
oddball uh figure because all the rest are the

440
00:20:52.979 --> 00:20:55.219
same. So then we just ask people when this

441
00:20:55.219 --> 00:20:58.459
comes on the screen, uh, how, you know, press

442
00:20:58.459 --> 00:21:00.569
the space bar as soon as you spot that

443
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.650
face that's different than the others. Um, SO, uh,

444
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.020
and it's kind of interesting, uh, uh, people who

445
00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.170
are on the political right tend to be faster

446
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:14.109
when that expression is angry. People on the left

447
00:21:14.109 --> 00:21:16.000
tend to be faster to hit the space bar

448
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.420
when it's a happy face. So that to me

449
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.430
says that there are these kinds of differences in,

450
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.699
in kind of, uh, people's sensitivities to different aspects

451
00:21:24.699 --> 00:21:27.219
of the world. uh, SO I think when people

452
00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:28.819
look out at the world they see very different

453
00:21:28.819 --> 00:21:32.660
things. Um, YOU know, maybe you're highly attuned to

454
00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.010
angry faces because you're a little bit worried about,

455
00:21:35.339 --> 00:21:37.599
uh, about being threatened by another human being who's

456
00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:39.260
a bad guy with a gun or something like

457
00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.250
that, or maybe you're, you just like happy people,

458
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.939
um, and, and therefore you're oriented to that. So

459
00:21:44.939 --> 00:21:47.540
I do think there is, uh, there are these

460
00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.030
differences, and I think we have been able to

461
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.609
identify them with, with a variety of political studies.

462
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.489
Mhm. So one particular difference that you talk about

463
00:21:55.489 --> 00:21:58.290
in your book has to do with how people

464
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.650
respond to potential threats. So, uh what is the

465
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.609
difference there in that domain between people on the

466
00:22:04.609 --> 00:22:06.410
left and people on the right?

467
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.209
Yeah, here I think um the book actually just

468
00:22:11.209 --> 00:22:13.650
came out in a 2nd edition and uh it's,

469
00:22:13.689 --> 00:22:16.050
it's very similar to the 1st, except on this

470
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.979
issue, I think we've shifted a little bit. Um,

471
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.729
I think in the first edition we were maybe

472
00:22:20.729 --> 00:22:23.260
too broad and we said, well, conservatives tend to

473
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.180
be a little bit more uh prone to be

474
00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.579
threatened and therefore they want protection, they want a

475
00:22:28.579 --> 00:22:33.849
strong military, uh, strong police, strong defense, um, in

476
00:22:33.849 --> 00:22:35.939
the United States, the right to bear arms, uh,

477
00:22:35.979 --> 00:22:37.780
so you know whatever it is it's going to

478
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.619
protect us, they, they tend to like, um. In

479
00:22:41.619 --> 00:22:43.540
the second edition I think we focused a little

480
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.380
bit more specifically and appropriately on threats from other

481
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.619
human beings. I don't think it's the case that

482
00:22:48.619 --> 00:22:50.819
people on the political right are just more worried

483
00:22:50.819 --> 00:22:53.260
about any kind of threat. Uh, WE saw that

484
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.260
I think with regard to COVID. Uh, I don't

485
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.869
know about Portugal, but you know it's actually the

486
00:22:56.869 --> 00:22:58.260
case in the United States that people on the

487
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.939
right were a little bit more cavalier uh, they

488
00:23:00.939 --> 00:23:03.219
didn't want all these steps to be taken to

489
00:23:03.219 --> 00:23:05.739
mitigate the the danger of COVID so I think

490
00:23:05.739 --> 00:23:08.650
the way people react to, you know, a germ,

491
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:12.560
uh, as opposed to. Uh, A, a criminal, uh,

492
00:23:12.569 --> 00:23:14.369
are very different things, and I think it's the

493
00:23:14.849 --> 00:23:17.390
throughout evolutionary history it was mostly the criminals that

494
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.010
we worried about. There wasn't anything that our hunter

495
00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.530
gatherer ancestors really could do about, um, a germ.

496
00:23:23.609 --> 00:23:26.569
They just, it happened, um, uh, but we could

497
00:23:26.569 --> 00:23:29.839
take precautions against uh a threat. Uh, BY another

498
00:23:29.839 --> 00:23:31.599
human being, so I think that's been the danger

499
00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:34.719
throughout our evolutionary past and therefore I think that's

500
00:23:34.719 --> 00:23:36.280
where we really see a difference, and I do

501
00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.400
think people on the right tend to be more

502
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.229
concerned about the threat posed by other human beings,

503
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.479
especially other human beings who are different than uh

504
00:23:44.479 --> 00:23:45.359
than the in group.

505
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.839
Do we know if there are differences in the

506
00:23:49.839 --> 00:23:52.560
brains of people on the left and the right?

507
00:23:52.589 --> 00:23:55.079
And if so, I mean, if we find the

508
00:23:55.079 --> 00:23:57.959
difference at the level of the brain, what does

509
00:23:57.959 --> 00:24:00.520
that tell us? What kind of implications does it

510
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:00.829
have?

511
00:24:02.489 --> 00:24:04.989
Yeah, there have been, um, a few studies on

512
00:24:04.989 --> 00:24:07.859
this, 4 or 5, my colleagues and I did

513
00:24:07.859 --> 00:24:10.910
one, maybe I'll start with that one, this was

514
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:12.949
led by a, a really good neuroscientist named Reed

515
00:24:12.949 --> 00:24:15.660
Montague and, uh, one of the things we found

516
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.219
was that people on the right and left differ,

517
00:24:19.589 --> 00:24:23.290
um. Sorry, let me back up a step. So,

518
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.270
uh, you have people in a, a, a brain

519
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.819
scan, uh, they call it FMRI because they're gonna

520
00:24:27.819 --> 00:24:29.780
be doing something in the brain scan. In our

521
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.579
case, they're gonna be looking at an image and

522
00:24:31.579 --> 00:24:32.869
we just wanted to see what was going on

523
00:24:32.869 --> 00:24:35.109
in the brain when people would see these images.

524
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.369
Um, MOST of the images we used were of,

525
00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.459
uh, bodies that had been damaged, mutilation if you

526
00:24:41.459 --> 00:24:44.339
will. Some of them were fairly disgusting and others

527
00:24:44.339 --> 00:24:46.979
were just, um, you know, someone had been, been

528
00:24:46.979 --> 00:24:49.479
cut. Um, AND we wanted to see what was

529
00:24:49.479 --> 00:24:50.839
going on in the brain, and one of the

530
00:24:50.839 --> 00:24:52.030
things we found there's a part of the brain

531
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.920
called somatosensory 2, and it's very active when you

532
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.839
get, uh, hurt. So if, if, uh, I would

533
00:24:58.839 --> 00:25:01.160
punch you in the nose right now, um, your

534
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.430
somatosensory too would go up because you'd be injured.

535
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.599
Um, HOWEVER, it also tends to be active when

536
00:25:07.599 --> 00:25:10.329
you see someone else get hurt. So if you

537
00:25:10.329 --> 00:25:12.849
would see a videotape of someone stepping on a

538
00:25:12.849 --> 00:25:15.640
nail or something that really was, was obviously painful,

539
00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:19.420
then your somatosensory too is, is very active. Well,

540
00:25:19.459 --> 00:25:20.859
it was kind of interesting to us that we

541
00:25:20.859 --> 00:25:23.380
found that um when we would show these images

542
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.520
of, of mutilated bodies. Um, PEOPLE on the left

543
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.359
had a very active somatosensory too, so, uh, you

544
00:25:31.359 --> 00:25:34.310
know, presumably this was a kind of empathic reaction.

545
00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:36.760
So they're saying, oh my gosh, that person was

546
00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.280
just injured. I feel sorry for them. People on

547
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.839
the right had more activation in a part of

548
00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:44.469
the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex, the ACC,

549
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.280
which tends to be involved in just identifying that

550
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.910
something was wrong, something's amiss, um, I didn't expect

551
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:52.959
that. Uh, KIND of thing, what should we do

552
00:25:52.959 --> 00:25:55.319
about it? So it was not exactly empathy but

553
00:25:55.319 --> 00:25:57.400
just, uh, I don't know how to deal with

554
00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.079
this, with this injured body. So, um, maybe that's

555
00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:02.760
too much detail, but I thought the interesting thing

556
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.589
was that we could actually make a pretty strong

557
00:26:04.589 --> 00:26:07.400
prediction, pretty accurate prediction of whether people were on

558
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.959
the left or the right politically simply on the

559
00:26:09.959 --> 00:26:14.359
basis of their neural activation patterns when viewing a

560
00:26:14.359 --> 00:26:19.500
mutilated body. Um, SO, um, that's just one example

561
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.739
of the kinds of, of, uh, brain imaging work

562
00:26:21.739 --> 00:26:25.819
that has been done, uh, politically, uh, another famous

563
00:26:25.819 --> 00:26:29.300
one, that was not done by us, uh, found

564
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.420
some differences in the amygdala, which is part of

565
00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.890
the brain, as you probably know, very active in,

566
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.410
in, uh, threatening situations or fear or anger, uh,

567
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.500
negative social situations, especially, um, and, uh, the other

568
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.339
tended to be more activation on the part of

569
00:26:43.339 --> 00:26:46.229
people on the political right. Uh, THEN the left,

570
00:26:46.569 --> 00:26:51.050
um. What else? Yes, uh, actually there was one

571
00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.569
study that that found some structural differences. What I've

572
00:26:53.569 --> 00:26:55.489
been referring to at this point are more what

573
00:26:55.489 --> 00:26:58.969
happens in a particular situation, but, um, another well

574
00:26:58.969 --> 00:27:01.650
known study found, found some basic differences in the

575
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:03.729
way that the brains looked even if they weren't

576
00:27:03.729 --> 00:27:06.920
doing anything. So these are all, you know, uh,

577
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:08.890
brain imaging studies tend to be small and there

578
00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.010
aren't a lot of cases it's difficult study to

579
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.030
do. So there's certainly room for challenging some of

580
00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.250
those results and maybe future studies will find something

581
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.750
different, but as of now, there is some indication

582
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.869
that, yeah, with regard to a few organs of

583
00:27:20.869 --> 00:27:22.790
the brain, there might be some differences between people

584
00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.219
on the left and people on the right.

585
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:29.479
So one particular psychological trait that people talk a

586
00:27:29.479 --> 00:27:32.800
lot about in recent times in regards to political

587
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.390
differences and where they stem from has to do

588
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:39.310
with this guest sensitivity. So is there a difference

589
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.479
between the left and the right there? And if

590
00:27:41.479 --> 00:27:46.119
so, uh, disgust sensitivity would connect, uh, in what

591
00:27:46.119 --> 00:27:47.469
ways to politics?

592
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.540
Yeah, um. Yeah, there's been a lot of work

593
00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.449
done on this and uh especially by Paul Bloom

594
00:27:55.449 --> 00:28:00.369
and others who found. That people with greater disgust

595
00:28:00.369 --> 00:28:03.020
sensitivity, and this is usually ascertained with a survey.

596
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:05.790
So I would ask you questions like, uh, you

597
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.069
know, would you sleep in a bed where a

598
00:28:08.069 --> 00:28:10.189
person had died the night before, even if the

599
00:28:10.189 --> 00:28:13.109
sheets had been washed, um, would you eat a

600
00:28:13.109 --> 00:28:15.270
bowl of soup that had been stirred with a

601
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.150
clean flyswatter, um, you know, just a whole bunch

602
00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.219
of questions like that, and then we, we take

603
00:28:20.219 --> 00:28:23.349
your responses to maybe a couple of dozen questions

604
00:28:23.829 --> 00:28:25.829
along those lines and, and we can say, well,

605
00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.979
yeah, Ricardo tends to be a little bit more

606
00:28:27.979 --> 00:28:31.650
sensitive to disgusting things than somebody else. Um, AND

607
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.530
then we find out your political beliefs and we

608
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.130
see if there's a correlation and it does tend

609
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.729
to be the case that people who, who register

610
00:28:37.729 --> 00:28:40.209
greater disgust sensitivity tend to be a little bit

611
00:28:40.209 --> 00:28:43.839
more toward the right, especially on some issues, uh,

612
00:28:43.849 --> 00:28:48.170
uh, issues with regard to, uh, sex, uh, sexual

613
00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.369
preferences and, and, uh, behaviors, uh, if you have

614
00:28:51.369 --> 00:28:54.109
high disgust sensitivity, then you're, uh, more likely to

615
00:28:54.109 --> 00:28:57.119
be opposed to gay marriage and and things like

616
00:28:57.119 --> 00:28:59.560
that. Um, SOME people have found it with a

617
00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.329
broader array of political views, not just those pertaining

618
00:29:02.329 --> 00:29:05.040
to, to sex, but, uh, others have, have not

619
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.890
been so sure. Um, WE'VE done a study, which

620
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.670
was a little bit of a variation on that,

621
00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:16.290
you know, um, We think surveys are really useful,

622
00:29:16.579 --> 00:29:17.979
but at the end of the day, they're what

623
00:29:17.979 --> 00:29:20.819
we call self-reports because you're just saying, here's what

624
00:29:20.819 --> 00:29:22.979
I think of that candidate, here's how I think

625
00:29:22.979 --> 00:29:25.500
I'm gonna vote. Here's where I think my views

626
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.780
came from. Well, the truth of the matter is

627
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.829
sometimes humans aren't very good at reflecting on their

628
00:29:30.829 --> 00:29:34.650
own psychological state, uh, so we might not know,

629
00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.540
um, how we respond or we might not know,

630
00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:41.339
um, where these things came from. So what we

631
00:29:41.339 --> 00:29:43.020
tried to do was we had people hooked up

632
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.650
to um a psycho uh physiological uh measurement device

633
00:29:48.079 --> 00:29:49.979
uh that would measure skin conductance and then we'd

634
00:29:49.979 --> 00:29:52.459
show them disgusting images so rather than just say.

635
00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.989
Uh, ARE you disgusted by this situation? We'd have

636
00:29:55.989 --> 00:30:00.329
you look at an image. Of, um, maybe, um,

637
00:30:00.459 --> 00:30:03.260
you know, poop on, on the floor, uh, and

638
00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.459
then we'd say we wouldn't say anything we just

639
00:30:05.459 --> 00:30:07.219
look at at how you responded to that with

640
00:30:07.219 --> 00:30:10.380
your skin conductance went up, um, and we tended

641
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.219
to find the same thing that people on the

642
00:30:12.219 --> 00:30:14.500
political right tended to be have a little bit

643
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.219
greater disgust sensitivity response in this case, not a

644
00:30:17.219 --> 00:30:21.619
survey response but an actual physiological response, um, so

645
00:30:21.619 --> 00:30:24.189
I think that that fits in a way. Um,

646
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.199
ALTHOUGH I, I have to be, uh, truth in

647
00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:29.079
advertising here, someone else, uh, repeated that study and

648
00:30:29.079 --> 00:30:31.349
did not find the results nearly as strong, so,

649
00:30:31.479 --> 00:30:33.989
you know, maybe we need to, uh, to, uh,

650
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.800
have a question mark by, by that, but at

651
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.280
least there there's some evidence that discuss gust sensitivity

652
00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.520
is a little bit greater on the part of

653
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.560
people on the political right.

654
00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.829
Isn't there a link between these guest sensitivity and

655
00:30:46.829 --> 00:30:50.640
the moral foundation of sanctity slash purity? At least

656
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.510
I remember, I vaguely remember that being referenced in

657
00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:59.030
Jonathan Haidt's Heid's book, uh, The Righteous Mind. Yes,

658
00:30:59.229 --> 00:30:59.310
no,

659
00:30:59.349 --> 00:31:01.329
you're absolutely right. I think that makes sense, doesn't

660
00:31:01.329 --> 00:31:04.430
it, that Discuss sensitivity and purity, um, you know,

661
00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:07.109
people who have a strong sense of purity also

662
00:31:07.109 --> 00:31:09.619
have a strong sense of disgust sensitivity because they

663
00:31:09.619 --> 00:31:11.849
to them purity is very important and we see

664
00:31:11.849 --> 00:31:14.390
these impure things and they're gonna react negatively to

665
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:16.150
that. So yes, you're absolutely right, good point.

666
00:31:17.209 --> 00:31:19.930
Uh, AND I, I mean, of course, one of

667
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:25.199
the ways for us to study differences across individuals

668
00:31:25.199 --> 00:31:29.459
uh is to do behavior genetic studies by studying

669
00:31:29.729 --> 00:31:33.000
uh twins, reared apart and we're together and also

670
00:31:33.209 --> 00:31:37.050
adoptive. So, what do we know from those types

671
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:42.729
of studies about the potential genetic differences between people

672
00:31:42.729 --> 00:31:44.369
on the left and people on the right?

673
00:31:44.699 --> 00:31:47.290
Yes, an important question. So, uh, there have been

674
00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:49.209
a lot of studies of this. We've done many

675
00:31:49.209 --> 00:31:53.500
ourselves, um, uh, twins are very useful in this

676
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.410
situation because they're two different types of twins, as

677
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.930
you probably know, uh, monozygotic twins, which are sometimes

678
00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:01.969
called identical twins and dizygotic, which are, are fraternal

679
00:32:01.969 --> 00:32:05.000
twins, so really no more genetically similar than a,

680
00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.239
a regular pair of siblings. So the question then

681
00:32:08.239 --> 00:32:11.280
becomes are monozygotic twins who've been reared in the

682
00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.599
same family, presumably have the same kinds of of

683
00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:17.680
influences, uh, more similar politically than dizygotic twins also

684
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.640
reared in the same family, um, so you'd expect

685
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.920
a fairly similar, you know, environmental influences, um, and

686
00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.280
the results, uh, always show that there is a

687
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.920
greater similarity with MZ twins, so, um, that can

688
00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.079
generate the conclusion then that yes there is a

689
00:32:33.079 --> 00:32:36.270
genetic aspect to politics. I always like to add

690
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:39.920
though, people, there's something about genetics that encourages people

691
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.319
to get carried away, I think so and, and

692
00:32:42.319 --> 00:32:43.880
as soon as you mention genetics I say oh

693
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.310
my God, then, uh, you know, everything must come

694
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:49.829
from from genes. It's clearly not the case. um

695
00:32:50.109 --> 00:32:53.640
um I just saw one recent uh meta-analysis where

696
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.880
they're, you know, combining lots of different studies of

697
00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:00.380
behavioral genetics. With twins and uh they estimate I

698
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.329
forget the exact number, but it was about uh

699
00:33:02.449 --> 00:33:06.130
uh 0.3 out of 1.0 so in other words,

700
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:11.530
maybe uh 30% of our variation in political views

701
00:33:11.819 --> 00:33:15.380
could be derived from genetics, um, but of course

702
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.089
if 30% come from genetics that leaves 70% to

703
00:33:18.089 --> 00:33:20.180
come from the environment so I just wanted to

704
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.459
make sure that you know your listeners don't think

705
00:33:22.459 --> 00:33:24.979
I'm claiming something I'm not uh, the environment is

706
00:33:24.979 --> 00:33:29.170
still crucial. Um, I guess what. When we first

707
00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.209
started doing this research though, a lot of political

708
00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:35.239
scientists were not very happy, uh, we're, we're surprised,

709
00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:39.890
we're dubious, um, and, um, you know, because they

710
00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.729
tend to believe that 100% of our political beliefs

711
00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:46.790
come from the environment. And um you know I

712
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.550
just think because they think politics is so special,

713
00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:52.750
so uniquely human, uh, that we we only learn

714
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.189
it from our parents, from the media, from a

715
00:33:55.189 --> 00:33:58.219
clergy person, from whatever from our teachers and professors,

716
00:33:58.729 --> 00:34:01.069
um, so that that tends to be the common

717
00:34:01.069 --> 00:34:03.530
view and our view is that certainly we're not

718
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:06.030
denigrating the importance of the environment, but we do

719
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:09.590
think that behavioral genetics research shows fairly clearly that

720
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.550
uh genes do have some role even if it's

721
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.188
a role that's not quite as strong as the

722
00:34:13.188 --> 00:34:13.590
environment.

723
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.000
But since you mentioned the environment there, what kinds

724
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.409
of environmental factors have been studied in terms of

725
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:24.969
the ones that would have an effect in how

726
00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:28.129
people develop their political views?

727
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.399
Yeah, I think it's it's the usuals, um, you

728
00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:36.618
know, the, the parents and, and, uh. Uh, YOUR

729
00:34:36.618 --> 00:34:38.739
peers are, are clearly very important to those kinds

730
00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:40.978
of things. What kinds of experiences you've had. Did

731
00:34:40.978 --> 00:34:43.339
you grow up in a comfortable neighborhood or a

732
00:34:43.339 --> 00:34:46.378
threatening one? Uh, I hope this is not too

733
00:34:46.378 --> 00:34:49.820
far off track, but I, um, My colleagues and

734
00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.379
I had a project that we were very excited

735
00:34:51.379 --> 00:34:54.978
about, um, and that was to uh engage in

736
00:34:54.978 --> 00:35:00.899
a study called, um. Uh, DISCORDANT monozygotic twins. And

737
00:35:00.899 --> 00:35:04.000
what that means is, uh, yes, most monozygotic twins

738
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.979
are similar politically, um. But that doesn't mean they

739
00:35:07.979 --> 00:35:09.540
all are and so what we wanted to do

740
00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.060
was find those those instances in which a pair

741
00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.699
of so-called identical twins who've been reared in the

742
00:35:14.699 --> 00:35:17.780
same environment with the same parents, etc. uh, HAD

743
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.500
different political views. We thought it would be very

744
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.889
useful to really bore in and try to find

745
00:35:21.889 --> 00:35:24.659
out exactly what, you know, what was different in

746
00:35:24.659 --> 00:35:29.270
their experiences. um, UNFORTUNATELY, even though the reviewers really

747
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.300
liked that study, we, we didn't get the money

748
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.919
to do it. Um, SO you know that that

749
00:35:33.919 --> 00:35:35.439
always pained me because I thought I, I would

750
00:35:35.439 --> 00:35:36.879
be in a position to give a much better

751
00:35:36.879 --> 00:35:38.919
answer to your question if we could have had

752
00:35:38.919 --> 00:35:40.800
a study like that because it, it controls for

753
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.639
the environment in a way and, and also the

754
00:35:42.639 --> 00:35:44.750
genetics and then to see what might have been

755
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:47.159
important but you know, presumably things can happen in

756
00:35:47.159 --> 00:35:49.370
the world and, and these can affect your political

757
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.469
beliefs maybe you. You, uh, witnessed a robbery, uh,

758
00:35:53.479 --> 00:35:55.520
at a crucial age and that really affected you

759
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.520
and it led you to want to have a

760
00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.239
strong police force or maybe you saw an immigrant

761
00:36:00.239 --> 00:36:03.320
suffering and that affected you so you know, clearly

762
00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.439
these kinds of things can matter obviously today we've

763
00:36:05.439 --> 00:36:08.000
got the media and social media that have tremendous

764
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.040
influence on things, um, although I do like to

765
00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.320
point out that, you know, um, if you are

766
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.600
one of those individuals who loves to watch conservative

767
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.870
or or right wing. Uh, SOCIAL outlets or media

768
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.350
outlets, uh, it may be that you had that

769
00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:26.750
predisposition before, um, you know, in the United States

770
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:28.350
we talked a lot about Fox News. I'm sure

771
00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:30.750
you've heard about this, and, uh, but I think

772
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:31.830
a lot of the people who tend to watch

773
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:35.510
Fox News, uh, tended to have this predisposition before

774
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:38.610
they started watching and then they get reinforced, um,

775
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.879
there's no doubt about that, it's important, but I'm

776
00:36:40.879 --> 00:36:42.949
not sure it's the initial cause of those things.

777
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:44.350
I think for that we might need to look

778
00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:46.100
back at some things like genetics.

779
00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:50.149
Right. And another very interesting thing about how people

780
00:36:50.149 --> 00:36:54.149
react to, for example, this behavior genetic studies is

781
00:36:54.149 --> 00:36:59.340
that apparently there are differences in who accepts biological

782
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:03.909
differences or predispositions between individuals when it comes to

783
00:37:03.909 --> 00:37:07.870
explaining how they differ in terms of their political

784
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.669
orientations, right? I mean, there are some people who

785
00:37:10.669 --> 00:37:12.750
accept it more than others.

786
00:37:13.219 --> 00:37:16.840
Yeah, no, that's, that's true, um, and I, I

787
00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.280
also think that's changed over time. Uh, WHEN I

788
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.879
first started talking about these these ideas maybe 20

789
00:37:21.879 --> 00:37:24.520
years ago, at least in my classroom students were

790
00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.879
very suspicious and reluctant to believe that, you know,

791
00:37:27.959 --> 00:37:29.989
the notion that genetics could be involved in politics,

792
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:35.149
I just struck them as really odd, um. And

793
00:37:35.149 --> 00:37:38.909
but you know, recently in my classrooms, uh, and

794
00:37:38.909 --> 00:37:41.070
even some of the talks I've given to non-students,

795
00:37:41.229 --> 00:37:42.550
there's a little bit more acceptance. I don't know

796
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:45.229
if it's because of 23andMe and you know people

797
00:37:45.229 --> 00:37:47.830
have just found out that, uh, genetics are relevant

798
00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:51.949
to personality and, and, uh, you know, some of

799
00:37:51.949 --> 00:37:54.820
the, uh, uh, disabilities that that we talk about,

800
00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.709
but there's a a more ready ready acceptance I

801
00:37:57.709 --> 00:38:00.260
think these days, but you're right, still not everybody

802
00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.510
and uh these. Uh, I know from experience that

803
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.669
these kinds of studies can, can generate some very

804
00:38:06.669 --> 00:38:09.419
strong feelings. Some people just don't like the idea,

805
00:38:09.979 --> 00:38:12.629
um, that maybe genetics have to do with our

806
00:38:12.629 --> 00:38:14.469
politics. They want us to be able to control

807
00:38:14.469 --> 00:38:18.870
everything, um, so yeah, I, I'm not sure how

808
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:20.629
it breaks down. We've, we've got a lot of

809
00:38:20.629 --> 00:38:23.669
criticism both from the right and the left, um.

810
00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:25.830
You know, it used to be that people on

811
00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:27.590
the right would say well these are just some

812
00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:30.189
academics who are on the left and they're trying

813
00:38:30.189 --> 00:38:32.870
to make conservatives, people on the right look bad

814
00:38:33.189 --> 00:38:35.270
or look like they're genetically flawed or something like

815
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.790
that but then also people on the left, you

816
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:40.409
know, uh, frequently would say things like, well, no,

817
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.790
uh, you know we think people are malleable we

818
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:44.629
can, we can adjust them and and help them

819
00:38:44.629 --> 00:38:46.790
and fix them we just need a government program,

820
00:38:47.169 --> 00:38:48.790
uh, to do that and it doesn't really have

821
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.340
anything to do with genetics so. Uh, AT times

822
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.939
we felt kind of beleaguered because we would, we

823
00:38:53.939 --> 00:38:56.489
would get, uh, criticized both from the left, uh,

824
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.229
and the right, uh, but I do think, uh,

825
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.570
as Nick Jagger said, time is on our side,

826
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.209
uh, I think as the years go on, uh,

827
00:39:04.219 --> 00:39:06.580
we do see a little bit more support for

828
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.699
this notion that that genetics are involved as long

829
00:39:08.699 --> 00:39:11.179
as we can keep them in perspective, help people

830
00:39:11.179 --> 00:39:13.500
realize, I think you know the old kind of

831
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.820
Mendelian view of genetics was that there's just one

832
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.449
gene. That affects you know whether your pee is

833
00:39:19.449 --> 00:39:22.939
purple or white or whether you're um you know

834
00:39:22.939 --> 00:39:26.080
um politics are left or right um so if

835
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.459
we can help people understand that that's not how

836
00:39:28.459 --> 00:39:31.179
genetics works and there are incredible number of genes

837
00:39:31.179 --> 00:39:33.330
that all interact with the environment and then you've

838
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.060
got epigenetics which we're not even talking about um

839
00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.419
you know all these things go in so I

840
00:39:37.419 --> 00:39:39.939
think the more people understand the richness of genetics.

841
00:39:40.489 --> 00:39:43.469
The easier it is for them to understand that

842
00:39:43.469 --> 00:39:46.830
politics, like almost every other aspect of life, could

843
00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.919
in fact be influenced in part by genetics.

844
00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.520
By the way, do we, do you have any

845
00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:57.310
idea if when it comes to, uh, accepting biological

846
00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:00.959
differences, there's also a difference between people on the

847
00:40:00.959 --> 00:40:04.199
left and the right, because, uh, sometimes, uh, or

848
00:40:04.199 --> 00:40:07.439
some people tend to have this sort of stereotype

849
00:40:07.439 --> 00:40:09.919
where they think that people on the right would

850
00:40:09.919 --> 00:40:14.965
more easily. Accept that there's biological differences in explaining

851
00:40:14.965 --> 00:40:18.125
certain kinds of psychological traits and people on the

852
00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:22.284
left would tend to favor more environmental factors, is

853
00:40:22.284 --> 00:40:23.665
that right or not?

854
00:40:24.294 --> 00:40:26.354
Yeah, it's a little bit of a complicated situation.

855
00:40:26.405 --> 00:40:28.445
We have done a study on this and it's

856
00:40:28.445 --> 00:40:30.324
true if you just give people the choice between

857
00:40:30.324 --> 00:40:33.879
the environment and genetics. Then, uh, people on the

858
00:40:33.879 --> 00:40:35.439
right tend to side a little bit more on

859
00:40:35.439 --> 00:40:37.429
genetics and people on the left with the environment,

860
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.600
you know, that somebody's a criminal just because they

861
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.360
eat too many candy bars or, you know, something

862
00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.959
like that, that, that tends to be the response

863
00:40:42.959 --> 00:40:45.639
on the left. What's interesting though is if you

864
00:40:45.639 --> 00:40:49.909
have three possibilities. The environment, genetics and free will,

865
00:40:50.719 --> 00:40:53.199
then guess what? uh THE right is very supportive

866
00:40:53.199 --> 00:40:55.679
of free will and it's actually the left that

867
00:40:55.679 --> 00:40:59.429
is more supportive of the genetics argument, um, so,

868
00:40:59.439 --> 00:41:03.659
uh. I think that's kind of interesting and um.

869
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:07.860
There's a, a couple of scholars recently, Robert Sapolsky

870
00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.379
and uh and others have um made the case

871
00:41:11.379 --> 00:41:13.580
that really people on the left should be much

872
00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:17.610
more supportive of the genetic argument. Um, THEY talk

873
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:19.290
about the genetic lottery and if you think about

874
00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:22.290
it, so, you know, all of us were given

875
00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:24.489
a certain batch of genes when we were born.

876
00:41:24.929 --> 00:41:26.449
Some of us lucked out a little bit more

877
00:41:26.449 --> 00:41:28.810
than others. Maybe it helped us, uh, to jump

878
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.649
higher or or play sports better, uh, kick a

879
00:41:31.649 --> 00:41:35.770
football, um, or do well academically and, uh, make

880
00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:39.179
good decisions, um, so you know, if, if you

881
00:41:39.179 --> 00:41:41.810
have that view that it's really nothing that you

882
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:43.449
should feel so proud of you just happen to

883
00:41:43.449 --> 00:41:45.250
get a good batch of genes from your parents.

884
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:47.629
Then we need to be more thoughtful and more

885
00:41:47.629 --> 00:41:50.070
helpful and more respectful of people who maybe were

886
00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:53.280
not as fortunate in the so-called genetic lottery. So,

887
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:55.949
uh, that I think is an interesting view that

888
00:41:55.949 --> 00:41:57.350
seems to be taking root a little bit that

889
00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:00.149
really people on the left should embrace the role

890
00:42:00.149 --> 00:42:02.310
of genetics because it, it fits in with this

891
00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:04.500
notion that we need to be much more compassionate

892
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.649
to people who are, are downtrodden.

893
00:42:07.649 --> 00:42:10.419
Yes, because I mean, even, even if we have

894
00:42:10.419 --> 00:42:13.350
a certain degree of free will, it's not the

895
00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:16.409
case that we can choose all of our traits,

896
00:42:16.469 --> 00:42:19.929
right? We always have these predispositions that pull us

897
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:23.780
uh uh in one direction or the other, right?

898
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:26.389
Exactly, that's very well said. Mhm.

899
00:42:26.879 --> 00:42:30.479
So, going back to one of my early questions

900
00:42:30.479 --> 00:42:34.320
when I asked you about why people tend to

901
00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:38.750
get into these heated discussions whenever there's political disagreement,

902
00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.550
do you, what do you think that we can

903
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:43.679
do with this information, the information that you present

904
00:42:43.679 --> 00:42:46.199
in your book? Is it, do you think it's

905
00:42:46.199 --> 00:42:50.679
possible to tackle political issues like political disputes, things

906
00:42:50.679 --> 00:42:52.989
like polarization, or not?

907
00:42:54.189 --> 00:42:55.889
Well yeah, I, I think my answer will probably

908
00:42:55.889 --> 00:42:58.570
be a little bit unsatisfying uh I wish I

909
00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.889
could say yes if if you just embrace these

910
00:43:00.889 --> 00:43:03.979
ideas then you know political conflict and polarization will

911
00:43:03.979 --> 00:43:06.610
go away but uh that's not the case. I,

912
00:43:06.689 --> 00:43:10.520
I do think that maybe, um, embracing these ideas

913
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.010
that the fact that politics runs very deep, um,

914
00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:16.280
could help us be a little bit less frustrated,

915
00:43:16.889 --> 00:43:21.389
you know, um. If we recognize that, that maybe

916
00:43:21.389 --> 00:43:24.750
the reason this individual is on the far political

917
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:28.030
right has more to do with um some kind

918
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:31.389
of deeper feelings, perhaps genetics, some experiences that individual

919
00:43:31.389 --> 00:43:35.550
had, uh, and by the way, you know, Sometimes

920
00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:37.469
what we study is called biopolitics and I think

921
00:43:37.469 --> 00:43:39.669
it's important to note that that can come not

922
00:43:39.669 --> 00:43:43.310
just from genetics but actually your environmental experiences can

923
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:47.030
be so rich that maybe that causes some environmental

924
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:49.790
changes or some physiological changes so you know we

925
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:51.350
can be shaped by our genes but also the

926
00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:57.040
environment shapes our biology uh as well. Um, SO

927
00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.239
where was I going with that? What was your

928
00:43:58.239 --> 00:43:59.110
question, Ricardo?

929
00:43:59.379 --> 00:44:02.840
Uh, MY question was, uh, if we can use

930
00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.629
the information you present in your book to tackle,

931
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.310
right, yeah, thank you. Sorry about that. So, um,

932
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.949
you know, I think, um. We need to be

933
00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:14.379
less frustrated with those people who differ from us

934
00:44:14.989 --> 00:44:16.709
in the United States right now in our campaign

935
00:44:16.709 --> 00:44:19.389
for the presidency, um, we hear a lot of

936
00:44:19.389 --> 00:44:21.429
talk about how down deep people are really all

937
00:44:21.429 --> 00:44:25.320
the same and that's that's a very appealing notion

938
00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:27.429
and I guess one of the things I would

939
00:44:27.429 --> 00:44:29.500
like to say is it's simply not true. I,

940
00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:32.149
I, I wish it were but in my opinion

941
00:44:32.149 --> 00:44:34.909
down deep we're very, very different we have different.

942
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.439
Neural structures, we have different genetics, we have different

943
00:44:39.439 --> 00:44:44.110
psychological tendencies, moral foundations, personalities, and these things, uh,

944
00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.419
kind of push us to the left or to

945
00:44:45.419 --> 00:44:47.639
the right. So they're very different. So the notion

946
00:44:47.639 --> 00:44:50.850
that these people who differ with us simply have

947
00:44:51.139 --> 00:44:53.270
Have listened to the wrong media outlet and if

948
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:54.510
we could just talk to them for a little

949
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.149
bit we could get them all straight we could

950
00:44:56.149 --> 00:44:58.469
we could sort this out that's not true it's

951
00:44:58.469 --> 00:45:00.419
you're gonna be banging your head against the wall

952
00:45:00.629 --> 00:45:01.989
and it's gonna be very frustrating to you and

953
00:45:01.989 --> 00:45:04.939
you're gonna think they're stupid or they're they're ignoring

954
00:45:04.939 --> 00:45:09.000
valid information. And maybe they are, but you know,

955
00:45:09.169 --> 00:45:11.969
one of the reasons they are is that they're

956
00:45:11.969 --> 00:45:14.209
wired up that way. They see and experience the

957
00:45:14.209 --> 00:45:16.520
world in a very different way than you do.

958
00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.570
So I guess, um, I don't know if it

959
00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:21.090
would help or not, but I think it would

960
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:23.290
be a more realistic approach for us to give

961
00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:25.530
up on this notion that somehow we're all the

962
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:26.969
same, you know, I guess at one level we

963
00:45:26.969 --> 00:45:29.649
are, we're human beings, but we have very different

964
00:45:29.649 --> 00:45:31.649
structures with regard to how social life should run

965
00:45:31.649 --> 00:45:34.879
and how we are built and I think recognizing

966
00:45:34.879 --> 00:45:38.760
that could. Um, COULD help us, uh, it could

967
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.090
maybe encourage us to focus more on a lot

968
00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:42.959
of the people who are not wired up one

969
00:45:42.959 --> 00:45:44.239
way or the other, and that's something we haven't

970
00:45:44.239 --> 00:45:46.399
talked a whole lot about yet, but just because

971
00:45:46.399 --> 00:45:47.800
we're talking a lot about the left and the

972
00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.159
right doesn't mean everybody can be categorized into those

973
00:45:50.159 --> 00:45:51.320
two things. There are a lot of people in

974
00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:54.219
the middle. Um, YOU know, in the studies we

975
00:45:54.219 --> 00:45:58.219
do, we, we array people from far left to

976
00:45:58.219 --> 00:45:59.860
far right, and, and then we see if there

977
00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:03.820
are correlations with these, you know, tendencies how people

978
00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:05.179
use the eye track or what they look at

979
00:46:05.179 --> 00:46:07.500
on a screen or or their neural structures or

980
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.540
their physiological responses. So, so we do recognize that

981
00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.419
there are people in the middle and I guess

982
00:46:12.419 --> 00:46:14.620
I think what needs to happen is you can

983
00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:17.439
identify those individuals who are not firmly embedded one

984
00:46:17.439 --> 00:46:19.979
way or the other. And those are the individuals

985
00:46:19.979 --> 00:46:22.620
you need to focus on because they're malleable they're

986
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.139
they're in play, so to speak we can we

987
00:46:25.139 --> 00:46:26.620
can persuade them and if you want to win

988
00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.219
an election, I think that's where you need to

989
00:46:28.219 --> 00:46:31.149
go. The notion that we can you know go

990
00:46:31.149 --> 00:46:33.969
clear over to the other side and persuade them,

991
00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.459
I think is probably a fool's errand. It's simply

992
00:46:36.459 --> 00:46:38.540
not gonna happen. They're just, they believe in that

993
00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.250
too strongly.

994
00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:42.959
But these people in the middle that you're referring

995
00:46:42.959 --> 00:46:46.129
to there, what do you call them? Are they

996
00:46:46.129 --> 00:46:47.360
the centrists?

997
00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:50.010
Um, YEAH, uh, in the middle of the centrist

998
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:52.770
is fine. Um, YOU know, I think we need

999
00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:54.850
to be a little careful. Uh, IT'S probably not

1000
00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:56.995
as big a group as we might. Imagine people

1001
00:46:56.995 --> 00:46:58.554
love to say they're in the center. That's a

1002
00:46:58.554 --> 00:47:01.584
very popular thing, and I don't wanna upset anybody

1003
00:47:01.584 --> 00:47:03.635
uh by saying I know more and you're not

1004
00:47:03.635 --> 00:47:05.475
really in the center, but, uh, a lot of

1005
00:47:05.475 --> 00:47:08.594
times in, in, uh, political science research if you

1006
00:47:08.594 --> 00:47:10.274
drill down a little bit you'll find out that

1007
00:47:10.274 --> 00:47:12.514
people who say they're in the center do tend

1008
00:47:12.514 --> 00:47:14.465
to tilt pretty strongly one way or the other,

1009
00:47:14.475 --> 00:47:16.354
either to the left or the right so you

1010
00:47:16.354 --> 00:47:19.580
have to get by. Whether they are just saying

1011
00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:23.290
that, um. Or, or whether they really believe it

1012
00:47:23.459 --> 00:47:24.850
and if you can identify those who are really

1013
00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:27.020
in the center, then I think yes they're, they're

1014
00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.540
the ones you need to talk to because they're

1015
00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.979
they're, they have an open mind, uh, and they

1016
00:47:30.979 --> 00:47:36.760
don't have these strong, uh strong predispositions. I guess

1017
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.360
one final point on on that I think that's

1018
00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.280
another illustration of why we shouldn't rely just on

1019
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.719
surveys because if you do ask people are you

1020
00:47:43.719 --> 00:47:45.080
in the center or the left or the right,

1021
00:47:45.159 --> 00:47:46.959
they'll say in the center and then, uh, but

1022
00:47:46.959 --> 00:47:49.120
we know that deep down they're not really there

1023
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.760
so I think that opens up the door for

1024
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.959
some of these more biological psychological approaches that we're

1025
00:47:53.959 --> 00:47:55.760
kind of advocating in our research agenda.

1026
00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.820
A very interesting thing that you focused on earlier

1027
00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.510
and we haven't talked much about yet has to

1028
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:06.770
do with physiological responses. So when it comes to

1029
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:09.750
differences between the left and the right, what kinds

1030
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:13.919
of uh behaviors, preferences or attitudes and so on

1031
00:48:13.919 --> 00:48:16.310
can we study physiologically?

1032
00:48:17.949 --> 00:48:19.110
Right, well, I guess we talked a little bit

1033
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:21.770
about disgust sensitivity, how, how that could do you

1034
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:24.389
could show people disgusting images and see how they

1035
00:48:24.389 --> 00:48:27.540
respond. Um, ONE of the things we've done, uh,

1036
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:31.350
besides that is, uh, startle response. So this is

1037
00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:34.590
where you just, uh, sit people, uh, you know,

1038
00:48:34.709 --> 00:48:37.030
comfortably, uh, in front of a computer and they're

1039
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:39.629
not looking at anything on the screen, uh, and

1040
00:48:39.629 --> 00:48:41.459
then all of a sudden they'll be a startle,

1041
00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.669
there'll be a sudden noise. Um, AND, uh, we've

1042
00:48:45.669 --> 00:48:47.179
got it set up so that we can see,

1043
00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:50.280
uh, we have sensors on their, uh, around their

1044
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.030
eyes, so we know, uh, you know, when that

1045
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.989
happens if somebody would come right up to your

1046
00:48:54.989 --> 00:48:57.229
eyes and say boo, you tend to blink, you,

1047
00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:00.229
you, you startled, um, but we can measure how

1048
00:49:00.229 --> 00:49:02.909
hard people blink if if they come down really

1049
00:49:02.909 --> 00:49:04.189
hard or if it's just a casual kind of

1050
00:49:04.189 --> 00:49:08.610
blink. Um, THAT'S called startle response. And, uh, again,

1051
00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:12.360
just one study, uh, that needs to be replicated,

1052
00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:15.409
but there is some indication that people on the

1053
00:49:15.409 --> 00:49:18.370
right do tend to have a somewhat stronger startle

1054
00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:21.399
response. The the muscles around their eyes contract a

1055
00:49:21.399 --> 00:49:24.149
little bit more powerfully, uh, than people who aren't.

1056
00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.760
And then you can always, uh, you know, put

1057
00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.800
people in certain contexts and do the same kinds

1058
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.429
of things. For example, um. If you're watching a

1059
00:49:32.429 --> 00:49:35.719
really scary movie and you're uh annoying little brother

1060
00:49:35.719 --> 00:49:37.739
or something comes up behind you and says boo,

1061
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:40.429
uh, and it's in the dark, then you're probably

1062
00:49:40.429 --> 00:49:42.110
going to startle a lot more than if you're

1063
00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:45.310
watching a romantic comedy, uh, in the daylight. So

1064
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:48.270
you know these contexts are really important and, um,

1065
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.030
that's, uh, one of the things that I think

1066
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:52.260
we can look at and see when people have,

1067
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:55.110
uh, these, these strong startle responses and are they

1068
00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:58.770
particularly sensitive to the context that exists. So yeah,

1069
00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:02.739
skin conductance, uh, seeing how whether you, um, your

1070
00:50:02.739 --> 00:50:04.860
sweat glands open up, that's a very common way

1071
00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:09.270
of measuring, um, a physiological response. Starle blink, uh,

1072
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.060
is, is another one. You can look at the

1073
00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:13.020
muscles, uh, not just around the eyes but in

1074
00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.979
other parts of the face to see what they're

1075
00:50:14.979 --> 00:50:17.699
doing, uh, the neuroimaging that we talked about earlier

1076
00:50:17.699 --> 00:50:20.979
in this, uh, podcast is, uh, you know, another

1077
00:50:20.979 --> 00:50:22.820
way to look at some of the physiological things

1078
00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:23.649
that are going on.

1079
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.060
Uh, BUT, uh, physiologically, what differences do you see?

1080
00:50:29.179 --> 00:50:31.540
Could you give, uh, could you give a specific

1081
00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:36.459
examples of physiological differences that you see between people

1082
00:50:36.459 --> 00:50:37.659
on the left and the right?

1083
00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.389
Yeah, well, I mentioned with regard to startle blink

1084
00:50:40.389 --> 00:50:41.939
that that people on the right tend to have

1085
00:50:41.939 --> 00:50:46.189
a somewhat stronger, uh, startle blink response, um, as

1086
00:50:46.189 --> 00:50:49.310
far as uh skin conductance is concerned, uh, here

1087
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:52.830
again, one study found a fairly small study that

1088
00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:55.149
uh people on the right tend to have a

1089
00:50:55.149 --> 00:50:59.939
stronger uh physiological response to, uh, negative things, uh,

1090
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:03.929
threatening situation. I wish uh we could go back

1091
00:51:03.929 --> 00:51:05.929
and do that again with what we talked about

1092
00:51:05.929 --> 00:51:10.780
before, the more uh um specific threatening situations that

1093
00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:14.320
involve other human beings, not just a spider, um,

1094
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:17.449
for example, but uh uh uh a person who

1095
00:51:17.449 --> 00:51:20.050
maybe doesn't look like you're in group, uh, with

1096
00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:22.879
a weapon. Uh, IN a gang, something like that,

1097
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.800
you know, I think that's where we'd really find

1098
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.679
these things. So, um, you know, I think that

1099
00:51:27.679 --> 00:51:30.290
there's some indication that people on the right have

1100
00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.840
a stronger physiological response to all negative things. I

1101
00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.719
think that's, that's not holding up real well in

1102
00:51:35.719 --> 00:51:37.750
replications and I think if we did focus on

1103
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:40.600
those particular kinds of negative things we've talked about

1104
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:44.000
today, uh, especially with regard to threats from outsiders,

1105
00:51:44.159 --> 00:51:45.679
I think that we get a real big difference

1106
00:51:45.679 --> 00:51:46.639
between the left and the right.

1107
00:51:47.669 --> 00:51:50.879
So I have one final question then earlier you

1108
00:51:50.879 --> 00:51:55.459
mentioned biopolitics. So in this field, what would you

1109
00:51:55.459 --> 00:51:59.010
say in your opinion are some of the still

1110
00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:02.679
unanswered questions that you would like to see answered

1111
00:52:02.679 --> 00:52:04.479
in the near future?

1112
00:52:04.899 --> 00:52:08.949
Yeah. Well, there there's so many that that's, uh,

1113
00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:11.260
I guess, uh, I've kind of started on this

1114
00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:15.379
road a little bit that, um. I think, uh,

1115
00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.300
Our research tended to focus a little bit too

1116
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:22.020
broadly on negativity, and we thought that that uh

1117
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.659
people on the political right had a more a

1118
00:52:24.659 --> 00:52:27.139
stronger reaction to negative things and people on the

1119
00:52:27.139 --> 00:52:29.659
left did. Uh, WHAT I'd really like to see

1120
00:52:29.659 --> 00:52:31.780
the, the field, the direction I'd like to see

1121
00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:34.100
the field go in is more along the lines

1122
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.699
of of particular negative things that involve in groups

1123
00:52:36.699 --> 00:52:38.659
and out groups because the more I think about

1124
00:52:38.659 --> 00:52:40.060
it, the more I I think this is at

1125
00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:43.219
the core. Uh, AGAIN, I hope this isn't too

1126
00:52:43.219 --> 00:52:45.360
much of a digression, but one time, uh, I

1127
00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:49.030
was doing, uh, a lecture series in, uh, Denmark,

1128
00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.199
and, um, several talks, and, uh, after one I

1129
00:52:53.199 --> 00:52:56.360
remember that uh some people pulled me aside, you

1130
00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.280
know, Danes are very polite so they didn't want

1131
00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.439
to, uh, challenge me in front of the whole

1132
00:53:00.439 --> 00:53:03.000
group, but afterwards they said, look, this left right

1133
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.919
idea is just wrong. There there is no clear

1134
00:53:04.919 --> 00:53:07.800
left and right. They said for example in Denmark.

1135
00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:10.320
All the even the parties on the right are

1136
00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.360
very supportive of a strong social welfare system, you

1137
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.879
know, with national health care, uh, and things like

1138
00:53:15.879 --> 00:53:17.280
that so there's really not a left and the

1139
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.239
right, um, so but for once I was able

1140
00:53:20.239 --> 00:53:22.000
to think fairly quickly on my feet and I

1141
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.719
said, look, uh, I, I, I know a little

1142
00:53:24.719 --> 00:53:26.360
bit about Danish politics and I know that's true,

1143
00:53:26.399 --> 00:53:28.719
but tell me, is it the case that the

1144
00:53:28.719 --> 00:53:31.639
parties on the right also want to extend the

1145
00:53:31.639 --> 00:53:35.620
social safety net to recent immigrants? And then they

1146
00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:37.260
said, well, no, of course not, you know, parties

1147
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.250
are right they don't want the immigrants to be

1148
00:53:39.659 --> 00:53:42.820
uh um able to, to draw on the social

1149
00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.820
welfare systems and I said well now you're talking,

1150
00:53:44.979 --> 00:53:47.250
you know, this to me is getting close to

1151
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:48.959
the core of the difference between the left and

1152
00:53:48.959 --> 00:53:53.139
the right, um, you know how we distribute things.

1153
00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:57.149
It's not nearly as important in this larger political

1154
00:53:57.149 --> 00:54:00.699
orientation sense then who's getting those benefits, you know,

1155
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:02.750
if you see those benefits going to people who

1156
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:05.389
you think don't deserve them, ne'er do wells and

1157
00:54:05.389 --> 00:54:07.110
people who have come from other countries who haven't

1158
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.610
been paying taxes and things like that, you know,

1159
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:11.750
now you're starting to get at the differences between

1160
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:15.629
the left and the right, um, so I that's

1161
00:54:15.629 --> 00:54:17.389
again, maybe we should have talked about this earlier

1162
00:54:17.389 --> 00:54:18.600
when you asked about the left and right, but

1163
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:20.030
I think we have to be careful. There are

1164
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:21.429
a lot of issues that don't load on the

1165
00:54:21.429 --> 00:54:24.070
left and right nearly as clearly. Uh, BUT I

1166
00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:26.310
think this issue of sensitivity to to out groups

1167
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:29.570
and and in groups, um, really does so to

1168
00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:32.090
bring that back to your pertinent question is I,

1169
00:54:32.199 --> 00:54:35.389
I, I wish the discipline of biopolitic would focus

1170
00:54:35.389 --> 00:54:37.909
a little bit more on these differences between, uh,

1171
00:54:37.919 --> 00:54:42.389
tradition and new ideas, uh, punishing and letting them

1172
00:54:42.389 --> 00:54:45.459
off with a slap on the wrist, uh, immigrants,

1173
00:54:45.469 --> 00:54:47.469
uh, as opposed to, to natives who've been in

1174
00:54:47.469 --> 00:54:49.750
this country a long time to me that's, that's

1175
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:52.790
really what's at the core and. That's why politics

1176
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:54.909
is so contentious these days because we're talking about

1177
00:54:54.909 --> 00:54:59.149
issues that have a very deep evolutionary um hold

1178
00:54:59.149 --> 00:55:01.780
on the human condition, uh, in a way that

1179
00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:03.810
some of these issues, other issues simply don't.

1180
00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.310
Great. So the book is again predisposed, the left,

1181
00:55:08.439 --> 00:55:11.320
right, and the biology of political differences. I'm leaving

1182
00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.560
a link to it in the description of the

1183
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:17.000
interview. And Doctor Hibbing, just before we go, apart

1184
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000
from the book, would you like to tell people

1185
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.120
where they can find you and your work on

1186
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:21.770
the internet?

1187
00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:27.989
Sure, um, you know, my, um, uh, my email

1188
00:55:27.989 --> 00:55:33.229
address is jibbing@unl.edu. Um, UNL stands for University of

1189
00:55:33.229 --> 00:55:36.459
Nebraska Lincoln, uh, so, uh, yeah, and just, uh,

1190
00:55:36.469 --> 00:55:39.949
all lowercase jibbing uh at UNL.edu. That's probably the

1191
00:55:39.949 --> 00:55:41.629
best. I don't have a fancy web page or

1192
00:55:41.629 --> 00:55:44.120
anything like that, so, uh, yeah, I'm always, uh,

1193
00:55:44.129 --> 00:55:45.909
eager to hear from people whether they think these

1194
00:55:45.909 --> 00:55:49.389
ideas are crazy or. Uh, PARTICULAR experiences they've had,

1195
00:55:49.699 --> 00:55:51.360
uh, you know, part of my interest in this

1196
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.379
comes because I have a brother who's very much

1197
00:55:53.379 --> 00:55:55.939
on the political right, uh, and I'm not so

1198
00:55:55.939 --> 00:55:58.419
much, so I'm curious, you know, what, where this

1199
00:55:58.419 --> 00:56:00.889
comes from, uh, and it's, it's led me, uh,

1200
00:56:00.949 --> 00:56:02.780
uh, because he's still my brother. I still love

1201
00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:05.179
him, so I wanna, wanna understand why we have

1202
00:56:05.179 --> 00:56:07.020
these things that sometimes make it difficult for us

1203
00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:09.139
to get along. So, uh, in that sense I'm

1204
00:56:09.139 --> 00:56:11.199
always interested in other people's kinds of experiences with

1205
00:56:11.199 --> 00:56:13.699
this, uh, and hopefully we can all get together

1206
00:56:13.699 --> 00:56:15.379
and figure out a way that maybe we can

1207
00:56:15.379 --> 00:56:16.459
get along a little bit better.

1208
00:56:17.659 --> 00:56:20.229
