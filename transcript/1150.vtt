00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:03.220
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.070
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.760
today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor Mark

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.029
Blythe, William A. Rhodes, professor of International Economics at

5
00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:17.309
Brown University, and today we're talking about his latest

6
00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:21.700
book, Inflation A Guide for Users and Losers. So,

7
00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.149
Doctor Blythe, welcome back to the show. It's always

8
00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.229
a pleasure to have you

9
00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:27.180
everyone. It's great to be back with you.

10
00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.920
OK, so, I mean, why did you decide to

11
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.750
write a book on inflation? What motivated you to

12
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.200
do so?

13
00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:41.380
Uh, IT wasn't the inflation itself. So, We recall

14
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.560
that we had this inflationary burst across the world

15
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.939
from 21 to 24, essentially. And I had a

16
00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.419
postdoc at the time, my co-author Nicolo Fracaro, and

17
00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:50.900
he walked into my office and said, we should

18
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.659
do a book on inflation. I said, well, why

19
00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.860
don't we understand this? It's always and everywhere a

20
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.979
monetary phenomena, blah blah blah. And he said, yes,

21
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.860
but it's a bit like austerity, and we had

22
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.700
both written books on austerity in the austerity period.

23
00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:05.650
And I said, what do you mean? He says,

24
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.370
well it's a bit like monetary austerity. I mean,

25
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.449
ultimately, who gets the, who gets the short end

26
00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:13.160
of the stick when you raise interest rates? Um,

27
00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:15.589
PEOPLE who have become unemployed, who's that? It's people

28
00:01:15.589 --> 00:01:17.089
in the bottom end of the skill and income

29
00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:20.769
distribution. Uh, WHO makes out quite well from inflation,

30
00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:23.529
people who hold assets that are inflation resistant like

31
00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:26.769
housing, uh, people who have stocks and bonds and

32
00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:29.050
companies that do well from inflation. So there's a

33
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.970
whole distributional story here that we don't really appreciate

34
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.980
it. So hence we focused on this thing of

35
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.319
users and losers. Second thing was, it was quite

36
00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.680
interesting. Um, I was raised in the last inflation.

37
00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:43.050
I was on the tail end of it. I

38
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.230
mean, it was the 70s into the 80s, and

39
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.209
I kind of came of age in the 1980s.

40
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.330
And the story that we got, which was no

41
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.760
longer believed by the 1990s, was what was called

42
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.250
the monetarist story, which is Milton Friedman's thing of

43
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.930
it's always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, right? So

44
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.129
it's the government spending too much money. And we

45
00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:02.089
noticed that this was getting a better traction in

46
00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:06.300
the US because of the Biden stimulus. During COVID,

47
00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:09.270
but, you know, Germany's been running a balanced budget

48
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.389
for the past 10 years. There's no way that

49
00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.669
like that could explain what was going on. And

50
00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.270
it was quite clear that what was happening was

51
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.910
a very big set of supply shocks, COVID shutdowns,

52
00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.669
loss of European gas. That was kind of what

53
00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.339
was explaining it. So, given that we all obviously

54
00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.110
the monetary story needs to be investigated and updated.

55
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.110
And the third thing that we got into were

56
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.500
the different stories that people were telling about this.

57
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.589
There were rival narratives contending to explain this, and

58
00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.820
none of them really focused on money that much.

59
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.750
It was what for stresses in the labor market,

60
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.990
wage price spirals. It was greedy corporations pushing up

61
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.000
prices. Uh, IT was a host of different factors

62
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.960
that were being pointed to. It was analogies to

63
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.279
the 1970s. It was analogies to the 1940s. So

64
00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:54.710
we thought it would be fun to just sort

65
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.669
of unpack this and having not had a serious

66
00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:59.839
think about inflation for the past 40 years because

67
00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.240
there hasn't been any, try and do that now.

68
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.039
OK, but probably there are many people out there

69
00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.000
who hear about inflation and they see the prices

70
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.220
of different kinds of products go up, but they

71
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.179
don't exactly know what inflation is. I mean, what

72
00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:19.369
is it exactly and when do we have inflation?

73
00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:23.520
Sure. Um, SO inflation is a, or I like

74
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.830
to call it, and we call in the book,

75
00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:27.880
a rise in the general level of all prices.

76
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.660
So it's not when one thing like eggs or

77
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.729
even houses gets expensive, right? People talk about house

78
00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.929
inflation. It's not, it's just you haven't built enough

79
00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:40.649
houses. There's excess demand, the price goes up. There's

80
00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.490
nothing inflation about that. It has to be all

81
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.089
prices rising together. Now, why is it hard for

82
00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:48.729
people to sort of like get a grasp on

83
00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.410
that? Because what people look at quite reasonably are

84
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.679
price levels. They notice that over time things get

85
00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:57.570
more expensive. The the box of cereal in the

86
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.330
supermarket gets smaller, even though they're charging the same

87
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.169
price, that their cost of living is on the

88
00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.720
up and up. So they got really annoyed with

89
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.809
my tribe when we say, but we looked at

90
00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:09.279
80,000 items and we tracked them month by month

91
00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:11.130
and we use the price deflator and we do

92
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.529
all this fancy statistics. And we can tell you

93
00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:16.130
that the inflation rate is falling. And normal people

94
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.130
go, are you kidding me? It's getting more expensive

95
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.170
week by week. And the thing is, they're both

96
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.410
right, because what we're looking at is the delta,

97
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.029
the rate of change in prices. What they're looking

98
00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:27.480
at is the absolute level of prices, and no

99
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.230
one lives the rate of change. No one goes,

100
00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:32.649
oh, it feels so much better because prices went

101
00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:35.734
down 0.2% last month. They just go, oh my

102
00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:39.375
God, everything is ridiculously expensive. And when you have

103
00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:42.454
a highly skewed income and wealth distribution, the people

104
00:04:42.454 --> 00:04:44.125
at the bottom end of that distribution, which are

105
00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:46.575
the majority of people, they're the ones that feel

106
00:04:46.575 --> 00:04:48.575
it the most. So yeah, absolutely, it was a

107
00:04:48.575 --> 00:04:52.165
serious problem, and there was also a serious disconnect

108
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.375
in the way that sort of we were measuring

109
00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:56.054
it, and people would experience it.

110
00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:01.239
And what is an inflation index? Uh, HOW is

111
00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:05.070
it put together and what does it measure exactly?

112
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.239
Well that's the sausages in the factory story, isn't

113
00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:11.200
it? Um, SO the big three central banks, which

114
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.760
is the Fed, really the biggest one, then the

115
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.359
ECB and the Bank of England, you could throw

116
00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:17.480
in the Bank of Japan. Everyone has a way

117
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.839
of calculating this. So essentially what the Fed does

118
00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:23.559
is it looks at 80,000 items month by month

119
00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:25.480
and tracks whether they go up in price or

120
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.679
down in price. Now, this sounds like a sensible

121
00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:29.880
thing to do, and it is, even though it's

122
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.779
a big task. But think about the following. At

123
00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.480
one point, we used to use cassettes to record

124
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.459
music. Then we did CDs, so we swapped cassettes

125
00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:43.420
for CDs. Alright, when you stop using CDs and

126
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.140
you start to do streaming. Do you include the

127
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.220
fee? Are the equivalent products? How do you cope

128
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.059
with things like rising, uh, let's say the uh

129
00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:55.980
the quality of a good, rather than just its

130
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.959
price. So there's a lot of things that go

131
00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:59.970
into the index and it's a best faith attempt

132
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.459
to basically track the general level of all prices.

133
00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:04.940
But think about, for example, the world that we

134
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.779
live in now where we consume lots of digital

135
00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:11.950
services which are ostensibly free. Right? How should that

136
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.269
be accounted for, because these things still generate massive

137
00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:19.029
profits for companies, therefore, they are in some sense

138
00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:22.230
part of prices. But we're doing this now and

139
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.140
it's ostensibly free. Right? So, how does that factor

140
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.869
in the index? So there's a lot of issues

141
00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:30.750
in putting this together, but it's the best faith

142
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.589
attempt to track over time. The Bank of England

143
00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:36.950
does about 8000, the Fed does 80,000 orders of

144
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.829
magnitude different, much bigger economy, but it's an attempt

145
00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:42.299
to basically track all the prices and come up

146
00:06:42.299 --> 00:06:44.630
with like one number, you base that to a

147
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.470
certain year, you call it 100 and you watch

148
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:47.670
you track changes over time.

149
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.690
And when it comes to fighting inflation, I know

150
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.570
that the typical approach includes or involves raising interest

151
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.010
rates. I mean, how does that work?

152
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.839
So this is where it started to get interesting

153
00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.799
for me for another reason, which is there's a

154
00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:09.230
lot of um interest just now, shall we say,

155
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.279
in the the Trump administration's attempt to tame the

156
00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:14.839
Fed to their will, that is to reduce central

157
00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:17.440
bank independence. And I was talking to one of

158
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.950
the Financial Times reporters about this, and I said,

159
00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:22.799
we have to remember the central bank independence and

160
00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:25.119
all this sort of stuff didn't come down from

161
00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:28.720
Mount Sinai with Moses 4000 years ago on tablets.

162
00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:31.779
It's actually a very recent invention that comes around

163
00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:35.130
in the 1980s and actually in the 1990s, in

164
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.540
response to the inflationary crisis of the 1970s. Now,

165
00:07:37.579 --> 00:07:39.850
why is this interesting? Because if you go back

166
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.209
and look at the period from 1940 to 1975,

167
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.410
you didn't have independent central banks with operational control

168
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.179
of interest rates. What you had was a variety

169
00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:53.380
of different institutional measures, where central banks worked with

170
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.100
treasuries, they were largely in some ways the check

171
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.470
cashing agency for the treasury. They were not independent,

172
00:07:59.549 --> 00:08:02.279
and interest rates were part of the overall policy

173
00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:04.820
suite that politicians had to manipulate to try and

174
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.200
do things in the economy. The lesson of the

175
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.359
1970s was that's bad. Politicians are what economists call

176
00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:14.040
time inconsistent. That is to say, they'll promise to

177
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.600
do one thing at a certain point, but they'll

178
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.630
do another point for electoral reasons. I actually call

179
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.350
that democracy. I'm not sure it's definitely necessarily a

180
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.230
problem, but in the literature it was seen to

181
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.269
be a problem. And therefore we needed to take

182
00:08:25.269 --> 00:08:27.269
the tools away from them because only then could

183
00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:29.429
we have monetary stability because they would promise not

184
00:08:29.429 --> 00:08:32.200
to spend money, but they'll always spend too much.

185
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:34.308
I mean, if you look at the past 35

186
00:08:34.308 --> 00:08:37.058
years, the problem across the developed world, at least,

187
00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:41.500
is that they haven't spent enough. Infrastructure's falling apart,

188
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.030
education's underinvested. Um, THERE'S lots of problems to do

189
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.510
with the lack of spending. Germany's balanced budget, Schwartz

190
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.059
and Nhl has been a disaster for them. Even

191
00:08:52.059 --> 00:08:55.070
the trains don't run on time there now. So

192
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.500
it's not as if these politicians have been like

193
00:08:57.909 --> 00:09:00.580
spendaholics that have been held in checked only by

194
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.260
central banks. But that was the system that we

195
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.979
set up. So we stopped them spending and we've

196
00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:07.739
give the banks control of interest rates. Now the

197
00:09:07.739 --> 00:09:10.059
lesson there was a guy called Paul Volcker. He

198
00:09:10.059 --> 00:09:12.929
was a Fed chairman in the 1970s, appointed by

199
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.020
Carter and then worked under Reagan. And when inflation

200
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.400
reached around 20% in the United States, he, well,

201
00:09:19.619 --> 00:09:22.890
16%, he pushed interest rates up to about 20%.

202
00:09:23.219 --> 00:09:26.659
And this basically blew a huge hole in the

203
00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:28.179
economy, because if you think about it, what you're

204
00:09:28.179 --> 00:09:32.030
doing is you're massively tightening everybody's credit. And it

205
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.390
means that the loans you've got get massively more

206
00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.590
expensive. And if you're a company, you can't afford

207
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.070
to pay them, so you shut down and you

208
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.270
lay off your workers you have a huge recession.

209
00:09:40.469 --> 00:09:42.070
And that's what happened in Britain, and that's what

210
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.190
happened in America in particular in the early 1980s.

211
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.580
And then the lesson from this was that was

212
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.030
a good thing. Now why would that be a

213
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.950
good thing? Because people had gotten used to rising

214
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.780
prices. And they started to base their claims for

215
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.539
wages on those rising prices. And you got onto

216
00:09:57.539 --> 00:09:59.619
what was called the wage price spiral where they

217
00:09:59.619 --> 00:10:01.619
chase each other up. And the only way to

218
00:10:01.619 --> 00:10:04.989
break the psychology of expectations was to do this

219
00:10:04.989 --> 00:10:07.059
jack up of interest rates, which would cause a

220
00:10:07.059 --> 00:10:09.260
big recession. A lot of people would be unemployed,

221
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.900
bad things would happen for a while, but it

222
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.099
would reset expectations. And once people's prices, price expectations

223
00:10:15.099 --> 00:10:19.005
are reset, then the economy can Start. Now this

224
00:10:19.005 --> 00:10:22.125
is miles away from the kind of Keynesian understanding

225
00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:25.484
of macroeconomics that we had since 1945 and marked

226
00:10:25.484 --> 00:10:28.244
a real watershed moment to a view of price

227
00:10:28.244 --> 00:10:30.835
stability being the most important thing rather than full

228
00:10:30.835 --> 00:10:33.505
employment, etc. But that's essentially why we do it

229
00:10:33.505 --> 00:10:35.085
and we get it from the lesson of the

230
00:10:35.085 --> 00:10:37.955
Volcker recession, that it was unpleasant, it was bad,

231
00:10:37.965 --> 00:10:39.765
but we had to do it. It was the

232
00:10:39.765 --> 00:10:42.405
only way to break those inflationary expectations.

233
00:10:43.659 --> 00:10:48.429
And does uh raising interest rates link in any

234
00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:52.109
way to austerity measures, which is something we talked

235
00:10:52.109 --> 00:10:54.590
about in our first conversation? Oh,

236
00:10:54.599 --> 00:10:57.349
absolutely, in the sense that, and this was Nicola's

237
00:10:57.349 --> 00:10:59.710
original point that made us think about writing the

238
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.830
book, is that when you make those people unemployed,

239
00:11:02.869 --> 00:11:06.239
you're not making bankers unemployed. Right, you're not making

240
00:11:06.239 --> 00:11:09.919
university professors unemployed. You, you're making the people who

241
00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:13.780
are already the most vulnerable, the most cash-strapped, the

242
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.599
ones who pay the most for their credit, much

243
00:11:16.599 --> 00:11:18.640
poorer, right? So if you're at the bottom end

244
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.840
of the income distribution and you're on payday loans

245
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.400
and you're going from check to check through a

246
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.799
payday lender, and you're paying 40% a month interest

247
00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:29.080
or some absurd usurious rate like this, interest rates

248
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.630
go up. Like that's the difference between literally your

249
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.440
family can eat and your family doesn't eat on

250
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.070
a Thursday. Right? You're in the bottom 20 to

251
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.380
40% and you're shopping in one of the cheaper

252
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.590
supermarkets rather than the high end ones. Inflation goes

253
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.030
up to 10%, you're not eating on a Thursday.

254
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.510
The kids have to like make do without, right?

255
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.840
This is a serious, serious problem for people. Whereas

256
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.429
at the other end of the income distribution, I'll

257
00:11:52.429 --> 00:11:54.190
give you my favorite statistic from the book, from

258
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.469
a paper done by economists at the University of

259
00:11:57.469 --> 00:12:01.340
Amherst in the United States. In 2022, we have

260
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.500
to remember that what happened was a big supply

261
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.260
shock, insofar as gas stopped flowing into Europe. And

262
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.020
it took Europe a year to find that replacement

263
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.840
gas in the form of LNG came from Qatar,

264
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.739
came from the United States, right? Now, in order

265
00:12:16.739 --> 00:12:19.510
to pay for that, the basic, rather, in order

266
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.900
to supply that, the United States, Qatar had to

267
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.460
divert existing supplies and increased supplies. Hard to do

268
00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.020
in the short term, so the price of gas

269
00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.020
went up a lot. What does that mean? It

270
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.979
means that if you're a firm that basically ships

271
00:12:30.979 --> 00:12:33.530
or makes gas, you made a lot of money.

272
00:12:34.179 --> 00:12:35.940
So much so that according to the estimates of

273
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.090
these guys. The top carbon firms in the United

274
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:44.049
States made $220 billion in profits above what they

275
00:12:44.049 --> 00:12:46.989
would have made without the pandemic, right, according to

276
00:12:46.989 --> 00:12:50.690
the normal rate of profit. Uh, AND that profitability

277
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.130
basically is given out to the shareholders in those

278
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.450
companies. Now, the top 1% of the US owns

279
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.789
50% of the shares. So let's assume that 50%

280
00:13:00.789 --> 00:13:02.830
of that cash that was generated was given out

281
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.780
to the shareholders. That means that 3.3 million people

282
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.950
got 110 billion as a windfall just for owning

283
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.710
shares in those companies, which more than offset the

284
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.869
inflation effects that they would have felt on their

285
00:13:16.869 --> 00:13:19.549
consumption, because when you're in the top 1%, a

286
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.780
vanishingly small part of your income goes to consumption

287
00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:25.309
because you just don't buy that many loaves of

288
00:13:25.309 --> 00:13:27.390
bread when you're on half a million a year.

289
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.609
So that was the austerity story that once again,

290
00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:31.900
the poor are the ones that are going to

291
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.119
pay for this. One's through unemployment, and secondly through

292
00:13:35.119 --> 00:13:37.659
declining consumption. In a way, it's exactly the same.

293
00:13:38.429 --> 00:13:44.270
Mhm. What would be alternative policies to raising interest

294
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:44.979
rates?

295
00:13:45.469 --> 00:13:47.619
Ah, now this is where it gets very interesting.

296
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.190
We have to go back to the 50s. The

297
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.109
way that economists in the 50s and 60s thought

298
00:13:51.109 --> 00:13:54.809
about inflation, it was all supply chain bottlenecks. They

299
00:13:54.809 --> 00:13:59.200
thought about it as there basically wasn't enough capacity.

300
00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:01.729
We needed to increase capacity in the economy. When

301
00:14:01.729 --> 00:14:04.200
you increase the supply side, the prices come down.

302
00:14:04.409 --> 00:14:06.690
It was never about pushing interest rates up. That

303
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.090
was very much Volcker and the experience that we

304
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:12.320
just talked about. So they certainly thought there were

305
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.159
alternatives, but they also lived in a simpler world

306
00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:16.409
in the sense that what you had in the

307
00:14:16.409 --> 00:14:20.440
50s and 60s were largely national economies where everybody

308
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.719
made more or less the same stuff, traded a

309
00:14:22.719 --> 00:14:26.349
little bit, financial markets were isolated, they weren't integrated,

310
00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:30.250
and governments were basically dominant actors in the economy

311
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.799
in terms of what we call fiscal dominance, taxes

312
00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:35.479
and spending rather than having these independent central banks.

313
00:14:35.989 --> 00:14:38.320
So if you wanted to do things like price

314
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.900
controls, you could do it. I'll give you an

315
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.570
example of this. You can see I'm sitting in

316
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:44.599
a studio here, and right at the back here

317
00:14:44.599 --> 00:14:47.690
is an Ibanez bass guitar from 1979, and it

318
00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.570
was the first one I ever bought, costs a

319
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.119
lot of money back then. And uh in order

320
00:14:52.119 --> 00:14:53.650
to buy this thing, I had to go to

321
00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.770
what's called a hire purchase company. It was a

322
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.500
finance company. They don't exist anymore. And these were

323
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.919
the people that the government would license to do

324
00:15:00.919 --> 00:15:03.330
things like consumer loans, and you paid a lot

325
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.780
of interest. I paid 18% on this thing. So

326
00:15:06.789 --> 00:15:08.309
I went down every week and I gave them

327
00:15:08.309 --> 00:15:09.590
money and all this sort of stuff, and it's

328
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.229
called hire purchase, right? Essentially you hired it from

329
00:15:12.229 --> 00:15:14.349
them at a premium and then you purchase the

330
00:15:14.349 --> 00:15:17.070
thing, right? Now, why was it that was a

331
00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.619
crazy way of doing things. Why were you doing

332
00:15:18.619 --> 00:15:20.549
that? Because the government could turn these things on

333
00:15:20.549 --> 00:15:23.369
and off overnight. They could limit the supply of

334
00:15:23.369 --> 00:15:25.640
credit. They could basically use a lot of different

335
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.929
instruments like that. But all of that was considered

336
00:15:27.929 --> 00:15:31.349
to be inefficient and against sort of people's economic

337
00:15:31.349 --> 00:15:33.669
liberty, and it all got swept away in the

338
00:15:33.669 --> 00:15:35.909
1980s. Now, I'm not suggesting we go back to

339
00:15:35.909 --> 00:15:37.669
that, but it says there was another way of

340
00:15:37.669 --> 00:15:40.619
doing it, right? Now, here's the thing going forward.

341
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.010
We live in a very different world, one whereby

342
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.380
your inflationary shock is caused by the fact that

343
00:15:45.549 --> 00:15:47.820
you make 3 quarters of the things you consume

344
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.450
abroad. If you're Britain, you import 40% of your

345
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:55.250
food. If you're Europe, you import 60% of your

346
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:59.650
energy and all financial markets are integrated. So sticking

347
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.729
up a little, you know, putting a price control

348
00:16:01.729 --> 00:16:04.630
on the price of a bass guitar domestically isn't

349
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.570
going to do that much for it. So what

350
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.729
we found in the pandemic, or rather what we

351
00:16:09.729 --> 00:16:12.090
found in the inflationary period, was that there were

352
00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:13.890
lots of different attempts to do controls and they

353
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.539
tell a very mixed story. So in Hungary, they

354
00:16:16.539 --> 00:16:19.940
basically said, right, supermarkets, price of bread will be

355
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.570
this. Any economist will tell you the minute you

356
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.500
do that, if the market price of bread is

357
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.700
higher than the reserve price, you're going to get

358
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.780
what's called the black market and all the supermarkets

359
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.859
will be empty. It's pretty much what happened. Uh,

360
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.450
ON the other hand, what you had in Spain

361
00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.739
was the government there said, all right, probably not

362
00:16:36.739 --> 00:16:39.299
a good idea to do this. Why don't we

363
00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:43.340
help people by subsidizing other parts of their consumption

364
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.630
that we can do something about. So we can't

365
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.729
do much about the price of bread directly. Without

366
00:16:47.729 --> 00:16:51.210
it being weird. So why don't we subsidize things

367
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.849
like public transport? Why don't we, if you're below

368
00:16:53.849 --> 00:16:57.489
a certain income, subsidize electricity consumption, right? So what

369
00:16:57.489 --> 00:16:59.200
you're doing is you're saying, yeah, you're taking a

370
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.570
hit on your income here, but we're going to

371
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.450
give you a subsidy there, right? That seemed to

372
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:07.068
work quite well. Uh, OTHER places tried intermediate strategies.

373
00:17:07.358 --> 00:17:10.068
France basically got all their supermarkets together and said,

374
00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:12.417
Don't you raise prices? And they all made a

375
00:17:12.417 --> 00:17:14.958
big hoo-ha about not raising prices, and then they

376
00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.638
went back and checked and it turned out half

377
00:17:16.638 --> 00:17:20.048
of them had raised prices. Um, SO it's kind

378
00:17:20.048 --> 00:17:23.678
of hard to do this stuff. Um, THE problem

379
00:17:23.678 --> 00:17:26.368
with it is that it's very hard to identify

380
00:17:26.368 --> 00:17:28.438
before the fact if the proposed control is going

381
00:17:28.438 --> 00:17:30.979
to work. And then after the fact, even if

382
00:17:30.979 --> 00:17:32.579
it seems to have worked, you have to be

383
00:17:32.579 --> 00:17:35.380
careful that it wasn't other factors that were playing

384
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.260
into it. So what we come away with in

385
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.020
the book is that look, there's lots of things

386
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.339
you can do if your goal is not to

387
00:17:42.339 --> 00:17:45.579
control inflation, but to offset the effects of it,

388
00:17:45.619 --> 00:17:48.060
the austerity effects. There's a lot of things you

389
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.380
can do. If you really want to control the

390
00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.630
inflation rate, it's not even. THAT pushing up interest

391
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.060
rates is really what's doing it. So for example,

392
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.650
this time, unlike Paul Volcker, where it went to

393
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.790
20%, nominally 16% real, whatever it was, uh, this

394
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.189
time, I don't think a single central bank raised

395
00:18:05.189 --> 00:18:08.109
their so-called policy rate above the actual rate of

396
00:18:08.109 --> 00:18:11.770
inflation. And in fact, rather than causing unemployment coming

397
00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.250
out of the pandemic, what we got was an

398
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.449
increase in employment in many countries at the same

399
00:18:17.449 --> 00:18:20.170
time as interest rates went up. So it's not

400
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.729
even clear that it was interest rates that did

401
00:18:22.729 --> 00:18:25.410
the trick. Rather, what happened was there was a

402
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.569
big supply shock in gas for Europe. It took

403
00:18:28.569 --> 00:18:30.170
Europe 1 year to 18 months to figure out

404
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.599
where the new gas was, and then after about

405
00:18:32.599 --> 00:18:35.010
24 or 30 months, the price of gas went

406
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.369
down. It was that simple.

407
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.760
Mhm. And is it better to control wages or

408
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.400
to control prices?

409
00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.819
Uh, IT'S better not to control either. I mean,

410
00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:49.140
ultimately at the end of the day, right? I

411
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.459
mean, wages are one price. And if you try

412
00:18:52.459 --> 00:18:54.900
and control wages, so for example, the Bank of

413
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.020
England governor came out and said it would be

414
00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.160
terrible if people ask for a pay rise now

415
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.859
as prices are rising. First of all, if we

416
00:19:01.859 --> 00:19:04.089
still had unions, you'd be asking for a strike,

417
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.699
but we don't have unions anymore, so you don't.

418
00:19:06.805 --> 00:19:08.474
You have to actually have that problem in your

419
00:19:08.474 --> 00:19:10.915
labor market, because even if people want a pay

420
00:19:10.915 --> 00:19:13.155
rise, they can't get one, right? I mean, that's

421
00:19:13.155 --> 00:19:15.675
basically why wages are so low and profits are

422
00:19:15.675 --> 00:19:19.194
so high. The United States are currently 12.5% of

423
00:19:19.194 --> 00:19:22.114
GDPs and corporate profits. It's never been higher, right?

424
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.270
So controlling wages is not your issue. Controlling prices,

425
00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:29.959
it depends. We control lots of prices. Um, THROUGHOUT

426
00:19:29.959 --> 00:19:33.489
Europe, the price of electricity is just completely managed

427
00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.020
by different national authorities. There are price controls all

428
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.880
over these markets, for example, uh, in the United

429
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.739
States, we, we think it's a free market economy.

430
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.439
Um, THE entire healthcare sector, which is 20% of

431
00:19:45.439 --> 00:19:48.859
GDP, has fictitious prices. There's no, I, I can't

432
00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:50.380
actually walk into a hospital and say, hey, if

433
00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.119
I broke my leg tomorrow, how much would this

434
00:19:52.119 --> 00:19:54.459
cost, right? There's no way of finding this out.

435
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.739
It's all negotiated prices. So in other words, we

436
00:19:56.739 --> 00:19:59.130
are controlling in some shape or form those prices.

437
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.780
So it's not as if, like, you know, we

438
00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.630
don't do these things or we should or shouldn't

439
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.260
do these things. Like the situation is actually much

440
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.989
more complex. So my answer to this is it's

441
00:20:08.989 --> 00:20:12.750
better to control neither and essentially try and either

442
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.310
attack the root causes of the inflation or buffer

443
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.229
the symptoms of it. That's pretty much what you

444
00:20:18.229 --> 00:20:21.150
can do. Um, YOU know, some, some people whose

445
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.790
work I really respect suggests things like buffer stocks

446
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.510
and all this sort of stuff, uh, particularly now

447
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.349
if climate change is, uh, going to wreak havoc

448
00:20:29.349 --> 00:20:31.650
eventually on food supply. Etc. We should have a

449
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.930
weak buffer stock. Yeah, I mean, I'm totally fine

450
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.930
with all that stuff, uh, except that, you know,

451
00:20:35.969 --> 00:20:37.329
we have to remember we live in a world

452
00:20:37.329 --> 00:20:41.089
that's already incredibly unequal, and a buffer stock requires

453
00:20:41.089 --> 00:20:43.119
spending money on now on something that you might

454
00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:45.089
not need in the future, which means that you're

455
00:20:45.089 --> 00:20:46.810
not spending on other things that you could be

456
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.369
spending on now, which actually might be what people

457
00:20:49.369 --> 00:20:52.160
want instead. So there's always as economists call it,

458
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.239
an opportunity cost of these things. So, you know,

459
00:20:55.449 --> 00:20:57.849
my basic line is, I'm not against them, but

460
00:20:57.849 --> 00:20:58.729
I'm not for them.

461
00:21:00.239 --> 00:21:02.989
Uh, LET'S talk a little bit about the causes

462
00:21:02.989 --> 00:21:06.239
of inflation. I mean, what really causes inflation and

463
00:21:06.239 --> 00:21:10.670
in the ongoing inflation, the inflation we're going through,

464
00:21:10.959 --> 00:21:14.479
we've heard about 4 different kinds of stories. It

465
00:21:14.479 --> 00:21:18.079
was either the government or the workers or the

466
00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:22.069
disruptions from the Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic

467
00:21:22.069 --> 00:21:27.500
or greedy corporations. Is any of these stories correct?

468
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.500
All of them. That's the thing, right? There's a

469
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.140
reason that you had these overlapping narratives, right? Now,

470
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.260
they're not all right in equal degree. And one

471
00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.849
of the things that came away from the book,

472
00:21:37.979 --> 00:21:39.300
we got a review of the book in the

473
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.489
Wall Street Journal from a very angry monetarist, uh,

474
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.699
who said that we were just rubbish because we

475
00:21:44.699 --> 00:21:46.939
didn't talk about money enough. And our point was,

476
00:21:46.979 --> 00:21:49.979
you know, can you cause an inflation with lax

477
00:21:49.979 --> 00:21:53.180
government spending? Absolutely. Just look at the history of

478
00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.459
Argentina, Venezuela, there's lots of places, right? Um, WERE

479
00:21:57.459 --> 00:22:01.099
monetary factors at play in many prior, uh, episodes

480
00:22:01.099 --> 00:22:04.380
of inflation. God, yeah, absolutely. But you know, alongside

481
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.099
of Milton Milton Friedman's story of, uh, of inflation

482
00:22:08.099 --> 00:22:10.619
is always in everywhere a monetary phenomena. There's a

483
00:22:10.619 --> 00:22:12.819
phrase that somebody at the Fed coined, which we

484
00:22:12.819 --> 00:22:16.099
really like, which is, uh, uh, shootings are always

485
00:22:16.099 --> 00:22:19.219
in everywhere a ballistic phenomena, which basically means, yeah,

486
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.459
sure, bullets are involved, but it doesn't tell you

487
00:22:21.459 --> 00:22:24.030
about who got shot or why. Now, it's the

488
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.510
same thing with money. Money's always involved in inflation.

489
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.150
You literally can't have an inflation without money. But

490
00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.140
was it causal? And I'll give you an example

491
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.800
of this, right? If you're in Latin America, and

492
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.739
this is pretty much the story of Latin America

493
00:22:35.739 --> 00:22:38.589
forever, right? If you're in Latin America, then you

494
00:22:38.589 --> 00:22:40.910
were put into the global economy 300 years ago

495
00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:44.130
to produce crops for the North. 70% of all

496
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.410
jobs in Latin America are still tied into commodity

497
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.209
production, and you can just very simply do what

498
00:22:49.209 --> 00:22:52.660
is it that Brazil does diversified economy, but primarily

499
00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:56.250
agricultural and commodity exports. What does Argentina do same?

500
00:22:56.329 --> 00:22:58.250
What is Chile do same? What is Peru do

501
00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.619
same, etc. ETC. RIGHT? Whether it's lithium, copper, etc.

502
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.400
SO on. Now, if that's the case and the

503
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.680
world wants what you're producing, let's say it's soy

504
00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.489
in Brazil, right? And China comes along and says,

505
00:23:09.719 --> 00:23:11.869
plant more soy, we need soil. All right, great.

506
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.760
So you plant more soy, you burn down the

507
00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.839
Amazon, you plant more soil. China goes, this is

508
00:23:15.839 --> 00:23:17.760
great, give us more soy. And eventually what happens

509
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.010
is the supply begins to outstrip the demand. And

510
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.410
eventually that becomes a liability, and eventually the price

511
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.650
crashes it's called the commodity cycle. And when that

512
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:30.290
happens, because you basically export 6 or 7 things

513
00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.810
that give you all of your foreign exchange, and

514
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:35.170
your currency is regarded as a weak currency, it's

515
00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.530
not a trading currency, then in order to do

516
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.239
your imports, you need to earn dollars and your

517
00:23:40.239 --> 00:23:42.829
exchange rates just crashed. Which means it's going to

518
00:23:42.829 --> 00:23:44.750
take more of your money to buy the same

519
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.349
amount of dollars to import everything that you need

520
00:23:47.349 --> 00:23:50.150
from drugs to computers to clothing, because you don't

521
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.609
actually make any of that stuff. So when you

522
00:23:52.609 --> 00:23:54.609
do this, what happens is suddenly you get inflation

523
00:23:54.609 --> 00:23:56.569
through the import channel. And the government has a

524
00:23:56.569 --> 00:23:59.359
choice. It can kill that inflation by raising interest

525
00:23:59.359 --> 00:24:01.290
rates, which is going to make the economic crisis

526
00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.650
is already facing worse, or it can run the

527
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.890
printing presses. So it runs the printing presses. So

528
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.319
in a sense, is that money causing an inflation?

529
00:24:09.329 --> 00:24:12.680
Well, to my point of view, the inflation started

530
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.290
because of the crash in the currency, because you

531
00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:18.010
have a commodity dependent export economy. So yes, it's

532
00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.930
involved, but it's a secondary cause rather than anything

533
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.319
else. Now to go back to the four stories,

534
00:24:23.619 --> 00:24:25.040
this is why we have to be a bit

535
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.589
more nuanced about this. It was perfectly clear that

536
00:24:27.589 --> 00:24:30.890
what happened in 2021, 2022, 23, 24 wasn't an

537
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.760
orgy of government spending. Germany on a balanced budget

538
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.680
had higher inflation in the United States. Why was

539
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.079
that? Because it was utterly dependent on Russian gas

540
00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:43.079
and the gas pipes blew up. Literally someone blew

541
00:24:43.079 --> 00:24:45.319
them up. So what you had there was a

542
00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:47.640
pure supply shock, hence the story of it's a

543
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.599
supply shock. In the United States, you had a

544
00:24:50.599 --> 00:24:52.719
bit of a supply shock with the COVID shutdown

545
00:24:52.719 --> 00:24:55.079
and supply chains. But what you began to get

546
00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:56.949
there was the story of the government spent too

547
00:24:56.949 --> 00:24:59.479
much money. Joe Biden spent all this money during

548
00:24:59.479 --> 00:25:02.119
COVID. And it's true, they spent a whopping amount

549
00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:04.349
of stuff and probably too much in terms of

550
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.760
what they actually needed to do, but they didn't

551
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.359
know if they were facing the black death. They

552
00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:11.760
didn't know if we're sending 80% of the labor

553
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.199
market home, American society would collapse, so they erred

554
00:25:14.199 --> 00:25:16.689
on the side of caution. Now, the interesting thing

555
00:25:16.689 --> 00:25:19.329
is, we decided to check out what happened to

556
00:25:19.329 --> 00:25:22.250
all those stimulus checks that Biden spent uh sent

557
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.839
out that supposedly caused its inflation. And if you

558
00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:28.079
go to the New York Fed Consumer Service survey

559
00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:30.839
of consumer finances, you find out the vast majority

560
00:25:30.839 --> 00:25:33.439
of those checks were basically spent on paying back

561
00:25:33.439 --> 00:25:36.439
credit card debt literally a month later after you

562
00:25:36.439 --> 00:25:38.150
got the check. And the rest of it, well,

563
00:25:38.229 --> 00:25:40.160
a large chunk of it went on back rent,

564
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.510
people owing rents, none of which is inherently expansionary.

565
00:25:43.719 --> 00:25:45.560
And also you've got 30 countries that are hit

566
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.239
by inflation, and only one of them is the

567
00:25:47.239 --> 00:25:50.219
Biden stimulus check. So clearly there's something more going

568
00:25:50.219 --> 00:25:53.939
on than that. Um, WHERE corporations involved in this?

569
00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:59.150
Absolutely. Isabella Weber calls this a seller's inflation. I

570
00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.670
prefer to call it, well, you would if you

571
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:05.619
could, wouldn't you inflation. Companies exist to make profit.

572
00:26:05.869 --> 00:26:09.109
If price expectations become destabilized, then I can shove

573
00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:11.270
my stuff up above what I need to do

574
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.150
to keep my margins. I can push on my

575
00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.550
margins, of course, I'm going to do it. Now,

576
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.430
economic theory will say, but if you do that,

577
00:26:17.589 --> 00:26:19.630
someone else won't do that, and they'll have cheaper

578
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:22.500
prices and they'll capture the market. Yes, but most

579
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.819
of our markets don't look anything like a perfectly

580
00:26:24.819 --> 00:26:27.979
competitive market in the textbooks. So for example, why

581
00:26:27.979 --> 00:26:30.859
is it that Canadian egg prices were always $2

582
00:26:30.859 --> 00:26:33.380
cheaper than American egg prices, even though they both

583
00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.380
had bird flu? Well, America has over 10,000 producers

584
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.939
of eggs, all of whom get squeezed by essentially

585
00:26:39.939 --> 00:26:43.109
two companies that buy them. Now, with those companies.

586
00:26:43.165 --> 00:26:46.204
GOING to basically undercut each other to supply the

587
00:26:46.204 --> 00:26:48.454
egg market cheaply at that moment, or are they

588
00:26:48.454 --> 00:26:50.795
going to basically try and sell you $10 eggs

589
00:26:50.795 --> 00:26:52.834
and reap the profits? Of course they're going to

590
00:26:52.834 --> 00:26:55.314
do that. Why would we expect anything else? But

591
00:26:55.314 --> 00:26:57.385
the important caveat on this, and this is what

592
00:26:57.385 --> 00:27:00.109
the people who talk about sellers inflation say. This

593
00:27:00.109 --> 00:27:03.469
doesn't cause inflation, this accelerates it. It has to

594
00:27:03.469 --> 00:27:06.510
start from another cause. And what happened was supply

595
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:10.270
shocks primarily, right? Then on top of that, destabilize

596
00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.829
the expectations and then you get this effect from

597
00:27:12.829 --> 00:27:17.560
corporations. Not just my opinion. European Central Bank estimated

598
00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.959
40% of the inflation of the Eurozone in 2022

599
00:27:20.959 --> 00:27:23.719
was companies pushing up prices. Now, can they do

600
00:27:23.719 --> 00:27:26.540
this forever? No, markets are kind of clever that

601
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.839
way. Eventually things will basically sort themselves out. If

602
00:27:29.839 --> 00:27:32.510
you consistently try and squeeze people, they will find

603
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:35.574
alternate suppliers. That will basically change the structure of

604
00:27:35.574 --> 00:27:38.494
the market and prices will become more reasonable over

605
00:27:38.494 --> 00:27:41.724
time. But ask anyone who's still doing shopping today,

606
00:27:42.015 --> 00:27:43.844
have prices gone down to where they were in

607
00:27:43.844 --> 00:27:48.015
2021? Not even close. And yet, supposedly, all of

608
00:27:48.015 --> 00:27:49.935
that has disappeared. Well, that has to have an

609
00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:52.895
explanation other than the government spent some money.

610
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:59.469
Right. So what is then hyperinflation and how does

611
00:27:59.469 --> 00:28:01.859
it happen? And, and do you think that there's

612
00:28:01.859 --> 00:28:08.949
actually any risk of the current inflation situation turning

613
00:28:08.949 --> 00:28:11.069
into hyperinflation or not?

614
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.709
So we did a whole separate chapter on hyperinflation

615
00:28:13.709 --> 00:28:15.790
and we looked at some classic episodes of this

616
00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:19.869
Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, and Weimar, Germany in the 1920s.

617
00:28:20.239 --> 00:28:22.650
And what's clear from this, and other people have

618
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.489
pointed this out as well, it's not, it's not

619
00:28:24.489 --> 00:28:27.579
that, uh, it's not a controversial finding. Steve Hanke,

620
00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:31.489
who's the sort of economist, a monetary economist at

621
00:28:31.489 --> 00:28:33.770
Johns Hopkins years ago in 1985 did a big

622
00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:38.500
survey, uh, of hyperinflations. And basically hyperinflation is when

623
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.569
everything is broken. Like when nothing works, and all

624
00:28:42.569 --> 00:28:44.849
you do is run the presses because that's what

625
00:28:44.849 --> 00:28:47.010
you've got left. So to go back to that

626
00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.170
example of Latin America. What happens to Argentina and

627
00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:52.869
places like this all the time is essentially that

628
00:28:52.869 --> 00:28:55.969
their their currency is tied to commodities, the commodity

629
00:28:55.969 --> 00:28:59.170
price crashes, the currency crashes, they need more dollars

630
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.449
for their imports, and they're on the printing presses

631
00:29:01.449 --> 00:29:03.609
to, to pay for it. That that's it. It's

632
00:29:03.609 --> 00:29:05.969
that simple. That's how you get into cycles of

633
00:29:05.969 --> 00:29:09.569
hyperinflation. But more seriously, when you take places like

634
00:29:09.569 --> 00:29:14.079
Venezuela, um, you essentially export one commodity, oil. And

635
00:29:14.079 --> 00:29:18.170
you simultaneously basically have a political revolution that promises

636
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:21.599
massive redistribution to your constituents, uh, on the back

637
00:29:21.599 --> 00:29:24.800
of oil prices which have just collapsed. And then

638
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.199
you essentially scare off all the people who actually

639
00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:29.280
know how to run an oil company, and you

640
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.790
fill it with your friends. That's not gonna end

641
00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.390
well, that's basically what happened, right? Um, Zimbabwe, I

642
00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.550
mean, if everything could go wrong, it did go

643
00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.989
wrong, they end up embroiled in wars in the

644
00:29:39.989 --> 00:29:44.670
1990s. They ended up trying to, uh, redistribute land

645
00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:46.949
in such a way that it was so economically

646
00:29:46.949 --> 00:29:49.390
inefficient in terms of the small parcel size that

647
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.890
no farmers ended up with. So not only did

648
00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.829
they not know how to do this because there's

649
00:29:53.829 --> 00:29:56.395
a skill deficit, what you also up with the

650
00:29:56.395 --> 00:29:59.145
banks weren't able to actually use the land as

651
00:29:59.145 --> 00:30:01.956
collateral to extend credit. So the government gets into

652
00:30:01.956 --> 00:30:03.715
the market to do this and then extends it

653
00:30:03.715 --> 00:30:06.375
to people who actually can't really farm at scale,

654
00:30:06.635 --> 00:30:10.796
just problem after problem after problem. It it's state

655
00:30:10.796 --> 00:30:14.495
failure. You, you get hyperinflation when the state falls

656
00:30:14.495 --> 00:30:18.442
apart. That's basically it. Or alternative. You have one

657
00:30:18.442 --> 00:30:23.041
of these highly volatile commodity dependent currencies. That's, that's

658
00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:26.322
the history of hyperinflation. Now, does that characterize any

659
00:30:26.322 --> 00:30:28.082
place like, you know, I don't know, the United

660
00:30:28.082 --> 00:30:33.241
States? No. China, no, um, anywhere in Western Europe,

661
00:30:33.322 --> 00:30:36.121
Eastern Europe, no. Um, SO, you know, when do

662
00:30:36.121 --> 00:30:40.930
these places get hyperinflation after wars. After World War

663
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.920
One, when they don't fight the war by raising

664
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.040
taxes, and they basically have issued a whole bunch

665
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.400
of debt and the debt goes bad. Simple. It's

666
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.400
all about state failure.

667
00:30:53.829 --> 00:30:56.589
So, uh, but I mean, about the second part

668
00:30:56.589 --> 00:30:58.800
of my question, do you think that there's any

669
00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:03.680
risk that the, uh, inflation we are experiencing could

670
00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.469
spiral into hype,

671
00:31:05.839 --> 00:31:07.949
because that's the point that it's not a spiral,

672
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.510
right? It's not a slippery slope. That's the mistake.

673
00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.400
People that you get a little bit of inflation,

674
00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:13.709
you get a little bit more, you get more.

675
00:31:13.839 --> 00:31:15.619
And like if you run a kind of Straight

676
00:31:15.619 --> 00:31:18.609
expectations model on this. It's kind of weird because

677
00:31:18.609 --> 00:31:20.339
people are meant to have far-sighted what it's called

678
00:31:20.339 --> 00:31:23.300
rational expectations. And if they actually have rational expectations,

679
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.900
they would know that what they're seeing is a

680
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.180
supply shock. They wouldn't become confused. There wouldn't be

681
00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.020
any inflation in the first place because it wouldn't

682
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.229
get de-anchored. Given the fact that prices are rising,

683
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.140
clearly either that mechanism is wrong or we're missing

684
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.339
a beat in this sort of thing. And that

685
00:31:37.339 --> 00:31:39.780
suggests to me that basically it's not really about

686
00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.479
expectation that people begin to say, next month, everything

687
00:31:42.479 --> 00:31:45.180
will be worth 1000 times less, right? It's just

688
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.099
the fact that basically the supply chains that supply

689
00:31:48.099 --> 00:31:50.609
really basic things in the economy no longer work,

690
00:31:50.959 --> 00:31:54.140
and prices go up and people try and adapt

691
00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.099
to that. So again, it's not like a spiral

692
00:31:57.099 --> 00:32:00.449
of expectations where 2% goes to 4%, 4 goes

693
00:32:00.449 --> 00:32:02.300
to 88 goes to 16, and you get this

694
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.619
geometric series. What happens is it's relatively stable, it

695
00:32:05.619 --> 00:32:08.219
gets a bit high, and then it becomes astronomical

696
00:32:08.219 --> 00:32:11.069
because the basic institutions that make market economies and

697
00:32:11.069 --> 00:32:12.420
states work are falling apart.

698
00:32:13.369 --> 00:32:18.430
Mhm. Is it possible to predict inflation, uh, and

699
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:21.219
why didn't we see this inflation coming?

700
00:32:22.449 --> 00:32:25.459
Um, SO the way that we approach this in

701
00:32:25.459 --> 00:32:28.359
the book is to sort of say, OK, uh,

702
00:32:28.699 --> 00:32:31.380
the 1970s playbook, we learned a lot from the

703
00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.530
1970s, not sure that we learned the right things.

704
00:32:34.979 --> 00:32:37.339
So first of all, you need to have a

705
00:32:37.339 --> 00:32:41.099
huge rise in interest rates to cross inflation. None

706
00:32:41.099 --> 00:32:43.180
of the central banks did this this time because

707
00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:46.260
they knew that after a decade of austerity in

708
00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.890
Europe, in particular, lost growth and rising populism, if

709
00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.459
they just decided to make 10 to 15% of

710
00:32:52.459 --> 00:32:55.380
the population unemployed to save the value of financial

711
00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.369
assets, they would have burned the central bank down.

712
00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.300
So, you know, there's no way that this was

713
00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.569
going to happen, right? So that's, that's point number

714
00:33:02.569 --> 00:33:06.349
one. Um, POINT number 2, the inflation in the

715
00:33:06.349 --> 00:33:09.270
1970s, was it really a monetary phenomenon was in

716
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:12.670
everywhere? Well, Alan Blinder, who's a central banker and

717
00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:15.459
economics professor at Princeton, he's done a whole series

718
00:33:15.459 --> 00:33:17.510
of papers on this over the past 30 years,

719
00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.859
basically saying, no, it was all just supply shocks.

720
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:21.979
And if you think about it that way, then,

721
00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:23.709
you know, they're much more like what happened in

722
00:33:23.709 --> 00:33:25.910
2021. It's just that there was a decade of

723
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.030
interlinked supply shocks in the late 60s and the

724
00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:31.229
70s. Uh AND we interpreted this as a monetary

725
00:33:31.229 --> 00:33:33.390
shock when in fact, you know, it probably wasn't.

726
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:36.189
I'm quite sympathetic to that view. So if that's

727
00:33:36.189 --> 00:33:38.790
the case, should we take the playbook of the

728
00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:42.219
70s and apply it? Well, in a sense, that's

729
00:33:42.219 --> 00:33:44.390
what we did. We relied on the central banks,

730
00:33:44.469 --> 00:33:46.890
we raised interest rates. Uh, AND in that sense,

731
00:33:46.969 --> 00:33:49.119
you know, the people who are charged with looking

732
00:33:49.119 --> 00:33:52.329
out for inflation, as always in everywhere a monetary

733
00:33:52.329 --> 00:33:55.810
phenomena were genuinely surprised because it came from non-monetary

734
00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:59.459
sources, blowing up a pipeline and a pandemic, right?

735
00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.410
But at the same time, were they totally surprised

736
00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:06.209
by it in the sense that they clearly didn't

737
00:34:06.209 --> 00:34:08.370
know what to do. Well, the fact that they

738
00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.330
didn't push interest rates all the way up like

739
00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.290
they did in the early 1980s suggests to me

740
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.639
that they had been reading their own research over

741
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:17.760
the prior 10 years. And what that research had

742
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.239
shown is that inflation didn't seem to be anywhere

743
00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:23.449
for a very long time. The so-called Phillips curve,

744
00:34:23.918 --> 00:34:27.120
which basically charts the relationship between unemployment and inflation

745
00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.120
and kind of as a measure of capacity of

746
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.310
the economy is a thing called the Nehru, uh,

747
00:34:31.438 --> 00:34:34.360
all that sort of stuff was basically either flat

748
00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.560
or jumping around all over the place. You could

749
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.560
have any level of unemployment you want at a

750
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.040
constant level of inflation over a 20 year period

751
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.010
in a lot of countries. So it kind of

752
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.120
made them think that inflation, you know, was gone.

753
00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:48.969
And if you have a 1970s story of it's

754
00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:51.570
always about money, and you're looking at money and

755
00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.850
money's not doing much, then it's quite reasonable not

756
00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:56.449
to expect inflation. The surprise was the fact that

757
00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:59.689
it came from primarily non-monetary sources in this instance.

758
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:03.709
So, the subtitle of your book is a guide

759
00:35:03.709 --> 00:35:08.350
for users and losers. So does inflation affect everyone

760
00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:12.959
equally or who are the actual winners and losers

761
00:35:12.959 --> 00:35:13.840
of inflation?

762
00:35:14.739 --> 00:35:16.629
So this is again to go back to that

763
00:35:16.629 --> 00:35:18.419
first point that Nick said when he walked into

764
00:35:18.419 --> 00:35:21.669
the office about monetary austerity, who actually wins and

765
00:35:21.669 --> 00:35:24.030
who actually loses, and I've mentioned some of this

766
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.500
already. You're in the bottom 20% of the income

767
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.949
distribution, you spend 80% of your paycheck on consumption

768
00:35:29.949 --> 00:35:33.310
goods. That's what gets hit when prices go up.

769
00:35:33.669 --> 00:35:35.949
So that's hugely serious for you. Same in the

770
00:35:35.949 --> 00:35:38.879
bottom 40%. If you're in the top 1%, you're

771
00:35:38.879 --> 00:35:41.280
getting windfall gains from the fact that you own

772
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.239
oil stocks. So there's a hugely different experience of

773
00:35:45.239 --> 00:35:47.639
inflation. And it's not that we all suffer from

774
00:35:47.639 --> 00:35:50.270
inflation, as people like to say, we simply don't.

775
00:35:50.399 --> 00:35:53.159
Some of us benefit from inflation, and we benefit

776
00:35:53.159 --> 00:35:55.280
in weird and unexpected ways. So let me give

777
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.479
you one story from Scotland about this. And this

778
00:35:58.479 --> 00:36:00.350
is a great story of like why it's difficult

779
00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:04.610
to do controls and unintended consequences. So Edinburgh has

780
00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:08.399
very expensive rents because, uh, in part it looks

781
00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:10.840
like Harry Potter land and that's where JK Rowling

782
00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.280
wrote all the books and it's got loads of

783
00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.280
tourists. Consequently, about a large part of the city

784
00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.610
is all Airbnb rentals. Now there's still some places

785
00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:21.260
where normal people can rent houses and students can

786
00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.600
rent apartments and so on and so forth, but

787
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.699
it's pretty constricted. It's already quite expensive. So the

788
00:36:26.699 --> 00:36:28.820
Scottish government said quite reasonably, all right, for as

789
00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.060
long as this pandemic's on, nobody gets to get

790
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.020
thrown out of their of their apartment, right? We're

791
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:38.040
basically saying a moratorium on evictions. And that meant

792
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.060
that basically this could continue for a couple of

793
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.500
years. If you're a landlord, you've got people in

794
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.989
there, they might already, they might not be good

795
00:36:44.989 --> 00:36:47.300
tenants, they might not be paying you. You're basically

796
00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.939
now stuck with the bill, uh, or alternatively, you

797
00:36:49.939 --> 00:36:51.939
know, you make your living off of real estate

798
00:36:51.939 --> 00:36:53.620
and the government just said to you, you're not

799
00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.340
making your living off of real estate, you're providing

800
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:58.260
a social service. And those landlords said, all right,

801
00:36:58.379 --> 00:37:01.600
so how's the legislation written? OK. It doesn't apply

802
00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.600
to super short term rentals. Guess what happened? They

803
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.239
used every trick in the book to get people

804
00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:07.830
out and turned even more of the place into

805
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.800
Airbnbs. What did that do? It constricted the supply

806
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.159
of actual rentals and prices went up 30% in

807
00:37:13.159 --> 00:37:17.639
two years. So it completely blew back in that

808
00:37:17.639 --> 00:37:20.360
way, right? So who benefited here? A very small

809
00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.320
group of landlords defending their interests and their profits,

810
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.790
who suffered because of this? Everybody who rents. Right,

811
00:37:27.949 --> 00:37:30.149
so the idea again that we all suffer from

812
00:37:30.149 --> 00:37:32.030
this just isn't the case. Now, you could say

813
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.110
that was bad policy design, they shouldn't have tried

814
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.389
to do, uh, controls, but if they hadn't, it

815
00:37:37.389 --> 00:37:39.510
still would have been that asymmetry between those who

816
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.909
own the asset that everybody needs and those who

817
00:37:41.909 --> 00:37:45.070
basically have incomes that are buffeted by inflation. So

818
00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:48.659
that distributional trade-off is still there. Um, OTHER ones,

819
00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.330
um, people may want to think about how much

820
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.260
they didn't get from their bank because of the

821
00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.820
inflation. And what I mean is, most people have

822
00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.820
what the US call a checking account for day

823
00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.699
to day transactions and a savings account which pays

824
00:38:00.699 --> 00:38:04.620
basically almost nothing. So you get 1%, 2% in

825
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.300
your in your account. Well, interest rates went to

826
00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:12.050
4.5, 5% in some places. So in theory then,

827
00:38:12.179 --> 00:38:14.419
what should happen is that interest rate rises, what's

828
00:38:14.419 --> 00:38:16.580
called the interest rate margin. Some of that should

829
00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.969
be passed on to the depositors in the bank.

830
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.090
And if they don't, that means the bank's taking

831
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.560
it as a windfall profit. The banks took it

832
00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.020
as a windfall profit, so much so that Italy

833
00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.419
tried to tax that back as a windfall to

834
00:38:28.419 --> 00:38:30.979
varying degrees of success, but essentially what it meant

835
00:38:30.979 --> 00:38:33.500
was the banks benefited from rising interest rates and

836
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.020
the people who fund the bank, at least notion

837
00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:39.959
like the depositors, really didn't benefit from it. Uh,

838
00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.040
I'll close with my favorite example of this is

839
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.520
who, who, who benefits from this, uh, Cristiano Ronaldo.

840
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.199
Because during this period, this is when the Saudis

841
00:38:49.199 --> 00:38:52.040
had so much money from their carbon oil profits

842
00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.139
going up, that they set up the Saudi Pro

843
00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:56.760
League, and they bought stars from all over the

844
00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.800
world, most notably Cristiano Ronaldo, pay them absurd amounts

845
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.879
of money to play in a league that nobody

846
00:39:01.879 --> 00:39:05.209
cares about. And you can do that because you're

847
00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:08.649
the one that's benefiting from these windfall profits. So

848
00:39:08.649 --> 00:39:10.810
basically the last chapter of the book is about

849
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:12.570
who wins and who loses, and it turns out

850
00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.889
quite a lot of people win. And the losses

851
00:39:14.889 --> 00:39:17.860
as ever are very, very concentrated, and the standard

852
00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.169
story is completely correct. It's people in the bottom

853
00:39:20.169 --> 00:39:21.969
end of the income distribution who get hurt the

854
00:39:21.969 --> 00:39:22.320
most.

855
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:28.909
So since just recently Trump implemented these tariffs across

856
00:39:28.909 --> 00:39:31.840
the world, this is a very relevant topic to

857
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.080
ask you about. What are the effects of tariffs

858
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.250
and trade wars on inflation?

859
00:39:38.129 --> 00:39:40.270
So it's actually it's much harder to predict and

860
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.350
people think, because, you know, we think about this

861
00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:44.350
in a very textbook way, a tariff is a

862
00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:46.669
tax. Somebody has to pay the tax. It's a

863
00:39:46.669 --> 00:39:48.830
combination of the export of the import and the

864
00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:52.030
consumer. Therefore, that will either hit consumption and our

865
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.270
prices will go up. That's the standard story, makes

866
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:57.149
perfect sense. But the thing is, we make things

867
00:39:57.149 --> 00:40:00.110
on a global basis, and we sell and swap

868
00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:03.669
them around on a global basis. And parts travel

869
00:40:03.669 --> 00:40:06.389
across borders multiple times. So for example, car parts

870
00:40:06.389 --> 00:40:08.389
in the United States that are made in Canada

871
00:40:08.389 --> 00:40:11.149
go across the border multiple times, they're tariff multiple

872
00:40:11.149 --> 00:40:14.030
times. That's why firms like GM are taking enormous

873
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:16.189
hits just now because of the tariffs. They're trying

874
00:40:16.189 --> 00:40:18.350
to hold the line on this. Like I said,

875
00:40:18.429 --> 00:40:20.500
corporate profits have really been high for a long

876
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.629
time. They can afford to take a hit, particularly

877
00:40:22.629 --> 00:40:25.270
in some sectors rather than others. But we haven't

878
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.425
seen it show up in that one. One translation.

879
00:40:27.584 --> 00:40:30.225
Why? Because, you know, economics works with this thing

880
00:40:30.225 --> 00:40:33.574
called the Ketteris paribus clause, all things remaining equal.

881
00:40:33.824 --> 00:40:36.425
And in a global economy that's highly dynamic, nothing

882
00:40:36.425 --> 00:40:40.425
ever remains equal. People adjust. Sometimes the exchange rate

883
00:40:40.425 --> 00:40:42.004
will take a bit of a hit, sometimes the

884
00:40:42.004 --> 00:40:43.824
importer will take a bit of a hit, sometimes

885
00:40:43.824 --> 00:40:46.864
the exporter will find somewhere else to ship it

886
00:40:46.864 --> 00:40:49.534
through. There's lots of ways in which this doesn't

887
00:40:49.534 --> 00:40:52.010
have that one on one translation. Now, will it

888
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.570
eventually show up in lower consumption or higher prices?

889
00:40:54.669 --> 00:40:57.810
Yes, because the government's making $300 billion or whatever

890
00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:00.729
it is in tariffs over the 6 months they've

891
00:41:00.729 --> 00:41:02.530
been in, or maybe it's a month or something

892
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:04.239
crazy like this. I don't know what the latest

893
00:41:04.239 --> 00:41:06.649
estimates are, but they're making hundreds of billions of

894
00:41:06.649 --> 00:41:09.399
dollars, which means that someone else isn't. And if

895
00:41:09.399 --> 00:41:11.760
those people want to maintain their profit margins and

896
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.439
continue to produce and continue to employ people, prices

897
00:41:14.439 --> 00:41:16.399
are going to have to go up somewhere. So

898
00:41:16.399 --> 00:41:18.699
one way to think about tariffs is it's basically

899
00:41:18.699 --> 00:41:22.280
a policy induced supply shock, which will have inflationary

900
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:22.780
qualities.

901
00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:29.280
Is our future going to be more inflationary or

902
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.330
can we return to low inflation?

903
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.350
So there's two big forces at work here, and

904
00:41:36.639 --> 00:41:39.370
rather than sort of focusing on central banks who

905
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.439
have been, you know, the guardians of monetary discipline

906
00:41:42.439 --> 00:41:44.080
for the past 30 years and saying that's what

907
00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.320
caused low prices, um, I'm, I'm sure that's implicated

908
00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.280
in it. But another one is a very simple

909
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.879
one, was China joined the global economy and half

910
00:41:51.879 --> 00:41:54.639
a billion people added to the global labor supply.

911
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.719
At the same time as we had an IT

912
00:41:56.719 --> 00:42:00.419
revolution and a container ship revolution, which meant that

913
00:42:00.419 --> 00:42:03.629
along with inventory control and just in time manufacturing,

914
00:42:03.959 --> 00:42:06.360
prices went down, down, down, down, down for a

915
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.399
very long time. Many of those forces now because

916
00:42:09.399 --> 00:42:12.959
of geopolitics, because of tariffs, uh, simply because of

917
00:42:12.959 --> 00:42:15.840
Chinese people are getting richer, um, those prices are

918
00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.879
going back up. So we live through this 30

919
00:42:17.879 --> 00:42:19.919
year period of very, very low prices and very

920
00:42:19.919 --> 00:42:23.659
low inflation, that might be reversing. On the other

921
00:42:23.659 --> 00:42:26.389
hand, capitalism is essentially on a micro level on

922
00:42:26.389 --> 00:42:29.189
a macro level of deflation machine. We don't think

923
00:42:29.189 --> 00:42:31.419
about this because everyone's always worried about inflation, but

924
00:42:31.419 --> 00:42:32.979
it's kind of a weird way of thinking about

925
00:42:32.979 --> 00:42:35.260
it. We give an example in the book of

926
00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.899
a car called the Golf Volkswagen Golf GTI, and

927
00:42:38.899 --> 00:42:42.860
it came in in 1978, cost about 10,000 pounds

928
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.080
in British pounds, $16,000 or whatever. And back then,

929
00:42:47.159 --> 00:42:49.120
you know, great car, but like, you know, barely

930
00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.199
had seat belts, didn't have airbags. There's no ABS.

931
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.639
There's no computer. Don't even know if I ever

932
00:42:54.639 --> 00:42:56.750
had central air conditioning at that point in time.

933
00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.760
The car you get now is like incredible in

934
00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.560
comparison. It's more powerful, it's safer, it has all

935
00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.560
these gadgets, all the rest of it. And if

936
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.600
you basically put it in $1978 it's a 3%

937
00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.459
cheaper. Now why is that? Because lots of other

938
00:43:10.459 --> 00:43:13.800
people make good cars too. And that creates competition

939
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.199
and competition lowers prices, and that means that overtime

940
00:43:17.199 --> 00:43:19.600
prices go down. So on a micro level, capitalism,

941
00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:22.239
the deflation machine. On a macro level, this is

942
00:43:22.239 --> 00:43:24.760
also true. Why? Because companies would countries would rather

943
00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.840
be exporters rather than importers, wrongheaded, but that's the

944
00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.229
way they do it. So the world basically has,

945
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.179
since the East Asian financial crisis, most of East

946
00:43:33.179 --> 00:43:37.229
Asia exports. Uh, Japan's historically an exporter, even though

947
00:43:37.229 --> 00:43:39.790
it's a large economy. Uh, China, even though it's

948
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:43.020
a very, the largest economy, is a massive exporter,

949
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:45.429
and, uh, the people who do the imports are

950
00:43:45.429 --> 00:43:47.510
basically the Anglo countries on the other side of

951
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:49.709
the trade. And for a long time, those low

952
00:43:49.709 --> 00:43:52.850
prices coexist. IN a kind of, uh, if you

953
00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:56.530
will, social bargain, which was we'll shove our manufacturing

954
00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.790
over there where it's cheap. We get low prices

955
00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:00.969
for our consumers, which is equivalent to a wage

956
00:44:00.969 --> 00:44:02.969
rise without having to give them a wage rise

957
00:44:02.969 --> 00:44:04.770
while we take all the profits, right? That was

958
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:07.570
basically the bargain that was made. And you know,

959
00:44:07.689 --> 00:44:09.409
when you're in that position, if you're one of

960
00:44:09.409 --> 00:44:12.830
these countries. Um, PARTICULARLY after the East Asian financial

961
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:15.429
crisis when the IMF roughed them up, they all

962
00:44:15.429 --> 00:44:18.110
decided that they wanted to have big reserves to

963
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.790
protect themselves. How do you protect yourself? You basically

964
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:23.870
run an export surplus. Europe runs an export surplus

965
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.629
via Germany, China runs an export surplus. So what

966
00:44:26.629 --> 00:44:29.070
happens if everybody's trying to export and then there's

967
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:31.030
only a couple of countries that do the imports.

968
00:44:31.189 --> 00:44:33.149
Prices have to fall, you've got too much supply.

969
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.429
Right, so there's an inherent deflationary tendency of the

970
00:44:36.429 --> 00:44:38.350
global economy. Now what's on the other side that

971
00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:41.149
could change this? One is Chinese labor is no

972
00:44:41.149 --> 00:44:43.790
longer cheap. That's part of the argument of Charles

973
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.709
Goodhart. Another one that Charles Goodhart points out is

974
00:44:46.709 --> 00:44:49.780
demography. That basically we're shifting in such a way

975
00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.939
now that, uh, essentially as populations get older, there's

976
00:44:52.939 --> 00:44:55.810
less younger people to work for them, high social

977
00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:58.739
wages, etc. IN the form of pensions, etc. All

978
00:44:58.739 --> 00:45:01.090
of that's going to be inflationary in some sense,

979
00:45:01.379 --> 00:45:03.540
all of which is probably true. But the other

980
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.409
one that we're not thinking about is climate change,

981
00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.419
that essentially, once you basically bust through some of

982
00:45:08.419 --> 00:45:12.139
the critical limits. 1.5, 2 degrees. Food webs come

983
00:45:12.139 --> 00:45:15.810
under pressure. Um, SUPPLY chains will not be able

984
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:19.379
to adapt rapidly. Simple examples, the Po Valley in

985
00:45:19.379 --> 00:45:22.739
Italy is drying out, Spain's drying out. Scotland had

986
00:45:22.739 --> 00:45:24.899
wildfires. I know people like to point out that

987
00:45:24.899 --> 00:45:27.060
no, it's not, it's arsonists. It's like, look, there's

988
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.469
no arsonists in the north of Canada where nobody

989
00:45:29.469 --> 00:45:32.580
lives in these huge wildfires, right? So the climate

990
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.810
is actually changing whether we like it or not,

991
00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:38.459
and that's going to have very, very interesting supply

992
00:45:38.459 --> 00:45:41.770
shock effects. Now, the Potsdam Institute on Climate Research

993
00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:43.889
has already done estimates on this, and we include

994
00:45:43.889 --> 00:45:45.800
them in the book. It came out just before

995
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.250
we went to press, and their estimate that it's

996
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.610
already pushing up food prices by 2 to 3%

997
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:53.050
a year across the globe. Some places much more

998
00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:55.889
affected by others. So we have these two forces

999
00:45:55.889 --> 00:45:59.250
basically trading off against each other. One is essentially

1000
00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.770
sort of the inherently deflationary tendencies of capitalism, and

1001
00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:06.340
the other one is basically climate change, demography, and

1002
00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:09.699
technology shocks all pushing in another direction. So, if

1003
00:46:09.699 --> 00:46:11.020
I had to put my heart on it, I

1004
00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.899
think that we had a 30 year period of

1005
00:46:12.899 --> 00:46:15.300
exceptionally low inflation, and now we're back to a

1006
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.300
much more normal and accelerating a much more normal

1007
00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.530
world, which is actually an accelerating period of inflation,

1008
00:46:22.739 --> 00:46:25.979
not to hyperinflation, but just inflationary spurts because of

1009
00:46:25.979 --> 00:46:26.780
supply shocks.

1010
00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:30.750
So one last question then, is there anything that

1011
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:33.979
people should do to prepare for the future?

1012
00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:38.989
That's a huge question that goes far beyond anything

1013
00:46:38.989 --> 00:46:40.750
I can usefully say in a couple of minutes

1014
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:44.649
or even as regards the book, I mean. It's

1015
00:46:44.649 --> 00:46:46.409
very hard to say, it's not something that's solved

1016
00:46:46.409 --> 00:46:48.649
on an individual level basis because it's kind of

1017
00:46:48.649 --> 00:46:52.050
a systemic property, right? So you could say, OK,

1018
00:46:52.129 --> 00:46:53.370
if I think the world's going to be more

1019
00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:55.560
inflationary, what should I do? I should buy gold,

1020
00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:58.600
right? I should buy Bitcoin, which is digital gold.

1021
00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:01.489
I should buy houses because people always need houses.

1022
00:47:01.649 --> 00:47:04.719
And, and none of these strategies are probably wrong,

1023
00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:07.449
but, you know, is that actually really protecting us

1024
00:47:07.449 --> 00:47:11.560
against what the ultimate underlying problem might be, which

1025
00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.889
is We've all gotten a little bit tired of

1026
00:47:14.889 --> 00:47:17.370
net zero goals. We don't want to think about

1027
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:20.879
the green stuff anymore. Electricity is too expensive as

1028
00:47:20.879 --> 00:47:24.649
it is. Nobody likes windmills. The Americans are turning

1029
00:47:24.649 --> 00:47:27.500
against green tech massively at the same time as

1030
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.489
China's doubling down on it. These are the forces

1031
00:47:30.489 --> 00:47:32.290
that are really going to shape the world. Inflation

1032
00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:34.399
is going to be a byproduct of these things,

1033
00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:37.169
and it's very hard for people to control those

1034
00:47:37.169 --> 00:47:40.209
things on an individual level. So I would say

1035
00:47:40.209 --> 00:47:44.070
basically, Don't keep your savings in cash, try and

1036
00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:46.750
diversify, make sure you got a house, and that's

1037
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:48.669
a tall order in most countries these days.

1038
00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.949
Mhm. OK, great. So the book is again inflation,

1039
00:47:52.959 --> 00:47:55.879
a guide for users and losers. I'm, of course,

1040
