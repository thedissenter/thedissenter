Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the Decent.

1
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.599
I'm your host as always Ricardo

2
00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.449
Loops. And today I'm joined by Doctor Claudio 10.

3
00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.979
He is a tenured research group leader in the Department

4
00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:17.139
of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology at the University of

5
00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:17.940
Tubingen.

6
00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:19.979
This is our second interview.

7
00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.690
I'm leaving the link to our first one in the description box.

8
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.979
Uh And today we're going to talk basically about

9
00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.579
the differences between ape culture and human culture.

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.900
So, Doctor 10 Year, welcome back to the show. It's always a pleasure to talk to you.

11
00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:38.590
It's a great pleasure to talk to you and thank

12
00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:40.279
you very much for having me a second time.

13
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.700
Thanks,

14
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.159
great. So OK, let's perhaps start with some basics here.

15
00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:52.819
Uh How would you define ape culture? What is ape culture?

16
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.770
Right?

17
00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.029
Yeah. Well, uh ape culture would be cultures

18
00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:59.599
um shown by apes.

19
00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.290
But when we talk about culture generally,

20
00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.430
and this is uh always news for newcomers to the field. At first,

21
00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:09.709
it turns out that culture is quite a slippery fish.

22
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.720
It's quite difficult to uh measure it to, to really get hold of uh culture generally,

23
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.809
not just in apes

24
00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:18.800
anywhere.

25
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.169
And um to see why that is, you know, we can imagine that we can measure genes, you know,

26
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.410
the existence of genes.

27
00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:27.000
Anyway,

28
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.230
um what to make with this data is a different matter.

29
00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:32.559
But we can measure them, you know, we can find them

30
00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:34.160
same for environment.

31
00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:38.410
You know, we can measure the temperature somewhere, we can measure the humidity,

32
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.849
uh someplace and so on.

33
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.879
But with culture, it is difficult, it continues to be difficult to really measure

34
00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:49.959
our culture. Culture is something that happens out in the world

35
00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:54.599
sometimes stays out in the world such as cultural artifacts and so on.

36
00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:59.279
But it is also something that is very much in minds in brains.

37
00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.080
And we don't have very good means to get to these brains, you know, uh

38
00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.910
it's not something that I personally do, for example.

39
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.690
So the general approach had been then in the past,

40
00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:15.990
in order to try to pinpoint culture is to take away

41
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.860
the signal and the factors from other um uh areas. So, for example, to try to find,

42
00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.380
if you control for, if you measure and,

43
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.869
and um adjust for genetic differences,

44
00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:33.500
and if you measure and control

45
00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.770
for environmental differences between populations,

46
00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:38.880
if you do both of these things,

47
00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.940
the idea is that what is left over, if there is some difference,

48
00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:45.539
still left over between these populations,

49
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.990
that you can call that difference

50
00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:49.419
um cut.

51
00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:54.070
So it's an approach that the philosophers call an X Negativo

52
00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:55.000
approach.

53
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.960
It's basically defining

54
00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:58.600
uh something by

55
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.669
uh the absence of all the other things. Um And that is what, what culture has been

56
00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.699
uh come to be seen. And also in the apes,

57
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.300
I can talk more later, maybe about this,

58
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:14.550
but population differences between apes that are not very

59
00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:19.720
obviously linked to genetic differences and um environmental differences,

60
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.270
that's what people call ape culture.

61
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.820
Uh And so, uh I would imagine that we can study ape culture through different means.

62
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.520
So I guess that perhaps some aspects of it could be studied

63
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.300
in the lab, but we can also study ape culture in the wild. So,

64
00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:42.369
um

65
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.470
uh what do we know about wild ape culture?

66
00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:51.990
And is it similar or different to human culture?

67
00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:56.789
Yes. So wild ape culture is a prototypical case

68
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.410
of ape culture. Wild ape culture is what most people focus on. Really

69
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.100
when you,

70
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.089
when you open up your TV channel and you

71
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.539
see David Attenborough come up and talk about,

72
00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:11.320
I don't know chimpanzee nut cracking or something and so on.

73
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.850
And then they would invariably talk about some culture

74
00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.649
there.

75
00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:19.769
That's what they are ultimately uh on about, they talk about these

76
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.549
dissimilarities between populations and they call that

77
00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:26.170
um culture.

78
00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:27.730
And again, uh

79
00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:30.489
when, when you ask about the similarities, now,

80
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.049
now we get into the topic of what we are talking about today.

81
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.750
Um The similarities uh there is some similarity in

82
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.679
the sense that indeed we also see in humans,

83
00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:44.929
population differences, right,

84
00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:48.170
the way that I eat uh rice might be

85
00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:51.149
different to how some other people and some other populations

86
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.029
eat rice. Right? So there are some differences

87
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.619
and these differences can indeed be meaningfully linked

88
00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:03.429
to some cultural processes. So on that level, on the surface level,

89
00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:05.649
we are dealing with a similar phenomenon,

90
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.959
we are dealing with population differences.

91
00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:12.309
And by the way, if somebody were to say this is a cultural difference, you know,

92
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.989
on this very rough level, just to talk about culture per se,

93
00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:18.730
I have no problem with that.

94
00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:22.480
Um uh If you know, if the method of exclusion,

95
00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:26.290
that's this method to exclude genetic and environmental differences.

96
00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:28.390
If, if it had been applied correctly,

97
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.899
uh then, you know, I have no problem with that.

98
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.589
But this does not mean

99
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.570
that the culture specifics

100
00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:37.380
underlying these cases

101
00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.269
are or must be the same.

102
00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:42.739
And this is basically

103
00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:48.339
where I have the biggest difficulties always in getting our main point across

104
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.390
the main point from my research group

105
00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:55.339
is to say they, that is not to say that apes don't have culture.

106
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.420
This is a point that is very frequently misconstruct.

107
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.779
The point is not to say that apes don't have culture. The point is to say Ape

108
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.940
apes have culture, but that culture might be very different

109
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.059
from the culture of humans.

110
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.519
That's essentially our main point here.

111
00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:17.959
Um Yeah, but, but, but, but the rest of the devil is in the details and so on.

112
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.500
Uh But I'm sure we're gonna get to this. Yeah.

113
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.739
But do you think that when studying a culture,

114
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.540
uh we have to be careful about, uh

115
00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:35.089
what would probably be some of the differences that arise between, for example,

116
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.170
studying it

117
00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:38.769
uh when the animals are

118
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.859
uh captive versus uh in the wild?

119
00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:44.700
Um

120
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.359
Well, there are different opinions on that. Uh

121
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.500
The,

122
00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:50.390
the opinion,

123
00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:54.239
the main opinion is, I guess for most people

124
00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:55.880
out in the world,

125
00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:59.089
many, most people are very interested in apes generally

126
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.320
and they are somehow very interested in ape culture generally.

127
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.200
But when they are interested in these things, they are usually interested most

128
00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:11.329
in the wild ape cultural case.

129
00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:12.989
However,

130
00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:15.709
you can also do similar methods,

131
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.910
you can apply them across different populations of captive apes, for example.

132
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.279
And then you can find also

133
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.769
some population differences between these captive populations

134
00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:32.149
that suggests, it suggests that perhaps we are dealing here with similar

135
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.190
phenomenon,

136
00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:36.470
meaning that the similar phenomenon might be

137
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.089
underlain by very similar mechanisms as well.

138
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.040
But here is where then some people um

139
00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:45.459
disagree. Some people would then say

140
00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:50.279
there is a, there is a big difference between wild apes and captive apes.

141
00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:52.470
And uh that is, I mean,

142
00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:55.970
theoretically speaking, you know, that could well be.

143
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.970
Um but then you look at the arguments and the

144
00:08:00.109 --> 00:08:01.660
there is already a problem,

145
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.500
the arguments that people then bring are go

146
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.339
are pointing to completely the opposite patterns.

147
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.299
So

148
00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:11.239
I'm not explaining this very well.

149
00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:15.070
People make different claims

150
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.589
with regard to this difference,

151
00:08:17.859 --> 00:08:19.670
wildly different claims. So

152
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.500
some people essentially claim I,

153
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.739
I have to turn this down a little bit here because we don't have much time.

154
00:08:26.059 --> 00:08:28.660
Um So I'm painting with a very broad brush here.

155
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.090
Some people would then say that um captive apes are stupid.

156
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.989
Again, I'm painting with a broad brush.

157
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.030
Uh So then they would say the captive apes, they,

158
00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:42.049
they can't do very much and so on the wild apes,

159
00:08:42.058 --> 00:08:45.270
they can do many more things and they are really clever ones and so on.

160
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.960
So these people would then essentially claim that captivity impoverishes

161
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.150
the cognition,

162
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.760
um

163
00:08:53.219 --> 00:08:56.309
intelligence if you so on, you know, of these things.

164
00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.750
But then you look and some other people

165
00:08:59.989 --> 00:09:01.849
say the exact opposite.

166
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.969
They say actually, you know,

167
00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:08.070
there is a thing they call it a captivity effect doesn't matter what it's called now.

168
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.450
And they say, oh actually, it turns out that the captive ones,

169
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.549
they are the ones that are showing improved cognition.

170
00:09:17.239 --> 00:09:20.659
So there is a huge problem here. And um

171
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.549
logically speaking,

172
00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:29.140
uh unless you finesse it down into more details, logically speaking, on this level,

173
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.880
one side must be wrong, right?

174
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.989
It cannot be both correct that they are impoverished and improved in,

175
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.150
in their cognition.

176
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.109
So that's already shown

177
00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:40.530
you um

178
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.320
part of the divide that we have in the field where

179
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:49.190
people talk about different things without even agreeing on the basics,

180
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.479
even agreeing, they can't even agree on the overall patterns

181
00:09:54.609 --> 00:09:55.330
as it were.

182
00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.030
But if you can't agree on this overall patterns, and it will be very difficult also to

183
00:10:00.469 --> 00:10:04.450
frankly answer once and for all the questions that you ask me, it's a good question.

184
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.739
You know, is there a difference between the culture of the captive apes and the word?

185
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.210
And there currently it depends who you ask.

186
00:10:12.349 --> 00:10:17.530
Those people who say that uh the the uh captive apes are impoverished,

187
00:10:17.539 --> 00:10:20.650
they will give you a different answer than those who say uh

188
00:10:20.809 --> 00:10:24.710
you know, that the captive apes are improved in their cognition or enhanced

189
00:10:25.349 --> 00:10:26.289
in their cognition.

190
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.900
I personally think

191
00:10:28.489 --> 00:10:32.010
that the difference between wild apes and captive apes

192
00:10:32.979 --> 00:10:35.989
doesn't go as extreme in one direction

193
00:10:36.409 --> 00:10:37.349
or the other

194
00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:40.419
as some of these scams have been made, right?

195
00:10:40.549 --> 00:10:42.989
Uh I think also if you, if you think about it for a second,

196
00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:44.200
the fact that that

197
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.840
can be people who, who promote the idea that, you know,

198
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.080
the the difference is like this, you know,

199
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.760
and the others promote the exact opposite uh idea.

200
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.080
Well, maybe what really is happening is that the,

201
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.210
the real difference is not all that great.

202
00:11:00.599 --> 00:11:02.359
And indeed, um

203
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.989
unless we talk about incarcerated apes and so on so forth, we, we might do so later.

204
00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:08.739
Um

205
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:14.229
Unless you talk about this, the difference is not that great.

206
00:11:14.489 --> 00:11:20.000
Uh And so my answer then would be quite similar. My answer would be to say,

207
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.400
captive apes are also

208
00:11:22.609 --> 00:11:27.840
able to um have an ape culture just like wild apes do.

209
00:11:27.849 --> 00:11:31.119
It's just that most people focus on white ape culture.

210
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.359
-- That would be my my personal short answer to
-- that question.

211
00:11:36.169 --> 00:11:36.750
But I mean,

212
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.770
I've also asked you about that because sometimes

213
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.969
when we talk about studies that are done

214
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:47.809
in uh not only with animals but also with uh humans

215
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:50.900
in the lab, uh There are people

216
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:58.010
uh that bring to the table criticisms regarding for example, ecological validity,

217
00:11:58.039 --> 00:11:58.690
right?

218
00:11:58.789 --> 00:12:01.140
Of those studies. But

219
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.010
I mean,

220
00:12:02.119 --> 00:12:07.250
perhaps I'm saying something that is completely wrong and if so please correct me.

221
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:07.590
But

222
00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:09.239
uh I mean,

223
00:12:09.469 --> 00:12:17.780
I I if um couldn't we treat, let's say captive animals or animals studied in the lab

224
00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:23.799
as uh I mean, those artificial settings as

225
00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:26.650
a different ecology.

226
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.820
I mean, would that make sense?

227
00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:33.000
It would, it would absolutely make sense. You know, we can even go into an evil

228
00:12:33.109 --> 00:12:33.979
route. You could,

229
00:12:34.309 --> 00:12:36.239
you could and people have done that.

230
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.590
Unfortunately, in the past, you can take um single chimpanzees, right?

231
00:12:40.599 --> 00:12:42.599
So you it's a social animal

232
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.479
and you better treat them as social animals and you keep them as social animals but,

233
00:12:46.489 --> 00:12:48.119
but people have taken them

234
00:12:48.239 --> 00:12:49.919
and put them in single cages

235
00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:54.030
and that's not only is that super cruel, we don't need to talk about that.

236
00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:56.159
Everybody would agree that that's a cool thing to do

237
00:12:56.669 --> 00:12:59.570
but that kind of thing, that kind of thing

238
00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:03.609
I am convinced that that does deprive these

239
00:13:03.619 --> 00:13:07.150
apes and it leads to impoverished cognition.

240
00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:07.690
So

241
00:13:08.619 --> 00:13:11.109
how, how can we expand from this uh case?

242
00:13:11.119 --> 00:13:13.719
Right, we can expand from it in, in the following way, I think

243
00:13:14.359 --> 00:13:18.580
we can ask the the more sensible question and the question that can be measured

244
00:13:18.859 --> 00:13:20.500
like how

245
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.799
similar to the wild do we need to create conditions

246
00:13:25.059 --> 00:13:28.340
in order to make these cases ecologically comparable?

247
00:13:28.929 --> 00:13:30.799
This is very important because

248
00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:33.270
when we do that, we see that

249
00:13:33.599 --> 00:13:38.520
there is not one type of ecology for chimpanzees. Let's talk about chimpanzees.

250
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:39.010
Generally,

251
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.299
we can talk about all the A I DS but chimpanzees are the typical case to talk about.

252
00:13:44.409 --> 00:13:47.729
So when we look at chimpanzees across, you know, Africa, uh

253
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.349
we see that they live too in

254
00:13:50.359 --> 00:13:53.669
very widely different situations in different environments,

255
00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:54.090
you know,

256
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.000
but also in different sizes of populations.

257
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:03.270
That is simply the case, right? Um So some live in small populations

258
00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:04.340
actually, you know,

259
00:14:04.349 --> 00:14:07.390
this is there is also an interference with human observation there,

260
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.349
but let's not go in in that direction.

261
00:14:09.924 --> 00:14:10.505
Um

262
00:14:10.875 --> 00:14:13.815
And some live in very big uh uh environments

263
00:14:13.945 --> 00:14:18.674
um in big groups and they live in this different environments too. So

264
00:14:18.794 --> 00:14:22.145
what we can glean from that is the following, we can glean from that.

265
00:14:22.155 --> 00:14:22.434
And,

266
00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:24.914
and we can also imagine that in the past

267
00:14:24.924 --> 00:14:27.554
in the environment of evolutionary adapted this of,

268
00:14:27.565 --> 00:14:29.155
of uh chimpanzees and so on.

269
00:14:29.164 --> 00:14:34.434
In the past, there were very likely more variability in their living conditions.

270
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.190
So

271
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.460
actually

272
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:42.369
many different environments, social environments and physical environments,

273
00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.979
many different environments

274
00:14:44.099 --> 00:14:46.979
are compatible within chimpanzee life,

275
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.460
which means that this is good news as it were for those captive workers.

276
00:14:52.619 --> 00:14:56.979
Because now it's not altogether immediately clear that if you have

277
00:14:56.989 --> 00:15:00.719
a good zoo that provide the aids with uh big enclosure,

278
00:15:00.729 --> 00:15:04.369
say that keep them in uh social settings, the chimpanzees,

279
00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.559
especially in social settings, right?

280
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.369
It's not immediately obvious and it's not an immediate,

281
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:10.859
you know,

282
00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:15.539
Trump card against captive work to say that there are

283
00:15:15.549 --> 00:15:18.530
some differences between this situation and the wild situations.

284
00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:21.250
You know, you can always find the differences. Yes.

285
00:15:21.479 --> 00:15:23.770
But the question is, how much do they matter?

286
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:29.150
And if you frame it like that, I think it's easy to see that the answer will depend,

287
00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:29.650
right?

288
00:15:29.919 --> 00:15:35.619
I would, I would say uh some zoos are more ecologically relevant or similar

289
00:15:35.859 --> 00:15:39.799
to the range of environments that uh wild apes

290
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.989
have, right? Some are less, you know,

291
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.440
yes, in an ideal world, you, you take that into account,

292
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.099
but that's why we always report also where we run our studies.

293
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.140
So later meta reviews and so on can look out for these things.

294
00:15:54.049 --> 00:15:55.750
But as I said earlier,

295
00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.650
when we actually look, the differences don't seem to be all that great.

296
00:16:00.869 --> 00:16:04.349
Again, if people have widely different opinions on that.

297
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.429
Probably the truth is somewhere in the middle, which in this case means

298
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.109
they are not altogether incomparable. Yes.

299
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:19.929
So, uh going back to the wild apes specifically earlier, I asked you,

300
00:16:20.109 --> 00:16:23.849
uh if their culture is similar or different

301
00:16:23.859 --> 00:16:27.270
to humans when it comes to the differences,

302
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.840
do we know exactly what they are

303
00:16:31.429 --> 00:16:35.349
in what ways wild health culture is different from

304
00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:36.909
the human culture?

305
00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:38.590
Um

306
00:16:38.739 --> 00:16:40.979
Well, many people, when you ask them,

307
00:16:41.359 --> 00:16:44.789
many people would point immediately to language

308
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.229
and they would say humans have language and AIDS, don't

309
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.270
that's what many people would say

310
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.700
to a large degree. I think it's true.

311
00:16:54.099 --> 00:16:54.979
Then again,

312
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.929
when, when, when you look more closely, well, what is language?

313
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.640
Language is a form of communication, right? OK. Do apes have communication?

314
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.439
Surely they have communication, right?

315
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.819
They even have a communication on different channels, you know,

316
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:11.800
they can uh use gestures, they can use sounds, you know, so

317
00:17:12.239 --> 00:17:16.130
it's not that there is a complete lack of complexity, say in their,

318
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.670
in their communication, right?

319
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.040
And then you get into essentially linguistics,

320
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:21.319
lin

321
00:17:21.469 --> 00:17:23.810
linguistic debates which are always

322
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:29.030
tough to follow, let's say, right? Uh They are more for the specialists.

323
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:33.589
And so let me just summarize what I think most linguists would say.

324
00:17:33.599 --> 00:17:37.650
They would say while that is true that they have this communication, et cetera,

325
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.010
et cetera.

326
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.420
There are some big differences still

327
00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:41.339
and

328
00:17:41.699 --> 00:17:46.109
what you always find every year when you, when you look at this literature, you know,

329
00:17:46.119 --> 00:17:50.829
the the the aid researchers, they, they chip away every year a little bit, you know,

330
00:17:50.839 --> 00:17:53.180
they chip away at these differences, right?

331
00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:57.640
But the chips that they remove are usually not very, very large. So

332
00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.069
the the the overall picture is that

333
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.420
a communication does,

334
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:06.920
I think that it is fair to say does get closer to human language over time.

335
00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.260
But the steps don't seem to be

336
00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:14.660
as big as they would ever reach a complete overlap. Let me put it this

337
00:18:14.819 --> 00:18:15.859
way, right? I'm not

338
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:20.199
an ape language researcher. Let me, let me, let me say it like that.

339
00:18:20.209 --> 00:18:21.780
But that is my interpretation

340
00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.079
from all of this.

341
00:18:23.239 --> 00:18:23.729
But

342
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.890
in my own approach, I try to go one step deeper.

343
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.739
I take the following as um as granted,

344
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.000
one major assumption

345
00:18:34.209 --> 00:18:37.449
of my, my work is also and I take this from the linguists.

346
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.530
Um they describe language in all kinds of ways and some

347
00:18:42.579 --> 00:18:46.479
specifics of languages also that we learn from each other,

348
00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:49.380
the words or in gestural language, you know,

349
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.170
in sign language that the specific gestures

350
00:18:52.369 --> 00:18:56.530
from each other, right? The fact that we speak English together, right?

351
00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.969
Uh I think none

352
00:18:58.074 --> 00:19:00.494
of us as a as a native speaker, right?

353
00:19:00.775 --> 00:19:03.844
That is because we learned these things from

354
00:19:03.854 --> 00:19:05.994
others and also even our native languages,

355
00:19:06.005 --> 00:19:06.655
we learned

356
00:19:06.785 --> 00:19:10.494
these things from others, right? We learned these words from others.

357
00:19:10.954 --> 00:19:18.135
But then what are words in a in a way um words are a specific type of information.

358
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.449
Um It's in the vocal domain, let's stick with the vocal domain now.

359
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.630
And it's sequences of certain pronunciations and so on that you

360
00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.859
really have to learn as this all sequences a slow.

361
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.270
And in my lab, we, we call

362
00:19:34.459 --> 00:19:39.709
this and other cases, we call that, know how, know how

363
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.459
to pronounce a word,

364
00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:44.250
know how to pronounce the word

365
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.329
uh printer, know how to pronounce the word word water bottle. You know,

366
00:19:48.599 --> 00:19:53.290
that, that kind of thing it is about, know how and, and I know uh you know, I've,

367
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.209
I've moved away quite a bit from your original question.

368
00:19:56.219 --> 00:19:56.989
I haven't forgotten

369
00:19:57.369 --> 00:20:01.089
the question was what is the difference between ape and human culture?

370
00:20:01.369 --> 00:20:01.729
Right?

371
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.939
OK. So let's take for granted that language is still the big difference maker.

372
00:20:06.949 --> 00:20:09.959
But now we see that in order to get language,

373
00:20:10.099 --> 00:20:13.400
you need several factors as the linguist, they've got whole list.

374
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.619
But one of these factors that is necessary is that

375
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.640
you need to be able to copy arbitrary strings,

376
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.000
arbitrary, know how.

377
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.550
And another way of saying that is you need to copy,

378
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:34.250
know how that you yourself will not have come up with uh any time in your life unless

379
00:20:34.599 --> 00:20:36.420
you had copied it from others.

380
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.420
So nobody wakes up in the morning without ever having had contact with uh Mandarin

381
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.500
and speaks Mandarin. You know that that is just not

382
00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:46.859
the case. We all know this,

383
00:20:47.229 --> 00:20:51.260
but the the background to that is that it consists among other things

384
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:56.939
of know how pronouncing all these words um that we could not just produce

385
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:57.670
our own.

386
00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.540
So our lab, we call that

387
00:21:00.079 --> 00:21:02.160
and I know it's a bit of a mouthful, right?

388
00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:03.349
We call that super

389
00:21:03.819 --> 00:21:04.930
individual,

390
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.219
know how s

391
00:21:06.489 --> 00:21:07.280
above

392
00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:10.569
individual beyond the individual. No,

393
00:21:10.949 --> 00:21:12.099
is the term.

394
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:16.849
The whole idea goes back to classical uh research and cultural evolution.

395
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:19.359
The whole idea goes back to Boyd and Richardson

396
00:21:19.579 --> 00:21:21.099
who pointed out that,

397
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.729
you know, a special type of culture, cumulative culture,

398
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.550
I would like to add cumulative culture of know how

399
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.739
produces, you know, ways of doing things and so on.

400
00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:32.609
Um

401
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.640
that nobody on their own could develop uh from scratch

402
00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:37.979
anymore.

403
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.170
So we just, you know, we just gave this a label.

404
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.369
Uh We, we specified a little bit more,

405
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:48.050
we said it's about know how and we specified uh you know, the whole idea

406
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.114
in the extrovert super individual. So

407
00:21:51.324 --> 00:21:54.084
the difference then, and this is the high positive,

408
00:21:54.094 --> 00:21:56.824
but it's really very well supported by now,

409
00:21:57.045 --> 00:22:02.905
the difference is that humans have recounted them roughly and we found billions,

410
00:22:02.915 --> 00:22:05.704
billions of cases of super individual know-how

411
00:22:06.324 --> 00:22:08.984
across the whole planet, across all humans, billions.

412
00:22:09.839 --> 00:22:14.119
And then in the case of the apes, you know, do they have super individual?

413
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.930
Know how, I mean, the interview is continuing, we can talk more about that.

414
00:22:17.939 --> 00:22:19.859
But let me give you a very rough answer.

415
00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:21.959
And the answer is

416
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.290
if,

417
00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:25.000
if apes

418
00:22:25.709 --> 00:22:26.599
have,

419
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.140
I should specify un incarcerated, untrained apes,

420
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:34.859
if they have super individual know how they have it in very rare cases.

421
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:36.270
So a

422
00:22:36.729 --> 00:22:40.369
couple of cases, maybe a handful of cases,

423
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:45.349
but maybe also they have none and these handful of cases may be illusions.

424
00:22:45.619 --> 00:22:46.180
Um

425
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.810
But then we have the answer in focus. Now the answer is essentially

426
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.859
uh human life would be widely different. What is inconceivable in its current form.

427
00:22:56.949 --> 00:23:00.760
If we were to take all these super individual know how away

428
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.689
everything would come to a grinding halt.

429
00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:06.415
We wouldn't have computers, we wouldn't have language,

430
00:23:06.425 --> 00:23:08.885
we wouldn't have any of these things, you know, you and I,

431
00:23:08.895 --> 00:23:12.814
we wouldn't uh be able to talk to each other, you and I, we wouldn't have names,

432
00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:13.214
you know.

433
00:23:13.344 --> 00:23:13.974
So

434
00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:19.665
that is what, what my approach has been for for many years now.

435
00:23:19.974 --> 00:23:23.905
Um to say that the difference is that we humans, we are

436
00:23:24.114 --> 00:23:27.165
um we, we are able to copy, know how,

437
00:23:27.175 --> 00:23:31.135
even if there's no how it is super individual and we indeed do.

438
00:23:31.375 --> 00:23:34.324
-- And we have created all of this around us in this
-- way.

439
00:23:35.219 --> 00:23:38.290
OK. So perhaps I could save this question for later.

440
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:43.160
But since you brought it already to the table, let's censor it now. So

441
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:49.750
uh you mentioned there the question, I mean, if other apes have some,

442
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.459
some form of super individual know how uh

443
00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.560
I mean, what are examples of that.

444
00:23:57.599 --> 00:23:58.160
And I mean,

445
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:05.000
what are examples of that where some people might claim that they in fact have that?

446
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.069
Yes. So um

447
00:24:07.459 --> 00:24:09.359
here is it is an interesting approach.

448
00:24:09.369 --> 00:24:13.729
If you do the data approach, where you actually look systematically,

449
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.469
what are these cases,

450
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.000
you find actually a different answer

451
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.579
than when you ask people like that at a conference.

452
00:24:21.589 --> 00:24:25.439
For example, when II I do this kind of thing as well, I ask around, you know, I,

453
00:24:25.449 --> 00:24:26.359
I talk to people.

454
00:24:27.109 --> 00:24:30.219
So when I explain what I'm after and I explain, you know,

455
00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:36.540
I'm I'm after know how not know where food is, not know what food is.

456
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.280
You know, this thing, whether it's that thing,

457
00:24:38.619 --> 00:24:42.819
we all know that apes can learn socially also about these things.

458
00:24:42.829 --> 00:24:43.839
When I say no, no,

459
00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:46.880
we are talking about know how more specifically not

460
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.800
know how that they can do on their own,

461
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.569
what my lab calls latent solutions. It doesn't matter what we call that,

462
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.609
you know, let's stick with this. Know how.

463
00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.939
So we are not talking about this latent know-how,

464
00:24:57.949 --> 00:24:59.599
we are talking about super individual.

465
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.170
When I explain all that,

466
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.369
they give me answers such as

467
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.290
OK. But then for example, they would say,

468
00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:08.189
for example, Chimpanzee nut

469
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.229
cracking would be uh one of these cases, right?

470
00:25:12.449 --> 00:25:13.650
Chimpanzee nut cracking.

471
00:25:13.849 --> 00:25:17.920
Um I don't need to explain, they use uh some hammers to crack, open some nuts,

472
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.369
you know, very cool behavior.

473
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.469
Nobody denies that.

474
00:25:20.479 --> 00:25:24.729
But it's a question is that a good idea, you know, to call that super individual,

475
00:25:24.739 --> 00:25:27.239
know how, in fact, um

476
00:25:27.619 --> 00:25:32.589
this is so convincing to most people per se per se without

477
00:25:32.599 --> 00:25:37.209
looking at the data that uh the United Nations have now uh

478
00:25:37.699 --> 00:25:40.760
started to protect Chimpanzee nutcracker.

479
00:25:41.079 --> 00:25:46.579
The United Nations protect Chimpanzee nut cracking. The whole idea there is

480
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.900
that this is

481
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.239
they don't use these terms.

482
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:53.310
But the whole idea is that this is so human like that, this is super individual.

483
00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:57.380
Know how that this is not know how that the apes would ever show

484
00:25:57.609 --> 00:26:01.900
unless they had developed this culture around it. That's the idea, right?

485
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.180
And again, nobody is saying that this is a stupid idea.

486
00:26:05.189 --> 00:26:06.780
You know, it's not a stupid idea.

487
00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.140
It's just a matter of does it actually fit the data?

488
00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:13.479
And so what we have done is we have

489
00:26:13.489 --> 00:26:18.800
given um uh orangutans in two different zoos orangutans

490
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.079
untrained. So they were not trained to correct nuts,

491
00:26:22.589 --> 00:26:25.500
un incarcerated, you know, so they were not,

492
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.199
their cognition wasn't changed by human interaction.

493
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.040
Maybe that's the shortest way I can describe this, you know,

494
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:33.310
they were left on their own

495
00:26:33.599 --> 00:26:34.520
and

496
00:26:34.689 --> 00:26:37.349
nobody showed them how to correct these nuts,

497
00:26:37.839 --> 00:26:39.469
right? We asked the keepers, they

498
00:26:39.709 --> 00:26:43.609
promised us, you know that nobody showed them how to correct these nuts, right.

499
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:49.420
Well, they crack nuts, they use an animals and they crack nuts spontaneously,

500
00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.890
right? So

501
00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.060
orangutans don't even crack nuts in the wild.

502
00:26:55.579 --> 00:26:58.199
This would have been maybe the last remaining

503
00:26:58.209 --> 00:27:01.469
uh rescue hypotheses for the United Nations.

504
00:27:01.479 --> 00:27:08.319
Say when they say, oh, maybe they, they learned it somehow we, because eventually,

505
00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:10.160
if you go back long enough in time,

506
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.199
eventually some orangutans had to come from the wild,

507
00:27:12.209 --> 00:27:13.890
maybe they brought this knowledge along.

508
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.560
No, you know, orangutans don't crack nuts in the wild, not that we know of anyway.

509
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.599
And so we have basically um uh an ape species

510
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.270
very relevant because it's an ape species, you know,

511
00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.390
they are all very closely related to each other and to us

512
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:32.319
um who didn't bring this knowledge from, there's no help from the world

513
00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.760
who wasn't trained to show this knowledge,

514
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:40.510
who wasn't, you know, cognitively, um super enhanced by, by human incarceration.

515
00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:43.959
And we didn't show them how to do these things and yet

516
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.520
they take hammers and they crack nuts, right?

517
00:27:47.869 --> 00:27:48.530
So

518
00:27:48.969 --> 00:27:50.380
p definition is

519
00:27:51.109 --> 00:27:53.339
this is not super individual. Nohow, by

520
00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:57.290
definition, it shows that the individuals

521
00:27:58.109 --> 00:28:00.329
could come up with this know-how.

522
00:28:00.339 --> 00:28:04.209
So this latent know-how, it's know how that they can come up with

523
00:28:04.569 --> 00:28:05.439
on their own.

524
00:28:05.949 --> 00:28:06.729
So exactly,

525
00:28:06.739 --> 00:28:10.089
unlike the example that I said earlier when I said nobody wakes

526
00:28:10.099 --> 00:28:13.209
up in the morning and just be able to speak Mandarin or,

527
00:28:13.219 --> 00:28:13.780
or Portuguese

528
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.250
or, or whatever, you know,

529
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.770
that doesn't happen.

530
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.489
But in a is

531
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:22.680
it does happen that, you know, they, they encounter the situation

532
00:28:22.829 --> 00:28:24.810
and as long as they are motivated.

533
00:28:24.819 --> 00:28:28.010
It's very important, motivated to actually eat these nuts.

534
00:28:28.479 --> 00:28:28.910
We,

535
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.260
we tried this with chimpanzees as well and they were not motivated to eat the nuts.

536
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.630
And of course, you can't study it.

537
00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:38.630
But you know, if they are motivated, then um apparently they can do it, you know,

538
00:28:39.109 --> 00:28:39.750
so

539
00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:46.160
the answer then that people give you what is super individual, know how in the apes

540
00:28:46.369 --> 00:28:49.339
you can then go and you test it in these ways.

541
00:28:49.479 --> 00:28:52.060
And we have done many, many such tests.

542
00:28:52.329 --> 00:28:55.920
And the overwhelming result from all these tests is

543
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:58.260
that people make these claims,

544
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.640
right? And the claim, nobody you know is fine to make this claim.

545
00:29:03.079 --> 00:29:04.400
But then you test it

546
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:09.369
and we showed many of these papers are still yet to be published. You know, uh

547
00:29:09.569 --> 00:29:15.750
we show that these kind of know how develop spontaneously in individuals.

548
00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.599
And therefore it does not require the special human skill,

549
00:29:19.609 --> 00:29:22.680
it does not require the skill to copy.

550
00:29:23.099 --> 00:29:27.119
This is very important, the skill to copy super individual know how

551
00:29:27.739 --> 00:29:33.790
instead all they need is uh being able to trigger each other's latent, know how

552
00:29:34.089 --> 00:29:34.790
they do that.

553
00:29:34.979 --> 00:29:36.510
But that's a different thing, right?

554
00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:37.449
I can

555
00:29:37.849 --> 00:29:42.390
this is a bad example because it's a hard wire behavior, but I can trigger you to yawn,

556
00:29:42.609 --> 00:29:46.469
you don't have to copy the know how of the yawn from me, right?

557
00:29:46.479 --> 00:29:47.859
Just to give you an example that

558
00:29:48.069 --> 00:29:49.989
it happens in humans too,

559
00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.000
but it's very rare in the human case, right?

560
00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:57.349
We don't, that's not usually the way that we work that we learn from each other.

561
00:29:57.359 --> 00:29:59.310
Right? But it is a typical way

562
00:29:59.479 --> 00:30:01.430
that the apes learn from each other. And,

563
00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.310
you know, yes, they, they,

564
00:30:03.319 --> 00:30:05.609
you have to have some social learning in the apes

565
00:30:05.619 --> 00:30:08.439
and it's clearly is there otherwise they wouldn't have culture.

566
00:30:08.449 --> 00:30:08.790
Right.

567
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:09.540
So,

568
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.989
um if you bring it all together apes have culture, yes,

569
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.589
but their culture is different in the sense that

570
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:16.910
they don't

571
00:30:17.219 --> 00:30:21.209
copy super individual, know how, which prevents logically,

572
00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:23.630
which prevents the cultural evolution

573
00:30:23.989 --> 00:30:25.160
of this. Know how,

574
00:30:25.609 --> 00:30:27.500
because if the apes,

575
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:31.369
even if some ape comes up with a super great uh know how on their own.

576
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:35.630
Let's imagine an ape genius uh scenario. Let's just imagine this,

577
00:30:36.119 --> 00:30:38.920
this a genius comes up with a super great super individual

578
00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:39.839
or maybe a

579
00:30:39.959 --> 00:30:40.750
techni

580
00:30:40.869 --> 00:30:45.780
technological way to crack nuts like 100 in an hour, you know, let's,

581
00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.140
you know, we humans do this kind of thing. So why not? You know,

582
00:30:49.439 --> 00:30:51.880
so um this a genius comes up with that,

583
00:30:51.989 --> 00:30:54.969
but if the other apes are unable to copy super individual,

584
00:30:54.979 --> 00:30:59.390
know how they are not in this example, they would not be geniuses.

585
00:30:59.540 --> 00:30:59.810
Well,

586
00:30:59.819 --> 00:31:04.800
the predictable outcome would be that this invention would die with its maker.

587
00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:05.569
You know,

588
00:31:05.579 --> 00:31:10.630
all the others would do the kind of things that they are able to do on their own

589
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:15.569
again, a long answer. But, but that is maybe the shortest I can do for this question.

590
00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:16.880
Great.

591
00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:21.010
So uh before we move on to another topic, I mean,

592
00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:26.060
the questions I have asked you up till now that were mostly related to

593
00:31:26.069 --> 00:31:31.800
wild ape culture and how similar or different it is to human culture.

594
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:32.880
I mean,

595
00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:33.969
of course,

596
00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:36.280
uh intellectually

597
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.099
the I guess these questions are very interesting but

598
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.380
from the perspective of someone who's trying to study and understand

599
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:47.270
the culture, cultural evolution,

600
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:51.479
why should we bother with these questions?

601
00:31:51.489 --> 00:31:52.020
I mean, why,

602
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:57.839
why does it matter if wild ape culture is similar or different

603
00:31:57.849 --> 00:32:02.209
to human culture and if similar or different in what way,

604
00:32:02.219 --> 00:32:06.099
specifically, why should we bother with this question?

605
00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:06.619
Um

606
00:32:07.109 --> 00:32:08.660
So generally speaking, I think

607
00:32:09.199 --> 00:32:12.030
what we are doing in all these cases is

608
00:32:12.449 --> 00:32:13.199
we are not,

609
00:32:13.469 --> 00:32:16.500
we're not producing anything, you know, this is not,

610
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.689
you know, this is not feeding humans on the planet or the answer to this question,

611
00:32:21.699 --> 00:32:21.930
right?

612
00:32:21.939 --> 00:32:22.319
So

613
00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.390
it's essential basic science,

614
00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.729
essentially basic science, but that we are doing here,

615
00:32:26.739 --> 00:32:29.060
we're just trying to understand systems.

616
00:32:29.069 --> 00:32:30.329
That's, that's what we do.

617
00:32:30.589 --> 00:32:31.079
And

618
00:32:31.369 --> 00:32:33.449
within that, I think we have got

619
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:35.250
a couple of different approaches.

620
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.719
I am, I am a biologist by training originally. Now, I'm

621
00:32:38.959 --> 00:32:42.260
also an archaeologist, but I am originally a biologist.

622
00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.209
And so for me, it's just of general interest

623
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:51.089
to find out how apes behave and uh what ape culture is where it comes from and,

624
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.729
and so on and to describe it, you know, so that's

625
00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:55.010
generally interesting,

626
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:59.849
but there are a couple of other things that are more broadly interesting. Um

627
00:33:00.319 --> 00:33:05.699
So for example, to, to be able to talk about animal culture, generally,

628
00:33:05.709 --> 00:33:10.839
we would need to study as many animal species as possible.

629
00:33:10.849 --> 00:33:14.150
Some people now even claim that plants have some social learning.

630
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.760
So we would have to include them

631
00:33:16.069 --> 00:33:19.140
in some general very general cultural category.

632
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:20.829
So

633
00:33:20.969 --> 00:33:25.540
apes then would be one part of this general puzzle that we should study everything

634
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.550
that we can in an ideal world.

635
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.729
But in addition to that, um

636
00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.170
we can use this kind of knowledge,

637
00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.890
this hard gain knowledge in order to try to understand

638
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:40.420
um cultural settings generally and cultural evolution

639
00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:45.790
generally and specifically for humans. And here is where the apes of course play

640
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:46.709
very

641
00:33:46.959 --> 00:33:53.160
um large role. They play a large role because they are our closest living relatives.

642
00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.180
And so in addition to being

643
00:33:55.359 --> 00:33:57.530
of interest in and of themselves,

644
00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:59.150
they are highly,

645
00:33:59.319 --> 00:34:02.890
potentially highly uh phylogenetic informative.

646
00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:09.530
Uh if we understand ape culture, it gives us a handle to have a likelihood,

647
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.409
understanding

648
00:34:10.708 --> 00:34:14.949
a likelihood, understanding of uh the last common ancestor

649
00:34:15.168 --> 00:34:15.978
with apes.

650
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.530
So if we find some patterns that are shared among all living apes today,

651
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.800
chances are good. Chances are good is the implication

652
00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:28.300
that the last common ancestor also shared in.

653
00:34:28.879 --> 00:34:32.639
It's not the perfect uh uh data set, right.

654
00:34:32.649 --> 00:34:33.168
Ideally,

655
00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:36.090
we would have to have hundreds of living ape species

656
00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.458
that would be much better for this kind of influence.

657
00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:40.340
But it's the best that we have,

658
00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.469
you know, and, and so we should use it

659
00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:48.120
and then we can infer with a certain likelihood what the last common ancestor

660
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:52.810
ancestors culture was like. And we can then build from that. And that is,

661
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:57.770
that is my other area of research. But I think we talked about that last time

662
00:34:57.899 --> 00:34:59.169
to a high uh

663
00:35:00.219 --> 00:35:01.010
degree.

664
00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.000
So I would be refer listeners interested in that

665
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.239
what we are homing in our own past ancestors,

666
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:11.399
cultures like and so on that we, that we debated last time.

667
00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:13.959
So uh people could maybe listen to that then.

668
00:35:14.649 --> 00:35:15.439
Yes, of course.

669
00:35:15.449 --> 00:35:16.840
And as I said, at the beginning,

670
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:20.580
I'm linking to our first interview in the description of this one.

671
00:35:20.729 --> 00:35:25.780
And by the way, just to clarify when you mentioned that a certain point there,

672
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.929
our last common ancestor with apes.

673
00:35:28.939 --> 00:35:29.969
Are you referring

674
00:35:30.199 --> 00:35:33.729
specifically to the last common ancestor?

675
00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:34.439
We have,

676
00:35:34.449 --> 00:35:39.750
we have with chimpanzees or going all the way back to

677
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.389
the one from which uh orangutans and gorillas also wrenched.

678
00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:49.370
I would, I would say the typical way that people talk about it,

679
00:35:49.379 --> 00:35:52.139
the last common ancestor and they say it just like that

680
00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.340
and it's the last common ancestor we have

681
00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.530
together with the chimpanzees and the bonobos,

682
00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:56.850
right?

683
00:35:57.179 --> 00:35:57.889
Um

684
00:35:58.129 --> 00:35:58.689
But

685
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.370
my lab has also been, again, I would

686
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.810
refer to the last interview we did

687
00:36:03.989 --> 00:36:06.610
has also looked at all the other apes and so on so

688
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:06.860
forth.

689
00:36:07.709 --> 00:36:11.760
We should really, ideally, we should look at all primates.

690
00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:14.020
Uh But uh you know, that's hard to do.

691
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:16.580
It's, it's very difficult to get all the data for the apes.

692
00:36:17.889 --> 00:36:20.050
So another question, then

693
00:36:20.239 --> 00:36:26.669
there's this similarity hypothesis that people apply to the

694
00:36:26.679 --> 00:36:28.949
kinds of questions we've been talking about here.

695
00:36:28.959 --> 00:36:32.090
So what is the similarity hypothesis?

696
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:37.419
And what are the types of claims that people have proposed in favor of it?

697
00:36:38.679 --> 00:36:38.699
I

698
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:41.419
think if you ask around us the conferences,

699
00:36:41.929 --> 00:36:45.290
the the the the things that convinced most people

700
00:36:45.449 --> 00:36:47.540
sometime in their Androgyny, you know,

701
00:36:47.949 --> 00:36:51.209
um many are convinced this is how I started too.

702
00:36:51.219 --> 00:36:54.760
I was convinced by the similarity of hypothesis in the beginning too.

703
00:36:55.129 --> 00:36:56.949
And then the data changed my mind,

704
00:36:56.959 --> 00:37:00.979
my own data uh changed my mind but also other people's data.

705
00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.610
Um

706
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.719
So many people arrived there because they had heard this

707
00:37:06.729 --> 00:37:10.659
in school that all primates of human like culture,

708
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.060
sometimes this was just implicit by the teachers, you know,

709
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.540
and then people just pick it up in this way.

710
00:37:16.719 --> 00:37:21.469
Sometimes it was said explicitly, I've asked some people a little bit about that,

711
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.340
but many also arrived because in public uh common media,

712
00:37:26.909 --> 00:37:28.429
imagine Attenborough and so on.

713
00:37:28.439 --> 00:37:32.909
But of course, other people in wildlife documentaries and so on, the typical way

714
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.330
that they describe these things is that they say, yeah, yeah,

715
00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:39.070
this is all exactly like in the human case.

716
00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.209
And then of course,

717
00:37:40.919 --> 00:37:46.330
um, it looks also, I have to admit it looks at first it looks quite humanlike. Right.

718
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.780
Um, so why would people

719
00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:50.100
based on that,

720
00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.699
why would they come away watching these things and hearing these things?

721
00:37:53.709 --> 00:37:56.219
Why would they come away with a skeptical mindset? Right.

722
00:37:56.229 --> 00:37:58.040
There's absolutely no reason for that.

723
00:37:59.709 --> 00:38:04.110
But, and, and, and that's why I arrived at the scene, you know, uh like that, I,

724
00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.479
I believed, you know, that apes would have human like culture.

725
00:38:08.709 --> 00:38:09.489
Um

726
00:38:10.379 --> 00:38:13.959
So, you know, if you look at that just superficially,

727
00:38:13.969 --> 00:38:18.570
there is something already wrong with this uh approach because when you look

728
00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:23.139
even superficially at ape life and then human life even cross culturally,

729
00:38:23.379 --> 00:38:25.409
you do see differences, right? So

730
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.629
there is a problem if you think about it like that,

731
00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:31.489
if you begin to actually compare with the human case, but let's not,

732
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.449
let's not go in this direction right now,

733
00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:37.270
a different direction is to basically say

734
00:38:37.659 --> 00:38:41.239
what we, the the main convincing things are

735
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:47.030
that people see videos say of uh mother chimpanzee doing some things and then

736
00:38:47.419 --> 00:38:50.510
often cut videos, you know, sometimes not even the same individual,

737
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.090
but it can be the same individual

738
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:54.030
uh later on

739
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.590
these youngsters doing similar things,

740
00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:57.620
all right.

741
00:38:58.879 --> 00:39:03.229
Uh So that's very convincing to people, then I always point out

742
00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:08.489
yes. But uh that is also the explanation that people had in the past

743
00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:12.419
for um how birds learn to make their nests,

744
00:39:12.649 --> 00:39:17.169
they believe was that they always have to learn how to make their nest, how

745
00:39:17.459 --> 00:39:18.320
notice how,

746
00:39:18.649 --> 00:39:22.300
you know, they learn what material where this material is for sure.

747
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.360
But the how, that's the question and

748
00:39:24.659 --> 00:39:27.719
uh the crucial uh studies there were done

749
00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.199
uh many years ago,

750
00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:29.649
Colas

751
00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:30.129
and Colas,

752
00:39:30.459 --> 00:39:31.060
for example,

753
00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.189
did a study on river bird nest making

754
00:39:33.199 --> 00:39:35.764
weaver birds are fantastic because they super fantastic.

755
00:39:35.784 --> 00:39:37.514
N you know, super great design,

756
00:39:37.645 --> 00:39:39.754
seemingly very complicated and so on.

757
00:39:39.764 --> 00:39:41.774
So what they did is they took an egg,

758
00:39:41.784 --> 00:39:44.475
the beauty with birds is that you can take them as an egg.

759
00:39:44.485 --> 00:39:46.195
They can't have seen anything, right?

760
00:39:46.475 --> 00:39:50.735
And then they raised these eggs outside of the view of any nests,

761
00:39:50.745 --> 00:39:52.114
let alone nest making

762
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.360
and then they ate it, you know,

763
00:39:54.370 --> 00:40:00.229
and uh these river birds completely naive to nest and nest making,

764
00:40:00.439 --> 00:40:03.300
they made the species typical nest

765
00:40:03.939 --> 00:40:07.199
and then, you know, people immediately get it, you know, they say,

766
00:40:07.469 --> 00:40:10.000
yeah, the, the logic is super clear here.

767
00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:15.040
We may have assumed that the birds have to copy how to make the nests.

768
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:18.479
But these kind of studies conclusively prove

769
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.800
that they don't.

770
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:20.879
Hm.

771
00:40:21.199 --> 00:40:22.520
And then I say, ok,

772
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.689
now we talked about uh birds somehow, you know,

773
00:40:25.699 --> 00:40:29.810
birds are much less emotional and the logic is much clearer to see,

774
00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:35.459
you know, let's go to this, unfortunately, very emotional case of the apes.

775
00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:41.100
And what if I were to tell you that, you know, you see mother chimpanzee do something,

776
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:45.360
uh baby chimpanzee do something if we now remove this knowledge, right?

777
00:40:45.489 --> 00:40:46.620
And they still do it.

778
00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:50.949
And I, I told you about this one example in the orangutan case already, you know,

779
00:40:50.959 --> 00:40:53.010
they didn't have to see these kind of things.

780
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.100
It's logically, it's the same structure

781
00:40:56.459 --> 00:40:57.020
in the river

782
00:40:57.129 --> 00:41:00.110
bird case as in the orangutan nut cracking case,

783
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:02.909
if they can do these things on their own,

784
00:41:03.189 --> 00:41:07.360
it proves that the assumption that they have to copy these things

785
00:41:07.669 --> 00:41:08.939
was wrong, right?

786
00:41:09.649 --> 00:41:10.909
Um So that's,

787
00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:14.010
that's essentially one aspect. But there are,

788
00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:15.429
there are two more I think.

789
00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:20.290
Um another is that people point to uh

790
00:41:21.149 --> 00:41:23.629
to super rare behaviors.

791
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:27.209
Uh And they say, look, you know, this is similar to the human case.

792
00:41:27.239 --> 00:41:31.750
We've got this super rare behaviors only occurs here only occurs here

793
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.350
in this particular population of say chimpanzees.

794
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:37.540
And again, the intuition, we can,

795
00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:40.520
we can long discuss why that is the case.

796
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.050
But I don't need to because people have this intuition already.

797
00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:47.080
So I don't need to explain why that is actually not a bad argument per se.

798
00:41:47.669 --> 00:41:49.360
Um But then we tested that.

799
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.659
So um I A

800
00:41:51.139 --> 00:41:51.179
Motes

801
00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:53.659
Rodrigo, my, my phd student at the time and I,

802
00:41:53.669 --> 00:41:57.800
we tested that and we looked at all these claims where people have said

803
00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:01.209
this kind of know how only exists in this

804
00:42:01.219 --> 00:42:05.209
one population of one specific um species of apes

805
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.229
and we asked around and we look for the literature that came later.

806
00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.209
Uh if that is actually the case

807
00:42:11.449 --> 00:42:14.620
and we found that in 99% of cases

808
00:42:14.889 --> 00:42:18.709
that was not the case or 98% you know, was not the case.

809
00:42:18.719 --> 00:42:21.449
Instead these things did repeat

810
00:42:21.919 --> 00:42:22.969
someplace else.

811
00:42:23.409 --> 00:42:26.280
They, they, they, that shows that this intuition,

812
00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:27.889
even though it was not a bad intuition,

813
00:42:28.419 --> 00:42:29.070
you know,

814
00:42:29.449 --> 00:42:33.929
it was actually not correct in, in the vast majority of cases,

815
00:42:34.379 --> 00:42:34.719
a

816
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.199
know how repeats

817
00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:38.879
across different things. It pops up time and again.

818
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.540
And then you have to explain why does it pop up time and again.

819
00:42:42.639 --> 00:42:46.560
And our approach is to say, well, because it is latently present

820
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.179
anyway, right? And it requires certain conditions,

821
00:42:50.782 --> 00:42:55.042
um motivational issues, environmental conditions, et cetera, et cetera,

822
00:42:55.052 --> 00:43:01.143
tiny details to then create different patches of these cultures everywhere.

823
00:43:01.262 --> 00:43:02.502
That's cultural.

824
00:43:02.512 --> 00:43:04.722
Let's let's be very clear about this,

825
00:43:04.732 --> 00:43:07.212
but it's different cultural from the human case because we

826
00:43:07.222 --> 00:43:10.802
culturally evolve our know how on top of this,

827
00:43:10.812 --> 00:43:12.212
you know, very different uh approach.

828
00:43:12.825 --> 00:43:17.845
Oh yeah. And uh and lastly, I think what many people are also convinced of is

829
00:43:18.016 --> 00:43:22.926
when they see, for example, let's say uh in a Hollywood movie these days,

830
00:43:22.936 --> 00:43:26.345
luckily Hollywood does a lot of CG I for apes and so on.

831
00:43:26.355 --> 00:43:27.355
But in the past,

832
00:43:27.365 --> 00:43:31.885
they would have a trained ape and that ape would act say very human like, right?

833
00:43:32.226 --> 00:43:33.055
And then they,

834
00:43:33.476 --> 00:43:34.166
this

835
00:43:35.719 --> 00:43:37.340
the number of people who

836
00:43:37.479 --> 00:43:41.110
came to this belief because of these kind of images

837
00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:46.340
goes down, I think, but they still exist. And so they basically then say,

838
00:43:47.159 --> 00:43:51.870
uh look, I've seen apes act like humans. What are you, what are you talking about?

839
00:43:51.879 --> 00:43:55.620
Claudio, I've seen apes look like humans and act like humans.

840
00:43:55.629 --> 00:43:57.820
So they must have copied it from humans.

841
00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:01.000
And that is not true. We can,

842
00:44:01.219 --> 00:44:04.689
we can make a bear ride a motorcycle in circles.

843
00:44:04.699 --> 00:44:06.600
It's not that I would do this, but we can.

844
00:44:06.919 --> 00:44:12.610
But that doesn't mean that why natural bears ride motorcycles, right?

845
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:16.110
So we have to keep separate, trained behavior

846
00:44:17.179 --> 00:44:21.739
and going even further, we have to keep separate and incarcerated apes that

847
00:44:21.889 --> 00:44:25.360
you know, that are very special, incarcerated apes are a special case.

848
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:29.169
They are again irrelevant for the aggression of wild ape cultures.

849
00:44:29.399 --> 00:44:33.379
But it's much harder to see why they are irrelevant for this case.

850
00:44:34.489 --> 00:44:38.530
But uh why should we study un

851
00:44:39.659 --> 00:44:45.520
-- inculturated and untrained apes? What kind of information can we get from
-- them?

852
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.550
So the again, the trained,

853
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.429
the trained apes, if we,

854
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:52.239
if we were to train a dog,

855
00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:57.209
say, uh if we were to train a dog to not like meat,

856
00:44:57.399 --> 00:44:59.679
let's just make it very simple.

857
00:44:59.689 --> 00:45:02.939
It's not about know how this is about, know what, know what to eat,

858
00:45:03.229 --> 00:45:04.770
but it doesn't matter for now,

859
00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:10.040
then it's very easy to see that this is not representative anymore

860
00:45:10.389 --> 00:45:11.590
for wolves.

861
00:45:12.409 --> 00:45:16.020
Why would wolves not like me, right.

862
00:45:16.129 --> 00:45:17.590
So if you were to take,

863
00:45:18.199 --> 00:45:20.929
of course, dogs are uh domesticated animals,

864
00:45:20.939 --> 00:45:23.840
we can use a non-domestic animal with a similar logic.

865
00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.620
It's easy enough to do. So let's just stick with the dogs.

866
00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:27.669
Um

867
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:32.149
So if we were to make them train them not to do something,

868
00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.110
we can do that, right?

869
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:38.000
Uh But that is not um relevant for

870
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.870
extrapolating

871
00:45:40.219 --> 00:45:42.719
what wild animals would be doing.

872
00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:46.270
This is just one example, but they, the one generalizes,

873
00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:48.409
we can train

874
00:45:48.739 --> 00:45:51.050
animals generally via clicker training.

875
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.129
I've done this myself, you know, uh all kinds of race.

876
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:55.790
Um We can do that

877
00:45:55.899 --> 00:46:00.370
and they perform things including even if we want to know how

878
00:46:00.669 --> 00:46:02.379
we can make a dog done salsa,

879
00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:02.959
right?

880
00:46:03.239 --> 00:46:06.899
Uh We can do, we can install, know how in them

881
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.939
that would never come about

882
00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:11.399
in wild animals.

883
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:14.820
That means that we need to exclude

884
00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:19.179
all of these cases where we train the, know how into these animals.

885
00:46:19.189 --> 00:46:22.540
Because the question is not, is decidedly not,

886
00:46:22.929 --> 00:46:23.729
can

887
00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:29.780
for example, an ape, can an ape, can an ape show some human know how

888
00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.350
that question is a different question,

889
00:46:32.429 --> 00:46:37.260
that question we can answer yes because for example, we can train them to

890
00:46:38.209 --> 00:46:40.949
our question here is different. Our question is

891
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:44.649
can a spontaneously copy

892
00:46:44.899 --> 00:46:46.510
super individual nohow,

893
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:47.939
copy

894
00:46:48.229 --> 00:46:50.929
and spontaneous, you know, these, these are the two

895
00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:55.550
things that we have to have in place because if they are not spontaneous.

896
00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:59.800
Um And if it's not copying, then this is not what we are really after.

897
00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:00.489
You know, that's,

898
00:47:00.699 --> 00:47:02.110
that's what we are after here.

899
00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:03.489
Oh, yeah. And

900
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:06.719
with the incarceration, the incarceration is a little bit complicated.

901
00:47:06.729 --> 00:47:08.489
So bear with me a little bit.

902
00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:09.199
Ok.

903
00:47:09.909 --> 00:47:10.560
Um

904
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:13.169
There are two

905
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:17.270
general, two general approaches to explaining why

906
00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.570
we humans have special social learning abilities.

907
00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:22.929
So

908
00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.939
just so, you know, yes, I'm,

909
00:47:24.949 --> 00:47:28.409
my research group is a little bit special that we talk about,

910
00:47:28.419 --> 00:47:30.949
know how copying supervision, know how copying.

911
00:47:30.959 --> 00:47:32.500
So we specify it like that.

912
00:47:32.669 --> 00:47:34.770
But we are by no means alone

913
00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:39.149
in saying that humans have some special social learning abilities.

914
00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:40.510
Others focus

915
00:47:40.629 --> 00:47:43.550
focus much more detailed on imitation and so on.

916
00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.750
We think this is too, too focused, you know, but it doesn't matter.

917
00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.889
So we are not the only ones that

918
00:47:47.899 --> 00:47:50.969
say humans have got special social learning abilities,

919
00:47:50.979 --> 00:47:51.679
good.

920
00:47:51.939 --> 00:47:53.310
Keep that in mind. So now

921
00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:57.189
when we say there was a whole class of social learning American

922
00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:00.370
that's special. Let's even not say what they are.

923
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:04.360
Then there are two general approaches to this,

924
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:08.199
how we humans got to have these special social learning.

925
00:48:08.449 --> 00:48:11.000
One approach is to say

926
00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:13.800
they are adaptations, they are natural adaptations.

927
00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:16.139
We have them in our genes essentially.

928
00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.800
Again, I'm painting with a very broad product.

929
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:22.610
These people will then say, well, we are born

930
00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:25.570
with these skills or we are born

931
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:33.080
um in a way that makes us have these skills very, very, very likely, you know,

932
00:48:33.939 --> 00:48:37.040
OK, again, broad brush, let's not go into detail

933
00:48:37.389 --> 00:48:38.189
uh here.

934
00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:41.199
But there was this other approach where people say

935
00:48:41.469 --> 00:48:43.649
yes, genes play a little bit of a role,

936
00:48:43.659 --> 00:48:46.939
but they play only a small role and they play an enabling role.

937
00:48:47.179 --> 00:48:47.550
They pro

938
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:49.800
provide a small platform

939
00:48:49.919 --> 00:48:55.020
on which we build these skills and the skills themselves, these special skills,

940
00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:57.520
they are built into us

941
00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:59.000
socially.

942
00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.870
They are built into us by culture itself.

943
00:49:03.159 --> 00:49:06.939
Very unintrusive idea. Basically what these people say

944
00:49:07.959 --> 00:49:11.639
at the forefront of this old movement right now is uh Cecilia Hayes.

945
00:49:12.699 --> 00:49:14.320
What these people are saying is

946
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.830
we culturally learn

947
00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.479
how to culturally learn.

948
00:49:20.219 --> 00:49:20.719
OK.

949
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:24.419
So why am I, why am I mentioning this? You will know this anyway, but

950
00:49:24.919 --> 00:49:27.399
I'm mentioning this because if that is true,

951
00:49:27.409 --> 00:49:29.919
let's just assume for this moment that this is true.

952
00:49:29.929 --> 00:49:31.649
This is the correct way. Let's just assume

953
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:33.290
then

954
00:49:34.419 --> 00:49:37.989
humans themselves learn these things culturally.

955
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:43.830
And if we learn this thing culturally, it stands to reason that perhaps

956
00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:48.639
the ways in which we transmit these skills, we could

957
00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:51.169
apply these skills

958
00:49:51.729 --> 00:49:53.810
and make other species

959
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.169
have these skills too

960
00:49:56.719 --> 00:49:59.889
that we can find soft means to

961
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.370
install

962
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.810
again, broad brush, install in their brains,

963
00:50:05.129 --> 00:50:07.330
completely new skills, new abilities,

964
00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:11.090
including new abilities to culturally learn.

965
00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:12.169
Uh

966
00:50:13.469 --> 00:50:15.530
And indeed, it seems to be,

967
00:50:15.699 --> 00:50:19.489
you know, this does not mean that this whole approach of the CD A is is

968
00:50:19.689 --> 00:50:23.290
completely correct. Although these days, I tend to believe that

969
00:50:23.699 --> 00:50:25.030
maybe it is right,

970
00:50:25.679 --> 00:50:30.110
but it certainly is in favor of this approach that we see that if we train,

971
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.389
if we put our minds to it, if we put our intentions behind it,

972
00:50:33.399 --> 00:50:35.209
if we apply everything that we can

973
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:39.169
to make apes copy, nohow,

974
00:50:39.929 --> 00:50:41.000
we succeeded.

975
00:50:41.729 --> 00:50:44.429
We can, we can make them

976
00:50:44.669 --> 00:50:48.770
different apes, we can change them, we can cognitively change them.

977
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.110
We install something new

978
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:52.149
in their brains

979
00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:55.510
that they wouldn't otherwise have. That's the other implication.

980
00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:59.159
And that is what happens intentionally or not.

981
00:50:59.169 --> 00:51:02.899
You know, it depends on the study uh when we incarcerate

982
00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:03.760
apes.

983
00:51:04.669 --> 00:51:05.310
Now,

984
00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:07.760
that means then

985
00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:11.439
because no ape is running around in the wild

986
00:51:11.449 --> 00:51:13.350
and no human is running around in the wild,

987
00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.760
inculturated apes.

988
00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:17.610
And this is not the case now and this hasn't been

989
00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:22.330
the case in any time in the evolutionary past of apes

990
00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.250
that we need to exclude.

991
00:51:25.689 --> 00:51:30.429
This is just very, very simple logic. We need to exclude this incarcerated apes

992
00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:32.149
um from our equation.

993
00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:33.790
They

994
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:36.409
cannot provide the answer. They are interesting

995
00:51:36.649 --> 00:51:39.479
if you want to study the whole approach of C VA and so on.

996
00:51:39.489 --> 00:51:42.850
They're very interesting, you know, for these other reasons. But

997
00:51:42.989 --> 00:51:47.300
if we want to understand what, why apes have and what, you know,

998
00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:49.510
how they make their cultures

999
00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.084
and by implication, what our last common answer that

1000
00:51:52.195 --> 00:51:52.245
uh

1001
00:51:52.725 --> 00:51:54.304
we must fully exclude

1002
00:51:54.554 --> 00:51:56.985
uh incarcerated apes. That's why I

1003
00:51:57.125 --> 00:52:02.094
whenever I absolutely can. I try not to study incarcerated apes. You know,

1004
00:52:02.304 --> 00:52:06.445
the only time when we do is if they are intermixed with un incarcerated apes

1005
00:52:06.584 --> 00:52:11.175
and then we hope that the un incarcerated apes come first and test first. You know,

1006
00:52:11.334 --> 00:52:12.705
then it's interpretable.

1007
00:52:12.715 --> 00:52:16.425
If the incarcerated apes do it first, then it's uninterpretable.

1008
00:52:17.879 --> 00:52:18.280
Ok.

1009
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:21.350
So, uh I mean, I wasn't planning on asking you about this,

1010
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:26.370
but since you mentioned Cecilia Hayes there, I've had an interview with her

1011
00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:31.979
in 2019. And so I, I can't really avoid asking you this now. So

1012
00:52:32.169 --> 00:52:35.175
uh I would like to ask you more about

1013
00:52:35.544 --> 00:52:38.415
what do you think about her

1014
00:52:38.544 --> 00:52:41.854
approach to culture? I mean, to what extent,

1015
00:52:42.195 --> 00:52:44.205
but at this point in time,

1016
00:52:44.215 --> 00:52:49.435
would you agree or disagree with her proposals and her claims?

1017
00:52:49.445 --> 00:52:50.185
And

1018
00:52:50.679 --> 00:52:55.860
if she, if she was correct, what do you think would be

1019
00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:01.439
the implications in terms of how we approach culture

1020
00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:02.429
from

1021
00:53:02.639 --> 00:53:04.330
an evolutionary sl

1022
00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:11.179
slash phylogenetic perspective? Because I mean, wouldn't that change the game

1023
00:53:11.409 --> 00:53:15.780
uh to some extent because there, there, there are people.

1024
00:53:15.873 --> 00:53:18.792
Uh I, I mean, and I'm not saying they are wrong but

1025
00:53:18.972 --> 00:53:20.693
uh when it comes to

1026
00:53:20.893 --> 00:53:26.212
how culture evolved, uh they tend to think about particular

1027
00:53:26.452 --> 00:53:31.822
uh cognitive mechanisms as having to be set in place

1028
00:53:31.833 --> 00:53:34.893
in a particular species for it to be able to

1029
00:53:35.282 --> 00:53:39.702
either uh have culture entirely or not,

1030
00:53:39.873 --> 00:53:44.766
or to be able to have specific kinds

1031
00:53:44.775 --> 00:53:49.345
of culture or cultural manifestations like language,

1032
00:53:49.355 --> 00:53:50.525
for example, right?

1033
00:53:50.795 --> 00:53:55.466
Uh But I, but I mean, I, if she was correct,

1034
00:53:55.605 --> 00:54:01.206
wouldn't that have a big impact on how we think about culture,

1035
00:54:01.216 --> 00:54:04.355
particularly from a biological perspective?

1036
00:54:04.625 --> 00:54:06.156
Several people in the past,

1037
00:54:06.669 --> 00:54:11.090
I had proposed that this whole idea of having all these modules in the brain

1038
00:54:11.419 --> 00:54:12.040
uh

1039
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:14.610
being evolved separately and so on, it,

1040
00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.729
it doesn't really work because we don't have,

1041
00:54:17.739 --> 00:54:22.320
this is actually an argument made by Mike to Marcelo in his 99 book,

1042
00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:25.209
The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition.

1043
00:54:25.739 --> 00:54:30.770
So Mike went a long way in a similar direction as as Hayes,

1044
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:35.679
but he actually stopped short only of uh for a few stops, let's say,

1045
00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:39.929
um he said his argument was we don't have much time,

1046
00:54:40.219 --> 00:54:43.760
uh evolutionarily speaking, if we look at archaeology and so on

1047
00:54:43.899 --> 00:54:49.860
uh to explain the human condition. And so this is just not very convincing

1048
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.260
that we would have enough time to have all these modules installed in our brain.

1049
00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.209
There are the reasons why

1050
00:54:56.739 --> 00:54:59.060
this was always a little bit dubious

1051
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:05.600
and Hayes just, just, I mean, she did a wonderful job, she went some steps further

1052
00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.070
and she said, OK,

1053
00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:12.939
uh where Mike said, we have some adaptations such as he focused on imitation,

1054
00:55:12.949 --> 00:55:15.310
a sub form of, of know how copying fine

1055
00:55:15.689 --> 00:55:17.659
uh general perfect direction.

1056
00:55:17.919 --> 00:55:18.540
Um

1057
00:55:19.409 --> 00:55:20.040
uh Haman

1058
00:55:20.439 --> 00:55:21.409
said, even that

1059
00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.709
even that has a cultural origin, right?

1060
00:55:25.149 --> 00:55:25.989
Uh And,

1061
00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:30.030
and in her book, and in her B BS paper and so on.

1062
00:55:30.139 --> 00:55:31.429
She listed

1063
00:55:31.909 --> 00:55:33.489
quite convincing

1064
00:55:33.649 --> 00:55:37.790
data sets and I'm sure you talked about that in the interview.

1065
00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:40.550
It's quite convincing the case that the

1066
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.889
cultural learning of cultural learning is the thing

1067
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.030
in humans.

1068
00:55:45.419 --> 00:55:49.719
But for my own approach, just because this is important for, for, for me here as well.

1069
00:55:49.739 --> 00:55:51.959
For my own approach, it doesn't really matter

1070
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:55.340
if there's no how copy this super individual,

1071
00:55:55.350 --> 00:56:00.060
know how copying if we humans get the genetically broadly speaking

1072
00:56:00.189 --> 00:56:01.639
or culturally,

1073
00:56:02.489 --> 00:56:04.760
as long as we have it,

1074
00:56:05.469 --> 00:56:07.770
right? So my approach is mute

1075
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.729
on where it came from

1076
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.689
it. I'm not saying it doesn't matter, but it's

1077
00:56:14.449 --> 00:56:17.389
for all current purposes is mute on where it came from.

1078
00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:18.600
Um

1079
00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:22.360
uh As long as it's there and as long it is

1080
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:26.679
as it is uh meaningfully link to all these phenomenon here.

1081
00:56:26.689 --> 00:56:27.679
And I think it is

1082
00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:32.280
uh then um you know, that that approach still works

1083
00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:34.199
because in either case,

1084
00:56:34.899 --> 00:56:38.080
I would say in either case, you have this missing

1085
00:56:38.399 --> 00:56:38.679
in the,

1086
00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:41.800
you don't really see the

1087
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.899
signature signal

1088
00:56:44.449 --> 00:56:48.439
that super individual know how copying would have led to

1089
00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:50.479
in wild a culture,

1090
00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:52.820
right? And we don't see super

1091
00:56:52.989 --> 00:56:55.580
individual know how copying spontaneously either.

1092
00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:56.399
So

1093
00:56:56.929 --> 00:57:01.699
putting it all together, you know, it doesn't matter where we humans have it from

1094
00:57:02.139 --> 00:57:07.340
what seems to be a factor that apes don't have it at all or

1095
00:57:07.639 --> 00:57:11.679
they have it to such a low degree or so or show it so rarely

1096
00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:14.729
that it really doesn't translate in special types of

1097
00:57:14.739 --> 00:57:17.510
culture that would be similar to the human spec

1098
00:57:17.635 --> 00:57:20.054
type of culture that we have here, right?

1099
00:57:20.264 --> 00:57:20.895
Um

1100
00:57:21.014 --> 00:57:26.435
I should also say that maybe there are other species that can copy super individual,

1101
00:57:26.445 --> 00:57:29.854
know how you know in some domains, some people talk about whale

1102
00:57:30.114 --> 00:57:33.885
song copying, you know, in a super individual area, there is

1103
00:57:34.125 --> 00:57:35.985
there was some debate around that too.

1104
00:57:36.104 --> 00:57:39.495
But be that as it may here, we are talking about the apes,

1105
00:57:39.715 --> 00:57:42.165
right? And they are the phylogenetic

1106
00:57:42.284 --> 00:57:44.175
uh meaningful comparison.

1107
00:57:44.429 --> 00:57:49.530
And whenever we looked, uh we could not find these kind of things in the apes.

1108
00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:49.790
OK.

1109
00:57:50.169 --> 00:57:56.209
So um let me ask you now about uh another kind of questions. So

1110
00:57:56.489 --> 00:58:00.159
uh we've already mentioned a few times during the interview

1111
00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:06.110
uh social learning. So and of course to study ape social learning,

1112
00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:11.719
people use different kinds of tasks. And the question I would like to ask you is

1113
00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:16.610
do you think that the tasks that are commonly used to study ape,

1114
00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:18.889
social learning are suitable?

1115
00:58:20.489 --> 00:58:23.250
Yes. Yeah, I mean suitable for what? Right.

1116
00:58:24.179 --> 00:58:26.500
I have to be quite blunt here.

1117
00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:27.719
Um

1118
00:58:28.159 --> 00:58:30.429
My blunt reaction would be to say

1119
00:58:32.669 --> 00:58:36.050
they are claimed to be suitable for certain purposes,

1120
00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:39.750
the kind of purposes that we talk about today in this interview.

1121
00:58:39.899 --> 00:58:41.739
And I think for that purpose,

1122
00:58:41.979 --> 00:58:43.320
they prove to be

1123
00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.260
unsuitable.

1124
00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:49.989
Um Let me, let me explain a little bit. The main task that is being used.

1125
00:58:50.939 --> 00:58:56.659
Um The main task that is being used is the so called um, two target task.

1126
00:58:57.189 --> 00:58:59.780
It's essentially a task you can imagine.

1127
00:58:59.959 --> 00:59:03.919
Uh if, if we have a box here and this is a box here and then there is a,

1128
00:59:03.929 --> 00:59:06.620
there is a door and the door can be pulled open,

1129
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:07.780
it can be pushed

1130
00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.419
over, right. So you push it, you get the food inside, you pull it, you get the

1131
00:59:12.409 --> 00:59:16.550
and then one group of Apes sees the the pushing, you know,

1132
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.750
another group of Apes sees the pulling

1133
00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:20.820
and then people say,

1134
00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:25.449
uh oh, and the result is frequently, not always, but frequently.

1135
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:26.229
Yes.

1136
00:59:26.239 --> 00:59:28.370
The ones that saw the pushing, they,

1137
00:59:28.379 --> 00:59:32.610
they do the pushing and the ones that saw the pulling, they do the pulling good.

1138
00:59:33.629 --> 00:59:36.689
And but, but then on this level, there is no disagreement.

1139
00:59:36.699 --> 00:59:40.639
I've done these tasks myself. And, you know, sometimes I find I found this too.

1140
00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.729
So the phenomenon is not a question,

1141
00:59:43.429 --> 00:59:44.399
the interpretation

1142
00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:49.159
and the interpretation is that some people, first of all, they then claimed

1143
00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:53.489
we are looking at action, copy, at the behavior copy.

1144
00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:56.909
But that can't be true because for example, here, you know,

1145
00:59:56.919 --> 01:00:01.290
I can make it so that you don't even see my actions and these things move.

1146
01:00:01.409 --> 01:00:05.330
In fact, that was a point that Celia Hayes made in, I think in the nineties.

1147
01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:08.030
But apart even from that,

1148
01:00:08.159 --> 01:00:11.429
apart, even from that, there is a bigger problem here.

1149
01:00:11.719 --> 01:00:14.389
The bigger problem is that people then thought

1150
01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.229
doing these tasks.

1151
01:00:16.469 --> 01:00:19.679
Um we find special types of learning,

1152
01:00:19.689 --> 01:00:23.270
special types of learning that we only find in the human case.

1153
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.629
And that explain all of the human culture here.

1154
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.760
Now, that's a huge problem because

1155
01:00:29.169 --> 01:00:35.840
it turns out that not just humans and not just apes copy in these tasks,

1156
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:38.800
dogs copy in these tasks.

1157
01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:42.459
OK? Then you might say dogs are domesticated and so on, you know,

1158
01:00:42.669 --> 01:00:47.979
but recently, uh also reptiles copy in these tasks, right?

1159
01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:53.060
So if you want to take this task performance and these two target tasks

1160
01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.030
as a special way of learning,

1161
01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.879
you have got a problem because then you would expect reptiles.

1162
01:00:59.969 --> 01:01:02.780
I have nothing against reptiles, you know, but you don't just see it, you,

1163
01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:03.739
you don't see it,

1164
01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:06.780
then you would expect reptiles to have humanlike culture too.

1165
01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:08.389
That really is the key.

1166
01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.179
That is the first hint that,

1167
01:01:10.469 --> 01:01:14.310
you know, we have been barking up the wrong tree with these tasks. I can say that

1168
01:01:14.419 --> 01:01:18.360
because I've done these tasks myself, right? So I think it's, it's fair if I,

1169
01:01:18.489 --> 01:01:23.530
if I say this done this task myself and I think we, we have, we have been doing

1170
01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:24.889
the wrong thing there.

1171
01:01:25.639 --> 01:01:29.810
The other big big clue is the empirical finding that

1172
01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.860
if you look whether the apes, in this case, the apes,

1173
01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:39.060
if they can pull the door open on their own without having seen it pulled open

1174
01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:44.860
or if they can push the door open without having seen the door being pushed open,

1175
01:01:45.489 --> 01:01:49.310
not just the door of the board removal, leber movements.

1176
01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.320
You know, there are different versions of these cars. In all cases.

1177
01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:53.709
We've done a review on that

1178
01:01:53.949 --> 01:01:55.919
together with Lydia Hopper and Carl Von

1179
01:01:56.139 --> 01:01:58.790
SYK. Um, we've done a review and we found,

1180
01:01:59.419 --> 01:02:00.510
well, actually,

1181
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.020
uh as you might imagine because they don't sound very difficult these tasks,

1182
01:02:05.149 --> 01:02:10.429
actually, the apes can just solve these tasks in all of these ways on their own.

1183
01:02:10.709 --> 01:02:14.330
This is of importance for the current interview as well because

1184
01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:21.600
as I said earlier, we what we need to find is know how copying that is the copying of,

1185
01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:23.479
know how that is super individual.

1186
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:27.449
So we are back to the same kind of um learning

1187
01:02:28.185 --> 01:02:30.495
in these cases that we already talked about

1188
01:02:30.504 --> 01:02:33.155
when we talked about the orangutan not cracking.

1189
01:02:33.165 --> 01:02:36.955
If you can potentially develop this, know how on your own.

1190
01:02:36.965 --> 01:02:37.625
Anyway,

1191
01:02:37.635 --> 01:02:40.534
then all you need is know how triggering you need

1192
01:02:40.544 --> 01:02:44.274
triggering of know how that is latently already there.

1193
01:02:44.695 --> 01:02:50.024
That's very different from copying, know how that you could not produce on your own.

1194
01:02:50.195 --> 01:02:54.895
So for this reason, these two target tasks and there are many, many of them and so on,

1195
01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:55.334
you know,

1196
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:57.530
for this purpose,

1197
01:02:57.879 --> 01:02:59.699
they, they just don't work,

1198
01:02:59.969 --> 01:03:01.659
they work for other purposes.

1199
01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:05.110
Uh People are very interested in so-called social learning biases

1200
01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.850
and so on this is like the traffic lights for,

1201
01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:10.520
for social learning under which circumstance to your social learning.

1202
01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:11.310
That's fine.

1203
01:03:11.699 --> 01:03:14.370
Absolutely. You can use these tasks for that. You know,

1204
01:03:14.475 --> 01:03:19.195
there is very nice uh papers by Rachel Candle and others and so on. Very nice.

1205
01:03:19.205 --> 01:03:19.895
You can do that.

1206
01:03:20.104 --> 01:03:23.435
But for the current purpose, you know, human like culture and so on,

1207
01:03:23.705 --> 01:03:26.465
um it turned out empirically, you cannot, you know,

1208
01:03:26.754 --> 01:03:30.375
uh you can design maybe better tasks uh that, that,

1209
01:03:30.514 --> 01:03:33.094
you know, the the animals cannot solve on their own.

1210
01:03:33.395 --> 01:03:35.445
Um But you would have to make sure

1211
01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:38.054
in these tasks that they are about, know how

1212
01:03:38.439 --> 01:03:41.189
not about no, where, no, what and so on.

1213
01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:42.120
So

1214
01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:45.770
again, as always, the devil is in the detail. I told you at the very beginning,

1215
01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:48.669
culture is a slippery concept and it becomes

1216
01:03:48.679 --> 01:03:51.139
even more slippery when you make these distinctions.

1217
01:03:51.149 --> 01:03:54.020
But I would argue we have to make these distinctions

1218
01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.909
otherwise we don't get it, you know,

1219
01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:58.139
the distinctions between human and ape culture.

1220
01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:02.270
And so what would be in your opinion,

1221
01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:07.189
suitable tasks to studying ape social learning?

1222
01:04:07.889 --> 01:04:08.729
Yes. So

1223
01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:10.989
this task exists.

1224
01:04:11.479 --> 01:04:12.389
Um

1225
01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:18.379
The first was done by uh by a consortium of, of researchers. Um Michael Marcelo

1226
01:04:18.629 --> 01:04:20.649
was there, Joseph Cole was there as well.

1227
01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.310
And what they did is they

1228
01:04:22.419 --> 01:04:25.429
essentially they um made some chimpanzees

1229
01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.229
learn new begging gestures.

1230
01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:29.300
Mhm

1231
01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:35.689
Translated into this interview in, in uh one would say they taught, they taught,

1232
01:04:35.699 --> 01:04:36.750
they trained them,

1233
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:40.770
they trained them, you know, this is not to be confused with copying these,

1234
01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:43.280
these animals didn't copy Mike and just happen.

1235
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:44.090
And the others, you know,

1236
01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:48.050
they train these animals to show, you know how

1237
01:04:48.379 --> 01:04:51.159
to beg from humans, know how good.

1238
01:04:51.709 --> 01:04:58.250
And uh and then uh I think 18 observer chimpanzees saw this new, know how

1239
01:04:58.449 --> 01:05:00.500
be being used as a begging gesture,

1240
01:05:00.959 --> 01:05:01.409
you know,

1241
01:05:01.489 --> 01:05:05.610
and what happened is uh these uh these observers saw it and

1242
01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:09.780
every time this uh train chimpanzees would use this new begging gesture,

1243
01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:10.850
they would get food.

1244
01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:12.760
It was a perfect begging gesture, you know,

1245
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:14.840
from the perspective of these observers.

1246
01:05:15.129 --> 01:05:20.590
Now, did any of these observers copy this new know-how, including I think one son

1247
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.010
of one of the demonstrators, you know, so it's,

1248
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.310
it's exactly this mother uh kid relationship that

1249
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.590
we always see uh in these wild shows,

1250
01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:28.989
you know,

1251
01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.030
no,

1252
01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:34.870
not a single one of them copied uh any of these know hows, right? So

1253
01:05:35.219 --> 01:05:36.659
these, these are suitable,

1254
01:05:36.945 --> 01:05:40.985
you make them ideally, you make it so that you've got a large baseline.

1255
01:05:40.995 --> 01:05:44.294
You, you check really if they show any of this uh no

1256
01:05:44.485 --> 01:05:44.504
how

1257
01:05:44.854 --> 01:05:46.685
on their own spontaneously.

1258
01:05:47.054 --> 01:05:52.004
And then if they don't, you train them to show that and you show this to others.

1259
01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:54.485
And I myself have because I always thought this

1260
01:05:54.495 --> 01:05:56.495
is exactly the kind of study that we need.

1261
01:05:56.504 --> 01:05:58.284
This is the gold standard study.

1262
01:05:58.544 --> 01:06:01.925
So my group uh we have done a couple of these studies

1263
01:06:02.135 --> 01:06:05.205
and overall, I think we have now tested,

1264
01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:11.739
I, I wanna say over 100 apes different species, you know, all general actually.

1265
01:06:12.389 --> 01:06:17.929
And um in no cases, in no cases, did we find any time

1266
01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:20.360
any super individual know I copy?

1267
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.780
This is very strong evidence

1268
01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:25.810
that our hypotheses that we held

1269
01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:28.110
uh was always correct. Right.

1270
01:06:28.149 --> 01:06:32.639
Um Or let me, let me, let me put it so that it's easier digestible.

1271
01:06:32.649 --> 01:06:34.570
Maybe for, for those still skeptical,

1272
01:06:35.409 --> 01:06:39.820
given that we tested, I think over 100 chimpanzees uh oh no,

1273
01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:41.879
over 100 apes of different general

1274
01:06:42.830 --> 01:06:45.889
and that none of them ever copied super individual

1275
01:06:45.899 --> 01:06:49.969
know how in a technical domain in a non-technical domain

1276
01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:50.669
uh from,

1277
01:06:50.679 --> 01:06:55.590
from aid demonstrators from human demonstrators and majority conditions.

1278
01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.530
So several showed them, you know,

1279
01:06:57.719 --> 01:06:59.510
uh in all kinds of ways.

1280
01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:04.070
And given that we never found any super individual know our copying,

1281
01:07:04.469 --> 01:07:07.449
not it, it supports the view that if

1282
01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:10.239
apes have supervision or

1283
01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:10.889
copy

1284
01:07:11.439 --> 01:07:14.330
they applied either super rarely,

1285
01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:15.510
right?

1286
01:07:15.709 --> 01:07:17.629
Or are very weakly.

1287
01:07:18.189 --> 01:07:21.159
This is of high importance because all the cultural

1288
01:07:21.169 --> 01:07:25.350
evolution models show that you need a certain threshold level

1289
01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:27.550
of both the frequency,

1290
01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:32.030
the reliability of the social learning and the strength of this social learning.

1291
01:07:32.739 --> 01:07:36.330
So said in this way, even if they sometimes very rarely do this,

1292
01:07:36.689 --> 01:07:38.169
it just wouldn't be enough

1293
01:07:38.689 --> 01:07:41.489
to have them have this kind of human culture

1294
01:07:41.639 --> 01:07:44.350
that we humans have right. So that is,

1295
01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:45.010
that is,

1296
01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.500
I think a strong statement that we can make with

1297
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:50.330
the data that we have at hand right now.

1298
01:07:51.929 --> 01:07:53.300
OK. And so

1299
01:07:53.780 --> 01:08:00.840
what can we tell from those data then? Because I would imagine that

1300
01:08:01.199 --> 01:08:08.100
uh one claim that someone could make, could make is something like, OK. So then

1301
01:08:08.989 --> 01:08:11.209
does this all mean that

1302
01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:17.430
uh apes do not socially learn and they do not

1303
01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:24.009
and cannot have culture? I mean, I is that a plausible claim to make

1304
01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:27.129
it is not a plausible claim? I have said

1305
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:33.009
extremely explicitly. I think in the last uh paper uh I said

1306
01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:36.049
apes, I think I quote myself correctly here.

1307
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:39.180
Apes have culture and nobody denies this.

1308
01:08:39.459 --> 01:08:41.580
I could not say it more strongly, right?

1309
01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:44.140
Apes have culture. Nobody denies this.

1310
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:46.080
Nobody I know denies this.

1311
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.899
But what we need is a pluralistic

1312
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:51.009
approach to culture.

1313
01:08:51.379 --> 01:08:54.770
Not all cultures are created equal, right? And so

1314
01:08:54.939 --> 01:09:00.479
apes have many different types of culture. They have very, we know this securely.

1315
01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:02.750
They have cultures of know what to eat.

1316
01:09:03.618 --> 01:09:06.999
Maybe they would even starve if they wouldn't have this culture, know what to eat.

1317
01:09:07.008 --> 01:09:08.087
It's very strong in that

1318
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:11.328
they learn socially what to eat, you know, from those around them,

1319
01:09:11.337 --> 01:09:12.559
from their mothers and so on.

1320
01:09:12.889 --> 01:09:15.599
That's a, that's a culture, but it's a different culture,

1321
01:09:15.868 --> 01:09:16.917
but they clearly have it.

1322
01:09:17.618 --> 01:09:21.328
They also have got to know where cultures, where to be, you know,

1323
01:09:21.417 --> 01:09:26.337
and they also quite surely know their territory and so on, you know, so they

1324
01:09:26.457 --> 01:09:28.479
socially learn that too.

1325
01:09:28.608 --> 01:09:30.337
So they've got all kinds of cultures,

1326
01:09:30.528 --> 01:09:33.559
but when it comes to know how their culture

1327
01:09:33.663 --> 01:09:34.962
is basically

1328
01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:37.124
uh uh about no le

1329
01:09:37.292 --> 01:09:38.844
and know how that they trigger.

1330
01:09:39.313 --> 01:09:40.203
In each case.

1331
01:09:40.624 --> 01:09:43.374
Uh I use this term, by the way from Dan Sperber,

1332
01:09:43.383 --> 01:09:46.252
he made this very useful distinction between the stuff

1333
01:09:46.264 --> 01:09:49.673
that is already kind of there and just needs triggering

1334
01:09:49.943 --> 01:09:52.163
and the stuff that really needs copying.

1335
01:09:52.453 --> 01:09:53.854
And um Andrew Bask

1336
01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.333
and I, we have recently worked on that to

1337
01:09:56.463 --> 01:09:59.664
lay more detail in, in that it's a, it's a paper and press,

1338
01:09:59.673 --> 01:10:01.244
I think you recently interviewed Andrew

1339
01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.419
as well.

1340
01:10:02.479 --> 01:10:05.509
So um so that that difference is very,

1341
01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.259
very important when it comes to know how the know how is triggered

1342
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:14.020
but not copied in the sense that we have been talking about this year.

1343
01:10:14.189 --> 01:10:15.379
But in order

1344
01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:19.180
in order to have all of these things and language, you know,

1345
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:22.129
and many other subdomains of human culture,

1346
01:10:22.279 --> 01:10:23.979
we need know how copy

1347
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:27.049
and without it, we we, we cannot get that. So

1348
01:10:27.509 --> 01:10:29.520
um I would even say it like this

1349
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:31.850
apes have many types of culture,

1350
01:10:31.979 --> 01:10:36.959
but they do not seem to share in this special type of culture that we humans have

1351
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.120
and maybe other species have maybe whales and all right.

1352
01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.979
But I would also say that this also doesn't

1353
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:47.720
mean that humans have all types of possible culture

1354
01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.520
that is also not the case bats, for example,

1355
01:10:50.529 --> 01:10:53.640
they communicate in ranges that we can't communicate in.

1356
01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:56.879
So, you know, we wouldn't have this kind of uh culture if,

1357
01:10:56.890 --> 01:11:00.134
if the bats have special types culture based on that, right?

1358
01:11:00.285 --> 01:11:00.834
So

1359
01:11:00.964 --> 01:11:04.475
you need to always look what kind of cultures do these species

1360
01:11:04.604 --> 01:11:07.015
show. And we see that there is a difference

1361
01:11:07.345 --> 01:11:10.674
in the kinds of cultures that apes and humans show just like there was a

1362
01:11:10.685 --> 01:11:13.424
difference between uh different other kinds of

1363
01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.254
-- animals in the cultures
-- that they show.

1364
01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:20.669
OK. So with all of that in mind, I have one last question then.

1365
01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:25.299
So we've talked about uh differences or potential differences

1366
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:28.549
and similarities between ape culture and human culture.

1367
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.580
A a different kind of question

1368
01:11:31.759 --> 01:11:34.120
and related one is

1369
01:11:34.319 --> 01:11:38.029
where do those differences come from?

1370
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:39.290
Yes.

1371
01:11:40.009 --> 01:11:41.589
Uh Well, Ricardo, uh

1372
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:43.629
this is the million dollar question

1373
01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:45.109
and um

1374
01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:49.009
and I don't think we have a very good answer to that

1375
01:11:49.229 --> 01:11:51.220
yet, you know. So I think

1376
01:11:51.839 --> 01:11:55.109
there is some good answers maybe more convincing

1377
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:58.979
uh to some than to others, to all the other questions that you had.

1378
01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:01.180
Um But for this one,

1379
01:12:01.529 --> 01:12:02.770
we are

1380
01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:04.660
quite in the dark

1381
01:12:04.839 --> 01:12:05.060
yet.

1382
01:12:05.509 --> 01:12:07.919
I have argued and I might have used the

1383
01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:10.060
same argument in the last interview that we did.

1384
01:12:10.479 --> 01:12:13.000
Um I have argued in the past that in order

1385
01:12:13.009 --> 01:12:15.879
to try to shed light on this particular question,

1386
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:19.720
why we got the way that we got? And so on,

1387
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:22.189
we should first answer the question.

1388
01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:23.149
When

1389
01:12:23.279 --> 01:12:26.180
did we go the way that we got first?

1390
01:12:26.319 --> 01:12:31.569
And if we have a good understanding of when we became like that, then

1391
01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:36.029
uh we can look at the circumstances that acted at the time and at the time,

1392
01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.189
directly preceding it.

1393
01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:40.560
And that is ultimately the reason why even though

1394
01:12:40.569 --> 01:12:43.500
I was a psychologist and a biologist before,

1395
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:49.200
um that now I still maintain these directions, but that I'm now an archaeologist.

1396
01:12:49.209 --> 01:12:54.350
So now I'm I'm trying to understand this when this is my, my current quest as

1397
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:58.450
great. So, Doctor 10,

1398
01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:00.810
uh as I said at the beginning,

1399
01:13:00.819 --> 01:13:05.209
I'm also leaving a link in the description box to our first interview.

1400
01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:08.609
Uh Would you like to mention again where people

1401
01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:11.209
can find you and your work on the internet?

1402
01:13:12.069 --> 01:13:14.370
So uh if you Google my name or it will,

1403
01:13:14.379 --> 01:13:17.040
the things that pop up will be the Google scholar account.

1404
01:13:17.049 --> 01:13:21.439
Of course, my, my website would be probably uh currently the best place.

1405
01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:25.569
-- It's a, it's a Google site as well and, and easy to find. Thank you
-- so much.

1406
01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:29.169
OK. Thank you so much again for coming on the show.

1408
