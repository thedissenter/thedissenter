00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:02.829
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the,

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.739
the Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.050
I'm joined by Doctor Mark Rank. He is Herbert

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.550
Herbert S Adley Professor of Social Welfare at the

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.909
George Warren Braun School of Social Work at Washington

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.420
University in Saint Louis. He is widely recognized as

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.659
one of the foremost experts and speakers on issues

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.350
of poverty, inequality, social justice. And today we're talking

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.819
about his latest book, The Random Factor, How Chance

10
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.130
and Luck profoundly shape our Lives and the world

11
00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:38.810
around us. So, Doctor Rank, welcome to the show.

12
00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:40.560
It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.729
Oh, great. It's, it's fantastic to be with you.

14
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.200
So just to start off with, I guess that

15
00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:51.450
it would be important for people who are listening

16
00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:53.919
and watching to have a better understanding of what

17
00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.240
you mean by words like random chance Luck because

18
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.430
sometimes it's not exactly clear what they mean, particularly

19
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.760
in this sort of context of your book. So

20
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.099
yeah, so I, I in the beginning of the

21
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.949
book, it's a good place to start to define

22
00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:15.839
what we mean by these terms. And I think

23
00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:19.410
all of them Chance Luck and randomness are related

24
00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:22.089
to the idea that there are things that happen,

25
00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:24.739
which cannot be predicted, which are out of the

26
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.419
blue. But the terms chance and luck usually refer

27
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.220
more to the individual. Whereas the term random or

28
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.650
randomness really refers more to sort of the wider

29
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.250
system or the structure. So we, we often talk

30
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.739
about chance and luck events as applying to, to

31
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.019
individuals. There's also a further distinction one can make

32
00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:52.750
between chance and luck in that chance is a

33
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.150
more neutral term. Uh When we talk about chance

34
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.629
events happen to people that could be good, it

35
00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.989
could be bad. When we talk about luck, we

36
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.029
generally refer to either good luck or bad luck.

37
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.210
And so it has, um it has that connotation

38
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.259
to it. So that's, that's kind of AAA bit

39
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.059
about those, those um what, what is meant by

40
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.050
those terms?

41
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.949
Mhm. Where do you think that this very common

42
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.770
idea? I'm not sure if we could call it

43
00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:27.020
an ideology, possibly not. But this common idea that

44
00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.839
people have that we sort of have complete control

45
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.360
or near complete control over what happens in our

46
00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:36.529
lives. It stems from.

47
00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.520
Yeah. You know, so, um I, you know, I'm

48
00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:44.190
here in the United States and uh you know,

49
00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.490
one of the things within the United States, one

50
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.679
of the sort of historical uh themes has been

51
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.750
the whole idea of rugged individualism, of self reliance,

52
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.029
of individual agency. And there's the idea that you

53
00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:03.350
determine your destiny, that through your efforts, through your,

54
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.669
you know, your decisions, through your skills, you make

55
00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:10.509
your future. And that's, that's been a real strong

56
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.350
emphasis here. Uh You know, II I don't feel

57
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.899
as confident talking about other cultural contexts, but I

58
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.089
know within the United States has a very strong

59
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.179
theme. And so, you know, one of the things

60
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.139
that I talk about is the idea of chance

61
00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:29.190
and luck are, uh, counter to that, uh, you,

62
00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.070
you don't have control. Now we'll talk about later.

63
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.020
Some of the things that you do have control

64
00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:36.479
of in terms of chance and luck. But, you

65
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.750
know, things that are unpredictable and that can happen

66
00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.960
to you are beyond your sort of individual agency

67
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.619
or individualism. So, um, so, but this idea that,

68
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.869
you know, that we determine our own destiny is,

69
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.630
is a strong theme and, and so the, the

70
00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.779
idea in the book kind of runs cou counter

71
00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:55.229
at least somewhat counter to that.

72
00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:58.979
Mhm. It's very interesting that at a certain point

73
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.229
in your book, you go back in history a

74
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.380
little bit and talk about how historically people probably

75
00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:13.729
have thought about luck, chance randomness in different ways.

76
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.710
I mean, please correct me if I'm wrong. But

77
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.820
isn't it the case? At least when I read

78
00:04:18.988 --> 00:04:24.239
the stuff from, uh, people from more ancient civilizations

79
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.559
that they were more willing to acknowledge the role

80
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.010
that Chen and Luck played in their lives. I

81
00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:34.260
mean, of course, many times they attributed that to

82
00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:38.320
supernatural forces like the whims of the gods, but

83
00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:41.559
at least they acknowledge that. Right.

84
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.649
Absolutely. Absolutely. So, you know, my, the, the first

85
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.989
chapter in the book is called The Wheel of

86
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.359
Fortune. And that comes from the goddess Fortuna in

87
00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:54.420
Roman Times, in which she was. And she was

88
00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:57.519
a very important, um God to the Romans. And

89
00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.820
in fact, one of the most important because she's

90
00:04:59.829 --> 00:05:02.799
the one that they thought, you know, determines helps

91
00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:06.140
determine our destiny or our fortunes. And one of

92
00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:08.350
the things that, that she was known for was

93
00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:12.019
having a wheel of fortune and she would spin

94
00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.410
this wheel. And uh you know, as, as Bo

95
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.179
Bo Boethius, you know, the, the, the Roman philosopher

96
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.119
wrote, she took delight in having people that were

97
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.899
on the top of the wheel come down and

98
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.500
people on the bottom come up. And so it's

99
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.399
this idea that, you know, chance and luck that

100
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.440
go around in a, in a, in a, in

101
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.549
a wheel. Um So, yeah, definitely, there was a

102
00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:37.589
lot of emphasis on the importance of chance and

103
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.299
luck, particularly in ancient times. And then, you know,

104
00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:44.010
as we've seen over time, that idea has kind

105
00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:46.980
of gone out of style. And I would argue

106
00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:49.859
now that it has come back. But for example,

107
00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:54.470
in the 16th and 17th century, um you know,

108
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.070
the whole idea from a religious point of view

109
00:05:57.079 --> 00:06:01.399
was that everything is, is preordained, that, that God

110
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.029
is, is ruler of all determines everything. There's no

111
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.140
such thing as chance and luck. And in fact,

112
00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:09.910
Einstein had a famous quote where he said God

113
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.100
does not play with dice. Um And, and that

114
00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:16.079
comes also from, uh there was also a rise

115
00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:19.059
of Newtonian physics in the, in the 16th 17th

116
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.859
century in which the idea was that well, if

117
00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:25.600
we have enough information, we can understand everything that's

118
00:06:25.609 --> 00:06:28.200
going on that there are certain rules and certain

119
00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:31.000
laws to nature and that all we need is

120
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.690
enough information. Now that goes counter again to the

121
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.980
idea of chance and luck. So, um so then

122
00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:39.799
I talk about how it, it kind of came

123
00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:41.700
back onto the scene. And, and I think one

124
00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:45.440
of the real important um reasons for that was

125
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.950
Darwin's theory of natural selection and evolution. And that

126
00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:52.980
theory is really based on the idea of random

127
00:06:52.989 --> 00:06:56.839
mutation that there are random mutant and mutations are

128
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.540
random. They can be good, they can be bad

129
00:06:59.549 --> 00:07:01.609
to, to make a long story short. His idea

130
00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:05.429
was that when there are random mutations that benefit

131
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.519
the survival of a species, those get carried on

132
00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:11.130
and that leads to to evolution. So the idea

133
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.410
of chance and luck came into much more into

134
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.959
the four than, and, and I would argue in

135
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.119
the 20th century, you know, with um chaos theory

136
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.470
and uh uh oo other aspects in, in the

137
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.829
science and in other places, you know, it, it's

138
00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:28.549
very much a player today

139
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.190
uh quantum mechanics as well. Right. Absolutely.

140
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.130
Absolutely. I was gonna, yeah, it took the words

141
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.829
out of my mouth, quantum mechanics.

142
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.359
Uh And I mean, the example of Darwin and

143
00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:45.690
the theory of evolution by natural selection is very

144
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.149
interesting because actually there are chance events that completely

145
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.899
changed how evolution played out. Like for example, in

146
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.279
the book, you talk about the example of the

147
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.709
asteroid hitting the earth and wiping out over time,

148
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.484
all the dinosaurs, we chill out for the rise

149
00:08:04.494 --> 00:08:07.464
of mammals. And if it wasn't for that, probably

150
00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:10.644
things now where they would look much different.

151
00:08:10.934 --> 00:08:13.545
Absolutely, Ricardo, you and I wouldn't be here right

152
00:08:13.554 --> 00:08:16.834
now if that asteroid had not hit 66 million

153
00:08:16.845 --> 00:08:19.204
years ago. And, you know, some people say, well,

154
00:08:19.214 --> 00:08:22.945
that was, that was predestined. Um No, I don't

155
00:08:22.954 --> 00:08:25.904
think so. As the asteroid was going around, it

156
00:08:25.915 --> 00:08:29.839
was pulled by some random gravitational forces and the

157
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:34.739
bottom line is had that asteroid struck 30 seconds

158
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.700
earlier or 30 seconds later. It probably wouldn't have

159
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.659
had the catastrophic effect that it had. And that

160
00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:46.200
catastrophic effect wiped out 75% of the animal and

161
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.950
plant species on the earth, including the dinosaurs, which

162
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.460
then led to the rise of the mammals. But

163
00:08:52.469 --> 00:08:55.070
again, imagine just a minute, one way or a

164
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.340
minute another way wouldn't be here right now. So,

165
00:08:58.349 --> 00:09:00.909
you know, that's a, that's a very, that's one

166
00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:03.179
of the most profound chance events that you can

167
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.340
point to um very powerful.

168
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.309
What about the social sciences? Because you've mentioned there

169
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:16.450
the example of uh mathematics, biology, even physics. But

170
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:21.330
in the social sciences specifically have chance and randomness

171
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.400
been studied seriously.

172
00:09:23.719 --> 00:09:26.960
It, it, it really hasn't and it's very surprising.

173
00:09:26.969 --> 00:09:29.989
Um YOU know, Newton. Newton had a famous quote

174
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.179
where he says, I can predict the, the, the,

175
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.739
the motions of the planets, but I can't predict

176
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:39.000
the, the, the, the um the madness of crowds.

177
00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.260
Um And social science is about kind of understanding

178
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:47.650
society, understanding social groups. And it's really interesting that

179
00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:51.260
there's very little written about in the social sciences

180
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.510
on luck and chance. And so I talk about

181
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.909
why that is, and I think there's a couple

182
00:09:55.919 --> 00:10:00.489
of, of explanations. Um One is that in the

183
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.340
social sciences, you know, I come out of a

184
00:10:02.349 --> 00:10:05.400
sociology background, uh We like to be able to

185
00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:07.820
predict things, we like to be able to model

186
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.539
things and to say this thing, event A led

187
00:10:10.549 --> 00:10:15.090
to event b well, by definition, randomness cannot be

188
00:10:15.099 --> 00:10:18.770
predicted it's random. So it's very hard to put

189
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.059
into a model to pre you know, as a

190
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.969
variable. And so that goes counter to a lot

191
00:10:23.979 --> 00:10:27.559
of social science, another um aspect for why I

192
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.080
think it's not looked at, uh it's not often

193
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:35.359
looked at is within, for example, sociology, we're interested

194
00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:40.369
in kind of how structural forces um impact upon

195
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.640
life outcomes. So for example, class race, gender, those

196
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.409
are all important variables in terms of of life

197
00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:51.270
outcomes. But to introduce the idea of chance and

198
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.190
randomness again, goes counter to that idea of being

199
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.229
able to sort of predict outcomes in people's lives.

200
00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:01.510
So, you know, I i it's interesting that it

201
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.169
really hasn't been studied very much. On the other

202
00:11:04.179 --> 00:11:07.030
hand, if you look at, for example, oh, just

203
00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:11.210
literature Shakespeare, uh all kinds of writers have often

204
00:11:11.219 --> 00:11:14.049
talked about the importance of chance and luck. So

205
00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:16.150
it's not like it hasn't been written about, but

206
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.349
it really hasn't been written about very much in

207
00:11:18.359 --> 00:11:20.409
the social sciences, which is why one of the

208
00:11:20.419 --> 00:11:22.429
reasons why I thought, well, this would be an

209
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.840
important book to write because it, it, it's, it

210
00:11:24.849 --> 00:11:26.530
hasn't been talked about very much.

211
00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:31.969
And uh we've already mentioned here briefly the role

212
00:11:31.979 --> 00:11:35.330
that Chen and Luck play in. I mean, we're

213
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.940
going to get more into how they play out

214
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.599
in people's individual lives. But we've already mentioned how

215
00:11:41.609 --> 00:11:46.260
in ancient civilizations, people really acknowledge that role and

216
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:51.905
also in very big uh worldwide events, like for

217
00:11:51.914 --> 00:11:55.145
example, the asteroid. But when it comes to human

218
00:11:55.155 --> 00:11:59.104
history itself, it also plays a role there, right?

219
00:11:59.114 --> 00:12:01.065
Could you give us an example of that?

220
00:12:01.104 --> 00:12:03.844
Right. It absolutely plays a role. There are so

221
00:12:03.854 --> 00:12:08.895
many examples in history of history being changed by

222
00:12:08.905 --> 00:12:12.369
a random event now, here's the thing we often

223
00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.760
think about history. We only have one history to,

224
00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.590
to contemplate, we only have one timeline to come.

225
00:12:18.599 --> 00:12:21.919
So we think, oh, it had to play out

226
00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:25.750
that way. Well, no, as history is, is unfolding,

227
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.190
it could go many, many different directions. And so

228
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.539
I give a lo uh several different powerful examples

229
00:12:32.549 --> 00:12:34.450
and, and we can easily talk about some of

230
00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.820
those. But, you know, just, just to highlight, you

231
00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:40.380
know, the idea of Hitler coming to power in,

232
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.659
in, in the 19 thirties. Um There were several

233
00:12:43.669 --> 00:12:46.099
events in which that may very well not have

234
00:12:46.109 --> 00:12:49.799
happened. Uh I talk about the Cuban missile crisis

235
00:12:49.809 --> 00:12:53.169
and we almost had World War three, but for

236
00:12:53.179 --> 00:12:55.359
a Russian sailor getting his foot stuck on a

237
00:12:55.369 --> 00:12:59.179
submarine conning tower ladder, if that hadn't happened, we

238
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.059
might have very well had World War Three. Um

239
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.020
THE idea of social movements and how social movements

240
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:09.719
start oftentimes the idea and the impetus behind the

241
00:13:09.729 --> 00:13:11.890
movement has been building over a long period of

242
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.200
time, but it's certain chance events that spark that

243
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.280
movement. And so whether it's the Arab Spring or

244
00:13:18.289 --> 00:13:20.359
the Black Lives Matter Movement here in the United

245
00:13:20.369 --> 00:13:24.200
States, um It's often a chance event that, that

246
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.630
can spur that. So if you look at history

247
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.280
is a history is filled of, of all of

248
00:13:29.289 --> 00:13:32.330
these kinds of events and, and it's, you know,

249
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.520
it's very, it's very interesting and very provocative to

250
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.229
think about how our history could be much different.

251
00:13:40.239 --> 00:13:41.880
But for chance and luck.

252
00:13:43.229 --> 00:13:46.840
So just for people to get a better understanding

253
00:13:46.849 --> 00:13:49.979
of what you are mentioning there, could you tell

254
00:13:49.989 --> 00:13:54.640
us about, uh, how chance and luck played out

255
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:58.340
in, for example, the defeat of the Equal Rights

256
00:13:58.349 --> 00:14:01.719
Amendment in the early 19 seventies?

257
00:14:01.729 --> 00:14:03.830
Yeah, that's a great, that's a great example. And

258
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.520
it's somebody who, um, I interviewed here in Saint

259
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.739
Louis who is from Saint Louis, Missouri, uh Phyllis

260
00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.919
Laffy. So she was um a very conservative advocate

261
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.469
and um she was really considered the one who

262
00:14:18.479 --> 00:14:22.000
really stopped the Equal Rights Amendment from becoming law

263
00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.190
in the United States. So the Equal Rights Amendment

264
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.669
was um was written, I think in 1971. And

265
00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:30.590
basically, it says that uh that there should not

266
00:14:30.599 --> 00:14:33.099
be discrimination on the basis of, of sex or

267
00:14:33.109 --> 00:14:35.349
gender. Uh That was it, uh you know, it

268
00:14:35.359 --> 00:14:40.530
was pretty straightforward. And what happened was that um

269
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.119
uh got out of Congress and it was being

270
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.359
voted on by the States and it got to,

271
00:14:46.369 --> 00:14:50.440
it needed 38 states for passage and 35 states

272
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.390
passed it. But Phyllis Schlafly got really involved in

273
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.789
this and was really the key person to um

274
00:14:56.799 --> 00:14:58.960
to prevent it from passing. Now, I had an

275
00:14:58.969 --> 00:15:02.380
interview with her uh before she was 86 at

276
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.340
the time and we started talking about how did

277
00:15:05.349 --> 00:15:08.719
you get involved in the Equal Rights Amendment? And

278
00:15:08.729 --> 00:15:12.719
she said, you know, it was a complete chance

279
00:15:12.729 --> 00:15:16.460
event. I got a telephone call one day from

280
00:15:16.469 --> 00:15:19.890
a friend of mine at a Connecticut library and

281
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.260
the friend asked me, uh, would you like to

282
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.380
come out and give a lecture as part of

283
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.700
our series? And, um, and Phyllis said, well, sure.

284
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.340
II, I, I'd, I'll give a lecture on national

285
00:15:31.349 --> 00:15:33.570
security. That's what she was interested in. She was

286
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.179
interested in the arms race between the US and

287
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:40.309
the Soviets. And the friend said, no, no, we'd

288
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.590
like you to hear about, uh, we'd like you

289
00:15:42.599 --> 00:15:45.630
to, to talk about this thing that's going around

290
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.159
now called the Equal Rights Amendment. And Phyllis said,

291
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.770
well, I don't know anything about that. I, I

292
00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.849
don't, you know, and the friend said, well, let

293
00:15:53.859 --> 00:15:56.270
me send you some material and I think you

294
00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.859
would be interested in this. So the friend sent

295
00:15:58.869 --> 00:16:02.919
the material. Phyllis did give the lecture that did

296
00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:06.710
stimulate her in terms of getting involved in this,

297
00:16:06.719 --> 00:16:10.030
in the fight to prevent the amendment from passing.

298
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.469
And so I asked her, I said, if you

299
00:16:12.479 --> 00:16:16.010
hadn't gotten that random telephone call, would you have

300
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.710
gotten involved? And she said, no, I wouldn't have

301
00:16:19.719 --> 00:16:21.369
or if I had it would have been much

302
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.239
too late. So in this case, history, the idea

303
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:31.669
of a constitutional amendment being prevented was spurred by

304
00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:35.340
a random telephone call. Now, here's the other aspect

305
00:16:35.349 --> 00:16:37.640
of this story and this is where we can

306
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:41.219
get into how do we respond when a chance

307
00:16:41.229 --> 00:16:44.770
event happens? So when that happened, she could have

308
00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.909
said no, I'm not gonna give that lecture. I'm

309
00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:52.469
sorry. But she thought, well, let me consider this.

310
00:16:52.809 --> 00:16:55.349
So when, when we, as I talk about in

311
00:16:55.359 --> 00:17:00.309
the book, chance and luck interact with other forces

312
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.119
and that's the dynamics of life is how these

313
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.848
things come together. So it's not simply a fait

314
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:08.890
accompli, there are things that happen beyond our control,

315
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.010
but how do we respond to them? Are we

316
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.280
aware of them? You know, one of the things

317
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.729
I talk about in the book is the idea

318
00:17:14.739 --> 00:17:18.410
of serendipity in scientific discoveries. That's a good example

319
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:22.040
of chance events happening along with the awareness and

320
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:25.290
the skills of the scientist. So anyway, so the,

321
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.239
but the story of Phyllis Laffey is a, is

322
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.520
just a, you know, when you think about it,

323
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.239
a a telephone call out of the blue, changed

324
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.189
history and changed it in a pretty dramatic way.

325
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.329
So you mentioned scientific discoveries there. Could you tell

326
00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:44.829
us about an example of how luck and chance

327
00:17:44.839 --> 00:17:48.329
reps have played the role in some of those

328
00:17:48.339 --> 00:17:50.040
scientific discoveries?

329
00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:53.270
Yeah. So there's been many cases of scientific discoveries

330
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.160
that have been stimulated by a chance of that,

331
00:17:56.329 --> 00:17:59.680
probably the best known one is the discovery of

332
00:17:59.689 --> 00:18:03.810
penicillin um which really was discovered by a, a

333
00:18:03.819 --> 00:18:07.079
Petri dish being left out um over the weekend

334
00:18:07.569 --> 00:18:10.790
and the scientists realizing that there was something here

335
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.510
that he wasn't aware of. But when you look

336
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.699
at um, things like x-rays or microwaves or velcro

337
00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.239
many, many examples. Uh EVEN, even the discovery of

338
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.180
DNA had a, had a, had a serendipitous moment

339
00:18:24.189 --> 00:18:27.209
to it. Um But in all of these cases,

340
00:18:27.219 --> 00:18:31.930
what happened was something occurred that was outside of

341
00:18:31.939 --> 00:18:36.010
the box that the scientist w had not imagined.

342
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.739
And the issue is, did they consider that? First

343
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.959
of all, were they aware of it? Did they

344
00:18:42.969 --> 00:18:45.599
consider it or did they just discard it? And

345
00:18:45.609 --> 00:18:48.520
if they did consider it, what was their reaction

346
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:52.140
to that? And so again, that's the idea of

347
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.810
the interaction of chance and luck with the skills

348
00:18:55.819 --> 00:18:59.459
and talents of a scientist, Louis Pasteur had the

349
00:18:59.469 --> 00:19:04.060
famous quote of saying chance favors the prepared mind.

350
00:19:04.689 --> 00:19:07.310
And that's exactly what he was talking about, is

351
00:19:07.319 --> 00:19:11.869
that chance and luck happened? But are you prepared

352
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.650
to take advantage of those events when they occur?

353
00:19:15.439 --> 00:19:20.219
Mhm. Uh Tell us also about technological innovations. Of

354
00:19:20.229 --> 00:19:26.060
course, science and technology usually are intimately linked. But

355
00:19:26.069 --> 00:19:30.680
when it comes to technological innovations themselves, uh how

356
00:19:30.689 --> 00:19:35.650
does role, how does a chance and luck manifest

357
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:40.520
in terms of how technological innovations are invented, discovered

358
00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:41.849
and stuff like that? Yeah.

359
00:19:41.859 --> 00:19:44.079
Well, I think again, it would be the idea

360
00:19:44.089 --> 00:19:47.160
of, um there are certain uh forces that lead

361
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:51.189
to technological innovations and there's certain, you know, um

362
00:19:51.199 --> 00:19:53.589
you know, the, the, the training of the scientists

363
00:19:53.599 --> 00:19:56.359
and all of that. But again, there are certain

364
00:19:56.369 --> 00:19:58.420
things that can happen out of the blue in

365
00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:03.410
the scientific process that can lead to scientific and

366
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.420
technological innovation. So again, I mentioned the idea of

367
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:10.989
x rays, the idea of microwaves. Um MANY, there's

368
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.739
just many, many examples of that where, where that

369
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.849
has occurred. And again, it's this idea of the

370
00:20:15.859 --> 00:20:20.589
interaction between chance and luck and training skills and

371
00:20:20.599 --> 00:20:21.219
so forth.

372
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.380
Mhm So let's talk now a little bit about

373
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:30.790
some of the different ways that randomness chance like

374
00:20:30.859 --> 00:20:35.270
influence our lives and our lives play out. So

375
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.650
how much of a lottery is just our birth?

376
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.589
For example, I mean, the parents, we are born

377
00:20:43.599 --> 00:20:47.449
to our place of origin, the time period and

378
00:20:47.459 --> 00:20:50.420
the quart size we are born into, I mean,

379
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:53.530
how do those kinds of factors influence our lives?

380
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.949
It's unbelievable. And, and so I have a chapter,

381
00:20:56.959 --> 00:20:58.939
you know, that that is called the lottery of

382
00:20:58.949 --> 00:21:02.699
birth. But think about this Ricardo, the idea that

383
00:21:02.709 --> 00:21:06.739
you and I are even were even born. The

384
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:11.199
odds of that are unbelievable. First of all, your

385
00:21:11.209 --> 00:21:14.199
parents had to find each other and, and as

386
00:21:14.209 --> 00:21:15.920
we know, and I talked later in the book

387
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.910
about this is almost universal that when people get

388
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.939
together, it's almost always there's a chance element to

389
00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.540
that. You know, if I had been five minutes

390
00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.329
early, five minutes late, if I hadn't been to

391
00:21:27.339 --> 00:21:30.099
that party. What? Anyway, your parents had to find

392
00:21:30.109 --> 00:21:32.939
each other. Their parents had to find each other.

393
00:21:32.949 --> 00:21:35.060
Their parents had to find each other. I mean,

394
00:21:35.069 --> 00:21:38.290
think of the odds of that then the sperm

395
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.579
with your name on had to find the egg

396
00:21:40.589 --> 00:21:43.880
out of, out of millions of sperm. So just

397
00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.890
think the odds of us being born at all

398
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.359
are zillions to one. And one of the things

399
00:21:50.369 --> 00:21:52.640
that I say about that is, you know, if

400
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.969
you really think about it, you should be really

401
00:21:55.979 --> 00:21:59.760
grateful that you're even here and make the most

402
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.729
of the time that you have here. So that's

403
00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:04.689
one thing in terms of the lottery of birth.

404
00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:07.800
But then as you point out, you know, our,

405
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.729
our genetic background, our race, our gender, where what

406
00:22:11.739 --> 00:22:14.380
country we're born in, whether our parents were rich

407
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.599
or poor. All of this is the lottery of

408
00:22:16.609 --> 00:22:18.650
birth that you know, had, we had nothing to

409
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.689
do with this. You know, it, it was a

410
00:22:20.699 --> 00:22:23.780
lot of randomness and chance. So right from the

411
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.699
get go, there's this huge element of chance in

412
00:22:27.709 --> 00:22:28.400
our lives.

413
00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.930
So tell us more perhaps about how factors like

414
00:22:33.939 --> 00:22:39.030
gender, race and social class influence life outcomes.

415
00:22:39.199 --> 00:22:40.790
Yeah. So here's the way I like to think

416
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.390
about it. And I think it's a good way

417
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.300
of, of bringing these things together. As I said

418
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.420
before, I'm trained as a sociologist and sociologists are

419
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.540
often interested in, in, in, in uh factors such

420
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.920
as class, race and gender and the way I

421
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.579
like to think about it is that those are,

422
00:22:57.589 --> 00:23:00.540
we might think of those as currents that push

423
00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.439
our lives in certain directions. So we know if

424
00:23:03.449 --> 00:23:05.619
you're coming from a certain class, you know, whether

425
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.329
you're poor or whether you're rich that's going to

426
00:23:07.339 --> 00:23:10.270
have an effect on life outcomes similar in terms

427
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.290
of race and in terms of gender. But within

428
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.359
those currents are all the ripples of randomness and

429
00:23:17.369 --> 00:23:20.569
chance. So, you know, it, it, it, it, it's

430
00:23:20.579 --> 00:23:24.250
the idea of currents and ripples that have an

431
00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.650
effect on how our life plays out. So within,

432
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.290
you know, particular social class, there's all kinds of

433
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.660
chance events that happen. But an interesting thing is

434
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.650
that those chance events may be different than if

435
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.329
you're in a different current. So the kinds of

436
00:23:39.339 --> 00:23:41.390
events that happen to me, if I'm raised in

437
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.540
a, in a family that's poor versus a family

438
00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.010
that's rich, there's also there's going to be a

439
00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.829
lot of luck and chance. But those kind of

440
00:23:48.839 --> 00:23:50.959
luck and chance events may very well, in fact,

441
00:23:50.969 --> 00:23:53.829
they will differ. And so that's another way of

442
00:23:53.839 --> 00:23:56.770
thinking about how these things come together. You know,

443
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.699
the sort of currents that push our lives in

444
00:23:58.709 --> 00:24:01.339
certain directions and the kind of chance events that

445
00:24:01.349 --> 00:24:03.180
happen along the way. The other thing that I

446
00:24:03.189 --> 00:24:06.400
mentioned is that there are certain things that can

447
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.410
happen to us that push us, there are chance

448
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.199
events that push us into a different current, you

449
00:24:11.209 --> 00:24:13.719
know, some kind of dramatic event that might happen

450
00:24:13.729 --> 00:24:16.880
by chance that results in sort of us, you

451
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.369
know, being pushed into another current, uh, in terms

452
00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.949
of our life's direction. So, but I think it's

453
00:24:22.959 --> 00:24:24.719
a, it's a good way to think about how

454
00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:27.030
these things come together. It's not, life is not

455
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.699
all chance, randomness and luck, nor is life all

456
00:24:30.709 --> 00:24:34.380
just predetermined and structural. It's the combination of the

457
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.719
two.

458
00:24:35.119 --> 00:24:40.510
Mhm. Uh But uh factors or social categories like

459
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.189
gender, race, social class, particularly if you are part

460
00:24:44.199 --> 00:24:48.859
of a gender or a race that is more

461
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:57.239
disadvantaged or uh lower in socio-economic state definitely plays

462
00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.920
a big role in your life outcomes. I mean,

463
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:05.459
it increases your probability of having negative life outcomes.

464
00:25:05.479 --> 00:25:07.910
It does indeed. And so I talk about this

465
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.969
idea of cumulative advantage or cumulative disadvantage. So if

466
00:25:11.979 --> 00:25:15.800
you're starting life with certain advantages, like you're coming

467
00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.189
from a family with a lot of resources, economic

468
00:25:18.199 --> 00:25:22.449
resources, those advantages are probably going to lead to

469
00:25:22.459 --> 00:25:25.079
other advantages. And so in this way, there's a

470
00:25:25.089 --> 00:25:28.229
cumulative process and we might think about it. If

471
00:25:28.239 --> 00:25:29.560
we want to put it in the context of

472
00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:31.969
luck, we might think about it as good luck

473
00:25:31.979 --> 00:25:34.959
leading to more good luck. On the other hand,

474
00:25:34.969 --> 00:25:38.000
if you're born into a family in poverty, there's

475
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:41.489
going to be a cumulative process of disadvantage because

476
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.839
you're gonna start with fewer resources. The education you're

477
00:25:44.849 --> 00:25:46.949
gonna get is probably not nearly as good as

478
00:25:46.959 --> 00:25:49.339
somebody with a lot of resources that's going to

479
00:25:49.349 --> 00:25:52.790
lead to other disadvantages. And so there's very much

480
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.479
this cumulative process that happens. And, and a lot

481
00:25:55.489 --> 00:25:59.319
of my earlier work on poverty and inequality talks

482
00:25:59.329 --> 00:26:01.540
about how this plays out. And I think that

483
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:04.550
it's, it's a really important process that we often

484
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.150
don't give enough attention to.

485
00:26:07.189 --> 00:26:10.130
Yeah, since you mentioned that, tell us now about

486
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:14.050
some of your work on poverty and how it

487
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.479
links to those kinds of topics to exploring these

488
00:26:17.489 --> 00:26:21.540
books. So for example, how does how can chance

489
00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:24.640
be disastrous for poor people?

490
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.819
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that was, that's one

491
00:26:27.829 --> 00:26:30.430
of the reasons how I got into this particular

492
00:26:30.439 --> 00:26:33.650
topic. So a lot of my earlier work is

493
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.300
looking at what is the likelihood of poverty, not

494
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.959
in a given year, but over the course of

495
00:26:39.969 --> 00:26:43.010
a lifetime, over the course of 2030 40 years.

496
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.089
And what I've shown using, you know, pretty large

497
00:26:45.099 --> 00:26:48.670
data here is that the risk of experiencing a

498
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.869
year of poverty in the United States is actually

499
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.250
pretty substantial. So depending on how you measure poverty

500
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.119
between, I would say two thirds and three quarters

501
00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.790
of all Americans at some point in their adulthood

502
00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.380
will experience a year of poverty. Now, why is

503
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.449
that? Well, part of it has to do with

504
00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:10.319
bad luck striking people when you think over a

505
00:27:10.329 --> 00:27:14.250
long period of time, things can happen that you

506
00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:18.790
didn't anticipate like losing a job, you know, a

507
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.609
AAA factory shutting down uh getting sick, a pandemic

508
00:27:23.619 --> 00:27:27.089
happening. All of these things can come out of

509
00:27:27.099 --> 00:27:29.489
the blue and can throw you into it can

510
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.390
throw you downward in terms of economics. And when

511
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.089
that happens, particularly in the United States, we don't

512
00:27:36.099 --> 00:27:38.890
have a very strong social safety net. And so

513
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.359
the result is that people often do fall into

514
00:27:41.369 --> 00:27:43.699
poverty. And that's why this is one of the

515
00:27:43.709 --> 00:27:45.060
things that I'm sure we'll talk about in a

516
00:27:45.069 --> 00:27:47.630
little bit. One of the lessons of all this

517
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.140
is to say, you know, if you do understand

518
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.410
that bad luck can strike, then what you want

519
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.250
to do in terms of your social policy is

520
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.229
base it on the idea of social insurance. This

521
00:27:58.239 --> 00:28:00.750
is the idea behind social insurance. You know, we

522
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.660
buy home insurance or auto insurance, not because tomorrow

523
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.630
I think I'm gonna have an accident, but I

524
00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.420
realize that down the road something bad may I

525
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.969
may have some bad luck and as a result,

526
00:28:11.979 --> 00:28:14.425
I wanna have some protection in place to protect

527
00:28:14.435 --> 00:28:17.045
me from that bad luck. Um That's the whole

528
00:28:17.055 --> 00:28:19.564
idea here. But, but yes, you know, my work

529
00:28:19.574 --> 00:28:23.285
on poverty showed that uh much of poverty is

530
00:28:23.295 --> 00:28:26.125
the result of kind of these structural kind of

531
00:28:26.135 --> 00:28:29.025
bad luck kind of things that happen to people.

532
00:28:29.305 --> 00:28:33.525
And um and, and that's a really important reason

533
00:28:33.535 --> 00:28:35.265
for why you find over a course of a

534
00:28:35.275 --> 00:28:37.604
lifetime, the risk of poverty is so high.

535
00:28:39.035 --> 00:28:42.640
And I guess that it would also be true

536
00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:47.099
that for people who have a good economic safety

537
00:28:47.109 --> 00:28:49.880
net, I mean, if they have an accident, if

538
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:53.979
something bad happens, it is much easier for them

539
00:28:53.989 --> 00:28:58.209
to eventually recover than for people who have very

540
00:28:58.219 --> 00:29:02.425
little or already, or because, I mean, they actually,

541
00:29:02.435 --> 00:29:07.635
in certain circumstances need help from other people. Otherwise

542
00:29:07.645 --> 00:29:11.954
it's virtually impossible for them to recover.

543
00:29:12.265 --> 00:29:15.035
That's exactly right. And that, that's a really interesting

544
00:29:15.045 --> 00:29:19.354
example of a similar chance of that can play

545
00:29:19.364 --> 00:29:22.064
out quite differently depending on where you are in

546
00:29:22.074 --> 00:29:25.685
the social class structure. Another example that I give

547
00:29:25.905 --> 00:29:30.400
is um being struck by cancer. So this is

548
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.959
an cancer is, is an example where actually randomness

549
00:29:33.969 --> 00:29:36.760
is really important. So depending on the type of

550
00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:39.250
cancer that you develop, we know that there's a

551
00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.079
genetic component to, to um developing cancer, there's an

552
00:29:43.089 --> 00:29:45.920
environmental component, but there's very much of a random

553
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:49.920
component. Cancer is the result of random mutations in

554
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.479
the DNA in the cellular structure. So it can

555
00:29:53.489 --> 00:29:56.199
many times there was nothing you could do about

556
00:29:56.209 --> 00:29:58.760
it at all. I I it's just bad luck.

557
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:03.670
Now, when cancer strikes the way it plays out

558
00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.400
may be much different for somebody that has a

559
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.660
lot of resources versus somebody that has few resources.

560
00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.329
So we here in the United states, we don't

561
00:30:10.339 --> 00:30:13.150
have universal health care. So if you're at the

562
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.770
bottom of the social ladder, you may not have

563
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.489
insurance at all. And if you get that diagnosis,

564
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.430
it could be a death sentence. On the other

565
00:30:20.439 --> 00:30:23.250
hand, if you have good insurance, you caught it

566
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.270
early, you might very well be able to continue

567
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.300
and have a good life. But there's, there's similar

568
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:32.560
kind of chance bad luck of a cancer diagnosis

569
00:30:32.569 --> 00:30:34.920
can play out much differently depending on where you

570
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.209
are in the social structure.

571
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:40.329
Mhm. Yeah. And that really contrasts with what we

572
00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:43.665
have in many places in Europe, even here where

573
00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:46.484
I live in Portugal because we have universal health

574
00:30:46.494 --> 00:30:49.255
care and of course, it's not a perfect system,

575
00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:54.474
but at least uh there's a very small probability

576
00:30:54.484 --> 00:30:58.395
of people uh not getting access to the treatments

577
00:30:58.405 --> 00:31:02.275
they need or falling into huge debt. So that's

578
00:31:02.285 --> 00:31:04.045
right. And you know, and you think about this,

579
00:31:04.055 --> 00:31:07.214
you know, Portugal, almost all other countries have some

580
00:31:07.224 --> 00:31:10.714
kind of universal health care coverage. United States is

581
00:31:10.724 --> 00:31:13.250
very much an outlier. But the question is, you

582
00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.729
know, well, why, why do we have health insurance

583
00:31:15.739 --> 00:31:21.430
again? The idea is to prevent and to protect

584
00:31:21.469 --> 00:31:24.660
against bad outcomes in terms of your health. Like,

585
00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.750
you know, part of it is prevention, you wanna,

586
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.130
you know, do the right things and have the

587
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.050
support for that. But when something does happen, you

588
00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.640
wanna have a safety net in place. So again,

589
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:37.569
in thinking about social policy, the idea of chance

590
00:31:37.579 --> 00:31:39.569
and luck is really, really important.

591
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.329
And on the topic of uh economics, uh you've

592
00:31:45.339 --> 00:31:49.510
also done some work on economic inequality. So this

593
00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.239
chance also play a role there in amplifying economic

594
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:58.099
inequality. And if so what might be some of

595
00:31:58.109 --> 00:32:03.359
the worst? I don't know, social economic political consequences

596
00:32:03.369 --> 00:32:07.520
of having huge levels of economic inequality?

597
00:32:07.839 --> 00:32:10.359
Yeah. So I'm, I'm actually, I've done a fair

598
00:32:10.369 --> 00:32:12.709
amount of work on that subject and I'm working

599
00:32:12.719 --> 00:32:14.089
on a book right now with a friend of

600
00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:17.400
mine in economics on American inequality and thinking about

601
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:20.150
that um to make a long story short inequality

602
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.020
in the United States and, and it is true

603
00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.719
in some other countries as well. But in the

604
00:32:23.729 --> 00:32:26.359
United States in particular, has gotten quite wide over

605
00:32:26.369 --> 00:32:28.209
the last 50 years. So if you look at

606
00:32:28.449 --> 00:32:31.800
income inequality or wealth inequality, the gap between the

607
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:35.550
top and the bottom has gotten wider. Um So,

608
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.579
uh but, but one of the things I talk

609
00:32:37.589 --> 00:32:39.910
about in the book is that chance and luck

610
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.469
can accentuate these inequalities. And this goes back to

611
00:32:43.479 --> 00:32:46.189
that idea, we were talking about with cumulative advantage

612
00:32:46.199 --> 00:32:49.550
or cumulative disadvantage that if you're starting out with

613
00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:54.959
certain advantages, those will tend to accumulate over time.

614
00:32:54.969 --> 00:32:57.699
Whereas if you're starting out with disadvantages, those will

615
00:32:57.709 --> 00:32:59.930
also accumulate. So where people are starting, if you

616
00:32:59.939 --> 00:33:03.589
have wide differences in where people are starting and

617
00:33:03.599 --> 00:33:06.079
then you let that play out the inequalities are

618
00:33:06.089 --> 00:33:09.229
going to get even wider. There's a good example

619
00:33:09.239 --> 00:33:11.310
of how this plays out in the United States,

620
00:33:11.319 --> 00:33:14.359
which again, we're very much of an outlier the

621
00:33:14.369 --> 00:33:17.890
way that we fund uh K through 12 education.

622
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.250
So from kindergarten to uh to through high school

623
00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.969
in the United States, the funding for, for education

624
00:33:26.209 --> 00:33:31.349
is to a large extent from the local community

625
00:33:31.359 --> 00:33:35.170
and a local district, the local tax district, it's

626
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.489
not funded on a federal level. The result of

627
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.180
that is that if you live in a wealthy

628
00:33:40.189 --> 00:33:42.890
community, your your school district will have a lot

629
00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.119
of resources. But if by chance and luck, you're

630
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.680
born into a poor community, your school district is

631
00:33:49.689 --> 00:33:51.599
not gonna have a lot of resources. And so

632
00:33:51.609 --> 00:33:54.770
the quality of education varies quite dramatically in the

633
00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.869
United States, depending on the community you live in.

634
00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.599
That's not the case in a lot of other

635
00:33:59.609 --> 00:34:02.439
countries where you have, it's more centrally organized in

636
00:34:02.449 --> 00:34:05.810
terms of the funding. So that's another example of

637
00:34:05.819 --> 00:34:10.790
how uh chance and luck can accentuate the inequalities

638
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.228
in society. And it's particularly the case here in

639
00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:14.129
the United States.

640
00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:17.290
Uh Yeah. And the second part of my question

641
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:21.090
was what would be some of the worst possible

642
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:26.418
social, economic political consequences of big levels of economic

643
00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:29.489
inequality? I I'm asking you this because sometimes we

644
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:34.764
hear from people that economic inequality itself is not

645
00:34:34.975 --> 00:34:38.764
really a problem. It depends on the perception people

646
00:34:38.774 --> 00:34:44.145
have of it being fair or unfair and things

647
00:34:44.155 --> 00:34:44.833
like that. So

648
00:34:44.844 --> 00:34:47.445
yeah. Yeah. Yeah, really good question. And a lot

649
00:34:47.455 --> 00:34:50.760
of times people will say, well, economic in inequality

650
00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.739
isn't necessarily a problem if you have a lot

651
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:55.659
of mobility in the income distribution, if people are

652
00:34:55.668 --> 00:34:57.689
able to go from the bottom to the top.

653
00:34:57.699 --> 00:35:00.010
The problem with that is that also over the

654
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.969
last 50 years, there's been less and less economic

655
00:35:02.979 --> 00:35:06.209
mobility in the United States. It's harder to go

656
00:35:06.219 --> 00:35:08.209
from, it's very hard to go from rags to

657
00:35:08.219 --> 00:35:11.030
riches in the United States. We have less mobility

658
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.370
than a number of other European countries. Um But

659
00:35:14.379 --> 00:35:17.229
here's, here's the, here's the deal with in terms

660
00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:20.659
of the cost of this inequality. So in the

661
00:35:20.669 --> 00:35:23.800
United States, childhood poverty is really, really high. We

662
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:26.360
have some of the highest rates of childhood poverty

663
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:30.120
of any western industrialized country. Now, the question is

664
00:35:30.879 --> 00:35:33.899
what that I asked a few years ago in

665
00:35:33.909 --> 00:35:37.120
a, in a study, what actually is the economic

666
00:35:37.129 --> 00:35:39.899
cost of that childhood poverty to society as a

667
00:35:39.909 --> 00:35:42.840
whole? So we did an analysis and we were

668
00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:46.219
quite conservative. We looked at the effect that childhood

669
00:35:46.229 --> 00:35:50.139
poverty has on greater health care costs on less

670
00:35:50.149 --> 00:35:53.879
economic productivity. Because when Children become adults and if

671
00:35:53.889 --> 00:35:56.250
they're raised in poverty, they're gonna be less economically

672
00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:01.600
productive and increased criminal justice costs. So we estimated

673
00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.270
that in the United States on an annual basis,

674
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.649
childhood poverty was costing again from a conservative perspective,

675
00:36:09.669 --> 00:36:13.479
slightly over $1 trillion a year. That was to

676
00:36:13.489 --> 00:36:16.489
put it in perspective about 28% of the entire

677
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:21.590
federal budget. So the question here is not, are

678
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:26.290
we paying or not paying? The question is how

679
00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.479
are we going to pay for this? And what

680
00:36:28.489 --> 00:36:30.500
we are winding up doing in the United States

681
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.500
is we pay for the problem of poverty on

682
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.870
the back end, we pay for it because we

683
00:36:34.879 --> 00:36:37.260
have higher health care costs and all these other

684
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:41.699
things rather than preventing poverty on the front end.

685
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.205
And it's always more effective to deal with a

686
00:36:45.215 --> 00:36:47.794
social problem on the front end than the back

687
00:36:47.804 --> 00:36:50.195
end. You know, the idea of a, of a

688
00:36:50.205 --> 00:36:53.074
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure

689
00:36:53.084 --> 00:36:55.215
is sort of the saying that applies to this.

690
00:36:55.334 --> 00:36:56.925
The other thing that we did in this study

691
00:36:56.935 --> 00:37:01.260
is we estimated for every, um for every dollar

692
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:04.520
that you spent on reducing childhood poverty, you say

693
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.889
between seven and $12 down the road in those

694
00:37:07.899 --> 00:37:11.429
other costs. So it's a, so my point being

695
00:37:11.459 --> 00:37:14.659
reducing poverty is not only the morally right thing

696
00:37:14.669 --> 00:37:17.189
to do, but it's economically the smart thing to

697
00:37:17.199 --> 00:37:18.070
do as well.

698
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.149
And even particularly when it, when it comes to

699
00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:24.969
Children, I guess that we could also say that

700
00:37:24.979 --> 00:37:27.610
investing in them, of course, it's a long term

701
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:31.209
investment but it eventually pays out because if they

702
00:37:31.219 --> 00:37:34.935
stay in poverty, they will be also. So even

703
00:37:34.945 --> 00:37:39.215
from just a purely economic standpoint, less productive,

704
00:37:39.324 --> 00:37:41.604
that's, that's exactly right. You know, one of the

705
00:37:41.614 --> 00:37:44.034
best investments you can do in terms of social

706
00:37:44.044 --> 00:37:47.475
policy is to invest in the potential of Children

707
00:37:47.594 --> 00:37:51.324
to invest in their human um resources and human

708
00:37:51.334 --> 00:37:54.715
capacity. That's like the best, this, the, the, the

709
00:37:54.725 --> 00:37:57.780
dumbest thing to do is to have Children in

710
00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:00.560
poverty, Children that are hungry because just as you

711
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:03.090
said, they're going to become adults and they're not

712
00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.419
going to be as productive as they could be.

713
00:38:05.429 --> 00:38:07.370
And these are the Children that are going to

714
00:38:07.379 --> 00:38:09.949
be paying for our social programs down the road.

715
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.600
So again, it's very smart to invest in, in,

716
00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:16.489
in, in folks, you know, sort of human potential.

717
00:38:16.689 --> 00:38:18.020
And that's, you know, one of the things I

718
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.389
talk about not so much in this book, but

719
00:38:20.399 --> 00:38:23.929
in other places is what the goal of social

720
00:38:23.939 --> 00:38:26.159
p I believe what the goal of social policy

721
00:38:26.169 --> 00:38:30.189
should be is to allow everyone to reach their

722
00:38:30.199 --> 00:38:33.699
potential, whatever that may be, you know, people's potential

723
00:38:33.709 --> 00:38:35.530
varies. You know, we might be strong in some

724
00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.520
things and weak in others. But whatever that potential

725
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:41.709
is, we should have policies in place that allow

726
00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:43.810
people to get to that level. And what we

727
00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:46.840
do here in the United States is we often

728
00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:49.449
don't allow people to get to their potential. And

729
00:38:49.459 --> 00:38:53.709
that's, that's wrong morally and it's wrong economically.

730
00:38:54.689 --> 00:38:58.830
So changing topics. Now, I've asked you about the

731
00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:03.270
lottery of our birth earlier. What about even throughout

732
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.530
our lives, the careers we choose who and if

733
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:12.070
we marry where we live is that also influenced

734
00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.580
by chance and luck.

735
00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:16.590
Oh, absolutely. I mean, it's like that is so

736
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.429
influenced by Chen. So the specifics, for example, who

737
00:39:20.439 --> 00:39:23.600
you marry or who your significant other is the

738
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:26.780
specific person that you wind up with is very

739
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:29.340
much by chance. I mean, this is almost a

740
00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:31.520
universal kind of thing. I've talked to a lot

741
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:35.780
of people, almost everybody will say, you know, if

742
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:38.419
I had been a couple minutes early, a couple

743
00:39:38.429 --> 00:39:39.939
of minutes late, I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have

744
00:39:39.949 --> 00:39:42.739
run into my significant other. Now, they would have

745
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:46.649
gone, run into somebody else. That's true. You, you

746
00:39:46.659 --> 00:39:49.399
would, you would find other people but you wouldn't

747
00:39:49.409 --> 00:39:53.889
have found that person. Um, SO who we actually

748
00:39:53.899 --> 00:39:56.500
wind up with in terms of our, our close,

749
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:59.330
you know, friends and our associates is very much

750
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.429
the luck of the draw, the specific job that

751
00:40:02.439 --> 00:40:05.659
we find ourselves in. Now, we might have had,

752
00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:07.739
you know, we, we, we, we, we, we had

753
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:10.320
sort of intentions to go into a certain profession

754
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:13.500
or a certain field. But the specific job you

755
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:16.679
find yourself in is very much influenced by luck

756
00:40:16.689 --> 00:40:19.139
and chance. You know, certain jobs may be open,

757
00:40:19.149 --> 00:40:21.330
other jobs weren't open by the, when you were

758
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.219
looking for jobs, all of that same thing is

759
00:40:24.229 --> 00:40:26.699
true where you live, you know, in the United

760
00:40:26.709 --> 00:40:28.340
States here, we have a lot of people that,

761
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:31.020
that buy a home, but only so many homes

762
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:33.540
are available on a, on the, on the housing

763
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:35.969
market at a particular point in time. So, you

764
00:40:35.979 --> 00:40:38.260
know, where you live is very much influenced by

765
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:41.679
chance and luck. So these specifics in our lives,

766
00:40:41.689 --> 00:40:44.949
if people think about that, there's a huge amount

767
00:40:44.959 --> 00:40:47.020
of luck and chance in those specifics.

768
00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:49.830
And what we have to keep in mind here

769
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.830
is if any of these things or all of

770
00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:59.080
them changed, our lives would have been completely different.

771
00:40:59.649 --> 00:41:02.570
Right. Absolutely. So, I'll, I'll give you one example

772
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:06.739
of, uh, relate to myself. And, um, I'm here

773
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.409
at, at Washington University, which is a university here

774
00:41:09.419 --> 00:41:13.270
in Saint Louis. And, uh, I came here, first

775
00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.340
of all, the reason I got the job here

776
00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:18.120
was very chance. I was on the job market.

777
00:41:18.129 --> 00:41:22.139
Um, IN the academic world, it's very competitive. Uh,

778
00:41:22.149 --> 00:41:24.860
THERE are only a few jobs available. You got

779
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:26.699
to kind of go where, where they are. So

780
00:41:26.709 --> 00:41:29.629
anyway, I got the job here. But, um, a

781
00:41:29.639 --> 00:41:31.969
friend of mine after about three or four years,

782
00:41:31.979 --> 00:41:34.709
a friend of mine, I, I randomly ran into

783
00:41:34.719 --> 00:41:37.419
them in the hallway and they said to me

784
00:41:37.429 --> 00:41:40.000
and, and I, I was in the sociology department

785
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:42.280
and she was in the social work department, social

786
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:46.330
work school. And she said to me, um, you

787
00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.760
don't, actually, we have a job open in social

788
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.419
work that you might be interested in. Now, I

789
00:41:51.429 --> 00:41:54.929
had this was no idea at all. No idea.

790
00:41:54.939 --> 00:41:57.139
And I happened to just run into her and

791
00:41:57.149 --> 00:42:00.129
I thought, well, and she said, maybe you should

792
00:42:00.139 --> 00:42:02.179
apply to it. It's in your area. It's poverty

793
00:42:02.189 --> 00:42:04.919
and inequality. And I thought, well, ok, I'll, I'll

794
00:42:04.929 --> 00:42:07.229
apply to it to make a long story short.

795
00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:11.850
I got the job and two weeks later the

796
00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:15.850
university announced they were closing the sociology department here.

797
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.800
So if I had not had that meeting with

798
00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:21.679
that person, I would not have been, remained in

799
00:42:21.689 --> 00:42:24.280
Saint Louis. I would have been somewhere else and

800
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:27.239
it was complete chance. I never would have known

801
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:30.669
about that job if she hadn't told me about

802
00:42:30.679 --> 00:42:32.830
it. And that's very true in the job. A

803
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.840
lot of it is word of mouth, you know,

804
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.750
that you hear about this or you don't hear

805
00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.850
about that very much chance. So that's just one

806
00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.560
little example in my life. As you said, my

807
00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:45.250
life would have been much different. I might not

808
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.379
be sitting here. Right. I probably wouldn't be sitting

809
00:42:47.389 --> 00:42:49.709
here right now with you talking about this book

810
00:42:49.719 --> 00:42:52.270
because I would have gone somewhere else. My research

811
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.810
might have gone a different direction. Uh, YOU know,

812
00:42:55.979 --> 00:42:58.889
I mean, it's, it's amazing when you think about

813
00:42:58.909 --> 00:42:58.929
it.

814
00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:03.350
Right. And it's not just about the careers or

815
00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:08.270
jobs we choose. But it's also about how successful

816
00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.739
we become. Chance also plays a role in that.

817
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:13.860
Like, for example, at a certain point in your

818
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:17.780
book, you talk about how uh some actors and

819
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:21.469
musicians, for example, are able to achieve so much

820
00:43:21.479 --> 00:43:24.899
fortune and fame and others. Not so much.

821
00:43:25.159 --> 00:43:28.260
Absolutely. That the entertainment field is one where you

822
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:32.060
really see the influence of uh of good luck.

823
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:35.260
And so actors and musicians will often tell you,

824
00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:38.790
you know, if I hadn't gotten that lucky break

825
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.320
early in my career, I wouldn't be where I

826
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:43.669
am today. And I give this story in an

827
00:43:43.679 --> 00:43:46.469
earlier life. I was very much involved in music

828
00:43:46.479 --> 00:43:48.520
and, and singer songwriter kinds of things. And I

829
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:52.750
met a lot of really talented musicians and only

830
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.810
a couple of them really made it kind of

831
00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.199
commercially. But I can tell you that many of

832
00:43:58.209 --> 00:44:01.610
the people were just as talented. But the difference

833
00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:04.290
between those who really made it was not the

834
00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.550
talent, but it was getting the lucky break. There

835
00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.000
had to be a baseline level of skills and

836
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:13.290
talent and creativity, of course, but there's lots of

837
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.250
people who are talented and creative that never make

838
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.969
it because they never got the lucky break. Another

839
00:44:18.979 --> 00:44:21.889
example of this is in the literary world. If

840
00:44:21.899 --> 00:44:25.929
you look at um, authors, you know, Hemingway or

841
00:44:25.939 --> 00:44:30.449
uh JK Rowling or, um, you know, uh the

842
00:44:30.459 --> 00:44:34.030
Writer of Gone With The Wind, they were rejected

843
00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.780
over and over and over again. Now we know

844
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:39.379
the quality of their work was really good. But

845
00:44:39.389 --> 00:44:42.550
because of randomness because a publisher wasn't interested at

846
00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.500
the time or whatever they were rejected. But, and

847
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:48.080
here's one of the morals of the story, they

848
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:53.280
persevered and by persevering, they used chance over the

849
00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.350
long run to their favor. Because if you have

850
00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.219
more irons in the fire, you're more likely to

851
00:44:58.229 --> 00:45:01.419
see the skill or the talent um come into

852
00:45:01.429 --> 00:45:05.340
play. But the downside of that is how many

853
00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:09.379
authors Ricardo have got, have had a lot of

854
00:45:09.389 --> 00:45:12.540
talent and skills, but they gave up because theyre

855
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:15.449
rejected one too many times and we've never heard

856
00:45:15.459 --> 00:45:18.540
of them. Yeah. You know, and, and it's the

857
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:22.639
same true in music and acting. So that's those

858
00:45:22.649 --> 00:45:26.209
are professions where you really see the impact of

859
00:45:26.219 --> 00:45:29.010
a, a lucky break being really, really important. And

860
00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.560
again, any, almost any actor will tell you the

861
00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:33.330
same story. Mhm.

862
00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.060
A and in this particular case of highly competitive

863
00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:41.699
areas or domains, uh it is really, it makes

864
00:45:41.709 --> 00:45:44.429
it really obvious that many times. It's not uh

865
00:45:44.439 --> 00:45:48.719
really a matter of the most successful people being

866
00:45:48.729 --> 00:45:51.739
the better at what they do, which is that

867
00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.679
they were the ones that got the chances, the

868
00:45:54.689 --> 00:46:00.100
opportunities or uh good. I mean, the chance events

869
00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:02.760
happened to them and not to the others.

870
00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:05.489
Yes. And, and this sort of goes against um

871
00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.010
this, what I say is this splashes some cold

872
00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:11.320
water on the idea of meritocracy. So the idea

873
00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:14.969
of meritocracy is that, oh if you're successful, you

874
00:46:14.979 --> 00:46:18.639
merit that success or if you're unsuccessful, you merit

875
00:46:18.649 --> 00:46:23.000
that unsuccessful um uh uh life. And what this

876
00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:26.489
does is, it says, well, skills and talent are,

877
00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:30.159
are certainly important, but they're not the only part

878
00:46:30.169 --> 00:46:32.629
of the story here. And, and another way I

879
00:46:32.639 --> 00:46:36.239
like to think about it is skills, talent determination.

880
00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:39.840
All of those are certainly important ingredients. They may

881
00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:42.959
be necessary ingredients for getting ahead, but they're not

882
00:46:42.969 --> 00:46:46.979
sufficient conditions. And there's been empirical work that shows

883
00:46:46.989 --> 00:46:50.020
that those who really make it on the top

884
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:53.179
or, you know, particularly on the top, certainly have

885
00:46:53.189 --> 00:46:55.469
a baseline level of skills and talent, but they

886
00:46:55.479 --> 00:47:00.120
always got some lucky breaks. That's what distinguishes those

887
00:47:00.129 --> 00:47:03.340
who are really successful from those who are not.

888
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:07.889
And so again, this really kind of is counter

889
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.610
to the idea that, oh, the world is simply

890
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:14.090
one that operates on, on the basis of meritocracy.

891
00:47:14.629 --> 00:47:17.439
And that's, that's I think an interesting lesson here

892
00:47:17.449 --> 00:47:22.419
because you know what Meritocracy says is that those

893
00:47:22.429 --> 00:47:25.760
who do well deserve it and those who don't

894
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:28.739
also deserve it. And this is saying, you know

895
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:31.979
what the idea of deserving or undeserved, we need

896
00:47:31.989 --> 00:47:33.439
to kind of rethink that a bit.

897
00:47:34.179 --> 00:47:37.830
Mhm. And why is it, why do you think

898
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.919
that individuals or many individuals, not all people, of

899
00:47:41.929 --> 00:47:45.010
course, are often on and aware of the role

900
00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.969
that luck and chance play in their lives. I

901
00:47:47.979 --> 00:47:51.360
mean, is there any specific psychological mechanism?

902
00:47:51.989 --> 00:47:54.280
Yes, I think there is. And I think one

903
00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:57.469
of the reasons why people really discount the idea

904
00:47:57.479 --> 00:48:00.870
of good luck in their lives is because they

905
00:48:00.879 --> 00:48:03.929
feel it takes away from their accomplishments, it takes

906
00:48:03.939 --> 00:48:06.189
away from their efforts and skills. And what I

907
00:48:06.199 --> 00:48:08.889
would argue is that it's just another component, you

908
00:48:08.899 --> 00:48:10.969
know, if you wanna be realistic about the world,

909
00:48:10.979 --> 00:48:13.459
let's, let's look at that. Um But here, here's

910
00:48:13.469 --> 00:48:16.080
a, here's a great kind of analogy. Um THAT

911
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:18.850
shows you uh I think what happens. So I,

912
00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.850
I'm a big bicyclist cyclist. I, I like to

913
00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:23.590
ride and this afternoon, in fact, I'll go for

914
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.479
a long ride and when you're riding your bike

915
00:48:26.969 --> 00:48:29.770
and the wind is at your back, you don't

916
00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:32.189
notice it at all and you're thinking I'm doing

917
00:48:32.199 --> 00:48:35.010
great. I'm writing, I'm so strong, I'm just going

918
00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:37.580
to, it's only when you turn back into the

919
00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:40.469
wind that you realize. Wow, I was getting a

920
00:48:40.479 --> 00:48:43.429
lot of help and that's what happens with people.

921
00:48:43.439 --> 00:48:46.590
They don't, they don't acknowledge the help that they've

922
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:50.090
gotten in terms of their success. Um Because again,

923
00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.870
they feel that either they're not just oblivious to

924
00:48:52.879 --> 00:48:55.250
it or they feel that it takes away from

925
00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.659
their success. And again, uh II, I would say,

926
00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:00.979
you know, that that's not the way that the

927
00:49:00.989 --> 00:49:04.060
world works that it's fine to say. Yeah, I

928
00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:05.820
put in a lot of work and effort, but

929
00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:08.010
I also got some lucky breaks along the way.

930
00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.459
I got some good breaks.

931
00:49:10.949 --> 00:49:15.909
And how does individual agency come into the picture

932
00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:20.729
then? Because after we looked across this entire world

933
00:49:20.739 --> 00:49:25.189
of randomness here, then what place uh is there

934
00:49:25.199 --> 00:49:29.985
any place for individuals agency? And if so how

935
00:49:29.995 --> 00:49:32.804
can we react to chances?

936
00:49:34.064 --> 00:49:37.334
Yeah. Really good question. So one of the things

937
00:49:37.344 --> 00:49:39.304
that I talk about, one of the lessons that

938
00:49:39.314 --> 00:49:42.145
we can learn from recognizing chance and luck in

939
00:49:42.155 --> 00:49:46.179
our lives is the idea of being open to

940
00:49:46.189 --> 00:49:49.620
opportunities that may come our way. Um And so

941
00:49:49.629 --> 00:49:51.179
this is, this kind of goes back to what

942
00:49:51.189 --> 00:49:54.179
we were talking about with serendipity and scientific discoveries.

943
00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:59.100
When chance and luck events strike, are we aware

944
00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:02.219
of them? Uh ARE, are we, are we uh

945
00:50:02.229 --> 00:50:04.760
do we take advantage of some things that may

946
00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:08.429
happen to us that we didn't anticipate at all?

947
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:11.540
I think that's a really important lesson um to

948
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:13.810
learn is to when you wake up in the

949
00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.699
morning, you sort of think, OK, my day is

950
00:50:15.709 --> 00:50:18.580
gonna go a certain way, but there's always the

951
00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:22.080
chance that something will happen that will be random

952
00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:24.100
or that were, was out of the blue. And

953
00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:25.860
what do you do with that? And that's where

954
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:29.500
agency comes into play. How do I I have

955
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:32.620
control over how I might respond to something like

956
00:50:32.629 --> 00:50:35.590
that? I can ignore it. I can think about

957
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.139
it. I could act on it. That's where kind

958
00:50:38.149 --> 00:50:41.840
of agency interacts with chance and luck. And one

959
00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.939
of the other analogies I use is II, I

960
00:50:43.949 --> 00:50:46.540
say that, you know, life is kind of like

961
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:49.260
um randomness is like a dance partner that we

962
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:51.570
have as we make our way across the dance

963
00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:55.100
floor of life. And it's the combination of two

964
00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:58.939
partners, one leads, the other 1 may lead, but

965
00:50:58.949 --> 00:51:02.489
the interaction of the two. So it's agency along

966
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:05.189
with chance and luck that give life its dynamic

967
00:51:05.199 --> 00:51:05.739
quality.

968
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.760
And so do you think that if people learn

969
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:13.629
about the role that randomness, chance and luck play

970
00:51:13.639 --> 00:51:16.139
in their lives, if they read your book and

971
00:51:16.149 --> 00:51:19.610
they learn about all of this, that it on

972
00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:23.989
an individual level, it might help them deal better

973
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.239
with uncertainty in their lives.

974
00:51:27.189 --> 00:51:30.459
Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, one of the things that

975
00:51:30.469 --> 00:51:35.110
I think uh an important lesson here is that

976
00:51:35.239 --> 00:51:39.129
we think um when we discount the idea of

977
00:51:39.139 --> 00:51:43.389
chance and luck, we often blame ourselves. So go,

978
00:51:43.399 --> 00:51:45.689
let's go back to the example of, of cancer

979
00:51:45.699 --> 00:51:49.050
of a cancer diagnosis, people often will say what

980
00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.290
could I have done differently? What, what, how could

981
00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.000
I have changed my diet or how could I

982
00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:56.300
have whatever my lifestyle and that may have been

983
00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:59.389
a factor. But there also may be cases where

984
00:51:59.399 --> 00:52:02.300
there was nothing you could do. There was nothing

985
00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:05.850
at all. And, and what that does is it

986
00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.489
really, it can relieve the burden of blame on

987
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.090
yourself and that can be a real gift. There

988
00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.610
was a book that was written a long time

989
00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.840
ago by a, a rabbi who said, who the

990
00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:20.050
title of the book was? Why do bad things

991
00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.649
happen to good people? Why does God allow that

992
00:52:23.659 --> 00:52:28.320
to happen? And his answer is, it's simply random.

993
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:31.649
You can turn to God for, for, for support

994
00:52:31.659 --> 00:52:35.239
and, and all of that, but don't necessarily blame

995
00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:38.629
God. It was random. And if you accept that

996
00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.830
it again, it can relieve a great burden upon

997
00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.060
you because we often want, wanna say, what could

998
00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:45.570
I have done wrong or what could I have

999
00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:47.770
done better? You know, what could I have changed?

1000
00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.669
That would have resulted in a different outcome. Sometimes

1001
00:52:50.679 --> 00:52:52.850
there's nothing you could have done. It was simply

1002
00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:57.000
bad luck. So that's one that's one kind of

1003
00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:59.159
uh lesson there that I think is, is a

1004
00:52:59.169 --> 00:53:01.659
really important one is that, you know, chance and

1005
00:53:01.669 --> 00:53:04.649
luck um relieve us from some of that burden

1006
00:53:04.659 --> 00:53:07.350
of, of always blaming ourselves for what we could

1007
00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:07.780
have done.

1008
00:53:08.939 --> 00:53:12.860
And earlier, when we talked about poverty and economic

1009
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:16.770
inequality, you mentioned at a certain point that it

1010
00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:22.060
is also important for people who design social policies

1011
00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:25.489
to keep in mind the role that randomness and

1012
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.489
chance events play in people's lives. So do you

1013
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:33.679
think that even reps beyond uh poverty and economics.

1014
00:53:33.689 --> 00:53:40.219
Politicians should keep randomness in mind when designing social

1015
00:53:40.229 --> 00:53:40.919
policy.

1016
00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:44.550
Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, the whole idea again of

1017
00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.959
social policy, a lot of it is designed to

1018
00:53:47.969 --> 00:53:50.459
address some of the bad luck that can happen

1019
00:53:50.469 --> 00:53:53.310
to people down the road. I think another aspect

1020
00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:57.020
of this is when you accept the fact that

1021
00:53:57.229 --> 00:53:59.239
there are good breaks in life, there are bad

1022
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:03.989
breaks in life. One, it, it, it instills a

1023
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.540
sense of humility in your success. I didn't do

1024
00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:09.560
it all on my own. I got some breaks

1025
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:11.320
along the way. I should be a little bit

1026
00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:15.169
humble in terms of talking about my success. But

1027
00:54:15.179 --> 00:54:18.550
I should also have some empathy for those who

1028
00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.840
are in a less fortunate place because it may

1029
00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:22.840
have nothing to do with them. It may have

1030
00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:24.709
just been, you know, the lottery of birth or

1031
00:54:24.719 --> 00:54:27.850
whatever it may be. And the idea of empathy

1032
00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:29.879
I think is really important in terms of thinking

1033
00:54:29.889 --> 00:54:33.409
about social policy. You know, when we are empathetic

1034
00:54:33.419 --> 00:54:35.639
towards other, then we're gonna say, you know what,

1035
00:54:35.649 --> 00:54:37.600
maybe we should have some things in place to

1036
00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:40.780
help folks and protect people. So I think that

1037
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:42.600
that's, that's very much the case.

1038
00:54:42.919 --> 00:54:46.699
Mhm So my last question then will be and

1039
00:54:46.709 --> 00:54:50.500
you've already talked a little bit about meritocracy earlier.

1040
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:54.199
But let me ask you uh within this framework

1041
00:54:54.209 --> 00:54:57.540
that you present in the book, is there still

1042
00:54:57.550 --> 00:55:03.179
place for any form of meritocracy and if so

1043
00:55:03.189 --> 00:55:06.479
how would it need to be reframed?

1044
00:55:07.399 --> 00:55:09.669
Yeah, I think it's, I think that the way

1045
00:55:09.679 --> 00:55:12.419
you put that is, is reframed is a really

1046
00:55:12.429 --> 00:55:16.389
important aspect of this, that there certainly are, you

1047
00:55:16.399 --> 00:55:20.780
know, life and, and how, how outcomes occur during

1048
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:24.489
life are, are affected by a lot of things.

1049
00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.649
Um, THEY'RE affected by many, many things and one

1050
00:55:27.659 --> 00:55:29.709
of them is, is sort of the, um, you

1051
00:55:29.719 --> 00:55:33.080
know, our abilities or our determination, the decisions we

1052
00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:36.239
make, all of these things are important. But again,

1053
00:55:36.959 --> 00:55:39.610
the dynamic of life is not just that it's

1054
00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:43.850
also how these things interact with chance, random, randomness

1055
00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:47.560
and luck. And so yes, there's something to be

1056
00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:50.419
said for meritocracy, but we need to tweak kind

1057
00:55:50.429 --> 00:55:53.360
of our idea about it. It's not just complete

1058
00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:57.260
meritocracy neither is it just all chance and luck?

1059
00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.770
Um So I think that that's, that's, that's really

1060
00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:02.570
important. Here's another thing that II I wanna bring

1061
00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:05.550
out. Um BECAUSE sometimes, you know, the idea of

1062
00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:08.250
thinking about chance and luck is, is seen in

1063
00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:11.520
a negative way. I would like to reframe this

1064
00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:14.040
in a very positive way. And, and here's what

1065
00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:17.750
I mean by that. Imagine if there were no

1066
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.189
chance or luck at all in the world, imagine

1067
00:56:21.199 --> 00:56:25.260
everything was a fait accompli what a boring life.

1068
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:28.540
That would be. How boring would that be if

1069
00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:31.199
there was no chance when I wake up in

1070
00:56:31.209 --> 00:56:34.750
the morning? I think, OK, my life today is

1071
00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:37.330
gonna play out a certain way. But there's always

1072
00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.860
this element of chance and luck. And that's what

1073
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:43.570
gives life its spice. That's what gives life its

1074
00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:47.350
dynamic quality is that there's always a chance something

1075
00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.320
out of the blue may happen. And that's a

1076
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:51.909
real gift. I think that's like, that's what makes

1077
00:56:51.919 --> 00:56:56.489
life really interesting. So, II, I would ask listeners

1078
00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:58.929
to kind of think about that as well as

1079
00:56:58.939 --> 00:57:01.919
a real positive aspect of the world of chance.

1080
00:57:01.929 --> 00:57:02.949
Luck and randomness.

1081
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:07.100
Great. So the book is again, The Random Factor.

1082
00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:10.219
How chance and luck profoundly shape our lives and

1083
00:57:10.229 --> 00:57:12.449
the world around us. I'm leaving a link to

1084
00:57:12.459 --> 00:57:14.949
it in the description of the interview. When doctor

1085
00:57:14.959 --> 00:57:17.780

00:57:33.334 --> 00:57:35.774
of people um have, have accessed over the years.

1093
00:57:35.784 --> 00:57:38.114
