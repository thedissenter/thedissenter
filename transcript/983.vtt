00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.140
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.920
Center. I'm your host, as always Ricardo Los. And

3
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:09.329
today I'm joined by Doctor Vinod go. He's professor

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.449
in the Department of Psychology at York University. And

5
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.129
today we're talking about his book, Reason and Less

6
00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.639
Pursuing Food, sex and Politics. So, Doctor Goel, welcome

7
00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:22.799
to the show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:25.010
Thank you, Ricardo. I'm pleased to be here.

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.860
So I would like to start by asking you

10
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.159
about what rationality is. I mean, how you understand

11
00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:38.659
it because if I ask people from different scientific

12
00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:44.330
disciplines, they would probably have slightly different understandings and

13
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.369
definitions of rationality. But since if I understand it

14
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.259
correctly, of course, you, what you bring into the

15
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.810
book is mostly an evolutionary and the neuroscientific perspective.

16
00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:58.979
What is rationality in this context?

17
00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:02.990
So let me give you a very basic uh

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.480
definition of rationality. And this is the definition that

19
00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:08.290
I think everyone needs to agree with. And then

20
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.440
on top of this, they can build their other

21
00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:15.199
more specific definition. So as you know, uh you

22
00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:17.239
know, we are the rational animals, that's how we

23
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.129
define ourselves. That's how Aristotle defined us. And by

24
00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:25.319
this, what we mean is that volitional human behavior

25
00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.540
is explained in terms of rationality or in terms

26
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.080
of reason. And so reason, rationality has three components.

27
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.190
Uh It's, if you're gonna build a model of

28
00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:39.569
rationality, you need three things, you need beliefs, you

29
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.830
need uh goals or desires and you need a

30
00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:45.839
principle of coherence. And uh uh when we are

31
00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:49.800
rational, what we do is we select our actions

32
00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:56.330
um to be consistent with our goals, given certain

33
00:01:56.339 --> 00:02:00.879
beliefs. And uh then that's it, that, that's uh

34
00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:04.220
what rationality is. Let me give you a couple

35
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.110
of very quick examples to point out to point

36
00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.350
this out. So I'm sitting at my desk here

37
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.259
in front of my computer and there is a

38
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.440
uh a bottle of water on my right hand

39
00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.100
side, I'm thirsty and I desire to take a

40
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.210
drink of water. If I reach out to the

41
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.460
right hand side of the table, pick up the

42
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.570
thermos, bring it to my lips and drink, that's

43
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.100
rational, but having the same beliefs and desire that

44
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.529
is a desire to uh drink the water and

45
00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.520
the belief that the thermos is on my right

46
00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.770
hand side, I reach out to the left hand

47
00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:43.149
side of my desk. That's irrational. Mhm. That, that's

48
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.100
really, you know, uh that's sort of a very

49
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.169
simple example and I can give you, I mean,

50
00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:53.039
a more realistic example um that we might actually,

51
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.949
that might serve some purpose later on. Uh THINK

52
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.720
of um uh parole judges making decisions. OK. This

53
00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:06.190
is a, a rational task. Uh So again, three

54
00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:11.169
components to the model, uh a desire, certain beliefs

55
00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.399
and a coherence relation. So the desire in this

56
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.259
case might be something like upholding the law and

57
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.380
protecting society. That's what the judge wants to do.

58
00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:23.470
That's the goal and they may have certain beliefs

59
00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:25.979
and these beliefs will be based on the information

60
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.589
they've been provided about the applicant. So maybe the

61
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.070
information is things like has served the mandatory mendum

62
00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:36.779
was an exemplary prisoner is not likely to reoffend

63
00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:40.320
and there's no objecting statement from the victim. And

64
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.830
so given those the des desire and those beliefs,

65
00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.139
you bring those together with the coherence relation and

66
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:50.919
there is a certain uh uh decision or action

67
00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:53.500
that follows grant or uh uh not grant uh

68
00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:57.929
parole. And that essentially is uh the uh uh

69
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.210
uh at the core of models of uh uh

70
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.850
of reasoning. And the um uh but the problem

71
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.410
with these models is that um they fall short

72
00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:20.820
and then, um uh I mean, and, and iii

73
00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.250
I can illustrate this uh uh for you with

74
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.720
a um uh with an example that uh really

75
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.829
had a profound effect upon me. This is an

76
00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:37.480
example uh from 2021 this was an interview that

77
00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:40.399
Francis Collins who was then the head of the

78
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.790
NIH. So he was the head of the NIH

79
00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:46.209
for 12 years. He was stepping down in 2021

80
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.950
and December 2021 and he was interviewed by a

81
00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:52.750
reporter and she asked him, well, uh you know,

82
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.079
what are some of the successes and regrets of

83
00:04:55.089 --> 00:05:01.420
your t 12 year tenure? And among the successes,

84
00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:04.489
he noted a number of significant advances in biomedical

85
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.119
research, but among his regrets what he said, and

86
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.480
I, I, let me, let me actually read this

87
00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:16.149
to you. What he said is to have now

88
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.890
60 million people still holding off, taking advantage of

89
00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:24.970
life saving vaccines is pretty unexpected. It does make

90
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.989
me at least realize boy, there are things about

91
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.970
human behavior that I don't think we had invested

92
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.970
enough into understanding. So what he's saying is not

93
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.269
that these models uh need to be tweaked or

94
00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:41.709
he's saying we missed the ballpark on this in

95
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.040
terms of our models of uh uh uh human

96
00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:49.140
behavior. And I came to a similar realization uh

97
00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:53.390
some uh 56 years ago uh when uh I,

98
00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:56.709
I've been working on um sort of the neural

99
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.450
basis of uh human rationality for 20 plus years

100
00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:03.299
at the time. And it seemed to me that

101
00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:07.339
uh uh nothing that I knew was relevant to

102
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.880
explaining the behavior of my teenage daughter or my

103
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.410
Trump neighbors in Florida who profess an unshakable faith

104
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.470
in American exceptionalism. But then go on to deny

105
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.489
and ridicule the signs of climate change emerging from

106
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.089
exceptional American institutions, uh or why intelligent powerful men

107
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.869
engage in sexual indiscretion, even assault at great personal

108
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.100
risk and to themselves and harm to others. Uh

109
00:06:32.109 --> 00:06:35.649
WHY I overindulge in chocolate cake and pizza. So,

110
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.690
um uh so while the model is very simple

111
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.220
and it's ubiquitous in some sense, we can't, you

112
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.500
know, this is uh even in the absence of

113
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.450
any uh uh formal uh you know, knowledge of

114
00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:56.160
psychology or decision making. So this is how we,

115
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.890
you know, this is how we predict each other's

116
00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:02.970
uh uh behavior. But um and this is, you

117
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.010
know, and our uh formal models, uh and this

118
00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:08.790
is where you'll get the difference as you, as

119
00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:10.359
you mentioned at the beginning, when you ask the

120
00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:13.010
question that if you ask the three different people,

121
00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:16.049
what is rationality? If they're giving you a definition

122
00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:18.459
based on their formal model, this is where you,

123
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:23.910
the differences will arise. Um And um and these

124
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:30.440
differences are largely um uh the, the, they know

125
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.649
they largely result from the fact that uh we

126
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.410
have to a uh uh we have to account

127
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.459
for the failures of the model and the differences

128
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.940
are, you know, how do we account for the

129
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.739
differences? And usually we just account for the differences

130
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.390
by assuming rationality, but then placing certain constraints on

131
00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:53.619
it, like heuristics and biases fast and slow, motivated

132
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.700
reasoning, sloppy, reasoning, pure education, you know, and so

133
00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:00.489
forth. Um And uh so these are just largely

134
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.130
just uh uh cognitive tweaks that try to save

135
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:09.179
us from irrationality. Yeah. And so my own concern

136
00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:11.200
uh in the book has not been so much

137
00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:14.829
with irrational behavior, but which is the failure of

138
00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:19.359
coherence, but rather with irrational behavior, which I define

139
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:24.049
as behavior driven or modulated by non rational systems.

140
00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:28.890
So that's really what I've uh um become interested

141
00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:31.600
in. And again, if you like, I can give

142
00:08:31.609 --> 00:08:35.130
you a simple example of this based on the

143
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.960
previous example I gave of the parole judges in

144
00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:42.658
making the decision. And so that, that's a rational

145
00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:45.059
task, right? This is the reasoning mind at work.

146
00:08:45.068 --> 00:08:48.098
There's a famous study by Dan Zinger at all

147
00:08:48.109 --> 00:08:51.768
from 2011 in which he studied these, you know,

148
00:08:51.778 --> 00:08:55.309
a number of pro judges making decisions. And what

149
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.010
he reported is when, when the, when the pro

150
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.299
judges were well fed after a good meal, uh

151
00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:06.400
the favorable pro rating uh rulings were about 65%.

152
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.020
But prior to a food break, when they were

153
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:15.250
hungry, the favorable ratings dropped to zero. And so

154
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.469
the reasoning mind can't explain this, right? It it

155
00:09:17.479 --> 00:09:19.549
can say it's noise, it's this or that, but

156
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.330
it can't really explain this. And so the only

157
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.289
way you can explain this is presumably it has

158
00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:26.090
something to do with low blood sugar level. And

159
00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:28.669
so you need a model whereby uh these non

160
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:33.419
reasoning systems can actually interact with reasoning systems. Uh

161
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.150
So, mhm

162
00:09:35.669 --> 00:09:37.450
A and uh let me ask you a, a

163
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.090
different kind of questions still rationality related. So how

164
00:09:42.099 --> 00:09:46.520
does rationality relate to other aspects of human cognition?

165
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.210
Like the emotions? I mean, what role do emotions

166
00:09:50.219 --> 00:09:54.650
play in? I guess we could say, informing how

167
00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:58.140
we make decisions? And so how do they relate

168
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.719
to rationality?

169
00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:05.440
OK. OK. So traditionally, emotions and reason or rationality

170
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.619
have been contrasted, right? That they belong to two

171
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:12.000
different worlds. And here there's a quote from Seneca

172
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.159
that I use in my lectures to my students

173
00:10:15.429 --> 00:10:17.659
that I think is brilliant. And I, I I'm

174
00:10:17.669 --> 00:10:18.979
going to make a note of it here and

175
00:10:18.989 --> 00:10:22.729
I'm going to read it to you. He said

176
00:10:22.969 --> 00:10:27.429
some tw 2000 years ago, Reeves and herself, to

177
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.770
whom the reins of power had been entrusted remains

178
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.250
mistress. Only so long as she was kept apart

179
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.770
from the passions. If once she mingles with them

180
00:10:37.909 --> 00:10:41.679
and is contaminated, she becomes unable to hold back

181
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.200
those whom she might have cleared from her path

182
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.440
for when once the mind has been aroused and

183
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.150
shaken, it becomes the slave of the disturbing agent,

184
00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.479
right? And so this is sort of guided our

185
00:10:54.489 --> 00:11:01.650
uh uh approach to reason and emotions. Now, the

186
00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:07.760
thing is we still, uh we were, I think

187
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.979
we're, most of us are still uh uh wanting

188
00:11:10.989 --> 00:11:14.380
to separate them. But there is, I mean, if

189
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.159
you just look at the uh sort of that

190
00:11:17.169 --> 00:11:20.280
I, I gave you the definition of emotions, emotions,

191
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.960
uh beliefs and desires and coherence, relationships. Uh So,

192
00:11:23.969 --> 00:11:27.760
beliefs and desires are intentional states right there. Um

193
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.780
So, emotions also have intentional states. Uh So, for

194
00:11:32.789 --> 00:11:35.380
example, if I am, uh if I am uh

195
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.419
fear, well, it's fear of something, I mean, a

196
00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:41.299
fear of snakes, right? So the, so the, the,

197
00:11:41.309 --> 00:11:44.219
the uh the, the they are referential just like

198
00:11:44.229 --> 00:11:49.270
uh uh the, the states involved in reason, Uh

199
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.679
they also have cognitive antecedents. So that is that

200
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:58.099
um uh I might uh come to the belief

201
00:11:58.109 --> 00:12:00.940
that it is raining outside. Uh If I see

202
00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.590
my wife walk in with her umbrella, shaking the

203
00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:05.260
water off of it so that, you know, that

204
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.580
results in that. But where they differ from the

205
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:13.250
types of uh uh intentional states that we uh

206
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.909
uh we typically implicate when we're talking about reason

207
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.010
is that they also have a valence, physiological arousal

208
00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:25.510
and temporal duration. And this is so typically, I

209
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.909
mean, the idea is beliefs uh uh uh uh

210
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.059
uh and desires don't have this, I take exception

211
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.710
to that I think they do. But the traditional

212
00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:35.950
story is they don't so ve you know, um

213
00:12:36.219 --> 00:12:39.219
uh so emotions can be positive or negative. Fear

214
00:12:39.229 --> 00:12:42.770
is negative. Uh YOU know, uh seeing an old

215
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.770
friend, uh the happiness, the warmth you feel is

216
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:50.070
positive arousal is the level of positive or negative.

217
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.820
Um uh TEMPORAL duration is how long it lasts.

218
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.320
There are also physiological expressions associated with emotions, like

219
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:04.140
facial expressions, um uh their action tendencies. Um So

220
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.960
happiness um would make you want to approach um

221
00:13:08.969 --> 00:13:13.080
fear, withdraw, anger, strike out at the other, in

222
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.580
uh uh strike at the other individual. So there

223
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.559
is this overlap uh between uh emotions and reason.

224
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:26.539
Um THOUGH, as I've said, we've um we want

225
00:13:26.549 --> 00:13:32.179
to sort of uh um pull them apart. Uh

226
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:37.659
Yeah. And um uh I, so this is something

227
00:13:37.669 --> 00:13:40.190
I think as the field we're still struggling with.

228
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.359
Uh

229
00:13:41.359 --> 00:13:45.719
mhm uh IS struggling with understanding exactly what is

230
00:13:45.729 --> 00:13:51.119
the ratio uh the relationship between reason and rationality

231
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:51.919
and emotions.

232
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.880
Yes, because the uh as I said, several of

233
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.280
the components are the same and we can. So

234
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.669
uh so the reason, so what, what the struggle,

235
00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:07.369
what the, the the challenge is, is uh uh

236
00:14:08.099 --> 00:14:12.950
you can reason regarding your fears about snakes regarding,

237
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.989
you know, uh if you're uh if you're afraid

238
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.700
of snakes, you believe there are snakes outside, then

239
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.320
you don't go outside. That's rational, that is very

240
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.880
consistent with the uh um the, you know, the

241
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.520
definition of uh uh reason I provided earlier. But

242
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:33.780
the issue arises is uh what is the contribution,

243
00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:37.669
what is the effect on behavior when you have

244
00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:45.330
val uh arousal uh uh involved and the, the

245
00:14:45.549 --> 00:14:48.150
uh iii I think what, what the uh the

246
00:14:48.159 --> 00:14:54.150
involvement of these uh affective components to these uh

247
00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:59.000
psychological states, what they do is they um uh

248
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.789
they are there because they are associated with certain

249
00:15:01.799 --> 00:15:05.679
action tendencies. They may be uh allow for the

250
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.229
bypassing of uh the rational response. I mean, uh

251
00:15:10.359 --> 00:15:12.679
I think there's a story something like that to

252
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.849
be told here

253
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.140
a and so related to that uh in the

254
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.719
book, you talk about this concept of the uh

255
00:15:21.729 --> 00:15:25.929
te rationality and later on, we're going to come

256
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.809
back to this concept but to talk about the

257
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.549
mind more generally. But uh now at this point,

258
00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:37.869
uh could you tell us what the tehr rationality

259
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.400
is?

260
00:15:38.679 --> 00:15:43.179
Yes, so tendered rationality. So this is the idea

261
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.859
that while we are reasoning animals, our system of

262
00:15:46.869 --> 00:15:50.099
reason does not float of the biology. It's not

263
00:15:50.109 --> 00:15:53.099
powered by angel dust. It evolved on top of

264
00:15:53.109 --> 00:15:55.859
it and is integrated into the neurology. We share

265
00:15:55.869 --> 00:15:59.510
with our common ancestors with bats and baboons. So

266
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.960
our reasoning mind is tethered to evolutionary older systems

267
00:16:02.989 --> 00:16:05.729
such as the autonomic system, the instinctive system and

268
00:16:06.195 --> 00:16:10.974
systems. And so volitional human behavior on the traditional

269
00:16:10.984 --> 00:16:14.354
account is a function of the rational mind on

270
00:16:14.364 --> 00:16:18.604
the tethered rationality account. Volitional human behavior is a

271
00:16:18.614 --> 00:16:23.369
blended response of reasoning and non reasoning systems. OK.

272
00:16:23.539 --> 00:16:27.049
And I think this follows uh this sort of

273
00:16:27.059 --> 00:16:29.940
a truism. It follows from the theory of evolution

274
00:16:30.299 --> 00:16:34.380
and the 150 years of neurobiology. Uh And I

275
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.820
also think this tethering is not a flaw to

276
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.859
be ignored as noise or a finer grain question.

277
00:16:39.869 --> 00:16:42.940
We come back to another day. It's uh fundamental

278
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.570
to understanding uh how the human mind works, how

279
00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.979
human behavior, uh how we explain human behavior. Um

280
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.059
And I, I can give you a, an everyday

281
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.239
example to illustrate the tethered mind at work. The,

282
00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:01.369
um um you know, a few, couple of years

283
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.339
ago, I had a colleague who, who was, he

284
00:17:04.348 --> 00:17:07.500
was into boating and he was looking to buy

285
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.848
a new boat and he was flipping through the

286
00:17:09.858 --> 00:17:13.020
pamphlet uh uh of the uh of the boats.

287
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:18.598
And um in each of the pictures, there was

288
00:17:18.608 --> 00:17:20.689
the picture of the boat and there was a

289
00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:24.198
picture of an attractive woman uh in a bikini.

290
00:17:24.208 --> 00:17:27.030
And I asked him, does the woman come with

291
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.530
the boat? And so the point is why is

292
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.869
we know that the woman doesn't come with the

293
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.189
boat? Why is the woman there? Well, it has

294
00:17:37.199 --> 00:17:39.410
to do with the, the, the, the, the, the

295
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.280
way our minds are structured. So the uh uh

296
00:17:43.859 --> 00:17:46.380
because it's mostly men that buy boats. Uh uh

297
00:17:46.739 --> 00:17:49.550
uh YOU know, uh we are wired in such

298
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.800
a way. We like looking at attractive women, the

299
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.310
instinctive mind. Uh So it, this is something that

300
00:17:55.319 --> 00:17:59.079
gets us to look the and so associating putting

301
00:17:59.089 --> 00:18:02.839
the woman beside the boat, this the associative mind.

302
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.180
So we like, you know, this positive. So the

303
00:18:05.189 --> 00:18:09.329
boat gets a positive connotation from that. Thirdly, we

304
00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:12.520
know the woman doesn't come with the boat. So

305
00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:16.560
the reasoning mind knows this. But nonetheless, the uh

306
00:18:16.569 --> 00:18:19.949
given the instinctive and social mind, I it is

307
00:18:19.959 --> 00:18:23.739
worth it. It works, right. So, advertisers know it

308
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.459
works. This is why they spent millions of dollars

309
00:18:26.469 --> 00:18:29.920
doing this. If uh it didn't work, they wouldn't

310
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:33.500
pay the models to be in the pictures. So,

311
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.729
uh this is, you know, a sort of a

312
00:18:35.739 --> 00:18:39.510
very simple example, everyday example of the tethered minded

313
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.209
work uh in all advertising, uh we're appealing to

314
00:18:44.219 --> 00:18:47.719
factors. Uh We're appealing to recently factors. Sometimes we

315
00:18:47.729 --> 00:18:50.500
list the ingredients on a particular product or that.

316
00:18:50.739 --> 00:18:53.500
But there, there are these other factors, the, you

317
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.660
know, associative mind, instinctive mind, uh autonomic systems um

318
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.729
uh that we're appealing to when you go to

319
00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:03.689
a uh uh a movie theater and sometimes they

320
00:19:03.699 --> 00:19:06.750
will uh at least in North America, they will

321
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:11.209
uh uh pump the smell of popcorn, buttered popcorn

322
00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:15.979
into the theater, right? That's the autonomic system angry

323
00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:19.239
you go buy popcorn. So we all know this.

324
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:23.810
But um in our formal models, we uh we

325
00:19:23.819 --> 00:19:26.260
sort of uh uh ignore it, we think, you

326
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.729
know, we have to explain it just with the

327
00:19:27.739 --> 00:19:30.949
reasoning mind so that the mi the tethered mind

328
00:19:30.959 --> 00:19:34.939
is the idea that um uh the all of

329
00:19:34.949 --> 00:19:38.349
these systems have a role to play in uh

330
00:19:38.359 --> 00:19:41.400
behavior that it's a blended response of these various

331
00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:42.109
systems.

332
00:19:42.869 --> 00:19:46.359
Uh But there, in your answer, you mentioned uh

333
00:19:46.599 --> 00:19:51.800
34, actually different systems, the autonomic, instinctual, the associative

334
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:56.099
and the reasoning system. So, rationality or reasoning, we've

335
00:19:56.109 --> 00:19:59.650
already talked a lot about. But of course, the

336
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.290
example you gave there are the examples are very

337
00:20:02.625 --> 00:20:05.145
illustrative. But could you tell us a little bit

338
00:20:05.155 --> 00:20:10.185
more about what exactly are these systems? The autonomic,

339
00:20:10.194 --> 00:20:14.375
the instinctual and the associative systems and perhaps how

340
00:20:14.385 --> 00:20:19.444
you approach them from the perspective of neuroscience and

341
00:20:19.454 --> 00:20:21.854
how they relate to one another, by the way.

342
00:20:22.334 --> 00:20:25.959
Yeah. Yeah. So these are systems that have been

343
00:20:25.969 --> 00:20:29.500
studied for the past 100 years, the autonomic instinctive

344
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.790
and associative systems and we actually know a great

345
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.180
deal about them both at the uh sort of

346
00:20:36.189 --> 00:20:40.319
psychological level. Uh AND at the uh neurological level.

347
00:20:40.589 --> 00:20:44.339
So the autonomic system is the most basic, it's

348
00:20:44.349 --> 00:20:47.520
a system that uh uh we and nonhuman animals,

349
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.709
we all have its goal, its function is to

350
00:20:50.719 --> 00:20:54.949
monitor and control internal behavior. So think of digestion,

351
00:20:54.959 --> 00:20:58.170
think of blood sugar monitoring, think of breathing, think

352
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.859
of your heart beating. Uh Thi this is the

353
00:21:00.869 --> 00:21:06.949
autonomic system and it um um it does this

354
00:21:06.959 --> 00:21:11.229
and in terms of uh um you know, we

355
00:21:11.239 --> 00:21:14.380
we it's the most of this wiring is in

356
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.609
the brain stem and diencephalon is a very low

357
00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:20.109
level uh uh neural structure. The system is obviously

358
00:21:20.119 --> 00:21:22.599
innate, you don't learn to breathe or to uh

359
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:27.099
digest. And there is a very sort of tight

360
00:21:27.109 --> 00:21:31.660
um causal coupling between the, the um you know,

361
00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:37.390
the stimulus and the response and the um um

362
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.310
the other systems. Uh I think so, the economic

363
00:21:41.819 --> 00:21:45.380
uh instinctive system now. So with the economic system,

364
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.469
so the key was that it regulates monitors and

365
00:21:48.479 --> 00:21:52.589
regulates the internal environment with the instinctive and associative

366
00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:56.239
and reasoning systems, therefore, monitoring and controlling or regulating

367
00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:03.069
the external environment. So the um um so let

368
00:22:03.079 --> 00:22:06.369
me say a couple of words about instincts. So

369
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.739
instincts has become a dirty word banned from psychology

370
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.229
and Polite Society. Uh This was not always the

371
00:22:14.239 --> 00:22:18.589
case in the 19 twenties. Um uh You know,

372
00:22:18.599 --> 00:22:20.290
if you go back and read some of the

373
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.260
classic uh psychology textbooks uh by mcdougall and at

374
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.109
all, it was front and center in terms of

375
00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:30.189
explaining human behavior. It wasn't, that's not all human

376
00:22:30.199 --> 00:22:33.270
behavior is, but it was recognized that the just

377
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.969
like other animals, we have uh uh this component

378
00:22:36.979 --> 00:22:41.089
to our behavior and instincts are usually defined, they're

379
00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:44.930
considered to be innate. Uh They're usually species or

380
00:22:44.939 --> 00:22:49.530
sex and gender specific. Uh THEY'RE stereotype behaviors. Uh

381
00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.209
They can be available from birth or within some

382
00:22:52.219 --> 00:22:56.349
sort of developmental windows and they're triggered by specific

383
00:22:56.359 --> 00:23:01.780
stimuli uh mostly hardwired in some cortical systems. Uh

384
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.069
And again, they're tight causal connection between stimulus and

385
00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:09.930
response. So examples are nest building in birds, the

386
00:23:09.939 --> 00:23:14.300
second response in mammals. Now, these are uncontroversial examples,

387
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.930
these two. But again, uh we could also have

388
00:23:17.939 --> 00:23:22.500
other examples. Um I could say uh territorial response,

389
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:26.130
gender related behaviors. Now, when I say this, if

390
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.819
I'm talking about wolves, you, there is no problem.

391
00:23:30.619 --> 00:23:34.099
Uh If I'm talking about humans, now there is

392
00:23:34.109 --> 00:23:37.130
an uproar and, but instead of an uproar, we

393
00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.699
have actually a question, I think we, uh so

394
00:23:39.709 --> 00:23:42.729
when we territorial response in humans, for example, when

395
00:23:42.739 --> 00:23:45.619
we shout, build that wall, build that wall is

396
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:49.089
the same mechanism that's responsible. Is there overlap between

397
00:23:49.099 --> 00:23:52.089
that mechanism and what's going on in wolves and

398
00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:55.359
other territorial animals. But uh i it's a question,

399
00:23:55.719 --> 00:23:58.949
uh gender related behaviors. Uh Again, we accept them

400
00:23:59.099 --> 00:24:01.979
in nonhuman animals. And as you know, it's very,

401
00:24:01.989 --> 00:24:05.459
very contentious in uh uh in humans. But again,

402
00:24:05.469 --> 00:24:09.599
it's a um um it's a legitimate uh uh

403
00:24:09.609 --> 00:24:13.760
uh question to ask. And my own view of

404
00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:17.880
these latter behaviors is that uh there is a

405
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:22.510
uh a instinctive component, but we also have a

406
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.079
reasoning mind. And so they, they get, they can

407
00:24:26.089 --> 00:24:29.599
be modulated to some extent uh one way or

408
00:24:29.609 --> 00:24:34.479
the other. And, but unfortunately that these days it's

409
00:24:34.489 --> 00:24:40.819
a um uh it's a minority position because most

410
00:24:40.829 --> 00:24:45.109
social scientists, most, I mean, society is la at

411
00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:49.140
large. Uh We've sort of somehow come to the

412
00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:54.390
conclusion that um uh humans no longer need to

413
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.630
rely on instincts to survive. Uh BECAUSE we have

414
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.989
education, technology and social norms that somehow they supersede

415
00:25:02.339 --> 00:25:05.089
uh uh uh you know, our instincts and our

416
00:25:05.099 --> 00:25:08.969
instincts go away. Uh No that's not uh uh

417
00:25:08.979 --> 00:25:13.400
uh uh uh the case. Um AND William James

418
00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:16.550
uh knew better, I think uh uh than many

419
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.130
modern uh uh uh uh psychologists and social scientists.

420
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.180
And, uh but again, as I say, give whether

421
00:25:25.189 --> 00:25:29.020
a particular behavior is instinctive or not, uh is

422
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.630
uh can be a complex question. It's not, uh

423
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.900
you know, it's, it's not trivial like an autonomic

424
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.880
system we can identify and we don't really argue

425
00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:38.430
about is this an autonomic function or not or

426
00:25:38.439 --> 00:25:40.579
you know, but with instincts, yes, we do. Uh

427
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.849
So I personally use a uh sort of a

428
00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:48.189
uh uh five question scale, you know, to determine

429
00:25:48.199 --> 00:25:51.060
whether something should fall on the instinctive side or

430
00:25:51.069 --> 00:25:52.400
the social norm side.

431
00:25:52.849 --> 00:25:56.579
OK. So tell us about that. Uh Those five

432
00:25:56.589 --> 00:25:57.540
questions.

433
00:25:57.849 --> 00:26:02.310
OK. So is the trait in question? Is it

434
00:26:02.319 --> 00:26:05.250
present in all human species or sorry, all human

435
00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:09.209
societies? Uh Are there variants of it on other

436
00:26:09.219 --> 00:26:11.430
branches of the phylogenetic tree? Can we see it,

437
00:26:11.439 --> 00:26:13.300
you know, a little some variation of it on

438
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:16.959
monkeys and apes? Uh Does it emerge early in

439
00:26:16.969 --> 00:26:21.270
human infants prior to any opportunity for extensive socialization?

440
00:26:21.989 --> 00:26:25.920
Uh Four. Is it underwritten by implicit autonomic low-level

441
00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:30.180
mechanisms? Uh Five. Is there a dedicated neural circuitry?

442
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.750
So my idea is if you answer yes to

443
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.630
most of these questions, then that trade or that

444
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.319
behavior is gonna fall on the instinctive side if

445
00:26:39.329 --> 00:26:41.670
you answer no to them to most of them,

446
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.369
it's gonna fall on the social norm, learned side.

447
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:46.989
Yeah.

448
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.380
Yeah. Uh, I think, let me just comment and

449
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.630
please, if you disagree, tell me. But I guess

450
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.339
that, uh, uh, to a great extent, I understand

451
00:26:58.349 --> 00:27:01.310
the issue that many people nowadays have with the

452
00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:05.780
term instinct because, uh, I mean, at least, I

453
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:11.349
guess the way it was conceptualized, uh, earlier when

454
00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:14.630
people still talked about instincts, it sounded as if

455
00:27:14.979 --> 00:27:21.910
the instincts corresponded to behaviors that were completely impermeable

456
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:27.349
to environmental inputs to things like learning, culture, your

457
00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:31.640
reasoning even, I mean, that it was basically something

458
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:36.150
that was inborn and where whenever we were exposed

459
00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:41.189
to particular kinds of stimuli, the output, the behavioral

460
00:27:41.199 --> 00:27:44.869
output would always be the same. And nowadays, for

461
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.319
example, of course, as I mentioned, there, there's a

462
00:27:47.329 --> 00:27:52.869
big debate uh talking about different kinds of behaviors

463
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.589
to what extent they are the result of the

464
00:27:56.599 --> 00:28:00.060
environment or if they are more innate or not.

465
00:28:00.069 --> 00:28:02.630
I mean, we still use the word innate and

466
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.099
we talk about psychological predispositions for example. But I

467
00:28:07.109 --> 00:28:11.949
guess that is, that's the main worry there that

468
00:28:11.959 --> 00:28:15.430
perhaps by using the word instinct, you're pointing to

469
00:28:15.439 --> 00:28:20.180
something that is completely, that is inborn and completely

470
00:28:20.189 --> 00:28:25.089
impermeable to any sort of uh environmental inputs to

471
00:28:25.099 --> 00:28:30.140
any sort of modification by learning reasoning or some

472
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.349
other mechanism. Do you think that's fair to say

473
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:38.099
yes. But I don't think so. You're correct in

474
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.680
uh uh in pointing out this is how people

475
00:28:41.689 --> 00:28:44.270
sort of con uh conceive of instincts and this

476
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.520
is why the push back against them. But I

477
00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:52.060
think the, uh it's uh erroneous to think of

478
00:28:52.069 --> 00:28:56.219
instincts like an automatic reaction as uh like a

479
00:28:56.229 --> 00:28:59.050
reflex arc. Now in the tw uh in the

480
00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.010
19 twenties, uh we did think of instincts as

481
00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.810
reflex arcs as a complex series of reflex arcs.

482
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:08.939
But because they could be the, the, there, there

483
00:29:08.949 --> 00:29:11.510
are certain exceptions, you can get a behavior in

484
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.010
the absence of a stimuli or you can have

485
00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.569
the stimuli and not get the behavior. So this

486
00:29:16.579 --> 00:29:20.479
occurs. And so to accommodate this, the mo you

487
00:29:20.489 --> 00:29:22.890
know, that we had to change our model of

488
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.640
instincts. And so I like to think of instincts

489
00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:30.329
as sort of compulsive behaviors. You're sort of compelled

490
00:29:30.339 --> 00:29:34.930
to do this and um that there is this

491
00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:39.199
compulsion but whether it can be overridden or whether

492
00:29:39.209 --> 00:29:43.589
one can take steps to uh prevent it is

493
00:29:43.599 --> 00:29:45.729
a uh is an open question. It depends on

494
00:29:45.739 --> 00:29:47.719
the model. So let, let me give you an

495
00:29:47.729 --> 00:29:52.550
example, a non-controversial example. Um uh YOU know, you

496
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.520
have a pet dog, you teach that dog to

497
00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:59.349
walk at your heel and uh you, you, you

498
00:29:59.359 --> 00:30:01.949
know, you use operant conditioning to do that associative

499
00:30:01.959 --> 00:30:05.680
learning and uh you say heel and the dog

500
00:30:05.689 --> 00:30:07.160
will walk at your heel and you can walk

501
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.880
along, you know, the road uh with this dog.

502
00:30:10.619 --> 00:30:14.109
And uh the dog wanders off, you say he

503
00:30:14.119 --> 00:30:16.500
again and again, the dog will walk about, a

504
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:20.079
squirrel runs out in front of the dog. Now,

505
00:30:20.089 --> 00:30:22.520
in certain cases, now that to chase that squirrel

506
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.390
is an instinctive behavior or chase that rabbit, you

507
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.900
know, it's an instinctive behavior. So the uh the

508
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.469
dog might take off after that rabbit or it

509
00:30:31.479 --> 00:30:33.739
may be well enough trained that it can resist

510
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:37.989
that compulsion to do so. So, II I like

511
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.849
this, I say so it's not like a reflex.

512
00:30:39.859 --> 00:30:41.640
Ar no, you see the rabbit, you go off,

513
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:43.459
you know the dog go goes. No, the dog

514
00:30:43.469 --> 00:30:46.660
can um dog may well do that. But um

515
00:30:46.959 --> 00:30:49.859
uh iii I it may not depend on how

516
00:30:49.869 --> 00:30:50.650
well it's trained. Yeah.

517
00:30:51.709 --> 00:30:56.750
Mhm I understand. So we've already talked here about

518
00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.250
coherence when I asked you about what rationality is

519
00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.150
according to the framework you bring into the book.

520
00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.030
So uh in the subtitle of the book, you

521
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:13.989
refer to food, sex and politics. So why those

522
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.109
three things specifically? Why do you focus on those

523
00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:21.089
33 different things?

524
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.689
Yes. So uh yeah. So pursuing food, sex and

525
00:31:24.699 --> 00:31:27.839
politics and by politics, what I mean is negotiating

526
00:31:27.849 --> 00:31:31.359
and maintaining power, alliances within and across social groups.

527
00:31:31.369 --> 00:31:33.319
OK. And so these are the three things that

528
00:31:33.329 --> 00:31:37.140
are essential for survival without success in these areas.

529
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.339
We do not survive as a species. And so

530
00:31:40.349 --> 00:31:43.560
the subtitle actually that I began with was different

531
00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:47.689
the subtitle was originally, uh, you know, uh, model

532
00:31:47.699 --> 00:31:50.699
of tethered rationality for real world behavior or something.

533
00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:55.109
However, when I completed the book, it occurred to

534
00:31:55.119 --> 00:31:57.130
me and this, I wasn't aware of this as

535
00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.900
I was writing it, it occurred to me that

536
00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.300
most of my examples were about food, sex and

537
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:06.329
politics. The illustrations that I used to, uh, uh,

538
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.410
in the book. And I think what's going on

539
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.979
here is that while tethering is apparent in all

540
00:32:12.989 --> 00:32:16.380
behaviors and for example, think back to the uh

541
00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.880
uh uh parole judges, example, uh it comes through

542
00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:24.089
particularly strongly in adaptive behaviors. So it's easy to

543
00:32:24.099 --> 00:32:28.239
recognize the tethering in adaptive behaviors that is behaviors

544
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:31.479
uh uh uh pursuing food sex and politics. So

545
00:32:31.489 --> 00:32:34.119
that's the uh the, the, the reason uh for

546
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.839
the subtitle.

547
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:39.569
Mhm A and uh going back to a little

548
00:32:39.579 --> 00:32:43.609
bit to the froth mind. So we've already talked

549
00:32:43.619 --> 00:32:50.140
about the hierarchy of evolved behaviors, autonomic, instinctive associative

550
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:54.260
and reasoning behaviors. So, could you tell us about

551
00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:58.420
how the taro mind uh develops? Exactly.

552
00:32:59.069 --> 00:33:03.479
Mhm. So I think it's just a natural by-product

553
00:33:03.489 --> 00:33:07.359
of brain evolution. Mhm So what, what I mean

554
00:33:07.369 --> 00:33:10.109
by this is uh if we look at uh

555
00:33:10.119 --> 00:33:15.550
the uh how brains evolve. So, vertebrate brains consist

556
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:20.140
of a spinal cord brain stem, diencephalon, subcortical structures

557
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:24.310
and a cortex. And what's interesting is that at

558
00:33:24.319 --> 00:33:27.930
every branch of the phylogenetic tree, certain of these

559
00:33:27.939 --> 00:33:31.569
brain structures are conserved while others are added, modified

560
00:33:31.579 --> 00:33:36.800
and expanded new directions. And what's interesting is that

561
00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:40.290
there are also behaviors that are preserved at certain

562
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.859
branching points while others are added modified and expanded.

563
00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.729
And so I, I think there is this correspondence

564
00:33:47.739 --> 00:33:51.099
between anatomy and behavior I don't think is an

565
00:33:51.109 --> 00:33:55.839
accident. Harly organized behaviors are underwritten by Harly organized

566
00:33:55.849 --> 00:34:01.699
brain structures. Uh So for example, if we look

567
00:34:01.709 --> 00:34:05.209
at um uh I, I mean, it need not

568
00:34:05.219 --> 00:34:07.050
be a human, could be uh any mammal brain.

569
00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:11.938
So, brain stem uh uh autonomic systems, uh uh

570
00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:16.010
pathways for conducting sensory information, including pain and pleasure,

571
00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:20.540
uh diencephalon, major real uh relay center for sensory

572
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:26.100
information. Uh ALSO uh uh sort of homeostatic functions

573
00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.580
uh and essential survival functions. Uh SURVIVAL behaviors are

574
00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:34.708
controlled in the hypothalamus. Um uh Subcortical structures, instinctive

575
00:34:34.717 --> 00:34:39.398
behaviors are uh controlled there. The hippocampus lays down

576
00:34:39.408 --> 00:34:42.849
associated memories and then in terms of cerebral cortex,

577
00:34:43.089 --> 00:34:46.839
uh we associate that with higher level uh functions.

578
00:34:47.009 --> 00:34:49.408
And so the idea is that these are being

579
00:34:49.418 --> 00:34:54.879
added, uh you know, these additional behaviors are being

580
00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:57.550
added along with these structures. And when I say

581
00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.360
hierarchy, you know, think about this, the uh there

582
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:06.479
was no uh uh organism that we know of

583
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:10.530
that has a cortex but no subcortical structures, right?

584
00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.310
They uh they do appear in this particular hierarchy

585
00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:16.110
and there's these behaviors associated with them. So that's

586
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.090
my sort of point. But the other thing and

587
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.439
uh we recognize this uh certainly when we're talking

588
00:35:22.449 --> 00:35:25.270
about physiology, but we forget it when we're talking

589
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:29.520
about reasoning is that um all of these systems,

590
00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.129
uh I mean, I do describe them as these

591
00:35:31.139 --> 00:35:36.550
distinct systems. Uh They are uh tethered physically, uh

592
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.879
you know, connected to each other and they interact

593
00:35:38.889 --> 00:35:43.010
with each other. So even something simple as uh

594
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.580
wiggling my little finger, it involves all of these

595
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:50.530
systems. So, cerebral cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem

596
00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.239
spinal cord, you know, uh and so forth. Uh

597
00:35:53.889 --> 00:35:56.310
So this is the sort of the, the idea

598
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.330
of the tethered mind that we've got sort of

599
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:03.209
these brain structures from brain stem diencephalon, subcortical structure,

600
00:36:03.479 --> 00:36:07.199
uh cortex. And we can even sort of talk

601
00:36:07.209 --> 00:36:11.479
about them as having different neuronal properties. Um YOU

602
00:36:11.489 --> 00:36:14.350
know, colloquially, we, these are not good terms, but

603
00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.520
we use the terms hardwired and soft wired. And

604
00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.060
then we there's a mapping of these different brain

605
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.639
structures onto the different systems that I, you know,

606
00:36:23.649 --> 00:36:27.790
that I talk about uh autonomic systems, uh instinctive

607
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.100
systems, associative and reasoning. And then there is this

608
00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:36.820
issue of uh interacting with the organism interacting with

609
00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:39.250
the world. So the world is impinging upon all

610
00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.649
of these systems, but it's not, but the organism

611
00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:45.409
is not giving four different response. There's got to

612
00:36:45.419 --> 00:36:49.020
be some sort of integration function that uh takes

613
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.739
the uh so as the organi as these different

614
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:55.629
systems are responding to the environment, uh they're generating

615
00:36:55.639 --> 00:36:58.169
certain responses there is some sort of integration function

616
00:36:58.179 --> 00:37:01.010
that takes these and then generates a sort of

617
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.709
a blended response uh uh to them. So I

618
00:37:04.719 --> 00:37:08.060
think this is how at the sort of developmental

619
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:13.540
uh uh uh uh how the um um the,

620
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.090
the, the tethered rationality comes about the, the tethered

621
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.379
brain comes about

622
00:37:19.919 --> 00:37:24.669
and what are feelings exactly? And what role do

623
00:37:24.679 --> 00:37:27.229
they play in this framework?

624
00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.870
OK. Yeah. So in the book, I emphasize feelings,

625
00:37:31.879 --> 00:37:33.399
I talk a great deal about feelings. They play

626
00:37:33.409 --> 00:37:37.090
a central role for me rather than emotions. So

627
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.649
feelings span the range of sensations from the kink

628
00:37:40.659 --> 00:37:42.949
in my neck, the warmth of sunshine on my

629
00:37:42.959 --> 00:37:47.489
face, hunger, pangs, taste of chocolate cake, sexual arousal,

630
00:37:47.649 --> 00:37:50.790
and pangs of jealousy and anger, which are emotional

631
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.070
states. OK? So the idea is feelings are not

632
00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.689
emotions though emotional states have feelings. So it's a

633
00:37:57.699 --> 00:38:02.050
very, so feelings refer to the affective component of

634
00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:06.250
um Ooo of mental states. And for me, they

635
00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:12.070
play a central role because uh iii I think

636
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:16.129
that uh I'm claiming that feelings act as antecedents

637
00:38:16.139 --> 00:38:20.610
to behavioral outcomes. So many people will argue that

638
00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.320
feelings are just Ehe nomen. I I am I'm

639
00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:26.159
giving you a very different kind of argument I'm

640
00:38:26.169 --> 00:38:29.020
seeing. For example, hunger pangs initiate food finding and

641
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:32.199
eating behavior in me. The burning sensation in my

642
00:38:32.209 --> 00:38:34.409
hand causes me to withdraw it from a flame.

643
00:38:34.719 --> 00:38:37.969
Without the hunger pains or burning sensation. The behavior

644
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:43.360
uh would not uh a a occur. And so

645
00:38:44.429 --> 00:38:47.850
the, the role that feelings are playing is that

646
00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:53.889
they are uh uh the lingua franca uh of

647
00:38:53.899 --> 00:38:58.100
uh these various systems. And uh they're, they're absolutely

648
00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:03.209
critical in uh generating the blended response. And the

649
00:39:03.219 --> 00:39:06.610
reason I uh iiiii I think this is the

650
00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:11.459
case is that feelings are generated in sort of

651
00:39:11.469 --> 00:39:14.939
brains stemmed, encephalon, subcortical structures. If they were not,

652
00:39:14.949 --> 00:39:17.459
if they were generated in the cortex, then I

653
00:39:17.469 --> 00:39:22.330
couldn't tell the story. But uh these uh the

654
00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:26.260
brainstem encephalon, they've appear very early and they've been

655
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:30.649
conserved certainly in mammals and perhaps all vertebrates. And

656
00:39:30.659 --> 00:39:34.229
so they're available widely, you know, along the phylogenetic

657
00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:36.550
tree. And if you look at a mouse brain

658
00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:40.689
and a human brain and you identify these systems

659
00:39:40.699 --> 00:39:43.209
in the mouse brain, they're the same areas in

660
00:39:43.219 --> 00:39:47.139
the human brain. If you stimulate a particular uh

661
00:39:47.149 --> 00:39:49.860
you know, the system in a mouse brain, for

662
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:53.530
example, the septal nucleus or something, uh It was

663
00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.280
a septal nucleus, the mouse likes it wants to

664
00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:59.219
do it again. If this is done in humans,

665
00:39:59.229 --> 00:40:02.540
obviously for clinical reasons, rather than an experiment situation,

666
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.320
the human likes it. And he can describe to

667
00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:08.300
you uh uh wwwww what? Um uh III I

668
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:12.360
it feels like. So because of this, you know,

669
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:16.530
this type that there's uh uh there's no knockdown

670
00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.030
argument for the causal efficacy of feelings, but there's

671
00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:26.500
evidence uh from the neuroscience literature for their causal

672
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:32.239
role such things as um uh so as I've

673
00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:35.159
already said, feelings are generating brain stem structures. Um

674
00:40:35.879 --> 00:40:39.330
uh When feeling circuits are artificially stimulated, the animal

675
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:42.439
will work to maintain the stimulation. So you can

676
00:40:42.449 --> 00:40:46.570
use that stimulation uh as a reward to condition

677
00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.649
the animal's behavior. Just like you would use food.

678
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.290
The animals will develop place preference or aversion. As

679
00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:57.070
a result of stimulation, animals will work harder, run

680
00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:01.020
faster, the more pleasurable they find the stimulation. And

681
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:05.969
so uh nature is not prodigal yet, feeling circuits

682
00:41:05.979 --> 00:41:09.090
have been preserved despite the heavy metabolic cost. So

683
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.510
there must be some adaptive function. And I argue

684
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.570
in the book that uh what the function is

685
00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.780
feeling our evolution solution, uh They're the proximal mechanism

686
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:21.439
that we use evolution is used for selecting and

687
00:41:21.449 --> 00:41:25.649
initiating uh actions. So, in that sense, they're caly

688
00:41:25.659 --> 00:41:28.780
efficacious and I can walk through an example if

689
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:30.030
you like or um

690
00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:33.090
yeah, let me just ask you one particular kind

691
00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:38.350
of question about feelings because feelings, if I understand

692
00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.489
it correctly have a conscious component to them. Yes.

693
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.229
Right. It has to do with what we actually

694
00:41:46.239 --> 00:41:52.929
phenomenological, let's say experience the things we report experiencing

695
00:41:52.939 --> 00:41:57.850
consciously. So uh when you say that feelings have

696
00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:03.949
the causal power, are you also implying that uh

697
00:42:03.959 --> 00:42:10.149
consciousness as causal power as well or not?

698
00:42:10.409 --> 00:42:13.070
OK. So that's a good question. And it's a

699
00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.810
question that I go to great lengths to avoid.

700
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.919
In the book, the Uh OK, thank you. The

701
00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:24.300
Y Yeah, I mean, you're right to note that

702
00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:28.639
this is exactly where this is going. And uh

703
00:42:28.649 --> 00:42:32.860
but delving into the consciousness literature, I sort of,

704
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:35.330
I, I realized it would be a rabbit hole

705
00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.149
that I could never get out of. And so

706
00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:42.429
I give a very sort of functional definition uh

707
00:42:42.439 --> 00:42:44.790
oo of feelings. I used it in the same

708
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.030
sense that uh neuroscientists working with animal models uh

709
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.620
uh uh use it. So the uh and maybe

710
00:42:53.629 --> 00:42:58.310
this can be illustrated in this example that uh

711
00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.770
uh uh that I've been uh uh giving. So,

712
00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:05.189
you know, how do we determine uh what to

713
00:43:05.199 --> 00:43:10.540
eat? And uh yeah. So the um uh you

714
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:15.659
know, our energy management choices uh well, the so

715
00:43:15.669 --> 00:43:18.139
to manage our food reserves, the two things we

716
00:43:18.149 --> 00:43:20.580
have to select what to eat and when to

717
00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:25.179
eat, right? So, feelings of reward that is wanting

718
00:43:25.189 --> 00:43:28.810
and liking in a version discussed serve as intervening

719
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.459
variables between stimulus and response. That's what I'm saying.

720
00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:36.239
So sweetness signals, fast releasing carbohydrate energy sources, motivates

721
00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:39.840
consumption. Uh THE taste and texture of fat signals

722
00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:43.709
high energy density, uh high density energy sources and

723
00:43:43.719 --> 00:43:47.770
also motivates consumption. But bitterness signals the presence of

724
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.229
noxious toxins and poisons and inhibits uh we uh

725
00:43:51.239 --> 00:43:54.250
consumption, we avoid it. So in it's in this

726
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.510
sense, the taste is the sort of interface and

727
00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.399
guardian between the external environment of potential foods and

728
00:44:00.409 --> 00:44:03.860
our internal bodily environment. And the second half of

729
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:07.629
it is the um uh is, is, is the

730
00:44:07.639 --> 00:44:13.120
idea that um um so this is why I

731
00:44:13.129 --> 00:44:16.810
choose to eat chocolate cake and not bitter. Uh

732
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:21.399
Something is bitter but why should I bother? Why

733
00:44:21.409 --> 00:44:24.189
should I make the effort to eat? Right. Um

734
00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.399
Well, there's a homeostatic signal system that signals this

735
00:44:27.409 --> 00:44:31.120
time to eat by generating hunger, pangs, restless, unpleasant

736
00:44:31.129 --> 00:44:33.580
agitating feelings which, you know, you want to get

737
00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:37.879
rid of. And so these feelings are drivers, motivators

738
00:44:37.889 --> 00:44:42.469
inhibitors, they activate certain action tendencies which result in

739
00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:47.449
uh me uh undertaking the actions to procure and

740
00:44:47.459 --> 00:44:49.189
uh you know, food and eat it. Uh So

741
00:44:49.199 --> 00:44:53.350
it's in this sort of very uh basic sense

742
00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.250
that I'm claiming that they're uh uh caly efficacious,

743
00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.679
I understand. And so another question that you explore

744
00:45:00.689 --> 00:45:04.949
in the book is whether there's a control structure

745
00:45:04.959 --> 00:45:09.820
for tatro rationality. So uh is there actually a

746
00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:13.719
control structure for it? And what does a control

747
00:45:13.729 --> 00:45:16.899
structure mean specific? OK. In that case?

748
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:20.590
OK. Before I talk about the control structure, um

749
00:45:20.669 --> 00:45:23.669
if you can let me make a couple of

750
00:45:23.679 --> 00:45:25.909
more points here, uh then it will make more

751
00:45:25.919 --> 00:45:29.800
sense to uh talk about the control structure. So

752
00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:35.489
I, I've been talking about feelings and uh and

753
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.479
when I look at the uh sort of 100

754
00:45:37.489 --> 00:45:40.679
years research in autonomic systems, instinctive systems and social

755
00:45:40.689 --> 00:45:45.050
systems, the message seems to be that to, to

756
00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:49.989
model uh these systems, uh you need a notion

757
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.070
of feelings, we have feelings of a causal uh

758
00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:58.610
uh uh uh efficacy. The A a and again,

759
00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.239
this is not an uncontroversial claim. You will find

760
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:04.620
many people argue exactly the opposite. But uh uh

761
00:46:04.629 --> 00:46:08.429
I think there is evidence for even the behaviorist

762
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:11.659
who, you know, spent their, you know, their whole

763
00:46:11.669 --> 00:46:16.409
lives uh uh avoiding any talk of uh mental

764
00:46:16.419 --> 00:46:20.399
states. Even they cannot explain reinforcement in a non

765
00:46:20.409 --> 00:46:23.550
circular way without having the animal distinguish positive and

766
00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.330
negative balance and prefer the positive to the negative.

767
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:32.610
Uh OK. So what I'm noticing is that feelings

768
00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:36.580
are this common sort of currency across these systems.

769
00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.659
But when we talked about reason earlier, we never

770
00:46:40.669 --> 00:46:43.649
talked about feelings, right? When we reason, you know,

771
00:46:43.659 --> 00:46:46.689
a again, like just like emotions and reason are,

772
00:46:46.699 --> 00:46:50.030
are apart, feelings and emo reason are even further

773
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:53.520
apart. And one of the things sort of the

774
00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:56.639
sort of the controversial move that I make, I

775
00:46:56.649 --> 00:47:00.139
mean, arguing that uh uh feelings or classifications is

776
00:47:00.149 --> 00:47:02.959
a controversial move. That's my first controversial move. The

777
00:47:02.969 --> 00:47:06.409
second controversial move is to argue that reasoning is

778
00:47:06.419 --> 00:47:11.159
also about feelings. OK. So this is a very

779
00:47:11.169 --> 00:47:15.439
different way of looking at reasoning. And the um

780
00:47:16.739 --> 00:47:19.840
and so the idea here is so reasoning, the

781
00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:23.830
model had three components, desires, beliefs and coherence relations.

782
00:47:24.679 --> 00:47:27.860
Uh And I argue that each of these components

783
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:32.659
uh um have are about feeling. So uh for

784
00:47:32.669 --> 00:47:36.449
example, desires are just cognitive versions of these, you

785
00:47:36.459 --> 00:47:40.780
know, the uh wanting and seeking systems that the

786
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:44.469
uh neuroscientists who study uh animal models study, you

787
00:47:44.479 --> 00:47:49.280
know, like Burbridge Kendle Bach, um pe uh they're

788
00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:53.260
just cognitive versions, they just, they, they propositional attitudes,

789
00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.320
uh beliefs. I think one can make the same

790
00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:58.620
argument for. And I think John Searle's Chinese room

791
00:47:58.629 --> 00:48:02.899
argument uh takes us in that direction but also

792
00:48:02.909 --> 00:48:07.969
coherence. And I argue that all logical intuitions come

793
00:48:07.979 --> 00:48:12.360
down to a feeling of rightness and coherency feels

794
00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:17.060
right, positive violence in coherency or inconsistency feels wrong.

795
00:48:17.479 --> 00:48:20.100
And let me give you a um example to

796
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:24.629
illustrate that. Uh SO suppose I give you a

797
00:48:24.639 --> 00:48:30.340
uh uh the following proposition, either Socrates is mortal

798
00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:32.340
or it's not the case that Socrates is mortal.

799
00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:35.439
And I ask you, is it true or false?

800
00:48:35.449 --> 00:48:39.100
Well, you will say that it's true. But if

801
00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:41.000
I don't see it, if I can't see the

802
00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:43.679
truth of it, so I don't accept it. I

803
00:48:43.689 --> 00:48:45.639
said, well, can you prove it to me that

804
00:48:45.649 --> 00:48:48.929
it's true? Well, sure, you can uh in classical

805
00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:52.330
logic, you uh bring out the uh principle of

806
00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.489
the excluded middle and say, look, this is why

807
00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:58.399
it's true. But if I don't understand the principle

808
00:48:58.409 --> 00:49:01.330
of the excluded middle, if I refuse to accept

809
00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.669
it as you can, you prove that to me

810
00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.060
what you do, there is no further proof. The

811
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:11.179
principle is meant to be self evident it's accepted

812
00:49:11.189 --> 00:49:15.020
because it feels right. Right. And so it's in

813
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:18.520
this sense, I also want to ground my model

814
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:22.729
of reasoning of rationality in these feelings of rightness.

815
00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.510
And why should it feel right? Uh uh In

816
00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:29.340
coherency feels wrong, why? Well, for the same reason,

817
00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:33.889
as in the case of the taste, um, the

818
00:49:33.899 --> 00:49:39.260
feeling is fitness, enhancing, coherency feels good because representations

819
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:43.260
that are internally consistent and veridical will enhance survival

820
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.260
and coherence is unpleasant because it can be harmful.

821
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:50.800
So, so then, uh so I've got this, uh

822
00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:55.780
uh now this model with the different components and

823
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:58.620
uh and a common currency. And again, this is

824
00:49:58.629 --> 00:50:03.040
a very controversial move. Um But it's when I

825
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:06.620
present this uh to my uh colleagues uh in

826
00:50:06.629 --> 00:50:12.399
the reasoning world. Um uh I discussed it with,

827
00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:15.429
with a number of them and uh they're intrigued,

828
00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:18.330
you know, this is interesting that they're intrigued. Uh

829
00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:21.939
uh uh uh IT'S not, I'm not saying they're

830
00:50:21.949 --> 00:50:25.080
sold but they're intrigued by it. So there's something

831
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:28.469
there, I think. So from here, then we can

832
00:50:28.479 --> 00:50:30.469
go to the, the, the question you asked about

833
00:50:30.479 --> 00:50:34.010
control structures. So who's in charge of the tethered

834
00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:39.179
mind? Now, what's interesting here or important here? And

835
00:50:39.189 --> 00:50:41.399
this is my third controversial move. There is no

836
00:50:41.409 --> 00:50:44.709
central executive, there's no one on top sitting uh

837
00:50:44.719 --> 00:50:47.989
and saying, OK, no, this system should uh have

838
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.489
activated, this system should have precedent or this. No,

839
00:50:51.929 --> 00:50:54.830
it's not a deal. Mechanism account. And in fact,

840
00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:58.919
I go back to the 18 fifties and pull

841
00:50:58.929 --> 00:51:02.949
out an idea from uh Jeremy Bentham, uh Bentham,

842
00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:06.879
uh you know, was a utilitarian philosopher. You will

843
00:51:06.889 --> 00:51:11.770
recall. And he said that nature has placed mankind

844
00:51:12.139 --> 00:51:15.330
under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and

845
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:19.330
pleasure. And so this is my control structure. So

846
00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:25.060
my idea is that um the system is set

847
00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:28.820
up to maximize pleasure and minimize pain or displeasure.

848
00:51:28.889 --> 00:51:32.139
There's no executive function, uh no executive in charge,

849
00:51:32.479 --> 00:51:37.100
the selected behavior will be a blended response based

850
00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:39.060
on the output of some or all of the

851
00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:43.020
systems. Uh REASONING system has an input into the

852
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:48.500
response. But so do the other systems. And we

853
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:51.280
can, on this type of model, we can explain

854
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:56.010
individual differences in behavior in terms of individual differences

855
00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:59.810
at the level of reasoning, but also individual differences

856
00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.979
at the level of instinctive and associative. And we

857
00:52:02.989 --> 00:52:06.709
can think of this utility function that uh uh

858
00:52:06.729 --> 00:52:08.719
uh takes in the input from the different uh

859
00:52:08.729 --> 00:52:12.120
modules uh uh the different systems and generates a

860
00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:17.199
blended response as the kind of utility function postulated

861
00:52:17.209 --> 00:52:19.800
again by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill about

862
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:24.719
100 50 175 years ago. I it was a

863
00:52:24.729 --> 00:52:28.540
measure of pleasure or satisfaction. And I think uh

864
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:30.439
I mean, it's been taken in a very different

865
00:52:30.449 --> 00:52:34.050
direction by modern economists. And I take exception with

866
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:40.780
their um uh uh you know, with their uh

867
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:45.010
development of it. III I think uh Jeremy Bentham

868
00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:47.320
and John Stuart Mill were on to something. And

869
00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:50.860
so they were proposing uh this type of uh

870
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:53.560
model as a normative model in terms of how

871
00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:57.179
we should uh make decisions. I am proposing it

872
00:52:57.189 --> 00:52:59.379
as a descriptive model is how the system is

873
00:52:59.389 --> 00:53:01.810
actually organized, what the architecture is,

874
00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:06.139
right? So getting into the last part of our

875
00:53:06.149 --> 00:53:10.110
conversation, I would like to understand a little bit

876
00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:14.040
more about the what are pro probably the main

877
00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:19.870
implications of the sta through mind framework. And uh

878
00:53:19.989 --> 00:53:24.760
I mean, one specific question is, and you mentioned

879
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:28.909
this when earlier in our conversation, you talked or

880
00:53:28.919 --> 00:53:33.899
gave some examples in the realm of politics, particularly

881
00:53:33.909 --> 00:53:38.600
when you mentioned uh why certain people for from

882
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:42.570
certain political ideologies, find it so hard to believe

883
00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:47.050
that climate change is real, for example. So why

884
00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:51.469
is it so hard to change certain beliefs? And

885
00:53:51.479 --> 00:53:56.889
basically what are the constraints on belief revision?

886
00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:01.389
OK. OK. Yeah. So this is a uh uh

887
00:54:01.399 --> 00:54:04.870
very uh very good question and it's a question

888
00:54:05.429 --> 00:54:07.479
that we as a field as a discipline uh

889
00:54:07.489 --> 00:54:12.419
struggle with. So because the whole the part of

890
00:54:12.429 --> 00:54:16.620
the definition of beliefs is that it's changeable, it

891
00:54:16.629 --> 00:54:18.830
can be revised, right? I if something can be

892
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:21.510
right, technically, it's not a belief. So it's problematic.

893
00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:25.449
Um So the, the answer to this question from

894
00:54:25.459 --> 00:54:30.260
the tethered rationality account is the pleasure derived from

895
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:35.129
maintaining coherence of beliefs is overridden or overpowered by

896
00:54:35.139 --> 00:54:38.250
the pleasure derived from exercising some non cognitive system.

897
00:54:38.739 --> 00:54:40.820
That's sort of the answer. And I can illustrate

898
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:43.610
this answer for you with an example. Uh uh

899
00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:46.850
WE can use uh vaccine hesitancy as an example

900
00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:50.780
because it was um uh I mean, this was

901
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:53.580
the issue that was uh raised earlier when I

902
00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:58.110
quoted uh uh Francis Collins at the beginning. And

903
00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.489
so here, what the issue is, millions of people

904
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.250
refuse to get a vaccine in the midst of

905
00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:06.050
a pandemic. Now, if we're dealing with the untethered

906
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:08.429
rational mind, that is just a purely rational mind.

907
00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:12.330
How do you change this behavior? You change beliefs

908
00:55:12.719 --> 00:55:15.379
and how do you change beliefs? You educate people,

909
00:55:15.389 --> 00:55:18.399
you provide people with more informative, you know, uh

910
00:55:18.699 --> 00:55:23.010
uh accurate, scientifically valid information, but it didn't work

911
00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:25.379
for one third of Americans and I'm sure it

912
00:55:25.389 --> 00:55:26.820
didn't work for one third of people from a

913
00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:29.800
any different countries. Nothing to do with Americans. Um

914
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:33.060
And so what's going on here? How do we

915
00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:35.419
explain this? What is, you know, does the reasoning

916
00:55:35.429 --> 00:55:37.600
mind have a role here or if so, what

917
00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:40.770
is it? Well, how do I arrive at the

918
00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.770
conclusion that vaccination is the rational choice in the

919
00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:47.310
midst of a pandemic? Well, unless I'm a specialist

920
00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.899
in vaccines and viruses, all I can do is

921
00:55:49.909 --> 00:55:52.939
follow the advice of the specialist. So I think

922
00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:55.600
the the reasoning task here for me is to

923
00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:58.840
determine who to believe about vaccine safety and efficacy.

924
00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:02.080
Do I believe the Entertainers reading scripts on TV?

925
00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:05.520
Uh What I find on the internet, my next

926
00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:07.810
door neighbor who had a very strong opinion about

927
00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:11.929
it, or the specialist at the CDC, um who

928
00:56:11.939 --> 00:56:15.689
spent their lives studying viruses and vaccines. And this

929
00:56:15.699 --> 00:56:18.520
is an appropriate question for the reasoning mind, but

930
00:56:18.699 --> 00:56:21.590
the untethered reasoning mind is a myth, you know,

931
00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.419
is what I argue um uh here and in

932
00:56:24.429 --> 00:56:28.350
the book, uh and so there are some other

933
00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:31.639
non cognitive processes that work here and the non

934
00:56:31.659 --> 00:56:34.010
cognitive processes that work here. It's an instinct, it's

935
00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:37.510
the in group out group instinct. And so let

936
00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.689
me take a minute to talk about uh in

937
00:56:40.699 --> 00:56:42.439
group out group instincts and I'll come back and

938
00:56:42.449 --> 00:56:44.709
then show you how they fit into the explanation.

939
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:49.239
So we all accept the uh the the in

940
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.879
group out for uh group phenomenon. The in group

941
00:56:51.889 --> 00:56:54.189
is good and safe, the out group is evil

942
00:56:54.199 --> 00:56:59.399
and dangerous. Now, I uh most uh social scientists

943
00:56:59.409 --> 00:57:01.610
want to say that this is a social construction.

944
00:57:01.879 --> 00:57:04.300
I make the case that in group out group

945
00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:06.600
formation is an instinct based on the five, you

946
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:11.610
know, questions we went through earlier. And uh I

947
00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:14.149
think about it like this, think about it like

948
00:57:14.159 --> 00:57:18.969
imprinting in certain words, uh like geese, uh goslings

949
00:57:18.979 --> 00:57:22.280
will uh uh imprint upon the first moving object

950
00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:24.750
that they see as their mother and follow it.

951
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:28.550
Uh So the imprinting is instinctual, but what is

952
00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:31.340
imprinted upon is an accidental feature of the environment.

953
00:57:31.649 --> 00:57:35.270
Similarly, in, in group out group formation, the in

954
00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.889
uh that's an instinct. But the group membership, the

955
00:57:38.899 --> 00:57:40.250
group that you act, you know, the groups you

956
00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:45.929
belong to is environmentally socially part of uh uh

957
00:57:45.939 --> 00:57:49.330
instincts that I want to emphasize here. I already

958
00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:52.290
mentioned earlier when we talked about instincts, but is

959
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:56.800
the fact that they're compulsive, they're not uh reflex

960
00:57:56.810 --> 00:57:59.830
arc or robot like. And by being compulsive, it

961
00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:04.879
means that they contain an element of um um

962
00:58:04.889 --> 00:58:09.260
appetite or aversion. And so an appetite is a

963
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:14.850
uh uh is a state of uh of agitation

964
00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:18.790
uh in the absence of a certain stimuli. So

965
00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.370
if you uh hunger pangs in the absence of

966
00:58:21.379 --> 00:58:24.209
food or craving for group membership and you know,

967
00:58:24.379 --> 00:58:27.610
and then receiving the stimuli, food or membership is

968
00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:32.040
consummatory or very pleasurable uh and relieve the agitation

969
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:35.479
and returns the animal to rest. An aversion is

970
00:58:35.489 --> 00:58:38.149
a state of agitation resulting from the presence of

971
00:58:38.159 --> 00:58:40.899
a certain stimulus. So a spider, in the case

972
00:58:40.909 --> 00:58:43.530
of my daughter will do a threat presented by

973
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:47.040
the out group and I it ceases when the

974
00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:51.350
stimulus is withdrawn uh or destroyed. And so group

975
00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:55.260
membership contains both uh appetitive state and aversion. So

976
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:58.010
there is two sources of pleasure and this is

977
00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:03.429
absolutely critical to understand because the um it explains

978
00:59:03.439 --> 00:59:06.439
both the compulsiveness of group formation and the pleasure

979
00:59:06.449 --> 00:59:08.820
derived from belonging to the in group. And this

980
00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:12.760
is the scary part, even the greater pleasure derived

981
00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:16.270
from hating the out group. Uh THERE'S very interesting

982
00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:19.679
uh developmental data that points to this. So once

983
00:59:19.689 --> 00:59:22.310
you have this background, then and you've got the

984
00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:26.110
tethered rationality model, the explanation, uh why we don't,

985
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:29.000
the beliefs can't be revised as the following. So

986
00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:31.850
if scientists belong to the in group, then the

987
00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:35.590
instincts push us in the same direction as reason

988
00:59:35.919 --> 00:59:38.889
and enhance the pleasure satisfaction associated with the rational

989
00:59:38.899 --> 00:59:43.129
response. If those scientists belong to the out group,

990
00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:46.879
the instinct pushes us in the opposite direction from

991
00:59:46.889 --> 00:59:50.040
the uh uh coherence relation, they're evil and trying

992
00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:52.459
to deceive and harm us. And if the pleasure

993
00:59:52.469 --> 00:59:55.620
we derive from exercising the instinct that is uh

994
00:59:55.709 --> 00:59:58.639
the hostility of the out group is greater than

995
00:59:58.649 --> 01:00:01.340
we derive from the rational choice, then we will

996
01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:04.959
be among the vaccine hesitant. And if in addition,

997
01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:07.629
the reasoning mind is used against us on top

998
01:00:07.639 --> 01:00:10.030
of that to sow doubt on the motives of

999
01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:13.550
the experts to accentuate group differences. For example, they

1000
01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.080
don't tell you how many people have died from

1001
01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:18.429
the vaccine, do they? It will be even more

1002
01:00:18.439 --> 01:00:22.010
difficult to overcome the instinctual bias and any information

1003
01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:24.790
to the contrary, no matter how clear or factual

1004
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.149
will be less effective because it's pushing in the

1005
01:00:27.159 --> 01:00:30.699
opposite direction to the instinct. And so here on

1006
01:00:30.709 --> 01:00:35.229
this account, the same mechanisms and procedures are in

1007
01:00:35.239 --> 01:00:38.840
play in both the vaccinated and the vaccine hesitant.

1008
01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:42.550
The only difference is group membership. And, you know,

1009
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.040
and so you don't have to postulate that they're

1010
01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:48.110
irrational or, you know, that there's some other uh

1011
01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:53.169
deficit. No, it's the same. Um, um IIII I,

1012
01:00:53.179 --> 01:00:56.479
it just follows from the tethered model.

1013
01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:01.290
Mhm. But, uh, I mean, do you think that

1014
01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:08.100
there are space here for people actually, uh, just

1015
01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:12.360
for the sake of social signaling, claiming that they

1016
01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:16.679
believe, or they share particular beliefs with people that

1017
01:01:16.689 --> 01:01:20.540
are part of their group, but then do, uh,

1018
01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:26.489
not actually believing them and behaving in ways that

1019
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.530
go contrary to those beliefs? I mean, do you

1020
01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.070
think, basically what I'm asking you is if you

1021
01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:38.969
think there's space here for people to uh transmit

1022
01:01:38.979 --> 01:01:42.959
uh certain beliefs to others just to signal their

1023
01:01:42.969 --> 01:01:49.340
group membership but actually not uh believing that? Sure.

1024
01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:54.689
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. The, uh, think of, um, the,

1025
01:01:54.699 --> 01:01:56.699
uh, again, if you want to stick with the

1026
01:01:56.709 --> 01:02:01.409
vaccine example, think of, um, uh, some of the

1027
01:02:01.419 --> 01:02:06.580
commentators on TV, uh particularly American television, uh, you

1028
01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:10.399
know, they, uh, would spend, uh, you know, they

1029
01:02:10.409 --> 01:02:13.040
have an audience, their audience has, uh, uh uh,

1030
01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:16.629
you know, belongs to, uh sort of the, the

1031
01:02:16.739 --> 01:02:20.290
this and so what they're doing is they're playing

1032
01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:23.060
to the audience and they're using their rational mind

1033
01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:27.060
to say things that are consistent with the audience's

1034
01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:30.459
group membership though. They themselves may not believe that.

1035
01:02:30.469 --> 01:02:32.600
I mean, they're mostly vaccinated. It turns out they

1036
01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:35.820
were all vaccinated and to believe that, but because

1037
01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:39.389
uh the, the, the it was profitable for them

1038
01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:43.300
to actually feign that belief that they feigned it.

1039
01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:45.645
Um Yeah. Oh, no, that this happens a great

1040
01:02:45.655 --> 01:02:49.354
deal. The, the, the, the rational mind is there

1041
01:02:49.364 --> 01:02:52.165
and it can be utilized and uh and you

1042
01:02:52.175 --> 01:02:55.364
know, uh I, I it can send cues not

1043
01:02:55.375 --> 01:02:56.905
just to the rational mind but to all these

1044
01:02:56.915 --> 01:02:59.554
other systems. Um Yeah,

1045
01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:04.120
a and so my last question will be, and

1046
01:03:04.129 --> 01:03:07.419
this will probably be uh a sort of summary

1047
01:03:07.429 --> 01:03:10.820
of everything we've talked about here today. But we've

1048
01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:13.879
already, when I asked you about the implications, I

1049
01:03:13.889 --> 01:03:18.310
asked you specifically about why it's so hard sometimes

1050
01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.250
to change people's beliefs and constraints on belief revision.

1051
01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:25.449
But more generally, what would you say are the

1052
01:03:25.459 --> 01:03:30.889
main implications for uh how we understand human psychology

1053
01:03:30.899 --> 01:03:33.659
of the TEF root mind framework?

1054
01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:37.270
Well, I think there are some very, very significant

1055
01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.870
implications here and they, but they more have to

1056
01:03:39.879 --> 01:03:44.000
do with society social framework. There is a real

1057
01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:49.989
um uh a scary component to this sort of

1058
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.590
model. And the reason is what I'm saying here,

1059
01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.790
what this model is saying is you cannot arbitrarily

1060
01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.320
change any behavior by changing beliefs. Uh You know,

1061
01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:02.949
over a week in a sensitivity training, it doesn't

1062
01:04:02.959 --> 01:04:05.729
mean that you cannot change problematic behaviors at all.

1063
01:04:05.739 --> 01:04:07.879
But to do so, you have to have an

1064
01:04:07.889 --> 01:04:11.590
accurate model of the systems driving the behavior and

1065
01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:15.040
then target those systems. And such targeting may involve

1066
01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:19.169
uh belief, revision, but also associative uh conditioning, pharmaceutical

1067
01:04:19.179 --> 01:04:23.750
invention, maybe neuronal invention and so forth. But this

1068
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:35.070
idea, um um iii I it uh uh there's

1069
01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:39.850
an enormous fear surrounding this idea and, and I,

1070
01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:44.199
I can give you an example uh societal example,

1071
01:04:44.209 --> 01:04:47.040
sort of to illustrate that to sort of finish

1072
01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:51.139
off. But the uh but again, what we need

1073
01:04:51.149 --> 01:04:52.679
to do, I mean, in terms of this model

1074
01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:54.060
we're saying is we need to come to grips

1075
01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:56.020
with who and what we are as Homo Sapiens

1076
01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:59.500
and the, the critical but limited role that social

1077
01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:02.070
norms play in our behavior. So social norms are

1078
01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.979
important. Absolutely. But they're not everything. And I, I,

1079
01:05:06.989 --> 01:05:09.239
you know, I often discuss this with my students

1080
01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:13.370
by giving an example of stealing or cheating. OK.

1081
01:05:13.649 --> 01:05:16.969
So this is Homo Sapiens cheat. I mean, this

1082
01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:19.919
is a fundamental property of Homo Sapiens. There's a

1083
01:05:19.929 --> 01:05:25.030
very interesting literature on this. Now, you can imagine

1084
01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.780
two type types of societies in one type of

1085
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:31.379
society. Cheating. Yeah, you shouldn't do that. But there's

1086
01:05:31.389 --> 01:05:34.379
not any really severe penalties and well, maybe it's

1087
01:05:34.389 --> 01:05:37.370
OK to cheat or steal from someone that's really

1088
01:05:37.379 --> 01:05:39.600
wealthy because they probably stole it from someone else.

1089
01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:41.879
You know, you can rationalize this and so forth.

1090
01:05:41.889 --> 01:05:46.070
Imagine that society and imagine, uh, a society in

1091
01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.159
which if you cheat, I'm gonna cut off your

1092
01:05:48.169 --> 01:05:52.739
hand. So, in those two societies you're gonna have

1093
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:55.870
different levels of cheating and stealing. Right. In the

1094
01:05:55.879 --> 01:05:58.939
one, the first one, it might be maybe 75%

1095
01:05:58.949 --> 01:06:00.340
that people cheat. I, I don't know. I'm just

1096
01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:03.110
making up these numbers. In the second one, it

1097
01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:07.929
might be 25%. But in no society will, you

1098
01:06:07.939 --> 01:06:11.610
have 100% and 0%. And so this is what

1099
01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:15.560
I mean, that the, the social norms are important,

1100
01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:18.330
they, they sway us but they have, they're limited

1101
01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:22.530
also in that role. So let me uh finish

1102
01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:26.649
off um with, with an example, this is an

1103
01:06:26.659 --> 01:06:30.149
example. Uh AND it, it comes in again, why

1104
01:06:30.159 --> 01:06:33.659
we're so afraid of this type of model. So

1105
01:06:33.669 --> 01:06:38.300
this is an example that I took from uh

1106
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:43.250
uh from the Canadian. Uh uh uh So in,

1107
01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:48.899
in 2015, our armed forces were undertaking a program

1108
01:06:48.909 --> 01:06:52.139
review to eliminate sexual harassment in the military. Again,

1109
01:06:52.149 --> 01:06:54.159
this problem again, it's not a Canadian problem, Homo

1110
01:06:54.179 --> 01:06:57.340
Sapiens problem. And our top general at the time,

1111
01:06:57.350 --> 01:07:00.149
his name was Tom Lawson and he gave an

1112
01:07:00.159 --> 01:07:05.030
interview to the uh Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. And he

1113
01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.310
was asked during the interview by the uh look,

1114
01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:12.969
it's 2015, why is this still a problem? And

1115
01:07:14.409 --> 01:07:17.030
the general replied, well, look, you know, this is

1116
01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.360
a difficult problem. We have a zero tolerance policy.

1117
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:22.719
We are pursuing this, it disturbs the majority of,

1118
01:07:22.729 --> 01:07:26.050
you know, everyone in your form. And, um, he,

1119
01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.760
you know, he sort of said sort of the

1120
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:29.540
right. But then he said something else. But then

1121
01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:35.060
he said, but, you know, this is particularly difficult

1122
01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:38.520
because, you know, there's a biological component to this.

1123
01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:43.979
We're biologically wired in a certain way. And what

1124
01:07:43.989 --> 01:07:47.000
do you think happened as soon as he said

1125
01:07:47.010 --> 01:07:51.169
that? Now, what's interesting here is that if he'd

1126
01:07:51.179 --> 01:07:53.399
been talking about mice or monkeys, no one would

1127
01:07:53.409 --> 01:07:56.399
have uh a batted an eye because what he

1128
01:07:56.409 --> 01:08:02.899
said is scientifically correct. But as, but his acknowledgment

1129
01:08:02.909 --> 01:08:06.179
of it, that sexual attraction is biologically hardwired in

1130
01:08:06.189 --> 01:08:10.050
humans. It resulted in an enormous public uproar. Everyone

1131
01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.979
from the Prime Minister down, condemned him for his

1132
01:08:12.989 --> 01:08:16.640
Neanderthal knuckle dragging views and he would have been

1133
01:08:16.649 --> 01:08:19.270
fired on the spot if he was, he was

1134
01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:21.100
not due to retire in a couple of weeks.

1135
01:08:21.109 --> 01:08:23.259
So he was allowed to uh uh uh stay.

1136
01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:28.270
And what's interesting, this is an example that uh

1137
01:08:29.019 --> 01:08:31.769
stayed with me when I uh saw it and

1138
01:08:31.778 --> 01:08:34.298
I called up some of my evolutionary psychology colleagues

1139
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:36.877
and said, look what's going on here. This is

1140
01:08:36.889 --> 01:08:38.828
absolutely true. This is a, you know, you can't

1141
01:08:38.837 --> 01:08:44.349
seriously uh deny this uh in terms of the

1142
01:08:44.358 --> 01:08:48.809
science. Um And it's certainly consistent with the tethered

1143
01:08:48.818 --> 01:08:52.988
rationality model that I'm providing here. So he's not

1144
01:08:52.999 --> 01:08:55.188
saying that we're only driven by that, right? He's

1145
01:08:55.198 --> 01:08:58.269
saying it's one of the one ca component. Uh

1146
01:08:58.429 --> 01:09:00.889
BUT we also, you know, uh these other systems

1147
01:09:00.898 --> 01:09:02.707
that can, that should be able to modulate it

1148
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:10.009
and he's reaffirming the social acceptability of it, uh

1149
01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:14.698
zero tolerance and so forth. Well, so why the

1150
01:09:14.707 --> 01:09:18.238
universal condemn uh nation? And I think what's going

1151
01:09:18.249 --> 01:09:20.999
on here and this is why we're so afraid

1152
01:09:21.008 --> 01:09:23.769
of this type of model is that we all

1153
01:09:23.778 --> 01:09:27.389
believe that behavior that harms others must be punished

1154
01:09:27.398 --> 01:09:29.679
and prevented, right? So this is uh again, we

1155
01:09:29.688 --> 01:09:32.709
can all agree on that and our legal system

1156
01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.519
makes a tight connection between rationality and responsibility. OK.

1157
01:09:37.938 --> 01:09:41.198
The absence of rationality is an excusing condition for

1158
01:09:41.207 --> 01:09:46.120
responsibility. So if behavior that harms others is attributed

1159
01:09:46.129 --> 01:09:49.740
to the low level biological systems, we assume that

1160
01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:53.930
this explanation condones the behavior and prevents punishment of

1161
01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:57.450
the transgressor. And this is what leads us to

1162
01:09:57.459 --> 01:10:01.689
deny the science and common sense. And so how

1163
01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.899
do we deal with this? Do we just, you

1164
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:05.870
know, turn the other way and say, well, no,

1165
01:10:05.879 --> 01:10:08.270
this is not true when the science and common

1166
01:10:08.279 --> 01:10:10.700
sense says it is true. Well, I think, no,

1167
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:13.569
I don't think that's necessarily the view the position

1168
01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.759
that we need to take. Uh This is just

1169
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:18.509
a mistake. I think the most uh more productive

1170
01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:24.140
approach um is one to focus on prevention of

1171
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:29.689
bad behavior rather than retribution. Two decouple responsibility from

1172
01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:35.189
rationality and three realize that accepting a tethered mind

1173
01:10:35.759 --> 01:10:38.600
that is accepting the contribution of these evolutionary older

1174
01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:42.589
systems in our behavior as the norm allows us

1175
01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.080
to bring tools other than belief, revision to the

1176
01:10:45.089 --> 01:10:49.620
table. Uh TOOLS such as operant conditioning, pharmaceutical interventions,

1177
01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.839
maybe neuronal implants to change behavior. It, it broadens

1178
01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:56.319
our repertoire. It gives us a more uh uh

1179
01:10:56.330 --> 01:11:01.330
effective toolbox to deal with problematic behaviors. So that's

1180
01:11:01.339 --> 01:11:03.439
sort of my response. But this is the fear,

1181
01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:08.479
this is why um um uh uh a model

1182
01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:12.600
like this uh independent of any uh uh sort

1183
01:11:12.609 --> 01:11:16.100
of scientific evidence one way or the other uh

1184
01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.479
uh to get to for the social sciences or

1185
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:22.430
for society to accept it are these sort of

1186
01:11:22.439 --> 01:11:28.419
challenges? They're not um very significant social legal challenges.

1187
01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:29.509
Yeah. Mhm.

1188
01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.500
Great. So, let's send on that note then and

1189
01:11:33.509 --> 01:11:37.259
the book is again, reason and less pursuing food,

1190
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:40.220
sex and politics. I'm leaving a link to it

1191
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:43.410
in the description box of the interview and doctor

1192
01:11:43.419 --> 01:11:46.850
Goel just before we go apart from the book,

1193
01:11:46.859 --> 01:11:48.859
would you like to tell people where they can

1194
