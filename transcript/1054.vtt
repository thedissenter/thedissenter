00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.809
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.809 --> 00:00:05.849
Dis Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes

3
00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.890
and today I'm by Doctor Katherine Nave. She's a

4
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.529
level who trust early career research fellow at the

5
00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.890
University of Edinburgh. And today we're talking about her

6
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.280
book A Drive to Survive the Free Energy Principle

7
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.569
and the Meaning of Life. So, Doctor Nave, welcome

8
00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:23.090
to the show. It's a pleasure to

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.770
everyone. Thank you for having me. It's pleased to

10
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.090
be here.

11
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.379
So, uh, we're going to talk a lot about

12
00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:31.299
the free energy principle, but just before we get

13
00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:35.189
into that specific framework, in the book, you go

14
00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:39.360
through other sort of related approaches slash framework. So

15
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.430
could you start, uh, could you start by telling

16
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.630
us a little bit about an activism? What is

17
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.580
an activism?

18
00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.349
Sure, um, so an activism, I think the way

19
00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:53.909
it's sort of typically demarcated. I as an approach

20
00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.069
that kind of stems out of a book, The

21
00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:58.950
Embodied Mind that was written in 1991 um by

22
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.119
Francisco Varela and Thompson, um Evan Thompson, Eleanor Roche,

23
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.009
um. And the main kind of theme that comes

24
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.369
out of that book is the idea that when

25
00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.918
we're trying to understand cognition, we shouldn't be presuming

26
00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:16.768
that the sort of purpose of cognition is something

27
00:01:16.768 --> 00:01:22.478
like the voridical reconstruction of a mind independent world.

28
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.209
Which is how cognition is quite sort of I

29
00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:28.069
guess it's often called almost like the sort of

30
00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:31.599
traditional cognitivist view. Um, AND it's the kind of

31
00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:34.290
view, it goes along with traditional views and philosophy

32
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.870
around like truth and knowledge in terms of correspondence.

33
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.430
And so the idea of the embodied mind is

34
00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:42.459
that cognition is more about a kind of process

35
00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.239
of coping with the world, so it's about a

36
00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:49.410
process of skillful sensory motor coordination. Um, AND that's

37
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.290
a view that also has, it's quite continuous with

38
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.730
a lot of work in what's known as phenomenology,

39
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.319
um, particularly the philosopher Mario Ponti. The I think

40
00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.389
one very distinct feature of that as well, um,

41
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.760
is the idea of cognition as a sort of

42
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.220
biological phenomenon. Um, YOU know, it's something that develops

43
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.139
in living systems. And given that it's something that

44
00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.580
develops in living systems, that should maybe change how

45
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.860
we think about it, as opposed to if we

46
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.860
think about cognition as, you know, something, some sort

47
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.059
of algorithmic manipulations that a machine or a computer

48
00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.559
is doing. Um, AND I guess one other thing

49
00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.440
to say about an activism is, I think there's

50
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.759
a very broad use of it, where it's just

51
00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.800
something like, um, cognition is about the control of

52
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.000
action. Um, IT'S not first and foremost about representation.

53
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.119
It's often seen as a view that's defined by

54
00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:46.750
its anti-representationalism. Um, SO it's defined by the idea

55
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.360
that cognition is not involving of representations. I personally

56
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.399
don't think that's a good way to sort of

57
00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:54.199
demarcate it. I think it's defined. In terms of

58
00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.880
not beginning with that representational standpoint. But that doesn't

59
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.039
necessarily mean that, you know, in the control of

60
00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.960
action, we wouldn't come to develop some sort of

61
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.839
representational structures. So there's a very broad notion of

62
00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:07.919
inactivism, cognition begins as the control of action, and

63
00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.720
then there are more sort of specific notions of

64
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.839
it that focus more on, for example, things like

65
00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:17.119
biological processes, um, the concept of autopoiesis, which we'll

66
00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:21.500
probably get to. Um, AND that makes a lot

67
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.740
more specific claims about what action needs to be

68
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.539
and how it, how it needs to be embodied.

69
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.179
I guess if you think of inaction as focusing

70
00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:31.169
on the body, you might have lots of different

71
00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.220
the body and how the body acts. That still

72
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.899
is quite open to a variety of different views

73
00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.500
about what it takes to have a body. Could

74
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.500
a robot have a body, or does a body

75
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.259
have to be alive, for example, and different kind

76
00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:45.539
of approaches within that kind of broader framework of

77
00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.570
inactivism would take different positions on those questions.

78
00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:52.000
Right. So, at a certain point there, you mentioned

79
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.919
the phenomenological tradition in philosophy. Could you tell us

80
00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.809
a little bit more about how do you look

81
00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:01.880
at the relationship between inactivism and phenomenology? I mean,

82
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.649
is an activism sort of a naturalistic continuation of

83
00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:09.419
the phenomenological tradition or what?

84
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.750
I think that that's how I like to think

85
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.550
about it. I mean, people will argue a lot

86
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.949
on what the correct way to think about it

87
00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.579
is, but to me it is very continuous. Um,

88
00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.250
IT'S both historically, um, the embodied mind was very

89
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.670
directly inspired by Merlo Ponty. Um, SO there's a

90
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.350
sort of a direct link there. But also there

91
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.390
is a very deep similarity in kind of, in

92
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.709
almost in kind of the underlying metaphysics, I think,

93
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.790
which is important. In that a lot of these

94
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.940
debates around what cognition is are often I sometimes

95
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.049
approach this kind of more empirical questions like we

96
00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:47.329
have to look, we have to, you know, look

97
00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:48.790
into the brain, see what's going on, and then

98
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.880
we can figure out cognition. And I think what's

99
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.890
sometimes missed is that a lot of an active

100
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.470
work is inspired by a sort of deeper question,

101
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.559
which is not just what's the best framework for

102
00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:03.359
describing the brain, but what is the best way

103
00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:06.119
to think about these kind of foundational philosophical concepts

104
00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:10.850
like truth and knowledge, um. And there's a kind

105
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.609
of like very crude way you could divide up

106
00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:14.510
the way that those ideas are thought about in

107
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.970
the broader kind of philosophical tradition where the kind

108
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.649
of the kind of philosophy in school because I

109
00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:22.890
was in a very analytic program is very kind

110
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.440
of focused on things like correspondence, um, You know,

111
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.000
there's an objective world out there, how can we

112
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.720
justify knowledge of it and then you have this

113
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.679
sort of gap between the objective world and what's

114
00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:34.679
in your mind, how do you overcome that skepticism.

115
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.339
And one of the most important ideas of phenomenology

116
00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:40.579
for me is this idea that you can have

117
00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:43.299
a notion of objectivity and truth, and like, correctness

118
00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:46.140
and incorrectness. So it's not just like a purely

119
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.339
subject it's not a purely subjective view of what

120
00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:52.630
we can know. It's often phenomenology is often, I

121
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.390
think, placed in the camp of introspectionism. So I

122
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.559
guess the thing to say is. The sort of

123
00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:02.119
basic method that one might think of as involved

124
00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:05.040
in phenomenology is that you take your experience of

125
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.279
the world and you like really look at that

126
00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.679
experience and try and figure out what are the

127
00:06:08.679 --> 00:06:12.359
properties of that experience. Sometimes that sounds very subjectivist,

128
00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:14.320
you know, you're just like staring at a glass

129
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.519
of wine and trying to think, what is it

130
00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:17.679
really like to look at this wine? Um, BUT

131
00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:20.040
that's like a horrible caricature. Um, IT'S a much

132
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.109
more kind of rigorous method where it's, It's more

133
00:06:23.109 --> 00:06:25.510
like if my experience has these structures, so for

134
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.950
example, it's spatial, um, you know, there is a

135
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.829
sense of things being objects that I can interact

136
00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:34.799
with, um, it's temporal. There are these kind of.

137
00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:40.260
Necessary underlying structures in my experience and what phenomenology

138
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.970
is trying to do often is to get at

139
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.380
that structural aspect of experience. And to get at

140
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.140
what features experience has to have to be experience

141
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.019
at all. And that tends to be sort of

142
00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:55.089
grounded in rather than features of the objective world,

143
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.739
features of what we as a kind of as

144
00:06:57.739 --> 00:07:01.579
experiences as experiences, as people who experience, as a

145
00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:04.679
group. Um, WHAT are the sort of It's more

146
00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:07.359
like a sort of intersubjective notion of objectivity, that

147
00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:09.359
to be part of this group of people who

148
00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:12.040
experience the world, we have to have certain structures

149
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.480
in our experience, and that gives experience that kind

150
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.850
of objectivity that's very different from an objectivity that's

151
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.000
grounded in what's independent from us. Um, SO it's

152
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.630
not like purely individual, but it's not about an

153
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.320
independent world. It's more about a group of people

154
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.070
and what kind of features must their experience have

155
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.739
to be an experience of a world at all.

156
00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:37.079
And just how that ties into an activism is,

157
00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:39.609
I think it gives you a notion of trying

158
00:07:39.609 --> 00:07:41.720
to think about what are, what is the goal

159
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.809
and what is the purpose of cognition? What are

160
00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:46.609
we trying to do that isn't about matching an

161
00:07:46.609 --> 00:07:49.369
external world, but more about coordinating our actions with

162
00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:52.609
respect to each other. Um, AND that, I do

163
00:07:52.609 --> 00:07:56.200
think is kind of like quite a fundamental. Sort

164
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.760
of metaphysical feature of a lot of inactive work,

165
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.089
um, that is quite different from sort of the

166
00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:05.079
traditional sort of objective realist metaphysics, you might get

167
00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:07.450
in a lot of other areas of sort of

168
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.510
scientific and naturalistic approaches to the mind. I don't

169
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.029
know if that was maybe too like wide ranging

170
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:14.140
in the explanation. Uh,

171
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.950
YEAH, we also have some other concepts in this

172
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.220
sort of theoretical introduction we're doing here to the

173
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.470
topic and uh also some other frameworks, some of

174
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.950
which you've already mentioned there that we're going to

175
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.589
talk about as well. But, uh, I would like

176
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:31.910
to ask you now, what are intentions and what

177
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.969
does it mean for living systems to have goals?

178
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.989
Sure, yeah, so I think. There's two ways the

179
00:08:39.989 --> 00:08:46.309
notion of intention intentionality might be used in philosophy

180
00:08:46.309 --> 00:08:49.020
in a in a non sort of phenomenological way,

181
00:08:49.469 --> 00:08:51.789
which would be in a sort of analytic philosophy

182
00:08:51.789 --> 00:08:55.549
of mind. Intentionality isn't about goals, or it's often

183
00:08:55.549 --> 00:08:58.390
explicitly stated that it's not about goals. It's the

184
00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:02.309
property of the mind being directed towards correspondence with

185
00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:05.229
some sort of external object. So it's the property

186
00:09:05.229 --> 00:09:08.349
that a representation has. It has intentional content, and

187
00:09:08.349 --> 00:09:11.789
that content is the state of affairs that the

188
00:09:11.789 --> 00:09:15.900
representation is sort of somehow supposed to match up

189
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.919
with, um. So that's how it often gets used

190
00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:21.830
in philosophy of mind. It's less about, you know,

191
00:09:22.359 --> 00:09:24.080
I want to pick up this glass of water

192
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.880
and my intention is to do so, but more

193
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.280
I have a state in my head that bears

194
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.559
an intentional or representational relationship to that glass of

195
00:09:30.559 --> 00:09:32.840
water, which is often a bit confusing I think.

196
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.750
Um, AND then obviously there's the notion of intention

197
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.960
that is more the kind of common notion that

198
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.229
you and I would use when you talk about,

199
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.159
you know, did you have the kind of intention

200
00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:44.799
that's important, for example, in a court, when you're

201
00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:47.030
like, did they have intention to commit that act?

202
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.909
Um, DID they have like a conscious sort of

203
00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:52.630
desire to do so, did they consider it beforehand?

204
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.880
And it's very rationalistic and linguistic. So we tend

205
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.710
to be thinking about, did somebody sort of sit

206
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.070
there and deliberate and make a decision. Before they

207
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.669
acted, and that's the question of whether or not

208
00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:05.510
it's intentional. Um, BUT I think there's this sort

209
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.340
of third notion of intention, which is what I'm

210
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.630
interested in, which is less kind of rationalistic and

211
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.109
less deliberative than the notion that's involved when we

212
00:10:15.109 --> 00:10:19.409
think about human intentional action and deliberation. And that's

213
00:10:19.409 --> 00:10:21.309
more the set, but it is still about action,

214
00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:24.299
and that's the way in which when we think

215
00:10:24.299 --> 00:10:27.020
of living systems in general, we can think of

216
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.460
their actions as directed towards the achievement of something

217
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.780
that they might fail to bring it about. Um,

218
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.229
SO you know, a bacteria can swim up a

219
00:10:36.229 --> 00:10:39.070
sugar gradient, and in a sense, the, the behavior

220
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.030
of that bacterium is sort of, it's directed towards

221
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.669
achieving a particular state, toward achieving a particular sort

222
00:10:45.669 --> 00:10:49.359
of nutrient flow. That's quite different from how a

223
00:10:49.359 --> 00:10:51.390
machine works, because in the case of a machine,

224
00:10:51.719 --> 00:10:55.440
once we've described every single sort of feature of

225
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.880
that machine and the laws that govern it, we've

226
00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.789
said all that there is to say. There's no

227
00:10:59.789 --> 00:11:01.479
more to say about, but should it have done

228
00:11:01.479 --> 00:11:03.000
that? Was it supposed to do that? Has it

229
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.559
failed or succeeded in doing that? And I think

230
00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:11.530
that's an interesting. An interesting sort of. Middle ground,

231
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.130
an interesting distinction between a living system and a

232
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.979
machine that's not quite the sort of full-fledged human

233
00:11:16.979 --> 00:11:19.710
notion of intention. And it's making sense of that

234
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.090
basic sense of success and failure, striving, aiming notion

235
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.489
of intention that I think is quite important for

236
00:11:26.489 --> 00:11:28.969
them as like a sort of basis before we

237
00:11:28.969 --> 00:11:30.799
can get to the human notion of intention.

238
00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:34.799
Mm. Right. So, uh, earlier when we were talking

239
00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:39.239
about inactivism, you mentioned very briefly autopoiesis. So, what

240
00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:41.559
is it and how does it come into the

241
00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:42.510
picture here?

242
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.760
Sure. So autopoiesis, that was developed by Francisco Varela

243
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:52.270
with Humberto Matuana, two Chilean biologist. Um, AND initially,

244
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.200
the, the kind of core of Apois is the

245
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.000
cell. And what autopoiesis is supposed to describe is

246
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.150
it it means self-production. How the cell produces itself.

247
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.510
Um, AND that kind of involves in a very,

248
00:12:06.679 --> 00:12:08.450
it typically begins with like a very, very crude

249
00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.750
model of a cell. It's just like a membrane

250
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.400
surrounding a network of reactions. And the idea is

251
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.400
that that network of reactions, that metabolic network, depends

252
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.320
on the membrane to work, because if there's no

253
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.719
membrane. Surrounding that network of reactants, they'll just disperse,

254
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.090
and they won't have the necessary concentrations for the

255
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.359
necessary reactions to take place. But the membrane in

256
00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:36.000
turn depends upon the internal internal network of reactions,

257
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.960
because that membrane is itself sort of precarious and

258
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.690
needing to be constantly rebuilt by the synthetic activity

259
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:48.000
of the internal sort of chemical reactant network. So

260
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.599
there's this mutual dependence between the membrane surrounding the

261
00:12:50.599 --> 00:12:54.900
reactions and the reaction network itself. That gives you

262
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.599
some sort of notion of self-production. Um, SO the

263
00:12:59.599 --> 00:13:02.440
basic the idea about hypoesis was initially very focused

264
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.739
on the cell and on those kind of molecular

265
00:13:05.739 --> 00:13:08.880
processes specifically. And then I think one of the

266
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.919
big kind of questions in how people think about

267
00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:13.320
that more recently is there's a tendency to try

268
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.919
and generalize. There's a, well, there's a desire, right,

269
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.840
to generalize beyond the cell. The cell is a

270
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.640
nice sort of, um, canonical example. I like to

271
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.789
think of the, you know, what the Turing machine,

272
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.039
the idea of a Turing machine is to classical

273
00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:28.919
cognitive science. The cell is to an active cognitive

274
00:13:28.919 --> 00:13:31.349
science. It's the kind of minimal unit of cognit

275
00:13:31.349 --> 00:13:33.320
the kind of basic structure of cognition is supposed

276
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.140
to be exemplified in it. Um. But then, you

277
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.260
know, if we want to think about multicellular creatures

278
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.049
as cognizing, do we talk about them as being

279
00:13:42.049 --> 00:13:44.580
out of poetic in some way as well? Given

280
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.650
that, you know, my self is not purely at

281
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.609
the level of a single cell and single set

282
00:13:50.609 --> 00:13:53.780
of molecular reactions, as these sensory motor coordination leaps

283
00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.140
as well. The kind of question is how do

284
00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:00.099
we take. That notion of what is essentially cellular

285
00:14:00.099 --> 00:14:04.299
metabolism and generalize it to these like higher level

286
00:14:04.299 --> 00:14:04.929
processes.

287
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.280
Uh, SO related to that, I, I mean, I

288
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.530
think it's related to that, but what about autonomy?

289
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.760
What is autonomy and the other is related to

290
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.630
it in any way?

291
00:14:16.479 --> 00:14:19.150
Yeah, um, so I think autonomy is interesting in

292
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.830
that. The kind of root, the philosophical roots of

293
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.750
autonomy, often like K's kind of your key guy

294
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.700
for the for the idea of autonomy. Um, AND

295
00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:30.750
it's like a self-given law. It's a law that

296
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.830
you give to yourself. Um, AND this key idea

297
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:39.309
there is freedom is not about not being restricted.

298
00:14:39.349 --> 00:14:42.510
It's not about not being constrained at all. It's

299
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.510
not that kind of purely voluntarist concept conception of

300
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.909
freedom where you could do anything. That's a meaningless

301
00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:52.169
notion of freedom. ANYWAY. Um, BUT it's also, you

302
00:14:52.169 --> 00:14:54.710
know, if you're pure, purely determined by the external

303
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.190
laws of the universe to follow some particular trajectory

304
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.349
without any kind of influence on that, then that

305
00:15:00.349 --> 00:15:02.549
can't really be freedom either. And the idea of

306
00:15:02.549 --> 00:15:06.590
autonomy is supposed to capture this notion that as

307
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.349
a system, you can constrain your own behaviors in

308
00:15:09.349 --> 00:15:12.510
ways that make those behaviors meaningful because they are

309
00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.760
expressions of constraints you yourself have chosen. So they're

310
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.440
not, you know, purely random, but they are still

311
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.270
sort of self-determined. It's the giving a law to

312
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:26.390
yourself. Um, THAT'S the kind of sort of traditional

313
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:30.099
philosophical notion of it. And then the way it

314
00:15:30.099 --> 00:15:33.419
relates to autopoiesis is, is as I said, one

315
00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:36.140
of the issues with autopoiesis is how do we

316
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.690
generalize that beyond the single cell. And one popular

317
00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:41.799
way of thinking about it is rather than trying

318
00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:46.650
to modify that very molecular notion of self-production, you

319
00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.570
say, OK, Aldiquesis is the molecular notion of self-production.

320
00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:53.479
But that is a minimal form of autonomy, where

321
00:15:53.479 --> 00:15:56.450
autonomy is the more general property. And then the

322
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.090
question is, how do you make sense of that

323
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.530
more general property? Um, AND one of them might

324
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.059
be something like, because the cell has that kind

325
00:16:03.059 --> 00:16:08.650
of internal mutual dependence of its parts, that determines

326
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.609
what that cell can and can't do and continue

327
00:16:10.609 --> 00:16:14.830
to exist. Because the cell, the the internal network,

328
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.619
the internal metabolic network can't exist without the membrane,

329
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.349
that means that that cell needs to, for example,

330
00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:23.000
take in certain nutrients in order to refuel those

331
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.280
reactants, to rebuild its membrane. It needs to not,

332
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.799
you know, go into certain chemicals or go into

333
00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:32.799
certain temperatures. It's sort of precarious mutual dependence of

334
00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:35.780
processes that make up a cell, constrain what that

335
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.119
cell can and can't do. um. And the idea

336
00:16:39.119 --> 00:16:41.640
that that's, that is some sort of minimal notion

337
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.119
of autonomy insofar as there's nothing about the laws

338
00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:47.320
of the universe that state a cell has to

339
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.239
exist. You know, that's not a general feature of

340
00:16:51.239 --> 00:16:54.400
fundamental physics that cells must emerge. But once they

341
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.289
emerge, and once you have these kind of structures,

342
00:16:56.359 --> 00:16:58.520
they create their own further constraints on what they

343
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.989
can and can't do, um, that are intrinsic to

344
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.519
that sort of system. And there's lots of different,

345
00:17:05.769 --> 00:17:08.838
more specific ways that people have formulated that notion

346
00:17:08.838 --> 00:17:11.558
of biological autonomy because there's lots of problems with

347
00:17:11.558 --> 00:17:13.718
each of them. But I think the general idea

348
00:17:13.718 --> 00:17:17.708
is to capture that notion of the system has

349
00:17:17.917 --> 00:17:21.560
a kind of Precarious structure that determines that that

350
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.630
system then has particular needs that it has to

351
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.358
fulfill, but it only has those needs because of

352
00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:28.800
the system that it is, not because of any

353
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.199
sort of general features of the universe. So it's

354
00:17:31.199 --> 00:17:34.079
determining its own needs. Um, AND that sort of,

355
00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:36.089
I think, maybe see how that relates to the

356
00:17:36.089 --> 00:17:38.359
sort of more Kantian notion of autonomy as a

357
00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:39.369
self-given law.

358
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.400
Yeah. Uh, SO in the book, you also talk

359
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.119
about the concept of adaptivity. What does it refer

360
00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:47.400
to?

361
00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:50.939
Yeah, so when I said the idea that autopois

362
00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:52.969
is supposed to be this sort of minimal kernel

363
00:17:53.339 --> 00:17:56.790
of a cognitive system. The big problem with that

364
00:17:56.959 --> 00:18:00.560
is something like that kind of metabolic self production.

365
00:18:01.819 --> 00:18:04.140
Doesn't really come by degrees. You can't be better

366
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.140
or worse at it. You can't be flexible in

367
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.900
it. It's just you have to maintain the right

368
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.500
balance of energy flows, and either you succeed or

369
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.420
you fail. So it's a very either or sort

370
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.099
of normativity. You're either living or you're dead. Um,

371
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.619
AND that's not very useful for thinking about action

372
00:18:19.619 --> 00:18:23.979
coordination, where we're trying to progressively improve our conditions.

373
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.709
We're trying to. You know, control, there's more of

374
00:18:26.709 --> 00:18:29.290
a regulatory aspect where things can be better or

375
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.199
worse, and we're trying to adjust them to make

376
00:18:31.199 --> 00:18:33.890
them better or worse. You know, we're not just

377
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.609
living or dying, we are coping with our environment

378
00:18:36.609 --> 00:18:38.449
and changing the way in which we're living in

379
00:18:38.449 --> 00:18:40.880
that changing the way in which we're living to

380
00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.410
make our to sort of improve our conditions of

381
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.849
viability. And so adaptivity, which was introduced by, obviously

382
00:18:47.849 --> 00:18:49.770
adaptivity is a more general notion, but in the

383
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:54.170
inactive sort of literature specifically. Um, THAT was introduced

384
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.880
in a paper by Ezekiel de Paolo in 2005.

385
00:18:57.209 --> 00:18:58.609
And I think the whole point of that paper

386
00:18:58.609 --> 00:19:01.130
is people had said for a while that like

387
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.329
autopoiesis is not sufficient for something that we would

388
00:19:04.329 --> 00:19:06.930
think of as a cognitive system. You can create

389
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:10.689
quite trivial, minimally out of poetic systems that don't

390
00:19:10.689 --> 00:19:13.599
have any kind of interactions where they modify their

391
00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:16.729
environments, and that activity is supposed to capture that

392
00:19:16.729 --> 00:19:19.729
there's also this additional element. It's not just that

393
00:19:19.729 --> 00:19:24.619
you're a sort of um. A cycle of processes

394
00:19:24.619 --> 00:19:27.619
that keep supporting each other. You're also a cycle

395
00:19:27.619 --> 00:19:31.060
of external processes that involve adjusting your environment to

396
00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.819
support that internal network. Um, YEAH.

397
00:19:34.689 --> 00:19:36.949
So, just one more thing before we get into

398
00:19:36.949 --> 00:19:40.510
the free energy principle. You also talk about predictive

399
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:44.709
processing. So, what is predictive processing about and what

400
00:19:44.709 --> 00:19:47.430
can we derive from it for the sort of

401
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.589
framework you present in your book?

402
00:19:50.459 --> 00:19:53.900
Sure, yeah, so I think there's. A few different

403
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.900
kind of, I think what predictive processing is like

404
00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.089
the framework that it's sort of currently known as

405
00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.510
does is sort of synthesize a variety of different

406
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.739
ideas that people have had about what the brain

407
00:20:05.739 --> 00:20:08.839
needs to do to cope with the world. Um,

408
00:20:08.959 --> 00:20:11.949
ONE of them is compression. So that's the idea

409
00:20:11.949 --> 00:20:14.109
that, you know, firstly there are bottlenecks in the

410
00:20:14.109 --> 00:20:16.189
nervous system and we need to only transmit the

411
00:20:16.189 --> 00:20:19.449
sort of relevant information. And there's the idea of

412
00:20:19.449 --> 00:20:23.449
predictive coding, so that whenever you are trying to

413
00:20:23.449 --> 00:20:25.369
send a message, you don't need to send all

414
00:20:25.369 --> 00:20:27.329
of the information. So you know, if you're trying

415
00:20:27.329 --> 00:20:29.410
to send a picture, you don't need to send

416
00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.609
the color value of every single pixel. You just

417
00:20:32.609 --> 00:20:35.770
say, you know, this pixel is black, and then

418
00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:37.609
just keep that going until there's an error, and

419
00:20:37.609 --> 00:20:39.400
that error signal tells you to change the color

420
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.079
of the pixel. So you can, it's a way

421
00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:44.160
of compressing the amount of information you're sending. You

422
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.069
just send when there's a change, not every single

423
00:20:47.069 --> 00:20:48.930
value of every pixel individually, you know, you don't

424
00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.430
send the same message over and over again. Um,

425
00:20:51.569 --> 00:20:53.760
SO that's an interesting and useful idea that that

426
00:20:53.760 --> 00:21:00.800
might be, um, relevant to your neural functioning. Predictive

427
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.880
processing is also, I think most significantly linked to

428
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.410
the idea of perception as inference. So the idea

429
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.890
that um, You know, the information that we get

430
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.369
about the world is very, very limited in some

431
00:21:14.369 --> 00:21:16.930
sense, in some people will argue about that as

432
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.729
well. Um, BUT if you think about, you know,

433
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.890
the light that comes in through your retina, that

434
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.630
massively under determines the kind of objects that you

435
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.130
can be around you. And like, I think the

436
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.369
most obvious example of that is when you look

437
00:21:28.369 --> 00:21:31.619
around you, you see three dimensional objects. You see

438
00:21:31.619 --> 00:21:32.959
them, you know, if you can't see all the

439
00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:34.760
legs of a table in front of you, you

440
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.359
can only see sort of the top and one

441
00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:38.839
leg. But you sort of perceive that table as

442
00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:42.040
having, you know, legs and other parts that are

443
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.400
hidden to you. You don't see it as a

444
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.160
sort of facade, like a flat 2D facade. You

445
00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.119
see it as an object that has hidden elements

446
00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:49.560
that if, you know, if you moved around, you

447
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.680
could see them. So there's that kind of reconstructive

448
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:57.550
element in our perceptual experience. Um, uh, THE idea

449
00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.819
is kind of. So again, again, it all comes

450
00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:05.449
back to can, but the kind of the cantier

451
00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:08.900
the cognition is at least involves an element of

452
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:14.489
us as perceivers sort of synthesizing this, um, indeterminate

453
00:22:14.489 --> 00:22:18.489
input and creating a sort of space the spatiality

454
00:22:18.859 --> 00:22:21.739
of our experience of the world involves a contribution

455
00:22:21.739 --> 00:22:27.599
from our minds, essentially, um. And then the Herman

456
00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:29.359
von Helmholtz, and I never know what to describe

457
00:22:29.359 --> 00:22:30.839
him as because he was kind of a polymath,

458
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.920
but let's just say he was a polymath. He

459
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.560
did all things. Um, HE sort of attempted to

460
00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.520
kind of operationalize that Cantuan idea that humans bring

461
00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.469
a contribution to cognition. They don't just passively receive

462
00:22:43.469 --> 00:22:46.670
the world. And he formulated that in terms of

463
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:50.349
an inferential process, not actually, I think a Bayesian

464
00:22:50.349 --> 00:22:54.180
inferential process, more a sort of associationist inferential process.

465
00:22:54.869 --> 00:22:57.310
Um, BUT still the idea there was that we

466
00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:01.660
are following certain laws of kind of probabilistic inference

467
00:23:02.449 --> 00:23:08.420
to. You know, infer from indeterminate sensory evidence what

468
00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.060
the world is actually like, and that what we

469
00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.579
actually experience is not the indeterminate, you know, the

470
00:23:14.579 --> 00:23:18.099
sort of photons hitting our retina, but a kind

471
00:23:18.099 --> 00:23:21.680
of cognitive reconstruction of what is the best explanation

472
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.579
based on all of our previous knowledge. That would

473
00:23:25.579 --> 00:23:28.180
explain that sensory data. So you sort of learn

474
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.420
to see is the idea, you know, seeing is

475
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.209
not something you just happens to you, it's something

476
00:23:32.209 --> 00:23:34.219
that you learn how to do over time by

477
00:23:34.219 --> 00:23:36.619
interacting with the world and seeing how your sensory

478
00:23:36.619 --> 00:23:41.770
information. Changes through that interaction. Um, AND yeah, the

479
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.290
idea is that can be formalized in terms of

480
00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:46.920
Bayesian inference. Um, THAT'S kind of what the free

481
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.630
energy principle and active inference tries to do. Um,

482
00:23:49.739 --> 00:23:52.829
AND predictive processing gives you kind of one story

483
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.560
about a sort of architecture for Bayesian inference under

484
00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.880
certain constraints. So if you think of that inferential

485
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.800
process, it's a really, really complicated mathematical. Sort of

486
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.930
calculation that you would have to do to actually

487
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.810
infer all of the different possible hidden causes of

488
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.290
your sensory stimulation, it would be impossible. So we

489
00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.290
try and approximate that, and one way we could

490
00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.770
approximate that is through this kind of attempt to

491
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:19.530
just continually predict and update. Um, AND I guess

492
00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:21.530
one final thing to say is a key aspect

493
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.089
of that in predictive processing is the idea that

494
00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.890
that's a hierarchical process. So it's not just I

495
00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:28.839
make a prediction at the level of sense data,

496
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.729
at the level of, um, not sense data, at

497
00:24:30.729 --> 00:24:33.079
the level of sensory input. You know, not just

498
00:24:33.079 --> 00:24:35.349
predicting what's going on at my retina. In fact,

499
00:24:35.359 --> 00:24:38.839
I'm never consciously doing that. But that we're predicting,

500
00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:42.400
we're attempting to make predictions over multiple different timescales

501
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.640
and different sort of spatial grains. So I might

502
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.109
be predicting. You know, I'm more likely to predicting

503
00:24:48.109 --> 00:24:50.069
that there's, um, you know, a table leg beneath

504
00:24:50.069 --> 00:24:52.469
the table, and that's a very indeterminate and vague

505
00:24:52.469 --> 00:24:54.790
prediction, and it's a much sort of higher level

506
00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:57.430
coarse grained prediction that I don't update unless a

507
00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:01.099
really massive change happens at the lower levels. Um,

508
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.349
SO you sort of reconstruct the causal structure, you

509
00:25:04.349 --> 00:25:06.750
attempt to reconstruct the causal structure of the world.

510
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.459
At lots of different levels of sort of spatiotemporal

511
00:25:10.459 --> 00:25:13.329
grain. And that's how we get these sort of

512
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.810
large size objects in our perceptual experience.

513
00:25:17.829 --> 00:25:20.859
Right. So let's get then into the free energy

514
00:25:20.859 --> 00:25:23.530
principle. Uh, I mean, of course, there would be

515
00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.140
tons of things to talk about here, but could

516
00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.339
you give us perhaps a summary of it or

517
00:25:28.339 --> 00:25:31.859
at least of the particular aspects that are the

518
00:25:31.859 --> 00:25:34.969
most relevant for the kinds of topics you explore

519
00:25:34.969 --> 00:25:35.660
in the book?

520
00:25:36.469 --> 00:25:40.829
Sure, yeah, um. Again, I think with the principle,

521
00:25:40.869 --> 00:25:43.270
there's, there's kind of two ways into it. One

522
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.609
is the way I've just described predictive processing, which

523
00:25:46.609 --> 00:25:51.270
is, um, We have this sort of under determination

524
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:55.260
problem where the evidence that we have is insufficient

525
00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.430
to let us know about the structure of the

526
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.510
world. And so we want to do some sort

527
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.430
of inferential process to figure out what are the

528
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:07.229
causes of our, um, of our inputs. Bayesian inference

529
00:26:07.229 --> 00:26:08.989
is like the classic sort of gold standard for

530
00:26:08.989 --> 00:26:11.430
how we would do that. Bayesian inference is too

531
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.430
hard with all of the different options. We use

532
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:18.650
this approximation technique and I guess, sorry, I'm actually

533
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.670
talking more about active inference here. I've just realized.

534
00:26:21.849 --> 00:26:23.900
OK, no, no problem. We can go back

535
00:26:26.079 --> 00:26:26.810
to the beginning. Um, I think it helps to

536
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.729
talk about active inference first though, maybe because in

537
00:26:29.729 --> 00:26:32.449
that context, all active in all the kind of

538
00:26:32.449 --> 00:26:35.760
idea of free energy minimization in that context is,

539
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:42.599
um, doing. Is it something that With a kind

540
00:26:42.599 --> 00:26:45.000
of with quite a lot of assumptions can be

541
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.760
an approximation of the true prediction error relative to

542
00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.920
a Bayesian process. So in a properly Bayesian process,

543
00:26:51.959 --> 00:26:54.239
you're trying to make your input as likely as

544
00:26:54.239 --> 00:26:57.400
possible. You're, but not just your current input, you're

545
00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.849
trying to find the sort of probabilistic model. That

546
00:27:00.849 --> 00:27:05.310
would make your history of sensory experiences as likely

547
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.890
as possible. So, you know, if you see a

548
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.119
white object, you don't just go, everything is white,

549
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.130
because that's the best way to minimize my prediction

550
00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:14.650
error, because you've had lots of experiences of non-white

551
00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:18.760
objects. So you try and minimize average survival surprisal

552
00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.489
and say you've seen 50% white objects, 50% black

553
00:27:21.489 --> 00:27:24.530
ones, you, the best way to minimize your surprisal

554
00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:28.420
is to go 50% black, 50% white. Um, BUT

555
00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.329
as I said, that's really hard, um, and free

556
00:27:31.329 --> 00:27:37.780
energy is. Under under certain assumptions, which there are

557
00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.380
quite a lot of assumptions, it's a good proxy

558
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.339
for surprisal. So instead of minimizing the surprisal of

559
00:27:42.339 --> 00:27:45.140
your evidence stream, you minimize this free energy, which

560
00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:49.500
is just that, that unlikeliness relative to a much

561
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.979
simpler probability distribution. So basically, you can strain the

562
00:27:52.979 --> 00:27:55.699
probabilistic models that you work with, and you don't

563
00:27:55.699 --> 00:27:59.060
deal with every single possible probability distribution. You just

564
00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.859
deal with a very simple sort of set, um,

565
00:28:01.939 --> 00:28:03.939
and normally it'll be something like a Gaussian distribution

566
00:28:03.939 --> 00:28:07.150
or a normal distribution. Um, AND you vary that

567
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.949
very limited model and try and change that to

568
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.920
make your evidence as likely as possible. So you're

569
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.680
doing sort of the same thing that you would

570
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.449
do in Bayesian inference, just with a much simpler

571
00:28:18.449 --> 00:28:24.680
model. And the difference between that simple, how much

572
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.800
that simple model allows you to minimize surprise, um,

573
00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.719
and how much a Bayesian model would is kind

574
00:28:30.719 --> 00:28:35.150
of the, The approximation part of the free energy

575
00:28:35.849 --> 00:28:39.689
term. Um, SO that's kind of what free energy

576
00:28:39.689 --> 00:28:44.859
is in that context. Right. And then, and so

577
00:28:44.859 --> 00:28:46.969
there it's very much tied to this problem of

578
00:28:46.969 --> 00:28:49.369
inference, I guess it's the main point. It's very

579
00:28:49.369 --> 00:28:52.530
much tied to this view that we are trying

580
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.560
to reconstruct the actual structure of the world. Now,

581
00:28:55.569 --> 00:28:58.250
as I said, like, that's not how inactivists tend

582
00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.859
to think about the problem of cognition. They tend

583
00:29:00.859 --> 00:29:03.819
to think about it as a process of controlling

584
00:29:03.819 --> 00:29:08.170
action, um, you know, keep biological regulation. And I

585
00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:12.319
think the free energy principle is the principle. Has

586
00:29:12.319 --> 00:29:14.560
become much more associated with that way of thinking

587
00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.000
about cognition. So it's less about the kind of

588
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.380
predictivist, reconstructivist view. Under that view, what free energy

589
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.260
is doing is quite different. It's mathematically it's the

590
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:32.160
same, um, but how you interpret what's going on

591
00:29:32.459 --> 00:29:37.089
is it's less I'm trying to minimize prediction error

592
00:29:37.089 --> 00:29:40.719
or surprise or. In order to reconstruct the world.

593
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:43.160
What I'm actually trying to do is control myself.

594
00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.250
Um, I'm trying to be homeostatic. I'm trying to

595
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.849
regulate my internal temperature and all of those kind

596
00:29:48.849 --> 00:29:52.050
of um essential variables that need to have a

597
00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.189
certain value to keep me alive. And in the

598
00:29:55.189 --> 00:29:57.910
same way as if you're trying to make predictions

599
00:29:57.910 --> 00:29:59.790
around the world about the world, you're trying to

600
00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:02.510
minimize surprisal. Just in the same way, if you're

601
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.550
trying to control your internal state, you're also trying

602
00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:08.829
to minimize how unlikely um deviation, how you're trying

603
00:30:08.829 --> 00:30:13.130
to minimize deviations from a predicted state. And in

604
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.130
this kind of more inactive way of thinking. So

605
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:17.900
in the traditional way of thinking, you have an

606
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.250
error, and the way to get rid of that

607
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.410
error is to update your model because there's something

608
00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:22.969
out there that's correct and you want to match

609
00:30:22.969 --> 00:30:25.160
it. So you change what's going on in here

610
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.689
to minimize that error. In the more kind of

611
00:30:27.689 --> 00:30:31.199
control or inactive or cybernetic, um, way of thinking,

612
00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.380
whenever there's an error. And if it's about control,

613
00:30:34.469 --> 00:30:37.589
the error, the problem is not your internal state.

614
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.069
The problem is, the problem is not your predicted

615
00:30:40.069 --> 00:30:41.810
internal state. The problem is that the world isn't

616
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:44.589
matching your prediction. So rather than update your model,

617
00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.510
you try and act upon the world to make

618
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.390
it match your prediction. So if I've always expected

619
00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.609
to have a body temperature of 37.5 degrees and

620
00:30:52.609 --> 00:30:54.790
I get too hot, it doesn't make sense for

621
00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.390
me to go, Oh, now my body temperature is

622
00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:59.390
40 degrees because eventually you'll just die. It makes

623
00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.239
sense for you to try and cool yourself down.

624
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.989
But what's interesting is, even though you're conceiving the

625
00:31:05.989 --> 00:31:09.030
problem differently, you're thinking about it in terms of

626
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:13.050
control rather than reconstruction. What you're actually doing is

627
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:16.250
minimizing the same thing. You're minimizing unlikeliness relative to

628
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:19.609
your model. You're just doing it by changing the

629
00:31:19.609 --> 00:31:22.489
causes of your sensory input rather than by changing

630
00:31:22.489 --> 00:31:25.689
your model. And so the free energy principle kind

631
00:31:25.689 --> 00:31:29.050
of says we can think about life as regulation.

632
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.880
Every living system is a system that is homeostatic,

633
00:31:32.089 --> 00:31:34.650
that has to control or allostatic, that has to

634
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:37.530
regulate its internal states to stay alive. And if

635
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:40.109
it's true. Which I don't think it is, which

636
00:31:40.109 --> 00:31:42.469
we'll get to. Um, BUT I, if I, if

637
00:31:42.469 --> 00:31:44.829
that is true, if the basic principle of living

638
00:31:44.829 --> 00:31:49.369
systems is regulation and control, then insofar as minimizing

639
00:31:49.369 --> 00:31:53.300
of errors and surprises allows you to describe that,

640
00:31:53.469 --> 00:31:55.469
then it allows you to describe everything a living

641
00:31:55.469 --> 00:31:57.430
system has to do. And that's kind of the

642
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:58.819
claim of the free energy principle.

643
00:32:00.349 --> 00:32:02.630
Right, right, but, but there are a few concepts

644
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.790
here that I think it's better for us to

645
00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:07.150
go through for people to understand a little bit

646
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:10.880
better. WHAT the free energy principle is about and

647
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.160
how it works. So what is a generative model

648
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:14.680
then?

649
00:32:15.239 --> 00:32:19.219
So yeah, so. The sort of the most, I

650
00:32:19.219 --> 00:32:21.989
guess, um, like normal way of thinking about the

651
00:32:21.989 --> 00:32:25.500
generative model is that it's a joint probability distribution.

652
00:32:26.109 --> 00:32:30.250
Um, SO if you're in, if your problem is

653
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:34.709
that kind of inferential reconstructive problem, then what you

654
00:32:34.709 --> 00:32:36.869
have are your sensory inputs, and then you have

655
00:32:36.869 --> 00:32:39.010
your hidden causes that you want to know about.

656
00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:42.540
And the generative model is a model of the

657
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:47.300
joint likelihood of all of those different possible. Inputs

658
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.859
and hidden causes. And once you have that kind

659
00:32:49.859 --> 00:32:52.130
of model, and if you are thinking of this

660
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.939
in these very reconstructivist terms, that's a model that

661
00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:57.660
you literally encode somewhere in your brain. And that's

662
00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.780
what allows you to make predictions. That's what allows

663
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.449
you to do the Bayesian inferential process and go,

664
00:33:02.459 --> 00:33:07.260
given this particular observation, this particular hidden external cause

665
00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.140
is the most likely one. So that's, I think,

666
00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.939
the Sort of traditional way of thinking about a

667
00:33:12.939 --> 00:33:15.010
generative model. That's the way you think about it

668
00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:16.979
in sort of machine learning. It's just a way

669
00:33:16.979 --> 00:33:19.140
of allowing you, it's just something, it's a sort

670
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.780
of, it's a structure that you need, um, to

671
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:26.180
infer, to do full Bayesian inference and infer things

672
00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.979
about the world. Um. The way it's used in

673
00:33:30.979 --> 00:33:33.339
the kind of more inactive version of the free

674
00:33:33.339 --> 00:33:37.530
energy principle and active inference. I it's sometimes argued

675
00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:41.130
that rather than this generative model being something that

676
00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:44.790
the individual cognizer is encoding and using to infer

677
00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:48.160
things about the world, instead it's just a description

678
00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.300
of what the statistical structure of the sort of

679
00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.979
the organism and its environment is, um. And it's

680
00:33:56.979 --> 00:34:00.550
some it's what the organism is trying to approximate

681
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.939
through its interactions with the world. It's trying to

682
00:34:03.939 --> 00:34:08.409
preserve a stable set of statistical behaviors, such as,

683
00:34:08.418 --> 00:34:11.830
you know, stable mean temperature. And a stable sort

684
00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:14.708
of relationship between itself and the environment that could

685
00:34:14.708 --> 00:34:17.270
then be described by that statistical model. So we

686
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.070
don't necessarily have to say that the organism is

687
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.929
encoding it and performing inference with it. It's more

688
00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:25.540
a way of describing the process of regulatory control

689
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.330
that that organism is engaged in, because if you

690
00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.850
are controlling your interactions with the environment, then there

691
00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:34.489
will be various states that will be stable with

692
00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:36.649
some variation. And as long as you have those

693
00:34:36.649 --> 00:34:38.929
kind of stable states, then they could be described

694
00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:41.070
by this kind of probabilistic model.

695
00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:45.168
Right. And what is a mark of blanket? And

696
00:34:45.168 --> 00:34:47.449
I mean, what aspects of it are important for

697
00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:50.438
people to understand in the context of your book?

698
00:34:51.129 --> 00:34:55.129
Sure. So, Mark Markov blankets originally came from work

699
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:59.020
on like causal inference. Um, AND there the main

700
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:02.840
idea is if you're trying to make inferences about

701
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.290
causal s well, yeah, 11 of the main ideas

702
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.330
there is if you're trying to make inferences about

703
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:12.610
the causal structure of the environment from purely statistical

704
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:18.770
information. Obviously, like purely purely correlational information is never

705
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:24.010
enough to determine. One set of causes, but sometimes

706
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:29.729
if you look at statistical relationships and statistical, what

707
00:35:29.729 --> 00:35:33.449
are called conditional independencies, that allows you to figure

708
00:35:33.449 --> 00:35:37.050
out some constraints on what the possible set of

709
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.649
causes could be. And like the classic example for

710
00:35:39.649 --> 00:35:41.409
that would be, you know, if you look at

711
00:35:41.409 --> 00:35:43.530
your, like a barometer that measures like, I don't

712
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:45.530
know, what is a barometer, air pressure on the

713
00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.840
wall. And every time you look at your barometer,

714
00:35:48.169 --> 00:35:50.409
there's lightning, and you can go, oh, you know,

715
00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:53.169
the state of my barometer is correlated with the

716
00:35:53.169 --> 00:35:56.850
probability of lightning, and my barometer always shows air

717
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.850
pressure increasing before lightning happens. So you might think,

718
00:35:59.889 --> 00:36:02.840
oh, my barometer is causing the lightning. Um, AND

719
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.760
that obviously is wrong, but if you have a

720
00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.949
third, it's hard to say, but if you have

721
00:36:09.949 --> 00:36:14.600
a sort of additional variable like air pressure. And

722
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.360
once you know that the air pressure is a

723
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:21.199
certain um value, then the state of your barometer

724
00:36:21.199 --> 00:36:24.320
doesn't provide any more information about the likelihood of

725
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.330
lightning. Um, SO that sort of third variable makes

726
00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.729
the lightning conditionally independent of the state of your

727
00:36:30.729 --> 00:36:33.399
barometer. And that allows you to say the only

728
00:36:33.399 --> 00:36:36.489
reason my barometer is connected to lightning is because

729
00:36:36.489 --> 00:36:39.510
it's also connected to this 3rd variable of air

730
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:42.979
pressure. And that renders the barometer and the lightning

731
00:36:42.979 --> 00:36:46.739
conditionally independent. So the idea there is just that

732
00:36:46.739 --> 00:36:49.179
it's a measure or it it might be a

733
00:36:49.179 --> 00:36:53.899
way of. Formulating a sort of a coherent guess

734
00:36:53.899 --> 00:36:56.179
at what the causal structure of your environment is,

735
00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:59.389
and it might allow you to say that two

736
00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:02.370
features of your environment are conditionally independent based on

737
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.629
this third thing. But it is purely statistical, so

738
00:37:04.629 --> 00:37:07.429
it doesn't actually determine that. It's just a way

739
00:37:07.429 --> 00:37:12.270
of formulating. A model of what these causal independencies

740
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:15.709
might be. Um, THEN the way that's used in

741
00:37:15.709 --> 00:37:18.669
the foreny literature is, so I only talked about

742
00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:21.510
a single third variable. Um, BUT if you look

743
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:23.989
at a whole network of statistical relations, then you

744
00:37:23.989 --> 00:37:27.699
get a number of different potential variables that render

745
00:37:28.149 --> 00:37:30.750
one variable independent of all of the others. And

746
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.709
all of those make up the Markov blanket. So

747
00:37:33.709 --> 00:37:36.030
they're all of the things that once you know

748
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.409
those things. Nothing else in your environment contains any

749
00:37:39.409 --> 00:37:41.050
more information about the state of the thing that

750
00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:45.469
you're interested in? The way that's then used in

751
00:37:45.469 --> 00:37:50.570
the free energy principle is because that. Because that

752
00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.050
sounds like a sort of boundary. It sounds like

753
00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:56.649
it's something that renders one particular aspect of your

754
00:37:56.649 --> 00:38:00.750
environment independent of everything else. The idea there is

755
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:03.500
that that might correspond to something like, for example,

756
00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:07.219
the cell membrane in autopoiesis. It might correspond to

757
00:38:07.669 --> 00:38:10.110
the parts of the world that bound the system

758
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:15.570
that you're interested in. Um, AND insofar as you

759
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:18.689
can only describe that kind of statistical boundary, if

760
00:38:18.689 --> 00:38:22.070
the system that you're interested in has stable, you

761
00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.679
know, the, the system needs to have statistical properties,

762
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.290
and not every system does. Um, YOU know, like

763
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:29.570
a, well, not every system has like a stable

764
00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:32.159
mean behavior, because if you think of sort of,

765
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:35.209
you know, the process of decay, there's no average

766
00:38:35.209 --> 00:38:37.699
state of a decaying system. Um, SO you can't

767
00:38:37.699 --> 00:38:40.330
describe a stable mean and, you know, standard sort

768
00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.550
of deviations from that mean. So you need a

769
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:45.750
sort of a system needs to have a sort

770
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.110
of stability in order to be described in statistical

771
00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:50.629
terms. And like the most simple example is something

772
00:38:50.629 --> 00:38:53.979
like a homeostatic system, a system that's varying around

773
00:38:54.310 --> 00:39:00.100
a particular state. Because those stable statistics are necessary

774
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.909
for you to describe the Markov blanket of a

775
00:39:01.909 --> 00:39:04.860
system, it sounds like you can sort of say,

776
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.070
because the system is homeostatic, so it has stable

777
00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:11.070
statistics, therefore it has a Markov blanket, and because

778
00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:14.030
its own behavior is creating the statistics that allow

779
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:16.149
me to describe a Markov blanket, it sounds like

780
00:39:16.149 --> 00:39:18.790
you can say the system itself is producing that

781
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:21.550
Markov blanket. So it's almost like the system is

782
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:25.239
creating its boundary. In the same way that a

783
00:39:25.239 --> 00:39:30.840
cell creates its cell membrane. Um, I, I have

784
00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.139
a lot of problems with that way of talking.

785
00:39:32.199 --> 00:39:34.639
I don't think that's a good way of, of

786
00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:37.310
capturing the notion of something creating its own boundary,

787
00:39:37.639 --> 00:39:39.280
but that's kind of the idea of it and

788
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.919
the role that it has played in the Frei

789
00:39:40.919 --> 00:39:41.469
principle.

790
00:39:42.409 --> 00:39:45.199
So what is a living agent then?

791
00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:51.959
OK, um. I think You know, there's gonna be

792
00:39:51.959 --> 00:39:57.550
so many different answers to that question, um. I

793
00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.070
mean, one thing that has traditionally been focused on,

794
00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:03.500
obviously in philosophy of biology has always been, um,

795
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.909
reproduction, um, you know, like living systems are ones

796
00:40:07.909 --> 00:40:10.850
that can produce offspring, um, that they have this

797
00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:14.739
ability to vet. They they're subject to Darwinian evolution.

798
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.280
Um, AND that that's the key feature of living

799
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.350
systems, which isn't a very good definition, right, because

800
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:22.949
it's good in general. In general, living systems do

801
00:40:22.949 --> 00:40:26.989
reproduce and have offspring, but some living systems don't

802
00:40:26.989 --> 00:40:30.310
really have a distinction between, you know, the parent

803
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.550
and the offspring. They just mutate, they just sort

804
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:36.030
of. Um, DEVELOP in ways like clonal organisms, for

805
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:38.750
instance, where they just continue to grow over time

806
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:41.419
and there's no clear way of cutting parent and,

807
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.070
um, offspring also, you know, a lot of individual

808
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.949
people just don't reproduce, and that doesn't mean they're

809
00:40:45.949 --> 00:40:48.669
not living systems. So it's not a great way

810
00:40:48.669 --> 00:40:52.449
of, um, I think the way of thinking about

811
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:57.129
living systems that I find most compelling. Is the

812
00:40:57.129 --> 00:41:00.409
idea that living systems have a very particular relation

813
00:41:00.409 --> 00:41:03.409
to energy and to their environment, that nonliving ones

814
00:41:03.409 --> 00:41:08.689
don't. And so living systems are systems that depend

815
00:41:08.689 --> 00:41:13.699
on the input of energy and matter to rebuild

816
00:41:13.699 --> 00:41:16.580
themselves to continue existing. And that is not a

817
00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.500
property of most ordinary objects, you know, like a

818
00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.389
table doesn't need anything to stick around. It's got

819
00:41:21.389 --> 00:41:24.699
a kind of intrinsic stability. Living systems are systems

820
00:41:24.699 --> 00:41:28.689
that don't have that, that. Are always dependent on

821
00:41:28.689 --> 00:41:30.870
energy gradient on energy flow to rebuild, so they're

822
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:34.889
dissipative systems is the way it's described normally. That's

823
00:41:34.889 --> 00:41:37.129
not sufficient to be a living system because a

824
00:41:37.129 --> 00:41:39.209
tornado is the same, you know, a tornado needs

825
00:41:39.209 --> 00:41:43.010
that kind of um temperature gradient, pressure gradient in

826
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:45.870
order to continue to exist, same with a candle

827
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:50.330
flame. So it's not that that property of being

828
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:52.540
a dissipative system is sufficient for a living system,

829
00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.620
but it's a very important necessary element that distinguishes

830
00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.620
organisms from other systems. And then things you might

831
00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.939
add to that are the ability to regulate that

832
00:42:02.939 --> 00:42:05.044
relationship. So that kind of adaptivity that we talked

833
00:42:05.044 --> 00:42:07.945
about before. So you have that need for a

834
00:42:07.945 --> 00:42:10.215
kind of energy flow and matter flow to continue

835
00:42:10.215 --> 00:42:13.145
rebuilding yourself, but what makes living systems distinct is

836
00:42:13.145 --> 00:42:15.344
that they can act on their environment to change

837
00:42:15.344 --> 00:42:17.465
the way that they relate to it in order

838
00:42:17.465 --> 00:42:21.020
to improve. It's their sort of position in the

839
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:24.500
environment to secure that ongoing, um, flow of energy

840
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.179
that they need to rebuild themselves. And if you

841
00:42:26.179 --> 00:42:27.750
think of something like a candle flame, a candle

842
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:29.659
flame doesn't do that. A candle flame burns through

843
00:42:29.659 --> 00:42:31.820
its energy source and then goes out. It doesn't

844
00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:35.379
like move around and find new energy sources, um.

845
00:42:36.219 --> 00:42:38.270
Oh, that's not, I would say like a sufficiently

846
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:40.510
robust definition of a living agent, but I think

847
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:43.219
those are the kind of key elements. They go

848
00:42:43.219 --> 00:42:44.949
into it and.

849
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:50.370
Uh, SO we're close to talking directly about the,

850
00:42:50.439 --> 00:42:53.159
the core issue of your book or the core

851
00:42:53.159 --> 00:42:55.570
theme of your book, the drive to survive. But

852
00:42:55.889 --> 00:42:59.610
just before that, let's perhaps, uh, also deal with

853
00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:04.850
some other specific phenomena here. What is purposiveness?

854
00:43:05.629 --> 00:43:08.500
Yeah, when you asked me about intentionality before, when

855
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.939
I talked about that sort of third notion of

856
00:43:10.939 --> 00:43:14.159
it that I'm most interested in, that's not a

857
00:43:14.159 --> 00:43:19.429
representational relationship, but also isn't. A human being linguistically

858
00:43:19.429 --> 00:43:21.689
deliberating on their goals, it's this sort of 3rd

859
00:43:21.689 --> 00:43:26.010
thing, the secret third thing, which is the. The

860
00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:28.600
tendant, the striving or the sort of moving towards

861
00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.889
something that you can fail to achieve. Yeah. I,

862
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:35.570
I would think of that as pretty much synonymous

863
00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:39.489
with purposesiveness, or at least intrinsic purposesiveness. So to

864
00:43:39.489 --> 00:43:41.129
be intrinsically purposive is to be the kind of

865
00:43:41.129 --> 00:43:42.889
system that there's a sort of fact of the

866
00:43:42.889 --> 00:43:45.600
matter about whether you succeeded or failed. I mean,

867
00:43:45.639 --> 00:43:49.000
you can also have intrinsic purposes, so most artifacts,

868
00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.679
like a laptop has a purpose, but that purpose

869
00:43:51.679 --> 00:43:53.560
is not really a feature of the laptop in

870
00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.719
itself. If there was no one else around, that

871
00:43:55.719 --> 00:43:58.280
laptop doesn't have any purpose at all. The only

872
00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.719
reason it has a purpose is somebody designed it

873
00:44:00.719 --> 00:44:02.919
to do something and I use it to do

874
00:44:02.919 --> 00:44:06.699
that thing. And in other situations, like there's these

875
00:44:06.699 --> 00:44:08.739
things where people, you know, people make furniture out

876
00:44:08.739 --> 00:44:11.340
of computer components. So you see like benches made

877
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.060
out of old MacBooks. Um, AND in that case,

878
00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.260
the purpose of that object has changed because the

879
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.100
way that people are using it has changed. So

880
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:21.860
it doesn't have features internal to that system in

881
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.229
itself that say it has to have this or

882
00:44:24.229 --> 00:44:29.179
that purpose. Whereas living systems, um, they don't have.

883
00:44:29.899 --> 00:44:33.370
I think what's special about them. Is it's not

884
00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:34.729
sort of up to you or me as an

885
00:44:34.729 --> 00:44:37.010
observer what they have to do and what counts

886
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:39.489
as success or failure for them. I can't just

887
00:44:39.489 --> 00:44:43.040
decide that what I want a bacterium to do

888
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:48.209
is to metabolize lactose, um, you know, it will,

889
00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:49.729
it will be able to do that or it

890
00:44:49.729 --> 00:44:54.989
won't, and it will either be. Um, IT will

891
00:44:54.989 --> 00:44:58.000
either support its continued existence or not, a certain,

892
00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.739
you know, nutrient. Whether, whether or not that is

893
00:45:01.739 --> 00:45:05.020
consistent with that thing staying alive is dependent on

894
00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.020
the internal properties of that system. Now, obviously, you

895
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.179
can genetically engineer these things to make them do

896
00:45:09.179 --> 00:45:13.409
different things, but it's not just up to how

897
00:45:13.409 --> 00:45:15.250
you choose to use them. There are kind of

898
00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:20.129
constraints inherent in those systems in terms of what

899
00:45:20.129 --> 00:45:22.330
they will and will not be able to survive,

900
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.090
that is quite different from mechanical systems. Mhm.

901
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:30.389
And what about goal directedness? What does that mean?

902
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:33.449
Yeah, I think I I use that in a

903
00:45:33.449 --> 00:45:35.500
similar way um to the way in which I

904
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.449
think about purposesiveness and intentionality and one of, one

905
00:45:38.449 --> 00:45:39.850
of the things that I'm thinking about more at

906
00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:45.560
the moment is this, this kind of um. TENDENCY

907
00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.580
towards a state that you can succeed or fail

908
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.310
at. I think that is very distinctive about living

909
00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:55.050
systems, but it's not anything like. The kind of

910
00:45:55.260 --> 00:46:00.000
um. I think that there's um. When I, so

911
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.550
I guess here's the thing, when I think about

912
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.389
goal directedness, I want to try and find this

913
00:46:03.389 --> 00:46:06.830
sort of middle path between two different ways that

914
00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:10.060
people have thought about it. So there's the way

915
00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:14.389
that is more common in Um, I guess probably

916
00:46:14.389 --> 00:46:16.709
in sort of, for example, meta ethics when people

917
00:46:16.709 --> 00:46:20.419
think about human action, which is that having goals

918
00:46:20.419 --> 00:46:25.270
involves explicit processes of reasoning, um, and sensitivity to

919
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:28.270
changes, the ability to change your goals, you know,

920
00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.100
if you, you could make an argument to me

921
00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:31.590
that I should change my goal and then I

922
00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:34.189
might go after a different thing than I would

923
00:46:34.189 --> 00:46:37.629
have otherwise. So like sensitivity to reasons, um. And

924
00:46:37.629 --> 00:46:41.419
that's very, a very heavyweight notion of goal directedness

925
00:46:41.419 --> 00:46:43.830
that is also quite difficult to give a really

926
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:47.290
satisfying, properly naturalistic explanation of, because it's grounded in

927
00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:50.070
things like the meaning of language. And once you

928
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:52.469
try, you know, so if you're explaining goal directedness

929
00:46:52.469 --> 00:46:54.550
in terms of the directedness of words, the way

930
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:56.909
in which words have meaning, you're kind of pushing

931
00:46:56.909 --> 00:47:00.350
the problem into language. Um, AND then there's the

932
00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.429
other notion of goal directedness, which is the way

933
00:47:02.429 --> 00:47:03.949
in which I think it's more thought about in

934
00:47:03.949 --> 00:47:07.560
the free energy principle. Which is a very cybernetic

935
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.979
notion of gold erectedness, where you can identify a

936
00:47:10.979 --> 00:47:13.280
system as having gold if it's a system that

937
00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.320
when it's disrupted from a state, regularly returns to

938
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:20.689
it. So any system that controls variations to reliably

939
00:47:20.689 --> 00:47:22.360
return to a particular state is going to be

940
00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.439
gold erected in this very, very minimal and very

941
00:47:24.439 --> 00:47:27.979
trivial sense. Um, AND yeah, one problem with that

942
00:47:27.979 --> 00:47:30.860
is that it's, it is very trivial. It involves

943
00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:32.379
saying that, you know, a pendulum can have a

944
00:47:32.379 --> 00:47:35.820
goal as much as anything else. Um, AND the

945
00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.379
standard move there is to say that's fine. Um,

946
00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.169
WE just use goal in this very minimal notion.

947
00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.060
Um, BUT it only makes sense to talk in

948
00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.379
terms of goal erectedness and purposesiveness when we have

949
00:47:47.379 --> 00:47:50.179
these really complicated systems that we can't explain in

950
00:47:50.179 --> 00:47:52.429
normal terms. So the reason we don't talk of

951
00:47:52.429 --> 00:47:55.389
a pendulum as being goal directed. It is because

952
00:47:55.389 --> 00:47:57.989
we can explain it entirely in terms of certain

953
00:47:57.989 --> 00:48:00.919
laws of motion, coefficients of friction. And when you

954
00:48:00.919 --> 00:48:05.189
have those sort of functions and um equations of

955
00:48:05.189 --> 00:48:08.270
variables, you, that's all you need to predict the

956
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:12.219
behavior of the pendulum. The reason we talk about

957
00:48:12.219 --> 00:48:16.520
goals and purposes on this account. For certain systems

958
00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.760
is not because there's a fundamental difference between the

959
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.560
pendulum returning to stability and me eating breakfast every

960
00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.560
day. It's just that because I'm so complicated, we

961
00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.879
can't tell that nice little deterministic story that we

962
00:48:27.879 --> 00:48:30.080
can tell for a pendulum. So we use the

963
00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.760
languages of goal erectedness instead. And then the way

964
00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.229
I've talked about intentionality and purposeiveness is supposed to

965
00:48:36.229 --> 00:48:39.560
be something that's in between those two positions. So

966
00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:44.600
it's not the full-fledged deliberative linguistic rational reflection on

967
00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.600
intentions that we associate with like fully fledged human

968
00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.560
cognition, but it's not this very minimal return to

969
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.840
stability that is a property of every physical system

970
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.179
either. Um, SO there are, I guess the kind

971
00:48:55.179 --> 00:48:56.520
of three main positions, I think.

972
00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.459
And from the perspective of the free energy principle,

973
00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:04.459
what does biological survival mean then or in what

974
00:49:04.459 --> 00:49:05.659
terms would you put it?

975
00:49:06.629 --> 00:49:08.979
So I, I would say that for the free

976
00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:12.409
energy principle, survival is tied to some form of

977
00:49:12.409 --> 00:49:16.250
stability over time. Um, AND the examples I've given

978
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:18.429
are very basic ones, you know, they're just homeostatic

979
00:49:18.429 --> 00:49:23.040
regulation. Um, THEY'RE just keeping a set of variables

980
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.209
in the state, in the same state over time.

981
00:49:26.689 --> 00:49:30.909
That is a very simple example. There's no reason

982
00:49:30.909 --> 00:49:34.030
that the stability that's required for survival has to

983
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:39.659
be. As, um, sort of low level, as just

984
00:49:39.919 --> 00:49:42.639
the stability of a single variable. So you could

985
00:49:42.639 --> 00:49:45.550
have something like the stability of a trajectory, um,

986
00:49:45.719 --> 00:49:48.199
so a stable rate of growth. You could have

987
00:49:48.199 --> 00:49:51.439
something like the stability of higher order relations, so.

988
00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:54.780
It's not that I always have to be at

989
00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:57.120
the same, you know, it's not that my in

990
00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.620
the internal pressure of a cell has to always

991
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.889
be at the same state, but that it has

992
00:50:01.889 --> 00:50:03.300
to be at the same state relative to the

993
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:07.929
external rest of its environment or. So you can,

994
00:50:07.969 --> 00:50:11.590
you can describe quite complicated, very complicated behaviors in

995
00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:15.250
terms of some form of stability. Um, YOU just

996
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.250
have to identify a description of what is invariant

997
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:24.879
throughout that behavior. um. And that's A very, it's

998
00:50:24.879 --> 00:50:27.000
a very physicist way of thinking, I think, because

999
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.239
the kind of the thing that you do as

1000
00:50:28.239 --> 00:50:31.290
a physicist is you try and identify the sort

1001
00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:35.199
of mathematical invariants that are preserved through all of

1002
00:50:35.199 --> 00:50:37.679
the different ways the system behaves. Um, AND then

1003
00:50:37.679 --> 00:50:39.790
you capture those in a sort of nice equation

1004
00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:43.780
that, Can generate all of those weird varieties of

1005
00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.379
behavior that to a sort of simpler mind, look

1006
00:50:46.379 --> 00:50:49.290
as if they're massive transformations and completely unrelated. You

1007
00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:53.379
capture the sort of underlying um symmetries or invariants

1008
00:50:53.379 --> 00:50:56.860
that all of that kind of variability preserves. And

1009
00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.229
I think the goal of the the free energy

1010
00:50:58.229 --> 00:51:00.699
principle is to say that for all living systems

1011
00:51:00.699 --> 00:51:02.620
there will be something like that. There will be

1012
00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.500
some sort of kind of master equation that will

1013
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.100
track that system over time that can be seen

1014
00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:14.139
to underlie. All of its behaviors. Um, AND I

1015
00:51:14.139 --> 00:51:16.620
think that's kind of that way of thinking. I

1016
00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.969
said it's very much a physicist's way of thinking.

1017
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.620
It's the way you want to try and model

1018
00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.570
the world, um, if you have these mathematical tools.

1019
00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:24.459
I the way I like to think about that

1020
00:51:24.459 --> 00:51:26.699
is that's very much tied to what you might

1021
00:51:26.699 --> 00:51:29.179
think of as a substance ontology, which is the

1022
00:51:29.179 --> 00:51:33.810
idea that any system, sorry, any system that exists

1023
00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:36.659
and has some sort of essential invariant features that

1024
00:51:36.659 --> 00:51:40.010
allow you to identify over time. But that's not.

1025
00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:43.500
That's one possible ontology. You might have a process

1026
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:46.939
ontology instead, and you might say, you know, what

1027
00:51:46.939 --> 00:51:49.449
allows something to exist over time isn't determined by

1028
00:51:49.449 --> 00:51:52.820
any invariant features. Um, BUT I think what gives

1029
00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:54.620
what gives the Frei principles claim a lot of

1030
00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:59.889
plausibility there. Is this idea of biological regulation that

1031
00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:02.939
might make you think that a sort of substant

1032
00:52:02.939 --> 00:52:06.100
substance ontology is good for living systems because they

1033
00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:09.090
are systems that contingently, it is true, do tend

1034
00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:11.179
to stay in the same states with regards to

1035
00:52:11.179 --> 00:52:15.419
some particular variables. Um, SO that gives plausibility to

1036
00:52:15.419 --> 00:52:18.340
the idea that that stability might be a sort

1037
00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.800
of principle of survival, I think.

1038
00:52:20.739 --> 00:52:23.860
And do you think that the free energy principle

1039
00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:28.909
properly accounts for the differences between living and non-living

1040
00:52:28.909 --> 00:52:29.510
systems?

1041
00:52:30.729 --> 00:52:33.500
So yeah, I, I definitely, I don't, but I

1042
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.750
think, I think there's two reasons for that. I

1043
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:40.560
think the most, perhaps the most obvious. So I

1044
00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.830
think the the way um the free energy principle.

1045
00:52:45.459 --> 00:52:47.540
So that there's loads of different people who've written

1046
00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.979
about it who have very different views and a

1047
00:52:48.979 --> 00:52:51.649
lot of people's opinions have changed over time. So,

1048
00:52:52.179 --> 00:52:54.770
um, but I think one kind of standard line

1049
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:57.219
is it used to be claimed that this kind

1050
00:52:57.219 --> 00:53:03.020
of regulation and preservation of stability was, um, a

1051
00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:05.280
definitive of a key break between living and the

1052
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.780
living systems that it was what distinguished life was

1053
00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:11.889
this homeostatic regulation. I think the very interesting thing

1054
00:53:11.889 --> 00:53:13.679
about the free energy principle is actually it's almost,

1055
00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:15.010
it sort of works as like a sort of

1056
00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:18.820
reductio where kind of revealing the absurdity of a

1057
00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:22.800
position, because when you define stability in the way

1058
00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.939
that the free energy principle does in purely formal

1059
00:53:24.939 --> 00:53:28.129
and statistical terms, if you make homeostasis a purely

1060
00:53:28.129 --> 00:53:32.340
statistical property of, you know. Having a high frequency

1061
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:34.979
of being in a particular state that's stable and

1062
00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:38.270
doesn't change over time, then that is true of

1063
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:40.780
basically every physical object in the world, um, that

1064
00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.129
we pick out, you know, every object. You know,

1065
00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:46.409
even like a sort of table will absorb heat

1066
00:53:46.409 --> 00:53:48.649
and dissipate heat, so it gets hotter and then

1067
00:53:48.649 --> 00:53:50.169
it dissipates that heat, and you can see that

1068
00:53:50.169 --> 00:53:52.310
as a regulatory process. You can see it as

1069
00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:54.850
it being disrupted and then returning to its stable

1070
00:53:54.850 --> 00:53:58.610
state. So if that was all there was to

1071
00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:01.850
being alive, um, there wouldn't be a fundamental difference

1072
00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:03.860
in kind between life and non-life. And I think

1073
00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:08.409
that is generally how people now have moved towards

1074
00:54:08.409 --> 00:54:12.100
interpreting the free energy principle. It's less a specific

1075
00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:15.330
principle of living systems, more this kind of theory

1076
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:18.750
of everything. And the difference between life and non-life

1077
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:20.860
would have to be cashed out in terms of

1078
00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.949
something like, you know, the complexity of those regulatory

1079
00:54:23.949 --> 00:54:26.590
processes. And it's, you know, it's just a it's

1080
00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:30.110
a more continuous scale and where we choose to

1081
00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:33.110
divide this is living, this is not living, is

1082
00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:36.590
more a matter of choice on that scale. Which

1083
00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:39.469
would also mean that the distinction between a very

1084
00:54:39.469 --> 00:54:43.100
complicated regulatory machine and an organism would be much

1085
00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:47.229
less significant, because they're both complicated regulators. um.

1086
00:54:48.169 --> 00:54:50.090
Uh, BUT in the book, at a certain point,

1087
00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:53.639
you talk about, I'm going to mention two aspects

1088
00:54:53.639 --> 00:54:55.370
here. I'm not sure if there are more, but

1089
00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:59.209
two aspects of the organismic manner of existence that

1090
00:54:59.209 --> 00:55:02.969
you think the free energy principle doesn't properly account

1091
00:55:02.969 --> 00:55:06.489
for. The first one is the potential for unpredictable

1092
00:55:06.489 --> 00:55:10.030
and ongoing developmental changes, and the second one, a

1093
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:14.729
precarious dependence on continual material turnover. Could you explain

1094
00:55:14.729 --> 00:55:14.969
that?

1095
00:55:15.449 --> 00:55:17.580
Yeah, no, those are exactly the two key points.

1096
00:55:17.649 --> 00:55:22.050
Um, SO the first one is, the first one

1097
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:23.330
comes back to when I was talking about the

1098
00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:25.169
idea that you can have a substance ontology or

1099
00:55:25.169 --> 00:55:29.580
you could have a process ontology, um. If you

1100
00:55:29.939 --> 00:55:32.379
think in terms of a substance ontology, the only

1101
00:55:32.379 --> 00:55:34.699
way in which it will be possible for us

1102
00:55:34.699 --> 00:55:36.979
to say anything exists over time is if we

1103
00:55:36.979 --> 00:55:41.100
can identify some invariant features that are preserved. And

1104
00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.780
importantly, I think you have to be able to

1105
00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:45.340
do that in advance. So it might be the

1106
00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:50.469
case that looking backwards, um. OK, so yeah, what

1107
00:55:50.469 --> 00:55:55.379
I'll say is um, it's. Sort of trivially true,

1108
00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.020
um, that for any process you should almost always,

1109
00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.760
once you know every sort of state that that

1110
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.110
process has entered, you can retroactively look at that

1111
00:56:05.439 --> 00:56:09.159
and discover some sort of construct something that is

1112
00:56:09.159 --> 00:56:13.320
invariant throughout that process. And you can retroactively construct

1113
00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:17.919
invariant features of the process. For us to say

1114
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:23.169
that a particular system. Actually necessarily has to preserve

1115
00:56:23.169 --> 00:56:25.100
some sort of set of stable features. That's a

1116
00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:27.260
stronger claim. We want to be able to say

1117
00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.300
that we can look at the system and know

1118
00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:32.179
in advance that whatever changes that system undergoes, if

1119
00:56:32.179 --> 00:56:34.580
it's to remain alive as the system that it

1120
00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:38.979
is, these things will have to stay fixed. Um,

1121
00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:42.020
AND we might think of, you know, your classic

1122
00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:44.610
essential variables, your sort of body temperature or your.

1123
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.760
Um, SORT of balance of chemicals within a cell,

1124
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.439
then it has to maintain this sort of level

1125
00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:52.419
of chemical balance, otherwise it will cease to exist.

1126
00:56:53.399 --> 00:56:56.360
I think what's so fascinating about living systems is

1127
00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:02.290
that. Seems to be, I think, impossible, um, because

1128
00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:06.350
of the fact that living systems. Even can can

1129
00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:08.629
change in ways that we don't state at the

1130
00:57:08.629 --> 00:57:11.750
beginning. Um, AND I think what's important here is

1131
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:14.149
often when people are objecting to the free energy

1132
00:57:14.149 --> 00:57:16.520
principle in this regard, they point to human behaviors.

1133
00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:18.600
They point to the fact that we don't just

1134
00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.469
like, you know, stay in the town we grew

1135
00:57:20.469 --> 00:57:22.790
up in and go to the same places we

1136
00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:24.389
went to when we were 14 years old, right?

1137
00:57:24.469 --> 00:57:26.389
We like explore the world and we transform our

1138
00:57:26.389 --> 00:57:29.590
personalities in ways that are completely different from how

1139
00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:33.409
they used to be. But it's not what what

1140
00:57:33.409 --> 00:57:34.790
you might then say to that is if if

1141
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:37.520
you're a defender of the free energy principle is

1142
00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.770
that that's because we're made up of lots of

1143
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:42.850
little stable units and those little stable units are

1144
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:45.139
all competing with each other, producing these kind of

1145
00:57:45.409 --> 00:57:47.850
phase transitions in behavior. It's a sort of emergent

1146
00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:51.610
phenomena in like these complex multicellular neural creatures like

1147
00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:54.870
ourselves. Um, SO I think the important example is

1148
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:58.139
the fact that you have that kind of unpretstatable,

1149
00:57:58.469 --> 00:58:02.149
um, transition in stable states and even very, even

1150
00:58:02.149 --> 00:58:06.820
single-celled organisms. Um, THE example I always really like,

1151
00:58:06.949 --> 00:58:10.830
um, is when you think of individual bacterium, individual

1152
00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:14.750
bacteria, um, they have the ability to, that's so,

1153
00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:16.709
you know, very simple single-cell system that if it

1154
00:58:16.709 --> 00:58:18.729
was going to correspond to the free energy principle,

1155
00:58:18.989 --> 00:58:21.100
we should be able to determine in advance how

1156
00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:23.750
that system has to behave in order to stay

1157
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:25.110
alive. We should be able to pick out some

1158
00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:30.469
essential, um, functions and variables. And one thing you

1159
00:58:30.469 --> 00:58:32.639
might think is if it's a glucose metabolizing bacterium,

1160
00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:34.770
it needs to maintain a stable level of glucose

1161
00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:38.989
intake. Um, BUT what a lot of bacteria can

1162
00:58:38.989 --> 00:58:41.389
do is they can pick up the units of

1163
00:58:41.389 --> 00:58:43.350
DNA from each other. Um, SO there's two ways

1164
00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:44.830
that can happen. You might have like two little

1165
00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:48.540
bacteria collide and they transmit DNA between them. Or

1166
00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.229
it might, you can also have viral retroviral insertions

1167
00:58:51.229 --> 00:58:53.919
of DNA, um, so there's tiny little viruses that

1168
00:58:53.919 --> 00:58:58.060
like DNA into other living organisms. Um, AND what's

1169
00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:59.500
really cool is like a lot of our DNA

1170
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:03.020
is potentially from retroviral insertions as well. And so

1171
00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:07.149
it's like quite a pervasive process. And what that

1172
00:59:07.149 --> 00:59:09.719
can mean is you can have a particular bacterium

1173
00:59:09.719 --> 00:59:13.429
that has only ever metabolized a particular nutrient, a

1174
00:59:13.429 --> 00:59:17.919
particular chemical, and has up till this point. It's

1175
00:59:17.919 --> 00:59:20.520
been necessary, it's been necessarily true of that, that

1176
00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.719
in order to continue existing, it has to maintain

1177
00:59:22.719 --> 00:59:25.320
that level of chemical intake. It collides with this

1178
00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:26.959
little chunk of DNA and now it has the

1179
00:59:26.959 --> 00:59:30.600
ability to metabolize a whole, it can produce a

1180
00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:33.030
whole new set of enzymes which now allow it

1181
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:35.040
to metabolize a whole new nutrient, so now it

1182
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:39.719
can like metabolize lactose. And that transforms what that

1183
00:59:39.719 --> 00:59:42.580
bacterium can do, and it can now sort of

1184
00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:44.639
live in the mammalian gut when it might not

1185
00:59:44.639 --> 00:59:47.270
have been able to survive there before. So it

1186
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:51.810
completely transforms that bacterium space of possibilities. But the,

1187
00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:53.850
the sort of factor that made that possible was

1188
00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:56.370
this little bit of this little plasmid little little

1189
00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:59.290
chunk of DNA from a different bacterium that was

1190
00:59:59.290 --> 01:00:02.250
wasn't a part of our original bacterium when we

1191
01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:05.959
were first observing it. So no amount of studying

1192
01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:09.250
that particular organism could have told us that it

1193
01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:12.020
would acquire this new ability because it wasn't latent,

1194
01:00:12.169 --> 01:00:13.489
it wasn't there was no sense in which it

1195
01:00:13.489 --> 01:00:15.570
was latent in the possibility space of that organism.

1196
01:00:16.199 --> 01:00:18.879
Um, AND I think that's to me quite a

1197
01:00:18.879 --> 01:00:21.149
really nice I think it's quite a powerful example

1198
01:00:21.679 --> 01:00:25.139
of the limits of trying to mathematically model an

1199
01:00:25.139 --> 01:00:28.010
organism in terms of sort of set of mathematical

1200
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:31.679
mathematical invariants that we can say in advance, it

1201
01:00:31.679 --> 01:00:34.969
has to be preserved to exist. Um, AND it

1202
01:00:34.969 --> 01:00:37.790
pushes you more towards this kind of processual ontology,

1203
01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.050
where you have to think about a different clearly

1204
01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:42.929
we can identity, you know, as sort of naive

1205
01:00:42.929 --> 01:00:45.850
perceivers, we're able to look at that organism, and

1206
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:48.570
even though its behaviors transformed radically, we can still

1207
01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:50.620
say it's the same organism just as, you know,

1208
01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:52.729
my parents still know I'm their daughter, even though

1209
01:00:52.729 --> 01:00:54.449
I'm very different from how I used to be.

1210
01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:56.320
And I think it's interesting to think how do

1211
01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.010
we do that then? How do we pick out

1212
01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:01.709
these organisms, these living systems over time through this,

1213
01:01:01.729 --> 01:01:05.719
um, radical change? And to me, that brings us

1214
01:01:05.719 --> 01:01:09.360
back to what autopoiesis was really about, which was

1215
01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:13.760
it's about this. THIS relation of dependence of productive

1216
01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.889
relationships, where what makes me the same person that

1217
01:01:16.889 --> 01:01:18.889
I was when I was much younger isn't any

1218
01:01:18.889 --> 01:01:21.689
invariant features that I'd preserved. It's the fact that

1219
01:01:21.689 --> 01:01:24.320
the person I am now is a direct product

1220
01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:27.719
of the behaviors and activity of that younger person.

1221
01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:32.169
So you can, you trace that dependence of productive

1222
01:01:32.169 --> 01:01:35.129
relationships over time. But to know that we're the

1223
01:01:35.129 --> 01:01:36.770
same, you actually have to be able to follow

1224
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:40.120
that. You can't just take two distinct time slices

1225
01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.409
and not look at that in between part and

1226
01:01:42.409 --> 01:01:43.929
judge whether or not we're the same or not.

1227
01:01:43.969 --> 01:01:46.169
I mean, contingently you probably can, because I haven't

1228
01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:48.489
changed that much. But in the case of something

1229
01:01:48.489 --> 01:01:50.370
like a single-cell organism, you might not be able

1230
01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:52.479
to do that. The only way to know, you

1231
01:01:52.479 --> 01:01:55.530
know, it's whole genetic configuration might have changed, and

1232
01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:57.169
the only way to know it's the same organism

1233
01:01:57.169 --> 01:01:59.320
is through following it over time.

1234
01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:04.540
Mhm. But, but then what sort of implications does

1235
01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:08.560
the instability of living systems have for how we

1236
01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.100
understand them as autonomous agents and in what ways

1237
01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:15.969
does that connect to their goal of continued survival?

1238
01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:18.489
Yeah, I think so I think the thing I

1239
01:02:18.489 --> 01:02:20.010
maybe didn't talk about as much from your last

1240
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.770
question relates to this as well, which is that

1241
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:26.610
dependence on continual material turnover. Um, SO that, that

1242
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:29.649
other feature, that in that instability comes from the

1243
01:02:29.649 --> 01:02:35.449
fact that, um, a living system is not at

1244
01:02:35.449 --> 01:02:38.250
a sort of rest state like a table. The

1245
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:41.250
reason your sort of table stays solid is because

1246
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:42.729
all of its atoms are in kind of like

1247
01:02:42.729 --> 01:02:44.929
an, an energy while they're in their lowest energy

1248
01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:48.810
configuration. And this is the kind of most stable

1249
01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:51.649
way for them to all be kind of organized

1250
01:02:51.649 --> 01:02:54.850
given the situation that they're in. And the, so

1251
01:02:54.949 --> 01:02:56.870
that doesn't mean, you know, you can't destroy a

1252
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:59.669
table. An external force could come along and pull

1253
01:02:59.669 --> 01:03:02.750
the table apart over time, you know, really all

1254
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:04.750
these sorts of wear and tear forces will eventually

1255
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:07.750
grind it down. But the table in itself doesn't.

1256
01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.370
It doesn't churn through the stuff it's made up

1257
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.709
of, and it doesn't need any inputs in order

1258
01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:16.360
to keep existing. That's very different from a living

1259
01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.919
system where all of the parts that make it

1260
01:03:18.919 --> 01:03:21.120
up are kind of degrading and turning over, you

1261
01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.639
know, like there are some organisms that can turn

1262
01:03:23.639 --> 01:03:25.669
over their entire cell membrane in just a few

1263
01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:27.959
minutes. So they, you know, they completely degrade the

1264
01:03:27.959 --> 01:03:31.520
membrane and replace it with entirely new parts in

1265
01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.629
over and over again on like a sort of

1266
01:03:33.939 --> 01:03:38.239
minute time scale. Um. And that, yeah, that's very

1267
01:03:38.239 --> 01:03:40.379
different from physical systems. That's not something the free

1268
01:03:40.379 --> 01:03:44.899
energy principle itself, for example, actually describes. Um, BUT

1269
01:03:44.899 --> 01:03:47.469
what that means, I think what's important about that

1270
01:03:47.469 --> 01:03:49.310
is that means that the way a living system

1271
01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:51.929
relates to its environment is not just as a

1272
01:03:51.929 --> 01:03:56.110
source of external disruptions and threats and things that

1273
01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:58.429
can destroy it. The environment is something that the

1274
01:03:58.429 --> 01:04:00.820
living system sort of has to reach out to,

1275
01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:04.439
um. It doesn't just respond, you know, it's not

1276
01:04:04.439 --> 01:04:06.590
like it sits there passively and then the environment

1277
01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:08.379
does something and it has to react. It has

1278
01:04:08.379 --> 01:04:12.830
to continually move out into its environment to get

1279
01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:15.439
the things that it needs. And the very sort

1280
01:04:15.439 --> 01:04:17.709
of, um, I think kind of crude way of

1281
01:04:17.709 --> 01:04:22.090
making that distinction is. If you have something like

1282
01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:24.570
a pendulum, you know, it will continually respond to

1283
01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:25.929
you disrupting it. But if you put it in

1284
01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:27.969
a vacuum and don't do anything to it, it'll

1285
01:04:27.969 --> 01:04:30.290
just sit there forever and it won't move. If

1286
01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:32.409
you put a living system in any case where

1287
01:04:32.409 --> 01:04:36.050
it's deprived of environmental disruption, it doesn't just sit

1288
01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:38.439
there, it will, you know, sort of run around

1289
01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:41.610
trying to seek things out. It will spontaneously move

1290
01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:43.050
because it will be seeking out the stuff that

1291
01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:47.340
it needs and. This, I think this kind of

1292
01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:51.330
distinction, it came up back when. I think this

1293
01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:53.689
difference between a feedback mechanism and a living system

1294
01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:57.850
is super important. And a philosopher Hans Jonas, who

1295
01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:00.870
kind of raised this exact point. When he was

1296
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:03.070
talking about a very similar set of approaches to

1297
01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:04.860
the free energy principle. So in the sort of

1298
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.949
um 40s and 50s and 60s, there was a

1299
01:05:07.949 --> 01:05:11.070
movement called the cybernetics movement, a movement like a

1300
01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:13.350
group of researchers, which was doing something very similar

1301
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:15.340
to what the free energy principle is doing now,

1302
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:21.580
trying to define um. Trying to define agency and

1303
01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:25.750
goal directiveness in terms of feedback control. um. And

1304
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:27.760
so he was, Hans Jonas was kind of making

1305
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.149
exactly the same point that I want to make

1306
01:05:29.149 --> 01:05:33.620
in response to the free energy principle. That unlike

1307
01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:36.350
a feedback control mechanism, living systems, you know, they

1308
01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:38.459
are, they have needs, they have to reach out

1309
01:05:38.459 --> 01:05:40.070
to the world to continue to exist. And that's

1310
01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:42.989
just a very different relationship that I think starts

1311
01:05:42.989 --> 01:05:47.449
to move you towards something where you are intrinsically

1312
01:05:47.449 --> 01:05:52.000
purpose, you're intrinsically goal directed because you have. That

1313
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.320
internal need that is not something that uh something

1314
01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.239
that a person as an observer has come along

1315
01:05:57.239 --> 01:05:59.520
and ascribed to you and interpreted you in those

1316
01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:02.360
terms. That's a feature of your physical makeup that

1317
01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.840
you have to sort of reach out to the

1318
01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.639
world to get your nutrients in this way.

1319
01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:10.050
And so, uh, how do we proceed from here

1320
01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:13.419
then if the free energy principle in your view

1321
01:06:13.419 --> 01:06:16.689
does not fully account for the differences between living

1322
01:06:16.689 --> 01:06:21.090
and non-living systems, uh, what kind of framework of

1323
01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:22.800
approach would do that?

1324
01:06:24.090 --> 01:06:27.040
Yeah, um, the one thing that I do think,

1325
01:06:27.729 --> 01:06:30.639
um. In terms of how we proceed from here,

1326
01:06:30.649 --> 01:06:33.129
like, one thing that I definitely am not aiming

1327
01:06:33.129 --> 01:06:34.929
to say, and obviously like I spent a lot

1328
01:06:34.929 --> 01:06:36.929
of time criticizing the for energy principle, so it

1329
01:06:36.929 --> 01:06:38.729
comes across as though I'm saying useless, get rid

1330
01:06:38.729 --> 01:06:40.129
of it, which is not what I'm saying at

1331
01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:45.060
all. Um, I think particularly the sort of. Active

1332
01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:47.340
inference modeling type stuff is really useful and I

1333
01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:52.560
think it's. Useful to say that living systems contingently,

1334
01:06:52.949 --> 01:06:54.649
one of the ways in which they happen to

1335
01:06:54.649 --> 01:06:58.330
be able to survive involves regulation. That is a

1336
01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:02.540
part of life. And it's not a necessary principle.

1337
01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:05.010
It's not something that every living every living system

1338
01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:07.929
won't, there's no guarantee that because something has been

1339
01:07:07.929 --> 01:07:09.770
stable in the past, it will be stable in

1340
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:12.090
the future. But in tenancy that's kind of like

1341
01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:14.320
our best guess. So we do tend to regulate

1342
01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.250
ourselves and free energy minimization and active influence as

1343
01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:19.489
a framework is quite a useful way of describing

1344
01:07:19.729 --> 01:07:23.370
that regulatory process. Um, SO the question more is

1345
01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:25.729
like all of the sort of stuff I've been

1346
01:07:25.729 --> 01:07:28.659
saying about these general distinctions about life and non-life,

1347
01:07:28.689 --> 01:07:31.570
if the Frei principle doesn't describe that sort of.

1348
01:07:33.219 --> 01:07:34.909
That's the thing that's kind of beneath the rei

1349
01:07:34.909 --> 01:07:37.060
principle, I think. Once you have that story, you

1350
01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.739
can put the Frei principle kind of on top

1351
01:07:38.739 --> 01:07:43.209
of it. Um, BUT what is the best way

1352
01:07:43.209 --> 01:07:47.719
to tell that story? Um, AND I think one

1353
01:07:47.719 --> 01:07:50.709
issue in an activism is the way that an

1354
01:07:50.709 --> 01:07:54.389
activism has often attempted to formulate that question has

1355
01:07:54.389 --> 01:07:59.800
been overly, overly kind of formal or abstract. Um,

1356
01:08:00.189 --> 01:08:01.459
SO when I spoke about this, this, you know,

1357
01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:03.169
you have the concept of outpois and we have

1358
01:08:03.169 --> 01:08:05.679
the concept of autonomy. And autopoiesis is very specific,

1359
01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:09.530
it's very molecular, it's cellular self-production. Autonomy is much

1360
01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:12.959
more general and is sometimes described as something like

1361
01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:18.669
a mutually independent network of processes. Um, And the

1362
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:22.419
problem with that is you can create a mutually

1363
01:08:22.419 --> 01:08:26.419
independent network of processes quite trivially in lots of

1364
01:08:26.419 --> 01:08:29.589
non-living systems. Um, SO one example is you might

1365
01:08:29.589 --> 01:08:33.270
have a robot that um charges from solar energy.

1366
01:08:34.127 --> 01:08:38.078
Um, And in that kind of robot, its behavior

1367
01:08:38.078 --> 01:08:40.639
of seeking out the sun allows it to gain

1368
01:08:40.639 --> 01:08:43.229
the energy that it needs to continue moving around

1369
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:46.469
and seek out more sunlight. So the sort of

1370
01:08:46.469 --> 01:08:50.398
the sunlight seeking behavior of that robot, um, is

1371
01:08:50.398 --> 01:08:53.648
dependent upon the solar generating process of that robot,

1372
01:08:53.679 --> 01:08:56.559
which is dependent on the solar seeking movements of

1373
01:08:56.559 --> 01:08:57.999
that robot in turn. So it looks there that

1374
01:08:57.999 --> 01:09:01.959
you have some sort of minimal. NOTION of um

1375
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:05.060
mutually dependent processes. So I think that characterization of

1376
01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:09.859
autonomy is too general and invites. Things like the

1377
01:09:09.859 --> 01:09:12.810
free energy principle to say, look, we formulated that,

1378
01:09:12.859 --> 01:09:16.549
we've we formalized that. So what's needed is something

1379
01:09:16.549 --> 01:09:19.009
that is still more general and out of reus,

1380
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:23.259
but more specific than just dependent network of processes,

1381
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:29.877
um. And I think that gets like that's not

1382
01:09:29.877 --> 01:09:32.479
something that I necessarily think that it's easy to

1383
01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:35.438
give like a single line definition of what that

1384
01:09:35.438 --> 01:09:39.679
distinction is. Um, BUT the way of generalizing outpois

1385
01:09:39.679 --> 01:09:44.430
that I like, um. I in saying what's significant

1386
01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:47.439
about that metabolic network and its relation to the

1387
01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:49.879
cell membrane, is that we have two things going

1388
01:09:49.879 --> 01:09:52.120
on there. We have constraints and we have processes.

1389
01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:57.229
We have catalysts, um. And That notion of a

1390
01:09:57.229 --> 01:10:00.470
catalyst as being something that enables something to happen

1391
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:02.990
without changing itself in that process, I think is

1392
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:06.390
really pivotal and is missing in purely a purely

1393
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:10.569
process dependent view. So the catalyst, you know, the

1394
01:10:10.569 --> 01:10:12.720
key thing about it is it remains invariant over

1395
01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:16.990
the process that it enables. But biological catalysts are

1396
01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:21.069
also on a different timescale, um, things that can

1397
01:10:21.069 --> 01:10:25.109
decay. So on the timescale of the reaction that

1398
01:10:25.109 --> 01:10:27.470
they enable, they're just these invariant features, but on

1399
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:30.220
another time scale, they're decaying, sort of, you know,

1400
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:34.500
they're precarious systems themselves that need to be rebuilt

1401
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.240
by those processes, you know, your catalysts, your enzymes

1402
01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.470
in your cells, they run out, they need to

1403
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:41.910
be rebuilt by the very processes that they enable

1404
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:45.950
by constraining those processes. And once you have that

1405
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:48.990
sort of two level relationship where it's not just

1406
01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:54.149
processes producing other processes, but things that constrain process

1407
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:56.750
but things that act as invariant constraints on processes

1408
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:59.229
on one time scale, but on a different time

1409
01:10:59.229 --> 01:11:02.189
scale of themselves kind of processual entities that need

1410
01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:04.910
to be rebuilt. Then you start to get a

1411
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:08.470
sort of more hierarchical almost relationship where you have

1412
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:11.950
different timescales at which things can either be. Enabling

1413
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:14.669
something to happen or depending upon that to regenerate

1414
01:11:14.669 --> 01:11:19.270
themselves. And that's something that you, you don't necessarily

1415
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:23.109
get that kind of hierarchical um structure of constraints

1416
01:11:23.109 --> 01:11:27.649
and processes in your more ordinary dissipative systems. Um,

1417
01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.000
YOUR things like tornadoes and um. You know, candles

1418
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.020
signs and so on, um. And that's still, I

1419
01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:37.620
think it's virtually not enough. I think being a

1420
01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:39.379
living system takes more than that. It takes the

1421
01:11:39.379 --> 01:11:43.939
ability to regulate that process as well. But putting

1422
01:11:43.939 --> 01:11:47.330
something like that kind of constraint closure account, that

1423
01:11:47.379 --> 01:11:52.640
that that story of autocatalytic or autocatalysis. Um, WHERE

1424
01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.709
you have something like a separation of time scales

1425
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:57.319
enable, I think that separation of time scales then

1426
01:11:57.319 --> 01:12:00.680
enables a new kind of opportunity for regulation of

1427
01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.319
how all of these, this network of constraints and

1428
01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:06.919
processes work together that is going to give you

1429
01:12:06.919 --> 01:12:08.990
something that looks more like a robust and less

1430
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:12.279
trivial notion of what is distinctive about living systems.

1431
01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:14.669
The the nice thing about it is that something

1432
01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:18.160
like a constraint doesn't have to be um a

1433
01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.149
single enzyme or a single molecule. You can also

1434
01:12:21.149 --> 01:12:23.109
think of constraints at much higher levels as well,

1435
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:24.740
like your body is a, you know, the structure

1436
01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:27.950
of your overall multicellular body is a constraint. So

1437
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:30.040
I think the notion of constraint has that really

1438
01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:33.580
important kind of. Generality to it that allows us

1439
01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.700
to extend out of places beyond a single cell,

1440
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:38.589
but constrained closure and the very, very precise sort

1441
01:12:38.589 --> 01:12:42.029
of energetic couplings that are involved is still very

1442
01:12:42.029 --> 01:12:46.870
specific in that, you know, an average non-biological physical

1443
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:49.319
structure isn't going to have those kind of energetic

1444
01:12:49.319 --> 01:12:49.910
couplings.

1445
01:12:51.439 --> 01:12:55.160
So, yeah, so you've already mentioned constraint closure. Uh,

1446
01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.600
IS there anything else you'd like to wear that

1447
01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.270
I might have missed in with my questions or?

1448
01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.640
I don't think so. I think that was when

1449
01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.879
you sent over the questions, I was like, I

1450
01:13:04.879 --> 01:13:06.379
feel like that's pretty much everything I could want

1451
01:13:06.379 --> 01:13:09.359
to talk about. Um, I guess one thing, the

1452
01:13:09.359 --> 01:13:11.000
only other thing that I would say when I

1453
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.669
was talking about liking this generality aspect of constraint.

1454
01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:18.569
IT'S interesting to think that that is helpful in

1455
01:13:18.569 --> 01:13:21.410
scaling up to multicellular systems, but a nice thing

1456
01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:23.930
about it as well is when we think about

1457
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:30.490
how societies operate and how societies, um, How societies

1458
01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:34.569
might be thought of as like um superorganisms. The

1459
01:13:34.569 --> 01:13:36.689
idea of a constraint also applies nicely to the

1460
01:13:36.689 --> 01:13:38.290
scale of a society as well as to the

1461
01:13:38.290 --> 01:13:40.879
scale of an organism. Um, AND it might allow

1462
01:13:40.879 --> 01:13:43.129
you, if it allows you to talk about purposesiveness

1463
01:13:43.129 --> 01:13:44.970
and normativity in the case of an organism, it

1464
01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:47.490
might also allow you to analyze that concept and

1465
01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:49.910
the notion of what is the. What are the

1466
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:52.669
intentions and purposes of the society? Is it achieving

1467
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:55.020
those intentions and purposes allow you to sort of

1468
01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:59.029
say, compare societies and say how their social structures

1469
01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:01.569
and say how they are or are not supporting

1470
01:14:01.569 --> 01:14:04.700
the viability of those societies, which is really interesting,

1471
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:08.399
um. And yeah, I think, I think that's that's

1472
01:14:08.399 --> 01:14:10.020
the sort of direction I'm interested in looking at

1473
01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:10.870
at the moment as well.

1474
01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.839
So I mean, we could scale this up and

1475
01:14:14.839 --> 01:14:19.240
apply it to understanding perhaps social phenomena and things

1476
01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.490
like human culture.

1477
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:23.490
Yeah, I think, I mean, whether or not we're

1478
01:14:23.490 --> 01:14:25.410
able to be able to really understand it, I'm

1479
01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:28.629
not sure because I think that's, it's so complicated.

1480
01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:30.790
Um, BUT at least knowing that there's some set

1481
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:33.330
of shared principles between a living system and a

1482
01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:36.140
social system, I think is really interesting. Um, IT'S

1483
01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:38.129
kind of like a quite a big Hegelian idea

1484
01:14:38.129 --> 01:14:39.770
that I'm quite interested in at the moment, that

1485
01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:43.250
the way we make sense of normativity and living

1486
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:46.770
systems and societies is very importantly similar, um.

1487
01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:51.549
Great. So let's end on that note then and

1488
01:14:51.549 --> 01:14:54.060
the book is again a drive to survive the

1489
01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:56.479
free energy principle and the meaning of life. I'm

1490
01:14:56.479 --> 01:14:58.399
leaving a link to it in the description of

1491
01:14:58.399 --> 01:15:01.479
the interview. And just before we go, would you

1492
01:15:01.479 --> 01:15:04.279
like to mention any places on the internet where,

1493
01:15:04.479 --> 01:15:06.759
where people can find you and your work?

1494
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:09.399
So yeah, um, I don't have a website really.

1495
01:15:09.450 --> 01:15:11.569
I probably should. Um, I might get one set

1496
01:15:11.569 --> 01:15:13.740
up in time for this. Um, I'm on Twitter.

1497
01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:15.810
Um, THAT'S probably the best place to find, and

1498
01:15:15.810 --> 01:15:19.459
I'll post links to anything that I write that's

1499
01:15:19.459 --> 01:15:23.330
interesting there. Um, THAT'S probably like the main, the

1500
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:26.279
main place you'll find me online. Um, YEAH.

1501
01:15:26.970 --> 01:15:29.770
Great. So, Doctor Nei, thank you so much for
