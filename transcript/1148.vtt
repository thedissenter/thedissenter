00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.170
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.849
Dis Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricard Lopez,

3
00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:08.489
and today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor

4
00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.939
Owen Flanagan. He is James B. Duke, Distinguished Professor

5
00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.649
Emeritus of Philosophy at Duke University. And today we're

6
00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.770
going to talk about his latest book, What is

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.760
it like to be an Addict? Understanding Substance Abuse.

8
00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:26.969
So, Doctor Flanagan, welcome back to the show. It's

9
00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:28.239
always a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.260
Likewise for me, Ricardo, it's always nice to see

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.579
you.

12
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.189
So why did you decide to write a book

13
00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:39.360
on addi addiction? I mean, does it relate in

14
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.759
any way to the rest of your body of

15
00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:42.270
work?

16
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.909
Yes, thank you for that question. Um, SO, um,

17
00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:51.770
well, it was a complicated both scholarly and Um,

18
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.970
personal decision. And, uh, so the, you know, the

19
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.810
main part of the backstory is that I was

20
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.689
addicted to alcohol and to benzodiazepine, so kind of,

21
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.970
uh, anxiety for, for your listeners who aren't up

22
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.599
on these things. The benzodiazepines are drugs like Valium

23
00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:14.650
and Ativan, and lorazepam, Xanax. Um, MY favorite was

24
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.669
something called clonazepam. Uh, BUT I was also, uh,

25
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.379
a, uh, alcoholic and, uh, addicted to, uh, alcohol.

26
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.790
Um, uh, FOR, uh, for about 20 years of

27
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.980
my adult life, I haven't used either one for

28
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.750
18 years now. Um, BUT I struggled like a

29
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.029
lot of people. And your listeners may or may

30
00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:44.470
not know about, at least in North America, and

31
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.639
I think this is true of Portugal and other

32
00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:52.440
countries. Uh, ADDICTIONS, uh, probably about 1 in 5

33
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.120
people, uh, uh, in the North Atlantic countries, uh,

34
00:01:57.199 --> 00:02:01.279
overall suffer from some kind of substance addictions in

35
00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:04.879
their lifetime. Um, AND about half of them get

36
00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:08.199
over them, about half of them don't, and, uh,

37
00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.800
go to their graves, uh, with a substance abuse

38
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.320
problem. Of course, for many of those people, They

39
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.279
lose jobs, they lose friendships, they lose loved ones,

40
00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:23.610
they lose sometimes pretty much everything. Um, I didn't

41
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.199
lose everything, but I lost a lot of things,

42
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.009
and I, um, I wasn't always responsible in my

43
00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:36.770
relationships, um, uh, because of my addictions. So, that

44
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.089
was the personal side. Of course, that's embarrassing. So

45
00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:44.089
I didn't want to talk about that. And, uh,

46
00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:48.080
uh, and a large part of my, uh, drinking,

47
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.750
uh, life in particular. Uh, WAS either hanging out

48
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.710
with people who like to drink like me, that

49
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.770
is excessively, or by staying away from people who

50
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.509
didn't like to drink like me and who I

51
00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:03.309
didn't want to know, uh, uh, that I had

52
00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.339
any kind of problem. So, that's the sort of

53
00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.910
personal side. But on the other side, here I

54
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.139
was, a philosopher who worked, uh, in the philosophy

55
00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.960
of mind. I mean, so I was on the

56
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.770
one hand, Between my work and philosophy of mind,

57
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.380
my interest in consciousness, self-knowledge, um, uh, the relationship

58
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.259
of the mind and the brain. Um, YOU know,

59
00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.800
this is a huge part of my work from

60
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.860
the very, very beginning. Uh, I also did a

61
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.410
lot of work early on, starting in the 80s.

62
00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:37.460
On the ways in which different psychological models explain

63
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.440
things. So, of course, we know that there are

64
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.169
computational models of mind. There are neuroscientific models of

65
00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.809
mind. There are psychoanalytic models of mind, the gestalt

66
00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.690
theories of mind. There are behavioristic theories of mind

67
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.520
which emphasize reinforcement. So I kind of knew that.

68
00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.960
I also, uh, have done a lot of work,

69
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.570
as you know, cause we talked about this on

70
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.839
the emotions. So I'm very interested in the ways

71
00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:05.850
in which we humans are not merely cognitive machines

72
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.529
or computational machines, uh, but we are emotional engines,

73
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.699
like Spinoza said, we're driven by coattas, by urges,

74
00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:18.850
by. So, here I was, I felt perfectly positioned.

75
00:04:19.548 --> 00:04:22.739
Uh, TO, uh, write a book which was both

76
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.470
scientifically literate about the latest in what the psychologists,

77
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.070
sociologists, anthropologists, and neuroscientists think about addiction, and I

78
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.589
had the insider point of view. Um, AND I

79
00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:40.160
thought it, it's something I almost felt duty bound

80
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.660
to do.

81
00:04:41.859 --> 00:04:47.839
Right. Is there a definition of addiction and does

82
00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:52.589
it, do we need one single definition of addiction

83
00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:53.309
or not?

84
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.809
Yeah, I don't think we do. Now, you may

85
00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:01.049
know, um, and, uh, I think again it's helpful

86
00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:06.170
to your listeners even, um, is that, uh, there

87
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.809
are people who are definition mongers in general, and

88
00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:13.769
sometimes philosophers are definition mongers. They'll say, you know,

89
00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:16.010
we're not gonna talk about such and so until

90
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.290
we have a definition of it. I, what I've

91
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.980
decided, uh, and, and by the way, in addition

92
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.010
to that, there are people who think that the

93
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.570
word addict is, is self-stigmatizing or and the stigma

94
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.010
stigmas are inherently bad things. We can talk about

95
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.880
that later. I think, I think some things are

96
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.049
stigmas, which just means, of course, a mark. And

97
00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:44.809
they are marked because they are negative, both from

98
00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:46.329
the point of view of the person who is

99
00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:49.799
at work has the problem, in this case, addiction,

100
00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:52.130
and from the larger community that has to deal

101
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.450
with them, workers, loved ones, family, etc. Um, THAT

102
00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.119
said, um, the, what, what I, what I think

103
00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:03.700
is, uh, suits, uh, uh, so I, I like

104
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.089
the word addiction. I think that we, it's a

105
00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:09.170
little bit like people in who are addicts. We

106
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.290
will often say, for us, it's like gay. It's

107
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.570
a word that we'll embrace. We are or were

108
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.089
one of those. Um, AND, uh, you can try

109
00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:21.529
to change the name, you can call it something

110
00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:25.369
else, you can call it substance abuse, substance misuse,

111
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.200
those are common, uh, locutions that are used lately.

112
00:06:29.609 --> 00:06:31.019
And in fact, by the way, just as an

113
00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:35.829
aside, before I answer your definition question. There was

114
00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:38.589
an amusing report by the Surgeon General of the

115
00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:42.230
United States a few years ago on addiction in

116
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.179
America. And it started out talking about addiction, but

117
00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:50.850
then a few pages in, it said, but addiction

118
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.049
is now considered stigmatizing. So we are switching the

119
00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:59.290
word to substance abuse. And then 10 pages later,

120
00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:03.609
they said, substance abuse is now considered stigmatizing, so

121
00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:07.579
we're changing the word to substance misuse. Anyway, I

122
00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:11.420
just find this ridiculous and very amusing because if

123
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:17.429
you keep trying to get rid of stigma or

124
00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:21.899
negative judgment for addiction, it'll continue forever because it

125
00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:24.940
is just a negative state. OK. So that's all

126
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.500
I've said so far, it's a negative state. How

127
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.369
do you define it though? I think the best

128
00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:31.299
way to think about it and what I talk

129
00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:34.489
about in the book. Is that the diagnostic and

130
00:07:34.489 --> 00:07:39.290
Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association has 11

131
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.950
criteria for what it calls substance abuse. Two of

132
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.910
them involve what some people think is the definition

133
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:53.309
of addiction. Which is simply increased tolerance and physical

134
00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:58.230
dependency on the drug. That won't work for lots

135
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.790
of reasons. First of all, many, many drugs that

136
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.760
are not particularly addictive. Um, IN the sense that

137
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.600
people will abuse them and mess up their entire

138
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.399
lives, people do become dependent upon. So anybody who

139
00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:17.040
takes an SSRI, that is a, uh, antidepressant of

140
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.429
that class, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Uh, CAN'T go

141
00:08:23.429 --> 00:08:26.589
off them right away or they'll have terrible side

142
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.510
effects. So you have to titrate down. So those

143
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.549
are drugs that people are physically dependent on, but

144
00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.030
we wouldn't talk about people as addicts. Almost no

145
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.030
one goes out and tries to score, uh, you

146
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:42.119
know, uh, Paxil or, uh, Prozac on the streets.

147
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.919
Um, SO we need something stronger than that. What

148
00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:47.900
are, what are the things we usually need? Well,

149
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.469
the other criteria are things like, you're obsessing about

150
00:08:51.469 --> 00:08:54.390
the drug of choice a lot. You're planning to

151
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.429
get it, you're strategizing about how to get it.

152
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.419
And then the real kickers are when you cross

153
00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:07.770
over and start to undermine your interpersonal relations because

154
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.909
of using in a way that the addict herself

155
00:09:10.909 --> 00:09:17.140
recognizes, uh, and you start to not, uh, not

156
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.270
step up to your responsibilities at work and so

157
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.760
on and so forth. So, what I call, I,

158
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.299
I think of addiction as a sliding scale. Uh,

159
00:09:26.469 --> 00:09:29.710
IF you have the 11 criteria in the psychiatric

160
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.580
manual, if you get to about 5 or 6,

161
00:09:32.789 --> 00:09:34.190
if you get to 4 or 5, you have

162
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.429
probably a moderate substance abuse problem. And if you

163
00:09:37.429 --> 00:09:40.429
get to 5 or 6, then I think you're

164
00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:42.830
a bona fide addict, although you could also just

165
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.309
say you have a severe substance misuse problem.

166
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.530
But what kind of phenomenon is addiction? Is it

167
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:58.020
a disease, a disorder, a dysfunction? What is it

168
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:03.409
exactly? Good. So, uh, these words, Ricardo, are exactly

169
00:10:03.409 --> 00:10:08.130
what are used. Some people also use syndrome, some

170
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.770
people even say it's just a habit, it's just

171
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.200
a form of habit learning like anything else is.

172
00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:15.690
You know, if you're a good soccer player and

173
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.849
you, you know, uh, then what you've developed are

174
00:10:18.849 --> 00:10:21.929
well honed habits. But some habits are bad, like

175
00:10:21.929 --> 00:10:24.250
if you are a bad, if you're a criminal

176
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.650
who, uh, loves to break and enter houses and

177
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.200
steal things, well, you've got a bad habit. So

178
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.440
addiction, some people think it's even just like that.

179
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.010
It's something you've acquired and learned and perfected over

180
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.650
time. OK, but the main candidates for the discussion

181
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:44.109
are disease, Dysfunction and disorder, as you put it.

182
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.520
I prefer disorder um for the following sorts of

183
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:55.059
reasons. So let's start with disease. So, there, again,

184
00:10:55.409 --> 00:10:58.830
uh, just like with addiction, there's no actually perfect

185
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.049
definition of any of these concepts, but at least

186
00:11:02.049 --> 00:11:06.330
one paradigm case of disease, uh, or paradigm cases

187
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.729
of diseases would be things like if a person

188
00:11:09.729 --> 00:11:11.849
goes in for a colonoscopy and finds out they

189
00:11:11.849 --> 00:11:16.000
have colon cancer. They have a disease. The disease

190
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.619
is colon cancer. If as a child, they go

191
00:11:20.619 --> 00:11:22.619
for blood work and the doctor says you have

192
00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:26.820
type one diabetes, that is a disease. The disease

193
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:32.330
of diabetes, type one diabetes is caused by insufficient

194
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.580
production of insulin by the pancreas. Colon cancer is

195
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:43.010
caused by cancer in the colon. Now when addicts

196
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:48.099
talk about their problem, their addiction. They, and they

197
00:11:48.099 --> 00:11:50.580
use the language of disease at all, which is

198
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:55.380
not all that common. They will draw the analogy

199
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.710
to what's, that is to type 2 diabetes. Now,

200
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:04.590
that's interesting because type 2 diabetes is considered a

201
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.900
disease, but it's a complicated and interesting disease because

202
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.950
it's not something you're born with, it's something you

203
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:18.549
develop and can take control of by changing diet

204
00:12:18.789 --> 00:12:23.669
and exercise. It doesn't always fix it 100%, but

205
00:12:23.669 --> 00:12:26.549
it's a way to mitigate it. So, that's an

206
00:12:26.549 --> 00:12:28.469
interest, so I think that's the right kind of,

207
00:12:28.549 --> 00:12:31.330
if you're gonna use disease talk, that's an appropriate

208
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.500
analogy. It's a funny kind of disease where the

209
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.760
agent himself participates in, as it were, the acquisition

210
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.900
of the disease and can also get back in

211
00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:49.070
and take action to take himself out of the

212
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.130
disease. So you could call it a disease. I

213
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.049
wouldn't, I wouldn't fall over and cry if people

214
00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:57.260
want to call it a disease, but I think

215
00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.969
because there is no anatomical location that's ever been

216
00:13:00.969 --> 00:13:07.690
discovered yet for addiction, that, and there's no place

217
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.729
like the pancreas that occurs. People will say that

218
00:13:11.729 --> 00:13:16.640
addiction is a brain disease. That is one major

219
00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.309
model. But as I discussed in the book. There

220
00:13:21.309 --> 00:13:24.479
isn't one brain disease that has been located yet

221
00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:28.590
that is addiction. There isn't one area that is

222
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.070
responsible for opiate addiction. There isn't one disease that

223
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.250
is alcohol addiction. There isn't one disease that is,

224
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.750
uh, uh, amphetamine addiction. It looks now to almost

225
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.719
all credible neuroscientists, as if 18 different areas of

226
00:13:43.719 --> 00:13:47.669
the brain are involved and 100 different neurotransmitters. So

227
00:13:47.669 --> 00:13:52.219
it's quite holistic. And that also usually means, I

228
00:13:52.219 --> 00:13:54.820
mean, there are some diseases which are systemic like

229
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.619
that, so it doesn't rule it out as a

230
00:13:56.619 --> 00:13:59.289
disease. But I think that the main way to

231
00:13:59.289 --> 00:14:02.700
think about, um, addiction, the best way is as

232
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:08.289
a disorder. Um, AND what's disordered? Something about the

233
00:14:08.289 --> 00:14:12.429
agents, um, plans for her life and how she

234
00:14:12.429 --> 00:14:17.989
wants to live it, uh, goals she has. And

235
00:14:17.989 --> 00:14:21.690
even Decisions she makes, so it's some kind of

236
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:26.849
self-control disorder because the addict will often say, damn

237
00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:29.330
it, I'm not gonna use, and then they use

238
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.979
5 minutes later. So that's very puzzling. Because with

239
00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:35.250
most cases of life, if you make a decision,

240
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.140
like you want to go to the movies, then

241
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.219
you go to the movies. Or if you decide

242
00:14:40.219 --> 00:14:41.580
not to go to the movies, you usually have

243
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.289
good reasons not to go. Um, BUT addicts will

244
00:14:45.289 --> 00:14:48.570
make a decision one second against using and then

245
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.409
find themselves using 5 minutes later. So that's, so

246
00:14:52.409 --> 00:14:55.890
it looks like a disorder, uh, that involves what

247
00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:59.210
philosophers might call the will, although no neuroscientists or

248
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.729
psychologists talk about the will anymore. So there's, there's

249
00:15:02.729 --> 00:15:04.369
other ways that we need to think about it.

250
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.250
But I, I guess, you know, my general thinking

251
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:12.400
is that it's, it, it matters some. Uh, IN

252
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.640
the contemporary context, whether we want to call it

253
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.039
a disease because people will say, well, diseases are

254
00:15:18.039 --> 00:15:21.390
things that people shouldn't feel guilty or responsible for,

255
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.359
and that will help remove stigma, but it just

256
00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:28.479
never happens that it removes stigma, and there is

257
00:15:28.479 --> 00:15:29.969
no disease that's been located.

258
00:15:32.289 --> 00:15:35.369
In the book, at a certain point, you refer

259
00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:42.250
to addiction as a psychobiological behavioral disorder. What does

260
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:42.989
that mean?

261
00:15:43.369 --> 00:15:46.809
Good. So, it's an attempt to, to, so here's

262
00:15:46.809 --> 00:15:49.530
what I see in the literature and why I

263
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:53.909
call it a psycho biosocial. So there was in

264
00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:58.380
1997, the head of the National Institute of uh

265
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:03.669
Drug Abuse in America, uh, a gentleman named James

266
00:16:03.669 --> 00:16:08.869
Lesher wrote a very influential paper paper called Addiction

267
00:16:08.869 --> 00:16:13.950
is a Brain Disease and It Matters. And that

268
00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.349
led, at least in the United States, to a

269
00:16:17.349 --> 00:16:20.950
funding model, which pretty much guarantees that you can

270
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.909
only get funding if you say things like addiction

271
00:16:23.909 --> 00:16:26.750
is a brain disease, and I'm trying to hunt

272
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.650
down where that disease is in the brain. But

273
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.590
as I said, 40 years out, no one has

274
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:37.159
found Any disease in the brain, what we find,

275
00:16:37.219 --> 00:16:39.859
of course, we, it's guaranteed, by the way, we're

276
00:16:39.859 --> 00:16:44.099
gonna find for any human behavior, we're gonna find

277
00:16:44.099 --> 00:16:45.650
all kinds of stuff going on in the brain.

278
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.340
It's just guaranteed. So, the fact that we find

279
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.859
a bunch of stuff going on in the brain

280
00:16:50.859 --> 00:16:53.609
of addicts is no more interesting than we find

281
00:16:53.609 --> 00:16:55.099
a lot, bunch of stuff going on in the

282
00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:58.270
name in the brains of football players or artists

283
00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:02.169
or anything else. It could have been the case

284
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.640
that we would find very specific locations for aspects

285
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.979
of addiction. And some people do think that we're,

286
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.348
we're finding some, uh, locations where craving seems to

287
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.719
occur. That might be an interesting location. And some

288
00:17:18.719 --> 00:17:22.520
people are working on medications to help with the

289
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.680
craving part once an addiction is up and running.

290
00:17:26.719 --> 00:17:30.000
But the reason I call it psychosocial behavioral is

291
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.160
first of all, addiction clearly isn't just in the

292
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.680
brain because it involves people actually using, usually, I

293
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.439
mean, they're doing things in the world, like people

294
00:17:38.439 --> 00:17:44.439
are going out. And sometimes with urgency trying to

295
00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:49.040
score drugs. Um, SO there's behavior involved. They're injecting

296
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.400
drugs into their veins. They're snorting drugs, they're smoking

297
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.280
drugs. They're doing all kinds of behaviors in the

298
00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.949
world. Uh, NOW, the acquisition process depends a lot

299
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:07.199
on which drugs are available in the culture. And

300
00:18:07.199 --> 00:18:09.800
which ones are priced right? Now, free is the

301
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.790
best, right? So if your friends have a joint

302
00:18:13.119 --> 00:18:14.839
and they're gonna share with you the joint for

303
00:18:14.839 --> 00:18:19.550
free, that's just, that's a pretty good situation. Uh,

304
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.609
AS the price goes up on marijuana, Fewer people

305
00:18:23.609 --> 00:18:27.729
use it. The price goes really high, dealers are

306
00:18:27.729 --> 00:18:31.609
doing really well, but then people who use pot

307
00:18:31.609 --> 00:18:35.729
have to get money to buy it. Alcohol, of

308
00:18:35.729 --> 00:18:39.920
course, universally tends to be authorized by the culture,

309
00:18:40.329 --> 00:18:43.030
at least up to a point. Is it priced

310
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.890
right? It just depends on how much money, what

311
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.119
your income is. Some people, money is no object,

312
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.930
other people, it's an object. So there's a lot

313
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.469
of research that shows that sort of socially, what

314
00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:58.069
you can do is if you look in different

315
00:18:58.069 --> 00:19:00.949
places in the world, you'll find that different drugs

316
00:19:00.949 --> 00:19:03.780
are the drugs of choice among young people, it'll

317
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.650
vary. So, for example, in America, we have, uh,

318
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.300
uh, amphetamines are often used in agricultural communities because

319
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.119
the work is so hard and you have to,

320
00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.390
uh, really be ready to get up in the

321
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:19.569
morning and get up and go. Um, uh, um,

322
00:19:19.699 --> 00:19:22.660
uh, ALCOHOL, of course, is the, the most widespread

323
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.819
one. Uh, MARIJUANA, you know, it depends on the

324
00:19:26.819 --> 00:19:30.290
culture. Young kids, now it's legalized in certain places.

325
00:19:30.339 --> 00:19:33.099
I don't know about Portugal. In America, in many

326
00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:36.689
states, we can have legal access to marijuana. So,

327
00:19:36.699 --> 00:19:40.060
these all are the sort of social background in

328
00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.020
terms of what makes drugs attractive, which ones the

329
00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.369
kids are using, which ones the adults are using.

330
00:19:46.709 --> 00:19:49.479
And those vary hugely. And they also vary by

331
00:19:49.479 --> 00:19:53.880
country, um, uh, uh, and in, in, in interesting

332
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.119
ways. I mean, you see, for example, the highest

333
00:19:57.119 --> 00:20:01.030
rates of male alcoholism are in countries like Russia,

334
00:20:01.609 --> 00:20:06.199
South Korea. It's an interesting one. Uh, uh, THERE'S

335
00:20:06.199 --> 00:20:09.800
no country in which women, so this is another

336
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.920
sort of, uh, sort of cultural aspect. There's no

337
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.630
country now in which women use alcohol more than

338
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:20.300
men. But there's some evidence that starting with COVID,

339
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:24.390
teenage girls in America were using drugs and alcohol

340
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.430
more than boys. So that's a demographic issue that

341
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.270
we'll have to watch for. And clearly, those demographic

342
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.469
issues are not in the brain. They're not, as

343
00:20:32.469 --> 00:20:35.500
it were. So they're all determined by large social,

344
00:20:36.189 --> 00:20:40.319
um, uh, factors beyond a person. And then the

345
00:20:40.319 --> 00:20:45.199
psychological part is just that addictions have, even if

346
00:20:45.199 --> 00:20:49.829
these things are, uh, occur in brains, addictions have

347
00:20:50.199 --> 00:20:54.839
very, very familiar to addicts, parts, components that involve

348
00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:58.790
obsessing about the drug of choice. Craving the drug

349
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.239
of choice, strategizing about when you're gonna get it,

350
00:21:02.579 --> 00:21:07.390
tamping down, uh, motivation. So there's a whole internal

351
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.949
psychological system that's up and running with respect to

352
00:21:10.949 --> 00:21:12.989
addicts. And then there are all the effects on

353
00:21:12.989 --> 00:21:16.670
self-esteem, self-respect, shame, and guilt, and these all have

354
00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.910
to be, these are partly culturally determined.

355
00:21:19.989 --> 00:21:22.619
So let me ask you now a question about

356
00:21:22.619 --> 00:21:27.729
a topic that you alluded to briefly earlier. Does

357
00:21:27.729 --> 00:21:32.520
the use of the word addict promote social stigma?

358
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:40.459
Yes, maybe, but here's the rub. So, I think

359
00:21:40.459 --> 00:21:43.780
that, uh, and, and I'm still thinking about this,

360
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.739
so this is a remaining research topic for the

361
00:21:46.739 --> 00:21:51.040
future for me. But I worry a lot about

362
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.560
what I call, you know, sort of glib inferences

363
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.400
that go like this. Oh, I know how to

364
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.719
solve the problem with the fact that alcoholics and

365
00:22:01.719 --> 00:22:07.709
drug addicts are stigmatized. Let's call it a disease.

366
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.349
Let's even say it's a disease, let's even believe

367
00:22:11.349 --> 00:22:15.680
it's a disease, and then the stigma will go

368
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:21.310
away. Now, I think there's several problems here. First

369
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.670
of all, let's just reflect for a minute on

370
00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:30.589
what stigma means. Uh, IT just means mark. Right,

371
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.510
so to have a, for somebody to have a

372
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:37.310
stigma attached to it or to be stigmatic, putting

373
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:42.060
aside, you know, religious imagery of Jesus' stigmas, uh,

374
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.670
uh, the marks of the crucifixion, just means that

375
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:50.989
it's marked as undesirable. I think we should take

376
00:22:50.989 --> 00:22:54.579
sort of a low level first. So all that

377
00:22:54.579 --> 00:22:58.510
would mean, for example, is that the behavior in

378
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.829
question, in this case we'll say associated with addiction.

379
00:23:02.719 --> 00:23:08.349
I marked as undesirable. Now, I have trouble imagining

380
00:23:08.349 --> 00:23:11.670
a world in which addiction will not be marked

381
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:16.920
as undesirable. And, and including on, not only on

382
00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.849
the part of people who are not addicts, because

383
00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:22.119
they know, for example, that if they have an

384
00:23:22.119 --> 00:23:25.819
addict who works for them, The probabilities, the base

385
00:23:25.819 --> 00:23:28.160
rates are that they'll be less reliable than their

386
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:33.030
other employees. They'll have more absenteeism, not that they'll

387
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.430
know that it's due to their addiction, but because

388
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.869
the addict will get sick sometimes and call in

389
00:23:38.189 --> 00:23:40.859
and say that they're have an illness, but what

390
00:23:40.859 --> 00:23:43.030
they have is an illness due to their addiction.

391
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:49.069
Um, ADDICTS, uh, tend not to be reliable partners

392
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:54.489
in romantic relationships, in marriages. They tend to have

393
00:23:54.489 --> 00:23:59.170
more trouble sustaining parental roles. And so on and

394
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.969
so forth. So the first point to make is

395
00:24:01.969 --> 00:24:10.150
that not all stigmas. ARE unwarranted. Uh, SO it's

396
00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:14.459
not even clear what the request that you remove

397
00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.750
all stigma from, and then you fill in the

398
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.630
blank. So, did you say, so you, so imagine

399
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:26.550
someone says, so addict is very stigmatic. Let's call

400
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:31.150
these people instead people with the disease of addiction.

401
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.660
So suppose we did that, or the disease of

402
00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.459
substance abuse. It would still be the case that

403
00:24:37.459 --> 00:24:44.540
those people are unreliable. Right. And so then we

404
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.430
would just switch to say. My friend Ernie has

405
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:51.109
the disease of substance addiction. Say, oh, I was

406
00:24:51.109 --> 00:24:54.390
thinking of hiring Ernie, you know, to, uh, for,

407
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:58.500
for a job, and you think, uh, maybe not.

408
00:24:59.579 --> 00:25:02.050
So I'm not sure that there's any mistakes being

409
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:07.930
made about marking addiction as undesirable. And from the

410
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:12.569
first person point of view, Ricardo, addicts don't like

411
00:25:12.569 --> 00:25:15.869
it usually when they're addicted. There are people I

412
00:25:15.869 --> 00:25:18.760
call in the book willing addicts. They enjoy the

413
00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.199
life, they can live it with impunity. They can

414
00:25:22.199 --> 00:25:25.319
score, you know, the highest level of heroin, maybe

415
00:25:25.319 --> 00:25:28.520
they're billionaires. Anyway, life is OK for them. That's

416
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.670
a small group of people. But for most addicts,

417
00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.880
but for most addicts, you don't have either a

418
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.339
first personal or a third personal judgment that this

419
00:25:40.339 --> 00:25:44.030
is an OK way to be. Um, SO, I

420
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.910
do think understanding more and more the difficulties that

421
00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:51.550
addicts have in controlling their behavior and being compassionate

422
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.890
and sympathetic towards them is important, but I don't

423
00:25:55.890 --> 00:26:00.329
think that removing the stigma. Is in the cards,

424
00:26:00.479 --> 00:26:06.689
nor actually do I think. We should. Mm. That's

425
00:26:06.689 --> 00:26:08.449
so radical position. I know

426
00:26:08.449 --> 00:26:11.689
that. No, no, I, I mean, that's, that's interesting.

427
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:15.170
So do you think that social stigma then it

428
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:20.800
can play or actually plays a role in fighting

429
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.650
against addiction?

430
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:25.550
Well, this is a good question, and we don't

431
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.829
have the test case to know, like it would

432
00:26:27.829 --> 00:26:31.310
be, but I do think the answer looks to

433
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:33.900
be yes. So let me give one example. So,

434
00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:37.790
um, there's a wonderful book by um uh George

435
00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:42.670
Valiant, who was a Harvard psychiatrist. He graduated from

436
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:46.910
Harvard 75 years ago. I think, I think he's

437
00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.349
still alive. He wrote a book called The Natural

438
00:26:49.349 --> 00:26:53.119
History of Alcoholism. And he was doing a study

439
00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:55.729
of all his classmates for Harvard. They were all

440
00:26:55.729 --> 00:27:00.119
men in those days. Um, AND he has just

441
00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:04.109
been gathering data over time, and he's noticed various

442
00:27:04.109 --> 00:27:06.959
things. So one thing he noticed, not surprisingly in

443
00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:10.400
that group, was that many of these men started

444
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.959
to have problems with alcohol in their 30s and

445
00:27:13.959 --> 00:27:18.810
40s. Many of them also seem to get out

446
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:22.280
of those problems. Around the time that they get

447
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.869
into them. As, as he puts it, as the

448
00:27:25.869 --> 00:27:31.790
responsibilities of family and work. Made the two incompatible.

449
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.949
But what he points out is that he says,

450
00:27:35.109 --> 00:27:37.880
I don't see any personality traits. I don't see

451
00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.949
any other traits that are, you know, aligned with

452
00:27:40.949 --> 00:27:44.260
addiction, but there is one thing, which is that

453
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.989
if you come from an ethnic group where there's

454
00:27:46.989 --> 00:27:54.270
a lot of joking about adult Alcoholism. That increases

455
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.300
the chances that you will become one. So that

456
00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:00.949
means to relation to your question about stigma, that

457
00:28:00.949 --> 00:28:06.420
in groups that don't stigmatize at all, adult drunkenness,

458
00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:11.040
you'll get more adult drunks. Hm. That's interesting, right?

459
00:28:11.329 --> 00:28:13.640
So, I don't know if that's a universal generalization,

460
00:28:13.729 --> 00:28:15.869
but the point is, so what he found is,

461
00:28:15.969 --> 00:28:19.319
he uses that to explain, so, so for example,

462
00:28:19.719 --> 00:28:24.449
the high rate of uh uh alcoholism among Irish

463
00:28:24.449 --> 00:28:27.250
Americans. So for example, and he finds that there's

464
00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.290
a lot of joking about uncles who, you know,

465
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.290
go off the wagon and do stupid things. But

466
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:37.890
that joking itself. Um, CAN open, uh, the possibility

467
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:42.329
space for enacting going off in these dopey silly

468
00:28:42.329 --> 00:28:47.420
ways that people do. Right. So the answer I

469
00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:51.369
think might, it might be yes. At least making,

470
00:28:51.979 --> 00:28:55.849
um, I mean, here's an interesting uh question. I

471
00:28:55.849 --> 00:28:57.959
think that at least in the culture that I

472
00:28:57.959 --> 00:29:01.589
live in in America, It's always been the case

473
00:29:02.209 --> 00:29:06.829
that there is not much of a stigma attached

474
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.359
to teenagers experimenting with whatever drugs there are in

475
00:29:11.359 --> 00:29:15.020
their world. It's sort of almost expected, so there's

476
00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.939
not a stigma attached to it. The parents wish

477
00:29:17.939 --> 00:29:21.589
their kids didn't use drugs early on. But if

478
00:29:21.589 --> 00:29:23.469
you're an American kid, you know that your kids

479
00:29:23.469 --> 00:29:26.880
will use pot and drink before they're legally allowed

480
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.630
to. It's just gonna go with the territory. I,

481
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.390
so I think that parents will then call the

482
00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.709
kids in and say, I really wish you didn't

483
00:29:33.709 --> 00:29:36.640
do this. I wish you waited until later so

484
00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.630
you could do it responsibly, and so on and

485
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:41.069
so forth. They're very concerned about their kids becoming

486
00:29:41.069 --> 00:29:45.290
abusers or addicts or getting into accidents. Um, SO

487
00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:48.010
I think what, you know, it's a complicated parental

488
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.339
role, especially when the drugs of choice are ones

489
00:29:50.339 --> 00:29:55.209
that the parents themselves use. But usually, the parents

490
00:29:55.209 --> 00:29:58.489
try to create a normative system which says there

491
00:29:58.489 --> 00:30:02.689
are lines that you don't cross, um, uh, and

492
00:30:02.689 --> 00:30:06.930
that will be stigmatized. But, um, but experimentation among

493
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:10.310
the young, I think is sort of Pretty much

494
00:30:10.719 --> 00:30:13.239
generally accepted as something that will happen and it's

495
00:30:13.239 --> 00:30:17.000
not particularly stigmatized, unless the kid starts to become

496
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
a drug dealer or has an addiction problem, and

497
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.640
then it is. Mhm.

498
00:30:22.199 --> 00:30:24.229
No, I, I mean, that, that was a very

499
00:30:24.229 --> 00:30:26.439
interesting point and the reason why I wanted to

500
00:30:26.439 --> 00:30:30.310
ask you about it is because, of course, if

501
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.599
Uh, to know if, if something works or not

502
00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:37.380
against a particular kind of social problem in this

503
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.750
case, addiction. I mean, we have to really know

504
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.199
what works and what doesn't, and one of the

505
00:30:44.199 --> 00:30:47.550
things that can or cannot work is social stigma

506
00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:51.439
and I was also thinking about The case of

507
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:55.449
Japan, where, of course, these are two different things.

508
00:30:55.489 --> 00:30:58.290
I'm going to talk about obesity now obesity is

509
00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:02.400
different from substance abuse, but either way, I mean,

510
00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:07.969
in, in East Asia, Japan, more specifically because they

511
00:31:07.969 --> 00:31:12.010
are more collectivistic and so on. Um, THEY don't

512
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:18.170
have, uh, uh, any problem with, uh, openly talking

513
00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:22.560
bad about, uh, fat people, obese people, and actually,

514
00:31:22.989 --> 00:31:27.869
The rates of obesity in Japan are much, much

515
00:31:27.869 --> 00:31:30.479
smaller than in the West. I mean, of course,

516
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:35.069
that's just a correlation, but still there since there's

517
00:31:35.069 --> 00:31:39.229
that cultural difference and there, uh, and there's a

518
00:31:39.229 --> 00:31:44.459
much heavier social stigma in Japan against being fat

519
00:31:44.459 --> 00:31:47.829
or obese. I mean, there, um there might be

520
00:31:47.829 --> 00:31:49.180
something there. I don't know.

521
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:52.339
Yeah, no, that's a nice example, right? Because, yeah,

522
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.739
and notice, I mean, it is true, you know,

523
00:31:54.819 --> 00:31:57.420
that the weight thing is an interesting case that

524
00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.770
you bring up. I like that because I, you

525
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.810
know, my impressions off the top of my head

526
00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.619
are, you know, we have in America now, people

527
00:32:05.619 --> 00:32:10.250
are saying 60%, 50 or 60% of people are

528
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.780
overweight and according to some medical standard or other.

529
00:32:13.989 --> 00:32:17.140
I don't know what percentage are obese. And so

530
00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.540
then we've tried to meet that. With body positivity

531
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:25.939
movements which removed the stigma, as it were, or

532
00:32:25.939 --> 00:32:30.660
the, the ideal of a, you know, a thin

533
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.979
body, we'll say. That's an interesting movement which has

534
00:32:33.979 --> 00:32:38.050
helped, I think, probably to a point people who

535
00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:41.939
are overweight, shall we say, uh, to feel better

536
00:32:41.939 --> 00:32:44.089
about themselves. I can see how that would work.

537
00:32:44.459 --> 00:32:48.780
Um, uh. Yeah, again, it, you know, one could

538
00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.939
imagine, and in fact, you know, we'll talk about

539
00:32:50.939 --> 00:32:54.939
this, people, countries that use harm reduction techniques and

540
00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:56.739
of course, Portugal, as you know, was one of

541
00:32:56.739 --> 00:33:01.349
the leading places in the world in 2001. Um,

542
00:33:01.719 --> 00:33:05.949
THAT, um, starting in 2001, that the ideas behind

543
00:33:05.949 --> 00:33:10.920
harm reduction were both harm reduction and helping addicts

544
00:33:11.439 --> 00:33:16.079
not feel as demoralized and to also be safer

545
00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:19.530
than they are. Does that remove the stigma? To

546
00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.760
a certain extent it probably removes some of the

547
00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:27.349
excessive stigma or unnecessary stigma. So I, I have

548
00:33:27.349 --> 00:33:29.430
no doubt, even though I say I don't see

549
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:31.229
how you can remove all the stigma or that

550
00:33:31.229 --> 00:33:34.390
you would want to, I do agree that there

551
00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.790
are ways in which it's just entirely counterproductive plus

552
00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:45.790
cruel. To excessively shame, guilt trips, stigmatize addicts. That

553
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.089
almost goes without saying. But I think the mistake

554
00:33:48.089 --> 00:33:50.390
at the other end is to think, oh, we

555
00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:55.459
should just remove all negative judgments about drug abuse.

556
00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.140
I think that would be a, a funny, uh,

557
00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.520
a funny thing to want or to expect.

558
00:34:02.119 --> 00:34:07.180
Uh, OK, so, can addicts stop being addicts?

559
00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:14.388
Good. So this is an interesting thing, uh, again

560
00:34:14.388 --> 00:34:17.549
that would uh push against the brain disease model

561
00:34:17.549 --> 00:34:21.309
or the disease model. You can't stop being a

562
00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:26.580
type one diabetic by willing. Or by changing your

563
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:31.158
behaviors. In other words, you can't just decide. Damn

564
00:34:31.158 --> 00:34:35.079
it, pancreas start producing insulin. They just won't do

565
00:34:35.079 --> 00:34:39.409
it. Um, YOU'LL have to take insulin from the

566
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:43.250
outside. You can't just get rid of colon cancer.

567
00:34:44.228 --> 00:34:46.889
Um, uh, BUT there are things that could be

568
00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.560
done. In both cases, you can have interventions that

569
00:34:50.208 --> 00:34:52.610
maybe will cure you or maybe make it manageable.

570
00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:58.679
What's interesting about addictions is that every day in

571
00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:04.149
every country on earth. People do, sometimes, sometimes the

572
00:35:04.149 --> 00:35:06.510
action is one of, it looks like a standard

573
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:10.399
case of will, a person just says. I can't

574
00:35:10.399 --> 00:35:14.179
do this anymore, and they are able to stop

575
00:35:14.629 --> 00:35:21.159
using. Sometimes forever. So that's an interesting thing. Most

576
00:35:21.159 --> 00:35:24.760
diseases are not like that, right? So it's a

577
00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.120
very puzzling, it's very puzzling. Now, some habits are

578
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.280
like that, so you might say, well, a habit

579
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:36.199
model will work there because sometimes people do, well,

580
00:35:36.399 --> 00:35:39.199
people stop the cigarette habit and that's an addiction.

581
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.620
Sometimes they do it in one day. There are

582
00:35:45.739 --> 00:35:50.649
Um, But a lot of people who, about half

583
00:35:50.649 --> 00:35:54.060
the people who have at least alcohol or narcotic

584
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:58.820
addiction in the United States do go for some

585
00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.820
kind of social help. And but what I mean

586
00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:07.620
by social is they join. A fellowship like Alcoholics

587
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:12.570
Anonymous. Or Narcotics Anonymous, where they go and they

588
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:16.590
sit with other people. Who have the same problem.

589
00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:19.979
And they try to help each other not to

590
00:36:19.979 --> 00:36:25.860
use. That works. The data are pretty much in

591
00:36:26.219 --> 00:36:29.459
that works about as well, a little better actually,

592
00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:34.620
the data are, than any therapeutic techniques that you

593
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.199
pay actual money for. In other words, it works

594
00:36:38.199 --> 00:36:41.290
as well as cognitive behavioral therapy. In fact, I

595
00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:43.810
think it is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy.

596
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:49.469
It works as well as uh various other ones

597
00:36:49.469 --> 00:36:51.229
which we can if you want to talk about

598
00:36:51.229 --> 00:36:53.790
them. But there are other techniques that are used

599
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:55.469
all in the sort of what you might call

600
00:36:55.469 --> 00:37:02.399
broadly psychotherapeutic. Um, CAMP. They're not typically drug use

601
00:37:02.399 --> 00:37:05.229
ones, although there are some drugs which can help

602
00:37:05.229 --> 00:37:08.879
with the cravings, as I mentioned. Um, BUT people

603
00:37:08.879 --> 00:37:13.379
do, uh, get better. Uh, IT looks like some

604
00:37:13.379 --> 00:37:16.800
people say as many as 50% of people who

605
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.139
use drugs get better. Uh, WHAT get better means,

606
00:37:21.199 --> 00:37:24.590
some of them moderate. Uh, THEIR use, especially of

607
00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:28.629
alcohol, um, some people moderate their use of other

608
00:37:28.629 --> 00:37:32.500
drugs, although that can be harder. Um, BUT yes,

609
00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:37.979
people do get better, um, uh, uh. But not

610
00:37:37.979 --> 00:37:40.149
all people get better. Right.

611
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.889
Uh, AND why is it important to listen to

612
00:37:44.889 --> 00:37:49.850
addicts? Why do we also need a subjective account

613
00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.889
of addiction to have, I mean, I, of course,

614
00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:56.330
we don't have it yet, but to potentially have

615
00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:00.909
a full understanding of how addic addiction works.

616
00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:06.489
Good. So, so sometimes we need the uh reports

617
00:38:06.489 --> 00:38:11.250
of addicts. Just to get sort of straight on

618
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:17.300
what the sort of. So The addict will experience

619
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:24.899
things like. Complete demoralization. Over the fact that he

620
00:38:24.899 --> 00:38:28.580
or she is trying to stop using, but they

621
00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:32.689
can't do it. They'll experience guilt and shame. These

622
00:38:32.689 --> 00:38:34.929
are things that you might see from the outside

623
00:38:34.929 --> 00:38:37.969
if you're a sensitive therapist or observer, but you

624
00:38:37.969 --> 00:38:39.729
might not see them until you talk to the

625
00:38:39.729 --> 00:38:42.449
addicts about how they're feeling. So it's a kind

626
00:38:42.449 --> 00:38:47.040
of a, a holistic psychological drama that they're part

627
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.810
of. And you, what you would only see from

628
00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:52.979
the outside where you're gonna watch the addict. IS

629
00:38:52.979 --> 00:38:55.379
very puzzling behavior. Like, why do they keep doing

630
00:38:55.379 --> 00:38:57.939
this? Why do they keep screwing things up? Why

631
00:38:57.939 --> 00:39:00.300
do they keep undermining their own plans? You would

632
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.139
see all that, but you wouldn't know about the

633
00:39:03.139 --> 00:39:09.820
psychological turmoil that's inside the addict, uh, himself. The

634
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.020
other reason you want the addict's testimony, I'll give

635
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.870
you an example. So in the. In the uh

636
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:21.179
what's called the big book of Alcoholics Anonymous. Uh,

637
00:39:21.219 --> 00:39:25.679
WHICH was written in the 1930s, published in 1939,

638
00:39:25.739 --> 00:39:30.330
I believe, yeah. Um, THE, uh, there's a preface

639
00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:34.689
by a doctor, Doctor Silkworth, and he says, he

640
00:39:34.689 --> 00:39:37.830
talks about craving. And he says this, he says,

641
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.719
craving occurs after the alcoholic takes the first drink.

642
00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:47.080
Now, he was not himself an alcoholic. Alcoholics actually

643
00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:49.979
realized that it does take place after the first

644
00:39:49.979 --> 00:39:52.810
drink, but it actually also takes place before the

645
00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:55.699
first drink. So it's very, very common for alcoholics

646
00:39:55.699 --> 00:39:58.449
to say that they've been thinking all day about

647
00:39:58.449 --> 00:40:00.689
using at 5 o'clock. They've just been waiting till

648
00:40:00.689 --> 00:40:02.969
they get off the clock at work, and that

649
00:40:02.969 --> 00:40:04.969
they're craving, craving, craving all the time. In fact,

650
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:08.399
they might say, my mind is completely absorbed with

651
00:40:08.399 --> 00:40:12.300
my desire for using the drug. Um, AND, uh,

652
00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:15.550
that's something that Doctor Silkworth wasn't picking up on.

653
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.469
Uh, HE didn't see that there's craving, uh, uh,

654
00:40:19.479 --> 00:40:24.729
in various, various places. There's also the reasons because

655
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:32.110
addicts can help you understand. Why they use? Now

656
00:40:33.469 --> 00:40:36.489
There are models, and again, they've usually been developed

657
00:40:36.489 --> 00:40:40.790
by non-addicts for why people are addicts. So one

658
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:44.179
is a trauma model. Roughly the idea would be,

659
00:40:44.219 --> 00:40:46.899
ah, if someone's an addict, they must have been

660
00:40:46.899 --> 00:40:52.659
traumatized in their childhood. Another model Is related but

661
00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:56.760
different. It's a self-medication model. It says, ah, if

662
00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.219
a person is abusing drugs, it must be because

663
00:41:00.219 --> 00:41:03.939
they needed some medication to control, and now you

664
00:41:03.939 --> 00:41:09.659
start to fill in the blanks, anxiety, depression, bipolar

665
00:41:09.659 --> 00:41:16.080
disorder, schizophrenia. General, any, you know, any kind of

666
00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.840
feeling that is uncomfortable, the thought is, so that's

667
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.649
the self-medication hypothesis. Then there's a third one that's

668
00:41:24.649 --> 00:41:27.810
also a totalizing one, which is something called the

669
00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:32.169
social dislocation hypothesis. This comes in very dramatic forms.

670
00:41:32.209 --> 00:41:34.370
It says, if you live in a culture which

671
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:37.409
is where there is social displacement and upheaval caused

672
00:41:37.409 --> 00:41:41.919
by global capitalism, that causes addiction. Now, these are

673
00:41:41.919 --> 00:41:45.360
all sort of highly general, and what you, but

674
00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.479
what I think is they're all true, a little

675
00:41:48.479 --> 00:41:50.959
bit of certain groups. There are people who fit

676
00:41:50.959 --> 00:41:55.239
all three descriptions. I've met them all, but they

677
00:41:55.239 --> 00:41:58.389
don't get into the particularities of particular cases, and

678
00:41:58.639 --> 00:42:01.479
there are lots of people who are addicts who

679
00:42:01.479 --> 00:42:04.300
are not traumatized in any way. I, for example,

680
00:42:04.389 --> 00:42:07.179
was not, I grew up in a very good

681
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:11.870
family, a loving family, so nothing about trauma fits

682
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:15.739
me. Um, SURE. I did use to self-medicate a

683
00:42:15.739 --> 00:42:18.739
little bit cause I was anxious, maybe, and I

684
00:42:18.739 --> 00:42:22.699
found alcohol good for that. Plus, but even then,

685
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.979
I don't know if that's the best explanation, because

686
00:42:24.979 --> 00:42:28.489
I was taught, like all boys my age, that,

687
00:42:28.739 --> 00:42:30.699
you know, when you get to high school, you

688
00:42:30.699 --> 00:42:33.739
start drinking. Girls like you better if you drink.

689
00:42:34.239 --> 00:42:37.530
You're socially more adept if you drink. And, you

690
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:39.929
know, there's a whole romantic story that was associated

691
00:42:39.929 --> 00:42:42.689
with it. It's very, it wasn't like a, a

692
00:42:42.689 --> 00:42:45.719
problem to be solved. It was something to enhance.

693
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.409
It was a little bit like people talk about,

694
00:42:47.449 --> 00:42:50.800
you know, neural enhancement or it was an enhancer.

695
00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:54.209
Um, SO I think that what we get from

696
00:42:54.209 --> 00:42:59.050
addicts is really the particular features that are idiosyncratic

697
00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:02.810
to different people. And, uh, you know, as I've

698
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:06.219
talked about in the book, One of, one thing

699
00:43:06.219 --> 00:43:13.139
about addictions is that most a plurality of addicts,

700
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:19.020
substance abusers have some comorbidity that would be diagnosed

701
00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:23.689
as a psychiatric problem. Now, this doesn't mean, of

702
00:43:23.689 --> 00:43:28.169
course, cause psychiatric problems are a little bit loosey-goosey

703
00:43:28.169 --> 00:43:31.500
in terms of how they're identified um itself. So

704
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.860
we don't always know. I mean, so is it,

705
00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:38.129
is it, you know, is anxiety a psychiatric problem

706
00:43:38.129 --> 00:43:39.729
or is it just like an ordinary problem of

707
00:43:39.729 --> 00:43:42.729
living? Uh, I don't know what the answer to

708
00:43:42.729 --> 00:43:46.489
that is. Uh, BUT clearly, but what, but for

709
00:43:46.489 --> 00:43:50.250
example, if we take something like bipolar disorder, bipolar

710
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.449
disorder only affects about 4 to 5% of the

711
00:43:53.449 --> 00:43:59.120
population. But among people with bipolar disorder, 50% at

712
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.159
least are alcoholic, and another 10% become addicted to

713
00:44:03.159 --> 00:44:06.199
other drugs. So that's an astronomically high rate among

714
00:44:06.199 --> 00:44:10.229
a group. So clearly, something's going on there. And

715
00:44:10.229 --> 00:44:12.399
we don't want to, you know, make glib inferences

716
00:44:12.399 --> 00:44:16.070
to say, ah, this alcoholic, let's look for bipolar,

717
00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.919
we want to be careful there, but, or this

718
00:44:18.919 --> 00:44:22.229
is a bipolar person. Uh, WE might worry though

719
00:44:22.229 --> 00:44:25.040
about them if they're vulnerable to addiction. And same

720
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.669
thing with schizophrenia, uh, very, very high addiction rates

721
00:44:28.959 --> 00:44:34.280
in these comorbid cases. So again, getting the particular

722
00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.560
features of the own person's psychology might help explain

723
00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.199
and help them understand the role that their drug

724
00:44:42.199 --> 00:44:45.040
of choice, at least at the beginning, was being

725
00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:49.520
used for. Usually what happens is, whatever you're using

726
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.620
your drug for in the beginning, it comes not

727
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.520
to work for that anymore, but by then you

728
00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.520
are, as we say, addicted.

729
00:44:58.159 --> 00:45:01.449
So related to my previous question, this one I

730
00:45:01.449 --> 00:45:05.370
think gets into issues that are usually discussed within

731
00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:11.570
the philosophy of science. Tell us about subjective realism

732
00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:16.060
and the expanded natural method in this case applied

733
00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.419
to understanding addiction, but you can also talk about

734
00:45:20.419 --> 00:45:21.969
it more generally.

735
00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:25.459
Good. Yeah. So I developed, uh, so back in

736
00:45:25.459 --> 00:45:28.610
the 90s when I was working primarily on consciousness,

737
00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:32.699
um, I was struck in those times, it was

738
00:45:32.699 --> 00:45:37.979
the early years of, um, uh, uh, people thinking,

739
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.300
OK, what's gonna be the relationship between the mind

740
00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:44.760
and the brain? And, uh, uh, you know, a

741
00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.850
certain group of people thought, well, what will happen

742
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:51.189
is we'll get a straightforward reduction of mental states.

743
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.320
So we'll find out eventually, anxiety is this little

744
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.600
squiggle squaggle in the brain, depression is another squiggle

745
00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.909
squaggle of a different sort. Um, AND we'll get

746
00:46:01.909 --> 00:46:06.310
rid of the psychological vocabulary and reduce it to,

747
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.909
um, a neural vocabulary. And, but what I thought

748
00:46:10.909 --> 00:46:14.060
right at, at the beginning was that the right

749
00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:17.689
way to think about the consciousness brain problem is

750
00:46:18.219 --> 00:46:20.340
not as the deep metaphysical problem, not as the

751
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:24.419
hard problem of consciousness, but as an epistemic problem.

752
00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.580
So what happened is that and this is what

753
00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:30.260
I call subjective realism. It's basically that Mother Nature,

754
00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.969
in the case of organisms like us, designed us

755
00:46:34.419 --> 00:46:38.389
so that each of us has Our own and

756
00:46:38.389 --> 00:46:41.030
only our own mental states. This is why there

757
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:44.399
is the problem of other minds. So Ricardo has

758
00:46:44.399 --> 00:46:46.709
his mental states, and I have, Owen has his

759
00:46:46.709 --> 00:46:49.790
mental states, and my wife has her mental states,

760
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.870
and my dog has his mental states, and our

761
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:55.550
mental states are private, but they also have a

762
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:58.949
public face because we make facial expressions, we're interacting

763
00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:00.360
with other people, and so on and so forth.

764
00:47:00.909 --> 00:47:05.469
But there's no mystery why subjectivity occurs to the

765
00:47:05.469 --> 00:47:10.209
individual who is having Her experiences, it's because only

766
00:47:10.209 --> 00:47:12.129
we are hooked up to ourselves in the right

767
00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:15.530
sort of way to have the conscious experiences that

768
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:19.370
we have. So, I, so I think now that

769
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:22.850
there's still this epistemic gap because it means that

770
00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:26.679
I'm in touch first personally with my mental state

771
00:47:26.679 --> 00:47:30.469
as conscious experiences. I'm not in touch with their

772
00:47:30.469 --> 00:47:34.530
neural texture at all. I have no idea what

773
00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:36.969
neurons are involved in what you and I are

774
00:47:36.969 --> 00:47:40.479
doing right now. Although I assume that my brain

775
00:47:40.479 --> 00:47:43.080
is doing all the stuff it does when it's

776
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:47.439
speaking language, comprehending language, looking at another human being,

777
00:47:47.689 --> 00:47:51.750
all those areas are active. What the neuroscientists can

778
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:55.179
then do though, if, if the neuroscientist is interested,

779
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:58.239
they could tell us what is going on at

780
00:47:58.239 --> 00:48:01.550
those lower levels, and that could be valuable because

781
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:04.510
suppose all of a sudden I wake up tomorrow

782
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:07.290
and I can't, you know, read a certain letter

783
00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:10.989
of the alphabet. Well, that happens sometimes when people

784
00:48:10.989 --> 00:48:14.439
have strokes. So a neuroscientist might be able to

785
00:48:14.439 --> 00:48:19.520
tell us exactly where in Stanislaus Dehay's letterbox part

786
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:24.100
of the brain. That something happened that dropped out,

787
00:48:24.379 --> 00:48:26.229
or the same, the same way in which if

788
00:48:26.229 --> 00:48:29.169
you have a, a stroke in which you lose,

789
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.899
you know, ability in your, to move your right

790
00:48:31.899 --> 00:48:34.459
hand, they know exactly where to look in left

791
00:48:34.459 --> 00:48:37.379
motor cortex, left side of your brain, uh, because

792
00:48:37.379 --> 00:48:41.889
we now know how moving your hand is related

793
00:48:41.889 --> 00:48:45.620
to certain set of neurons there. Now, so I,

794
00:48:45.739 --> 00:48:47.340
I think what we want to do is coordinate

795
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:52.129
the neuroscience with the psychology, the phenomenology. We also

796
00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:55.810
are not in touch with what causes us to

797
00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:57.929
have the mental states, and many of the things

798
00:48:57.929 --> 00:48:59.850
that cause us to have the mental states we

799
00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:04.290
have are outside of us. They're social features, they're

800
00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:07.810
features of our early childhood training, their habits that

801
00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:11.610
we formed inside a culture. There are emotional norms

802
00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:14.719
and scripts that we have. That are distinctive of

803
00:49:14.719 --> 00:49:17.360
our culture and that we're raised up in. So

804
00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.320
the idea of the, so the idea of subjective

805
00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.600
realism is this idea that look at, you really

806
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.709
do have the mental states you have. They're not,

807
00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.399
they're not only neural states, they have a subjective

808
00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:32.239
side to them. And only you are positioned to

809
00:49:32.239 --> 00:49:35.840
report them, we hope, accurately as the mental states

810
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.280
they are. But in order to understand you as

811
00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:41.449
a person, we need to bring the resources of

812
00:49:41.739 --> 00:49:48.330
The neurosciences, psychology, sociology, anthropology to bear to understand.

813
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:52.620
The person. So it's the general method which I

814
00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:56.899
developed for the purposes of understanding consciousness, uh, and

815
00:49:56.899 --> 00:50:01.300
I now think, not surprisingly, that it applies in

816
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:08.110
the case of Addiction, which, like many, many other

817
00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:13.750
states, is partly conscious, but partly hidden. But it's

818
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:16.909
not only hidden in the brain, like what the

819
00:50:16.909 --> 00:50:20.070
brain is doing in reward centers, say, it's also

820
00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:23.030
hidden in terms of its social and cultural history,

821
00:50:23.149 --> 00:50:26.510
your family history. We don't see all that. So

822
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:28.750
we need people to help us understand what the

823
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:32.580
social As it were, causes of addiction are as

824
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.780
well, and that takes us outside the brain and

825
00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:35.219
the body.

826
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:41.070
So in the book, you distinguish between three different

827
00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:45.540
addiction types. So there's the, the willing addicts, the

828
00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:50.100
unwilling addicts, and the resigned addicts. Why do you

829
00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:54.379
think that it matters to distinguish between these different

830
00:50:54.379 --> 00:50:56.100
types of addiction?

831
00:50:56.979 --> 00:51:01.370
Good. Well, I think that the more we know,

832
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.379
so let me, I'll say something about how to

833
00:51:03.379 --> 00:51:06.100
define these three and then maybe, uh, then I'll

834
00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:10.020
connect it to why it matters. So, uh being

835
00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:15.399
a philosopher, of course, we think that distinctions can

836
00:51:15.399 --> 00:51:18.500
matter, sometimes they don't, but this is the case,

837
00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.510
I think, where they do. So for example, So,

838
00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:26.800
uh, one reason they matter actually is that they

839
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.639
matter because of what previous people, distinctions previous people

840
00:51:31.639 --> 00:51:34.060
have made which are not helpful. So, for example,

841
00:51:34.439 --> 00:51:40.600
in the philosophical literature, Harry Frankfurt introduced, uh, who's

842
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.149
a great philosopher, recently deceased a couple of years

843
00:51:43.149 --> 00:51:47.040
ago, um, Frankfurt introduced this picture of what he

844
00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:51.459
called the willing addict. And it is a cartoon

845
00:51:51.459 --> 00:51:54.540
that actually doesn't fit very well, so what Frankfurt

846
00:51:54.540 --> 00:52:00.679
said. AND, and he's interested in will, willpower, and

847
00:52:00.679 --> 00:52:02.280
so on and so forth. So in one of

848
00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:06.939
his important papers on uh Will, where Frankfurt's model

849
00:52:06.939 --> 00:52:10.000
is basically the idea that things that are part

850
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.979
of really me are things that I That if,

851
00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:19.300
my desires that have passed inspection as good desires

852
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:22.469
are ones that are part of my freely given

853
00:52:22.469 --> 00:52:25.790
self. So he pictures a willing addict, like, let's

854
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:29.750
say, um, someone who just gets up in the

855
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:32.790
morning and thinks, My God, I'm so rich. I

856
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:36.189
have my, I, I can get my designer drugs

857
00:52:36.189 --> 00:52:37.949
from my, you know, the person who goes out

858
00:52:37.949 --> 00:52:40.629
and gets them for me, they're medical grade marijuana.

859
00:52:40.939 --> 00:52:43.000
I'm very careful. I mean, by, by the way,

860
00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:47.989
both Michael Jackson and Prince had such doctors, right?

861
00:52:48.719 --> 00:52:51.800
Um, WHO provided them with what they thought were

862
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:56.989
the perfect admixtures of drugs. Um, AND he, and,

863
00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.360
and so Frankfurt pictures the willing addict as someone

864
00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.120
who just has their life set up so that

865
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:08.810
they have no ambivalence whatsoever about their addiction. They

866
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:13.179
love their addiction, their addiction loves them. Maybe their

867
00:53:13.179 --> 00:53:15.340
loved ones aren't suffering at all from their addiction

868
00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:18.830
because they're doing it so perfectly well. Carl Hart,

869
00:53:18.899 --> 00:53:23.090
for example, who's a great psychologist and neuroscientist, uh,

870
00:53:23.179 --> 00:53:26.459
at Columbia, I believe he's still at Columbia. He's

871
00:53:26.459 --> 00:53:30.770
written some good books on addiction, and he, uh,

872
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:35.219
says of himself that he's a recreational heroin smoker.

873
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.479
And so just like my father used to come

874
00:53:38.479 --> 00:53:41.669
home from New York City and uh have 2

875
00:53:41.669 --> 00:53:46.370
martinis before dinner. Uh, AND, uh, that served a

876
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:50.090
certain ritualistic function in my family of origin. Carl

877
00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:52.610
Hart comes home after a hard day, and he

878
00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:59.199
smokes heroin. Um, SO supposing he's. He says he's

879
00:53:59.199 --> 00:54:02.340
not a heroin addict. Let's hold that aside for

880
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:05.399
now. But he smokes it regularly, and that would

881
00:54:05.399 --> 00:54:08.409
be an example of, suppose he were an addict,

882
00:54:08.719 --> 00:54:10.679
of a willing person. He's figured out how to

883
00:54:10.679 --> 00:54:12.580
do it and it's working out fine for him.

884
00:54:13.199 --> 00:54:16.639
Um, THE trouble is, those are hard to find.

885
00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.919
They're almost no, in, in, in all the literature

886
00:54:19.919 --> 00:54:23.810
I've read, There are some addicts who are in

887
00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:26.850
that vicinity, like Keith Richard may have been that

888
00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:29.169
way in his part of his life, he was

889
00:54:29.169 --> 00:54:35.010
a heroin addict, he says. Um, BUT there are

890
00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:38.090
almost no addicts who are willing but are not

891
00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:43.489
ambivalent. They're usually some ambivalence because they'll, they, even

892
00:54:43.489 --> 00:54:47.169
a willing addict will notice that he desires the

893
00:54:47.169 --> 00:54:49.830
drug at inconvenient times, like when he's playing with

894
00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:55.149
his children. He might need more heroin. Um, SO,

895
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.830
but the, but the reason to, so that's one,

896
00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:02.600
so just to clarify what the phenomenon is, like

897
00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:07.050
it's not quite no ambivalence, it's usually some ambivalence

898
00:55:07.439 --> 00:55:10.270
of a willing addict. The other reason to, uh,

899
00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.449
mark off willing addicts though, is that Nora Volkoff,

900
00:55:14.199 --> 00:55:16.860
uh, who is the head of the National Institute

901
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:21.399
of Drug Addiction Abuse in America. She says there

902
00:55:21.399 --> 00:55:24.030
are no willing addicts and and and then she

903
00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:26.229
uh another time says, I've never met a willing

904
00:55:26.229 --> 00:55:29.709
addict. But I have met willing addicts. I guess

905
00:55:29.709 --> 00:55:32.909
I know more addicts than Nora Volca does. But

906
00:55:32.909 --> 00:55:35.239
the point is there are people who say, look,

907
00:55:35.469 --> 00:55:39.280
I'm OK with this. Now, but that's not the

908
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.199
largest group of addicts. The largest group of addicts

909
00:55:42.199 --> 00:55:48.550
are what I call unwilling or resigned addicts. UNWILLING

910
00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:53.010
addicts, I was one for a long time. Um,

911
00:55:53.219 --> 00:55:55.939
I didn't want to be addicted anymore. It wasn't

912
00:55:55.939 --> 00:55:58.219
doing any of the good stuff it did for

913
00:55:58.219 --> 00:56:02.949
me when it was working. Um, IS stop doing

914
00:56:02.949 --> 00:56:05.830
that, and that's very, very common, but you still

915
00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:08.870
need to keep taking your drug, and partly this

916
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:12.949
is due to the fact that the physiological Addiction

917
00:56:12.949 --> 00:56:16.090
has, as it were now, your body is entirely,

918
00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.070
it tolerates the drug amount that you were taking.

919
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.120
It needs that amount every day or it starts

920
00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:26.520
to have, you know, uh, bad effects, heart effects,

921
00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:32.959
cardiac effects, uh, mood effects, craving effects. Um, BUT

922
00:56:32.959 --> 00:56:36.120
the addict can't see, find a way out. So

923
00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.310
that makes you an unwilling addict. You want out,

924
00:56:38.399 --> 00:56:40.719
but you can't find a way out. And many

925
00:56:40.719 --> 00:56:43.560
of those people do end up in meetings of

926
00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:47.949
Alcoholics Anonymous or other groups, and they eventually find

927
00:56:47.949 --> 00:56:52.709
their way out. They become Well, depending on the

928
00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:56.949
way one describes these things, they either become former

929
00:56:56.949 --> 00:57:00.580
addicts or they become addicts that don't use anymore.

930
00:57:00.929 --> 00:57:06.909
That's an interesting separate question. Resigned addicts though, are

931
00:57:06.909 --> 00:57:10.610
people who, they've tried again and again usually, and

932
00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:12.770
they just can't get it and they've thrown in

933
00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:15.709
the towel. So they're just resigned to the fact

934
00:57:15.969 --> 00:57:19.679
that they'll never stop. Sometimes they're wrong about that.

935
00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:22.360
So I talk in the book about a program,

936
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:24.679
and I, I think this is where the Portugal

937
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:29.010
harm reduction programs, the harm reduction programs also in

938
00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:34.139
certain American and Canadian states. Um, HAVE operated. They

939
00:57:34.139 --> 00:57:41.810
try to be especially help. The resigned addicts and

940
00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:44.760
maybe even help the unwilling addicts find a way.

941
00:57:45.679 --> 00:57:48.280
That's more successful. So here, so one of the

942
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.000
programs I talked about, um, you know this, but

943
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.290
your listeners won't. So there's a group in Amsterdam,

944
00:57:54.639 --> 00:57:57.270
uh, it's called the Rainbow Group, and what they

945
00:57:57.270 --> 00:58:02.560
do is they take Older men Who usually no

946
00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:04.800
longer have a family around them, might live in

947
00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:07.979
rooming houses, and they drink all the time. They

948
00:58:07.979 --> 00:58:12.020
might live under bridges. Um, BUT the city in

949
00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:16.000
this program, this NGO, um, offers them jobs cleaning

950
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.679
up parks. And when they arrive at work in

951
00:58:18.679 --> 00:58:21.149
the morning, so it's also a harm reduction technique,

952
00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.719
they are given a pint or two of beer.

953
00:58:24.659 --> 00:58:27.739
Because they're alcoholic. They need beer. They need a

954
00:58:27.739 --> 00:58:29.979
maintenance dose of beer. It's just like giving heroin

955
00:58:29.979 --> 00:58:34.100
addicts methadone or something like that. Um, SO you

956
00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:38.100
give them beer for breakfast. Uh, THEY work cleaning

957
00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:40.889
up the parts, you give them beer for lunch,

958
00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.659
and at the end of the day, you give

959
00:58:42.659 --> 00:58:46.209
them beer before they go off. They also get

960
00:58:46.209 --> 00:58:50.260
cigarettes, I think, if they're addicted to cigarettes. And

961
00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:53.320
they get paid a small amount of money. I

962
00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:56.129
mean, not a crazy uh minimum wage, but a

963
00:58:56.129 --> 00:59:02.280
minimum wage. Um, AND the thought is this accomplishes

964
00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:06.820
something that the culture needs accomplished, clean parks. It

965
00:59:07.149 --> 00:59:10.270
helps the addicts because it provides for them for

966
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:14.070
free like methadone would, the drug that they're resigned

967
00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:18.939
to using forever. It seems to have effects on

968
00:59:18.939 --> 00:59:22.979
them moderating to some extent. Some don't moderate, but

969
00:59:22.979 --> 00:59:24.860
some find that, oh, I can spread this out

970
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:26.100
over the course of the day, I didn't know

971
00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:27.939
that. And so if they go home and they

972
00:59:27.939 --> 00:59:30.250
drink more at night, it might not be as

973
00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:34.449
much as usual. They're also accountable, so if they

974
00:59:34.449 --> 00:59:37.489
don't show up for work, they get fired. So

975
00:59:37.489 --> 00:59:40.929
the whole idea is to create a system which

976
00:59:40.929 --> 00:59:45.719
humanely and compassionately accepts that there might really be

977
00:59:46.570 --> 00:59:52.169
some resigned addicts who've lost everything, including self-respect and

978
00:59:52.169 --> 00:59:56.290
self-esteem, who you can help make their lives safer

979
00:59:56.290 --> 01:00:00.449
for them, help build up self-respect and self-esteem, get

980
01:00:00.449 --> 01:00:06.100
a social, uh, need met. That's the idea. And

981
01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.639
I think dividing people into those groups can help

982
01:00:08.899 --> 01:00:11.860
us understand better what kind of person we're dealing

983
01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:15.139
with and what, what our social policies are aimed

984
01:00:15.139 --> 01:00:16.120
at. Right.

985
01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:21.550
But would you say that willing addicts suffer from

986
01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:22.560
a disorder?

987
01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:25.379
It's a good question. Yeah, it's a really good

988
01:00:25.379 --> 01:00:30.820
question. Um, YEAH, because if you endorse what you

989
01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:35.100
are doing, uh, then you might just say, that's

990
01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:37.689
an addiction, that's not like a disorder. I mean,

991
01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.340
so I'm open to that. The, the thing I

992
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:45.060
would say is that in my experience, even most

993
01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:51.469
you have to be Most willing addicts. HAVE a

994
01:00:51.469 --> 01:00:55.350
certain kind of impunity that tends to come from

995
01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:59.989
being really rich and being able to live outside

996
01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:05.739
the normative structure of society. I mean, you know,

997
01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:08.649
that's why Keith Richard is one example of that.

998
01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.620
But in my experience, usually when you find people

999
01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:15.500
who are, you know, major drug abusers violating the

1000
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.739
norms of drugs all over the place, um, you'll

1001
01:01:18.739 --> 01:01:21.580
find them, uh, among people who have a certain

1002
01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:24.739
kind of I mean, we have this trial going

1003
01:01:24.739 --> 01:01:27.129
on, which is a tragic trial with Sean Diddy

1004
01:01:27.129 --> 01:01:29.899
Combs, you know, who's now in America is a,

1005
01:01:29.979 --> 01:01:33.820
a rap, uh, star, and it looks like he

1006
01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.340
had was able to set up a life because

1007
01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:40.100
he's so rich with things like security services, people

1008
01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.745
who got his drugs probably they were pure. They

1009
01:01:42.745 --> 01:01:45.665
were tested ahead of time. Maybe he even avoided

1010
01:01:45.665 --> 01:01:47.385
addiction. This is a kind of different kind of

1011
01:01:47.385 --> 01:01:50.425
case. I'm not saying there was addiction involved, but

1012
01:01:50.425 --> 01:01:54.344
there was vast amounts of, uh, violation of norms

1013
01:01:54.344 --> 01:01:58.385
that involve substances, sex, and everything else, but he's

1014
01:01:58.385 --> 01:02:01.014
able to pull it off at the best hotels

1015
01:02:01.415 --> 01:02:05.864
because he is rich as God. That, that tends

1016
01:02:05.864 --> 01:02:10.215
to be, uh, a location for willing, willing addicts.

1017
01:02:10.344 --> 01:02:12.229
So it's not that common. Right.

1018
01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:17.290
When it comes to the ethics of addiction earlier,

1019
01:02:17.449 --> 01:02:23.889
we've already talked about, um, we talked about basically

1020
01:02:23.889 --> 01:02:28.330
social stigma and how people, I mean, to what

1021
01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:32.800
extent we should stigmatize addicts or to what extent

1022
01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.770
we should even use the word addict. Um, BUT

1023
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:39.760
another kind of question. ETHICAL question has to do

1024
01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:44.989
with responsibility. Is the addict responsible for their own

1025
01:02:44.989 --> 01:02:49.399
behavior or not? And more generally, what kinds of

1026
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.040
questions surrounding responsibility are to be had in regards

1027
01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.399
to addiction?

1028
01:02:56.719 --> 01:03:00.530
Good. So, this is again where I think that

1029
01:03:00.959 --> 01:03:04.199
uh in, in our attempt to think humanely about

1030
01:03:04.199 --> 01:03:06.709
addiction, we've gone overboard in the other direction. So,

1031
01:03:07.479 --> 01:03:10.840
Let's start again with things like, uh, uh, uh,

1032
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:14.429
type one diabetes. A person is not responsible for

1033
01:03:14.429 --> 01:03:18.989
having one type having type one diabetes. Now, once

1034
01:03:18.989 --> 01:03:23.649
a person has type one diabetes, then they will

1035
01:03:23.649 --> 01:03:26.590
immediately have to do things that the doctor will

1036
01:03:26.590 --> 01:03:30.300
recommend. The individual has to do those things. So,

1037
01:03:30.429 --> 01:03:32.310
you know, they are responsible as it were for

1038
01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:34.469
doing them. So even diseases, you res you have

1039
01:03:34.469 --> 01:03:39.330
responsibilities to kick it. Now, the, the, the, there,

1040
01:03:39.409 --> 01:03:41.649
there are several different locations in which we could

1041
01:03:41.649 --> 01:03:44.000
ask about an addict's responsibility. So we could ask,

1042
01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:48.169
for example, uh, is an addict responsible for acquiring

1043
01:03:48.169 --> 01:03:51.090
an addiction? And the answer to that will depend.

1044
01:03:51.489 --> 01:03:57.520
So some people, um, Uh, uh, are, say, you

1045
01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:00.489
know, trafficked, say, young people are who are trafficked,

1046
01:04:00.919 --> 01:04:04.540
uh, uh, for sex or for other reasons. Uh,

1047
01:04:04.959 --> 01:04:08.000
SOMETIMES, uh, they are introduced to drugs on purpose

1048
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.840
to get them dependent on the, um, uh, person

1049
01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.360
who's trafficking them. Um, SO that's not an addiction

1050
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.120
for which the, the person who acquires it is

1051
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:24.620
responsible. Um, uh, NONETHELESS, uh, uh, for many addicts,

1052
01:04:24.790 --> 01:04:28.590
uh, uh, there are, um, some, you know, sort

1053
01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:35.010
of social, um, their educational, um, Things that make

1054
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:36.889
them aware of the danger. So we might want

1055
01:04:36.889 --> 01:04:39.449
to say, well, you know, if along the way,

1056
01:04:39.489 --> 01:04:40.929
if you grow up in a culture which was

1057
01:04:40.929 --> 01:04:45.729
warning you about alcoholism in a useful way, and

1058
01:04:45.729 --> 01:04:49.729
you became one anyway, well, then you weren't, we

1059
01:04:49.729 --> 01:04:51.629
would say things like, you should have been paying

1060
01:04:51.629 --> 01:04:56.370
more attention. Those are various kinds of low-level responsibility

1061
01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:59.060
attributions and so on and so forth. But once

1062
01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:01.379
there's the water under the bridge and the and

1063
01:05:01.379 --> 01:05:04.179
the attic is an addict, that is, they're in

1064
01:05:04.179 --> 01:05:07.300
the grip, and they have, you know, at least

1065
01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:10.860
6 to 11 of the, they meet 6 to

1066
01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:14.899
11 of the symptoms or criteria in DSM-5 and

1067
01:05:14.899 --> 01:05:16.820
are an addict, then the question is, well, what

1068
01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:22.010
next? Now, um, what, there are a couple of

1069
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:25.929
observations I make first. One is the observation that

1070
01:05:26.209 --> 01:05:30.489
when addicts get together and talk about undoing their

1071
01:05:30.489 --> 01:05:33.370
addiction, they're trying. Imagine people who are just trying

1072
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:37.639
so far unsuccessfully, so they're unwilling addicts. They almost

1073
01:05:37.639 --> 01:05:40.159
always think that they've got to figure something out

1074
01:05:40.159 --> 01:05:44.219
themselves to do with their addiction. There they realized

1075
01:05:44.219 --> 01:05:48.139
their own agency is involved in undoing what they

1076
01:05:48.139 --> 01:05:52.649
now have as a problem. Um, AND they're seeking

1077
01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:55.010
help from other people to model their behavior on

1078
01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:58.449
these other people. They need help, but they realize

1079
01:05:58.449 --> 01:06:00.840
that they have to do something themselves or some

1080
01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:04.729
things themselves. So often, of course, some, some of

1081
01:06:04.729 --> 01:06:07.530
it is low hanging fruit. People are told, Well,

1082
01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:09.649
don't hang around with the people you use with

1083
01:06:09.649 --> 01:06:11.689
all the time. That's like one thing you should

1084
01:06:11.689 --> 01:06:15.060
start doing. Hanging around with people who don't use

1085
01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:16.860
that's another thing you should start doing. So these

1086
01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:21.689
are, these are ways of taking responsibility for oneself,

1087
01:06:22.489 --> 01:06:27.739
for oneself. Um, uh, IS the addict responsible if

1088
01:06:27.739 --> 01:06:32.929
he neglects his children? Everybody says yes. He, we

1089
01:06:32.929 --> 01:06:36.169
might be, be more sympathetic or compassionate to the

1090
01:06:36.169 --> 01:06:38.610
addict than we are to someone else because we

1091
01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:42.090
think his agency is in some sense undermined or

1092
01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:47.530
diminished, but it's not missing altogether. And almost all

1093
01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:52.449
the research shows this, that addicts do control using

1094
01:06:52.449 --> 01:06:54.810
all the time. They don't, they try not to

1095
01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.729
use at work, they try not to use in

1096
01:06:56.729 --> 01:06:59.350
front of people who will disapprove of them. They

1097
01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:03.600
schedule using, uh, to certain times and places. So

1098
01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:07.379
there's already a lot of agency that addicts maintain,

1099
01:07:07.709 --> 01:07:09.629
and they realize that they've got to leverage this

1100
01:07:09.629 --> 01:07:13.389
agency further if they want to get out of

1101
01:07:13.389 --> 01:07:16.270
the vicious cycles that they're in. So, the answer

1102
01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:22.350
is they're responsible, uh, they're responsible, and, uh, are

1103
01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:26.889
they fully, you know, Uh, do they have like

1104
01:07:26.889 --> 01:07:29.800
complete control of all aspects of the behavior? No,

1105
01:07:29.929 --> 01:07:31.370
but they don't have that for a lot of

1106
01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:33.610
things. They can't fly and so on and so

1107
01:07:33.610 --> 01:07:36.649
forth. But, um, addicts have responsibility and I think

1108
01:07:36.649 --> 01:07:42.760
that every treatment program that's successful. Treats addicts as

1109
01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.699
if they have responsibility. So I mentioned, you know,

1110
01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.030
the Rainbow Group in Amsterdam, if they don't show

1111
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:53.409
up for work, they get fired. If you're in

1112
01:07:53.409 --> 01:07:57.449
a therapeutic community, Hannah Picard, uh, who has a

1113
01:07:57.449 --> 01:07:58.850
book coming out in a year, you want to

1114
01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:02.399
talk to her, called The Puzzle of Addiction. Uh,

1115
01:08:02.449 --> 01:08:06.409
Hannah worked in, um, uh, therapeutic communities in England

1116
01:08:06.409 --> 01:08:10.409
with addicts. And in those therapeutic communities, everybody lives

1117
01:08:10.409 --> 01:08:13.850
together, um, and the addicts are not allowed to

1118
01:08:13.850 --> 01:08:16.129
use. And if they don't, if they use, there

1119
01:08:16.129 --> 01:08:20.169
are consequences. They lose certain privileges, for example. They

1120
01:08:20.169 --> 01:08:26.370
can't go out. So, there are always consequences, um,

1121
01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:30.930
and these consequences, I think, uh, show that their

1122
01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:33.439
expectations which are reasonable, that can be placed on

1123
01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:37.649
addicts, and often addicts place these expectations on themselves.

1124
01:08:39.469 --> 01:08:42.429
So, I have one last question or one last

1125
01:08:42.429 --> 01:08:45.038
topic that I would like to explore with you

1126
01:08:45.038 --> 01:08:49.837
today in regards to addiction. So among the treatments

1127
01:08:49.837 --> 01:08:53.837
that are currently available, which are the best ones?

1128
01:08:53.849 --> 01:08:57.318
And I would like also to hear from you

1129
01:08:57.318 --> 01:09:02.118
about the method used by Alcoholics Anonymous. Does it

1130
01:09:02.118 --> 01:09:03.587
work or not?

1131
01:09:03.877 --> 01:09:07.020
OK. So good. So this is what, you know,

1132
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.899
one of the things in the book that I

1133
01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:14.490
do, as you know, is I um suggest that

1134
01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:21.020
um we need to be careful, um, so, so

1135
01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:24.580
several things. OK. So some people distinguish between two

1136
01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:27.339
large classes of addictions. On the one hand, there

1137
01:09:27.339 --> 01:09:31.318
are substance addictions. Which are to like what we're

1138
01:09:31.318 --> 01:09:33.599
assuming today, we're, that's what I talk about mostly

1139
01:09:33.599 --> 01:09:38.818
in the book, um, to familiar substances like amphetamines,

1140
01:09:39.238 --> 01:09:44.490
uh, alcohol, heroin, cocaine. Uh, SOME people think there

1141
01:09:44.490 --> 01:09:47.959
is cannabis addiction, some people think there isn't. Um,

1142
01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:51.350
um, THEN there's food. Of course, food is a

1143
01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:56.529
really complicated, it's a substance, but we don't think

1144
01:09:56.529 --> 01:09:59.330
that, for example, you can abstain from food, which

1145
01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:03.450
is the technique that Alcoholics Anonymous uses. Um, AND

1146
01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:06.890
so, one of the things I recommend is you

1147
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:10.129
need to focus substance by substance on the needs

1148
01:10:10.129 --> 01:10:14.169
of, uh, as it were, detoxing people and making

1149
01:10:14.169 --> 01:10:18.040
them adjust again. So, um, uh, then there are

1150
01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.939
behavioral addictions, of course, things like sex addiction, gambling

1151
01:10:20.939 --> 01:10:24.609
addiction. Uh, SOME people think there's addiction to your

1152
01:10:24.609 --> 01:10:29.049
phone, probably is. Um, SOCIAL media addictions. Uh, ANYWAY,

1153
01:10:29.129 --> 01:10:32.720
I'm not talking about those. The, um, With respect

1154
01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.270
to drugs, as I said at first, there's not,

1155
01:10:36.359 --> 01:10:40.479
even though since 1997, there's been this motto out

1156
01:10:40.479 --> 01:10:43.040
there that addiction is a brain disease and it

1157
01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.080
matters, there actually isn't one brain disease that has

1158
01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:53.839
identified by anyone. Anyone. That is addiction. Now what

1159
01:10:53.839 --> 01:10:58.020
there is, though, with respect to, for example, cocaine.

1160
01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:00.689
There's a lot of research on the way in

1161
01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:05.520
which one set of neurotransmitters get really ramped up,

1162
01:11:05.609 --> 01:11:09.009
and those are mostly in the dopamines. There's everybody

1163
01:11:09.009 --> 01:11:14.450
hears about the dopamine system. Um, HOWEVER, dopamine is

1164
01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:17.689
less involved with alcohol and it's less involved with

1165
01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:22.009
opiates. So there isn't like one sort of type

1166
01:11:22.009 --> 01:11:25.810
of neurotransmitter even to. Uh, THING. So with respect

1167
01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:28.729
to, uh, addictions, we need to go one by

1168
01:11:28.729 --> 01:11:31.370
one. OK, so let's start with opioids. So if

1169
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:34.850
a person is a heroin addict or a fentanyl

1170
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:39.299
addict, Or OxyContin prescription drug addicts, there's lots of

1171
01:11:39.299 --> 01:11:44.200
those. It, it looks like it's a smart idea

1172
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:50.129
not to ask people to abstain completely. Especially at

1173
01:11:50.129 --> 01:11:54.970
first, but instead to take a substitute opioid like

1174
01:11:54.970 --> 01:12:02.319
methadone or uh buprenorphine, those are both themselves opiates,

1175
01:12:02.649 --> 01:12:07.459
but they have less hedonic effect than heroin or

1176
01:12:07.459 --> 01:12:11.600
fentanyl. When I say hedonic, not only won't you

1177
01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.919
feel happy, joy, joy, click your heels, but you

1178
01:12:14.919 --> 01:12:16.959
also won't space out if you take these at

1179
01:12:16.959 --> 01:12:19.919
the right doses. So you'll, you'll be present for

1180
01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:23.430
life. Now, the reason these are important is that,

1181
01:12:23.629 --> 01:12:28.439
that if you are addicted to opiates, And you

1182
01:12:28.439 --> 01:12:32.669
have a relapse after a month and take what

1183
01:12:32.669 --> 01:12:36.750
you used to take, the amount might kill you

1184
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:44.180
because your body has quickly Unraveled your tolerance. So,

1185
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:48.509
if you go back out after taking heroin and

1186
01:12:48.509 --> 01:12:51.470
use the same amount of heroin, then you actually

1187
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:53.830
might, your respiration might stop. And that's why we

1188
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:56.819
have drugs like Narcan to wake you up again.

1189
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:58.750
But it's a serious problem, and a lot of

1190
01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:05.520
overdoses occur when Opiate addicts go back out. So

1191
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.200
these are very useful drugs for um uh people

1192
01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.959
with opioids. Uh, AND, and what that means in

1193
01:13:12.959 --> 01:13:16.290
part is that like, so you, you may or

1194
01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:20.140
may not know this, but Alcoholics Anonymous. Often has,

1195
01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.359
it has offshoots, so there are places called Narcotics

1196
01:13:23.359 --> 01:13:28.240
Anonymous. There's even Cocaine Anonymous I've seen around. There's

1197
01:13:28.759 --> 01:13:32.120
so those sometimes will gather people together who are

1198
01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.759
trying to get the same kind of help that

1199
01:13:33.759 --> 01:13:37.160
Alcoholics Anonymous gives, but for different drugs. But also

1200
01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:41.919
in the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous, nowadays, many, many

1201
01:13:41.919 --> 01:13:47.040
people use other drugs besides alcohol. So you'll have

1202
01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.560
heroin addicts who are also alcoholic, uh, and many

1203
01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.779
people will introduce themselves that way. Um, SO that

1204
01:13:54.779 --> 01:13:57.799
means that, that Alcoholics Anonymous, which says that you

1205
01:13:57.799 --> 01:14:02.970
need to abstain from alcohol, isn't as useful to

1206
01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:05.839
opioid addicts because they need to take an opioid,

1207
01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:08.279
at least for a while till they know they're

1208
01:14:08.279 --> 01:14:11.479
safe and clear, and those are the substance opioids.

1209
01:14:12.279 --> 01:14:16.569
Um, THERE are some other, so those two drugs,

1210
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:20.339
as well as there's some other drugs which also

1211
01:14:20.339 --> 01:14:25.100
help with um blocking opioid receptors, things like naltrexone,

1212
01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:31.549
Corosate, naloxone. Those can be, all of those drugs

1213
01:14:31.549 --> 01:14:35.319
in weird ways seem to have effects that diminish

1214
01:14:35.319 --> 01:14:41.339
craving also for alcohol. That's a side effect as

1215
01:14:41.339 --> 01:14:44.220
they say that they have. Now, that's interesting because

1216
01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:47.779
that means that they probably should be prescribed more

1217
01:14:47.779 --> 01:14:52.680
for alcoholics to again help them through. The early

1218
01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.500
stages of, if they want to not use at

1219
01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.180
all, to not use. So there's a whole bunch

1220
01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:01.359
of drugs now. They all, don't treat a disease,

1221
01:15:01.459 --> 01:15:06.500
they treat craving, which is a effect. No, craving

1222
01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:09.299
isn't the addiction. Craving is a consequence of becoming

1223
01:15:09.299 --> 01:15:13.140
addicted. Uh, BUT those are, those are increasingly good

1224
01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.580
drugs. And, and you may have read, um, recently

1225
01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:21.330
that these Ozemppec and these other weight loss drugs.

1226
01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:24.810
That are being used, which uh uh what they

1227
01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:28.500
do is they control a peptide uh called GLP

1228
01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:34.069
one. Uh, METABOLICALLY gets, gets into the brain, but

1229
01:15:34.069 --> 01:15:37.270
people who take that also claim that they have

1230
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:40.390
less desire for other drugs of addiction, which is

1231
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:42.759
an interesting and important result. So that would yet

1232
01:15:42.759 --> 01:15:45.750
be another drug that people could take, not for

1233
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:50.020
diabetes or weight loss, but to diminish desire for,

1234
01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:53.390
uh, addictive drugs. So that's an area where we

1235
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:57.000
should expect there to be Um, uh, more and

1236
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.569
more development of drugs or more recognition of the

1237
01:16:00.569 --> 01:16:05.509
usefulness of these drugs, uh, to help people sustain

1238
01:16:05.509 --> 01:16:09.169
recovery. Because, as you know, some people define addictions

1239
01:16:09.529 --> 01:16:15.169
as a chronic and relapsing disease, but not everybody

1240
01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:16.160
relapses.

1241
01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:21.899
Right. So that's all very interesting and very informative

1242
01:16:21.899 --> 01:16:24.779
and the book is again, what is it like

1243
01:16:24.779 --> 01:16:28.859
to be an addict, understanding substance abuse. Of course,

1244
01:16:28.899 --> 01:16:31.740
I'm leaving a link to it in the description

1245
01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:36.700
below. And Doctor Flanagan, where can people find your

1246
01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.819
work on the internet if they're interested?

1247
01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:42.600
Uh, I'm, I'm old fashioned. There's almost no place

1248
01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.830
to find. You just have to go on Amazon

1249
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:47.310
and buy the book. Um.

1250
01:16:48.899 --> 01:16:51.899
No, that's perfectly fine. So, uh, as I said,

1251
01:16:51.979 --> 01:16:53.879
I will be leaving a link to it and

1252
01:16:53.879 --> 01:16:56.220
thank you so much again for taking the time
