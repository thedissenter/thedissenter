00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:03.210
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.130
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:09.609
joined by Doctor Costas Karaki. He is author and

4
00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:12.739
editor of several books on science. He works at

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.989
the teacher training institute and the section of Biology

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.850
at the University of Geneva. And today we're focusing

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.290
on his latest book, Ancestry Reimagined, Dismantling the Myth

8
00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:29.479
of Genetic Ethnicity. So, Doctor Kore is welcome to

9
00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.530
the show. It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.930
Thank you very much. I'm delighted to be here.

11
00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:35.330
Thank you for the invitation.

12
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.349
So to get into the book, then you talk

13
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.209
a lot about uh information that people can get

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.229
from DNA ancestry testing and how they interpret it.

15
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.259
So, first of all, what is DNA ancestry testing

16
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.939
and what are some of the main technologies out

17
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.409
there available?

18
00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:02.560
Yeah. So DNA ancestry testing is similar to the

19
00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:06.819
DNA testing we do for health. Uh It is

20
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.629
about uh sequencing our DNA and finding specific uh

21
00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:16.730
markers which are considered to be related to our

22
00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:19.699
ancestry. So there are a number of issues with

23
00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:23.000
this uh which I'm sure we're going to discuss.

24
00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:25.300
But overall, the idea is that we can make

25
00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:28.660
inferences about our ancestry based on our, on the

26
00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:29.930
sequencing of our DNA.

27
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.919
And uh I mean, perhaps relevant to the topic

28
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.150
here. What are some of the most common misconceptions

29
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.360
that people have about how DNA works? And uh

30
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.089
that people tend to attach to these tests.

31
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.449
Well, the biggest misconception is that these are ancestry

32
00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:53.760
tests because they have almost nothing to do with

33
00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:59.019
ancestry and our ancestors. Um What these tests do

34
00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:04.260
is to identify similarities that our DNA has to

35
00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:08.699
particular reference groups. Uh The selection of which is

36
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.059
a big story. But overall what the test can

37
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.750
show is that we share some recent common ancestors

38
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.000
with some of these people. So in fact, what

39
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.339
the test can tell us is that there may

40
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.360
be relatives, close relatives in some place, especially when

41
00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:29.240
the database is large or that we are more

42
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.619
similar to one reference group rather than to another.

43
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.380
So what kinds of information can we really get

44
00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.619
from DNA sequencing?

45
00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:46.389
Uh FROM DNA sequencing in general, we can have

46
00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.779
uh we can have our own DNA sequence, uh

47
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.149
you know, an individual's DNA sequence and compare it

48
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.820
to other individuals or to a whole group or

49
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.490
to a consumption sequence. Uh And all we can

50
00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:02.690
really find out figure out our similarities and differences.

51
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.970
Now, when it comes to health, for instance, we

52
00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:09.889
can find whether we have a specific uh single

53
00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.669
nucleotide polymorphism or S MP that may be related

54
00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:17.199
to some disease. This is a probabilistic issue. When

55
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.669
it comes to ancestry, we may or may not

56
00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:24.339
have uh what usually is called ancestry formative markers,

57
00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.830
which are markers that are more often found in

58
00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:31.660
one group rather than another. The big issue is

59
00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.570
which these markers are, which are not exclusive to

60
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.889
any group that are just more frequent to one

61
00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:41.509
group or another. And what exactly we infer from

62
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.259
this about our ancestry.

63
00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:49.669
So when people have take these tests, how do

64
00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:54.229
they usually react to and deal with the information

65
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.360
they get from them?

66
00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:59.339
Ok. Now, that's a big problem. Uh Many people

67
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.990
take this test for fun because someone gifted make

68
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.369
a, made a gift, you know, in Christmas or

69
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.529
uh at another time without really uh considering which

70
00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:14.580
the consequences might be. Now, the biggest problem is

71
00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:18.829
that once someone takes a test, uh the DNA

72
00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.738
information, the DNA sequences that this person has is

73
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.679
made available for purposes that uh he she may

74
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.660
not agree uh with, for instance, using medical research.

75
00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:33.519
Another issue is that, and that's the most uh

76
00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:37.320
ugly surprise that people have uh realize that, you

77
00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:40.959
know, the person that uh one has considered as

78
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.049
he's, her father is not uh really that because

79
00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:50.420
uh we have several false paternity cases that are

80
00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:53.510
revealed by the tests and this is a bad

81
00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:58.489
surprise for many people. Now, the actual uh very

82
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.209
good thing that these tests can do which is

83
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.540
good for those interested in, that is to identify

84
00:05:05.549 --> 00:05:08.290
and know relatives. And this can be very useful

85
00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:10.739
for people who do not know much about their

86
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.850
ancestry. For instance, in my case, I know my

87
00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:16.739
grandparents, I came to meet three of my eight

88
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.209
great grandparents and I know a lot about my

89
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.779
recent history. So I have no concerns but there

90
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.744
are other people who may not know for whatever

91
00:05:23.755 --> 00:05:27.415
reason uh much about their history. So what happens

92
00:05:27.424 --> 00:05:32.204
is that by uploading their sequence on databases and

93
00:05:32.214 --> 00:05:36.265
identifying an and relatives, they may not know, they

94
00:05:36.274 --> 00:05:39.075
may not have known before. This is a way

95
00:05:39.084 --> 00:05:43.470
to find more about uh their ancestry. So this

96
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.559
is why in the book, in the end I

97
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.899
say that actually this is DNA family testing and

98
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.260
not ancestry testing.

99
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.670
Mhm OK. So I'm about to ask you what

100
00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:57.709
ancestry means and then I know that people who,

101
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.510
I mean sell those tests and give out that

102
00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:05.200
information, use terms like ethnicity, race, nationality. We we're

103
00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:09.220
also going to discuss those terms but more generally,

104
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.700
what is a social group? What does that mean?

105
00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:15.890
And particularly from a genetics perspective?

106
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.250
OK. So a social group is a group to

107
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.589
which we may belong, which can be anything, it

108
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.230
can be, you know, a group of uh students,

109
00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:29.679
it can be um you know, those who follow

110
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.279
a football club or whatever. But of course, there

111
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.970
are some social groups which are more important and

112
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.209
relate more closely to our identity. Nationality is the

113
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.890
first one that comes to mind because it's official,

114
00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:46.119
we all have official documents uh for whatever reason,

115
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.559
uh this changes from one country to another. But

116
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.190
uh this is uh uh an important part of

117
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.940
our identity, uh our nationality because it defines who

118
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.059
we are and it is confirmed by the official

119
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.049
documents, you know, passports, identity cards that we have

120
00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:06.000
uh related to, that is ethnicity that has to

121
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.320
do mostly with culture, sometimes with descent. And this

122
00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:15.269
is sometimes quite close to nationality. Other times it

123
00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:17.549
is not, for instance, in my, in my case,

124
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.480
uh when it comes to Greek nationality and what

125
00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:22.910
we call Greek ethnicity, these are two things that

126
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.929
go together. Well, because uh Greece is a very

127
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.940
peculiar case with a peculiar language and the specific

128
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.200
history in a specific geographical area. Of course, there

129
00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:36.070
are Greeks, Greeks that live all over the world.

130
00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:41.540
But uh this is something that is usually localized

131
00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:46.679
geographically and specified culturally, as I said with where

132
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.000
uh the group usually lives if it is, if

133
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.410
it lives in one place because some of groups

134
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.600
are dispersed and what with other cultural characteristics they

135
00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:59.570
have with respect to mo most importantly, with respect

136
00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:04.260
to language. Now, race is something that is broader

137
00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:09.049
usually. Um IT has to do with uh uh

138
00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:13.600
continental groups in relation to specific continental groups. So

139
00:08:13.609 --> 00:08:16.750
in the sense that a racial group may uh

140
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:22.489
include various ethnicities and it is usually related to

141
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.679
specific biological markers, uh biological characteristics such as skin

142
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.790
color. But this does not mean in any way

143
00:08:31.799 --> 00:08:36.609
that race is a biological, biologically defined group because

144
00:08:36.619 --> 00:08:40.419
we may identify, you know, an African and Asian

145
00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:44.270
and European from their skin color or other features.

146
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.659
But this does not mean in any way that

147
00:08:46.669 --> 00:08:50.210
all Africans, all Asians or all Europeans have exactly

148
00:08:50.219 --> 00:08:52.849
the same features. It is just that we have

149
00:08:52.859 --> 00:08:57.289
some averages that may differ. But in fact, when

150
00:08:57.299 --> 00:09:00.640
it comes to phenotypic variation, the, the features that

151
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.760
we all have, there's a big continuum in all

152
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:04.250
of these

153
00:09:05.549 --> 00:09:09.210
a and what does ancestry mean exactly

154
00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:16.500
what you mean, what ancestry means more broadly. So,

155
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.070
you know, uh first of all, there's not one

156
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:25.080
kind of ancestry, we may talk about genealogical ancestry,

157
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.820
we may talk about genetic ancestry. We may talk

158
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.119
about cultural ancestry. We may talk about geographical ancestry.

159
00:09:32.309 --> 00:09:35.780
Overall ancestry have to do with where we come

160
00:09:35.789 --> 00:09:39.059
from. Uh CULTURAL ancestry has to do with the

161
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.549
culture we belong to. And geographical ancestry has to

162
00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:47.429
do with uh the places we come from or

163
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.020
uh our, our parents came from. But the two

164
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:54.619
most important ones which are usually confused are genealogical

165
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.840
and genetic ancestry. Genealogical ancestry has to do with

166
00:09:58.849 --> 00:10:02.270
our pedigree, our family tree who our parents were,

167
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.109
who are grandparents, great grandparents. And so on were,

168
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:10.609
whereas genetic ancestry has to do with uh specific

169
00:10:10.619 --> 00:10:14.820
uh segments of DNA and their origin. So we

170
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.700
get half of our DNA from each of our

171
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:22.640
parents on average 1/4 25% from each of our

172
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:27.270
grandparents. Uh 18 from each one of our great

173
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.419
grandparents. And so on, this has an important implication.

174
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:38.020
Whereas we have two parents, four grandparents, eight grandparents,

175
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.710
16 in the next generation and so on. And

176
00:10:40.719 --> 00:10:45.460
the number of our ancestors increases exponentially because in

177
00:10:45.469 --> 00:10:47.789
each generation, only half of the DNA on average

178
00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:51.070
goes to the next one, we get less and

179
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.469
less of uh DNA from our more remote ancestors.

180
00:10:55.789 --> 00:10:58.500
So after 10 gen 10 generations, if you make

181
00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.969
the calculations, there will be ancestors from whom we

182
00:11:01.979 --> 00:11:04.880
will have inherited no DNA at all. And this

183
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:09.119
is the confusing part these ancestors have existed. But

184
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:13.140
because of how biology works, because of how uh

185
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.809
DNA is transmitted from one generation to another. And

186
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.349
some are combinations that take place in the formation

187
00:11:20.359 --> 00:11:25.070
of the reproductive cells, we end up receiving segments

188
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.390
which becomes smaller and smaller. The further back in

189
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.739
time our ancestors were. So this is the problem

190
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.520
with ancestry tests because in fact, they cannot tell

191
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.090
much about our more remote ancestors. They can tell

192
00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:43.000
a lot about our recent ancestors from whom we

193
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:47.250
have received, received inherited many and large segments.

194
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.330
So you've already given us an overview of uh

195
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.030
ethnicity, race. And nationality. But let me ask you

196
00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:59.960
more specifically about race because this uh particularly in

197
00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:03.369
some contexts, tends to be a very pernicious term

198
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.390
because of the things people like attached to the

199
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.200
term race. So what are some of the claims

200
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:14.239
made by race scientists? And are some of them

201
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.840
based on what the, the information they can get

202
00:12:18.849 --> 00:12:21.400
from these DNA tests?

203
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:28.489
Yeah. Uh MOST geneticists today would say that there

204
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.000
is no biological basis when it comes to race.

205
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.299
And this does not mean that races do not

206
00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:41.119
have differences in biological features. But this is a

207
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:45.919
different thing. The fact that we can make inferences

208
00:12:45.929 --> 00:12:49.690
from some biological features about a person's race does

209
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.200
not mean that these features define this person race.

210
00:12:53.419 --> 00:12:57.830
So race is mostly cultural, socially constructed and there

211
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.380
are different philosophical views about this, even though we

212
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.960
can find some features which are highly associated with

213
00:13:05.969 --> 00:13:09.719
specific races. The most known one is um uh

214
00:13:09.729 --> 00:13:14.960
skin color. Now, the big problem is that because

215
00:13:14.969 --> 00:13:21.239
of how this concept was treated in the 19th

216
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.510
century, we ended up with stereotypes that do harm

217
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.989
still today. So what was the issue during the

218
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.580
19th century European countries had colonized most of the

219
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:39.869
world and to make uh use and exploit what

220
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.549
they had there. They had to use people for

221
00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:46.619
labor, for work, uh whom they usually treated as

222
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:51.929
slaves. But these were humans and the mostly Christian

223
00:13:52.229 --> 00:13:56.260
European countries had issues about how to deal with

224
00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:00.070
that. So a solution was found by naturalists of

225
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.619
the time who started arguing that these people, the

226
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:09.190
Aborigines who lived uh in Africa, Oceania or elsewhere,

227
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.869
the non Europeans were not exactly at the same

228
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.450
level with Europeans and we who are usually white

229
00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:21.500
people, they were inferior. And this was a quite

230
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:26.570
silly justification of the exploitation. So, whereas it was

231
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:31.140
not acceptable to exploit humans, once the science in

232
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.099
quotation marks of, of, of the time argued that

233
00:14:34.109 --> 00:14:37.739
these, these were inferior, there was a justification for

234
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:41.260
this exploitation. And this had, this has to do,

235
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.440
this had to do with many different kinds of

236
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:49.169
groups. And the idea persisted up to the 20th

237
00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:54.080
century. And unfortunately, uh took its extreme path with

238
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:57.359
the holocaust and the persecution of the Jews by

239
00:14:57.369 --> 00:15:02.150
the Nazis uh in terms of ancestry groups, if

240
00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:05.080
of course, we accept that the being Jews is

241
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.440
an issue of ancestry, not an issue of religion.

242
00:15:08.119 --> 00:15:13.450
So uh there were also, there was also discrimination

243
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.299
in the United States and elsewhere with respect to

244
00:15:16.309 --> 00:15:19.900
African Americans and European Americans, we will justify it

245
00:15:19.909 --> 00:15:24.690
in this way. And people insisted that there were

246
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:29.419
big and important differences about these various racial groups.

247
00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.320
Mhm This we know today that is not at

248
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.070
all uh true and accurate. In fact, the genetic

249
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.270
variation that we find in Africa is much higher

250
00:15:41.489 --> 00:15:44.330
than the genetic variation everywhere else in the world.

251
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.950
Just because all of us who live outside Africa

252
00:15:48.565 --> 00:15:52.945
have evolved, are descended from a very small portion

253
00:15:53.075 --> 00:15:57.044
of that, uh, African variation because we are descendants

254
00:15:57.054 --> 00:16:00.145
of those people who at some point, uh, some

255
00:16:00.155 --> 00:16:04.025
40 50,000 years or 60,000 years ago or earlier

256
00:16:04.034 --> 00:16:06.145
left Africa and moved elsewhere.

257
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.200
And on the topic of ethnicity, I mean, the

258
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.210
way people use these terms is sometimes a bit

259
00:16:14.219 --> 00:16:17.900
confusing because they overlap a little bit. Isn't there

260
00:16:17.909 --> 00:16:22.919
somewhat of a close relationship or connection between race

261
00:16:22.929 --> 00:16:27.080
and ethnicity in the way that people think and

262
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.250
talk about this term?

263
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.179
Yeah, actually, in some cases, they used as synonyms.

264
00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.465
Uh uh THEY'RE talking about in some uh kinds

265
00:16:35.474 --> 00:16:38.724
of sensors, they talk about racial slash ethnic groups,

266
00:16:38.854 --> 00:16:42.424
but actually, they're quite different exactly because race is

267
00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:48.054
usually correlated associated with biological markers. Whereas ethnicity is

268
00:16:48.065 --> 00:16:53.104
usually associated with culture plus race is uh with

269
00:16:53.114 --> 00:16:55.924
race. We also, we usually make reference to continental

270
00:16:55.934 --> 00:16:59.484
groups whereas with ethnicity, we usually make reference to

271
00:16:59.494 --> 00:17:04.180
more local geographical populations. So we could say for

272
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:07.260
instance that in Europe, we are all Europeans, uh

273
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.928
we are white, not all but you know, uh

274
00:17:10.938 --> 00:17:14.968
many people are white uh and European and then

275
00:17:14.979 --> 00:17:17.798
we might identify specific ethnic groups like, you know,

276
00:17:17.808 --> 00:17:22.068
Portuguese, Spanish, Greek or whatever, which may uh be

277
00:17:22.078 --> 00:17:26.769
uh correlated with nationality. But also this is not

278
00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:30.019
something obligatory. This is why the these groups are

279
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:33.708
are usually confused. But the, the key point I

280
00:17:33.718 --> 00:17:36.379
argue for in my book is that none of

281
00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.449
this has to do anything with biology because there's

282
00:17:39.459 --> 00:17:43.250
no way that DNA defines whether one is, you

283
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.930
know, Greek, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese or whatever.

284
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:53.869
So, isn't there a sort of underlying essentialism attached

285
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.959
to all of these terms like race, ethnicity and

286
00:17:57.969 --> 00:18:02.510
even nationality? And if so, what kind of essentialism

287
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:07.109
exactly? Is it biological, essentialism or also essentialism of

288
00:18:07.239 --> 00:18:08.510
other kinds?

289
00:18:09.305 --> 00:18:11.385
Well, the big problem is that there is, of

290
00:18:11.395 --> 00:18:15.805
course, essentialism about social groups, which is something that

291
00:18:15.814 --> 00:18:20.564
is very intuitive. This is psychological essentialism that comes

292
00:18:20.574 --> 00:18:25.545
to us naturally because it makes us feel that

293
00:18:25.555 --> 00:18:30.045
we understand what is happening with um uh other

294
00:18:30.055 --> 00:18:32.454
groups and our to the other and the group

295
00:18:32.464 --> 00:18:35.239
to which we belong. Now, first of all, we

296
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.189
all need to belong to a group, whatever that

297
00:18:38.199 --> 00:18:41.319
group is, it could be, you know, football club,

298
00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.880
it could be our nation, it could be whatever.

299
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.599
And of course, belonging to a nation is very

300
00:18:46.609 --> 00:18:51.140
important because this provides stability security to people and

301
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.030
they know where to what they they are attached.

302
00:18:54.689 --> 00:18:58.890
But this does not in any way indicate anything

303
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.229
about the people belonging to a social group. What

304
00:19:02.239 --> 00:19:05.630
whether it is, this is racial, ethnic or national

305
00:19:05.689 --> 00:19:09.969
nation, we feel the need to make these distinctions

306
00:19:09.979 --> 00:19:14.540
because when we identify with a group, uh our

307
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.390
own group, the in group as psychologists call it

308
00:19:17.479 --> 00:19:20.579
this increase the cohesion of the group because we

309
00:19:20.589 --> 00:19:23.699
know who our compatriots are and we feel, you

310
00:19:23.709 --> 00:19:26.270
know, more comfortable with them. And at the same

311
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:32.380
time, this increases our distinction between our own group

312
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.859
and other groups. This is a psychological need. And

313
00:19:36.869 --> 00:19:39.410
this is based on the idea that there is

314
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.180
something common among ourselves, our in group and something

315
00:19:43.189 --> 00:19:46.479
very different with the people from our groups. There's

316
00:19:46.489 --> 00:19:49.109
no problem with that in principle because, you know,

317
00:19:49.119 --> 00:19:53.719
cultural differences exist and groups can be different. However,

318
00:19:53.729 --> 00:19:56.270
the problem begins when we are looking for a

319
00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:01.180
deeper sense that characterizes this group, which is very

320
00:20:01.189 --> 00:20:05.540
easily intuitively identified with DNA. This is then when

321
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.219
we come to say that uh look, I'm, you

322
00:20:08.229 --> 00:20:12.010
know, Greek or Portuguese or Spanish or whatever because

323
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.410
I this is in my DNA and there is

324
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.300
no way that an immigrant can become Greek uh

325
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:21.030
or Spanish or Portuguese because he she does not

326
00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.880
have his DNA. And this is problematic because this

327
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.540
gives grounds to people who argue about nativism and

328
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:34.099
being natives in their country against those who are

329
00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:37.640
immigrants, even though these immigrants can be well adapted

330
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:42.239
and well assimilated in the community. And this can

331
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:48.520
uh also uh reinforce uh racism among those people

332
00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:53.160
who consider other racial groups different or inferior. And

333
00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.170
sadly, there have been several mass shootings in the

334
00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.199
US in which the perpetrators cited scientific research to

335
00:21:01.209 --> 00:21:06.109
justify the differences between themselves and their victims. So,

336
00:21:06.209 --> 00:21:10.489
the big problem with essentialism is that we have

337
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:15.510
the tendency to centralize social groups. And when these

338
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.449
essences are found in DNA, they are not, but

339
00:21:19.459 --> 00:21:22.209
we consider them to be there, then it is

340
00:21:22.219 --> 00:21:26.339
easy to naturalize our belonging to a social group

341
00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:29.410
and consider other people as more different than we

342
00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.449
are. And this is problematic because actually, if you,

343
00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:36.160
when we look at our DNA, the similarities that

344
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.560
we find among any one of us are many

345
00:21:38.569 --> 00:21:42.069
more than our differences. Mhm

346
00:21:42.949 --> 00:21:46.880
uh I mean, and what do people who create

347
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:51.000
these DNA tests and provide this information to users

348
00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.880
actually mean, where do they get the information that

349
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.150
particular genes or sets of genes come from a

350
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.079
particular group of people, a particular region of the

351
00:22:04.089 --> 00:22:07.119
globe? I mean, does it make sense to talk

352
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:11.150
about genes that way as being from these or

353
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.109
that place or from this or that? Uh

354
00:22:14.119 --> 00:22:17.550
PEOPLE uh First of all, they don't only talk

355
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.959
about genes, they may talk about various sites on

356
00:22:20.969 --> 00:22:24.290
DNA which are even found outside genes. Now, it

357
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:31.329
all begins with population genetic research, population geneticist, arbitrary

358
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.989
and they are clear about that, define populations in

359
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.760
order to make comparisons and selectively, they look at

360
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:42.540
the very small part of the differences because this

361
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.390
is what they're interested in and they may find

362
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.619
one or another SNP or gene uh more frequent

363
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:54.300
in one or another place. And by identifying sometimes

364
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:59.020
clients gradations of the these frequencies, they can make

365
00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:03.640
inferences about migration movements and things like that always

366
00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:07.969
in com in um a a complementary way, complementary

367
00:23:07.979 --> 00:23:12.020
way with the data evidence from archaeology, history and

368
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:16.569
other disciplines. Now, uh what they used to do

369
00:23:16.579 --> 00:23:21.880
in the past was to um assign uh specific

370
00:23:21.969 --> 00:23:28.349
individuals to specific groups when their four grandparents all

371
00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:30.969
came from a single place. For instance, in my

372
00:23:30.979 --> 00:23:34.739
case, knowing that my four grandparents were born and

373
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.900
lived in Greece and I was also born and

374
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.160
lived most of my life. Uh IN Greece, I

375
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:45.010
would be assigned to the Greek group. Uh But

376
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.310
this is a bit arbitrary because I have no

377
00:23:47.319 --> 00:23:50.859
idea what happened three or four or five generations

378
00:23:50.869 --> 00:23:56.140
before my grandparents. Nevertheless, this arbitrariness is accepted because

379
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.130
they need to have a criterion of grouping. And

380
00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.579
there is no problem in so far as this

381
00:24:01.589 --> 00:24:06.000
is explained, the DNA ancestry companies use more or

382
00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:09.270
less the same uh principle and they assign people

383
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.880
to groups. And now the problem is that to

384
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:16.349
describe these groups, both the scientists in the past,

385
00:24:16.359 --> 00:24:19.140
but they have now changed that. And the ancestry

386
00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:24.329
companies still today used the names, the denominations uh

387
00:24:24.339 --> 00:24:27.099
related to ethnic groups. And this has created the

388
00:24:27.109 --> 00:24:32.630
confusion. These ethnic groups are usually located in specific

389
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.989
places geographically and they found that as a useful

390
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.829
descriptor. But it is exactly this has cons confusion

391
00:24:40.989 --> 00:24:44.229
and this is a thing to be avoided. Now,

392
00:24:44.729 --> 00:24:49.729
what does this mean? The tests can only show

393
00:24:49.739 --> 00:24:53.609
whether we are more similar or less similar always

394
00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:58.699
probabilistically to one or another reference group. How these

395
00:24:58.709 --> 00:25:02.189
groups have been made is a big story. And

396
00:25:02.199 --> 00:25:06.140
it is interesting that the big companies like 23

397
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:10.670
and me and ancestry, they explain all these limitations

398
00:25:10.739 --> 00:25:14.290
and all these parameters in their white papers. The

399
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.650
question is how many of the customers who buy

400
00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.050
the test actually take the time to read these

401
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.599
white papers and understand the limitations. And uh when

402
00:25:23.609 --> 00:25:28.239
we also consider the um uh the probability to

403
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:32.489
be correctly assigned, there are some threshold levels. And

404
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:37.550
when these levels go up, what uh assignments can

405
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.859
be made are usually only at the continental level,

406
00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.390
which perhaps we can already make by looking at

407
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.810
each other. There's no need to take a genetic

408
00:25:46.819 --> 00:25:50.609
test. Otherwise, when we go to more uh local

409
00:25:50.619 --> 00:25:53.640
levels, there are limitations and there are these are

410
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.270
probabilistic estimates which may not be accurate and they

411
00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:02.140
just offer to customers the most likely results. And

412
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.959
the most interesting part then is that these results

413
00:26:04.969 --> 00:26:07.819
change across time. People who took a test 10

414
00:26:07.829 --> 00:26:11.329
years ago would have different results today because the

415
00:26:11.339 --> 00:26:15.699
reference groups have been enriched and changing and the

416
00:26:15.709 --> 00:26:17.839
companies have been going to find the levels of

417
00:26:17.849 --> 00:26:21.410
detail. And as a result, there have been changes

418
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.099
in the assignments that they make.

419
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.030
So does it make sense then to say that

420
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:35.449
anyone is X percent A nationality. Y percent, an

421
00:26:35.459 --> 00:26:40.630
ethnicity. Z percent another, uh, nationality. Because that's, uh,

422
00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.869
the way I, I mean, a, actually, to be

423
00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:48.260
honest, I've never took myself one of those tests.

424
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.584
So, but, uh, look, uh, on the internet and

425
00:26:51.594 --> 00:26:54.734
even people that I know personally who took those

426
00:26:54.744 --> 00:26:58.655
tests, the way they, uh, present the information when

427
00:26:58.665 --> 00:27:01.994
talking with other people is always that way. Z

428
00:27:02.395 --> 00:27:07.594
this Y, that x uh, that over there. So,

429
00:27:07.604 --> 00:27:11.704
but does it make sense to present and analyze

430
00:27:11.714 --> 00:27:14.185
genetic data in that way?

431
00:27:14.599 --> 00:27:17.300
Uh Absolutely not. And that's what I explained in

432
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:20.140
the book. What it makes sense is to tell

433
00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:24.219
people that look, we have reference groups, ABC D,

434
00:27:24.229 --> 00:27:28.719
et cetera and you are, were found to be

435
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:33.050
more closely related, have more similarities in your DNA

436
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:38.000
sequence with that. And the other group, uh This

437
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.599
means perhaps that with these people, it is more

438
00:27:41.609 --> 00:27:44.680
likely to have had common ancestors in the recent

439
00:27:44.689 --> 00:27:48.050
past, but this has nothing to do with nationality

440
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.729
and ethnicity. So, what the company should be doing

441
00:27:51.849 --> 00:27:56.780
is as scientists have been doing recently, drop, forget

442
00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:03.209
altogether about uh um names relating to national, racial

443
00:28:03.219 --> 00:28:06.290
or other social groups and just saying that look,

444
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.670
we have, for instance, the UK ban or we

445
00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.689
have another bio banks in other places. We have

446
00:28:13.699 --> 00:28:18.219
uh a data from specific places and this or

447
00:28:18.229 --> 00:28:20.869
the other person were found to be more similar

448
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.310
to that or the other bio bank which means

449
00:28:23.319 --> 00:28:26.640
that it is more likely that there are common

450
00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:30.790
ancestors with that group rather than the other. When

451
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.880
we do that. This makes sense because all we

452
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:39.150
say is that probabilistically somewhere is more closely related

453
00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.010
to some people than to another, which makes sense.

454
00:28:42.689 --> 00:28:46.930
But this has not uh does not have anything

455
00:28:46.939 --> 00:28:51.069
to do with national ethnic or racial groups. Now,

456
00:28:51.079 --> 00:28:56.780
attention there may be a correlated associated by coincidence

457
00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.150
uh but it doesn't have to be. So that's

458
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:04.660
the issue. There will likely be a correlation with,

459
00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.250
you know, an ethnic group when we're talking about

460
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.469
a genetic test. So the genetic test can be

461
00:29:10.479 --> 00:29:13.939
an indicator for someone belock in a specific group,

462
00:29:13.949 --> 00:29:16.949
but it may not so not be. And this

463
00:29:16.959 --> 00:29:20.550
is why we should not confuse uh what are

464
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.160
the indicators of ethnicity or race with the criteria

465
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:28.859
for belonging to ethnicity or race. But unfortunately, people

466
00:29:28.869 --> 00:29:32.010
take them exactly in the opposite way when the

467
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.699
tests tell them that you are X percent that

468
00:29:34.709 --> 00:29:39.589
or y percent that they tend to forget what

469
00:29:39.599 --> 00:29:42.369
they know about their family history and believe that

470
00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.890
since DNA says that it must be correct, but

471
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.130
it doesn't have to be the case.

472
00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.060
Mhm So uh the next question, this is something

473
00:29:51.069 --> 00:29:54.150
that I think you've already, at least in part

474
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.719
touched on when earlier I asked you uh how

475
00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:02.010
people determine that a particular gene or set of

476
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.540
genes come from this or that area. Of the

477
00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:08.410
global these or that people out there. Um BUT

478
00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:13.790
apart from ethnicity, race, nationality, which seem to be

479
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:18.810
very, uh I mean, uh not very precise terms

480
00:30:18.819 --> 00:30:22.430
and not very scientifically valid to think about things,

481
00:30:22.439 --> 00:30:26.650
particularly from a genetics perspective. Do you think that

482
00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:31.390
a term like population would make more sense? And

483
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.300
if so how would we need to define it

484
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:37.920
for it to be scientifically valued, particularly from a

485
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:39.459
genetics perspective,

486
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.589
even populations are arbitrarily defined and geneticists are very

487
00:30:44.599 --> 00:30:48.400
clear about this. Uh But this is something that

488
00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:51.939
is better to use uh with a specific reference

489
00:30:51.949 --> 00:30:54.099
of what we're talking about. So for instance, we

490
00:30:54.109 --> 00:30:57.000
might say that we went to England and we

491
00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:00.670
sampled, you know, 2000 people from all over England.

492
00:31:00.869 --> 00:31:04.949
And this gives us AAA group with a specific

493
00:31:04.959 --> 00:31:08.150
name uh of people who have lived there for

494
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.890
some time or, you know, whose parents and grandparents

495
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.489
were born there. This does not have to do

496
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.780
anything with being English biologically or English identity or

497
00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:21.479
whatever. It is just a specific sample that we

498
00:31:21.489 --> 00:31:25.569
rely on. If we compare someone and find similarities

499
00:31:25.579 --> 00:31:29.400
or differences with uh that group, we can say

500
00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:32.310
that this person is closer to that group, uh

501
00:31:32.319 --> 00:31:35.130
which could be, you know, a population, but we

502
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.500
should refrain from referring to identity. And now here

503
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:41.280
is the issue. If we compare people, for instance,

504
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:44.709
you know, uh living in Spain and Portugal, the

505
00:31:44.719 --> 00:31:47.589
differences will not be many, there will be many

506
00:31:47.599 --> 00:31:50.239
more differences if we can compare someone living in

507
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.109
Spain with someone living in China and someone living

508
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.410
uh in Portugal with someone in China. Exactly because

509
00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.890
we have these clients, these gradations and these frequencies

510
00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.000
change. But all of that is probabilistic and the

511
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.969
inferences that we can make uh should be very

512
00:32:06.979 --> 00:32:09.849
cautious. And this is why I'm saying again that

513
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:14.729
we should forget about ancestry and just understand that

514
00:32:14.739 --> 00:32:17.469
what the test tells us, tell can tell us

515
00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.689
is, are about similarities in our DNA sequences with

516
00:32:21.699 --> 00:32:25.630
specific groups or particular individuals. And this is the

517
00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.270
important and the only value that the tests have

518
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:32.020
someone who doesn't know much about their past, they

519
00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:35.219
can, they may be able to find relatives, close

520
00:32:35.229 --> 00:32:38.469
or more distant ones, uh if they have uploaded,

521
00:32:38.479 --> 00:32:40.920
of course, their own DNA on the database, you

522
00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.280
know, get to meet them. And this is why

523
00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:46.160
ma how many people have found, you know, unknown

524
00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:51.030
relatives have siblings, uh lost fathers or whatever um

525
00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.069
from uh from distance, but it is always about

526
00:32:56.079 --> 00:33:00.689
similarity and it is relative. It doesn't have to

527
00:33:00.699 --> 00:33:03.949
do with ancestry and ethnic identity and things like

528
00:33:03.959 --> 00:33:04.270
that.

529
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:08.089
And earlier, when I asked you about race, you

530
00:33:08.099 --> 00:33:13.020
mentioned very briefly the term decline. What is a

531
00:33:13.089 --> 00:33:15.270
line? Exactly? Could you tell us a little bit

532
00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.089
more about it?

533
00:33:16.689 --> 00:33:20.859
So we may have a specific A and P

534
00:33:20.869 --> 00:33:24.300
or specific genes in an area. And uh for

535
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:28.170
whatever reason, because, because, you know, the founder group

536
00:33:28.359 --> 00:33:30.780
was there and they have this S and PS

537
00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:35.449
very in high frequency and these have persisted because

538
00:33:35.459 --> 00:33:37.770
there was no reason for the frequent uh to

539
00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:42.719
change. And now if people have left this group,

540
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:46.599
you know, more people will live quite close, less

541
00:33:46.609 --> 00:33:49.790
people, we will live a bit further and even

542
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.959
less people will, will live very far. So if

543
00:33:52.969 --> 00:33:56.949
we study and do the proper sampling a along

544
00:33:56.959 --> 00:33:59.979
the way, we will find the higher frequencies in,

545
00:33:59.989 --> 00:34:02.739
in that in the initial place and the frequency

546
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.060
of the specific S and P becoming lower and

547
00:34:05.069 --> 00:34:08.148
lower along the way. And this is how a

548
00:34:08.158 --> 00:34:13.759
client is identified. Uh We have a diminishing frequency

549
00:34:13.768 --> 00:34:18.197
of the particular S and P uh along geographical

550
00:34:18.208 --> 00:34:22.197
distance. Now, if we do this for many S

551
00:34:22.208 --> 00:34:25.938
and PS or genes, and we've used models to

552
00:34:25.947 --> 00:34:31.197
represent this variation, it is possible to identify movements

553
00:34:31.259 --> 00:34:35.879
along the geographical area. But this always, the interpretation

554
00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:39.688
has to be cautious and always correlated related with,

555
00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:43.570
you know, archaeological historical and other kinds of evidence.

556
00:34:44.458 --> 00:34:48.520
Mhm So in your book, at a certain point,

557
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:51.969
you tell us that when it comes to retracing

558
00:34:51.978 --> 00:34:56.399
history, it is important to understand the differences between

559
00:34:56.489 --> 00:35:02.209
genetic ancestry and genealogical ancestry. So could you tell

560
00:35:02.219 --> 00:35:05.510
us what those differences are, what each of those

561
00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.800
terms mean and what limitations they impose in the

562
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:12.260
domain of retracing history.

563
00:35:12.889 --> 00:35:15.179
This has to do with uh the con this

564
00:35:15.189 --> 00:35:17.669
concept that I defined earlier. So as I said,

565
00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:21.530
genealogical ancestry has to do with our ancestors in

566
00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:25.590
our family tree. And these increase exponentially in every

567
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.530
generation 248, 16 and so on. And these are

568
00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.219
actual people who have lived in the past. Um

569
00:35:33.469 --> 00:35:37.340
Genetic ancestry has to do with the segments of

570
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:41.169
DNA we have inherited from these people. And there

571
00:35:41.179 --> 00:35:45.209
are two issues in this inheritance. The first one

572
00:35:45.219 --> 00:35:49.169
is that each parent transmits about 50% of his

573
00:35:49.179 --> 00:35:52.310
hair DNA to their offspring. And the second is

574
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.969
that uh due to a process called crossing, crossing

575
00:35:55.979 --> 00:35:59.600
over uh in the production of uh the reproductive

576
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:05.959
cells, uh specific chromosomes, homologous chromosomes exchange segments. So

577
00:36:05.969 --> 00:36:09.300
for instance, a chromosome that I inherited from my

578
00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:13.090
father does not have to be the respective chromosome.

579
00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.860
Let's say chromosome one of my father does not

580
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:19.790
have to be the chromosome one of my paternal

581
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.899
grandfather or my paternal grandmother. But actually, it may

582
00:36:22.909 --> 00:36:26.719
have combinations of both of these grand paternal chromosomes

583
00:36:26.729 --> 00:36:30.909
in one exactly because of the combination. So this

584
00:36:30.919 --> 00:36:35.739
process continues. And whereas we have received large segments

585
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:39.330
from our recent ancestors, we receive smaller and smaller

586
00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.879
segments from our more remote ancestors. And as I

587
00:36:42.889 --> 00:36:46.270
said earlier, the outcome is that we have not

588
00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:51.229
received uh DNA, we may have not received DNA

589
00:36:51.239 --> 00:36:54.250
from some of our remote ancestors who are not

590
00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.199
represented in ourselves. So in this sense, and this

591
00:36:58.209 --> 00:37:01.770
is what frustrates me sometimes when the test companies

592
00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.629
say DNA can tell you who you really are,

593
00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:07.790
it actually cannot because only a portion of our

594
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:13.030
genealogical ancestry is reflected represented in our genetic ancestry.

595
00:37:13.629 --> 00:37:16.739
And that's the important thing to keep in mind.

596
00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.810
So who we are depends on what we happen

597
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.100
to have inherited from our ancestors. And there is

598
00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:28.560
so much information that we cannot see in our

599
00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:32.419
own DNA. The other issue now is that as

600
00:37:32.429 --> 00:37:34.850
we go further back in the past, and we

601
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.229
have an exponential increase of our ancestors imagine having

602
00:37:39.239 --> 00:37:42.419
today. I don't know, 8 billion people, how many

603
00:37:42.429 --> 00:37:46.320
billions of ancestors should have existed, you know, 1000

604
00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.770
years ago. But this is not the case. And

605
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:53.260
the reason is simply that the ancestors that each

606
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:57.219
of us theoretically has had, are not different from

607
00:37:57.229 --> 00:37:59.500
the ancestors of our people. It is just that

608
00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.800
as we go back in the past, our pedigrees

609
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:06.389
become e inter twined and overlap and we have

610
00:38:06.399 --> 00:38:10.879
uh the same ancestors. Now, this usually correlates with

611
00:38:10.889 --> 00:38:14.709
geography and you know, a person who has been

612
00:38:14.719 --> 00:38:16.830
born and grew up in a place is more

613
00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.600
likely to have recent common ancestors with the people

614
00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:23.179
living there than with people living elsewhere. But it

615
00:38:23.189 --> 00:38:26.879
is all probabilistic. Now, the big confusion to conclude

616
00:38:26.889 --> 00:38:31.939
is that we should clearly separate genealogical ancestry, who

617
00:38:31.949 --> 00:38:35.790
our ancestors were with the portions of DNA. We

618
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.469
haven't heard it from them and DNA tests have

619
00:38:38.479 --> 00:38:41.459
nothing to do. A nothing to say about genealogical

620
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.889
rate. They can only tell us about genetic ancestry.

621
00:38:44.899 --> 00:38:47.780
The DNA we have inherited by some of our

622
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:51.350
ancestors and nothing to do with the rest of

623
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.750
the others from whom we may have received nothing.

624
00:38:54.419 --> 00:38:54.969
Mhm uh

625
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.750
So I would like to just clarify one point

626
00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.020
that you made briefly also earlier in one of

627
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:05.719
my other questions. What does it mean to say

628
00:39:05.729 --> 00:39:10.219
that in terms of ancestry, we are all ultimately

629
00:39:10.229 --> 00:39:14.209
African o of course, we know from paleoanthropology from

630
00:39:14.219 --> 00:39:16.504
the best Africa we have that we as a

631
00:39:16.514 --> 00:39:21.375
species, Homo sapiens originated in Africa. There's a debate

632
00:39:21.385 --> 00:39:23.885
if it was in one single location or multiple

633
00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:26.725
locations, but that's beside the point here. But uh

634
00:39:26.735 --> 00:39:32.395
particularly genetically speaking, uh what does that mean that

635
00:39:32.405 --> 00:39:35.385
we are also ultimately African?

636
00:39:35.774 --> 00:39:40.274
It means that if we could trace the ancestry

637
00:39:40.284 --> 00:39:45.129
of any one of us living today, tw 200,000

638
00:39:45.139 --> 00:39:50.189
years back, we would find African ancestors, ancestors living

639
00:39:50.199 --> 00:39:53.479
in Africa because this is where our species evolved

640
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:56.929
and this is where we come from. And this

641
00:39:56.939 --> 00:39:59.429
is the key point with ancestry. So someone who

642
00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:03.909
is perceived as European, they might have, you know,

643
00:40:03.959 --> 00:40:09.610
people ancestors living in Europe say 40,000 uh years

644
00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:13.270
ago or in different places more recently, depending on

645
00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.989
how the ancestors moved. And the key point here

646
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.949
is that whether we are you know, imagine people

647
00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:23.780
who arrived uh until the Americas and were the

648
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:27.590
ancestors of the people we today call native Americans.

649
00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:31.629
These people would have different ancestors, you know, 1020

650
00:40:31.639 --> 00:40:39.070
30 140,000 years ago, depending on where they, their

651
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:42.229
ancestors were found on specific time points. So the

652
00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:44.699
key idea here is that ancestry is not something

653
00:40:44.709 --> 00:40:47.659
that is absolute, but it is relative to time.

654
00:40:47.939 --> 00:40:51.540
And if we specify the reference point in time

655
00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:55.120
we're talking about, then we can define our ancestry

656
00:40:55.129 --> 00:40:58.639
differently. So if that reference point was 200 years

657
00:40:58.649 --> 00:41:02.090
ago, which is, you know, the beginning of our

658
00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:06.080
species, all of us living today would have had

659
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:08.760
ancestors in Africa. And it is in the sense

660
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.239
that I write in the book that we're all

661
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:15.280
ultimately Africans. And this is confirmed not just by,

662
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.500
you know, the evolution of our species, but by

663
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:21.149
the fact that the more we study uh genomes

664
00:41:21.159 --> 00:41:25.489
in Africa uh today, the more uh we find

665
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.889
genetic variation that is not, does not exist elsewhere.

666
00:41:28.899 --> 00:41:31.629
Exactly because as I said, all those millions of

667
00:41:31.639 --> 00:41:34.370
people who live outside Africa, all come from a

668
00:41:34.379 --> 00:41:38.419
very small groups, very small groups of people who

669
00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:41.649
at some point left Africa, those who stayed in

670
00:41:41.659 --> 00:41:46.290
Africa, kept evolving and kept differentiating. And this is

671
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.139
because they have done this for more, they have

672
00:41:49.149 --> 00:41:51.360
a larger genetic variation that we have.

673
00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:58.550
Mhm And uh I mean, ultimately looking across different

674
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.300
human groups. And perhaps even, of course, we are

675
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:05.760
talking mostly about groups here, but even individual humans,

676
00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:10.030
how much do humans and different human groups, even

677
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:15.649
the more distant ones, geographically and historically speaking, how

678
00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:20.149
much do they actually differ genetically? Is there really

679
00:42:20.159 --> 00:42:21.979
much distinction?

680
00:42:22.209 --> 00:42:26.280
No, we know from many studies uh that have

681
00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:30.989
taken place since 1972 by uh uh when we

682
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.760
had a landmark study by Rich and the findings

683
00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:37.760
have more or less been confirmed ever since that,

684
00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:42.719
about 10% of human DNA variation can be found

685
00:42:42.729 --> 00:42:48.669
between continental groups. The remaining 90% perhaps more is

686
00:42:48.679 --> 00:42:53.290
found within continental groups, which means that if we

687
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.899
take randomly four people from whatever place in the

688
00:42:57.909 --> 00:43:00.500
world and compare them, we would not be able

689
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:03.879
to say who is who because all of them

690
00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:09.540
uh would be on average 90% similar perhaps more.

691
00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:14.120
Actually, if we compare randomly any two human genomes,

692
00:43:14.129 --> 00:43:18.270
we find more than 99% similarity. Uh But of

693
00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.419
course, this does not mean that there's no difference

694
00:43:20.429 --> 00:43:23.659
because, you know, for with 3 billion base uh

695
00:43:23.669 --> 00:43:27.399
in DNA, uh you know, 1% or less than

696
00:43:27.409 --> 00:43:30.129
1% is still a lot. But on average, the

697
00:43:30.139 --> 00:43:35.070
variation that we find is mostly found within continental

698
00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.939
groups than between groups. And this is very important

699
00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:38.989
to note.

700
00:43:40.959 --> 00:43:44.600
And also, as you mentioned earlier, even when it

701
00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:48.139
comes to this variation, we should think about it

702
00:43:48.149 --> 00:43:52.129
as being continuous rather than clustered.

703
00:43:52.489 --> 00:43:55.699
Yeah, of course. Now, in specific places, you know,

704
00:43:55.719 --> 00:43:59.040
where there are geographical barriers uh or you know,

705
00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:03.479
between the continents, we may find clusters, but it

706
00:44:03.489 --> 00:44:07.979
depends both on the sampling and on the way

707
00:44:07.989 --> 00:44:10.510
we classify things. So for instance, there was a

708
00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.870
study that has been quite misused and abused uh

709
00:44:13.919 --> 00:44:18.120
in which they let the clusters emerge uh on

710
00:44:18.129 --> 00:44:21.419
their own. And when the number was five, they

711
00:44:21.429 --> 00:44:24.939
found five clusters that roughly corresponded to the five

712
00:44:24.949 --> 00:44:29.300
continents. But this was not the most probable result.

713
00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:33.729
It just happened that with five clusters predefined in

714
00:44:33.739 --> 00:44:39.449
the software to have something that corresponds coincides with

715
00:44:39.459 --> 00:44:42.739
uh the continental variation that we have. But in

716
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:44.919
no way, as I said, was it the most

717
00:44:44.929 --> 00:44:48.500
problem result? And if we kept creating clusters, we

718
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:53.100
would be finding more and more variation. So because

719
00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:57.270
we know we have a long history of scientific

720
00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:02.010
racism as I described in, in the 19th century.

721
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.939
And because we tend to stereotype races by looking

722
00:45:06.949 --> 00:45:11.889
at how people look, we forget the uh amount

723
00:45:11.899 --> 00:45:15.739
of, you know, variation that exists within its rate

724
00:45:15.959 --> 00:45:22.840
and within this biological features and essentializing them makes

725
00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:26.600
us misunderstand the variation and the continuity that exists

726
00:45:27.689 --> 00:45:29.679
uh uh at the same time, you know, uh

727
00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:33.209
skin color, for instance, doesn't say much because there

728
00:45:33.219 --> 00:45:35.399
are about black people in Africa, but there are

729
00:45:35.409 --> 00:45:38.290
also black people in India. So exactly who is

730
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.629
black and how what we define as black is

731
00:45:40.639 --> 00:45:44.090
relevant. And in every continent, we will find many,

732
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:47.590
many different kinds of variations in skill color uh

733
00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.649
or other features. So, the important thing to keep

734
00:45:51.659 --> 00:45:54.919
in mind is that whenever we see clusters, they're

735
00:45:54.929 --> 00:46:00.520
usually arbitrary. Because if we were able to map

736
00:46:00.889 --> 00:46:04.520
all the genetic variation, we would see a continuity.

737
00:46:05.199 --> 00:46:07.500
So there's a study, there was a recent study

738
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:10.080
in New York. Uh I have the graph in

739
00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:13.929
the book with uh a very um uh diligent

740
00:46:13.939 --> 00:46:19.270
sampling that shows overlaps among all kinds of groups.

741
00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.439
Even though we see some people on one side

742
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.360
and some people on another side, there is always

743
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:28.300
a continuity among them and there are always overlaps.

744
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:33.350
So on average, we can separate groups, but we

745
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.300
should keep in mind that these are averages. Uh

746
00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.020
AND think for instance, you know how we compare

747
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:41.629
people in terms of height. We say for instance,

748
00:46:41.639 --> 00:46:45.820
in Europe, that Dutch people are on average taller

749
00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:48.729
than other Europeans. But this doesn't mean that every

750
00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:52.100
Dutch person is taller than everybody else. This is

751
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.830
the key point to, to keep in mind

752
00:46:55.149 --> 00:47:00.050
and what do terms like the natural order mean?

753
00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:05.679
Because that's also sometimes something that people refer to

754
00:47:05.689 --> 00:47:09.250
a sort of natural order when thinking, for example,

755
00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.889
in terms of re or, or even if they

756
00:47:12.899 --> 00:47:15.320
do not refer to the term or do not

757
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:19.610
use the term directly, they are still thinking in

758
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:24.000
terms that would allude to a specific natural order.

759
00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:26.330
What is, what do they mean by that? And

760
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:30.060
in what ways can it be problematic to think

761
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.439
in terms of there being a natural order for

762
00:47:33.449 --> 00:47:35.030
different human groups out there?

763
00:47:35.679 --> 00:47:38.879
WW. Well, there were racist people who think that

764
00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:41.760
the natural order is that some groups are superior

765
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:45.929
to other groups, usually these are white Europeans who

766
00:47:45.939 --> 00:47:49.280
are superior. But if there is any natural order,

767
00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:51.620
in my view, this is that all humans are

768
00:47:51.629 --> 00:47:56.219
related and notwithstanding the differences in appearance in DNA

769
00:47:56.229 --> 00:47:59.860
sequences and everything, the similarities that we have are

770
00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:03.330
many, many, many more than our differences. And in

771
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.040
my view, the only natural order that exists is

772
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:10.800
that all humans belong to the same species and

773
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:12.989
we are all relatives in some sense, we are

774
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.760
all related, of course, some are more distant than

775
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:19.310
others. But there's no way in which we can

776
00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:23.669
distinguish among human groups in terms of uh significant

777
00:48:23.679 --> 00:48:28.489
differences. It is just that by stereotyping, we may

778
00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:32.020
arbitrarily select some like color and say that, you

779
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:34.699
know, uh Africans and Europeans are different in terms

780
00:48:34.709 --> 00:48:37.090
of color. But this is just one feature. The

781
00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:41.500
similarities underlying are found underneath are many, many more

782
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:44.830
and there's no reason to privilege one feature just

783
00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.600
because we see it and think it is very

784
00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:50.800
important. Imagine for instance, if I may add, you

785
00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:53.449
know, that we decided not to separate people by

786
00:48:53.459 --> 00:48:55.250
the color of their skin but by the color

787
00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.520
of their eyes, how, how confusing this would be

788
00:48:58.699 --> 00:49:02.360
arbitrarily, we can make any such decision. But we

789
00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:05.639
know that at the deeper level, uh we are

790
00:49:05.649 --> 00:49:08.679
very, very, very much related than we usually think.

791
00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.239
And what would you say are perhaps some of

792
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:17.989
the most negative social consequences that something like genetic

793
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.260
essentialism has?

794
00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:23.560
Well, the problem is that if we think that,

795
00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:27.350
you know, people living in a specific area belonging

796
00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.350
to specific ethnic group, speaking a specific language uh

797
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:35.919
that this is something due to their DNA, they

798
00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:39.560
may treat people from other places as different as

799
00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:43.120
belonging to other groups. And this all leads to

800
00:49:43.129 --> 00:49:46.409
a divided society and to a contract with a

801
00:49:46.419 --> 00:49:50.830
contrast between us and them. Now, I'm not saying

802
00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:54.429
that people living in an area should be uh

803
00:49:54.439 --> 00:49:57.949
you know, open to anyone coming because I believe

804
00:49:57.959 --> 00:50:02.399
being an immigrant myself, that people when they leave

805
00:50:02.409 --> 00:50:04.770
and go to another country, they have to uh

806
00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:09.310
adapt and respect uh the places they live and

807
00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:13.219
be assimilated in society and be integrated in society

808
00:50:13.229 --> 00:50:15.699
properly. But this has nothing to do with the

809
00:50:15.709 --> 00:50:19.989
DNA. It is cultural social. And so I I

810
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.989
the problem is that we try to explain the

811
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.110
integration problems that some people have due to their

812
00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.260
race or ethnic group or their DNA, even though

813
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:34.389
this is irrelevant because there are, you know, immigrants

814
00:50:34.399 --> 00:50:37.429
in various places who are well integrated and people

815
00:50:37.439 --> 00:50:39.070
from the very same place who are not well

816
00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.929
integrated. And the key issue here is that their

817
00:50:41.939 --> 00:50:45.399
integration does, has anything to do with, has nothing

818
00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:48.459
to do with race, ethnic group or DNA. It

819
00:50:48.469 --> 00:50:50.310
has, it has to do with who these people

820
00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:53.419
are. And this is why we should avoid stereotypes,

821
00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.739
uh, in this way.

822
00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:58.449
Mhm. And that is the other important thing to

823
00:50:58.459 --> 00:51:01.919
keep in mind here. Right. That, uh, when people,

824
00:51:01.929 --> 00:51:06.610
and that unfortunately is something very common when people,

825
00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:12.310
uh derive conclusions about the particular behaviors or of

826
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.610
certain groups of people, sometimes they think in terms

827
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:19.070
of race or ethnicity, of course, based on their,

828
00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.521
for example, in color, they assume that people who

829
00:51:22.531 --> 00:51:27.291
are from particular origins, from particular social groups, races,

830
00:51:27.302 --> 00:51:31.862
whatever that they tend to exhibit particular behaviors that

831
00:51:31.872 --> 00:51:34.961
genes are, I mean, even though, of course, they

832
00:51:34.971 --> 00:51:38.231
do not have directly direct access to their genes,

833
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:41.011
but they assume that they must be from a

834
00:51:41.021 --> 00:51:44.521
particular race. So if these are that particular set

835
00:51:44.531 --> 00:51:48.993
of genes that genes correlate directly to particular behaviors

836
00:51:49.003 --> 00:51:52.864
and even sometimes that cultural differences they see between

837
00:51:52.874 --> 00:51:57.644
groups are genetic in base, uh I mean, that

838
00:51:57.654 --> 00:51:59.364
doesn't make much sense.

839
00:51:59.374 --> 00:52:00.914
No, it doesn't. And you know, this is the

840
00:52:00.924 --> 00:52:04.483
problem with stereotypes. So some Europeans might say, you

841
00:52:04.493 --> 00:52:07.474
know, Greeks are lazy or Greeks are warm and

842
00:52:07.483 --> 00:52:10.976
hospitable depending on the experience they have had. But

843
00:52:10.986 --> 00:52:13.815
the truth is that not all Greeks are lazy,

844
00:52:13.835 --> 00:52:16.186
not all Greeks work as much as they should.

845
00:52:16.226 --> 00:52:19.166
Not, all Greeks are hospital, not all Greeks are

846
00:52:19.176 --> 00:52:22.535
warm or cold. There is of course an average

847
00:52:22.545 --> 00:52:25.545
but it has to do with the limited experiences

848
00:52:25.555 --> 00:52:27.696
that each one of us has. And the big

849
00:52:27.706 --> 00:52:31.335
problem is that usually we tend to generalize from,

850
00:52:31.345 --> 00:52:34.827
you know, a very small sample of our instances

851
00:52:35.187 --> 00:52:38.308
to what happens. Plus of course, there are historical

852
00:52:38.318 --> 00:52:42.847
stereotypes that are maintained and it is easy to

853
00:52:42.857 --> 00:52:47.397
explain them in terms of DNA. Because psychological essentialism

854
00:52:47.407 --> 00:52:50.998
makes us find look for essences and you know,

855
00:52:51.008 --> 00:52:54.038
DNA is the best place holder we could have

856
00:52:54.048 --> 00:52:57.028
for this. So the key point here is for

857
00:52:57.038 --> 00:53:02.540
us to look at individuals and avoid, avoid their

858
00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:05.810
music and inferences based on the group, whatever that

859
00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:10.169
group it is that they belong and whatever we

860
00:53:10.179 --> 00:53:12.739
do, we should keep in mind that this has

861
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:13.889
nothing to do with the DNA.

862
00:53:14.919 --> 00:53:18.139
Mhm. So let me ask you one last question.

863
00:53:18.149 --> 00:53:21.070
Then we've been focusing a lot on some of

864
00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:26.020
the negative effects that being exposed to this sort

865
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:29.469
of genetic information coming from DNA tests might have

866
00:53:29.479 --> 00:53:33.975
on people individually and also socially. Do you think

867
00:53:33.985 --> 00:53:39.354
that the idea of ancestry can also have sometimes

868
00:53:39.364 --> 00:53:43.784
positive effects for people? And can that also come

869
00:53:43.794 --> 00:53:46.284
from DNA testing or?

870
00:53:46.875 --> 00:53:51.750
Well ancestry is important? And uh for instance, as

871
00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.870
I I write in the conclusion of my book,

872
00:53:53.879 --> 00:53:56.770
I consider myself Greek, why because I was born

873
00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:59.270
in Greece. This is the place where my parents,

874
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.419
grandparents, great grandparents were born. As far as I

875
00:54:02.429 --> 00:54:04.929
know, I speak the language of the people who

876
00:54:04.939 --> 00:54:06.729
live there. I think in the same way with

877
00:54:06.739 --> 00:54:10.209
the people live there. And this is my ancestry

878
00:54:10.219 --> 00:54:13.800
and this is the culture I'm proud of. This

879
00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:15.669
has nothing to do with my DNA. And I

880
00:54:15.679 --> 00:54:19.419
don't need my DNA to confirm this in any

881
00:54:19.429 --> 00:54:23.729
way because uh ancestry has to do with my

882
00:54:23.739 --> 00:54:28.250
upbringing, has to do with my culture. Uh The

883
00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.760
DNA could not confirm or discon confirm any of

884
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:34.790
this. Imagine I took a test and found the

885
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.620
test said that I belong to, I don't know

886
00:54:36.669 --> 00:54:39.870
whatever group would this change who I am? No,

887
00:54:39.879 --> 00:54:41.870
in no way, it wouldn't change the language I

888
00:54:41.879 --> 00:54:44.120
speak and the language in which I think and

889
00:54:44.129 --> 00:54:48.840
the traditions and the cultures I follow. So ancestry

890
00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:52.090
is something very important. But we have to be

891
00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:56.449
careful when we correlate it with our DNA. It

892
00:54:56.459 --> 00:54:59.209
makes sense to think about DNA only when we

893
00:54:59.219 --> 00:55:02.219
do not know much about ancestry. Because in this

894
00:55:02.229 --> 00:55:07.100
case, by using DNA, we might find some relatives,

895
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:11.030
some people with whom we have recent common ancestors

896
00:55:11.129 --> 00:55:13.419
and through them, it might be possible to learn

897
00:55:13.429 --> 00:55:16.889
something about our past. But this should be done

898
00:55:16.899 --> 00:55:22.290
with caution and we should not destroy in any

899
00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:26.270
way what we know about ourselves. It is only

900
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:28.340
when we do not know much, but it can

901
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:28.979
be useful.

902
00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.419
Uh And also, and this is a point that

903
00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:37.530
we touched on earlier if people really correctly look

904
00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:41.449
at genetic data and they interpret it correctly uh

905
00:55:41.459 --> 00:55:45.320
as they can do. So, after learning from your

906
00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:49.729
book, for example, the ancestry might also be a

907
00:55:49.739 --> 00:55:54.739
ve a very positive uh term or, or concept

908
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:59.370
if people understand that we are all ultimately related

909
00:55:59.379 --> 00:56:00.340
to one another.

910
00:56:00.639 --> 00:56:03.270
Yeah. A actually, this is the the most uh

911
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:06.135
the single most important conclusion of this studies of

912
00:56:06.145 --> 00:56:10.905
DNA, that the differences among humans are very few

913
00:56:10.965 --> 00:56:13.834
than similarities at the level of DNA are so

914
00:56:13.844 --> 00:56:15.804
many in the sense that we are all a

915
00:56:15.814 --> 00:56:18.524
big family. And if there is one conclusion, it

916
00:56:18.534 --> 00:56:22.409
should be that our species is very recent. Uh

917
00:56:22.419 --> 00:56:25.780
It has evolved for a few 1000 years compared

918
00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:28.600
to what has happened in other species and we

919
00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:34.030
have not diverged much to be able to identify

920
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:36.169
the differences. Some people are looking for

921
00:56:37.439 --> 00:56:42.139
great. So the book is again, ancestry reimagine dismantling,

922
00:56:42.149 --> 00:56:45.570
dismantling the myth of genetic ethnicities. I'm leaving a

923
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:48.040
link to it in the description of the interview.

924
00:56:48.239 --> 00:56:51.260
And Doctor Korra is uh uh before we go

925
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:53.780
apart from the book, would you also like to

926
00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:56.189
tell people where they can find you and the

927
00:56:56.199 --> 00:56:58.260
rest of your work on the internet?

928
00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:01.620
Yeah. Well, I have a personal page with my

929
00:57:01.629 --> 00:57:05.719
surname kuris.com where there are links to all my

930
00:57:05.729 --> 00:57:09.219
books and my, my, my big interest and my

931
00:57:09.229 --> 00:57:13.810
big aim is to help people understand science and

932
00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:17.629
understand what science can and cannot tell them. And

933
00:57:17.639 --> 00:57:22.800
unfortunately DNA ancestry testing can say a lot but

934
00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:25.570
not what people usually think of. As I said

935
00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:29.649
in the beginning, it's mostly about family and recent

936
00:57:29.669 --> 00:57:32.709
uh and relatives with whom we have recent common

937
00:57:32.719 --> 00:57:35.699
ancestors. The tests are very good at finding close

938
00:57:35.709 --> 00:57:39.149
relatives, very, very good, but this does not necessarily

939
00:57:39.159 --> 00:57:40.979
have to do much with our ancestry.

940
00:57:42.399 --> 00:57:46.100
Great. So, Doctor Kuraki, thank you so much for
