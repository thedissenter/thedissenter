00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.759
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.599
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:08.159
today I'm joined for a third time by Doctor

4
00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.720
Menelausa Postolo. Uh, I'm, I'm leaving the link, the

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.279
links to our first two interviews in the description

6
00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:16.680
down below. And today we're going to talk about

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.469
singlehood from an evolutionary perspective. So, Doctor Apostolo, welcome

8
00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:23.510
back to the show. It's always a pleasure to

9
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.649
everyone.

10
00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:27.159
Hello, uh, and very nice to see you again.

11
00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.649
Um, AND I guess this is like I know

12
00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:36.330
of a topic singlehood, uh, uh, that's like, um.

13
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:40.000
Uh, YOU know, a lot of people, uh, are,

14
00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:43.450
are going to be interested in this. Um, ONE

15
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.380
reason is that, uh, everybody, um, is born single,

16
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.639
right, so, uh, sure, yes, it's kind of, it's

17
00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:54.560
a phenomenon that everybody experiences, it's not like, uh,

18
00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:58.490
uh, me, you or, uh, so everybody has at

19
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.090
least some experience of this. Mhm.

20
00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.500
Yes, and, and so just to introduce the topic,

21
00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:09.870
how do you approach singlehood from an evolutionary perspective

22
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.470
specifically?

23
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.930
Yeah, so, uh, mainly I approach everything from an

24
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.970
evolutionary perspective, everything related to human behavior. Uh, SO

25
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.489
the reason being that, um, uh, human behavior comes

26
00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:27.610
from the brain, uh, the brain is a product

27
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.889
of evolutionary, uh, processes, um, uh, so all human

28
00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:37.150
behavior has an evolutionary logic. Uh, SO it doesn't

29
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.819
really matter if it's singlehood or something else, um,

30
00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.400
uh, it's kind of, you know, evolution a general,

31
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.910
um, umbrella if you want a general theory of

32
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.650
understanding human behavior. Now with singlehood seems to be

33
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.290
a bit of a paradox because um in evolutionary

34
00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.040
perspective, um, The nature of human behavior is mainly

35
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.930
to enable yourself to survive, reproduce, or help your

36
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.380
uh genetic relatives to do so. So it's kind

37
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.919
of Paradox, um sorry, singlehood because, um, well, if

38
00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:20.479
it comes to reproduction, we expect that this was

39
00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:25.309
uh sexually reproducing species. WOULD expect that um you

40
00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.949
know, most people uh would get into relationships, have

41
00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:33.910
children, and so on. Um, HOWEVER, a considerable proportion

42
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.720
of people. They are single, that is they don't

43
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.720
have an intimate partner. Uh, LET me also say

44
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.600
here is that when, that's what I mean by

45
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.880
singlehood because in the past they you say someone's

46
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.919
single, if you're not married, right? So I mean

47
00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.630
here single, uh, you don't have an intimate partner.

48
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.500
And it's like a common phenomenon. So we just

49
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.160
try to. RESOLVE this paradox that, OK, fine. All

50
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.880
right, we're we're a species that um we're sexually

51
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.639
reproducing species, uh uh uh having an intimate relationship

52
00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.149
is, is important for reproduction and for survival. Um,

53
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.500
uh, SO the question is that why so many

54
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.410
people are uh are single. Um, SO here we,

55
00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:24.600
uh, I can discuss some. Ultimate reasons, evolutionary reasons

56
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.169
why this might be the case and I can

57
00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.669
just um discuss research on the proximate reasons of

58
00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:36.639
uh uh what's going on uh there. um, BUT

59
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.240
that's the general idea start to resolve this paradox,

60
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.669
uh, given that, um. Uh, IN our species kind

61
00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.119
of important to have, uh, an intimate relationship.

62
00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:56.589
Mhm. But we have both voluntary and involuntary singlehood,

63
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.679
right?

64
00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.070
All right. So I would say that, I mean

65
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.860
if we're going to, I would just I think

66
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.639
that the best way to approach it uh is

67
00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.899
uh um maybe discuss a bit more about what

68
00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:14.770
it's important to to be in an intimate relationship,

69
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.559
to see this is why this is a paradox.

70
00:04:18.178 --> 00:04:20.140
So it's kind of, so what's important. I mean

71
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.369
the obvious. What an evolutionary terms, uh, so the

72
00:04:24.369 --> 00:04:29.850
obvious one is, uh, uh, reproduction. However, if you

73
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.359
start thinking about it, it might not be so

74
00:04:32.359 --> 00:04:34.489
obvious because someone would say that you can have

75
00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:37.329
just sex and have children, right? You don't have

76
00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:44.040
to get involved into something. However, Uh, Uh, those

77
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.079
who have children, they will know that this is

78
00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:50.470
not an easy, uh, task, right? You have to,

79
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.290
um, uh, spend considerable resources, um, it's like quite

80
00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.950
prolonged, uh, investment, um, and it's kind of, uh,

81
00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:09.399
it's not easy for one individual to bear. So

82
00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:13.410
if you really want. To have children that survive

83
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.480
and reach sexual maturity, especially during human evolution, uh,

84
00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:22.290
human evolution time, uh, it works best if you

85
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.989
create a family. Right, so it's kind of not

86
00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:27.809
just like having sex and then move on, um,

87
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.690
just staying for with someone, uh, for a prolonged

88
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.549
period of time, uh, and invest in children. Uh,

89
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.290
SO this is like I would say the main

90
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.529
reason, uh, uh, that selection forces have favored a

91
00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:49.670
human mind um that is interested. Uh, IN creating,

92
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.119
uh, uh, long-term intimate relationships. There are, um, reasons

93
00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:56.859
there. So for instance, if you just have like

94
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.320
a partner, this is a kind of, this is

95
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.269
a source of support, for instance, financial emotional uh

96
00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:07.779
and uh protection uh which uh are very useful,

97
00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:11.239
were very useful during human evolutionary time, so there

98
00:06:11.239 --> 00:06:13.970
are no social protection systems or uh. Uh, I

99
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.380
don't know, unemployment benefits or anything, so, uh, people

100
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.309
had to rely on their families. Um, SO, you

101
00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:25.880
see here it's kind of Having a long intimate

102
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:32.329
relationship. Is crucial for survival and reproduction. Uh, WHICH

103
00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:35.420
means that selection forces have shaped the mind to

104
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.579
do so, which is kind of what we observe

105
00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:42.059
in general. So across society and across time, most

106
00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:44.619
people would enter into such relationships. We call this

107
00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:47.980
marriages. It's a human universal and eventually most people

108
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.779
would enter something like that. But now We observe

109
00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:57.320
also that some people are not into it. Ah,

110
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.339
they are so called singer, right, so it's kind

111
00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:07.269
of. How this paradox then could be resolved, um,

112
00:07:07.609 --> 00:07:09.690
and uh I would suggest there are 3 main

113
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.649
reasons for this that map to the types of

114
00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:18.730
singlehood you mentioned. Um, SO there are ultimately, I

115
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.529
mean, in evolutionary terms, there are 3 main reasons

116
00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:27.690
why someone uh is single. Uh, ONE is That

117
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.510
If you are to successfully participate in the mating

118
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:37.920
market, um, you need some preparation, right? So it's

119
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.549
kind of not only in mating market, most of

120
00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:45.010
the things, um, uh, most of the challenging things,

121
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.899
um. And singlehood gives you this kind of time

122
00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:52.500
and focus to prepare. So for instance, some people

123
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.940
might say, I mean, in the long term mating

124
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.929
market things like um a good education, a good

125
00:07:57.929 --> 00:08:01.420
job are valued in a partner. However, you're not

126
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.450
born with this, right, so it's kind of um

127
00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:08.660
uh uh uh you have to focus your energy,

128
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.809
develop, let's say, uh, your talents, your strengths, uh,

129
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.510
career advancements, so it's kind of If you are

130
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:22.529
single, you can focus on doing these things, um,

131
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.709
so it would work I mean this kind of

132
00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:30.869
way, this is profitable, um, uh, to be single

133
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:33.109
for a period of time. So it could be

134
00:08:33.109 --> 00:08:37.789
like, um, I'm, I'm single for some time so

135
00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.780
I can focus on just getting this job promotion,

136
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.109
uh, get this, uh, university degree, and then when

137
00:08:45.109 --> 00:08:48.950
I Look better, let's say in the mating market,

138
00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:51.880
I get, I, I come back. Uh, THIS is

139
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.559
one reason that explain uh what you said, I

140
00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:58.630
mean voluntary, uh, singlehood. There is people are single

141
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.159
for this reason. Uh, THEY would just say, all

142
00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:03.359
right, I would prefer for some time to be

143
00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:12.349
single, uh, so I can, um. Develop myself. All

144
00:09:12.349 --> 00:09:18.690
right, that would explain. Uh, VOLUNTARY singlehood, um, uh,

145
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.530
and then, um, I mean when we, uh, uh,

146
00:09:21.539 --> 00:09:24.539
we do research on actually approximate now regions, I

147
00:09:24.539 --> 00:09:26.580
mean what people would say why they're single, they

148
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.659
would say that, you know, I want to be

149
00:09:27.659 --> 00:09:30.630
single to be to have freedom of, uh, uh,

150
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.369
choice to be able to focus on my career,

151
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.669
on my, um, education, to do whatever I want,

152
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:44.500
um, so this is one. Uh, uh, REGION. Um,

153
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:52.539
NOW, the other one. Is that People move between

154
00:09:52.539 --> 00:09:55.820
relationships, right? So let's say I am in a

155
00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.659
relationship for some reason uh the relationship ended and

156
00:10:00.659 --> 00:10:02.929
I move to another one and take some time

157
00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:05.700
to find another partner, so it's kind of uh

158
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:11.260
um between relationships single. If you want, um, now

159
00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:16.260
this is common for different reasons. Um, ONE reason

160
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.500
is that it's not easy to find, uh, a

161
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.880
good match, uh, a proper partner. And why it's

162
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.159
not easy. Well, There are different reasons again for

163
00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:31.210
this. It's like one is deception. So there's a

164
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.729
lot of deception in the mating market, you know,

165
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.890
people uh would present themselves differently than they uh

166
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.609
really are, um, and, uh, so it can have

167
00:10:41.609 --> 00:10:44.340
like, you know, you, you are in a relationship

168
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:49.020
uh and eventually figure out this is not. Good

169
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.940
for you is not what you originally thought uh

170
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.570
it was, so you move on to the next,

171
00:10:55.869 --> 00:11:01.239
um, or relates to figuring out what yourself, what

172
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.140
you want. So just try some people, yeah, just

173
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.750
try to get experiences and figuring out what's, you

174
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.710
know, what they want and uh uh what's best

175
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.590
for them so that eventually they move uh between

176
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.349
relationships to find the right one. Uh, COULD be

177
00:11:18.349 --> 00:11:21.630
Unfortunate reasons, uh, it's like kind of uh uh

178
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.469
uh bad luck. Let's say your partner dies, let's

179
00:11:24.469 --> 00:11:28.940
say or moves to another country, um. Um, SO

180
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.140
these are some of the reasons, um, that make

181
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.780
it a bit difficult to find the proper uh

182
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.260
mate and you have to move, move between relationships

183
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:45.010
which results in a in some people being single

184
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.830
because they are between relationships. Um, Now the third

185
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.260
main reason and uh I would say this is

186
00:11:53.349 --> 00:11:56.950
the main one, it relates to the mismatch problem.

187
00:11:57.809 --> 00:12:03.260
Uh, SO OK, so they Uh, the brain is

188
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.900
like has several behavioral adaptations that aim to uh.

189
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:14.989
Um, Uh, To enable individuals to increase their survival

190
00:12:14.989 --> 00:12:21.020
and reproductive success. However, uh, this was like the,

191
00:12:21.109 --> 00:12:22.739
what we see today is the product of a

192
00:12:22.739 --> 00:12:31.020
long evolutionary process. Which means um that. Our adaptations

193
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.969
have evolved um to do this to increase our

194
00:12:34.969 --> 00:12:38.809
reproductive and survival success or fitness um in the

195
00:12:38.809 --> 00:12:43.130
ancestral environment and might not work very well in

196
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:48.729
the contemporary one if it's like different, considerably different

197
00:12:48.729 --> 00:12:52.609
from, uh from the ancestral one. I think perhaps

198
00:12:52.609 --> 00:12:56.330
the The best example and an obvious example you

199
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.549
can see is that you have some extra weight

200
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.330
and um and a lot of people do and

201
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.489
uh this comes from the fact that uh during

202
00:13:06.489 --> 00:13:13.239
human evolution, food was cars so um. Our adaptation,

203
00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:17.109
uh, our food intake adaptations have evolved so as

204
00:13:17.109 --> 00:13:21.640
to um when you find food, uh, eat more

205
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.429
than you need, store the extra in fat, um,

206
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.789
and then next day that probably there's no food,

207
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.640
uh, you can use the deserves. However, this doesn't

208
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.400
work very well in a contemporary environment because food

209
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.520
is always available and cheap. There are like supermarkets

210
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.080
24/7. I mean, it's like, um, so that's why

211
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.719
a lot of people, including me, um, are suffering.

212
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.919
I mean we have like like more weight than

213
00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:52.919
we should. Um, NOW, here comes also to mating

214
00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:55.489
that we have like situations where it's kind of

215
00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:02.289
um uh uh uh in the past, the mating

216
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.900
market was very different from what is today and

217
00:14:07.219 --> 00:14:11.849
the main difference was that in the past, um

218
00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:18.270
there was uh considerable control. Overm by parents. This

219
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:22.669
is called what's sometimes called arranged marriage. Um, SO

220
00:14:22.669 --> 00:14:26.830
parents, uh, so when you are young, uh, when

221
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.599
let's say you go about 1516 or whatever, uh,

222
00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:33.460
they would arrange, uh, your marriage with someone else,

223
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:39.229
um, and that would be it, um, which means

224
00:14:39.229 --> 00:14:45.210
that Adaptations in relate to mate have evolved in

225
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.409
this context. Now in our context today, uh it

226
00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:53.770
is um uh the the situation is different, that

227
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:57.369
is we have to find our mates. Um, WHICH

228
00:14:57.369 --> 00:14:59.159
means that we're not, might not be ready for

229
00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:02.119
this. I mean it's like a cognitive, uh, uh,

230
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:07.320
hardware, uh, might face difficulties in this talents, um,

231
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:12.130
which could result in a situation where people have

232
00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:17.710
a difficult time attracting mates, uh, or keeping uh

233
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.059
them, um, and this gives rise to involuntary singlehood,

234
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:26.549
uh. That is people uh want to be in

235
00:15:26.549 --> 00:15:31.799
a relationship, uh, but facing difficulties in attracting a

236
00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:34.020
mate. So I mean if we just put together

237
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:36.140
the reasons, I would say that the kind of,

238
00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:38.710
uh, I mean it's like in evolutionary analysis to

239
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.669
understand this, this phenomenon I would say that there

240
00:15:40.669 --> 00:15:43.340
are three main reasons. It's like, and one is

241
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.789
um that it could be beneficial uh to stay

242
00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:50.669
single for some time. Uh, THE second is that

243
00:15:50.669 --> 00:15:54.409
it's difficult to um Uh, to find the right

244
00:15:54.409 --> 00:15:59.150
partner, so people move between relationships and uh, the

245
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.950
third is the mismatch problem. It's like the contemporary

246
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:06.710
environment is different from the ancestral one, and, uh,

247
00:16:06.719 --> 00:16:12.000
our adaptations might not be very, um, let's say

248
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.909
efficient in, uh, in dealing with the challenges of

249
00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:19.830
the modern mating market resulting into people facing difficulties

250
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.739
in attracting a mate and then being single.

251
00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:27.169
OK, so, but when it comes to the biggest

252
00:16:27.169 --> 00:16:30.640
difficulties that people have or report, when it comes

253
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.960
to attracting mates, are there gender differences here? Is

254
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.119
it that uh different kinds of difficulties are reported

255
00:16:39.119 --> 00:16:41.789
by men and women or not?

256
00:16:42.159 --> 00:16:49.700
Um, JUST to Tell you the. Uh, THE, the

257
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.500
general, um, or, well, let me just summarize our

258
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.010
findings and I will just go to, uh, uh,

259
00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.979
um, uh, to this, uh, differences, um, so it

260
00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.940
says, uh, first of all, it's kind of, OK,

261
00:17:02.979 --> 00:17:04.650
what is it for is the, is the theory,

262
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.810
right, it's like what we, how we could explain

263
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.709
the phenomenon. Um, BUT this doesn't mean that it's

264
00:17:11.709 --> 00:17:14.569
necessarily true, right? So, um, let's go to the

265
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:17.608
empirical now evidence and because this was like a

266
00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:25.388
phenomenon that's kind of unexplored, um. I would say

267
00:17:25.708 --> 00:17:29.149
um we started with a different kind of approach.

268
00:17:29.269 --> 00:17:33.288
We started with asking people, uh, single people, uh,

269
00:17:33.298 --> 00:17:38.338
why they were single, um, and while using different

270
00:17:38.688 --> 00:17:44.828
methods like that, interviews, opening questionnaires, uh, uh, posts

271
00:17:44.828 --> 00:17:47.909
on the internet, um, we got like with a,

272
00:17:47.989 --> 00:17:53.708
with a bigger list, like more than 90 regions.

273
00:17:54.170 --> 00:18:02.310
And uh, then, um. In larger samples. We asked

274
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.619
single people to rate these reasons. I mean, why

275
00:18:04.619 --> 00:18:06.839
you are single, this, this reason, the other or

276
00:18:06.839 --> 00:18:13.540
whatever, and using statistical analysis, um we got uh

277
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:21.689
Uh, we classify this into um three main categories

278
00:18:21.969 --> 00:18:26.209
that sort of I reflect more or less what

279
00:18:26.209 --> 00:18:30.199
I discussed before, so been between relationships um uh

280
00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:35.530
uh uh having difficulties in attracting uh mates and

281
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:41.609
uh uh um uh um have freedom to do

282
00:18:41.609 --> 00:18:46.439
what you want. So Let me, right, if I

283
00:18:46.439 --> 00:18:49.439
just go through some of this data. So for

284
00:18:49.439 --> 00:18:53.199
instance, the between relationships, uh, category, people would report

285
00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:56.560
that, you know, that between relationships, um, they have

286
00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.560
difficulties finding the right one, or they have a

287
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.300
fear that they will get hurt, um. So that

288
00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.859
was one category. The other main category was uh

289
00:19:07.859 --> 00:19:10.339
freedom, where people indicate that they want to be

290
00:19:10.339 --> 00:19:12.459
free to do whatever they want to focus on

291
00:19:12.459 --> 00:19:16.189
their career, um, but even to be free to

292
00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:18.939
flirt around, which is kind of a way perhaps

293
00:19:18.939 --> 00:19:24.040
to improve their flirting skills. And um the third

294
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.800
category was a poor capacity to attract mates which

295
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.810
included things like, you know, it's like flirting um

296
00:19:32.719 --> 00:19:36.020
not very, not being very good in flirting, um,

297
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:40.660
uh, um, having poor looks, having some uh sexual

298
00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:47.109
difficulties, um, um, uh, have some psychological problems and,

299
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.869
you know, in this kind of, these things are

300
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.250
keep people back. So, however, the, the interesting bit

301
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:58.250
here is that the structure. Um, THE structure of,

302
00:19:58.699 --> 00:20:03.219
of, uh. Of these regions follows this theoretical logic,

303
00:20:03.229 --> 00:20:06.020
right, so it's kind of, that's how it goes.

304
00:20:06.589 --> 00:20:14.010
Now we investigated. Uh, uh, SEX differences, that is,

305
00:20:14.459 --> 00:20:17.060
if you know, just like men and woman would

306
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:22.890
see differently, we found some. Uh, HOWEVER, in general,

307
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:28.719
uh, it seems that. The, this, these differences were

308
00:20:28.719 --> 00:20:34.239
not considerable or the, the structure of um of

309
00:20:34.239 --> 00:20:37.000
the regions were very similar between men and and

310
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.910
women. So I would probably say it's kind of

311
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:49.420
uh uh There are sex differences but not major

312
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.510
ones. I mean, most, I would say this, this,

313
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.349
this regions apply to uh more or less uh

314
00:20:55.349 --> 00:20:57.689
to both sexes. Mhm.

315
00:20:58.709 --> 00:21:02.420
Uh, AND another thing that you've studied is, uh,

316
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.109
related to being able to attract a mate, of

317
00:21:05.109 --> 00:21:08.469
course, is strategies that people use for becoming a

318
00:21:08.469 --> 00:21:13.140
more desirable mate across different cultures. So, first off,

319
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.670
what are the different kinds of strategies that people

320
00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:16.989
employ?

321
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:22.500
All right. Um, NOW, this was kind of. Or

322
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.579
to be effective in. In, in, in, in Greece.

323
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:35.719
Um, um. Well, Well employ several strategies to make

324
00:21:35.719 --> 00:21:38.969
them more desirable as mates and could be because

325
00:21:38.969 --> 00:21:43.000
of the mismatch problem. Some people are not very

326
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.920
effective in doing this. So we investigate this could

327
00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.479
be like kind of also in a way to

328
00:21:48.729 --> 00:21:50.760
uh to help people, you know, get ideas of

329
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.800
how they improve themselves, um, yeah, in these areas.

330
00:21:55.199 --> 00:21:59.655
Um, SO there are different Strategies in something like

331
00:21:59.655 --> 00:22:03.704
involving like things like improving on uh one's looks

332
00:22:03.984 --> 00:22:08.064
um in um working on uh on their strengths,

333
00:22:08.265 --> 00:22:11.055
uh discussing about their strengths, hiding let's say perhaps

334
00:22:11.055 --> 00:22:16.750
some of undesirable qualities. Um, THIS could go even

335
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:21.640
further to research we do currently do, uh, that

336
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.280
involves deception. But it's like it's a different things

337
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.260
it's like to present myself. I mean, to, to

338
00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:34.469
highlight my um strengths. um OK, so that's one

339
00:22:34.469 --> 00:22:39.390
strategy, that's one main strategy, but uh uh and

340
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.180
then it goes a step further to lie about

341
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.329
my strengths. So it's like So I, if I'm

342
00:22:45.329 --> 00:22:48.130
well off, I can sort of highlight this. So

343
00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.569
that's one strategy of promotion, right? So I kind

344
00:22:50.569 --> 00:22:52.530
of get like a promotion, so I get like

345
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:56.569
a big car, um, or an expensive car. Uh,

346
00:22:56.729 --> 00:23:01.369
HOWEVER, people um would go a step further and

347
00:23:01.369 --> 00:23:03.680
lie about it, so I'm not that well off,

348
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.079
uh, but I borrow your car which is kind

349
00:23:07.079 --> 00:23:09.969
of uh nice and fancy and I present this

350
00:23:09.969 --> 00:23:13.469
mine, so it's kind of uh. Which kind, I

351
00:23:13.469 --> 00:23:18.290
mean, because this is kind of A reason, uh,

352
00:23:18.319 --> 00:23:21.939
uh, for singlehood because then I present myself to

353
00:23:21.939 --> 00:23:26.579
someone else and if I'm successful. Some women will

354
00:23:26.579 --> 00:23:28.880
fall for this and then they will just come

355
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:32.609
um but eventually the strategies are sort of this

356
00:23:32.609 --> 00:23:34.729
of this decision are short term. So eventually they

357
00:23:34.729 --> 00:23:37.959
will figure out that I'm not. That wealthy or

358
00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:41.280
whatever, uh, and they will move on to another

359
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.520
relationship, giving rise to, to this between relationship singlehood.

360
00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.900
So I mean all these are interrelated. Um, uh,

361
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.170
BUT again, go, go back to your questions kind

362
00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:57.660
of people use different strategies, mainly aiming, um, uh,

363
00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:01.530
to work on their strengths and then highlight their,

364
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.219
the, these trends to perspective, uh, uh, mate, let's

365
00:24:05.219 --> 00:24:09.380
say improving uh their looks, um, but I would

366
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:14.209
say that. Probably one reason that people are single

367
00:24:14.209 --> 00:24:16.560
is not, is that, are not very effective in

368
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.680
deploying the strategies and one reason they're not very

369
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:24.040
effective in deploying the strategies is because um uh

370
00:24:24.239 --> 00:24:26.760
of the mismatch problems. So that let's say for

371
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.880
instance we notice in the data that um people,

372
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:39.219
some people wouldn't um let's say uh. Um, uh,

373
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.829
WORK on their looks, right, which is an important

374
00:24:41.829 --> 00:24:44.390
part in in the free mating context, right, it's

375
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.020
kind of, it's an important strategy of self promotion

376
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.060
and then people just just don't care at all,

377
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.260
um, uh, which has an impact on their, uh,

378
00:24:55.739 --> 00:24:59.780
success in the mating market, um, uh, and why

379
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.229
they don't care at all because, uh, in the

380
00:25:02.229 --> 00:25:07.500
past, um, There was, uh, you know, Sara's marriage

381
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.729
and, uh, where parents let's say would arrange marriages,

382
00:25:11.739 --> 00:25:14.020
they wouldn't care at all about they would care

383
00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.900
but not considerably about the looks, let's say of

384
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.030
their perspective, uh, in-laws, right, so this is, this

385
00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:24.020
is, this is not their, their concern, right, it's

386
00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:29.099
kind of um um so if, if this is

387
00:25:29.099 --> 00:25:33.310
not very important then making market, so, uh. So

388
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.630
I don't care about this because it doesn't really

389
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.680
matter how I look, um, my marriage would be

390
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.270
arranged, um, but this has a price now, right?

391
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.550
It's like kind of people, they don't deploy this

392
00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:49.520
strategy of self promotion and the, the looks are

393
00:25:49.829 --> 00:25:51.949
poor because they don't pay attention to this and

394
00:25:51.949 --> 00:25:57.030
this, which it's it's, it's an impediment, um. Uh,

395
00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.900
IN finding a, a maintain this cause of like

396
00:26:01.189 --> 00:26:03.550
one of the causes of singlehood. Mhm.

397
00:26:04.489 --> 00:26:07.800
But do these strategies for becoming a more desirable

398
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.949
mate vary across culturally?

399
00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:17.760
Um, WE, uh, uh, we did some cross cultural

400
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.829
reasons, and as usual, there is variation. This variation.

401
00:26:21.969 --> 00:26:26.369
However, I would say is that um uh there's

402
00:26:26.369 --> 00:26:30.689
also considerable consistency in the structure and uh what

403
00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:34.770
people would uh would use. However, there is a

404
00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:38.130
limitation now, Richard, it's kind of, we focus on

405
00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.489
contemporary post-industrial societies. So I would say in these

406
00:26:41.489 --> 00:26:45.770
societies, um, paying attention to looks, it's like it

407
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:50.910
was a consistent strategy found. Um, ACROSS different cultures,

408
00:26:50.949 --> 00:26:53.449
however, I don't know if it's going to be

409
00:26:53.449 --> 00:26:57.050
the same if we go in a pre-industrial context.

410
00:26:57.359 --> 00:26:59.239
So I would say, I would probably say that

411
00:26:59.489 --> 00:27:03.329
there is variation, but there is considerable consistency uh

412
00:27:03.329 --> 00:27:08.449
in post-industrial societies. Um, I, I, I suspect there

413
00:27:08.449 --> 00:27:12.319
will be more variation if you compare uh post-industrial

414
00:27:12.569 --> 00:27:17.150
um and pre-industrial societies. Mhm.

415
00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:22.420
So you've also studied uh the connection between the

416
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:27.459
fear of relationship, commitment and singlehood. Would you like

417
00:27:27.459 --> 00:27:28.569
to tell us about that?

418
00:27:29.069 --> 00:27:34.359
All right. uh, SO it's. OK, um, I could

419
00:27:34.359 --> 00:27:40.859
say that. All right, so some, my pay. For

420
00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:44.300
people to be single, uh, for some period of

421
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.560
time. So let's say to focus on your strengths,

422
00:27:46.619 --> 00:27:53.250
to, uh, to do different things. How this would

423
00:27:53.599 --> 00:27:58.420
uh materialize that is in your mental accounting so

424
00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:02.089
like It's not always that you would think like

425
00:28:02.089 --> 00:28:05.109
that. It's kind of, you might, this would be

426
00:28:05.109 --> 00:28:08.989
like um reflect on your emotions, so perhaps you

427
00:28:08.989 --> 00:28:10.869
don't feel like being in a relationship or have

428
00:28:10.869 --> 00:28:15.719
a fear. Of being committed into one. SO this

429
00:28:15.719 --> 00:28:20.800
would be one reason why people um have this

430
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.800
fear to keep them away from a relationship for

431
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.839
a while so that uh they can focus on

432
00:28:26.839 --> 00:28:31.390
different things. However, this is again a complex phenomenon,

433
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.510
it has more, more to it, right. So what

434
00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:38.280
happens is that When you get into a relationship.

435
00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:40.920
And it's not a good one, it's not a

436
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:48.219
fitness increasing. Uh, THIS can cause emotional pain. Which

437
00:28:48.219 --> 00:28:52.689
is good because it's kind of. Your way to

438
00:28:52.689 --> 00:28:54.290
tell you that you have to do something about

439
00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.650
it. You either improve the relationship or get out

440
00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:03.719
of it. Um So This Pain has sort of

441
00:29:03.719 --> 00:29:06.550
a a scarring effect that is, it's like a

442
00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:09.119
scar. So when you are out of it, it

443
00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:13.439
sort of helps you um to consider what went

444
00:29:13.439 --> 00:29:17.290
wrong, right, uh so that it, it won't happen

445
00:29:17.729 --> 00:29:22.560
um in the future and to consider what went

446
00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.569
wrong and improve it, you might need some time.

447
00:29:25.959 --> 00:29:29.760
So it's kind of this pain keeps like causing

448
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.079
a fear of relationships when you are out of

449
00:29:32.079 --> 00:29:36.030
them. So probably uh this is a way to

450
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:39.469
keep you outside of the mating market for a

451
00:29:39.469 --> 00:29:42.930
while so you can, you know, improve on what

452
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.109
went wrong, to see what, what went wrong, um,

453
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.069
what I did wrong, um, and improve so it

454
00:29:49.069 --> 00:29:53.160
doesn't happen, uh, to you. Um, SO it comes

455
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.020
from. I would say probably this is the main

456
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.949
reason it's kind of um experience from the relations

457
00:29:59.949 --> 00:30:05.579
might cause like kind of uh some um negative

458
00:30:06.069 --> 00:30:11.420
emotions uh and these negative emotions might cause some

459
00:30:12.119 --> 00:30:16.109
fear of relationships, uh that might keep people away

460
00:30:16.109 --> 00:30:19.199
for a while, which could be a good thing

461
00:30:19.709 --> 00:30:21.109
because, all right, because like if you think about

462
00:30:21.109 --> 00:30:23.640
it, if I'm If I had like a failure,

463
00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.089
a relationship failure, it's not very wise to rush

464
00:30:26.089 --> 00:30:28.810
into another one. It's, it's maybe take some time

465
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:30.920
to think about it. And this fear of getting

466
00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.250
into a relationship might help me uh uh for

467
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:41.410
a while. Um, um. And now for, and that

468
00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.170
will be probably sex difference. So this is a

469
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:48.140
phenomenon complex doesn't have at least one region um

470
00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:54.609
in certain cases, um. Uh, LIKE, like, now there

471
00:30:54.609 --> 00:30:57.770
is the sex difference. So, uh, uh, men would

472
00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:00.810
tend to prefer a casual sex more than woman,

473
00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:02.609
and if you are in a relationship, obviously this

474
00:31:02.609 --> 00:31:07.160
is not what you can do, um, so it

475
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:12.369
could also be that, uh, uh, men, um, have

476
00:31:12.369 --> 00:31:16.880
this fear of relationship commitment more than woman. Because

477
00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.540
you don't want thes don't want to commit, uh,

478
00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.079
because which allows them, uh, to have, let's say

479
00:31:23.079 --> 00:31:26.359
casual sex with a different partners. I would think

480
00:31:26.359 --> 00:31:31.579
this is kind of life stages. Dependent, so kind

481
00:31:31.579 --> 00:31:33.900
of, uh, so it's kind of when you are

482
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:38.300
younger, probably this is more um you don't want

483
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.609
commitment, you have like a fear of commitment, but

484
00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:46.250
Probably this resides as um as you get older

485
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.369
for both uh uh men and women. Uh, SO

486
00:31:49.369 --> 00:31:51.619
it's just like bottom lines that, you know, people

487
00:31:51.619 --> 00:31:53.250
might don't want to commit to have a fear

488
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.780
of relationship which is like a bit complex. I

489
00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.260
mean they have like it's a complex phenomenon there

490
00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.569
might be many reasons uh for this, but has

491
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.969
also a positive aspect I think that it gives

492
00:32:05.969 --> 00:32:10.650
people some time um away from the mapping market

493
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.530
to better assess what's going on and improve themselves.

494
00:32:14.849 --> 00:32:16.170
So it's not necessarily a bad thing.

495
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:20.469
OK. So I, I think that we've already talked

496
00:32:20.469 --> 00:32:22.819
a little bit about this, but what are some

497
00:32:22.819 --> 00:32:27.300
of the main advantages and disadvantages that people report

498
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:29.069
of being single?

499
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.969
All right, um, OK, so, uh, we ask different

500
00:32:33.969 --> 00:32:38.380
people, um, to, to tell us some advantage and

501
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:43.140
disadvantages, um, so the advantages we discussed before, it's

502
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.699
like I have, uh, freedom, having more freedom to

503
00:32:46.699 --> 00:32:49.420
do what what you want, which makes some sense,

504
00:32:49.469 --> 00:32:53.839
right? So it's kind of, uh, now. Uh, YES,

505
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
like I'm married, I talk to my wife, you

506
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.079
know, just go right, I need some time so

507
00:32:58.079 --> 00:33:01.310
I can just talk with Ricardo, uh, and whatever,

508
00:33:01.599 --> 00:33:03.750
right. If I was single, I wouldn't have to,

509
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.239
to buy the reporting to anyone, right? Um, SO

510
00:33:08.239 --> 00:33:11.310
that's, that's I would say it's like frequently people,

511
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.869
uh, report. Another advantage, uh, they report is that

512
00:33:18.989 --> 00:33:22.719
We said this before, but if in some instances

513
00:33:22.719 --> 00:33:26.560
the relationship could be like uh not go very

514
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:32.160
well, which results in struggles, fights, and negative emotions.

515
00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.630
I will talk about this later, uh. Which can

516
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:39.390
be very nasty or feeling like let's say jealousy

517
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:44.709
or um uh anger uh uh well, when you

518
00:33:44.709 --> 00:33:47.199
are not in a relationship, well, you don't have

519
00:33:47.199 --> 00:33:51.109
to experience these things, right? Um, um, SO this

520
00:33:51.109 --> 00:33:55.630
is kind of an advantage. However, this brings us

521
00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:59.199
to the disadvantages and the main disadvantage is the

522
00:33:59.199 --> 00:34:02.390
opposite of it. It's kind of people would feel

523
00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:09.469
um lonely. Uh, WILL experience negative emotions like emptiness,

524
00:34:09.478 --> 00:34:13.800
sadness, uh, but mainly lonely, so it can have

525
00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:19.260
an emotional, uh, uh, cost. Why has an emotional

526
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.389
cost? This is not just random. It is for

527
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:25.610
the evolutionary reason that is, um, if you would

528
00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:29.020
feel satisfied and happy being single, then you wouldn't

529
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:34.570
bother to get into a relationship, um, uh, so

530
00:34:34.899 --> 00:34:40.909
your, uh, adaptations, your emotional adaptations trigger here, uh,

531
00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:45.579
to punish you. Uh, FOR not, for not doing

532
00:34:45.579 --> 00:34:50.978
something, uh, that promotes, um, uh, your fitness. So

533
00:34:50.978 --> 00:34:55.570
it's kind of They turn your emotional mechanism, turn

534
00:34:55.570 --> 00:35:00.750
singlehood to be. In general, not always, but in

535
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:04.310
general, an unpleasant experience that is a way to

536
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.149
motivate you to get into a relationship where I

537
00:35:07.149 --> 00:35:08.639
say it's lonely. What I mean is like I

538
00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:10.270
said it's a negative emotion that I want to

539
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:13.270
get rid of and which motivates me to find

540
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:16.550
an intimate partner, which is a way to uh

541
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.550
to get rid of it. Um, SO, so in

542
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.120
terms of disadvantages then. Uh, I would say this

543
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:26.320
is the, like, uh, the main one, we got

544
00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.080
here. Plus, of course, we don't have like people

545
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.360
would report that they don't have someone there to

546
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.919
be there for them to, um, uh, to support

547
00:35:33.919 --> 00:35:37.760
them, to discuss their, their problems, um, and this

548
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.850
could be. And an issue because I mean we

549
00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:44.169
are social species, so we just need uh social

550
00:35:44.169 --> 00:35:47.010
input from, from others which discuss our problems with

551
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.659
others and in a contemporary world which tends to

552
00:35:50.659 --> 00:35:56.810
be individualistic, uh, yeah, people sort of um uh

553
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.530
you know, have fewer friends, have to move around,

554
00:35:59.649 --> 00:36:03.689
live on their own, um, uh, which, so we

555
00:36:03.689 --> 00:36:07.969
are facing a problem. Uh, THEY might not have

556
00:36:07.969 --> 00:36:11.649
someone around to talk about it, which makes an

557
00:36:11.649 --> 00:36:15.570
intimate partner even more important than in the past

558
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.610
for this region. I mean, in the past you

559
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:20.489
had like your uh family around, your cousins, your

560
00:36:20.489 --> 00:36:23.889
parents, your whatever. Now you have nobody. You can

561
00:36:23.889 --> 00:36:27.300
have like Your intimate partner and even if you

562
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.790
don't have this one, then things become even worse.

563
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.370
So it's like kind of, you know, being single

564
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.219
is like kind of uh that's what people would

565
00:36:36.219 --> 00:36:39.500
report that's another reason is like not having someone

566
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:44.120
to connect um to discuss their issues, their problems.

567
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.469
Mhm. And are there factors that might play a

568
00:36:48.469 --> 00:36:52.600
role in how people deal with the disadvantages of

569
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.080
singlehood? I mean, are there, for example, contexts that

570
00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:00.719
might lead them to more easily discount the disadvantages?

571
00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:08.219
Well, um, we haven't. Investigate this adequately, but I

572
00:37:08.219 --> 00:37:12.219
would say it depends uh on the situation. So

573
00:37:12.219 --> 00:37:13.899
for instance, if you have like, like kind of

574
00:37:13.899 --> 00:37:15.780
as you were saying like the context, you have

575
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.689
like many friends. Um, THIS to some degree could

576
00:37:19.689 --> 00:37:24.469
balance. It won't perfectly balance it, but it will

577
00:37:24.469 --> 00:37:28.489
balance, let's say being, um, uh, being, uh, being

578
00:37:28.489 --> 00:37:31.409
single, right, so it's kind of, uh, also, let's

579
00:37:31.409 --> 00:37:36.729
say, uh, depending on how important is my work,

580
00:37:36.889 --> 00:37:39.489
right, it's like, uh, it's like my career, um,

581
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:42.250
I like, like people who are career focused I

582
00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:45.649
might not. Take it easier, let's say, than those

583
00:37:45.649 --> 00:37:49.050
who are not. Um, uh, IF you have, let's,

584
00:37:49.129 --> 00:37:51.330
let's say if you live, um, next to your

585
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.530
family would be also important that it's like moving

586
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:56.489
to to another country and be just on your

587
00:37:56.489 --> 00:37:59.330
own. Uh, SO, so the singlehood there would be

588
00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:01.959
like even more painful, uh, I would think. However,

589
00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:08.419
these are. Uh Hypothesis, I don't have. Data I'll

590
00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:09.659
tell you that this is the case, but I

591
00:38:09.659 --> 00:38:12.979
would just suspect that these are factors um uh

592
00:38:12.979 --> 00:38:17.229
that play a role there. Mhm.

593
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:21.199
OK, so I guess that I have just one

594
00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:23.510
last topic I would like to ask you about.

595
00:38:23.959 --> 00:38:27.239
We've talked here about what people report as being

596
00:38:27.239 --> 00:38:31.360
the advantages and disadvantages of being single. And what

597
00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.879
are the specific benefits of being in a relationship?

598
00:38:35.889 --> 00:38:38.110
What do people have to say about that?

599
00:38:38.679 --> 00:38:41.939
All right. Um, SO, so this is the other

600
00:38:42.649 --> 00:38:45.209
side of the coin, right? It's kind of again,

601
00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:52.010
um. Uh, SO people would think that they don't

602
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:56.090
have to feel lonely. They might experience positive emotions,

603
00:38:56.419 --> 00:39:02.899
um, like uh love, uh. Sexual satisfaction also appears

604
00:39:02.899 --> 00:39:07.729
to be um uh an important uh region. Um

605
00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.850
THEY also have uh someone to be there for

606
00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:13.739
them. So it's kind of, it's like that's the

607
00:39:13.739 --> 00:39:15.459
coin, right? It's kind of, if you, if I

608
00:39:15.459 --> 00:39:18.659
ask about the advantages of being in a relationship,

609
00:39:18.699 --> 00:39:20.300
that people say that I don't have to feel

610
00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.379
lonely. uh, THE disadvantage of being single, I have

611
00:39:23.379 --> 00:39:27.929
to feel, I have to experience loneliness. Um, um,

612
00:39:28.209 --> 00:39:33.810
HOWEVER, again, This And also on the case, right,

613
00:39:33.889 --> 00:39:37.969
doesn't mean that all relationships are born equal, right?

614
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:39.860
So it's kind of, you know, it's like a

615
00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.969
from a relationship, you get a lot of support,

616
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:48.929
satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, positive emotions, uh, uh, but this

617
00:39:48.929 --> 00:39:51.330
might not always be the case. It might be

618
00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:54.439
also the opposite one, right? So it's kind of,

619
00:39:54.689 --> 00:39:59.290
there's no guarantees that these are advantages, um, and

620
00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:03.860
another I would say, uh. Probably an underrated one

621
00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:08.989
that we have to uh look into uh further

622
00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:15.199
is that. Very a long term intimate relationship is

623
00:40:15.199 --> 00:40:17.939
kind of uh provides the context to have a

624
00:40:17.939 --> 00:40:21.159
family, to have children, which kind of be like

625
00:40:21.399 --> 00:40:27.989
for most people. It's very rewarding experience. Um, SO,

626
00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:33.189
and we expect this from evolutionary reasoning, um. So

627
00:40:33.189 --> 00:40:37.030
an intimate relationship, it's not always an end in

628
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:40.050
itself. It's usually at least in evolution terms, it's

629
00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:44.909
means to a purpose which is to have and

630
00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:49.139
raise children, which means that, well, this has not

631
00:40:49.139 --> 00:40:52.419
been adequately explored, you see it's kind of um

632
00:40:52.719 --> 00:40:55.370
That I would say it's a major benefit that

633
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:58.570
may not come directly into mind, right? You might

634
00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:01.439
think that OK, I want intimacy, have someone there

635
00:41:01.439 --> 00:41:05.360
for me who have sex or whatever, um, uh,

636
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:09.209
but eventually sort of you need a relationship to

637
00:41:09.209 --> 00:41:13.229
have, uh, uh, children, um, so if I, if,

638
00:41:13.409 --> 00:41:15.570
if, if I take children out of the equation.

639
00:41:16.479 --> 00:41:22.030
Then, um, I cannot really properly. Assess the benefits

640
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:24.909
of a relationship, right, because I would say probably

641
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.669
the main one is, you know, to be able

642
00:41:27.669 --> 00:41:29.469
to have a family and then you get a

643
00:41:29.469 --> 00:41:33.580
lot of rewards. From having a family, from having

644
00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:37.290
children, um, but to get these rewards, you have

645
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:40.330
also to have a relationship, right? So it's kind

646
00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:43.649
of, so these rewards are related to, to this,

647
00:41:43.689 --> 00:41:46.570
it's kind of, you know, I can't just take

648
00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:49.169
children out of the equation and that's something we

649
00:41:49.169 --> 00:41:52.060
currently um investigate.

650
00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:55.270
So uh finally, I would like to ask you

651
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:58.679
because apparently there's been some debate on this topic

652
00:41:58.679 --> 00:42:03.350
recently. In terms of emotional well-being, is it better

653
00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:06.659
to be single or in a relationship?

654
00:42:07.229 --> 00:42:10.389
OK. Uh, SO for, uh, for your audience, you

655
00:42:10.389 --> 00:42:13.580
might have like if you search online, maybe you,

656
00:42:13.709 --> 00:42:15.879
you had the experience of it. I mean there

657
00:42:15.879 --> 00:42:19.629
is some recent argument saying that, you know, singlehood

658
00:42:19.629 --> 00:42:23.280
is better than. Uh, THAN being in an intimate,

659
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.719
uh, relationship. I mean, as we discussed this before,

660
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.639
I mean you have time to do whatever you

661
00:42:27.639 --> 00:42:31.459
want, um, you can just kind of, uh, develop

662
00:42:31.459 --> 00:42:34.469
yourself, uh, uh, do things and it's kind of,

663
00:42:34.959 --> 00:42:41.439
uh, why bother being in a relationship. Uh, I

664
00:42:41.439 --> 00:42:43.739
would say a lot of these arguments are sort

665
00:42:43.739 --> 00:42:49.300
of misleading, um, because they, um, they lack a

666
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:53.780
theoretical and empirical basis, uh, and if we follow

667
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:58.540
the theory. Uh, AS we discussed before, uh, if

668
00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.739
you choose to be single, your emotional mechanism will

669
00:43:01.739 --> 00:43:03.179
punish you for this. I mean, they will just

670
00:43:03.179 --> 00:43:06.699
have to, they will motivate you, uh, to get

671
00:43:06.699 --> 00:43:10.370
into one, right, because like it's not fitness, um,

672
00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:14.780
uh, reason to be single. So this makes a

673
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:18.830
prediction that made people would be happier uh or

674
00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:22.530
enjoy more positive emotions and fewer negative emotions, uh,

675
00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:27.510
uh, than people who are single. So We did

676
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:29.820
the research to investigate if this is the case,

677
00:43:30.229 --> 00:43:33.469
um, and that's what we found and this was

678
00:43:33.469 --> 00:43:41.010
a cross-cultural uh uh phenomenon that is a cross-cultures

679
00:43:41.469 --> 00:43:45.629
or in general. Uh, NAKED people that's if you

680
00:43:45.629 --> 00:43:49.179
are married or in a relationship, uh, scored higher

681
00:43:49.389 --> 00:43:53.379
in terms of happiness, uh, um, and of positive

682
00:43:53.379 --> 00:43:58.310
emotions, uh, than, and experienced fewer negative emotions than

683
00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:02.969
people who Uh, uh, uh, who are single. Although

684
00:44:02.969 --> 00:44:07.399
the difference was small, so the advantage was small,

685
00:44:07.689 --> 00:44:12.169
uh, although for certain emotions like loneliness, the difference

686
00:44:12.169 --> 00:44:14.969
was considerable, right, so it's kind of you are

687
00:44:14.969 --> 00:44:19.449
single, you experience more, um, loneliness, considering, you are

688
00:44:19.449 --> 00:44:21.530
considered more lonely than if you are in a

689
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:30.949
relationship. Um, NOW. However, this argument. Uh, DOES not

690
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.760
consider the quality of the relationship because as we

691
00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.899
discussed before, some relationships are not fitness increasing. We

692
00:44:37.899 --> 00:44:41.679
expect them emotions to play a role here. So

693
00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:45.000
if your relationship is not fitness increasing, negative emotions

694
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.250
would trigger, um, that would make people take corrective

695
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:54.520
action, one thing and the relationship and find one

696
00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.040
that's uh fitness increasing, or at least more fitness

697
00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.500
increasing that would predict then. That it doesn't really

698
00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.379
matter. It matters if you are in a relationship

699
00:45:03.379 --> 00:45:05.110
or not, but it matters also in what kind

700
00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:08.139
of a relationship you are. So we extend our

701
00:45:08.139 --> 00:45:12.100
argument and we, we sort of measure uh relationship

702
00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.939
quality and we divide people into those who are

703
00:45:15.939 --> 00:45:18.500
uh in a good relationship, in a moderate quality

704
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:22.120
relationship in a, in a bad relationship. And we

705
00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:26.350
compare these groups with singlehood. And I think this

706
00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:31.139
was like um a very interesting study. Uh, BECAUSE

707
00:45:31.189 --> 00:45:34.739
putting everything together and also in a cross-cultural perspective,

708
00:45:35.229 --> 00:45:39.510
we found the champion of positive emotions of, uh,

709
00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:43.060
um, and that was people in a good relationship.

710
00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.189
So in a good quality relationship, these were the

711
00:45:46.189 --> 00:45:50.110
champions, the, the, the experience, um, uh, the most

712
00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:54.699
positive emotions, the highest life satisfaction, uh, and, uh,

713
00:45:54.709 --> 00:46:00.610
the fewest uh negative emotions. Um. The second in

714
00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:06.719
the hierarchy where people are in a moderate quality

715
00:46:06.719 --> 00:46:12.149
uh relationship, um. At the bottom of the hierarchy

716
00:46:12.379 --> 00:46:16.129
were people in a poor quality relationship. So you

717
00:46:16.129 --> 00:46:17.790
see how important this is like it's kind of

718
00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:22.379
um uh and so bottom was like the champions

719
00:46:22.379 --> 00:46:25.620
of negative emotions uh where uh people in a

720
00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:29.500
poor quality relationship and then very closely followed that

721
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:34.820
those who are involuntarily single. Um, SO, and what

722
00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:38.780
like then what people between, um, uh, relationships and

723
00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.620
uh voluntaryrily singles. So I mean if you see

724
00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:44.620
the hierarchy then it's kind as we expect from

725
00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:51.129
evolutionary reasoning, um. The champions of positive emotions are

726
00:46:51.129 --> 00:46:53.389
people in a good relationship and the champions of

727
00:46:53.389 --> 00:46:55.500
uh of bad emotions are people in a bad

728
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.800
relationship followed closely by uh those who are involuntarily

729
00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.090
single. Which has like kind of, it's important for

730
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:07.330
this debate and that. Well, in general, you are

731
00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:10.850
better off in a relationship, but you have to

732
00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:14.399
be very careful what this relationship is. So I

733
00:47:14.399 --> 00:47:17.229
mean in practical terms, I mean for your audience,

734
00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:21.250
people shouldn't just strive to get into uh any

735
00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.649
relationship, but if they manage to get into a

736
00:47:23.649 --> 00:47:26.689
good one, that will make a big difference, which

737
00:47:26.689 --> 00:47:30.090
is a kind of way saying that for singlehood

738
00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:33.010
is good for some time because to find the

739
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:36.600
proper one. You have to develop your strengths, you

740
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:40.699
have to wait. All right, good things come to

741
00:47:40.699 --> 00:47:42.719
those who wait. You know, have to, you have

742
00:47:42.719 --> 00:47:44.439
to wait a bit. It's kind of, you know,

743
00:47:44.479 --> 00:47:46.919
you shouldn't be near us because if you are

744
00:47:46.919 --> 00:47:49.399
near us, uh, you make a wrong choice and

745
00:47:49.399 --> 00:47:50.989
then you get into a bad relationship, you know,

746
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.760
you are worse off than single. So this is

747
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.040
kind of this, this, this kind of research has

748
00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:01.949
practical um uh um uh applications. I mean, but

749
00:48:01.949 --> 00:48:04.199
that's what I mean psychologists shouldn't be also just

750
00:48:04.199 --> 00:48:08.699
theory, um, uh, so bottom line, it's, it's. I,

751
00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:13.870
as we expect. Single who has an impact on

752
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:19.489
emotional well-being or how uh well you feel uh

753
00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:22.780
uh but also the quality of the relationship is

754
00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:26.699
important or even more important uh than this. OK.

755
00:48:27.639 --> 00:48:30.510
OK, so basically, the simple answer to the question

756
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:33.530
is that a good relationship is better than being

757
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:36.239
single, but being single is better than being in

758
00:48:36.239 --> 00:48:37.979
a bad relationship,

759
00:48:38.199 --> 00:48:41.000
right? I would say this, I would say, I

760
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.919
would say so. So people, but I would say

761
00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:45.750
it's kind of, you shouldn't. Going to like a

762
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:48.750
Hollywood kind of uh approach, you know, it's like

763
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:52.149
seeing the perfect relationship or whatever because even moderate

764
00:48:52.149 --> 00:48:55.629
quality relationship uh is the next in the hierarchy,

765
00:48:55.709 --> 00:48:58.260
so it's kind of I would say people should

766
00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:01.149
strive to get like into a good or a

767
00:49:01.149 --> 00:49:03.870
decent relationship, uh, let's say because there are no

768
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:05.469
perfect relationships by the end of the day, right?

769
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:08.550
It's kind of, uh, uh, uh, unless you watch

770
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.629
a lot of movies, there's like kind of there

771
00:49:10.629 --> 00:49:12.989
are no perfect relationship, all right.

772
00:49:13.969 --> 00:49:16.909
OK, great. So would you like to tell them

773
00:49:16.909 --> 00:49:19.959
people where they can find your work on the

774
00:49:19.959 --> 00:49:20.879
internet? Right,

775
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.520
so I just upload my papers um online on

776
00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:31.909
my website Manillashapostolo.com or Resgate, um, so they can.

777
00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.600
Uh, HAVE a look there. So it's kind of

778
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:40.520
like, um, uh, upload papers there if um someone

779
00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:43.040
is interested in a paper that, uh, they face

780
00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.389
a difficulty accessing, they can just even email me.

781
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.479
I will be happy to, uh, to send them

782
00:49:49.479 --> 00:49:50.040
