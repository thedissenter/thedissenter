00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:02.960
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.840
Center. Today, I'm joined by Doctor Brianna Pobiner. She

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.560
is a paleoanthropologist and educator at the Smithsonian National

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.680
Museum of Natural History in the US. Her research

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.680
centers on the evolution of human diet, and today

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.495
we're talking most. ABOUT that, but we'll also get

7
00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:25.264
into the diet of some other closely related species

8
00:00:25.264 --> 00:00:28.264
like chimpanzees and toward the end, we're going to

9
00:00:28.264 --> 00:00:30.784
talk a little bit about some of the bigger

10
00:00:30.784 --> 00:00:35.025
challenges of teaching human evolution. So, Doctor Poiner, welcome

11
00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:36.784
to the show. It's a huge pleasure to have

12
00:00:36.784 --> 00:00:37.185
you on.

13
00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:39.025
Oh, thank you for inviting me.

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.540
OK, so before we get into our diet and

15
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.930
chimpanzee diet and the diet of possibly other ominents,

16
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.779
let me just ask you, uh, how can we

17
00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:55.580
study the diet of species from the past, species

18
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.779
who are already extinct? What are perhaps some of

19
00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:01.490
the main tools that we have at our disposal

20
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.129
and then the kinds of sources we can draw

21
00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:06.250
evidence from.

22
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.110
Yeah, so there's a, the, the cool thing in

23
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.110
my thinking about studying diets is there's a lot

24
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.169
of different lines of evidence. So you can have,

25
00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:20.300
uh, what archaeologists often study is almost the trash

26
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.470
and things that are kind of left over after

27
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.739
humans, modern humans and their ancient relatives and cousins

28
00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:29.389
ate things. So that could be tools, that could

29
00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:34.000
be animal, fossil bones, um, that could be leftovers

30
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.900
of plant debris, even pieces of insects, things like

31
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.680
that. So it can be like, Parts of the

32
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.720
food and things that were left, the tools that

33
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.940
were used to, you know, process the food or

34
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.519
catch the food. Um, BUT it can also be

35
00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:49.599
things like actually the chemistry of fossil bones and

36
00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:51.839
teeth that can tell us a little bit about

37
00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:54.889
maybe what kinds of plants were, um, being eaten

38
00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:57.239
by early humans or, you know, other kinds of

39
00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:00.839
animals. Um, AND, um, you can even look at

40
00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:03.610
the more the basic size and shape of things

41
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.400
like our teeth and jaws to get a sense

42
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.330
of adaptation. So there's, there's a variety of different

43
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.279
kinds of evidence.

44
00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.529
When it comes to studying the evolution of human

45
00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:17.130
diet, what are some of the best animal models

46
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.000
we can study and draw information from? I mean,

47
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.929
what are the kinds of animals we can better

48
00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:24.520
compare ourselves to?

49
00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:27.220
Yeah, so most of the time people use other

50
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.320
primates. So primates, we are primates. That's how we

51
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.539
fit into the tree of life. So our closest

52
00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:37.380
living relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos, not our ancestors,

53
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.770
but basically cousins. And so we shared a common

54
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.699
ancestor with chimpanzees maybe 6 or 7 million years

55
00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:47.490
ago. So they're potentially a good model. Other great

56
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.860
apes, so humans, chimps, gorillas, orangutans, or other great

57
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.039
apes, but even some other primates like baboon. WHO

58
00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:57.800
live today in environments that we think were similar

59
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.559
to those that our ancestors evolved in. So yeah,

60
00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.000
primates, I think, are generally the best models. Sometimes

61
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.309
when we think about meat eating, we can look

62
00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:10.880
at other carnivores and predators. We can also look

63
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.240
at other omnivorous species because we are omnivores and

64
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.399
really always have been. So but from kind of

65
00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:21.000
a phylogenetic, like an evolutionary perspectives, primates usually make

66
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.960
the best models.

67
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.559
Oh, you said that you were, that we are

68
00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.679
omnivores and have always been, that's already a controversial

69
00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:32.080
statement to make nowadays because there are people who

70
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.710
make some. Uh, VERY interesting claims about the human

71
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.029
diet. We're going to get into some of those

72
00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:43.229
claims later on. But, uh, so, you mentioned the

73
00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:47.880
primates, you also mentioned primarily chimpanzees and bonobos. So

74
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.639
about chimpanzees, what do we know about their diet?

75
00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:55.830
And in what extent can we draw information from

76
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.270
them and their behavior and compare to the omin?

77
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.389
So I think, you know, using both chimpanzees and

78
00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.729
bonobos are good models. Like I said, they're our

79
00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:08.529
closest living relatives. Um, THEY live in the parts

80
00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:11.850
of Africa where, or the, you know, environments that

81
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.169
are probably similar to that when, when early humans

82
00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.579
evolved, um. And chimpanzees have a pretty flexible diet,

83
00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:24.618
but they are mostly plant eaters, fruits, feeds, different,

84
00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.148
you know, different kinds of different parts of plants,

85
00:04:27.498 --> 00:04:29.938
but they also eat insects. They also eat some

86
00:04:29.938 --> 00:04:34.579
meat. So on average, chimpanzee groups, about 3% of

87
00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:37.378
their diet comes from meat from smaller animals, much

88
00:04:37.378 --> 00:04:40.670
smaller than themselves. So I think we can look

89
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.390
at both the components of diet, but also kind

90
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.019
of behavior. Chimpanzees use tools sometimes to actually get

91
00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:51.390
their food, and we can look at things like

92
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.459
when they are searching for food and when they

93
00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:58.570
are accessing food when they're eating food, hunting. SMALLER

94
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.059
primates so we can use both sort of behavior

95
00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:03.700
models but also even models of like what does

96
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.700
it look like when chimpanzees eat food? What kind

97
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.420
of marks does it leave on their teeth? Are

98
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.859
those good models for what we might find in

99
00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:13.179
early human ancestors and what how the traces of

100
00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:15.739
diets might have, you know, made print imprints on

101
00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:16.899
their teeth, for example.

102
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.709
So let me ask you this because earlier you

103
00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:23.859
also mentioned baboons and other primates. So what are

104
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.670
the main criteria criteria you use to determine that

105
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.040
we can learn something about the evolution of our

106
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.144
own diet by studying another. Is it uh that

107
00:05:36.144 --> 00:05:39.584
they lived in in a similar environment and so

108
00:05:39.584 --> 00:05:42.565
they could have had access to similar sorts of

109
00:05:42.565 --> 00:05:45.024
food? Does it have anything to do with their

110
00:05:45.024 --> 00:05:49.225
dentition or their digestive tract? What are perhaps some

111
00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:51.774
of the criteria that you use?

112
00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:54.630
So I would say all of those as well

113
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.390
as their evolutionary relationship to us. So primates that

114
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.950
are very, you know, sort of distantly related to

115
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.570
us might not be as good models, maybe they

116
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.190
have kind of more frugivorous like they're fruit eaters

117
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.910
or they're folivorres. They're really focused on leaves, so

118
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.630
they might not be the best models, but I

119
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.630
think habitats that they live in, what their social

120
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.779
structures are like, how they actually get their food,

121
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.980
what their tooth morphology and skull morphology is like,

122
00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:21.709
digestive tracts, and so all of those really.

123
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.380
Mhm. Yeah, the bit about sociality is very interesting

124
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.100
because, I mean, I, I would imagine that many

125
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.500
people wouldn't think about learning about the sociality of

126
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.899
a particular species to then infer some things about,

127
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.619
uh, what they ate. Because in the case of

128
00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:44.200
humans, for example, since we are so cooperative, I

129
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.760
mean, that's a potential source of evidence to then

130
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.600
determine that we also uh hunted large prey, right?

131
00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:56.359
Exactly. So I do think that's exactly where kind

132
00:06:56.359 --> 00:07:00.320
of social behavior comes into play and thinking about

133
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.720
how food is, you know, gathered and hunted and

134
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.559
things like that. So I think exactly.

135
00:07:05.829 --> 00:07:08.380
And so in your own work, and now I'm

136
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.350
focusing just on hominids. Now how far back in,

137
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.690
in our revolutionary history do you go, I mean,

138
00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:19.540
what species do you study the most? Mhm.

139
00:07:19.859 --> 00:07:23.570
So I, because I'm interested mainly in the origin

140
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.369
and evolution of meat eating, we have the earliest

141
00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:29.040
evidence, solid evidence for that going back almost 3

142
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.130
million years, maybe a little bit earlier. I've tended

143
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.049
to focus on between about 2 million, 1 million

144
00:07:35.049 --> 00:07:37.299
years ago, sometimes a little bit older or later.

145
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.029
But really in the realm mostly of a species

146
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:44.309
called Homo erectus, which is probably sort of our

147
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:49.049
grandparent ancestor. So Homo erectus likely evolved into another

148
00:07:49.049 --> 00:07:52.750
species called Homo Heidelbergensis in Africa, and they probably

149
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:57.269
evolved into Homo sapiens. So, but Homo erectus was

150
00:07:57.269 --> 00:08:00.619
the longest lived hominin on the human family tree.

151
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.109
The first one that we have good evidence migrated

152
00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.179
out of Africa to different parts of the world,

153
00:08:06.429 --> 00:08:08.350
and really the first one that we start to

154
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.640
see an uptick in, including meat in the diet.

155
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.790
So for that reason, I think that's kind of

156
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.869
the species in the time period that I'm most

157
00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:16.390
interested in.

158
00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:19.600
Yeah, so you said that it is in Homo

159
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.760
erectus that we see an uptake in in eating

160
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.679
meat, but so before or previous to Homo erectus,

161
00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:33.229
Homo erectus, there were already other species eating meat

162
00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:33.520
or

163
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.919
not. Yeah, so it's, it's very likely. Homo erectus

164
00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.510
evolved about 2 million years ago, a little bit

165
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.640
less, and we have good evidence for at least

166
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.239
like episodic meat eating in the zooarchaeological record and

167
00:08:48.239 --> 00:08:50.950
the record of fossil animal bones going back to

168
00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:56.280
at least 2.5, 2.6, 2.9, maybe 3.4 million years

169
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.440
ago. So species earlier than Homo erectus ate meat

170
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.409
and so the form of that evidence. IS in

171
00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:06.010
butchered animal bones, but if we look at chimpanzees

172
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.489
like we talked about, it's very like so chimpanzees

173
00:09:08.489 --> 00:09:12.010
eat meat from smaller animals. They don't tend to

174
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.099
use tools to butcher those animals to eat meat.

175
00:09:15.369 --> 00:09:19.679
So my thinking is probably really from the earliest

176
00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:23.440
hominins that there probably was a small component of

177
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.010
meat eating. It just may not be archaeologically visible.

178
00:09:27.619 --> 00:09:31.929
Mhm. And when you mentioned meat, uh, are insects

179
00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:33.369
part of it or

180
00:09:33.369 --> 00:09:35.809
not? That's a good question. I don't think of

181
00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:38.130
insects as part of meat eating. It's certainly they're

182
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.650
a good source of protein, um, but I would,

183
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.130
I think of them in a different category. And

184
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.570
the other thing I should say is I tend

185
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.969
to say meat, but what I'm really talking about

186
00:09:46.969 --> 00:09:50.049
is anything from an animal. So it's also very

187
00:09:50.049 --> 00:09:53.880
likely that some of the earliest, um, Animal tissue

188
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.880
eating was not just focused on meat but it

189
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.000
was focused on marrow inside of bones, great source

190
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.270
of fat and calories,

191
00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:04.039
and maybe eggs from certain species or not.

192
00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:07.880
Absolutely. So eggs, I think, you know, and, and

193
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.440
probably a lot of smaller species that we might

194
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.080
find there remains an archaeological site lizards, birds, things

195
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.159
that you don't actually need tools to maybe catch.

196
00:10:18.244 --> 00:10:21.065
Take apart and so, and maybe we will, you

197
00:10:21.065 --> 00:10:25.015
know, I think that the studies of what human

198
00:10:25.015 --> 00:10:27.825
or hominid tooth marks look like on bones is

199
00:10:27.825 --> 00:10:30.585
still, I would say maybe up and coming. So

200
00:10:30.585 --> 00:10:32.294
I think there are still ways that we might

201
00:10:32.294 --> 00:10:34.765
be able to recognize some of this that we

202
00:10:34.765 --> 00:10:35.815
don't have now.

203
00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:40.030
And so what were some of the biggest changes

204
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.700
that occurred when Homo erectus comes into the picture

205
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.950
when it comes to our consumption of meat?

206
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.719
So interestingly, there's been a narrative for a long

207
00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:53.679
time that Homo erectus evolves. You get a much

208
00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:56.840
more modern human-like body size and shape, kind of

209
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.640
taller, leaner, and then about a million years ago

210
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.039
you get this big increase in brain size, and

211
00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:06.669
there's been an idea that Homo erectus comes along,

212
00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.784
probably ventured a lot more. Widely across the landscape

213
00:11:11.474 --> 00:11:15.195
we do see evidence for meat eating in some

214
00:11:15.195 --> 00:11:17.875
ways intensifying at the time of Homo erectus, although

215
00:11:17.875 --> 00:11:21.515
some research I did with colleagues showed that that

216
00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:23.354
seems to be kind of in pulses and not

217
00:11:23.354 --> 00:11:26.674
so much a sustained increase in carnivory, and that

218
00:11:26.674 --> 00:11:28.755
may just be because of the archaeological sites that

219
00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:32.630
we've been focusing on. Um, AND so we do

220
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.950
see changes in adaptations in Homo erectus, um, but

221
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.679
we see the earliest meat eating much earlier than

222
00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:43.030
that. Um, SO we, again, we see it sort

223
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.179
of episodic here and there in the archaeological record.

224
00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.830
It tends to be what we do see around

225
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.390
the time of Homo erectus though, interestingly, of the

226
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.979
evolution of Homo erectus, there's a In Kenya called

227
00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:58.070
Kanjara South, and it's dated to about 2 million

228
00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.869
years ago, and those 2 million year layers have

229
00:12:00.869 --> 00:12:06.309
multiple layers of butchered animal bones where probably Homo

230
00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.909
erectus was going back over and over again to

231
00:12:08.909 --> 00:12:11.900
butcher animals. So it's not just one animal here,

232
00:12:11.989 --> 00:12:13.989
a couple animals there. It's this is a spot

233
00:12:13.989 --> 00:12:15.750
where we come to do this. So I I

234
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.950
think that is a shift that looks interesting that

235
00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.059
is right now coincident with the evolution of Homo

236
00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:21.780
erectus.

237
00:12:22.219 --> 00:12:24.719
So I'm not sure if this question makes sense,

238
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.789
but one of the things I associate with Homo

239
00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:32.030
erectus is the use of fire and cooking. So

240
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.429
did that influence in any way the fact that

241
00:12:35.429 --> 00:12:39.070
Homo erectus have an uptick in the. OF meat.

242
00:12:39.109 --> 00:12:43.070
I mean, because when we cook things, it's easier

243
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.510
for us to digest them, right, including meat. So

244
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.190
did that have any influence there or not?

245
00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:51.390
So that's a good question, and I would say

246
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.710
the jury is still out on that. So it's

247
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.590
an interesting idea. We don't have really solid evidence

248
00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.580
for a lot of cooking with Homo erectus early

249
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.960
on. Um, WE do see, I would say, more

250
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.919
sustained evidence for cooking maybe by half a million

251
00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:12.359
years ago. So I think it's also pretty difficult

252
00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:14.830
to detect in the archaeological record in a way

253
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.599
that is convincing and not just this could be

254
00:13:17.599 --> 00:13:19.950
a, you know, natural brush fire or something like

255
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.760
that. So I think maybe, but I would say

256
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.869
we don't have the evidence to make that solid

257
00:13:24.869 --> 00:13:25.909
tie right now.

258
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:30.390
OK, and in regards to hominids, I mean, I

259
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.710
think you've already mentioned some of that, but what

260
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:37.109
are the main sources of evidence that point to

261
00:13:37.109 --> 00:13:41.669
a particular hominin having eaten meat? Uh, HOW do

262
00:13:41.669 --> 00:13:42.179
we?

263
00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:45.380
This is a really tricky question because unless we

264
00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.739
find a hominin sort of with a tool in

265
00:13:47.739 --> 00:13:51.500
its skeletal hand butchering an animal, most of the

266
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.960
time we don't actually know which hominin was butchering

267
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.729
particular animals. So we can look at what's the

268
00:13:58.729 --> 00:14:01.380
time horizon, what hominins were around in this time

269
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.340
and place and make a potential link. We can

270
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:10.596
look at. The tooth morphology, jaw morphology, other adaptations

271
00:14:10.596 --> 00:14:12.515
like the size of the gut, and so that

272
00:14:12.515 --> 00:14:15.265
went from a more chimpanzee sort of, you know,

273
00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:17.875
wider gut to narrower and Homo erectus, so we

274
00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:20.716
can make some inferences, but I think it's actually

275
00:14:20.716 --> 00:14:24.716
really tough to tie specific hominin species until we

276
00:14:24.716 --> 00:14:27.676
get to species like Neanderthals when they were the

277
00:14:27.676 --> 00:14:30.892
only hominins around in. Places in Europe and Western

278
00:14:30.892 --> 00:14:33.742
Asia at certain time periods and they were definitely

279
00:14:33.742 --> 00:14:36.611
the ones hunting and butchering animals. But I think

280
00:14:36.611 --> 00:14:40.211
where we have Homo erectus, Paranthropus boisei, maybe Homo

281
00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:44.052
habilis, other species that were coexisting, it's hard to

282
00:14:44.052 --> 00:14:46.242
say which one was actually doing the meat eating,

283
00:14:46.372 --> 00:14:49.091
although we have tended to assume that it was

284
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:52.132
members of the genus Homo like Homo erectus and

285
00:14:52.132 --> 00:14:53.012
Homo habilis.

286
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.500
And so can we also look at the cranium

287
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.140
as a source of evidence in the sense that

288
00:15:00.469 --> 00:15:03.619
perhaps there would be a link between meat consumption

289
00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:05.020
and brain size

290
00:15:05.219 --> 00:15:08.390
or not? So potentially, so this was that was

291
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.669
part of that narrative I mentioned before, an idea

292
00:15:10.669 --> 00:15:14.270
called the expensive tissue hypothesis. So our brain tissue

293
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:18.030
is very energetically expensive. It sort of costs a

294
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:22.000
lot of. TO maintain big brains and the other

295
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.969
really energetically expensive tissues in our bodies are our

296
00:15:24.969 --> 00:15:27.880
guts. And so with the evolution of Homo erectus

297
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.919
we see smaller guts, probably less gut tissue, and

298
00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:35.030
we start to see increases in brain size. We'd

299
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.119
see a really big, a much bigger increase in

300
00:15:38.119 --> 00:15:40.640
brain size relative to body size at about a

301
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.690
million years ago. So sort of the brain. BODY

302
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.000
size, you know, evolves larger in tandem until then.

303
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:51.010
So maybe, I mean, I think meat has been

304
00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:54.429
put forth as a source of the release on

305
00:15:54.429 --> 00:15:57.359
the constraint of the evolution of bigger brain size,

306
00:15:57.409 --> 00:16:01.010
but maybe it's not meat, maybe it's cooked, not

307
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.929
just meat, but maybe it's cooked meat, maybe it's

308
00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:06.619
other things, maybe so, but it's, it's definitely an

309
00:16:06.619 --> 00:16:07.690
interesting idea.

310
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.739
So one of the things that you mentioned earlier,

311
00:16:10.809 --> 00:16:14.530
we can look into our marks on bones, right,

312
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:19.479
cutting marks. So, uh, but how do we know

313
00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.650
or is it even possible for us to know

314
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:26.130
for sure that particular marks were done intentionally to

315
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.330
consume the meat?

316
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.679
Yeah, it's a good question. And when I have

317
00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:31.520
to ask myself a lot because this is a

318
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.440
core part of what I study. A lot of

319
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.719
what I do is look at fossils, observe marks

320
00:16:36.719 --> 00:16:38.280
on them, and try to figure out where these

321
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.760
marks left by ancient stone knives, were they left

322
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.159
by carnivore teeth? Were they left by the bone

323
00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:45.530
rolling around in a river and getting rubbed with

324
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:50.719
sand. Um, SO basically experimental archaeology is a very

325
00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:53.159
big help in this where we can do butchery

326
00:16:53.159 --> 00:16:57.359
experiments, look at carnivores, you know, eating their prey

327
00:16:57.359 --> 00:16:59.919
and see what the basically the size and shape

328
00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:03.359
and pattern of those marks look like. There there

329
00:17:03.359 --> 00:17:06.199
are good studies that show that you can differentiate

330
00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:10.719
between marks left by butchery tools, carnivore teeth, crocodile

331
00:17:10.719 --> 00:17:14.358
teeth, and like sedimentary abrasion, many of them, but

332
00:17:14.358 --> 00:17:16.750
not all of them. So again, it's kind of

333
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.510
the size, shape, the pattern, also where on the

334
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.430
bone the marks are. Are they in a place

335
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.790
where there's a muscle attachment, a place where two

336
00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.949
bones join together where people might have been trying

337
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:29.349
to take apart or disarticulate the bones? Um, YEAH.

338
00:17:29.989 --> 00:17:32.380
And so this is why it's so important for

339
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.939
us to draw from as many different sources of

340
00:17:35.939 --> 00:17:39.400
evidence as we can because the marks just by

341
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.900
themselves would, would probably not tell us or give

342
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.660
us enough information about our diet or our eating

343
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:47.650
meat in this case.

344
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.770
I mean, I think if you, you know, if,

345
00:17:49.859 --> 00:17:52.979
if you find marks that are very clearly butchery

346
00:17:52.979 --> 00:17:55.750
marks, you can say hominins were eating meat or

347
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.859
at least cutting off meat from these animals. So

348
00:17:57.859 --> 00:18:00.420
I think that, you know, you can. That solid

349
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.310
tie, but I think, you know, again, we've had

350
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.989
great, you know, research teams who have done excellent

351
00:18:07.989 --> 00:18:10.510
studies to be able to differentiate what marks are

352
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.349
what. Most of the time, some of them are

353
00:18:12.349 --> 00:18:13.579
very ambiguous though.

354
00:18:13.829 --> 00:18:18.189
And so after Homo erectus and between Homo erectus

355
00:18:18.189 --> 00:18:21.430
and Homo sapiens, I mean the species that like

356
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:25.420
Homo idolbergensis, what do we know about their diet?

357
00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.229
Did anything, anything major change or not?

358
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.699
Yeah, good question. So we have some of it

359
00:18:32.699 --> 00:18:36.060
is that again the evidence for what hominins were

360
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.459
eating is not always coupled with the evidence for

361
00:18:38.459 --> 00:18:43.060
what hominin was actually doing that eating. So sometimes

362
00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.020
it's, I think about it as more broad like

363
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.859
hominin diets overall, but we do see things like

364
00:18:48.859 --> 00:18:52.060
even with Homo erectus, we see by about a

365
00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.619
little less than 2 million years ago, not just

366
00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:57.859
consuming meat from terrestrial animals but also from aquatic

367
00:18:57.859 --> 00:19:02.900
animals. See, you know, the earliest evidence of really

368
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.939
roasting and eating fish, a paper that came out

369
00:19:04.939 --> 00:19:06.380
a couple of years ago at a site in

370
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.339
Israel by about 800,000 years ago. We start to

371
00:19:10.339 --> 00:19:13.780
see slowly a little bit more choice in what

372
00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:18.099
animals were being hunted. Larger animals, the kind of

373
00:19:18.099 --> 00:19:20.579
prime age adult animals we see. I think it

374
00:19:20.579 --> 00:19:24.020
was probably with Homo er sorry, with Homo Heidelbergensis

375
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.930
and then with Neanderthals where there's, there's more selectivity

376
00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.300
and I think hunting is probably becoming more common

377
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.939
and more more practiced. So as opposed to probably

378
00:19:36.939 --> 00:19:39.859
doing more scavenging, at least of bigger animals earlier

379
00:19:39.859 --> 00:19:40.180
on.

380
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.810
So now to get into a topic that I

381
00:19:43.829 --> 00:19:48.069
I alluded to earlier in our conversation, sometimes we

382
00:19:48.069 --> 00:19:53.109
hear about a supposed paleo diet, but is there

383
00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:55.540
really a paleo diet?

384
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.589
My short answer is I don't think so, but

385
00:19:59.589 --> 00:20:03.709
the caveat is that there, there probably were specific

386
00:20:03.709 --> 00:20:06.989
diets at certain places and certain times that by

387
00:20:06.989 --> 00:20:09.989
certain species, but I think human diets are so

388
00:20:09.989 --> 00:20:14.390
flexible today and very culturally mediated. But the idea

389
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.550
that there was a single paleo diet like ancient

390
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.109
people ate lots of meat or ancient people ate

391
00:20:20.109 --> 00:20:23.310
mostly plants, I think is really an oversimplification.

392
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.719
And we can also look into contemporary traditional societies

393
00:20:28.719 --> 00:20:33.119
as potential proxies for uh the kinds of more

394
00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:35.920
ancient societies we lived in, right? And the way

395
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.630
they and the kinds of foods that they eat.

396
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.239
Absolutely. And so I think there have been great

397
00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:44.729
ethnographic studies of people that live in polar areas

398
00:20:44.729 --> 00:20:46.410
and what kinds of foods that they eat and

399
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.890
what adaptations those have even led to people in

400
00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.079
tropical areas. And so that's the other thing is

401
00:20:52.079 --> 00:20:54.410
that you know there's such a great diversity in

402
00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:58.640
modern human contemporary diets, historic diets that, but I

403
00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.255
do think There is a wealth of evidence in

404
00:21:00.255 --> 00:21:03.015
there that we can use as models for ancient

405
00:21:03.015 --> 00:21:03.734
diets.

406
00:21:04.645 --> 00:21:08.694
One thing that I've heard many anthropologists saying is

407
00:21:08.694 --> 00:21:13.295
that basically when we look across the when we

408
00:21:13.295 --> 00:21:17.175
look into diets across the world in human societies

409
00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:20.310
and even what we know from Uh, the diets

410
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:25.270
of ancient societies is that basically people ate what

411
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.430
they have available in the specific place they lived.

412
00:21:28.469 --> 00:21:30.979
So there, there's even the example of, I think

413
00:21:30.979 --> 00:21:33.790
the, the as the or the, the bushmen in

414
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.829
Africa who uh ate at for, uh, I mean,

415
00:21:37.989 --> 00:21:40.270
for a period of months in the year, they

416
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.469
ate mostly honey or something like that.

417
00:21:43.609 --> 00:21:47.140
Absolutely. No. And so I think eating what's local,

418
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.010
if there is a paleo diet, maybe it's really

419
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.130
eating what's locally available, and that's going to change

420
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.560
throughout the year. That's going to depend on where

421
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.689
you live. So sometimes people will ask me because

422
00:21:58.689 --> 00:22:00.530
I study the paleo diet, like, do you eat

423
00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.329
the paleo diet? And I say, yeah, I eat

424
00:22:02.329 --> 00:22:05.170
whatever I find in the supermarket and maybe what

425
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.969
my husband cooks for me. So I, yeah, exactly.

426
00:22:08.459 --> 00:22:11.170
Yeah, because you, you know, many times we hear

427
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:16.040
these grandiose claims about human diet. Like, for example,

428
00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.599
there are the carnivore people who claim that we

429
00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:24.250
evolved eating just only meat, then sometimes we hear

430
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.530
from vegans that we are not omnivorous at all,

431
00:22:27.609 --> 00:22:31.250
that we ate just plants and carbs and stuff

432
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:35.095
like that. But, but these kinds of claims do

433
00:22:35.095 --> 00:22:37.505
not make much sense, right?

434
00:22:37.875 --> 00:22:41.515
No, I don't think that the extreme diet claims

435
00:22:41.515 --> 00:22:44.306
are really grounded in good evidence from the past.

436
00:22:44.995 --> 00:22:47.475
I think that, you know, people can have and

437
00:22:47.475 --> 00:22:49.916
should have choice about what they eat and whether

438
00:22:49.916 --> 00:22:52.196
they're eating for health and heart health or weight

439
00:22:52.196 --> 00:22:54.995
loss or any of those things. But yeah, I

440
00:22:54.995 --> 00:22:58.222
mean, We, I don't think there's good evidence that

441
00:22:58.222 --> 00:23:01.661
we ever only ate meat or only ate plants,

442
00:23:01.702 --> 00:23:04.141
at least, you know, after the meat from big

443
00:23:04.141 --> 00:23:08.222
animals started to come into our diets. So the

444
00:23:08.222 --> 00:23:11.982
idea also that hominins would have just excluded big

445
00:23:11.982 --> 00:23:15.942
categories of food, legumes and starchy vegetables and other

446
00:23:15.942 --> 00:23:18.102
things like that. I just, I don't see evidence

447
00:23:18.102 --> 00:23:18.541
for that.

448
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.660
And also there's the caveat that when we think

449
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:26.060
about uh modern I, I mean modern humans, not

450
00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.260
in the sense that you talk about them in

451
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:32.979
anthropology, but humans that live, that are alive now,

452
00:23:33.219 --> 00:23:35.689
that we are also the result of a sort

453
00:23:35.689 --> 00:23:40.380
of a gene culture co-evolutionary process. And so the

454
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.095
people who were or Evolved in agricultural societies also

455
00:23:45.095 --> 00:23:49.965
eventually evolved specific adaptations to process, for example, cereal,

456
00:23:50.176 --> 00:23:52.076
milk, and stuff like that.

457
00:23:52.576 --> 00:23:54.895
Yes, and those are actually some of my favorite

458
00:23:54.895 --> 00:23:58.816
examples of recent evolution in humans adaptation to be

459
00:23:58.816 --> 00:24:01.906
able to consume lactose, the sugar, milk, sugar, and

460
00:24:01.906 --> 00:24:08.452
dairy, and genetic adaptations. Starch digestion in cultures where

461
00:24:08.452 --> 00:24:10.442
there was a lot of starch consumed, I think

462
00:24:10.442 --> 00:24:12.812
that's exactly right. And those are good examples of

463
00:24:12.812 --> 00:24:16.131
how, you know, even in the last 10,000, 20,000

464
00:24:16.131 --> 00:24:19.651
years, human diets have changed drastically, and there have

465
00:24:19.651 --> 00:24:24.732
been adaptations in different human populations based on those

466
00:24:24.732 --> 00:24:27.411
diets, that gene culture co-evolution like you said.

467
00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:31.040
Yeah. And I asked you that because sometimes we

468
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.319
hear from some people that wherever, whatever we started

469
00:24:36.319 --> 00:24:40.959
eating when we developed agriculture, we, we haven't had

470
00:24:40.959 --> 00:24:45.310
enough time to devolve adaptations to process cereals, milk,

471
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.469
beer, and stuff like that.

472
00:24:48.199 --> 00:24:50.594
Exactly. I have heard that argument. Times and I

473
00:24:50.594 --> 00:24:53.545
think there's great evidence to show that's absolutely not

474
00:24:53.545 --> 00:24:54.165
the case.

475
00:24:54.675 --> 00:24:57.915
So let me now for a more controversial question

476
00:24:57.915 --> 00:25:00.844
or a more controversial topic, you've also, you've also

477
00:25:00.844 --> 00:25:04.834
done a bit of work on human cannibalism. So

478
00:25:04.834 --> 00:25:08.255
what do we know about that both in ancient

479
00:25:08.255 --> 00:25:11.915
societies and possibly in contemporary societies?

480
00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.890
Yeah, and so I sort of stumbled into work

481
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:18.209
on human cannibalism in a sense. So it's not

482
00:25:18.209 --> 00:25:21.410
a big focus of my research, but I was

483
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:25.849
studying fossil human, human fossils, ancient human fossils, hominid

484
00:25:25.849 --> 00:25:29.079
fossils. I normally just study the animal fossils. I

485
00:25:29.079 --> 00:25:31.880
was interested in looking at those fossils from Kenya

486
00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:34.369
to get a sense of what carnivores may have

487
00:25:34.369 --> 00:25:38.050
actually been eating our ancestors. And surprisingly, I actually

488
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.329
found butchery marks on one of those hominid fossils.

489
00:25:41.689 --> 00:25:45.770
So possibly cannibalism, people cutting apart each other and

490
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.969
maybe eating each other. It seems to be cannibalism

491
00:25:49.969 --> 00:25:52.920
seems to be, you know, an intermittent, also part

492
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.000
of our evolutionary history, much deeper back in time.

493
00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:01.500
Certainly there are contemporary populations that Practice cannibalism or

494
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.040
at least historic populations that have for a variety

495
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.599
of reasons. Some of it is kind of aggressive

496
00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:08.599
cannibalism where, you know, it has to do with

497
00:26:08.599 --> 00:26:12.119
warfare. Some of it is really, you know, wonderful

498
00:26:12.119 --> 00:26:15.550
rituals that have to do with honoring ancestors. So

499
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:19.030
again, all culturally mediated really and a whole variety

500
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.199
of reasons, but it does seem to be a

501
00:26:22.199 --> 00:26:25.239
part of human cultures.

502
00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:29.550
But is it that it tends to occur more

503
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.869
in specific circumstances like I don't know when we

504
00:26:32.869 --> 00:26:37.239
have a particular kind of ecology or certain cultural

505
00:26:37.239 --> 00:26:38.910
practices, how

506
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.489
does it. That's a good question that I don't

507
00:26:41.489 --> 00:26:45.170
know the answer to. I certainly from the reading

508
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.569
that I've done about cannibalism, there are a lot

509
00:26:48.569 --> 00:26:51.609
of the earlier examples are probably what are called

510
00:26:51.609 --> 00:26:55.760
what's nutritional cannibalism. Basically people are hungry and starving,

511
00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.170
and that's why they tend to maybe eat other

512
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.885
people in their group. OR maybe another group again,

513
00:27:00.964 --> 00:27:02.685
it may still have to do with culture and

514
00:27:02.685 --> 00:27:05.724
aggression, but I don't know if there's a kind

515
00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:10.244
of patterns about where for historic and modern humans

516
00:27:10.244 --> 00:27:15.074
whether cannibalism has been practiced in specific ecologies areas,

517
00:27:15.305 --> 00:27:17.194
social circumstances, I don't know the answer to that.

518
00:27:17.204 --> 00:27:17.925
It's a good question.

519
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.859
Yeah. No, it would be very interesting to know

520
00:27:20.859 --> 00:27:23.739
that because, I, I mean, of course, there are

521
00:27:23.739 --> 00:27:28.849
probably certain societies where, uh, a taboo against, uh,

522
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:33.800
eating human meat is not, uh, very prevalent. I,

523
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.900
I mean, it's not as big as what we

524
00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:40.469
have in our more modern. Industrialized societies and stuff

525
00:27:40.469 --> 00:27:44.869
like that. But it could be that certain the

526
00:27:44.869 --> 00:27:48.180
societies where that happens, that is the result of

527
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.430
the particular ecological conditions they live in. And that

528
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.150
would be simply sort of, um, I don't know,

529
00:27:54.349 --> 00:27:57.430
a form of evoked culture or something like that.

530
00:27:57.589 --> 00:27:57.709
Yeah,

531
00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.030
it could be. Mhm.

532
00:27:59.979 --> 00:28:03.369
So, I then have one last topic I would

533
00:28:03.369 --> 00:28:05.020
like to ask you about. As I said at

534
00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.130
the beginning, you've also talked about and write about

535
00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.859
uh some of the challenges of communicating about and

536
00:28:12.859 --> 00:28:17.560
teaching about human history, human evolution, sorry. So what

537
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.900
would you say are the biggest challenges there?

538
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.780
So I think there's a few categories of big

539
00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.219
challenges. One is that there are people that have

540
00:28:26.219 --> 00:28:29.780
deep religious faith that find human evolution a really

541
00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:34.180
uncomfortable idea based on their religious teachings. And so

542
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.849
I think that's kind of one category. Also, um,

543
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:41.050
evolution is not an easy topic to understand a

544
00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.530
lot of the time. So I think there's just

545
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.130
basically sort of cognitive challenges to thinking about the

546
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.050
deep time scales over which a lot of evolution

547
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.540
occurs are hard for us to comprehend. Um, SO

548
00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.699
yeah, and I think there's also, you know, evolution

549
00:28:54.699 --> 00:28:58.969
has been, it, uh, you know, sometimes politicized and

550
00:28:58.969 --> 00:29:01.609
also from a social perspective, I think there are

551
00:29:01.969 --> 00:29:04.770
ideas about like, you know, what, what you accept

552
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.060
in your cultural and social group. So I think

553
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.380
it's, you know, those are kind of the main

554
00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.420
challenges I would say.

555
00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.199
Mhm. So, would you say that perhaps one of

556
00:29:14.199 --> 00:29:17.599
the big challenges has to do with it not

557
00:29:17.599 --> 00:29:20.349
being very intuitive? I mean, when we think in,

558
00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:25.189
in evolutionary terms, uh, of course, eventually we'll learn

559
00:29:25.189 --> 00:29:27.959
to think that way, but at the beginning, it's

560
00:29:27.959 --> 00:29:29.160
not very intuitive,

561
00:29:29.239 --> 00:29:32.239
right? Exactly. And there have been really interesting studies

562
00:29:32.239 --> 00:29:34.880
with children about like teaching the building blocks of.

563
00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.390
AND that there, you know, there's, there's other ways

564
00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:40.750
of thinking that tend to be more intuitive that

565
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.430
are sort of some of it is a little

566
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.150
bit Lamarckian, like the, you know, acacia tree in

567
00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:48.380
back of me, that maybe giraffes necks grew longer,

568
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.390
um, just in order to reach those trees. So

569
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.869
the idea of like change happening because of a

570
00:29:53.869 --> 00:29:56.750
need, like there's a couple of categories of really

571
00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.469
common misconceptions about evolution that are just Um, I

572
00:30:00.469 --> 00:30:02.609
don't know, kind of shortcut thinking that makes sense.

573
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:06.510
And so, um, trying to teach, teach the, you

574
00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.750
know, actual evidence and things can be a little

575
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:09.660
bit challenging.

576
00:30:10.339 --> 00:30:12.849
Mhm. And of course, you've already mentioned some of

577
00:30:12.849 --> 00:30:16.810
the reasons, but uh thinking about when you try

578
00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:20.689
to teach human evolution to people, what would you

579
00:30:20.689 --> 00:30:24.329
say are perhaps some of the main reasons why

580
00:30:24.329 --> 00:30:27.530
so many people tend to reject that we are

581
00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.010
the result of evolutionary processes?

582
00:30:30.619 --> 00:30:32.410
I think, yeah, a couple of reasons. One, as

583
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.479
I mentioned about, you know, spiritual or religious faith,

584
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:39.290
thinking about how humans are in many ways we

585
00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.910
think of ourselves as really special, really different. How

586
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:46.770
could that have possibly evolved through natural processes? It

587
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:50.295
all For many people takes away from the specialness,

588
00:30:50.925 --> 00:30:52.344
and it can be a little bit of a

589
00:30:52.344 --> 00:30:56.614
scary perspective if you think that it, you know,

590
00:30:56.744 --> 00:31:02.704
the only natural processes led to modern humans. So

591
00:31:02.704 --> 00:31:06.505
I think um there's also ways of thinking of

592
00:31:06.505 --> 00:31:10.135
that as beautiful and about humans connected to nature.

593
00:31:10.744 --> 00:31:13.994
Um SO yeah, so I think, I think um.

594
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.530
IT'S, it's both kind of a, you know, religious

595
00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:22.770
spiritual perspectives. There's also unfortunately been, you know, biological

596
00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:26.969
anthropology and ideas about human evolution have had a

597
00:31:26.969 --> 00:31:30.599
lot of racism in the history of the discipline

598
00:31:30.599 --> 00:31:35.160
and so I think there's Also some understandable rejection

599
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:39.079
of ideas of human evolution based on past racist

600
00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:42.119
ideas of a hierarchy of types of people which

601
00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.650
I think the discipline is working hard to really

602
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:48.000
reckon with and try to, you know, to correct

603
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.770
and undo.

604
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.689
Do you think that uh when people write, for

605
00:31:53.689 --> 00:31:57.290
example, for a general audience, for, for the general

606
00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:00.869
population to try to teach them about human evolution

607
00:32:00.869 --> 00:32:03.750
that they should be a bit careful in the

608
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.800
ways they expose information because you mentioned, for example,

609
00:32:06.869 --> 00:32:10.782
racism there and I, I'm not uh Naming any

610
00:32:10.782 --> 00:32:14.182
names here, but there are people that also probably

611
00:32:14.182 --> 00:32:20.463
the ways they oversimplify how our evolution occurred might

612
00:32:20.463 --> 00:32:25.932
lead to people acquiring wrong ideas about it,

613
00:32:26.142 --> 00:32:29.983
right? Yes, absolutely. I think scientists and other experts.

614
00:32:30.076 --> 00:32:32.095
WE need to take a lot of care with

615
00:32:32.095 --> 00:32:34.916
the language that we use. I think, you know,

616
00:32:34.936 --> 00:32:40.056
the balance between making things understandable and accessible and

617
00:32:40.056 --> 00:32:43.015
taking shortcuts that can be misunderstood is something we

618
00:32:43.015 --> 00:32:45.855
really need to pay good attention to, particularly when

619
00:32:45.855 --> 00:32:48.776
we're writing or talking for the public about human

620
00:32:48.776 --> 00:32:50.176
evolution. Absolutely.

621
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.609
And by the way, and this will be my

622
00:32:52.609 --> 00:32:55.670
last question, what do you think are perhaps some

623
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.589
of the things that you like the most when

624
00:32:58.589 --> 00:33:01.619
it comes to teaching human evolution?

625
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:06.109
Um, I think, you know, humans, all humans alive

626
00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:08.949
today are the result of 6 million years of

627
00:33:08.949 --> 00:33:13.599
evolution, um, and so thinking about Yes, we're the

628
00:33:13.599 --> 00:33:17.239
only human species left on the family tree, and

629
00:33:17.239 --> 00:33:19.239
I think that gives us pause, but I think

630
00:33:19.239 --> 00:33:24.089
it's also amazing to think about really the unity

631
00:33:24.089 --> 00:33:27.280
of modern humans. We, a lot of us look

632
00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.079
different. We feel like there's so much differences among.

633
00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:34.180
BUT I actually think that human evolution can be

634
00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:38.609
kind of lessons in deep human unity and that

635
00:33:38.609 --> 00:33:42.640
we're pretty persistent. Homo sapiens, our species. We have

636
00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.719
persisted where, you know, maybe 20 plus species on

637
00:33:45.719 --> 00:33:48.859
the human family tree have gone extinct. Um, SO

638
00:33:48.859 --> 00:33:50.219
I think that's one of the things I like.

639
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.939
Also, oftentimes when I'm working with school groups or

640
00:33:53.939 --> 00:33:57.339
visitors in our museum and you watch particularly kids

641
00:33:57.339 --> 00:34:00.380
like get it, and oh, this is, oh, and

642
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.800
I can do this, and oh, and I can

643
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.979
be part of the discovery process and I can

644
00:34:03.979 --> 00:34:08.260
see this piece of evidence. I love watching like

645
00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.489
faces light up like that, so I really enjoy

646
00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:10.780
that.

647
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.679
And the way by which we are interrelated and

648
00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:17.409
when people learn about that, I guess it would

649
00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:20.000
also be at least in certain cases, a very

650
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:25.350
potent thing against or a very potent way of

651
00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.850
fighting back against racism and all of that,

652
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.958
exactly, exactly. So I think that, you know, hopefully

653
00:34:30.958 --> 00:34:34.219
we can sort of use human evolution in a

654
00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:36.918
sense for that sort of good in our discipline.

655
00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:41.129
Yeah, because we are all ultimately African, right?

656
00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:44.790
That's the origin of our species, absolutely, and we're

657
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:47.478
all related. We're all cousins in some way. So

658
00:34:47.478 --> 00:34:49.260
I think that's a really important message.

659
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:53.139
OK, great. So before we go, would you like

660
00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:55.458
to tell people where they can find you and

661
00:34:55.458 --> 00:34:57.139
your work on the internet?

662
00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:01.429
Sure, so you can find me and my work

663
00:35:01.429 --> 00:35:04.820
on Facebook, Twitter, if you search my name on

664
00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:08.260
both of those Instagram, but also if you want

665
00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.020
to learn more about my research, you can go

666
00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:16.235
to human origins.si.edu. And find me under the the,

667
00:35:16.245 --> 00:35:19.794
you know, human evolution, the human origins program, people.

668
00:35:20.445 --> 00:35:22.165
You can also Google my name and I have

669
00:35:22.165 --> 00:35:25.514
a research page on the Smithsonian Natural History Museum

670
00:35:25.514 --> 00:35:27.564
website that talks a little bit more about all

671
00:35:27.564 --> 00:35:29.274
the different research projects that I have.

672
00:35:29.844 --> 00:35:31.925
Great. So I will be leaving some links to

673
00:35:31.925 --> 00:35:34.205
that in the description of the interview, and Dr.

674
00:35:34.485 --> 00:35:37.364
