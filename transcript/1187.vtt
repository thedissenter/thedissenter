00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.059
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:05.920
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs, and

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.199
today I'm joined by Doctor Peter Turchin. He is

4
00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:12.640
Emeritus professor at the University of Connecticut. He's also

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.440
a project leader at the Complexity Science Hub Vienna.

6
00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.450
And today, we're going to talk a little bit

7
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.870
about some of the main topics he's been working

8
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.129
on throughout his, uh, life. So, uh, uh, uh,

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.270
but he's, I also want to mention that his

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.770
latest book is The Great Holocene Transformation. So Doctor

11
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.029
Turchin, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

12
00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.189
everyone.

13
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.279
Thank you. Glad to be here.

14
00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:41.889
So I, I would like to ask you first,

15
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.959
and I hope we have time to get a

16
00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:48.130
little bit more into detail here, but uh what

17
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.810
causes political communities to cohere and what causes them

18
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.590
to fall apart because this is something that you've

19
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.169
worked on.

20
00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:01.360
Well, that's a huge question, so you probably want

21
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.370
to break it up into, um, into smaller, uh,

22
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.080
questions. Uh, LET'S start by talking about the, um,

23
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.370
you know, uh, about what causes. Uh, POLITICAL communities

24
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.169
to cohere because that's the subject of my latest

25
00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:23.290
book, as you mentioned, the Great Holocene, uh, Transformation.

26
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.129
I should warn, uh, your listeners that this is

27
00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:29.610
an academic book. It's not a popular book. Uh,

28
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.830
IF you want to, uh, read a popular introduction

29
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.529
to these ideas, I have another book which I

30
00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:40.379
published about, mm, uh, in 2015. Uh, CALLED, um,

31
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.470
ultra society. All right, so, um, so the ideas,

32
00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:51.050
uh, are the, uh, general, mm, theory which underlies,

33
00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:55.309
uh, the, um, and, uh, my understanding of the

34
00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:59.589
evolution of large scale complex societies is explained in

35
00:01:59.589 --> 00:02:03.769
outer society. And now it has been extensively tested

36
00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:07.849
empirically with um a massive data set we have

37
00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.729
collected since then using the what you call this

38
00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:15.410
a shot uh the uh Global History Data Bank.

39
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.169
Right, so, um, so let's talk about, uh, quick,

40
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.649
quick introduction. Human species, um, is considered to be

41
00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:32.369
about 200,000 years old, all right, and for 97%

42
00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:36.000
of our history, actually often for 95% of our

43
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.729
history, evolutionary history, we've lived in small-scale societies numbering

44
00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:44.389
in the, uh, some hundreds or maybe low thousands.

45
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.699
And then in the last 10,000 years during the

46
00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:54.020
um uh geological epoch called the Holocene, all right,

47
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.339
suddenly the scale and complexity of human societies literally

48
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.759
exploded. Uh, YOU know, uh, there are some states,

49
00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:06.410
um, on, um, you know, in, on Earth that,

50
00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:11.179
uh, number more than Uh, 1 billion individuals and

51
00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.300
many large states have hundreds of millions living in

52
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.690
them. So this is a huge, uh, change and,

53
00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.940
um, one part of my research has been addressing

54
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.139
the question, how can we understand that, what were

55
00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:29.179
the, uh, mechanisms and evolutionary forces that resulted in

56
00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:31.919
this, uh, change. Mhm.

57
00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:35.110
Uh, AND so, but, but I mean, uh, what

58
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.589
are perhaps the main mechanisms that you would say

59
00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:45.949
play a role in, uh, political societies evolving, growing

60
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.070
larger, scaling up, and so on.

61
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.240
Yeah, well, um, there are many theories, uh, in

62
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.000
fact, there are hundreds of, uh, special theories, but

63
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.820
there are several general themes. Some people point to

64
00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:04.580
the adoption of agriculture, and there is a general,

65
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.800
uh, consensus which I, which includes myself, that, that,

66
00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:12.250
uh, adoption of agriculture was a necessary condition. But

67
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.990
not sufficient because there are many regions on Earth

68
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.678
such as New Guinea for example that had agriculture

69
00:04:20.678 --> 00:04:24.190
for many thousands of years but did not, um,

70
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.250
develop states until they were, uh, you know, colonized

71
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.654
by Europeans, all right. So then other theories, um,

72
00:04:33.714 --> 00:04:35.635
uh, uh, there are some other theories which are

73
00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:38.934
functional theories, they basically point to some function that

74
00:04:39.274 --> 00:04:44.075
states, uh, fulfill and, uh, uh, try to understand

75
00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.415
the evolution of states by uh appealing to this,

76
00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:49.510
uh, function. And then there are many theories which

77
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.549
include various kinds of coercion. Some theories talk about

78
00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:59.989
internal um uh violence, so the famous Marxian, Marxian

79
00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:04.040
Engels uh theories. Other theories talk about, um, external

80
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.239
coercion and the warfare. So the theory that I

81
00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:12.269
have been, uh, that I've been working on, which

82
00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:15.359
I think is the best, both, uh, it is

83
00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:19.040
both, uh, theoretically the best justified, all right, and

84
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.149
it is also empirically supported. This theory arises in

85
00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:26.130
the new discipline of cultural evolution and it's called

86
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.709
cultural multi-level selection. The main idea there that it

87
00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:36.899
was a competition between societies or rather, uh, to

88
00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:41.049
be more precise polities. A polity is a politically

89
00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:46.149
independent organization that includes, um, you know, uh, the

90
00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:50.234
states and Inspires, modern nation states, uh, chiefdoms of

91
00:05:50.234 --> 00:05:55.234
various kinds, and also small-scale societies such as agricultural

92
00:05:55.234 --> 00:06:00.774
Neolithic villages or even hunt, uh, hunter-gatherer, uh, camps,

93
00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:04.945
um, and, uh, small-scale societies of this kind. So,

94
00:06:05.195 --> 00:06:10.265
um, a similar cultural multi-level selection theory focuses on

95
00:06:10.265 --> 00:06:15.140
competition between polities. And assigns that as the driving

96
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.899
force, uh, in evolution of complex societies. Essentially, the

97
00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:23.489
idea is, um, fairly simple, uh, and it is

98
00:06:23.489 --> 00:06:27.299
present already in Charles Darwin. Uh, SO the idea

99
00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:32.200
is that, um, uh, competition between societies, especially during

100
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.220
the, uh, Holocene which when it, uh, took the

101
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.450
form of warfare. Uh, DROVE, um, evolution of large

102
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.130
scale simply because a larger scale polities have a

103
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:50.450
better advantage of small-scale polities both in defense and

104
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.769
perhaps collective predation. All right, but also in order

105
00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:58.290
to keep the, uh, large, uh, in order, in,

106
00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:00.649
in, in order to grow to large scale uh

107
00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:04.910
without falling apart. You need many uh new institutions.

108
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.220
So it was this competition between politics that selected

109
00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:14.619
for larger and larger, both scale and institutional uh

110
00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:15.380
complexity.

111
00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:21.470
Do we have a good understanding of the factors

112
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.269
that contribute to the collapse of complex societies? BECAUSE

113
00:07:26.269 --> 00:07:30.390
I mean we tend to hear many different theories,

114
00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:33.510
some of them do not seem to have lots

115
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.589
of scientific support, others seem to have a little

116
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:40.029
bit more, but what do we know about what

117
00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:43.470
causes the collapse of complex societies?

118
00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:47.179
Well, um, there are many, again, there are many

119
00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:50.140
theories, and let me just, uh, uh, uh, just

120
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.579
step back for a moment. So the theory of

121
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.799
cultural multilevel selection. Uh, HOW do we know that

122
00:07:56.799 --> 00:07:59.279
it is supported? First of all, you want to

123
00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:02.260
know that it is internally consistent and the only

124
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.160
way to do that is to translate theory into

125
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.100
mathematical models, all right, so we have both, uh,

126
00:08:09.109 --> 00:08:13.519
analytical and uh analytically solved mathematical models and of

127
00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:18.220
course more realistic computational models called agent-based uh Uh,

128
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:23.350
simulations. Um, SO these models, uh, uh, actually tell

129
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.019
us that if we, um, that our, this, uh,

130
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:31.350
our, mm, the set of assumptions we make about

131
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:36.909
how, uh, large-scale complex societies evolved actually is consistent

132
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:40.219
because when you translate them into mathematical models, uh,

133
00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:43.979
they, uh, these models. Greater dynamics that you propose

134
00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:46.539
to happen and of course then um the models

135
00:08:46.539 --> 00:08:50.820
are also very important because we can extract quantitative

136
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.580
predictions from them and then test those predictions with

137
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.919
data. So in my book, um, The Great Coloscene

138
00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:03.849
Transformation, I go through this uh both, um, uh,

139
00:09:03.859 --> 00:09:08.030
both, uh, modeling. Uh, MATERIAL and empirical material. All

140
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.869
right, so now back to your question, uh, again,

141
00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:16.489
there are many theories about why, um, complex societies,

142
00:09:16.539 --> 00:09:20.619
um, may collapse. Um, WHAT we know is that

143
00:09:20.619 --> 00:09:23.349
it's not even inevitable. OK, first of all, let's

144
00:09:23.349 --> 00:09:27.309
again step back to one, very, um, you know,

145
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.950
theory which, um, which many people talk about is

146
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.729
Joseph Tainter, uh, which the theory that says that

147
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.880
Uh, complex societies collapse because they, uh, they become

148
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.559
too complex. They have acquired too many complex, too

149
00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:47.400
much complexity. This is called sometimes complexity overhang and

150
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.419
so those societies collapse because they have too much

151
00:09:50.419 --> 00:09:54.280
complexity. But the theory that um I and my

152
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.400
colleagues advocate actually says that most complexity that evolved

153
00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:03.880
such as uh institutional complexity, um, and, um, you

154
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.119
know, technological complexity and many other things, that's actually

155
00:10:08.119 --> 00:10:12.609
useful. Uh, COMPLEXITY and in fact they make societies

156
00:10:12.609 --> 00:10:17.869
more stable or, uh, more resilient actually so uh

157
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.690
they can adapt to new conditions without um falling

158
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:26.250
apart, all right so the theory that I and

159
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.489
my colleagues favor is called structural demographic theory and

160
00:10:31.489 --> 00:10:34.780
that theory is actually explained in another. A book,

161
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.409
um, end, end Times, which was published about 2

162
00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:42.099
or 3 years ago and so people can actually

163
00:10:42.099 --> 00:10:46.260
find out the details there, all right, but very

164
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.359
briefly, um, what we see is that, um, so,

165
00:10:50.739 --> 00:10:56.380
uh, complex societies organized states appeared about 5000 years

166
00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.539
ago, really in the last, uh, 2 or 3%.

167
00:10:59.969 --> 00:11:03.729
Of our evolutionary history, so they're very noble and

168
00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:07.510
the first ones were quite fragile and they kept,

169
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.830
uh, uh, they had a high probability of collapsing,

170
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.599
but as they accumulated more institutions, they became more

171
00:11:15.599 --> 00:11:21.010
resilient to, uh, to forces of collapse and so

172
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:25.010
we see this, um, that as they approach them.

173
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.440
Uh, THE, the approach today, you see first of

174
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.679
all that even though societies periodically get stressed, they

175
00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:36.239
are much less likely to have a complete collapse,

176
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.239
so they just have a series of civil wars

177
00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:43.520
or revolutions which they live through and then reconstituted

178
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.539
uh themselves, all right, and the periods of this,

179
00:11:48.549 --> 00:11:53.080
mm, uh, of this, uh, instability, they become, they

180
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.380
have become shorter. All right. But the general rule

181
00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.780
still remains that uh all complex societies including our

182
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:07.219
own experience these periodic waves of internal instability roughly

183
00:12:07.219 --> 00:12:10.659
at about 20 or 300 century intervals.

184
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.859
Uh, AND how did you arrive at that, uh,

185
00:12:16.049 --> 00:12:19.780
2-300 year interval? I mean, and do you have

186
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.880
an explanation as to why that sort of interval,

187
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.000
uh, occurs, why we have that, those sorts of

188
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.950
cycles, let's say.

189
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:35.900
Yeah, so these are not, um, uh, uh, perfectly

190
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.169
periodic mathematical cycles. Rather, it's, uh, yeah, there is,

191
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.679
it's more like maybe the better dynamic, a better,

192
00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:48.099
mm, uh, word would be boom bust dynamics. How

193
00:12:48.099 --> 00:12:49.859
do, first of all, how do you know that

194
00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:55.059
this happens? Well, um, uh, in our, um, um.

195
00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.989
You know, uh, uh, brand of science which we

196
00:12:58.989 --> 00:13:03.270
call Cleo dynamics from Cleo, the Muse of history

197
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.869
and dynamics, the science of change. All right, we,

198
00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:10.869
um, treat history just as any other natural or

199
00:13:10.869 --> 00:13:15.119
social, uh Sciences, which means that um uh we

200
00:13:15.119 --> 00:13:20.760
want to quantify various processes that um we um

201
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:26.520
observe in um uh history and specifically um talking

202
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.460
about instability. Uh, uh, MY, uh, research group has

203
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.070
spent a lot of, mm, devoted a lot of

204
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:39.150
energy and time and resources to quantifying instability. So

205
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.789
how do we do it? Well, first of all,

206
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:47.849
um, we, uh, look to recorded histories and we,

207
00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:54.109
um, simply record all kinds of political violence events

208
00:13:54.109 --> 00:13:57.799
that may range from microviol events such as a

209
00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.390
In urban riot or um, you know, uh, or

210
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.609
a rural insurrection that may result in killing a

211
00:14:04.609 --> 00:14:07.729
few people. So we only look at, uh, at

212
00:14:07.729 --> 00:14:10.770
events which are lethal because that's, mm, first of

213
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.580
all, that's clear that this is violence, right? And

214
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.820
secondly, they're much more likely to be recorded, right,

215
00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:20.500
and then, um, uh, this, uh, the scale of

216
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.010
these events, uh, goes all the way to full-blown

217
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:29.140
civil wars or transformative revolutions that make you, you

218
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.419
know, sometimes millions or even in some cases tens

219
00:14:32.419 --> 00:14:35.500
of millions of people. So what we do is

220
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.820
one approach is we, we, we collect Mm, data

221
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.340
on such events and then you look at the

222
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.039
statistical distribution of such events and what you find,

223
00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:50.039
uh, when you do it, you find that, um,

224
00:14:50.099 --> 00:14:54.179
uh, complex societies organized states may function reasonably well

225
00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:56.940
for a century or so with, uh, while, while

226
00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.059
keeping internal peace. Uh, SO we would see very

227
00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:04.539
low, um, incidence of political violence events and they

228
00:15:04.539 --> 00:15:07.059
would be small in scale, all right, but then

229
00:15:07.059 --> 00:15:11.080
inevitably, uh, periods of, uh, you know, end times

230
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.179
arrive and then we often see centuries, sometimes even

231
00:15:15.179 --> 00:15:20.580
longer periods of disintegration, disintegrative, uh, phases during which

232
00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:25.700
you have social turbulence, political violence, oftentimes, sometimes leading

233
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.549
to collapse, meaning that Um, you know, a substantial

234
00:15:29.549 --> 00:15:34.989
proportion of population either disappears, either, uh, Diazovsky is

235
00:15:34.989 --> 00:15:37.669
killed and, you know, or they run away. All

236
00:15:37.669 --> 00:15:41.140
right, we see a, uh, collapse of, uh, states,

237
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.390
um, uh, who that lose, uh, central authority and

238
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:49.309
fragment into smaller scale polities and things like that.

239
00:15:49.469 --> 00:15:52.869
So collapse is not inevitable, but it is actually

240
00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:57.840
fairly frequent during those, uh, disintegrative phases. And then

241
00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.799
somehow, uh, and then sometimes society has just collapsed

242
00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:04.900
and are never seen again. So for example, in,

243
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.840
um, in what's now Pakistan, Indus Valley, the Indus

244
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.099
Valley Civilization was quite, um, amazing civilization for several

245
00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:19.349
100 years. And then it, uh, collapsed to the

246
00:16:19.349 --> 00:16:22.390
point where it disappeared. We don't even know what

247
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.830
language they spoke, all right, and there was a

248
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:30.239
period of when, uh, there were no Uh, you

249
00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:34.080
know, no large scale settlement cities, no cities, um,

250
00:16:34.359 --> 00:16:38.830
no, no evidence of, mm, of, um, you know,

251
00:16:39.159 --> 00:16:43.260
large scale societies. Yes, so, uh, so some societies

252
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.640
experienced such collapses. Others are famous examples of collapses

253
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.299
such as the Maya, uh, states. In fact, they,

254
00:16:52.039 --> 00:16:58.099
after some period, uh, other Mayan, uh, polities. Um,

255
00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.570
AROSE maybe not in exactly the same position but

256
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.290
in the same general area and there is, as

257
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.160
a result of that, Maya, the Maya, Mayan people

258
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.969
are still, uh, you know, they still live in

259
00:17:09.969 --> 00:17:14.010
Yucatan, uh, in Mexico. And you know, uh, they

260
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.709
speak, still speak, uh, their language which is descendant

261
00:17:16.709 --> 00:17:19.079
of what they spoke and so on and so

262
00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:22.130
forth. And then other societies don't collapse, so you

263
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.170
see these waves of instability as I mentioned, 2

264
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:29.609
at 2 or 300 years, 23 centuries, um, so

265
00:17:29.609 --> 00:17:32.640
for example, So right now we live in such

266
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.239
a wave of uh, of instability, that's very clear.

267
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.869
The previous one is, uh, is called the Age

268
00:17:38.869 --> 00:17:43.839
of Revolutions, roughly speaking from 1789 to maybe beginning

269
00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:48.949
of, uh, 20th century, so 19th century. Before that

270
00:17:48.949 --> 00:17:52.459
we had the general crisis of the 17th century.

271
00:17:52.949 --> 00:17:55.430
Before that, the late medieval crisis and so on

272
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:59.030
back um into the past, we see every 2

273
00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.270
or 3 years, uh sorry, every 2 or 3

274
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:06.229
centuries recurring waves of uh instability and as I

275
00:18:06.229 --> 00:18:08.834
said, As we get closer to the day, these

276
00:18:08.834 --> 00:18:13.755
waves of instability, um, uh, um, result in fewer,

277
00:18:14.114 --> 00:18:18.454
in lesser probability of utter collapse. So societies managed

278
00:18:18.454 --> 00:18:23.464
to somehow solve those, uh, those problems and, uh,

279
00:18:23.474 --> 00:18:25.055
reconstitute themselves.

280
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.709
So, uh, later in our conversation, I hope we

281
00:18:29.709 --> 00:18:32.969
get the time to get more into the current

282
00:18:32.969 --> 00:18:36.910
instability we're going through right now, but I would

283
00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:40.630
like to ask you now particularly about one concept

284
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.430
that you've been working on a lot, that is

285
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:48.270
the one of elite overproduction. So, uh, could you

286
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.530
tell us about that, what elite overproduction is and

287
00:18:52.869 --> 00:18:54.150
what leads to it?

288
00:18:55.229 --> 00:18:58.630
Yes, in fact, uh, talking about, um, these waves

289
00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:03.369
of instability, they have a complex of forces, but,

290
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.150
uh, one of the most important ones and certainly

291
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:11.680
the one which is, um, uh, uh, most, um,

292
00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:17.390
uh, uh, common, commonly present during these periods is

293
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:21.680
what we call it overproduction. So this is uh

294
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.270
this is a short uh term what we mean

295
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.280
actually is that, um, first, uh, oh, first let

296
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.979
me just give you some definitions. First of all,

297
00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:33.959
who are the elites? This is, uh, simply a

298
00:19:33.959 --> 00:19:39.430
neutral sociological definition. Uh, A small proportion of the

299
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:44.579
population, 1 to sometimes, uh, more% who concentrate social

300
00:19:44.579 --> 00:19:48.060
power in their hands, and social power includes such

301
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.979
varieties as military power, administrative power, economic power, and

302
00:19:52.979 --> 00:19:59.579
ideological or persuasion. Um, SO, um, uh, what's important

303
00:19:59.579 --> 00:20:03.540
about elites is how this, they are reproduced, obviously,

304
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.300
um, uh, you know, uh, people, uh, age and

305
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.339
retire or die and so they need to be

306
00:20:10.339 --> 00:20:13.660
replaced. So people who would like to replace, who

307
00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.449
would like to become parts of at least, you

308
00:20:15.449 --> 00:20:18.180
call them, you know, elite aspirants, you know, these

309
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.300
are elite wannabes. And there are always more uh

310
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:26.459
elite aspirants than mm their positions for them and

311
00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:29.219
some of this, uh, some of the, this, this

312
00:20:29.219 --> 00:20:33.910
results in competition which um when it's reasonable, you,

313
00:20:33.979 --> 00:20:36.939
uh, it's, it's quite, uh, it's a good thing

314
00:20:36.939 --> 00:20:41.060
because, you know, you want better, um, candidates to,

315
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.219
uh, to succeed rather than just, um, uh, allow

316
00:20:46.219 --> 00:20:49.849
everybody to become a power holder. But the problem

317
00:20:49.849 --> 00:20:54.569
is that sometimes the number of elite aspirants begins

318
00:20:54.569 --> 00:20:58.810
to overwhelm the number of positions, you know, so

319
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.790
it's, uh, not just, uh, you know, like let's

320
00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:05.170
say 50% more or twice as many, but 3

321
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.489
times, 5 times, even 10 times, and so once

322
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:13.430
we see such uh such, um, Uh, intense competition,

323
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:19.479
that's actually counterproductive because so many, um, elite aspirants,

324
00:21:19.819 --> 00:21:23.410
uh, are frustrated in their goals, and many of

325
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.930
them are quite, you know, quite good, all right,

326
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:30.449
and so, um, they consider the situation to be

327
00:21:30.449 --> 00:21:34.599
blatantly unfair. And so, um, some of them, uh,

328
00:21:34.609 --> 00:21:38.569
turn into counter-elites, and counter-elites, they are, uh, there

329
00:21:38.569 --> 00:21:41.800
are still people who viewed power oftentimes, but they

330
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:46.449
are, uh, they use, um, uh, they, uh, work

331
00:21:46.449 --> 00:21:50.530
against the established elites. So think about famous revolutionaries

332
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.709
like Fidel Castro and Los Barrabudos, for example, or

333
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:58.489
Vladimir, uh, Lenin and the Bolsheviks and so on

334
00:21:58.489 --> 00:22:02.032
and so forth. All right, these are counter-elites, uh,

335
00:22:02.152 --> 00:22:06.833
they build power to overthrow the established elites, so

336
00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:10.753
the, for example, the Romanev dynasty in the case

337
00:22:10.753 --> 00:22:15.672
of, um, of the Bolsheviks, well, um, and install

338
00:22:15.672 --> 00:22:20.422
themselves as the new, uh, established elites, right? So,

339
00:22:20.512 --> 00:22:24.353
um, so, um, uh, so, uh, the long term

340
00:22:24.353 --> 00:22:28.696
would be over. Production of elite aspirants, but, you

341
00:22:28.696 --> 00:22:31.755
know, uh, we just shortened it to elite overproduction

342
00:22:32.056 --> 00:22:37.715
and that is in fact, um, the essentially ubiquitous,

343
00:22:37.776 --> 00:22:44.576
uh, condition leading to, um, major, mm crisis resulting,

344
00:22:44.645 --> 00:22:49.656
um, typically resulting in revolution, civil wars, or some

345
00:22:49.656 --> 00:22:53.446
periods of really high social turbulence and political, uh,

346
00:22:53.456 --> 00:22:54.255
violence.

347
00:22:55.719 --> 00:22:58.719
So, uh, and would you say that we are

348
00:22:58.719 --> 00:23:04.880
witnessing right now elite overproduction, uh, in several countries,

349
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.839
particularly, uh, I'm going to focus on the West

350
00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:12.599
here due to the expansion of higher education and

351
00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:18.719
the fact that since around the last great, uh.

352
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:23.739
Financial crisis of 2008 to 2009, many of those

353
00:23:23.739 --> 00:23:27.739
people who have attended higher education can no longer

354
00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:33.619
get access to the well paid jobs that they

355
00:23:33.619 --> 00:23:34.380
would like to.

356
00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.180
Yeah, well, it's, um, uh, things are a bit

357
00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:42.030
more complicated, uh, than that. So let's use, um,

358
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.900
the example of the United States, uh, that's the

359
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.020
country that, um, I know from inside because I've

360
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.219
lived there for, uh, my, uh, for all of

361
00:23:51.219 --> 00:23:54.380
my adult, uh, life and also United States has

362
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.949
actually entered this, um. Uh, PERIOD of, uh, stability

363
00:23:58.949 --> 00:24:03.329
earlier than, uh, Western European countries or East Asian

364
00:24:03.329 --> 00:24:07.310
countries such as Japan and South Korea, right, which

365
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:11.030
is similar. So, mm, so this is, this is

366
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:14.310
why it's a good example, uh, to, mm, to

367
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:18.589
use. In fact, I, back, um, uh, 16 years

368
00:24:18.589 --> 00:24:21.729
ago, I, I almost 16 years ago I published,

369
00:24:22.069 --> 00:24:26.670
uh, a forecast, um. Uh, THAT, uh, suggested that

370
00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.780
the United States was on the road to a

371
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:35.260
crisis that would, um, peak during the 2020. So,

372
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.390
Let me unpack, let me tell you what was

373
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:42.630
the basis of my, uh, prediction and, um, how

374
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:47.739
it works. So, um, so, um, illiteral production, uh,

375
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.030
has been developing in the United States and it

376
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.939
was very obvious by 2010 when I made this,

377
00:24:52.949 --> 00:24:55.530
uh, prediction. So what is the cause of it?

378
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.670
All right. Um, WHAT happened was that, uh, United

379
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:05.109
States, um, uh, was until about 1970s. The United

380
00:25:05.109 --> 00:25:08.170
States was in many ways a very highly socially

381
00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.290
democratic country. In fact, it may, it could be

382
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.890
thought of almost as a Nordic country similar to

383
00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.680
Denmark, you know, Sweden and so on and so

384
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.810
forth, um, and as a result of that, uh,

385
00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:24.410
the, um, uh, the uh uh the economic inequality

386
00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:30.050
has been declining, uh, from the beginning of the

387
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:35.569
20th century until 1980. Or so, but, um, during

388
00:25:35.569 --> 00:25:41.790
the 1970s, um, several mm, uh, changes were adopted

389
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:46.349
by the governing, uh, elites at the time which

390
00:25:46.349 --> 00:25:51.670
resulted in reversing this, uh, trend. So specifically, many

391
00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.390
people think about the Reagan, uh, revolution, but in

392
00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.439
fact it started even earlier under Carter. Uh, ESSENTIALLY,

393
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:03.339
uh, this resulted in, uh, taking away the, uh,

394
00:26:03.349 --> 00:26:06.449
much of the power that workers had to, um,

395
00:26:06.469 --> 00:26:11.050
to organize and to, um, to, uh, push for,

396
00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.380
uh, their salaries and many, um, you know, um,

397
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.270
other factors which resulted, uh, you know, which I

398
00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.829
described, uh, at length in my book in time,

399
00:26:20.949 --> 00:26:23.030
so let me, let me just summarize things. So

400
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:28.000
what happened was that prior to 1970s, Um, then,

401
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:33.540
um, uh, compensation of American workers was increasing together

402
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.880
with their productivity, right, and then, uh, in, in,

403
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.640
uh, in, in the late 1970s what happened that

404
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:45.079
productivity continued to increase, but the compensation wages and

405
00:26:45.079 --> 00:26:49.079
so on, uh, stagnated and even declined. So that

406
00:26:49.079 --> 00:26:52.880
difference between those things had to go somewhere, and

407
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.400
it, where it didn't go, it went to the

408
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.290
elites. Uh, PRIMARILY economic elites but also political, uh,

409
00:26:59.339 --> 00:27:03.219
and other types of elites. All right, so, uh,

410
00:27:03.229 --> 00:27:06.069
I call this process the wealth pump. It was

411
00:27:06.069 --> 00:27:10.449
essentially this mechanism that was taking wealth from the,

412
00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:15.229
uh, majority of population, the non-elite population, and gave

413
00:27:15.229 --> 00:27:19.130
it to the elites. So this had, um, three,

414
00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:25.140
consequences. First of all, it resulted in um stagnation

415
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.079
and even decline of well-being of the majority of

416
00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:31.859
population. So, uh, in our, in our jargon, we

417
00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:36.140
call it um popular immiseration and this was a

418
00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:41.750
true immiseration because eventually it resulted in biological mm

419
00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.000
Measures of well-being such as life expectancy or average

420
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.060
population height, stature declining, uh, as a result of,

421
00:27:51.079 --> 00:27:57.300
um, American, um, workers losing ground, right. So, um,

422
00:27:57.479 --> 00:28:02.250
in, uh, this immiseration also results in, uh, increased,

423
00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:07.579
uh, mass mobilization potential because people are upset about,

424
00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:11.780
um, you know, they They know that, uh, prior

425
00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:16.260
to that, every uh generation, um, every generation lived

426
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.660
better than the previous one, but that changed and

427
00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.819
so over the last couple of generations actually live

428
00:28:22.819 --> 00:28:25.770
worse than their parents and that, that, that causes

429
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.160
a lot of discontent. All right. So the second

430
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.239
thing was that this um wealth had to go

431
00:28:32.239 --> 00:28:36.280
somewhere and it resulted in a massive increase of

432
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:40.849
uh power of uh wealth holders. So for example,

433
00:28:40.959 --> 00:28:45.750
people who, or households that have 10 million. Uh,

434
00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.560
DOLLARS of wealth or more, this is in inflation-adjusted

435
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:54.439
dollars, right? Deca billionaires, their numbers over the past

436
00:28:54.439 --> 00:28:57.959
40 years increased tenfold, you know, the population has

437
00:28:57.959 --> 00:29:01.439
grown by 40%, but we have 10 times as

438
00:29:01.439 --> 00:29:04.760
many of, uh, such uber wealthy, and as you

439
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.319
go up, you get, um, uh, this gets more

440
00:29:08.319 --> 00:29:10.359
and more blown out. So for example, at the

441
00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:14.130
level of billionaires again. If we adjust, um, by,

442
00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:18.310
uh, for inflation, our cutoff, we have 20 times

443
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:23.030
as many billionaires now compared to 40 years ago.

444
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:27.869
So, uh, wealth holders are, um, um, this is

445
00:29:27.869 --> 00:29:30.869
an example of a bit of reproduction because in

446
00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:34.589
our societies such as, uh, you know, United States,

447
00:29:34.709 --> 00:29:37.500
Western Europe, and so on, we are governed by

448
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:43.699
a. COALITION of uh economic elites and um administrative

449
00:29:43.699 --> 00:29:47.260
elites, right, and of course mm the balance of

450
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.459
power uh changes depending on what country we're talking

451
00:29:50.459 --> 00:29:53.479
about. So for example, United States wealth holders really

452
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.859
Dominate whereas in countries like France, it's uh the

453
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:03.400
um it's the um administrative elites and how do

454
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.280
you get on, oh, I'll get to that, they

455
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.199
who have the, who have more power but that's

456
00:30:08.199 --> 00:30:12.040
been changing to this dynamic anyway, so having too

457
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:16.000
many wealthy people is a problem because they, many

458
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.880
of them want to become, um, play a role

459
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.040
in the politics. And so you have the, this

460
00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:28.489
um huge overproduction, 10-fold uh overproduction compared to, um,

461
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.920
you know, 40 or 50 years ago. OK, so

462
00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.199
this is the second, uh, consequence. Uh, WE, we

463
00:30:35.199 --> 00:30:39.439
talked about, mm, popular immiseration and overproduction of wealth

464
00:30:39.439 --> 00:30:42.660
holders. The third consequence is, is that as the

465
00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:46.719
general population immiserates, uh, then what this is now

466
00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:50.959
known as precarity, though people become part of precariat,

467
00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:52.510
which means that they live on the edge or

468
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:56.500
even Below the age. So that creates a, uh,

469
00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.890
an incredible uh push factor for people to escape

470
00:31:00.349 --> 00:31:02.430
that. And how do you do that? Well, in

471
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:05.630
our societies you go to college, all right, and

472
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.709
then as the college degree becomes devalued but too

473
00:31:08.709 --> 00:31:11.550
many people getting it, you, you get an advanced

474
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:15.829
degree such as law degree or uh PhD and

475
00:31:15.829 --> 00:31:19.410
things like that. And so this, uh, of course

476
00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:24.920
results in overproduction of credentialed individuals. So elite over

477
00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.400
production has two aspects, too many wealth holders and

478
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.160
too many credential holders, right? And they both have

479
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.890
the same, uh, problems because we have too many,

480
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.900
um, elites, and this is the really explosive combination.

481
00:31:38.959 --> 00:31:43.819
It's, um, having too many, um, uh, overproduced, uh.

482
00:31:44.074 --> 00:31:49.165
ELITE aspirants who are, uh, well organized, right, and,

483
00:31:49.275 --> 00:31:54.175
um, and, um, mass, uh, mass, um, mobilization potential

484
00:31:54.175 --> 00:31:57.344
which, uh, provides the raw force, all right, and

485
00:31:57.344 --> 00:32:01.734
gets organized and channeled by counter elites. That's, uh,

486
00:32:01.854 --> 00:32:06.824
that's the worst combination resulting in, um, oftentimes, uh,

487
00:32:06.834 --> 00:32:11.354
state collapse or, uh, civil wars and, um, mm,

488
00:32:11.594 --> 00:32:13.194
and or revolutions.

489
00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:16.869
OK, so let me ask you then, uh, in

490
00:32:16.869 --> 00:32:21.489
the early 2010s, as you said, you predicted, uh,

491
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:25.709
based on what you've just mentioned, uh, that there

492
00:32:25.709 --> 00:32:30.270
would be worldwide social unrest in the 2020s. Looking

493
00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.989
at the world right now as it is right

494
00:32:32.989 --> 00:32:36.729
now, do you think that your hypothesis has been

495
00:32:36.729 --> 00:32:40.290
validated and in your terms or not?

496
00:32:41.319 --> 00:32:44.439
Um, I actually didn't say about anything worldwide. I

497
00:32:44.439 --> 00:32:48.979
was focusing, uh, on, uh, North America, uh, and,

498
00:32:49.189 --> 00:32:53.140
and, and Western Europe. And also, uh, Western Europe

499
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.239
was at the time, um, behind the United States.

500
00:32:56.339 --> 00:33:00.540
You can see this quite clearly that by looking

501
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.119
at when the inequality is not a driving force

502
00:33:04.119 --> 00:33:07.900
in our theory, inequality, but inequality is a good

503
00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:13.400
indicator, right? So that between the over overproduction and,

504
00:33:13.739 --> 00:33:18.579
uh, immiseration. Is, uh, uh, yeah, is recorded by

505
00:33:18.579 --> 00:33:23.380
having, uh, by observing larger uh economic inequality, so

506
00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:27.060
we can see that inequality started growing first in

507
00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.780
the United States, um, and then at, uh, 1020

508
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.260
year lag time, uh, we see the same processes

509
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:38.189
taking over, um, in Western Europe or, you know,

510
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:42.180
or Japan, and so they are behind the United

511
00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.375
States, right, and other countries. It's like China for

512
00:33:45.375 --> 00:33:48.834
example or Russia, they are actually, they actually have

513
00:33:48.834 --> 00:33:52.125
their own, um, uh, dynamics and they are, they

514
00:33:52.125 --> 00:33:56.125
are not part of this, uh, this prediction, right?

515
00:33:56.405 --> 00:34:00.444
And so, yeah, but yes, um, obviously, um, my,

516
00:34:00.525 --> 00:34:03.005
uh, the whole point of publishing this prediction was

517
00:34:03.005 --> 00:34:06.125
not to predict the future, which is, uh, essentially

518
00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:08.685
possible, but this is called scientific prediction. How do

519
00:34:08.685 --> 00:34:11.875
you know that some theory is better than, uh,

520
00:34:11.885 --> 00:34:15.418
another one. We extract predictions from them and, and

521
00:34:15.418 --> 00:34:17.580
these predictions don't have to be about the future.

522
00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:20.938
They could be about, uh, past, for example, so

523
00:34:20.938 --> 00:34:25.329
you could test theories in. Uh, PAST societies, right?

524
00:34:25.618 --> 00:34:28.018
But, so the, the, but the point is to

525
00:34:28.018 --> 00:34:32.339
see, uh, which theories actually work, uh, better. At

526
00:34:32.339 --> 00:34:35.128
the time when I published my prediction in 2010,

527
00:34:35.498 --> 00:34:38.697
there were rival theories. So for example, uh, Steven

528
00:34:38.697 --> 00:34:43.938
Pinker, um, published, uh, several books and he confident,

529
00:34:44.178 --> 00:34:48.810
confidently predicted that violence would be declining. And violence,

530
00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:52.530
political violence was indeed declining in the years before

531
00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:57.429
2010, but, uh, structural demographic theory, theory that, um,

532
00:34:57.649 --> 00:35:01.179
uh, that we work upon was tracing the deep

533
00:35:01.179 --> 00:35:05.010
forces in societies, all right, and those forces have

534
00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:09.459
been actually these pressures, uh, were developing for the

535
00:35:09.459 --> 00:35:12.590
previous, you know, sort. 30 years or so and

536
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:16.379
that's why um we uh were predicting this trend

537
00:35:16.379 --> 00:35:21.110
reversal that the trend to becoming more peaceful is

538
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:24.189
actually would be reversed and um lo and behold

539
00:35:24.189 --> 00:35:28.149
you after 2010, this is precisely what happened.

540
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:34.179
And do you still believe, uh, because we are

541
00:35:34.179 --> 00:35:39.379
now in late 2025, do you believe that, uh,

542
00:35:39.389 --> 00:35:43.429
civil war could happen in the US in the

543
00:35:43.429 --> 00:35:44.850
2020s?

544
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:49.620
In fact, um, I argue, um, and I have

545
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:54.449
argued on my sub-stack that we are in, um,

546
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:58.370
a, uh, true revolution ever since, uh, Donald Trump

547
00:35:59.189 --> 00:36:03.629
became president in January of this year. I, um,

548
00:36:03.709 --> 00:36:06.050
I would say that we are in a true

549
00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:12.070
revolution, um, as, um, Um, as, uh, indicated by

550
00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:16.070
two, developments. First of all, mm, it's a revolution

551
00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:19.530
of the elites. So the mega movement led by,

552
00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:24.790
uh, Trump is a typical, uh, counter-elite movement and

553
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:27.719
so there was a concerted and unlike this first,

554
00:36:27.739 --> 00:36:34.360
mm, uh, term back in 2016, 2020. Now there

555
00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:39.030
was uh a true attempt to replace the, uh,

556
00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:43.090
the ruling class, the previous ruling class, and, um,

557
00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:46.959
replace them with the, uh, with MAGA personnel, all

558
00:36:46.959 --> 00:36:51.459
right, so that's, that's one criterion. The second one

559
00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:54.399
is that it, it's a it's an attempt at

560
00:36:54.399 --> 00:36:59.050
transformative revolution. So it attempts to transform the American

561
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:02.449
society in a variety of ways. So, for example,

562
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:06.610
the abolition of DEI, um, wokeness and so on,

563
00:37:06.689 --> 00:37:10.010
that was, that's one aspect of it, uh, but

564
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:12.570
another one, a very obvious one is that An

565
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:15.409
attempt to change the role that the United States

566
00:37:15.409 --> 00:37:21.530
plays on the international arena. Essentially Trump is dismantling

567
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:26.979
the American empire, right? So that's a huge, um,

568
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:32.050
transformation. So far, uh, thankfully this has been relatively,

569
00:37:32.399 --> 00:37:37.110
uh, non-violent, um, revolution, so elites that, you know,

570
00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.909
uh, the former elites that don't get. Their heads

571
00:37:40.909 --> 00:37:45.750
cut off with guillotines, right? But rather fired, all

572
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:49.469
right, but, uh, uh, and that's actually, uh, good,

573
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:52.629
but there, there is, uh, uh, definitely a high

574
00:37:52.629 --> 00:37:57.419
potential of uh violence uh spiraling out of, uh,

575
00:37:57.429 --> 00:38:02.929
control, so that, that, um, possibility, uh, is non-zero,

576
00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.510
that's, uh, that's for sure.

577
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:11.939
Um, LOOKING at, uh, a potential examples of, uh,

578
00:38:11.949 --> 00:38:17.510
nonviolent ends to elite overproduction, uh, I mean, first

579
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.370
of all, could, could you give us an histor

580
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.409
a historical example of that, and do you think

581
00:38:24.229 --> 00:38:29.270
that, uh, there's still space and opportunity for us

582
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:32.750
to do the same in the current context?

583
00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:38.030
So the question is, um, um, how inevitable is,

584
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:41.889
uh, serious, uh, violence, right? Is that, if I

585
00:38:41.889 --> 00:38:42.060
understand,

586
00:38:43.139 --> 00:38:44.949
yeah, yeah, yes, basically, yes.

587
00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.370
Yeah, so that's, um, um, uh, go, uh, go

588
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:53.469
back to the previous wave, of, uh, such, uh,

589
00:38:53.479 --> 00:38:57.530
political, uh, disintegration which is, as I mentioned, the

590
00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:01.459
age of revolutions, especially if you look at, uh,

591
00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:07.844
1748 and, uh, the, the succeeding years. This was,

592
00:39:07.854 --> 00:39:12.175
um, uh, this middle of the 19th century. There

593
00:39:12.175 --> 00:39:16.695
were revolutions and civil wars, uh, worldwide. The famous

594
00:39:16.695 --> 00:39:21.054
revolutions of 1748 that affected most of Europe, but

595
00:39:21.054 --> 00:39:23.975
also if you think about it just shortly following

596
00:39:23.975 --> 00:39:26.114
them, there was a civil war in the United

597
00:39:26.114 --> 00:39:30.449
States 1861. And there was a huge um uh

598
00:39:30.459 --> 00:39:34.750
uh uh uh civil war in China known as

599
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:39.229
the mm uh Taiping Rebellion which resulted in the

600
00:39:39.229 --> 00:39:43.419
most, uh, you know, destructive civil war. Uh, EVER,

601
00:39:43.679 --> 00:39:46.800
um, the number of people killed was somewhere between

602
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.040
20 and 50 million people. So, so, uh, so

603
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.949
this was a, uh, a really worldwide, uh, wave

604
00:39:54.949 --> 00:39:58.840
of revolutions. However, some societies escaped it. So for

605
00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:03.639
example, um, the British Empire was under huge, mm,

606
00:40:03.649 --> 00:40:06.820
uh, pressure, and there was at the micro, uh,

607
00:40:06.879 --> 00:40:10.669
uh, at the micro, mm. Uh, LEVEL. There were

608
00:40:10.669 --> 00:40:16.110
lots of, um, uh, of, um, instability events such

609
00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:20.260
as riots and, uh, You know, some massacres and

610
00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:24.399
things like that, but it never, uh, escalated into

611
00:40:24.399 --> 00:40:28.500
a full-blown civil war or revolution, so the British

612
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.100
Empire managed to solve that problem. And another example

613
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.100
is Russian Empire, Russian Empire also was under huge,

614
00:40:35.419 --> 00:40:39.409
uh, pressure, but, um, both, um, British Empire, Russian

615
00:40:39.409 --> 00:40:43.360
Empire managed to adopt a series of reforms. All

616
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:48.040
right, very deep reforms in um UK that resulted

617
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:53.219
in um uh democratizing, giving, um, um, common people,

618
00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.709
um, voting rights and also abolishing some of the

619
00:40:57.709 --> 00:41:01.840
laws which uh resulted in huge. LIKE the Koran

620
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.969
laws in Russia, it was the period called the

621
00:41:04.969 --> 00:41:10.800
great reforms really uh changed the nature of society.

622
00:41:11.129 --> 00:41:14.629
Now, of course, this was temporary in, in Russia.

623
00:41:14.979 --> 00:41:17.290
Russia managed to solve problems for, for about 50

624
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:21.290
years and then it still uh went into the

625
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:24.719
revolutions in the early 20th century. And the British

626
00:41:24.719 --> 00:41:29.399
Empire also eventually collapsed, uh, by 1960s, uh, well,

627
00:41:29.689 --> 00:41:33.449
starting with India, um, becoming independent and so on

628
00:41:33.449 --> 00:41:36.010
and so forth. So any of, any of such

629
00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:38.929
solutions are always temporary because then, you know, you

630
00:41:38.929 --> 00:41:42.969
have to deal with, um, rising unrest again. However,

631
00:41:43.169 --> 00:41:46.889
still, Um, that we see that, uh, it is

632
00:41:46.889 --> 00:41:50.649
possible to avoid, um, really bloody revolution, and I,

633
00:41:50.689 --> 00:41:54.629
and, um, I hope that we, uh, humanity is

634
00:41:54.969 --> 00:41:57.969
collectively learning. Uh, WHAT do I mean by that?

635
00:41:58.239 --> 00:42:03.560
Well, we are accumulating institutions. Um, AND the technologies

636
00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:09.580
that, uh, decrease the probability of violent rupture. So,

637
00:42:09.739 --> 00:42:13.620
uh, the spread of democratic, um, uh, norms, for

638
00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.739
example, in the last, um, you know, a couple

639
00:42:16.739 --> 00:42:21.419
100 years or, and also increasing, uh, tech technologies

640
00:42:21.419 --> 00:42:25.419
which actually make us more, uh, Uh, you know,

641
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.820
wealthy, more affluent, right? Uh, SO, uh, so all

642
00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.739
of that, uh, uh, is working to help us,

643
00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.500
mm, avoid the wars. So, so my hope is

644
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:41.320
that, uh, eventually humanity will work. Some of this,

645
00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:46.540
um, um, wages of instability, um, actually are not

646
00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:51.159
necessarily bad. Because, uh, the societies need to renew

647
00:42:51.159 --> 00:42:53.729
themselves. They, we get, uh, too set in our

648
00:42:53.729 --> 00:42:57.209
ways of needs become too selfish and so they,

649
00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:00.479
some kind of revolution of elites is necessary, but

650
00:43:00.479 --> 00:43:03.479
my hope is that we will be able to

651
00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:08.050
do it in, uh, uh, non-violent ways. In fact,

652
00:43:08.209 --> 00:43:13.330
uh, the initial promise of, uh, democracy was that

653
00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:18.104
it would allow elite. Um, A replacement in peaceful

654
00:43:18.104 --> 00:43:22.504
ways. Unfortunately, so far it has not, uh, really

655
00:43:22.504 --> 00:43:26.185
worked that well, all right. So we just need

656
00:43:26.185 --> 00:43:29.475
to evolve more to be able to, uh, to

657
00:43:29.475 --> 00:43:34.435
do, uh, to solve our, uh, problems in non-violent

658
00:43:34.435 --> 00:43:34.455
ways.

659
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.000
Uh, DO you think we still have time for

660
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.899
just one more question, please?

661
00:43:41.239 --> 00:43:43.000
Yeah, one last question. Mhm. Oh,

662
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.080
OK, so one last question then. Uh, DO you

663
00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:51.199
think that, uh, looking back at what was done

664
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.929
in the US, in the UK, and elsewhere in

665
00:43:54.929 --> 00:44:00.199
the 1950s, 1960s, and up until around the mid-1970s

666
00:44:00.479 --> 00:44:05.060
where there was lots of economic reduction. Distribution and

667
00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:09.139
uh there was higher upward social mobility. Do you

668
00:44:09.139 --> 00:44:12.459
think that uh there's space for us to go

669
00:44:12.459 --> 00:44:18.639
back to some of those solutions to uh improve

670
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:22.860
uh or to decrease social unrest and solve some

671
00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:25.679
of the problems we are dealing with today?

672
00:44:26.709 --> 00:44:30.870
Essentially, um, uh, uh, what happens because this process

673
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:34.750
is cycling, uh, we see this happens after the

674
00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:39.270
age of revolutions, um, and resulting in a really

675
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:44.510
unprecedented, uh, prosperity in the United States and, and

676
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:48.310
much of the world. In fact, um, And we

677
00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:51.229
see that happening after the 17th century crisis, after

678
00:44:51.229 --> 00:44:54.510
the, uh, great, the late medieval crisis, there was,

679
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:58.250
uh, they were followed by a great expansion of,

680
00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:02.870
uh, human, uh, well-being. We can document it and

681
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:06.820
so, so yes, um, this is what, uh, uh,

682
00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:09.649
this, in fact this is a condition in, um,

683
00:45:09.709 --> 00:45:14.020
the expansion, uh, increasing well-being results when, um, the

684
00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:18.100
wealth pump gets shut down. Or even reversed, so,

685
00:45:18.439 --> 00:45:22.860
so that the elites actually uh lose ground, become

686
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.439
fewer of them. For example, in the United States

687
00:45:26.439 --> 00:45:30.139
um between the new GO and 1980, the numbers

688
00:45:30.139 --> 00:45:35.219
of millionaires declined and their wealth has also declined

689
00:45:35.459 --> 00:45:38.659
and that resulted in much better, a much more

690
00:45:38.659 --> 00:45:41.844
balanced, uh, society. So this is what we will

691
00:45:41.844 --> 00:45:45.905
have to do, uh, in order to mitigate, uh,

692
00:45:45.925 --> 00:45:50.195
ourselves through the, uh, crisis that we are experiencing

693
00:45:50.524 --> 00:45:54.554
right now, all right. So, um, so yes, um,

694
00:45:54.564 --> 00:45:58.185
uh, we, humanity has done this before and so,

695
00:45:58.725 --> 00:46:00.685
um, we will do it again. We just have

696
00:46:00.685 --> 00:46:03.945
to be careful not to self-immolate in the nuclear

697
00:46:03.945 --> 00:46:08.689
Armageddon. But, um, but in principle, um, it is

698
00:46:08.689 --> 00:46:11.469
solvable. The only thing is that the combination of,

699
00:46:11.489 --> 00:46:16.770
um, reforms and, uh, policies is, is likely to

700
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:20.270
be different from that, for example, which was used

701
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:23.850
in the United States during the Progressive era and

702
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:27.189
the New Deal because our societies have changed. All

703
00:46:27.189 --> 00:46:29.030
right, and that means that we will have to

704
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:31.899
use a diff and also our challenges are diff

705
00:46:31.899 --> 00:46:35.310
uh different because for example we have now artificial

706
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:40.449
intelligence um or um replacing, uh, jobs, um, it,

707
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:43.189
it's a challenge that which you have to deal

708
00:46:43.189 --> 00:46:45.870
with. This is a novel, uh, challenge and it

709
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:49.459
will require, uh, its own, um, you know, uh,

710
00:46:49.469 --> 00:46:52.209
policy changes to address. Mhm.

711
00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:56.239
OK, great. So Doctor Turchin, I will be leaving

712
00:46:56.239 --> 00:46:59.360
links to your latest book and also to End

713
00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.840
Times and your other books in the description of

714
00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.360
the interview. Uh, WOULD you like just to tell

715
00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.360
us where people can find you and the rest

716
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.100
of your work on the internet?

717
00:47:10.149 --> 00:47:13.120
Sure. Well, first of all, I have a website.

718
00:47:13.239 --> 00:47:18.479
It's simply Peter Turchin uh without any spaces.com. All

719
00:47:18.479 --> 00:47:21.959
right, um, and then I started, uh, earlier this

720
00:47:21.959 --> 00:47:25.760
year, I started a substack. It's also called Peter

721
00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:31.189
Turchin.substack. uh WHATEVER com I think. Uh, AND so

722
00:47:31.439 --> 00:47:34.989

723
00:47:34.989 --> 00:47:39.169

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.860
weekend I publish a substantial pieces and then often

728
00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.580
in midweek, like today, for example, I, I had,

729
00:47:56.590 --> 00:48:01.280
uh, a smaller, um, you know, uh, post about

730
