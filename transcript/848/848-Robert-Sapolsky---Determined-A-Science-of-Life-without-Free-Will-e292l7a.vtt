Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the Center.

1
00:00:03.599 --> 00:00:05.440
I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs.

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.050
And today I'm joined for a third time by Doctor Robert

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:09.960
Sapolsky.

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.640
And today we're talking about his latest book,

5
00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:16.899
Determined The Science of Life without free will.

6
00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:20.979
And I'm also leaving the links to our first two interviews

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.030
in the description of this one. So Doctor

8
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.360
Sapolsky, welcome back to the show. It's always a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.899
Well, likewise seeing you again and uh

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.529
glad we're on the other side of the pandemic. A pleasure to be here.

11
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.840
OK.

12
00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:39.680
So in our first two interviews,

13
00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:46.000
we talked a lot about the science of human behavior and this time focusing on

14
00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:49.819
questions surrounding free will and determinism.

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.080
Are there specific aspects of the science of human behavior that you would

16
00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.900
deem to be the most important here when considering these types of questions?

17
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.150
Well, um just as a preamble, my, my

18
00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:09.260
song and dance is that

19
00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:13.230
there's no free will. We have none whatsoever.

20
00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:16.339
Um which puts me fairly

21
00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:22.169
far on the extreme of the continuum of people thinking about this. Um

22
00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:25.510
but that we have no free will at all. And

23
00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:31.730
this is relevant to everything about how we became, who became uh individually,

24
00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:34.120
all of that, why you just did what you did.

25
00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.300
Um But

26
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.639
in terms of where that's most important,

27
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.760
um

28
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.720
just to focus on the very narrow area, which

29
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.239
is anything but narrow.

30
00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:51.849
Um The biggest implication of that is none of us are entitled

31
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.809
to anything.

32
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.819
None of us have earned

33
00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.260
to be treated any differently than anyone else.

34
00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:02.160
Of course, we may need to be treated differently.

35
00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:05.959
Uh Like if you're uncontrollably violent,

36
00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:08.119
people have to be protected from you.

37
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.720
Um If you have extremely good motor skills through no,

38
00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.259
you know, achievement of your own,

39
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.770
uh Maybe you're a candidate to be a good neurosurgeon,

40
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.710
but none of us have earned the right to have our needs

41
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.660
be considered more important than anyone else's.

42
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.729
And so, uh it's one thing to try to answer the question of free will.

43
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.630
I mean, if it exists or not, but another thing is why and when people believe

44
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.520
in free will, I mean, are there specific

45
00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:53.550
cues that people pay attention to specific variables that play a role in how much

46
00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:57.089
free will people attribute to themselves or to

47
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.389
someone else when evaluating a particular action?

48
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.289
Well,

49
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.960
you're right and people almost universally

50
00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:12.369
uh believe that they are the agents of their action.

51
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.119
Um Like 90% of philosophers fall into a camp uh

52
00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.559
called compatible list views of free will.

53
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.320
These are people, they're not saying there's magic,

54
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.179
they're not taking theological stances, whatever they say.

55
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.839
Yeah, the world is made of atoms,

56
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.279
we're made of cells like we believe in all that stuff.

57
00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.940
Yet,

58
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.320
somehow

59
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.919
here's how free will still like pops out of your brain

60
00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:42.500
and do a lot of hand waving at that point.

61
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.059
Um So it's incredibly common view.

62
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.259
Um Like

63
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.500
all of our other features of our beliefs and temperaments,

64
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.279
um It's kind of context dependent

65
00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:54.889
people really,

66
00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:57.580
really are more likely to believe in free will

67
00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:01.369
if someone's complimenting them and saying good job,

68
00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:02.770
they're really looking

69
00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:09.410
like to like, likely to under circumstances where things have come up short. I mean,

70
00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:13.990
there's, there's this classic dichotomy and sort of us, them thinking

71
00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:18.589
that with them, when thems do something awful,

72
00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.829
it's constitutional.

73
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.649
That's what they're like. They've always been like, they'll always be like,

74
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.100
and when one of us does something awful, it's situational.

75
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.890
Yeah, you have to understand they were under a lot of stress,

76
00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:36.809
there were financial pressures, they had just been whatever, um,

77
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.250
as to how stable our us

78
00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:41.559
this is

79
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.100
and we're often being pretty nasty when we're attributing

80
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.920
unchangeable

81
00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:49.309
them ness

82
00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:50.339
to them.

83
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.950
Um, in that regard, we're very,

84
00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:57.589
very malleable when it comes to how characteristically free

85
00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:03.040
we are. When things are going well, people believe in free will when

86
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.570
things are not,

87
00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:08.709
there's a tendency to go in the other direction but not in a globalized.

88
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.510
There's no free will whatsoever. Here's the extenuating circumstance

89
00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:19.529
that screwed me up just now that kept me from being the wondrous free,

90
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.359
consistent person that I am.

91
00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:26.390
Yeah, something came up. But overall, overall we are the captains of our fate.

92
00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.679
Mhm

93
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:36.019
But uh let me ask you about one criticism that perhaps many people,

94
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.950
scientists particularly would have

95
00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:43.489
of uh your position. So we have a, a

96
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.690
good understanding or at least to some extent of the science of human behavior,

97
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.820
the factors that play a role there

98
00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:55.760
uh from genetics to the environment and culture.

99
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.890
But uh I mean, there's still lots and lots of details that we are missing.

100
00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:05.880
And it's really hard to be able to

101
00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:10.640
predict with a very high level of accuracy how

102
00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:15.619
people will behave in any particular point in time.

103
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.980
So,

104
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.799
the fact that there's

105
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.769
still fairly low predictability,

106
00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:25.359
do you think that that's an argument against your position?

107
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.019
Um No, and that's, that's like a fantastic counter

108
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.040
ment to bring up because

109
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.880
it's very essential. It, it obviously is very essential. Um

110
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.500
Like I, I have sort of a hobby by now that I

111
00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:45.730
uh help uh public defenders uh who

112
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:49.570
are lawyers defending poor people who can't afford

113
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.459
uh their own lawyers in murder cases for people who have a history of traumatic

114
00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:01.049
childhoods, uh concussive head trauma and such teaching juries about the brain.

115
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.739
And what always happens is I get to do a two hour

116
00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:06.019
presentation

117
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.989
and then the prosecuting attorney gets to cross examine me

118
00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:13.579
and they always nail me on exactly these lines.

119
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:16.859
So, are you saying every single person

120
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:20.619
with this type of brain damage would do what this guy did?

121
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.429
I'd say, no,

122
00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:25.339
we can't say that. Could you have predicted this guy?

123
00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:27.250
No, we can't.

124
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:27.940
Um

125
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.619
Part of it, a

126
00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:33.399
fundamentally deep response is

127
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.809
um

128
00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:36.359
when you look at

129
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.309
uh

130
00:07:37.739 --> 00:07:41.570
chaotic systems, systems that run on chaotic system,

131
00:07:41.679 --> 00:07:47.160
like us, our brains, our cells, our molecules, our societies,

132
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.029
um

133
00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:48.160
a

134
00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:52.390
critical thing about them is they are unpredictable.

135
00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:58.149
They're still deterministic and lots of people mistake sort of chaotic

136
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.290
and the unpredictability of it as proof

137
00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:04.500
that somehow we could transcend our molecules.

138
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.429
But on that level, in this very fundamental way, um

139
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.179
systems that are entirely deterministic

140
00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:17.480
can nonetheless be completely unpredictable. A much more mundane answer is,

141
00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:20.619
well, yeah, we're still finding out stuff.

142
00:08:20.769 --> 00:08:26.700
And when you look at our knowledge about sort of the biology of human behavior,

143
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.579
like 99% of what we've learned about it has been in the last century,

144
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:39.580
75% has been in the last 50 years, 51% has been in the last decade,

145
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:44.650
25% of it has been since like we started this broadcast or whatever,

146
00:08:44.659 --> 00:08:47.820
like the rate at which knowledge is pouring in

147
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.419
is incredibly fast. So there, there's this sort of indirect cheating

148
00:08:52.619 --> 00:08:55.599
strategy that one can then say, which is

149
00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.059
OK if we're all going to accept that tonight. At midnight. That's it.

150
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.429
Science is done.

151
00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:04.799
We're never gonna find out anything new again.

152
00:09:04.809 --> 00:09:06.599
This is everything we know at this point.

153
00:09:06.869 --> 00:09:07.700
The answer is, yeah.

154
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.739
Nonetheless, we can't predict a whole lot about human behavior.

155
00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:16.179
Um But everything we know about the exponential increase in knowledge

156
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.299
is over and over and over,

157
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.210
we're gonna continue this pattern of saying,

158
00:09:21.349 --> 00:09:22.239
oh,

159
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.080
I had no idea. Biology had something to do with that.

160
00:09:26.729 --> 00:09:27.580
And

161
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.340
like you have a choice at this point,

162
00:09:30.349 --> 00:09:33.950
do you wanna be on the cutting edge of viewing that

163
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.409
we are nothing more or less than biological machines or do you

164
00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:41.539
wanna be like the history of science example in a century of

165
00:09:41.549 --> 00:09:45.309
just the primitiveness of what people still believed at the time.

166
00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:51.789
And so one of the things uh also that people bring

167
00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:56.960
to the table in discussions surrounding free will and that people use

168
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.690
in law and in the courtroom has to do with intent.

169
00:10:02.219 --> 00:10:02.969
So,

170
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.820
from a scientific perspective,

171
00:10:06.309 --> 00:10:10.119
what is intent exactly? And what do we know about it?

172
00:10:10.349 --> 00:10:11.690
And do you think that

173
00:10:11.989 --> 00:10:18.289
its intent in any way would make for a good case for

174
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.190
free will in any way?

175
00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:22.530
Yes. Let me, let me just

176
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:30.849
be really uh sort of over the top here. Um As a scientist, my definition of intent

177
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.030
as a subject to consider when thinking about free will.

178
00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:40.380
Um intent can be defined as boring as hell and totally irrelevant.

179
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.440
Um

180
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.049
OK. Why is that? Um the entire legal system, as you said, runs on that.

181
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:51.619
Um, when somebody did something awful, did they intend to do it?

182
00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:55.340
And did they know that they had alternative options?

183
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.900
Um And did they understand what the consequences were going to be?

184
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.750
Um And if the answer to all of that is? Yeah, lock them up.

185
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.049
They intended to do what they did

186
00:11:06.309 --> 00:11:09.479
and they knew there were alternatives. Um

187
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.570
And in sort of the neuroscience

188
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.190
world of free will where intent comes in is the most

189
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.580
influential crazy making experiment of all time in the field.

190
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:26.150
This is something that came in the early 19 eighties by a man named Benjamin Lit.

191
00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:31.010
And you read any paper about the biology of free will

192
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.210
and like the person is almost required by law to mention lit

193
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.419
by the second paragraph, these were these amazing studies. He took people

194
00:11:39.809 --> 00:11:43.140
and wired them up with sort of electroencephalograms,

195
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.400
eegs to record brain activity in different areas.

196
00:11:46.409 --> 00:11:50.070
This was like Neanderthal era technology at the time,

197
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.739
you couldn't do brain imaging then.

198
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.239
But this very simple approach. Um

199
00:11:54.669 --> 00:11:56.830
he said to people,

200
00:11:56.989 --> 00:11:59.219
OK, whenever you want,

201
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.630
press this button

202
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.010
and they had things to tell when the pressing process actually

203
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:10.190
started by seeing when muscles started constricting in his arm.

204
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.330
And they could see what was happening in the motor cortex,

205
00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:18.489
the part of the brain telling those muscles and they could see the parts of the brain

206
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.309
that would tell another part to tell another part to tell the motor cortex to do that.

207
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:28.239
And the earth shattering finding that he came up with was all

208
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.239
of this playing out in about a half second or so.

209
00:12:31.549 --> 00:12:36.940
You could tell when the brain had decided it was time to press the button

210
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:42.500
because before the person was conscious of their intention to do it

211
00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:46.729
by about 200 milliseconds, 2/10 of a second.

212
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.130
And oh my God,

213
00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:54.929
your brain has decided before you were conscious of intending to do this.

214
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.049
And

215
00:12:56.369 --> 00:13:00.770
everyone like went crazy over this because this is just proven

216
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:05.580
there was no free will until like people started arguing about.

217
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.059
When do you become aware of intention?

218
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.239
And is that different from when you intend to do something? And,

219
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.960
and you know, all this philosophical stuff of,

220
00:13:15.969 --> 00:13:19.119
is there a difference between intending to do something

221
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.299
and intending to stop yourself from doing something?

222
00:13:22.309 --> 00:13:25.380
The difference between free will and free won't?

223
00:13:25.429 --> 00:13:29.599
And they're still fighting about this. This is 40 years later

224
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:35.190
for a scientist, there was like a paper a couple of years ago entitled like Livid.

225
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.590
Had no idea what he was talking about or,

226
00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:41.109
or something slightly more like formal than that

227
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.030
for people to still be telling you that your

228
00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:46.630
science was wrong 40 years after you did it,

229
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.150
this is like immortality for a scientist.

230
00:13:49.219 --> 00:13:55.070
They're still fighting about what this finding means. Does your brain

231
00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:00.059
know that you're intending to do something before you're consciously aware of it.

232
00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:06.820
And I scream every time I see yet another one of these studies because as I said,

233
00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.799
it's boring as hell and totally irrelevant.

234
00:14:09.809 --> 00:14:13.150
And in a courtroom as well, did this person intend to do that?

235
00:14:13.309 --> 00:14:19.010
Because none of it asks the only relevant question there is. Oh, yeah.

236
00:14:19.229 --> 00:14:21.719
Where did that intent come from?

237
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.919
Where did it come from in the first place?

238
00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:27.849
Because to answer the question of,

239
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.219
did the brain

240
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:34.109
have intent before you did that's playing out in 2/10 of a second

241
00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:37.729
when you're asking, where did that intent come from?

242
00:14:38.429 --> 00:14:42.849
What does that have to do with what was going on in your brain one second ago?

243
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:47.169
And what was happening in the environment one minute ago?

244
00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:50.950
And what hormone levels were like one day ago and

245
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.770
how traumatic or stimulating the previous one year had been

246
00:14:54.929 --> 00:14:57.609
and what your adolescence was like in your childhood

247
00:14:57.619 --> 00:15:00.210
and your fetal life and your genes and the

248
00:15:00.219 --> 00:15:04.609
culture your ancestors invented because that influenced how your

249
00:15:04.619 --> 00:15:07.330
mother was raising you within a minute of birth.

250
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.369
Where did that intent come from?

251
00:15:09.859 --> 00:15:14.059
And the metaphor I use in the book is deciding whether or not

252
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:19.080
there's free will based on what's going on in that last half second

253
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.950
and only knowing what the intent was is like deciding whether you like

254
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.700
a movie or not by just having seen the final three minutes of it

255
00:15:27.919 --> 00:15:30.479
because you've missed everything.

256
00:15:30.849 --> 00:15:35.880
It doesn't matter if the person intended to or not. Where did that intent come from?

257
00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.570
And that's

258
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.400
where the legal system

259
00:15:40.299 --> 00:15:43.320
falls apart in terms of their thinking about,

260
00:15:43.619 --> 00:15:45.619
you know, punishment and blame.

261
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:49.219
And that's where most thinking about whether or

262
00:15:49.229 --> 00:15:51.919
not there's free will falls apart because everybody is

263
00:15:51.929 --> 00:15:54.580
just interested in their brain imaging studies telling

264
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.109
you what happened in the last three milliseconds.

265
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.080
And that tells you nothing

266
00:15:59.349 --> 00:16:03.359
because something about what happened to you this morning

267
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.049
had something to do with it.

268
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.809
Something about your fetal life had something to do with it.

269
00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:14.289
Something about the culture, your answer came up with 500 years ago,

270
00:16:14.299 --> 00:16:15.700
had something to do with it.

271
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.900
And when you look at all those pieces from one second

272
00:16:18.909 --> 00:16:22.690
before to millennia before and you put all those pieces together,

273
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.450
there's not a damn inch in there to shoehorn in an

274
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:31.090
ocean of free will operating independent of all of that stuff.

275
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:32.369
Mhm

276
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.489
So when it comes to behavioral science,

277
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:43.270
we always hear about nature versus nurture genes, the environment

278
00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:48.919
does when it comes to free will specifically, does it matter at all

279
00:16:49.219 --> 00:16:50.650
if uh

280
00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:57.580
we're talking about uh for example, biological factors or environmental factors?

281
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.929
I mean,

282
00:16:58.349 --> 00:17:01.650
do we have any more control, for example,

283
00:17:01.659 --> 00:17:06.290
over our environment and how it affects our behavior

284
00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:09.770
than we have over our gyms,

285
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:10.608
-- for
-- example,

286
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.199
zero in both cases in the fundamental ways.

287
00:17:16.209 --> 00:17:20.260
I mean, what one is obliged to do in my business at this point is saying,

288
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:25.689
nature and nurture always interact and you can't pull them apart and asking which

289
00:17:25.699 --> 00:17:31.819
contributes more is like what's contributing more to the area of this rectangle,

290
00:17:31.829 --> 00:17:35.079
the length or the width they always interact and

291
00:17:35.239 --> 00:17:38.780
that sort of thing um within this realm. Um

292
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:46.369
The summary I would get at is we are nothing more or less than the sum of our biology,

293
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:52.459
which we had no control over and its interactions with the sum of our environment

294
00:17:52.599 --> 00:17:54.790
over which we had no control over.

295
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.979
And they're completely inseparable.

296
00:17:57.989 --> 00:18:00.750
I mean, it's the simplest example of like, oh,

297
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.400
how important was environment in this sort

298
00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.729
of case and its interaction with biology?

299
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:12.589
Wow, what explains the fact that I'm sitting here right now and have

300
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.339
a occupation that carries some prestige and westernized culture

301
00:18:16.589 --> 00:18:19.300
and all of that, what did environment have to do with it?

302
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.310
Starting with environment prenatal environment.

303
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:27.869
The fact that my, my mother was not suffering from malaria or

304
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.339
Chagas disease or like any such thing and wasn't protein

305
00:18:32.349 --> 00:18:36.189
starved because she was a nomadic pastoralist in the Sahel,

306
00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:37.099
in Africa.

307
00:18:37.109 --> 00:18:37.560
And like,

308
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:43.219
oh, like we're talking like at that level already. That's like what we're talking

309
00:18:43.699 --> 00:18:45.699
already at that level.

310
00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:53.180
That's part of the brain that you wound up being uh handed to you here in adulthood.

311
00:18:53.229 --> 00:18:57.660
Um All of that stuff matters and it's inseparable.

312
00:18:58.859 --> 00:18:59.339
Mhm

313
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.719
One very interesting thing that you talk about in the

314
00:19:02.729 --> 00:19:08.229
book is the Behavioral Science slash Biology of luck.

315
00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:10.400
What is that about

316
00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:12.199
it? It's, that's

317
00:19:12.489 --> 00:19:14.550
ultimately everything,

318
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.609
everything we're talking about here.

319
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:18.530
Um

320
00:19:19.599 --> 00:19:21.369
Another way of saying, oh,

321
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.839
the sum of our biology and this interaction with the sum of our

322
00:19:23.849 --> 00:19:28.420
environment is we are nothing more or less than the outcome of our luck

323
00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.569
and anyone who claims

324
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.589
otherwise that

325
00:19:34.099 --> 00:19:40.449
they earned their good luck or that it makes sense to punish them for their bad luck.

326
00:19:40.589 --> 00:19:41.359
Um

327
00:19:41.709 --> 00:19:42.839
All we are

328
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:49.109
is the outcome of biology, interacting with environment in the context of luck.

329
00:19:49.119 --> 00:19:54.180
And there's this whole thing like child development, um try to make sense of

330
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.619
who turns out to be like the the

331
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.770
violent adults and the drug addicts and all the,

332
00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:07.780
all the bad outcomes and like no surprise childhood has a huge amount to do with it

333
00:20:08.319 --> 00:20:11.140
and it's been formalized into this thing.

334
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:15.060
Um At least in sort of uh United States called your

335
00:20:15.069 --> 00:20:21.839
ace score A ce the sum of your adverse childhood experiences.

336
00:20:22.089 --> 00:20:29.099
And there's this ace like questionnaire scoring system where you can get from 0 to 10

337
00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:33.520
and zero is you had no adversity 10 is like you

338
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:37.329
had all of the following 10 horrible things happen to you.

339
00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:38.449
Were you

340
00:20:38.979 --> 00:20:41.910
a witness to physical violence

341
00:20:42.069 --> 00:20:44.329
or psychological violence at home?

342
00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:49.839
Were you a victim of physical violence or psychological violence?

343
00:20:49.849 --> 00:20:54.560
Were you a victim of sexual abuse? Were you in a broken family?

344
00:20:54.569 --> 00:20:57.500
Was there a weapon at home when you was there,

345
00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:02.839
a family member who was incarcerated this whole list there going from 0 to 10.

346
00:21:03.099 --> 00:21:07.160
Um, and what you see is for every single step,

347
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:11.040
every point you add to somebody's ace score.

348
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.069
Um, there's about a 35% increased likelihood

349
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.979
that they're going to be involved in violent

350
00:21:17.989 --> 00:21:21.170
antisocial behavior by the time they're adult.

351
00:21:21.319 --> 00:21:22.359
If they're a male,

352
00:21:22.729 --> 00:21:28.229
there's about a 35% increased chance that they're gonna have a teenage pregnancy.

353
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.660
If they're female,

354
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:33.349
about a 35% increased chance of either that they're gonna have

355
00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:37.290
substance abuse and addiction problems every step in the way.

356
00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:40.910
And this is one way of formalizing like this

357
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.770
is the quantified science of shitty luck in childhood.

358
00:21:45.979 --> 00:21:49.670
And it has always struck me that at the same time. Instead of making it

359
00:21:50.199 --> 00:21:53.579
an adverse childhood experience score,

360
00:21:53.589 --> 00:21:58.869
you could make a ridiculously lucky childhood experience score.

361
00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.910
Did your

362
00:22:00.089 --> 00:22:03.599
parent or parents read books to you?

363
00:22:03.849 --> 00:22:09.369
Did you have a stable income? Um Did you never have to worry about food?

364
00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.199
Did you play games and laugh at home? Whatever?

365
00:22:13.209 --> 00:22:15.609
Come up with a score of that and it's gonna tell you forever.

366
00:22:15.689 --> 00:22:16.770
Each step in those,

367
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:22.479
there's a 35% increase that you're gonna be working a prestigious white

368
00:22:22.579 --> 00:22:27.910
collar job someday and have an office and a secretary or who knows

369
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.989
just a different way of explaining the same thing.

370
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.869
Um

371
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.469
Everything that we frame as morality is instead the outcome or of good or bad luck.

372
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:47.209
And we have built a world in which we punish or reward people

373
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.979
over the luck they had nothing to do with.

374
00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.589
Mhm.

375
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:57.290
But, uh, as we go through, uh childhood adolescence,

376
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.859
adulthood and our prefrontal cortices develop,

377
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:08.280
we tend to gain or acquire more self-control, more impulse control.

378
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:15.119
Does that not count at least as a few more degrees of rhythm?

379
00:23:15.739 --> 00:23:16.310
Right.

380
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:21.400
Let's look at the sentence you just said as we get older, don't we acquire

381
00:23:21.719 --> 00:23:26.510
more frontal cortical self control? What does acquire mean?

382
00:23:27.229 --> 00:23:30.650
It means you're lucky enough to be in an environment

383
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.170
that would have taught you that

384
00:23:32.689 --> 00:23:35.660
it means you're lucky enough to have a brain at

385
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:39.130
that point where you could learn from those experiences.

386
00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:43.099
It means that you're lucky enough that the counter examples every day

387
00:23:43.109 --> 00:23:46.170
when you finish school and went outside and there was the,

388
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.170
your gang telling you let's go rob that liquor store.

389
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.810
Um Let's do something impulsive that reinforces

390
00:23:53.819 --> 00:23:56.250
your frontal cortex not working very well.

391
00:23:56.699 --> 00:23:59.729
How many of those were going on at the end of the day?

392
00:23:59.739 --> 00:24:03.969
Do you go home and you're bullied by somebody at home and anything

393
00:24:03.979 --> 00:24:07.939
you heard during the day about like the wonderful path ahead of you?

394
00:24:07.949 --> 00:24:11.170
Thanks to self control goes out the window. Be

395
00:24:11.959 --> 00:24:12.579
Yeah,

396
00:24:13.079 --> 00:24:15.459
we learned. Oh, wow.

397
00:24:15.469 --> 00:24:20.540
Didn't you learn somewhere along the way that self control is a bad thing for you if

398
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.619
you're a fetus and your mother is very

399
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.979
stressed and secreting a lot of stress hormones.

400
00:24:26.989 --> 00:24:28.680
You're going to be born with a

401
00:24:28.689 --> 00:24:32.109
frontal cortex that's already less developed than average

402
00:24:32.214 --> 00:24:32.255
and

403
00:24:32.364 --> 00:24:33.314
newborns.

404
00:24:33.324 --> 00:24:35.655
Meaning 15 years later,

405
00:24:35.665 --> 00:24:39.675
you're getting great lessons in life about the importance of self control.

406
00:24:39.685 --> 00:24:45.415
And by the time you were a damn fetus, you were already less likely than average

407
00:24:45.694 --> 00:24:51.255
to be able to learn those lessons and benefit from them every step along the way.

408
00:24:51.704 --> 00:24:55.244
Where did that intent come from? Where did that learning come from?

409
00:24:55.265 --> 00:24:58.094
Where did the opportunity for that learning come from?

410
00:24:58.489 --> 00:25:00.910
And it's always, you know,

411
00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:05.430
all that stuff that brought you to this moment over which you had no control.

412
00:25:07.219 --> 00:25:12.790
And when it comes to our psychological traits, we know, for example,

413
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:18.680
from disciplines like behavior genetics that there's the role of genes and then the

414
00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.000
shared environment, the non shared environment,

415
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.400
unique experiences we go through.

416
00:25:25.069 --> 00:25:29.030
Isn't there any space at all there for some,

417
00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:36.500
uh I mean, for us to have some sort of be, be able to play some active role

418
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:40.290
in the kind of person that we're going to become?

419
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:42.910
Absolutely.

420
00:25:43.229 --> 00:25:46.819
Um And that's one of the ways in which

421
00:25:47.209 --> 00:25:51.469
uh people should avoid the hysteria of deciding genes,

422
00:25:51.479 --> 00:25:55.109
determine everything that genes are the most interesting things.

423
00:25:55.119 --> 00:25:58.410
If nothing else, you have this whole field of epigenetics,

424
00:25:58.439 --> 00:26:00.469
the ways in which experience

425
00:26:00.829 --> 00:26:01.770
can change

426
00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.969
how readily genes of yours are turned on or off.

427
00:26:04.979 --> 00:26:07.630
For the rest of your life in some cases. OK.

428
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.969
So we're moved away from a genetic deterministic picture for a zillion reasons,

429
00:26:11.979 --> 00:26:14.349
uh both biological and environmental.

430
00:26:14.439 --> 00:26:17.729
Um But you're saying, can't we choose

431
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.719
to take an action

432
00:26:21.109 --> 00:26:24.680
to take a conscious action which will change our destiny?

433
00:26:25.579 --> 00:26:27.119
And the answer is

434
00:26:27.329 --> 00:26:28.800
not in the slightest,

435
00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.550
you look at two people who were given an opportunity

436
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:38.280
and one is this person who every single split in the road,

437
00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:40.949
they always take the wrong direction.

438
00:26:41.069 --> 00:26:46.939
They never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity at everyone. You could have.

439
00:26:46.949 --> 00:26:47.579
They,

440
00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:52.640
they would have given you that job. They were offering you a scholarship.

441
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:57.310
The guy said you didn't have to drive the car when they were going to do the robbery and

442
00:26:57.479 --> 00:27:01.640
oh my God, every time that person makes the wrong choice,

443
00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:06.189
every time they come up with the wrong intent

444
00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:12.849
and where did that come from? And when we seemingly have made a major

445
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.209
decision

446
00:27:14.479 --> 00:27:15.890
on our part

447
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.400
about something in life, are you

448
00:27:19.839 --> 00:27:23.699
going to rob the store? Are you going to study hard?

449
00:27:23.709 --> 00:27:28.699
Are you gonna propose marriage to this person or you? Who knows what? Um

450
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.459
And that feels intent.

451
00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.010
Um

452
00:27:32.599 --> 00:27:35.140
Everything about the biology and this interaction

453
00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.160
with the environment that came before that

454
00:27:37.339 --> 00:27:39.979
is what brought you to that moment.

455
00:27:40.109 --> 00:27:42.880
Like from everything.

456
00:27:43.109 --> 00:27:45.540
Like if you're hungry,

457
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:49.770
you're more likely to commit an antisocial violent act.

458
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:57.170
If somebody smells good to you, their pheromones, you're more likely to find them.

459
00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.010
You claim that they are more vis

460
00:27:59.209 --> 00:28:01.380
visually physically attractive if you,

461
00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:03.119
you know all this stuff, what,

462
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.510
what

463
00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.000
this,

464
00:28:06.239 --> 00:28:09.319
at the split in the road? Do you make the right decision or not?

465
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:11.920
What this taps into is? I think

466
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.569
the most pernicious way in

467
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.000
which people hold on to. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

468
00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:21.979
There's biology and we have brains and all of that and it just made a brain gunk.

469
00:28:21.989 --> 00:28:27.479
Um, but we have free will, we have free will. Is this dichotomy people bring in?

470
00:28:28.359 --> 00:28:29.969
You look at somebody

471
00:28:30.449 --> 00:28:33.729
who's 7 ft four and of course,

472
00:28:33.739 --> 00:28:37.270
they're a great basketball player or you look at somebody

473
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.979
and they have particular ratio of slow twitch to fast

474
00:28:41.989 --> 00:28:45.459
twitch fibers in their leg muscles and of course they

475
00:28:45.469 --> 00:28:48.849
turn out to be a good marathoner or maybe even

476
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:53.900
you understand enough about receptors for this or that neurotransmitter.

477
00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.180
And of course they have a good memory or good. Any of these.

478
00:28:58.189 --> 00:29:02.000
We're pretty good at accepting the biology

479
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:04.630
of what our natural attributes are.

480
00:29:05.339 --> 00:29:09.160
Some people have lovely voices and others don't.

481
00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:11.079
And they're never gonna sing in an opera.

482
00:29:11.089 --> 00:29:16.400
Some people have, yes, there's these natural attributes. OK. Ok. Ok.

483
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:18.949
Science biology has something to do with that.

484
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:25.170
But oh, where free will comes in is what you do with your attributes?

485
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:30.959
Do you squander them? Do you work hard to overcome your limitations?

486
00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:31.589
Do you,

487
00:29:31.599 --> 00:29:33.489
are you one of these people like you go

488
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.209
on youtube and there's unbelievable examples of this,

489
00:29:36.219 --> 00:29:41.560
of like marathoners and like important races where they collapse

490
00:29:41.569 --> 00:29:45.719
53 ft from the finish line and they crawl,

491
00:29:45.729 --> 00:29:47.839
they crawl to the very end.

492
00:29:47.949 --> 00:29:54.439
And you say, oh my God, this is amazing with what they did with what they were given.

493
00:29:54.449 --> 00:29:57.280
Or you find like somebody raised in poverty in a

494
00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:01.199
horrible neighborhood and all of that who somehow winds up

495
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.180
like with their Nobel Prize at the other end,

496
00:30:04.189 --> 00:30:08.010
or somebody who grows up in great wealth and privilege and

497
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.410
they're a junkie by the time they're 20

498
00:30:10.569 --> 00:30:12.109
they've spent half their fortune.

499
00:30:12.469 --> 00:30:13.180
Oh,

500
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.040
your attributes

501
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.319
you have no control over. That's the biology.

502
00:30:17.599 --> 00:30:20.349
What do you do with the attributes?

503
00:30:20.469 --> 00:30:23.010
That's where we have a world of,

504
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.329
oh, what a self

505
00:30:24.449 --> 00:30:26.209
indulgent squander.

506
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:30.640
What an inspiring role model, how they worked to overcome.

507
00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:32.989
There's something in there

508
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:37.050
that we believe that things like your memory

509
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:41.670
or whether you have perfect pitch or things like that are made of biology

510
00:30:42.579 --> 00:30:49.150
and how hard you work and your self control and how indulgent you are and all of that

511
00:30:49.329 --> 00:30:54.209
somehow that's made of other stuff that's not made of biology.

512
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.189
And when you look at it like what happened to you as a fetus

513
00:30:58.489 --> 00:31:02.400
is going to have something to do with the construction of your part of the brain

514
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:06.250
that has something to do with whether it splits in the road,

515
00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.040
you always make the bad decision,

516
00:31:09.199 --> 00:31:12.920
you every step of this is biology as well.

517
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:17.859
Um But there's this very strong emotional pull

518
00:31:18.619 --> 00:31:21.660
to differentiate between the two

519
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.439
and

520
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:28.459
willpower and backbone and fortitude and all of that,

521
00:31:28.699 --> 00:31:33.569
that's the stuff we admire because that's the true measure of who somebody is

522
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.599
independent of their neurons and molecules of it's made of the same stuff.

523
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.670
And so um is there any space for

524
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:50.119
an idea like meritocracy in this sort of deterministic

525
00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:54.589
world? I mean, if someone just so happens to have

526
00:31:54.829 --> 00:31:58.510
the psychological traits that tend to correlate with success,

527
00:31:58.729 --> 00:32:05.300
for example, in industrialized societies, like greed, conscientiousness,

528
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.479
high intelligence and so on.

529
00:32:07.739 --> 00:32:08.560
Should we at

530
00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:10.969
from, from a scientific perspective?

531
00:32:10.979 --> 00:32:13.839
Of course, I'm not talking about uh philosophy,

532
00:32:13.849 --> 00:32:16.290
a philosophical perspective nor any of that.

533
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.739
Does it make sense to attribute any personal merit to them?

534
00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:22.069
Yeah.

535
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:22.989
Um

536
00:32:23.329 --> 00:32:25.989
The only possible,

537
00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:35.069
scientifically acceptable and morally acceptable conclusion from all of this is

538
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:39.369
there's no circumstance in which blame and punishment

539
00:32:40.119 --> 00:32:43.030
make moral sense or are

540
00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.099
uh are good things in and of themselves.

541
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.280
And likewise,

542
00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:53.719
there's no circumstance in which praise and reward are virtues in

543
00:32:53.729 --> 00:32:57.390
and of themselves because nobody earned one or the other,

544
00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.270
that sort of thing.

545
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.359
This comes with two provisos though

546
00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.140
um

547
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.380
the first one is

548
00:33:05.459 --> 00:33:07.390
like every now and then

549
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:12.359
it's useful to punish someone because it changes their behavior in an effective

550
00:33:12.369 --> 00:33:18.420
way or it's useful to praise somebody because in an instrumental sense.

551
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.849
Um

552
00:33:19.709 --> 00:33:22.170
Praise and blame could be useful,

553
00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.180
not because of what somebody did in the past that this is retribute but

554
00:33:26.189 --> 00:33:28.630
for shaping their future behavior just in

555
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.770
like a psychological engineering kind of way.

556
00:33:31.829 --> 00:33:34.609
Um So that's not saying it's not possible,

557
00:33:34.829 --> 00:33:36.540
it's never useful, but

558
00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:39.689
just as another way of

559
00:33:40.099 --> 00:33:43.329
influence the influencing the biological machine.

560
00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:46.489
Um The more fundamental level is

561
00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:53.880
when you say crazy stuff like I just did to people they say,

562
00:33:54.199 --> 00:33:54.800
oh,

563
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:58.500
so you want just murderers running around the streets

564
00:33:58.819 --> 00:33:59.420
or?

565
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.030
Oh,

566
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.060
you just want it randomly picked who's going to

567
00:34:03.069 --> 00:34:05.859
do brain surgery to take out your tumor.

568
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:07.520
No, of course not.

569
00:34:08.478 --> 00:34:12.458
Even if you get rid of the entire criminal justice system

570
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:14.310
as it now appears.

571
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:15.820
And as we should,

572
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:21.129
because it's built on biological nonsense of the most destructive kind.

573
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.250
Nonetheless,

574
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:26.659
people who are uncontrollably dangerous and violent where you can't fix them,

575
00:34:27.168 --> 00:34:28.820
you gotta protect people from them.

576
00:34:29.188 --> 00:34:32.908
Um, a car whose brakes don't work.

577
00:34:33.018 --> 00:34:36.789
You don't let it out on the street, you put it in the garage and you like,

578
00:34:36.799 --> 00:34:37.748
don't drive it,

579
00:34:37.888 --> 00:34:42.447
but you don't preach to either that violent person

580
00:34:42.549 --> 00:34:45.668
or to the car whose brakes don't work that they have a

581
00:34:45.678 --> 00:34:50.329
crummy rotten soul and they don't deserve to be able to do this

582
00:34:50.849 --> 00:34:56.717
and what you have to do instead is use a term that's more and more in like this.

583
00:34:57.129 --> 00:35:00.310
People thinking this way is they have to be quarantined,

584
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.229
quarantine them so that they're not dangerous to anyone and not an inch more.

585
00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:08.310
And not because there's anything about it that

586
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.030
they deserve the brakes don't work on their car

587
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:15.100
and then the flip side is exactly the same. Oh, my God.

588
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:19.229
So, what, we should just have a random lottery as to who,

589
00:35:19.389 --> 00:35:21.419
who, like,

590
00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:25.050
does brain surgery on you. No, of course not.

591
00:35:25.149 --> 00:35:28.550
Just as you can't have dangerous people on the street,

592
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.209
You need the most competent people out there

593
00:35:32.679 --> 00:35:34.899
doing the medicine, doing the

594
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.860
legal stuff, writing whatever it is that takes

595
00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.739
um skill

596
00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.860
that matters,

597
00:35:42.489 --> 00:35:43.850
that's really important.

598
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:44.620
But

599
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:46.739
you just the same,

600
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:51.790
you can't sit there and tell that person because they have a wonderful soul or

601
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.939
a wonderful self discipline or whatever that they

602
00:35:54.949 --> 00:35:57.889
deserve to have this ridiculously large income.

603
00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.020
Like

604
00:35:59.139 --> 00:36:04.100
a world built around blaming people for their antisocial behavior

605
00:36:04.389 --> 00:36:05.590
makes no sense.

606
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.370
And a world built around rewarding people for their

607
00:36:08.379 --> 00:36:12.379
prosocial behavior or their expertise makes no sense either.

608
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:15.459
Um And is ultimately

609
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.419
just as morally

610
00:36:18.459 --> 00:36:19.360
corrupt

611
00:36:19.899 --> 00:36:23.560
because if you say you are a brain surgeon

612
00:36:23.969 --> 00:36:26.679
and getting enormous societal prestige

613
00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.780
because you did something where you earned it, you deserve to do that

614
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:36.060
and be in that position makes as little sense biologically as saying

615
00:36:36.409 --> 00:36:37.129
the brain,

616
00:36:37.139 --> 00:36:40.560
the uh the murderer with a history of frontal cortical

617
00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.959
damage deserves to be in prison all of that.

618
00:36:43.229 --> 00:36:45.479
Um Yeah, it's the flip side.

619
00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.000
A meritocracy makes no sense. A

620
00:36:48.429 --> 00:36:53.429
justice system built around retribution makes no sense either.

621
00:36:53.459 --> 00:36:57.860
But at the same time, dangerous people should not be allowed to damage people.

622
00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.570
And competent people should be more likely to

623
00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.139
be running the world than less competent people.

624
00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.870
But no one should feel shame or pride

625
00:37:07.669 --> 00:37:09.189
for which end of those Katina

626
00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.500
they wind up on.

627
00:37:12.459 --> 00:37:16.830
But even if there's not really space for

628
00:37:17.149 --> 00:37:20.800
blame or praise or to consider

629
00:37:20.979 --> 00:37:25.719
or to think that someone is responsible for their own actions,

630
00:37:25.919 --> 00:37:31.050
do you think that it would still make sense to talk about punishment?

631
00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.360
At least as a deterrence measure

632
00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:35.800
or for example,

633
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:43.070
blaming or praising someone just because we know scientifically that if we do that,

634
00:37:43.209 --> 00:37:47.229
we would be disincentivizing bad behavior,

635
00:37:47.239 --> 00:37:52.679
incentivizing good behavior and conditioning people to behave in

636
00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:54.409
better ways.

637
00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:55.810
Absolutely.

638
00:37:55.979 --> 00:37:56.719
And

639
00:37:57.050 --> 00:38:00.229
it's the same biology that like you take a,

640
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:07.169
a sea snail and it could learn that when you like bop it on the head with a pencil,

641
00:38:07.179 --> 00:38:08.989
it retracts its

642
00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:10.780
gill mechanism or some.

643
00:38:10.939 --> 00:38:11.489
Yeah,

644
00:38:11.709 --> 00:38:13.350
you can shape

645
00:38:13.459 --> 00:38:16.860
sea snails behavior, you could shape human behavior,

646
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:21.209
you could shape human behavior to be more or less adaptive, blah, blah, all of that.

647
00:38:21.219 --> 00:38:21.550
And

648
00:38:21.729 --> 00:38:21.919
yeah.

649
00:38:22.004 --> 00:38:22.104
Yeah,

650
00:38:22.114 --> 00:38:27.264
sometimes it requires punishment and sometimes it requires praise and reward.

651
00:38:27.485 --> 00:38:28.544
Um But

652
00:38:28.725 --> 00:38:30.024
just because

653
00:38:30.395 --> 00:38:33.425
that's like another thing you can do,

654
00:38:33.554 --> 00:38:34.854
sometimes

655
00:38:34.975 --> 00:38:38.145
intervene with somebody who's got problems and

656
00:38:38.304 --> 00:38:43.044
make sure they uh they get enough calories in their diet

657
00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:48.409
and things will go better sometimes like you hit someone over the head and say they,

658
00:38:48.419 --> 00:38:52.250
they can't do this anymore and they'll stop doing some rotten behavior.

659
00:38:52.379 --> 00:38:53.040
Yes.

660
00:38:53.199 --> 00:38:58.229
But never with a sense that you are doing a moral good

661
00:38:58.959 --> 00:39:00.860
because that's completely irrelevant.

662
00:39:00.979 --> 00:39:03.580
It's just another realm in which

663
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.699
we as biological machines can be shaped in our behavior.

664
00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:17.479
And what do you think about, uh, the idea that some people put forth that, uh, ok,

665
00:39:17.489 --> 00:39:21.949
even if we know that free will does not exist

666
00:39:21.969 --> 00:39:24.629
that it doesn't make sense to talk about free will.

667
00:39:25.389 --> 00:39:30.090
People should still believe in free will because if they don't,

668
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.929
they will be

669
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:37.659
worse people. I mean, do you, or do you think on the other hand that, uh,

670
00:39:37.979 --> 00:39:40.399
telling people that,

671
00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:40.540
uh,

672
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:47.250
they should abandon their belief in free will would actually improve their lives?

673
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.610
Ok. This is, this is ultimately like

674
00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:54.979
the most important question to ask whether or not we have free will.

675
00:39:54.989 --> 00:39:56.620
Should we all believe that we do?

676
00:39:56.889 --> 00:39:57.459
Um,

677
00:39:57.689 --> 00:40:02.580
one worry which you bring up is if we stop believing in free will,

678
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:07.500
we're all gonna become murderers and cheats and liars and we will run amok.

679
00:40:07.584 --> 00:40:11.584
Um And this is the thing people worry about,

680
00:40:11.824 --> 00:40:17.685
uh, most instantly and there's a cruel experimental psychology literature

681
00:40:17.985 --> 00:40:23.715
showing that if you take like volunteer test subjects and you manipulate them

682
00:40:23.975 --> 00:40:28.304
into feeling like there is less free will than they thought there was

683
00:40:28.495 --> 00:40:32.485
10 minutes later, they're more likely to cheat on a test,

684
00:40:32.495 --> 00:40:35.844
they're more likely to do something crummy to somebody else.

685
00:40:35.854 --> 00:40:37.084
When they're playing a game,

686
00:40:37.379 --> 00:40:41.080
morality and ethical behavior goes down.

687
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.040
That's it. That's exactly what,

688
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:47.770
like the problem is when you tell people, um,

689
00:40:48.239 --> 00:40:51.100
like you can't be held responsible for anything.

690
00:40:51.209 --> 00:40:51.790
They've run

691
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.379
amok.

692
00:40:52.389 --> 00:40:55.209
Just like if you convince someone that there

693
00:40:55.219 --> 00:40:57.939
is no God and thus there's no punishment,

694
00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.439
they run amok also.

695
00:41:00.189 --> 00:41:02.639
And then you look closer at it

696
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:06.830
and because there's this parallel literature, you

697
00:41:06.969 --> 00:41:11.760
have test subjects and you convince them, manipulate them into believing,

698
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:16.629
lesson God and right afterward, they cheat more and they do the same crummy stuff.

699
00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:20.250
But now you do a different version of these studies,

700
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:26.110
get someone who comes in and says, I haven't believed in free will for 10 years

701
00:41:26.699 --> 00:41:31.270
or I haven't believed in God since I was a teenager or any.

702
00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:34.719
You get people who have thought that way and felt

703
00:41:34.729 --> 00:41:37.600
that way for a long time who got there.

704
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.939
Not because some like psychology professor

705
00:41:40.949 --> 00:41:43.030
is manipulating them in this environment.

706
00:41:43.139 --> 00:41:44.939
But you get people like that

707
00:41:45.179 --> 00:41:51.840
who've thought through this for a long time. And they are exactly as moral

708
00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.100
as the most religious people and the people with

709
00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:57.370
the strongest sense of belief in free will.

710
00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:00.429
And this fascinates me,

711
00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.179
like in terms of the God issue,

712
00:42:03.709 --> 00:42:07.500
you look at people who very, very strongly believe in God

713
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:08.780
and the whole

714
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:14.379
show that goes along with that or very, very strongly believes there is no God.

715
00:42:14.389 --> 00:42:15.290
And as I said,

716
00:42:15.429 --> 00:42:18.949
there's no difference in their levels of ethical behavior

717
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:25.560
and it's very high in both cases who are the ones who are less ethical,

718
00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:27.250
the ones who are in between,

719
00:42:27.409 --> 00:42:29.500
the ones who say, oh, I don't know,

720
00:42:29.929 --> 00:42:31.830
I guess there's God and like,

721
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:35.870
I make sure the kids learn something about it because it's good for them and like,

722
00:42:35.879 --> 00:42:36.510
the, the ho

723
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:40.850
are good or say God, I don't, I don't actually care.

724
00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:44.040
Maybe there's not a God, but it's like, what does it have to do with me?

725
00:42:44.159 --> 00:42:46.489
The people who are like

726
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:52.350
indifferently religious or apathetically atheistic, the ones in the middle,

727
00:42:52.439 --> 00:42:56.590
those are the ones who you readily manipulate their moral behavior,

728
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.179
one direction or the other.

729
00:42:58.239 --> 00:43:02.830
If you've spent a hell of a long time sitting and thinking about

730
00:43:02.979 --> 00:43:08.120
the root of human goodness and evil and what we owe our

731
00:43:08.129 --> 00:43:13.139
fellow humans and is their purpose in life that transcends us.

732
00:43:13.189 --> 00:43:17.620
It doesn't really matter if your conclusion is there is a God or there

733
00:43:17.629 --> 00:43:22.750
is no God or we're free agents or we have no free will whatsoever.

734
00:43:22.939 --> 00:43:25.860
You're one of the ones who thought long and hard about it

735
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:30.830
and both sets of conclusions you come out as being more ethically

736
00:43:31.199 --> 00:43:31.889
moral

737
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:33.830
than your average person.

738
00:43:34.129 --> 00:43:34.780
Um

739
00:43:34.889 --> 00:43:37.959
So people are not going to run amok

740
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.540
if they are raised from the very beginning

741
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.780
to think this is not a world where it is fair. To blame anyone

742
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:50.300
and I don't deserve to get this or that reward more than anyone else.

743
00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.760
They're going to be past the notion. Oh,

744
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:58.729
no one's gonna hold me responsible. I can go and stab the old lady

745
00:43:58.919 --> 00:44:03.419
there with any luck to be past that by the time they're like, 20 years old.

746
00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:10.689
And I was here hearing all the time people saying that

747
00:44:10.889 --> 00:44:17.459
hard determinist were all nihilists and atheists and they were all the time,

748
00:44:17.689 --> 00:44:23.750
-- uh, pillaging and raping and murdering people.
-- Exactly. Because that's,

749
00:44:23.899 --> 00:44:25.879
that's the logical first thing.

750
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:29.199
Um, the logical second thing that was also, went back

751
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:32.080
in your question is when you get past, oh,

752
00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:38.370
should I run amok and do whatever I want all of that is, should I get depressed as hell?

753
00:44:38.399 --> 00:44:41.239
Because there's no purpose to any of this?

754
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:45.870
There's this huge existential void out there.

755
00:44:45.899 --> 00:44:50.719
Should I like, is this terrible thing to have people believe

756
00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:53.909
in terms of their mental health and stuff? Um,

757
00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:55.419
and a point,

758
00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:56.570
like,

759
00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.399
it took me five years to write this book and the 1st 4.5

760
00:45:00.409 --> 00:45:04.310
years I was thinking the answer to that was gonna have to be.

761
00:45:04.409 --> 00:45:07.199
Yeah. And that sucks. And it's awful.

762
00:45:07.209 --> 00:45:10.520
But, you know, that's how things work and, like, come on,

763
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:12.600
we need to be adults and face reality

764
00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.520
and it finally struck me

765
00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.979
the much more meaningful answer to it,

766
00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.469
which is, if you are convinced there's no free will

767
00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.850
and you get totally depressed and empty

768
00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:30.199
void because it means your accomplishments.

769
00:45:30.209 --> 00:45:32.159
You didn't really earn that.

770
00:45:32.169 --> 00:45:35.679
The people who loved you don't really love you for who you are.

771
00:45:35.689 --> 00:45:41.449
But for biological stuff that you helped this old woman cross the street just now.

772
00:45:41.459 --> 00:45:45.560
Not because you're a good person, but because that's how you function as machine.

773
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:45.909
All that.

774
00:45:46.179 --> 00:45:50.919
Oh my God. This is so depressing. If that's your response,

775
00:45:51.479 --> 00:45:53.310
you're one of the lucky ones.

776
00:45:54.139 --> 00:45:57.439
You've got the luck and privilege to sit there and say,

777
00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.580
oh my God, maybe I really didn't earn my wonderful university degree.

778
00:46:02.699 --> 00:46:03.760
Oh my God.

779
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:08.770
Maybe I didn't really deserve to be liked by people because of my personality.

780
00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:12.959
If you're someone who has spent your whole life paying the price of

781
00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.159
your parents, poverty

782
00:46:15.879 --> 00:46:16.580
or

783
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:21.310
the fact that you don't have an attractive face or the fact that you have

784
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.580
the genes that deep predispose you towards

785
00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:27.280
obesity and people recoil from overweight people.

786
00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:30.320
Or because you turned out not to be so smart or

787
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:33.679
it turns out you can't control your behavior because of biology.

788
00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:37.260
All that getting rid of the free will concept does

789
00:46:37.649 --> 00:46:39.080
is be liberating.

790
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:45.090
You don't have a shitty soul because your life has not turned out that well.

791
00:46:45.229 --> 00:46:46.860
And for most people,

792
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:51.659
that's the much more important outcome to all of this than deciding, oh,

793
00:46:51.669 --> 00:46:55.489
I guess I really didn't earn my million dollars to be a millionaire.

794
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:57.840
Um, for most people

795
00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.179
getting rid of the concept of free will is

796
00:47:01.189 --> 00:47:04.199
not gonna make us like crazy and nihilistic.

797
00:47:04.229 --> 00:47:06.219
Um It's gonna be liberating.

798
00:47:07.939 --> 00:47:08.479
Mhm

799
00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:14.100
But uh going back just for a second to one of the initial

800
00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:17.679
points I brought to the table when it comes to the fact that

801
00:47:17.889 --> 00:47:21.489
we do not yet have a complete science of

802
00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:26.719
human behavior and we cannot 100% predict how someone

803
00:47:26.929 --> 00:47:29.530
will behave in a particular situation.

804
00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:30.479
Uh

805
00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:36.860
What if someone heard your arguments of behavioral scientist and said, oh OK, Dr

806
00:47:37.459 --> 00:47:41.419
Sapolsky, your arguments are great, the science is awesome. But

807
00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:46.939
since we still do not have a complete picture of human behavior,

808
00:47:46.949 --> 00:47:51.689
at least for the time being, I will refrain from making

809
00:47:51.909 --> 00:47:57.195
absolute claims, uh claims regarding free will. I will wait and see.

810
00:47:57.375 --> 00:47:57.784
I mean,

811
00:47:57.794 --> 00:48:01.824
basically what I'm asking you is do you think that the fact

812
00:48:01.834 --> 00:48:05.945
that we do not yet have a complete science of free will

813
00:48:06.054 --> 00:48:12.314
uh would make uh such a claim that we should reframe, refrain from making

814
00:48:12.574 --> 00:48:18.425
-- such absolute claims about free will uh make
-- sense, right? Um

815
00:48:19.909 --> 00:48:22.000
Two types of answers there.

816
00:48:22.459 --> 00:48:23.879
The first one is

817
00:48:24.159 --> 00:48:24.780
um

818
00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:25.570
yeah,

819
00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:28.840
it's gonna be so hard to subtract out thinking there's free

820
00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:32.290
will because we don't have the solid scientific facts yet.

821
00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:33.610
For centuries,

822
00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:38.050
all we've done over and over is figure out that responsibility

823
00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.449
turns out not to have something to do with our behavior.

824
00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:46.010
Turns out hailstorms are not caused by witches,

825
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:52.169
it turns out people who have epileptic seizures are not possessed by Satan

826
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.899
or even

827
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:57.909
within the last 50 years or so. It turns out

828
00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.719
people come down with the disease.

829
00:49:00.729 --> 00:49:05.969
Schizophrenia, not because their mothers were psycho dynamically,

830
00:49:05.979 --> 00:49:08.070
monsters who hated them.

831
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:12.399
And all that happened at each one of those points is

832
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:15.129
you tell the mothers of,

833
00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.330
you know, hundreds of thousands of people with schizophrenia,

834
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:22.229
it's not your fault. It's a neuro genetic disorder.

835
00:49:22.449 --> 00:49:24.729
All you've done is freed them

836
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:30.360
all you've done when you figured out that this kid in your classroom where you're

837
00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:35.860
a teacher just can't learn to read and this kid is just lazy and un mot

838
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.919
no,

839
00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:40.649
there's something in their cortex that could be identified by

840
00:49:40.659 --> 00:49:44.699
scientists so that they reverse letters in their mind.

841
00:49:44.739 --> 00:49:46.080
They have dyslexia,

842
00:49:46.429 --> 00:49:52.010
it's not their fault. We can't explain yet who gets dyslexia and who doesn't?

843
00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:55.169
We have only hints from prenatal environment, blah, blah, blah.

844
00:49:55.229 --> 00:49:57.209
But we know enough that

845
00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:01.199
it is both intellectually and morally bankrupt

846
00:50:01.919 --> 00:50:05.520
to decide that this child is lazy and unmotivated

847
00:50:05.639 --> 00:50:08.580
and to instead recognize we've identified

848
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:11.610
their particular type of biological constraint

849
00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:16.750
and all that's going to happen in the future is more and more and more of those.

850
00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:20.300
And all we can be at this point is accepting

851
00:50:20.419 --> 00:50:25.320
that a whole lot of things that pulls out the ugliest in us

852
00:50:25.649 --> 00:50:27.179
in the way of judgment.

853
00:50:27.889 --> 00:50:32.750
We're gonna wind up saying, oh my God, I had no, I had no idea.

854
00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.290
It had something to do with that

855
00:50:35.219 --> 00:50:36.840
or framed a different way. Yeah. Yeah.

856
00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:40.110
Yeah, we can't sit there and say somebody with this sort of upbringing,

857
00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:44.110
we can absolutely predict that they're gonna wind up going to

858
00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.320
a top university or wind up being a multiple murderer.

859
00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:50.189
Yeah, we can't predict that yet. The science isn't good enough.

860
00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.479
The science is good enough

861
00:50:52.665 --> 00:50:54.445
on a population level.

862
00:50:54.675 --> 00:50:58.334
Any time you could look at an entire population

863
00:50:58.475 --> 00:51:04.245
and say for every increased incidence of a horrible childhood experience,

864
00:51:04.554 --> 00:51:07.574
you've just increased 35% the likelihood that they're

865
00:51:07.584 --> 00:51:09.995
going to be arrested by the time they're 20

866
00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:11.989
you got enough science.

867
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:12.840
At that point,

868
00:51:12.899 --> 00:51:17.840
you've got enough science that you better know you have no leg to stand on.

869
00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:22.120
If you sit there and say this kid this 20 year old,

870
00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:25.320
what can I say? They're just plain evil. This kid,

871
00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:29.580
if you 35% for each step,

872
00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.909
there's enough science at this point,

873
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.350
there's enough knowledge there.

874
00:51:34.419 --> 00:51:37.649
If you have, I don't know whatever percent predictability

875
00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:41.909
that if your mother was drinking heavily when you're a fetus,

876
00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:46.350
you've got this likelihood of having an IQ below this.

877
00:51:46.649 --> 00:51:49.290
And someday when you're failing classes,

878
00:51:50.669 --> 00:51:52.219
we know enough science already.

879
00:51:52.229 --> 00:51:58.719
In all these cases, we know enough science because we run an entire society on

880
00:51:58.989 --> 00:52:01.030
statistical guilt

881
00:52:01.199 --> 00:52:06.830
and statistical wonderful accomplishments. And we know enough now to know that

882
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:08.449
those are not OK.

883
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.290
So I have one last question then

884
00:52:13.709 --> 00:52:18.110
what would it take for, for someone to convince you

885
00:52:18.489 --> 00:52:23.719
that you're wrong and actually free will exists?

886
00:52:25.419 --> 00:52:28.959
OK? Here's, here's my pain in the ass response.

887
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:34.520
And the philosophers are going to like, oh come on, give me a break. Um

888
00:52:34.909 --> 00:52:37.760
The version that they start off with is oh, come on,

889
00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:41.689
give me a break is you've just done something, you've pulled a trigger

890
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:42.719
on a gun,

891
00:52:42.729 --> 00:52:47.899
you just did something consequential And here's the muscles that contract it.

892
00:52:47.909 --> 00:52:52.229
And here's the three motor neurons that just sent that command.

893
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:56.370
And if you wanna convince us that free will actually exist,

894
00:52:56.379 --> 00:52:58.370
show us that those neurons

895
00:52:59.159 --> 00:53:01.020
just did what they did

896
00:53:01.179 --> 00:53:05.659
independent of what any other neuron in the brain was doing at that moment.

897
00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:06.989
If you could do that,

898
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:10.429
you've just proven free will. And they say, oh come on, give us a break.

899
00:53:10.439 --> 00:53:12.229
That's ridiculous. A demand.

900
00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:15.100
I would demand a whole lot more than that.

901
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:16.860
I would say.

902
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:21.909
Show me that those three neurons just told you to pull that trigger,

903
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.610
having nothing to do with what any other neuron was whispering to it at the time

904
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.479
and having nothing to do with your hormone levels that morning

905
00:53:30.709 --> 00:53:32.800
and having nothing to do with your history of

906
00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:35.159
trauma and having nothing to do with your genes.

907
00:53:35.169 --> 00:53:39.389
So show me that if you had changed any of those,

908
00:53:39.469 --> 00:53:42.919
those neurons would still have done the exact same thing at that moment,

909
00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:44.909
then I'll believe in free will

910
00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.469
and you can't,

911
00:53:46.709 --> 00:53:51.739
you can't show that because nothing going on in you right now

912
00:53:51.949 --> 00:53:57.219
is anything but the outcome of all of that stuff that came beforehand,

913
00:53:57.229 --> 00:54:03.389
perhaps unpredictably, perhaps in some nonlinear, non additive cool way,

914
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:09.209
perhaps in an emergent way that we can't even begin to mix. But that's all we are.

915
00:54:09.239 --> 00:54:15.020
Nothing more or less and show me a neuron that just decided to do what it did

916
00:54:15.389 --> 00:54:19.429
independent of everything that came before that millisecond.

917
00:54:20.159 --> 00:54:22.080
And if you could do that, I believe in free will

918
00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:26.370
and uh philosophers are gonna hate it.

919
00:54:26.379 --> 00:54:30.610
But what I think any biologist who knows this stuff would say is,

920
00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:31.560
yeah,

921
00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.570
that's kind of what you need to show.

922
00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:40.429
That's kind of the proof that is needed to show that there really is free will

923
00:54:41.129 --> 00:54:44.070
and that's pretty damn unlikely to be able to show that.

924
00:54:46.409 --> 00:54:50.330
OK. So let's see if someone accepts the challenge.

925
00:54:52.379 --> 00:54:53.550
So,

926
00:54:53.800 --> 00:55:00.040
yeah, so the book is again, determined a science of life without free will.

927
00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:03.909
I'm leaving a link within the description box of this interview.

928
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:04.979
Um Doctor

929
00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:08.139
Sapolsky, just before we go apart from the book,

930
00:55:08.149 --> 00:55:11.100
would you like to mention briefly where people can

931
00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:13.550
find you and your work on the internet?

932
00:55:13.959 --> 00:55:14.610
Um

933
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:17.389
Let's see, I'm I am

934
00:55:17.649 --> 00:55:20.129
a medieval peasant in that.

935
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:24.679
Not only don't, I do Facebook, I don't know how to, don't, not

936
00:55:25.429 --> 00:55:28.649
only do I not do Instagram or any of these

937
00:55:28.659 --> 00:55:31.360
things that my kids say that I don't understand.

938
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:33.229
So I have no presence there, but

939
00:55:33.629 --> 00:55:38.129
there's a bunch of my lectures that have been put up on youtube.

940
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:39.209
Um

941
00:55:39.989 --> 00:55:43.760
I teach a class at Stanford every other year on

942
00:55:43.899 --> 00:55:46.330
the biology of human social behavior.

943
00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:49.919
That's basically the last hour stretched out over entire semester.

944
00:55:49.929 --> 00:55:50.889
And years ago,

945
00:55:50.899 --> 00:55:54.080
Stanford posted all of those lectures up there and

946
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.110
one of these years I have to update them.

947
00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:56.489
So

948
00:55:56.979 --> 00:55:58.209
go to youtube.

949
00:55:58.409 --> 00:56:02.179
Uh You'll see I'm doing the exact same ranting and raving

950
00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:06.449
word for word and a number of those like talks that overlap,

951
00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:08.689
but that would be a good place.

952
00:56:10.239 --> 00:56:12.260
Ok, great. So, Doctor

953
00:56:12.649 --> 00:56:15.659
Sapolsky, thank you again for coming on the show.
