00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.400
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.329
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:09.329
today I'm joined by Doctor Patricia Silva. She is

4
00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:12.649
an assistant professor at the University of Aveo and

5
00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:16.489
a researcher at the Governance Competitiveness and Public Policies

6
00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:20.540
Research Center of the University of Avio. And today

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.700
we're going to talk about the book she's the

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.170
editor of together with Pedro Magalas and Nunu Montero,

9
00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:33.419
that is Portugal in the 21st century. So, Doctor

10
00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:35.860
Patrici, welcome to the show. It's a huge pleasure

11
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.419
to everyone.

12
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.389
Thank you for having me here today.

13
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.209
So, I, I mean, this is a, a very

14
00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.580
interesting book. I, I mean, in my particular case,

15
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.909
it's even more interesting because I'm also Portuguese as

16
00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.110
you are. So, but what are the goals of

17
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.630
this book? Why write a book about Portugal in

18
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.650
the 21st century?

19
00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:04.110
Well, uh, so, so the idea for this um

20
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.349
edited book came from a series of conversations that

21
00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:11.949
Nuno Montero had with the Luo American Development Foundation.

22
00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.660
Uh, AT the moment, no, Nuno, Nuno, he was

23
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.970
working at a university in the in the US

24
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.620
and he thought that we needed a reference book

25
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.500
that would allow academics to deal with Portugal and

26
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.059
what what the changes that happened during the 21st

27
00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:32.139
century in the Portuguese case, but he also wanted

28
00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:34.699
to have a book that would be interesting for

29
00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:37.940
the um for the entire public, for the ones

30
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.000
that are interested in knowing a little bit more

31
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.830
about Portugal. So the book was targeted at these

32
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.910
two audiences, I, I'd say one academic and the

33
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.309
one that would, would be allowing, would allow the

34
00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:54.980
general public to be involved in these discussions about

35
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.760
the Portuguese case. Nunu began developing this project with

36
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.690
uh the authors, the specific authors of each of

37
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.760
the chapters that we will discuss during this interview.

38
00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:10.169
Unfortunately, Nuno passed away before he he managed to

39
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.130
complete this job and so the flood asked me

40
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.460
and Pedro Mlange to um continue uh the project.

41
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.330
So the idea is basically the idea of dealing

42
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.160
with a country that has a very interesting story.

43
00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.850
And especially the fact that it had 4 decades

44
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.440
of a dictatorship and that had enduring effects. Um,

45
00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:38.130
WHILE we noticed that there was a major transformation

46
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.889
and we can see that obviously in in the

47
00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.320
first years after the transition to democracy. But then

48
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.839
we also find that um the, well, the specificities

49
00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:51.600
of the transition process and also the, the fact

50
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.960
that we have enduring aspects that allow us to

51
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.419
now understand a little bit of what is happening

52
00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.240
in terms of our identity, in terms of our

53
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.330
culture. In terms of how we relate to the

54
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.399
European Union and how relevant the European Union is

55
00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:09.250
also in terms of the party system, so we

56
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.089
have a lot of specific cities from these decades

57
00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:17.490
of dictatorship that were, were somehow translated into different

58
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.940
arenas. And Nuno had this interest in dealing with

59
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.699
this, uh, how, what he thought would be a

60
00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:30.649
remarkable country with a remarkable history. So, uh, well,

61
00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.940
we, what the, the, the, what we asked the

62
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.460
authors of every, um, chapter was to think about

63
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.179
their specific arena, either the economy or uh or

64
00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:48.389
the political system, the arts, literature, we asked them

65
00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:52.399
to think about how the, we had a spectacular

66
00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:56.919
uh economic development, how the country has transformed itself

67
00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.789
from a social perspective, and we wanted to, uh,

68
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.039
specially look into how, how these transformations play out

69
00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:11.860
today currently during this, um, this new millennium specialist,

70
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.089
specially, sorry. Mhm.

71
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.089
So, before we talk about Portugal in the 21st

72
00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.048
century, I think it would be important to cover

73
00:04:21.048 --> 00:04:26.619
some historic, uh, ground here because, uh, this year

74
00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:30.540
marks the 51st anniversary of the fall of the,

75
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.980
of the military dictatorship here in Portugal. And, uh,

76
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.250
I mean, there was a democratization process after that.

77
00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.980
Um, WHAT, what do you think were some of

78
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.459
the main changes that occurred with the transition from

79
00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:50.109
a dictatorship to a social democracy?

80
00:04:51.549 --> 00:04:53.790
Well, I think this, this is such a broad

81
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.149
question because it, it, there are, there are hundreds

82
00:04:58.149 --> 00:05:01.470
of um articles that have been published trying to

83
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.140
deal with these main changes. Uh, AND, uh, well,

84
00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:08.950
you know, that the journey began with this, uh,

85
00:05:08.989 --> 00:05:13.880
carnation revolution that some authors even say that, uh,

86
00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:17.589
it marked the beginning of the third wave of

87
00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:21.790
democratization in the world. So, let me, I want

88
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.459
to, to stress that because Portugal did this process

89
00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:30.450
of transition to a democracy without having A, um,

90
00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.690
without having a model that would, that the country

91
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.329
could aim for, so that necessarily generated a little

92
00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:40.920
bit of, of conflict and a little bit of

93
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.690
indecisiveness as to where we should go after this

94
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.730
peaceful military coup. But we did have this peaceful

95
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.730
military coup that, you know, that was led by

96
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.570
the armed forces movement and it, it marked the

97
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.309
end of one of the biggest dictatorship. That occurred

98
00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:02.510
at the moment with more than 48, with more

99
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.690
than 48 years. And with a large period where

100
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.820
we, we have strict censorship, political repression, no political

101
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.850
freedoms. So uh this revolution was also largely fueled

102
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.529
by these discontent of citizens, particularly because of the

103
00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:27.720
ongoing colonial wars that was draining. The resources and

104
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.910
also the morale in Portugal. So there was this,

105
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.480
um, this, the public desire and also this desire

106
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.190
among the members of the armed forces that wanted

107
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.279
to uh overthrow the dictatorship and build a new

108
00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:47.420
democratic um society. So yes, we did experience a,

109
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.989
a, a very significant transformation. With, with first elections

110
00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:56.070
where, where we have citizens participating in a competitive

111
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.829
scenario, that's because we did have elections during the

112
00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:03.230
democrat during the dictatorship, but those are not necessarily

113
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.589
competitive and that's, that's a huge difference. Um, SO

114
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:11.470
we had, um, we also had the process of

115
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.029
preparing the very complex process of preparing this new

116
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:20.000
constitution with civil rights, political freedom. Uh WITH social

117
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.670
rights that were uh essential for uh the democracy.

118
00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:28.390
And then we have this very, very rapid decolonization

119
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.630
of the Portuguese territories in Africa, uh, and that's,

120
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.390
uh, that, that how fast it was was also

121
00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:39.920
um um uh an aspect of contention within the

122
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.720
armed forces that eventually generated this convulsionary period right

123
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.309
after 74. And then The regime, uh political parties

124
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:53.390
that were formed at the moment, especially, you know,

125
00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:56.869
the Socialist Social Democratic Party and the Socialist Party

126
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:59.679
that was not, that was formerly uh a little

127
00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:04.910
before uh 74, but the, the, and was formed

128
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.109
not, not necessarily in the country but in while

129
00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:10.589
in exile, but, but they were, they were trying

130
00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:13.950
to find this, the, the space for these political

131
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.950
parties. And one of the ways that they understood

132
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.260
that the new democratic regime would be uh would

133
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.829
be able to gain grounds was through the expansion

134
00:08:24.829 --> 00:08:27.790
of rights and welfare. That's why we have this

135
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.829
major conquest in Portugal, which is the national health

136
00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:35.500
system. The idea that we needed to improve education,

137
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:40.630
health care, social services, reducing inequalities, and, you know,

138
00:08:41.109 --> 00:08:44.979
improve the quality of life of citizens. And that

139
00:08:44.979 --> 00:08:48.099
was, uh, and that is, that's certainly an arena

140
00:08:48.099 --> 00:08:51.380
where we made, we made huge progresses during the

141
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.340
first decades of uh the democracy. Obviously we had

142
00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:00.090
political instability, uh, we, we, we did have uh

143
00:09:00.099 --> 00:09:03.830
uh a lot of, of political instability, especially because

144
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.380
there was contention as to which type of regime

145
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.299
we would have. Uh, AND because we had the

146
00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:15.780
communists wishing a different, uh, type of democracy and

147
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.340
then we had the Socialist Party and the Social

148
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:25.210
democratic Party that wanted a more pro-Western, uh, type

149
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.390
of, uh, of democracy, a liberal democracy. And so

150
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.690
we have also this, uh, these two political parties,

151
00:09:32.729 --> 00:09:35.690
these two, I would say these two poles that

152
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:40.530
were aiming for different, um, goals. So major transformations

153
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:46.369
but with um with uh a very convulsionary journey.

154
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.549
Mhm. When it comes to the democratization process, I

155
00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:54.830
mean, of course, it was a process because the

156
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:59.010
transition from a dictatorship to a democracy doesn't occur

157
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:03.309
overnight. How long was it just for people to

158
00:10:03.309 --> 00:10:07.849
have an idea of how these things play out?

159
00:10:09.179 --> 00:10:14.340
Well, the, the, the, it is not easy to

160
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.659
um to establish a specific date, but I would

161
00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:23.409
say that the first two years were fundamental to

162
00:10:23.409 --> 00:10:26.460
um decide that we wanted to have what type

163
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.159
of a democracy we wanted. It was also the

164
00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:33.030
first few years that we, we decided that, well,

165
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.599
the, the goal would be to democratize democratize the

166
00:10:36.599 --> 00:10:42.219
country, also deal with the colonies and decolonize, um,

167
00:10:42.239 --> 00:10:46.799
but it wasn't definitely a a smooth and negotiated.

168
00:10:47.719 --> 00:10:52.080
Uh, PROCESS like the one, that we saw for

169
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.630
example in Spain where, um, where the political elites

170
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.200
actually negotiated there, there were agreements between the old

171
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.880
regime and the opposition. So what we had in

172
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.400
Portugal was this radical break, uh, and that was

173
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.349
also what generated this intense period with uh political

174
00:11:11.349 --> 00:11:15.570
and social uh uh contention, I'd say. So, but,

175
00:11:15.619 --> 00:11:17.780
but, but I would say that we had these

176
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.859
two first years where, you know, we had the

177
00:11:20.859 --> 00:11:24.419
hot summer of '74 when we had these tensions

178
00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:31.219
that even generated violent clashes and um and then

179
00:11:31.219 --> 00:11:36.020
also November 25 and 75, so we did have

180
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.710
this uh This um period, I would say of

181
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.909
about 2 years from the carnation to the time

182
00:11:42.909 --> 00:11:45.750
where we actually were able to adopt a new

183
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:50.530
constitution and then managed to have elections uh in,

184
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.750
in that, that would definitely establish this as a

185
00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:01.309
country that was democratizing, democratizing. Obviously, we say that

186
00:12:01.309 --> 00:12:05.309
we have uh there's this transition period and then

187
00:12:05.309 --> 00:12:07.590
there's the period where we say that, well, we

188
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:11.830
now have a consolidated democracy and that these are

189
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.989
two different processes, two different periods, and what we

190
00:12:14.989 --> 00:12:17.590
can see there is that we can, we, it

191
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.070
is generally assumed that we can see that Portugal

192
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:24.030
as a consolidated democracy from the moment when Cavaco

193
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:29.510
Silva managed his Uh, first majority as the government

194
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.940
and then we had stable patterns of party interaction,

195
00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:37.400
stable patterns of government formation, and that allows us

196
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.710
also to think that, well, we are now entering

197
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:44.200
the stage where we have um we have, we,

198
00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.380
we are now entering the stage where we have

199
00:12:46.729 --> 00:12:50.289
Uh, fully democracy. It's not, so I just wanted

200
00:12:50.289 --> 00:12:53.969
to make sure that we make these two periods

201
00:12:53.969 --> 00:12:56.450
as distinct, one thinks is the transition to and

202
00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.250
the other is to consolidate it as a democracy.

203
00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:04.760
Half a century later, do you see that there's

204
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.750
been a legacy to the dictatorship in any way?

205
00:13:08.869 --> 00:13:13.000
And if so, in what ways does it manifest?

206
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.359
Is it politically? Is it in terms of the

207
00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:22.109
population's mentality, particularly the older people who live through

208
00:13:22.359 --> 00:13:25.739
the dictatorship? Uh, WHAT do you think about it?

209
00:13:26.669 --> 00:13:29.750
Well, there are so many, uh, there are so

210
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.109
so many of these legacies that we can see.

211
00:13:32.309 --> 00:13:35.989
One of them is obviously politically. First one is

212
00:13:35.989 --> 00:13:38.549
the, the idea of what kind of parties do

213
00:13:38.549 --> 00:13:42.450
we have now, and that that is a lot

214
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.299
explained by the the process of the transition because,

215
00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:48.030
you know, the political parties actually emerged at the

216
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:52.460
period where they were, they didn't have necessarily time

217
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:57.460
to mobilize the electorate. And especially the social socialist

218
00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.409
party and the Social Democratic Party when they emerged,

219
00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:02.200
they had a view of what kind of a

220
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.099
democracy they wanted. And then we had a communist

221
00:14:05.099 --> 00:14:09.140
that had a stronger mobilization, I would say. But

222
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.320
this new political parties that that were formed, they

223
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:18.059
actually entered government a few days after they were

224
00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:23.409
formally uh established. So what this generated political parties

225
00:14:23.409 --> 00:14:27.770
that are what we call internally mobilized, it means

226
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:32.489
that they were able to establish their organizations taking

227
00:14:32.489 --> 00:14:36.359
stock of the resources that they gained from state,

228
00:14:36.729 --> 00:14:40.159
so. We managed to have these political parties that

229
00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:45.739
somehow are dependent on the state, how the, the,

230
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:50.190
and that has to some extent discouraged the development

231
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:55.280
of strong independent party party structures. Another thing that

232
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.789
we noticed is how is clientelism, the idea that

233
00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:02.830
the, that, that is quite There is, there are

234
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.549
a lot of research that claims that this is

235
00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:08.789
quite pervasive in the Portuguese case because parties actually

236
00:15:08.789 --> 00:15:14.539
were able to use public administration to distribute positions

237
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.619
to their followers. It was an easy way of,

238
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.710
you know, guaranteeing support for the political parties. So

239
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.789
what they did, they took stock of those resources

240
00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:26.390
that they had access to. And to some extent

241
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:31.030
that generated a path where clientelism has has has

242
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.450
been pervasive, and it becomes increasingly more difficult for

243
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.070
political parties to get rid of this. So while

244
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.789
political parties are central, they do have this, uh,

245
00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:46.070
this, um this dependency on the state. And then

246
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.150
we also noticed that in, in terms of the

247
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.570
economy, I mean, uh, Susanna Peralta also to some

248
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.710
extent deals with that, the, the idea that we

249
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.619
had, well, this massive nationalization of industries. We had

250
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:03.289
one of the biggest public sector businesses at, at

251
00:16:03.289 --> 00:16:07.010
the uh public business sector at the moment. Uh,

252
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:12.369
AND we, that, that to some extent also generated

253
00:16:12.369 --> 00:16:15.669
a little bit of, you know, uh, burden, an

254
00:16:15.669 --> 00:16:19.049
enormous burden in terms of, of the public sector

255
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.859
and, and also, um, the, the difficulties in dealing

256
00:16:22.859 --> 00:16:28.390
with this enormous uh structures. We, uh we also

257
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:33.909
deal with the, this nationalized economy that was characterized

258
00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:39.219
by poor productivity, deficits with political interference as well

259
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.059
and to some extent these are, there are some

260
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:47.270
inefficiencies here that endured. Um, AND obviously there are,

261
00:16:47.469 --> 00:16:51.150
um, there were at the moment is, uh, also

262
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.869
connecting to the size of the public, uh, civil

263
00:16:53.869 --> 00:16:58.289
service, the public civil service because because of the,

264
00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:04.390
the purges because Portugal did had extensive purges of

265
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:08.469
political and administrative personnel, uh, from the, from the

266
00:17:08.469 --> 00:17:13.459
new state because of this. Transition through Rutura because

267
00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:15.868
we, we, we didn't have a pact as I

268
00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:19.858
mentioned before, uh, so what we had was uh

269
00:17:19.858 --> 00:17:24.500
a public administration that was destructured, so we didn't

270
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.660
have necessarily experienced uh staff. It created a lot

271
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:33.609
of inefficiencies in governance. And uh that also uh

272
00:17:33.609 --> 00:17:39.329
generated this, um this, this difficult uh relationship also

273
00:17:39.329 --> 00:17:44.750
with uh public administration. And finally, I think one

274
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.930
of the most relevant and we keep talking about

275
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.829
this is that there was an intense dispute between

276
00:17:51.829 --> 00:17:55.390
the Socialist Party and the Communist Party during the

277
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:59.910
transition period. And because it, it, it basically deals

278
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.390
with all the two different parties and these two

279
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:07.069
political pluralism and the different, the, the different types

280
00:18:07.069 --> 00:18:10.780
of democracy that these two parties wanted. So that

281
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.949
generated a divide between in at the left, so

282
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.859
we, while we would, why would it, would, we

283
00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:23.089
would expect this divide to occur between the left

284
00:18:23.089 --> 00:18:25.900
and the right, what we had in the Portuguese

285
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:30.219
case was this divide between political parties and the

286
00:18:30.219 --> 00:18:33.750
left. And that wall that was built between the

287
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.739
Socialist Party and the Communist Party was actually endured

288
00:18:37.739 --> 00:18:40.630
and it generally led to the exclusion of the

289
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:45.390
Communist Party from every government formation until now, until

290
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.670
obviously 2015, as you know, when there was this

291
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:55.660
collaboration between left-wing parties, there was uh somehow um

292
00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.199
innovative because we wouldn't expect that given this historical

293
00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.979
Uh, background. But I would say that also this,

294
00:19:03.989 --> 00:19:07.229
uh, this is probably one of the major, probably

295
00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:10.869
one of the major, um, aspects of these legacies

296
00:19:10.869 --> 00:19:12.469
of the dictatorship.

297
00:19:13.829 --> 00:19:17.550
So one more major event in our history that

298
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.469
I would like to ask you about before we

299
00:19:19.469 --> 00:19:23.760
get actually into the 21st century. Uh, LET'S talk

300
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.349
a little bit about Portugal's accession to the European

301
00:19:27.349 --> 00:19:32.420
Union in the 1980s. What does it represent historically

302
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.599
and what would you say are the main impacts

303
00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:40.270
it had in terms of, uh, at the level

304
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:45.229
of politics, economics, and also at a social level?

305
00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.459
Well, this is again a question that would generate

306
00:19:49.459 --> 00:19:55.410
hours of conversation because we, well, because we as,

307
00:19:55.819 --> 00:19:59.939
as we have this transition period and as things

308
00:19:59.939 --> 00:20:03.020
were going, we have reasons to believe that the

309
00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:07.119
country would make its way through a democracy. But

310
00:20:07.119 --> 00:20:10.800
having the European Union as a supporter of a

311
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:16.640
democracy was definitely relevant to establish and to consolidate

312
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.000
Portugal as a democracy because it was at the

313
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.479
moment we had uh two ways, two visions for

314
00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:27.510
Portugal, Portugal. We either would look for African colonies

315
00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:31.079
or we would align with Western democracies and try

316
00:20:31.079 --> 00:20:33.880
to modernize the country looking at the European Union.

317
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.109
And it became, it became very clear in the

318
00:20:37.109 --> 00:20:42.550
70s, in mid 70s when Maurice Swars decided that

319
00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:46.310
he would join the then uh European Economic Community

320
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.109
and then became, became the European Union and what

321
00:20:49.109 --> 00:20:51.430
he thought that this was a way to secure

322
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.599
democracy, to enjoy the opportunity of the funds, especially

323
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.260
to modernize the economy that was so relevant. To

324
00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:02.939
provide citizens with the gains of being a democracy

325
00:21:02.939 --> 00:21:05.430
and with the gains of having, being part of

326
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:09.010
this new world of, of the European Union. So

327
00:21:09.219 --> 00:21:13.739
when he, uh he applied for a membership for

328
00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:18.420
EU membership in '77, it became definitely a priority

329
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.060
for every government. We do not find major differences

330
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.619
between our main political parties, the Socialist Party or

331
00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:29.349
the Social Democratic Party. They were basically aligned with

332
00:21:29.349 --> 00:21:33.369
this idea that we needed the European Union to

333
00:21:33.739 --> 00:21:37.709
uh to modernize the country. And the European Union

334
00:21:37.709 --> 00:21:41.229
also had high standards in terms of what they

335
00:21:41.229 --> 00:21:45.670
expected of a democracy. This was also, it was

336
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:50.089
also the European Union that were um that created

337
00:21:50.089 --> 00:21:52.880
to some extent the idea that we could not

338
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.469
have the armed forces with such a relevant role

339
00:21:56.469 --> 00:22:00.670
of the armed forces within our government. And also

340
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:05.459
this, um, this, the, the, uh the, the pressure

341
00:22:05.459 --> 00:22:10.489
towards modernizing also the economy. Uh, IN terms of,

342
00:22:10.609 --> 00:22:14.050
uh, you know, the, the story because the country

343
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.810
gained a lot from being part of this club

344
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.739
of the European club because of the funds, which

345
00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:25.489
helped modernize the structures which were strongly used to

346
00:22:25.489 --> 00:22:29.900
reduce inequalities at the regional level. That was used

347
00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.900
to improve education and healthcare. It also politically it

348
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:40.219
helped solidify the consensus among political parties and also

349
00:22:40.219 --> 00:22:43.900
among citizens about the importance of European integration. I

350
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:48.020
mean, we even now we see these Eurobarometers that

351
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:52.339
largely expressed this idea that citizens still think that

352
00:22:52.339 --> 00:22:54.410
being part of the European Union is a good

353
00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.660
thing. They have a good image of the European

354
00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:02.109
Union. And that, um, that, uh, that definitely is

355
00:23:02.109 --> 00:23:05.109
relevant. But now, obviously one of the things that

356
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.430
we come across is this idea that obviously Portugal

357
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:14.430
in the 21st century deals with um this this

358
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.589
additional difficulty at this moment because we, we, we

359
00:23:17.589 --> 00:23:21.069
are now extending, we have been making this progress

360
00:23:21.069 --> 00:23:25.209
of extending, enlarging the European Union and if Portugal

361
00:23:25.209 --> 00:23:30.489
was had this Um, privileged position, even when we

362
00:23:30.489 --> 00:23:33.729
can see that there as a member that receives

363
00:23:33.729 --> 00:23:36.089
a lot of EU funds, but there was a

364
00:23:36.089 --> 00:23:40.890
shift because obviously as we are enlarging uh some

365
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.400
of the recipients are other countries, not necessarily Portugal.

366
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.949
And so this shift in terms of the allocation

367
00:23:47.949 --> 00:23:52.589
of funds and also this um perception that Portugal

368
00:23:52.589 --> 00:23:56.069
is at the periphery of the European Union that

369
00:23:56.069 --> 00:24:00.800
might have generated a little of disillusionment within within

370
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.670
Portugal about the gains of the European Union. But

371
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.900
I think that overall, it was definitely a strategic

372
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:14.420
decision that was able to consolidate the democracy and

373
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:18.270
help, help you go through navigate this uh political,

374
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:22.989
economic, and social um matters that were relevant to

375
00:24:22.989 --> 00:24:24.150
secure democracy.

376
00:24:25.859 --> 00:24:29.959
So since we've been part of the European Union

377
00:24:29.959 --> 00:24:34.599
for more than 30 years now, almost 40, how

378
00:24:34.599 --> 00:24:38.709
has Portugal fared in comparison to other members of

379
00:24:38.709 --> 00:24:42.229
the European Union for the first two decades of

380
00:24:42.229 --> 00:24:44.020
the 21st century?

381
00:24:45.569 --> 00:24:47.800
Well, I think that one of the things that

382
00:24:48.609 --> 00:24:52.250
mostly that has to be highlighted here is that

383
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:58.410
Portugal has during the 21st century has had one

384
00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:01.729
of the most turbulent chapters in our recent history,

385
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:06.089
which is the financial crisis and how Portugal dealt

386
00:25:06.089 --> 00:25:11.420
with this financial crisis. Obviously, Portugal had structural weaknesses

387
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.030
in terms of the economy, in terms of public

388
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:20.989
debt, and we, we did uh require this financial

389
00:25:20.989 --> 00:25:26.910
bailout, the troika package that came with, was, was

390
00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:32.469
fundamental for uh Portuguese uh restructuring, rethinking about kind

391
00:25:32.469 --> 00:25:36.290
of state we wanted. Um, BUT it came with

392
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:41.010
very strict, um, conditions, I would say. But what,

393
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.609
what was relevant at this time was that Portugal

394
00:25:43.609 --> 00:25:46.689
was actually able to implement a lot of these

395
00:25:46.689 --> 00:25:51.050
measures, cuts in the public services. And to some

396
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.199
extent, some of them were not necessarily with, with,

397
00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:00.250
although the crisis, this financial crisis has gone a

398
00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:01.930
couple of years ago, was gone a couple of

399
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.369
years ago, fact is that we may not have

400
00:26:04.369 --> 00:26:08.290
been able to go to reach a standard where

401
00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.859
we wanted to be in terms of public services.

402
00:26:11.449 --> 00:26:17.550
Uh, WE, we also had this, um. This, this

403
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:21.459
huge program that was uh well, difficult to um

404
00:26:21.469 --> 00:26:25.069
um to implement. But in the end, it what

405
00:26:25.069 --> 00:26:28.109
was, what was interesting in the Portuguese case is

406
00:26:28.109 --> 00:26:31.869
this idea that we, Portugal was able to regain

407
00:26:31.869 --> 00:26:34.869
credibility. It was actually considered one, a, a good

408
00:26:34.869 --> 00:26:38.989
student within the European Union. And we saw that

409
00:26:38.989 --> 00:26:43.280
when we saw, for example, Mario Centeno being considered

410
00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.579
to be um to become the president of the

411
00:26:46.579 --> 00:26:50.349
Eurogroup. It, it was to some extent also understood

412
00:26:50.349 --> 00:26:53.699
as a testament of how the country would have

413
00:26:53.869 --> 00:26:58.160
um a good reputation in Europe and also how

414
00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.630
the country would be considered as a model for

415
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:06.069
other countries that were struggling, I'd say. So, well,

416
00:27:06.229 --> 00:27:10.750
well, Portugal has made it through, I think that

417
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:14.229
uh it has made huge progress, but obviously we

418
00:27:14.229 --> 00:27:17.270
will talk about it, I guess later because the

419
00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:21.750
high levels of public debt, debt are debt are

420
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.829
still there, uh, uh, and many of the cuts

421
00:27:25.829 --> 00:27:29.829
that were made. Uh, WHERE in terms of public

422
00:27:29.829 --> 00:27:34.469
investment, we, we, we have left essential services like

423
00:27:34.469 --> 00:27:39.670
healthcare and education underfunded, uh, and that, uh, to

424
00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.670
some extent also, um, also portrays this image as

425
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:48.469
Portugal being, um, while efficient, it may not be

426
00:27:48.469 --> 00:27:52.739
sufficiently efficient in terms of the allocation of resources.

427
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:59.439
You mentioned briefly there the 2008 economic crisis. How

428
00:27:59.439 --> 00:28:03.770
would you characterize our response to it? And we

429
00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:07.250
are now in 2025. Do you think we are

430
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.849
still being affected by it in some way?

431
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.709
Well, my, my question would be, yes, we are

432
00:28:14.709 --> 00:28:19.349
still affected by the crisis in several ways. I

433
00:28:19.349 --> 00:28:23.989
mean, while obviously we uh one of the things

434
00:28:23.989 --> 00:28:28.349
is definitely in terms of public discourse, we did

435
00:28:28.349 --> 00:28:32.920
not have governments uh so focused on the idea

436
00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.310
that we need to reduce the budget deficits and

437
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:41.780
stabilize the economy. This became as um Uh, a

438
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:49.180
lasting scar of this 2008, uh, crisis, 2015,014, I

439
00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.579
guess. So we, we, we had this, well, we

440
00:28:53.579 --> 00:28:56.140
thought that we only had some political parties that

441
00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:00.859
we're dealing with and we're considering this as um

442
00:29:00.859 --> 00:29:03.739
a priority. We now have the two main parties

443
00:29:03.739 --> 00:29:06.939
considering it, it both are considering it as a

444
00:29:06.939 --> 00:29:10.900
priority. And the, the results are out there, so

445
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.619
we saw the Socialist Party made, made a huge

446
00:29:13.619 --> 00:29:16.619
progress in, in, in this regard, but all the

447
00:29:16.619 --> 00:29:19.219
other parties that are coming are still dealing with

448
00:29:19.219 --> 00:29:24.630
this need to keep our, our um budget deficit

449
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:31.680
stable. And obviously reduce this deficit. But what the,

450
00:29:31.709 --> 00:29:34.439
the, where I think that we have the major

451
00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:37.369
impact is, is, is most definitely in terms of

452
00:29:37.369 --> 00:29:40.040
the public services and uh one of the chapters

453
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.800
of this book clearly demonstrates that that uh well

454
00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:48.280
we have particularly in the healthcare and education, they

455
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:53.030
were really strongly strained during the crisis and um

456
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:58.520
the, this, this, there are ongoing issues there. Uh,

457
00:29:58.569 --> 00:30:00.890
IN terms of personnel, in terms of resources that

458
00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:04.319
are allocated, in terms, and these are services that

459
00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:08.930
are fundamental to reduce inequalities in the Portuguese case

460
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.310
that are still out there, and that feed populism.

461
00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:17.209
So these inequalities to some extent feed populism and

462
00:30:17.209 --> 00:30:20.709
the, the way to Lower them is through education

463
00:30:20.709 --> 00:30:23.630
and healthcare access to these public services and they

464
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:27.199
are under severe stress and that is definitely one

465
00:30:27.199 --> 00:30:30.359
of the memories of the crisis that continues, uh,

466
00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:34.680
and that, um, will that, that all of the

467
00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.689
countries have to deal with.

468
00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.790
In the book, you also take the time to

469
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.280
talk a little bit about the formation of a

470
00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:48.660
Portuguese national identity. How did it occur? I mean,

471
00:30:48.839 --> 00:30:53.560
how did it develop over time and which factors

472
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.839
contributed to it?

473
00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:58.939
Well, that's one of the things that the Gol

474
00:30:58.939 --> 00:31:02.130
Sobral does in this chapter. It deals with the,

475
00:31:02.189 --> 00:31:06.869
this idea that Portugal, Portugal Portuguese identity was built

476
00:31:06.869 --> 00:31:10.270
as a mixture, a mixture of territory of the

477
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:14.319
boundaries of the limits, geographical limits, but also a

478
00:31:14.319 --> 00:31:18.430
little bit of culture, uh, and this, this idea

479
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:24.400
that we, uh, the culture and also Mostly linguistic

480
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.670
issues that we do not have. Uh, DIVERSITY in

481
00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:31.790
terms of language and also there's obviously a little

482
00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.510
bit of history in that, you know, that, that

483
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.979
Josemanov Sobral goes through this idea that we have

484
00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:42.489
this, uh, this this uh Fonsiri is that managed

485
00:31:42.489 --> 00:31:46.229
to put Portugal on the map. Uh, AND the

486
00:31:46.229 --> 00:31:49.469
how it declared to be a prince of Portugal

487
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.479
and this, uh, and the recognition of, uh, Portugal

488
00:31:53.479 --> 00:31:56.160
through the Treaty of Samoa. So there's also a

489
00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.079
little bit of history here that obviously Chia Noral

490
00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:02.959
does it a lot more than I'm probably doing

491
00:32:02.959 --> 00:32:06.760
here. Uh, AND, um, it does explain this, uh,

492
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.369
in, uh, in, in depth. But one of the

493
00:32:09.369 --> 00:32:12.359
things that I found so much, so, so much

494
00:32:12.359 --> 00:32:16.290
interesting in his chapter is how he also Deals

495
00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.359
with how the identity was built because of the

496
00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.890
the symbolic issue and one of the things that

497
00:32:23.089 --> 00:32:25.689
he mentions in his chapter was what he calls

498
00:32:25.689 --> 00:32:29.160
the miracle of Urik when he said that that

499
00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:33.689
that miracle says that Christ actually appeared to Erikus

500
00:32:33.689 --> 00:32:37.630
before a battle. Uh, AND, uh, that, uh, Christ

501
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:41.229
was actually blessing his mission. So to some extent,

502
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:44.719
this also tied Portugal to this identity, not only

503
00:32:44.719 --> 00:32:48.579
in terms of language, in terms of the territory,

504
00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:51.589
but also how close Portugal would be in terms

505
00:32:51.589 --> 00:32:55.349
of Christianity and the idea that we are to

506
00:32:55.349 --> 00:32:59.750
some extent, a chosen people. So we, by, by,

507
00:32:59.949 --> 00:33:03.694
by the 14th century. We, we already have this

508
00:33:03.694 --> 00:33:08.255
national consciousness that was uh trying to spread and

509
00:33:08.255 --> 00:33:11.775
we, we have these three pillars in terms of

510
00:33:11.775 --> 00:33:17.444
language, the territory, and also this idea of how

511
00:33:18.314 --> 00:33:23.015
friends, there was some, some linkage to uh this

512
00:33:23.015 --> 00:33:27.734
Christianity that also helped build um uh the nation

513
00:33:27.734 --> 00:33:28.974
as we know it today.

514
00:33:30.699 --> 00:33:35.260
And how would you characterize the welfare state in

515
00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:38.979
Portugal? What are its main feature, features and how

516
00:33:38.979 --> 00:33:42.569
does it compare to other European nations?

517
00:33:43.729 --> 00:33:48.050
Well, that's uh Rui Branco and uh Pedro de

518
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.810
Silva. They wrote this chapter on one of the

519
00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:56.010
major aspects that I think distinguishes the Portuguese case,

520
00:33:56.089 --> 00:33:58.359
which is the welfare state and how relevant the

521
00:33:58.359 --> 00:34:02.680
welfare state is uh for Portugal. And what they,

522
00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.290
uh, they, I, I think that one of the

523
00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:08.610
main takeouts of this art of their chapter is

524
00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:12.610
that it is indeed an aspect that faces significant

525
00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:16.889
challenges because of the dual, what they call this

526
00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:20.409
market dualization, you know, that you have protection for

527
00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:23.129
the ones that are working and are integrated in

528
00:34:23.129 --> 00:34:25.717
the, in the labor market. And the ones that

529
00:34:25.717 --> 00:34:29.998
are only temporary workers and you do have uh

530
00:34:29.998 --> 00:34:33.678
these two types of support for citizens. So that's

531
00:34:33.678 --> 00:34:37.717
a specific aspect of our welfare system that puts

532
00:34:37.717 --> 00:34:42.628
some, uh, that's, that is also constraining. Then we

533
00:34:42.628 --> 00:34:48.638
have uh these demographic pressures uh that uh are

534
00:34:48.638 --> 00:34:51.279
ongoing in the Portuguese case and it's interesting that

535
00:34:51.279 --> 00:34:54.248
they bring that. To their chapter because it is

536
00:34:54.248 --> 00:34:56.569
one of the issues that are, that, you know,

537
00:34:56.849 --> 00:34:59.769
political, politically, it has to be on, on the

538
00:34:59.769 --> 00:35:04.529
agenda how the demography is putting pressure on the

539
00:35:04.529 --> 00:35:07.570
welfare state. And we should deal with that as

540
00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:10.770
well and obviously, as we mentioned before, the limited

541
00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:15.360
expenditure, but I think that we have a welfare

542
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:19.889
system that is to some extent unique. It aims

543
00:35:19.889 --> 00:35:25.870
to provide universal access to health care. Obviously funded

544
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:30.060
through our, uh, general taxation, but it has been

545
00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.500
a vital institution. It was a vital institution during

546
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.870
the democratization process and it still is a vital

547
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:42.300
even if it is dealing with, um with this

548
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:48.659
uh difficulties, particularly related to uh the financial sustainability

549
00:35:48.659 --> 00:35:53.810
of the social security. Um, uh, WELL, of this

550
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:57.090
welfare. And one of the things that they deal

551
00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:00.770
with is this idea that we, the way that

552
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:08.159
we index pensions to life expectancy, also how um

553
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:12.939
how early retirement has been penalized. It, it, it

554
00:36:12.939 --> 00:36:17.939
has reduced the generosity of our social security systems.

555
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.679
And also, obviously, during the, the, the financial crisis

556
00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:24.120
that we have just dealt with, we also dealt

557
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:29.959
with um cuts, freezes, reduced uh investment in this

558
00:36:29.959 --> 00:36:34.070
arena. So it, it, it, it, it not only

559
00:36:35.149 --> 00:36:38.870
Generates this debate on the relevance of the welfare

560
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:42.550
state, but also the impact of the welfare state

561
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:46.060
in terms of how it, how pivotal it can

562
00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:51.010
be to reduce inequalities. Obviously, now we are dealing

563
00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:54.649
with this, what we currently have is a social

564
00:36:54.649 --> 00:36:59.330
security system that has to deal with Poverty with

565
00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:02.919
social exclusion. A lot has been done in terms

566
00:37:02.919 --> 00:37:05.610
of, you know, what they deal with with in

567
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.810
the chapters and how Portugal insured this minimum income

568
00:37:10.209 --> 00:37:13.850
that was a, a huge step to combat uh

569
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:18.290
poverty, but again, there, there are uh uh there

570
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:21.610
are uh a set of rules that citizens now

571
00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:23.620
have to address if they want to have access

572
00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:29.280
to these issues. And uh what, what the um

573
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.479
chapter concludes says is that while we do have

574
00:37:33.879 --> 00:37:38.310
a welfare state that, you know, shares some similarities

575
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:42.219
with other countries like Spain, uh, like Spain or

576
00:37:42.219 --> 00:37:47.770
Greece. Uh, WE are also aiming at having, uh,

577
00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:53.270
uh, uh, social security services that we would be

578
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:56.070
able to compare with the Northern European countries like

579
00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:58.699
Sweden and Denmark, these are the ones that we

580
00:37:58.949 --> 00:38:03.590
keep comparing with, uh, because of, of the, uh,

581
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:07.719
idea that Portugal welfare state is a slightly, slightly

582
00:38:07.719 --> 00:38:10.510
less comprehensive than, than the ones that we find

583
00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:15.979
in these countries. Um, SO we do have a

584
00:38:15.979 --> 00:38:20.219
significant level of social expenditure, that's what the, the

585
00:38:20.219 --> 00:38:24.459
chapter concludes, but it's still below what we find

586
00:38:24.459 --> 00:38:28.179
in these more extensive welfare systems.

587
00:38:29.679 --> 00:38:32.000
I would like to ask you now just a

588
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.879
few questions about our political system. So what would

589
00:38:36.879 --> 00:38:41.550
you say characterizes Portugal's political system when it comes

590
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:47.610
to uh the electoral system and to party representation?

591
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:54.060
Well, Carlos, Carlos Jalali, he's the one that dives

592
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:59.429
into Portuguese political system and what he conclude, what

593
00:38:59.429 --> 00:39:02.459
the chapter that he wrote is actually about how

594
00:39:02.459 --> 00:39:06.100
fascinating we have this mixture of structures in the

595
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:11.379
Portuguese case and he he he unpacks this idea

596
00:39:11.379 --> 00:39:15.139
that we have a semi-presidential representative democracy, which means

597
00:39:15.139 --> 00:39:17.699
that we, we have a president and the prime

598
00:39:17.699 --> 00:39:21.379
minister. But the kicker here is that the, the

599
00:39:21.379 --> 00:39:24.620
president is directly elected by the people. It's not

600
00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:27.340
like, you know, for example, in Germany, where the

601
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.729
president comes from parliament. So there are, they are

602
00:39:31.729 --> 00:39:34.610
both, both the president and the government are directly

603
00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:38.929
elected by citizens as you know, in 2024 we

604
00:39:38.929 --> 00:39:42.250
have legislative elections and then we will have presidential

605
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:48.209
elections. So these are two representative institutions that are

606
00:39:48.209 --> 00:39:52.050
both elected by citizens. But a funny part here

607
00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.370
is that when we have a president that has

608
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:58.050
veto powers. Uh, THE fact is that the, the

609
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:01.090
government is actually accountable to parliament, so it is

610
00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:05.739
up to parliament mostly to ensure that uh government

611
00:40:05.739 --> 00:40:10.129
uh stays in power. The, the electoral system, as

612
00:40:10.129 --> 00:40:13.929
you asked, is, is also, it has been central

613
00:40:13.929 --> 00:40:17.770
also. It's it's also one of those one of

614
00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:21.209
those legacies that we came from the transition period

615
00:40:21.209 --> 00:40:24.429
because the electoral system. As we have a closed

616
00:40:24.429 --> 00:40:28.250
list proportional representation system. What does this mean? Well,

617
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:31.750
it just means that we do not select individual

618
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.429
candidates. I mean, citizens vote for political parties and

619
00:40:35.429 --> 00:40:38.790
it is up to the party to decide um

620
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:41.310
the order of the can, uh, it's up to

621
00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.979
the party to decide the order of the candidates.

622
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:49.879
So the seats are distributed. According to how citizens

623
00:40:49.879 --> 00:40:53.600
actually vote, the percentage of votes that each party

624
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.560
gets using this old formula and the formula somehow

625
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.350
benefits the two main political parties, the Socialist Party

626
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:05.699
and the Social Democratic Party. There's also, we do

627
00:41:05.699 --> 00:41:09.300
not have an electoral threshold. I mean, electoral thresholds

628
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:13.500
are the limits. Uh, FOR example, uh, Germany again

629
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:17.189
has these electoral thresholds where smaller parties, if they

630
00:41:17.189 --> 00:41:20.459
do not reach a certain quota in terms of

631
00:41:20.459 --> 00:41:23.340
uh voting, they do not get to be represented

632
00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.790
in parliament. We do not have those formal, formally

633
00:41:27.139 --> 00:41:32.179
in law, but however, because we have Electoral districts

634
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:37.500
that have the different populations and obvious, obviously this

635
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:42.459
translates into different what we call magnitudes, which means

636
00:41:42.459 --> 00:41:45.860
that in some electoral districts, we only elect 2

637
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:49.090
members in parliament and in other districts we elect

638
00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:53.179
46. So this generates a huge divide within the

639
00:41:53.179 --> 00:41:56.739
country. It is easier for political parties to get

640
00:41:56.739 --> 00:42:01.979
representation in this bigger. Um, THE magnitude, uh, districts

641
00:42:02.189 --> 00:42:07.469
than in, uh, the shorter ones. In smaller electoral

642
00:42:07.469 --> 00:42:11.620
districts, the main political parties, the biggest parties are,

643
00:42:11.949 --> 00:42:15.149
they get this seat bonus, I would say, because

644
00:42:15.149 --> 00:42:19.429
they, they, they, they end up winning more seats

645
00:42:19.429 --> 00:42:23.050
than their share of the vote. WOULD, would suggest.

646
00:42:23.379 --> 00:42:25.810
So we do have this, that it is one

647
00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:29.570
of the things that actually explain why uh we,

648
00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.939
why smaller parties face so many difficulties in getting

649
00:42:32.939 --> 00:42:38.800
elected in this uh smaller magnitude uh districts. So

650
00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:42.260
in terms of representation, you know, the history, Portugal

651
00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:47.439
has this traditionally had and historically had these 5

652
00:42:47.439 --> 00:42:50.870
political parties that are elected through this uh proportional

653
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:55.070
representation system, but the last decades have demonstrated that

654
00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:59.360
things can change. Um, AND that the, the, the

655
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.520
Portugal, the Portuguese party system is also dynamic and

656
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.860
has been able to, you know, um, uh, so,

657
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.280
to see the emergence of the left block and

658
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.919
then more recently, the liberal initiative or the radical

659
00:43:15.919 --> 00:43:19.360
populist Party figure that that has been able to

660
00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.800
gain ground even in these uh smaller um electoral

661
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:29.229
district. I mean, uh, it's a, it's a dynamic,

662
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.919
uh, game. Things are, are constantly changing, but one

663
00:43:32.919 --> 00:43:35.399
of the things that is more relevant and, and

664
00:43:35.399 --> 00:43:38.689
I guess that Carlos demonstrates that is how resilient

665
00:43:38.879 --> 00:43:43.120
the party system has, uh, despite this, the, the

666
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.840
newness and also to some extent the attractiveness of

667
00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:52.290
these new political parties. Um, CITIZENS tend to be

668
00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:55.649
drawn towards new parties. The most interesting thing is

669
00:43:55.649 --> 00:43:57.969
that we were able to still keep the two

670
00:43:57.969 --> 00:44:01.370
main political parties as the main players in these

671
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:04.770
games, but I mean, who knows how, how things

672
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:06.010
can evolve from now.

673
00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:12.659
Right. Uh, WHAT has characterized the Portuguese economy for

674
00:44:12.659 --> 00:44:15.340
the past two decades? I mean, the first two

675
00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.979
decades of the 21st century. What would you say

676
00:44:18.979 --> 00:44:22.500
are the domains where it has fared well and

677
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:27.389
in which domains, is it still lagging behind other

678
00:44:27.389 --> 00:44:28.689
European nations?

679
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.840
Well, the economy chapter was, uh, was written by

680
00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:39.860
Susan Peralta. She's one of the most well-known economists

681
00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.229
in Portugal, and she does an amazing job in

682
00:44:43.229 --> 00:44:46.989
this chapter where she demonstrates that over the past

683
00:44:46.989 --> 00:44:50.860
two decades, Portugal has made huge progress in reducing

684
00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.629
poverty and inequality. So what she demonstrates is that

685
00:44:54.629 --> 00:44:59.399
we do have noticeable Improvements in these um areas.

686
00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:05.389
She demonstrated poverty rates dropped, inequality was reduced, uh,

687
00:45:05.399 --> 00:45:09.719
she demonstrates it uh tracing it back to the

688
00:45:09.719 --> 00:45:15.959
importance of, of income transfers. So the policies that

689
00:45:15.959 --> 00:45:20.840
were specifically targeted at distributing health and improving the

690
00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:24.429
quality of life of citizens. What she also demonstrates

691
00:45:24.429 --> 00:45:27.709
was the capacity of Portugal to bounce back from

692
00:45:27.709 --> 00:45:33.139
the economic crisis. So we, that we also um

693
00:45:33.629 --> 00:45:37.510
managed um then we also covered a couple of

694
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:41.919
minutes ago. Uh, SHE also demonstrates the relevance of,

695
00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:47.000
of taking stock of the European Union again and

696
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.030
the importance of the recovery and resilience, uh, plan,

697
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.919
that the funding from the European Union that, that

698
00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:58.800
has emerged as a golden opportunity to invest in

699
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.570
critical areas. As a green energy, digital transformation, social

700
00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:09.489
resilience. So these are um arenas that are falling

701
00:46:09.489 --> 00:46:12.129
behind. So if I was not up to now

702
00:46:12.129 --> 00:46:14.889
talking about the things that are positive, one of

703
00:46:14.889 --> 00:46:18.169
the things that uh Susanna demonstrates is there are

704
00:46:18.169 --> 00:46:21.600
areas where Portugal is lagging behind. One of them

705
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.320
is obviously the levels of public investment. I mean,

706
00:46:24.489 --> 00:46:27.699
one of the things that she demonstrates. Was that

707
00:46:27.699 --> 00:46:32.320
public investment as a share of GDP is, is,

708
00:46:32.459 --> 00:46:35.389
is just 1%. So it's really, really low and

709
00:46:35.389 --> 00:46:40.979
it has been this low since 2016. So what

710
00:46:40.979 --> 00:46:44.300
this means in practice is that things like transport,

711
00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:49.020
health, and the education system, it hasn't, uh, these

712
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.010
are arenas where they need a lot of investment

713
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:56.139
and these investments have not been made. So, uh,

714
00:46:56.189 --> 00:46:58.689
and we've talked about it when we mentioned the

715
00:46:58.689 --> 00:47:01.949
welfare state. Another thing that she mentions is that

716
00:47:01.949 --> 00:47:04.389
while all while all the other countries are dealing

717
00:47:04.389 --> 00:47:09.100
with this digital green transformations, while we are lagging

718
00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:11.949
behind. One of the things that she demonstrates is

719
00:47:11.949 --> 00:47:15.070
that uh some of the countries are actually pouring

720
00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:19.669
money into the renewable energy, sustainable transportation, and in

721
00:47:19.669 --> 00:47:23.030
Portugal, we are, the investment is really, really low

722
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:27.139
in those arenas. So one of the things that

723
00:47:27.139 --> 00:47:32.100
uh she concludes is that, well, uh, one, well,

724
00:47:32.139 --> 00:47:35.060
we made huge progress in some arenas that are

725
00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:39.330
areas that we still need to improve and obviously,

726
00:47:39.419 --> 00:47:43.860
and, you know, uh, well, uh well in 2000,

727
00:47:44.649 --> 00:47:47.899
while at the beginning of the 21st century, Portugal's

728
00:47:47.899 --> 00:47:50.659
per capita was higher than some of the countries

729
00:47:50.659 --> 00:47:54.260
in Europe like Slovakia, Estonia, and Slovenia, she talks

730
00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:58.550
about it. Um, ALMOST 20 years after that, those

731
00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:02.179
countries have caught up or even uh surpassed Portugal.

732
00:48:02.629 --> 00:48:04.629
And one of the things that she mentions in

733
00:48:04.629 --> 00:48:07.189
the book is that, well, one of the reasons

734
00:48:07.189 --> 00:48:10.909
that explains this, uh, the fact that we were

735
00:48:10.909 --> 00:48:14.830
surpassed by these countries was that we have problems

736
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:19.300
in terms of productivity of, we do not invest

737
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:23.879
enough in science and innovation. Uh, THAT'S also what

738
00:48:23.879 --> 00:48:27.739
um Joan Assad also demonstrates and obviously she also

739
00:48:27.739 --> 00:48:31.120
mentions that there's a lot of infrastructure that needs

740
00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.790
to be um developed, so there are, we have,

741
00:48:34.889 --> 00:48:37.919
uh, we are lagging behind in these arenas and

742
00:48:37.919 --> 00:48:40.159
those are the ones that are putting us behind

743
00:48:40.159 --> 00:48:42.469
some of the countries across Europe.

744
00:48:44.229 --> 00:48:47.770
So let's now talk a little bit more about

745
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:52.399
uh attitudes that people have toward particular subjects. How

746
00:48:52.399 --> 00:48:58.100
would you characterize social attitudes toward women, immigrants, and

747
00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:03.050
minorities in Portugal and particularly immigrants and minorities have

748
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:07.679
been Uh, at least it seems a very polarizing

749
00:49:07.679 --> 00:49:11.800
topic socially in Portugal in recent times. So how

750
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.040
would you characterize these kinds of social attitudes?

751
00:49:16.129 --> 00:49:20.050
Well, this, this is a chapter that Elise Ramos

752
00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:23.729
wrote. It's an amazing chapter because it, it, it

753
00:49:23.729 --> 00:49:27.750
allows us to really map citizens' attitudes and how

754
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:32.330
these citizens' attitudes have evolved. And not only citizens'

755
00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:35.929
attitudes, but regarding these aspects that you mentioned, women,

756
00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:41.050
immigrants, etc. BUT what she demonstrates is how, uh

757
00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:43.780
how we do have a lot of inequalities in

758
00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.679
place at this moment. Uh, LET'S start with women,

759
00:49:47.689 --> 00:49:51.370
obviously, one of the things that, uh, she concludes

760
00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:56.050
is it's that, well, we do, we also, we

761
00:49:56.050 --> 00:50:02.090
are still facing the wage disparities. We did, Portugal

762
00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:06.409
made huge advancements in terms of women representation in

763
00:50:06.409 --> 00:50:10.689
parliament, women representation in party lists. We made huge

764
00:50:10.689 --> 00:50:14.449
progress here, but women still earn less than male.

765
00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:19.040
Uh, THAN, than their male counterparts. So there's even

766
00:50:19.429 --> 00:50:24.129
Uh, as we deal with, uh, higher qualification, uh,

767
00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:28.110
profession in, in the arenas where these higher qualifications

768
00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:32.830
are required, we do find that women, and what's

769
00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:35.429
the least uh demonstrates is that women tend to

770
00:50:35.429 --> 00:50:40.510
win 25% less than men. So the in terms

771
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:44.110
of salaries, that's, that's huge, that demonstrates a lot

772
00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:47.219
about what the, how much we still need to

773
00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:52.320
um Uh, work in terms of, of gender balance

774
00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:56.409
and in terms of equality here. And then there's

775
00:50:56.409 --> 00:50:59.530
the issue of immigrants and the narrative here is

776
00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:03.489
quite complex here. Because as you mentioned, this is

777
00:51:03.489 --> 00:51:08.040
one of the things that has fueled populist discourses

778
00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.169
and so uh uh what she demonstrates is that

779
00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:16.889
perceptions have shifted. For example, with the majority of

780
00:51:16.889 --> 00:51:24.010
population in 2002 thought that um uh that uh

781
00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.439
Uh, I mean, the, the majority of citizens, uh,

782
00:51:28.449 --> 00:51:32.409
in, in Portugal still think that immigrants are a

783
00:51:32.409 --> 00:51:36.409
threat to the labor market. So this is something

784
00:51:36.409 --> 00:51:39.649
that she, uh, demonstrates. What there has been a

785
00:51:39.649 --> 00:51:42.209
growing acceptance, so the number of citizens. That believe

786
00:51:42.209 --> 00:51:46.010
in this has declined, but there, there is a

787
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:48.729
high level of skepticism when you find that 40%

788
00:51:48.729 --> 00:51:52.070
of respondents still, still think that they are a

789
00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:54.709
threat to the labor market that that is uh

790
00:51:54.929 --> 00:51:58.909
that is a lot in terms of skepticism. Uh,

791
00:51:59.399 --> 00:52:04.439
SO, so, so there are still citizens that think

792
00:52:04.439 --> 00:52:08.610
that immigrants benefit from social services more than they

793
00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:11.600
contribute, even though we have so many studies that

794
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:16.629
demonstrate. That how immigrants actually contribute to social security,

795
00:52:16.709 --> 00:52:21.669
etc. BUT the perception is that these immigrants, um

796
00:52:21.669 --> 00:52:25.709
there is this negative attitudes to attitudes towards immigrants

797
00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:29.300
because of the use of these social services. And

798
00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:33.540
also at least deals with how we also think

799
00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:39.209
about minorities, racial, ethnic groups, and the situation here,

800
00:52:39.379 --> 00:52:42.540
why we made some progress as well is concerning

801
00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:46.139
because one of the things that she demonstrates is

802
00:52:46.139 --> 00:52:49.300
that a lot of citizens in Portugal think that

803
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:54.120
some races are less intelligent. Some, some Porche think

804
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.050
that some races are born to be more hardworking

805
00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:01.500
than others. So what she demonstrates is there are

806
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:06.239
a lot of stereotypes that are still in place

807
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:11.270
and that to some extent, if you, um, if

808
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:15.860
these stereotypes to some extent legitimize the, the discrimination

809
00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:19.659
against these groups. So we did a huge progress

810
00:53:19.659 --> 00:53:23.179
in terms of Becoming an inclusive society and this

811
00:53:23.179 --> 00:53:25.860
links back to the welfare state and the relevance

812
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:30.689
of public investment, but we need, but there's also

813
00:53:30.899 --> 00:53:33.350
a lot of work that we need, still need

814
00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:36.540
to do in terms of changing the mentalities and

815
00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:40.770
attitudes that citizens have towards women, immigrants and minorities,

816
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:41.449
obviously.

817
00:53:43.439 --> 00:53:46.620
So, let me ask you now, what is the

818
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:52.189
current state of science and academia in Portugal? Has

819
00:53:52.189 --> 00:53:55.879
Portugal been performing well in those domains?

820
00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:59.639
Well, that's, this is, this is one of the

821
00:53:59.639 --> 00:54:03.370
issues that I was most curious about when we

822
00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:05.810
asked, uh, when we asked him and when Nuno

823
00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:09.350
asked Joannaa to write this chapter about science in

824
00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:13.050
Portugal. Obviously, me coming from academia, I, when I

825
00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:15.679
read the chapter, I recognized a lot of patterns

826
00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:21.030
that Joanna mentioned in the chapter. Well, what she,

827
00:54:21.199 --> 00:54:25.360
what she demonstrates is that this, we have this

828
00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:28.310
unbalance, I guess, because we have citizens that are

829
00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:33.120
engaged with science. And you saw that probably with

830
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:37.800
the COVID-19, how citizens actually thought that we actually

831
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.760
need, need investment in science and how relevant this

832
00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:44.739
can be for society. So we do have citizens

833
00:54:44.739 --> 00:54:48.219
now more interested in medical science, so we do

834
00:54:48.219 --> 00:54:52.419
have this, uh, citizens are interested in science museums,

835
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:56.459
we have this, we made this way. But then

836
00:54:56.459 --> 00:55:00.379
what she demonstrates is, is that things are not

837
00:55:00.379 --> 00:55:03.659
just about public interest. What, what she says is

838
00:55:03.659 --> 00:55:08.060
that we have uh a group of citizens that

839
00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:12.310
of scientific workforce that is highly trained. That is

840
00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:16.429
capable of competing in the international stage. We are

841
00:55:16.429 --> 00:55:19.270
now entering the stage where we compete for funds

842
00:55:19.469 --> 00:55:22.909
in the European Union. We are able to position

843
00:55:22.909 --> 00:55:28.120
Portugal globally, but we are still, we face some

844
00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:31.000
challenges. One of them is one of the things

845
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.840
that she mentions is the idea that we do

846
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.199
not have, we still need to have a lot

847
00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:39.639
more transparency in the system. The fact that we

848
00:55:39.639 --> 00:55:45.050
need uh institutions, public institutions to Uh, shared data

849
00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:49.250
so that only with um data that is shared

850
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:54.159
and transparent, we can ensure high public uh information

851
00:55:54.409 --> 00:55:59.649
and obviously uh deal with uh science. And then,

852
00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:03.610
and this, this is something that resonates these days

853
00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:07.260
is the issue of political instability. What she demonstrates

854
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:10.750
is that Uh, uh, science is one of the

855
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:14.520
issues that is mostly affected by this political, uh,

856
00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:19.810
instability because we have investment in scientific arenas that

857
00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:24.610
has been inconsistent political changes when the party changes

858
00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:28.969
in government are leading to instability and that does

859
00:56:28.969 --> 00:56:35.139
not allow. Higher education institutions and research centers to

860
00:56:35.139 --> 00:56:38.459
prepare for long term planning. So that's, that's a

861
00:56:38.459 --> 00:56:42.580
huge, huge problem uh in the Portuguese case and

862
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.699
another arena that we face is in terms of

863
00:56:45.699 --> 00:56:50.590
scientific publication. I mean, what. Demonstrates is that well

864
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:54.909
we have this uh capabilities we have this capacity

865
00:56:54.909 --> 00:56:58.590
in terms of our universities to publish, publish in

866
00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:02.189
international publications. We made a huge progress in this

867
00:57:02.189 --> 00:57:06.110
also huge progress in terms of, of PhD students

868
00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:11.570
that are. Uh, FORMED, but we, it's, it's as

869
00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:15.360
if we reached the threshold. We, we still, while

870
00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:18.110
we made huge progress, we are now entering this,

871
00:57:18.239 --> 00:57:22.040
um, uh, we are stabilizing but at a lower

872
00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:26.310
level than other, other European countries. So we do,

873
00:57:26.679 --> 00:57:30.550
they are still moving at a faster pace than

874
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:35.689
uh as we know. So, Uh, what, while she,

875
00:57:35.879 --> 00:57:39.280
while Joanna demonstrates that we have a huge hope

876
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:44.040
here because, uh, we, because we have citizens believing

877
00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:49.260
in science, I mean, They support science, but this

878
00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:53.540
is something again that can be fragile, the support

879
00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:57.729
and attitudes that citizens towards science. If you have

880
00:57:57.729 --> 00:58:04.350
elites. Mining the, the, some of these efforts that

881
00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:09.070
have been done. So this, the citizens support towards

882
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:12.949
science is also something that can change, so we

883
00:58:12.949 --> 00:58:15.270
still have our uh uh a lot of progress

884
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:18.995
to be We made here. We still have a

885
00:58:18.995 --> 00:58:24.074
skilled scientific workforce and we have higher education institutions

886
00:58:24.074 --> 00:58:27.854
that are able to compete internationally globally, and that's,

887
00:58:28.155 --> 00:58:32.304
that's huge from a country as small as Portugal

888
00:58:32.304 --> 00:58:36.395
and with um the, the problems in terms of

889
00:58:36.395 --> 00:58:39.955
public investment that we mentioned before. And then there's

890
00:58:39.955 --> 00:58:45.939
this political instability that, that. If not, if the,

891
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:51.409
the impact of political instability in terms of competitiveness

892
00:58:51.409 --> 00:58:56.530
in science and academia and, and being able to

893
00:58:56.530 --> 00:59:01.300
program in the long term is definitely something that

894
00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:04.939
will negatively impact uh the progress in terms of

895
00:59:04.939 --> 00:59:05.649
science.

896
00:59:07.679 --> 00:59:11.840
So among the many different kinds of indicators from

897
00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:15.879
a particular country that we can evaluate, we also

898
00:59:15.879 --> 00:59:20.399
have cultural indicators. So in that regard, I would

899
00:59:20.399 --> 00:59:24.600
like to ask you about the arts specifically. So

900
00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:28.629
when it comes to production and consumption of art

901
00:59:28.629 --> 00:59:32.750
in Portugal, what does the situation look like?

902
00:59:34.459 --> 00:59:36.580
Well, this is, you, we are now entering one

903
00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:40.560
of these uh chapters that I feel that I,

904
00:59:40.659 --> 00:59:43.110
I hope that I do a good job in

905
00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:48.540
translating what these authors have written this, I must

906
00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:52.219
assume that I am not an expert in all

907
00:59:52.219 --> 00:59:56.179
of these matters. However, the, well, however, the chapter

908
00:59:56.179 --> 00:59:59.120
is written for a wider audience and my perception

909
00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.409
about this chapter is that again, Uh, we have,

910
01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:08.100
um, uh, significant challenges in terms of production of

911
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.870
arts and also in terms of consumption of arts.

912
01:00:11.219 --> 01:00:13.939
Well, first of all, the production of arts deals

913
01:00:13.939 --> 01:00:18.939
with the, the, um, ever present issue of the

914
01:00:18.939 --> 01:00:24.439
limited resources. There are the resources available for cultural

915
01:00:24.439 --> 01:00:29.780
institutions, for artists are really low. Funding for the

916
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:33.699
arts is really scarce, and it, it really reduces

917
01:00:33.699 --> 01:00:38.340
the capacity of this artistic movements to emerge and

918
01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:43.939
to be consistently supported through time. And this is

919
01:00:43.939 --> 01:00:48.169
also what, uh, what the, what, uh, Antonio Pinto

920
01:00:48.169 --> 01:00:52.959
Rivera also demonstrates is that, uh, beyond the fact

921
01:00:52.959 --> 01:00:56.120
that we do not have enough resources for art,

922
01:00:56.370 --> 01:01:00.570
we also face this peripheral status that, uh, to

923
01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:05.810
some extent limits the capacity of the Portuguese artists

924
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:10.620
to be able to be present. In this global

925
01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:14.139
culture and to have access to international markets. So

926
01:01:14.139 --> 01:01:17.050
we do need here, we would need additional support

927
01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:21.459
for the arts, you know, art, the, the arts

928
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:25.330
and the cultural arena is one of the arenas

929
01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:30.669
where Uh, we find lower investment in our every

930
01:01:30.669 --> 01:01:35.820
state budget, and then there's consumption, right? So, uh,

931
01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:40.939
we'll I mean, Let's not forget that most citizens

932
01:01:40.939 --> 01:01:45.100
in Portugal still face economic constraints, and obviously this

933
01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:48.979
limits citizens' ability to, to deal with and to

934
01:01:48.979 --> 01:01:53.310
take part in these cultural offerings. Uh, SO, what,

935
01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:56.699
what he demonstrates in this chapter is that, well,

936
01:01:56.989 --> 01:02:01.340
how families actually invest in culture is more modest.

937
01:02:01.969 --> 01:02:08.469
And um. And uh while we do have pockets

938
01:02:08.469 --> 01:02:12.969
of, of cultural activities that are vibrant across the

939
01:02:12.969 --> 01:02:17.689
country, we have local art exhibition, communities that celebrate

940
01:02:17.689 --> 01:02:22.189
their heritages. ETC. We, he also feels that he

941
01:02:22.189 --> 01:02:26.340
also demonstrates that there are certain demographics, especially the

942
01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:29.219
ones that are more constrained in terms of, of

943
01:02:29.290 --> 01:02:34.219
the economic uh situation, and that generates low levels

944
01:02:34.219 --> 01:02:39.709
of consumption. And low participation rates. So, uh, again,

945
01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:43.350
we go back to the relevance of resources and

946
01:02:43.899 --> 01:02:48.000
investment in these areas to, uh, also encourage participation

947
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.199
in this um cultural arenas.

948
01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:56.870
So something that might not be so obvious, do

949
01:02:56.870 --> 01:03:02.780
cultural factors like art consumption translate into political behavior?

950
01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:06.899
Well, the short answer to that question is yes.

951
01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:13.709
Uh, OR let's let's think about this uh historical

952
01:03:13.709 --> 01:03:16.600
backdrop, right? So when we have this revolution in

953
01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:22.439
'74, we had this huge creativity and knowledge that

954
01:03:22.439 --> 01:03:27.800
was contained during the dictatorship and so after 74,

955
01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:33.760
we had Artists exploring the themes of colonialism, immigration,

956
01:03:33.889 --> 01:03:37.209
social justice in music, in the arts. So this

957
01:03:37.209 --> 01:03:41.699
was in the film, filmmaking and uh theater groups.

958
01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:44.649
So what, what he demonstrates is that there is

959
01:03:44.649 --> 01:03:50.620
this huge connection between these two. And then Uh,

960
01:03:51.239 --> 01:03:56.550
then this, this, uh, idea that, uh, when people

961
01:03:56.550 --> 01:04:00.580
engage with the arts, they are able to, uh,

962
01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:04.310
reflect the realities uh or challenge, uh, their, their

963
01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:07.830
perspectives. So what it, what obviously one of the

964
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:10.120
things that comes out of this chapter is that,

965
01:04:10.149 --> 01:04:13.189
is, is this idea that the arts can also

966
01:04:13.189 --> 01:04:18.340
be a way of political mobilization. Uh, AND, uh,

967
01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:22.389
but, but again, uh, with the limited funding and

968
01:04:22.389 --> 01:04:27.479
low cultural consumption rates, this can, this can limit

969
01:04:27.479 --> 01:04:32.129
the potential for, for the arts to ensure this

970
01:04:32.129 --> 01:04:36.439
political uh mobilization. But I mean, and even now,

971
01:04:36.689 --> 01:04:40.889
you know, that we have these movements uh about

972
01:04:40.889 --> 01:04:47.199
the, the colonialism, how, how we, how we behaved

973
01:04:47.449 --> 01:04:52.969
and how we have um adapt towards uh these

974
01:04:52.969 --> 01:04:56.324
countries and That also, that is also connected to

975
01:04:56.324 --> 01:05:00.544
the artistic aspects uh and how we took stock

976
01:05:00.544 --> 01:05:03.794
of this um of some of these arts of

977
01:05:03.794 --> 01:05:08.104
these countries. So the arts uh are, are, and

978
01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:13.024
the political issue is often within the artistic movements.

979
01:05:14.729 --> 01:05:18.409
So, uh, I, I noticed that we are close

980
01:05:18.409 --> 01:05:21.330
to reaching our time limit. So in the interest

981
01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:23.929
of time, let me just ask you one last

982
01:05:23.929 --> 01:05:30.600
question. There's this phenomenon of the Europeanization of Portugal.

983
01:05:30.889 --> 01:05:34.649
How has it been looking like and in what

984
01:05:34.649 --> 01:05:37.209
areas has it occurred and how?

985
01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:42.070
Well, this, this is the chapter by Sandra Fernando

986
01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:45.850
Jani of Alchea. What, what they so what they

987
01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:49.770
did, they deal with this idea of Europeanization, what

988
01:05:49.770 --> 01:05:53.100
they explained in the chapter is that We often

989
01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:57.300
think that the European Union is uh is the

990
01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:02.020
huge commander, right? Like Portugal has to adjust its

991
01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:05.610
domestic policies to what comes from the European Union

992
01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:09.020
and that's what they call Europeanization from top down,

993
01:06:09.139 --> 01:06:13.580
like countries adopt what the European Union asks us

994
01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:17.149
to do. And that generates some sort of uniform

995
01:06:17.439 --> 01:06:22.189
and this Europeanization is, it's actually uh how countries

996
01:06:22.189 --> 01:06:27.600
are adjusting equally their policies and institutions to align

997
01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:31.320
to European Union standards, but one of the things

998
01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:36.139
that I find most interesting. About their chapter is

999
01:06:36.139 --> 01:06:40.300
the fact that they do recognize that the, the

1000
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:45.620
country has gone through this process of Europeanization, but

1001
01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:50.060
the country has also been able to, um, has

1002
01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:54.219
also been able to set its pace and has

1003
01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:57.820
also been able to be involved and be a

1004
01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:00.719
key player in the European Union. And what they

1005
01:07:00.719 --> 01:07:06.520
demonstrate this key role is how, how, how politically

1006
01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:10.000
Portugal can still, I mean, they talk about Portugal,

1007
01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.159
but they could be talking about other countries, the

1008
01:07:12.159 --> 01:07:16.350
way that countries can still have a voice within

1009
01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:19.040
these institutions and they can also help shape European

1010
01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:22.879
Union policies and then demonstrate that. By talking about

1011
01:07:22.879 --> 01:07:26.159
how Portugal was the country, he was, it was

1012
01:07:26.159 --> 01:07:30.879
a key player when the European Union consolidated the

1013
01:07:30.879 --> 01:07:35.320
relationships between the European Union and Africa. This is

1014
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:39.919
basically a result of how uh uh uh the

1015
01:07:39.919 --> 01:07:44.800
result of Portuguese diplomacy, that's, uh, that's, uh, that's

1016
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.060
what they demonstrate. They also talk about the Lisbon

1017
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:54.419
uh strategy, uh, how they, the Portugal was trying

1018
01:07:54.419 --> 01:07:59.340
to demonstrate an agenda focused on innovation, knowledge base,

1019
01:07:59.379 --> 01:08:02.100
and this idea that it is possible for a

1020
01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:06.179
small country also, also to set um goals in

1021
01:08:06.179 --> 01:08:11.149
terms of unemployment, etc. AND then Portugal has a

1022
01:08:11.149 --> 01:08:17.580
unique stand because it has this, this rich huge

1023
01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:22.649
history related to the, the seas and that's why

1024
01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:27.810
Portugal was so relevant in building this integrated maritime

1025
01:08:28.169 --> 01:08:34.330
policy, uh, and, uh, it was mostly um because

1026
01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:37.770
of the vision of Jose Realdora Bros when he

1027
01:08:37.770 --> 01:08:40.919
was the president of the European Commission. That he

1028
01:08:40.919 --> 01:08:44.950
was able to bridge and to bring the knowledge

1029
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:47.359
and the history that Portugal had in terms of

1030
01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:53.189
ocean governance into the EU discussions about uh this

1031
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:57.069
ocean governance. So what I think is that while

1032
01:08:57.399 --> 01:09:00.790
the the European Union impacts every arena of our

1033
01:09:00.790 --> 01:09:04.299
daily lives, now it's impossible to think about uh

1034
01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.640
the majority of things that we do currently without

1035
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.020
the European Union. And that that was a strategy

1036
01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:14.479
that we, that we decided to go through and

1037
01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:17.379
to be part of the European Club when we

1038
01:09:17.379 --> 01:09:21.220
decided to democratize the country. But I think that,

1039
01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.660
that one, what I found most interesting about the

1040
01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:27.770
chapter is the way that Portugal is also able

1041
01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:30.859
to have an impact in several key areas within

1042
01:09:30.859 --> 01:09:35.520
the European Union and, uh, um, and so this

1043
01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.540
Europeanization has also, it also has a little bit

1044
01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:42.810
of a hand of uh Portugal's that is still,

1045
01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:46.060
it's, it's trying to still have a role, a

1046
01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:48.859
relevant role within these institutions.

1047
01:09:50.509 --> 01:09:53.770
Great. So the book is again Portugal in the

1048
01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:57.169
21st century. I'm leaving a link to it in

1049
01:09:57.169 --> 01:10:01.569
the description of the interview. And Doctor Patricia, apart

1050
01:10:01.569 --> 01:10:04.660
from the book, would you like to tell people

1051
01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:07.529
where they can find you and your work on

1052
01:10:07.529 --> 01:10:08.250
the internet?

1053
01:10:09.049 --> 01:10:14.040
Well, the book is, is freely available. You can

1054
01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.890
obviously citizens can buy the book if they wish.

1055
01:10:16.959 --> 01:10:21.879
The book is available through um uh flood through

1056
01:10:21.879 --> 01:10:25.879
the foundation and it's also available uh um uh

1057
01:10:25.879 --> 01:10:30.279
by uh Rutledge, the publisher that um managed to

1058
01:10:30.279 --> 01:10:33.720
uh to publish the book. The book is um

1059
01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.689
is open access, that's one of the things that

1060
01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:40.919
Uh, the foundation, uh, allowed us, it's, uh, something

1061
01:10:40.919 --> 01:10:44.959
unique also, uh, the fact that while, while the

1062
01:10:44.959 --> 01:10:47.160
book can, well you obviously can buy the book

1063
01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.160
and have the book physically, you can also have

1064
01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:55.319
access each of the chapters freely and, um, and

1065
01:10:55.319 --> 01:10:57.959
I, I, I just want to say that uh

1066
01:10:57.959 --> 01:11:01.279
how are you, how much I appreciate. I appreciated

1067
01:11:01.279 --> 01:11:04.169
having this conversation with you about the several chapters

1068
01:11:04.169 --> 01:11:07.890
of the book and that I hope that this

1069
01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:11.450
last, last project of the late Nur Montitle actually

1070
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:15.410
reaches what he uh thought about the idea that

1071
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:18.529
we would be able to think about Portugal and

1072
01:11:18.529 --> 01:11:22.370
how unique the Portuguese experience has been through uh

1073
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:25.649
this uh this, through this new millennium.

1074
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:30.549
