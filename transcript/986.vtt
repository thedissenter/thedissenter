00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:02.980
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:05.909
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lob and today Igen

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.850
by Doctor Sophia Force. She is a bus on

4
00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:11.890
a group leader in the Department of Evolutionary Biology

5
00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:15.119
and Environmental Studies at the University of Zurich in

6
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.604
Switzerland. Her research interests include animal behavior, comparative cognition,

7
00:00:20.614 --> 00:00:26.174
behavioral ecology, animal curiosity and innovativeness, social learning in

8
00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:31.325
animals, the captivity effect on animal cognition, developmental influences

9
00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:36.080
on cognitive development and the effects of urbanization on

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.849
animal behavior. And we're going to talk a little

11
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.509
bit about that today but focusing mostly on neo

12
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.470
phobia. All apes respond to novel objects, curiosity, cultural

13
00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:53.450
intelligence, the evolution of intelligence and creativity. So Doctor

14
00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:55.389
Farce, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

15
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.889
everyone.

16
00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.470
Thank you. Thank you.

17
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.630
So I, I would like to start by asking

18
00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:05.080
you about neophobia, but just before we get into

19
00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.440
the topic itself, uh how did you become interested

20
00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:13.400
in these aspects of ape behavior? What got you

21
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.269
here? Exactly. Yeah.

22
00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:20.120
So that started through, through my master thesis. Actually,

23
00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:23.760
I did a work with wild orangutans in the

24
00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:31.150
Forest of Sumatra in, in Indonesia and because of,

25
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.209
of the observations I did in how much they

26
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.150
learn and how much they are actually like exploring

27
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.010
their, their environment. I get very interested in understanding

28
00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:45.209
how they react to new things if they encounter

29
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.459
new things in their, the environment. Because it's a,

30
00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:51.400
it's a trait that is sort of such a

31
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.150
hardwired necessary cognitive mechanism for our own species. And

32
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.379
it just started by us trying to understand how,

33
00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:05.319
how they would react when they meet and encounter

34
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.309
things that they have never seen before.

35
00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:13.419
Uh, SO neophobia, I, I mean, just in simple

36
00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:17.080
terms would be the fear of the new fear

37
00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:21.520
of the novel, being fearful of novel objects, novel

38
00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:25.880
reps, people, novel things, novel foods, stuff like that.

39
00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.429
Yes, I think that as a, as a broad

40
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.399
term, you can see as a protection mechanism for

41
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.539
an animal or also for a human being for

42
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.130
that matter to not engage in something risky and

43
00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:45.279
because new things can be risky before we know

44
00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.029
them. We don't know, um, if they are safe

45
00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:50.460
or not. And so, you know, phobia is, uh,

46
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.009
it's not, it's an innate protection mechanism that, that

47
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.589
we have to protect us from, from that. And

48
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.130
you can apply the concept of course to different

49
00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.570
uh situations, whether it is, uh, objects and artifacts,

50
00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:11.729
new food, new situations, new social situations and even

51
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.889
new spaces.

52
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.830
And, uh, how do you study exactly how different

53
00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:22.210
ape species respond to novel objects? How do you

54
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.589
do it.

55
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.850
Yeah. So with the apes, it's um it's very

56
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.889
tricky to study these things in their natural habitat.

57
00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:34.490
Nevertheless, it's super interesting and important that we do.

58
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.830
So because that's, of course, the environment where they

59
00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:43.320
have evolved these traits. And in my studies on

60
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.220
this topic actually took start with studying the wild

61
00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:50.710
orangutans and their reactions on the neophobia to noble

62
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.690
objects. And we did this by making platforms up

63
00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.059
in the canopy, which is quite tricky because these

64
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.669
guys are climbing around the forest. And we had

65
00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:04.880
to, to make a situation where they can encounter

66
00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:10.320
something suspicious or something that triggers their interest in

67
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.070
a otherwise very familiar environment. And so we build

68
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.678
these platforms and they put up things that we

69
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.640
thought would be new to them, but nevertheless, not

70
00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.260
scare them away that even if we talk about

71
00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:27.429
new phobias, as there is a potential cautiousness to

72
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.970
new things, the aim is not to scare animals.

73
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.500
The aim is actually to see what is the

74
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.579
response. If something is providing a new inform informative

75
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.250
uh value. And by hanging up, for example, in

76
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.970
the canopy of wild apes, uh new flowers or

77
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.829
new fruits that they have never seen before, you

78
00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:53.369
can measure how likely they are to engage in

79
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.130
exploring that. And whereas with captive apes, you can

80
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.559
do this, of course, on a on a very

81
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.010
different level where you can provide them directly with

82
00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:07.660
things. So, so there's a huge difference in, in,

83
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.279
in the mythologies and the results depending on what

84
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.500
type of A I DS you study.

85
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.649
Yeah. And what can we learn from studying how

86
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.109
they respond to novel objects? I mean, is it

87
00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:23.989
that we are learning just about neophobia or are

88
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.459
there other aspects of their cognition, their psychology that

89
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.290
we can also make influences about by studying neophobia?

90
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.929
Yes. So it's a, it's a window into, as

91
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.029
I said, like the ideal situation is that you

92
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.089
trigger something unexpected for that animal. And then to

93
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.140
understand how, how the animal is reacting. When there

94
00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:54.089
is uh an unexpected situation with new information, we

95
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.779
can see multiple things and one is a window

96
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.070
into if they show curiosity. And this is something

97
00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:04.170
that uh the novel object test paradigm is just

98
00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:08.279
one dimension out of many, of course. But by

99
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.269
also understanding how animals are reacting to new things

100
00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:15.049
in their environment, we can learn something about how

101
00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:18.679
the environment is shaping them to when they react

102
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.209
by studying this across different environments within a species,

103
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.549
for example. And that way we get a better

104
00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:29.470
understanding for how ecological conditions or social settings impact

105
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.190
these kind of call them underlying cognitive traits.

106
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.670
And to get a little bit more concrete here.

107
00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:42.220
W which kinds of ape uh species do you

108
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.510
study neophobia in? Exactly. Yeah.

109
00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:49.040
So, so far I've been studying orangutans and there's

110
00:06:49.049 --> 00:06:52.989
two species of orangutans that we've been researching this

111
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.809
topic in the Bornean and the sumatran orangutans. I've

112
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.839
also studied the same topic with identical methods in

113
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.390
both chimpanzees and bonobos. So two African ape species

114
00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:06.190
and Asian great apes

115
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.140
and uh which kinds of objects do you usually

116
00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:16.420
expose them to? And what are usually the reactions

117
00:07:16.429 --> 00:07:20.339
you get from them in which specific circumstances? And

118
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.989
are there big differences in new phobia behaviors across

119
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.019
ape species or not?

120
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.600
Yes. So there's multiple questions that I would say

121
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:34.790
to if I can just tag it. So depending

122
00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:39.920
on, on the habitat or the environment, the setting

123
00:07:39.929 --> 00:07:42.359
where we're testing them, if we are talking about

124
00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:44.829
testing wild apes or if we're talking about testing

125
00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:49.059
captive apes uh will definitely change uh what kind

126
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:54.299
of objects we uh expose them to. Because when,

127
00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:57.899
when I started off with uh studying wild orangutans,

128
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.480
as I mentioned earlier, we want to create a

129
00:08:01.489 --> 00:08:04.559
situation where there might be some relevance for them.

130
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.589
So that's just not a random artifact. But what

131
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.209
if if something could be like a potential food

132
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.779
source or if it's uh something that looks like

133
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.160
something I had before? But it's not something I

134
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.529
know. So it's like in human curiosity, you have

135
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.329
a U shaped curve as well in how likely

136
00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:27.850
we are to become curious if something is too

137
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.359
foreign, we rather get scared. If something that's too

138
00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:35.739
familiar, it's not gonna capture our our intention and

139
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.179
definitely not spark curiosity. And that's something we try

140
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.200
to reach with the orangutans as well that we

141
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.780
show them new fruits that never seen before. That

142
00:08:44.789 --> 00:08:47.479
do not exist in the Sumatran rain forest like

143
00:08:47.489 --> 00:08:51.969
pineapples or, or for example, also plastic fruits and

144
00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:53.700
see how they react to things that they might

145
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.349
think. Hey, this could be useful for me. Nevertheless,

146
00:08:56.359 --> 00:08:59.229
be cautious because you don't know if it uh

147
00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:04.669
has any potential dangers. We also tested them towards

148
00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:08.460
um uh different kind of flowers that they do

149
00:09:08.469 --> 00:09:11.580
not encounter otherwise in their habitat. So sort of

150
00:09:12.429 --> 00:09:15.179
written in a natural situation, what if there would

151
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.299
suddenly be a new fruiting tree that they never

152
00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:22.080
had before breathe. If you go and test captive

153
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:27.780
apes, it's rather difficult to because their habitat is

154
00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:30.640
so different than they are used to many artifacts

155
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.099
provided by humans. So they have a completely different

156
00:09:34.109 --> 00:09:37.859
reference point from the start. So here, what we

157
00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:41.770
do is um not expecting a a strong reaction,

158
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.289
but we do talk to caregivers that normally know

159
00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:48.789
the background history of of these uh individuals on

160
00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:51.390
what would be suitable items and what they have

161
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.020
never seen before. And just like for human kids,

162
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.429
what we normally do is we just compose some

163
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.859
new kind of toy that because that object hasn't

164
00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:05.289
existed some, even if they might know some of

165
00:10:05.299 --> 00:10:07.710
the colors or some of the materials, they do

166
00:10:07.719 --> 00:10:09.960
not know it as such as it's composed in

167
00:10:09.969 --> 00:10:12.030
that particular study.

168
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.280
And so, uh I mean, let me ask you

169
00:10:16.289 --> 00:10:19.830
one question because you mentioned uh food there. Uh

170
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.849
IS it the case that when these animals are

171
00:10:23.859 --> 00:10:29.369
exposed to novel foods, they are able to identify

172
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:34.049
these new objects as food, as something they could

173
00:10:34.059 --> 00:10:35.710
eat or not?

174
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.539
So that's if you step one step back, if

175
00:10:40.549 --> 00:10:44.500
I see something that I don't never seen before,

176
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.320
and if it has the shape of something that

177
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.840
I might be eating, then at the first perceptional

178
00:10:51.849 --> 00:10:56.200
level, you cannot distinguish between food and object. So

179
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.349
you're gonna have to explore in order to find

180
00:10:58.359 --> 00:11:02.309
out. Now when it comes to, to eggs, they

181
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.909
have quite a high threshold of how likely they

182
00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:08.989
are to try new food because that's just simply

183
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.260
something you don't wanna risk when you're a long

184
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.140
lived species and you might not want to go

185
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.570
out and eat something that potentially could have been

186
00:11:15.669 --> 00:11:20.260
poisonous. So the there will be a difference in

187
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.760
how much you explore physically to actually trying to

188
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.380
eat something. And we see that not only from

189
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:30.969
doing experimental work, but also by natural observations where

190
00:11:30.979 --> 00:11:34.229
you can see that infant apes normally take quite

191
00:11:34.239 --> 00:11:38.059
a long time before they eat things like they

192
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.859
have certainly had enough exposure to social information to

193
00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:45.859
their mothers and others before they take the step

194
00:11:45.869 --> 00:11:48.419
to integrate something into their own uh internet.

195
00:11:49.369 --> 00:11:51.809
And, and when it comes to the differences between

196
00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.950
wild and captive apes that you mentioned there briefly,

197
00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.880
uh do they basically have o only to do

198
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:04.260
with uh the captive apes, for example, having been

199
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.309
exposed to a wider variety of objects and so

200
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.989
many of them, they no longer have neophobia reactions

201
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.909
to or are there also other differences here?

202
00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.950
Yeah. So this is one of the, the bigger

203
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.489
questions that we that I've been looking at and

204
00:12:21.979 --> 00:12:26.380
it's certainly multiple factors that uh play a role

205
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.969
to why captive apes would behave totally different when

206
00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:33.729
we test them in, in, um novel object tests

207
00:12:33.739 --> 00:12:35.799
or even also problem solving and stuff that we

208
00:12:35.809 --> 00:12:38.460
have done uh along the lines as well. And

209
00:12:38.469 --> 00:12:42.130
first, it's important that one think about them as,

210
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:48.289
but it's the same animal physically. It's a different

211
00:12:48.299 --> 00:12:52.739
animal psychologically because of the different environments totally shaping

212
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.460
them into, into something, taking them on a different

213
00:12:55.469 --> 00:12:59.599
trajectory and in your outlook on life and environment

214
00:12:59.609 --> 00:13:03.320
and, and everything actually. So, uh one of the

215
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.359
components, of course, environment by itself, like if you

216
00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:09.460
do live in a, in a zoo or let's

217
00:13:09.469 --> 00:13:13.010
say a wildlife sanctuary where life is quite decent

218
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.900
and you get fed every day. Um, YOU have

219
00:13:16.909 --> 00:13:20.359
in one way, the five star hotel, uh lottery,

220
00:13:20.369 --> 00:13:23.369
you know, you don't have to worry, you don't

221
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.739
have to forage. You certainly do not have any

222
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:32.239
predators and any hazards. So there's the risk free

223
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.940
environment that is one component to why captive animals

224
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:41.500
per se are more explorative and more innovative than

225
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:45.590
the wild Conspecific. And then on top of that,

226
00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:49.799
because of this risk free thing, especially in large

227
00:13:49.809 --> 00:13:52.700
brain species, what comes with it is that when

228
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:57.799
you don't have to allocate uh time to foraging

229
00:13:57.809 --> 00:14:01.549
or finding a partner or looking for shelter and

230
00:14:01.559 --> 00:14:04.169
all these kind of uh things that animals are

231
00:14:04.179 --> 00:14:09.950
totally busy in their daily life in Asia, then

232
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.380
that frees up the space that you have in

233
00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.289
terms of cognitive capacities and that sort of gives

234
00:14:17.299 --> 00:14:20.500
room for everything that comes comes from it in

235
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:28.289
terms of exploration, curiosity, creativity, innovativeness. So it's a,

236
00:14:29.099 --> 00:14:33.080
it's when you do not have that load, cognitive

237
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:37.630
load of, of survival existence, you are free to

238
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.270
do other things. That's another, that's the second factor.

239
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.080
And as a third factor, it's all. And this

240
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.640
is a layer that comes in because the way

241
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.700
captive apes, for example, particularly are housed in captivity,

242
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.830
they are uh care for by humans. And as

243
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.390
much as we like to think that we are

244
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.030
keeping our distance and treating them as, as just

245
00:15:01.039 --> 00:15:04.690
animals, they are close enough that they totally relate

246
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.289
and can attend to our actions and our behaviors.

247
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:12.239
And we are an additional social influence in their

248
00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.309
lives. And I think that has a massive effect

249
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.789
on how they learn to learn about their environment.

250
00:15:20.409 --> 00:15:24.799
And so according to the research you have and

251
00:15:24.809 --> 00:15:28.090
the work you've done, can we say that captive

252
00:15:28.099 --> 00:15:34.030
apes and monkeys are in general less neophobia and

253
00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:37.989
more curious than wild apes and monkeys or not.

254
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.059
Yes. So, I think that they are less neophobia,

255
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.020
uh, than wild apes because this life in captivity

256
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.809
has sort of eroded that initial neophobia that, that

257
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.890
they probably had, you're still gonna find captive apes

258
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.130
that show certain situations where they're skeptical towards things.

259
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.530
So it's not that you totally get, get away.

260
00:16:00.049 --> 00:16:02.650
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, AND, and I would imagine that

261
00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:04.909
perhaps some of that would also have to do

262
00:16:04.919 --> 00:16:07.789
with their personality traits or, or not.

263
00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:12.030
Absolutely. You'll find along the spectrum, uh, the same

264
00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:14.820
as humans, you'll find the apes that are more

265
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:19.739
or less and, uh, neophobia than others. And we

266
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.539
don't know, sometimes we can disentangle the reasons to

267
00:16:22.549 --> 00:16:24.599
why and sometimes we just can't.

268
00:16:25.479 --> 00:16:29.179
Mhm. And going back just a little bit to

269
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:33.380
novel food response. I mean, how do wipes particularly

270
00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:38.140
in the wild, evolve lower ne phobia when there's

271
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:42.000
a risk, as we've already mentioned here of harmful

272
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.219
and poisonous food intake?

273
00:16:44.869 --> 00:16:49.010
Yeah. So this is a, uh, this is clearly

274
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:53.479
done by a true social information because, uh, you

275
00:16:53.489 --> 00:16:57.020
have no single ape species and maybe not even

276
00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:00.599
a single primary species where infants do not spend

277
00:17:00.609 --> 00:17:04.040
time around uh adult role models in order to

278
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:07.569
learn the diet, I think, particularly with the gray

279
00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.880
apes where there is not only the level of

280
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:13.530
learning what to eat, but also the level of

281
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.010
learning how to eat because you need to understand

282
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:21.118
which species are, are distinguishable from others. And this

283
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.829
is not as easy. Like if you put a

284
00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.170
human being into rain forest, that a human being

285
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.020
is not knowing what to eat. So you can

286
00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:32.040
see how much information you need from, from your

287
00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.020
role models in order to survive in such a

288
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.000
habitat. And that's exactly what happens with the, with

289
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:40.989
the apes. And that therefore, I would say the

290
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.829
social information is a channel through which wild apes

291
00:17:45.839 --> 00:17:50.079
overcome neophobia by looking at, oh, if mom does

292
00:17:50.089 --> 00:17:52.359
it, it's safe, I can try to eat that.

293
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.380
But isn't there a a sort of paradox associated

294
00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.500
with how apes? And I would imagine also humans

295
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:06.930
deal with social information from an evolutionary perspective because

296
00:18:06.939 --> 00:18:11.619
uh aren't there particular cases where perhaps we would

297
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:16.119
be better served, not really being influenced by social

298
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:20.300
information coming from other kind specifics and just exploring

299
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:24.300
things ourselves or learning uh by ourselves.

300
00:18:25.189 --> 00:18:29.589
Absolutely. Like II, I think that's, that's uh certainly

301
00:18:29.599 --> 00:18:34.729
situations where it matters who and things like knowledge.

302
00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:37.329
Uh What's, what is the social information that is

303
00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:40.449
guiding you? Is it like experts or is it

304
00:18:40.459 --> 00:18:43.650
rank? Is it uh uh numbers like all these

305
00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.810
different social uh learning strategies that we find? Um

306
00:18:47.819 --> 00:18:50.729
THE research I've done so far is more towards

307
00:18:50.739 --> 00:18:54.670
the developmental stage of life. And I think throughout

308
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.989
the development, when you are mostly influenced from, from

309
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.869
mothers, all of that doesn't really matter because it

310
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.420
is still gonna be too risky to jeopardize your

311
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:10.010
own survival before you even reach reproductive uh age.

312
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:14.239
So you're still gonna go for a social cue

313
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.829
rather than uh than uh risk it on your

314
00:19:17.839 --> 00:19:20.479
own. And we do see this as well with,

315
00:19:20.489 --> 00:19:23.839
uh for example, with orangutans that by the time

316
00:19:23.849 --> 00:19:27.189
they reach uh uh sexual maturity and are also

317
00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:30.219
ranging slowly away from, from their mothers. That is

318
00:19:30.229 --> 00:19:32.069
a little bit of a window when they are

319
00:19:32.079 --> 00:19:35.229
more open to, to explore on their own.

320
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.479
And and so sort of related to that, but

321
00:19:39.489 --> 00:19:43.030
also talking a little bit more about uh apes

322
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.910
in captivity. Uh You've studied how their problem solving

323
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:53.229
skills are influenced by factors like housing facility and

324
00:19:53.239 --> 00:19:56.550
captive care duration. Could you tell us about that?

325
00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.369
Yeah. So this is something I think it is

326
00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.560
a huge thing in the whole research area of

327
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.030
great ape cognition. And I think it's super important

328
00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.209
that we pay attention to it is that all

329
00:20:09.219 --> 00:20:13.599
of these experiences they get from from birth until

330
00:20:13.609 --> 00:20:16.260
um we test them in for some kind of

331
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:20.020
research question. If this would be an wild ape,

332
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:24.410
we have some sort of ecological circumstances, shaping their

333
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.469
minds, then we can ask different questions. If it

334
00:20:27.479 --> 00:20:30.979
takes the lab into a captive setting, there's all

335
00:20:30.989 --> 00:20:34.469
these other experiences that feeds into who that individual

336
00:20:34.479 --> 00:20:37.619
becomes and what that individual knows. So like I

337
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.520
think what my research shows on a very, very

338
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.510
broad and easy level that we're just starting to

339
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.880
dig into this into more higher resolution. But depending

340
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:51.359
on which group of captive um apes you research,

341
00:20:51.369 --> 00:20:53.599
you will have a different result just by the

342
00:20:53.609 --> 00:21:00.150
fact that for example, research experience accumulates and therefore

343
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:04.170
they have learned from that experience and that will

344
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.300
affect their performance. So this was uh something we

345
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.250
found by studying chimpanzees from a century compared to

346
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.839
a sue that hasn't done any cognitive tasks. So

347
00:21:14.849 --> 00:21:18.000
by the sheer fact that they haven't gotten much

348
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.910
of those experiences compared to the other population where

349
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:26.630
it's regularly all kind of apparatuses. And so, so

350
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.349
in one way, you can say that as a

351
00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:33.199
research community, we are imposing a bias in accumulating

352
00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:37.349
their experiences. And I just started a project um

353
00:21:37.489 --> 00:21:40.920
where they are quantifying this. And we are, we

354
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.890
are creating a database where we track the experience

355
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.849
of certain age subjects so that we can actually

356
00:21:46.859 --> 00:21:49.500
go out and test for how much they carry

357
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:53.130
with them from one testing situation to another.

358
00:21:54.069 --> 00:21:58.250
Mhm. So we've talked a lot about neophobia here.

359
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.650
What about curiosity, by the way, fir first of

360
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:06.250
all, what is curiosity from an evolutionary perspective?

361
00:22:07.449 --> 00:22:12.739
Yeah. So neophobia and curiosity most certainly is interlinked

362
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.569
concepts if you look at it from an evolutionary

363
00:22:15.579 --> 00:22:18.689
perspective, especially when you start to, to study these

364
00:22:18.699 --> 00:22:23.849
topics in, in wild animals. Because if you take

365
00:22:23.859 --> 00:22:27.939
the case of the apes. Again, naturally, you need

366
00:22:27.949 --> 00:22:30.699
to be curious in order to pay attention to,

367
00:22:30.709 --> 00:22:33.060
even to your mother and to things that happens

368
00:22:33.069 --> 00:22:35.430
around you, you need to pay attention to. What

369
00:22:35.439 --> 00:22:37.579
part of the fruit am I supposed to eat?

370
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.079
How is she doing that with her fingers? What

371
00:22:40.089 --> 00:22:42.145
is going on? So you need to, to have

372
00:22:42.155 --> 00:22:46.535
some intrinsic motivation to find out things you don't

373
00:22:46.545 --> 00:22:48.935
know. And I think this is uh probably something

374
00:22:48.944 --> 00:22:52.755
that's quite hardwired in human evolutionary history. And all

375
00:22:52.765 --> 00:22:55.614
the great apes have a strong affinity, uh like

376
00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:59.885
intrinsic motivation to be curious. Now, what happens is

377
00:22:59.895 --> 00:23:02.295
uh the things we talked about uh a little

378
00:23:02.305 --> 00:23:05.755
bit earlier, like if you then have a habitat

379
00:23:05.765 --> 00:23:12.089
that is risky, like full of uh potentially poisonous

380
00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:14.459
plants or you might have predators and all of

381
00:23:14.469 --> 00:23:17.920
that then going around being curious on your own

382
00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:21.729
might be very, might not be an evolutionary good

383
00:23:21.739 --> 00:23:24.500
strategy because it simply will die off before you

384
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:29.020
reach a reproductive age. And so then protection mechanisms

385
00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:34.199
like neophobia keeps you away from expressing your curiosity

386
00:23:34.209 --> 00:23:36.780
just like that. Nevertheless, as soon as you have

387
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:40.829
a situation that is regarded as safe, that curiosity

388
00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:43.780
kicks in and you can um act upon it.

389
00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.579
And so this is where we talk about like

390
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.180
Hopia, high curiosity in these kind of species. And

391
00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:55.109
in captivity, there's a different source there's on not

392
00:23:55.119 --> 00:23:58.810
only the social component that wears down the neophobia,

393
00:23:58.819 --> 00:24:02.540
so that they can become more curious or express

394
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:07.660
curiosity in, in in many different ways, but also

395
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:10.500
the risk in itself since the risk, they never

396
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:14.020
had a bad experience. So, so that's like different

397
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:19.459
pathways that brings down the neophobia and the allows

398
00:24:19.469 --> 00:24:21.979
curiosity to be expressed.

399
00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.910
Uh So, curiosity in a way is also shaped

400
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.420
by ecological and social factors, right? It's, of course,

401
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:35.239
we have this innate tendency to be curious, but

402
00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:38.469
when it comes to perhaps understanding a little bit

403
00:24:38.479 --> 00:24:44.150
better, uh the differences across species and between individuals

404
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.810
of the same species, it's not something that is

405
00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:51.324
exclusively in or that we are born with, but

406
00:24:51.334 --> 00:24:56.084
it's also shaped over development by ecological and social

407
00:24:56.094 --> 00:24:56.685
factors.

408
00:24:57.074 --> 00:24:59.545
Absolutely. That's, that's what I believe. I believe that

409
00:24:59.555 --> 00:25:04.645
there's a baseline, intrinsic baseline for each species that

410
00:25:04.655 --> 00:25:07.584
they do have because in order to learn, especially

411
00:25:07.594 --> 00:25:09.395
if you're a species that live in a niche

412
00:25:09.405 --> 00:25:12.364
where learning is important. So the biological function of

413
00:25:12.375 --> 00:25:17.410
curiosity clearly is to aid the learning process. And

414
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.750
but there were gonna be differences depending on, first

415
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.930
of all, what happened during early life in terms

416
00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:26.770
of your own social input on what to be

417
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:31.410
curious about when and when and then the other

418
00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:37.250
axis of ecological factors constraining certain situations where it's

419
00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.540
just not adaptive.

420
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.459
Yeah. No, that, that's very interesting because uh and

421
00:25:42.469 --> 00:25:44.510
of course, we can get more into how we

422
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.400
can extrapolate from other apes to humans later on.

423
00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:52.310
But we have these very common ideas that, for

424
00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:55.329
example, when it comes to humans, there are certain

425
00:25:55.339 --> 00:25:59.209
people that are innately more curious and other, less

426
00:25:59.219 --> 00:26:03.079
curious. But I would imagine that probably the factors

427
00:26:03.089 --> 00:26:06.209
you've studied in other apes would also apply to

428
00:26:06.219 --> 00:26:07.000
humans.

429
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.109
Right. Yeah, I, I would believe so. I do

430
00:26:10.119 --> 00:26:13.930
think that there's a, a long standard psychological view

431
00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:16.410
on humans that it is this intrinsic thing and

432
00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.719
we're all sort of born with the same. I

433
00:26:18.729 --> 00:26:22.550
do think that a surprisingly little research has gone

434
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.989
into understanding what shapes curiosity in human Children. And

435
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.130
I do think that once we start to uncover

436
00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.250
that box, we will find that it is equally

437
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.890
much social input during, during those early years that

438
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.810
also set the stage for your adult levels of

439
00:26:38.819 --> 00:26:41.180
curiosity and interest in learning.

440
00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:47.689
So do other apes and non human apes have

441
00:26:47.699 --> 00:26:48.520
a culture,

442
00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:53.160
culture? Oh, absolutely. They have culture. Yes.

443
00:26:53.949 --> 00:26:56.949
Uh And uh I mean, in what ways? Uh

444
00:26:56.959 --> 00:26:59.869
SO, for example, in your work, I've read about

445
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.430
the cultural intelligence hypothesis. So could you tell us

446
00:27:03.439 --> 00:27:07.270
about this hypothesis and how it would perhaps help

447
00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.130
us explain how other apes and humans as well,

448
00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.890
by the way, have evolved a culture for what

449
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.290
reasons and so on?

450
00:27:15.949 --> 00:27:21.089
Yeah. So um the cultural intelligence hypothesis builds upon

451
00:27:21.099 --> 00:27:26.040
the fact that in so in some species learning

452
00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:31.170
is a strategy to adapt to that species niche.

453
00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.520
So you need learning in order to reach a

454
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.219
certain skill level. And this is the case for,

455
00:27:36.229 --> 00:27:38.780
for all of the great apes. So you're learning

456
00:27:38.989 --> 00:27:41.109
how to forage, you're learning how to build a

457
00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:43.680
nest, you're learning all these things. And because you're

458
00:27:43.689 --> 00:27:47.530
learning and because this, this period of learning is,

459
00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.030
is also relatively long. So there's a lot of

460
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.609
like evolutionary plasticity in this uh in this period.

461
00:27:54.619 --> 00:27:58.150
And that allows for culture to of course develop

462
00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.530
uh more magnitudes because when you have different populations

463
00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.569
learning different things, it's gonna pop up with a

464
00:28:04.579 --> 00:28:10.020
different end products. Now, the the cultural intelligence hypothesis

465
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.609
in itself builds upon the fact that you are

466
00:28:13.619 --> 00:28:18.790
learning from others. What's uh how to uh to

467
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.109
forage and what to eat and things like that.

468
00:28:21.979 --> 00:28:26.760
And while you're doing that, there is investment, of

469
00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:31.849
course, on an evolutionary way, there's investment in neurological

470
00:28:31.859 --> 00:28:35.569
tissue and brain capacity to learn as good as

471
00:28:35.579 --> 00:28:40.020
possible. And because evolution or natural selection are investing

472
00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:44.260
in that, in that expensive brain, you're also gonna

473
00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:48.439
automatically improve the things you can learn on your

474
00:28:48.449 --> 00:28:50.900
own because it's the same pathways and the same

475
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.920
neurons in your brain. So those are interlinked. If

476
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.829
you learn socially. And if you're provided with a

477
00:28:56.839 --> 00:29:00.660
lot of social learning opportunities throughout your developmental period,

478
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.219
you're also gonna become automatically better at learning things

479
00:29:04.579 --> 00:29:08.459
uh by yourself. So those goes hand in hand.

480
00:29:08.469 --> 00:29:14.099
And, and they also interestingly, the cultural intelligence hypothesis

481
00:29:14.109 --> 00:29:17.750
is one of those that connects both social intelligence

482
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.640
and ecological intelligence because it's about situations where you

483
00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:25.540
bring both, both things together, you're using your social

484
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.089
life in order to learn about your ecological niche.

485
00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:31.189
And that in combination creates for a cultural,

486
00:29:31.689 --> 00:29:33.890
a cultural species. Right.

487
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.939
Exactly. For a cultural species, a cultural niche that

488
00:29:36.949 --> 00:29:39.939
require that kind of input in order to, to

489
00:29:39.949 --> 00:29:43.290
become a competent, um, individual of that niche.

490
00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:47.069
Mhm. And that's very interesting because if I understood

491
00:29:47.079 --> 00:29:50.109
it correctly, I mean, when we think about culture,

492
00:29:50.119 --> 00:29:53.069
we tend to focus a lot on being able

493
00:29:53.079 --> 00:29:56.760
to learn from other people. There is social learning.

494
00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:00.469
But then according to this hypothesis, another thing that

495
00:30:00.479 --> 00:30:04.949
also improves is a social learning. There is learning

496
00:30:04.959 --> 00:30:06.239
by ourselves.

497
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.829
Right. Exactly. So like the way we tested this

498
00:30:09.839 --> 00:30:14.369
was with the two orangutan species that um over

499
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:19.150
evolutionary time, they've had a, a hugely different social

500
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.660
structure because of it all starts with, with ecology

501
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.540
like it does in, in biology. And so because

502
00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:29.180
of e ecological references, driving different social structures in

503
00:30:29.189 --> 00:30:33.910
two different um uh species or subspecies at that

504
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.410
time, um we then took it to the lab

505
00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.410
or to the captive settings where we know, OK.

506
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.780
Now we don't have any ecological differences, but these

507
00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:47.369
species have been separated for, for long enough time

508
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.540
that we can say if this has had an

509
00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:55.030
effect on an evolutionary perspective, these guys should differ

510
00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.260
in terms of all sort of a social learning

511
00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:00.229
abilities. So we tested them in captivity in a

512
00:31:00.239 --> 00:31:03.560
whole test battery of different cognitive skills that was

513
00:31:03.569 --> 00:31:08.510
composed of inhibition, control, reversal, learning tool use and

514
00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.089
innovation and causal understanding. And we did find consistent

515
00:31:13.099 --> 00:31:16.819
differences between these two species so that the more

516
00:31:16.829 --> 00:31:23.550
social sumatran orangutan species showed better problem solving skills

517
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.689
or what we call them higher intelligence in a

518
00:31:26.699 --> 00:31:31.630
broader uh concept than the born in relatives. And

519
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.599
we do believe that this is evidence for the

520
00:31:33.609 --> 00:31:39.300
fact these species have had cultural intelligence working on

521
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.780
them over millions of years and selected for slightly

522
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:47.739
different uh intellectual capacities. Or, you know, we take,

523
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.959
we, we're talking great shifts here like it's not

524
00:31:49.969 --> 00:31:51.949
that the others can't do it, but it's just

525
00:31:51.959 --> 00:31:54.270
the likelihood that, that they are gonna be better,

526
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.859
it's always gonna be s uh stronger. Mhm

527
00:31:58.079 --> 00:32:00.359
A and so I, in that the ca in

528
00:32:00.369 --> 00:32:04.630
the case of orangutans, do we also see differences

529
00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.459
uh in this particular case, we're talking about intelligence

530
00:32:07.469 --> 00:32:13.020
and cognitive performance between wild and captive individuals.

531
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:18.250
Yeah. So we do see uh differences between captive

532
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:22.010
and wild uh orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos, you name it.

533
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:25.160
I think any great ape is, is the question

534
00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:27.150
we need to ask is though like, although I

535
00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.329
don't think that those differences are that we can

536
00:32:29.339 --> 00:32:33.109
say the wild or captive are more intelligence, that's

537
00:32:33.119 --> 00:32:35.069
the wrong way of looking at it. They are

538
00:32:35.079 --> 00:32:38.410
better at the kind of problems we provide them.

539
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.140
And to do a fair comparison, we need to

540
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.689
keep the the environments constant. So like either you

541
00:32:44.699 --> 00:32:48.229
compare captive to captive or wild to wild, but

542
00:32:48.239 --> 00:32:52.150
they most certainly are doing better at some um

543
00:32:52.959 --> 00:32:57.609
cognitive tasks because of, of their inputs during ontogeny,

544
00:32:57.619 --> 00:33:01.020
during their captive life. So this is operating on

545
00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:05.689
over, I think quite strongly over their motivational pathway.

546
00:33:05.699 --> 00:33:09.500
So that by having had that human influence from

547
00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:13.479
early age, they also get more interested, more curious,

548
00:33:13.489 --> 00:33:16.920
more attentive to the certain things and, and, and

549
00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:20.369
that sort of makes them score better than if

550
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.380
you test their freshly, you know, you, you can't

551
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:24.880
test them easily in the wild. But if you

552
00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:26.810
test them in the wild, they sort of need

553
00:33:26.819 --> 00:33:29.569
to get to the same habituation level before you

554
00:33:29.579 --> 00:33:30.930
can do a fair comparison.

555
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.859
So this is also very interesting because many times

556
00:33:34.869 --> 00:33:38.319
when we talk about other animals and from an

557
00:33:38.329 --> 00:33:41.579
evolutionary perspective, we tend to have this very common

558
00:33:41.589 --> 00:33:46.290
idea that when we, for example, compare different species,

559
00:33:46.359 --> 00:33:50.949
each species has a fixed cognitive ability, a fixed

560
00:33:50.959 --> 00:33:54.500
intelligence and a fixed set of cognitive skills. But

561
00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:58.780
actually it's much more plastic than that. Right.

562
00:33:58.849 --> 00:34:02.339
Absolutely. I think that anything and I think it

563
00:34:02.349 --> 00:34:06.400
starts already in very, very small brain sizes, anything

564
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.188
is plastic and you can look at the brain

565
00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:11.310
as a little sponge or even as an empty

566
00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.780
uh you know, computer chip and you can program

567
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:16.969
it with whatever you like and the environment they

568
00:34:16.978 --> 00:34:19.989
grow up in is what's programming it with whatever

569
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.500
they know later. I think this implies the plasticity

570
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:28.438
increases with the brain size of a species. But

571
00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:33.510
it certainly implies that studying a species within different

572
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:38.110
habitats and different environments can tell us more about

573
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:42.708
what factors are shaping an intelligence or a particular

574
00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:47.239
cognitive skill rather than compare a species with another

575
00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:50.520
species that have maybe not had the same um

576
00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.360
evolutionary or the same environment shaping that scale.

577
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:58.219
Yeah. Or even assuming that uh a particular species

578
00:34:58.229 --> 00:35:02.445
has an innate set of cognitive skills. And that's

579
00:35:02.455 --> 00:35:04.564
it that they can go beyond that.

580
00:35:04.995 --> 00:35:07.074
They can certainly go beyond that. I think that's

581
00:35:07.485 --> 00:35:12.945
happening constantly that animal surprises with the capacity they

582
00:35:12.955 --> 00:35:15.425
have to do things if we give them the

583
00:35:15.435 --> 00:35:17.754
right circumstances or if they are moved into an

584
00:35:17.764 --> 00:35:21.675
environment where that capacities are boosted, so to speak.

585
00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:25.000
And by the way, I guess that this would

586
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:29.209
apply more in the case of captive uh individuals.

587
00:35:29.219 --> 00:35:34.209
But do factors like rearing conditions and human exposure

588
00:35:34.229 --> 00:35:37.810
also play a role in their cognitive performance or

589
00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:38.139
not.

590
00:35:38.659 --> 00:35:42.649
Yes. So absolutely. This is another thing that we

591
00:35:42.659 --> 00:35:46.250
tested with orangutans where we had um uh we,

592
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.320
we had something like about 100 different orangutans from

593
00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:52.800
different uh captive facilities so that we could avoid

594
00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.929
say like it is this particular experience they had

595
00:35:55.989 --> 00:35:57.800
because they grew up in the zoo or in

596
00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.780
this particular sanctuary. So we collected a bunch of

597
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.899
them. I think we had 14 or 15 facilities.

598
00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.409
And then we did an independent test on how

599
00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.929
just very simple, straightforward, like how interested are they

600
00:36:10.939 --> 00:36:13.870
or how attentive are they towards the human? And

601
00:36:13.879 --> 00:36:15.860
this is a human, they didn't have a relationship

602
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:18.159
with so not a caretaker that they know because

603
00:36:18.169 --> 00:36:22.199
that obviously biases their, their emotional relationship to that

604
00:36:22.209 --> 00:36:26.080
person. And then we took the scores from that

605
00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:31.389
human orientation task and related it to uh how

606
00:36:31.399 --> 00:36:34.290
well they did in problem solving. And what we

607
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.520
found is that actually like the human orientation they

608
00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:43.469
show could predict over the pathway through exploration. The

609
00:36:43.479 --> 00:36:47.679
more human oriented individuals would be more inclined to

610
00:36:47.689 --> 00:36:51.620
explore more to explore in a diverse way. So

611
00:36:51.629 --> 00:36:56.239
in a more creative way and therefore actually succeeded

612
00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.719
with problem solving on a higher level than the

613
00:36:58.729 --> 00:37:01.340
ones that were less human oriented. So I think

614
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:03.879
what we capture here is the pathway of things

615
00:37:03.889 --> 00:37:09.129
and how a captive life puts on AAA cascade

616
00:37:09.139 --> 00:37:12.600
of processes. Like you pay attention to different type

617
00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:16.300
of social model, you get inculturated in a way

618
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:20.610
it in its various broader senses. All apes have

619
00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.919
some kind of inculturate by humans. And that in

620
00:37:23.929 --> 00:37:28.919
turn affects your creativity, your exploration and that therefore

621
00:37:28.929 --> 00:37:31.689
you score more or less better over earth given

622
00:37:31.699 --> 00:37:34.889
what type of task researchers are you to do?

623
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.399
Yeah. And, and I would imagine that uh I

624
00:37:38.409 --> 00:37:42.030
mean, since we're talking about the effects that culture,

625
00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.580
or we talked about the effects that culture might

626
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:48.239
have had on the evolution of intelligence. I in

627
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:50.649
uh we tend to have at least in the

628
00:37:50.659 --> 00:37:54.879
West. Of course, this very individualistic idea of intelligence.

629
00:37:54.889 --> 00:37:58.300
There are people that are simply more intelligent than

630
00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:00.895
others and so on. But actually, from an evolutionary

631
00:38:00.905 --> 00:38:05.925
perspective, uh it is our sociality, our social needs,

632
00:38:05.935 --> 00:38:10.094
our need to acquire information from other individuals to

633
00:38:10.104 --> 00:38:13.155
relate to other individuals in a way. And not

634
00:38:13.165 --> 00:38:18.304
only our asocial learning that is learning by ourselves

635
00:38:18.314 --> 00:38:21.475
that has played a big role in us becoming

636
00:38:21.485 --> 00:38:23.745
more and more intelligent over time.

637
00:38:23.754 --> 00:38:27.850
Right. Absolutely. I do think that focusing solely on,

638
00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:31.689
on intelligence as, as um as one concept is

639
00:38:31.699 --> 00:38:33.429
a very old school view. I think we need

640
00:38:33.439 --> 00:38:36.770
to incorporate into the framework of intelligence. We need

641
00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:41.750
to think about emotional factors, social intelligence if you

642
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.610
like or social relationships and all of that fits

643
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.620
in because most of the time, we don't have

644
00:38:47.629 --> 00:38:50.649
a good measure of intelligence, not even for humans.

645
00:38:50.659 --> 00:38:52.790
So like what most of the time, all of

646
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.540
these things feeds into how a person will do

647
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.149
in a certain situation. And it is definitely, I

648
00:38:58.159 --> 00:39:02.100
think connected to underlying motivational factors.

649
00:39:02.729 --> 00:39:07.530
Mhm So uh going back to Orangutan, uh we've

650
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:11.479
already talked a little bit about how they perform

651
00:39:11.489 --> 00:39:15.370
cognitively in the wild in captivity and so on.

652
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:18.439
But in your work I've also read about other

653
00:39:18.449 --> 00:39:22.324
aspects, having to do with their life history and

654
00:39:22.334 --> 00:39:27.205
also the needing to learn hypothesis. So, could you

655
00:39:27.215 --> 00:39:29.614
tell us a little bit about that and what

656
00:39:29.625 --> 00:39:34.364
these factors, these aspects of their development might also

657
00:39:34.375 --> 00:39:40.024
play in their cognitive performance, the their curiosity and

658
00:39:40.034 --> 00:39:40.455
so on?

659
00:39:41.239 --> 00:39:45.800
Yeah. So like because orangutans like many apes, but

660
00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:50.389
they particularly are, are particularly slow life history, they

661
00:39:50.399 --> 00:39:54.350
show a very, very prolonged developmental phase and they

662
00:39:54.360 --> 00:40:00.070
take quite an extensive time to grow physically, to

663
00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:04.169
reach uh body conditions and brain sizes at adult

664
00:40:04.179 --> 00:40:07.959
levels. And this is an investment that is um

665
00:40:07.969 --> 00:40:13.189
obviously costly. So evolution, natural selection has to balance

666
00:40:13.239 --> 00:40:16.139
what to invest in in when, if this period

667
00:40:16.149 --> 00:40:21.300
is gonna take so long. Um uh THE the

668
00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:24.939
process on on when, when you're gonna be weaned

669
00:40:24.949 --> 00:40:26.520
from your mother and what you need to know

670
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.020
when you do that. So this is the needing

671
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:34.409
to learn. Hypothesis has stated that the apes need

672
00:40:34.419 --> 00:40:37.620
to be that grow so slowly because they have

673
00:40:37.629 --> 00:40:40.610
so much skills to learn. And it simply takes

674
00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:45.739
that time. It's an interaction. In fact, more coming

675
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:49.760
from the constraints of growing such a big um

676
00:40:49.959 --> 00:40:53.489
uh brain because we did find that orangutans at

677
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.610
the age when they are leaving their mothers and

678
00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:01.350
re reaching sexual reproduction, they are long ago competent

679
00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.489
foragers within their habitats. So that would actually say

680
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:08.239
like it's more about the physical constraints of having

681
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:11.729
a slow growing body, a slow growing brain and,

682
00:41:11.739 --> 00:41:15.709
and to get that ultimate peak uh of natural

683
00:41:15.719 --> 00:41:20.149
selection. At the same time, it seems that the

684
00:41:20.159 --> 00:41:23.360
complex the diet is so to speak, the more

685
00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.600
there is to learn, the longer you should stay

686
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:30.620
around your mother in order to reach sufficient skill

687
00:41:30.629 --> 00:41:36.540
levels before uh you are totally independent and sexually

688
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:40.489
mature. So it's a bit of a vote hypothesis.

689
00:41:41.389 --> 00:41:43.860
Uh By, by the way, just out of curiosity,

690
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:48.199
how many years do orangutans usually take for, for

691
00:41:48.209 --> 00:41:51.489
them to become independent from their mothers.

692
00:41:52.189 --> 00:41:55.110
So this is a species difference interestingly as well.

693
00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.090
So in the, in the more social species in

694
00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:02.090
Sumatra that also according to, to research records that

695
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:06.770
we have, they have a higher um complexity of

696
00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.300
their diet. They're also the only populations that show

697
00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:13.429
tool use, et cetera. They reach, uh meaning around

698
00:42:13.439 --> 00:42:17.120
77 to 8 years, 6 to 7 and, and

699
00:42:17.129 --> 00:42:19.850
independence a bit later than the born and ones

700
00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.649
that this can happen already between five and six

701
00:42:22.659 --> 00:42:24.969
years. So the bone and ones are, are a

702
00:42:24.979 --> 00:42:28.500
bit faster, have a little bit less complex things

703
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:31.840
to learn. Nevertheless, they are very slow compared to

704
00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:35.219
the other great apes and, and even to humans.

705
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.770
And, and I would imagine, I mean, of course,

706
00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.199
I, I'm not sure if this is an aspect

707
00:42:41.209 --> 00:42:44.620
that you study specifically, but I would imagine that

708
00:42:44.629 --> 00:42:49.870
the way we understand something like adulthood from a

709
00:42:49.879 --> 00:42:53.689
biological perspective is not exactly the way that we

710
00:42:53.699 --> 00:42:57.649
understand it. For example, in human societies, culturally, like,

711
00:42:57.659 --> 00:43:01.850
for example, saying that at 18, you're an adult,

712
00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.520
I mean, the uh I would imagine that from

713
00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:08.090
a biological perspective, it wouldn't be the same as

714
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:13.080
that sort of social construction of adulthood. And also

715
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:16.729
even when it comes to humans and other cultural

716
00:43:16.739 --> 00:43:20.000
species, it would also depend a little bit on

717
00:43:20.159 --> 00:43:22.995
the cultural input. It's like, I don't know, for

718
00:43:23.004 --> 00:43:25.854
example, if you're considered an adult at 18 and

719
00:43:25.864 --> 00:43:30.844
not 21 perhaps there are aspects of your development

720
00:43:30.854 --> 00:43:34.504
and in becoming independent that accelerate a little bit

721
00:43:34.514 --> 00:43:37.985
more but due to cultural inputs as well or

722
00:43:37.995 --> 00:43:40.084
I don't know if this makes sense or not.

723
00:43:41.135 --> 00:43:45.179
No, surely, I mean, we are like in biology,

724
00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:48.320
we always classify things according to to facts and

725
00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:53.689
measurements, right? So for most, for most animals, adulthood

726
00:43:53.699 --> 00:43:56.989
is defined when they reach sexual maturity. So when

727
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.850
they have their first infants, et cetera, and funny

728
00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.129
enough when you put it that way, that would

729
00:44:03.139 --> 00:44:07.310
make many humans not being adults even at the

730
00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:11.649
age of 50. Because if we only, we cannot

731
00:44:11.659 --> 00:44:14.750
take that if they have an infant, obviously reached

732
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.070
sexual maturity, that there is a lot of other

733
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.020
concepts that feed into what we see as adulthood

734
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:25.479
in humans that are completely culturally constructed. And in

735
00:44:25.669 --> 00:44:29.389
animals, it gets vague if we say like, OK,

736
00:44:29.399 --> 00:44:33.699
it's an adult individuals when it can forage at

737
00:44:33.709 --> 00:44:37.500
the same level as the mother. But most of

738
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:40.689
the time we use so much conservative measurements of,

739
00:44:40.699 --> 00:44:44.260
of sexual maturity. But it could be, I mean,

740
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:47.110
it's, it's nothing is happening over one night. So

741
00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.570
they are maturing into that. And, and I would

742
00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:53.409
say certainly with some animals, you see that they

743
00:44:53.419 --> 00:44:56.570
have this very much intermediate phase. I would call

744
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.800
it the teenage phase where they're not really willing

745
00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:01.760
to let loose. And this is something that you

746
00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:04.540
see in orangutans, they do range around the mothers

747
00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.929
to begin with. They stay around their mothers for

748
00:45:06.939 --> 00:45:10.050
life, but they keep the contact the much tighter

749
00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.739
when they are younger and then they dare to

750
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:16.209
take the step to, to generate their own social

751
00:45:16.219 --> 00:45:18.010
niche slightly away from her.

752
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.860
Yeah, I guess that this is just for people

753
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:23.419
to keep in mind the fact that the way

754
00:45:23.429 --> 00:45:26.750
we understand adulthood in human societies or in a

755
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:31.520
particular human society is not or is not necessarily

756
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:35.040
the same way that biologists understand adulthood.

757
00:45:35.709 --> 00:45:38.840
No, absolutely not. Yes, I totally agree with that.

758
00:45:40.209 --> 00:45:45.669
So we've talked about neophobia, curiosity culture. Uh What

759
00:45:45.679 --> 00:45:50.520
about creativity? What is creativity exactly from an evolutionary

760
00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:51.139
perspective?

761
00:45:51.149 --> 00:45:54.820
Of course, it's something that is slightly harder to

762
00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:58.669
detect in animals because you need to, to find

763
00:45:58.679 --> 00:46:02.379
a base of, of measuring it. I think it's

764
00:46:02.389 --> 00:46:07.330
um describing how much diversity we can find. For

765
00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:11.580
example, when we are measuring how animals solve problems

766
00:46:11.709 --> 00:46:14.489
and then we can measure creativity in that. How

767
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.649
likely is an individual to do different actions? How

768
00:46:17.659 --> 00:46:19.989
likely is it to come up with new solutions

769
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.139
and try new things? Even if it does not

770
00:46:22.149 --> 00:46:28.449
always lead to the solution. How much um diversity

771
00:46:28.459 --> 00:46:32.879
is it among the explorative actions? And what we

772
00:46:32.889 --> 00:46:35.139
do see is that if we dare to talk

773
00:46:35.149 --> 00:46:38.669
about creativity, but mostly we talk about motor diversity

774
00:46:38.679 --> 00:46:43.939
or exploration diversity that these things facilitate at the

775
00:46:43.949 --> 00:46:45.899
end of the day, how good you are in

776
00:46:45.909 --> 00:46:49.409
terms of performance as well. So, so the ones

777
00:46:49.419 --> 00:46:51.159
that get stuck on the same thing and I

778
00:46:51.169 --> 00:46:53.149
think you can relate to this as a human

779
00:46:53.159 --> 00:46:55.360
very easily. Like if you have, you're trying to

780
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:57.719
solve something and you keep on trying the same

781
00:46:57.729 --> 00:47:00.969
thing, it's not gonna happen for you. But as

782
00:47:00.979 --> 00:47:02.709
soon as you step back and think outside the

783
00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:04.969
box and you try to approach the problem from

784
00:47:04.979 --> 00:47:09.850
different sides, then you might have that aha experience

785
00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.489
and, and, and I think we can definitely pinpoint

786
00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:16.310
those mechanisms already in, in, in the eight relatives

787
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:16.969
of us.

788
00:47:17.989 --> 00:47:22.389
And, and so, uh again, in orangutans, uh why

789
00:47:22.399 --> 00:47:28.189
are they more exploratory and innovative in captivity? And

790
00:47:28.199 --> 00:47:31.550
I guess that here, again, there are some human

791
00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.129
influence that might play a role here.

792
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:37.820
Right. Yes. So it was certainly that they are

793
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:41.659
more explorative and more innovative by the sheer fact

794
00:47:41.669 --> 00:47:44.659
that they have more time less cognitive load, less

795
00:47:44.669 --> 00:47:47.340
things to worry about. But also because they do

796
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:52.750
have more experience with what enrichment of different artifacts

797
00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.929
of a kind and what it means to, to

798
00:47:54.939 --> 00:47:59.389
play around with things and the influence of humans

799
00:47:59.399 --> 00:48:02.780
and seeing humans doing things with different things, I

800
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:06.330
think sparked their interest quite clearly. So we have

801
00:48:06.889 --> 00:48:12.209
famous examples of uh individuals trying to Solway and

802
00:48:12.219 --> 00:48:16.820
the individuals are sort of um trying to copy

803
00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:19.949
their caretakers with cleaning devices. So you know, the

804
00:48:19.959 --> 00:48:23.870
information that they are exposed to is also the

805
00:48:23.879 --> 00:48:26.590
information they are gonna use within their own actions.

806
00:48:27.139 --> 00:48:31.280
A and then there's also things like positive reinforcement,

807
00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:36.889
right? And sometimes even humans themselves actively encourage uh

808
00:48:36.899 --> 00:48:40.469
orangutans or other or individuals from other species to

809
00:48:40.479 --> 00:48:43.760
try to do things like uh they do right

810
00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:44.600
to copy them.

811
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.080
Absolutely. Like they totally, you can motivate them. It's

812
00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:51.639
almost like a slightly uh like a dog like

813
00:48:51.649 --> 00:48:55.429
towards the dom domestication, they, they interact with you

814
00:48:55.439 --> 00:48:59.879
in order to, to perform. And uh another level

815
00:48:59.889 --> 00:49:02.899
is, of course, we don't know how to measure

816
00:49:02.909 --> 00:49:06.550
boredom. But most certainly like if you have time

817
00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.919
and if you're giving things and you have the

818
00:49:09.929 --> 00:49:14.040
potential to be a, a curious creative mind from

819
00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:17.189
your nature, then once you put in the situation,

820
00:49:17.199 --> 00:49:20.080
when you get to utilize that creativity, you're gonna

821
00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:22.469
use it. And therefore, I think we see a

822
00:49:22.479 --> 00:49:25.800
lot more innovation. Does it build upon the experience

823
00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:29.260
that they bring with the everyday life they get

824
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:33.290
according to the artifacts and enrichment experiences, we bring

825
00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:33.620
them.

826
00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.959
So what does this tell us about the phylogeny

827
00:49:37.969 --> 00:49:42.050
of creativity? Because creativity is something that we tend

828
00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:45.739
to associate with humans because we tend to be

829
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:50.340
very anthropocentric. But looking back into these other closely

830
00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:54.425
related apes like orangutans and more uh I mean,

831
00:49:54.435 --> 00:49:56.745
more closely related, I would imagine that there are

832
00:49:56.754 --> 00:49:59.604
also, there would be also be people doing work

833
00:49:59.614 --> 00:50:03.514
with gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos out there. I mean,

834
00:50:03.524 --> 00:50:07.475
what can we learn about uh by basically the

835
00:50:07.485 --> 00:50:10.955
phylogenetic history of creativity here?

836
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:16.679
Yeah, I think that by understanding which conditions, illicit

837
00:50:16.689 --> 00:50:21.449
creativity, curiosity, intelligence, all these concepts we've been talking

838
00:50:21.459 --> 00:50:27.260
about understanding which conditions uh spark these things within

839
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:31.379
our closest relatives is gonna help us understand what

840
00:50:31.389 --> 00:50:34.469
sparked it on an evolutionary perspective in our own

841
00:50:34.479 --> 00:50:36.850
history as well. So, and this is where I

842
00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.840
do think that the captive wild wild contradiction that

843
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:43.340
we do find in these research areas is quite

844
00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:46.570
useful because when we can show that it is

845
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:50.780
about not having to worry about risks within your

846
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:55.219
habitat when ecological conditions so to speak, allows for

847
00:50:55.229 --> 00:50:59.709
creativity to bloom if we find it even in,

848
00:50:59.719 --> 00:51:02.000
in species that don't have it in the wild.

849
00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:04.590
But that means they have a seed, they have

850
00:51:04.899 --> 00:51:09.310
a, they have innate prosperity or predisposition for these

851
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:14.379
traits already because they do need it in small

852
00:51:14.389 --> 00:51:17.540
levels. In their, in their natural environments. And once

853
00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:19.989
we put them in, in environments where there is

854
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:27.139
no restrictions, these skills uh totally uh inflate. And

855
00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:32.040
uh in terms of, of, of human history, there

856
00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:36.379
is these hypotheses that uh together with colleagues. Uh

857
00:51:36.389 --> 00:51:40.040
AND also uh among other researchers is that there's

858
00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:43.459
a certain point of time where we reach a

859
00:51:43.469 --> 00:51:50.449
level of top predation role. And therefore humans, we

860
00:51:50.459 --> 00:51:54.770
can use the captivity effect to understand or anecdotally

861
00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.949
understand what went on in human evolution by understanding

862
00:51:57.959 --> 00:52:01.000
that once we were lost, uh lost that kind

863
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:05.360
of cognitive load or it freed up and sparked

864
00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:07.050
creativity in our own species.

865
00:52:08.469 --> 00:52:11.330
Uh And so, uh in one of your papers,

866
00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:15.080
you also hypothesize that perhaps something like that could,

867
00:52:15.139 --> 00:52:20.989
could have been behind the upper paleolithic revolution, right?

868
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.409
Where looking back in archaeological, in, into the archaeological

869
00:52:25.419 --> 00:52:28.870
record, we see that apparently there was an an

870
00:52:28.879 --> 00:52:32.850
explosive increase in creativity and so on.

871
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:38.129
Yes, exactly. I think that coincidence with times where

872
00:52:38.429 --> 00:52:40.919
there's a lot more artifacts, there's a lot more,

873
00:52:40.929 --> 00:52:44.770
more physical creativity to be found in, in the

874
00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:47.840
fossil record. And that is also around the time

875
00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:51.189
where humans became the top predators of their own

876
00:52:51.199 --> 00:52:55.340
niche. So sort of we turned our natural habitat

877
00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:58.540
into the captivity effect. And if we see that

878
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:01.919
apes who doesn't have those constraints anymore, that increases

879
00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:05.959
their creativity as well. And on top of the,

880
00:53:05.969 --> 00:53:10.370
all of that environmental things comes the social inputs

881
00:53:10.379 --> 00:53:14.570
that also increase when you have a Cooper lifestyle

882
00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:19.100
and more sociality playing a role. So again, the

883
00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:24.689
ecology functioning together with the social components of things

884
00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.909
and in captivity of the apes, when you see

885
00:53:26.919 --> 00:53:31.550
an increase in things, their social niche is completely

886
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:35.350
different to, to a wild ape social niche, because

887
00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:38.350
of the level and magnitudes of social information they

888
00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:41.459
reach of different kinds, we can even talk about

889
00:53:41.469 --> 00:53:45.090
different cultural impacts in terms of a human, mixed

890
00:53:45.175 --> 00:53:49.284
with a more constant group composition. In the case

891
00:53:49.294 --> 00:53:53.405
of orangutans, you'll see that two orangutans are living

892
00:53:53.415 --> 00:53:55.455
in a group whereas in the wild, they don't.

893
00:53:55.465 --> 00:53:58.594
So like alone, those sheer fact is that it

894
00:53:58.604 --> 00:54:02.830
all fits into to how they learn and how

895
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.290
they're learning uh foster their creativity.

896
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:09.830
And so then it's actually a safe environment and

897
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.870
the safe space that allows for people and other

898
00:54:12.879 --> 00:54:15.989
animals, by the way to become more curious, more

899
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.270
exploratory and more innovative,

900
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:20.889
right? I would say so, at least in the

901
00:54:20.899 --> 00:54:23.570
hominid lineage, it might not be true for all

902
00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.429
animal species. I do think that there might be

903
00:54:27.159 --> 00:54:30.879
depending on the fundamental biology of different species. Uh

904
00:54:30.889 --> 00:54:34.280
There might be cases where the necessity is the

905
00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:37.409
mother of invention when you need to inhabit a

906
00:54:37.419 --> 00:54:40.550
new habitat. But most certainly for the hominid lineage,

907
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:44.870
I think we're talking about freedom is creating more

908
00:54:44.879 --> 00:54:45.780
innovations. Yeah,

909
00:54:46.929 --> 00:54:50.510
great. So, Doctor Force uh just before we go

910
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.750
would you like to tell people where they can

911
00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.110
find you and your work on the internet?

912
00:54:56.139 --> 00:55:00.120
Yeah. So I'm normally uh putting out all kind

913
00:55:00.129 --> 00:55:02.939

914
00:55:02.949 --> 00:55:06.300
