00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:02.980
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.820
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes and

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.829
the MG by Doctor Will Gervais. He's a reader

4
00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:11.350
in the Center for Culture and Evolution at Brunel

5
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.229
University London. And today we're talking about his book

6
00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:19.559
Disbelief The Origins of Atheism in the Religious Species.

7
00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:22.030
So, Doctor Gervais, welcome to the show. It's a

8
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.190
big pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.590
Thanks so much. It's a pleasure to be here.

10
00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:30.040
So, I've already talked on the show with many,

11
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.130
many cognitive scientists of religion. So I guess this

12
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.400
will be a fun one. FIRST of all, why

13
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.599
do you say in the book that both religion

14
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.970
and atheism are evolutionary puzzles?

15
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.619
Yeah, I really tried to frame the book as

16
00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:49.099
these being two related puzzles that we have to

17
00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:51.430
solve just as a project in figuring out how

18
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.869
human nature works. And our species is a bit

19
00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:56.110
of a weird one. We do a lot of

20
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.990
things that you don't see other members of the

21
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.830
animal kingdom doing, and a lot of our peculiarities

22
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.069
are kind of like an elaboration or exaggeration of

23
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.519
something else that we see elsewhere in the animal

24
00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:11.220
kingdom. Whereas religion seems to be pretty much confined

25
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.660
to our species, so basically every culture we've known

26
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.139
has had expressed beliefs in various supernatural agents. They've

27
00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:22.099
organized their lives around them. People are willing to

28
00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:24.019
fight and die for belief in these gods, and

29
00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:26.500
that's just not something that's widespread across the animal

30
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.199
kingdom. So one puzzle is the puzzle of faith.

31
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.620
So how, how is it that we're the only

32
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.029
religious species? Um, BUT religion, while it's universal in

33
00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.639
our species, it's not 100% universal. We have, we

34
00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:42.190
have a lot of people who are not religious

35
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.699
believers. Religion doesn't seem to be for them. And

36
00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:48.459
in large parts of the world, the numbers of

37
00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.470
atheists, and here atheists just means somebody who doesn't

38
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.980
believe in a God. THE numbers of atheists seem

39
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.370
to be swelling not evenly across the globe, but

40
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.139
in certainly large parts of the globe we're seeing

41
00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.620
more and more atheists, which is interesting. So if

42
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.900
we've evolved to be a religious species, why do

43
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.100
we have so many atheists? And I've really had

44
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.600
a lot of fun over the years trying to

45
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.380
use atheism as a testing ground for our theories

46
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.699
of how religion works.

47
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.949
Great. Uh, BUT I mean, you, you say that

48
00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.029
we are the only religious species, at least that

49
00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:25.050
we know of, but are there any animal precursors

50
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.509
to religion or at least some of the behaviors

51
00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:34.070
or psychological traits that we see associated with religiosity?

52
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.250
Um, YEAH, that's a fantastic question. I think we

53
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.110
could split it into kind of two. So one

54
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.389
of them is, do we see behavioral potential like

55
00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:48.070
religion precursors and other species? There, I think we

56
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.110
don't have compelling evidence of that. So if other

57
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.550
animals do have religion, they express it very differently

58
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.720
than we do. Um. I think the trickier question

59
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.119
is, are there other animals that have kind of

60
00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:03.160
some of the same cognitive building blocks that underpin

61
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.550
religion that might give us a capacity for belief

62
00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.679
and there I think. Potentially, I think we'll probably

63
00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:13.320
get to it, but one of the main cognitive

64
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.440
building blocks for religion in our species is it's

65
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.869
built on kind of foundations of social cognition and

66
00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:22.679
mentalizing and mind perception, where our ability to imagine

67
00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.639
gods is kind of piggybacking off of our ability

68
00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.289
to realize that other people have minds. And that

69
00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:32.250
kind of core cognitive mind perception ability, that one

70
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.410
we do see in some other species they seem

71
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.250
to have these, these same social cognitive faculties, not

72
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.169
quite as elaborated as ours, but if I were

73
00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.690
to bet on where we might see some cognitive

74
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.649
building blocks of religion, I'd say if we look

75
00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:50.169
in other social species where they've kind of evolved

76
00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.729
the cognitive architecture to track each other's minds, there

77
00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:55.449
we might, we might see some of the basic

78
00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:56.809
building blocks for religion.

79
00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:01.009
So before we get into an evolutionary take on

80
00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:05.679
atheism and religion and address the puzzles here directly,

81
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.050
let me just ask you about some common misconceptions

82
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.169
that I think come from some popular takes on

83
00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.130
atheism and religion that people have. So, uh, Of

84
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.649
course, one of them comes from Marxx. What did

85
00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.170
Marx say about religion and what do you think

86
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.130
about it? And of course, in this particular case,

87
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.410
we tend to associate Marx with the expression or

88
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.769
the phrase religion is the opiate of the people.

89
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.010
So what do you think about it?

90
00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:37.179
Yeah, the famous Marx aphorism that religion is the

91
00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:40.709
opiate of the people. He kind of had that

92
00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:43.910
to point out kind of how religion might lead

93
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.980
people to be docile and less than ideal living

94
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.070
circumstances. But within kind of scientific approaches to religion,

95
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.630
there's there's been some mileage off of that quote

96
00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.279
in just recognizing that religion seems to be something

97
00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:03.600
where our motivations are involved, and there are certain

98
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.079
living conditions where religion really seems to flourish. And

99
00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:11.200
if we look cross culturally, we'll see that religion

100
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.359
seems to do really well in places where life

101
00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:16.609
is a bit chaotic and unpredictable and uncertain. Um,

102
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.369
SO there's kind of a kernel of truth to

103
00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:24.010
that one, but I think it makes an ultimately

104
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.130
unsatisfying scientific explanation for how religion works, because the

105
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.010
fact that certain religions can give people comfort in

106
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.010
trying times that doesn't tell us that religions evolved

107
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.760
specifically to do that. They seem like a really

108
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.690
clunky adaptation for giving people a bit of peace

109
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.079
of mind. So what does You know, it seems

110
00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:47.160
like there'd be simpler ways to give people some

111
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.799
peace of mind than have them imagining elaborate pantheons

112
00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:53.170
and then having to sacrifice time and behavior and

113
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.440
lives to satisfy those. And I think also it

114
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.839
runs up against just kind of some inconvenient facts

115
00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.959
about religion in the world. So if it's the

116
00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:05.000
case that religion evolved as the opiate of the

117
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.279
masses to make people feel good and trying circumstances.

118
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.649
Yeah, sure, that might explain why we have supernatural

119
00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:14.570
concepts like heaven where, you know, this world's rough,

120
00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:17.329
but you know someday you'll die and then you'll

121
00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:19.709
get to live happily ever after with all of

122
00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:22.130
your loved ones in eternal bliss, and that sounds

123
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.559
wonderful. But then what about things like hell? If

124
00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:30.109
anything, hell's worse than our current world. So that

125
00:06:30.109 --> 00:06:33.100
seems a poor explanation for where religion came from

126
00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:36.630
if some features of that are recurring across world

127
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.239
religions aren't particularly good for people's momentary peace of

128
00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:44.630
mind. So the opiate account doesn't explain some of

129
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.829
the particularities of religion, like why, how come they're

130
00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:49.750
focused on supernatural agents, and it also doesn't do

131
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.040
a great job of explaining kind of. Facets of

132
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.630
religion that we see time and again, uh, like

133
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.649
negative outcomes, I guess.

134
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.839
Yeah, and not just hell, but I guess that,

135
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.880
uh, I mean, the opiate of the masses, it

136
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.519
seems as if it's just about the fun activities

137
00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:13.440
and distracting people from the bad negative aspects of

138
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.744
life. But uh there's Also things that people have

139
00:07:16.744 --> 00:07:20.614
to participate in very frequently related to, for example,

140
00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:24.184
um uh to, for, uh, to, for example, uh

141
00:07:24.184 --> 00:07:29.375
and uh credibility enhancing displays that are very demanding,

142
00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:32.500
right. Yeah, you can look at some of the

143
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.260
costly demands that big religions kind of invoke from

144
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.700
people, and you know, you'll have things like dietary

145
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.649
prohibition. Some religions say these are kinds of food

146
00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:45.989
that you can't have, or, you know, vows of

147
00:07:45.989 --> 00:07:50.019
celibacy, abstinence, things like that. So there's a lot

148
00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:52.540
of things that are really commonplace in religions that

149
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.140
seem to have nothing at all to do with

150
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.220
kind of comfort and peace of mind.

151
00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:02.549
And what about genetics? For the past, I don't

152
00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:06.350
know, a few decades, 23 decades now and then

153
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.859
we hear in the press, in the news, something

154
00:08:09.859 --> 00:08:14.109
like, oh, they found the god gene or they

155
00:08:14.109 --> 00:08:17.470
found the aggression gene, something, uh, I, I mean,

156
00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:21.100
they tend to oversimplify how genetics work and then

157
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.790
they call a specific gene, the X gene, the

158
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.670
Y gene, something like that. So, are there god

159
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.910
genes and does it make any sense at all

160
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:30.820
to talk about them?

161
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.950
Um, YEAH, so as you mentioned, over the years

162
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.950
there has been a lot of kind of behavioral

163
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.909
genetic looks to see if we can find some

164
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:42.950
genetic underpinnings of individual differences in religious fervor. And

165
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.590
some of those efforts have been reasonably successful where

166
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.030
people can say, right, it does look like kind

167
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.989
of strength of religiosity is heritable. It seems to

168
00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:54.590
run in families more than you'd expect. Um, BUT

169
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.869
I guess for me the problem with genetic studies

170
00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:58.909
is that they're answering a different question than the

171
00:08:58.909 --> 00:09:01.989
one I'd like to answer. So Genetic studies are

172
00:09:01.989 --> 00:09:06.000
about kind of the physical encoding of religious impulses,

173
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.450
so we might be able to figure out that

174
00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:12.520
some, some alleles might code for underlying traits that

175
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.400
make people susceptible to being more religious or less

176
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.520
religious, whereas what I'm really interested in in answering

177
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.359
the puzzle of faith is, well, how is it

178
00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:22.599
and why did our species evolve to be the

179
00:09:22.599 --> 00:09:26.369
only religious one. Um, AND from my perspective, the

180
00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:28.650
genetic stuff is great. It's super important. It's just

181
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.280
answering a different question. It's asking how this stuff

182
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.890
is encoded, but it's not, it's not answering those

183
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.929
ultimate why questions of why did religion evolve in

184
00:09:38.929 --> 00:09:42.330
our species. So yeah, it's useful work, but it's

185
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.609
operating at kind of a mechanistic level instead of

186
00:09:44.609 --> 00:09:46.080
a broader evolutionary level.

187
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.000
And so it's, of course, just by itself not

188
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.820
good enough to explain religion as a phenomenon, right?

189
00:09:55.549 --> 00:09:57.700
Yeah, and most of the behavioral genetic work is

190
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.820
looking at like individual differences in kind of religious

191
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.299
fervor, which is great. It's important to study that,

192
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.820
but it's very different from trying to figure out,

193
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.099
you know, how come we have religion and echidnas

194
00:10:10.099 --> 00:10:13.140
don't have religion. Obviously genes will be involved in

195
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.210
that because that's, you know, in genetic evolution that's

196
00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:20.260
what tracks species divergence, but figuring out the genes

197
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
won't necessarily tell us how we got there.

198
00:10:23.549 --> 00:10:25.739
OK, so now let's talk a little bit about

199
00:10:25.739 --> 00:10:29.130
the new wave fists because they have some very

200
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.450
interesting and particular takes on religion and I have

201
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.049
2 or 3 claims made by them here. So,

202
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.780
starting with one made uh specifically by Richard Dawkins

203
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.140
and this theory that religion is the result of

204
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.219
childhood gullibility. I mean, is there any, does it

205
00:10:47.219 --> 00:10:48.380
hold any water?

206
00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:52.010
Yeah, so that's, that's kind of an idea that

207
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.469
he sketched out first in the God delusion and

208
00:10:54.469 --> 00:10:57.359
then about 15 years later in his second religion

209
00:10:57.359 --> 00:11:02.039
book Outgrowing God. And he doesn't frame it as,

210
00:11:02.049 --> 00:11:03.690
you know, we've proven this, but he kind of

211
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.530
says, hey, here's an idea I like. And how

212
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.489
he puts it is, you know, our species, we

213
00:11:10.489 --> 00:11:13.049
need to like members of our species need to

214
00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:15.359
learn how to survive and thrive in the world.

215
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.650
And there's threats out there that we can't try

216
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.669
to figure out just through trial and error. So,

217
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.049
you know, are there predators down in the river

218
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:23.890
where we get our water? Is there a crocodile

219
00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.940
in there? Are there jaguars in this patch of

220
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.940
forest? Um, I, I could try to learn that

221
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.299
through trial and error, but the errors are fatal,

222
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.780
so that's not going to be great. Um, IN

223
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.489
a social species like ours, we can rely on

224
00:11:36.489 --> 00:11:39.349
information that other people give us, and that's hugely

225
00:11:39.349 --> 00:11:42.619
important for us. So in the Dawkins model, the

226
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:46.020
way he sketched it out, he said, maybe our

227
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.820
species evolved so that kids just kind of are

228
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.650
blindly credulous and gullible when it comes to stuff

229
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.229
that their parents and elders tell them. So maybe

230
00:11:54.229 --> 00:11:56.719
we've evolved to have a mental shortcut that just

231
00:11:56.719 --> 00:11:59.520
says believe whatever mom and dad tell you or

232
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.799
your grandparents or whoever in your community is kind

233
00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:05.539
of like those respected authority figures and you just

234
00:12:05.539 --> 00:12:08.859
blindly defer to whatever they say and Dawkins explicitly

235
00:12:08.859 --> 00:12:10.880
says, you know, these kids would have no way

236
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.520
to distinguish between good information and bad. So we're

237
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.080
overly credulous, overly gullible, and because kind of bad

238
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.799
information can sneak along for the ride. Um, MAYBE

239
00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:25.039
that's how religions just kind of piggyback on this

240
00:12:25.039 --> 00:12:27.679
gullibility, and it's really easy for kids to just

241
00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:30.390
tell their parents like, yep, there's jaguars over there.

242
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.239
You've got to avoid that patch of the stream

243
00:12:32.239 --> 00:12:36.440
because there's crocodiles. Also there's these forest spirits and

244
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.840
you have to worship them this way and this

245
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.030
way. And then the kids would say, OK, I'm

246
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.479
just going to believe these things. I'm not sifting

247
00:12:43.479 --> 00:12:45.280
them into some of these are factual claims about

248
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.919
the world. Some of them are supernatural claims. Kids

249
00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:51.140
just broad spectrum believe whatever they're told. And I

250
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:55.809
think this does on the surface sound plausible, and

251
00:12:56.219 --> 00:12:58.140
you know he's an excellent writer, so I think

252
00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.979
it sounds rhetorically compelling when he lays it out

253
00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:04.460
on the page. The problem is, um, we can

254
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.500
turn to the scientific subdisciplines that actually study this

255
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.330
stuff, um, and so we could look at, say,

256
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.049
cultural evolution is a scientific subfield where we're trying

257
00:13:15.049 --> 00:13:18.179
to apply the tools of evolutionary biology to cultural

258
00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:22.440
information. And it uses formal modeling and computer simulations

259
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.080
and real world observation. So it's the field that

260
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.450
is all about how do people culturally learn from

261
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.049
each other. And if we turn to theory in

262
00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:33.440
that in that line of work and say, well,

263
00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.789
how about this initial assumption that Dawkins has? Is

264
00:13:36.789 --> 00:13:40.359
it, would we expect our species or any other

265
00:13:40.359 --> 00:13:43.409
to evolve such that kids are just blindly gullible

266
00:13:43.409 --> 00:13:46.159
and believe whatever their parents tell them? Um, AND

267
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.900
pretty quickly the theory would say no. We wouldn't

268
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.520
expect anybody to evolve to just blindly believe whatever

269
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.679
they're told. In the same way we wouldn't expect

270
00:13:55.679 --> 00:13:59.119
universal cooperation to solve, which is like something he

271
00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:01.919
wrote all of the selfish genes about why we

272
00:14:01.969 --> 00:14:06.520
wouldn't expect kind of uncritical altruists to take over

273
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.520
in populations because they're suckers. They're easily exploited, and

274
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.440
I think the gullible kids model is just building

275
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.599
that into our kids. It's making, it's positing a

276
00:14:14.599 --> 00:14:17.799
psychology that's too easily exploitable to have ever really

277
00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:21.049
evolved. Um, SO it doesn't pass the theoretical smell

278
00:14:21.049 --> 00:14:23.890
test from cultural evolution. Now we could try the

279
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.690
empirical smell test of we could turn to instead

280
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.690
of cultural evolution, we could now turn to developmental

281
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.739
psychology. So these are the people who are actually

282
00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:34.409
studying children. How do children learn? How do children

283
00:14:34.409 --> 00:14:37.320
think about facts? How do children form beliefs and,

284
00:14:37.729 --> 00:14:40.760
and so on. And if we look at Evidence

285
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.719
from that line of work. So the Dawkins model

286
00:14:42.719 --> 00:14:45.630
says, well, kids won't have any way to sift

287
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.429
good information from bad. So you have good factual

288
00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:50.840
information about where the predators are and then junk

289
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.119
religious stuff in the Dawkins model, and he's saying

290
00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:56.320
kids can't tell the difference between those, so they

291
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.380
just believe everything. Turns out if you, if you

292
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.979
check the developmental psychology work, kids are really good

293
00:15:01.979 --> 00:15:04.739
at sorting things into a fact pile and an

294
00:15:04.739 --> 00:15:07.599
opinion pile. Um, HERE'S a fiction pile, you can

295
00:15:07.599 --> 00:15:09.750
get kids to, for instance, you could ask them,

296
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.340
you know, does SpongeBob, what does SpongeBob think about

297
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.849
Batman? So they're thinking about fictional characters. They know

298
00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:18.979
they're both fictional and they can imagine the beliefs

299
00:15:18.979 --> 00:15:21.909
of these fictional characters. And they're never confused about

300
00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:24.989
whether these characters are real. They know that there's

301
00:15:24.989 --> 00:15:27.549
no no Batman out there. They know there's no

302
00:15:27.549 --> 00:15:31.549
SpongeBob. Um, SO when we check the developmental psychology

303
00:15:31.549 --> 00:15:34.150
evidence, we see kids are pretty good at sorting

304
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.909
things into fact piles and opinion piles or fact

305
00:15:36.909 --> 00:15:41.820
and fiction piles, and people like Larissa Hai Solomon

306
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.500
and developmental like when they ask kids about, well,

307
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.909
where, where do religious beliefs fit? Do they go

308
00:15:46.909 --> 00:15:49.030
in the fact pile? Do they go in this

309
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:52.900
kind of other weird opinion fiction pile? They, they

310
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.020
put religion kind of in the middle. They don't

311
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.219
know what to do with it. Religious claims are

312
00:15:57.219 --> 00:16:00.940
not quite facts. They're not just opinions, um, which

313
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.580
is super interesting work. I highly recommend people check

314
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.140
it out, but it directly contradicts what Dawkins is

315
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.210
saying about how kids learn. Um, SO I think

316
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.789
the childhood gullibility model that he floated in two

317
00:16:12.789 --> 00:16:16.869
books across 15 years was never all that theoretically

318
00:16:16.869 --> 00:16:19.820
plausible when you look at the cultural evolution literature

319
00:16:20.109 --> 00:16:23.349
and empirically it just describes a child psychology that's

320
00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:25.909
very different from what the last 40 to 50

321
00:16:25.909 --> 00:16:28.739
years of developmental psychology would tell us to expect.

322
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.900
And I also think, and please correct me if

323
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.890
I'm wrong, but if we were going to explain

324
00:16:36.219 --> 00:16:40.940
religious beliefs on the basis of childhood gullibility, wouldn't

325
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.340
we also have to explain how was it that,

326
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:50.265
uh, people would go from childhood, childhood. UP to

327
00:16:50.265 --> 00:16:55.544
adulthood without changing their beliefs, without developing new, at

328
00:16:55.544 --> 00:17:00.025
least new cognitive cognitive mechanisms to then be able

329
00:17:00.025 --> 00:17:03.344
to perhaps question some of the things they were

330
00:17:03.344 --> 00:17:07.055
told when they were younger. I mean, wouldn't, uh,

331
00:17:07.064 --> 00:17:09.145
Dawkins also have to explain that?

332
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.939
Yeah, absolutely. So it fundamentally posits static psychology where

333
00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:16.780
a belief gets locked in in childhood and then

334
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.819
it's there forever. But I mean, if you talk

335
00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.939
to kids, their beliefs and attitudes will change massively

336
00:17:22.939 --> 00:17:26.020
from year to year. So imagining that much gets

337
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.979
locked in from gullible kids stage through the lifespan

338
00:17:29.979 --> 00:17:32.390
just doesn't seem super plausible to me.

339
00:17:34.209 --> 00:17:37.290
So another thing that the new atheists claim, and

340
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:41.060
this is sort of common among atheists in general,

341
00:17:41.199 --> 00:17:46.329
is that atheism is more rational than religion. So

342
00:17:46.329 --> 00:17:48.689
what does science have to say about that?

343
00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:52.680
Yeah, I mean that's, that's, I would say certainly

344
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.359
out of new atheist land that's their dominant explanation

345
00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:58.589
of where atheism comes from. It's, you know, well,

346
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.359
how did we become atheists? Well, religion's irrational, and

347
00:18:03.359 --> 00:18:05.609
I'm a rational person and I'm smart enough to

348
00:18:05.609 --> 00:18:08.319
see through the religious flim plan and that's why

349
00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:13.310
I'm an atheist. And in our scientific work, I

350
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.989
mean, I can't directly make claims on is religion

351
00:18:16.989 --> 00:18:19.949
rational, but I can ask kind of the psychological

352
00:18:19.949 --> 00:18:22.790
question of does it seem to be the case

353
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.510
that individual rationality is a good explanation for where

354
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.349
atheism comes from. So now instead of trying to

355
00:18:29.349 --> 00:18:31.709
make claims about religion, I'm trying to make claims

356
00:18:31.709 --> 00:18:35.989
of how do people become religious or atheists and

357
00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:39.890
so In their model, we could sensibly predict that

358
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.359
well if rationality is really the key to atheism,

359
00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:46.770
we'd expect for instance that people who seem to

360
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.609
be a bit better at rational thinking are going

361
00:18:48.609 --> 00:18:52.449
to be more likely to be atheists. Everybody, we

362
00:18:52.449 --> 00:18:56.010
have kind of different ways to process information, and

363
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.010
one of them is kind of effortful, rational thinking.

364
00:18:59.369 --> 00:19:01.219
Um, OR we can just kind of go on

365
00:19:01.219 --> 00:19:04.459
easy mode and follow our gut level intuitions, and

366
00:19:04.459 --> 00:19:07.180
these are two separate kind of psychological systems. We

367
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.300
all have both of them, but there are individual

368
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.099
differences in how much people lean on one or

369
00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:15.449
the other. So from kind of this new atheist

370
00:19:15.449 --> 00:19:19.339
rational atheism model, we could come up with a

371
00:19:19.339 --> 00:19:22.170
pretty straightforward prediction that people who tend to be

372
00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:23.979
more rational are going to be the people who

373
00:19:23.979 --> 00:19:27.959
also tend to be atheists, um. And it turns

374
00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:30.239
out there's been a reasonable amount of work on

375
00:19:30.239 --> 00:19:34.800
that over the last decade, 15 years, and early

376
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.479
on it looked promising. So 3 different research teams

377
00:19:38.479 --> 00:19:42.199
in 2012, including one that I led, published really,

378
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.959
really similar papers. None of us had been in

379
00:19:43.959 --> 00:19:46.000
touch with each other beforehand, and all these papers

380
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.160
came out within a span of month, so it

381
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.109
was kind of fun. And we each had at

382
00:19:50.109 --> 00:19:52.750
least one study where we just did a correlational

383
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.989
approach. We measured people's cognitive style on that sort

384
00:19:55.989 --> 00:20:02.069
of intuitive versus effortful analytic rational thinking continuum and

385
00:20:02.069 --> 00:20:03.589
saw where people fell on that. And then we'd

386
00:20:03.589 --> 00:20:06.189
also ask people about religious beliefs just so we

387
00:20:06.189 --> 00:20:08.229
could check, is it the case that the atheists

388
00:20:08.229 --> 00:20:10.310
are also kind of the people scoring on the

389
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.219
rational end of that spectrum. AND all three papers

390
00:20:14.219 --> 00:20:16.579
reported that same correlation, so people who scored as

391
00:20:16.579 --> 00:20:19.579
more rational also looked less religious. Two of the

392
00:20:19.579 --> 00:20:24.260
papers also included experimental manipulations that potentially could get

393
00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.459
at issues of causation, where basically two of the

394
00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:29.449
papers found ways to try to nudge people to

395
00:20:29.449 --> 00:20:30.939
think a bit more rationally, and then you ask

396
00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:32.939
them about religion just to see if now they're

397
00:20:32.939 --> 00:20:34.939
reporting being a bit less religious, if we've gotten

398
00:20:34.939 --> 00:20:38.459
them to think more rationally. And those initial experiments,

399
00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:42.140
it looked compelling, so there was a lot of

400
00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.979
kind of press and media attention on all of

401
00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:49.089
these papers, and they were celebrated within new atheist

402
00:20:49.089 --> 00:20:52.369
circles of, you know, here's definitive scientific evidence that

403
00:20:52.369 --> 00:20:54.859
we're the rational ones, and that's where atheism comes

404
00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:57.150
from and it's cited in some of the new

405
00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.579
atheist books that are out there, but the catch

406
00:20:59.579 --> 00:21:02.260
is the evidence is not good, which we know

407
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.380
now, so. Um, PRETTY early on when those papers

408
00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.849
came out they made a bit of a splash

409
00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:10.219
and other teams kind of said, all right, let's

410
00:21:10.219 --> 00:21:13.579
let's dig into these findings a bit further. And

411
00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:16.739
so I think one of mine was the first

412
00:21:16.739 --> 00:21:19.420
one to come up against replication challenges where other

413
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.979
teams out there said, hey, we're going to try

414
00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:24.540
to run the same study with tighter controls. And

415
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.420
so the first team was by led by Bob

416
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:32.250
Kallen Jagerman and and his his team. And they

417
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.930
got in touch and they wanted to replicate really

418
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.849
kind of a weird flashy study that we had

419
00:21:36.849 --> 00:21:39.329
in one of my papers where we had had

420
00:21:39.329 --> 00:21:42.530
people look at artwork. Here's here's how we were

421
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.930
trying to prime people to think more rational versus

422
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.010
intuitive. So we'd have people look at artwork and

423
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.579
it was either the thinker sculpture or we had

424
00:21:51.579 --> 00:21:53.650
the guy throwing the biscus, just got ales of

425
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.900
M. WAS our kind of control artwork where it

426
00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.020
looked the same. It's a sculpture. It has similar

427
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.020
position, but it's not connoting this deep, deep effortful

428
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.579
thinking. And in our study people who saw the

429
00:22:04.579 --> 00:22:06.699
Thinker reported being a little bit less religious. Um,

430
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.150
IF that sounds kind of silly, yeah, it was

431
00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:13.699
a silly study. It was, you know, pre-replication crisis

432
00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:16.959
was the YOLO days of social psych where, you

433
00:22:16.959 --> 00:22:21.770
know. Yeah, flashy experimental manipulation, small sample sizes, ad

434
00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.359
hoc measures cobbled together on the fly, and then,

435
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.849
yeah, sure you can, you can find whatever you

436
00:22:26.849 --> 00:22:30.290
want. And so what happened then, and that was,

437
00:22:30.329 --> 00:22:34.800
you know, widespread across the field. So naturally when

438
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.170
Bob and his team wanted to replicate that, this

439
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.609
is right around the time where I had started

440
00:22:38.609 --> 00:22:41.250
thinking more seriously about methodology as like as the

441
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.410
psychology replication crisis was starting to gain some momentum.

442
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:47.310
And I pretty quickly realized like this is not

443
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.479
my, my study is definitely going to be one

444
00:22:49.479 --> 00:22:51.310
of these ones that doesn't replicate because there's small

445
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.239
tiny sample sizes. It was a cute little flashy

446
00:22:54.239 --> 00:22:56.880
experimental manipulation that we just designed for that test,

447
00:22:56.959 --> 00:23:00.109
did pretty like minimal validation work on it. Um,

448
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.920
SO these are all like the pink to red

449
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.319
flags that we now know are flagging work that's

450
00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:07.709
probably not going to replicate well. So I wasn't

451
00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:10.520
terribly surprised when their effort turned up, hey, this

452
00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.180
experimental manipulation didn't seem to do what we thought

453
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.359
it did. And so those results looked like false

454
00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:19.680
positives, and that happened with some of the other

455
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.839
experimental studies like experimentally trying to nudge people around

456
00:23:23.839 --> 00:23:26.640
to think more rationally and then ask about religious

457
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.920
belief. So pretty early on, I think we gave

458
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.680
up on the idea that the experiments could provide

459
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.890
good evidence for this rational atheism thesis. Our experimental

460
00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.829
prods to make people think more rationally weren't doing

461
00:23:38.829 --> 00:23:42.270
anything. Um, BUT there were still those correlational findings

462
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.510
that each of our papers had a correlational study

463
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.430
where people who seem to have a more rational

464
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.859
cognitive style were also more likely to be atheists,

465
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.829
and that's a super simple study to run. So

466
00:23:52.829 --> 00:23:54.339
a bunch of people have run it by now.

467
00:23:54.469 --> 00:23:57.829
There have been meta-analysis. Gordon Penny Cook and his

468
00:23:57.829 --> 00:24:00.599
team ran a good meta-analysis. Where they squished together

469
00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:02.260
a few dozen of these studies and said, All

470
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.530
right, if you look across all these studies, there's

471
00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.890
a small negative correlation between a rational cognitive style

472
00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.369
and religious belief. People who are more rational tend

473
00:24:10.369 --> 00:24:14.050
to report being a little bit less religious, but

474
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:18.089
it's not a strong correlation. And then in some

475
00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:21.209
follow-up work that the team did with me, we

476
00:24:21.209 --> 00:24:23.369
kind of shipped the same study task to 13

477
00:24:23.369 --> 00:24:27.199
different countries to look for this correlation. And it

478
00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:29.920
turns out the correlation is, you know, small but

479
00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.640
stable in the US and in North America. In

480
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.670
a lot of our European countries, it disappeared entirely.

481
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.359
We had a couple of countries where it looked

482
00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:40.880
like the direction flipped. So there is this correlation

483
00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.160
in US samples where people who score more rationally

484
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.560
look a bit less religious, but it's a little

485
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.239
tiny correlation that's not going to explain much about

486
00:24:50.239 --> 00:24:53.439
atheism. And also that correlation disappears in a lot

487
00:24:53.439 --> 00:24:55.319
of places where you could do the same study.

488
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.520
Um, SO I think on that one we said

489
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.270
that the correlation between rational thinking and atheism is

490
00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.839
weak and fickle. It's not something we should hang

491
00:25:03.839 --> 00:25:05.640
our hat on and say this is where atheism

492
00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.520
comes from, because all of the sensible scientific predictions

493
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.359
you could derive from kind of the new atheist,

494
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.040
atheism is rational model. When you derive those predictions

495
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.790
and test them with human subjects, they don't work.

496
00:25:19.239 --> 00:25:20.920
So that that's an idea that I thought sounded

497
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.599
plausible enough that I sunk, you know, years of

498
00:25:23.599 --> 00:25:26.250
my early career trying to study this. And the

499
00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.400
results, I think, just have been too unimpressive over

500
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.930
the years to really place much stock in that

501
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.089
as an explanation for atheism around the globe.

502
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.540
So let's talk about just one last, the last

503
00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.020
set of claims before we move on to other

504
00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.589
topics. So this is also coming from the new

505
00:25:43.589 --> 00:25:47.459
atheists and it is two different kinds of claims.

506
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.250
The first one is that religion is psychologically harmful

507
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.780
and that it is transmitted, the second claim is

508
00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.300
that it is transmitted. To between minds like a

509
00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.619
virus. And here, I'm not sure if they are

510
00:26:00.619 --> 00:26:05.229
literally saying that we should use a virology model

511
00:26:05.229 --> 00:26:09.640
of transmission to study the transmission of religious ideas

512
00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.880
or beliefs, or if it's just a metaphor, but

513
00:26:13.119 --> 00:26:15.739
uh what would you have to say about those

514
00:26:15.739 --> 00:26:16.199
claims?

515
00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.760
Yeah, so I could take those in turns. So

516
00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.170
first, the new atheists, especially as kind of part

517
00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:26.239
of their broader political project, really seemed keen to

518
00:26:26.239 --> 00:26:27.890
point out that there's a lot of problems in

519
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.290
the world that we can just blame religion for

520
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.849
because religion is kind of a net negative for

521
00:26:32.849 --> 00:26:38.250
humanity and probably the domain where they applied this

522
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:41.849
the most would be in talking about kind of

523
00:26:41.849 --> 00:26:46.880
global conflict and violence and things like terrorism. And

524
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.520
it's maybe most vividly illustrated by Richard Dawkins wrote

525
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.839
an op ed just a few days after 9/11

526
00:26:54.119 --> 00:26:59.239
called Religion's Misguided Missiles, where he basically said what

527
00:26:59.239 --> 00:27:04.719
caused the events of 9/11 wasn't some broad geopolitical

528
00:27:04.719 --> 00:27:08.800
dispute. It was just people who were too dumb

529
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.439
and unattractive to get by in this world are

530
00:27:11.439 --> 00:27:14.079
trying to kill themselves to satisfy their God, to

531
00:27:14.079 --> 00:27:17.810
get virgins in heaven. And he said that very

532
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:21.530
directly. He basically said, look at these pathetic losers.

533
00:27:21.569 --> 00:27:25.130
Religion motivated them to do this. And then he

534
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.810
went on to say, religion also, I think he

535
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:31.530
said religions like the great monotheisms and the Abrahamic

536
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.900
faiths, having them in the world is like leaving

537
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.130
loaded guns on the street, which these are incredibly

538
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:42.250
strong claims, saying that religion is a key global

539
00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:47.530
driver of violence or terrorism. And this is one

540
00:27:47.859 --> 00:27:50.729
where again there's scientists out there doing the work

541
00:27:50.729 --> 00:27:53.979
to look at the relationship between religious beliefs and

542
00:27:53.979 --> 00:27:56.859
practices and different outcomes like violence, and people have

543
00:27:56.859 --> 00:27:58.699
been doing this work going back to, you know,

544
00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.339
you can look up William James writing in the

545
00:28:01.339 --> 00:28:05.420
late 1800s where he talks about how, you know,

546
00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.655
there's a lot of things that Look like religion's

547
00:28:07.655 --> 00:28:08.944
causing a problem in the world, but if you

548
00:28:08.944 --> 00:28:10.535
dig deeper, a lot of the times it's other

549
00:28:10.535 --> 00:28:13.494
factors that religion's incidentally bound up with, which is

550
00:28:13.494 --> 00:28:16.375
what we'd expect. Religion's a cross cultural, human, universal.

551
00:28:16.574 --> 00:28:18.375
It's going to be associated with a lot of

552
00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:21.574
things because it's everywhere. If we could find a

553
00:28:21.574 --> 00:28:23.535
problem in the world that it seemed like religion

554
00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:25.974
had no ties to, that would be surprising because

555
00:28:25.974 --> 00:28:31.135
religion has ties to everything. Um, SO, if you

556
00:28:31.135 --> 00:28:32.734
look at people who do a lot of work

557
00:28:32.734 --> 00:28:35.734
actually trying to understand the relationships between religion and

558
00:28:35.734 --> 00:28:39.939
terrorism. You've got work by like Scott Atran, Jeremy

559
00:28:39.939 --> 00:28:42.459
Ginges, people like that who are actually doing the

560
00:28:42.459 --> 00:28:47.540
work. They're going to kind of conflict regions, interviewing

561
00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:53.859
combatants, families of people who have died in conflict,

562
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.660
just to say, well, what motivated these people? What's

563
00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:01.579
motivating you to, you know, consider suicide terrorism as

564
00:29:01.579 --> 00:29:04.719
an avenue? Um, THE new atheist model where they're

565
00:29:04.719 --> 00:29:07.119
saying people are doing this to please their gods

566
00:29:07.119 --> 00:29:10.959
because religion's the ultimate bad guy. The prediction there

567
00:29:10.959 --> 00:29:14.319
would be that we should expect that violent conflict

568
00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:17.280
or terrorism is predicted by indices of people's kind

569
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.760
of personal beliefs in this God. They're trying to

570
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.920
please God so their beliefs in God should matter.

571
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.750
Um, WHAT Atri Genes and others find is that

572
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.910
actually that that's not a great predictor. Uh, WHAT

573
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.260
is a good predictor is people's kind of sense

574
00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:37.069
of shared bonds with their fellow humans in their

575
00:29:37.069 --> 00:29:41.270
group. Um, SO a suicide terrorist isn't killing themselves

576
00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:45.030
for their God. They're sacrificing their life, their life

577
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.609
to help their buddies, basically. They're, they're viewing it,

578
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:51.339
it's, you know, it's team conflict, it's coalitional conflict,

579
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.390
so sacrificing yourself to help your people is very

580
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.109
different from sacrificing yourself because you think your God

581
00:29:57.109 --> 00:30:00.989
wants it. And Jeremy Gini, his team over the

582
00:30:00.989 --> 00:30:03.869
years. HAS done a lot of work where they'll

583
00:30:03.869 --> 00:30:06.310
ask people, OK, you know, they'll they'll go to

584
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.949
regions where there's intergroup conflict that seems to cleave

585
00:30:08.949 --> 00:30:10.969
across religious lines, and they've done this in other

586
00:30:10.969 --> 00:30:15.869
contexts and um They'll kind of ask people, well,

587
00:30:15.989 --> 00:30:17.989
how do you feel about people on the other

588
00:30:17.989 --> 00:30:21.150
side, your enemies? Do you dehumanize them? Are you

589
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.670
prejudiced against them? Do you think their lives are

590
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:26.589
worth less than kind of your team's lives? And

591
00:30:26.589 --> 00:30:29.069
so they'll get people's own personal answers and then

592
00:30:29.069 --> 00:30:30.589
they'll ask them the same questions and they'll say,

593
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.420
All right, now adopt the perspective of your God.

594
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:35.869
Do you think your God thinks these people are

595
00:30:35.869 --> 00:30:38.150
worthless? Do you think your God hates these people?

596
00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.849
Um, AND there it turns out that people will

597
00:30:41.849 --> 00:30:44.079
report that their God is more tolerant than they

598
00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:47.989
are. So they'll say, yeah, I think these people

599
00:30:47.989 --> 00:30:51.520
are scum. God's OK with them, but I hate

600
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:57.579
these people. So generally across several studies now, people's

601
00:30:57.579 --> 00:30:59.550
gods seem to be viewed as more tolerant than

602
00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:02.270
they themselves are. So people aren't aren't fighting the

603
00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:04.890
other team to please God. They're doing it in

604
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.949
spite of the fact that they think God is

605
00:31:06.949 --> 00:31:11.890
actually kind of more tolerant, um. So that's at

606
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.030
least a couple of different ways. I guess I

607
00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.810
could mention one more line of evidence is Jeremy

608
00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:19.650
Gingess, Ian Hanson, RN O and Zion. They had

609
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:22.410
another project looking at suicide terrorism where you look

610
00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:25.729
at what predicts people holding positive attitudes of suicide

611
00:31:25.729 --> 00:31:28.410
terrorism and suicide terrorists, and they would actually try

612
00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.650
to tease apart different religious dimensions. So one of

613
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.969
them is things like connection felt connection to a

614
00:31:34.969 --> 00:31:37.410
god, which you might index with, say, a frequency

615
00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:41.400
of private prayer. Um, THAT'S distinct from kind of

616
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.000
your coalitional hanging out with the buddies stuff, which

617
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.680
that one you could index with frequency of religious

618
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.119
attendance. So how many times a week do you

619
00:31:50.119 --> 00:31:52.400
go to the place where other religious people are

620
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.699
and hang out with them? And in that work

621
00:31:54.699 --> 00:31:58.780
it turns out that the coalitional stuff, so religious

622
00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.180
attendance that predicts more support for terrorism, whereas the

623
00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.780
private belief stuff indexed by prayer frequency predicts less

624
00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:09.890
support. So across all these different lines of evidence

625
00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:14.530
we're pretty consistently finding that The evidence doesn't look

626
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:18.420
like what you'd expect if people were engaging in

627
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.010
these kinds of violent actions to please a God.

628
00:32:21.199 --> 00:32:23.380
It almost looks like people are engaging in violent

629
00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.660
actions on behalf of their teammates, kind of knowing

630
00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.939
full well that they don't think God's necessarily as

631
00:32:28.939 --> 00:32:30.060
into it as they are.

632
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.979
So, I mean, when it comes to things like

633
00:32:33.979 --> 00:32:37.250
terrorism, for example, probably it's better for us to

634
00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:43.020
look at the social, economic, political factors than religious

635
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.699
factors. I mean, it's not that religion couldn't play

636
00:32:46.699 --> 00:32:51.130
any role at all, but simply reducing it to

637
00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:54.880
people being religious or not is not very helpful

638
00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.459
when it comes to a proper scientific explanation, right?

639
00:32:59.819 --> 00:33:02.270
Yeah, absolutely. I think if we want to understand

640
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.060
what's driving these things, yeah, there will be some

641
00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.510
religious factors that are bound up in it, but

642
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:08.510
I think if you want to understand the deeper

643
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.790
psychology, it really seems like understanding those kind of

644
00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.430
coalitional ties to other people seems to be the

645
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:15.949
kind of the most important thing. It's the sense

646
00:33:15.949 --> 00:33:20.390
of community that we're defending and religions can be

647
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.469
good at building communities, but it's not necessarily like

648
00:33:23.469 --> 00:33:27.030
the supernatural connection to God, that's, that's the coalitional

649
00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:27.510
problem.

650
00:33:28.469 --> 00:33:32.130
Uh, AND what about the second, uh, set of

651
00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:36.670
claims about religion being transmitted like a virus between

652
00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:37.369
Ms?

653
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.229
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, SORRY, I missed that

654
00:33:40.229 --> 00:33:44.380
one. YEAH, so that idea and that they've been

655
00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:48.030
tinkering with that idea, probably going back to 76

656
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:49.989
when the Selfish Gene came out. The final chapter

657
00:33:49.989 --> 00:33:53.560
of that, Dawkins says, all right. We just had

658
00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.489
the rest, the beginning part of this book is

659
00:33:55.489 --> 00:33:58.699
understanding how we could genetically evolve into a cooperative

660
00:33:58.699 --> 00:34:01.890
species and then in the final chapter he kind

661
00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:03.849
of says, well, what about culture? How does culture

662
00:34:03.849 --> 00:34:06.369
work? Could we think of culture as an evolutionary

663
00:34:06.369 --> 00:34:10.370
process? So he speculated that in genetic evolution we

664
00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.370
have genes which are discrete bits of information encoded

665
00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.728
in DNA. That's what gets passed across generations. We're

666
00:34:16.728 --> 00:34:19.090
just kind of these big lumbering vehicles that, you

667
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.590
know, usher our genes into the future. So he

668
00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.790
said, Well, what if instead of little bits of

669
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:27.139
genetic information, what if there's little bits of cultural

670
00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:29.938
information floating around and he called these memes, which

671
00:34:29.938 --> 00:34:31.949
we still have that word, although it's changed from

672
00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:34.350
a serious scientific proposal of how culture works to

673
00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:36.500
it's, you know, now it's like cute kitten videos

674
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.188
on the internet, but in that model, in the

675
00:34:40.188 --> 00:34:44.270
memetic model, um, these, these memes are just floating

676
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:46.958
around in the world. They're trying to recruit our

677
00:34:46.958 --> 00:34:49.790
attention, so our brains are kind of the substrate

678
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.580
that allow for memetic evolution. Um, AND in their

679
00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.938
model, our brains just kind of they're along for

680
00:34:55.938 --> 00:34:58.620
the ride. They can get hijacked by means you

681
00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:02.100
act as viruses that then make us behave in

682
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.909
ways that just spread the meme. Um, SO yeah,

683
00:35:05.979 --> 00:35:09.419
they do explicitly liken it to a virus and

684
00:35:09.419 --> 00:35:11.139
you still hear that lingo in a lot of

685
00:35:11.139 --> 00:35:12.830
culture war stuff they'll say, oh, such and such

686
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:15.879
is a mind virus, and it's just kind of

687
00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:20.770
Co-opting memetic language from the 70s, but memetics sputtered

688
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.050
and then never really took off as a serious

689
00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.050
sign of cultural evolution. It looked promising for a

690
00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:29.610
while, but it kind of built in some assumptions

691
00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:32.449
of how learning would work or how cultural evolution

692
00:35:32.449 --> 00:35:36.610
could work that just didn't age well. So it

693
00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:39.850
built in the assumption that these memes are discrete

694
00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.810
bits of cultural information that are passed on largely

695
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.790
intact from one mind to another. Um, TURNS out

696
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.550
that's not how human learning works. Um, WE can

697
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.899
learn stuff, but it gets modified in transit. Um,

698
00:35:52.229 --> 00:35:55.590
IT'S not super high fidelity, cultural learning, we get

699
00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.739
errors in all the time. I can learn something

700
00:35:57.739 --> 00:36:01.530
and then Either accidentally change it or I can

701
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.409
actually innovate. So I might think of a better

702
00:36:03.409 --> 00:36:05.610
way to do something. So now I change this

703
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.770
cultural information before I pass it on to other

704
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:11.080
people, which is not at all what the memetic

705
00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:14.370
kind of view is. Here it's the information remains

706
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.310
unchanged and just hops from brain to brain. It

707
00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:20.020
seems like that idea failed largely just because it's

708
00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.780
not an accurate description of how cultural evolution works,

709
00:36:22.979 --> 00:36:25.860
and gradually over time memetics just kind of got

710
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:29.689
subsumed into the broader study of cultural evolution without,

711
00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.580
in my opinion, having a huge impact. So this

712
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.780
is one of the scientific ideas that it seems

713
00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.810
to have had a large cultural impact without having

714
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.600
a large scientific impact first, which is kind of

715
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.260
interesting. So if they're saying that religions are these

716
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.030
memes that hop from mind to mind like viruses.

717
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:48.639
Well, it turns out that's not how cultural learning

718
00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:50.600
works in the first place, so it's again positing

719
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.739
the wrong mechanism for culture and then probably reaching

720
00:36:53.739 --> 00:36:56.120
incorrect conclusions about it. Now that doesn't mean that

721
00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.280
religion's not socially transmitted, but it's, it's not the

722
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.919
case that we're kind of these hapless vehicles who

723
00:37:02.919 --> 00:37:06.280
just get hijacked by means floating around. That's not

724
00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:06.959
how we work.

725
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:12.629
And so, uh, earlier, we've talked about one possible

726
00:37:12.629 --> 00:37:16.389
approach to religion which was based on genetics. What

727
00:37:16.389 --> 00:37:19.610
about cognitive science of religion? I mean, how does

728
00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:21.949
it approach the study of religion?

729
00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:27.939
I think cognitive science of religion is an exciting

730
00:37:27.939 --> 00:37:29.850
approach that I think really was kind of the

731
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:34.550
first systematic attempt to try to understand how religion

732
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:38.169
works from kind of a mechanistic cognitive and Darwinian

733
00:37:38.169 --> 00:37:41.570
framework. So it's a good approach to try to

734
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:46.169
tell a compelling evolutionary story about religion. And looping

735
00:37:46.169 --> 00:37:47.850
back to me talking about the puzzles of faith

736
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:49.840
and atheism, I think it was a good early

737
00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.330
attempt to answer the puzzle of faith. And so

738
00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:55.409
the cognitive science of religion kind of started catching

739
00:37:55.409 --> 00:37:59.989
momentum in the late 90s, early 2000s and it

740
00:37:59.989 --> 00:38:03.449
is an interdisciplinary group of, you know, some philosophers,

741
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:08.530
cognitive scientists, developmental psychologists, social psychologists getting together and

742
00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:12.010
kind of trying to sketch out plausible ways that

743
00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:14.209
we could think about how our species would evolve

744
00:38:14.209 --> 00:38:18.070
into a religious one. And I think they had

745
00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.790
some really important insights and really helped progress the

746
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:24.270
field. And I think some of the, some of

747
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.030
the initial work hasn't held up super well, but

748
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.449
I still think that we all owe a great

749
00:38:28.449 --> 00:38:30.469
debt to cognitive science and religion for really starting

750
00:38:30.469 --> 00:38:32.830
the ball rolling and setting the research program. And

751
00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:34.830
I think the research program was pretty successful for

752
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:39.320
10 or 15 years, and I think the kind

753
00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.060
of best things to come out of that approach

754
00:38:42.429 --> 00:38:46.620
are viewing, so we could think of, you know,

755
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.159
how did our species evolve to have a given

756
00:38:49.159 --> 00:38:53.070
trait, whether it's bipedalism or religion or anything else

757
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.560
we could say, all right, you could have that

758
00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:00.159
trait because that's a directly selected adaptation. So bipedalism

759
00:39:00.159 --> 00:39:03.750
seems to be an adaptation that benefited our ancestors,

760
00:39:04.239 --> 00:39:08.260
um. But things can also be kind of culturally

761
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:12.209
widespread species universals, not because they have any direct

762
00:39:12.209 --> 00:39:15.139
adaptive function, but because they're a byproduct of something

763
00:39:15.139 --> 00:39:17.459
else. So a good example here is like our

764
00:39:17.459 --> 00:39:21.189
teeth are kind of white. It's not because there's

765
00:39:21.189 --> 00:39:25.250
any survival advantage to having white teeth, but there

766
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:27.620
is a survival advantage to having teeth that are

767
00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:32.060
really hard. Um, SO we've evolved to have an

768
00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.219
enamel layer on our teeth that I believe is

769
00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:37.340
calcium phosphate, um, which is really hard and durable,

770
00:39:37.459 --> 00:39:39.300
which is what you want teeth to be. It

771
00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.340
happens to be white. So here the adaptation is

772
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.260
we need hard teeth, the byproduct is they ended

773
00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.389
up being white just because that's how it worked.

774
00:39:47.929 --> 00:39:51.699
Um, SO cognitive scientists of religion. Uh, DID a

775
00:39:51.699 --> 00:39:55.219
lot of kind of asking the world, well, is

776
00:39:55.219 --> 00:39:58.580
religion an adaptation and if so, for what? Or

777
00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.300
does it make more sense to think of our

778
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:04.709
capacity for religion as a byproduct of other things?

779
00:40:04.719 --> 00:40:08.300
And the general consensus out of a lot of

780
00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:11.969
this work is that religion comes naturally to us

781
00:40:11.969 --> 00:40:15.340
humans, but not because it's an adaptation, but more

782
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.530
because it's a byproduct of other stuff and especially

783
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:22.540
they kind of homed in on It seems like

784
00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.909
the capacity for religious belief might be an evolutionary

785
00:40:25.909 --> 00:40:28.389
byproduct of the fact that we evolved as a

786
00:40:28.389 --> 00:40:31.310
hypersocial species who we need to keep track of

787
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.070
each other's minds. And once you have that ability

788
00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:36.989
to track other minds, it's kind of easy for

789
00:40:36.989 --> 00:40:39.989
religion to piggyback off of that. So I don't

790
00:40:39.989 --> 00:40:42.030
think we evolved to have religion, but I think

791
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:43.949
religion's a really good fit for the minds that

792
00:40:43.949 --> 00:40:46.270
we evolved as kind of a social species.

793
00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.469
And what do you make of the cognitive mechanisms

794
00:40:50.469 --> 00:40:53.030
that people in the cognitive science of religion have

795
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:58.070
been suggesting that supposedly underlie religious thinking, like, for

796
00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:03.620
example, core knowledge that includes Intuitive physics, intuitive biology,

797
00:41:03.639 --> 00:41:07.560
and intuitive psychology or theory of mind, the hyperactive

798
00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:13.179
agency detection device, minimally counterintuitive ideas, uh teleological thinking,

799
00:41:13.479 --> 00:41:15.399
uh, and things like that. What do you make

800
00:41:15.399 --> 00:41:15.760
of that?

801
00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.620
Yeah, I think cognitive science of religion did a

802
00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.709
great job of kind of identifying a lot of

803
00:41:21.969 --> 00:41:24.540
small cognitive biases that might nudge us a little

804
00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.969
bit in one way or another, so. Yeah, you

805
00:41:27.969 --> 00:41:29.810
were mentioning these kind of core domains of knowledge,

806
00:41:29.929 --> 00:41:33.010
so we think about physical objects in ways that

807
00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.080
are different from the way we think about animals,

808
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:36.729
and that's different from the way we think about

809
00:41:36.729 --> 00:41:39.330
people with really complex psychology, and that's because we

810
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.290
have different cognitive systems for tracking it. We have

811
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.379
a folk physics that can think of like, oh,

812
00:41:43.399 --> 00:41:46.969
solid objects can't pass through each other. Objects kind

813
00:41:46.969 --> 00:41:49.449
of continue in their same normal motion unless they're

814
00:41:49.449 --> 00:41:51.530
impinged upon by something else. So you seem to

815
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:53.570
have these kind of built in assumptions about how

816
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:57.840
the physical world works. And we have similar expectations

817
00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.879
in the folk biological realm where we can think

818
00:41:59.879 --> 00:42:03.080
about living things, and then we have folk psychology

819
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.800
which is tracking kind of human interactions and mind

820
00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.959
perception. And so if we have these separate cognitive

821
00:42:09.959 --> 00:42:13.560
systems, cognitive scientists of religion have said, well, maybe

822
00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.790
these different systems each have their own little biases,

823
00:42:16.919 --> 00:42:18.389
and if you put a bunch of those together,

824
00:42:18.479 --> 00:42:21.159
they kind of point us towards religion. And so

825
00:42:21.159 --> 00:42:23.800
they've identified a few specific ways this could work.

826
00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:28.159
Uh, SO one of them is this hyperactive agency

827
00:42:28.159 --> 00:42:30.770
detection device is something that was postulated back in

828
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:33.719
the 90s where people said, well, we need to

829
00:42:33.719 --> 00:42:36.290
survive in the world and there's other agents in

830
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:38.489
the world that are threats. So agents could be

831
00:42:38.489 --> 00:42:40.969
predators. So if I'm walking through the woods at

832
00:42:40.969 --> 00:42:44.139
night and I hear a snapping stick, it could

833
00:42:44.139 --> 00:42:45.810
just be that, you know, it's the wind and

834
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:47.850
a stick broke, no big deal, or it could

835
00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:50.250
be that there's a bear around the corner. Now

836
00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:52.439
if I assume that there's no bear and I

837
00:42:52.439 --> 00:42:54.320
go on walking and there's a bear there, I

838
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.800
get mauled and I'm dead. Whereas if I assume

839
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.520
that every snapping stick is a threat, I can

840
00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.879
avoid danger in the world, and most of the

841
00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:04.750
time I'm avoiding danger that was never there. But

842
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:07.389
if there is enough danger out there, then it

843
00:43:07.389 --> 00:43:09.320
could be good to have a bias to just

844
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.280
assume that lots of things out there in the

845
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.760
world are caused by intentional agents even if they're

846
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.409
not. And Barrett and others termed this hyperactive agency

847
00:43:17.409 --> 00:43:20.600
detection device, and Barrett, especially in his books, has

848
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.320
said this could be a key building block of

849
00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.439
religion if we're mistakenly detecting agency out in the

850
00:43:26.439 --> 00:43:29.750
world and then upon investigation, you know, we didn't

851
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:32.260
find the bearer around the corner. We didn't. We

852
00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.500
heard the noise and there was nothing there. He

853
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.770
said, Well, maybe if this kind of, you know,

854
00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:42.389
over detective agency detection is happening enough, instead of

855
00:43:42.389 --> 00:43:45.169
us just dismissing the false alarms, we might start

856
00:43:45.169 --> 00:43:47.020
to think, you know what, maybe there is a

857
00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.739
supernatural agent out there. Maybe there's a spirit in

858
00:43:49.739 --> 00:43:53.500
the woods that's making these sounds, um. And so

859
00:43:53.709 --> 00:43:56.939
he's kind of said that hyperactive agency detection device

860
00:43:56.939 --> 00:43:59.159
might be kind of the first core building block

861
00:43:59.159 --> 00:44:02.510
that would predispose us to thinking about um kind

862
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:06.719
of supernatural agents in the world, um. And that

863
00:44:06.719 --> 00:44:11.229
one interestingly you'll find it cited in scientific papers

864
00:44:11.229 --> 00:44:15.320
today. It's been discussed heavily in books by cognitive

865
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.959
scientists of religion, but it's also reached some escape

866
00:44:17.959 --> 00:44:20.719
velocity. So if you open like Michael Shermer's books

867
00:44:20.719 --> 00:44:23.600
about beliefs, you'll have a whole section on agency

868
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.879
detection and a agenticity. So this is an idea

869
00:44:26.879 --> 00:44:30.399
that it's super popular within cognitive science and religion

870
00:44:30.399 --> 00:44:32.679
to the point where people kind of one step

871
00:44:32.679 --> 00:44:34.600
removed, have heard of it and take it seriously.

872
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:37.800
But what's unreal to me over the years is

873
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.800
if you track back, so if I found a

874
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.790
citation to hyperactive agency detection in the literature today,

875
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.159
I could follow that academic citation. I might find

876
00:44:45.159 --> 00:44:47.310
a paper 5 years ago that's talking about it.

877
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.090
OK, so I'll open that paper and I'll see

878
00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:52.120
where they talk about hyperactive agency detection. OK, they're

879
00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.620
citing another paper. Um, AND if you trace it

880
00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.840
back, what's weird is you never get back to

881
00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.149
an original empirical result. So this isn't a case

882
00:45:01.149 --> 00:45:04.560
that people found the evidence for a hyperactive agency

883
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.320
detection device and then found evidence linking it to

884
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.679
religion, and that's why people have been talking about

885
00:45:09.679 --> 00:45:12.919
it for 20 years as best as my colleagues

886
00:45:12.919 --> 00:45:14.429
and I can tell, when you trace it back

887
00:45:14.429 --> 00:45:16.320
and try to find, you know, what, where are

888
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.919
the papers that started this all. You find a

889
00:45:18.919 --> 00:45:21.439
few like review papers in the 90s that all

890
00:45:21.439 --> 00:45:23.229
kind of cite each other where they're saying like,

891
00:45:23.399 --> 00:45:27.040
oh, there's hyperactive agency. Some people would cite faces

892
00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.149
in the clouds by Stuart Guthrie, where he's talking

893
00:45:29.149 --> 00:45:32.840
about a tendency for anthropomorphism. So anthropomorphism is kind

894
00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:37.350
of attributing humanlike stuff to nonhumans. Um, BUT none

895
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:40.229
of this work actually ever established that we have

896
00:45:40.229 --> 00:45:44.189
a hyperactive agency detection device, and nobody's ever empirically

897
00:45:44.189 --> 00:45:46.310
demonstrated its link to religion. It's kind of been

898
00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:50.070
assumed into the literature for long enough that it's,

899
00:45:50.149 --> 00:45:51.949
it's an idea that you'll see sighted, but there's,

900
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:54.830
I don't think there was ever actually particularly compelling

901
00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:59.469
scientific evidence to support it. Now hyperactive agency detection

902
00:45:59.469 --> 00:46:01.540
device was just kind of one of these cognitive

903
00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:05.429
building blocks that cognitive scientists of religion postulated. And

904
00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:07.520
I don't think that one's held up well, but

905
00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.350
some of the other ones that they've brought up,

906
00:46:09.449 --> 00:46:11.709
I think, have stood the test of time a

907
00:46:11.709 --> 00:46:15.260
lot better. So one of them is mind-body dualism.

908
00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:18.310
So since we have kind of a folk psychology

909
00:46:18.879 --> 00:46:20.439
which is different from our folk biology and our

910
00:46:20.439 --> 00:46:24.959
folk physics, we're pretty good about thinking about minds

911
00:46:24.959 --> 00:46:28.719
as being distinct from bodies, and we have our

912
00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:31.120
mind perception mentalizing abilities that are good at thinking

913
00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:35.679
about minds. And so folks like Paul Bloom has

914
00:46:35.679 --> 00:46:38.000
been big on dualism over the years. They'd say

915
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.719
if we're good at thinking about mind stuff as

916
00:46:39.719 --> 00:46:42.909
being distinct from body stuff. Why couldn't we just

917
00:46:42.909 --> 00:46:45.229
think about mind stuff that exists separate from the

918
00:46:45.229 --> 00:46:48.830
body stuff? So here we could have disembodied supernatural

919
00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:51.750
minds that we can still use our, our mind

920
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:54.310
perception faculties to kind of think about and reason

921
00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:58.110
about and interact with, but they're never actually linked

922
00:46:58.110 --> 00:46:59.909
to a body. So that to me seems like

923
00:46:59.909 --> 00:47:02.510
a lot more kind of plausible origin story for

924
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:05.550
these beliefs than a hyperactive agency detection device because

925
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.550
with dualism, we're inferring the existence of minds. We're

926
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:12.419
not detecting anything, um. Some of the other cognitive

927
00:47:12.419 --> 00:47:16.540
building blocks from cognitive science and religion. Deborah Kelleman

928
00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.179
has done a lot of good work on what

929
00:47:18.179 --> 00:47:23.060
she's termed promiscuous teleology. So teleological thinking is kind

930
00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.979
of attributing function and purpose to things. So if

931
00:47:26.979 --> 00:47:28.739
I if I held up a hammer and said,

932
00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.340
What is this, what is this for? Why is

933
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:32.719
it like this, you'd say, well, It's designed that

934
00:47:32.719 --> 00:47:34.239
way so you can hit stuff and it's probably

935
00:47:34.239 --> 00:47:35.679
got the little claw things in case you want

936
00:47:35.679 --> 00:47:37.949
to pull the nail back up. So we're looking

937
00:47:37.949 --> 00:47:41.199
at the features of something and then inferring a

938
00:47:41.199 --> 00:47:44.360
deeper purpose or functionality to it, which totally makes

939
00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.719
sense if we're looking at human-made artifacts. They were

940
00:47:46.719 --> 00:47:49.520
designed with something in mind, but for like features

941
00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.919
of the natural world, you know, if I hold

942
00:47:51.919 --> 00:47:53.600
up a rock and say, why is it this

943
00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.320
shape, you might give me a physical explanation where

944
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.679
you'd say, Well, it looks like it broke in

945
00:47:58.679 --> 00:48:00.639
two and so you've got these craggy bits because

946
00:48:00.639 --> 00:48:04.320
of like stuff. Um, BUT if you talk to,

947
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:07.209
for instance, smaller children, And you say, well, why

948
00:48:07.209 --> 00:48:10.439
is this rock pointy? They will kind of give

949
00:48:10.439 --> 00:48:13.169
you a teleological answer. They might say, Well, that

950
00:48:13.169 --> 00:48:16.179
rock's pointy the animal needs to scratch an itch.

951
00:48:16.649 --> 00:48:18.149
Or if you say, oh, like, why, why is

952
00:48:18.149 --> 00:48:20.610
it raining? They're not going to say, Well, there's

953
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:22.889
condensation in the upper atmosphere, and then that turns

954
00:48:22.889 --> 00:48:26.810
into raindrops and they fall. They'll say, Well, yeah,

955
00:48:26.879 --> 00:48:29.719
there's rain so that flowers can have water. Maybe

956
00:48:29.719 --> 00:48:31.500
if you say, well, why do flowers need water?

957
00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:33.439
It's like, oh, because animals want to smell them.

958
00:48:33.979 --> 00:48:36.939
Um, SO especially younger kids have this bias to

959
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:40.760
assume that things are happening for a reason. They're

960
00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:44.270
attributing purpose to lots of things, which I think

961
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:47.739
if you pair that with ideas about, say, dualism,

962
00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.469
you can get some mileage where if we're imagining

963
00:48:50.469 --> 00:48:53.340
that there's disembodied kind of supernatural minds out there,

964
00:48:53.629 --> 00:48:56.110
those could be the things that give purpose to

965
00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:58.310
the stuff that we kind of readily infer is

966
00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:02.129
there, um. And there have been some other CSR

967
00:49:02.129 --> 00:49:08.489
ideas, so there's minimally counterintuitive agents. That's kind of

968
00:49:08.489 --> 00:49:10.639
another kind of popular idea that pops up here.

969
00:49:10.929 --> 00:49:13.510
The idea here is if you've got a folk

970
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:17.250
psychological system for tracking minds and a folk physics

971
00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:20.689
system that's tracking physical objects, these systems kind of

972
00:49:20.689 --> 00:49:24.050
come with their default assumptions about the world. Um,

973
00:49:24.169 --> 00:49:26.120
WHICH just helps us get through the world easily,

974
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:29.689
but if you tweak some of those assumptions, you

975
00:49:29.689 --> 00:49:33.969
can create kind of interesting and memorable concepts. So

976
00:49:33.969 --> 00:49:37.419
if I had you think about, all right, imagine

977
00:49:37.419 --> 00:49:40.889
somebody who's basically a person, but they don't have

978
00:49:40.889 --> 00:49:43.889
a physical body and they can like travel through

979
00:49:43.889 --> 00:49:48.669
walls. OK, so that's something that satisfies my folk

980
00:49:48.669 --> 00:49:51.750
psychology assumptions but has weird properties in terms of

981
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.669
my assumptions about people from folk physics. And if

982
00:49:54.669 --> 00:49:57.030
you tweak those settings just a little bit, you

983
00:49:57.030 --> 00:50:02.120
get what's called a minimally counterintuitive concept. So something

984
00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.110
that largely fits what we're expecting but is tweaked

985
00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:06.750
a little bit, and there's some telling work that

986
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:10.739
these minimally counterintuitive things are more memorable. So if

987
00:50:10.739 --> 00:50:12.540
I, if I have a story sprinkled with a

988
00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.739
few things that tweak our expectations, that helps it

989
00:50:15.739 --> 00:50:18.580
kind of linger in memory, which, you know, across

990
00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:22.979
subsequent cultural transmission, memorability could be really important. If

991
00:50:22.979 --> 00:50:24.580
we have a hard time remembering something we're not

992
00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:28.479
going to pass it on, um. So yeah, had

993
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.850
minimally counterintuitive stuff, mind-body dualism, teleological thinking. These are

994
00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:37.209
all the sorts of kind of individual smaller cognitive

995
00:50:37.209 --> 00:50:40.050
biases that in the cognitive science of religion they'd

996
00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:41.570
say, Well, if you put enough of these things

997
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:44.080
together, they all nudge us a little bit towards

998
00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.969
religion and if you've got enough of them, then

999
00:50:45.969 --> 00:50:48.879
we go all the way towards religion. So that's,

1000
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:50.550
I'd say the general approach.

1001
00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:54.760
Mhm. But when it comes to nudging us toward

1002
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:59.239
religion, do we have enough evidence to claim that

1003
00:50:59.239 --> 00:51:03.399
we are innately predisposed to religiosity?

1004
00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:08.159
Yeah, I mean, I'm always a bit hesitant to

1005
00:51:08.159 --> 00:51:09.959
talk about what we innately do, so I'd say

1006
00:51:09.959 --> 00:51:12.959
we innately have the capacity for religion. I think

1007
00:51:12.959 --> 00:51:15.800
most people have kind of enough of these cognitive

1008
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.959
building blocks that we have a really easy time

1009
00:51:17.959 --> 00:51:23.159
thinking religious thoughts, and some figures in the cognitive

1010
00:51:23.159 --> 00:51:26.070
science of religion would stop there and they'd say,

1011
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.550
yeah, if we have enough of these building blocks

1012
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.719
and enough of these little biases, that's where religious

1013
00:51:31.719 --> 00:51:35.429
belief comes from. Um, AND I've never been super

1014
00:51:35.429 --> 00:51:37.790
persuaded by that angle because I don't think they

1015
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:41.949
actually have a mechanism built in for understanding how

1016
00:51:41.949 --> 00:51:45.229
beliefs happen. So I think all of the cognitive

1017
00:51:45.229 --> 00:51:48.419
science and religion biases, whether it's dualism or teleological

1018
00:51:48.419 --> 00:51:50.800
thinking, I think that's they do a great job

1019
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:54.550
of explaining why religious concepts look the way they

1020
00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:59.070
do across cultures. So every, every world religion has

1021
00:51:59.114 --> 00:52:02.745
The notion of disembodied supernatural agents dualism can tell

1022
00:52:02.745 --> 00:52:05.145
us a lot about why that's the case. These

1023
00:52:05.145 --> 00:52:08.114
supernatural agents give us some meaning and purpose. All

1024
00:52:08.114 --> 00:52:12.385
right, teleological thinking thinking can help us explain why

1025
00:52:12.385 --> 00:52:15.504
the gods of different religions are like that. But

1026
00:52:15.504 --> 00:52:18.614
neither of those tells us why people believe in

1027
00:52:18.614 --> 00:52:21.024
these gods or why some people don't believe in

1028
00:52:21.024 --> 00:52:23.425
these gods, or why people over here believe in

1029
00:52:23.425 --> 00:52:25.225
this God and people over here believe in a

1030
00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:29.050
different god. So I think it's those harder questions

1031
00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:33.030
about patterns of belief and disbelief. I think asking

1032
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:35.850
those questions starts to lay bare kind of some

1033
00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:38.689
limitations in the cognitive science of religion approach because

1034
00:52:38.689 --> 00:52:41.570
I think it's doing a good job of answering

1035
00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:43.919
questions about why religion looks the way it does,

1036
00:52:44.169 --> 00:52:46.929
but it does less of a solid job at

1037
00:52:46.929 --> 00:52:50.449
explaining why individual people do than any of these

1038
00:52:50.449 --> 00:52:51.719
supernatural agents.

1039
00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:56.030
Uh, WHAT about cultural evolutionary theory? What do you

1040
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:58.590
think it adds to the picture when it comes

1041
00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:00.340
to understanding religion?

1042
00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:06.629
Yeah, so cultural evolution is a vibrant scientific subfield

1043
00:53:06.919 --> 00:53:09.760
that's really been coalescing over the last 30, 40,

1044
00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.439
50 years, and the basic idea is what if

1045
00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:15.679
we take the established theoretical and methodological toolkit of

1046
00:53:15.679 --> 00:53:19.120
evolutionary biology and then tweak it a bit to

1047
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.879
reflect cultural learning instead, because if we think kind

1048
00:53:22.879 --> 00:53:25.959
of at the broadest sense of what are the

1049
00:53:25.959 --> 00:53:28.479
kind of key ingredients that we need to have

1050
00:53:28.479 --> 00:53:33.449
an evolutionary process. Uh, YOU need some variability among,

1051
00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:36.830
you know, individual units in a population. You need

1052
00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:39.629
a mechanism of inheritance where like parents are like

1053
00:53:39.629 --> 00:53:42.189
offspring more than, more than you'd expect by chance.

1054
00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:45.389
And then you need fitness consequences where among all

1055
00:53:45.389 --> 00:53:48.030
the variability in the population, some variants do better

1056
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:51.620
than others. And if you have those ingredients, variability,

1057
00:53:51.669 --> 00:53:54.469
consequences, and inheritance, you have the potential for an

1058
00:53:54.469 --> 00:53:59.129
evolutionary process. Um, AND that clearly works really well

1059
00:53:59.129 --> 00:54:01.560
if we're thinking about genetic evolution. So we have

1060
00:54:01.929 --> 00:54:06.090
huge variability in genotypes and phenotypes. There's consequences associated

1061
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:08.810
with that. And then we have, uh, you know,

1062
00:54:08.889 --> 00:54:11.774
sexual reproduction in our species as the. MECHANISM of

1063
00:54:11.774 --> 00:54:14.695
inheritance. Um, AND so you'll see a lot of

1064
00:54:14.695 --> 00:54:18.735
work focusing on particularities of genetic inheritance and this

1065
00:54:18.735 --> 00:54:20.534
is how evolution has to work. But at the

1066
00:54:20.534 --> 00:54:22.455
end, we need, we can step back and say

1067
00:54:22.455 --> 00:54:27.455
all you need is inheritance, variability consequences, and culture

1068
00:54:27.455 --> 00:54:29.895
shows all of those things. There's a huge diversity

1069
00:54:29.895 --> 00:54:33.750
in cultural practices, beliefs, norms, etc. Um, WE have

1070
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:37.580
social learning processes that that's our mechanism of inheritance,

1071
00:54:37.739 --> 00:54:39.899
and then there are kind of fitness consequences. Some

1072
00:54:39.899 --> 00:54:42.949
cultural traits do better than others. Um, SO since

1073
00:54:42.949 --> 00:54:44.550
we have those building blocks, I think it makes

1074
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:46.870
productive sense to think of culture as an evolutionary

1075
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:50.429
process, and cultural evolution has been a good mix

1076
00:54:50.429 --> 00:54:55.879
of, you know, ecologists, evolutionary biologists, anthropologists, people with

1077
00:54:55.879 --> 00:54:58.139
good training in the kind of the mathematical toolkit

1078
00:54:58.139 --> 00:55:01.439
of modern evolutionary theory are saying let's take evolutionary

1079
00:55:01.439 --> 00:55:04.810
theory and adapt it to how culture is different

1080
00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:09.129
from genes. Um, AND in that work, uh, they've

1081
00:55:09.129 --> 00:55:11.530
done a good job of thinking about kind of

1082
00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:14.959
our mechanism of inheritance is social learning. That's how

1083
00:55:14.959 --> 00:55:17.649
we learn from each other. Um, AND I think

1084
00:55:17.649 --> 00:55:20.800
the general kind of conclusion they reach is that

1085
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:24.040
we're not just culture sponges, um, kind of like

1086
00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:27.560
we're talking about memes taking over our psychology like

1087
00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.629
little viruses. That depicts cultural learning as passive. So

1088
00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.159
I walk through the world and memes can hijack

1089
00:55:34.159 --> 00:55:36.270
my brain and I don't really get a vote

1090
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:38.879
because I'm just this big dumb vehicle walking around

1091
00:55:38.879 --> 00:55:42.439
being driven by my memes, um. That doesn't seem

1092
00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:44.479
to be how cultural learning works. So people are

1093
00:55:44.479 --> 00:55:47.280
actually pretty selective with their learning. We learn some

1094
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.639
concepts more easily than others. We find some things

1095
00:55:49.639 --> 00:55:51.560
more memorable than other things. We find some things

1096
00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.919
more emotionally evocative and attention grabbing than others. So

1097
00:55:54.919 --> 00:55:57.979
concepts in the world don't seem. HAVE equal access

1098
00:55:57.979 --> 00:56:00.820
to our evolved minds. Some things are just good

1099
00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:04.780
fits, but we're also, it's not just that we're

1100
00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:07.060
sitting back and some things are stickier for our

1101
00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:10.580
brains than others. Instead, we're actually like active participants

1102
00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:14.060
in our own cultural learning because cultural learning, it's

1103
00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:16.820
all about trying to learn how to survive and

1104
00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:19.409
thrive in the world. Um, AND, and we're really

1105
00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:22.330
active participants in that process. So we try to

1106
00:56:22.649 --> 00:56:23.929
look at the world and try to figure out

1107
00:56:23.929 --> 00:56:26.250
who do we want to learn from. Do I,

1108
00:56:26.330 --> 00:56:28.530
if I'm trying to learn how to be good

1109
00:56:28.530 --> 00:56:30.330
at something, do I just pick somebody at random

1110
00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:33.409
and start copying what they do? Um, THAT'S probably

1111
00:56:33.409 --> 00:56:36.129
not going to be a super great option. Um,

1112
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:38.850
BUT there might be other strategies that I could

1113
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:42.320
adopt to extract useful cultural information from the world.

1114
00:56:42.709 --> 00:56:47.120
Um, SO, The cultural evolution crowd has broadly sorted

1115
00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:53.120
these learning strategies into two kind of different, different

1116
00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.879
categories. So there's content biased learning, which is just

1117
00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:58.760
the idea that some concepts are sticky. So memory

1118
00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:02.739
biases would fit here, emotion biases where some information

1119
00:57:02.739 --> 00:57:05.719
interacts with our mental apparatus in a way that

1120
00:57:05.719 --> 00:57:08.399
it's more likely to stick around and get transmitted.

1121
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.709
So that's content biases, and it seems like the

1122
00:57:12.709 --> 00:57:15.389
cognitive science of religion work was all about these

1123
00:57:15.389 --> 00:57:19.719
content biases. So minimally countering stuff is hyperactive agency

1124
00:57:19.719 --> 00:57:21.550
detection, if that was ever a thing that we

1125
00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:25.949
had substantiated, that's again another content bias, but that's

1126
00:57:25.949 --> 00:57:30.050
only. A portion of the cultural evolution picture because

1127
00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:32.090
we also care a lot about who we're learning

1128
00:57:32.090 --> 00:57:33.770
from and so we can think of these as

1129
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:36.810
context biases. This is which sources of information do

1130
00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:39.209
we turn to and here you have strategies like

1131
00:57:39.209 --> 00:57:41.370
conformist learning, which is where, you know, I could

1132
00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:44.610
try to adopt what are kind of normative majority

1133
00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:47.610
opinions in the world or practices. And you could

1134
00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:49.489
think of if you were plopped down in a

1135
00:57:49.489 --> 00:57:52.090
new context and like you're plopped down in the

1136
00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:54.649
middle of the Amazon and you need to survive.

1137
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:57.389
If you see other people there and most people

1138
00:57:57.389 --> 00:58:00.229
are, say, drinking from this spring, you can copy

1139
00:58:00.229 --> 00:58:03.409
that. They're all drinking and they haven't died. Um,

1140
00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:05.590
SO conformist learning can be good for kind of

1141
00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:10.469
like learning these basic skills. Um, NOW, conformist learning

1142
00:58:10.469 --> 00:58:13.070
will get you up to kind of cultural baseline,

1143
00:58:13.229 --> 00:58:15.060
but you're not, you're not really going to thrive.

1144
00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:16.790
If you want to get ahead, now you want

1145
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:20.270
to instead of copying everyone, um, you want to

1146
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:21.989
try to find ways to copy the people who

1147
00:58:21.989 --> 00:58:25.239
are the most successful. Um, SO you could copy

1148
00:58:25.709 --> 00:58:28.629
successful prestigious individuals. So we have learning biases for

1149
00:58:28.629 --> 00:58:30.229
trying to find who are the best people to

1150
00:58:30.229 --> 00:58:34.939
learn from, um. Uh, AND in that case, we

1151
00:58:34.939 --> 00:58:39.409
want to learn from successful people, um, which gives

1152
00:58:39.419 --> 00:58:42.729
successful people the potential to kind of exploit people,

1153
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:44.739
because if let's say I'm, you know, some big

1154
00:58:44.739 --> 00:58:46.620
wig and people are sucking up to me to

1155
00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:49.790
try to get access to my privileged information. If

1156
00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:51.030
I got sick of them, I could give them

1157
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:52.750
all bad information. I could tell them to go

1158
00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:54.989
eat poison mushrooms or something, and I just all

1159
00:58:54.989 --> 00:58:58.070
these suck ups. So it does look like we've

1160
00:58:58.070 --> 00:59:02.399
evolved some kind of epistemic defenses where we attend

1161
00:59:02.399 --> 00:59:05.699
to what Joe Henry could call credibility enhancing displays,

1162
00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:07.870
which is basically if people are willing to take

1163
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:11.070
action to kind of prove their beliefs, that gives

1164
00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:14.110
us a kind of we lend a more credence

1165
00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:17.590
to the underlying beliefs, um. So that's just like

1166
00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:20.949
a quick illustration of the fuller arsenal of cultural

1167
00:59:20.949 --> 00:59:24.149
evolution where yes there are the content biases that

1168
00:59:24.149 --> 00:59:27.149
cognitive scientists of religion talk about, but there's also

1169
00:59:27.149 --> 00:59:29.629
this much bigger class of context biases which is

1170
00:59:29.629 --> 00:59:31.870
asking who we're learning from and which types of

1171
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:34.149
cues are we paying attention to to kind of

1172
00:59:34.149 --> 00:59:36.030
prove the sincerity of people's beliefs.

1173
00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:39.909
And do you think that something like cultural group

1174
00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:42.989
selection plays a role in religion? And, and by

1175
00:59:42.989 --> 00:59:45.389
the way, what is cultural group selection?

1176
00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:49.699
Yeah, this is kind of fun and potentially tricky

1177
00:59:49.699 --> 00:59:52.209
territory. So in the book, at least I said

1178
00:59:52.209 --> 00:59:56.129
if we want to understand not just how people

1179
00:59:56.129 --> 00:59:59.310
came to have the capacity to believe in gods,

1180
00:59:59.409 --> 01:00:02.330
but if we want to understand at the broader

1181
01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:05.889
kind of global across time scale, how is it

1182
01:00:05.889 --> 01:00:09.600
that some religions have have really spread really fast

1183
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.250
and most religions pop up and die out pretty

1184
01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:15.800
quickly. They just don't catch on. Um, AND so

1185
01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:18.520
I tried to pitch in the book building off

1186
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.649
some work on religious prosociality that's been coming together

1187
01:00:21.649 --> 01:00:24.610
over the last 1520 years. The notion that if

1188
01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:27.489
we want to figure out which religions kind of

1189
01:00:27.489 --> 01:00:30.969
prosper and survive, we need to think about what

1190
01:00:30.969 --> 01:00:35.350
are the consequences for group functioning that. Different religious

1191
01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:39.750
beliefs, norms, and practices might have. So a concrete

1192
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:42.469
way to look at this is if we consider

1193
01:00:42.469 --> 01:00:45.260
the shakers and the latter-day saints. These are two

1194
01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:48.459
different kind of Christian offshoot religious groups that hit

1195
01:00:48.459 --> 01:00:51.080
their heyday in the United States in the 18

1196
01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:55.489
and 1900s, and they both Started as kind of

1197
01:00:55.489 --> 01:00:59.280
utopian communes set a bit apart from society. The

1198
01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.479
shakers were known for what was at the time

1199
01:01:02.479 --> 01:01:06.010
radical egalitarianism. Women could assume leadership positions in the

1200
01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:08.449
church and in their in their communities to a

1201
01:01:08.449 --> 01:01:10.590
degree that you wouldn't necessarily expect from, you know,

1202
01:01:10.919 --> 01:01:16.489
18 and 1900s America. And, and then the Latter-day

1203
01:01:16.489 --> 01:01:18.770
Saints also popped up around the same time. Um,

1204
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.469
AND we could look at specific religious beliefs and

1205
01:01:23.469 --> 01:01:24.949
see what that might have to do with the

1206
01:01:24.949 --> 01:01:28.360
success of these two religions over time. And so

1207
01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.909
different religious beliefs and norms can go in different

1208
01:01:30.909 --> 01:01:33.310
themes. So some sometimes they'll have cooperative norms. How

1209
01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:35.110
do we treat each other within the group? Or

1210
01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:37.909
you might have reproductive norms. Are we having more

1211
01:01:37.909 --> 01:01:41.959
kids or less kids in this? Um, AND LDS

1212
01:01:41.959 --> 01:01:45.959
and the Shakers really had strikingly different reproductive norms.

1213
01:01:46.409 --> 01:01:50.719
Uh, SO LDS, especially early on really encouraged large

1214
01:01:50.719 --> 01:01:53.199
families. Uh, PLURAL marriage was a thing among church

1215
01:01:53.199 --> 01:01:57.639
leaders, um, and, uh, yeah, have lots of kids,

1216
01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.280
take care of them. Your kids are going to

1217
01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.919
have lots of kids, and you can illustrate this

1218
01:02:01.919 --> 01:02:05.679
with, I think it's the status within either 50

1219
01:02:05.679 --> 01:02:08.370
or 60 years of his death. Brigham Young was

1220
01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:13.000
the second big LDS leader. Um, HE had multiple

1221
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.290
wives, had something. 50 kids. A lot of his

1222
01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:18.250
sons went on to have multiple wives, tons of

1223
01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:20.610
kids, and so within, I think it was 50

1224
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:22.969
years of Brigham Young's death, he had like 1000

1225
01:02:22.969 --> 01:02:26.070
living descendants, which is a staggering number. If you

1226
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:28.290
think of any of your ancestors who had big

1227
01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:31.810
families, they didn't have 1000 living descendants within, within

1228
01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:35.550
a short time span after their death. So LDS

1229
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:39.120
Church, really pro reproduction, have lots of kids. The

1230
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.020
shakers, on the other hand, practiced universal celibacy. Uh,

1231
01:02:42.639 --> 01:02:45.479
THEY, they took their original sin very seriously, so

1232
01:02:45.479 --> 01:02:50.760
they said universal celibacy, um, no marriage. Now, you

1233
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.120
have one group having lots of kids and one

1234
01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.000
mandating universal celibacy, which group do you think did

1235
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.479
better over time? Uh, IT turns out LDS is

1236
01:02:59.479 --> 01:03:01.639
one of the faster growing religions in the world

1237
01:03:01.639 --> 01:03:04.689
over the last 100 years, um. And when I

1238
01:03:04.689 --> 01:03:07.250
did some digging, I think the, the current active

1239
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.489
membership list in the Shakers' Church is like 3

1240
01:03:09.489 --> 01:03:13.850
people, um, because they're just, they're not reproducing, um.

1241
01:03:14.729 --> 01:03:16.719
And so that's just kind of one example of

1242
01:03:16.719 --> 01:03:21.139
how religious norms around one particular thing, in this

1243
01:03:21.139 --> 01:03:24.600
case reproduction, can have profound impacts for the long

1244
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.919
run success of these two groups. If you have

1245
01:03:27.919 --> 01:03:31.760
norms that encourage reproduction, OK, your group's going to

1246
01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.320
grow. If you have norms that say no reproduction,

1247
01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.020
your group's going to dwindle. Um. So we could

1248
01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:41.879
think of religions as having lots of different norms,

1249
01:03:41.959 --> 01:03:44.899
not just reproduction, but also norms about, say, missionary

1250
01:03:44.899 --> 01:03:49.139
outreach or cooperation within or militaristic takeover. These are

1251
01:03:49.139 --> 01:03:53.179
like different settings that different religions could have. Cultural

1252
01:03:53.179 --> 01:03:56.139
group selection is just the idea that cultural groups

1253
01:03:56.139 --> 01:03:59.780
might kind of stabilize and cohere around different sets

1254
01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.409
of internally stable norms so that within each group

1255
01:04:03.409 --> 01:04:05.340
it pays to do what everybody else is doing.

1256
01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:08.939
Uh, IF you're in a higher reproduction group, yeah,

1257
01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.659
you're better off kind of going with the flow

1258
01:04:10.659 --> 01:04:12.139
and also having lots of kids. If you're in

1259
01:04:12.139 --> 01:04:14.959
a group that's all about missionary outreach, yeah, you,

1260
01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.739
you should kind of do that or move to

1261
01:04:16.739 --> 01:04:18.889
a different group that's a better fit for your,

1262
01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:22.080
for your interests. Um, AND if we have all

1263
01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.800
these different groups with different clusters of norms kind

1264
01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.439
of driven by their religious beliefs, then we could

1265
01:04:27.439 --> 01:04:30.719
think of the consequences that those different settings might

1266
01:04:30.719 --> 01:04:33.560
have on long run success and groups that find

1267
01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.639
good ways to promote stability and cooperation within the

1268
01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:40.989
group, um, promote reproduction in. Rearing promote missionary outreach.

1269
01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.199
These groups are going to thrive and spread, and

1270
01:04:44.199 --> 01:04:48.370
there's some reasonably compelling work over the years that

1271
01:04:48.659 --> 01:04:51.679
the kind of religious notion of these big moralizing

1272
01:04:51.679 --> 01:04:54.550
powerful gods who can monitor human behavior and they

1273
01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:56.379
care what people are thinking about and they care

1274
01:04:56.379 --> 01:04:59.360
how we treat each other. The beliefs in that

1275
01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.159
kind of God seem to be good at getting

1276
01:05:02.159 --> 01:05:04.199
people to be a bit more cooperative within the

1277
01:05:04.199 --> 01:05:07.520
group, which could have profound impacts for kind of

1278
01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.679
the long run success of these groups. So it

1279
01:05:09.679 --> 01:05:11.800
looks like the religions that have done well have

1280
01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.040
these kinds of big moralizing gods that can potentially

1281
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.959
enable kind of cooperation to start ratcheting up in

1282
01:05:18.959 --> 01:05:19.770
our lineage.

1283
01:05:21.439 --> 01:05:25.229
So, uh, since you mentioned big gods, is there

1284
01:05:25.229 --> 01:05:29.040
a relationship between big gods and prosociality?

1285
01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:32.310
Um, YEAH, that's a great question. We can kind

1286
01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:34.949
of look at it at a few different levels

1287
01:05:34.949 --> 01:05:38.149
of analysis. Some people have done kind of broad

1288
01:05:38.149 --> 01:05:42.189
cross-cultural work and if we look at different groups

1289
01:05:42.189 --> 01:05:45.429
of people, there's some like good cross-cultural data sets

1290
01:05:45.429 --> 01:05:47.989
where you could code what kinds of religious beliefs

1291
01:05:47.989 --> 01:05:49.909
does this group have and then what's kind of

1292
01:05:49.909 --> 01:05:53.149
the levels of social complexity and coordination. So are

1293
01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:57.030
we seeing big cooperative societies. Um, VERSUS kind of

1294
01:05:57.030 --> 01:06:00.699
smaller, more localized ones, and you can simultaneously code,

1295
01:06:00.739 --> 01:06:03.060
well, do they have a big moralizing kind of

1296
01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.860
universalistic, universalistic god or is it a smaller local

1297
01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.820
god who might be morally concerned, but they're like

1298
01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:11.659
morally concerned about what's happening in the village, you

1299
01:06:11.659 --> 01:06:13.820
know, are the kids quiet at night as opposed

1300
01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:17.719
to, you know, matters of broad geopolitical import that

1301
01:06:17.719 --> 01:06:21.250
like a big moralizing God might have, um. And

1302
01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:25.850
there is some reasonably decent evidence on that that

1303
01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:28.209
groups that tend to hold more of these big

1304
01:06:28.209 --> 01:06:30.729
moralizing God beliefs do tend to show kind of

1305
01:06:30.729 --> 01:06:34.489
higher degrees of cooperative complexity. Some of that work

1306
01:06:34.489 --> 01:06:36.729
has been challenged because the data going into the

1307
01:06:36.729 --> 01:06:39.270
data set, especially the coding of. A lot of

1308
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:43.110
it's being coded from early ethnographies, which are themselves

1309
01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:46.590
coming from like primary missionary contact in colonial days,

1310
01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.989
which is, you know, these might not have been

1311
01:06:48.989 --> 01:06:52.510
the most skilled ethnographic recorders and may have brought

1312
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:56.659
some kind of cultural biases to that project. Um,

1313
01:06:57.310 --> 01:06:59.500
BUT we can also look at other ways where

1314
01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:01.830
Joe Henri and his team had a good paper

1315
01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:03.310
and I forget if it was Science or Nature,

1316
01:07:03.389 --> 01:07:05.639
they looked in a bunch of kind of smaller

1317
01:07:05.639 --> 01:07:09.659
scale, more like forager level societies, but could code

1318
01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:12.870
based on whether these societies also subscribe to kind

1319
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:17.149
of one of the big world moralizing religions, so

1320
01:07:17.149 --> 01:07:20.510
Christianity, Islam, Judaism, things like that. And when they

1321
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:23.629
code that it's groups that do hold these types

1322
01:07:23.629 --> 01:07:27.669
of big God beliefs are more anonymously generous in,

1323
01:07:27.709 --> 01:07:32.030
say, experimental economic games. So kind of at the

1324
01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:34.149
most zoomed out level I think we have reasonably

1325
01:07:34.149 --> 01:07:37.429
OK evidence that certain types of religious beliefs tend

1326
01:07:37.429 --> 01:07:40.459
to cluster together with certain types of cooperative outcomes,

1327
01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:43.290
and it generally points to a correlation between big

1328
01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:46.669
gods and kind of bigger, more complex cooperative societies.

1329
01:07:47.979 --> 01:07:50.649
We could drill down then and ask, well, do

1330
01:07:50.649 --> 01:07:53.409
we find similar evidence at the individual level? So

1331
01:07:53.409 --> 01:07:56.489
if I get individual believers into the lab and

1332
01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:58.530
say remind them of their religious beliefs, can I

1333
01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:01.350
make them more cooperative? Um, AND the idea there

1334
01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:03.600
is, you know, This is coming out of like

1335
01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.760
a social psychology tradition where we're interested in how

1336
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.439
people act across different contexts because even the most

1337
01:08:10.439 --> 01:08:13.320
religious person in the world, religion is not front

1338
01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:16.620
and center 24/7. Like sometimes you're at the grocery

1339
01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:20.240
store buying groceries or you have a job or

1340
01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.640
maybe you have to navigate a queue on public

1341
01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.919
transit. Like religion just can't be the main point

1342
01:08:25.919 --> 01:08:29.979
of focus all the time, um. So potentially what

1343
01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:32.140
we could do as experimentalists is we could find

1344
01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:35.020
ways to bring religion from background to foreground and

1345
01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.500
see if people act a bit different. So there's

1346
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.180
been kind of a thriving cottage industry and social

1347
01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:43.419
psyche on what's called religious priming, which is just

1348
01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:45.540
basically it's a bunch of different experiments where you

1349
01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:48.060
find ways to get people to think religious thoughts.

1350
01:08:48.419 --> 01:08:50.250
And if they're, if you kind of get religion

1351
01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:52.330
on their mind, you can see if they kind

1352
01:08:52.330 --> 01:08:55.890
of behave differently in other ways. And one of

1353
01:08:55.890 --> 01:08:58.330
the early big studies on this came out in

1354
01:08:58.330 --> 01:09:01.850
2007. Zoom Sharif and RNR and Za published this

1355
01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:04.330
paper where they claimed, all right, if we have

1356
01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:07.890
people do a subtle experimental task that gets them

1357
01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:10.930
to it primes religious thinking and then have them

1358
01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:13.910
play a game that measures anonymous generosity. In their

1359
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:17.029
first paper they reported these whoppingly large effects where

1360
01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:19.350
you have people play this little word game that

1361
01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:21.950
gets them thinking about religion and then all of

1362
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:25.029
a sudden they're way more generous in an experimental

1363
01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:29.100
economic game and yeah, that spawned a cottage industry

1364
01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.229
where by now there's dozens of papers taking their

1365
01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:34.069
same experimental manipulation where they play this weird little

1366
01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:36.390
word game that supposedly gets them thinking about religion.

1367
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:38.740
And then you plug in whatever outcome measure that

1368
01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:41.060
you want. It felt like for a while, a

1369
01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:42.740
few times a year there'd be a new paper

1370
01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:47.299
linking that religious prime to a different outcome. But

1371
01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:51.250
some researchers, most notably Robert Ross has pointed out

1372
01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:54.500
none of these religious priming studies have ever survived

1373
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.870
an independent replication attempt. So every time somebody comes

1374
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:59.339
back and says, I'm going to take this little

1375
01:09:59.339 --> 01:10:03.379
scrambled sentence game that the. Paper used as a

1376
01:10:03.379 --> 01:10:05.540
religious prime and I'm going to pair it with

1377
01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:08.939
some outcome measure. EVERY time so far that somebody's

1378
01:10:08.939 --> 01:10:11.410
gone back and retried one of those experiments with

1379
01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:13.660
a tight experimental protocol, they can't get the same

1380
01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:17.700
results, which is interesting because I think the theoretical

1381
01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:22.589
story that We'd expect these religious cooperation effects to

1382
01:10:22.589 --> 01:10:25.430
only turn up when religion's on people's minds. This

1383
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:27.430
makes sense. It's also something we see in the

1384
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:31.830
world where successful religions find ways to remind people

1385
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:34.779
of religion throughout, like you can think of like

1386
01:10:34.779 --> 01:10:37.509
5 times daily called the prayer in Islam. That's

1387
01:10:37.509 --> 01:10:39.990
a way to remind people of religious norms throughout

1388
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:43.430
the day. Or sometimes you'll see evangelicals with like

1389
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:45.950
the What would Jesus do bracelet. That's just a

1390
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.870
way to remind yourself a bunch throughout the day.

1391
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:52.419
So. I'm guessing that successful religions are doing they're,

1392
01:10:52.629 --> 01:10:56.069
they're having these religious reminders because they work, but

1393
01:10:56.069 --> 01:10:59.299
then we have experimental laboratory evidence that seems not

1394
01:10:59.299 --> 01:11:01.709
to hold up and along with my colleague at

1395
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:04.490
Brunel, Ayanna Willard, we're doing some projects now where

1396
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:07.189
we're just looking at that experimental task that they

1397
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:08.830
use where people play this weird little word game

1398
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:11.859
to prime religion. Um, AND we've just gone back

1399
01:11:11.859 --> 01:11:13.939
to check and say, well, are people more likely

1400
01:11:13.939 --> 01:11:16.100
to be thinking about religion after they've done that

1401
01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.660
task than otherwise? And the answer is no. So

1402
01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:22.100
the priming manipulation doesn't actually do anything, which means

1403
01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.899
that that initial priming result is almost certainly a

1404
01:11:24.899 --> 01:11:28.620
false positive. It just hasn't held up well. But

1405
01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.259
other researchers have found other ways to test the

1406
01:11:31.259 --> 01:11:35.270
same hypothesis without using that same priming manipulation. And

1407
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:37.629
it turns out if you use kind of a

1408
01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:41.229
more valid experimental manipulation, you can still get the

1409
01:11:41.229 --> 01:11:43.700
same results that they reported. You don't get these

1410
01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:47.310
bigly large effects. Those were always larger than we

1411
01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:51.509
should have taken seriously, but you can, enough people

1412
01:11:51.509 --> 01:11:54.500
by now have done studies where if you More

1413
01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.629
overtly remind people of their religious faith, you can

1414
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:59.660
kind of alter their behavior a bit and so

1415
01:12:00.029 --> 01:12:03.379
that work has largely supported this religious prosociality view

1416
01:12:03.379 --> 01:12:06.910
even though the most famous, most cited religious priming

1417
01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:09.479
study probably doesn't report anything we should pay attention

1418
01:12:09.479 --> 01:12:09.750
to.

1419
01:12:11.319 --> 01:12:13.529
So let me ask you now because we've gone

1420
01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:16.890
through several different ways that people approach religion and

1421
01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:21.399
how it gets transmitted, etc. Uh, WHAT about indoctrination?

1422
01:12:21.529 --> 01:12:23.959
Because there are people out there who claim that

1423
01:12:23.959 --> 01:12:26.890
religion is mostly or at least to some extent

1424
01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:29.720
the result of indoctrination. Is that true in any

1425
01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:29.939
way?

1426
01:12:30.939 --> 01:12:33.890
Yeah, that's a really widespread belief out there that,

1427
01:12:33.930 --> 01:12:37.209
you know, religion persists because we have these coercive

1428
01:12:37.209 --> 01:12:39.879
adults who are forcing it down their kids' throats

1429
01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:43.810
and Justin Barrett and some of his religion books,

1430
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:45.750
he's taken pretty steady aim on that where he

1431
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:49.689
said, look, I'm not saying that there's no religious

1432
01:12:49.689 --> 01:12:52.410
indoctrination in the world, but he's kind of saying

1433
01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:55.209
there's not enough indoctrination to explain the high levels

1434
01:12:55.209 --> 01:12:59.379
of belief we see. So we see um. A

1435
01:12:59.379 --> 01:13:02.540
lot of social transmission of religious beliefs, that's not

1436
01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:06.299
heavy-handed indoctrination, but it's just kind of like basic

1437
01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.910
teaching and learning and observational learning on kids' part.

1438
01:13:09.589 --> 01:13:11.899
So we can have social transmission of things without

1439
01:13:11.899 --> 01:13:15.580
it being coercive indoctrination, and I would certainly agree

1440
01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.339
with him on that point that we have plenty

1441
01:13:17.339 --> 01:13:22.299
of evidence that religion is socially transmitted and very

1442
01:13:22.299 --> 01:13:25.660
little evidence that heavy-handed indoctrination is kind of the

1443
01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:30.080
primary source of, of that social transmission. What's always

1444
01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.689
been interesting to me is you will see that

1445
01:13:32.689 --> 01:13:37.129
the indoctrination account is sometimes widespread in new atheist

1446
01:13:37.129 --> 01:13:39.839
circles where they'll say like Dawkins has written that

1447
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:45.609
like just raising kids religious is child abuse, and

1448
01:13:45.609 --> 01:13:48.810
he's mostly leaning on the indoctrination side here. And

1449
01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:50.569
this has been puzzling to me because in his

1450
01:13:50.569 --> 01:13:53.609
religion books, he's postulated, as we were mentioning, this

1451
01:13:53.609 --> 01:13:56.270
kind of gullibility angle where kids are so gullible,

1452
01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:59.240
they just believe whatever their parents say. Um, BUT

1453
01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.680
then he's also saying, well, religion persists because of

1454
01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:07.629
this hard, heavy-handed indoctrination, but those two proposals postulate

1455
01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:12.680
entirely different child psychologies. So if kids believe whatever

1456
01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.419
their parents tell them, You wouldn't need any indoctrination

1457
01:14:16.419 --> 01:14:17.859
because parents could just tell them whatever they want.

1458
01:14:17.899 --> 01:14:21.419
There's no effort there, whereas heavy-handed indoctrination implies a

1459
01:14:21.419 --> 01:14:24.660
child psychology that's somewhat resistant to picking up these

1460
01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:27.339
concepts. That's why we need indoctrination. So if we,

1461
01:14:27.379 --> 01:14:29.939
if the gullibility angle was true, we wouldn't need

1462
01:14:29.939 --> 01:14:32.930
any indoctrination. If the indoctrination angle was true, the

1463
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:35.569
gullibility one wouldn't make any sense. So pick a

1464
01:14:35.569 --> 01:14:39.930
lane, guys, um. Yes, so I think again, I

1465
01:14:39.930 --> 01:14:42.899
mean the main point here is social transmission, absolutely

1466
01:14:42.899 --> 01:14:46.100
yes, indoctrination, it doesn't seem to be necessary.

1467
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:49.750
Do we have any idea at all about how

1468
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:52.950
many atheists are there in the world and across

1469
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:54.180
different societies?

1470
01:14:55.609 --> 01:14:59.080
Yeah, so I've come to think over the last

1471
01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:02.459
5 or 6 years that Really just pinning down

1472
01:15:02.459 --> 01:15:05.629
some basic facts about atheism will really help us

1473
01:15:05.629 --> 01:15:08.000
kind of develop theory, um, because even some of

1474
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.600
the basics like how many atheists are there out

1475
01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.839
there turns out to not be that easy to

1476
01:15:12.839 --> 01:15:16.040
estimate, estimate and some of our existing estimates are

1477
01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.589
probably not accurate. Um, SO for global estimates it's

1478
01:15:19.589 --> 01:15:22.069
really tricky to come up with a solid one

1479
01:15:22.069 --> 01:15:25.750
because individual countries don't kind of consistently ask about

1480
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:28.750
religious beliefs and things like a census, so we

1481
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:32.189
don't have apples to apples comparisons. Even some large

1482
01:15:32.189 --> 01:15:36.310
scale polling companies will ask people in lots of

1483
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:39.390
different countries about attitudes and values, including about religious

1484
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:43.740
beliefs, but there's kind of patchy and inequitable coverage

1485
01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:46.589
of countries on these kinds of survey. So we

1486
01:15:46.589 --> 01:15:49.430
have really good data and coverage in North America,

1487
01:15:49.589 --> 01:15:54.029
Western Europe, parts of Asia, a lot of Africa,

1488
01:15:54.069 --> 01:15:55.950
we have very little data coming out of it.

1489
01:15:56.029 --> 01:15:59.390
A lot of the global South really is understudied

1490
01:15:59.390 --> 01:16:00.839
in a lot of this, so we just don't

1491
01:16:00.839 --> 01:16:04.790
have great data. And then the survey companies don't

1492
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:07.910
necessarily ask the same questions about religious belief, and

1493
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:11.069
they don't necessarily ask questions that directly translate to

1494
01:16:11.069 --> 01:16:14.549
an atheism prevalence estimate, um. But we could look,

1495
01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:16.859
say, just within the US, where we've had good

1496
01:16:16.859 --> 01:16:21.580
polling for decades, and so Gallup and Pew, for

1497
01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:25.979
instance, on polls where there's different approaches to measuring

1498
01:16:25.979 --> 01:16:27.569
it. One of them I call it the religious

1499
01:16:27.569 --> 01:16:30.419
menu approach where you'd say, all right, pick your

1500
01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:34.830
religious identity from a list. Are you Catholic, Protestant,

1501
01:16:35.029 --> 01:16:41.450
Jewish, Sunni, Shia? Um, Zoroastrian, atheist, agnostic, whatever, and

1502
01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:42.770
then you can just look at how many people

1503
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:46.490
check the atheist box and in the US that

1504
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:49.410
number of waivers, but we're only looking at like

1505
01:16:49.410 --> 01:16:51.729
2 to 5% of people would check the atheist

1506
01:16:51.729 --> 01:16:55.049
box. Um, NOW another way you can measure atheist

1507
01:16:55.049 --> 01:16:57.290
prevalence is a lot of the times these survey

1508
01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:59.689
companies will ask people, Do you believe in God?

1509
01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:02.680
Yes or no. Um, BY definition, the people who

1510
01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.759
said no are atheists, whether or not they choose

1511
01:17:04.759 --> 01:17:07.600
to identify with that as like a positive keg

1512
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.529
for me. That's just what the word means. If

1513
01:17:09.529 --> 01:17:11.560
you say you don't believe in God, technically you're

1514
01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.839
an atheist. Um, AND those surveys will return a

1515
01:17:15.839 --> 01:17:18.720
higher estimate than the initial one. So it might

1516
01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:21.680
be 2 to 5% of people identify positively with

1517
01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.399
the label atheist, but in the US nowadays, the

1518
01:17:25.399 --> 01:17:28.680
surveys are showing something like 17 to 20% of

1519
01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:31.279
people would say, I don't believe in God, which

1520
01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:33.720
is a pretty big gap. Like our atheism estimate

1521
01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.600
just within the US is 4 times higher for

1522
01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:40.529
one question than the other one, Now imagine scaling

1523
01:17:40.529 --> 01:17:42.649
that up to surveys in a bunch of different

1524
01:17:42.649 --> 01:17:44.890
countries, and then you've got a bunch of countries

1525
01:17:44.890 --> 01:17:47.649
where we don't have, you know, anything even that

1526
01:17:47.649 --> 01:17:50.290
direct. So it becomes really hard to try to

1527
01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:53.410
come up with a global picture just because the

1528
01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:55.569
data aren't there. So what we've tried to do

1529
01:17:55.569 --> 01:17:58.319
is look in places where we have good coverage

1530
01:17:58.649 --> 01:18:00.770
and try to see, well, even then if we

1531
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:03.410
just use that kind of 17 to 20% estimate

1532
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:05.209
of people in the US saying they don't believe

1533
01:18:05.209 --> 01:18:08.020
in God. Could we then say that no more

1534
01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:11.700
than 20% of the US are atheists, um, but

1535
01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:14.279
some work I've had over the years with students

1536
01:18:14.279 --> 01:18:18.660
Maxi Naha and Nava Kaloi now, where we've tried

1537
01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:22.620
to find ways to indirectly measure atheist prevalence in

1538
01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:26.830
a way that people don't have to. Just out

1539
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:30.169
and out tell us they're an atheist because atheism

1540
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:32.660
is heavily stigmatized in large parts of the world,

1541
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:35.990
including in the US People hold really persistent negative

1542
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:38.830
attitudes towards atheists, and it specifically seems to cohere

1543
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:42.629
around themes of moral distrust. So if you're a

1544
01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:45.979
pollster and you're asking people about their religious beliefs,

1545
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:49.919
the atheists, you're kind of asking them to self-identify

1546
01:18:49.919 --> 01:18:53.750
as belonging to a stigmatized group. And if you're

1547
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:56.790
ever asking, trying to get an estimate of something

1548
01:18:56.790 --> 01:19:00.029
that's socially undesirable and you're doing it with self-reports,

1549
01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.270
you're going to need a lot of people who

1550
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:03.390
probably fit that category but just don't want to

1551
01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:06.470
tell you about it. Um, SO that led us

1552
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:08.669
to think that a lot of these. ARE probably

1553
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:13.029
underestimating atheist prevalence, and if we could find experimental

1554
01:19:13.029 --> 01:19:15.669
tasks that allow people to signal that they don't

1555
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:17.729
believe in God without having to just come out

1556
01:19:17.729 --> 01:19:19.990
and say it, we might get even higher atheist

1557
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:24.109
prevalence estimates. So we published a paper in 2018

1558
01:19:24.109 --> 01:19:27.310
or so at the time, Gallup and Pew were

1559
01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:30.270
saying that there were 10 or 11% atheists in

1560
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:32.669
the US using the Do you believe in God?

1561
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:36.580
Yes, no measure. And when we ran a survey

1562
01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:40.259
with a kind of fun indirect measurement test, our

1563
01:19:40.259 --> 01:19:42.979
estimates were coming back at 26%. So they're saying

1564
01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:47.419
11%. We're saying it's probably more like 26%, um.

1565
01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:52.049
And we've since kind of refined that experimental task,

1566
01:19:52.339 --> 01:19:55.140
and we're in the process of kind of analyzing

1567
01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:57.939
data where we ran the same survey in the

1568
01:19:57.939 --> 01:20:02.950
United States, Argentina, China, France, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia

1569
01:20:03.450 --> 01:20:05.020
just to see, you know, we've got a big

1570
01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:08.229
gap in the US between self-reported atheism and indirect

1571
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:13.020
estimates. Do we find similar gaps in other places?

1572
01:20:13.089 --> 01:20:14.859
And in that sample, you know, we have the

1573
01:20:14.859 --> 01:20:17.620
US again. Uh, WE had a couple of countries

1574
01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:22.339
where religion is again, you know, probably even, even

1575
01:20:22.339 --> 01:20:25.859
a bigger deal. Um, IT'S kind of more socially

1576
01:20:25.859 --> 01:20:28.779
reinforced. So in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, for instance,

1577
01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:32.180
these are countries where people really report it's important

1578
01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:38.080
to be religious here. Um, YOU, uh, In like

1579
01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.959
Gallup and Pew surveys, they'll ask people, Do you

1580
01:20:39.959 --> 01:20:42.879
agree with the statement? You must believe in a

1581
01:20:42.879 --> 01:20:45.680
God to be moral, which is a pretty heavy-handed

1582
01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.479
way to look at kind of the social pressure

1583
01:20:47.479 --> 01:20:50.399
favoring religion in those countries it's like 90+% of

1584
01:20:50.399 --> 01:20:52.870
people say absolutely you must be a religious believer

1585
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:55.279
to be moral. But then we have countries like

1586
01:20:55.279 --> 01:20:57.040
China and France that have swung in the other

1587
01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:00.879
direction. They're heavily secular. Most people are self-reporting that

1588
01:21:00.879 --> 01:21:03.220
they don't believe in a God. Um, AND at

1589
01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:05.500
least at our early peaks of the data in

1590
01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:08.140
all of these countries, we're finding evidence that atheism

1591
01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:11.859
is undercounted, so we're finding kind of closeted atheists

1592
01:21:11.859 --> 01:21:14.299
when we measure it indirectly. Now in China and

1593
01:21:14.299 --> 01:21:16.770
France, there's only a few of them. It's not,

1594
01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:20.100
it's not, you know, in a country where 80%

1595
01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:22.029
of people say they don't believe in God, there's

1596
01:21:22.029 --> 01:21:24.180
not much point to hiding that you're an atheist

1597
01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:29.089
too. Um, BUT we're finding sizeable gaps in Indonesia

1598
01:21:29.089 --> 01:21:31.500
and Saudi Arabia where not as many people are

1599
01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.220
self-reporting that they don't believe in God, but on

1600
01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:38.700
the indirect estimate it's, it's reasonably high again. And

1601
01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:41.819
so really everywhere we've looked, we've found that the

1602
01:21:41.819 --> 01:21:46.859
self-report estimate is too low, um. So if I

1603
01:21:46.859 --> 01:21:48.919
had to hazard a guess globally for how many

1604
01:21:48.919 --> 01:21:53.180
atheists we have, Phil Zuckerman in 2007, looking only

1605
01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:57.259
at self-report data, estimated 500 to 700 million atheists

1606
01:21:57.259 --> 01:22:00.490
in the world, if I figure kind of 100,

1607
01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:03.259
2007, the world's changed since then, both in terms

1608
01:22:03.259 --> 01:22:07.069
of global population and spread of self-reported atheism. And

1609
01:22:07.069 --> 01:22:09.259
then if we tack on the recent evidence that

1610
01:22:09.259 --> 01:22:12.899
we're finding atheists who are closeted everywhere we've looked

1611
01:22:12.899 --> 01:22:15.180
so far, I'd say we could push the estimate

1612
01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:16.890
up to 2 billion maybe.

1613
01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:24.020
So around 1/4 of the global population.

1614
01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:28.930
Yeah, I'd place my bet somewhere in there, which

1615
01:22:28.930 --> 01:22:31.169
is interesting because going back to cognitive science and

1616
01:22:31.169 --> 01:22:34.810
religion, one of their things was, oh, since religion

1617
01:22:34.810 --> 01:22:39.080
has emerged as a byproduct, religion comes naturally, and

1618
01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.729
atheism must be this kind of, it's hard to

1619
01:22:42.729 --> 01:22:45.569
get going. It must take cognitive effort to maintain

1620
01:22:45.569 --> 01:22:48.450
it, and some of the cognitive science of religion

1621
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:51.700
books explicitly say atheism is rare. Whereas if our

1622
01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:54.020
data is saying, well, 1 in 4 people might

1623
01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:57.100
be atheists, that's not particularly rare, guys. It's time

1624
01:22:57.100 --> 01:23:00.140
to rethink some of those theoretical assumptions.

1625
01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:03.529
And so, let's talk a little bit more about

1626
01:23:03.529 --> 01:23:07.589
that. Where does atheism come from? Are there different

1627
01:23:07.589 --> 01:23:10.259
paths that people follow and what are some of

1628
01:23:10.259 --> 01:23:13.600
the main factors that play a role there? Does

1629
01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.919
it have to do with, for example, specific cognitive

1630
01:23:16.919 --> 01:23:21.359
works or with environmental factors, life events? What do

1631
01:23:21.359 --> 01:23:22.189
we know about it?

1632
01:23:23.399 --> 01:23:25.990
Yeah, so on this one we've done a fair

1633
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:27.990
amount of work over the last decade or so

1634
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:30.149
trying to tease apart, you know, are there different

1635
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:32.509
factors that nudge people towards atheism? Are there different

1636
01:23:32.509 --> 01:23:35.870
pathways to atheism? And in this work we kind

1637
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:37.990
of thought of, well, what are the basic building

1638
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:41.549
blocks of building blocks of religion and what might

1639
01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:45.600
be disrupted to lead to atheism instead. Um, AND

1640
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:48.649
we kind of pin down as things that need

1641
01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:50.810
to be in place to have religious belief. One,

1642
01:23:51.009 --> 01:23:53.649
we need to have kind of the social cognitive

1643
01:23:53.649 --> 01:23:56.009
mind perception abilities that make it easy to think

1644
01:23:56.009 --> 01:23:59.169
about other minds. That seems to be from cognitive

1645
01:23:59.169 --> 01:24:01.649
science of religion, the core cognitive building block that

1646
01:24:01.649 --> 01:24:04.930
gives us the capacity for belief. Second, there's the

1647
01:24:04.930 --> 01:24:06.970
motivational side of it where we need to be

1648
01:24:06.970 --> 01:24:09.120
in circumstances where it seems like a good idea

1649
01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.759
to appeal to gods. A third is cultural learning.

1650
01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:14.720
So as we were talking about with cultural evolution

1651
01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:18.529
where we're picking beliefs up from others, we especially

1652
01:24:18.529 --> 01:24:21.919
seem to attend to these credibility enhancing displays of

1653
01:24:21.919 --> 01:24:24.479
faith where if we see other people in our

1654
01:24:24.479 --> 01:24:26.600
community doing stuff that seems like it would be

1655
01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:30.200
really costly if they weren't sincere believers, then that

1656
01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:33.779
ratchets up our own belief. That's really important. Um,

1657
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:35.549
AND so we kind of thought, well, these are

1658
01:24:35.549 --> 01:24:37.029
the things that need to be in place to

1659
01:24:37.029 --> 01:24:39.990
get police and maybe atheism just comes from disruptions

1660
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:43.770
in them. So for instance, uh, We kind of

1661
01:24:43.770 --> 01:24:47.419
speculated that there might be 4, probably more, but

1662
01:24:47.419 --> 01:24:49.689
4 that we could really pin down different pathways

1663
01:24:49.689 --> 01:24:52.689
to atheism. One is if you imagine that we

1664
01:24:52.689 --> 01:24:56.049
need this kind of mind perception ability and and

1665
01:24:56.049 --> 01:24:58.250
kind of mentalizing theory of mind, whatever you want

1666
01:24:58.250 --> 01:25:00.370
to call it, if that's kind of the core

1667
01:25:00.370 --> 01:25:04.049
building block, then it turns out there's individual differences

1668
01:25:04.049 --> 01:25:07.299
in people's advanced mentalizing abilities. Some people find it

1669
01:25:07.299 --> 01:25:11.049
easy and practically effortless to track complex social dynamics.

1670
01:25:11.729 --> 01:25:14.899
Other people like this guy don't like that task

1671
01:25:14.899 --> 01:25:18.169
of trying to track complicated things like that socially,

1672
01:25:19.169 --> 01:25:22.890
and it turns out there's small and not particularly

1673
01:25:22.890 --> 01:25:27.330
strong correlations where people who have really excellent high-end

1674
01:25:27.330 --> 01:25:29.439
mentalizing abilities tend to be a bit more religious

1675
01:25:29.439 --> 01:25:32.569
than people who find advanced mentalizing tasks a little

1676
01:25:32.569 --> 01:25:36.020
trickier. Um, SO that's one potential pathway to atheism,

1677
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:39.669
kind of focusing on the, the underlying cognitive apparatus

1678
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:42.220
that makes it easy to think about gods. Um,

1679
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.399
BUT

1680
01:25:43.399 --> 01:25:45.149
in, in that, let me just ask you, in

1681
01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:48.270
that case, people who are on the autism spectrum

1682
01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:51.029
would probably tend more toward atheism.

1683
01:25:52.609 --> 01:25:57.370
Potentially we ran one kind of self-report study years

1684
01:25:57.370 --> 01:26:00.689
ago that pointed in that direction. I think the

1685
01:26:00.689 --> 01:26:02.529
consensus now from people who have done a better

1686
01:26:02.529 --> 01:26:05.899
job looking at this like Inguassuri is a researcher

1687
01:26:05.899 --> 01:26:07.290
who does a lot of good work with religious

1688
01:26:07.290 --> 01:26:11.640
beliefs among people on the autism spectrum. And what

1689
01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.209
she seems to be finding is there might be

1690
01:26:13.209 --> 01:26:15.040
a case where there's kind of less of this

1691
01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:18.359
felt personal relationship with a God, but you'll find

1692
01:26:18.359 --> 01:26:21.200
strong religious beliefs that just kind of have a

1693
01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.899
distinct flavor to them. So it's not that, you

1694
01:26:23.899 --> 01:26:26.640
know, people are atheists, it's that they express religion

1695
01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:32.080
quite differently, um, and Yeah, so there's the mentalizing

1696
01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.640
factor, the motivational stuff that was kind of our

1697
01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:37.560
second building block, and that one kind of coming

1698
01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.939
from sociology, it looks like where religion flourishes in

1699
01:26:40.939 --> 01:26:43.560
the world is places where life is kind of

1700
01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:48.120
tough and unpredictable and uncertain, whereas if we look

1701
01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.879
at where atheism has taken off, kind of the

1702
01:26:50.879 --> 01:26:54.479
poster child here would be Western Europe post-World Wars,

1703
01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.490
things secularized very rapidly. And that's also a time

1704
01:26:58.490 --> 01:27:01.169
where a lot of these countries had accumulated some

1705
01:27:01.169 --> 01:27:03.810
wealth, put it into developing a good social safety

1706
01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:08.040
net and kind of public education system, and some

1707
01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:11.459
sociologists like Norris and Englehart would call this existential

1708
01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:13.799
security. It's just kind of the. Day to day

1709
01:27:13.799 --> 01:27:17.240
stability and security that citizens experience in a place.

1710
01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:20.729
It turns out as existential security gets higher, religion

1711
01:27:20.729 --> 01:27:23.490
tends to fade away. People just are less motivated

1712
01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:26.850
by first public religious stuff, but then private belief

1713
01:27:26.850 --> 01:27:30.490
fades as kind of life gets comfortable. So there's

1714
01:27:30.490 --> 01:27:33.879
our second pathway to atheism is just existential security.

1715
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:37.470
And then I think the biggest one then is

1716
01:27:37.470 --> 01:27:41.660
looking at cultural learning of beliefs. So we see

1717
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:45.830
people adopting the religious beliefs that are credibly modeled

1718
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:48.229
by members of their community. So if I'm in

1719
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:51.069
a community where I see everybody engaging in potentially

1720
01:27:51.069 --> 01:27:57.669
costly rituals to Shiva or Papagere or Yahweh or

1721
01:27:57.669 --> 01:28:00.390
whatever else, I'm more likely to believe in just

1722
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:03.109
the God that all these displays seem to be

1723
01:28:03.109 --> 01:28:06.870
directed to. Um, NOW if I grow up somewhere

1724
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:11.149
where either those credibility enhancing displays are just across

1725
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:13.200
the board lower where nobody is doing the public

1726
01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:16.720
religious stuff, or potentially in a pluralistic spot where

1727
01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:20.080
my cultural models are all directing their creds at

1728
01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.990
different gods, then basically I'm getting a mixed signal

1729
01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:25.359
and I would be less likely to believe in

1730
01:28:25.359 --> 01:28:28.649
any of them. Um, SO one pathway to atheism

1731
01:28:28.649 --> 01:28:32.240
is just arising through a lack of consistent cultural

1732
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.540
cues supporting one given God. And then our final

1733
01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:39.169
pathway to atheism, I know I trashed it early

1734
01:28:39.169 --> 01:28:41.490
on in the interview talking about the rational atheism

1735
01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:44.529
thesis, but going back to the fact that there

1736
01:28:44.529 --> 01:28:48.319
were these small correlations between rational thinking and atheism

1737
01:28:48.319 --> 01:28:51.970
in some contexts, I think we could salvage a

1738
01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:55.890
little bit of the idea that in some places

1739
01:28:55.890 --> 01:29:00.479
it does seem like rational thinking might. NUDGE people

1740
01:29:00.479 --> 01:29:02.359
to be a bit less religious than they otherwise

1741
01:29:02.359 --> 01:29:05.160
might, but I think when we put all those

1742
01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:08.000
four factors together and kind of ask which ones

1743
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.770
matter the most, the cultural one is consistently the

1744
01:29:11.770 --> 01:29:15.919
best predictor. So growing up around fewer or inconsistent

1745
01:29:15.919 --> 01:29:20.339
credible displays of religious faith predicts atheism in subsequent

1746
01:29:20.339 --> 01:29:23.359
generations. So that one is definitely the most, you

1747
01:29:23.359 --> 01:29:25.399
know, if we're thinking of these as four pathways,

1748
01:29:25.479 --> 01:29:27.759
that's a superhighway, and the other ones are little

1749
01:29:27.759 --> 01:29:29.520
like footpaths through the woods.

1750
01:29:31.009 --> 01:29:34.930
So, taking into account that information and also the

1751
01:29:34.930 --> 01:29:39.009
data you mentioned about the percentage of the world

1752
01:29:39.009 --> 01:29:43.770
population with the atheist, uh, do we, should we

1753
01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:47.939
also say that atheism is natural, like, for example,

1754
01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:52.609
the cognitive scientists of religion say that religion is

1755
01:29:52.609 --> 01:29:53.080
natural.

1756
01:29:54.509 --> 01:29:57.339
Yes, absolutely, and I think it was one of

1757
01:29:57.339 --> 01:30:00.180
the later chapters in my book. I tried to

1758
01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:02.259
reflect on all these different lines of evidence that

1759
01:30:02.259 --> 01:30:05.259
we talked about. And if you read, especially some

1760
01:30:05.259 --> 01:30:07.240
of the public facing books coming out of cognitive

1761
01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:11.479
science and religion, they'd say religion's natural, atheism is

1762
01:30:11.779 --> 01:30:14.339
unnatural, and they don't mean unnatural in that it's

1763
01:30:14.339 --> 01:30:18.180
like evil or wrong or impossible. They're just saying

1764
01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:19.899
all else equal. We seem to be built in

1765
01:30:19.899 --> 01:30:22.540
a way that religion comes easily, whereas atheism takes

1766
01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:25.060
a bit of work. Um, AND I think that

1767
01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:28.259
was an assumption that they stated as a conclusion

1768
01:30:28.939 --> 01:30:31.169
because when we've gone back to check the evidence,

1769
01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:34.899
it doesn't look like it takes effortful rational thinking

1770
01:30:34.899 --> 01:30:37.259
to be atheists, and in fact effortful rational thinking

1771
01:30:37.259 --> 01:30:41.500
is not a particularly good predictor of atheism. If

1772
01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:47.540
they're saying, oh, atheism is difficult and challenging and

1773
01:30:47.899 --> 01:30:53.990
emerges relatively unnaturally, that doesn't seem to explain broad

1774
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:59.620
kind of cross-cultural patterns in atheism. Um, WHERE we

1775
01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:03.100
see lots of atheism is places that first kind

1776
01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.899
of beefed up their existential security and then as

1777
01:31:05.899 --> 01:31:09.899
public religiosity faded, that's the credibility enhancing displays that

1778
01:31:09.899 --> 01:31:12.009
learners needed to see. So we get a generation

1779
01:31:12.009 --> 01:31:14.779
of people who don't see those credibility enhancing displays

1780
01:31:14.779 --> 01:31:16.899
and they just naturally grow up as atheists because

1781
01:31:16.899 --> 01:31:19.700
they've never gotten the consistent cultural input to believe

1782
01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:21.339
in any one God. So I think if you

1783
01:31:21.339 --> 01:31:23.879
put it all together. Um, YOU know, do we

1784
01:31:23.879 --> 01:31:26.589
want to say is religion natural, is atheism natural?

1785
01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.560
I think they're both perfectly natural and it just

1786
01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:31.080
kind of comes down to cultural context. And in

1787
01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:34.040
that view, I think atheism seems far more natural

1788
01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:37.680
under this cultural evolution and form theory than cognitive

1789
01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.640
science of religion would have said 15 years ago

1790
01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:41.140
probably.

1791
01:31:42.169 --> 01:31:44.229
So let me ask you now, what are some

1792
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:47.189
of the most common ideas that people have about

1793
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:51.470
atheists, particularly when it comes to their morality and

1794
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:54.359
their being able to trust them, or that is

1795
01:31:54.359 --> 01:31:58.430
that they are trustworthy people. What do people tend

1796
01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:59.270
to think about them?

1797
01:32:00.490 --> 01:32:03.609
Yeah, looking at people's negative perceptions of atheists is

1798
01:32:03.899 --> 01:32:06.759
it's probably the research project that I've had going

1799
01:32:06.759 --> 01:32:08.560
for the longest in various ways. It goes back

1800
01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:12.000
to like my master's thesis where In 2006 or

1801
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.919
so, I remember looking at some surveys out there

1802
01:32:14.919 --> 01:32:17.919
where they were looking at kind of general cultural

1803
01:32:17.919 --> 01:32:20.270
inclusion and exclusion and the general way this is

1804
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:22.240
framed in the US, as they say, would you

1805
01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:24.279
vote for a well qualified member of your own

1806
01:32:24.279 --> 01:32:28.319
political party if they happen to be black or

1807
01:32:28.319 --> 01:32:30.080
a woman or a Jewish, or you could plug

1808
01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.640
in whatever group you want and then you just

1809
01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.959
look at people's kind of stated voting intention and

1810
01:32:34.959 --> 01:32:37.720
use that as a proxy for cultural inclusion. And

1811
01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:40.200
in those polls in 2006, I remember seeing some

1812
01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.399
where people were broadly supportive of candidates from a

1813
01:32:43.399 --> 01:32:46.319
wide range of backgrounds, and atheists was like the

1814
01:32:46.319 --> 01:32:49.549
one group that couldn't crack the 50% barrier. And

1815
01:32:49.549 --> 01:32:51.509
I remember thinking that's a really weird group to

1816
01:32:51.509 --> 01:32:55.069
have strong feelings about, because especially like US in

1817
01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:58.109
the early 2000s, there wasn't much of a collective

1818
01:32:58.109 --> 01:33:01.229
identity for atheists. This wasn't a group of people

1819
01:33:01.229 --> 01:33:04.500
that you could readily identify out in the world.

1820
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:05.990
If you even think of it as a group

1821
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:07.750
of us, a bunch of people who don't believe

1822
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:09.750
in God, they didn't do a lot of groupish

1823
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.950
stuff. So it seemed like an odd one for

1824
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:15.509
people to have strong feelings about. Um, AND the

1825
01:33:15.509 --> 01:33:18.580
research over the years we've kind of Hit on

1826
01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:21.819
the working model that what's driving negative perceptions of

1827
01:33:21.819 --> 01:33:26.379
atheists is a deep-seated kind of moral distrust. People

1828
01:33:26.379 --> 01:33:29.810
are assuming that religion is where morality comes from,

1829
01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:32.779
and since atheists don't have religious beliefs, how do

1830
01:33:32.779 --> 01:33:35.620
we know that they're moral? Um, AND, and we

1831
01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:37.729
found this in different ways over the years where

1832
01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:41.609
we could describe people engaging in different moral violations

1833
01:33:41.899 --> 01:33:46.129
and then just kind of Uh, subtly look to

1834
01:33:46.129 --> 01:33:49.129
see what our, our participants' intuitions are about who's

1835
01:33:49.129 --> 01:33:53.009
doing this stuff. So we could describe somebody, um,

1836
01:33:53.589 --> 01:33:57.180
Who's, you know, violent. They're hurting animals for fun,

1837
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:59.910
or we could describe somebody who's, you know, a

1838
01:33:59.910 --> 01:34:03.350
sexual deviant. They engage in consensual incest with their

1839
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:06.709
sister or we could describe any of them, we've

1840
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:09.620
tried a long list of pretty grisly moral violations

1841
01:34:10.029 --> 01:34:11.629
and across all of them, people assume that the

1842
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:14.589
perpetrator doesn't believe in God. So people really seem

1843
01:34:14.589 --> 01:34:17.879
to think that. Uh, THE people out there doing

1844
01:34:17.879 --> 01:34:20.490
immoral stuff must not believe in God, because if

1845
01:34:20.490 --> 01:34:22.129
they did believe in God, they wouldn't do that

1846
01:34:22.129 --> 01:34:24.569
stuff. Um, THAT'S the just

1847
01:34:24.569 --> 01:34:27.970
to, just to clarify, when you mentioned people, are

1848
01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:31.850
you referring to simply religious people or is it

1849
01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:36.209
that atheists themselves also think that about other atheists?

1850
01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.750
Yeah, that's a super important clarification point. So we've

1851
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:42.669
run these surveys in a bunch of different ways,

1852
01:34:42.689 --> 01:34:46.629
and what's interesting is you find much larger effects

1853
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:48.870
among religious participants where they're the ones who are

1854
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:51.810
really saying like, Yeah, this guy who is a

1855
01:34:51.810 --> 01:34:55.560
serial killer, definitely an atheist, but even our atheist

1856
01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.439
participants, if we have kind of subtle indirect measures

1857
01:34:58.439 --> 01:35:02.040
of attitudes, they're showing the same pattern. So we

1858
01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.359
had one of them where we had a study

1859
01:35:04.359 --> 01:35:07.200
that we ran in 13 countries, including some highly

1860
01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:11.390
secular countries, and we were also able to look

1861
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:15.120
at individual level participant beliefs. So some some of

1862
01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:18.700
our participants were atheists. And we found that even

1863
01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:22.430
atheists in highly secular countries intuitively assume that serial

1864
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:25.640
killers have to be atheists, and we have some

1865
01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.700
other tasks too where we're just kind of looking

1866
01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:30.450
intuitively do people seem to think it would be

1867
01:35:30.859 --> 01:35:33.220
better or worse if there were more atheists in

1868
01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:35.819
the world? And we're finding that even atheists at

1869
01:35:35.819 --> 01:35:38.500
a gut level are saying, well, It wouldn't be

1870
01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:41.379
great to have more atheists, and we're getting that

1871
01:35:41.379 --> 01:35:44.979
response pattern from like atheists in Sweden, where most

1872
01:35:44.979 --> 01:35:46.919
people are atheists, and they're saying, well, a lot

1873
01:35:46.919 --> 01:35:48.299
of us are atheists, but I don't know if

1874
01:35:48.299 --> 01:35:52.180
we need more of us. So but I should

1875
01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:54.939
definitely note that the effects among atheist participants are

1876
01:35:54.939 --> 01:35:58.259
a lot smaller, but we're not seeing a reversal.

1877
01:35:58.339 --> 01:36:00.660
We're not seeing atheist participants saying, Well, the serial

1878
01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:02.779
killer must be religious because he's different from me.

1879
01:36:02.939 --> 01:36:04.740
They're saying, Well, the serial killer might be atheist

1880
01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:04.979
too.

1881
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:09.810
And so those are the thoughts people all about

1882
01:36:09.810 --> 01:36:13.569
atheists, but what does the research say about them?

1883
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:17.609
I mean, can we trust them? Are are atheists

1884
01:36:17.609 --> 01:36:23.350
really more predisposed toward immorality or amorality? What do

1885
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:24.129
we know about that?

1886
01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:28.529
Yeah, that's a fantastic question. I've seen one that

1887
01:36:28.529 --> 01:36:31.129
came up in my doctoral dissertation defense where I

1888
01:36:31.129 --> 01:36:33.609
was presenting some of these results on people distrusting

1889
01:36:33.609 --> 01:36:35.450
atheists, and one committee member said, Well, isn't it

1890
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:39.339
perfectly rational to not trust atheists? AND to unpack

1891
01:36:39.339 --> 01:36:41.169
it, he said, Well, we all have a lot

1892
01:36:41.169 --> 01:36:44.100
of reasons why we don't do bad things. So

1893
01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:46.140
maybe you're in a store and you don't shoplift

1894
01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:47.870
because there's a security camera and you don't want

1895
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:50.180
to get caught. Maybe you don't want the police

1896
01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:52.379
to get you. Maybe you'll feel guilty because you're

1897
01:36:52.379 --> 01:36:54.649
thinking about your poor grandma who told you not

1898
01:36:54.649 --> 01:36:57.060
to steal. So we all have those reasons. And

1899
01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:59.339
then religious people have one more that God told

1900
01:36:59.339 --> 01:37:01.660
you not to do this. So isn't it perfectly

1901
01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:04.580
rational to trust the person who has 4 reasons

1902
01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:06.580
not to shoplift instead of the person who only

1903
01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:10.759
has 3. Um, SO that Kind of the logic,

1904
01:37:10.770 --> 01:37:12.640
and I think it does make a fair bit

1905
01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:15.080
of sense, but we can actually go check the

1906
01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:18.410
data out in the world in various ways to

1907
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:21.120
say, well, does the world look like we'd expect

1908
01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:24.399
if atheists actually were as untrustworthy as they're perceived

1909
01:37:24.399 --> 01:37:27.000
to be? And there's different ways we could look

1910
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.759
at that. So we could just say, well, at

1911
01:37:28.759 --> 01:37:31.040
a country by country level, are places with more

1912
01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:35.040
atheists scarier than places without. Turns out the opposite's

1913
01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:37.040
true in a lot of ways. Now, the era

1914
01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:40.279
of causation is going from atheism to stable societies.

1915
01:37:40.319 --> 01:37:42.120
It's probably running the other way as we were

1916
01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:45.370
just talking about, um. But yeah, if it if

1917
01:37:45.370 --> 01:37:47.799
it really turned out that serial killers were all

1918
01:37:47.799 --> 01:37:49.729
atheists, we'd expect that the atheist countries would have

1919
01:37:49.729 --> 01:37:51.770
more serial killers. It doesn't seem to be the

1920
01:37:51.770 --> 01:37:55.770
case. Or we could actually look kind of more

1921
01:37:55.770 --> 01:37:58.910
fine grained at the individual level, and there's a

1922
01:37:58.910 --> 01:38:03.410
great paper called Everyday Morality by Wilhel Hoffman and

1923
01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:08.370
colleagues, and so they did something called EMA, what

1924
01:38:08.370 --> 01:38:10.839
does that stand for, something momentary assessment. Basically people

1925
01:38:10.839 --> 01:38:12.529
had a smartphone app that would ping them a

1926
01:38:12.529 --> 01:38:15.089
few times throughout the day at random intervals. And

1927
01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:16.410
just kind of ask them what they were up

1928
01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:19.209
to, and they were specifically interested in kind of

1929
01:38:19.209 --> 01:38:22.410
morally relevant stuff. So have you done anything morally

1930
01:38:22.410 --> 01:38:25.129
good or morally bad? Have you seen anything morally

1931
01:38:25.129 --> 01:38:29.649
good? Um, AND they did this study with, I

1932
01:38:29.649 --> 01:38:31.759
think it was like 1300 people around the US,

1933
01:38:31.770 --> 01:38:33.609
followed them for a period of time just to

1934
01:38:33.609 --> 01:38:35.609
try to get these random snapshots throughout the day

1935
01:38:35.609 --> 01:38:38.729
of like what are people's moment to moment moral

1936
01:38:38.729 --> 01:38:43.359
lives like. And they also had some demographic stuff

1937
01:38:43.359 --> 01:38:44.790
that they asked people and they could say, well,

1938
01:38:44.810 --> 01:38:46.169
let's look at the people who are not at

1939
01:38:46.169 --> 01:38:49.810
all religious and compare them to religious people. Do

1940
01:38:49.810 --> 01:38:52.689
we find, for instance, that religious people are more

1941
01:38:52.689 --> 01:38:55.850
likely to engage in kind of pro-social positive moral

1942
01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:58.250
stuff? Is it the case that it's the, the

1943
01:38:58.250 --> 01:39:01.759
non-religious people who are engaging in immoral things? Um,

1944
01:39:01.970 --> 01:39:04.609
AND when they crunch all the numbers, you'll find

1945
01:39:04.609 --> 01:39:07.774
some kind of like interest. NUANCED differences in how

1946
01:39:07.774 --> 01:39:10.734
people are approaching it, but the overall baseline rates

1947
01:39:10.734 --> 01:39:14.495
of committing immoral stuff or committing moral stuff, no

1948
01:39:14.495 --> 01:39:19.214
difference whatsoever across the religious spectrum. Everybody in their

1949
01:39:19.214 --> 01:39:21.854
lives is kind of about the same level of

1950
01:39:21.854 --> 01:39:24.729
morality. And that dovetails with a lot of other

1951
01:39:24.729 --> 01:39:27.709
results now. You can look at results on, you

1952
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:30.669
know, are kids raised religious, more generous than kids

1953
01:39:30.669 --> 01:39:33.629
who are raised not religious? Turns out there's no

1954
01:39:33.629 --> 01:39:35.669
difference whatsoever if you do the stats right on

1955
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:38.060
that. So I had a whole chapter in the

1956
01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:39.620
book where I was kind of saying, here's all

1957
01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:41.859
the ways you could look at this, and time

1958
01:39:41.859 --> 01:39:43.500
and time again it looks like there's not much

1959
01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.339
of a difference, or sometimes you'll see like a

1960
01:39:46.339 --> 01:39:49.220
moral difference, not an overall amount of morality, but

1961
01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:53.049
you'll find kind of subtle differences in like nuanced

1962
01:39:53.049 --> 01:39:57.700
how people are thinking about morality, um which totally

1963
01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:00.680
makes sense, but in terms of Do we have

1964
01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:03.569
evidence that atheists are any less morally trustworthy than

1965
01:40:03.569 --> 01:40:07.089
anybody else? No. And, and by now we actually

1966
01:40:07.089 --> 01:40:09.089
enough people have looked, so it's not just the

1967
01:40:09.089 --> 01:40:11.089
case that we don't have that evidence because nobody's

1968
01:40:11.089 --> 01:40:13.689
tried to find it. It's that everywhere we have

1969
01:40:13.689 --> 01:40:16.729
this good kind of atheist religious contrast, we're not

1970
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:18.879
seeing a big difference today.

1971
01:40:19.799 --> 01:40:22.879
So even in terms of generosity, there's not a

1972
01:40:22.879 --> 01:40:24.959
big difference, right? I mean, I'm asking you because

1973
01:40:24.959 --> 01:40:28.600
I've heard many times on the news people covering

1974
01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:33.640
studies which supposedly demonstrate that religious people tend to

1975
01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:35.680
be more generous than atheists.

1976
01:40:36.759 --> 01:40:40.470
Um, ON that kind of charitable giving, actually in

1977
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:42.390
the book I thought about doing a deep dive

1978
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:43.859
on some of that work because yeah, you're right,

1979
01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:46.930
it pops up a bunch. The general pattern by

1980
01:40:46.930 --> 01:40:50.729
my reading is religious people, for instance, give more

1981
01:40:50.729 --> 01:40:54.799
money to charity and do more volunteerism. But they,

1982
01:40:54.959 --> 01:40:59.620
they tend to give money to their religious charity

1983
01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:03.220
or they volunteer their time with their church, so

1984
01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:05.270
it gets a lot more complicated once you kind

1985
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:07.990
of tease apart where is this money going, which

1986
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:10.390
are the causes given, and if you run it

1987
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:12.720
through a filter of are they helping in-group. Uh,

1988
01:41:13.209 --> 01:41:16.089
ARE they, are they doing stuff for their religious

1989
01:41:16.089 --> 01:41:19.609
group? Um, THINGS balance out a lot more once

1990
01:41:19.609 --> 01:41:21.689
you factor that in that a lot of this

1991
01:41:21.689 --> 01:41:28.009
kind of religious generosity and volunteerism advantage is explained

1992
01:41:28.009 --> 01:41:30.399
by them doing more stuff for their own communities,

1993
01:41:30.529 --> 01:41:30.850
um.

1994
01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:35.060
OK. So, I have 2 more questions I want

1995
01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:37.259
to ask you. The first one is, what do

1996
01:41:37.259 --> 01:41:40.470
we know about the future of religion and atheism?

1997
01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:43.009
Are we seeing any specific trends?

1998
01:41:44.399 --> 01:41:46.910
Yeah, this is a fun one because you can

1999
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:49.180
go back and see big time thinkers in this

2000
01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:52.910
field going back for 100 years and generally these

2001
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:56.029
like enlightenment thinkers are saying, guys, religion's on its

2002
01:41:56.029 --> 01:41:59.390
last legs. We've seen religion's going to fade away

2003
01:41:59.390 --> 01:42:03.109
within our lifetime, and you can, you can find

2004
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:05.339
quotes going back 100 years where people keep saying

2005
01:42:05.339 --> 01:42:07.109
religion's on the way out, religion's on the way

2006
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:09.709
out. And hey, guess what, religion is still here.

2007
01:42:10.009 --> 01:42:12.759
Uh, NONE of those predictions held up. Um, AND

2008
01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:15.319
I think in part they got their predictions wrong

2009
01:42:15.319 --> 01:42:18.080
because they had an incorrect model for how religion

2010
01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:20.750
and atheism work. So they're assuming that once we

2011
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:23.399
have, you know, industrial revolution and the onward march

2012
01:42:23.399 --> 01:42:26.470
of scientific. Progress and just kind of general modernity

2013
01:42:26.759 --> 01:42:29.279
that religion would look foolish and childish and people

2014
01:42:29.279 --> 01:42:32.120
would turn away from it in favor of all

2015
01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:36.279
of our new cool technological gizmos. But as we

2016
01:42:36.279 --> 01:42:38.839
were just talking about the pathways to atheism, that

2017
01:42:38.839 --> 01:42:42.720
wasn't particularly one of them. So they were predicting

2018
01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:44.839
the future of atheism based on an incorrect model

2019
01:42:44.839 --> 01:42:47.120
of how people become atheists, but I think we

2020
01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.080
can come up with a good prediction about the

2021
01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.959
future of atheism if we realize if we just

2022
01:42:50.959 --> 01:42:53.439
kind of look at where we've seen secularization in

2023
01:42:53.439 --> 01:42:55.759
the world. Again, it's these places where they they

2024
01:42:55.759 --> 01:42:59.830
beef up existential security and then over subsequent generations,

2025
01:42:59.910 --> 01:43:03.450
the cultural learning of faith. Dip. So if we

2026
01:43:03.450 --> 01:43:05.850
want to predict the future of religion, we kind

2027
01:43:05.850 --> 01:43:08.890
of need to predict the future of kind of

2028
01:43:08.890 --> 01:43:13.189
social stability, um, which is tricky because, I mean,

2029
01:43:13.330 --> 01:43:16.490
in part because I'm trained as a cultural psychologist

2030
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:20.729
and not a future demographer of world geopolitics or

2031
01:43:20.729 --> 01:43:23.299
whatever that would be. Um, SO the guess I,

2032
01:43:23.459 --> 01:43:26.729
I put in the book is, um, One thing

2033
01:43:26.729 --> 01:43:28.890
that I've not seen in a lot of people's

2034
01:43:28.890 --> 01:43:30.569
predictions about the future of atheism, so I was

2035
01:43:30.569 --> 01:43:32.490
just at a little meeting where people were talking

2036
01:43:32.490 --> 01:43:34.890
about, oh, are we going to see the onward

2037
01:43:34.890 --> 01:43:37.049
march of secularization like we've seen in Europe where

2038
01:43:37.049 --> 01:43:39.609
countries are getting less and less religious with technological

2039
01:43:39.609 --> 01:43:42.729
and economic progress and all the panelists were kind

2040
01:43:42.729 --> 01:43:45.209
of hesitantly predicting, yes, we're going to continue to

2041
01:43:45.209 --> 01:43:48.520
see this because, you know, technology, medicine, all this,

2042
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:53.660
and what struck me there is If we're thinking

2043
01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:57.540
about predicting religion by predicting social stability, I think

2044
01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:00.259
the elephant in the room for predicting the future

2045
01:44:00.259 --> 01:44:04.779
of religion is adaptation to climate change. So I

2046
01:44:04.779 --> 01:44:09.540
think our, our world is changing in big and

2047
01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:15.060
drastic ways, and I think Yeah, I think we're

2048
01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:16.700
going to see a lot of instability in the

2049
01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:18.700
next 100 years, and those are the conditions where

2050
01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:21.819
religion does really well. Now I think we're going

2051
01:44:21.819 --> 01:44:25.580
to see some already wealthy countries are going to

2052
01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:30.060
kind of condense, keep what's theirs, so we see

2053
01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:31.580
like the rise of a lot of kind of

2054
01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:34.410
right wing governments that are mostly built on keep

2055
01:44:34.410 --> 01:44:37.259
immigrants out mentality. So I think that's kind of

2056
01:44:37.259 --> 01:44:40.939
a A foreshadowing of where we're going to see

2057
01:44:40.939 --> 01:44:44.060
a lot of countries go as the increasingly large

2058
01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:45.779
parts of the world become unlivable and we have

2059
01:44:45.779 --> 01:44:47.919
a lot of migration and a lot of chaos,

2060
01:44:47.939 --> 01:44:51.180
we'll see some affluent countries just try to preserve

2061
01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:54.540
stability that they've got and I think in those

2062
01:44:54.734 --> 01:44:57.904
Stable secular enclaves will continue to see your religion

2063
01:44:57.904 --> 01:45:00.814
diminish, but I think globally I think we're going

2064
01:45:00.814 --> 01:45:03.935
to have far things are going to be far

2065
01:45:03.935 --> 01:45:06.975
too tumultuous to see any sort of gradual phasing

2066
01:45:06.975 --> 01:45:10.924
out of religion unless we kind of radically alter

2067
01:45:11.174 --> 01:45:14.375
our approach to climate and looking after each other

2068
01:45:14.375 --> 01:45:16.865
basically. So I think religion will do just fine

2069
01:45:17.134 --> 01:45:19.375
in part because we've created global conditions where we're

2070
01:45:19.375 --> 01:45:20.654
going to see a lot of insecurity.

2071
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:25.149
But when it comes to religions themselves, I've seen

2072
01:45:25.149 --> 01:45:30.609
data that say that uh after 2050, something like

2073
01:45:30.609 --> 01:45:35.149
that, Islam will be the number one religion in

2074
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:36.660
the world. Is that correct?

2075
01:45:37.689 --> 01:45:41.640
Um, I mean, I think some of those projection

2076
01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:46.160
projections make sense in terms of kind of what

2077
01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:48.759
they've built into the model, but they're all somewhat

2078
01:45:48.759 --> 01:45:53.520
assuming the kind of broad living conditions over the

2079
01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:55.279
next 50 years are going to look like the

2080
01:45:55.279 --> 01:45:58.279
last 50 years, and I think with climate insecurity

2081
01:45:58.279 --> 01:46:02.459
things things are going to change, um, so. Yeah,

2082
01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:04.779
I, I'm hesitant to go with any model that

2083
01:46:04.779 --> 01:46:07.490
doesn't have something explicitly built in on, you know,

2084
01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:10.220
billions of people needing to find new homes.

2085
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:13.950
Right. So my last question then, do you think

2086
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:16.479
it would ever be possible for us to have

2087
01:46:16.479 --> 01:46:20.109
a society composed of just atheists?

2088
01:46:21.810 --> 01:46:23.540
Yeah, I think we could have that. I think

2089
01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:29.109
if um If we kind of get through this

2090
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:31.700
little climate hiccup that we're just starting to enter

2091
01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:35.430
and can kind of radically reshape our societies to

2092
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:39.149
kind of build in caring about equity and caring

2093
01:46:39.149 --> 01:46:41.830
about just general well-being of most people, I think

2094
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:46.790
we can create conditions and cultural conditions where atheism

2095
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:49.439
is going to come very easily for people. Um,

2096
01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:52.750
WHETHER we make the societal choices that create cultures

2097
01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:55.790
where that can happen. There I'm less optimistic, but

2098
01:46:55.790 --> 01:46:58.370
I, yeah, I think absolutely the potential is there

2099
01:46:58.370 --> 01:47:01.569
since it's such kind of a a religious belief

2100
01:47:01.569 --> 01:47:04.720
and disbelief are so culturally subscribed that I think,

2101
01:47:04.729 --> 01:47:06.890
yeah, we just, we need to create cultures where

2102
01:47:06.890 --> 01:47:07.529
it can happen.

2103
01:47:08.919 --> 01:47:11.390
Great. So the book is again this belief, The

2104
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:14.589
Origins of Atheism in the Religious Species. I'm leaving

2105
01:47:14.589 --> 01:47:16.290
a link to it in the, there it is.

2106
01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:18.109
I'm leaving a link to it in the description

2107
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:21.149
of the interview. And Doctor Gervais, just before we

2108
01:47:21.149 --> 01:47:24.109
go, apart from the book, where can people find

2109
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:25.750
your work on the internet?

2110
01:47:26.569 --> 01:47:28.750
Um, THEY can find me. I need to update

2111
01:47:28.750 --> 01:47:30.669
my website, but if you just look for Willdrive.com,

2112
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:33.000
I'll have some of my research stuff up there.

2113
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:36.910
Um, I try to, if I ever publish a

2114
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:38.870
paper and it's like stuck behind a paywall, I

2115
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:40.669
try to find a way to put a free

2116
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:43.149
version up on my website. So track me down

2117
01:47:43.149 --> 01:47:46.669
there. You can find me. I'm off Twitter these

2118
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:49.149
days, but I'm on BlueSky. If you look for

2119
01:47:49.149 --> 01:47:53.160
Wgervais, I'm on there. That's about it, I guess.

2120
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:55.180
I keep a low profile outside of that.

2121
01:47:56.180 --> 01:47:58.660
Great. So thank you so much for doing this.

2122
01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:01.859
It's been a very informative and fun conversation, so

2123
01:48:01.859 --> 01:48:02.850
thank you so much.

2124
01:48:03.339 --> 01:48:05.890
