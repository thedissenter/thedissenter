00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.910
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.860
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricard Lobs. And

3
00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:08.710
today I'm joined by Doctor Lance Grande. He's a

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.819
distinguished service curator Emeritus at the Field Museum. And

5
00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.630
today we're talking, we're talking about his book, The

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.000
Evolution of Religions, The History of related traditions. So,

7
00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.200
Doctor Grande, welcome to the show. It's a big

8
00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:27.229
pleasure to everyone. Oh, thank you to. So we're

9
00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.989
going to talk about the evolution of religions and

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.900
how they relate to one another. So just to,

11
00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:36.830
before we get into religion itself, let me just

12
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.909
ask you a little bit about some of the

13
00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:43.080
methodology that you apply in this kind of work

14
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.669
and in your book specifically. So, could you start

15
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.400
by telling us about evolutionary systematics? What is that

16
00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:51.430
exactly?

17
00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:55.619
Well, i it's modern context, it's a classification of

18
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.919
groups of things based on historical relationships and uh

19
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.630
shared characteristics. Um We basically look at, you know,

20
00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.400
characteristics that we think are uh uniquely uh derived

21
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.379
for groups and that's how we build these trees

22
00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:15.160
that tell us something about the history of things.

23
00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:18.529
And what would you say that we gain from

24
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.779
approaching religion or religions from an evolutionary perspective? What

25
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.199
kinds of insights do we get from that?

26
00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:31.970
Well, it gives us a broader understanding of diversity

27
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.040
with uh this historical uh perspective of uh connections

28
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.239
and shared uh foundations. And I think that's something

29
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.949
that uh I is useful in any deep studies

30
00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:45.949
of history.

31
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.480
And in, again, understanding a little bit how you

32
00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:53.550
approach things in your book at a certain point,

33
00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:56.660
you say that you examine the evolutionary history of

34
00:01:56.669 --> 00:02:01.349
major groups of religions in an agnostic context. So

35
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.779
what is that agnostic context? What does that mean

36
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.489
in this case?

37
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.559
Uh Diagnostic, I simply mean, as a historian, uh

38
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.759
such an approach is necessary for an unbiased comparison

39
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.320
among so many thousands of different uh things out

40
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.520
there. Um um RELIGIOUS ideologies in this case.

41
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.419
Uh So I, I mean, do you think that

42
00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:29.419
perhaps approaching it from either a religious or an

43
00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:33.270
atheist perspective would bias the approach here?

44
00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.490
Yes, because then you're going into it thinking you

45
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.660
already know the answer and if you go into

46
00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:44.220
something already knowing the answer, it becomes less scientific

47
00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:45.020
in its core.

48
00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:51.470
And of course, we're talking about religion, most people

49
00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.309
perhaps think that they know more or less what

50
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.330
religion is about. But what actually is religion? What

51
00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:01.899
is religion? What, what counts as a religion?

52
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.529
Yeah. It's a tricky concept because um it's defined

53
00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.580
so differently by so many different people. I mean,

54
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.789
that's one way that social sciences differ from the

55
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.050
biological sciences and that in the biological sciences, there

56
00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:22.199
are rules for naming groups and, and understanding what

57
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.389
a group means. Um Those things don't exist in

58
00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:29.940
the social sciences so much. So people use names

59
00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.880
and they mean all kinds of different things. Um

60
00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:39.119
ESPECIALLY with something like religion. Um So the most

61
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.070
critical thing for me was to clearly define how

62
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.839
I was using it because that's the only way

63
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.279
that uh then it can make any long term

64
00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.759
sense to, to other people studying the same subject.

65
00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:55.949
So I usually, um I try to remain as

66
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.089
unbiased as possible. So I, I define a religion

67
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.589
in its most broad sense as a supernatural belief

68
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.869
system. Um And then within that, I identify a

69
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.270
subgroup called organized religion, um which I identify as

70
00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:21.779
a formally codified and institutionalized religions. Um THAT I

71
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.220
start, I go from there and then start to

72
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.339
look for the subgroups of these things.

73
00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:29.850
Mhm. But uh of course, I think we're going

74
00:04:29.859 --> 00:04:34.000
to get back into the topic of organized religion.

75
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.000
But since you mentioned it now, and you say

76
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.350
that it's basically about institutionalized religion. I mean, what

77
00:04:42.359 --> 00:04:46.549
does institutionalized religion mean? I mean, where at, at

78
00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:49.660
what point do you say that the religion in

79
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.239
a particular society is institutionalized?

80
00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:57.290
Well, these are generally belief systems that have laws

81
00:04:57.299 --> 00:05:01.989
and traditions and uh specific organizational structures and revered

82
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.019
figures and enough of, and a number of other

83
00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:06.869
things that, that we can compare and look for

84
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.399
similarities and differences and in the way we classify

85
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.929
the thousands of different belief systems out there.

86
00:05:14.359 --> 00:05:17.630
And is there any particular reason? I mean, was

87
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.799
it just out of your own personal interest or

88
00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:24.850
is there any other particular scientific reason, let's say

89
00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:28.670
for you to have picked religion? Because I imagine

90
00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:31.475
that you could have done the same with any

91
00:05:31.484 --> 00:05:37.105
other cultural phenomena or cultural phenomenon in human society.

92
00:05:37.114 --> 00:05:41.195
Do, do you think that religion plays a particularly

93
00:05:41.204 --> 00:05:44.885
important role in human societies or not?

94
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.829
I do. And I picked it also because um

95
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.230
there's kind of AAA revolution in the social sciences

96
00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:58.320
today. Um There's a long history of um evolutionism

97
00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:01.519
and even broad comparative is in the social sciences.

98
00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.739
Um uh Shortly after Darwin published the origin of

99
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.980
species, some social scientists were drawn to it to

100
00:06:10.989 --> 00:06:15.339
um look at culture. But early on in the

101
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.140
late 19th and early 20th century, uh many of

102
00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:22.190
these uh workers were looking at evolution as a

103
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.600
ladder of progress or uh is some innate qualitative

104
00:06:27.609 --> 00:06:31.239
thing. And that led to all kinds of bad

105
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.660
consequences, you know, ranging from eugenics to worse. And

106
00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:40.480
uh as a result of that, um social science

107
00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:45.140
has largely rejected not only evolutionism eventually, but even

108
00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:49.320
broad comparative. And um but in the meantime, the

109
00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:53.170
biological sciences completely changed the way they looked at

110
00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:57.589
evolutionary studies. Um And uh rather than looking at

111
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.269
evolution as some sort of ladder of progress which

112
00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:04.079
they no longer do. Um They started looking at

113
00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:08.720
uh evolution as simply diversification over time in a

114
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:14.190
non qualitative way. So, um so that way of

115
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.059
looking at evolution has been slow to re-enter some

116
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.119
of the social sciences, uh linguists have embraced it.

117
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.170
And so there are a lot of uh linguists

118
00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:33.369
who now use P phylogenetic evolutionary techniques, but it's

119
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.859
been very slow to penetrate other areas like history

120
00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:39.730
of religion studies. So, I mean, I've always liked

121
00:07:39.739 --> 00:07:43.109
to challenge. So I picked um history of religion

122
00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:46.149
studies and uh and this is where I landed.

123
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.109
Mhm But do you think that nowadays, particularly in

124
00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:54.750
the humanities and when you try to approach religion

125
00:07:54.929 --> 00:07:58.470
through a perspective coming from the humanities that there's

126
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.299
more acceptance of using or applying evolutionary theory or

127
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:03.670
not,

128
00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:08.429
that remains to be seen uh uh a again

129
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:14.739
in um many um aspects of the social sciences

130
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.950
like history, religion studies. There is still resistance not

131
00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:22.980
only to any kind of evolutionary approach, but even

132
00:08:22.989 --> 00:08:26.399
broad comparative is, I mean, there's a, a uh

133
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:31.420
school uh of uh the social sciences sometimes called

134
00:08:31.429 --> 00:08:35.380
particulars which basically says stay in your own lane

135
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.299
and don't uh don't go outside of that. But

136
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.469
as somebody interested in, in the broadest and deepest

137
00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:46.570
history, I'm drawn to things that are much broader

138
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.059
in their look at um uh diversity. And um

139
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.960
that, so that's part of what drew me in

140
00:08:53.969 --> 00:08:56.619
here and um it's been interesting to see the

141
00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.080
reaction to it uh both positive and negative

142
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.570
and why do you think that religions are so

143
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.719
common across human societies? And since we're also talking

144
00:09:08.729 --> 00:09:11.640
here from an evolutionary perspective, do you think that

145
00:09:11.969 --> 00:09:17.090
we have evolved to being predisposed to religiosity in

146
00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:20.530
any way that it is something innate in human

147
00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:24.239
beings? Or is it, for example, a by-product of

148
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.869
other adapt of other psychological adaptations we might have

149
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.380
evolved? I mean, do you have any uh any

150
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:34.820
particular position when it comes to that kind of

151
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.900
question, if religion is something that we are predisposed

152
00:09:38.909 --> 00:09:41.299
to in naturally predisposed to and if it's the

153
00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:43.580
result of natural selection,

154
00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:47.679
well, there are many ideas about that um as

155
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:52.190
you might guess, um they, they range from, um

156
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.630
just say uh some sort of ambiguous uh um

157
00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:06.030
um noting of these, the, the uh broad diversity

158
00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:09.760
of religion to uh some scientists even claiming there's

159
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.869
a genetic component to it, which of course is

160
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.840
hotly debated. Um It is, it does seem to

161
00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:20.469
be ingrained. I mean, according to a 2010 study

162
00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:23.780
by the Pew Research Center, only about 2% of

163
00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:28.150
people are uh strict atheists and another 10% are

164
00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:32.359
agnostics, um the rest appear to follow one particular

165
00:10:32.369 --> 00:10:35.359
branch of religion or another today. But that's,

166
00:10:36.729 --> 00:10:40.059
let me just ask you those 2% that are

167
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:45.780
strictly at the atheists uh is what does that

168
00:10:45.789 --> 00:10:49.179
2% correspond to, are we talking about the entire

169
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:54.039
global population or everyone that ever existed? What are

170
00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:55.539
we referring to there?

171
00:10:55.549 --> 00:10:58.739
We're referring to a, a single study by the

172
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:04.130
Pew Research Center uh uh in 2010 uh on

173
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.020
the population of the uh early 21st century on

174
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.059
the planet. So that it's a specific point in

175
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.090
time and of course, they weren't able to survey

176
00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:20.299
uh 7.5 billion people. Uh But it's a representative

177
00:11:20.309 --> 00:11:23.119
sample that it was a quite, quite a large

178
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.299
sample involving um countries acro across the globe.

179
00:11:27.969 --> 00:11:31.549
Yes, because I was wondering if uh today in

180
00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:36.070
the 20 twenties, it would still be only 2%

181
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.270
of people who identify as atheists in the world.

182
00:11:40.289 --> 00:11:42.669
You know, nobody knows. I mean, the, the pew

183
00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:45.010
uh uh survey was the last one of its

184
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.510
size. So, I it's, I'm sure they will do

185
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.570
and try and repeat that at some point in

186
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.419
time, but it was an enormous project. So, so,

187
00:11:54.429 --> 00:11:58.260
um but, you know, 2010 is fairly um recent.

188
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.849
So, uh um it's good to um at least

189
00:12:01.859 --> 00:12:03.849
have something that you can look at.

190
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.270
Do we have any idea if there ever was

191
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:15.109
any human society which lack religion altogether where no

192
00:12:15.119 --> 00:12:18.570
religion, which didn't have any sort of religion at

193
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:18.909
all?

194
00:12:19.929 --> 00:12:22.349
Well, again, that depends on how you define religion

195
00:12:22.359 --> 00:12:24.880
and, and in the most general way that I

196
00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:29.739
define it uh, supernatural belief systems. Um, ALTHOUGH there's

197
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.739
no way of proving it, I suspect that it

198
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:36.549
went back, uh, close to the, uh, uh, it,

199
00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:42.250
it, it went back probably at least, uh, 100,000

200
00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.200
years or more because, I mean, the early, um,

201
00:12:46.229 --> 00:12:49.880
forms of supernaturalism would have been more animistic, uh,

202
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:55.099
maybe in terms of, uh, um, um, being awed

203
00:12:55.109 --> 00:13:00.109
by the natural, um, phenomena, um, you know, the

204
00:13:00.119 --> 00:13:03.750
wind, the, the storms, the sun and the moon.

205
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:09.690
Um But also by um say, um the value

206
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.849
of uh maternal uh things that, you know, I

207
00:13:14.859 --> 00:13:18.669
mean, basically early clans, they were dependent on um

208
00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:22.320
mothers producing Children or they disappeared. And, and so

209
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.320
there, there are probably some reverence attached to that

210
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.770
and, um that is sometimes thought to be demonstrated

211
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.229
by the, the abundance of these Venus figurines that

212
00:13:32.239 --> 00:13:35.609
we find in, in the, the archaeological record going

213
00:13:35.619 --> 00:13:39.840
back 40,000 years or so. Um But, you know,

214
00:13:39.849 --> 00:13:42.039
like all things that go back so far in

215
00:13:42.049 --> 00:13:45.669
history, we can only speculate uh about the uh

216
00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:49.590
most distant reaches of uh human culture.

217
00:13:50.869 --> 00:13:53.690
And since we're also going to talk here today

218
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.489
about uh how some of the, at least the

219
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.630
main or biggest religions relate to one another. Do

220
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.739
we have any idea at all or is it

221
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:08.190
possible for us to know how many religions would

222
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.770
have existed in human history?

223
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.919
You know, I am, I estimate there must be

224
00:14:14.929 --> 00:14:19.030
at least 10,000 branches of religion today and many

225
00:14:19.039 --> 00:14:21.909
times that amount that have gone extinct over time.

226
00:14:22.419 --> 00:14:26.080
Um, BUT this is a conservative generalization. Um, SOME

227
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:29.349
people have proposed that every individual has its own

228
00:14:29.359 --> 00:14:32.820
particular religion because every individual has a slightly different

229
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.969
way of looking at these things. Sometimes they combine

230
00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.270
the ideas of one religion with another religion or

231
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.309
certain aspects of it, or sometimes they'll ignore one,

232
00:14:43.119 --> 00:14:46.609
element of a, an organized religion. I mean, there's

233
00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:50.369
so many different ways that, um you could, you

234
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.940
could almost make the case that every individual has

235
00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.140
its own distinct religion. But again, that's not so

236
00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:01.090
different from the uh case in biology where you

237
00:15:01.099 --> 00:15:03.789
could say, well, every organism has its own genotype.

238
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:08.650
Yeah, that doesn't stop us from then identifying specific

239
00:15:08.659 --> 00:15:12.630
groups of comparison like species, which it can tune,

240
00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.719
can, can contain a lot of uh genotypic variants.

241
00:15:16.729 --> 00:15:21.390
But we, uh we, um we form these specific

242
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:27.030
groups based on all these specific shared characteristics and

243
00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:28.429
that gives us a group that we can compare,

244
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.539
compare to another group. We do much the same

245
00:15:31.549 --> 00:15:35.719
with religions because we can identify these traditional groups

246
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.429
uh um that at least the way they were

247
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.760
founded and uh recognize that, well, everything continues to

248
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.520
diversify and even those traditional groups go on to

249
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.719
branch into many different uh subgroups.

250
00:15:49.789 --> 00:15:54.320
And because there are these relationships between religions as

251
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.099
we're going to talk about. In the second, the

252
00:15:57.109 --> 00:16:01.710
relationships between some of them, is it easy to

253
00:16:01.719 --> 00:16:06.469
strictly separate one religion from another? Like, I don't

254
00:16:06.479 --> 00:16:08.489
know why is, is it possible at all to

255
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.989
say? Ok. So here we have Judaism and uh

256
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:18.200
uh uh from this point onward, it's already Christianity

257
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.190
or something like that. I mean, is it possible

258
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.349
to make that separation precisely or not?

259
00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:31.539
Well, every uh definition of groups and every um

260
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:35.700
um pattern of relationship we find is only a

261
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.859
hypothesis. I mean, that's how science works. We make

262
00:16:39.869 --> 00:16:43.260
hypotheses and then these aren't meant to be final

263
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.020
word. I mean, that's one of the things that

264
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:52.200
separates um science from fundamentalist religion that is every

265
00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:56.150
hypothesis we create is meant to be tested by

266
00:16:56.159 --> 00:17:02.179
future workers. Uh And uh um if uh the

267
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.839
ideas there are superseded by greater evidence, they're meant

268
00:17:05.848 --> 00:17:09.500
to be modified and adjusted over time. And um

269
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:15.118
science is a continually um uh refined process that,

270
00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.260
that continues to test itself and, and make um

271
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.900
uh changes and hopefully improvements to what it proposes.

272
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:28.550
And of course, we can represent the relationships between

273
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.530
the different religions in the form of an evolutionary

274
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.050
tree or a phylogenetic tree. Uh But uh does

275
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.969
that, do, do those trees represent in any way

276
00:17:41.209 --> 00:17:45.900
lather of progress or universal improvements? I mean, does

277
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.900
it have, does it follow any sort of, let's

278
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.530
say ology or something like that?

279
00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.400
Well, as we talked about before, um there was

280
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.810
a time when early evolutionists thought that it, there

281
00:17:59.819 --> 00:18:03.150
was some sort of innate path of progress to

282
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:09.410
evolution, but that has been abandoned by evolutionists since.

283
00:18:09.459 --> 00:18:13.140
Um uh And uh we no longer look at

284
00:18:13.349 --> 00:18:16.930
uh evolution as a ladder of innate progress. Uh

285
00:18:16.939 --> 00:18:20.729
We simply look at it as diversification over time

286
00:18:21.109 --> 00:18:24.609
as groups uh respond to the particular environments that

287
00:18:24.619 --> 00:18:29.810
they're in. Um SOMETIMES an environment will um select

288
00:18:29.819 --> 00:18:33.920
for specific groups. But the thing to remember is

289
00:18:34.369 --> 00:18:38.209
those environments are constantly changing too. So what may

290
00:18:38.219 --> 00:18:40.939
be a selective advantage for a group at one

291
00:18:40.949 --> 00:18:45.130
time in place um may be uh a disadvantage

292
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.329
in another. So, um there is no real innate,

293
00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:54.339
qualitative control or ladder of progress here. It's simply

294
00:18:54.349 --> 00:18:59.550
um trying to decipher uh what the diversification history

295
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.599
of things has been over time.

296
00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.660
So we can say that for example, one particular

297
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:14.280
organized religion is an improvement over another different organized

298
00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:20.040
religion or that organized religion even itself is better

299
00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:24.319
in some way is better than supernaturalism,

300
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.869
right? Yeah. And scientifically would, we would never do

301
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:34.079
that. Um uh Of course, that's when we're taking

302
00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:36.170
an unbiased look at things. And as we know,

303
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.880
uh a lot of people who are vested in

304
00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:43.209
religion aren't there to take an unbiased approach, they're

305
00:19:43.219 --> 00:19:47.489
there to promote a particular branch or another which

306
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.589
um then makes it um something other than a,

307
00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:55.329
a, an unbiased uh scientific analysis of history.

308
00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.530
And how do we decipher then the patterns of

309
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.709
relationship between the different religions. How, how do we

310
00:20:04.719 --> 00:20:05.329
do that?

311
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.790
Well, we basically look for um, patterns of uh

312
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.040
characters. Uh Well, I should say whether it's uh

313
00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:19.380
in biology or culture, that's one of the steps

314
00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.229
we do is we look for these, these shared

315
00:20:22.239 --> 00:20:26.579
characteristics, uh in particular groups that appear to be

316
00:20:26.589 --> 00:20:29.829
unique to these groups and, and that we can

317
00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:33.290
theorize their shared because they were all derived from

318
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:37.569
a common ancestor. Now, with culture, we have an

319
00:20:37.579 --> 00:20:42.260
advantage uh over biology that biologists don't have. And

320
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.130
that is so much of the diversification of culture

321
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.170
occurred um during literate time that we have written

322
00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:55.400
contemporaneous records of things like founders or ancestors and

323
00:20:55.410 --> 00:21:00.109
diversification patterns. That's something that biologists would only dream

324
00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:03.790
about because again, most speciation events happened millions of

325
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.880
years ago. So there's no way of having any

326
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.369
kind of, of uh historical written records of it.

327
00:21:09.599 --> 00:21:12.719
Uh All we have are these character patterns which

328
00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:16.469
we use to hypothesize patterns of relationships that we

329
00:21:16.479 --> 00:21:19.859
then explain with our theories of uh of uh

330
00:21:19.869 --> 00:21:24.670
evolution. Um But culture has this added piece of

331
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.359
information that is, is very valuable and, and um

332
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.729
gives us uh a ma sometimes a, a very

333
00:21:32.739 --> 00:21:37.040
solid pattern of, of relationship. Mhm

334
00:21:37.449 --> 00:21:40.540
And I would also imagine that it would be

335
00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.750
very complicated or that, that it is in fact

336
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.709
very complicated to disentangle the effects that natural and

337
00:21:48.719 --> 00:21:52.880
cultural selection might have had on religion or separating

338
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.229
what is biological from what is cultural.

339
00:21:56.469 --> 00:21:59.199
Right. Yeah, it, it, it's hard to, I, I

340
00:21:59.209 --> 00:22:02.579
think when we're dealing with cultural evolution, we're, we're

341
00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:07.119
pretty much confined to ideologies, uh, and, uh, um,

342
00:22:07.219 --> 00:22:13.920
traditions and, and, um, uh, the biological evolution um,

343
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.030
is a, a completely different entity than, uh, the

344
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.310
cultural evolution. Uh It's possible that 1 may, uh,

345
00:22:22.469 --> 00:22:26.270
um influence the other in some ways but they're

346
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.489
really separate, uh, um, elements in a deep history,

347
00:22:31.579 --> 00:22:35.839
by the way you used the word, uh, ideologies.

348
00:22:35.849 --> 00:22:38.930
There, does it have a specific meaning in this

349
00:22:38.939 --> 00:22:39.699
context?

350
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:43.040
Um, I, I, well, in other words, the ideology,

351
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:48.069
it's a, a, a, a, an understanding or, um,

352
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.719
something having to do with human, human thought rather

353
00:22:52.729 --> 00:22:57.380
than, um, you know, growing an extra arm or,

354
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.869
or something that's physical. I mean, it's, it's, uh,

355
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:06.160
you're dealing with, um, uh, uh, a group thought

356
00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:11.930
patterns, um, rather than, uh, uh, physical phenomena.

357
00:23:12.589 --> 00:23:18.520
Mhm. And so evolutionarily speaking, uh, first of all,

358
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:22.520
what is, what you call in the book Supernaturalism

359
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:26.199
and then we'll compare it to organized religion. But

360
00:23:26.209 --> 00:23:28.119
what is supernaturalism?

361
00:23:29.219 --> 00:23:32.829
Uh, SUPERNATURALISM is just the, the belief in, um,

362
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:39.339
anything that is beyond the, the natural, that is,

363
00:23:39.349 --> 00:23:43.290
um, you know, a belief in, uh, s some

364
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.640
sort of spiritual essence or something that is basically

365
00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:54.959
beyond the physical world. Um, SO, uh, uh, it,

366
00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.849
it eventually becomes more organized with, uh, with, uh,

367
00:23:58.859 --> 00:24:04.410
organized religion. Uh, ONCE we start, um, putting structure

368
00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:09.089
into that, um, you know, maybe, uh, revered figures

369
00:24:09.099 --> 00:24:14.199
and, and different organizational structures and, and, um, laws

370
00:24:14.209 --> 00:24:17.770
commandments. I mean, all of these things they eventually

371
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:23.150
came to more formalize, uh, different types of, uh,

372
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.530
religious belief.

373
00:24:25.189 --> 00:24:28.869
Mhm. Uh, AND do we have a good understanding

374
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:34.270
of how we move from supernaturalism or even anthropomorphic

375
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:39.449
supernaturalism to organized religion? Are there any particular kinds

376
00:24:39.459 --> 00:24:44.310
of steps that societies usually follow to get there

377
00:24:44.319 --> 00:24:44.949
or not?

378
00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:48.859
You know, it's, it's a real generalization. Uh uh

379
00:24:48.869 --> 00:24:53.160
Again, um, it's not a ladder, it's not a

380
00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:58.380
linear path. Um But it's a, it's a level

381
00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.959
of generality more than anything else. Um So, I

382
00:25:01.969 --> 00:25:05.859
mean, supernaturalism is just this belief in the supernatural.

383
00:25:06.329 --> 00:25:08.969
And, uh, it, it was thought to be, you

384
00:25:08.979 --> 00:25:14.760
know, an, the earliest form of, uh, of any

385
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.060
kind of religion because it started with sort of

386
00:25:18.069 --> 00:25:21.790
a pure animistic belief, you know, uh that all

387
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.739
things have a spiritual essence, whether it's the wind,

388
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:28.020
the sun, the moon or, or motherhood, all of

389
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:34.459
these things were revered, um, probably by, um the

390
00:25:34.469 --> 00:25:38.469
most, uh um uh some of the earliest human

391
00:25:38.479 --> 00:25:40.739
cultures. And again, of course, this is all largely

392
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:44.510
speculative because we're dealing with things well, before, um,

393
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.540
any kind of written records or even anthropological uh

394
00:25:48.569 --> 00:25:52.800
records. Anthropomorphic supernaturalism seems to be kind of a

395
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:58.329
natural um addition eventually because, uh I think eventually,

396
00:25:58.339 --> 00:26:02.500
uh they have record of attributing human characteristics to

397
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.839
these supernatural elements. So, you know, uh this reverence

398
00:26:06.849 --> 00:26:10.099
for the moon became a moon goddess, the, the

399
00:26:10.109 --> 00:26:12.410
reverence for the sun, a sun God and, and

400
00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.979
so on and so forth. They be, they became

401
00:26:14.989 --> 00:26:20.680
actual entities of some sorts. And, um, you know,

402
00:26:20.689 --> 00:26:25.949
eventually these, these, uh, uh beliefs became more and

403
00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:29.989
more formalized as did other ma uh, other matters

404
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.790
of, uh, social behavior among humans.

405
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:37.859
But then when we talk about organized religion, uh

406
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.810
the first organized religions were polytheistic,

407
00:26:43.069 --> 00:26:46.349
right? Yeah, they, they were, they appeared to be

408
00:26:46.359 --> 00:26:49.589
uh uh animistic polytheism. That is, I mean, they

409
00:26:49.599 --> 00:26:53.750
were, they were um certainly polytheistic, but the gods

410
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.819
still represented all these natural uh elements or, or

411
00:26:58.829 --> 00:27:03.050
um phenomena of one sort or another. Um They

412
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.469
became more social with time and um and with

413
00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:10.439
time, the uh pantheons of gods even developed um

414
00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:15.449
uh more hierarchical structures or be, you know, um

415
00:27:15.489 --> 00:27:18.900
you develop things like chief gods and, and God

416
00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:24.140
and uh various uh high goddesses. Um uh AND

417
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:30.000
this eventually evolved into more um male dominated pantheons

418
00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.359
uh because uh it kind of followed the social

419
00:27:33.369 --> 00:27:37.010
structure of uh other parts of human society where

420
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:41.560
males came to dominate with armies and emperors and

421
00:27:41.569 --> 00:27:44.479
all kinds of other things. So there was this

422
00:27:44.489 --> 00:27:48.849
constant um um change and we can look back

423
00:27:48.859 --> 00:27:52.189
historically on it and we can, we can see

424
00:27:52.199 --> 00:27:55.729
historically different chapters of it even though it wasn't

425
00:27:55.739 --> 00:27:59.219
a, a uh any kind of progressive thing. It

426
00:27:59.229 --> 00:28:02.349
was simply the change we observed over history

427
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.589
and geographically. Do we have any idea where the

428
00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:10.920
first organized religions develop?

429
00:28:11.339 --> 00:28:14.520
You know, that's a really tough question because again,

430
00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:18.189
like all things uh in deep history, the further

431
00:28:18.199 --> 00:28:20.319
back you ti in time you go, the more

432
00:28:20.329 --> 00:28:26.569
speculative our ideas become now, uh going back to

433
00:28:26.579 --> 00:28:30.689
the earliest organized religions, uh we know that um

434
00:28:31.319 --> 00:28:36.859
both that there were two massive uh um uh

435
00:28:36.869 --> 00:28:42.609
groups that developed uh before 11,000 years ago. One

436
00:28:42.829 --> 00:28:46.500
was it indigenous Eastern organized religions? And the other

437
00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:50.160
was indigenous western organized religions which also contained part

438
00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:56.219
of the northern Africa. Um Now, although that they

439
00:28:56.229 --> 00:29:00.160
go back at least 11,000 years, there were probably

440
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:03.400
much older ones uh particularly from other parts of

441
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.280
the African continent where humans were first evolving. Um

442
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:11.160
But unfortunately, most records of the earliest indigenous African

443
00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:16.219
religions, other than these Egyptian ones uh were lost

444
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:22.270
um partly because they develop so long before any

445
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:27.530
kind of literacy. Um But also because um um

446
00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.939
Muslim conquests of the northern half of the continent

447
00:29:31.949 --> 00:29:35.060
and Christian conquest of the southern half part of

448
00:29:35.069 --> 00:29:38.219
the um objectives of conquest was not only to

449
00:29:38.229 --> 00:29:42.300
convert but also to subvert the histories of these

450
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.959
other belief systems. And uh sometimes that even included

451
00:29:45.969 --> 00:29:51.770
destroying uh uh records wherever they did exist. So

452
00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.770
it's a tough question. Um And uh but like

453
00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:59.719
all things in evolutionary studies uh, we can, we

454
00:29:59.729 --> 00:30:01.790
only have what we have to work with. And

455
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.319
so we, we look at the evidence we have

456
00:30:04.329 --> 00:30:05.849
and try to do the best we can with

457
00:30:05.859 --> 00:30:08.920
that. It seems true in, in the biology. Of

458
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.859
course, uh, uh, we, the further back you go

459
00:30:12.869 --> 00:30:16.369
in the fossil record, the, the less information we

460
00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.140
have and the less these things look like modern

461
00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.520
animals and so the less we understand them.

462
00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.479
Mhm. I imagine that it's more or less the

463
00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:28.630
same that we find when studying languages. Because for

464
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.650
example, we can go back up till proto Indo

465
00:30:33.069 --> 00:30:38.199
European and uh establish the relationship between proto Indo

466
00:30:38.589 --> 00:30:43.949
European and all the major European and Western Asian

467
00:30:43.959 --> 00:30:48.699
languages. But we don't exactly know what came before

468
00:30:48.709 --> 00:30:49.069
that.

469
00:30:49.479 --> 00:30:52.089
Right. Exactly. And again, the, the linguists, they're the

470
00:30:52.099 --> 00:30:56.439
ones that are sort of leading the, um the

471
00:30:56.449 --> 00:31:01.349
pack in social sciences and bringing phylogenetics back into

472
00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:06.130
the social sciences. Um Hopefully that'll, that'll spread to

473
00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.160
uh the other areas of the social sciences with

474
00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:09.859
time.

475
00:31:11.209 --> 00:31:17.319
So you mentioned their Western indigenous uh organized religion

476
00:31:17.329 --> 00:31:21.770
and Eastern indigenous organized religion are those the two

477
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:26.410
main original branches of organized religion.

478
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.260
It appears to be uh based on the information

479
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:33.290
that we currently have. But again, that's based on

480
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:37.400
an incomplete data set and it'll, it'll probably always

481
00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:40.000
be changing as we, you know, we find out

482
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:44.319
more and more uh going on. Um PART of

483
00:31:44.329 --> 00:31:46.920
it is that this is kind of a different

484
00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:52.229
way of looking at um, these studies. And, um,

485
00:31:52.569 --> 00:31:55.810
what I've done is simply set out some templates

486
00:31:55.819 --> 00:32:00.290
and ideas that I'm hoping will be uh then

487
00:32:01.099 --> 00:32:06.170
um modified by specialists in all these areas and

488
00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.869
continued. And, I mean, that's how, that's how uh

489
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:13.079
it works in the biological science is that there

490
00:32:13.089 --> 00:32:15.959
are generalists that work with specialists and it goes

491
00:32:15.969 --> 00:32:19.449
back and forth between specialists and generalists and specialists

492
00:32:19.459 --> 00:32:21.910
and generalists. But that's how we develop these finer

493
00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.689
and finer tuned uh patterns of evolutionary diversification in

494
00:32:25.699 --> 00:32:28.829
the biological world. I'm hoping that the same thing

495
00:32:28.839 --> 00:32:32.310
will happen now in um these areas of the

496
00:32:32.319 --> 00:32:33.589
social sciences.

497
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.349
But as far as we know, at least for

498
00:32:37.359 --> 00:32:41.130
now, it is from these two main branches that

499
00:32:41.229 --> 00:32:45.619
all the other major organized religions branch.

500
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:51.579
Again, that is uh based on the, the um

501
00:32:51.969 --> 00:32:54.530
the groups that I looked at those are the

502
00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.000
patterns that I come up with. That's not to

503
00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:04.339
say that there, there aren't um other uh say

504
00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:07.560
earlier groups that will be uh discovered on the

505
00:33:07.569 --> 00:33:13.099
African continent, for example. Um And uh but yeah,

506
00:33:13.109 --> 00:33:15.729
you know, when, when you look at these Western

507
00:33:15.739 --> 00:33:19.739
groups, I mean, the western groups not only involved

508
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:23.859
uh um you know, the Mediterranean region and the

509
00:33:23.869 --> 00:33:27.150
uh northern parts of Africa, but also spread to

510
00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.430
the Americas. I mean, that's all the uh the

511
00:33:30.439 --> 00:33:34.880
new world. Um EARLY new world religions came from

512
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.920
the West, I mean, you know, the, the um

513
00:33:38.079 --> 00:33:42.069
English and the Spanish uh they all colonized and,

514
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:46.569
and basically um sent conquests into the new world

515
00:33:46.579 --> 00:33:52.550
and um uh much of uh what eventually uh

516
00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.339
came there ultimately came from. Um Well, not only

517
00:33:57.349 --> 00:34:00.510
the west, but the east. Um IF we look

518
00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.989
at the way the, the uh uh continents were

519
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.879
um positioned, say going back uh 11, 11,000 years,

520
00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.438
we can see there were land connections, for example,

521
00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:17.188
between Siberia and North America. As some people think

522
00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:21.319
that that's how um humans first came into the

523
00:34:21.329 --> 00:34:26.079
Americas was it was by these sorts of connections,

524
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:31.110
which means um early, the earliest um religions in

525
00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.810
the Americas were maybe offshoots of Eastern organized religions.

526
00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:40.679
But then, of course, uh later on, uh after

527
00:34:40.688 --> 00:34:43.728
um we had the, well for a while, we

528
00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:47.128
had the separation of North America from Asia when

529
00:34:47.138 --> 00:34:51.569
the, we, we lost the land connection uh across

530
00:34:51.579 --> 00:34:57.479
the um Arctic region there. Um uh And uh

531
00:34:57.489 --> 00:35:05.870
these religions from um the East, East Asian area

532
00:35:05.919 --> 00:35:11.510
uh developed independently in the Americas until um many

533
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.989
centuries later when seafaring opened up again, migration into

534
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.320
the Americas from another part of the world, the,

535
00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:23.459
the West. And that's when these Western um ideas

536
00:35:23.469 --> 00:35:27.110
and religions began to permeate the Americas and um

537
00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.100
that came in, in forms of conquest. Um YOU

538
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:33.949
know, Spain and, and England and all these powers,

539
00:35:33.959 --> 00:35:40.800
they um brought a powerful um a, a armies

540
00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.560
in, uh, well, even small armies, but they came

541
00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:47.290
with weapons that the Americans, the indigenous Americans didn't

542
00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.290
have gunpowder swords, horses. Um, AND they brought a

543
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.739
lot of disease with them. And, and again, the

544
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:59.340
result was, um, most of the indigenous religions in

545
00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:03.610
Americas at that point in time were uh either

546
00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:07.919
extinguished or highly modified. And, um, I mean, the,

547
00:36:07.929 --> 00:36:11.889
the, the evolution of the social evolution of the

548
00:36:11.899 --> 00:36:15.760
planet is very complex and all these things had

549
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:18.120
to be taken into consideration when we're trying to

550
00:36:18.129 --> 00:36:21.389
figure out the history of all of these different

551
00:36:21.399 --> 00:36:23.080
uh belief systems over time.

552
00:36:24.199 --> 00:36:28.979
And when you try to study our particular religions

553
00:36:28.989 --> 00:36:31.979
or, or where they originated and how they evolved

554
00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:37.300
over time, do you look into specific factors that

555
00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:40.100
might have played a role there? Like for example,

556
00:36:40.199 --> 00:36:47.500
ecological factors, economic factors, political, social, cultural factors, philosophical

557
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:51.580
factors, even though do you look at specific kinds

558
00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.219
of factors or not?

559
00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.310
I I consider all factors that might indicate some

560
00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:02.149
historical relationship between groups. I mean, most ideologies have

561
00:37:02.159 --> 00:37:05.360
uh elements that were present in earlier belief systems.

562
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.919
Um The first step is to look at as

563
00:37:07.929 --> 00:37:12.199
many uh social characteristics as possible and then just

564
00:37:12.209 --> 00:37:15.580
look for those, those similarities, similarities that appear to

565
00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:19.909
be unique to certain groups. Um And uh then

566
00:37:19.919 --> 00:37:24.229
we can uh hypothesize that these were due to

567
00:37:24.239 --> 00:37:26.649
uh some sort of common ancestry at some point

568
00:37:26.659 --> 00:37:29.439
in time. You know, we don't have to, um,

569
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:33.010
and we can look at, for example, all Abrahamic

570
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.750
religions and, and find some, uh, aspects that are

571
00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.360
unique to them, whether it's, um, you know, certain

572
00:37:39.729 --> 00:37:44.790
prophets or, or certain, uh, rules or structures. Um,

573
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.270
AND we can use that to make these groups

574
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.439
that have some sort of historical, uh connection, um,

575
00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.320
that, but, you know, when we're, we're doing those

576
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:57.909
sorts of studies, we need to consider, uh, as

577
00:37:57.919 --> 00:38:02.629
many, uh types of, of, um, of things as

578
00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:04.550
possible. Mhm.

579
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.830
And, uh, I mean, those different factors would manifest

580
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:13.409
in terms of, or translate to how religion, how

581
00:38:13.419 --> 00:38:18.750
particular religions spread across time and geography, but also

582
00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:24.169
perhaps would translate into the particular kinds of beliefs

583
00:38:24.179 --> 00:38:28.550
that develop over time in a particular religion. Is

584
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:28.969
that it?

585
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:32.979
Yeah, I mean, these ideas of, of how things

586
00:38:32.989 --> 00:38:36.110
are related are all res retrospective. Of course, I

587
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.489
mean, we're looking at these things today and trying

588
00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.750
to piece it all together. Um,

589
00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:47.639
SO going back then to the two main brains

590
00:38:47.959 --> 00:38:52.070
that you mentioned earlier and starting with the Eastern

591
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.239
branch, could you tell us a little, of course,

592
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.580
we won't have time to go through all the

593
00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.199
different branches and ramifications here. But could you tell

594
00:39:01.209 --> 00:39:05.320
us a little bit about Asian cyclist is what

595
00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:06.100
is there?

596
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.679
Yeah, I mean, that's, that's the, basically what I,

597
00:39:09.689 --> 00:39:12.639
I look at as the main uh indigenous Eastern

598
00:39:12.649 --> 00:39:15.989
organized religion uh that had its early roots in

599
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.290
India and it can generally be characterized by, you

600
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:26.000
know, seeing time as cyclic with Samsara reincarnation, transmigration,

601
00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:29.419
Yin Yang or uh other uh you know, cycles

602
00:39:29.429 --> 00:39:32.899
of existence depending on which subbranch you're talking about.

603
00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:37.129
Um It also includes employing, usually employing some sort

604
00:39:37.139 --> 00:39:41.860
of mind body meditative practices. Um YOU know, uh

605
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:47.610
whether that's uh um yeah, yoga or what whatever.

606
00:39:47.649 --> 00:39:51.129
Um IT'S an important part of uh most of

607
00:39:51.139 --> 00:39:57.250
these uh branches. And um basically, they, they all

608
00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:02.649
emphasize that correct ethical conduct over uh dogmatic scripture,

609
00:40:02.659 --> 00:40:06.810
which uh differentiates it quite a bit from the

610
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:11.399
uh western um organized religions. And you know, that

611
00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:14.770
the main branches basically of Asian cyclic system we

612
00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:20.310
have are Hinduism Buddhism and uh the Tai religions.

613
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.879
But um of course, we have that um that

614
00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:30.649
branch that uh entered the, the Americas at some

615
00:40:30.659 --> 00:40:34.600
point in time and that, that connection and that

616
00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:38.419
part, that part of deep history is, is somewhat

617
00:40:38.429 --> 00:40:44.389
um more clouded because of uh uh its early

618
00:40:44.399 --> 00:40:47.810
date. But also the way that so much of

619
00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:51.989
that history was lost with um the conquest from

620
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.120
the West later on.

621
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:58.939
Right. So, uh and, but sticking to the East

622
00:40:58.949 --> 00:41:02.620
for, for a little bit more. Uh So, hi,

623
00:41:02.679 --> 00:41:08.860
Hinduism, is it among the major religion, major organized

624
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:13.300
religions that are still alive today? Is it the

625
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:15.340
oldest of them all or

626
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.689
not? It's certainly one of the oldest we know

627
00:41:18.699 --> 00:41:21.399
of, I mean, it, um it sought to go

628
00:41:21.409 --> 00:41:24.389
back, you know, at least 11,000 years or more

629
00:41:24.399 --> 00:41:30.330
in India. And uh it's, it's um it's unusual

630
00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.979
and that it has no single prophet founder or

631
00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:37.699
core inspirational figure. Um And it, it follows, uh

632
00:41:37.729 --> 00:41:41.989
you know, five basic tenants. Uh BASICALLY Dharma which

633
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.379
is a duty of maintaining order in nature. Um

634
00:41:46.389 --> 00:41:49.379
Karma, which are the consequences of one actions in

635
00:41:49.389 --> 00:41:53.219
this life on their future lives. Uh Some Sara,

636
00:41:53.229 --> 00:41:57.659
which is the Hindu concept of rebirth um or

637
00:41:57.669 --> 00:42:02.379
like reincarnation of sorts, a yoga which is sort

638
00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:06.350
of the aids to meditation. And uh it's sacred

639
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:12.169
texts are called the Vedas. I mean, um Hinduism

640
00:42:12.179 --> 00:42:17.909
had its, its greatest early expansion um under the

641
00:42:17.919 --> 00:42:21.810
Gupta Empire uh between the 4th and 6th century

642
00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:24.260
in India. Mhm

643
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:29.889
And of course, another major eastern relig organized religion

644
00:42:29.899 --> 00:42:34.250
is Buddhism. What could you tell us about perhaps

645
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:39.050
its origins and its phylogenetic relationships?

646
00:42:40.229 --> 00:42:44.070
Uh Buddhism evolved um from the Sramana uh movement

647
00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:47.290
in India in the fifth century. BCE along with

648
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.669
Jainism and uh the Sur Sur I'm sorry, Surma

649
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:57.050
movement rejected the, the Vedas of Hinduism. And uh

650
00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.060
it followed the teaching. Uh And at least Buddhism

651
00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:03.239
followed the teachings of uh this Charismatic uh spiritual

652
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:08.629
founder, Gamma Buddha, otherwise known as the Buddha. Um

653
00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.949
And the great expansion of Buddhism began with uh

654
00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.350
Ashoka, the great ruler of the uh Mara Empire

655
00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.479
in the third century BCE, like uh so many

656
00:43:19.629 --> 00:43:23.040
major religions, they were, they were tied to, um,

657
00:43:23.399 --> 00:43:26.409
um, emperors at some point in their history which

658
00:43:26.419 --> 00:43:29.810
greatly expanded their influence around the globe.

659
00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:35.250
And now the main places where we can find

660
00:43:35.459 --> 00:43:40.929
Buddhist people is, are in the, are in Asia,

661
00:43:40.939 --> 00:43:43.219
right in Eastern Asia, particularly

662
00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:46.360
that. That's right. It, it kind of moved their

663
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:52.070
core from, uh, from India out, out eastward. Mhm.

664
00:43:52.739 --> 00:43:56.360
And what about Taoism? I mean, where does it

665
00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:59.780
come from? And how does it relate to the

666
00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:01.800
other Eastern religions?

667
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:05.629
Well, uh Taoism is part of a, a more

668
00:44:05.639 --> 00:44:09.209
general, um, a group I call Tao E religion.

669
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:12.489
And it's a branch of Asian cyclist is that

670
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.939
uh formed in China. Uh And uh it uh

671
00:44:15.949 --> 00:44:22.290
formed two major groups, uh Taoism uh and Confucianism

672
00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:26.229
in China and then also spread to Japan as

673
00:44:26.239 --> 00:44:30.830
Shintoism. You know, most Taig branches are, are polytheistic

674
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.780
and they emphasize a very strong reverence for ancestors.

675
00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:39.280
And so you mentioned Confucianism there, I mean, when

676
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:43.760
it comes to Confucianism and Buddhism, for example, many

677
00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:50.290
times people talk about them as philosophies or religions.

678
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.030
I mean, does that debate matter here? Does it

679
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:58.010
matter if they are philosophies or religions?

680
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.689
Well, for me, if they are philosophies that are

681
00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:05.520
tied to supernatural beliefs, then they, they constitute uh

682
00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:09.229
religions in the most basic sense. Um But it's

683
00:45:09.239 --> 00:45:15.260
true, the, the um um Tao Taoism um was

684
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:20.649
basically a philosophical type of uh uh what I

685
00:45:20.659 --> 00:45:24.100
call religion. Um uh PARTLY because, uh you know,

686
00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:28.419
Taoism was uh was founded by a philosopher named

687
00:45:28.429 --> 00:45:33.030
Lao Zi in the um uh sixth century BCE

688
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:37.060
and emphasized uh natural order uh or as Confucianism

689
00:45:37.199 --> 00:45:40.149
was also founded by a philosopher Confucius in the

690
00:45:40.159 --> 00:45:46.219
sixth century BCE. Uh It differed from um uh

691
00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:51.250
uh Taoism in that uh Confucius emphasized social order

692
00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:54.419
rather than uh natural order. But uh basically, there

693
00:45:54.429 --> 00:45:59.689
was the same overriding philosophical uh base uh that

694
00:45:59.699 --> 00:46:00.409
guided it.

695
00:46:01.169 --> 00:46:05.570
Mhm. So, we've, we've gone through some of the

696
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:10.169
major organized religions in the east. Now, looking at

697
00:46:10.179 --> 00:46:15.229
the west and you mentioned earlier, North Africa Europe.

698
00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:17.669
So let's talk a little bit about the Afro

699
00:46:17.679 --> 00:46:22.195
Euro Mediterranean organized rule religions. What part of the

700
00:46:22.205 --> 00:46:26.084
main dominant religion, the most dominant religions that we

701
00:46:26.094 --> 00:46:27.425
have to consider here?

702
00:46:27.655 --> 00:46:31.524
Well, today, uh, the most dominant religions by far

703
00:46:31.534 --> 00:46:35.084
are Christianity and Islam, uh, which collectively make up

704
00:46:35.094 --> 00:46:38.354
more than 60% of all religious people according to

705
00:46:38.364 --> 00:46:42.395
the 2010, uh, study by Pew research.

706
00:46:43.639 --> 00:46:48.090
Mhm. And, and, but then, for example, within Christian

707
00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:52.750
is we now have many different kinds of branches,

708
00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:56.310
right? Oh, we do for sure. Uh, um, uh,

709
00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:01.540
Christianity and, uh, um, both Islam again, as I

710
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.979
say, they make up 60% of all religious people.

711
00:47:03.989 --> 00:47:07.989
There, there are thousands of different branches. Um, EVEN

712
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.699
though, uh, both Christianity and Islam are, are forms

713
00:47:12.709 --> 00:47:16.780
of Abrahamic religion. Who's, um, or you could say

714
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:22.139
the mother religion of Abraham is, was, um, uh,

715
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:27.639
uh, Judaism of sorts. And, um, although even, even

716
00:47:27.649 --> 00:47:32.260
though today traditional Judaism makes up less than 8%

717
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:36.860
of all religious people according to the Pew study,

718
00:47:37.399 --> 00:47:40.750
um, you could say it is again, the, the

719
00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.719
mother religion of, of the others that it just

720
00:47:44.729 --> 00:47:47.479
diversified over time. And, I mean, that's a p

721
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:49.080
pyogenic perspective.

722
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.699
Mhm. And, uh, could you tell us a little

723
00:47:52.709 --> 00:47:57.409
bit about greco-roman polytheism because of course, when talking

724
00:47:57.419 --> 00:48:02.090
about particularly Western civilization, many times, people refer to

725
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:06.209
Greece and Rome as the gravel of western civilization.

726
00:48:06.219 --> 00:48:12.889
So how do those polytheistic religions connect to the

727
00:48:12.899 --> 00:48:14.500
rest in the West?

728
00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:20.370
Well, the Greco Roman civilization is, it's called that

729
00:48:20.379 --> 00:48:24.909
because um the Roman civilization adopted so much of

730
00:48:24.919 --> 00:48:28.969
Greek civilization as it, as it came into power.

731
00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.870
Um Even if you look at even the gods

732
00:48:32.879 --> 00:48:36.270
of, of uh the Greek pantheon, many of those

733
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.429
same gods were simply given new names and transformed

734
00:48:39.439 --> 00:48:44.030
into the Roman pantheons over time. Um The rise

735
00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.620
of a Greco Roman civilization was a key part

736
00:48:47.629 --> 00:48:50.939
of the rise of Western civilization. And it's uh

737
00:48:51.449 --> 00:48:54.760
and it's uh the religion uh permeated that, I

738
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:59.540
mean, the, the rulers of uh Greco Roman civilization,

739
00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:03.560
they closely tied themselves to uh the pantheons of

740
00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:07.510
polytheistic gods. They had, I mean, many emperors were

741
00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.500
even defied as part of the pantheon. Um It

742
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:14.439
was only later in the fourth century ce that

743
00:49:14.449 --> 00:49:18.040
uh the Roman Empire eventually adopted monotheism as its

744
00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:19.080
state religion.

745
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.300
Mhm. And earlier I asked you how we went

746
00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:28.820
or how we go from supernaturalism to organized religion.

747
00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:32.590
But now how do we go from polytheism to

748
00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.939
monotheism? Do we have a good understanding of that?

749
00:49:36.209 --> 00:49:38.919
Well, you know, at first there was a pantheon

750
00:49:38.929 --> 00:49:42.320
of many gods. Um, I mean, in fact, there

751
00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:47.270
were many different pantheons, um, different regions, uh, almost

752
00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:51.040
every different region of the area had its own

753
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:54.439
specific pantheons, sometimes they had different gods in charge.

754
00:49:54.800 --> 00:50:00.620
Um Eventually, uh these pantheons came to recognize a

755
00:50:00.629 --> 00:50:03.439
chief God. And so there would be a kind

756
00:50:03.449 --> 00:50:06.770
of a God in charge. And um as uh

757
00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:11.669
gods, a adopted specific rules throughout these pantheons. And

758
00:50:11.679 --> 00:50:15.629
then this organizational structure was built and eventually this

759
00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:21.709
uh uh developed into a chief God becoming an

760
00:50:21.719 --> 00:50:25.969
only God. And um of course, once that happened,

761
00:50:26.179 --> 00:50:29.629
that was the rise of monotheism. Um THIS fit

762
00:50:29.639 --> 00:50:33.090
well for, for empires, you know, where there was

763
00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:36.489
always a ruler looking for divine support to enhance

764
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:42.110
uh universal respect. Um uh Emperors were sometimes inducted

765
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.689
in the pantheons of gods, as I said. But

766
00:50:44.719 --> 00:50:48.969
uh once monotheism developed emperors began to also claim

767
00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:51.489
some sort of special relationship to the one and

768
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.550
only God. So again, the the empires and uh

769
00:50:55.629 --> 00:51:00.199
early um forms of these polytheistic and early monotheistic

770
00:51:00.209 --> 00:51:03.409
religions, it kind of went hand in hand. Mhm

771
00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:07.679
Yes. And it's very interesting because uh you mentioned

772
00:51:07.689 --> 00:51:13.149
there that in polytheistic religions, we tend to have

773
00:51:13.159 --> 00:51:17.860
a hierarchy among the gods. And even in Christianity,

774
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:21.125
for example, of course, there's just one single god,

775
00:51:21.135 --> 00:51:24.004
but we also have lots and lots of saints.

776
00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:28.895
So it's almost as if that sort of hierarchical

777
00:51:28.905 --> 00:51:34.784
organization also translated into some of the monotheistic religions.

778
00:51:34.794 --> 00:51:38.235
But instead of saying that the other divine entities

779
00:51:38.245 --> 00:51:41.245
are also gods or minor gods, we call them

780
00:51:41.254 --> 00:51:43.364
saints in Christianity, for example.

781
00:51:43.955 --> 00:51:45.774
Right. Yeah, a large part of it is just

782
00:51:45.784 --> 00:51:48.560
a change in terminology. But you're right. Um The

783
00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:54.560
differences between the pantheons of, of say sub gods

784
00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:57.790
is not that different from uh the uh the

785
00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.280
group of saints. I mean, I remember I went

786
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:04.070
to a parochial school growing up and, and I

787
00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:07.169
remember the nuns telling us, well, you know, if

788
00:52:07.179 --> 00:52:09.949
you lose something, you pray to this saint or

789
00:52:09.959 --> 00:52:12.449
if you want uh something else to happen, you

790
00:52:12.459 --> 00:52:15.540
pray to that saint. I mean, uh at some

791
00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:21.830
point, the similarities are extremely um close there. And

792
00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:27.840
um it's uh it's interesting um the uh in

793
00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:32.800
fact, the early conquest of the Americas, uh often

794
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:36.530
some of the strategies were when um the uh

795
00:52:37.189 --> 00:52:40.870
the Catholic church would come into an area and

796
00:52:40.879 --> 00:52:44.449
try and convert the masses. They could, they would

797
00:52:44.459 --> 00:52:46.949
go to a place of worship that had uh

798
00:52:46.959 --> 00:52:52.439
different statues of different gods and sometimes simply uh

799
00:52:52.459 --> 00:52:56.280
rename or use those same statues to represent different

800
00:52:56.290 --> 00:53:01.570
saints um that had the advantage of making people

801
00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:04.629
more comfortable with this change that was being forced

802
00:53:04.639 --> 00:53:07.110
upon them. So, um, yeah, it's a, it's a,

803
00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:13.139
it's an interesting sort of, um, uh, historical uh

804
00:53:13.389 --> 00:53:16.050
progression that we see and I don't mean progression

805
00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:18.510
in terms of progress. I mean, just it's the

806
00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:19.520
way that it happened

807
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.189
in terms of change. Right.

808
00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:23.189
It change.

809
00:53:24.449 --> 00:53:27.739
So, and what do we know about what might

810
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:33.229
have been the earliest, uh religious manifestations of monotheism?

811
00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:36.969
Well, you know, of course, we're dependent on archaeological

812
00:53:36.979 --> 00:53:39.919
information for that. So we can only speculate but

813
00:53:40.209 --> 00:53:42.389
some of the things, the information that we do

814
00:53:42.399 --> 00:53:46.560
have. Uh I was, for example, uh in the

815
00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:51.080
14th century BCE of Egypt, um uh Pharaoh Akan

816
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:56.030
Nain declared the chief God atten um in the

817
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.639
pantheon there to be the only God at some

818
00:53:58.649 --> 00:54:03.060
point. Um And this was what's sometimes called Atin

819
00:54:03.169 --> 00:54:06.139
is, and um so for a brief period, uh

820
00:54:06.149 --> 00:54:10.050
we had this monotheism there which the Pharaoh and

821
00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:14.280
his wife claimed a special relationship to uh and

822
00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:18.479
being the intermediaries to which gave them an added

823
00:54:18.489 --> 00:54:21.899
amount of power, of course, but this was very

824
00:54:21.909 --> 00:54:26.760
uh relatively short lived because once he died, um

825
00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:30.840
the uh old priests of the uh older pantheon,

826
00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:33.500
um I looked at him as sort of a

827
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:36.330
heretic in a way and, and brought things back

828
00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:39.840
to uh the older pantheon and at is uh

829
00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:43.570
basically disappeared. It wasn't until about the 12th century

830
00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:47.909
BCE that we had a, another form of monotheism

831
00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:53.030
rise called zoroastrianism. Um This was basically from the

832
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:58.189
Persian prophet Zor Astor who recognized the chief God

833
00:54:58.199 --> 00:55:05.159
uh uh a Hera Mazda. Um This became AAA

834
00:55:05.169 --> 00:55:11.360
um monotheistic um uh religion that actually still survives

835
00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:14.590
today, mainly by um a group called the Parsi

836
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:19.770
in India, even though it developed originally in Persia.

837
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:23.570
Um And uh finally, the one, the most successful

838
00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.689
of these, of course, was Abrahamic monotheism, which is

839
00:55:26.699 --> 00:55:30.560
developed in the sixth century BCE. And, and uh

840
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:34.179
again, it started not as monotheism but as a

841
00:55:34.189 --> 00:55:39.939
polytheistic um f belief system. But um uh at

842
00:55:39.949 --> 00:55:44.679
some 0.1 of the gods uh Yahweh uh was

843
00:55:44.689 --> 00:55:48.889
recognized as a chief God of the pantheon. And

844
00:55:48.899 --> 00:55:51.189
eventually, there was a movement that developed called the

845
00:55:51.199 --> 00:55:56.679
Yahweh Alone movement. Um And that eventually uh um

846
00:55:56.689 --> 00:56:01.169
recognized Yahweh as the only God. And this is

847
00:56:01.219 --> 00:56:05.149
generally represented by a number of important patriarchs such

848
00:56:05.159 --> 00:56:10.479
as Abraham, Noah and Moses. And it took the

849
00:56:10.489 --> 00:56:12.909
form. It first took the form of what we

850
00:56:12.919 --> 00:56:17.030
think of as traditional Judaism. But then um eventually

851
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.909
diversified into all these other branches.

852
00:56:20.989 --> 00:56:24.850
And when it comes to the three big Abrahamic

853
00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:29.500
religions, Judaism, Christian is and Islamism. How do you

854
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:33.709
look at the phylogenetic relationships between them?

855
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:37.760
Well, again, I I see Judaism as a term

856
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:41.520
is commonly understood as the sort of the mother

857
00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:46.429
Abrahamic root that eventually diversified into orthodox Judaism, Christianity,

858
00:56:46.439 --> 00:56:49.810
Islam, and some of the lesser known extinct branches

859
00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:52.459
uh such as the essences and the Ebon nights.

860
00:56:53.219 --> 00:56:57.199
Um Again, diversification is a never ending process.

861
00:56:57.699 --> 00:57:00.570
Uh And so let's focus perhaps a little bit

862
00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:06.340
here on Islam specifically. How did it rise and

863
00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:09.989
how does it relate to other religions?

864
00:57:10.209 --> 00:57:13.590
Well, Islam arose in the seventh century ce um

865
00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:17.600
in the Arabian Peninsula around a prophet named Muhammad.

866
00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:20.780
Um And although it rose as a branch of

867
00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:25.239
Abraham is uh it began as uh one that

868
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:29.919
considered Christianity in orthodox Judaism to have wandered off

869
00:57:29.929 --> 00:57:32.840
the correct path and distorted the original message of

870
00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:37.560
the prophets. Um Its early success was due to

871
00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:41.739
its uh symbiotic relationship once again with uh um

872
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:46.149
uh ruling powers, the medieval Caliphates or the Muslim

873
00:57:46.159 --> 00:57:47.070
empires.

874
00:57:47.209 --> 00:57:50.899
And what is because you, you mentioned some of

875
00:57:50.909 --> 00:57:55.530
the doctrinal core of, for example, when we're talking

876
00:57:55.540 --> 00:58:01.000
about the Eastern religions of Hinduism Buddhism, Taoism, what

877
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:03.810
is the doctrinal core of Islam?

878
00:58:05.139 --> 00:58:08.120
Uh Well, the doctrinal core of Islam is tied

879
00:58:08.129 --> 00:58:11.120
to its sacred book, the Koran uh and its

880
00:58:11.129 --> 00:58:16.600
belief in the, the one God Allah. Um It,

881
00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:21.850
it uh Muhammad is considered the last of 25

882
00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:26.649
prophets listed that begins with Adam and includes Noah

883
00:58:26.659 --> 00:58:31.610
Abraham Moses and even Jesus among others. But it's

884
00:58:31.909 --> 00:58:38.120
um last and ultimate prophet um was Muhammad. Um

885
00:58:38.129 --> 00:58:42.100
It had a, an early history that involved uh

886
00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:45.550
a lot of conflict. Um Some historians have even

887
00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:49.550
called Islam, a warrior religion, but uh this is

888
00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:54.709
generally a non Islamic perspective because all major Abrahamic

889
00:58:54.719 --> 00:59:00.280
religions had these, um uh at times violent um

890
00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:03.030
uh periods of expansion.

891
00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:10.120
Yes. And sometimes I, I mean, nowadays, particularly, sometimes

892
00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:14.629
we hear people claiming that he Islam, particularly, I

893
00:59:14.689 --> 00:59:20.399
is very prone to having a very close relationship

894
00:59:20.675 --> 00:59:26.185
between the state and the church. But that also

895
00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:31.014
happened at least historically with the other major Abrahamic

896
00:59:31.024 --> 00:59:33.895
religions like Christianity and Judaism.

897
00:59:34.044 --> 00:59:35.294
Right? That's true.

898
00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:40.520
A and I in Islam, we hear a lot,

899
00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:45.199
lots of times people talking about the, the Sunni

900
00:59:45.209 --> 00:59:49.080
and the Shia, what are these two different groups?

901
00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:51.250
And what distinguishes them?

902
00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:55.250
Well, um the Shia believe that Islam uh divine

903
00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:59.229
leader must be a blood descendant of Muhammad and

904
00:59:59.239 --> 01:00:03.629
the Sunnis do not. Um This is um this

905
01:00:03.639 --> 01:00:06.510
has led to a lot of serious uh clashes

906
01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:10.310
between the two groups over time. Um The Sunnis

907
01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:14.560
are represent the majority of Muslims and, and they

908
01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:19.830
uh include about 85% of all Muslims. Um It's

909
01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:24.629
um it's an, it's an interesting uh um dynamic

910
01:00:24.639 --> 01:00:27.600
that, that developed there and it goes all the

911
01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:30.850
way back to shortly after Muhammad's death.

912
01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:34.169
So let me then just ask you before we

913
01:00:34.179 --> 01:00:38.750
go on to some more general questions to wrap

914
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.600
up the interview. Let me just, just ask you

915
01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:44.250
a little bit more about Christianity because at a

916
01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:48.580
particular point, there was a sort of a schism

917
01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:53.120
between the East and the West in Christianity. Could

918
01:00:53.129 --> 01:00:55.050
you tell us a little bit about that? I

919
01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.899
mean, what was that schism about? How did it

920
01:00:57.909 --> 01:00:59.959
start and so on?

921
01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:02.020
Well, there have been a number of schisms within

922
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:04.879
Christianity, of course, but there was, uh, there's also

923
01:01:04.889 --> 01:01:10.050
the, um uh uh, a schism between what became

924
01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.750
known as the Roman Catholic church and, and uh

925
01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:17.080
protestantism. I mean, basically, um, part of it was

926
01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:23.600
fueled by, um, say, um what are sometimes referred

927
01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:26.629
to as the bad Popes. But uh basically, there

928
01:01:26.639 --> 01:01:29.510
was a, there was a, a um period in

929
01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:35.250
time when uh Catholicism in Rome was raising money

930
01:01:35.389 --> 01:01:40.199
by selling um indulgences that is you could give

931
01:01:40.209 --> 01:01:43.310
a certain amount of money to the church and

932
01:01:43.679 --> 01:01:46.429
that would uh get, get your soul out of

933
01:01:46.439 --> 01:01:50.399
purgatory all the more quickly. Um I mean, there

934
01:01:50.409 --> 01:01:53.419
were, there were abuses like this that were happening

935
01:01:53.429 --> 01:01:57.169
at, at a larger and larger rate until finally,

936
01:01:57.179 --> 01:02:02.320
um There was this split um uh between um

937
01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:09.800
Protestantism and um uh what again became known as,

938
01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:14.080
as Roman Catholicism. Uh But that was only one

939
01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:19.040
major um uh split of many that would occur

940
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:23.989
over time uh within the uh uh the major

941
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.229
branches of Christianity. A again, Christianity was like all

942
01:02:29.239 --> 01:02:33.649
of the other um religions and that uh there's

943
01:02:33.659 --> 01:02:36.510
no way to stop the diversification over time. And

944
01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:41.790
sometimes that's due to um the springing up of

945
01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.699
just new beliefs. Sometimes it's due to people perceiving

946
01:02:44.709 --> 01:02:48.389
that, that the church is being uh poorly led

947
01:02:48.399 --> 01:02:52.520
by um authoritative figures. They're all different kinds of

948
01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:56.260
reasons for it. But um it, it, it, it

949
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:57.679
just never stops.

950
01:02:58.899 --> 01:03:04.169
And that also includes, for example, when Europeans went

951
01:03:04.179 --> 01:03:08.070
to uh the Americas and elsewhere, but particularly in

952
01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.750
the Americas, they exported uh different forms of Christianity,

953
01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:19.899
Catholicism, protestantism. In the Americas, we nowadays can see

954
01:03:19.909 --> 01:03:24.870
very many different uh Chris Christian denominations, right? That

955
01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:29.889
are the Americas is a very complex situation because

956
01:03:29.899 --> 01:03:37.189
um again, the conquest was so overwhelming that so

957
01:03:37.669 --> 01:03:42.370
much of the actual indigenous belief systems were either

958
01:03:42.379 --> 01:03:45.590
wiped out or modified in such a way that

959
01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.469
they were no longer recognizable. There were many um

960
01:03:49.479 --> 01:03:52.989
sort of hybrid belief systems in the Americas. Now

961
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.110
that you could uh you can go to certain

962
01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.510
regions and see say forms of Christianity, the Chris

963
01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.750
Christianity that were, were uh highly influenced by Mayan

964
01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:08.280
polytheism or you know, you can find these different

965
01:04:08.699 --> 01:04:14.209
um combinations, these really aren't merges uh so much

966
01:04:14.219 --> 01:04:18.659
in a p phylogeny as say uh some you

967
01:04:18.669 --> 01:04:21.270
could look at it as certain Mayan branches that

968
01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:26.139
he developed Christian characteristics and certain Christian branches that

969
01:04:26.149 --> 01:04:30.929
developed uh Mayan characteristics. I mean, ferreting the details

970
01:04:30.939 --> 01:04:34.909
of that out are are gonna be very complicated

971
01:04:34.919 --> 01:04:37.969
jobs for specialists in those areas going forward.

972
01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:43.389
And also another thing that happened particularly with us,

973
01:04:43.399 --> 01:04:48.419
the Portuguese and also the English or the British

974
01:04:48.429 --> 01:04:53.199
was that uh we took uh African slaves to

975
01:04:53.239 --> 01:04:56.060
the Americas. In our case, the Portuguese, it was

976
01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:59.580
to Brazil mainly. And then there were, uh there's

977
01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:03.409
also a sort of hybrid religions that are a

978
01:05:03.419 --> 01:05:08.300
result of some elements of some of those, uh

979
01:05:08.429 --> 01:05:14.500
I, I mean, smaller African religions we merged with,

980
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:19.540
with elements of Christianity and also sometimes merged also

981
01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:23.300
with elements of uh the tribes that lived in

982
01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:24.780
Brazil originally.

983
01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:28.550
Yeah, I mean, uh uh but we, we can't

984
01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.429
underestimate the sheer power of those conquests that they,

985
01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:37.770
they just so overwhelmed uh things in the Americas

986
01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:43.239
that um it, it, it is um it's, it's

987
01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:45.419
interesting to speculate what would happen if it was,

988
01:05:45.429 --> 01:05:48.129
in fact the new world that uh um invaded

989
01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.149
uh the old world and had been successful in

990
01:05:51.159 --> 01:05:54.699
spreading their beliefs there, how different the world would

991
01:05:54.709 --> 01:05:57.260
be today? Mhm

992
01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.010
So toward the end of the book, and now

993
01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:04.399
I'm going to ask a few more general questions.

994
01:06:04.790 --> 01:06:07.159
Toward the end of the book, you talk about

995
01:06:07.169 --> 01:06:11.260
four historical trends in the evolution of religions and

996
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:13.820
I would like for you to explain each of

997
01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:17.270
them. So the first one is all major religions

998
01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:21.840
are historically interrelated at some level. Could you explain

999
01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:22.439
that, please?

1000
01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:26.080
Yeah, I mean, that's, you know, a lot of

1001
01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:33.110
um of uh social sciences, um scientists in history

1002
01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:38.649
of religion studies don't uh look at the broad

1003
01:06:38.659 --> 01:06:42.870
comparison of things because again, it's this broad comparison

1004
01:06:42.879 --> 01:06:47.199
is still slow to permeate into some of these

1005
01:06:47.209 --> 01:06:51.830
studies. Um But uh one of the things that

1006
01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:55.699
uh seemed apparent to me is that if we

1007
01:06:55.709 --> 01:06:58.570
do look broadly, uh we can see that all

1008
01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:04.199
these um religions are historically um inter uh related,

1009
01:07:04.209 --> 01:07:08.100
interconnected at, at some level. Um We just have

1010
01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:11.040
to look at the historical uh records and the

1011
01:07:11.050 --> 01:07:14.020
shared characteristics. Um If we go back far enough

1012
01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:17.669
in time, all these ideologically connect at one level

1013
01:07:17.679 --> 01:07:19.820
or another, I mean, you could, you could look

1014
01:07:19.830 --> 01:07:22.610
at, for example, the belief in a high, just

1015
01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:25.600
the, the most general belief in a higher power

1016
01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:28.949
or some spiritual essence, that's common to almost all

1017
01:07:28.959 --> 01:07:34.510
organized religions. And as religions diversified over time, these

1018
01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:38.300
sub branches developed unique characteristics of their own, such

1019
01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:43.010
as like we discussed Hinduism, Taoism hard polytheism, linear

1020
01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:47.459
monotheism and so many others. Um It's uh it's

1021
01:07:47.469 --> 01:07:50.979
uh it, it's, it's a diversification that if you

1022
01:07:50.989 --> 01:07:55.939
look at it in reverse, it's a consolidation. Mhm

1023
01:07:56.449 --> 01:08:00.629
And the second major historical trend that you refer

1024
01:08:00.639 --> 01:08:06.689
to is the symbiotic development between religions and empires.

1025
01:08:06.699 --> 01:08:07.770
Could you explain that?

1026
01:08:08.629 --> 01:08:12.979
Yeah. Um THE most, if we look back in

1027
01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:16.520
history, uh we can see a correlation that the

1028
01:08:16.529 --> 01:08:20.549
most successful religions today were the ones that align

1029
01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:25.209
themselves early on with rulers of Kingdoms, empires or

1030
01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:30.370
Caliphates. I mean, this symbolic relationship strengthened not only

1031
01:08:30.379 --> 01:08:33.729
the political powers that were using the religion to

1032
01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:38.180
justify themselves, but also the associated religions that were

1033
01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:41.509
now strengthened by these political powers. And you could

1034
01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.819
see this with, say, for example, the traditional Christianity

1035
01:08:45.109 --> 01:08:48.629
with the Roman Empire and the fourth century ce

1036
01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:52.100
or with Islam and the medieval caliphates between the

1037
01:08:52.109 --> 01:08:57.290
7th and 8th century ce um Hinduism uh paired

1038
01:08:57.299 --> 01:09:00.500
up with the GTA Empire between the 4th and

1039
01:09:00.509 --> 01:09:05.600
6th century ce and, and became more powerful and

1040
01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:09.700
uh Buddhism uh with the uh Mayan Empire between

1041
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:13.359
the 4th and 2nd century BCE, I mean, these

1042
01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:18.680
are the four major um uh religions today in

1043
01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:21.759
terms of size and they all teamed up at

1044
01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:25.569
one point in their history or another with major

1045
01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.109
uh political powers.

1046
01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:30.479
Another interesting thing that you point to in the

1047
01:09:30.488 --> 01:09:33.917
book is that the leadership role of women in

1048
01:09:33.929 --> 01:09:38.618
religion has generally declined through history. Could you explain

1049
01:09:38.627 --> 01:09:38.858
that?

1050
01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.649
Yeah, I mean, part of it seems intuitive because

1051
01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:45.640
uh early in human history, you know, it makes

1052
01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:48.479
sense, the uh the success of the clan or

1053
01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:51.799
tribe was totally dependent on women to propagate the

1054
01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:57.600
population of that group and therefore, uh motherhood uh

1055
01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:02.709
was um understandably worshiped. And you can see signs

1056
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.830
of this. Um GOING back at least 40,000 years

1057
01:10:06.839 --> 01:10:12.359
with this abundance of uh carved um uh maternal

1058
01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:16.950
figures as women are um emphasizing the reproductive parts.

1059
01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:22.720
And uh these uh these are relatively um widespread

1060
01:10:22.729 --> 01:10:27.970
in, in the archaeological record. Uh We, we basically

1061
01:10:27.979 --> 01:10:33.609
eventually um spread that out uh into pantheons which

1062
01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.850
were a combination of male gods, but also still

1063
01:10:36.859 --> 01:10:42.649
included powerful mother goddesses and also, um, priestesses that

1064
01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:46.379
were active in, uh, organizing, uh, the worship of

1065
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:50.330
these things. Um, BUT as civilizations grew in size,

1066
01:10:50.339 --> 01:10:54.129
um, and society, uh, males began to dominate, uh,

1067
01:10:54.490 --> 01:11:00.370
as soldiers, hunters and rulers and, uh, this sort

1068
01:11:00.379 --> 01:11:04.810
of change, uh, was also reflected in changing, um,

1069
01:11:04.819 --> 01:11:09.229
organized religions, uh, where males, uh came to dominate

1070
01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:12.629
more and more. Um, YOU know, women at first

1071
01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:18.029
became um um no longer leading figures, the pantheons,

1072
01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:23.899
um they uh eventually um in terms of uh

1073
01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:28.680
even um occupying clerical organizations. So you can look

1074
01:11:28.689 --> 01:11:32.850
today at um uh you know, where um women

1075
01:11:32.859 --> 01:11:36.419
have been excluded from clerical positions of authority. Um

1076
01:11:36.589 --> 01:11:39.180
You know, we have no female Popes or Grand

1077
01:11:39.279 --> 01:11:42.830
atolls, for example, I mean, and, you know, female

1078
01:11:42.839 --> 01:11:45.850
clerics are even rare in most religions today. Um

1079
01:11:46.339 --> 01:11:49.450
It was sort of a trend over time and,

1080
01:11:49.459 --> 01:11:52.259
uh you know, that's where we are today. Um

1081
01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.990
And you can, you can look at the status

1082
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.729
of women also in other religions like um um

1083
01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:04.359
in uh Islamic society, for example, where they sometimes

1084
01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:08.120
have to undergo some relatively harsh conditions. I mean,

1085
01:12:08.529 --> 01:12:11.819
having to um you know, hide their faces in

1086
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:16.160
public and um not being allowed to drive uh

1087
01:12:16.169 --> 01:12:21.359
various various things that, um again, I, I don't

1088
01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:24.560
think that uh in early Islam women, I think

1089
01:12:24.569 --> 01:12:29.220
had a much higher status because um um Uh,

1090
01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:37.560
Muhammad was dependent partly on, on, um, hi, his,

1091
01:12:37.569 --> 01:12:42.080
uh, his wife to actually help his position grow.

1092
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:43.910
Mhm. Over time.

1093
01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:49.419
Right. And then the fourth and final historical trend

1094
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:52.520
you point to is the impact of religions on

1095
01:12:52.529 --> 01:12:56.990
the evolutionary fitness of our species. Could you explain

1096
01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:57.220
that?

1097
01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:01.450
Yeah, I, I think, you know, um, a lot's

1098
01:13:01.459 --> 01:13:05.750
happened in human society, uh, since, uh, humans first

1099
01:13:05.759 --> 01:13:09.399
started to, uh, develop on this planet. I mean,

1100
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:11.709
early on in human history when there are only

1101
01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.120
a couple of 100,000 humans on the planet. Um

1102
01:13:15.729 --> 01:13:20.529
uh The tribalistic aspect of religion, um may have

1103
01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:24.109
been a competitive uh uh advantage for our species.

1104
01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:28.410
Um, YOU know, compu communal societies that developed early

1105
01:13:28.419 --> 01:13:33.720
armies and educational facilities, agriculture and, and other things.

1106
01:13:33.729 --> 01:13:39.009
Uh um THEY, they out competed non communal populations,

1107
01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:41.470
but things have changed quite a bit today now

1108
01:13:41.479 --> 01:13:44.540
with over 8 billion people on the planet and

1109
01:13:44.549 --> 01:13:49.879
uh tribalism, ideological conquest, chauvinism, uh they all basically

1110
01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:54.399
interfere with our ability to deal with many global

1111
01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:55.620
challenges today.

1112
01:13:56.319 --> 01:13:59.439
Mhm. And so let me ask you a little

1113
01:13:59.450 --> 01:14:02.109
bit about the future. Then what do we know

1114
01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:07.120
about the future of religion? Are there any particular

1115
01:14:07.129 --> 01:14:10.140
trends that we are noticing in terms of people,

1116
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:13.729
for example, becoming more or less religious.

1117
01:14:14.029 --> 01:14:17.839
You know, this is, this is one area where

1118
01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:21.229
I'm reluctant to even guess because there's really no

1119
01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.270
way to tell what the future of religion will

1120
01:14:23.279 --> 01:14:27.709
be. I mean, considering recent trends, uh I can,

1121
01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.709
the one prediction I can make is that the

1122
01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.799
diversification of ideologies will continue over time, I mean,

1123
01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:37.660
and what does that mean? Or I think that

1124
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:41.919
means we need to becoming more pluralistic and less

1125
01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:45.839
tribalistic in our thinking about this type of diversity.

1126
01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:49.919
Uh Or we risk fueling our own eventual extinction

1127
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:50.879
as a species.

1128
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:55.419
So do you think that for example, people learning

1129
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:59.270
about things that you write about in your book

1130
01:14:59.279 --> 01:15:02.660
would uh be uh it would be important. I

1131
01:15:02.669 --> 01:15:06.729
mean, having a better and broader historical understanding of

1132
01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:10.609
religions would be important for the survival of our

1133
01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:11.529
species.

1134
01:15:11.839 --> 01:15:14.890
I think so because if nothing else, it would

1135
01:15:14.899 --> 01:15:19.560
help us um more collectively deal with the challenges

1136
01:15:19.569 --> 01:15:23.240
that face us today on the planet. Um And

1137
01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:28.169
uh it also may um decrease the level of

1138
01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:32.660
uh violence that seems to be growing today with

1139
01:15:32.669 --> 01:15:39.229
um uh with uh um or between different societies

1140
01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.919
that are enhanced by these religious differences.

1141
01:15:42.439 --> 01:15:44.959
So let me ask you then just one last

1142
01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:48.270
question. At the beginning of our conversation, we talked

1143
01:15:48.279 --> 01:15:51.879
about the agnostic approach that you have in the

1144
01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:56.839
book. Do you think that by explaining religion and

1145
01:15:56.850 --> 01:16:00.750
religions in the plural and how they evolved over

1146
01:16:00.759 --> 01:16:04.759
time and where they come from their perhaps evolutionary

1147
01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:08.740
and cognitive basis that we are at the same

1148
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:12.600
time explaining religion away in the sense that it

1149
01:16:12.609 --> 01:16:16.459
would sort of commit us to atheism or not.

1150
01:16:17.529 --> 01:16:19.950
No, I don't think that's true at all. Um,

1151
01:16:19.959 --> 01:16:22.970
YOU know, agnosticism again is not the same as

1152
01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:27.790
atheist atheism. I mean, agnosticism is simply an open,

1153
01:16:27.799 --> 01:16:32.060
less biased perspective. I mean, it's the opposite of

1154
01:16:32.069 --> 01:16:36.450
ideological chauvinism. I mean, in a move towards agnosticism

1155
01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:40.310
and broader understanding, uh, is needed today, at least

1156
01:16:40.319 --> 01:16:43.439
by historians because if we're really trying to understand

1157
01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:47.899
deep history, we can't take AAA BI a biased

1158
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:51.100
approach. I mean, it's, it's fine to be guided

1159
01:16:51.109 --> 01:16:54.399
by positive elements of a particular faith, but there's

1160
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:56.819
no way of knowing which particular sub branch is

1161
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:59.729
true or false and using a particular faith to

1162
01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:04.100
justify intolerance and bigotry is not only unethical, it's,

1163
01:17:04.109 --> 01:17:05.979
it's detrimental to our future.

1164
01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:10.020
Mhm. Yes. I, I mean, perhaps the question I

1165
01:17:10.029 --> 01:17:13.029
was asking you was slightly different but, uh, what

1166
01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.859
I was trying to understand here is there are

1167
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:20.209
some atheists that make the claim that if through

1168
01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:23.979
science, we can explain religion where it comes from,

1169
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:29.390
how it evolves, then that would necessarily commit us

1170
01:17:29.399 --> 01:17:33.919
to atheism because we are basically explaining the religious

1171
01:17:33.930 --> 01:17:37.250
beliefs away in a sense. Do you agree with

1172
01:17:37.259 --> 01:17:37.529
that?

1173
01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:42.220
I don't necessarily agree with that. I mean, I

1174
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:47.919
think, uh, a pluralistic attitude is not the same

1175
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:54.959
as an agnostic one because even um uh forced

1176
01:17:54.970 --> 01:18:02.410
or mandatory athe atheism would be not unlike a

1177
01:18:02.419 --> 01:18:09.500
fundamentalist, um, religious belief that was forced again. Uh

1178
01:18:09.509 --> 01:18:13.830
We are humans that are always gonna have a

1179
01:18:13.839 --> 01:18:19.390
diverse set of ideologies about such basic things. Um

1180
01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:21.939
And I think we have to come to grips

1181
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:24.299
with that and figure out how we're going to

1182
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:25.979
deal with that going forward.

1183
01:18:27.419 --> 01:18:30.640
Great. So the book is again, the Evolution of

1184
01:18:30.649 --> 01:18:34.549
Religions, a history of related traditions. I'm leaving a

1185
01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.939
link with in the description of the interview and

1186
01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:40.700
doctor Grande. Apart from the book, would you like

1187
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:43.979
to mention any places on the internet where people

1188
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:45.600
can find your work?

1189
01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:50.169
Well, I mean, I, I suppose you could always

1190
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:58.740
um uh huh go to uh um um Wikipedia,

1191
01:18:58.750 --> 01:19:01.189
you could find me. But I mean, basically, uh

1192
01:19:01.419 --> 01:19:04.729
you know, you can find, you can find books

1193
01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:08.740
I've done on uh University Chicago press site and

1194
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:13.399
um the uh Columbia uh press site. Uh Basically

1195
01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:16.220
II, I would just uh welcome anybody to come

1196
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:20.069
in and, and um check out the um the

1197
01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:24.620
evolution of religion book. Uh BECAUSE again, I'm hoping

1198
01:19:24.629 --> 01:19:28.529
it'll give people a much broader perspective on something

1199
01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:31.350
that does seem to be such an ingrained part

1200
01:19:31.359 --> 01:19:33.049
of uh human culture.

1201
01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:37.910
Yeah. And I recommend the book because uh there

1202
01:19:37.919 --> 01:19:41.089
you also go into much more detail when it

1203
01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:46.109
comes to which specific religion and their phylogenetic relationships.

1204
01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:49.279
So I definitely recommend the book as well. And

1205
01:19:49.290 --> 01:19:51.729
