Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the Center.

1
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.380
I'm your host as always Ricardo

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.079
Loops. And today I'm joined by

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.599
Dr Mia

4
00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:08.029
Massimi.

5
00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:11.649
She is Professor of Philosophy of Science in the

6
00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:14.369
Department of Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh,

7
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.329
affiliated with the Higgs Center for Theoretical Physics.

8
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.194
She works in the area of history and Philosophy

9
00:00:21.204 --> 00:00:24.784
of Science with the focus on the physical sciences.

10
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:28.135
And today we are focusing on her book Perspective

11
00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:33.134
of Realism, which by the way, just recently won the 2023 Lacas

12
00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:35.345
awards. So

13
00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:35.735
Dr

14
00:00:36.145 --> 00:00:36.634
Massimi,

15
00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:39.404
welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

16
00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:41.794
Thank you so much for having me Ricardo

17
00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:42.845
to be here.

18
00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.880
OK. So to get into the book, I would like to start by asking you this.

19
00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:52.779
So what is realism in science?

20
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.970
And by the way, uh when, when I mean, realism is, are there

21
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.319
different kinds of realism or not?

22
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.939
Sure. Yeah. So um

23
00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:12.089
what we call realism in philosophy of science is really um a broad um family of views

24
00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:17.669
um that normally are characterized by um series of commitments

25
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.870
um

26
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.629
that um are distinctive of what we would like to think of a realist position.

27
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.839
Now,

28
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.550
uh what those commitments are obviously um

29
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.779
are fairly well understood, but also change

30
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.540
in a very subtle way depending on

31
00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:40.540
which specific variety of realism one is willing to subscribe to.

32
00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.889
Um So I would say that what defines realism are two main

33
00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:47.250
commitments.

34
00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:51.099
Uh One is the idea that there is uh uh uh uh

35
00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:52.769
some

36
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.319
relationship between science and

37
00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:57.970
um nature

38
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.449
that is usually captured by the notion of truth.

39
00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.970
Um And the other is that there has to be some

40
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.880
kind of representational relation between how science and scientific theory,

41
00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.110
scientific models

42
00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:12.300
relate

43
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.179
to the target system.

44
00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:16.050
So if you ask me,

45
00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:18.899
I would say um realism is defined by

46
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.669
those two broad notions of truth and representation.

47
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.809
Now, obviously, we may disagree about what we mean by truth.

48
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.610
We may disagree slightly about what we mean by

49
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.830
representation, how models represent reality.

50
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.619
Um So, depending on how

51
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.179
different philosophers characterize those notions,

52
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.660
you may get different varieties of realism.

53
00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:45.720
Um So, over really the past uh 40 50 years,

54
00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.059
there has been a proliferation of views that

55
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.860
call themselves or style themselves as realist view.

56
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.259
Um Some of them are um redefining some of those notions of truth.

57
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.619
So you have variety of pragmatic realism or internal realism.

58
00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:06.110
Um Others are rethinking the exact nature

59
00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:10.270
of the relationship between science and nature um

60
00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:12.309
uh in terms of representation.

61
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.830
So you have varieties of selective realism, for example, that

62
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.589
um endorse the presentational commitment,

63
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.039
but they would be selective about which aspects of reality

64
00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.550
the model is committed to represent.

65
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.649
So very broadly, truth and representation are the two key commitments.

66
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.600
Uh And within the broad umbrella, there is a, a

67
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.179
full spectrum of views that may slightly

68
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.149
differ in how they understand those two notions

69
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:45.070
and how those two notions enter into

70
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.869
um our way of thinking about science and, and reality

71
00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:56.660
and related to that, what would an anti realist stance in science entail?

72
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.720
So, um

73
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.289
going back to this idea that, you know,

74
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.990
truth and representations are some of the two key commitments.

75
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.199
Um

76
00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.330
uh anti realist view

77
00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:14.869
views and plural can be characterized by

78
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.850
uh playing down some of those um notions.

79
00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:23.540
So for example, you find the varieties of instrumentalist views,

80
00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:28.089
they are anti realist views because they are not committed to the notion that

81
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.420
um

82
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.929
uh truth is any important element in the way in

83
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.149
which we think about the relation between science and reality.

84
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.450
Um

85
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.769
You get varieties of constructivism

86
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.859
um that likewise

87
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.910
uh would challenge the idea that uh representation really

88
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.440
plays an important role in how models latch onto,

89
00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:53.980
onto the world on the realities.

90
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.250
Um So there's a broad spectrum of views really

91
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.380
going back to um 1980 the scientific image of Basman

92
00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:01.760
Pras.

93
00:05:02.109 --> 00:05:02.410
And

94
00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:07.660
um that has been a landmark book for a constructive empiricism.

95
00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:10.410
Um It's a classic example of an anterial

96
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.519
view where

97
00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:16.839
um the notion of truth is replaced by notion of empirical adequacy, for example.

98
00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:18.309
So according to a

99
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.489
fra

100
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.899
and die of

101
00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:20.899
science is not to deliver

102
00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.820
um

103
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.940
theories, they are approximately true but to deliver theories, they are pi

104
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.059
adequate.

105
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:33.250
Um two more recently varieties of epistemological constructivism.

106
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.989
So, um Mike Boone

107
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.959
um building on the process and defense form a form of constructivism and

108
00:05:41.489 --> 00:05:46.790
um how she conceptualizes the relationship between models and reality.

109
00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:47.829
Um

110
00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:52.890
So this is just an example, but obviously the family is much broader than that.

111
00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:57.959
And what is a scientific perspective?

112
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.519
Um

113
00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:03.339
So it's a great question, what is STV perspective?

114
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.179
So the term um has a bit of an history.

115
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.089
Um The way I've been using it in my book um really has a um a predecessor.

116
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.730
The closest predecessor

117
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.829
is in

118
00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:18.299
Ron's uh book on scientific perspective is

119
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.970
uh the way Ron

120
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.500
Giri originally defined the notion of a scientific perspective was really

121
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:30.619
in analogy uh with Thomas Coon's notion of a disciplinary matrix.

122
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.899
So disciplinary matrix is a um

123
00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:36.700
a slightly more refined notion of uh probably

124
00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:39.739
the more familiar notion of S and TV paradigm

125
00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:41.109
um

126
00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:47.480
in the sense that it indicates uh a family of um practices

127
00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:51.570
and commitments that particular community has at a particular historical time.

128
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.049
The way in which

129
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.690
Rangiri originally defined the Oslo

130
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.769
scientific perspective in, in, in the book

131
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.839
was really in terms of families or models. So Rangiri

132
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.079
was building on a long standing tradition, going back to Patrick Sap

133
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.070
in the 19 sixties onwards,

134
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.559
um

135
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.609
whereby uh we need to think of scientific theories as, as families or models.

136
00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:16.970
Uh starting with high level models,

137
00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:20.760
uh representational models, going all the way down to

138
00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:24.459
um models of the experiment, data model and so forth.

139
00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:29.329
What I do in the book is to slightly move away from

140
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.690
Maroni's definition.

141
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.220
Um Because I would like to think of a scientific

142
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.779
perspective as something broader than just the family of models.

143
00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:39.769
So for me,

144
00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:43.029
a scientific perspective is the historically and

145
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.359
culturally situated practice of particular communities,

146
00:07:46.369 --> 00:07:48.010
a particular historical time.

147
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.869
And I understand really this notion of practice in a very, very broad sense um

148
00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:54.980
um

149
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.760
to include varieties of knowledge that

150
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:04.350
um may not necessarily have well defined formalized modeling practices.

151
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.579
Um

152
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.350
So broadly speaking, a scientific perspective is a,

153
00:08:09.359 --> 00:08:12.540
is a historically situated practice of a community.

154
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.160
And um here I borrow on the literature in epistemology.

155
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.660
Um there's been again, a very important literature on perspective is coming from

156
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.920
epistemology and

157
00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:25.700
Aaron Sosa in particular

158
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.079
knowledge in perspective uh book

159
00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:31.470
uh from which I'm drawing in thinking that really what

160
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.799
SN TV perspective does is not just to um advance

161
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.229
um a series of claims of knowledge,

162
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:44.539
but also provide the um experimental theoretical and

163
00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:49.500
technological tools for reliably making those claims of knowledge

164
00:08:49.849 --> 00:08:52.099
as well as providing um

165
00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:59.460
methodological and epistemic principles that can justify the reliability of um

166
00:09:00.369 --> 00:09:02.760
of our uh uh uh

167
00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.929
uh practices for making those claims of knowledge. So it's kind of a a

168
00:09:07.119 --> 00:09:11.109
three fold distinction between the body of claims of knowledge,

169
00:09:11.489 --> 00:09:15.489
the experimental theoretical conceptual tools to reliably make them

170
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.719
and the methodological epistemic principle that justify the

171
00:09:18.729 --> 00:09:21.500
reliability of those uh of those tools.

172
00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:26.599
And that's the, the, the very broad way in which I've been using the term in the book.

173
00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:30.320
And what about a perspective

174
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:30.489
of

175
00:09:30.719 --> 00:09:37.750
realism? What does it mean exactly? And what flavor of realism applies to it?

176
00:09:38.419 --> 00:09:39.599
So, um

177
00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:41.030
yeah, that's a great question.

178
00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:42.880
Going back to the original question about

179
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.719
varieties of realism and family of realism.

180
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.159
Um

181
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.729
I'd like to think of prospect

182
00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:52.080
our realism as a view that is committed to

183
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:56.320
the notion of truth as correspondence and the idea that

184
00:09:56.969 --> 00:10:02.390
um our theories, our models especially uh represent reality.

185
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.429
So it's a realist view.

186
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:10.479
But the way I present the view in the book is that it, it's not a metaphysics first

187
00:10:10.729 --> 00:10:13.239
uh view about realism. So very often

188
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.760
what you find is that realism is defined by

189
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:23.119
uh metaphysics first approaches. So if someone declared themselves a realist,

190
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.799
what they really mean is that they are committed to

191
00:10:25.809 --> 00:10:30.450
spelling out to what the metaphysical building blocks of nature are

192
00:10:30.859 --> 00:10:32.710
or they are committed to

193
00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:38.070
um tell a story about uh what the metaphysical foundations of reality are.

194
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.669
And the metaphysical story typically involves

195
00:10:40.909 --> 00:10:41.590
um

196
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.969
different flavors of metaphysics.

197
00:10:43.979 --> 00:10:49.020
So some people are committed to natural properties others are committed to

198
00:10:49.539 --> 00:10:49.609
the

199
00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:51.669
there are dispositions

200
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.760
um

201
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.719
or other people believe in causal powers.

202
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.890
Um

203
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:57.679
per

204
00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:57.909
the

205
00:10:58.119 --> 00:10:59.590
realism is not

206
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.669
a metaphysics first approach in the sense

207
00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:04.760
that although there is a metaphysical part,

208
00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.159
uh which is the second part of the book, um the primary aim is really um

209
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.950
trying to uh

210
00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:16.000
uh in a way show how that metaphysical

211
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:20.890
commitment is really downstream to an epistemological project.

212
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.849
So what really matters to me is to

213
00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:26.909
trying to understand how we produce reliable knowledge

214
00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:32.309
over time and how a plurality of historical and cultural situated perspectives

215
00:11:32.719 --> 00:11:33.380
um

216
00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:38.859
are able to uh deliver that reliable knowledge over time.

217
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:43.489
So um I see realism not so much as uh

218
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.700
um an exercise in trying to

219
00:11:46.979 --> 00:11:52.580
uh unveil the metaphysical building block of nature, but I see metaphysics as the

220
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:56.780
downstream outcome of how we tell a story

221
00:11:56.789 --> 00:12:00.099
about how we produce reliable knowledge over time.

222
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.169
So there is a metaphysical part. So ultimately, spec

223
00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:03.309
of

224
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.130
realism is realism about phenomena about modally robust phenomenon.

225
00:12:07.789 --> 00:12:09.309
And that obviously involves

226
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.239
really finding the very notion of phenomena that has a long philosophical history.

227
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.770
And it's, it's, it's part of what they're doing in the second part of the book.

228
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.690
So if you ask me, what kind of flavor is perspective, a

229
00:12:20.859 --> 00:12:24.250
realism, it's really realism about moderate robust phenomena.

230
00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:25.849
Um

231
00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:31.289
But as I said, I see that metaphysical commitment as, as the outcome of

232
00:12:31.619 --> 00:12:32.380
uh um uh a

233
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.150
more important exercise, which is trying to understand how

234
00:12:37.419 --> 00:12:39.890
um different communities over time and

235
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.869
culture produce reliable knowledge over time.

236
00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:48.229
But then where is, where exactly is the perspective,

237
00:12:48.239 --> 00:12:51.330
all nature in scientific representation?

238
00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:53.090
So, yeah,

239
00:12:53.099 --> 00:12:54.919
what that perspective is enters into the

240
00:12:54.929 --> 00:12:57.359
story of how we produce reliable knowledge,

241
00:12:57.369 --> 00:12:57.669
right?

242
00:12:57.679 --> 00:12:58.489
So um

243
00:12:59.109 --> 00:13:01.340
I can think of a plurality of

244
00:13:01.349 --> 00:13:04.520
communities that are historical and cultural situated,

245
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.809
different historical periods, different cultures and so forth.

246
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.260
Can we tell a story about

247
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.500
how that knowledge is produced a across these different communities?

248
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.429
And how is that story going to look like?

249
00:13:18.099 --> 00:13:23.570
Um So one thing I definitely wanted to do in the book is to avoid any

250
00:13:23.809 --> 00:13:27.010
um standard template that you find in the literature

251
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:31.530
on realism about realism of being some kind of convergence

252
00:13:31.869 --> 00:13:36.760
to a reality that um in a way we all agree upon.

253
00:13:37.289 --> 00:13:40.239
Um There is no convergence in perspective of realism.

254
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.119
Um The way I use often this metaphor in the book taken for

255
00:13:44.609 --> 00:13:45.239
um

256
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:46.390
the, the

257
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:46.700
o

258
00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.280
Borges at the Garden of Forking Path, they

259
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:50.760
are

260
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.390
uh producing knowledge is a bit like going through a

261
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.770
garden of forking path and kind of zigzagging where at each

262
00:13:57.969 --> 00:14:02.609
juncture, we have to make a choice about which path we want to go down. So there is no

263
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.440
uh or underlying picture, the realism is a convergence to

264
00:14:06.849 --> 00:14:09.280
because really it's a realism about phenomena,

265
00:14:09.289 --> 00:14:13.739
there's no realism about any fundamental metaphysical reality, as I said,

266
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.320
the cause of powers, dispositional essence is that we want to call it.

267
00:14:18.159 --> 00:14:18.679
Um

268
00:14:18.919 --> 00:14:21.450
So those phenomena are encountered by different

269
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.500
communities across different periods and across different cultures

270
00:14:25.859 --> 00:14:29.250
um in a reliable way or in a way that we are able to

271
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:34.700
uh uh to see how their situated practices intersect with one another.

272
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.739
So this is where the perspective that comes in, right? Because traditionally,

273
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.140
um

274
00:14:40.549 --> 00:14:45.539
the very idea that the starting point of conversations about realism

275
00:14:45.929 --> 00:14:46.500
um

276
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:48.869
is, is, is,

277
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:54.119
is is human beings in their plurality and historically and cultural situated, this

278
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:59.510
has appeared to be a stumbling block to any realist project.

279
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.239
How could one ever possibly defend realism, especially about science?

280
00:15:04.909 --> 00:15:07.200
Once we take really seriously that

281
00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:12.359
there is a plurality of um historically situated communities and their culture.

282
00:15:13.409 --> 00:15:17.950
So that was the starting point of my um kind of journey uh for the book.

283
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.059
Um I went back to the notion of representation.

284
00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.440
I said at the beginning through the representations are

285
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.390
the two key commitment of any realist view.

286
00:15:27.119 --> 00:15:31.150
And I wanted to understand what makes some representations pers

287
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.590
respectable and whether there is a way of

288
00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:37.820
reconciling the perspective of representation with realism.

289
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.830
Um So at the very beginning of the book,

290
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.190
I go back to the analogy between art and science

291
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.599
and that has been well explored since the time of,

292
00:15:47.609 --> 00:15:50.049
well, it's a long story, long tradition really.

293
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:51.739
Uh but more recently, Basra

294
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.859
and 2008 book on a scientific representation,

295
00:15:55.869 --> 00:15:58.640
paradoxes of perspectives has been a very influential

296
00:15:58.929 --> 00:16:01.799
uh book for uh for my own personal journey,

297
00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.169
but also Kathrine Elgin uh 2017 book.

298
00:16:06.179 --> 00:16:07.609
Uh True Enough,

299
00:16:07.619 --> 00:16:09.619
uh is also very important for

300
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.780
discussing the perspective nature of representation.

301
00:16:13.299 --> 00:16:16.150
And so really thinking about the analogy between art and science,

302
00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:18.299
what makes some representation perspect?

303
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.020
Traditionally, we tend to think of that uh

304
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.770
question in terms of

305
00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.599
the representation is

306
00:16:25.789 --> 00:16:29.200
situated is from a particular vantage point.

307
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:33.770
So um a drawing, a perspective drawing is what makes the drawing perspective

308
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.750
is that the scene is painted

309
00:16:35.989 --> 00:16:37.869
from a particular angle.

310
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:39.929
And obviously,

311
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.979
the angle means that there are other aspects of the scene

312
00:16:43.989 --> 00:16:46.960
that we can't really see uh from that particular angle.

313
00:16:46.969 --> 00:16:48.469
So there is an element of lusion

314
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.640
and there is what Vansen

315
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:51.849
called

316
00:16:52.099 --> 00:16:54.369
um a horizon of alternatives.

317
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.809
We could have chosen to represent the scene

318
00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.570
from different angles and we could have chosen to

319
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.010
represent the object with different attributes.

320
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:04.689
Um

321
00:17:06.708 --> 00:17:09.229
So the story I turn in chapter two and three of the book,

322
00:17:09.239 --> 00:17:12.188
which is really the beginning of the of the book is

323
00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:17.009
that very often that specific way of thinking about perspective of representation

324
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.709
um has been um

325
00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:27.239
regarded as a as a, as a difficulty for any realism or a realist project.

326
00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:28.489
Um

327
00:17:28.859 --> 00:17:33.058
Precisely because if the representation is situated is from a particular angle,

328
00:17:33.068 --> 00:17:36.058
how can we ever be in a position of saying what the

329
00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:41.458
real nature of the object is, our knowledge is always partially occluded and,

330
00:17:41.818 --> 00:17:43.418
and, and, and not complete.

331
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.060
Um So the story I tell is that, well, actually, if you look at the

332
00:17:48.239 --> 00:17:50.560
nature of perspective and drawing in art,

333
00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:53.260
um there are two ways of thinking about perspective,

334
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.660
um a representation is perspective,

335
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.439
not only because it's drawn from a particular angle, but because it's also

336
00:17:59.689 --> 00:18:03.280
drawn towards one or more vantage point.

337
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.550
Actually, technically, this is the definition of a

338
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.640
perspect

339
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.760
uh representation that

340
00:18:08.959 --> 00:18:10.520
um there is one or more

341
00:18:10.829 --> 00:18:14.050
vantage point towards which lines converge.

342
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.030
And that's what creates the optical illusion that you can see a

343
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.880
three dimensional space on what effectively is a two dimensional canvas.

344
00:18:21.839 --> 00:18:22.280
Um

345
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.280
And, and so I play with that metaphor in art to say, well, really,

346
00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:29.020
those are two aspects of the same coin really, you know,

347
00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.880
you the representation is perspect

348
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.630
as drawn from a particular vantage point only

349
00:18:33.869 --> 00:18:38.530
in so far as there is one or more vantage points that allows us to create this,

350
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.849
this these windows of reality,

351
00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:45.869
uh this, this three dimensional space emerging out of a two dimensional canvas.

352
00:18:46.339 --> 00:18:49.459
And so that's my entry point for the idea that there is a way of

353
00:18:49.819 --> 00:18:51.760
telling a story about realism

354
00:18:51.989 --> 00:18:54.959
starting with the situated nature of the representation.

355
00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.079
So tell us now about the notion of pluralism.

356
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.069
Where is it and how does it apply to science?

357
00:19:05.319 --> 00:19:09.199
Yeah. So pluralism is really uh again, a big family

358
00:19:09.319 --> 00:19:10.329
of views.

359
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:16.050
Uh I'm drawing really here on a long standing tradition that has emphasized

360
00:19:16.449 --> 00:19:19.239
the importance of pluralism in science.

361
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:23.569
Um explanatory pluralism and methodological pluralism

362
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.609
uh tradition. Going back to Ellen Longino

363
00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:27.530
and

364
00:19:27.969 --> 00:19:32.930
uh Carol, a fair and Miriam Solomon and Sandra Mitchell, integrity, pluralism.

365
00:19:32.939 --> 00:19:34.680
Obviously, John Dupre promiscuous

366
00:19:34.949 --> 00:19:37.849
realism and many, many, many others.

367
00:19:38.329 --> 00:19:40.420
Um the kind of pluralism

368
00:19:40.589 --> 00:19:41.290
um

369
00:19:41.609 --> 00:19:46.479
that matters to my story is again, perspect about pluralism is pluralism of

370
00:19:46.939 --> 00:19:48.890
perspectives as I have defined it.

371
00:19:49.619 --> 00:19:51.839
Uh So my emphasis is not so much

372
00:19:51.849 --> 00:19:56.010
on um explanatory methodological or ontological pluralism.

373
00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.550
It's really pluralism about

374
00:19:58.459 --> 00:20:00.369
uh uh historically, cult

375
00:20:00.609 --> 00:20:06.170
is the practices. It's, it's a fact that science is the outcome of this plurality of

376
00:20:06.709 --> 00:20:11.400
perspectives and communities that have endorsed different practices.

377
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:12.719
Um

378
00:20:13.329 --> 00:20:15.969
And then obviously, then the question becomes OK.

379
00:20:15.979 --> 00:20:20.599
Um As I was just saying with the problem of perspective or representation is pers

380
00:20:21.229 --> 00:20:24.229
sorry, representation from a point of view, representation

381
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.880
uh uh towards one or more vantage point,

382
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:33.170
the question is OK, if you take the pluralism as a fact about science,

383
00:20:34.189 --> 00:20:36.819
what kind of uh realism

384
00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:41.359
emerges out of that, can we even talk about realism

385
00:20:41.579 --> 00:20:43.500
or should we just say that we are

386
00:20:43.949 --> 00:20:44.640
um

387
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.969
confined to a plurality of um ways of knowing

388
00:20:49.979 --> 00:20:53.290
they are distinctive of different communities and their practices?

389
00:20:53.939 --> 00:20:54.599
Um

390
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.319
But we can't really attempt to tell a story about

391
00:20:59.119 --> 00:21:01.180
science and scientific knowledge and,

392
00:21:01.439 --> 00:21:03.079
and realism about science

393
00:21:03.319 --> 00:21:07.040
and the best that we can do is this plurality of scientific practices.

394
00:21:07.339 --> 00:21:09.060
So, what I do in the book is to say, no, no, no.

395
00:21:09.069 --> 00:21:15.770
We, we can take the pluralism, perspect of pluralism as a starting point.

396
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.050
It's a fact about science. The science is produced in that way.

397
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.130
But that doesn't mean that we need to end up

398
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.790
with some kind of instrumentalist or anti realist view.

399
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.020
There's still a way of defending realism in science.

400
00:21:29.949 --> 00:21:30.689
Um

401
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.739
starting with perspect about pluralism.

402
00:21:34.489 --> 00:21:35.000
Mhm

403
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.750
And so another thing that you tackle in

404
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.229
your book is the problem of inconsistent model.

405
00:21:42.239 --> 00:21:48.109
So what is that problem really about and can perspective is help us tackle it?

406
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:54.119
Yeah. So kind of zooming into uh this problem of how to reconcile

407
00:21:54.489 --> 00:21:59.530
um Perspect about pluralism as pluralism of perspectives and, and realism.

408
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.520
The problem in consistent models uh is,

409
00:22:02.969 --> 00:22:07.650
is, is one of, is one of the major problem for any perspective is

410
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:08.510
um

411
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:13.439
because this is where we the pluralism um

412
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:19.170
appears to be somehow at odds with any realist claim.

413
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:24.390
Um So it's a problem that was really brought to the general attention um

414
00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.130
maybe 13 years ago uh roughly

415
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:33.109
uh by uh Mary Morrison um in a, in a beautiful paper where

416
00:22:33.349 --> 00:22:37.829
she discusses the plurality of models in some areas of science. So she says,

417
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.229
well, look at nuclear physics, right?

418
00:22:40.239 --> 00:22:43.349
Um So the areas of science where there is one model,

419
00:22:43.359 --> 00:22:46.300
we all agree more or less that uh you know, it is the

420
00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.300
um best model to describe some kind of phenomena.

421
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.819
But there are other areas where there seems to be a pluralism,

422
00:22:52.829 --> 00:22:57.050
a kind of endemic pluralism and as, as pluralism of models.

423
00:22:57.369 --> 00:22:59.180
So the example of Morrison is that

424
00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.280
if you look at nuclear physics,

425
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.560
and if you ask the question about what is the atomic nucleus,

426
00:23:05.369 --> 00:23:06.270
um

427
00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.170
you find different answers to the question depending

428
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.579
on whether we are studying a nuclear fission.

429
00:23:12.589 --> 00:23:16.310
In which case, we represent the nucleus as if it was a liquid

430
00:23:16.609 --> 00:23:18.770
of incompressible nuclear fluid.

431
00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:23.229
Uh But if we are studying um stellar nucleus synthesis,

432
00:23:23.239 --> 00:23:25.290
we use different families of models,

433
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.359
the cluster model whereby the atomic nucleus is represented as a

434
00:23:29.689 --> 00:23:30.260
tetrahedron

435
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.780
with a particular structures of problems and neutrons.

436
00:23:34.449 --> 00:23:38.630
And obviously, if we're studying other phenomena in high energy physics,

437
00:23:39.079 --> 00:23:41.290
we use yet another class of models.

438
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:46.699
We use the quark models to describe what happens when we smash protons to say at LHC.

439
00:23:47.339 --> 00:23:51.449
So Morrison Point was, well, if we have this pluralism of models,

440
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.479
does it even make sense to ask

441
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.800
what is the atomic nucleus? I mean, w where is the realism there? Right? I mean,

442
00:23:58.969 --> 00:24:01.489
we have different stories about what the nucleus is.

443
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:07.449
Um is there one which is the best one? And if, if there is, then what about the others?

444
00:24:07.459 --> 00:24:10.540
Isn't it better to adopt some kind of instrumental is

445
00:24:11.979 --> 00:24:12.760
um

446
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:14.420
perspective is,

447
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:21.239
has often been accused of being a form of instrumental is so um Morrison

448
00:24:21.869 --> 00:24:25.079
uh argument in that paper that has also been

449
00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.959
rested by other philosophers like

450
00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:28.280
an

451
00:24:28.459 --> 00:24:28.560
Chakravorti,

452
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.280
for example, in

453
00:24:30.579 --> 00:24:31.650
um in, in, in, in,

454
00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.180
in his book on um the the kind of

455
00:24:35.189 --> 00:24:38.660
metaphysics of nature is that very often perspective is,

456
00:24:38.719 --> 00:24:42.449
doesn't live up to the promise of realism because it looks like

457
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.219
uh what we really mean by perspective is is the

458
00:24:46.229 --> 00:24:50.000
representation is drawn from a particular point of view.

459
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:55.329
So if you look at the nucleus from the point of view of um fission, then it looks like a

460
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.229
liquid drop. But if you look at the nucleus from the point of view of stellar

461
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.150
nucleus synthesis, then it looks like a tetrad.

462
00:25:02.609 --> 00:25:07.060
And I think it's that way of thinking about perspective is that has really um

463
00:25:07.719 --> 00:25:10.890
meant that perspective is for a long time as has

464
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.310
been regarded as kind of no much for realism.

465
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.540
Um So I tackled the problem of inconsistent models in chapter three of the book.

466
00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.180
And um

467
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.719
I show that the problem is not really a problem for perspective

468
00:25:24.329 --> 00:25:28.410
is in so far as we are clear about um some

469
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.250
hidden assumptions that seems to be creeping into the argument.

470
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:32.920
And so some of those

471
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:34.130
assumptions are

472
00:25:34.609 --> 00:25:37.489
uh in my view are, are really um

473
00:25:37.729 --> 00:25:41.489
kind of very demanding and unduly stringent

474
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.410
realist assumption that

475
00:25:43.589 --> 00:25:48.069
seems to assume that models represent by mapping 1 to 1

476
00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:50.979
aspects of the model with aspects of the target system.

477
00:25:51.589 --> 00:25:53.930
And that seems to understand the notion

478
00:25:53.939 --> 00:25:56.650
of truth going back to representation of truth

479
00:25:57.209 --> 00:25:59.579
in terms of uh truth maker.

480
00:25:59.589 --> 00:26:02.050
So there has to be a ontological state of

481
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.849
affairs in terms of ascription of essential properties to particular

482
00:26:06.359 --> 00:26:08.930
that make some claims of knowledge true.

483
00:26:09.439 --> 00:26:11.969
And now if one endorses that view about truth,

484
00:26:11.979 --> 00:26:15.060
the truth makers and representation as mapping,

485
00:26:15.359 --> 00:26:21.160
I think Morrison has a point that this plurality of model seems to be a problem for,

486
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.099
for realism,

487
00:26:22.339 --> 00:26:23.790
we can't think of the nucleus as

488
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.770
having inconsistent or incompatible essential properties.

489
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.780
Um

490
00:26:29.349 --> 00:26:32.380
But what I do in chapter three of the book is to resist

491
00:26:32.689 --> 00:26:34.579
that assumption and saying,

492
00:26:35.089 --> 00:26:35.150
uh why,

493
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.900
why do we need to buy into representation as mapping or

494
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.800
what do we need to buy into truth as truth maker?

495
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.949
Maybe there is a different way of thinking about

496
00:26:44.109 --> 00:26:48.000
what models do and how they represent from a perspective

497
00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:52.270
or point of view that doesn't necessarily land us into this

498
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:53.760
um uh quo

499
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:59.060
of inconsistent essential properties ascribed to the same target system.

500
00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:02.219
And so it's a very important problem because it's really um

501
00:27:02.229 --> 00:27:08.239
the starting point of a way of reconciling realism or perspective is

502
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.869
and uh related to perspective

503
00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.959
modeling and perspective of models. Um

504
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:23.300
What do you mean by them being blueprints on reality as you say in the book?

505
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:26.219
And uh perhaps related to these,

506
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:32.339
how do the concepts of conceivability and possibility enter into it.

507
00:27:33.369 --> 00:27:34.339
Yeah. So

508
00:27:36.199 --> 00:27:41.280
um what I do from chapter four or five onwards is to spell out the positive story,

509
00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:41.619
right?

510
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:42.319
And not just to say,

511
00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.969
we need to resist all this assumption and duly stringent assumption. So

512
00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.329
um a different way of thinking about what models do

513
00:27:49.339 --> 00:27:52.819
is to tell a different story about how to represent

514
00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:57.560
their target system without ascribing essential properties to the target system.

515
00:27:58.319 --> 00:27:59.829
So in that context that develop the

516
00:27:59.839 --> 00:28:03.050
view that models really are inferential blueprints,

517
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.719
so they are blueprints that allows different communities.

518
00:28:06.729 --> 00:28:08.760
And again, think of a plurality

519
00:28:08.989 --> 00:28:13.800
of historical and cultural situated communities to draw inferences

520
00:28:14.229 --> 00:28:20.079
about relevant model, robust phenomena from a plurality of data set.

521
00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.599
So what the model does is not so much

522
00:28:23.939 --> 00:28:29.319
mapping 1 to 1 aspects of the model and aspects of reality. I think we have been

523
00:28:29.449 --> 00:28:33.569
very often in philosophy, science, we have this picture that models represent.

524
00:28:33.579 --> 00:28:34.310
But as if

525
00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.390
really the primary function of the model was to

526
00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.459
mirror a map onto the target system, right?

527
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.739
But that idea seems very counterintuitive to me even I mean,

528
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:48.380
think of well established model like the DN model of the nucleus, right.

529
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:49.069
I mean, we don't,

530
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:54.709
we don't use the model because we want to necessarily represent the nucleus,

531
00:28:54.719 --> 00:28:58.689
we use the model because we want to make inferences right about the

532
00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:02.380
that we want to study, we want to understand how DNA behaves,

533
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:03.930
we want to understand how

534
00:29:04.329 --> 00:29:09.109
uh possible error in the um in the in the process of DNA

535
00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:10.520
uh

536
00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:10.839
uh

537
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.420
chain of events may happen.

538
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:14.130
So we,

539
00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:18.130
we want to ask those questions about what is possible

540
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.459
about DNA replication and mistakes in the DNA replication.

541
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:28.500
So think of models really as catering to this needs of allowing us to make

542
00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:33.670
uh uh relevant and appropriate inferences about phenomena that we want to study.

543
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.859
So that's what the metaphor of inferential blueprint is.

544
00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.619
So models yes, do represent and do represent from a specific vantage point.

545
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.699
That's why we have a plurality of models used by different communities.

546
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:49.380
The primary function is not to ascribe essential properties to the target system.

547
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.699
As the metaphysicians would like us to think of

548
00:29:51.969 --> 00:29:56.500
the primary function is to allow communities to make reliable, robust,

549
00:29:57.099 --> 00:30:01.060
relevant and appropriate inferences about those uh uh those phenomena that, that,

550
00:30:01.069 --> 00:30:02.400
that we want to study.

551
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:07.660
And so again, I use the analogy very often as I do in the book between um

552
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.030
uh uh uh perspective

553
00:30:10.199 --> 00:30:12.329
of representation in this case in architecture.

554
00:30:12.339 --> 00:30:15.040
So the idea of the inferential blueprints is borrowed from,

555
00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:19.189
from architecture because again, in, in, in, in architecture, you can have uh

556
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.150
um a plurality of perspective

557
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:26.119
or representation of say a house that allows different communities of the

558
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:30.520
carpenter and the masons and the architects to work together and

559
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:36.790
make inferences about how the house should be built. How tall should the roof be?

560
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.979
What's the relationship between the height of the

561
00:30:39.219 --> 00:30:41.000
door and the height of the roof.

562
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.640
Uh And so I use an analogy to say likewise,

563
00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.239
whenever we want to study specific phenomenon,

564
00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.859
that plurality of models allows these different communities to make those

565
00:30:52.239 --> 00:30:54.900
uh uh relevant and appropriate inferences about the

566
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.219
objects so that we want to study.

567
00:30:57.989 --> 00:31:02.760
Um So they find in models as really catering to um

568
00:31:03.119 --> 00:31:05.479
the need of delivering knowledge about what

569
00:31:05.489 --> 00:31:08.250
is possible about the object under study.

570
00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.339
So, perspect

571
00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:14.050
modeling is modeling possibilities, modeling, how things could be.

572
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:15.439
Um

573
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:16.260
And it's,

574
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.319
it's a way of answering those questions in

575
00:31:18.329 --> 00:31:20.979
a kind of very exploratory way where we have

576
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.180
not just one community that can reclaim full

577
00:31:24.189 --> 00:31:26.839
ownership of the knowledge of the target system,

578
00:31:26.849 --> 00:31:29.750
but we need a plurality of communities

579
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.849
that I illustrate with various case studies in the book.

580
00:31:32.859 --> 00:31:35.410
So I have one chapter on climate change.

581
00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.180
So climate modeling in the context of studying um

582
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.500
uh global warming, one chapter on

583
00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.020
developmental psychology

584
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:48.660
and one chapter on the nuclear physics where I show how in each case

585
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.140
to study specific phenomena like the stability

586
00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:53.650
of some nuclear or difficulties with reading

587
00:31:53.969 --> 00:31:54.589
or

588
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.760
global warming.

589
00:31:56.939 --> 00:31:59.199
We need a plurality of community.

590
00:31:59.209 --> 00:32:02.579
So if you want to study climate change and global warming,

591
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:10.520
you need a plurality of people that model um increase in ocean heat temperature

592
00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:15.050
uh communities that model how glacier and permafrost

593
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.290
are changing under the effect of greenhouse gasses.

594
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.939
Communities that study corals and uh uh

595
00:32:21.069 --> 00:32:22.750
tree rings. So then

596
00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:23.520
thema

597
00:32:23.839 --> 00:32:27.560
again to make inferences from those data to the phenomena under study.

598
00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:32.229
And so it's through that plurality of modeling practices and,

599
00:32:32.239 --> 00:32:34.479
and communities that we come to know

600
00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:37.880
very complex and multifactorial phenomena like

601
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:38.770
um

602
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.089
global warming, for example.

603
00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:43.479
So that that's how I use the analogy with

604
00:32:43.489 --> 00:32:46.589
models as inferential blueprint to explain our models.

605
00:32:46.599 --> 00:32:49.020
Yes, represent, yes, represent from a perspect

606
00:32:49.219 --> 00:32:50.050
point of view.

607
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.760
But they do so by effectively delivering knowledge about what

608
00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.930
is possible concerning the object that we want to study.

609
00:32:57.969 --> 00:33:02.089
So earlier in our conversation, you alluded to this.

610
00:33:02.099 --> 00:33:09.750
Uh But what are they, what are phenomena and what is the relationship between them

611
00:33:09.949 --> 00:33:14.189
through this framework of perspective of realism?

612
00:33:15.489 --> 00:33:18.709
Yeah. So um going back to uh

613
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.880
exactly the question of what flavor of realism is basically our realism,

614
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:25.910
as I mentioned in the beginning, it's really a realism about phenomena.

615
00:33:26.369 --> 00:33:32.030
But I, one of the main task of the book was to redefine what I mean by phenomenon.

616
00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.540
This phenomena come from a

617
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.680
long standing empi

618
00:33:36.079 --> 00:33:38.910
traditions that really stretches back to,

619
00:33:39.949 --> 00:33:42.369
you know, pm 19 05, a

620
00:33:42.719 --> 00:33:45.760
wonderful book on to save the phenomenon more recently, wasn't to

621
00:33:45.869 --> 00:33:45.979
Pras

622
00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.920
and I mentioned already in 1980 scientific image.

623
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.280
Um that also defends the view that um you know,

624
00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:56.569
the reality is reality made of phenomena observable phenomena according to Tora.

625
00:33:57.829 --> 00:33:58.589
Um

626
00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.949
So it's very difficult to say that I'm a realist

627
00:34:00.959 --> 00:34:05.719
about phenomena when the very term phenomenon has been associated

628
00:34:05.859 --> 00:34:08.708
with uh a long standing and pis

629
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.199
tradition that is normally regarded phenomena is

630
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:16.030
not the sort of objects that one would have real

631
00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:17.350
and commitment to.

632
00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:18.820
Um

633
00:34:19.208 --> 00:34:22.879
So what I do in the second part of the book is trying to um

634
00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.159
articulate the positive story

635
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.250
and the positive story is that

636
00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:28.958
um given this perspect

637
00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.168
of pluralism,

638
00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:35.949
uh where models are embedded as part of the practices of different communities,

639
00:34:36.478 --> 00:34:40.899
the inferences that we make are inferences to what I call

640
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:44.560
moly robust phenomena. So what are moly robust phenomena?

641
00:34:44.958 --> 00:34:46.030
They're not the phenomena of the

642
00:34:46.208 --> 00:34:46.300
fro

643
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:47.649
and they're not the phenomenal of Pierre

644
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.810
do m they're not the phenomena of

645
00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:50.219
the Empire

646
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.100
tradition as

647
00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:57.110
um faint copies or faint images of a

648
00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:58.760
reality

649
00:34:58.959 --> 00:35:03.820
uh that lies underneath the phenomenon that we need to discover uh you know,

650
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.199
appealing to the metaphysician tools or

651
00:35:06.209 --> 00:35:09.659
whatever dispositional essences or because of powers

652
00:35:10.379 --> 00:35:13.770
uh phenomena of what there is in a way I'm

653
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.979
um borrowing from the country and tradition,

654
00:35:16.989 --> 00:35:20.270
the idea that knowledge is knowledge of phenomena, but those phenomena not

655
00:35:20.379 --> 00:35:21.629
in pieces, phenomena more

656
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:22.580
robust.

657
00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.270
And what I really mean by more of robustness

658
00:35:25.969 --> 00:35:26.530
is that

659
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.669
phenomena stable event.

660
00:35:28.679 --> 00:35:34.699
So there's a kind of 22 tier ontology that I articulate in chapter six of the book.

661
00:35:34.709 --> 00:35:38.159
So phenomena are stable event index to a particular domain

662
00:35:38.679 --> 00:35:42.659
and they are modally robust across a plurality of

663
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.820
data to phenomena inferences.

664
00:35:45.739 --> 00:35:48.489
So there are stable events in that, that there is a

665
00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.879
level of reality that are called stable event where

666
00:35:51.889 --> 00:35:56.580
stability is really synonymous with low likeness for me.

667
00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:57.040
So

668
00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:01.909
um stable events are events that are such not because they are core ones,

669
00:36:01.919 --> 00:36:05.000
but because there are low like dependencies in

670
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:09.320
in the fabric of those events. So that explain why they are stable.

671
00:36:10.439 --> 00:36:15.370
But the phenomenon is not just a stable event. Uh The phenomenon

672
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.750
is the outcome of an inference made by

673
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:23.580
communities from data understood broadly as empirical occurrences.

674
00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.639
So to give an example that I um given the book,

675
00:36:27.929 --> 00:36:28.500
um

676
00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:35.219
it is a stable event that an electric charge is gonna be affected by

677
00:36:35.439 --> 00:36:37.510
an electric or magnetic field.

678
00:36:37.719 --> 00:36:41.629
So there are low like dependencies that explains how an electric

679
00:36:41.639 --> 00:36:45.000
charge is going to be deflected by an external field,

680
00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:46.669
that's a stable event in nature.

681
00:36:47.719 --> 00:36:48.379
But

682
00:36:48.889 --> 00:36:50.550
what we called um cathode

683
00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:51.080
ray

684
00:36:51.189 --> 00:36:53.800
or the phenomenon of the bending of cathode

685
00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:58.580
rays is the model robust phenomenon that uh was discovered by

686
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.949
JJ Thompson at the end of the 19th century using a a

687
00:37:03.129 --> 00:37:04.340
particular

688
00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.250
tool that was a cato

689
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.090
tube working in a particular historically

690
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:09.560
cap

691
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:13.899
situated context. There was the Victorian Cambridge of the end of the century.

692
00:37:14.389 --> 00:37:15.020
Um

693
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:16.929
And, and so

694
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:21.389
the phenomenon is not a robust because we can infer and

695
00:37:21.959 --> 00:37:22.379
Reiner

696
00:37:23.149 --> 00:37:23.629
um

697
00:37:24.469 --> 00:37:27.860
the same phenomenon from different kind of data

698
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:31.969
sets by slightly tweaking the experimental conditions.

699
00:37:32.229 --> 00:37:33.550
Uh And and so forth.

700
00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.760
So the model of robustness is some kind

701
00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:38.120
of secondary property that is really a property

702
00:37:38.129 --> 00:37:41.340
of how different communities are able to robustly

703
00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:44.270
infer the same phenomenon from a variety of,

704
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.290
of data.

705
00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:50.449
So that's broadly speaking, the kind of phenomena for so

706
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:53.409
that I I defend in, in the book

707
00:37:54.580 --> 00:38:02.620
and with that in mind, what are natural kinds and how do we go from phenomena to kinds?

708
00:38:04.209 --> 00:38:05.629
So yeah, Um

709
00:38:07.879 --> 00:38:08.080
so,

710
00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:10.419
one of the problem I had when I was writing the book

711
00:38:10.429 --> 00:38:14.560
is that I was obviously committed to defending this phenomenon for so,

712
00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.439
but I was also

713
00:38:17.689 --> 00:38:20.760
very much aware that when it comes to realism,

714
00:38:20.969 --> 00:38:24.540
um it's not enough to say that we live in a world where there are moli

715
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.149
robust phenomena, the bending of the cat

716
00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:27.879
race,

717
00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.000
the decay of the Higgs boson,

718
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.100
the growth of the

719
00:38:31.879 --> 00:38:34.780
mycelium echolocation in Beluga. Those are examples of what I call moli

720
00:38:35.209 --> 00:38:38.179
robust phenomena, the pollination of flowers and so forth that

721
00:38:38.419 --> 00:38:42.919
require inferences on behalf of communities to stable events in nature.

722
00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:48.060
A realist wants uh something more than phenomena.

723
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:53.800
A realist want something about natural kinds. So a realist would say,

724
00:38:54.169 --> 00:38:54.879
um

725
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.550
I don't just want to know what the bending of cadore

726
00:38:57.979 --> 00:39:00.919
is. I want to know what the electron is. I want to know what the nucleus is.

727
00:39:00.929 --> 00:39:02.820
I want to know what genes are.

728
00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:07.790
I want to know, you know um what lemon and zebras and supernovas. Are

729
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.959
so those are natural kinds.

730
00:39:10.409 --> 00:39:11.810
So those are

731
00:39:12.439 --> 00:39:14.320
uh kinds of things.

732
00:39:14.629 --> 00:39:19.570
And um again, realism very often has been associated with um

733
00:39:19.919 --> 00:39:23.419
number of views about what national kinds are. Um

734
00:39:23.729 --> 00:39:25.669
ranging from hacking. And no,

735
00:39:26.439 --> 00:39:30.110
to I mentioned already, John Dupre promiscuous realism to

736
00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:35.179
varieties of uh uh um microstructure and essentialism back to Hillary

737
00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.560
Patnam in the 19 seventies and so forth.

738
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:42.879
Um So the story I tell in the book about natural kinds, which really a long one,

739
00:39:42.889 --> 00:39:45.949
it stands from chapter seven to chapter 10 in the book

740
00:39:46.219 --> 00:39:50.030
is that natural kinds are open ended

741
00:39:50.239 --> 00:39:53.179
grouping of historically identified phenomena.

742
00:39:53.409 --> 00:39:55.899
There is nothing more, nothing over

743
00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:01.060
uh natural kinds than open ended grouping of historical identified phenomena.

744
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.810
And obviously, the big challenge is OK, is this just a form of conventional, is

745
00:40:06.429 --> 00:40:10.360
a natural kind, just the label that we attach to grouping of phenomena.

746
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.830
So I had to go into um quite a lot

747
00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.090
of details to clarify why the view is not a conventional

748
00:40:17.209 --> 00:40:19.560
view. And it's not an essentialist view either.

749
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.739
Um But it's really a view that tries to

750
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:26.439
again bring in the inferential is so phenomena,

751
00:40:26.449 --> 00:40:32.080
the outcome of inferences likewise natural kinds are the outcome of inferences.

752
00:40:32.489 --> 00:40:33.060
Um Rob

753
00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:35.800
robust, reliable, still revis

754
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:37.439
still open ended,

755
00:40:37.449 --> 00:40:42.469
still very valuable inferences made by plurality of communities over time.

756
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.459
Um And so I'll give a full definition,

757
00:40:45.469 --> 00:40:49.659
I give a full inferential story uh about national kind.

758
00:40:50.419 --> 00:40:52.840
They are called natural kinds with the human face.

759
00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.979
Borrowing from Hillary but

760
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:57.959
1990 book realism with a human face.

761
00:40:58.449 --> 00:41:01.030
Um What I explain how those law

762
00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:06.600
like dependencies in the fabric of the stable events provide effectively the

763
00:41:06.959 --> 00:41:07.679
um

764
00:41:07.919 --> 00:41:13.909
I I if you like the the kind of pointers in this walking in the garden of working path

765
00:41:14.469 --> 00:41:17.600
in whereby communities can make

766
00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.560
uh choices about

767
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.350
what to cluster or what not to cluster into the natural kind.

768
00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.120
But to do so reliably, they need to rely on

769
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:27.550
low

770
00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:30.659
like dependencies. They are part of the stable events in nature.

771
00:41:30.669 --> 00:41:33.479
So the clustering is not arbitrary, it is not conventional.

772
00:41:33.909 --> 00:41:35.820
And so there is an element of contingencies,

773
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.040
but it's not a rampant kind of contingentism.

774
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.760
It's, it's kind of constrained and guided by

775
00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:42.969
um low

776
00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:44.679
like dependencies in nature.

777
00:41:45.639 --> 00:41:46.699
So it's a long story

778
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.639
from chapter seven to chapter 10. And I give a

779
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:52.020
full detail of that in, in, in,

780
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:54.439
in chapter 10 of the book where I delve

781
00:41:54.449 --> 00:41:56.969
into the historical case studies about the electron.

782
00:41:57.850 --> 00:41:57.909
And

783
00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:58.860
yeah, sorry.

784
00:41:59.479 --> 00:42:00.959
No, no, no worries.

785
00:42:00.989 --> 00:42:05.419
Uh And another thing I would like to ask you is at a certain point in the book,

786
00:42:05.429 --> 00:42:08.179
you talk about contingentism.

787
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:13.939
So what is contingentism and how is it involved in perspective of

788
00:42:14.229 --> 00:42:15.060
realism?

789
00:42:15.879 --> 00:42:16.389
So continent

790
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.810
is, is associated precisely with

791
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.620
um

792
00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:25.550
with this point I was making about how the um open ended grouping of phenomena

793
00:42:25.949 --> 00:42:26.629
um

794
00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:30.500
is to some extent contingent in the sense that we

795
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:35.350
could have cluster different phenomena under the National Kind Electron,

796
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.260
for example,

797
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:37.929
um now continent,

798
00:42:37.939 --> 00:42:41.989
this historically has been a very powerful uh argument

799
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.030
coming from the history of science against a very strong

800
00:42:46.439 --> 00:42:48.489
um the physical form of realism.

801
00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:49.939
Um

802
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.560
um So,

803
00:42:51.679 --> 00:42:55.399
I don't know lots of people that contributed to this debate from has

804
00:42:55.699 --> 00:42:56.209
Chang to cons

805
00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:56.949
for them.

806
00:42:57.159 --> 00:42:58.659
Also Joseph Laporte.

807
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.239
Um so things could have gone otherwise, right?

808
00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.550
So Joseph Laporte, in his book on Natural Con and con

809
00:43:05.689 --> 00:43:08.570
change, tell us it is a beautiful story of how,

810
00:43:08.979 --> 00:43:12.340
you know, we made a choice at some point to include the dirty

811
00:43:12.739 --> 00:43:14.000
oxide into

812
00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.060
um the natural kind water.

813
00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:19.929
But there was a choice in a way that we made, we could have,

814
00:43:19.939 --> 00:43:21.090
we could have gone otherwise.

815
00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.050
So that's the element of contingentism.

816
00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:28.350
Uh I define a particular brand of contingentism in the sense that um

817
00:43:29.379 --> 00:43:34.659
um um I'm not that kind of full blown contingent is in the sense that

818
00:43:34.669 --> 00:43:39.649
I don't think that things could have gone entirely in a completely different way.

819
00:43:40.219 --> 00:43:44.250
Uh Precisely because um the way I think a phenomena

820
00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:49.000
as a stable event where stability is synonymous with low likeness

821
00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:55.280
means that the inferences that communities make about what phenomena goes with.

822
00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:56.719
What other phenomena

823
00:43:57.209 --> 00:43:59.110
are not fully at our

824
00:43:59.239 --> 00:44:00.290
discretion,

825
00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.610
are not fully at our women in a way we need

826
00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:06.179
to respond to the Tribunal of Nature as a speaker,

827
00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:06.600
I find.

828
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:09.290
So um There are a lot like dependencies

829
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.739
that really guides those inferences that we make.

830
00:44:13.439 --> 00:44:15.260
Um So, uh

831
00:44:15.969 --> 00:44:19.300
uh and uh and so I tell a story about how um

832
00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.459
every natural kind is a kind in the making.

833
00:44:23.949 --> 00:44:29.209
Uh some of those in the making kind become empty at some point when we discovered that

834
00:44:29.659 --> 00:44:32.340
maybe there's some violation of fundamental laws.

835
00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:35.840
Uh So we believed in caloric, for example, back in the 19th century,

836
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:40.000
people believed that there was a substance called caloric that was responsible for

837
00:44:40.129 --> 00:44:44.879
transitional state from ice to say water to, to steam.

838
00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:49.250
Um But some of the uh inferences that people made

839
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.919
about what are the phenomena that are captured by the Nashua

840
00:44:53.209 --> 00:44:53.629
Khan Caloric

841
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:59.310
uh were clearly inferences that very soon revealed their limits.

842
00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:02.070
So um reveal their limits because

843
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:05.889
very often they were appealing to um features

844
00:45:05.899 --> 00:45:09.000
of the phenomena that were simply false.

845
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.570
So, Sadiq

846
00:45:09.739 --> 00:45:11.010
Karno was one of the

847
00:45:11.699 --> 00:45:12.520
um

848
00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:14.090
key people in the

849
00:45:14.479 --> 00:45:15.889
uh formulation of the KO

850
00:45:16.229 --> 00:45:17.300
principles and the car

851
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:18.530
cycle. So Ko

852
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:20.139
believed in caloric

853
00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:23.500
back in the first half of the 19th century.

854
00:45:23.899 --> 00:45:25.919
And he believed that there was a substance that

855
00:45:25.929 --> 00:45:30.770
was uh uh physically conserved whenever a hot reservoir

856
00:45:30.889 --> 00:45:36.179
goes into cold reservoir. And then a new cycle starts behind like a steam engine.

857
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.739
Uh but obviously, there is no conserve calor

858
00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:42.060
and there is no conservation of caloric and there

859
00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:44.320
is no perpetual motion machine and in fact,

860
00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:46.639
can be created using that principle.

861
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:50.600
So this is where we face the tribunal of experience where we can't say

862
00:45:50.919 --> 00:45:52.689
we could have had

863
00:45:52.879 --> 00:45:55.669
now in 2023 an Act

864
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.020
kind caloric

865
00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.959
still alive.

866
00:45:58.969 --> 00:46:01.020
And well, no, we couldn't have had that right,

867
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:05.469
because we soon stumbled into some problems about

868
00:46:05.489 --> 00:46:08.250
some of those very phenomena that were identified,

869
00:46:08.435 --> 00:46:10.584
identified as the phenomenon where caloric was,

870
00:46:10.814 --> 00:46:11.854
was at work.

871
00:46:12.014 --> 00:46:13.534
And uh and the fact that there was no

872
00:46:13.544 --> 00:46:16.195
conservation of caloric and if anything there was dissipation,

873
00:46:16.205 --> 00:46:19.014
which was then captured by the concept of entropy and so forth

874
00:46:19.155 --> 00:46:21.324
revealed the limits of those associations.

875
00:46:21.334 --> 00:46:25.594
So, so kind of long winded answer to your question, the contingentism means

876
00:46:26.844 --> 00:46:29.895
that although things could have gone otherwise in how communities

877
00:46:29.905 --> 00:46:33.695
came to make inferences about phenomenon connection between phenomena,

878
00:46:34.225 --> 00:46:36.774
things could not have gone entirely

879
00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:41.810
in a completely different ways because in a way, there are those constraints

880
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.000
concerning low

881
00:46:43.129 --> 00:46:45.399
like dependencies of the phenomena that

882
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:52.659
uh really act as pointers in the garden of working path about which inferences

883
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.250
we decide to

884
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:58.770
go down to and which inferences we decide to abandon at some point.

885
00:46:59.689 --> 00:47:00.560
-- I
-- understand.

886
00:47:00.899 --> 00:47:04.090
So getting into the last part of our interview,

887
00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:08.350
could you tell us now about multiculturalism and cosmo

888
00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:11.040
cosmopolitanism? Science? I mean,

889
00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:16.120
uh is science a multicultural and cosmopolitan enterprise?

890
00:47:16.129 --> 00:47:21.219
And what role do these two things? Multiculturalism and cosmopolitan,

891
00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:24.120
cosmopolitanism play in science?

892
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:29.229
Yeah. No, thank you. So this is the final chapter of the book and it's um

893
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:30.600
um

894
00:47:31.429 --> 00:47:34.610
I wanted to write that chapter because um

895
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:34.780
I,

896
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:36.159
I thought the book was going to be

897
00:47:36.169 --> 00:47:40.209
complete without a final discussion about what really

898
00:47:40.639 --> 00:47:43.479
um questions about realism and perspective

899
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:44.070
iss

900
00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:44.620
uh

901
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:47.389
are doing in, in this context.

902
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.879
Um So very often in the debate on realism,

903
00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.540
philosophers have appealed to the aims of science.

904
00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:57.449
So it seems that, you know, we care about discussion about realism and the

905
00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:58.419
realism and

906
00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.379
truth and representation because

907
00:48:00.949 --> 00:48:02.370
we want to

908
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.739
fundamentally um

909
00:48:04.989 --> 00:48:06.739
answer questions about

910
00:48:06.959 --> 00:48:10.169
what is the goal of science and what is the aim?

911
00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.659
Um

912
00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:14.899
And I thought that

913
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:17.800
perspective of realism was not really

914
00:48:18.149 --> 00:48:21.939
answering that question about what the aim of goal of science is.

915
00:48:22.729 --> 00:48:26.340
Uh what perspective of realism does is to um

916
00:48:26.709 --> 00:48:29.659
offer a different lens for thinking about

917
00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:35.820
realism in science, starting with this plurality of situated communities.

918
00:48:37.989 --> 00:48:40.060
And once you take that step,

919
00:48:40.649 --> 00:48:44.050
the next step is to think of questions about

920
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:49.159
duties and obligations in science and rights in science. So no questions,

921
00:48:49.379 --> 00:48:51.350
aims and goals. But actually

922
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:55.840
what is science for who produces science?

923
00:48:55.850 --> 00:49:00.629
Who has to benefit from science, who can reclaim as their own

924
00:49:00.969 --> 00:49:04.149
a right to benefit from scientific knowledge.

925
00:49:04.439 --> 00:49:04.719
So the

926
00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:09.110
first chapter in a way, try to answer those, those questions which are kind of more

927
00:49:09.479 --> 00:49:10.070
um

928
00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:14.739
ethical political questions about duties and obligations in science. So,

929
00:49:15.139 --> 00:49:20.310
multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism are again huge terms with a very long

930
00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:24.600
and often difficult and vexed history that I wanted to use to

931
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.580
um exactly explain

932
00:49:28.969 --> 00:49:29.669
they, they called the

933
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:30.100
natural

934
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.610
perspective of realism.

935
00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:32.070
Though it's,

936
00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.870
there's a perspective of pluralism that like there's multiculturalism,

937
00:49:35.879 --> 00:49:37.310
there's this plurality of

938
00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:41.080
historically situated communities that over

939
00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.860
time produce reliable knowledge about more

940
00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:45.199
robust phenomena.

941
00:49:47.409 --> 00:49:50.260
But also an invitation of not thinking about

942
00:49:50.719 --> 00:49:54.010
that situated nature of knowledge as some kind of

943
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:57.530
silo where knowledge is produced by community

944
00:49:57.989 --> 00:50:00.620
in isolation from other communities. Or

945
00:50:00.909 --> 00:50:04.600
you know, this is the um kind of picture that we had again from, you know,

946
00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:05.600
the the tradition of

947
00:50:05.729 --> 00:50:05.739
a

948
00:50:05.909 --> 00:50:06.239
Thomas K

949
00:50:06.439 --> 00:50:09.510
on scientific paradigms where there is incommensurability.

950
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.909
Um There's a period of crisis and scientific revolution.

951
00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:14.070
Uh And I,

952
00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:17.139
I wanted to offer a different story where it was

953
00:50:17.149 --> 00:50:20.850
really an invitation of not to think of scientific perspectives as

954
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.439
siloed.

955
00:50:22.679 --> 00:50:26.239
Uh but to think of those communities and their

956
00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:29.729
interaction in terms of what I call intersecting and interlacing

957
00:50:30.209 --> 00:50:31.739
scientific perspectives,

958
00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:33.860
perspectives that over time,

959
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:38.199
not only methodological intersect to allow us to make more

960
00:50:38.209 --> 00:50:41.399
reliable inferences about the phenomenon that we want to study.

961
00:50:41.969 --> 00:50:46.790
But also over time, historically interlace like the um

962
00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:48.979
like in a fabric,

963
00:50:48.989 --> 00:50:50.179
like in a piece of cloth where you

964
00:50:50.189 --> 00:50:53.310
have the different threads that are historically interlaced

965
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:58.899
uh to produce knowledge that effectively is knowledge that we can reclaim as, as,

966
00:50:58.909 --> 00:51:00.239
as knowledge that belong

967
00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:02.379
to all of us. And obviously

968
00:51:02.899 --> 00:51:08.189
that open up also the question questions about when is the interlacing virtues?

969
00:51:08.199 --> 00:51:12.479
When is the interlacing going badly wrong? Because there are exploitative

970
00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:17.360
practices or epistemic injustices in the way in which some communities

971
00:51:17.469 --> 00:51:23.000
appropriate other communities types of knowledge. So whose knowledge is it?

972
00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:24.080
Who, who can be

973
00:51:24.429 --> 00:51:29.570
uh uh uh attributed authorship of particular uh knowledge claims?

974
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:33.600
So those are all very big questions that I try to simply really

975
00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:37.149
map out in the final chapter and I hope to get back to.

976
00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:40.179
But the idea is that starting with

977
00:51:40.189 --> 00:51:43.300
this perspective of pluralism and multiculturalism,

978
00:51:43.939 --> 00:51:48.919
we can articulate a picture about scientific knowledge as reliable knowledge

979
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.909
uh that has to address important epistemic injustice about

980
00:51:52.919 --> 00:51:56.060
what I call the severing and trademarking of knowledge.

981
00:51:56.659 --> 00:51:57.919
And at the same time,

982
00:51:57.929 --> 00:52:04.280
has to result in a broader picture of how knowledge is really knowledge produced

983
00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:10.979
by uh uh by humankind for humankind. So that no one should be excluded from

984
00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:12.189
benefiting

985
00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:15.909
from it and benefiting from the advances of scientific knowledge.

986
00:52:16.199 --> 00:52:19.310
So it kind of branches out into debates about the

987
00:52:19.739 --> 00:52:22.949
uh right to science as a uh as a right

988
00:52:22.959 --> 00:52:26.350
that is enshrined in the UN Declaration of Human rights.

989
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.310
So everyone

990
00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:28.229
is

991
00:52:28.659 --> 00:52:33.909
uh should benefit from um scientific progress and scientific advancement,

992
00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:36.629
but it's obviously not what happens in practice.

993
00:52:36.639 --> 00:52:38.830
The scientific knowledge continues to be privatized,

994
00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.709
continues to be in the hands of um

995
00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.229
few wealthy countries.

996
00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:46.959
So um as I said it as a final chapter that um I

997
00:52:46.969 --> 00:52:51.090
hope to get back to in terms of my present and future work.

998
00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:53.000
But it kind of shows the broader

999
00:52:53.189 --> 00:52:53.860
um

1000
00:52:54.669 --> 00:52:55.320
um

1001
00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:56.209
kind of social

1002
00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:59.280
political dimensions in which discussions about pluralism

1003
00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:01.649
and perspective is and realism play out.

1004
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.969
And so my final question for today will be,

1005
00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:12.629
is science really about producing objective knowledge

1006
00:53:12.639 --> 00:53:16.580
or knowing what objective reality is?

1007
00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:23.699
Yes, is the answer in so far as we are clear about what we mean by objective reality,

1008
00:53:23.709 --> 00:53:24.090
right?

1009
00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:24.600
So

1010
00:53:24.719 --> 00:53:28.939
uh if objective reality means that there is one way

1011
00:53:28.949 --> 00:53:32.419
and one way only to uh carving natural disjoint,

1012
00:53:32.429 --> 00:53:35.020
I mean, that's not what perspective of realism

1013
00:53:35.409 --> 00:53:36.830
would subscribe to.

1014
00:53:37.129 --> 00:53:42.439
Uh but by objective reality, we mean that there is a world of stable events,

1015
00:53:42.969 --> 00:53:43.800
Koli events

1016
00:53:44.209 --> 00:53:49.560
uh to which our uh multifarious inferential practices have to respond.

1017
00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:51.530
That's, that's objective enough.

1018
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:53.330
And so, yes, scientific knowledge,

1019
00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:57.110
knowledge of objective reality within the bounds of

1020
00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:58.590
uh the

1021
00:53:59.129 --> 00:54:01.030
historical and cultural situated

1022
00:54:01.399 --> 00:54:02.629
practices

1023
00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:06.790
that we have, we don't have any God's eye view, we don't have any view from nowhere.

1024
00:54:07.179 --> 00:54:09.770
But that doesn't mean that what we have is just um a

1025
00:54:10.149 --> 00:54:13.030
fragmented landscape of isolated

1026
00:54:13.209 --> 00:54:16.360
communities. What we have is a fairly remarkable

1027
00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:20.320
uh knowledge produced over time by different communities.

1028
00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:21.520
And I think it's something that

1029
00:54:21.979 --> 00:54:24.949
uh I wanted to celebrate in, in, in the book.

1030
00:54:24.959 --> 00:54:28.979
And uh as I said, it kind of opens up broader questions about

1031
00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:32.820
um who produces knowledge and who should benefit from knowledge that

1032
00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:36.760
is entangled in my mind with these questions about objective reality.

1033
00:54:37.439 --> 00:54:37.949
Mhm.

1034
00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:39.080
Great.

1035
00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:43.860
So uh I'm leaving a link to the book in the description box of the interview,

1036
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:45.350
which is again, perspective of

1037
00:54:45.459 --> 00:54:46.750
realism.

1038
00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.419
Uh Doctor Massimi, just before we go,

1039
00:54:49.429 --> 00:54:54.050
would you like to tell people where they can find you and your work on the internet?

1040
00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:58.929
Um So I have my website which is www dot
