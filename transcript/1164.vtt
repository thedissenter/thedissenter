00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:03.369
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:06.409
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes, and

3
00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:09.689
today I'm joined by Dr. Rafael Nunez. He's a

4
00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.859
professor of cognitive science at the University of California

5
00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.860
San Diego. He investigates cognition from the perspective of

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.799
the embodied mind, and today we're going to talk

7
00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:24.799
about embodied cognition, time and space, and numerical cognition

8
00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:28.100
and mathematics. So Dr. Nunez, welcome to the show.

9
00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:29.459
It's a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.000
Thank you. Thanks for the invitation.

11
00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:35.560
So let me start by asking you then, what

12
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.060
is embodied cognition and in what ways does it

13
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.279
differ from other approaches in the cognitive sciences?

14
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.979
Well, embodied cognition is a, is a large umbrella

15
00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:55.169
term that captures, I would say, many different, um,

16
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.240
approaches. Um, THEY'RE not homogeneous, I would say, uh,

17
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.349
but they're all share like uh some kind of

18
00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:06.989
interest in, um, that came out more late, more

19
00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:11.879
or less in the 1980s, 1990s. Um, AS a

20
00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:15.279
way of, uh, answering to a dissatisfaction, which was

21
00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:20.120
like a, a purely digital sort of, uh, information

22
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.989
processing view of the mind. And incorporating, you know,

23
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.519
features that concerns, you know, the body, the anatomy,

24
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.709
uh, anchored in the physiological constraints of our, not

25
00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:39.150
just our human, but animality in general. And this

26
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.790
can, you know, took different forms. Some of them

27
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.989
had to do with anatomy. Other things had to

28
00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:48.620
do more with bodily experience, more phenomenological, and so

29
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.550
on. So I wouldn't say it's just one coherent

30
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.709
view, but it's like a, you know, like a

31
00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:58.389
large response sort of uh for this more purely

32
00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:02.709
abstract formal, uh, formally driven approaches to analyze the

33
00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.739
mind. So that's would be my, my short, you

34
00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:08.350
know, characterization of embodied cognition. So that, you know,

35
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.190
depends on who you ask. Some people may be

36
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.389
doing, um, You know, uh, work in robotics, for

37
00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:21.309
example, exploring embodied cognition, uh, but then they wouldn't

38
00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:25.750
necessarily deal with the question of phenomenology and bodily

39
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.750
experience, but other people will be doing that in

40
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.460
which, you know, the materiality of, uh, of the

41
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.869
agent is maybe less important and so on and

42
00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.070
so forth. So, uh, there would, you would have

43
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.630
many different views under this big umbrella.

44
00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.190
Right, but what does it mean for the mind

45
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.949
to be embodied, because you know, many times when

46
00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:50.610
people think about the mind, they tend to associate

47
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.149
it with just the brain itself, but what does

48
00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:56.149
it mean for it to be embodied?

49
00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.160
Well, again, so, um, on the one hand, if

50
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.279
you just look at neuroscience, if, you know, there's

51
00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:07.100
a tendency sometimes to reduce everything to the brain,

52
00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:09.839
and, but, you know, the brain doesn't exist in

53
00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:12.809
thin air, so the brain is part of a,

54
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.279
uh, you know, a larger nervous system, and the

55
00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:20.080
larger system exists within the body with physiological, you

56
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.520
know, uh, constraints and, and metabolism and many other

57
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.279
things that relate to also. Uh, BODY morphology and

58
00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:31.850
anatomy. So, um, in that case, you know, you,

59
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.929
there's an, an approach I would say in neuroscience,

60
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.949
you could say that, well, not to reduce everything

61
00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.289
to the brain, but, you know, the brain in

62
00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:43.169
the context of, of, of bodies. And then, of

63
00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.830
course, you can go larger, right? Bodies don't exist

64
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.330
separate, they exist, especially in, in social animals. They

65
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.970
coexist with others and the, the ontogeny of individuals

66
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.289
when they grow up during lifetime, they are, you

67
00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:01.169
know, fed and protected and carried and so on

68
00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.240
by other bodies. So, all those things, um, uh,

69
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.330
in that case, embodied, embodied mind would be uh

70
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.160
analyzing. Um, INFANT, mother-infant interaction in, let's say primates

71
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.079
and all those things could be addressed or, um,

72
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.320
you know, studied through this angle, uh, and so

73
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.239
on and so forth. And then, of course, uh,

74
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.299
Another approaches of, let's say the mind being uh

75
00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:30.799
like an abstract entity that has, you know, formal

76
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.220
laws for reasoning and, and deduction systems and so

77
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.660
on, uh, well, an embodied, an embodied approach to

78
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.790
analyzing this would be, well, let's take into consideration

79
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.980
the, the bodily constraints and that shape the forms

80
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.040
of reasoning and abstraction and so on. Um, SO

81
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.720
that, that would be kind of like the, the

82
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.279
way of dealing, uh, a shortcomings coming from the

83
00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.959
purely abstract, let's say, characterization of the mind as

84
00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:03.760
like logical reasoning step by step, or, or, and

85
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.119
so on.

86
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.940
Right, and of course we're going to get into

87
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.170
some some examples of this when in a bit

88
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.730
we talk about time and space and how we

89
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.760
process them cognitively, numbers and mathematics and numerical cognition,

90
00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:24.690
but which aspects of human cognition can we understand

91
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.809
through a framework of embodied cognition?

92
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.309
Well, I would say. Um, IT would be a

93
00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:37.390
question about, uh, reductionism in a way. So, in

94
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.910
science, there is a, you know, there's always a

95
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.920
necessity in which you need to. Go through a

96
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.119
step of um productionistic step to analyze a particular

97
00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:53.600
object, whether it's uh global warming or uh COVID-19

98
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.320
epidemics or, you know, cognitive activity. At some point

99
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.720
in order to do an experiment or study, you

100
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.160
have to operationalize. Your variables and, and your factors

101
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.980
that you want to consider, um, so, you know,

102
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.049
even when you do, I don't know, the study

103
00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:13.609
of unemployment in a society, you have to define

104
00:06:13.609 --> 00:06:17.209
unemployment and probably your definition is not going to

105
00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:21.130
capture all the richness of unemployment and you have

106
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.899
to define it. Is it Is it occurring, you

107
00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:26.299
know, during a period of one day or one

108
00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:29.399
week or all those things. So, the, the question

109
00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:34.920
of um operationalizing different aspects uh of, of cognition

110
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.459
um necessarily lead to this step. So the question

111
00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:43.239
here now is how much you're willing to reduce,

112
00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:46.779
you know, in this reductionistic step. And I would

113
00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:49.059
say in the 70s, or, you know, with the

114
00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:54.230
advent of the Uh, original forms of artificial intelligence,

115
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:56.630
not the ones we know today through LLMs and

116
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.540
so on. Um, THERE was a big step in

117
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.309
reducing to getting rid of all the biology, all

118
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:07.269
the social aspects of cognition, and reduce it to

119
00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:11.820
like a pure, I would say, abstract form, uh,

120
00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:15.260
characterized in those years, like, for example, chess playing.

121
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.709
So you have a very well delimited. Space in

122
00:07:19.709 --> 00:07:23.709
which things are happening with the specific units that

123
00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:27.070
move according to certain rules and then the reasoning

124
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.230
behind would be in principle captured by just this

125
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.510
move and these formal properties. So, then of course

126
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.309
we, we learned that human mind doesn't work that

127
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:42.910
way, incorporates multifaceted forms uh that are important to

128
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:48.160
consider and therefore the over-reductionistic step. Was reduced or,

129
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.720
or what was, let's say, lifted and went to

130
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.399
a less reductionistic step and so on, including these

131
00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:57.839
other things. In the case of language, for example,

132
00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:02.209
one interesting approach has been the Um, consideration of

133
00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:04.929
gesture production, like what's happening with my hands right

134
00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:07.410
now, in which, uh, you know, all of a

135
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:12.209
sudden, uh, we can understand much more about linguistic

136
00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:18.799
meaning, linguistic communication, psycholinguistic aspects, uh, cognition in general,

137
00:08:18.929 --> 00:08:25.359
learning, etc. um, AND through the, uh, more encompassing,

138
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.589
richer approach to the study of language and mind.

139
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.960
By considering, for example, the motor action co-produced with

140
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.400
speech, which is gesture production. So, that's a way

141
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.200
of including sort of embodied aspects that have been

142
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.479
left out by focusing exclusively on, on, let's say

143
00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:47.150
grammar and syntax, for example. So, in each area,

144
00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:51.280
you would find similar tendencies in which things become

145
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.400
more complicated, but less reductionistic, and one role there

146
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.650
is played by incorporating the bodily features of, of,

147
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.539
of the mind.

148
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.940
So let me ask you now about time and

149
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.059
space and how we process them cognitively. So is

150
00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:13.270
there any cognitive relationship between time and space?

151
00:09:14.489 --> 00:09:17.979
Um, YES, there is. Uh, SO, um, so one

152
00:09:17.979 --> 00:09:21.909
way of analyzing this is, for example, through, uh,

153
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.789
Expressions, linguistic expressions. So how is it that humans

154
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:34.369
um communicate and interact. Um, WHEN they talk about

155
00:09:34.369 --> 00:09:39.630
or think about space or time. And, um, interestingly,

156
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.510
uh, when you look at details of how linguistic

157
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:50.830
expressions, um, are constructed and, uh, construed, um, you

158
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:56.400
would realize that often. Very much, very often, uh,

159
00:09:56.419 --> 00:10:00.380
and rather universally with details that we can talk

160
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.799
about if you want, but that, um, spatial features.

161
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.780
Of the human, human cognition, um, like front and

162
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.419
back and up and down and, and so on

163
00:10:13.419 --> 00:10:15.619
and so forth. So all these spatial relations that

164
00:10:15.619 --> 00:10:21.340
we conceive are recruited to anchor, um, more abstract

165
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.179
forms, in this case, temporal notions like tomorrow, the,

166
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.830
the, you know, next winter, uh, and so on

167
00:10:28.859 --> 00:10:31.859
and so forth. So, if you analyze those in

168
00:10:31.859 --> 00:10:34.880
more detail, you will realize there's, they're not random.

169
00:10:35.549 --> 00:10:40.010
They're, uh, organized according to certain patterns. And, uh,

170
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.750
just to give you an example, in English, um,

171
00:10:43.229 --> 00:10:46.309
you know, the words, let's say you could, and

172
00:10:46.309 --> 00:10:49.460
this is not just purely linguistics actually, not purely,

173
00:10:49.469 --> 00:10:54.109
um, uh, lexical with words. So, I could maybe,

174
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.830
you know, talk to you and say, oh, when

175
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.640
I was a kid, I had a bicycle, uh,

176
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.989
a red bicycle, but maybe when I say I

177
00:11:01.989 --> 00:11:04.250
was a kid, I may be pointing behind me.

178
00:11:04.979 --> 00:11:09.210
And that pointing is abstract in the sense that

179
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.950
right behind me physically, there is a white board

180
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:15.869
there with stuff written on, um, or, you know,

181
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.250
I may also be saying, well, from here now

182
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.789
or this person has all the future in front

183
00:11:20.789 --> 00:11:23.950
of her and may point to the front of

184
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.630
me characterizing that person and so on. So all

185
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.190
of a sudden when you start to look at

186
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:33.520
those, you see very specific, um. Patterns. In this

187
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.559
case of this example would be uh the recruitment

188
00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:41.479
of an egocentric um front and back based on

189
00:11:41.479 --> 00:11:46.250
my persona, my as a speaker, uh, which front

190
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.000
is conceived somehow as being all those times that

191
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.559
have not occurred yet that we call future, um,

192
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.159
things that are behind me are those times that

193
00:11:56.159 --> 00:12:01.390
have been, you know, considered. Events that already occurred

194
00:12:01.719 --> 00:12:05.229
and uh usually all the pointings for now, today,

195
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.039
this year, and so on, they usually go straight

196
00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:11.320
down to the co-location of the speaker. So that

197
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.239
would be 11 example that is very, you know,

198
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.700
you can study it in many languages and with

199
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:22.469
there's variations, but uh in which Spatial notions are

200
00:12:22.469 --> 00:12:27.780
recruited to anchor on time and temporal relations. Are

201
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.049
there some, sorry, just to add one, so some

202
00:12:31.049 --> 00:12:35.010
people analyze that through the term metaphor, so they're

203
00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.489
metaphorical expressions, uh, but if you analyze, as I

204
00:12:38.489 --> 00:12:41.849
was giving you the example, it is, it's more

205
00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:44.809
about what is called, uh, conceptual metaphor. It's not

206
00:12:44.809 --> 00:12:49.179
just the metaphorical word. Sometimes the gesture production will

207
00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:52.020
be telling you not the word, but it's the

208
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.419
entire linguistic unit uh in which you conceive through

209
00:12:55.419 --> 00:13:00.020
gesture, cope gesture production, uh, these notions of space

210
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:00.659
and time.

211
00:13:02.179 --> 00:13:07.140
Are there cross cultural differences in how people construe

212
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:07.539
time?

213
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.409
Uh, YES, they are, and we, we've been studying

214
00:13:11.409 --> 00:13:13.919
that for a number of years. Um, FOR example,

215
00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:16.380
the, the, the, the example I just gave you,

216
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.760
um, you know, it's pretty widespread, uh, in which

217
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.280
events that have not occurred, so future are conceived

218
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.080
as being in front of the speaker and past

219
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.979
as being behind the speaker, but in other cultures,

220
00:13:29.989 --> 00:13:32.840
it's not necessarily the same, the, the same case.

221
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.070
One, study we did long ago, like, you know,

222
00:13:36.109 --> 00:13:38.250
a couple of decades ago, we, we were showing

223
00:13:38.789 --> 00:13:42.349
with analysis, linguistic analysis, but also gesture production that

224
00:13:42.349 --> 00:13:44.750
for example, the, the Aymara speakers in the, in

225
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.719
the Andes, um, is actually have a reverse pattern

226
00:13:48.719 --> 00:13:52.340
that we normally have, which is to have, uh,

227
00:13:52.349 --> 00:13:54.909
all those times that already occurred, the past in

228
00:13:54.909 --> 00:13:59.440
front and the future as being behind them. Present

229
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.239
or will be co-located, uh, but the future and

230
00:14:03.239 --> 00:14:07.760
past are in opposite directions, um, than the, the

231
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.080
compared to the one we have. So those give

232
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.400
you some ideas that is some, these are things

233
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:18.200
are not genetically determined, and also they're not idiosyncratic

234
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.440
like you want, you have one person over here

235
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.760
thinking of time this way and another person that

236
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.700
way. They are culturally community driven, so they, they,

237
00:14:26.739 --> 00:14:30.049
uh, and they. Most likely manifest and spread and

238
00:14:30.049 --> 00:14:34.130
diffuse through linguistic practices. So in that case, when

239
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.330
you analyze the processing of time and space, it

240
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.760
would depend a lot, not just On the individual,

241
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.080
but it's also where this individual is immersed culturally

242
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.599
and linguistically. So, we also observed, uh, we did

243
00:14:48.599 --> 00:14:51.979
other studies then, uh, in Papua New Guinea with,

244
00:14:51.989 --> 00:14:56.469
uh, um, some of my, my grad students and,

245
00:14:56.599 --> 00:15:01.270
um, and collaborators in Germany. We studied, um, um,

246
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.039
for example, the Yo culture, uh, we were trying

247
00:15:04.039 --> 00:15:06.919
to test whether there will be some culture that

248
00:15:06.919 --> 00:15:11.659
would not have an ego-center pattern. But maybe what

249
00:15:11.659 --> 00:15:15.940
is called allocentric. So, based on features outside of

250
00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.979
the body, uh, that would be independent of the

251
00:15:18.979 --> 00:15:23.380
bodily position. So things like north and south or

252
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.580
east and west, or downhill or uphill, those are

253
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.719
all features that are related to all allocentric forms.

254
00:15:31.669 --> 00:15:33.599
And so we did the study and we were

255
00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:38.289
able to show, um, with Keny Cooperreer and colleagues,

256
00:15:38.299 --> 00:15:42.320
um, in Heidelberg, um, we were able to show

257
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.929
that, um, we, you know, we, we could observe

258
00:15:45.929 --> 00:15:48.750
through gesture production that, for example, among the Yo

259
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.840
of Papua New Guinea, a very isolated group up

260
00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.799
in the mountains there would actually, uh, conceive and

261
00:15:55.799 --> 00:16:00.159
construe and communicate, um, the idea of future as

262
00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:04.460
being uphill. And uh pass as being downhill from

263
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.859
the position of the speaker. So in that case,

264
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.469
it would be a topographic center form, which is

265
00:16:11.469 --> 00:16:15.849
not bodily center, but it's, it's bodily perceiving, um,

266
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.479
slopes, let's say, in the terrain where they exist.

267
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.530
So I would like to get now into the

268
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:27.080
topic of numbers, numerical cognition, and mathematics. So first

269
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.369
of all, what is a number?

270
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.869
That's a good question. Um, OF course, it depends

271
00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:37.419
on who you ask. Um, IF you ask a

272
00:16:37.419 --> 00:16:40.710
Platonic, uh, you know, philosopher would probably say, you

273
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.590
know, these are abstract entities that exist in some

274
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:47.890
platonic realm, uh, that are timeless, that have been

275
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.820
always there independent of human, human beings, and they

276
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.150
will always be there even if we all die

277
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.400
tomorrow, all humans, let's say. You know, if you

278
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.880
ask maybe mathematicians, they would just start from axioms

279
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.040
and start talking about the properties of different number

280
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.040
systems, uh, you know, real numbers, natural numbers, complex

281
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.500
numbers, uh, you know, transfinite numbers and so on.

282
00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.459
Uh, BUT if I take the question more like,

283
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.250
well, what is it cognitively? Um, WELL, in this

284
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.949
project that we've been working on now with the

285
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:27.089
colleagues from Europe, um, called Quanta, we are investigating

286
00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:30.589
that question more in depth, um, and then this

287
00:17:30.589 --> 00:17:32.869
is, this is, you know, we study the evolution

288
00:17:32.869 --> 00:17:36.510
of cognitive tools for quantification and then we, you

289
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.910
know, we analyze the, the, the, how, you know,

290
00:17:39.979 --> 00:17:43.699
Numeral terms are used in different parts of the

291
00:17:43.699 --> 00:17:46.780
world when they exist, so numerals being the sign

292
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.239
for a number, not the number concept, but how

293
00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:54.420
you express it. It could be orally, like the

294
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.869
word 5 as I produce now the sound 5,

295
00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.420
or maybe written if I write, you know, a

296
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.459
Roman numeral for it or an Arabic, uh, Indo-Arabic

297
00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:07.599
numeral and so on. But since most languages of

298
00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:10.319
the world have not been written, then uh we

299
00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:14.260
can consider numerals much, much more interestingly when you,

300
00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:18.859
when you analyze the, the, the sign produced uh

301
00:18:18.859 --> 00:18:21.680
phonetically. So the sound that you produced, it could

302
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.390
be also be, uh, you know, body signals and

303
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:29.319
so on. But in this case, then for a

304
00:18:29.319 --> 00:18:32.520
short answer, I would say number is, is one

305
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.650
form of exact quantification. A sym that is symbolic.

306
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.329
So, you necessarily need some symbolic resource to refer

307
00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:47.449
to that exact quantity. And those have certain properties

308
00:18:47.449 --> 00:18:49.530
that you could study, uh, and then you could,

309
00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:53.130
you know, eventually they lead to counting, but right

310
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.770
now I'm, I'm working precisely on this project and,

311
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.579
and investigating the question of It maybe it's not

312
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.880
all coming from counting and they're more basic atoms

313
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:08.380
that we need to investigate cognitively, anthropologically, archaeologically, and,

314
00:19:08.479 --> 00:19:10.989
and also from the point of view of neuroscience,

315
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.520
and that's, uh, that's what we're working on. So,

316
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.589
the, the long story short, number in the most

317
00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:21.880
prototypical form, so the ones that we normally, you

318
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.319
know, when, when we talk in everyday life and

319
00:19:24.319 --> 00:19:28.680
we say number, the, the most prototypical way. Um,

320
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.189
WOULD be an exact symbolic quantifier. Now, of course,

321
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.939
the word number is polysymous in our society, so

322
00:19:35.939 --> 00:19:38.430
you could have the word number when you say

323
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:42.910
telephone number, passport number, uh, but those are, those

324
00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.869
are different concepts, those are different, uh, uh, denotations

325
00:19:46.869 --> 00:19:50.430
of number. Um, SOMEONE may even have uh letters

326
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.150
in some passport, you have letters in the passport

327
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.689
number and so on. So that will be less

328
00:19:55.689 --> 00:19:59.089
prototypical, but the prototypical idea of a number in

329
00:19:59.089 --> 00:20:01.810
terms of uh a quantifier, that quantify something will

330
00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.550
be what I just expressed before.

331
00:20:04.949 --> 00:20:08.500
Do we have an innate concept of numbers?

332
00:20:09.949 --> 00:20:13.339
Um, WELL, that's an empirical question, I take it,

333
00:20:13.589 --> 00:20:17.900
and, um, and my short answer is no. Um,

334
00:20:18.229 --> 00:20:21.910
SO the idea here is, and I, I, I

335
00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.589
wrote a paper more or less addressing that in

336
00:20:24.589 --> 00:20:29.839
2017. And the trends in cognitive sciences in which

337
00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:32.599
I, I asked that question, but when you start

338
00:20:32.599 --> 00:20:37.079
to analyze, uh, you know, human data from other

339
00:20:37.079 --> 00:20:40.079
parts of the world, uh, you realize that, you

340
00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:44.959
know, many, many cultures around in the, in certain

341
00:20:44.959 --> 00:20:47.599
parts of the world, primarily in the Amazon and

342
00:20:47.599 --> 00:20:51.750
in Aboriginal Australia, would have, uh, exact quantifiers in

343
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:56.130
a small range, would be primarily around. 3 to

344
00:20:56.130 --> 00:21:03.010
42143, and so on. Um, BUT no higher numerals

345
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:08.510
for exact quantities and therefore also no arithmetic beyond

346
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.819
that and so on, which requires precision and precise

347
00:21:11.819 --> 00:21:16.170
results. So 3 plus 5 would always be 8,

348
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.390
not approximately 9 or 10 or sometimes if it's

349
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.089
rain, if it's raining 7, but if it's dry

350
00:21:22.089 --> 00:21:25.449
9 and so on. So, um. So when you

351
00:21:25.449 --> 00:21:27.170
start to look at more in detail, which is

352
00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.250
some something we're doing in this project I was

353
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.530
referring to, um, you start to realize that you

354
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.969
need a lot of components, um, to put together

355
00:21:35.969 --> 00:21:39.680
in order to get number, um, out of like,

356
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.849
you know, out of the system working. Um, SO

357
00:21:42.849 --> 00:21:44.939
that's why I was trying to, um, in that

358
00:21:44.939 --> 00:21:48.449
paper I was referring to, to make a distinction

359
00:21:48.449 --> 00:21:52.729
between, um, these innate abilities that appear to be

360
00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:58.199
biologically in doubt. To discriminate, um, without effort and

361
00:21:58.199 --> 00:22:01.660
in a precise manner quantities in a small range,

362
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:05.219
for example, a pair of something as opposed to

363
00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.079
3 items of that something or one single thing

364
00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:12.219
from a pair. In those cases, we don't need

365
00:22:12.219 --> 00:22:15.660
counting. Uh, YOU don't need education or learning or

366
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.189
language because you saw these features have also been

367
00:22:20.859 --> 00:22:25.160
shown to exist in many non-human species. So it

368
00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.089
shows that that apparatus is something that exists in

369
00:22:29.089 --> 00:22:34.750
a biologically endowed manner, so innate, and We may

370
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.630
argue that perhaps it does have a biological value

371
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.670
in evolution, so in order to uh have some

372
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:46.030
kind of um feature that would have evolved because

373
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:50.540
of evolutionary advantages. But that from my perspective is

374
00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.780
not number. It's just, uh, it doesn't have a

375
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.219
symbolic feature and it doesn't have counting. Uh, IT

376
00:22:56.219 --> 00:23:01.260
doesn't scale up to lead to arithmetic. So, and

377
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.530
that's why I gave that a different term. It's

378
00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:07.189
based on quantity-related aspects, so I call them quantical

379
00:23:07.189 --> 00:23:11.260
features, in which subitizing, which is the term of

380
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.500
the phenomenon I was just describing, will be one

381
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.189
of them. Another one is like the ability to

382
00:23:17.189 --> 00:23:20.949
compare relative quantities. Let's say a tree that has

383
00:23:20.949 --> 00:23:23.650
more pears and another tree that has less pears.

384
00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:26.790
You don't know exactly how, you're not counting, but

385
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.810
you see that one has more than the other.

386
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.750
Um, AGAIN, this may have had advantages for, you

387
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:38.209
know, species or individuals when foraging in hunter-gatherer societies

388
00:23:38.589 --> 00:23:41.709
to see, you know, which one, what direction to

389
00:23:41.709 --> 00:23:44.469
go in order to hunter and gather and so

390
00:23:44.469 --> 00:23:47.790
on. So, but that, those are non numerical in

391
00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.869
the sense that I was characterizing, uh, but they

392
00:23:51.869 --> 00:23:56.670
are, you know, the largely independent of culture and

393
00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:01.619
language. So those aspects are innate. Um, BUT the,

394
00:24:01.699 --> 00:24:03.849
in order to have number going, then you need

395
00:24:03.849 --> 00:24:07.819
symbolic reference and that for that you need language

396
00:24:07.819 --> 00:24:11.660
and other cultural preoccupations. And the idea here would

397
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.449
be that, for example, in Aboriginal Australia on the

398
00:24:14.449 --> 00:24:18.020
Amazon, in many, many of these languages, those cultural

399
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.060
preoccupations did not, did not emerge because they were

400
00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.160
worried about other things and, and in those very

401
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:29.150
complex languages, they develop. Very fine, uh, and, uh,

402
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.680
complicated, sophisticated linguistic system to grasp other aspects of

403
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:39.400
human, um, human, um, life like kinship or, you

404
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.150
know, colors and so on, but not exact quantification.

405
00:24:43.239 --> 00:24:46.630
So that, that leads me to think that number

406
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.640
is not. An innate thing. We're not, we're not

407
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.880
born with the, the notion of number in the

408
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.020
sense, but we're born with quantical features for like

409
00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:01.800
sabotizing and large quantity discrimination or relative quantity discrimination.

410
00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.349
And these quintical features, at least some of them

411
00:25:06.349 --> 00:25:10.150
would have been the result of evolution, evolution by

412
00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:11.270
natural selection.

413
00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.219
That's right. So the idea would be that because

414
00:25:14.219 --> 00:25:18.609
it's so, they're widely present in so many species

415
00:25:19.109 --> 00:25:21.349
um that don't have language and, and so many

416
00:25:21.349 --> 00:25:23.390
of them are not even social animals, so there's

417
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:28.109
not even, um, let's say transgenerational learning or something

418
00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:32.180
like that. Um, SO, uh, so appears to be

419
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.579
very, very fundamental, fundamental, but they operate in a

420
00:25:35.579 --> 00:25:39.319
small range of quantities that we humans with words

421
00:25:39.319 --> 00:25:45.630
call 321, and so on, but, um, It's probably

422
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:50.030
a good um origin for them developing other things,

423
00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:53.869
but in themselves, they're just quantical, but they're not

424
00:25:53.869 --> 00:25:58.550
numerical as they lack the symbolic referent aspect.

425
00:25:59.329 --> 00:26:03.689
Mhm. And how do we develop numerical cognition?

426
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.010
Well, it depends on, on what do we mean

427
00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.170
by we. So if you grow up in a

428
00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:14.000
society that has schools and writing, for example, then,

429
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.979
right, you're going to be as a, as Normally

430
00:26:17.979 --> 00:26:20.829
as a kid, you will be introduced to new

431
00:26:20.829 --> 00:26:25.270
tools and um in which you can outsource cognition,

432
00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:29.670
for example, by, you know, writing on paper and

433
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.900
inventing pens, and then someone will tell you how

434
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.229
to hold a pen and how to use it,

435
00:26:35.469 --> 00:26:37.510
how to sit, where to think, and all those

436
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.550
things is part of the scaffolding that, you know,

437
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.729
it's a new technology, new in the sense that

438
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:48.010
For the 250 or 300,000 years of the human

439
00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:51.900
species, writing only appeared, you know, 6000 years ago

440
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.589
and only in certain very specific areas of the

441
00:26:54.589 --> 00:26:59.050
world, so it's an artificial, so artificial in the

442
00:26:59.349 --> 00:27:05.229
original, um, meaning of the word, uh created by

443
00:27:05.229 --> 00:27:08.589
humans and then once you have that. Then you

444
00:27:08.589 --> 00:27:11.859
can build up many other things. So, numerical cognition

445
00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:15.900
would be one such example, um, that has been

446
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:20.459
historically benefiting from many, many, you know, changes and,

447
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:26.010
and, um, developments like uh introducing the Hindu-Arabic numerals

448
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:30.180
into Europe, for example, uh, creating the abacus and

449
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:34.569
playing with those, uh, those creations. Um, ALSO, um,

450
00:27:35.239 --> 00:27:38.280
you know, developing the printing press in which now

451
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.319
you can sort of print things and develop, you

452
00:27:40.319 --> 00:27:43.510
know, you don't have to copy handwriting and so

453
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.300
on. So, all these things, um, we tend to

454
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.979
ignore when we analyze numerical cognition these days because

455
00:27:50.979 --> 00:27:54.849
we just start from the fact that everyone You

456
00:27:54.849 --> 00:27:57.369
know, has numbers and in their minds and the

457
00:27:57.369 --> 00:27:59.199
kids and so on. Now, of course, we can

458
00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:02.890
also focus the research in numerical cognition in kids

459
00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:06.050
today in the industrialized societies and see how do

460
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.530
they learn, how do we teach them, what are

461
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.170
the main, you know, difficulties and so on and

462
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:14.660
so forth, but If we need to get to

463
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.619
the bottom, the, the truth is that you will

464
00:28:16.619 --> 00:28:20.380
need somehow a symbolic reference system. You will need

465
00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:25.140
heavy scaffolding um by other members of the society,

466
00:28:25.199 --> 00:28:27.859
which usually in our societies is a teacher and,

467
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.560
and also that, you know, those who produce books

468
00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.939
etc. um, AND you will need some kind of

469
00:28:33.939 --> 00:28:38.180
apparatus to handle, uh, abstractions. So, and that's coming

470
00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.099
back to what we were saying about time and

471
00:28:40.099 --> 00:28:44.520
space. That also operates with the development of numbers

472
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:49.930
because, you know, often numbers are also spatialized. And

473
00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:53.050
that's why we eventually we invented, for example, when

474
00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:56.209
I say we as in, you know, our Western

475
00:28:56.209 --> 00:29:01.030
society and, and, well, industrialized society, let's say improved

476
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.250
on the notion of a number line where now

477
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:07.689
all of a sudden numbers are on space, uh,

478
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.329
in an organized in a line and then you

479
00:29:10.329 --> 00:29:15.469
have You know, specific locations on space characterizing the

480
00:29:15.469 --> 00:29:19.390
uh numerical magnitude of a particular number. So, these

481
00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.869
are all things that kids learn today early in

482
00:29:22.869 --> 00:29:24.550
school, but if you look at the history of

483
00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.530
mathematics, you will realize that. As I've written in

484
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:31.130
other papers, uh, you know, the number line, it

485
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.209
was not at all something that came out straight

486
00:29:34.209 --> 00:29:37.449
of the brain, uh, or brain activity, and it's

487
00:29:37.449 --> 00:29:39.729
not, it was something that took a long time

488
00:29:39.729 --> 00:29:42.959
to get instantiated. And uh it's only around the

489
00:29:42.959 --> 00:29:45.400
17th century Europe that you start to see for

490
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.599
the first time number lines and, and people reasoning

491
00:29:49.599 --> 00:29:54.560
about, about those in terms of uh spatial uh

492
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.640
spatial properties.

493
00:29:58.449 --> 00:30:02.979
And so then where does mathematics come from? How

494
00:30:02.979 --> 00:30:04.839
do we get mathematics?

495
00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.930
Well, we just talked about numbers, which is one

496
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.250
very simple um form. Well, it's not so simple

497
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:16.329
when you get into the details, but, um, so

498
00:30:16.329 --> 00:30:19.619
mathematics is uh the way I see it, um,

499
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.930
comes out of a certain type of human preoccupation

500
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.660
that in different parts of the world emerged in.

501
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.500
In, um, in sectors of those societies that had,

502
00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:38.119
let's say, for example, writing systems, um, there's almost

503
00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:41.420
no mathematics without writing, so you need the writing,

504
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.170
and then usually the writing is in the hands

505
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:47.239
of a certain, not these days, but historically has

506
00:30:47.239 --> 00:30:50.560
been only in a small proportion of people in

507
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.579
societies. So, uh, even in the Middle Ages in

508
00:30:54.579 --> 00:30:57.380
Europe, there are estimates that maybe, you know, less

509
00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:02.319
than 10%, 5%, depending on different estimation, only knew

510
00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:04.780
how to read and write. And the same applied

511
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.020
to Babylonia and Chinese and uh, you know, societies

512
00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.420
and so on. So the idea is that mathematics

513
00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:15.699
really comes out of this, uh, sort of abstract

514
00:31:15.699 --> 00:31:19.780
developmental, uh, sorry, abstract concepts that developed, uh, you

515
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.869
know. Their own life if you want, and the

516
00:31:22.869 --> 00:31:24.989
way, the way that is done, as I argued

517
00:31:24.989 --> 00:31:28.459
with my co-author George Lakco at some point in,

518
00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.349
in a book like 20 years ago that some

519
00:31:31.349 --> 00:31:34.829
of the tools for anchoring those new inventions are,

520
00:31:35.119 --> 00:31:38.530
for example, conceptual metaphors and other forms of abstractions,

521
00:31:38.949 --> 00:31:41.089
sort of like the ones that I was describing

522
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:44.189
in a simple way, like time and space in

523
00:31:44.189 --> 00:31:48.349
which something gets mapped and expressed um via something

524
00:31:48.349 --> 00:31:52.729
else. And, um, so, you know, in set theory,

525
00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:55.530
the notion, the basic notions of sets may be

526
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:59.329
collections or things that are, you know, inside certain

527
00:31:59.329 --> 00:32:01.550
kinds of things like, you know, you can see

528
00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:04.579
things that are inside here like seeds or something

529
00:32:04.579 --> 00:32:07.170
and this being a set of seeds, so. And

530
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:10.589
that would be um manifested linguistically, so you could

531
00:32:10.589 --> 00:32:15.589
study mathematical text and mathematical talks given by professional

532
00:32:15.589 --> 00:32:18.040
mathematicians and you can analyze the language and the

533
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.369
gesture production and you could start realizing that many

534
00:32:21.369 --> 00:32:25.270
of these things are actually abstraction but anchored on

535
00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:30.010
um simpler forms, normally. And you could study those

536
00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:34.050
empirically with uh, from ethnographic observations all the way

537
00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:39.089
to lab, uh, well-controlled experiments. So, yeah, so mathematics

538
00:32:39.089 --> 00:32:41.890
will be a certain kind of, um, I would

539
00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:47.859
say sense-making mechanism developed in certain societies. And then

540
00:32:47.859 --> 00:32:50.579
they serve the purpose of many things, and, but

541
00:32:50.579 --> 00:32:53.939
one of the purposes that has served since, you

542
00:32:53.939 --> 00:32:56.800
know, Galileo at least is, is science. So, uh,

543
00:32:56.819 --> 00:32:59.660
we, it's a system that supports, you know, as

544
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.219
soon as you get measurements and numbers out of

545
00:33:02.219 --> 00:33:04.040
the measurements, then all of a sudden you have

546
00:33:04.339 --> 00:33:09.510
a mathematical system which is A human conceptual sense-making

547
00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.849
form, abstract but based on all these layers that

548
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.989
ground ultimately in this sort of bodily form that

549
00:33:15.989 --> 00:33:20.770
we were talking about, um, to, to sustain this

550
00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:25.150
preoccupations and they have, once you really develop them,

551
00:33:25.189 --> 00:33:27.109
you have a life on their own with new

552
00:33:27.109 --> 00:33:30.359
creations and new forms, so. If I can make

553
00:33:30.359 --> 00:33:32.599
sort of an analogy which is not exactly like

554
00:33:32.599 --> 00:33:35.209
mathematics, but will give you an idea that once

555
00:33:35.209 --> 00:33:37.770
you develop a system, then new questions start to

556
00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:41.349
come up within that system. Um, SO in the

557
00:33:41.349 --> 00:33:43.270
case of this analogy would be, you know, in

558
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.390
football or soccer as it's called in the US,

559
00:33:45.469 --> 00:33:47.989
you could have, you may invent the rule, you

560
00:33:47.989 --> 00:33:50.670
have two teams, you have two goals, and you

561
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.989
have a field with a certain dimensions, but as

562
00:33:53.989 --> 00:33:57.189
you develop the game, uh, then you start to

563
00:33:57.189 --> 00:33:59.670
realize that, uh, for example, oh, we may need

564
00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.510
the offside rule, and then when you have the

565
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:06.459
offside rule, uh, maybe initially it's a very Simple

566
00:34:06.459 --> 00:34:09.780
rule, but then gradually, you know, you invent, uh,

567
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.290
you know, the bar system that we have now

568
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.050
in which you can really see certain things, so

569
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:18.580
you redefine off, you know, offside rules, all is

570
00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.629
based on linguistics forms and abstraction, but it's, it's

571
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:27.168
a dynamic system. It's, it's an ongoing um creation.

572
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.909
So in mathematics as well, you have all the

573
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:32.909
time new things being created, especially in pure mathematics

574
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:36.489
and um. And then, you know, the, the question

575
00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:38.969
is, how are those new things created? Probably there's

576
00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:43.728
new preoccupations, culturally driven, but ultimately you would have

577
00:34:43.728 --> 00:34:48.449
human cognition, uh, bodily grounded, allowing that abstraction to

578
00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:51.929
happen in very constrained forms. It's not just anything

579
00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:54.290
goes, it's very um constrained.

580
00:34:55.789 --> 00:35:00.698
So you mentioned conceptual metaphors there. What roles do

581
00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:03.678
metaphors play in mathematics then?

582
00:35:05.129 --> 00:35:08.449
Uh, I would say roughly speaking, perhaps there's two

583
00:35:08.449 --> 00:35:11.689
types, uh, um, you know, uh, one would be,

584
00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:14.870
let's say the metaphors that you use to explain

585
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:20.129
things to children. So, or, or new students, um,

586
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:23.790
um, so let's say something that would help understanding

587
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:27.429
an idea, but it's not really defining of the

588
00:35:27.429 --> 00:35:31.350
idea, um, in a deep sense. So one example

589
00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:34.350
would be, let's say the step function in, in,

590
00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:37.989
let's say basic analytic geometry, you know, you may

591
00:35:37.989 --> 00:35:41.030
have your coordinates and then you may have a

592
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.709
function that has like this form, so it looks

593
00:35:43.709 --> 00:35:47.770
like stairs. So then you call it step function

594
00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.489
because it looks like steps. So that could be,

595
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.229
you know, helpful for kids to remember or new

596
00:35:53.229 --> 00:35:55.889
students of, you know, of that particular other features

597
00:35:55.889 --> 00:36:00.669
of that function, um, but that is not really

598
00:36:00.929 --> 00:36:04.530
altering or affecting the, the very notion of function.

599
00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:09.129
It's just characterizing in this case, the iconicity of

600
00:36:09.129 --> 00:36:12.409
how you draw the function according to certain rules.

601
00:36:13.229 --> 00:36:15.280
But there's another one, another form which is much

602
00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.100
more fundamental, and this is what we argued already

603
00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.179
twenty-something years ago with George Lakov and we've shown

604
00:36:21.959 --> 00:36:25.100
since then with uh the empirical studies and other,

605
00:36:25.399 --> 00:36:30.320
and other um um experiments that some of these

606
00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.500
ideas uh are, some of the original ideas in

607
00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:40.669
many mathematical, um, abstract mathematical concepts are Inherently metaphorical.

608
00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:44.149
So it's not just like an aid to teach

609
00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.889
kids or new students, but their very idea is

610
00:36:47.889 --> 00:36:51.090
already kind of like what we're saying with front,

611
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:54.330
future in front and past behind in which are

612
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:59.870
anchored inherently in the body position, let's say, orientation.

613
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.080
Uh, IN this case, you have ideas, um, um,

614
00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.580
that are inherently, for example, uh, when you analyze

615
00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.929
the origin of set theory, which is one of

616
00:37:08.929 --> 00:37:13.360
the most abstract branches in mathematics. When you analyze

617
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.600
the original text um from those people involved in

618
00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.550
the creation of that theory in the 19th century,

619
00:37:20.879 --> 00:37:24.520
Georg Kantor, and then, you know, other people who

620
00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.479
were around that time, um, you start to see

621
00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:31.199
that many of these original ideas had to do

622
00:37:31.199 --> 00:37:34.239
with how you deal with collections of things and

623
00:37:34.239 --> 00:37:36.590
how you put them together and how you separate

624
00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:39.679
them as if they were physical objects, uh, or

625
00:37:39.679 --> 00:37:42.219
you put them inside things and outside things, so.

626
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:46.409
An idea here is, for example, the Venn diagrams

627
00:37:46.409 --> 00:37:49.709
that were used to teach basic aspects of, of

628
00:37:49.709 --> 00:37:53.090
set theory, not every aspect of set theory, but

629
00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:58.500
it works so intuitively because it's recruiting these container

630
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:02.189
schemas of things that are inside and things are

631
00:38:02.189 --> 00:38:05.389
outside of that container as being, let's say, for

632
00:38:05.389 --> 00:38:09.030
example, set membership or not membership of a set.

633
00:38:09.729 --> 00:38:12.850
So those, many of those are, are inherent to

634
00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:15.850
the idea of, of set, of course, later then

635
00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:18.489
you develop more abstract form to try to detach

636
00:38:18.489 --> 00:38:21.810
that from that origins, but you would have that

637
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:26.030
and many aspects that deal with uh actual infinity,

638
00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:30.290
infinitesimal calculate in infinitesimal calculus, you would have, you

639
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:33.949
know, similar things in which you anchor on something

640
00:38:34.209 --> 00:38:38.139
more concrete. And that is a defining property of

641
00:38:38.139 --> 00:38:41.939
the, of the concept. So in that case, conceptual

642
00:38:41.939 --> 00:38:46.159
metaphor, not just metaphorical expression, but the, the conceptual,

643
00:38:46.379 --> 00:38:51.870
um, Mapping behind a metaphor, a conceptual metaphor, um,

644
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.800
it's, it's part of the inherent semantics of the,

645
00:38:55.919 --> 00:38:56.800
of the concept.

646
00:38:58.409 --> 00:39:02.090
So I have one last question then. Can embodied

647
00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:07.250
cognition applied to mathematics have applications in education as

648
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:07.590
well?

649
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.620
Well, um, So, here's, like, again, when we said

650
00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.399
embodied cognition, there's no one view or one coherence.

651
00:39:17.949 --> 00:39:20.560
So, if you ask me, they said, yes, well,

652
00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:25.419
if, if you bring to the classroom, and not

653
00:39:25.419 --> 00:39:29.889
just the classroom, to the curriculum development. To organize

654
00:39:29.889 --> 00:39:32.409
what do you need to teach, how you need

655
00:39:32.409 --> 00:39:35.040
to teach it, and so on. If you bring

656
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.530
activities and you, you bring forms that include these

657
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:44.449
more cognitive friendly forms for learning, many of, many

658
00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:47.850
of which do, uh, take into account, you know,

659
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:50.489
how we relate to things in, in with our

660
00:39:50.489 --> 00:39:54.429
bodies, how we see them, how we hear things

661
00:39:54.429 --> 00:39:56.879
and noises and so on. So in this case,

662
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.810
how, for example, a lot of the features would

663
00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:03.129
be spatial because we are very good at, as

664
00:40:03.129 --> 00:40:07.090
human primates, very good at discerning with, if we

665
00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.810
have a healthy visual system to see things and

666
00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:13.760
separate them and put them together and so on

667
00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.810
and so forth. So, a lot of those things

668
00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:20.459
could be. Helped, I would say by um not

669
00:40:20.459 --> 00:40:23.979
starting with pure abstract idea but relating to, I

670
00:40:23.979 --> 00:40:25.860
wouldn't like to just use the word concrete, but

671
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:30.020
it's more like a Like bodily interaction with these

672
00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:33.729
things, materials and and so on. Now, of course,

673
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:36.780
one of the features of mathematics is that the

674
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:43.060
very objects, mathematical objects are, you know, created to

675
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.580
mean something independent of the materiality of the thing.

676
00:40:46.659 --> 00:40:50.620
So, if we want to analyze whether 55 is

677
00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:55.239
a prime number or not, Then that feature of

678
00:40:55.239 --> 00:40:58.399
5 being prime is independent of whether you're playing

679
00:40:58.399 --> 00:41:03.159
with little pebbles or plastic cups or, you know,

680
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.800
or Lego materials or something. So the property is

681
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.040
more abstract than that, but the materiality may help

682
00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:14.120
to con to convey some of those properties. But

683
00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.840
here's maybe sometimes the misunderstanding and, and a lot

684
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:21.669
of people in mathematics education. That they think what

685
00:41:21.669 --> 00:41:24.510
I've seen at least in many panels and discussions

686
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:28.919
and conferences when I'm sometimes invited to talk, um,

687
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:32.090
or give talks, uh, is that it's, it's just

688
00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:36.629
the, the pure bodily form that would bring immediately

689
00:41:36.629 --> 00:41:40.510
the. The, you know, the abstraction, so to speak.

690
00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.629
And here I think the misunderstanding is that the

691
00:41:43.629 --> 00:41:48.060
embodied part, physically embodied experience, let's say, may be

692
00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:52.020
an important ingredient, but Uh, a crucial ingredient there

693
00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:56.320
is the instantiation of the symbolic activity and resources

694
00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:01.719
on those basic bodily functions. So, for example, We

695
00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:05.419
may think that because, you know, our, let's say,

696
00:42:05.479 --> 00:42:10.439
uh, most frequent base for numbers is 10 because

697
00:42:10.439 --> 00:42:13.939
we have 10 fingers. But I've, I, as I've

698
00:42:13.939 --> 00:42:16.620
written in other places and so on, well, many

699
00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:21.780
animals have what is called pentodactylsism. Penta means 5,

700
00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:25.620
dactyl means the, the digits anatomical in each of

701
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:30.300
the limbs. And if, if we're, you know, Um,

702
00:42:30.939 --> 00:42:33.300
If we have 2 upper limbs and 2 lower

703
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.340
limbs, then, you know, we would have 5 in

704
00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.669
each of these. So, but That is taken directly

705
00:42:39.669 --> 00:42:43.330
as being, oh, there's an embodied there grounding. Yes,

706
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.479
part of the story, but the crucial part of

707
00:42:46.479 --> 00:42:49.229
the story is that we have this capacity to

708
00:42:49.229 --> 00:42:55.169
relate symbolically to this anatomical and recruited for anchoring

709
00:42:55.169 --> 00:42:58.989
quantity and do finger counting and other things. Other

710
00:42:58.989 --> 00:43:05.750
primates also have pentodactyls, gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees, macaques, raccoons,

711
00:43:06.189 --> 00:43:09.889
you know, they all have. 5 fingers, so to

712
00:43:09.889 --> 00:43:12.139
speak, in each of the limbs, but none of

713
00:43:12.139 --> 00:43:18.520
them would recruit them symbolically to ground numbers. So,

714
00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:20.949
that I think is often what is missed in

715
00:43:20.949 --> 00:43:25.709
mathematics education is that the whole relationship between the

716
00:43:25.709 --> 00:43:30.270
symbolic reference and the bodily activity, um, they both

717
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.199
have to work combined and, and it's not just

718
00:43:33.199 --> 00:43:36.110
like put kids to play with things and cubes

719
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:38.469
and containers and you will get the mathematics out

720
00:43:38.469 --> 00:43:39.590
of that straight away.

721
00:43:41.399 --> 00:43:44.840
Great, so Doctor Nunez, just before we go, would

722
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.120
you like to tell people where they can find

723
00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.820
your work on the internet?

724
00:43:49.879 --> 00:43:52.449
Um, WELL, I think if you Google scholar, uh,

725
00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:54.370
you will find, well, the book I was referring

726
00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:58.750
with George Lakoff, we published it, um, 2000s, like

727
00:43:58.919 --> 00:44:02.199
a quarter century ago now, uh, where mathematics comes

728
00:44:02.199 --> 00:44:04.689
from, and, but then many, many things have happened

729
00:44:04.689 --> 00:44:07.729
since, a lot of work and fieldwork, uh, with

730
00:44:07.729 --> 00:44:12.729
respect to the time and space, uh. Um, uh,

731
00:44:12.889 --> 00:44:15.969
THERE'S several papers you can find in Google Scholar

732
00:44:15.969 --> 00:44:19.189
that are, uh, with studies of the Aymara culture

733
00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:21.370
or the Hu of Papua New Guinea, as I

734
00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:25.489
was saying, with different empirical, um, uh, studies that

735
00:44:25.489 --> 00:44:29.590
we did, and then publications, uh, of review of

736
00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:32.290
the, of the many other cultures as well that

737
00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:36.050
I co-wrote with the My former grad student, Kinsey

738
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:39.649
Cooperreer, um, and then I've done also with other

739
00:44:39.649 --> 00:44:43.209
authors, uh, papers around that topic, and in numerical

740
00:44:43.209 --> 00:44:47.330
cognition, yes, there's also things you find. Um, AND

741
00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:49.409
with respect to mathematics, well, I'm working on a

742
00:44:49.409 --> 00:44:52.679
book that should be published next year in MIT

743
00:44:52.679 --> 00:44:56.290
Press on the nature of mathematics, but um, I'm

744
00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.050
still working on it right now.

745
00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:01.729
Great. So thank you so much for taking the

746
00:45:01.729 --> 00:45:03.709
