00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:03.339
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:06.289
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes and

3
00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:09.090
today I'm joined by Doctor Kara Okabach. She is

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.369
associate professor and director of the Human Eenergetics Laboratory

5
00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.969
at the University of Notre Dame. And today we're

6
00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:23.239
talking mostly about human energetics and hunting in human

7
00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.530
society. So, Doctor Rockerbach, welcome to the show. It's

8
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.930
a huge pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:30.430
Ricardo, thank you so much for having me on.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.549
I'm really excited about this today.

11
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.250
Awesome. So, let's get into it then. First of

12
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.209
all, just to introduce the first topic here. Could

13
00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:45.209
you tell us what human energetics is about? I

14
00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:49.450
mean, actually, I've already interviewed many anthropologists on the

15
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.880
show, but I don't remember ever Having an interview.

16
00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.220
Perhaps we've touched a little bit on uh on

17
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.849
it here and there, but having an interview really

18
00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.819
talking directly about human energetics, at least I can't

19
00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:07.220
remember having one of those. So what sorts of

20
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.860
things do you study there?

21
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.029
Yeah, that, that's also a wonderful, you know, shout

22
00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:14.589
out to anthropology being such a broad field that

23
00:01:14.589 --> 00:01:17.430
you can study so many different things. So, human

24
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.949
energetics is basically looking at calories, how many calories

25
00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:23.790
individuals consume. That's one thing you think about the

26
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.309
diet and what's actually be taking in and where

27
00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:28.980
those calories are coming from. Uh, I'm a bit

28
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.239
more interested in where those calories are going. Uh,

29
00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:37.089
HOW do human bodies allocate calories to different tasks,

30
00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:39.440
whether they be tasks that you're aware of, like

31
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.330
running around the block, or the tasks of just

32
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.529
keeping your body alive that are always going on

33
00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:48.010
in the background. And then how the body adjusts

34
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.370
when there's a change, whether internally or externally a

35
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.099
change. How does somebody's metabolism, uh, or energetic throughput

36
00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:59.290
alter in response to those kinds of changes. And

37
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.089
so very broadly, that's what it is, and it

38
00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:03.129
can be used in any number of different contexts,

39
00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:06.519
whether it be anthropology or exercise physiology or medicine.

40
00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:08.490
Uh, A lot of people are looking at this

41
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.000
kind of thing of across fields.

42
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.880
Mhm. And of course, human energetics, I would imagine

43
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.529
we could say has a lot to do with

44
00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:19.589
the kinds of environments humans live in. We can

45
00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:24.169
live in more or less extreme environments. And you've

46
00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.250
done some work exactly on that, on humans living

47
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.380
in extreme environments. So, what is exactly an extreme

48
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.570
environment for a human?

49
00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:37.246
Yeah, so, I mean, there are technically, I would

50
00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:38.636
have to go back and look at the exact

51
00:02:38.636 --> 00:02:41.235
numbers, but there are actual technical cutoffs of what

52
00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:44.356
people consider to be extreme heat or extreme cold

53
00:02:44.356 --> 00:02:48.365
or extreme humidity or extreme dryness. Uh, BUT if

54
00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:50.246
you want to think about it, very, and this

55
00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:53.085
is not an accurate definition, but kind of anything

56
00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:56.085
that puts you outside of your thermon-neutral zone, if

57
00:02:56.085 --> 00:03:00.162
we're Talking about extremes of temperature and so our

58
00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:02.481
bodies kind of live at the 98.6, but we

59
00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:05.042
prefer a room temperature at around 70 degrees, and

60
00:03:05.042 --> 00:03:07.281
this is all Fahrenheit. Sorry for folks at home

61
00:03:07.281 --> 00:03:10.802
using Celsius. Um, ANYTHING that pushes your body to

62
00:03:10.802 --> 00:03:13.231
either have to cool down because of a warmer

63
00:03:13.231 --> 00:03:16.572
external temperature or warm up because of colder external

64
00:03:16.572 --> 00:03:18.992
temperature could be considered a bit of an extreme.

65
00:03:19.322 --> 00:03:21.511
But of course that's a simplification, um, and so

66
00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:23.001
when we talk about my work, which is in

67
00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:27.710
Finland. Uh, THEY can have, you know, -40 Â°C.

68
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.639
I, when I think of Finland, I, I shift

69
00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.720
to Celsius. But I think in general I'm in

70
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.949
Fahrenheit. Uh, BUT you know, they can have temperatures

71
00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:36.679
as cold as -30 -40 Â°C, and that is

72
00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:39.440
an extreme cold environment. Uh, AND we can also

73
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.169
see seasonal extremes. Uh, SO where I live in

74
00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.979
the mid West of the United States. Uh, WE

75
00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:48.649
typically have really pleasant summers, but more extreme heat

76
00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:51.300
in summers has become far more common than it

77
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.259
used to be in the past. And so we

78
00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:55.779
are now seeing not only your standard extremes that

79
00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:57.940
have been around a long time, but areas that

80
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.190
are typically temperate, experiencing more extremes as well.

81
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.429
So it has a lot to do with factors

82
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:10.149
like uh temperature, right? Uh, ARE there other factors

83
00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.460
that you also consider?

84
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.789
Uh, TEMPERATURE, humidity, or dryness in the other way,

85
00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:17.640
and high altitude is one of the big classic

86
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.269
extremes within, uh, within anthropology. It's probably one of

87
00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.339
the best studied extremes within the field of anthropology

88
00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:27.619
and across the board in any subfield of anthropology,

89
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.299
high altitude, they've done such excellent work, uh, from

90
00:04:31.299 --> 00:04:33.980
the cultural to the genetics, it's absolutely fantastic.

91
00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:39.540
Uh, HIGH altitude is usually associated with less availability

92
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.589
of oxygen in the air,

93
00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:44.459
right? Correct, yeah, the partial pressure of oxygen, you

94
00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:46.350
don't get quite as much in with each breath,

95
00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:49.459
absolutely, but you also get other things usually not

96
00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:53.450
as much plant life. Grow at high altitude, uh,

97
00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:55.059
and the same thing, you don't have quite as

98
00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:56.820
many animals, so you have a kind of a

99
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.859
resource extreme there, uh, and then usually higher UV

100
00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:03.290
exposure from the sun because you are literally physically

101
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.010
closer with less ozone separating you between the, uh,

102
00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:07.980
the sun and your skin.

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.540
So I would imagine that one of the questions

104
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.299
that some my audience at this point would be

105
00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:18.140
asking is, since we're now very unfortunately going through

106
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.420
climate change at a global scale, do you think

107
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.899
that studying human energetics could help us deal with

108
00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:29.779
some of the consequences that we will have to

109
00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:33.489
deal with it, particularly in terms of uh temperature

110
00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:34.260
variation?

111
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.529
Yeah, that's a really wonderful question and as somebody

112
00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.750
who works in a cold climate, I often get

113
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.529
asked why are you working in the cold? It's

114
00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:44.769
not gonna be cold much longer. Um, HOWEVER, I

115
00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:46.450
do think there is, of course I have to

116
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.880
think that there is a way to relate it

117
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.250
all, and I think energetics is definitely a tool

118
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.510
in the toolkit of maybe not necessarily solving. At

119
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.149
least not right away, solving any issues our bodies

120
00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:59.989
face, but I think it's absolutely important in helping

121
00:05:59.989 --> 00:06:04.140
us understand how our bodies are changing and potential

122
00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:08.679
negative impacts of these climatic shifts to more extremes,

123
00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:12.839
uh, and so. Knowing exactly how many calories can't

124
00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.850
necessarily give us, you know, a benefit with climate

125
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.290
change, but seeing how we're responding absolutely can. Um,

126
00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:20.130
AND I also want to zoom out a little

127
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.649
bit and that, you know, anyone who studies energetics,

128
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.089
it's never just energetics, uh, you know, we're also

129
00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:28.130
looking at how physical activity is going to be

130
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.209
shifting because of extremes. So in extreme cold or

131
00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:33.730
extreme heat, people might become less active in order

132
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.929
to stay out of that extreme, and that can

133
00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:38.329
have detrimental health effects. And we also look at

134
00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:40.929
the downstream of how things are changing with body

135
00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:44.809
composition, and how people are also behaviorally and culturally

136
00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:47.649
managing these different extremes that they are now coming

137
00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:48.570
into contact with.

138
00:06:49.989 --> 00:06:53.549
By the way, taking into account this issue of

139
00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:57.950
climate change and because people from different societies are

140
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:03.190
adapted to specific kinds of climate, is this adaptation

141
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.750
uh mainly a genetic one or can people that

142
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.390
used to live in a particular kind of environment

143
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.140
also adapt to a new one with new environmental

144
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.250
conditions, particularly when it comes To, uh, raising temperatures,

145
00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:23.529
for example, or rising temperatures, for example. Because I

146
00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:28.609
was wondering if, uh, I mean, behaviorally, culturally, or

147
00:07:28.609 --> 00:07:34.809
even physiologically, people even throughout their lifespan can adapt

148
00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:39.769
to environments that would be very different from the

149
00:07:39.769 --> 00:07:44.730
ones they were born in and lived in through

150
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.209
most of their lives.

151
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.850
Yeah, so this becomes a very interesting semantic conversation

152
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.369
unfortunately, of, you know, how you define adaptation, and

153
00:07:54.369 --> 00:07:56.279
I try to be a bit more strict and

154
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.730
and I know I fail at doing this all

155
00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.970
the time of what adaptation is, but, you know,

156
00:08:00.049 --> 00:08:05.049
by the classic definition and adaptation is a A

157
00:08:05.239 --> 00:08:08.929
physiological, anatomical, whatever kind of feature you wanna think

158
00:08:08.929 --> 00:08:11.450
of that has a genetic basis that can be

159
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.940
inherited so that it gets passed down from generation

160
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.220
to generation, whether you're still in that high altitude

161
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.019
or not, that those kids will be born with

162
00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:23.200
high altitude adaptations, um. When we think about people

163
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.519
who go from 11 extreme to another extreme, if

164
00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:29.029
they were to develop, you know, an actual adaptation,

165
00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:32.750
that would take generations upon generations to actually develop.

166
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.719
But we do actually physiologically alter our bodies, uh,

167
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.429
in different extremes, and that's called acclimatization. Uh, SO

168
00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:45.348
you have adaptation, which is a permanent thing. You've

169
00:08:45.348 --> 00:08:46.989
got it. It's in your genes, you're not getting

170
00:08:46.989 --> 00:08:50.299
rid of it unless it's happening over multiple generations.

171
00:08:50.789 --> 00:08:54.379
Acclimatization takes, you know, 10 days to 2 weeks.

172
00:08:54.708 --> 00:08:57.869
So for folks who are climbing Mount Everest, for

173
00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:00.068
example, which actually I think we're like right around

174
00:09:00.068 --> 00:09:01.989
that period of time where people might be making

175
00:09:01.989 --> 00:09:04.718
a a summit attempts on Mount Everest, it's usually

176
00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:06.948
right around this time of year. Uh, IT takes,

177
00:09:07.028 --> 00:09:09.604
that's why it actually takes. Them like 2 months

178
00:09:09.604 --> 00:09:13.094
to climb Mount Everest because they're doing this constant

179
00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:16.515
go up and then acclimatize to that elevation and

180
00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:18.405
then go back down and recover and then go

181
00:09:18.405 --> 00:09:20.195
back up and acclimatize and then go back down.

182
00:09:20.234 --> 00:09:22.275
It's a back and forth, back and forth. And

183
00:09:22.275 --> 00:09:24.794
so our bodies are actually quite flexible in our

184
00:09:24.794 --> 00:09:27.914
ability to acclimatize to different environments, but there are

185
00:09:27.914 --> 00:09:30.265
limits, just like there are limits with adaptations as

186
00:09:30.265 --> 00:09:32.275
well. And so I think when it comes to

187
00:09:32.275 --> 00:09:35.034
climate change, I don't think we have the time

188
00:09:35.315 --> 00:09:39.479
to physiologically, genetically adapt. Uh, OUR, our generation times

189
00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:41.119
are not fast enough for us to be able

190
00:09:41.119 --> 00:09:45.559
to do that. Certain, certain animals, organisms can bacteria

191
00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:47.880
have very short generation times, so they can quickly

192
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.640
adapt to things, but humans can't. And so when

193
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.780
it comes to things like climate change, I think

194
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.599
our ability to acclimatize will be important, but I

195
00:09:55.599 --> 00:09:59.039
think our approach to it culturally, behaviorally, and technologically

196
00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:01.039
are going to be the keys to us making

197
00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:04.400
it through, um, if we ever actually make it

198
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.039
through, if we do, it'll be because of those

199
00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:06.440
things.

200
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.580
Right. So tell us now about your work with

201
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:17.500
reindeer herders in subarctic Finland. So, what are, what

202
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.419
aspects of their physiology and energetics have you focused

203
00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:21.739
on?

204
00:10:22.609 --> 00:10:24.570
Yeah, so it started out as kind of a,

205
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.559
a classic study looking at cold climate adaptations of,

206
00:10:27.599 --> 00:10:30.429
you know, what might actually exist. Uh, COLD climate

207
00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:33.440
populations have not been well studied since the 1930s

208
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.000
to the 1950s. There was a little bit of

209
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.500
it with, um, Doctors Josh Snodgrass and Doctor, uh,

210
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.919
Bill Leonard, both of whom I adore beyond all

211
00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:44.700
belief and reason. Uh, AND they worked in Russia,

212
00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:48.039
uh, with the Yakutia there looking at some cold

213
00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:50.895
climate adaptation. As well, um, and then one of

214
00:10:50.895 --> 00:10:53.775
their students, uh, Doctor Stephanie Levy has continued it,

215
00:10:53.854 --> 00:10:56.174
but now, of course, no work is continuing in

216
00:10:56.174 --> 00:10:58.815
Russia whatsoever. Uh, AND so that project's kind of

217
00:10:58.815 --> 00:11:00.965
done. But I knew there was a gap, that

218
00:11:00.965 --> 00:11:02.974
there was this big gap in our understanding of

219
00:11:02.974 --> 00:11:05.695
cold climate adaptation. Um, AND I want to go

220
00:11:05.695 --> 00:11:07.715
back to high altitude for a moment and that

221
00:11:07.715 --> 00:11:11.695
there are 32 well studied populations for high altitude

222
00:11:11.695 --> 00:11:13.645
and a third that's not quite as well studied,

223
00:11:13.655 --> 00:11:16.549
but we're, we're definitely getting up there. Um, AND

224
00:11:16.549 --> 00:11:19.710
we found a completely different suite of adaptations across

225
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.109
those three, and so even though they have the

226
00:11:22.109 --> 00:11:26.979
same exposures, physiologically, evolutionarily, they, they went along different

227
00:11:26.979 --> 00:11:29.830
routes and that's exactly how evolution works. It, it

228
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:32.909
takes the route it has available. There's no perfect

229
00:11:32.909 --> 00:11:36.000
endpoint. Uh, AND so, you know, that makes you

230
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.880
wonder, is that gonna be similar across uh different

231
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.039
extremes. So can you expect different cold climate populations

232
00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:45.679
to be adapted differently to cold, and we can't

233
00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:47.599
answer that unless we have the data, which means

234
00:11:47.599 --> 00:11:49.799
we have to work with more cold climate populations.

235
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.859
And so some of the typical things that we

236
00:11:51.859 --> 00:11:53.659
see, if we just talk about body shape and

237
00:11:53.659 --> 00:11:57.059
size and form, is typically in in cold climates

238
00:11:57.059 --> 00:12:00.539
you see shorter and broader body shapes, and this

239
00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:03.460
reduces the amount of surface area relative to body

240
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.659
mass, which means you lose less heat to a

241
00:12:05.659 --> 00:12:08.460
cold environment. You see the opposite in hot, uh,

242
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.659
where individuals tend to be more narrow and tall,

243
00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:12.260
that way they have tons of surface area and

244
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.219
they could dump all their heat to the environment

245
00:12:14.219 --> 00:12:16.760
to, to keep their body temperature down. So in

246
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.679
cold we see short and kind of stout, uh,

247
00:12:19.719 --> 00:12:22.000
and we also typically see greater muscle mass as

248
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.140
well as greater fat, uh, and actual adipose tissue,

249
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.830
and this is an insulative sort of property or

250
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.359
or so we think that it actually helps provide

251
00:12:30.359 --> 00:12:35.390
extra layers from losing that internal body heat. Physiologically,

252
00:12:35.469 --> 00:12:37.919
we see some interesting things as well. Uh, I'll

253
00:12:37.919 --> 00:12:39.989
go into the ones that I don't study directly

254
00:12:39.989 --> 00:12:42.109
and then the ones I do study directly. Uh,

255
00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:44.750
BUT you see, uh, what's called the hunter response

256
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.830
or hunting response. And this is an oscillation in

257
00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.270
your blood vessels between vasoconstrictions, so tightening up, and

258
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.575
vasodilation. So opening up. Uh, YOU vasoconstrict in order

259
00:12:56.575 --> 00:12:59.414
to conserve heat, and then you vasodilate to make

260
00:12:59.414 --> 00:13:01.534
sure you are getting blood to like your fingers

261
00:13:01.534 --> 00:13:03.684
and toes so they don't fall off and die,

262
00:13:04.775 --> 00:13:06.765
which is not what you want in any climate.

263
00:13:07.054 --> 00:13:09.494
Uh, AND so you see this kind of oscillation

264
00:13:09.494 --> 00:13:12.414
between vasoconstriction and vasodilation to both save heat but

265
00:13:12.414 --> 00:13:15.809
keep the tissue alive. Um, SO that's one. You

266
00:13:15.809 --> 00:13:18.729
see, shivering, we have all experienced shivering at some

267
00:13:18.729 --> 00:13:21.169
point in our lives. That's not super effective in

268
00:13:21.169 --> 00:13:23.849
producing extra body heat, but it can help. Uh,

269
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.690
AND then one of the things that, uh, or

270
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.090
two of the things as I say I'm very

271
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.409
interested in, uh, go down to the energetic. So

272
00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:33.119
resting metabolic rate, Cold climate adapt or cold climate

273
00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:37.489
populations on average can have 20 to 40% higher

274
00:13:37.489 --> 00:13:41.599
resting metabolic rates than Than expected and compared to

275
00:13:41.599 --> 00:13:44.630
folks from, say, temperate climates. And so their bodies

276
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.679
produce more heat because they lose so much more

277
00:13:46.679 --> 00:13:49.000
to the environment. And then the other thing that

278
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.320
I'm interested in is brown adipose tissue, and this

279
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.340
is a kind of fat that burns only to

280
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.000
keep you warm. It's very mitochondria dense, and in

281
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.320
adults, it's located in the supraclavicular region. So for

282
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.200
folks at home, it's just right around your shoulder,

283
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.559
kind of between the tip of your shoulder and

284
00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:07.489
neck. And um also along the major deep blood

285
00:14:07.489 --> 00:14:09.520
vessels, which is not as easy to get to

286
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.530
in field work. Um, HUMAN babies are born with

287
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.250
it, like a cape down the front and down

288
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.330
the back since they do not have a mature

289
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.130
thermoregulatory system. And it used to be thought that

290
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.929
once babies burned through that, adults never had it.

291
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.130
And it is now, the more we look, the

292
00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.929
more we see all over the place. Um, WE'VE

293
00:14:27.929 --> 00:14:30.919
even found brown adipose tissue in a Samoan population,

294
00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.969
which is a tropical population, and so it's entirely

295
00:14:33.969 --> 00:14:37.849
possible that that brown fat is a pan-human, deeply

296
00:14:37.849 --> 00:14:41.239
ancient adaptation, uh, which would be like, Kara, what

297
00:14:41.239 --> 00:14:43.409
in the world are you saying? Humans evolved in

298
00:14:43.409 --> 00:14:45.890
Africa, which is a hot, hot area, what in

299
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:49.010
the world. But in those in those regions, yeah,

300
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.900
it's hot during the day, but at night it,

301
00:14:50.929 --> 00:14:54.289
it gets quite cold, uh, the temperature drops and

302
00:14:54.289 --> 00:14:56.330
so brown adipose tissue could actually have been a

303
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.849
very important piece of anatomy to keep individuals warm

304
00:14:59.849 --> 00:15:02.119
during the night. Uh, SO that's kind of the,

305
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.809
the big suite of things we see, and then

306
00:15:03.809 --> 00:15:06.169
you can also dive down into to more specifics

307
00:15:06.169 --> 00:15:08.960
like thyroid hormone as that relates to resting metabolic

308
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.969
rate. Your thyroid hormone kind of sets the thermostat

309
00:15:11.969 --> 00:15:14.130
of your body. So typically if you have a

310
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.729
higher resting metabolic rate, you might have higher thyroid

311
00:15:16.729 --> 00:15:19.130
hormone levels as well in cold climates.

312
00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:23.140
So many different things to try to break down

313
00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.260
here. Let me ask you a little bit more

314
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.340
about fat or um I, I mean, because you

315
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.659
mentioned brown adipose tissue there, but if I understood

316
00:15:32.659 --> 00:15:35.320
it correctly, it's not just that, that people in

317
00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:40.010
These more extreme colder environments have more brown adipose

318
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:45.880
tissue, but they also have more, uh, white adipose

319
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.719
tissue, right? To, to try to insulate them a

320
00:15:49.719 --> 00:15:50.669
little bit more.

321
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.479
Exactly correct. And I, I also want to clarify

322
00:15:53.479 --> 00:15:55.200
too with both brown, at least how we measure

323
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.030
it in the field so that people don't get

324
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.580
the, the wrong. Idea from it, but yeah, so

325
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.900
they do absolutely have more white fat. So think

326
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.729
of the subcutaneous fat that's under your skin all

327
00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:07.580
over the body. Uh, COLD climate populations do tend

328
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.409
to have more of that than hot climate populations.

329
00:16:10.619 --> 00:16:12.460
And then brown fat, at least with the field

330
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.609
methods we use because we're not putting people into

331
00:16:14.609 --> 00:16:17.739
CT scans or PET scans, you know, in the

332
00:16:17.739 --> 00:16:21.974
middle of the Arctic, um. We can't measure volume

333
00:16:21.974 --> 00:16:24.955
of brown fat with our methods. Our methods involve

334
00:16:24.955 --> 00:16:28.195
thermal imaging cameras and measuring metabolic rate during cold

335
00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:31.474
exposure. So we can measure its activity. And we

336
00:16:31.474 --> 00:16:33.715
see that in how things will light up warmer

337
00:16:33.715 --> 00:16:36.034
where brown fat is compared to areas that don't

338
00:16:36.034 --> 00:16:38.275
have brown fat, as well as an increase in

339
00:16:38.275 --> 00:16:40.275
metabolic rate. And we, we try to keep those

340
00:16:40.275 --> 00:16:44.020
cold exposures during the test. At like 12 to

341
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.890
15 Â°C, and for those who like Fahrenheit, it's

342
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.080
like 60 Â°F. So it's actually not cold cold,

343
00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:53.809
but it's a mild cold enough temperature that your

344
00:16:53.809 --> 00:16:56.099
body turns on brown fat but doesn't get you

345
00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:58.530
to shiver. But if you start shivering, we don't

346
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.369
know if the metabolic rate is increasing because of

347
00:17:00.369 --> 00:17:02.130
the shivering or because of the brown fat.

348
00:17:03.969 --> 00:17:05.920
Yes, uh, and I wanted to ask you about

349
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.449
that specifically because, uh, we have this very common

350
00:17:10.449 --> 00:17:14.250
idea and it's also at at the very least,

351
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:20.290
an oversimplification that white fat equals bad fat and

352
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:24.079
brown fat equals good fat. I mean, is there

353
00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:25.689
any truth to that

354
00:17:25.689 --> 00:17:28.410
or? I mean, it's a yes and no. Of

355
00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.430
course. It's never as clear cut as people want

356
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.030
it to be. Um, AND so I, I, I

357
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.790
think another important thing that folks need to understand

358
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.989
is that fat, white fat, because it's very obvious

359
00:17:38.989 --> 00:17:41.069
from what I'm saying that brown fat is active

360
00:17:41.069 --> 00:17:42.989
and it burns calories and things like that. Like,

361
00:17:43.109 --> 00:17:45.270
I think people understand that. But what I think

362
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.709
a lot of people don't really recognize is that

363
00:17:47.709 --> 00:17:50.670
white adipose tissue, it is an organ, and it's

364
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.349
an organ that interacts with the rest of your

365
00:17:53.349 --> 00:17:57.729
body. It produces hormones. It responds to hormones. And

366
00:17:57.729 --> 00:17:59.930
so it's not this inner thing that you're just

367
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.890
carrying around. It's not just these extra energy packets

368
00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.400
your body can use if it needs to. Uh,

369
00:18:05.569 --> 00:18:08.449
IT, it does actually have an endocrine and physiological

370
00:18:08.449 --> 00:18:10.969
function in the body, and we all have an

371
00:18:10.969 --> 00:18:13.569
essential fat level, which means if you go below

372
00:18:13.569 --> 00:18:17.290
a certain amount, your body doesn't work well. Everybody

373
00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.800
needs fat to function properly. So as the good

374
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.219
versus bad, now that we know that fat actually

375
00:18:22.219 --> 00:18:25.199
does have a purpose outside of just being an

376
00:18:25.199 --> 00:18:28.119
energy pocket, um, it's actually a little bit more

377
00:18:28.119 --> 00:18:31.239
about location than it is necessarily about the fact

378
00:18:31.239 --> 00:18:34.000
that it's white or brown fat. You have subcutaneous

379
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.160
fat and you have visceral fat. The subcutaneous fat

380
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.400
is if you were to pull your arm and

381
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.239
you pinch at your skin, that's subcutaneous. That's the

382
00:18:41.239 --> 00:18:44.089
stuff on the surface. The visceral fat is the

383
00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:47.770
stuff that's under the muscle layer, particularly around the

384
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.380
abdomen, and it's in and around your organs. That's

385
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.760
the more dangerous fat because of that endocrine process

386
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.369
that goes on, the fact that it is an

387
00:18:57.369 --> 00:19:00.280
endocrine organ. And that interacts, the more fat you

388
00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.000
get, it does become an issue. You have this

389
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.680
constant chronic inflammation around the organs. And so white

390
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.670
fat inherently on, on its own is not bad,

391
00:19:09.079 --> 00:19:11.869
but having more in one location is much worse

392
00:19:11.869 --> 00:19:13.520
than having it in another location.

393
00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.300
But even the white fat that we have surrounding

394
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.300
our internal organs, I mean, it's not good for

395
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.859
us to have too much of it, but we

396
00:19:23.859 --> 00:19:26.160
need at least some of it to keep them

397
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:26.719
in place,

398
00:19:27.979 --> 00:19:29.099
we need at least some of it, you know,

399
00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.430
if, if you want to think about the bare

400
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.479
mini. Just to protect your kidneys. I mean, those

401
00:19:33.479 --> 00:19:35.469
organs are hanging out between the pelvis and the

402
00:19:35.469 --> 00:19:38.959
rib cage completely there for, for getting battered. And

403
00:19:38.959 --> 00:19:40.430
so having a bit of a fat layer to

404
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.949
protect them is incredibly important. And you also have

405
00:19:42.949 --> 00:19:45.550
an apron of fat that protects your, uh, intestines.

406
00:19:45.589 --> 00:19:48.270
It's called the greater omentum. And so we all

407
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.760
have a certain amount of essential necessary fat that

408
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.280
your body needs to survive and Last any sort

409
00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.359
of beating that it might take, but having too

410
00:19:56.359 --> 00:19:58.589
much, just like having too much of anything can

411
00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:01.119
can lead to problems, particularly in the visceral fat

412
00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:02.239
when we're talking about that.

413
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:07.680
Mhm. So, uh, these reindeer herders, apart from these

414
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:13.400
more physiological metabolical aspects to them, do they have

415
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:19.109
any other ways of coping with harsh winter conditions

416
00:20:19.109 --> 00:20:19.689
specifically?

417
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.160
They know what they're doing, Ricardo. It's like it's,

418
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.250
it's always very, very impressive to me when I

419
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.599
think about it, and it shouldn't be because of

420
00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:28.449
course, like they've been living there for, you know,

421
00:20:28.609 --> 00:20:31.640
millennia, of course they know what they're doing. Um,

422
00:20:31.969 --> 00:20:33.849
SO what I find really great about the reindeer

423
00:20:33.849 --> 00:20:36.989
herders is that they have this, this, they are

424
00:20:36.989 --> 00:20:39.689
complete, you know, it's Finland, you know, this is

425
00:20:39.689 --> 00:20:42.410
a first world country, really wonderful infrastructure, all of

426
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.709
that. Uh, AND so they have the things available

427
00:20:44.709 --> 00:20:46.709
to them for the most part. But the reindeer

428
00:20:46.709 --> 00:20:50.270
herders are really wonderful about incorporating modern technology and

429
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.989
knowledge into their traditional technology and knowledge. And by

430
00:20:53.989 --> 00:20:56.469
traditional, I talk about the reindeer herders and in

431
00:20:56.469 --> 00:20:59.430
particular the indigenous Sami of the region. And there

432
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.670
are Sami all the way from Norway, Sweden, Finland,

433
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.790
and in Russia as well. Um, AND usually the

434
00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.790
Sami are very different from one end to the

435
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.250
other and Like Sami from Norway might not even

436
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.400
understand Sami from Russia, that the dialects are so

437
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.800
wide ranging, um, and so, you know, the reindeer

438
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.560
herders know in certain snow conditions it's better to

439
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.430
wear the reindeer skin boots, but in other snow

440
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.880
conditions it's way better to use the fancy Gore-Tex

441
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.280
boots that you bought at the store, uh, you

442
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.040
know, and depending if it's rain falling or ice

443
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.449
falling or snow falling, they would prefer a reindeer

444
00:21:32.449 --> 00:21:35.280
skin coat or they would prefer, you know, The

445
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.800
typical again Gore-Tex code that you can get when

446
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.280
you ride a snowmobile, um, and so they have

447
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.920
a lot of great ways of incorporating different forms

448
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.150
of technology, uh, at many different levels to to

449
00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.410
to maintain. Their body temperature and their health and

450
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.160
safety in these extreme environments. They're also very aware

451
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.849
of their environment. They are very, very knowledgeable about

452
00:21:56.849 --> 00:22:00.410
the landscape. They're very knowledgeable about changes and what

453
00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:04.260
those changes might indicate about potential dangers coming up.

454
00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:08.660
Um. And they are very knowledgeable about how to

455
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.660
navigate all of that, and they know when to

456
00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.219
say no. Like, right, conditions are getting bad. I'm

457
00:22:15.219 --> 00:22:17.670
not going to push through because that's a deadly

458
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.020
decision in this kind of environment. They know when

459
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.770
to stop, they know when to hunker down, um,

460
00:22:22.869 --> 00:22:25.140
and they're always good about having maps and GPS

461
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.380
units and things like that in case conditions really

462
00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.359
deteriorate in the field. And so, yeah, they manage

463
00:22:30.359 --> 00:22:32.800
it really, really well. And uh one of the

464
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.800
things that we're moving towards with this project is

465
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.930
trying to understand how they are navigating climate change

466
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.349
because the Arctic has, has witnessed climate change earlier

467
00:22:42.349 --> 00:22:44.439
and more acutely than a lot of other places

468
00:22:44.439 --> 00:22:47.560
in the world. And so they have watched their

469
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.469
landscape change. They have watched their weather patterns change,

470
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.869
and it's altering how their Occupation works now compared

471
00:22:54.869 --> 00:22:57.390
to what it was 50, 100 years ago. And

472
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.709
so, uh, a new aim of this study is

473
00:22:59.709 --> 00:23:01.949
trying to understand how climate change not only impacts

474
00:23:01.949 --> 00:23:05.780
their occupation, but also their biology and how it

475
00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.189
might be responding to a cold environment that is

476
00:23:08.189 --> 00:23:10.030
no longer as cold as it used to be.

477
00:23:11.219 --> 00:23:14.219
You know, when I read about your work on

478
00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:19.660
the reindeer herders from Finland, one of the other

479
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.489
people that came to my mind, and I hope

480
00:23:22.489 --> 00:23:27.180
I'm remembering their name correctly, are the Nexs from

481
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:32.180
northern Russia around the Siberia area because they also

482
00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:36.260
sort of build most of their culture at least

483
00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.020
their economy around reindeers,

484
00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.400
right? Mhm. Yeah, and it's an interesting thing too,

485
00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.469
of, of, again, the ways in which people are

486
00:23:44.469 --> 00:23:47.079
accommodating modern times and changes is that, yeah, the

487
00:23:47.079 --> 00:23:50.119
reindeer herders are still reindeer herders, but they've now

488
00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:53.390
started incorporating a whole lot of tourism into their

489
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.959
business because reindeer herding is getting more expensive due

490
00:23:55.959 --> 00:23:58.160
to climate change and supplemental feed and all of

491
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.390
these things. And so now they start running tourists,

492
00:24:01.479 --> 00:24:03.714
uh. Kind of companies of you get to be

493
00:24:03.714 --> 00:24:05.714
a reindeer herder for a day. So come out

494
00:24:05.714 --> 00:24:07.675
to our reindeer herding farm and you can learn

495
00:24:07.675 --> 00:24:09.755
how to be a reindeer herder. Uh, BUT they

496
00:24:09.755 --> 00:24:13.425
will also supplement with forestry and mining jobs as

497
00:24:13.425 --> 00:24:16.114
well, kinds of things. And so there are those

498
00:24:16.114 --> 00:24:18.744
who do nothing but herding as a living, um,

499
00:24:18.834 --> 00:24:20.435
and then there are those who are kind of

500
00:24:20.435 --> 00:24:22.994
part-time herders as well as part-time other things.

501
00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.979
Great. So, by the way, let me ask you

502
00:24:26.979 --> 00:24:31.060
because this is another, probably another misconception that we

503
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:35.250
have to tackle here, these reindeer herders because they

504
00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:41.359
have more fat in their bodies. If we were

505
00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:46.439
to use uh or to calculate their body mass

506
00:24:46.439 --> 00:24:50.819
index, wouldn't they be considered probably obese?

507
00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.910
Yeah, uh, I literally gave a talk about this

508
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:58.170
last night. So that is on my mind. I

509
00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.390
started with them all defining what is body mass

510
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:02.189
index and what do you know about it. Um,

511
00:25:02.229 --> 00:25:04.270
YEAH, so at least with the herders I worked

512
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.069
with, so with with the group of folks that

513
00:25:06.069 --> 00:25:09.510
I took measurements from 75% of them would be

514
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.689
classified as overweight or obese. Based on body mass

515
00:25:12.689 --> 00:25:15.530
index. And, you know, as you know, and this

516
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.030
is why I'm sure you brought it up, is

517
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.250
that we all have these ideas about what your

518
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.810
body mass index means. And that if you fall

519
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.290
within this obese category, you are going to have

520
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.930
cardiovascular disease, you have an increased risk of diabetes,

521
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.010
stroke, cancers, depression, all of these various things that

522
00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:34.089
people attach to this number. Body mass index is

523
00:25:34.089 --> 00:25:38.130
purely your weight divided by your height squared. That's

524
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.810
it. It tells you nothing else about how your

525
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.770
body works or even what that weight is made

526
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:45.010
up of. Is it, are you 10% body fat

527
00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.609
or are you 40% body fat? Those are very

528
00:25:47.609 --> 00:25:49.729
different things and in the ways in which your

529
00:25:49.729 --> 00:25:53.079
body works. Um, AND even body mass index when

530
00:25:53.079 --> 00:25:56.400
it was developed historically by Adolfo Klay, he was

531
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.800
a statistician just interested in population means and finding

532
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.239
ways to describe body shape and size, and he

533
00:26:02.239 --> 00:26:04.640
was explicit in his own publication that this should

534
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.119
not be used for health and determining health and

535
00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:09.760
predicting health, and here we are, you know, basing

536
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.280
insurance premiums and, you know, whether or not somebody

537
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.650
might get a blood test based on BMI. Um,

538
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.439
BUT the interesting part about it, at least with

539
00:26:17.439 --> 00:26:19.770
the herders, is that yes, that 75% of them

540
00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:23.050
were overweight or obese, but their blood biomarkers, so

541
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.609
things like their cholesterol and all the different cholesterols

542
00:26:26.609 --> 00:26:30.050
and their glucose looked really good. They did not

543
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:33.050
look bad the way one might expect given the

544
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.329
propensity for a high BMI in the population.

545
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.839
I mean, this is very interesting because, uh, I,

546
00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:43.849
I mean, when a few years ago, I first

547
00:26:43.849 --> 00:26:47.729
learned about BMI, one of the first things that

548
00:26:47.729 --> 00:26:50.930
came to mind, but I guess I thought it

549
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:54.209
would be a little bit silly to ask the

550
00:26:54.209 --> 00:26:57.810
question to a doctor because probably the, I, I

551
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.520
thought that probably they would make fun of me

552
00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:05.349
is, uh, I mean, aren't Aren't there people who

553
00:27:05.349 --> 00:27:08.310
have, for example, and this is just an example,

554
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:12.469
a very high muscle mass. And so if you

555
00:27:12.469 --> 00:27:16.780
just calculate their BMI they would also be considered

556
00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:20.260
obese, but that doesn't make any sense at all.

557
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.869
Yeah.

558
00:27:21.219 --> 00:27:23.250
I mean, so, I mean, there's always the caveat

559
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.810
here to this example. But if you think of

560
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.410
modern day bodybuilders, if they aren't using steroids that

561
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.569
will destroy their health, this is the caveat. But

562
00:27:31.569 --> 00:27:34.010
if you think of, you know, somebody who's 180

563
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.890
pounds and one's a bodybuilder and one never, you

564
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:39.650
know, lifts a finger ever, there's gonna be a

565
00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:43.250
big difference in what that 180 pounds actually consists

566
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.489
of, whether it's fat or muscle. So that's absolutely

567
00:27:45.489 --> 00:27:48.410
right. Uh, BODY mass index is not taken into

568
00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.209
account body composition.

569
00:27:51.989 --> 00:27:55.869
So, I, I mean, why is it that and

570
00:27:55.869 --> 00:28:00.589
even in medicine, people still uh resort to BMI

571
00:28:00.589 --> 00:28:03.189
so much? I mean, would, shouldn't they resort to

572
00:28:03.189 --> 00:28:06.819
things like, I don't know, abdominal perimeter or something

573
00:28:06.819 --> 00:28:10.510
like that? Isn't that a better health indicator than

574
00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.459
just BMI by itself?

575
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.839
It's easy. BMI is easy. You need the person's

576
00:28:15.839 --> 00:28:18.069
height and you need their weight, and you can

577
00:28:18.069 --> 00:28:20.479
pop it into an online calculator or calculate it

578
00:28:20.479 --> 00:28:23.310
on your phone. That's why it's an easy thing.

579
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.199
You are 100% correct comparing waist circumference to hip

580
00:28:27.199 --> 00:28:29.800
circumference. That is a Much better metric because that

581
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.880
goes back to what we talked about before, is

582
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.810
that kind of lets you know how much visceral

583
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:37.109
fat someone might be containing holding versus the, uh,

584
00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:40.160
subcutaneous. So if they have wider hips, that's more

585
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.760
subcutaneous fat. But if they have a larger stomach,

586
00:28:42.839 --> 00:28:44.319
that's gonna be more visceral fat.

587
00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.709
So, but I mean, do you think that, for

588
00:28:49.709 --> 00:28:55.949
example, in Western populations that perhaps BMI would be

589
00:28:55.949 --> 00:29:01.300
more or much better of an health indicator than,

590
00:29:01.349 --> 00:29:05.750
for example, among uh reindeer herders because they have

591
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:10.670
this sort of physiological slash metabolical adaptation to those

592
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:14.109
kinds of extreme environments or not at all.

593
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.969
I don't, I don't think it's useful and you

594
00:29:16.969 --> 00:29:18.449
know, the problem is we all end up having

595
00:29:18.449 --> 00:29:21.520
to use it to some degree, but BMI, both

596
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.410
when it was initially created and then when it

597
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.800
was tested by Ansel Keys, it was created based

598
00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.209
on studying males from Europe aged 18 to 30

599
00:29:31.209 --> 00:29:34.569
who were in the military. That's not representative of

600
00:29:34.569 --> 00:29:37.040
the global population, that's not representative of the Western

601
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.199
world, um. And then when Ansel Keys did it,

602
00:29:40.209 --> 00:29:42.680
he tested 5 populations, 4 of which were your

603
00:29:42.689 --> 00:29:45.920
your males from European descent, age 18 to 30,

604
00:29:46.089 --> 00:29:48.880
and then one was a Bantu population from Africa.

605
00:29:49.479 --> 00:29:52.599
Guess how BMI held up with the Bantu population.

606
00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:57.719
It didn't. It didn't work. It didn't properly assess

607
00:29:57.719 --> 00:30:00.040
body fat or any sorts of health indicators in

608
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.099
the Bantu population and An keys, it's just like,

609
00:30:02.109 --> 00:30:04.439
yeah, whatever. It works for these four white folks,

610
00:30:04.479 --> 00:30:06.640
so let's just continue along with it. And we

611
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.060
also know it doesn't work well in a Japanese

612
00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.599
population. It typically tends to underestimate body fat in

613
00:30:12.599 --> 00:30:16.229
a Japanese population. It tends to overestimate body fat

614
00:30:16.229 --> 00:30:19.589
um uh among women and especially black women. And

615
00:30:19.589 --> 00:30:21.469
so, in, you know, in, in the western world

616
00:30:21.469 --> 00:30:23.989
in which we are a hodgepodge of people from

617
00:30:23.989 --> 00:30:27.510
all over the globe, BMI I think keeps keeps

618
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.630
losing its importance, and I think we need to

619
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.520
move to a different metric, uh, to, to better

620
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.060
understand how an individual's health is.

621
00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.300
And I was also thinking, and if this doesn't

622
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.349
make sense, please correct me, but isn't it also

623
00:30:41.349 --> 00:30:46.959
the case that even within Uh, western countries, people

624
00:30:46.959 --> 00:30:50.560
live in different kinds of environments and perhaps people

625
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.630
who live in very cold climates, even though they

626
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:57.349
might not get as cold as the climates where,

627
00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.800
uh, reindeer herders live in, but still if they

628
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.640
live in the mountains, for example, that perhaps they

629
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.880
would also have more body fat, but they would

630
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.079
still be healthy.

631
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.150
Then absolutely there's a potential. I don't want there

632
00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.229
to be a blanket that just because you carry

633
00:31:13.229 --> 00:31:15.750
extra fat and cold, you're safe cause that's not

634
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.869
going to be true. Uh, ANYONE who gives you

635
00:31:17.869 --> 00:31:21.709
blanket statements, always be aware they be worried that

636
00:31:21.989 --> 00:31:24.469
there's always gonna be issues. Um, AND I mean

637
00:31:24.469 --> 00:31:26.069
it does seem to be true at least for

638
00:31:26.069 --> 00:31:28.589
now, among the the reindeer herder population and it

639
00:31:28.589 --> 00:31:31.324
could well have been. True. Uh, WHEN you think

640
00:31:31.324 --> 00:31:34.084
of North American cold climate populations, but the effects

641
00:31:34.084 --> 00:31:38.405
of colonialism have been so drastic on North American

642
00:31:38.405 --> 00:31:41.685
cold climate indigenous populations that that connection has been

643
00:31:41.685 --> 00:31:44.364
completely broken between, you know, what would have been

644
00:31:44.364 --> 00:31:48.244
healthy fat and a healthy metabolic profile that basically

645
00:31:48.244 --> 00:31:51.135
doesn't exist anymore because the colonialist influences.

646
00:31:52.319 --> 00:31:54.229
So just to try to make sort of a

647
00:31:54.229 --> 00:31:58.300
segue between the topic of human energetics and the

648
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.660
topic of hunting, which will also, at least to

649
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.729
some extent include energetics here. Are there important sex

650
00:32:06.729 --> 00:32:10.069
differences in human energetics or no?

651
00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.560
There, there are and there aren't, um, and I,

652
00:32:13.619 --> 00:32:17.369
I wanna say. Because my reindeer herders revealed a

653
00:32:17.369 --> 00:32:19.930
wild sex difference that has never been seen before.

654
00:32:20.219 --> 00:32:23.540
Um, WHEN it comes to energetics, there is males

655
00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.619
on average tend to have a higher metabolic rate

656
00:32:25.619 --> 00:32:28.020
than females. However, this is just largely due to

657
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:31.260
differences in size. Uh, SO your resting metabolic rate

658
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.165
correlates most or best with your fat-free masks. Or

659
00:32:35.165 --> 00:32:36.734
you can think of it as your muscle mass,

660
00:32:36.854 --> 00:32:39.474
but it also correlates well with overall body mass.

661
00:32:39.775 --> 00:32:42.974
Males on average are larger than females and tend

662
00:32:42.974 --> 00:32:45.375
to have more muscle mass, again, on average than

663
00:32:45.375 --> 00:32:48.295
females. So, yeah, males have higher metabolic rates, but

664
00:32:48.295 --> 00:32:51.135
once you start controlling for differences in size, there

665
00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:54.185
isn't something innately male that makes the metabolic rate

666
00:32:54.185 --> 00:32:57.189
higher. And so then the giant wrench thrown into

667
00:32:57.189 --> 00:32:59.910
all of this is the reindeer that I worked

668
00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.550
with, uh, so the females are on average 20

669
00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:07.380
kg smaller than the males, which makes sense, like

670
00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.670
that's, that's pretty standard. But they had higher metabolic

671
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:13.339
rates than the males, both relatively when you control

672
00:33:13.339 --> 00:33:17.329
for differences in body size, but also absolutely higher,

673
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.589
so that even when you're not correcting for body

674
00:33:19.589 --> 00:33:22.900
size, these much smaller females had higher metabolic rates

675
00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.790
than the males, and that has never been seen

676
00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:28.219
before and it's absolutely wild. When I saw the

677
00:33:28.219 --> 00:33:29.939
numbers, I was freaked out and like this has

678
00:33:29.939 --> 00:33:32.109
got to be wrong. But then we collected more

679
00:33:32.109 --> 00:33:35.229
data in February 2023, and we, it just strengthened

680
00:33:35.229 --> 00:33:38.270
the result that females did have higher metabolic rates

681
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.630
than the males. um, AND I think this might

682
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:43.790
relate in many ways to both uh better technology

683
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.630
but also climate change. Uh, THAT overall cold stress

684
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.270
is not as cold or stressful anymore in Finland

685
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.270
as the way it used to be, both because

686
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:55.849
of better technology and because of climate change. And

687
00:33:55.849 --> 00:33:58.689
so we might start seeing greater variation in resting

688
00:33:58.689 --> 00:34:01.810
metabolic rate with a with a trend downwards, um,

689
00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.119
as time goes on. And I think females might

690
00:34:05.119 --> 00:34:07.650
be more resistant to that change, or that change

691
00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:09.969
might have to happen over a much longer period

692
00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:12.728
of time than males, uh, because again, to go

693
00:34:12.728 --> 00:34:14.530
back to this idea of resting metabolic rate and

694
00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:18.000
thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone sets the thermostat, kind of

695
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.750
sets your resting metabolic rate, but it is also

696
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:24.429
a critical hormone during the early stages of pregnancy,

697
00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.770
that if an individual who is pregnant cannot increase

698
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.360
their thyroid hormone during the 1st 10 weeks of

699
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.040
pregnancy, that will very likely result in a miscarriage.

700
00:34:34.509 --> 00:34:37.217
And so if you imagine a cold climate population

701
00:34:37.217 --> 00:34:40.518
individual, they're operating at a higher baseline, uh, just

702
00:34:40.668 --> 00:34:42.349
on their own. And then once they get pregnant,

703
00:34:42.428 --> 00:34:45.089
they still have to elevate well above that baseline.

704
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:48.868
If that baseline starts shifting, the, the, the upper

705
00:34:48.868 --> 00:34:51.739
amount that needed for pregnancy might not shift down

706
00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:55.268
accordingly. And so that would put pregnancies, successful pregnancies

707
00:34:55.268 --> 00:34:57.879
at greater risk of failure. Uh, AND So I

708
00:34:57.879 --> 00:34:59.909
think females might be more resistant to that change

709
00:34:59.909 --> 00:35:02.580
or slower to change in response to it in

710
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:06.760
order to, to maintain, um, reproductive capacity to some

711
00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.399
degree. But we don't know. Um, WE, we measured

712
00:35:09.399 --> 00:35:11.760
it in February of 2023, and we do see

713
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.719
higher T4, uh, levels among female herders compared to

714
00:35:15.719 --> 00:35:17.639
all other groups that we've looked at. And so

715
00:35:17.639 --> 00:35:19.639
we're gonna continue that for the next 3 years

716
00:35:19.639 --> 00:35:20.560
to get a lot more data.

717
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.679
Do these average differences that you pointed to at

718
00:35:25.679 --> 00:35:29.959
the beginning of your answer are correlate, are they

719
00:35:29.959 --> 00:35:34.000
correlated in any way with hormonal differences, like, for

720
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.679
example, men on average having higher levels of testosterone

721
00:35:37.679 --> 00:35:41.840
and women higher levels of estrogen. I mean, I'm

722
00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:46.120
not. SAYING, uh, that it would have directly to

723
00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.080
do with that because I'm not sure to what

724
00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.320
extent, uh, hormones like testosterone or estrogen play a

725
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.320
role directly in metabolic rates, but perhaps indirectly through

726
00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.639
producing, in the case of testosterone, higher muscle mass

727
00:36:01.639 --> 00:36:02.679
and stuff like that.

728
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.209
You answered part of it already, which is exactly

729
00:36:05.209 --> 00:36:08.100
that, that we sadly know far more about testosterone

730
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.300
and these things than we do estrogen. Uh, BUT

731
00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.179
yeah, so it would be indirectly through, you know,

732
00:36:12.429 --> 00:36:15.129
more muscle mass from testosterone and growth hormone as

733
00:36:15.129 --> 00:36:17.659
well. Uh, THERE could also be an indirect effect

734
00:36:17.659 --> 00:36:21.899
with estrogen because estrogen actually, uh, increases the number

735
00:36:21.899 --> 00:36:26.379
of receptors for testosterone and growth hormones. So estrogen

736
00:36:26.379 --> 00:36:28.935
has a positive effect on muscle increases. As well.

737
00:36:29.425 --> 00:36:31.705
One thing that we are starting to at least

738
00:36:31.705 --> 00:36:33.425
think we see, and this is not my work,

739
00:36:33.504 --> 00:36:36.784
this is, uh, Edma Lanson out in Colorado, um,

740
00:36:37.125 --> 00:36:39.645
that estrogen might have a big impact on brown

741
00:36:39.645 --> 00:36:43.324
adipose tissue. That more estrogen might mean more brown

742
00:36:43.324 --> 00:36:46.334
fat, uh, but that, that work is still ongoing,

743
00:36:46.425 --> 00:36:48.824
but there is some indication that estrogen could have

744
00:36:48.824 --> 00:36:51.864
a positive effect on brown adipose tissue. So that

745
00:36:51.864 --> 00:36:53.425
would also increase metabolic rate.

746
00:36:54.669 --> 00:36:59.610
So let's get into the contentious topic of hunting.

747
00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.500
The amazing thing is that this should not be

748
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.610
contentious at all, but you know, here we are.

749
00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.899
Well, well, let me just say that and we'll

750
00:37:09.899 --> 00:37:12.540
come back to this point toward the end of

751
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.090
our conversation, but let me just say that. Uh,

752
00:37:16.179 --> 00:37:20.899
I don't think that among, uh, anthropologists who take

753
00:37:20.899 --> 00:37:24.419
the discussion seriously, it is that contentious. I mean,

754
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:28.100
they are mostly discussing some of the details there,

755
00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:32.459
but I don't think that many people get that

756
00:37:32.459 --> 00:37:33.729
riled up,

757
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.530
get riled so many feelings about this. Well,

758
00:37:39.659 --> 00:37:43.219
I, I, I mean, let, let's see, let's discuss

759
00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:46.570
that, but Uh, where the, just to introduce the

760
00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:50.860
topic, where does this idea of man the hunter

761
00:37:51.139 --> 00:37:54.520
comes from and where is it exactly?

762
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.510
Yeah, so I mean there's been a couple of

763
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:59.139
different formulations, but honestly I mean it even goes

764
00:37:59.139 --> 00:38:02.500
back to the days of Darwin and Herbert Spencer,

765
00:38:02.709 --> 00:38:04.189
you know, when you think it's not so much

766
00:38:04.189 --> 00:38:06.270
the origin of Species, everyone knows about the origin

767
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:09.270
of Species, uh, but Darwin's second book, The Descent

768
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.909
of Man, uh, is where he started exploring in

769
00:38:11.909 --> 00:38:17.340
particular, um, differences in Secondary sex characteristics. And so

770
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:21.350
the most common non-human example is the peacock. Male

771
00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:24.149
peacocks have these crazy fancy tails, and they're very,

772
00:38:24.179 --> 00:38:27.110
very colorful, whereas the peahen, which is the female

773
00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:30.110
version of peafowl, um, are like brown and, you

774
00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.429
know, quote unquote boring. And that's a big difference,

775
00:38:32.629 --> 00:38:35.919
especially as a bird. If you are brightly colored

776
00:38:35.919 --> 00:38:37.889
and you have to carry around this giant heavy

777
00:38:37.889 --> 00:38:40.280
tail, that is a big eat me sign to

778
00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.280
any predator. It's the kind of thing like why

779
00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:46.159
would you do this evolutionarily, um, and you know

780
00:38:46.159 --> 00:38:47.879
Darwin was talking about the ways in which this

781
00:38:47.879 --> 00:38:51.010
would demonstrate, you know, a healthy individual that could

782
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.790
not only grow a fancy tail and pretty feathers,

783
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.560
but also evade predators, and that would be a

784
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.399
signal to a pea hen that this is someone

785
00:38:59.399 --> 00:39:01.280
I might want to mate with. So he was

786
00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.745
interested in sexual selection. Uh, AND that's kind of

787
00:39:03.745 --> 00:39:05.584
a big chunk of what the descent of man

788
00:39:05.584 --> 00:39:08.534
was about. And, you know, he recognized a lot

789
00:39:08.534 --> 00:39:11.945
of it within the animal kingdom being female choice,

790
00:39:12.024 --> 00:39:15.665
that it was females choosing males. But then that

791
00:39:15.665 --> 00:39:18.875
disappeared in Darwin's kind of view once he started

792
00:39:18.875 --> 00:39:21.375
talking about humans and that everything was more driven

793
00:39:21.375 --> 00:39:24.064
by males rather than females. So it was this

794
00:39:24.064 --> 00:39:26.705
kind of like very female dominant thing when it

795
00:39:26.705 --> 00:39:29.104
comes to non-humans, but the moment we get to

796
00:39:29.104 --> 00:39:32.040
humans, he switched it. And a lot of this

797
00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.350
has to do with the Victorian ideals of the

798
00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:36.159
time that he was living in, that, you know,

799
00:39:36.239 --> 00:39:39.439
females were passive and submissive, and they should only

800
00:39:39.439 --> 00:39:42.709
concern themselves with duties of the household, domestic duties.

801
00:39:42.919 --> 00:39:46.459
And they are, they are not very intelligent, right?

802
00:39:46.719 --> 00:39:47.070
Correct,

803
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.919
because why you don't need to be intelligent to

804
00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:51.370
pop babies out. And you know, maintain the household

805
00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:54.340
and in this Victorian view, uh, so for folks

806
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.739
at home, these are not my views. This is

807
00:39:55.739 --> 00:40:01.300
a Victorian view, yeah, it's, yeah, I have been

808
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.020
quoted out of context before, of which I'm describing

809
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.820
Victorian views, and they are saying that that's what

810
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.250
I'm saying about women today. I'm like. Can you

811
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:13.090
read? Is that reading comprehension like, anyway, um, and

812
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:15.610
so yeah, and that all this innovation is driven

813
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:18.610
by males, and there's this kind of idea and

814
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.090
you know, Darwin even touches on it, but not

815
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:24.409
extensively, but even within our evolutionary past that it

816
00:40:24.409 --> 00:40:27.770
was males developing the tools and the weapons that

817
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:30.610
are kind of the hallmarks of human evolution and

818
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:33.489
that these were specifically used for things like hunting

819
00:40:33.489 --> 00:40:37.324
to provide for the family, um, and Even Darwin

820
00:40:37.324 --> 00:40:39.564
and, you know, Herbert Spencer talking about these things

821
00:40:39.564 --> 00:40:42.685
too, of that, like, it's always been about, they

822
00:40:42.685 --> 00:40:44.885
have this idea that monogamy, that you have, you

823
00:40:44.885 --> 00:40:49.245
know, female, male, isolated pairs within, you know, the

824
00:40:49.245 --> 00:40:52.405
family unit, has a very deep origin in their

825
00:40:52.405 --> 00:40:54.604
mind. And so that monogamy existed for quite some

826
00:40:54.604 --> 00:40:57.364
time. Um, AND that it was hunting and tools,

827
00:40:57.405 --> 00:40:59.725
and it was men using these tools to hunt,

828
00:40:59.764 --> 00:41:02.165
to provide the meat and all of that, that

829
00:41:02.165 --> 00:41:04.475
allowed us to be the humans we are today.

830
00:41:04.804 --> 00:41:08.070
Yeah. And so that fit well within Victorian thinking

831
00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:10.090
of, you know, the sexual division of labor and

832
00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.760
and sex roles, uh, and that kind of continued

833
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.360
on and there's other things we could talk about

834
00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.439
with that too, uh, but it became very formalized

835
00:41:17.439 --> 00:41:22.219
within anthropology in the 1960s. So in 1966, uh,

836
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.239
Lee and Devore held a conference that was sponsored

837
00:41:25.239 --> 00:41:27.760
by the Winter Gren Foundation called Man the Hunter.

838
00:41:28.449 --> 00:41:31.379
And so I, I, I have been accused of

839
00:41:31.379 --> 00:41:33.500
mischaracterizing Man the Hunter, and so I'm gonna be

840
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.379
much more specific about it when I, when I

841
00:41:35.379 --> 00:41:37.699
talk about it in this context. Uh, BUT the,

842
00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.959
the, the main goal of that man the Hunter

843
00:41:40.959 --> 00:41:43.419
conference and then the edited volume that came two

844
00:41:43.419 --> 00:41:46.649
years later was to kind of be a, a,

845
00:41:46.679 --> 00:41:49.659
a review, a broad overview of what we know

846
00:41:49.659 --> 00:41:52.939
about modern hunter gatherers at the time. So by

847
00:41:52.939 --> 00:41:56.090
the 1960s, so not today today. Um, AND so

848
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.689
it was, you know, the majority of the chapters

849
00:41:58.689 --> 00:42:02.290
were about modern hunter gatherers of the time, and,

850
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:03.850
you know, there was a little bit about sexual

851
00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:05.530
division of labor and there was a focus on

852
00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:07.620
hunting and some of them. But then there are

853
00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.810
these three chapters a little bit later on in

854
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:12.889
the edited volume, uh, the big ones by, uh,

855
00:42:12.899 --> 00:42:16.050
Washburn and Lancaster is one chapter, and then the

856
00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:19.370
other chapters by Laughlin. They talk about the importance

857
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.580
of hunting to human evolution. And this is really

858
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.179
where the biggest issue, I, I think comes from

859
00:42:25.179 --> 00:42:27.500
the man, the hunter idea, uh, and I know

860
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.739
Lee and Devore themselves kind of disagreed with a

861
00:42:29.739 --> 00:42:32.010
lot of it, but they did edit the book

862
00:42:32.219 --> 00:42:34.820
and OK those chapters to go into that book,

863
00:42:34.939 --> 00:42:38.189
so they are not completely faultless here. Uh, BUT

864
00:42:38.189 --> 00:42:41.790
these two chapters were very specifically hunting is the

865
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:44.489
reason that we are who we are today. All

866
00:42:44.489 --> 00:42:47.110
of the features that separate us from, you know,

867
00:42:47.229 --> 00:42:51.030
our, our nonhuman primate cousins, or chimpanzees, is because

868
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:54.149
of hunting. Uh, HUNTING required us to be highly

869
00:42:54.149 --> 00:42:56.870
social, to coordinate it. So we also needed bigger

870
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:59.110
brains to be able to do that social coordination

871
00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:02.709
and planning. Hunting also required really fancy tools to

872
00:43:02.709 --> 00:43:05.100
be able to take down and prepare those animals,

873
00:43:05.229 --> 00:43:06.830
which you also needed a big brain to be

874
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:08.989
able to do. And then hunting also needed you

875
00:43:08.989 --> 00:43:10.879
to be physically strong and active and have a

876
00:43:10.879 --> 00:43:13.750
lot of endurance to actually do the physical hunting

877
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.290
itself. And so the idea was, is that everything

878
00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:18.729
that made us human was because of hunting, and

879
00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:21.810
hunting was only done by men. That's the man,

880
00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.989
the hunter kind of idea in a nutshell. Um,

881
00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.260
AND that has persisted to this day is all

882
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.090
you gotta do is go on Twitter right now

883
00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.699
and type in man the hunter, and you'll see

884
00:43:31.699 --> 00:43:33.899
the freak out about people, the idea that women

885
00:43:33.899 --> 00:43:37.004
may have hunted. Um, IT'S still very Persistent. It's

886
00:43:37.004 --> 00:43:38.764
what I grew up with too. I, I mean,

887
00:43:38.804 --> 00:43:41.205
if you think about the, the comic books, cartoons,

888
00:43:41.405 --> 00:43:45.004
movies, TV shows, whatever, anytime you see the, the,

889
00:43:45.024 --> 00:43:48.245
the prehistoric past depicted, it's men doing the hunting

890
00:43:48.245 --> 00:43:50.205
and women are in the cave tending the fire

891
00:43:50.205 --> 00:43:53.044
in the babies. That is the, the majority. And

892
00:43:53.044 --> 00:43:55.524
there have actually been studies on this too, looking

893
00:43:55.524 --> 00:43:57.604
at the percentage of who was doing what in

894
00:43:57.604 --> 00:44:00.205
various depictions of human evolution. And it's the men

895
00:44:00.205 --> 00:44:03.245
being active hunters and the female being passive caretakers.

896
00:44:04.159 --> 00:44:06.899
But let me ask you this specific question. By

897
00:44:06.899 --> 00:44:13.070
hunting, do they mean just, uh, hunting big game

898
00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:16.149
or also small game? Because I guess that's an

899
00:44:16.149 --> 00:44:17.439
important thing.

900
00:44:17.479 --> 00:44:17.909
It's an

901
00:44:17.909 --> 00:44:18.280
important

902
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.550
distinction, but here's the thing, Ricardo, which is amazing,

903
00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.080
is that there was never a solid definition put

904
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:29.669
forward of hunting. In Man the Hunter. It's, it's

905
00:44:29.669 --> 00:44:32.229
kind of defined in different ways and utilized in

906
00:44:32.229 --> 00:44:34.409
different ways. And so there's a really interesting chapter

907
00:44:34.409 --> 00:44:36.790
about the Ainu by Watanabe in the Man the

908
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:38.389
Hunter, and this is one like looking at the

909
00:44:38.389 --> 00:44:41.709
modern hunter gatherers at the time and um these

910
00:44:41.709 --> 00:44:44.330
are a group of indigenous folks in islands around

911
00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:49.239
Japan and Women and men are hunting in the

912
00:44:49.239 --> 00:44:52.040
Ainu, like they both are, and he even says

913
00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.959
that in the chapter, but then he decides to

914
00:44:53.959 --> 00:44:56.739
focus on the big game hunting only, and that's

915
00:44:56.739 --> 00:45:00.280
only males doing it, ignoring the deer, which how

916
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.159
deer are not necessarily considered maybe medium game, but

917
00:45:03.159 --> 00:45:07.040
that's still I would think larger anyway, um. He

918
00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.550
decides to focus on big game hunting only as

919
00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.590
as an important part of their culture and then

920
00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:15.229
completely ignores the fact that women are hunting too,

921
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.120
and that even the majority of the hunting is

922
00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:20.590
not big game hunting because that's not as reliable.

923
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.840
There aren't as many and it is much harder

924
00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.600
to do and the success rate for big game

925
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.479
hunting is actually really low. It is the smaller

926
00:45:27.479 --> 00:45:31.110
to medium game that's far more reliable resource, um,

927
00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.360
and that everyone's kind of doing that, but it

928
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:33.959
gets ignored.

929
00:45:34.229 --> 00:45:36.699
Yeah. So let me just ask you this before

930
00:45:36.699 --> 00:45:40.060
we get into your set of papers on the

931
00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:46.100
archaeological and physiological evidence for uh women also participating

932
00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:51.530
in hunting. So, nowadays, uh, are there still many

933
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:56.610
people, anthropologists who work on hunting that claim that

934
00:45:57.139 --> 00:46:02.169
all the hunting. Including small game is done by

935
00:46:02.169 --> 00:46:04.750
men, or is that something that I already went

936
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:04.760
beyond.

937
00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:09.570
I do not think that you could find and

938
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:11.659
maybe you can. Maybe I should be careful. I,

939
00:46:11.689 --> 00:46:14.080
I don't think you should be able to find

940
00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.489
anyone, you know, the behavioral ecologists who do a

941
00:46:16.489 --> 00:46:18.389
lot of work with modern day hunter gatherers and

942
00:46:18.389 --> 00:46:20.199
the, uh, you know, the ethnographers who do as

943
00:46:20.199 --> 00:46:23.870
well. Women are doing small game hunting. By and

944
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:26.989
large, the vast majority of modern day hunter gatherers,

945
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.590
the big game hunting is done by men. This

946
00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:32.419
is true and never anything that I refute whatsoever,

947
00:46:32.669 --> 00:46:35.709
but that's not true for all modern day hunter

948
00:46:35.709 --> 00:46:38.729
gatherers. It is not a universal. So there are

949
00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:42.159
exceptions to that for sure, uh, but women are,

950
00:46:42.209 --> 00:46:44.810
are well documented doing trapping, which some people don't

951
00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:48.679
consider hunting, um, as well as hunting small game,

952
00:46:48.889 --> 00:46:50.929
which some people for some reason don't consider hunting

953
00:46:50.929 --> 00:46:53.169
either. They call it small game foraging, and I

954
00:46:53.169 --> 00:46:58.020
don't fully unders. Stand that distinction, but whatever. Um,

955
00:46:58.229 --> 00:47:01.389
SO yeah, by and large modern day hunter gatherers,

956
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:04.080
large game big game hunting is meant for males,

957
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:06.750
uh, and females can take part in large big

958
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.909
game hunting that we do see in some populations,

959
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:11.199
but they are also getting small game as well.

960
00:47:12.239 --> 00:47:15.030
I mean, let me just laugh a little bit

961
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:19.709
because small small game foraging sounds sort of funny

962
00:47:19.709 --> 00:47:23.070
because it sounds like women are still going out

963
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.659
there just to gather things,

964
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:28.709
just pluck these animals out of a tree like

965
00:47:28.709 --> 00:47:31.949
an apple. Like, you know, it's, it's one of

966
00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:34.989
those absurd distinctions that only serve the purpose of

967
00:47:34.989 --> 00:47:37.189
trying to put big game hunting higher on a

968
00:47:37.189 --> 00:47:40.235
hierarchy. They're trying to distinguish it as You know,

969
00:47:40.334 --> 00:47:43.715
a better thing than, you know, the more reliable

970
00:47:43.715 --> 00:47:45.955
resource that people can get. That's still hunting. I

971
00:47:45.955 --> 00:47:48.754
don't, you know, let's go find the Daegu tree

972
00:47:48.754 --> 00:47:51.395
or, you know, I need to pick Daegus and

973
00:47:51.395 --> 00:47:53.594
eat them off of a tree. It's absurd. Sorry.

974
00:47:55.054 --> 00:47:57.594
Um, I, I guess that small animals just get

975
00:47:57.594 --> 00:48:01.064
mesmerized when they see a woman and they just,

976
00:48:01.475 --> 00:48:03.274
they just let them beat them.

977
00:48:03.435 --> 00:48:06.715
They just jump right in the basket. Please eat

978
00:48:06.715 --> 00:48:07.584
me. Yeah.

979
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.750
Oh, OK. So let's get into your papers then.

980
00:48:11.879 --> 00:48:17.790
So you present both archaeological and physiological evidence, uh,

981
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:22.479
that you suggest points toward women having perhaps a

982
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:28.030
higher participation in hunting than people have normally suggested.

983
00:48:28.199 --> 00:48:32.320
So, could you walk us through the main points

984
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.520
there in when it comes to the archaeological and

985
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.110
the physiological evidence?

986
00:48:37.409 --> 00:48:38.919
And so this is how I always wanna make

987
00:48:38.919 --> 00:48:40.879
sure I set it up that like I just

988
00:48:40.879 --> 00:48:43.439
said, modern day hunter gatherers, the majority, it's men

989
00:48:43.439 --> 00:48:46.060
doing big game hunting. And what we were talking

990
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.379
about specifically within these two papers is looking at

991
00:48:48.379 --> 00:48:51.580
the Middle Paleolithic. So we're talking like 11,000 years

992
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.699
to what, like, I don't know, 150,000 years kind

993
00:48:53.699 --> 00:48:55.659
of thing. So deeper in the past. So we

994
00:48:55.659 --> 00:48:59.060
are not talking about modern people here. Um, AND

995
00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.500
we wanted to address both the archaeological evidence, which

996
00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:05.020
is pretty unequivocal actually on this, uh, but also

997
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.719
one of the big things that Darwin and, uh,

998
00:49:07.739 --> 00:49:09.739
Herbert Spencer, and then of course, going back to

999
00:49:09.739 --> 00:49:12.219
Man the Hunter, Washburn, Lancaster and Laughlin, all of

1000
00:49:12.219 --> 00:49:15.540
that. One of their big contentions was that women

1001
00:49:15.629 --> 00:49:19.429
would not have been physically or physiologically capable of

1002
00:49:19.429 --> 00:49:23.989
carrying out hunting because of the demands of pregnancy,

1003
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.310
lactation and child rearing, that they in a way

1004
00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:31.070
that women are considered handicapped and just incapable of

1005
00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:33.429
actually carrying out these tasks. And so we wanted

1006
00:49:33.429 --> 00:49:35.489
to address both of that from the archaeological record

1007
00:49:35.489 --> 00:49:37.580
as well as the physiological record to to to

1008
00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:40.270
to make sure we're talking about it. And so.

1009
00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.129
Which one do you want to hear about first?

1010
00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:42.820
Archaeology.

1011
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:46.620
Let's go with the archaeological baby. So

1012
00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.830
the archaeological record is pretty great with this. And,

1013
00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:50.199
and, you know, what we do have, and you

1014
00:49:50.199 --> 00:49:52.149
always have to be careful with the archaeological record

1015
00:49:52.149 --> 00:49:54.100
because you are stuck with what you found, which

1016
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:58.419
might not necessarily be representative of everywhere or even

1017
00:49:58.419 --> 00:50:01.580
throughout time there. The ways in which we figure

1018
00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.500
out people were hunting. So evidence that we look

1019
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.419
for that hunting exists, period, is you look for

1020
00:50:07.419 --> 00:50:09.780
marks on animal bones that would indicate that they're

1021
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:12.449
doing something. You look for stone tools that are

1022
00:50:12.449 --> 00:50:14.889
likely more or more likely to be used as

1023
00:50:14.889 --> 00:50:17.489
weapons rather than like, you know, a tool to

1024
00:50:17.489 --> 00:50:19.679
create a hole in skins or dig or things

1025
00:50:19.679 --> 00:50:22.689
like that. So, hunting tools, um, but then you

1026
00:50:22.689 --> 00:50:24.729
take a look at the signatures in the bones

1027
00:50:24.729 --> 00:50:27.500
of the people that we find. And there's some

1028
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.659
very specific things that you can look for. One,

1029
00:50:29.699 --> 00:50:31.860
you can look at injury patterns to see what

1030
00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.979
kinds of injuries they're they're coming across on a

1031
00:50:33.979 --> 00:50:36.570
day to day basis or monthly basis or whatever.

1032
00:50:36.979 --> 00:50:39.379
And the other is use wear patterns. And so

1033
00:50:39.379 --> 00:50:41.600
the best way a modern example of a use

1034
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.260
wear pattern is if I were to see an

1035
00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:46.459
X-ray of a tennis player, just looking at the

1036
00:50:46.459 --> 00:50:48.580
X-ray, I could tell you which arm was the

1037
00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:52.169
racket arm. Because that bone, the, the whichever side,

1038
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:54.010
their humerus, the upper bone is going to be

1039
00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:57.850
larger and thicker than their non-racket side. And if

1040
00:50:57.850 --> 00:50:59.449
you take a closer look, you can also see

1041
00:50:59.449 --> 00:51:03.810
there's probably greater arthritis and larger muscle attachments on

1042
00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:06.879
the racket arm than on the non-racket arm. And

1043
00:51:06.879 --> 00:51:08.560
that's exactly the kind of thing that we can

1044
00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.320
see in the fossil record as well. We can

1045
00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.399
take a look at asymmetry between the left arm

1046
00:51:12.399 --> 00:51:13.719
and the right arm to see if they're doing

1047
00:51:13.719 --> 00:51:16.280
a certain motion over and over again. And then

1048
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.239
we can use modern day records to see like,

1049
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.639
right, we see these signs. If we see these

1050
00:51:20.639 --> 00:51:22.969
signs in a modern population, what activity is leading

1051
00:51:22.969 --> 00:51:24.879
to that? So if it's throwing or if it's

1052
00:51:24.879 --> 00:51:26.639
thrusting or if it's a bow and arrow, things

1053
00:51:26.639 --> 00:51:28.959
like that, we do have modern correlates to know

1054
00:51:28.959 --> 00:51:31.360
what those signs on the bones look like to

1055
00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.159
then see if we can find those signs on

1056
00:51:33.159 --> 00:51:36.080
the bones in our past in the middle Paleolithic.

1057
00:51:36.889 --> 00:51:40.709
And so, we see no difference in injuries or

1058
00:51:40.709 --> 00:51:43.189
you wear patterns between females and males in the

1059
00:51:43.189 --> 00:51:46.350
middle Paleolithic. They have the same injury rates, they

1060
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:48.350
have the same injury patterns, and they have the

1061
00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:51.860
same use-war patterns, which means they were all doing

1062
00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:55.709
everything, both females and males in terms of day

1063
00:51:55.709 --> 00:51:57.750
to day activities. And when it comes down to

1064
00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.189
it, the only real true sexual division of labor

1065
00:52:00.189 --> 00:52:03.149
that exists and one that is inescapable is pregnancy

1066
00:52:03.149 --> 00:52:06.760
and lactation. But beyond that, There doesn't have to

1067
00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.639
be or need to be a sexual division of

1068
00:52:08.639 --> 00:52:10.959
labor, and it is very likely that in the

1069
00:52:10.959 --> 00:52:15.000
middle Paleolithic these human populations were too small to

1070
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.439
have a sexual division of labor. They didn't have

1071
00:52:17.439 --> 00:52:19.270
enough people who could do different activities.

1072
00:52:19.659 --> 00:52:21.899
So we'll get more into that. Let me just

1073
00:52:21.899 --> 00:52:24.580
ask you at this point because I guess, uh,

1074
00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:28.100
I've already had discussions on some of the issues

1075
00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:32.580
surrounding archaeological records on the show. For example, when

1076
00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:36.179
it comes to the evolution of warfare in human

1077
00:52:36.179 --> 00:52:39.810
societies, that's a very big one. So for, just

1078
00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:43.020
to give an example, Steven Pinker in one of

1079
00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:47.070
his books presents evidence from what seems to be

1080
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:52.031
a diverse set of. Societies across the globe that,

1081
00:52:52.152 --> 00:52:55.832
that would point to higher rates of violence in

1082
00:52:55.832 --> 00:53:01.751
traditional societies versus more modern industrialized societies. But then

1083
00:53:01.751 --> 00:53:06.552
Brian Ferguson went back and criticized basically all of

1084
00:53:06.552 --> 00:53:09.191
those sites. So, in this particular case, let me

1085
00:53:09.191 --> 00:53:13.701
ask you, how diverse is the set of, uh,

1086
00:53:13.711 --> 00:53:18.072
archaeological records or remains that we have to really,

1087
00:53:18.461 --> 00:53:22.464
uh, establish. uh, THE claims.

1088
00:53:22.884 --> 00:53:24.444
Yeah, it's a hard one. And I mean, I'll

1089
00:53:24.444 --> 00:53:25.964
be honest, and this is true with any fossil

1090
00:53:25.964 --> 00:53:27.434
record is we are left with what we're left

1091
00:53:27.434 --> 00:53:29.043
with. And so you're not going to get thousands

1092
00:53:29.043 --> 00:53:31.763
upon thousands of individuals to do this big broad,

1093
00:53:31.964 --> 00:53:34.884
you know, meta-analysis. We have what we have. What

1094
00:53:34.884 --> 00:53:38.523
we have, if it is truly representative, females are

1095
00:53:38.523 --> 00:53:40.364
doing the same things that males are, and males

1096
00:53:40.364 --> 00:53:42.714
are doing the same things that females are. Um,

1097
00:53:42.924 --> 00:53:44.483
ONE of the really best indicators, and now I

1098
00:53:44.483 --> 00:53:46.083
can't remember the number off the top of my

1099
00:53:46.083 --> 00:53:49.615
head, um, but looking at teeth in particular. Tall

1100
00:53:49.615 --> 00:53:53.696
teeth. Uh, Neanderthals and modern humans totally interbred. We

1101
00:53:53.696 --> 00:53:55.246
all have a little bit of Neanderthal in us,

1102
00:53:55.256 --> 00:53:56.775
and I, I kind of consider them the same

1103
00:53:56.775 --> 00:53:59.736
species cause by species definition, you have to be

1104
00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:02.565
able to reproduce and make offspring who can also

1105
00:54:02.565 --> 00:54:05.095
reproduce. And we clearly did that. And so I

1106
00:54:05.095 --> 00:54:08.375
don't see that as two different species. Um, THEY

1107
00:54:08.375 --> 00:54:11.535
had a very interesting way of preparing animal hides

1108
00:54:11.535 --> 00:54:13.176
in which they would put, they would hold one

1109
00:54:13.176 --> 00:54:14.736
end of the hide in their mouth with their

1110
00:54:14.736 --> 00:54:16.496
teeth and then stretch it out with one hand

1111
00:54:16.496 --> 00:54:18.055
and then use the free hand to like scrape

1112
00:54:18.055 --> 00:54:20.560
sinew off the hide. And you got this very

1113
00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:23.239
weird dental pattern from it where like the fronts

1114
00:54:23.239 --> 00:54:25.239
of the teeth kind of like jut off at

1115
00:54:25.239 --> 00:54:27.739
an angle because of the wear from the hides.

1116
00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.280
And there's this massive sample of teeth and you

1117
00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:33.280
could not separate people who did or did not

1118
00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.800
do all of the leather preparation that way. They

1119
00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.520
were all doing it. Everybody. And that was a

1120
00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.600
mixed sample of males and females, and you couldn't

1121
00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.280
clearly say these were the hide prepares and these

1122
00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.580
weren't the hide prepares. And I use this as

1123
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.334
a specific example. Because traditionally, in the idea of

1124
00:54:47.334 --> 00:54:50.814
man the hunter, hide preparation was a domestic female

1125
00:54:50.814 --> 00:54:54.165
duty and not something males did, but we see

1126
00:54:54.165 --> 00:54:58.155
evidence for males doing hide preparation among males, um,

1127
00:54:58.215 --> 00:55:01.205
as well as females. Uh, AND so what we

1128
00:55:01.205 --> 00:55:05.659
have indicates. No sexual division of labor until we

1129
00:55:05.659 --> 00:55:08.500
start pushing it around 35, 40,000 years ago, we

1130
00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:11.500
start seeing a little bit more throwers elbow in

1131
00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:14.419
males than in females. Females still show it, but

1132
00:55:14.419 --> 00:55:17.139
there is a greater preponderance in males. Uh, BUT

1133
00:55:17.139 --> 00:55:20.530
we don't see an explosion of evidence, uh, for

1134
00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:23.260
sexual division of labor until around 11,000 years ago

1135
00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:27.189
when populations got bigger. And more sedentary, where you

1136
00:55:27.189 --> 00:55:29.189
could actually have enough people to split up the

1137
00:55:29.189 --> 00:55:32.949
duties between different things, hunting, um, and also when

1138
00:55:32.949 --> 00:55:35.510
you have a more sedentary population to go back

1139
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:38.469
to energetics, you're not expending as many calories from

1140
00:55:38.469 --> 00:55:40.989
day to day. So they likely may have been

1141
00:55:40.989 --> 00:55:43.989
able to increase the reproductive output as well during

1142
00:55:43.989 --> 00:55:46.620
that time, which means females may have been more

1143
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:49.830
settled with pregnancy and lactation if they're having children

1144
00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.909
at a faster pace than they had, you know,

1145
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.340
in previous generations.

1146
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:58.709
So 11,000 years ago, are we already talking about,

1147
00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:04.120
at least in certain places, Neolithic societies or

1148
00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:07.000
yeah, moving into that age and you know, agriculture

1149
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.060
starts being a bit of a thing, uh, and,

1150
00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:11.379
and it really seem to be the advent of

1151
00:56:11.379 --> 00:56:14.459
sedentism, not moving from place to place, and agriculture

1152
00:56:14.459 --> 00:56:15.659
and a lot of that does have to kind

1153
00:56:15.659 --> 00:56:19.060
of go together, uh, that enabled the sexual division

1154
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.639
of labor to take root and was probably beneficial

1155
00:56:21.639 --> 00:56:24.649
if you think of beneficial as producing more babies.

1156
00:56:25.129 --> 00:56:28.739
Mhm. So tell us now then about the main

1157
00:56:28.739 --> 00:56:33.379
points that you see coming from the physiological evidence.

1158
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:36.489
Yeah, so this is the thing that of course

1159
00:56:36.489 --> 00:56:38.449
we wanted to address because, you know, everyone saying,

1160
00:56:38.489 --> 00:56:41.370
well, men are stronger and faster. I am not

1161
00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:43.449
here to tell you that there are not average

1162
00:56:43.449 --> 00:56:47.449
sex differences in speed and strength. That is absolutely

1163
00:56:47.449 --> 00:56:49.530
true. There is overlap. There are going to be

1164
00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:51.489
females who are well within the male range and

1165
00:56:51.489 --> 00:56:53.810
males well within the female range. There is a

1166
00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:57.639
distribution with overlap, um. What I'm telling you is

1167
00:56:57.639 --> 00:57:00.399
that the idea of maximal speed and maximal strength

1168
00:57:00.399 --> 00:57:03.040
actually do not play a role in in in

1169
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.840
hunting like at all. Uh, HUNTING was much more

1170
00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.120
of a long slog than it was anything else

1171
00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.879
when you think of persistence hunting, um, and even

1172
00:57:11.879 --> 00:57:15.239
still, humans are kind of weak. I, I, I'm

1173
00:57:15.239 --> 00:57:16.840
not, I'm not lying here like in the end

1174
00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.800
we're we're pretty slow. And we're pretty weak and

1175
00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:22.560
we're pretty fragile. And really the only way that

1176
00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:25.520
we were able to hunt period was through cooperation

1177
00:57:25.879 --> 00:57:28.239
and tools. It was through our brains and our

1178
00:57:28.239 --> 00:57:30.479
innovation that we were actually able to make hunting

1179
00:57:30.479 --> 00:57:33.919
possible to begin with. We found ways to overcome

1180
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.270
our quote unquote natural weaknesses as a species period.

1181
00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:40.239
And to think that females could not also do

1182
00:57:40.239 --> 00:57:44.439
that is just Outlandish in my mind, uh, but

1183
00:57:44.689 --> 00:57:49.209
that aside, females are interestingly physiologically better suited for

1184
00:57:49.209 --> 00:57:52.330
endurance activity. Males are physiologically, again, all this on

1185
00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:55.729
average, better suited for like strength power sorts of

1186
00:57:55.729 --> 00:57:58.729
activities, quick bursts, uh, and I think this all

1187
00:57:58.729 --> 00:58:02.375
goes back to pregnancy as pregnancy. And lactation is

1188
00:58:02.375 --> 00:58:06.764
basically one big long endurance event for a female.

1189
00:58:07.054 --> 00:58:09.814
You're spending a lot of extra calories every single

1190
00:58:09.814 --> 00:58:12.135
day and your body has to accommodate that. And

1191
00:58:12.135 --> 00:58:14.084
if you think about our evolutionary past, not only

1192
00:58:14.084 --> 00:58:17.094
accommodate that, but accommodate the daily tasks you need

1193
00:58:17.094 --> 00:58:20.614
to complete in order to survive. Um, AND so

1194
00:58:20.614 --> 00:58:22.774
a lot of this relates to estrogen. Estrogen is

1195
00:58:22.774 --> 00:58:26.455
a critically important hormone for endurance activity. It's a

1196
00:58:26.455 --> 00:58:28.895
critically important hormone period that people did not get

1197
00:58:28.895 --> 00:58:32.949
enough respect to, um. We can't date how old

1198
00:58:32.949 --> 00:58:35.679
hormones are, but we can get a date on

1199
00:58:35.679 --> 00:58:38.590
the receptors based on the genes for those receptors.

1200
00:58:38.689 --> 00:58:42.469
So estrogen receptors and androgen receptors. The estrogen receptor

1201
00:58:42.469 --> 00:58:45.909
is twice as old as the testosterone receptor, and

1202
00:58:45.909 --> 00:58:49.310
the testosterone receptor is actually from a duplication of

1203
00:58:49.310 --> 00:58:53.750
the estrogen receptor. And the estrogen receptor itself seems

1204
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:58.520
to predate sexual reproduction entirely. And it became this

1205
00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:02.919
critical hormone just for natural functioning physiology. Your heart

1206
00:59:02.919 --> 00:59:05.159
needs it, your muscle needs it, your brain needs

1207
00:59:05.159 --> 00:59:07.439
it. Basically, every organ in your body responds to

1208
00:59:07.439 --> 00:59:11.110
estrogen, which is why you find estrogen in everybody.

1209
00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.600
It is not the female hormone and testosterone is

1210
00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:17.679
not the male hormone. Everyone has both. Um, AND

1211
00:59:17.679 --> 00:59:19.959
I think it's also interesting that we see androgen

1212
00:59:19.959 --> 00:59:23.360
insensitivity disorder, where folks can produce estrogen, but they

1213
00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.639
don't have the receptors for it, and they live

1214
00:59:25.639 --> 00:59:30.260
life just fine. But you don't see estrogen insensitivity

1215
00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:33.340
disorder. There have been 5 documented cases and it's

1216
00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:36.300
only for one of the minor estrogen receptors. There

1217
00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:38.540
are lots and lots of estrogen receptors and there's

1218
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:42.620
some big main ones. You don't see estrogen insensitivity,

1219
00:59:42.729 --> 00:59:45.899
estrogen insensitivity disorder in the main estrogen receptors, because

1220
00:59:45.899 --> 00:59:48.139
I, I firmly believe that would be incompatible with

1221
00:59:48.139 --> 00:59:51.139
life given how much of the body's natural physiology

1222
00:59:51.139 --> 00:59:53.699
relies on estrogen functioning. Uh, BUT in the end,

1223
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:55.139
the things that it does for endurance to bring

1224
00:59:55.139 --> 00:59:57.830
it back, sorry, I. I want to educate everyone

1225
00:59:57.830 --> 01:00:00.489
on estrogen, and anyone who is listening or watching

1226
01:00:00.489 --> 01:00:04.429
this who is perimenopause or menopausal, talk to your

1227
01:00:04.429 --> 01:00:08.070
doctor about estrogen replacement therapy. It is completely safe

1228
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:10.149
within certain realms. Make sure that's why you talk

1229
01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:11.909
to your doctor, and it's going to make your

1230
01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:13.629
life so much better if you can go on

1231
01:00:13.629 --> 01:00:17.580
estrogen replacement therapy. Um, IT'S been, you know, vilified

1232
01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.330
for so many years and testosterone replacement therapy has

1233
01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:23.129
been used all the time. Um, SO please talk

1234
01:00:23.129 --> 01:00:25.250
to your doctor. But estrogen in itself, it does

1235
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:28.969
a few things. Um, ONE, estrogen can increase the

1236
01:00:28.969 --> 01:00:31.840
amount of fat that your body uses, particularly during

1237
01:00:31.899 --> 01:00:36.050
Endurance. And fat is your better endurance fuel. You

1238
01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:38.750
get 9 calories per gram of fat relative to

1239
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:41.290
4 calories per gram of carbs, and so you

1240
01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:44.280
get more energy that actually takes longer to burn,

1241
01:00:44.409 --> 01:00:47.209
which means you're staying at a more consistent level

1242
01:00:47.209 --> 01:00:50.239
of energy output. Then in then you deal with

1243
01:00:50.239 --> 01:00:51.919
carbs, so you have kind of this ebbs and

1244
01:00:51.919 --> 01:00:54.320
flow, you think of a sugar crash. That's an

1245
01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.560
extreme example, but that is kind of a way

1246
01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.439
to think about this. Um, FAT burning allows you

1247
01:00:59.439 --> 01:01:01.959
to burn longer and it can delay fatigue that

1248
01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:05.399
way too. So females preferentially burn more fat than

1249
01:01:05.399 --> 01:01:10.000
males do at basically all levels of endurance. And

1250
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.689
an interesting thing is females typically have more estrogen

1251
01:01:12.689 --> 01:01:15.320
receptors on their skeletal muscle, so the muscles used

1252
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.110
for running. And it's also been found that elite

1253
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:22.149
endurance male athletes also have more estrogen receptors on

1254
01:01:22.149 --> 01:01:24.310
their skeletal muscle. And we don't know if that's

1255
01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:26.790
a training effect that your body can respond and

1256
01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:30.239
actually produce more, or if it's a self-selection, like,

1257
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:32.270
and when they were younger, they found out they

1258
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:33.909
were really good at running and it turns out

1259
01:01:33.909 --> 01:01:35.429
they're really good at running because they have more

1260
01:01:35.429 --> 01:01:37.830
estrogen receptors on their muscles. We do not know

1261
01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:40.449
the answer to that question at this point. Um,

1262
01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:42.419
SO estrogen helps with fat burning, which can help

1263
01:01:42.419 --> 01:01:46.800
delay fatigue. Estrogen also reduces the amount of damage

1264
01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.540
incurred during extreme levels of physical activity, or really

1265
01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.739
any physical activity. It helps protect cell membranes from

1266
01:01:53.739 --> 01:01:57.459
being ruptured during heat stress and exercise stress. Um,

1267
01:01:57.739 --> 01:02:00.699
AND so females take less damage, as well as

1268
01:02:00.699 --> 01:02:02.760
have a faster recovery, not only because of the

1269
01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.260
less damage, but estrogen also seems to help improve

1270
01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:08.219
recovery, uh, of muscle. It also turns out it

1271
01:02:08.219 --> 01:02:10.989
might be super helpful in recover. FROM traumatic brain

1272
01:02:10.989 --> 01:02:14.780
injuries, as well as potential cardio, uh, cardiac events.

1273
01:02:14.909 --> 01:02:16.629
People are looking into this now if you need

1274
01:02:16.629 --> 01:02:19.959
to have estrogen on hand in like emergency rooms

1275
01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.820
to give to folks experiencing a major cardiac event

1276
01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.310
or a traumatic brain injury, because it could potentially

1277
01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:29.389
help improve recovery in those situations. Um, SO those

1278
01:02:29.389 --> 01:02:30.830
are some of the main ones. The estrogen is

1279
01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:33.669
a big one. Adiponectin is another important hormone that

1280
01:02:33.669 --> 01:02:36.110
increases the amount of estrogen, or I'm sorry, increases

1281
01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:38.189
the amount of fat that is being burned during

1282
01:02:38.189 --> 01:02:42.699
any given time. Um, FEMALES also tend to have

1283
01:02:42.699 --> 01:02:48.110
for whatever reason. A better like psychological mental pacing.

1284
01:02:48.149 --> 01:02:50.520
When, when at least when we look at marathons,

1285
01:02:50.679 --> 01:02:52.159
when we look at half marathons and we look

1286
01:02:52.159 --> 01:02:55.360
at marathons, females are able to maintain a more

1287
01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.159
consistent pace, whereas males kind of drop off in

1288
01:02:58.159 --> 01:03:00.280
pace, they start out at faster speed and then

1289
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.439
they slow down more than females do. We don't

1290
01:03:03.439 --> 01:03:05.879
know why. Uh, WE, we don't know if there's

1291
01:03:05.879 --> 01:03:07.520
if, if it's some like it could be a

1292
01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.800
mental thing of like I know I need to

1293
01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.840
pace myself, or it could be this sort of

1294
01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.179
innate thing of like, I know I've got And

1295
01:03:13.179 --> 01:03:16.139
I'm anthropomorphizing physiology at the moment. Like, I know

1296
01:03:16.139 --> 01:03:19.139
I've got 26 miles to go, um, and so

1297
01:03:19.139 --> 01:03:21.020
my body is gonna naturally fall into a pace

1298
01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.100
in which I know I can maintain a decent

1299
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.169
speed to get this done as efficiently as possible.

1300
01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.899
We don't know. Uh, AND, and so that's another

1301
01:03:27.899 --> 01:03:30.219
thing as well, that's, that's really interesting. Um, AND

1302
01:03:30.219 --> 01:03:32.780
then females also have more slow twitch muscle fibers

1303
01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:35.260
than fast twitch. Uh, THE slow twitch muscle fibers

1304
01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:37.290
are your endurance fibers. That's what you see. And

1305
01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:40.219
in marathon runners tend to have more fast twitch

1306
01:03:40.219 --> 01:03:42.260
muscles, which males have more of. I, I call

1307
01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.729
the power lifting muscles. That's sort of quick short

1308
01:03:44.729 --> 01:03:48.070
bursts of speed and power. Um, THERE'S, of course,

1309
01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:51.939
overlap. Elite female weightlifters have a ton more type

1310
01:03:51.939 --> 01:03:54.459
2 fast twitch muscle fibers. And so we do

1311
01:03:54.459 --> 01:03:55.620
see a lot of variation in that.

1312
01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:00.729
OK, so then let me just ask you to

1313
01:04:00.729 --> 01:04:04.479
sort of quick questions before I get into uh

1314
01:04:04.479 --> 01:04:09.239
a commentary on your paper on physiological evidence. So.

1315
01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:14.360
The first one is, uh, how does this physiological

1316
01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:19.409
evidence translate them into hunting? Why do you think

1317
01:04:19.409 --> 01:04:24.919
that it supports, uh, higher levels of hunting for

1318
01:04:24.919 --> 01:04:28.389
women than people tend to agree on?

1319
01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:32.260
It addresses the argument that females would not have

1320
01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:35.580
been physically capable of taking part in hunting. Uh,

1321
01:04:35.659 --> 01:04:37.899
AND, and that is why that there, there's this

1322
01:04:37.899 --> 01:04:41.500
idea of innate female frailty, physiologically and physically, that

1323
01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.639
they couldn't put up with the rigors of hunting

1324
01:04:44.179 --> 01:04:46.530
because of pregnancy and lactation and things. LIKE that.

1325
01:04:46.689 --> 01:04:48.379
And the, the thing is is that we see

1326
01:04:48.379 --> 01:04:51.449
females hunting. Uh, THE Agta are a wonderful example

1327
01:04:51.449 --> 01:04:54.000
of this. It's a, it's a traditional hunter gatherer

1328
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.800
population in the Philippines. Females hunt while they're pregnant

1329
01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.770
and they hunt pretty quickly after they give birth

1330
01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:00.810
as well. They'll even take the kids on hunts

1331
01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:05.409
with them, um, and Talk to, I don't mean

1332
01:05:05.409 --> 01:05:07.239
actually talk to, but if you take a look

1333
01:05:07.239 --> 01:05:11.209
at any female outside of humans, there isn't food

1334
01:05:11.209 --> 01:05:15.330
provisioning from other animals. Females in the wild have

1335
01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:18.649
had to maintain getting food, whether it's hunting like

1336
01:05:18.649 --> 01:05:21.060
a lion does or whether it's gathering like, you

1337
01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.449
know, any nonhuman primate does. They have had to

1338
01:05:23.449 --> 01:05:25.010
be pregnant and they've had to lactate, and they've

1339
01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:26.850
had to care for kids while also getting all

1340
01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:29.330
of the food for themselves and their kids, um.

1341
01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.239
We have that innate physiology as well. There isn't

1342
01:05:32.239 --> 01:05:34.879
something special about human females in which we suddenly

1343
01:05:34.879 --> 01:05:38.129
become physiologically weaker that we cannot provide for ourselves

1344
01:05:38.129 --> 01:05:40.959
and our offspring. Uh, AND so this addresses that

1345
01:05:40.959 --> 01:05:44.760
concern particularly that there's some physical and physiological barrier

1346
01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.399
that females cannot go past to actually take part

1347
01:05:47.399 --> 01:05:49.550
in hunts. Mhm.

1348
01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:52.979
And so, what is then, I would like to

1349
01:05:52.979 --> 01:05:55.629
ask you to tell us what is then the

1350
01:05:55.629 --> 01:05:59.620
exact argument that you're making on the basis of

1351
01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:03.929
all these archaeological and physiological evidence. I mean, is

1352
01:06:03.929 --> 01:06:10.739
it just that women also hunted? Is it that

1353
01:06:11.129 --> 01:06:16.179
women hunted in higher rates than people tend to

1354
01:06:16.709 --> 01:06:21.280
believe? Is it that women also hunted? Big game.

1355
01:06:21.429 --> 01:06:23.689
What is the precise argument?

1356
01:06:23.929 --> 01:06:26.540
Yeah, I'm, I'm gonna scooch back. I'm gonna, I'm

1357
01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.479
gonna go to the big game hunting first just

1358
01:06:28.479 --> 01:06:29.889
because this was not a thing I had mentioned,

1359
01:06:29.929 --> 01:06:32.570
going back to the injury patterns. Um, ONE of

1360
01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:35.169
the best studies out there which also got misrepresented

1361
01:06:35.169 --> 01:06:39.250
in the media horribly, um, was looking at the

1362
01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:43.600
injury patterns and rates among Neanderthals, females and males,

1363
01:06:43.889 --> 01:06:46.159
and they found that the injury patterns and rates

1364
01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:50.719
best corresponded with uh rodeo clowns. And what a

1365
01:06:50.719 --> 01:06:55.520
rodeo clowns do, but distract large angry animals from

1366
01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:59.239
destroying a rodeo rider, uh, you know, during a

1367
01:06:59.239 --> 01:07:02.719
rodeo event, and this was interpreted as not Neanderthals

1368
01:07:02.719 --> 01:07:06.320
were riding wooly rhinoceroses. That's how it got misrepresented

1369
01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.280
in the media, but that Neanderthals were up close

1370
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.639
and personal with the big game they were hunting.

1371
01:07:11.719 --> 01:07:14.840
They relied on like spear thrusting. And so we

1372
01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.520
saw that among females as well as males. And

1373
01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.320
so another key thing I wanna say in is

1374
01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:22.189
if you believe the evidence for hunting among males

1375
01:07:22.189 --> 01:07:24.889
in the Middle Paleolithic, then you have to believe

1376
01:07:24.889 --> 01:07:27.510
females were hunting as well. This is the exact

1377
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:31.010
same evidence. There is literally no difference. So if

1378
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:32.689
you are convinced males were hunting in the Middle

1379
01:07:32.689 --> 01:07:36.350
Paleolithic. And you are not convinced that females are

1380
01:07:36.350 --> 01:07:39.020
hunting in the middle Paleolithic. That's a deep, deep

1381
01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:42.169
bias because it's all based on the exact same

1382
01:07:42.169 --> 01:07:45.260
evidence, um, and so I absolutely believe that females

1383
01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:47.260
were taking part in big game hunting. I am.

1384
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.110
100% unwilling to make any comment on rates. How

1385
01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:55.229
often and how regularly, even males were doing this,

1386
01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.070
to be quite honest. That's a really hard thing

1387
01:07:58.070 --> 01:08:01.840
to determine from the archaeological record. Um, AND so

1388
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.919
how often were they doing big game versus small

1389
01:08:03.919 --> 01:08:07.699
game versus fishing versus trapping? That's a very hard

1390
01:08:07.699 --> 01:08:10.479
thing to put numbers on, and I am uncomfortable

1391
01:08:10.479 --> 01:08:13.040
doing that. I am also uncomfortable saying females were

1392
01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.959
doing it more or less than males. I'm sure

1393
01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:18.444
there were periods of time that female Stopped hunting

1394
01:08:18.444 --> 01:08:20.895
because they were too pregnant, or they had to

1395
01:08:20.895 --> 01:08:22.805
stick around during, you know, the first, you know,

1396
01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:25.975
2 months during, you know, breastfeeding for a brand

1397
01:08:25.975 --> 01:08:28.975
new infant. I'm sure, but that's also very true

1398
01:08:28.975 --> 01:08:31.964
for males who were sick or injured. They would

1399
01:08:31.964 --> 01:08:33.774
not have been able to take part in hunting

1400
01:08:33.774 --> 01:08:35.854
during those periods of time. And so I think

1401
01:08:35.854 --> 01:08:37.854
there's an ebb and a flow in an individual's

1402
01:08:37.854 --> 01:08:41.055
lifespan during which there's larger peaks of hunting, a

1403
01:08:41.055 --> 01:08:42.895
higher rate of hunting, and then lower rates of

1404
01:08:42.895 --> 01:08:45.674
hunting. Uh, BUT I am never comfortable putting an

1405
01:08:45.674 --> 01:08:46.935
actual number to that.

1406
01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.959
OK. But then when it comes to that, to

1407
01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:54.120
that last point, uh, at least, uh, there, there's

1408
01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.399
some space here for people who come from the

1409
01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:03.870
other side to say then that perhaps still men

1410
01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.200
hunted in higher rates than women. I, I mean,

1411
01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:09.772
I'm not. THAT you would

1412
01:09:09.772 --> 01:09:13.933
have, they can say that. I don't, I don't

1413
01:09:13.933 --> 01:09:15.652
think I have to accept that claim because it's

1414
01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:18.603
a bit absolutist. Like, they can make that claim,

1415
01:09:18.772 --> 01:09:21.171
they absolutely can, and it could be right and

1416
01:09:21.171 --> 01:09:23.692
it might be wrong, but based on the fossil

1417
01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:26.372
evidence we have, we can't make that determination. Um,

1418
01:09:26.493 --> 01:09:27.942
THE best you can do is look at, you

1419
01:09:27.942 --> 01:09:30.103
know, modern hunter gatherers today and say, look at

1420
01:09:30.154 --> 01:09:32.064
The rate of hunting in males and then project

1421
01:09:32.064 --> 01:09:34.944
that onto the past. But already, we, we, we

1422
01:09:34.944 --> 01:09:37.036
see that the fossil evidence doesn't mesh up with

1423
01:09:37.036 --> 01:09:39.984
that because of the injury rates with big game

1424
01:09:39.984 --> 01:09:43.866
hunting, the rodeo rodeo clown study, that demonstrates females

1425
01:09:43.866 --> 01:09:46.104
were up close with the big game and hunting

1426
01:09:46.104 --> 01:09:48.536
them. So you can't discount that, and you can't

1427
01:09:48.536 --> 01:09:51.265
accurately project what we see today onto the past.

1428
01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.220
OK, so let's get then into a commentary that

1429
01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:59.220
I read on your paper, Woman, the Hunter, the

1430
01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:03.339
physiological evidence. This was by Melanie Martin at all.

1431
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:06.580
Uh, THE title of their paper is Can or

1432
01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:11.174
their commentaries, Can Women Hunt? Yes. Did women Contribute

1433
01:10:11.174 --> 01:10:15.524
much to human evolution through endurance hunting, probably not.

1434
01:10:15.805 --> 01:10:19.165
And, uh, one of the, uh, first claims that

1435
01:10:19.165 --> 01:10:21.725
they make, I mean, one of the first commentaries

1436
01:10:21.725 --> 01:10:24.475
that they make is that, uh, at a certain

1437
01:10:24.475 --> 01:10:27.884
point in your paper, uh, it seems that you

1438
01:10:27.884 --> 01:10:31.484
say that, uh, some of the, the idea of

1439
01:10:31.484 --> 01:10:37.685
evolved gendered subsistence activities would derive mostly or largely

1440
01:10:37.685 --> 01:10:43.850
from Uh, assumptions that are extrapolated from patriarchal norms

1441
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:48.930
today or rationalizations of implicit male superiority. Uh, AND

1442
01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:52.290
then, uh, they quote that and then they res

1443
01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:56.149
or the reference literature that point to a near

1444
01:10:56.410 --> 01:11:01.129
universality of gendered divisions of labor. So what do

1445
01:11:01.129 --> 01:11:02.089
you make of that?

1446
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:06.250
Yeah, so I absolutely agree that there are some,

1447
01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:09.100
not I wouldn't, there are some populations that have

1448
01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:13.359
a very strict sexual division of labor and most

1449
01:11:13.359 --> 01:11:15.620
populations actually have a good deal of flexibility in

1450
01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:17.979
what the the gender divisions of labor are, uh,

1451
01:11:18.069 --> 01:11:19.339
but there are some where it is only big

1452
01:11:19.339 --> 01:11:21.740
game hunting are males and males alone. Never once

1453
01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:24.060
do we contend that modern day hunter gatherers do

1454
01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.080
not have a majority of males doing the big

1455
01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.939
game hunting. We accept that. That's the data, uh.

1456
01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:31.049
That's not the data we see for the middle

1457
01:11:31.049 --> 01:11:33.930
Paleolithic. It's just not. Uh, IF that were the

1458
01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:36.209
case, we wouldn't see the same injury rates and

1459
01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:38.209
we wouldn't see the same you wear patterns on

1460
01:11:38.209 --> 01:11:40.689
female skeletons and male skeletons as best as we

1461
01:11:40.689 --> 01:11:43.089
can estimate it. And so I don't disagree with

1462
01:11:43.089 --> 01:11:45.290
him that that that's true for, you know, the

1463
01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:47.450
here and the now for the most part, not

1464
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:50.319
all. But it's not what we're seeing in the

1465
01:11:50.319 --> 01:11:52.560
past, and so you, you cannot be blinded by

1466
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.640
the population that you work with and expect them

1467
01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.759
to be this paragon of what Paleolithic life was

1468
01:11:58.759 --> 01:12:01.879
like. That is a false equivalency. If that were

1469
01:12:01.879 --> 01:12:04.040
the case, then they should also be arguing that

1470
01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:08.319
dogs were domesticated 70,000 years ago because people use

1471
01:12:08.319 --> 01:12:11.359
dogs in modern hunter gatherer society societies today to

1472
01:12:11.359 --> 01:12:14.879
hunt. We know that's not true based on fossil

1473
01:12:14.879 --> 01:12:17.029
evidence, and so I, I always have a hard

1474
01:12:17.029 --> 01:12:19.479
time understanding why there's that disconnect with people when

1475
01:12:19.479 --> 01:12:22.640
it comes to women hunting because the fossil evidence

1476
01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.759
shows it and you wouldn't deny the fossil evidence

1477
01:12:24.759 --> 01:12:26.879
for dog domestication, so why are you denying the

1478
01:12:26.879 --> 01:12:29.029
fossil evidence for women hunting in the past?

1479
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:32.770
So, I, I, I mean, let me address this

1480
01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:36.049
right away. So one of the claims that you

1481
01:12:36.049 --> 01:12:38.729
make, at least one of the claims is that

1482
01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:45.410
we can't really rely too much on contemporary traditional

1483
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:52.359
societies because they might not be representative of ancient

1484
01:12:52.609 --> 01:12:55.560
traditional societies from the Paleolithic.

1485
01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:58.689
Right. Absolutely, and you know, this is something that

1486
01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.830
People are getting a lot better about it now,

1487
01:13:01.959 --> 01:13:04.520
but even in the very recent past, people would

1488
01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.879
treat these traditional societies almost like living fossils that,

1489
01:13:07.919 --> 01:13:11.100
you know, they haven't changed and they're intervening 70,000

1490
01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:14.560
years or 50, whatever. And, you know, that's just

1491
01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.799
some racist bullshit right there. So I, I don't

1492
01:13:16.799 --> 01:13:18.040
know if you're allowed to swear, but it is,

1493
01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:21.049
it is, it's just a bullshit, um. That doesn't

1494
01:13:21.049 --> 01:13:24.990
mean that we can't learn amazing things from traditional

1495
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:27.770
populations and come up with ways of generating questions

1496
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:31.089
and hypotheses based on their behavior to then test

1497
01:13:31.089 --> 01:13:33.450
the fossil evidence. Like, right, we see this happening

1498
01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:36.169
in modern day hunter gatherers. What signals might we

1499
01:13:36.169 --> 01:13:38.290
look for in the fossil evidence that might indicate

1500
01:13:38.290 --> 01:13:40.689
a similar behavior in the past? And if it

1501
01:13:40.689 --> 01:13:43.200
matches great, then we can line those things up.

1502
01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:45.649
But if it doesn't match, that's also kind of

1503
01:13:45.649 --> 01:13:47.225
great and We needed to figure out why it

1504
01:13:47.225 --> 01:13:49.294
doesn't match and in what ways it doesn't match.

1505
01:13:49.584 --> 01:13:51.254
Um, AND so, you know, that's one of the

1506
01:13:51.254 --> 01:13:53.785
real issues I had with that commentary is that

1507
01:13:53.785 --> 01:13:56.424
it didn't address the whole second half of our

1508
01:13:56.424 --> 01:13:58.825
argument. It only looked at one, and you need

1509
01:13:58.825 --> 01:14:02.814
both pieces to actually understand what's going on. Um,

1510
01:14:02.944 --> 01:14:04.984
AND the fact of the matter is, is that

1511
01:14:04.984 --> 01:14:07.104
the fossil record as we have it now, and

1512
01:14:07.104 --> 01:14:08.825
if evidence comes out and we get a bunch

1513
01:14:08.825 --> 01:14:11.575
of bones from the middle Paleolithic showing females weren't

1514
01:14:11.575 --> 01:14:14.870
hunting, great, I'll change my tune. But at the

1515
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:16.509
moment that's not what it is. The evidence shows

1516
01:14:16.509 --> 01:14:19.060
they were hunting, um, and you have to bring

1517
01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:21.430
those two together to to make a complete picture

1518
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:22.990
and have a this kind of goes back to

1519
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:25.490
your original question of like. You didn't say it

1520
01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:27.399
this way, but who cares and you know, why

1521
01:14:27.399 --> 01:14:29.250
do we care about this? And part of it

1522
01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:31.959
is because of our reconstructions of the past have

1523
01:14:31.959 --> 01:14:34.370
been faulty and they've been faulty for a really

1524
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:36.990
long time. And you know, the moment you take

1525
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:39.759
up a uh uh uh you Google human evolution,

1526
01:14:39.799 --> 01:14:42.149
you're gonna see that classic picture of a male,

1527
01:14:42.359 --> 01:14:44.479
you know, evolving from a chimpanzee up to, you

1528
01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:46.839
know, modern day human, and you're going to see

1529
01:14:46.839 --> 01:14:49.109
males doing the hunting and all of those things.

1530
01:14:49.319 --> 01:14:52.029
We need to reassess how we reconstruct the past

1531
01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.240
to get a better and more complete picture of

1532
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.950
what our ancestors were doing on a daily basis.

1533
01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:01.979
Yeah, and definitely this point about people having to

1534
01:15:01.979 --> 01:15:05.930
be careful when they try to extrapolate from contemporary,

1535
01:15:06.259 --> 01:15:10.859
uh, traditional societies hunter gatherers, or horticulturalists and so

1536
01:15:10.859 --> 01:15:15.310
on from those two more ancient. In traditional societies

1537
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:17.810
is something that I've already talked about on the

1538
01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:21.169
show several times, probably the first time was with

1539
01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:24.490
Doctor Robert Kelly about his book The Lifeways of

1540
01:15:24.490 --> 01:15:28.850
Hunter-gatherers, because he really drives that point

1541
01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:28.879
there it is.

1542
01:15:30.729 --> 01:15:33.560
I really, really love that book and the book

1543
01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:36.439
is fantastic, and he even talks about women hunting

1544
01:15:36.439 --> 01:15:38.850
too and doesn't discount it, which, you know, kind

1545
01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:40.689
of blows my mind when people who study modern

1546
01:15:40.689 --> 01:15:43.149
day hunter gatherers like read Robert Kelly. I'm like,

1547
01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:45.729
I've read Robert Kelly and he seems cool with

1548
01:15:45.729 --> 01:15:47.069
the idea of women hunting.

1549
01:15:48.839 --> 01:15:50.640
No, I, I really love that book and I

1550
01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.589
can't recommend it enough. And also, if people are

1551
01:15:53.589 --> 01:15:56.470
interested, please go and watch that interview as well.

1552
01:15:56.799 --> 01:15:59.279
So, but just for them to keep that point

1553
01:15:59.279 --> 01:16:02.839
in mind. But then another thing that they say

1554
01:16:02.839 --> 01:16:07.209
in this commentary is that Uh, the review and

1555
01:16:07.209 --> 01:16:13.560
reconstruction of women's evolved physiological capabilities is overly reliant

1556
01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:19.000
on data from Western industrialized populations. So, what would

1557
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.450
be your reply to that?

1558
01:16:20.959 --> 01:16:22.669
Yeah, and I mean it's true and you know,

1559
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:24.430
part of the problem is that's what we've got

1560
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:27.830
to work with, um, which is, which is also

1561
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:30.430
true and in trying to understand populations with high

1562
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:33.680
levels of energy expenditure, but we aren't also we

1563
01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.549
aren't doing it willy nilly. We aren't doing it

1564
01:16:36.549 --> 01:16:39.669
without good reason and rationale. And one of them

1565
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:44.390
is that, you know, studies of bones demonstrate levels

1566
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:48.470
of physical activity on par with modern day Western

1567
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:52.330
athletes. Mhm. And, and so we see this connection

1568
01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:54.410
between the types of tasks that they are doing

1569
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:57.959
that have at least correlates with modern day physiology.

1570
01:16:58.209 --> 01:16:59.810
And that's also part of the issue is we

1571
01:16:59.810 --> 01:17:01.850
don't get a lot of physiology from the fossil

1572
01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:04.490
record. Sometimes we can get some cool biomarkers from

1573
01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:08.479
bones, but, you know, overall, we, we can't know

1574
01:17:08.479 --> 01:17:10.990
fully what the physiological profile of the, of our,

1575
01:17:11.089 --> 01:17:13.649
of our ancient past was. Um, AND so, yeah,

1576
01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:15.604
I get it. I take. That critique, and it's

1577
01:17:15.604 --> 01:17:18.725
absolutely true. Um, AND it's just as fair to

1578
01:17:18.725 --> 01:17:20.444
say, well, like, why can't I use modern day

1579
01:17:20.444 --> 01:17:23.444
hunter gatherers and but you can use modern day

1580
01:17:23.444 --> 01:17:25.604
athletes. I get it. And that is a fair

1581
01:17:25.604 --> 01:17:29.524
point. Um, I'm trying to understand the underlying physiological

1582
01:17:29.524 --> 01:17:32.725
mechanisms that enable high levels of endurance, that enable

1583
01:17:32.725 --> 01:17:35.535
things like pregnancy as well as gathering. This this

1584
01:17:35.535 --> 01:17:38.084
is one thing that really truly upset me with

1585
01:17:38.084 --> 01:17:42.700
that commentary is. Again, this idea that hunting, and

1586
01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.819
we are very explicit about this in our papers,

1587
01:17:44.919 --> 01:17:47.700
that hunting actually was not all that important, especially

1588
01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.459
in the early parts of our, of our evolutionary

1589
01:17:49.459 --> 01:17:52.180
trajectory. We were gatherers to begin with. And when

1590
01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:54.899
we started eating meat, we were scavengers. We picked

1591
01:17:54.899 --> 01:17:58.370
off other animals kills. Um, HUNTING didn't become important

1592
01:17:58.370 --> 01:18:01.540
until much, much later. And even still, we see,

1593
01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:05.299
you know, in hot climate populations, there's usually a

1594
01:18:05.299 --> 01:18:08.660
majority of calories are coming. From plant materials, things

1595
01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:10.939
that are gathered rather than meat. That changes the

1596
01:18:10.939 --> 01:18:14.500
higher latitudes because there's less plant matter. Um, BUT

1597
01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:17.259
there's this idea that gathering is easy, and it's

1598
01:18:17.259 --> 01:18:20.899
not. Uh, PARTICULARLY in the dry areas when we

1599
01:18:20.899 --> 01:18:23.819
think about where humans evolved, digging up tubers with

1600
01:18:23.819 --> 01:18:26.750
a pointed stick, digging is one of the most

1601
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:31.819
metabolically demanding activities you can do. Like, even more

1602
01:18:31.819 --> 01:18:35.020
than running, digging is harder than running. And so

1603
01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:39.819
that it minimizes the physiological demand of gathering, um,

1604
01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:42.580
while trying to say females are physiologically incapable of

1605
01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:46.100
hunting because of pregnancy and lactation that there must

1606
01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:47.859
be some sort of limit on that because of

1607
01:18:47.859 --> 01:18:51.060
pregnancy and lactation. Like no, gathering probably takes just

1608
01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.930
as many if not more calories than hunting does.

1609
01:18:55.419 --> 01:18:58.779
So another claim that they make, and this is

1610
01:18:58.779 --> 01:19:03.500
not directly about, I guess, any of the claims

1611
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:06.339
you make there, but it's more about the, your

1612
01:19:06.339 --> 01:19:10.279
methodological approach. They say that You do not follow

1613
01:19:10.279 --> 01:19:14.759
the typical structure of a scientific study because they

1614
01:19:14.759 --> 01:19:18.680
say you do not state any falsifiable hypothesis or

1615
01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:22.919
predictions to answer a specific research question, but basically

1616
01:19:22.919 --> 01:19:26.535
that your paper is more focused on underscoring. The

1617
01:19:26.535 --> 01:19:31.254
reasons why the original interpretations of male biased hunting

1618
01:19:31.254 --> 01:19:36.575
are wrong while attempting to demonstrate how flawed the

1619
01:19:36.575 --> 01:19:40.325
patriarchal view is. Do you agree with

1620
01:19:42.095 --> 01:19:45.970
their table? Because they review paper. It even says

1621
01:19:45.970 --> 01:19:49.700
so here we review. This was never ever, ever

1622
01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:52.560
meant to be a hypothesis-driven paper or an experimental

1623
01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:55.339
paper. It's more of a theoretical paper and a

1624
01:19:55.339 --> 01:19:59.419
review of papers, theoretical slash review papers that not

1625
01:19:59.419 --> 01:20:02.740
only lay out the abundance of evidence, both archaeologically

1626
01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:05.259
and physiologically, but also provide a lot of future

1627
01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:06.970
directions and where we need to go. That we

1628
01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:10.450
can better test these things. So that's a misreading

1629
01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:12.959
on their part because we literally say these are

1630
01:20:12.959 --> 01:20:16.770
review papers in the papers themselves. And so, yeah,

1631
01:20:17.609 --> 01:20:19.439
I don't really know how to take that one,

1632
01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:22.169
because I, I don't know, I kind of laughed

1633
01:20:22.169 --> 01:20:23.569
at it a little bit. I won't lie. And

1634
01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:25.169
if they listen to this, they're probably gonna be

1635
01:20:25.169 --> 01:20:30.200
upset, but their review papers. Sorry guys, I. Well,

1636
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:32.359
and that's I think I was gonna say, but

1637
01:20:32.359 --> 01:20:34.720
I think that's also a really important point, is

1638
01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:37.120
that all of this data has been in existence

1639
01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.720
for quite some time. Some of the fiddler physiology

1640
01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:43.009
stuff is relatively new, but like the data on,

1641
01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.959
you know, hunting in the fossil record, that's been

1642
01:20:45.959 --> 01:20:48.200
around for a while and it's taken us, and

1643
01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.200
it's not just us, and, you know, there's there's

1644
01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.640
a whole history of feminist anthropologists who have looked

1645
01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.859
at this as well, um. Which also goes to

1646
01:20:55.859 --> 01:20:57.459
show that we've been talking about it and talking

1647
01:20:57.459 --> 01:20:59.479
about it since the 70s, and we're still having

1648
01:20:59.479 --> 01:21:01.180
to come back to it and, you know, fight

1649
01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:03.899
these stereotypical assumptions that it's males doing the hunting

1650
01:21:03.899 --> 01:21:07.430
when there's clear fossil evidence against it. Um SO

1651
01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:10.339
it's not new data, which makes it even more

1652
01:21:10.339 --> 01:21:12.259
frustrating that this is so contentious.

1653
01:21:13.839 --> 01:21:15.939
Yeah. And, and I mean, just to be fair

1654
01:21:15.939 --> 01:21:19.810
and, uh, just for people to not get very

1655
01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:23.109
ups very upset with all of these later this

1656
01:21:23.109 --> 01:21:25.140
year, I will also have on the show Dr.

1657
01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:28.970
Vivek Venataram and then it comes from the other

1658
01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:32.140
side of this discussion. So, and so

1659
01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:35.399
he even, he even says women hunt. He says

1660
01:21:35.399 --> 01:21:37.540
they hunt in a fundamentally different way, but he

1661
01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:41.080
finds them hunting, and so I honestly do not

1662
01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.819
understand why he has an issue with an idea

1663
01:21:42.819 --> 01:21:45.189
of women doing big game hunting in the Paleolithic

1664
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:47.819
when the fossil evidence actually demonstrates it. I, I

1665
01:21:47.819 --> 01:21:50.620
don't really know why that is a hill he

1666
01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:52.580
has chosen to, uh, to defend.

1667
01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:58.259
Anyway, uh, since I mentioned him, because in one

1668
01:21:58.259 --> 01:22:03.259
of his recent papers, Woman the hunter, female foragers

1669
01:22:03.259 --> 01:22:06.959
sometimes hunt, yet gender divisions of labor are real.

1670
01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:11.220
That's the title. He makes a claim that Melanie

1671
01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:15.779
Martin also makes in her, uh, commentary to your.

1672
01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:21.419
Paper that is, um, they basically say that that

1673
01:22:21.419 --> 01:22:24.000
you pres uh the ideas you present in your

1674
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.660
paper are rooted in assumptions that hunting is a

1675
01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:35.140
superior, more desirable activity, even explicitly explicitly stating that

1676
01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:38.859
women are relegated to mothering and

1677
01:22:38.859 --> 01:22:41.629
this is where we were completely and utterly misquoted,

1678
01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:43.779
and I could not believe they said that. So

1679
01:22:43.779 --> 01:22:46.419
that sentence that they quote me on. It was

1680
01:22:46.419 --> 01:22:49.939
literally a summary of a paragraph from Man the

1681
01:22:49.939 --> 01:22:54.180
Hunter. And so there's a direct quote from Man

1682
01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:57.600
the Hunter in our articles of them saying men

1683
01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.680
are superior da da da da da, and I

1684
01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.359
summarize it in more plain language in the quote

1685
01:23:02.359 --> 01:23:05.160
they quote me on there, somehow making it my

1686
01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:08.439
words and beliefs that females are inferior. I, I

1687
01:23:08.439 --> 01:23:12.490
was blown away by by that because it's just.

1688
01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:15.040
It's a misreading, and I don't know how it

1689
01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.799
could be a misreading because the quote is right

1690
01:23:16.799 --> 01:23:19.319
there in the paper followed by the summary, and

1691
01:23:19.319 --> 01:23:23.750
it just that felt incredibly disingenuous cause that's not

1692
01:23:23.919 --> 01:23:26.919
a quote of my thinking and it's very clearly

1693
01:23:26.919 --> 01:23:29.270
a summary of the quote from Man the Hunter.

1694
01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:32.750
So they can say that, but we were also

1695
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:36.740
very explicit about how there is an Oversized emphasis

1696
01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:40.609
on meat and hunting in anthropological literature when it's

1697
01:23:40.609 --> 01:23:44.689
never actually the main source of calories in most

1698
01:23:44.799 --> 01:23:47.890
populations unless you move to more higher latitudes. And

1699
01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:50.700
so, I can't tell you why they said that

1700
01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:53.500
and why they plucked that quote completely and utterly

1701
01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.810
out of context, but there we are.

1702
01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:59.779
So you're not claiming at all that hunting is

1703
01:23:59.779 --> 01:24:04.020
a superior activity to mothering and gathering.

1704
01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:07.700
No, not at all. Damn. I am saying that

1705
01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:09.930
is what man the hunter said, but you know.

1706
01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.040
Well, uh, let's get into another point that they

1707
01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:18.879
make here. So this is a more complicated one,

1708
01:24:18.959 --> 01:24:23.509
but basically, they argue that, uh, the aspects of,

1709
01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:27.759
uh, reproductive fitness, that the sort of physiology that

1710
01:24:27.759 --> 01:24:30.879
you explore in your paper, you, you, I, I

1711
01:24:30.879 --> 01:24:35.160
mean, that you do not consider what uh aspects

1712
01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:38.839
of this, uh, why they would have been selected

1713
01:24:38.839 --> 01:24:41.399
for or what they would. They've been selected for

1714
01:24:41.399 --> 01:24:45.279
and what the energetic costs and benefits are to

1715
01:24:45.279 --> 01:24:50.479
women engaging in hunting versus the myriad other behaviors

1716
01:24:50.479 --> 01:24:54.439
that enhance their reproductive fitness. And so, basically, they're

1717
01:24:54.439 --> 01:24:57.890
making a point about energy allocation, right?

1718
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.140
So. Um, SO I think part of this comes

1719
01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:04.299
from the framework in which they were both educated

1720
01:25:04.299 --> 01:25:06.939
and that they've continued as academics, and it is

1721
01:25:06.939 --> 01:25:10.640
this behavioral ecology framework that organisms do what they

1722
01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.660
can to maximize their reproductive fitness, so produce as

1723
01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:16.299
many babies as possible. Um, AND so it's like

1724
01:25:16.299 --> 01:25:19.379
an optimization idea and I will be very, very

1725
01:25:19.379 --> 01:25:21.259
honest that that is not something that is not

1726
01:25:21.259 --> 01:25:24.129
a theoretical framework I ascribe to in any way.

1727
01:25:24.339 --> 01:25:27.220
I find the idea of optimization in an extremely

1728
01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:31.004
dynamic and Predictable environment to be kind of biologically

1729
01:25:31.004 --> 01:25:33.714
absurd. uh, IF you optimize yourself for in one

1730
01:25:33.714 --> 01:25:36.154
circumstance you're likely screwed for the next change in

1731
01:25:36.154 --> 01:25:39.404
circumstances because you've optimized and adapted yourself into a

1732
01:25:39.404 --> 01:25:42.524
corner. Um, SO I, I, I don't describe to

1733
01:25:42.524 --> 01:25:45.075
that period that what we're doing is always towards

1734
01:25:45.075 --> 01:25:48.709
maximizing reproduction. Um, IF that were true, we wouldn't

1735
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:51.109
see, you know, 4 to 6 year birth intervals

1736
01:25:51.109 --> 01:25:55.350
and even traditional reproducing populations. They're not popping babies

1737
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:58.060
out every year. They're just not doing it. Um,

1738
01:25:58.189 --> 01:26:00.750
AND so that would not be maximizing fitness even

1739
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:03.509
in modern day hunter gatherers today. But also this

1740
01:26:03.509 --> 01:26:05.950
goes back again to that, you know, this idea

1741
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:09.229
that females would be physiologically, energetically incapable of doing

1742
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:11.470
it because of the cost of pregnancy and lactation.

1743
01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:15.899
And I will say again, talk to every other

1744
01:26:15.899 --> 01:26:22.540
mammal female on this planet. They have to. Be

1745
01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:25.180
pregnant, have to lactate, have to take care of

1746
01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:27.089
their offspring, and they have to get the food.

1747
01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:30.339
They have to survive. Survival is going to take

1748
01:26:30.339 --> 01:26:34.339
precedence over reproduction for the vast majority of animals.

1749
01:26:34.419 --> 01:26:36.359
There are those, I mean, we see it with

1750
01:26:36.359 --> 01:26:39.040
what is it, kawakas. I believe it's Kawaka. I

1751
01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.120
know this is a side note, but I find

1752
01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.279
it hilarious, uh, but like the first sign of

1753
01:26:42.279 --> 01:26:45.490
danger, kawaka like abandoned their babies and run away.

1754
01:26:45.819 --> 01:26:48.169
It's just like it's better for me to stay

1755
01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:50.600
alive and reproduce another day than to take care

1756
01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.359
of these little, you know, these little hungry monsters.

1757
01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:56.799
Um, YOU have to survive and you know, survival

1758
01:26:56.799 --> 01:26:58.359
is going to be the key here and if

1759
01:26:58.359 --> 01:27:00.709
you think again about the Middle Paleolithic, we're working

1760
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:04.689
in small groups, um. And females would have had

1761
01:27:04.689 --> 01:27:07.129
to partake in gathering and in hunting males would

1762
01:27:07.129 --> 01:27:09.270
have had to partake in gathering and in hunting

1763
01:27:09.529 --> 01:27:11.899
just to get enough food to make it through.

1764
01:27:12.129 --> 01:27:14.490
Uh, YOU wouldn't have enough people that we likely

1765
01:27:14.490 --> 01:27:17.290
didn't have the, the kind of storage technology to

1766
01:27:17.290 --> 01:27:19.330
keep food for long periods of time the way

1767
01:27:19.330 --> 01:27:22.330
we do now, so they likely had some, um.

1768
01:27:22.729 --> 01:27:24.509
That it was like a day to day thing

1769
01:27:24.509 --> 01:27:26.970
to keep yourself alive. And so they absolutely had

1770
01:27:26.970 --> 01:27:28.370
to do it. And this is what we see

1771
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:31.879
even today among mammals. Talk to any single mom.

1772
01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:34.410
Tell her that she can't work and get the

1773
01:27:34.410 --> 01:27:36.370
job done while also taking care of her kids.

1774
01:27:36.450 --> 01:27:39.450
She gets it done. Um, AND so I think

1775
01:27:39.450 --> 01:27:44.330
that's a very myopic view of reproductive physiology and

1776
01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:47.419
what female capacity is broadly within mammals.

1777
01:27:48.339 --> 01:27:50.740
But wait a minute, with that, with that example

1778
01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:55.629
of that animal you reference there, are you claiming

1779
01:27:55.629 --> 01:28:02.140
that evolution is not primarily or more importantly about

1780
01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:05.459
reproduction? I mean, because I would imagine that, oh,

1781
01:28:05.509 --> 01:28:08.580
OK, I, I have already reproduced, so let me

1782
01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:10.100
just lay down here.

1783
01:28:12.419 --> 01:28:16.390
You can't have babies if you're dead. You can't

1784
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:18.709
if if we want to think about a maximization

1785
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:21.459
and optimization of fitness, which, you know, leading to,

1786
01:28:21.509 --> 01:28:23.990
you know, maximization of optimization of offspring, which I

1787
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:27.459
don't believe, you can't do that if you're dead,

1788
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:29.899
and you can't do that if you are starving.

1789
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:32.910
You cannot reproduce unless you have enough calories to

1790
01:28:32.910 --> 01:28:34.990
begin with, so you have to acquire that food.

1791
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:39.479
So another point that they bring to the table

1792
01:28:39.479 --> 01:28:43.919
is that, uh, I mean, taking into account all

1793
01:28:43.919 --> 01:28:47.959
of what you just said earlier, this now sounds

1794
01:28:47.959 --> 01:28:51.799
a bit weird, but we should first consider the

1795
01:28:51.799 --> 01:28:55.350
costs and benefits of hunting as a subsistence and

1796
01:28:55.350 --> 01:29:01.779
reproductive, reproductive strategy and then evaluate this relative to

1797
01:29:01.779 --> 01:29:06.910
pull energy budgets model from extant foraging. Societies, I

1798
01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:10.990
mean, but isn't this something that you also mentioned

1799
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:11.649
earlier

1800
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:14.750
that. Yeah, absolutely, and I, I mean that's the

1801
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:16.390
thing is like we can get these numbers of

1802
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:18.669
what pooled resources is. I think it's a, it's

1803
01:29:18.669 --> 01:29:20.509
a, it's a harder connection to make in some

1804
01:29:20.509 --> 01:29:23.285
ways because modern day. Hunter gatherer populations live in

1805
01:29:23.285 --> 01:29:26.625
much larger groups than what we see as average

1806
01:29:26.625 --> 01:29:29.544
group size in the middle Paleolithic. That's very different.

1807
01:29:29.584 --> 01:29:31.944
You can have pooled resources. They have the technology

1808
01:29:31.944 --> 01:29:33.904
to keep things prepared and trade and all of

1809
01:29:33.904 --> 01:29:36.544
that. Humans were in much smaller groups and usually

1810
01:29:36.544 --> 01:29:39.330
much more um. What is the word I'm looking

1811
01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:42.080
for like widely distributed across land, like not necessarily

1812
01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.810
close to one another to do these things. There

1813
01:29:43.810 --> 01:29:46.029
was trade and we clearly have evidence, but it

1814
01:29:46.029 --> 01:29:47.529
was not as quick and easy as what we

1815
01:29:47.529 --> 01:29:50.729
see relatively for for today. And so yeah, I

1816
01:29:50.729 --> 01:29:52.919
think we could absolutely get some really interesting data

1817
01:29:52.919 --> 01:29:55.825
as well as generate. New questions and hypotheses from

1818
01:29:55.825 --> 01:29:58.424
these kinds of things from modern hunter gatherers, and

1819
01:29:58.424 --> 01:30:01.464
it'll likely provide very important insights for our evolutionary

1820
01:30:01.464 --> 01:30:04.544
past, but we cannot consider it a mirror for

1821
01:30:04.544 --> 01:30:07.584
our evolutionary past, especially when the fossil evidence negates

1822
01:30:07.584 --> 01:30:09.305
this idea that females weren't hunting.

1823
01:30:10.810 --> 01:30:13.830
OK, so this point will probably be a little

1824
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:17.779
bit repetitive, but let me just ask you directly,

1825
01:30:18.109 --> 01:30:23.220
uh, because they mention also the fact that since

1826
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:27.790
uh females get pregnant, the, the way they reproduce

1827
01:30:27.790 --> 01:30:32.259
compared to men would favor less risky and less

1828
01:30:32.259 --> 01:30:36.339
energetically demanding subsistence tasks. So.

1829
01:30:36.689 --> 01:30:39.339
I mean, I, I can't say no, that's not

1830
01:30:39.339 --> 01:30:41.830
true because there is risk. But again, I will

1831
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:43.950
go back to the fossil record in that you

1832
01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:45.870
might have to take that risk in order to

1833
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:48.390
have food and in order to eat. And by

1834
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:51.109
the rates and patterns of injuries on what we

1835
01:30:51.109 --> 01:30:53.709
believe to be female bones, they were taking those

1836
01:30:53.709 --> 01:30:57.020
risks. And there's also this idea, I, I, I,

1837
01:30:57.029 --> 01:30:59.549
I get concerned that female, that in this, in

1838
01:30:59.549 --> 01:31:04.509
their reconstruction, females are always pregnant or lactating. But

1839
01:31:04.509 --> 01:31:06.350
we know that to not be the case. There's

1840
01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:09.029
usually a lag time between when a female first

1841
01:31:09.029 --> 01:31:12.379
becomes reproductively viable, like they could actually have offspring,

1842
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:15.229
to when they actually start having babies. And then

1843
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:18.310
there's a lag time in between babies. Females are

1844
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:22.509
not popping out children constantly. There's gonna be an

1845
01:31:22.509 --> 01:31:24.725
ebb and flow. To that. And so again, there

1846
01:31:24.725 --> 01:31:26.515
will be periods of time in which, yeah, they

1847
01:31:26.515 --> 01:31:29.285
might not want to risk that behavior, uh, whether

1848
01:31:29.285 --> 01:31:31.725
they are recently pregnant or very, very pregnant and

1849
01:31:31.725 --> 01:31:34.964
about to pop. But again, the evidence suggests they

1850
01:31:34.964 --> 01:31:37.484
were taking those risks, and it means there must

1851
01:31:37.484 --> 01:31:40.004
have been a really big benefit to them to

1852
01:31:40.004 --> 01:31:42.174
take those risks and incur those injuries.

1853
01:31:44.339 --> 01:31:47.560
So, uh, another point is that, and this is

1854
01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:52.040
sort of, or in a way related to the

1855
01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:57.370
earlier point about uh data from Western, modern Western

1856
01:31:57.370 --> 01:32:03.060
industrialized societies. They say that. Um, ALL of the

1857
01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:08.140
physiological research that you reviewed comes from studies of

1858
01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:14.819
non-pregnant women athletes in highly industrialized settings. So, is

1859
01:32:14.819 --> 01:32:16.740
that right? And if so?

1860
01:32:16.979 --> 01:32:22.830
We don't exactly have data on pregnant athletes. I

1861
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:25.649
mean, yeah, they're right. And that's kind of the

1862
01:32:25.649 --> 01:32:28.049
nature of the data. That's kind of what we're

1863
01:32:28.049 --> 01:32:30.890
left with to work with at this point. And

1864
01:32:30.890 --> 01:32:34.000
even sadly still, that data that we work with,

1865
01:32:34.169 --> 01:32:36.689
there's even not that much among female athletes. We

1866
01:32:36.689 --> 01:32:39.575
have so much more on male athletes, um, And

1867
01:32:39.575 --> 01:32:41.814
I've yet to see any of them criticize the

1868
01:32:41.814 --> 01:32:44.444
use of male athletes and trying to understand hunting.

1869
01:32:45.174 --> 01:32:47.415
So you know there's there's again a bit of

1870
01:32:47.415 --> 01:32:49.575
a bias going on there as well, and they

1871
01:32:49.575 --> 01:32:51.904
bring up the point about estrogen levels too, of,

1872
01:32:52.055 --> 01:32:55.095
you know, Western populations have much higher estrogen levels

1873
01:32:55.095 --> 01:32:56.854
than we see in other parts of the world.

1874
01:32:57.350 --> 01:33:00.770
Yeah, that is true, but here's the thing is

1875
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:03.919
that everybody operates within their natural range of estrogen.

1876
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:06.529
If we were to compare the estrogen levels of,

1877
01:33:06.569 --> 01:33:10.089
you know, me, for example, compared to somebody from

1878
01:33:10.089 --> 01:33:14.069
a traditional naturally reproducing population. You would think that

1879
01:33:14.069 --> 01:33:17.470
population would be infertile based on their estrogen levels.

1880
01:33:17.509 --> 01:33:20.069
They're so much lower than what ours are, but

1881
01:33:20.069 --> 01:33:22.790
they operate within the smaller range, and we are

1882
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:25.629
the lower range, and we operate normally within a

1883
01:33:25.629 --> 01:33:29.270
higher range. Even on the individual level, my estrogen

1884
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:31.290
to Testosterone levels, all of those things are gonna

1885
01:33:31.290 --> 01:33:33.709
be different than the person or you next door.

1886
01:33:33.919 --> 01:33:35.959
And we all operate within our narrow range. And

1887
01:33:35.959 --> 01:33:38.120
often when you start messing with those hormones, and

1888
01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:40.000
we'll go back to athletes for a moment, uh,

1889
01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:43.560
where they're making female athletes artificially lower their testosterone

1890
01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:45.600
levels to meet a certain metric in order to

1891
01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:49.229
compete, they are likely messing with that person's physiology

1892
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:52.439
in so many different ways that have nothing to

1893
01:33:52.439 --> 01:33:55.319
do with athletic performance, that's gonna lead to poor

1894
01:33:55.319 --> 01:33:58.709
health and well-being. That that's my own soapbox side

1895
01:33:58.709 --> 01:34:02.029
note, uh, but again saying that Western populations of

1896
01:34:02.029 --> 01:34:04.229
higher estrogen, yeah, we do, but guess what? The

1897
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:06.899
ones with lower estrogen levels still function just fine.

1898
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:09.470
They reproduce, they go on long endurance walks and

1899
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:13.259
they gather their bodies work within a lower estrogen

1900
01:34:13.259 --> 01:34:16.069
range, ours work within a higher estrogen range. That

1901
01:34:16.069 --> 01:34:18.149
I don't think is an argument and what's even

1902
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:21.069
more mind blowing about that is that data comes

1903
01:34:21.069 --> 01:34:23.140
from their own research.

1904
01:34:23.819 --> 01:34:26.020
Uh, OK, but let me ask you this then,

1905
01:34:26.029 --> 01:34:29.700
and I'm not saying, I'm not claiming that, uh,

1906
01:34:29.709 --> 01:34:33.029
if this is a problem, it would favor their

1907
01:34:33.029 --> 01:34:37.100
claim over yours or vice versa. I'm just asking,

1908
01:34:37.509 --> 01:34:40.790
um, is, uh, isn't or couldn't it also be

1909
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:44.430
a problem if we try to extrapolate because earlier

1910
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:48.870
we talked about contemporary traditional societies and also Western

1911
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:52.790
industrialized societies. Wouldn't it also be a problem, problem.

1912
01:34:52.955 --> 01:34:56.234
For both sides of the discussion here, if we

1913
01:34:56.234 --> 01:35:03.035
extrapolate from elite athletes in modern contemporary, in, in

1914
01:35:03.035 --> 01:35:08.455
modern industrialized societies to ancestral uh foraging peoples.

1915
01:35:08.595 --> 01:35:11.104
I completely agree. I, I mean, there, there's no

1916
01:35:11.104 --> 01:35:13.435
way around it. It's, it's, there's, there's 3 ways

1917
01:35:13.435 --> 01:35:18.064
to try to reconstruct the past. One is from,

1918
01:35:18.194 --> 01:35:20.575
you know, the actual bones and fossil records themselves.

1919
01:35:21.259 --> 01:35:24.759
Another is from comparative populations, and then a third

1920
01:35:24.759 --> 01:35:29.169
is from non-human comparisons, so like to chimpanzees, and

1921
01:35:29.169 --> 01:35:31.240
you usually have to combine all of that evidence.

1922
01:35:31.649 --> 01:35:33.209
So what's interesting when it comes to this woman,

1923
01:35:33.250 --> 01:35:37.089
the hunter idea is the behavior. We can get

1924
01:35:37.089 --> 01:35:38.729
from the fossil record. We can get that from

1925
01:35:38.729 --> 01:35:41.000
the bones and the stones. We can see that.

1926
01:35:41.049 --> 01:35:43.529
So we get that in 0.1. Um, 3, if

1927
01:35:43.529 --> 01:35:45.399
you want to think about the, the, the non-human

1928
01:35:45.399 --> 01:35:48.970
comparisons, we also see female chimps hunting. They spear

1929
01:35:48.970 --> 01:35:52.089
little primates with sticks. It's a thing. Um, THEY'RE

1930
01:35:52.089 --> 01:35:54.209
actually pretty good at it. Uh, AND so we

1931
01:35:54.209 --> 01:35:56.250
can make those comparisons, but when it comes to

1932
01:35:56.250 --> 01:35:59.129
the modern human one and the the physiology comparison

1933
01:35:59.129 --> 01:36:05.689
here, physiology doesn't really fossilize. Behavior does fossilize. In

1934
01:36:05.689 --> 01:36:08.910
some behaviors fossilize, not all. And so when we

1935
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:12.129
think about hunting in the middle Paleolithic, we can

1936
01:36:12.129 --> 01:36:14.089
look at the fossilized evidence to get the behavior

1937
01:36:14.089 --> 01:36:16.290
and compare to, you know, non-human primates as well,

1938
01:36:16.330 --> 01:36:18.890
but we can't get the physiological evidence the way

1939
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:20.890
they want. And so we have to look to

1940
01:36:20.890 --> 01:36:23.930
modern correlates. There's no other way to really try

1941
01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:26.450
to assess the ways in which physiology might be

1942
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:30.560
working. We're and we're all always very open and

1943
01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:32.399
honest about that, that we know this isn't a

1944
01:36:32.399 --> 01:36:33.839
1 to 1 comparison, but it's kind of the

1945
01:36:33.839 --> 01:36:36.319
best we have to work with because physiology doesn't

1946
01:36:36.319 --> 01:36:37.959
fossilize in the way we would like it to.

1947
01:36:39.490 --> 01:36:42.779
So one final point from their commentary and then

1948
01:36:42.779 --> 01:36:46.899
we can talk about a few points from your

1949
01:36:46.899 --> 01:36:50.970
response, uh, your written response to that commentary. So,

1950
01:36:51.419 --> 01:36:56.500
uh, They, toward the end, they say something like,

1951
01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:59.839
I mean, they ask how likely it would be

1952
01:36:59.839 --> 01:37:03.339
for renting to have evolved as a stable universal

1953
01:37:03.339 --> 01:37:09.069
strategy for both sexes in equal terms with similar

1954
01:37:09.509 --> 01:37:12.540
trade-offs. I mean, what do you make of this

1955
01:37:12.799 --> 01:37:14.069
kind of question?

1956
01:37:14.939 --> 01:37:17.259
I'm actually not sure I fully understand the question.

1957
01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:21.839
Yeah, uh, I mean, the, the question is.

1958
01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.470
Sorry? No, go ahead, go ahead.

1959
01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:27.910
Yeah, yeah, no, I, I mean, the, the, the,

1960
01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.990
they say, I'm going to read the full quote.

1961
01:37:31.319 --> 01:37:34.720
It is not an all or nothing question or

1962
01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:40.189
one of can versus cannot. Rather, the question is,

1963
01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:43.959
how likely is it that hunting would have evolved

1964
01:37:43.959 --> 01:37:47.790
as a stable universal strategy for both sexes in

1965
01:37:47.790 --> 01:37:52.509
equal terms with similar trade-offs. Neither hunting nor reproduction.

1966
01:37:52.939 --> 01:37:56.140
Is activated overnight. That's the full.

1967
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:59.330
So I, I don't disagree with anything there. It

1968
01:37:59.330 --> 01:38:01.770
isn't an all or nothing, uh, which is again

1969
01:38:01.770 --> 01:38:05.689
why I get very confused by say Vimics, you

1970
01:38:05.689 --> 01:38:08.850
know, being very adverse to this because we're not

1971
01:38:08.850 --> 01:38:12.250
claiming only women hunted. We're not claiming women hunted

1972
01:38:12.250 --> 01:38:15.049
more than men. We're claiming women did hunt and

1973
01:38:15.049 --> 01:38:17.689
women were capable of hunting. That's what we're claiming

1974
01:38:17.689 --> 01:38:19.089
because we can't come up with the rates and

1975
01:38:19.089 --> 01:38:21.890
the trade-offs. And again, you know, this idea of

1976
01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:25.600
being a stable strategy. And you know, I don't

1977
01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.240
know necessarily about stable, but I think it's a

1978
01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:30.339
strategy they had to employ in order to survive,

1979
01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:33.669
especially as you move in, you know, interglacial Europe.

1980
01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:36.040
Big game was kind of the the main thing

1981
01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.759
that they had to survive upon in a lot

1982
01:38:37.759 --> 01:38:40.560
of those environments. And so everyone had to be

1983
01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.799
doing it because one, it's difficult, and two, they

1984
01:38:42.799 --> 01:38:44.520
didn't have enough people and 3, that's what was

1985
01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:48.740
available to eat. Um, AND so. I think it

1986
01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:51.939
is very likely that they had to do hunting

1987
01:38:51.939 --> 01:38:55.129
as well just to survive in these small populations.

1988
01:38:57.020 --> 01:39:01.649
So getting then into your response to their commentary,

1989
01:39:01.939 --> 01:39:04.459
one of the points that you make that you

1990
01:39:04.459 --> 01:39:07.620
mentioned earlier, but I would like for you to

1991
01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:10.100
tell us a little bit more about it. This

1992
01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:14.410
question of men or women or both of them

1993
01:39:14.410 --> 01:39:17.549
hunting has a lot to do with the gender

1994
01:39:17.549 --> 01:39:20.990
division of labor or the sexual division of labor,

1995
01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:24.750
right? So, Um, why do you think that perhaps

1996
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:31.819
in more ancestral middle Paleolithic societies, there wouldn't have

1997
01:39:31.819 --> 01:39:37.180
been, uh, such high levels of sexual division of

1998
01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:38.069
of

1999
01:39:38.069 --> 01:39:39.390
I think it's out of, I think it's out

2000
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:42.180
of necessity. Uh, AND, and this again goes back

2001
01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:44.899
to the smaller population sizes. I mean sometimes group

2002
01:39:44.899 --> 01:39:46.859
sizes could be as small as 12, and that

2003
01:39:46.859 --> 01:39:50.459
would include children, um, who might not be physically

2004
01:39:50.459 --> 01:39:52.220
at an age in which they can go hunting

2005
01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:53.779
and things like that. I think it's out of

2006
01:39:53.779 --> 01:39:56.939
necessity. Uh, THAT that that was the demands of

2007
01:39:56.939 --> 01:39:59.140
the environment and the time in order for them

2008
01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:01.220
to survive. It had to be all hands on

2009
01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:03.339
deck. You couldn't say, hey, this one person is

2010
01:40:03.339 --> 01:40:05.495
going. Hunting? No. All 6 adults had to go

2011
01:40:05.495 --> 01:40:07.725
hunting, uh, or maybe 5 of the 6 and

2012
01:40:07.725 --> 01:40:09.854
1 stays back to, to mind the children while

2013
01:40:09.854 --> 01:40:12.055
they're gone. And then they bring everything back and

2014
01:40:12.055 --> 01:40:13.645
because there's so much, if it is a big

2015
01:40:13.645 --> 01:40:15.604
game, there's a lot of meat that needs preparation,

2016
01:40:15.814 --> 01:40:17.615
that can't just be left to half of the

2017
01:40:17.615 --> 01:40:20.865
population of 6 adults. Everyone has to chip in

2018
01:40:20.865 --> 01:40:23.575
to actually get this work done in order to

2019
01:40:23.575 --> 01:40:24.975
make it through. So I think it's out of

2020
01:40:24.975 --> 01:40:26.604
necessity for the time and the place.

2021
01:40:27.979 --> 01:40:30.979
And so, what do you think are perhaps some

2022
01:40:30.979 --> 01:40:37.299
of the main factors that contribute to escalating uh

2023
01:40:37.299 --> 01:40:40.979
levels of, uh, sex of a sexual division of

2024
01:40:40.979 --> 01:40:43.629
labor? I mean, does it have to do with,

2025
01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:51.299
uh, having settled society, sedentary societies, accumulation of resources?

2026
01:40:51.310 --> 01:40:53.009
I mean, what are exactly

2027
01:40:53.009 --> 01:40:53.180
the

2028
01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:54.689
factors that play a role here?

2029
01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:57.700
I think that's exactly it, and this does kind

2030
01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:59.500
of play to the point that, you know, Mellie

2031
01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:02.339
Martin's comment is about the energetics, is that once

2032
01:41:02.339 --> 01:41:04.899
we became sedentary and there was an accumulation of

2033
01:41:04.899 --> 01:41:06.540
wealth in the version of, you know, the form

2034
01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:09.939
of like food resources, water not talking gold, but

2035
01:41:09.939 --> 01:41:14.060
the accumulation of resources that enabled people to expend

2036
01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:18.419
fewer calories than they would have elsewhere, have more

2037
01:41:18.419 --> 01:41:22.370
reliable calories nearby, which would lead to a higher

2038
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:26.459
reproductive output. And that is when, you know, this

2039
01:41:26.459 --> 01:41:30.500
idea that pregnancy and lactation become a problem with

2040
01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:33.479
females going out and doing other big activities. Once

2041
01:41:33.479 --> 01:41:35.979
things settle down and you can save calories, you

2042
01:41:35.979 --> 01:41:38.060
can push more towards reproduction, and that's where a

2043
01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:41.459
sexual division of labor likely came about is with

2044
01:41:41.459 --> 01:41:46.339
increased sedentism and increased resource collection and agriculture, um.

2045
01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:48.589
And that's kind of what we see, but there's

2046
01:41:48.589 --> 01:41:51.350
also a population explosion that the the rate of

2047
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:54.569
reproduction is much higher at around the same time

2048
01:41:54.569 --> 01:41:56.669
a sexual division of labor appears.

2049
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:59.629
So group size would also play a role

2050
01:41:59.629 --> 01:42:02.629
here. Group size would go way up. Yeah.

2051
01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:07.770
OK. So, uh, I, I mean, just before, because

2052
01:42:07.770 --> 01:42:10.209
I, I noticed that we still have time, so

2053
01:42:10.209 --> 01:42:12.770
perhaps we can also talk a little bit about

2054
01:42:12.770 --> 01:42:16.790
your scientific American article that you wrote with, you

2055
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:19.169
wrote with Charles Roseman, who I have on the

2056
01:42:19.169 --> 01:42:22.529
show recently. Uh, BUT, but just before we get

2057
01:42:22.529 --> 01:42:26.319
into that, let me just make this sort of

2058
01:42:26.609 --> 01:42:29.584
comment myself, and then you can. Reply to it.

2059
01:42:29.665 --> 01:42:32.544
I, I mean, one thing that I find really

2060
01:42:32.544 --> 01:42:37.185
fascinating about this discussion of hunting in human societies

2061
01:42:37.185 --> 01:42:40.714
and whether it was mostly men doing it or

2062
01:42:40.714 --> 01:42:43.895
if women also participated in it, and if so,

2063
01:42:44.084 --> 01:42:47.424
what kind of hunting they participated in and at

2064
01:42:47.424 --> 01:42:49.825
what rates and so on, all all of those

2065
01:42:49.825 --> 01:42:52.654
questions. One thing that I find really fascinating is

2066
01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:57.160
Uh, I read your papers. I read papers from

2067
01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:01.759
people coming from the other and like Melanie Martin,

2068
01:43:01.970 --> 01:43:06.200
Vivek Vivek Veneterman, and other people. And I find

2069
01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:09.640
that most of the discussion, even though you disagree

2070
01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:16.450
on several points. I civil and uh you respect

2071
01:43:16.779 --> 01:43:21.100
one another and you say, so, OK, so we

2072
01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:24.049
agree with this and that point, but perhaps we

2073
01:43:24.049 --> 01:43:27.339
have to take into account uh the those other

2074
01:43:27.339 --> 01:43:31.209
two points there are uh those data there something

2075
01:43:31.209 --> 01:43:35.089
like that. But then, When it comes to how

2076
01:43:35.089 --> 01:43:39.459
people react to these papers on social media and

2077
01:43:39.459 --> 01:43:44.859
particularly people who are not anthropologists, ethnographers, oh my

2078
01:43:44.859 --> 01:43:45.060
God,

2079
01:43:45.069 --> 01:43:48.060
they think they are. They think they're scientists for

2080
01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:50.529
sure. I mean, yeah, I'll be upfront about this,

2081
01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:53.060
Ricardo. I had to to open up a police

2082
01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:57.040
report. Um, FOR the phone calls, physical hate mail

2083
01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:59.850
and emails I was receiving for both Scientific American

2084
01:43:59.850 --> 01:44:03.689
articles. Oh my God. Uh, YEAH, yeah, like that's

2085
01:44:03.689 --> 01:44:06.759
bad. Like, you know, once physical mail starts coming

2086
01:44:06.759 --> 01:44:09.209
to me in a threatening manner, you don't know

2087
01:44:09.209 --> 01:44:11.330
what someone is going to do and you know,

2088
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:13.770
my office number and, you know, where to find

2089
01:44:13.770 --> 01:44:16.729
me on campus is really available on the internet.

2090
01:44:16.770 --> 01:44:19.080
It becomes kind of scary. Uh, AND so I

2091
01:44:19.155 --> 01:44:20.596
started a paper trail with that, and I actually

2092
01:44:20.596 --> 01:44:23.195
have the, the police officer's business card taped to

2093
01:44:23.195 --> 01:44:25.395
my computer so I can forward along any other

2094
01:44:25.395 --> 01:44:28.025
new, you know, BS that comes my way. And,

2095
01:44:28.116 --> 01:44:31.746
uh, yeah, this, this, these articles have a certain

2096
01:44:31.746 --> 01:44:35.155
sector of the public, really emotional, is what I

2097
01:44:35.155 --> 01:44:37.306
would say. It's the best way to put it.

2098
01:44:37.556 --> 01:44:40.835
I, I, I mean, but from my standpoint, I

2099
01:44:40.835 --> 01:44:45.162
mean, I am an interviewer, a science comm. AND

2100
01:44:45.162 --> 01:44:50.731
enthusiast, and I'm really very interested in anthropology and

2101
01:44:50.731 --> 01:44:53.622
social science in general. I mean, I get really

2102
01:44:53.622 --> 01:45:00.182
frustrated when people get into name-calling insults instead of

2103
01:45:00.182 --> 01:45:03.062
addressing like you did in your paper, like the

2104
01:45:03.062 --> 01:45:06.742
other people did in their own papers responding to

2105
01:45:06.742 --> 01:45:09.972
yours or reacting to yours or commenting on yours.

2106
01:45:10.419 --> 01:45:15.169
Uh, IT really irritates me how sometimes, and again,

2107
01:45:15.419 --> 01:45:21.049
it's most of the time is, it's non-experts, non-anthropologists,

2108
01:45:21.339 --> 01:45:25.580
um, replying to things or reacting to things that

2109
01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:29.810
way. How riled up some people get and, uh,

2110
01:45:29.819 --> 01:45:33.009
the sort of claims that they make that sometimes

2111
01:45:33.009 --> 01:45:36.384
people go all the way to claiming that. Just

2112
01:45:36.384 --> 01:45:42.615
because you're questioning whether rates of hunting for men

2113
01:45:42.615 --> 01:45:45.955
are really that high or if women participate that

2114
01:45:45.955 --> 01:45:50.825
the role in hunting, suddenly it's the collapse of

2115
01:45:50.825 --> 01:45:52.145
Western civilization,

2116
01:45:53.424 --> 01:45:56.584
yeah, yeah, no, the woke revisionist history I think

2117
01:45:56.584 --> 01:45:59.345
is my favorite one with all of this rather

2118
01:45:59.345 --> 01:46:02.779
than science, which is. Literally the nature of science

2119
01:46:02.779 --> 01:46:05.020
is cool. I have data. I, I, I think

2120
01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:06.740
the data means this, and you're like, oh, but

2121
01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:09.379
now there's new data, and this new data means

2122
01:46:09.379 --> 01:46:12.299
what I said before is no longer true. So

2123
01:46:12.299 --> 01:46:15.000
you incorporate that new data and you update your

2124
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.080
hypotheses and your theories and all of that. And

2125
01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:19.490
it seems like there, I feel like there's just

2126
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:22.319
a basic misunderstanding of how science works, and the

2127
01:46:22.319 --> 01:46:25.970
only thing that fixes science is new science. Like

2128
01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:28.160
that's how it works. And so this is actually

2129
01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:31.600
a wonderful example that I just found, um, so.

2130
01:46:32.549 --> 01:46:36.490
Um, AFTER Darwin's uh descent of man, there was

2131
01:46:36.490 --> 01:46:40.009
a small feminist backlash to it, and of course

2132
01:46:40.009 --> 01:46:42.089
women at the time of Darwin, they didn't have

2133
01:46:42.089 --> 01:46:43.930
access to the kind of education or resources like

2134
01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:45.810
they weren't allowed to go on the HMS Beagle

2135
01:46:45.810 --> 01:46:47.529
and hang out in the Galapagos Islands the way

2136
01:46:47.529 --> 01:46:50.930
Darwin did, um, and so Antoinette, uh, Louisa Brown

2137
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:53.410
Blackwell, I've got her collection of essays in my

2138
01:46:53.410 --> 01:46:56.729
book right here, um. She starts, you know, taking

2139
01:46:56.729 --> 01:46:58.810
it apart, and there's a paragraph in the book

2140
01:46:58.810 --> 01:47:01.959
where she starts talking about lions and how like,

2141
01:47:02.129 --> 01:47:04.299
you know, it's very clear that the big strong

2142
01:47:04.299 --> 01:47:06.169
male lion is the one doing all of the

2143
01:47:06.169 --> 01:47:08.049
hunting and that, you know, the lioness is the

2144
01:47:08.049 --> 01:47:10.330
one caring for the young. And I'm like this

2145
01:47:10.330 --> 01:47:13.770
is the perfect example of new data is going

2146
01:47:13.770 --> 01:47:17.009
to refute old ideas and that we now know

2147
01:47:17.009 --> 01:47:19.810
it's actually female lions that do the vast majority

2148
01:47:19.810 --> 01:47:21.810
of the hunting in a lion pride and the

2149
01:47:21.810 --> 01:47:24.689
male does like the territory protection kind of thing.

2150
01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:27.589
And that's exactly what this is. That's exactly what

2151
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:30.310
this whole woman the hunter idea is. And it's

2152
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:33.430
unfortunately for them, and I would say, based on

2153
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:36.319
data that's been in existence for a long time,

2154
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:38.790
and people have just kind of ignored it. Nothing

2155
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:43.375
we're saying is new. Adrian Zilman. Sarah Hardy, um,

2156
01:47:43.645 --> 01:47:46.484
and, uh, Andrew uh sorry, and Tanner, they, they've

2157
01:47:46.484 --> 01:47:50.604
been saying these things for decades, but we are

2158
01:47:50.604 --> 01:47:53.455
currently in a moment in which, you know, gender

2159
01:47:53.455 --> 01:47:56.205
is a huge issue, definitions of sex are a

2160
01:47:56.205 --> 01:47:59.709
huge issue. And you know, pushing for, you know,

2161
01:48:00.009 --> 01:48:03.830
gender parity, uh, in workplaces and everything else, it's

2162
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:06.029
a hot button topic and so people are gonna

2163
01:48:06.029 --> 01:48:08.830
respond to this kind of paper in a much

2164
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:11.350
stronger fashion than they would have, say, like 10

2165
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:15.669
years ago even, um, and so yeah, new data

2166
01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:18.549
can refute old science. That's that's how we move

2167
01:48:18.549 --> 01:48:21.149
forward and so it's not a woke revisionist, you

2168
01:48:21.149 --> 01:48:23.870
know, history. We're just taking the data that existed

2169
01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:26.069
and actually showing it to you and people don't

2170
01:48:26.069 --> 01:48:29.089
like that. They really don't like that.

2171
01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:32.500
Uh, ALSO, uh, I mean, people who go all

2172
01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:36.910
the way to claiming that just by questioning this

2173
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:41.270
sort of gender norms that we have or gendered

2174
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:44.629
ideas that we have, or expectations we have for

2175
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:50.109
both sexes that suddenly the collapse of societies around

2176
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:53.229
the corner. I, I'm like, oh, OK, so now

2177
01:48:53.229 --> 01:48:57.549
we're getting into those arguments of the aliens are

2178
01:48:57.549 --> 01:49:00.495
coming. They're always coming, but they never appear.

2179
01:49:00.694 --> 01:49:03.205
When will they be here, Ricardo? I want to

2180
01:49:03.205 --> 01:49:06.964
meet some aliens, damn it. Yeah, but, but we've

2181
01:49:06.964 --> 01:49:07.084
been,

2182
01:49:07.325 --> 01:49:12.044
we've been hearing about the collapse of Western civilization

2183
01:49:12.044 --> 01:49:14.645
for us. I don't know how long and it

2184
01:49:14.645 --> 01:49:16.125
never comes. I mean,

2185
01:49:16.555 --> 01:49:19.084
the collapse of the family unit and all of

2186
01:49:19.084 --> 01:49:21.325
these things, da da da. And you know, I,

2187
01:49:21.604 --> 01:49:23.004
maybe this is going off, but I wanna make

2188
01:49:23.004 --> 01:49:24.354
sure it's a point that I put up there.

2189
01:49:24.365 --> 01:49:25.845
And, you know, this is what I get from

2190
01:49:25.845 --> 01:49:29.339
the various trolls online. And they think they're so

2191
01:49:29.339 --> 01:49:32.600
clever with gotchas of like, well, I repeated your

2192
01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:34.750
entire argument. Here is the list of top 10

2193
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:38.439
marathon finishing times for females and males. Clearly this

2194
01:49:38.439 --> 01:49:40.620
means females weren't hunting. And I'm like, all right,

2195
01:49:40.649 --> 01:49:45.149
all right, 2 points here, buddy. Uh, ONE, never

2196
01:49:45.149 --> 01:49:47.200
in, you know, the history of human evolution and

2197
01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:50.740
persistence hunting is who is fastest gets. Animal. It's

2198
01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:53.970
who wears down that animal over a slow, long

2199
01:49:53.970 --> 01:49:57.009
slog. This isn't a foot race for fastest time.

2200
01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:02.379
So that's 0.1. 0.2 by that logic, males 70

2201
01:50:02.379 --> 01:50:05.140
years ago wouldn't have been incapable of hunting because

2202
01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:07.459
their marathon times are so much slower than males

2203
01:50:07.459 --> 01:50:09.939
today. Like, if that's what you're using as a

2204
01:50:09.939 --> 01:50:13.020
metric in an argument. You didn't think that one

2205
01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:15.939
fully through at all. Uh, AND you know that

2206
01:50:15.939 --> 01:50:17.620
is the thing is they they they think they

2207
01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:19.770
have these really interesting gotcha moments because they took

2208
01:50:19.770 --> 01:50:23.819
15 seconds to Google something, which somehow negates the

2209
01:50:23.819 --> 01:50:26.700
years of research that we have pulled together and

2210
01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:28.819
the amount of time and effort we have gone

2211
01:50:28.819 --> 01:50:31.850
through to comb through the data, read the old

2212
01:50:31.859 --> 01:50:35.419
old literature from the 1800s that is sometimes impenetrable

2213
01:50:35.419 --> 01:50:37.870
to read, to make sure we have a full

2214
01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:41.450
understanding of the bigger picture here and everyone thinks.

2215
01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:44.520
Having internet access makes you an expert in a

2216
01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:47.240
topic, and that's just not the case. I am

2217
01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.959
not an expert in immunology. I am not an

2218
01:50:49.959 --> 01:50:52.799
expert in mechanics. I am not about to go

2219
01:50:52.799 --> 01:50:55.120
tell somebody who is an expert in those things

2220
01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.640
I know better than they do. And there's always

2221
01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:59.439
a wish that I have with these various trolls,

2222
01:50:59.450 --> 01:51:01.160
like, I just wanna show up to their workplace

2223
01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:04.189
and take over their job because clearly, with my

2224
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:06.240
10 seconds of Googling what their job is, I

2225
01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:07.959
can do their job better than they can. That's

2226
01:51:07.959 --> 01:51:10.899
how it feels like. Like seriously, this is what

2227
01:51:10.899 --> 01:51:12.560
you're going to do and you, you think it's

2228
01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:15.540
a big gotcha, and it's sad, uh, and it's

2229
01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:17.169
frustrating, is what it is.

2230
01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:20.180
Yeah, I understand that. And also just before we

2231
01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:24.229
get into your scientific American article, let me just

2232
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:29.819
say that you mentioned them presenting data from marathons

2233
01:51:29.819 --> 01:51:34.540
to try to undermine your argument there, but also

2234
01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:37.310
let me just say that if you think that

2235
01:51:37.779 --> 01:51:42.540
Uh, being fast, awards, being able to catch prey,

2236
01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:46.609
then just on being fast alone, I don't think

2237
01:51:46.609 --> 01:51:49.859
we would be ever be able to catch anything

2238
01:51:49.859 --> 01:51:52.939
because I don't know many animals out there that

2239
01:51:52.939 --> 01:51:55.359
are slower than, than humans.

2240
01:51:55.439 --> 01:51:58.154
No, it's true. We can go for a Very

2241
01:51:58.154 --> 01:52:01.665
long time, but at a moderate pace. It's not,

2242
01:52:01.754 --> 01:52:05.274
you know, the, the two hour marathon phase. It's

2243
01:52:05.274 --> 01:52:08.754
just, yeah. Uh, BUT I still get comments like

2244
01:52:08.754 --> 01:52:10.555
that. I there was somebody who thought he was

2245
01:52:10.555 --> 01:52:13.455
being completely rational and rational and reasonable, and I'm

2246
01:52:13.455 --> 01:52:15.674
like, here's why it's not. And like, and then

2247
01:52:15.674 --> 01:52:19.779
they never actually respond back. Like when I decide

2248
01:52:19.779 --> 01:52:22.060
to actually take the time and effort to engage

2249
01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:23.979
with a troll, and I, I will put together

2250
01:52:23.979 --> 01:52:27.100
like, you know, 1000 words of like, here's why

2251
01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:29.620
this is incorrect. I never hear back from them

2252
01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:33.609
and I always find that really upsetting like. How

2253
01:52:33.609 --> 01:52:35.020
about just a thank you for your time and

2254
01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:37.979
effort, because this is some unpaid labor, right? Here's

2255
01:52:37.979 --> 01:52:38.689
what it is.

2256
01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:42.620
Yeah, I guess they can always put that in

2257
01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:47.259
the YouTube video with a title like, I've just

2258
01:52:47.259 --> 01:52:52.220
owned, uh, a, a woke feminist academ.

2259
01:52:52.779 --> 01:52:54.979
My goodness, there was, was it last week, some

2260
01:52:54.979 --> 01:52:57.525
guy went. On a Twitter tirade, he calls himself

2261
01:52:57.525 --> 01:53:01.445
like the illegitimate academic or something like that. And

2262
01:53:01.445 --> 01:53:05.605
every point he made demonstrated his complete and utter

2263
01:53:05.605 --> 01:53:08.735
lack of understanding of human evolution and the archaeological

2264
01:53:08.735 --> 01:53:11.715
record period. And he did so, you know, using

2265
01:53:11.715 --> 01:53:15.326
big capital letters and like rage-inducing language to like

2266
01:53:15.326 --> 01:53:17.645
get people angry about it. And then the very

2267
01:53:17.645 --> 01:53:20.071
last tweet was, I want to invite Kara Akabak

2268
01:53:20.071 --> 01:53:22.312
and Sarah Lacey onto my YouTube channel so we

2269
01:53:22.312 --> 01:53:24.952
can discuss it. BECAUSE despite what the, you know,

2270
01:53:25.071 --> 01:53:27.941
the above threads says, I actually respect their work

2271
01:53:27.941 --> 01:53:29.662
and think we should have a conversation. I'm like,

2272
01:53:29.791 --> 01:53:32.472
you do not respect anything, and you have barely

2273
01:53:32.472 --> 01:53:35.551
even a sophomoric understanding of human evolution. Why would

2274
01:53:35.551 --> 01:53:37.591
I give you my time and effort just to

2275
01:53:37.591 --> 01:53:39.671
contribute to your rage factory? I'm not gonna do

2276
01:53:39.671 --> 01:53:39.912
it.

2277
01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:44.399
That you know, but that's just how argumentation works

2278
01:53:44.399 --> 01:53:47.390
on the internet. If you write in all caps,

2279
01:53:47.439 --> 01:53:50.839
you've immediately won the argument. There's nothing the other

2280
01:53:50.839 --> 01:53:52.049
person can do about it.

2281
01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:54.479
Fair point, fair point. My next publication will be

2282
01:53:54.479 --> 01:53:55.979
in all capital letters.

2283
01:53:58.819 --> 01:54:01.959
Oh my God. So, OK, so let's get then

2284
01:54:01.959 --> 01:54:06.680
into your scientific American article with Charles Roseman. To

2285
01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:10.209
understand sex, we need to to ask the right

2286
01:54:10.209 --> 01:54:14.350
questions. So, Uh, tell us what, uh, because this

2287
01:54:14.350 --> 01:54:19.830
is another one that generated a huge backlash on

2288
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:23.310
social media. But, uh, to be clear, what are

2289
01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:25.500
your arguments there exactly?

2290
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:29.140
So people love to say like, you know, your,

2291
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:32.725
you know, biology didn't. Styalists and, you know, things

2292
01:54:32.725 --> 01:54:34.564
like that by saying, you know, sex isn't a

2293
01:54:34.564 --> 01:54:36.645
binary. Well, it kind of depends on what you're

2294
01:54:36.645 --> 01:54:39.125
talking about. And it, and it really does depend

2295
01:54:39.125 --> 01:54:40.825
on the question. And so I like to use

2296
01:54:40.825 --> 01:54:43.285
the examples of hormones, uh, because I, I think

2297
01:54:43.285 --> 01:54:45.365
this makes the most sense. And, and why the

2298
01:54:45.365 --> 01:54:48.444
question you're asking should determine how you are defining

2299
01:54:48.444 --> 01:54:51.205
or operationalizing sex in any study that you do.

2300
01:54:51.729 --> 01:54:54.660
And I, uh, 100% will say there are reasons

2301
01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:56.540
and times that you use a sex binary in

2302
01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:58.419
your work. I do when it comes to my

2303
01:54:58.419 --> 01:55:02.470
finished reindeer herders. At the moment, every single individual's,

2304
01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:04.779
uh, you know, sex and gender line up. And

2305
01:55:04.779 --> 01:55:06.979
so I do split things into male and female

2306
01:55:06.979 --> 01:55:09.939
doing the, the actual analysis, uh, to compare things.

2307
01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:12.220
So there are times to use it. But there

2308
01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:13.979
are also times where it doesn't make sense. And

2309
01:55:13.979 --> 01:55:16.060
so that comes with the hormones when we talk

2310
01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:19.040
about the ideas of, you know. If you're breaking

2311
01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.259
things up by sex and you're looking at estrogen

2312
01:55:21.259 --> 01:55:23.790
and just saying all females have, you know, estrogen

2313
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:26.229
within this range and males within this range, you're

2314
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:29.080
not actually asking a question about estrogen. If you

2315
01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:31.319
are breaking things up just based on male versus

2316
01:55:31.319 --> 01:55:33.799
female and assuming a certain estrogen level in one

2317
01:55:33.799 --> 01:55:35.910
and assuming a certain estrogen level in the other,

2318
01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:38.399
you're not gonna get your answer your question answered

2319
01:55:38.399 --> 01:55:40.439
in any way. You need to actually take a

2320
01:55:40.439 --> 01:55:43.919
look at the estrogen levels or the testosterone levels.

2321
01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:47.799
If you are interested in chromosomes, yeah, the vast

2322
01:55:47.799 --> 01:55:49.935
majority of females are going to be X. And

2323
01:55:49.935 --> 01:55:51.495
the vast majority of males are going to be

2324
01:55:51.495 --> 01:55:54.654
XY. But there is variation that we see, and

2325
01:55:54.654 --> 01:55:57.555
we can't discount that. That doesn't mean those aren't

2326
01:55:57.555 --> 01:55:59.415
people because they don't fit within this neat and

2327
01:55:59.415 --> 01:56:01.774
tidy box. Uh, YOU can say the same thing

2328
01:56:01.774 --> 01:56:06.734
about external genitalia, internal gonads, secondary sexual characteristics, any

2329
01:56:06.734 --> 01:56:09.535
number of things that are going to exist on

2330
01:56:09.535 --> 01:56:12.654
a continuum of, you know, the extreme of full

2331
01:56:12.654 --> 01:56:14.115
one on the other and the extreme of the

2332
01:56:14.115 --> 01:56:15.645
one on, you know, the other end of it,

2333
01:56:15.814 --> 01:56:17.884
and you're gonna have this middle range going in

2334
01:56:17.884 --> 01:56:23.240
between. And that's That's human variation. That's nature's variation,

2335
01:56:23.279 --> 01:56:27.459
you, you like. If we use intersex as an

2336
01:56:27.459 --> 01:56:31.459
example. Intersex uh variation is actually really common in

2337
01:56:31.459 --> 01:56:34.379
bears and in pigs. This isn't just like a

2338
01:56:34.379 --> 01:56:37.549
human figment of our imagination of woke culture of

2339
01:56:37.549 --> 01:56:40.419
I'm different and recognize me. No, this kind of

2340
01:56:40.419 --> 01:56:43.740
thing exists all over the place. Um, I don't

2341
01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:45.750
necessarily like using other animal examples cause like, well,

2342
01:56:45.779 --> 01:56:48.220
we're humans and we're different and human exceptional and

2343
01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:49.899
so on and so forth. But I think it

2344
01:56:49.899 --> 01:56:51.899
really does depend on the question you're asking. If

2345
01:56:51.899 --> 01:56:53.779
you are interested in chromosomes, then you need to

2346
01:56:53.779 --> 01:56:56.020
actually look at chromosomes. If you're interested in hormones,

2347
01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:58.232
then you need to actually measure the Hormones. And

2348
01:56:58.232 --> 01:57:01.143
there is likely going to be, you know, a,

2349
01:57:01.183 --> 01:57:03.953
a double distribution bell curve of female and male

2350
01:57:03.953 --> 01:57:06.192
on these things, but there's also gonna be overlap

2351
01:57:06.192 --> 01:57:09.462
between those two curves. Um, AND you, you cannot

2352
01:57:09.462 --> 01:57:12.152
put every single person in one solid female box

2353
01:57:12.152 --> 01:57:14.592
and one solid mail box. Um, AND I, I

2354
01:57:14.592 --> 01:57:17.112
will use myself as an example as somebody who

2355
01:57:17.112 --> 01:57:20.592
has higher than what would be average testosterone levels

2356
01:57:20.592 --> 01:57:23.553
for a female. I am genetically a female and

2357
01:57:23.553 --> 01:57:26.596
I have a, you know, normal, naturally. During menstrual

2358
01:57:26.596 --> 01:57:28.485
cycle, but I also have a little bit higher

2359
01:57:28.485 --> 01:57:31.395
estrogen, or I'm sorry, testosterone, uh, than what would

2360
01:57:31.395 --> 01:57:34.235
be expected. And, you know, what does that mean

2361
01:57:34.235 --> 01:57:35.645
for me? Do I not fit in the female

2362
01:57:35.645 --> 01:57:39.405
box? No, I have higher testosterone. Great. Whatever. Um,

2363
01:57:39.766 --> 01:57:41.326
BUT that's the kind of thing that someone might

2364
01:57:41.326 --> 01:57:43.645
assume my testosterone levels based on me being a

2365
01:57:43.645 --> 01:57:45.726
female, and they would be wrong. And so if

2366
01:57:45.726 --> 01:57:47.366
I were put into a study looking at the

2367
01:57:47.366 --> 01:57:50.295
effects of hormones on, you know, athletic performance or

2368
01:57:50.295 --> 01:57:52.726
whatever, and they're just assuming those that are female

2369
01:57:52.726 --> 01:57:55.879
have higher estrogen, lower testosterone. I'm not gonna fit

2370
01:57:55.879 --> 01:57:58.240
that distribution as well as they think, and that's

2371
01:57:58.240 --> 01:57:59.600
gonna be true across humans.

2372
01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:06.109
So let me ask you this then, um. Do

2373
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:11.750
you think that there would be scientifically speaking, or

2374
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:18.779
there should be a precise universal definition of sex,

2375
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:23.649
like, for example, distinguishing between males and females on

2376
01:58:23.649 --> 01:58:27.759
the basis of their gamete size, or You

2377
01:58:27.759 --> 01:58:30.310
can absolutely do that, and if the the the

2378
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:34.509
question you are asking depends on gamete size, then

2379
01:58:34.509 --> 01:58:37.310
sure. But I think it depends on the question,

2380
01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:41.160
because you're also gonna get individuals who don't produce

2381
01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:44.470
gametes or they don't have the gamete producing organs,

2382
01:58:44.759 --> 01:58:46.439
uh, you know what, or they have one of

2383
01:58:46.439 --> 01:58:49.310
each, which is a thing that does happen, um,

2384
01:58:49.319 --> 01:58:50.959
and so I think it entirely depends on the

2385
01:58:50.959 --> 01:58:53.040
question and if it's gametete size that matters to

2386
01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:54.709
you for whatever it is you're researching, then hey,

2387
01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:57.740
great. Um, AND I think the bigger issue with

2388
01:58:57.740 --> 01:59:00.350
this, you know, in, in the broader public and

2389
01:59:00.350 --> 01:59:04.270
social media universe is this idea of, you know,

2390
01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:05.750
and I think you kind of brought it up,

2391
01:59:05.790 --> 01:59:07.879
you know, collapse of society and there's no longer

2392
01:59:07.879 --> 01:59:09.669
traditional gender roles and now we don't even know

2393
01:59:09.669 --> 01:59:12.870
what sex we are like, no, people know an

2394
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:15.609
individual knows who they. ARE and where they fall

2395
01:59:15.609 --> 01:59:18.330
on what spectrum and continuum. You have an issue

2396
01:59:18.330 --> 01:59:21.500
of there being greater complexity in the universe. And

2397
01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:23.509
I'm sorry that you have that problem, but that's,

2398
01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:25.939
that's kind of biology. It's, it's, it's complex, and

2399
01:59:25.939 --> 01:59:28.180
you can't fit really anything into these really neat,

2400
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:30.540
tidy boxes. That's just not how it is. If

2401
01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:33.100
we did that, there would be problems. Yeah, again.

2402
01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:36.500
Sperm and egg are important for reproduction. No denying

2403
01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:39.100
that, that is a biological reality, but it's not

2404
01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:42.299
necessarily biological reality for everybody. And the point that

2405
01:59:42.299 --> 01:59:43.700
Charles and I make at the end of that

2406
01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:45.930
article, I believe I think is the most important.

2407
01:59:46.259 --> 01:59:48.140
It should not determine how we treat one another.

2408
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:51.629
It should not determine how we categorize other humans

2409
01:59:51.629 --> 01:59:54.950
on like and, you know, an ethical, moral, hierarchical

2410
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:57.430
level and a societal level. That's where this is

2411
01:59:57.430 --> 02:00:00.069
really becoming problematic. The ways in which we define

2412
02:00:00.069 --> 02:00:02.149
sex is going to change based on the questions

2413
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:04.810
we're asking to make sure the variables that we're

2414
02:00:04.810 --> 02:00:07.270
interested in are the ones we're measuring, and we're

2415
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:10.669
not assuming a certain range of those variables because

2416
02:00:10.669 --> 02:00:12.470
of what we typically consider to be female, what

2417
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:14.470
we typically consider to be male. It's gonna be

2418
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:15.470
the range across the two.

2419
02:00:17.089 --> 02:00:21.609
Uh, BUT would the terms like, or a distinction

2420
02:00:21.609 --> 02:00:28.770
between male and female always apply across all species

2421
02:00:28.770 --> 02:00:31.649
or, or, or at least perhaps to be more

2422
02:00:31.649 --> 02:00:36.299
precise, with the binary always apply to all species

2423
02:00:36.299 --> 02:00:36.689
or

2424
02:00:36.689 --> 02:00:40.819
not? I mean. A binary thing is like because

2425
02:00:40.819 --> 02:00:43.140
there are times where there isn't a strict binary

2426
02:00:43.140 --> 02:00:45.049
there, uh, but there are always going to be

2427
02:00:45.049 --> 02:00:47.819
exceptions to it. I think a binary makes a

2428
02:00:47.819 --> 02:00:52.100
lot of sense in um an evolutionary context because

2429
02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:55.850
you have to view it as a reproductively successful

2430
02:00:55.850 --> 02:00:59.069
population or reproductively successful species and at least within.

2431
02:00:59.410 --> 02:01:01.220
That this is, you know, obviously not true for

2432
02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:03.709
bacteria, which there are far more bacteria than any

2433
02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:06.270
other, you know, mammal, bird and lizard on this

2434
02:01:06.270 --> 02:01:09.299
planet, um, you know, a binary doesn't make sense

2435
02:01:09.299 --> 02:01:11.109
for them and they reproduce just fine. But when

2436
02:01:11.109 --> 02:01:13.430
we're talking about animals that do rely on sexual

2437
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:17.600
reproduction. A binary makes perfect sense for understanding, you

2438
02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:21.399
know, evolutionary patterns with an evolutionary, uh, uh, context

2439
02:01:21.399 --> 02:01:24.359
because it is about reproduction as well. So survival

2440
02:01:24.359 --> 02:01:26.160
and reproduction, you have to be able to reproduce

2441
02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:28.919
to the next generation. And yeah, you need sperm

2442
02:01:28.919 --> 02:01:31.759
and eggs to do that. Uh, SO certain contexts

2443
02:01:31.759 --> 02:01:34.319
it makes absolute perfect sense, but in others it

2444
02:01:34.319 --> 02:01:34.720
might not.

2445
02:01:36.419 --> 02:01:38.700
Uh, SO let me just see if I understand

2446
02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:42.899
this correctly. Uh, PERHAPS one of the main claims

2447
02:01:42.899 --> 02:01:47.379
you're making there is that, uh, sex as a

2448
02:01:47.379 --> 02:01:51.370
category is not in many contexts is, is not

2449
02:01:51.370 --> 02:01:57.790
a good enough. Uh, PROXY for variation in certain

2450
02:01:57.790 --> 02:02:04.709
specific, for example, anatomic physiological, metabolical, uh, factors or

2451
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:05.750
variants,

2452
02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:09.560
right. Absolutely, absolutely, you have it right. Uh, USING

2453
02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:13.270
sex as a proxy for continuous variables, using a

2454
02:02:13.270 --> 02:02:15.799
binary as a proxy for something that's continuous, that's

2455
02:02:15.799 --> 02:02:18.879
deeply problematic. And it's bad science.

2456
02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:21.229
Yeah, so let me just ask you about this,

2457
02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:23.609
and this is, of course, more of a question

2458
02:02:23.609 --> 02:02:30.009
that falls more on the social slash political aspect

2459
02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:34.799
of of sex-related questions because we know that this

2460
02:02:34.799 --> 02:02:40.029
has. IMPLICATIONS for how we deal, for example, or

2461
02:02:40.259 --> 02:02:45.299
the basis on which non-binary trans people and queer

2462
02:02:45.299 --> 02:02:50.419
people argue for their rights sometimes and their political

2463
02:02:50.419 --> 02:02:53.979
and social standing. Um, DO you think that in

2464
02:02:53.979 --> 02:03:01.319
humans specifically, it makes sense to talk about sex

2465
02:03:01.319 --> 02:03:06.430
as being. No, I'm, I'm mentioning sex, you're not

2466
02:03:06.430 --> 02:03:10.279
gender, just to be careful. Um, IS sex as

2467
02:03:10.279 --> 02:03:13.600
being non-binary. Does that make sense in

2468
02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:15.359
human? So I mean, I think it depends on

2469
02:03:15.359 --> 02:03:17.560
how you're defining sex in that case. Are you

2470
02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:21.750
defining it as like the reproducing individuals? Is there

2471
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:23.640
are going to be individuals, you know, even in

2472
02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:26.439
our evolutionary past that, you know, maybe they have

2473
02:03:26.439 --> 02:03:30.200
XY, but they do. Not breed because they are,

2474
02:03:30.209 --> 02:03:32.640
they do not reproduce because they don't actually want

2475
02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:35.850
to have sex with a female. Like that's entirely

2476
02:03:35.850 --> 02:03:37.649
possible. So it depends a little bit on how

2477
02:03:37.649 --> 02:03:39.330
you're defining sex in that case you can see

2478
02:03:39.330 --> 02:03:41.750
how it gets complicated, right? Uh, THAT it's not,

2479
02:03:41.810 --> 02:03:44.370
yeah, great, male and female, but like maybe they're

2480
02:03:44.370 --> 02:03:47.970
not actually all in the reproductive pool producing offspring.

2481
02:03:49.259 --> 02:03:52.009
Right. No, I, I wanted to ask you that

2482
02:03:52.009 --> 02:03:56.250
because, and I hope I'm not misrepresenting his view,

2483
02:03:56.370 --> 02:03:59.200
but as I said, I've interviewed earlier this year,

2484
02:03:59.330 --> 02:04:03.790
Doctor Charles Roseman, and he said that there were

2485
02:04:04.669 --> 02:04:09.080
one or two points where you disagreed with each

2486
02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:12.370
other when it comes to how to think about

2487
02:04:12.370 --> 02:04:14.640
sex. And one point that he made is that

2488
02:04:14.686 --> 02:04:18.755
He thought that, particularly in the case of humans

2489
02:04:18.755 --> 02:04:23.116
and for the pur for social and political purposes,

2490
02:04:23.315 --> 02:04:27.835
he didn't think that people claiming that sex in

2491
02:04:27.835 --> 02:04:35.655
humans is non-binary really serves their purposes. Uh, I

2492
02:04:35.655 --> 02:04:37.675
yeah, I, I mean, I actually agree with him

2493
02:04:37.675 --> 02:04:39.315
on that. I think actually most of the points

2494
02:04:39.315 --> 02:04:42.021
of contention. AND I would often have is how

2495
02:04:42.021 --> 02:04:46.461
to say things. He has not, like, he has

2496
02:04:46.461 --> 02:04:49.162
the most beautiful writing. It's, it's actually quite the

2497
02:04:49.162 --> 02:04:51.421
joke that he uses the scalpel and I use

2498
02:04:51.421 --> 02:04:55.021
the sledgehammer. I am very blunt about things and

2499
02:04:55.021 --> 02:04:57.961
he is so eloquent. And so we have very

2500
02:04:57.961 --> 02:04:59.622
different styles when it comes to writing, and I

2501
02:04:59.622 --> 02:05:01.742
think that can lead to us maybe not always

2502
02:05:01.742 --> 02:05:03.782
understanding what the other is saying, even though we're

2503
02:05:03.782 --> 02:05:06.040
good friends and we get along just fine. A

2504
02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:09.109
binary is absolutely going to be useful in many,

2505
02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:12.439
many circumstances and claiming that the majority of people

2506
02:05:12.439 --> 02:05:14.479
do not fit within a binary, that would be

2507
02:05:14.479 --> 02:05:18.430
false. The majority do. The the caveat there is

2508
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:21.029
there are those who don't, and again, because they

2509
02:05:21.029 --> 02:05:23.470
don't, that should not determine how we treat them,

2510
02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:25.629
that we don't consider them lesser, that they aren't

2511
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:28.430
people because they don't fit within a binary as

2512
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:30.709
we typically see it. So yeah, for a lot

2513
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:32.830
of things, a binary does make perfect sense and

2514
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:35.600
it does exist with exceptions.

2515
02:05:36.430 --> 02:05:40.020
Right. And I mean, I also uh tend to

2516
02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:42.500
agree with that point and uh I'm trying to

2517
02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:48.049
be respectful of uh trans people, non people who

2518
02:05:48.049 --> 02:05:52.060
identify as non-binary and daughters like that because I

2519
02:05:52.060 --> 02:05:56.060
also don't think that. Um, I mean, they need

2520
02:05:56.060 --> 02:05:59.830
to argue on the basis of sex to defend

2521
02:05:59.830 --> 02:06:02.419
their position. They can just argue on the basis

2522
02:06:02.419 --> 02:06:08.270
of gender and say that, for example, gender doesn't

2523
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:11.870
need to be non-binary also because gender is a

2524
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:15.479
social construct. So if you just, if we just

2525
02:06:15.479 --> 02:06:20.149
as a society, change that and decide that it's

2526
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:25.310
no longer binary. I guess that's perfectly fine and

2527
02:06:25.319 --> 02:06:29.310
and and it serves, uh, also it would serve

2528
02:06:29.310 --> 02:06:35.029
also their social and political uh purposes,

2529
02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:38.359
yeah, I mean. I, I, I, I am not

2530
02:06:38.359 --> 02:06:40.950
somebody who, who knows the deep roots of activism

2531
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:43.040
and how it comes about and how they decide

2532
02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:45.640
to formulate the messages. Uh, I, I think it

2533
02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:47.479
complicates things for sure that if they were to

2534
02:06:47.479 --> 02:06:49.439
like move more towards a gendered language than a

2535
02:06:49.439 --> 02:06:52.240
sex language, people might. No, I'm not actually that's

2536
02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:54.479
not true. People would just have just as many

2537
02:06:54.479 --> 02:06:56.799
problems, like the, the people who are transphobic, it

2538
02:06:56.799 --> 02:06:58.379
doesn't matter. No matter what language you use, they're

2539
02:06:58.379 --> 02:06:59.609
still gonna have a problem with it when it

2540
02:06:59.609 --> 02:07:01.250
comes down to it. But to go to the

2541
02:07:01.250 --> 02:07:02.930
point of like, you know, what Charles was saying

2542
02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:05.140
about, you know, there isn't a binary, you know,

2543
02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:09.290
there there is, again, broadly, overall, there is, uh,

2544
02:07:09.330 --> 02:07:12.209
and on average it does work. But again, how

2545
02:07:12.209 --> 02:07:14.930
useful is that binary for the questions you are

2546
02:07:14.930 --> 02:07:18.819
asking and how you're testing them. Uh, AND so

2547
02:07:18.819 --> 02:07:21.490
on like, you know, scientifically, you really need to

2548
02:07:21.490 --> 02:07:23.450
think about things of whether a binary makes sense

2549
02:07:23.450 --> 02:07:25.140
or not. When it comes into the social world

2550
02:07:25.140 --> 02:07:28.419
and the activist world. Is using sex a great

2551
02:07:28.419 --> 02:07:31.299
idea? I honestly don't know versus gender. I do

2552
02:07:31.299 --> 02:07:33.620
know that people are still gonna spout hate no

2553
02:07:33.620 --> 02:07:36.140
matter what term you use. Um, YOU know, we

2554
02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:38.790
saw this with, um, you know, the gay and

2555
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:42.580
lesbian community and you know, the 70s and 80s

2556
02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:45.140
and hell, even early 90s to that point, that

2557
02:07:45.140 --> 02:07:47.950
like it's terrifying and they're ruining marriages and the

2558
02:07:47.950 --> 02:07:50.060
traditional family, but hey, guess what, now they can

2559
02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:53.339
marry and the world did not collapse in on

2560
02:07:53.339 --> 02:07:56.720
itself. Shocker, I know, and it's just there always

2561
02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:58.589
seems to be a new group of people for

2562
02:07:58.589 --> 02:08:03.029
other people to hate, to to marginalize and ostracize

2563
02:08:03.029 --> 02:08:05.990
and hate and and it's gonna take a probably

2564
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:07.549
longer than we all want it to to move

2565
02:08:07.549 --> 02:08:10.029
through this current one. I, I think we will

2566
02:08:10.029 --> 02:08:12.390
get there, but in this moment I think them

2567
02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:14.950
changing their language is not gonna change anything for

2568
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:17.709
the people who are very against transgender individuals.

2569
02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:21.910
Uh, ALSO, I guess that we can also mention

2570
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:25.589
here that if the simple fact that there would

2571
02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:30.149
be people in the society that wouldn't necessarily identify

2572
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:35.669
as men or women or just identify as non-binary

2573
02:08:35.669 --> 02:08:40.584
or somewhere in between would lead to. Societal collapse,

2574
02:08:40.745 --> 02:08:44.665
then there would have been many more societies out

2575
02:08:44.665 --> 02:08:46.444
there already collapsing.

2576
02:08:47.104 --> 02:08:52.305
My, my grandfather was convinced that if they legalized

2577
02:08:52.305 --> 02:08:56.895
gay marriage, the population would collapse because apparently legalizing

2578
02:08:56.895 --> 02:09:00.745
gay marriage means everybody then becomes gay and they

2579
02:09:00.745 --> 02:09:05.439
will never have children. And it's just like that

2580
02:09:05.439 --> 02:09:07.509
is a wild thinking that like that's not what

2581
02:09:07.509 --> 02:09:09.359
that means. This just means that we are giving

2582
02:09:09.359 --> 02:09:11.919
rights and recognition to people who do not identify

2583
02:09:11.919 --> 02:09:14.399
the same way we do. Just because you make

2584
02:09:14.399 --> 02:09:16.439
it acceptable and legal does not make everyone going

2585
02:09:16.439 --> 02:09:20.160
to do it. Just like left-handedness. Left-handedness was super

2586
02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:22.399
uncommon for a very long period of time because

2587
02:09:22.399 --> 02:09:24.319
it was associated with being evil and a mark

2588
02:09:24.319 --> 02:09:26.839
of the devil. And once that belief kind of

2589
02:09:26.839 --> 02:09:29.640
went away, guess what? You got a bunch of

2590
02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:32.529
left-handed people all of a sudden because it wasn't

2591
02:09:32.529 --> 02:09:36.810
ostracized and it wasn't marginalized, uh, and so yeah,

2592
02:09:36.919 --> 02:09:38.540
I, this is the moment in time we are

2593
02:09:38.540 --> 02:09:40.439
with the society and and the current focus is

2594
02:09:40.439 --> 02:09:46.479
on transgender individuals and It's causing so much harm,

2595
02:09:46.770 --> 02:09:51.439
uh, that it's, it's deeply saddening and frustrating to

2596
02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:52.290
to see it play out.

2597
02:09:53.129 --> 02:09:56.890
And also, I, I don't understand at all if

2598
02:09:56.890 --> 02:10:02.569
that argument they make was true how Samoan society

2599
02:10:02.569 --> 02:10:07.850
hasn't collapsed yet with the fa'afafine there. And even

2600
02:10:07.850 --> 02:10:12.680
more dramatically, how Indian society keeps. Growing with the

2601
02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:13.919
third sex.

2602
02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:17.839
Yeah. There's, there are tons of cultures that have

2603
02:10:17.839 --> 02:10:20.850
different genders that like there isn't a binary gender.

2604
02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:24.359
There are multiple gender categories, and one even changes

2605
02:10:24.359 --> 02:10:26.589
gender throughout life course, and, and, you know, how

2606
02:10:26.589 --> 02:10:29.359
they're viewed by their culture. And it just kind

2607
02:10:29.359 --> 02:10:32.450
of comes from People don't like things that they

2608
02:10:32.450 --> 02:10:36.080
can't easily put into boxes. Our minds really like

2609
02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:37.839
clean cut things that we can put in one

2610
02:10:37.839 --> 02:10:39.839
box or the other, and we get very flustered

2611
02:10:39.839 --> 02:10:42.640
when we realize there's added variation and complication to

2612
02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:45.319
things. And I get that. Like, we all like

2613
02:10:45.319 --> 02:10:49.290
uncomplicated things, but that's just not how humans work

2614
02:10:49.290 --> 02:10:51.520
or biology works. It's just not the way of

2615
02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:51.720
it.

2616
02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:55.779
Yeah, and it's also not as fun to have

2617
02:10:55.779 --> 02:11:00.660
uncomplicated things because that's also why I like to

2618
02:11:00.660 --> 02:11:03.240
discuss with someone like you on the show about

2619
02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:08.129
hunting. And also people who come from the other

2620
02:11:08.129 --> 02:11:10.970
side because I mean, for me, it's just fun

2621
02:11:10.970 --> 02:11:11.600
to have,

2622
02:11:11.890 --> 02:11:13.609
uh. You're gonna get a lot of hits on

2623
02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:16.009
this and, and likely from people you don't want

2624
02:11:16.009 --> 02:11:18.609
to get hits from the, uh, the woman, the

2625
02:11:18.609 --> 02:11:21.649
Hunter Scientific American article and then the Scientific American

2626
02:11:21.649 --> 02:11:25.970
article with Charles Roseman were like the two topmost

2627
02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:28.930
view getting articles in Scientific American that I have

2628
02:11:28.930 --> 02:11:32.060
seen. Um, THEIR, their typical cover stories might get

2629
02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:35.470
300 to 50,000 views. Woman the Hunter got over

2630
02:11:35.470 --> 02:11:39.220
2.1 million. Oh my God. Yeah, and then the,

2631
02:11:39.229 --> 02:11:42.540
the, the sex one with Charles got like 400

2632
02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:47.049
to 500,000 and so like. It it gets traction

2633
02:11:47.049 --> 02:11:48.490
and you know we got thrown to the wolves

2634
02:11:48.490 --> 02:11:50.290
a little bit knowing trolls would be coming after

2635
02:11:50.290 --> 02:11:53.250
it, but like, you know, it's, it gets the

2636
02:11:53.250 --> 02:11:54.120
attention for sure.

2637
02:11:54.370 --> 02:11:57.520
Well, at least one thing is true for sure,

2638
02:11:57.689 --> 02:12:01.629
and a scientific American must be happy with that.

2639
02:12:02.890 --> 02:12:04.729
Very likely, very happy. I still need to get

2640
02:12:04.729 --> 02:12:06.490
the cover framed at some point and put it

2641
02:12:06.490 --> 02:12:08.649
up on my wall, but I've been very lazy

2642
02:12:08.649 --> 02:12:09.049
about that.

2643
02:12:09.779 --> 02:12:12.120
OK, great. So, uh, I mean, perhaps this is

2644
02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:14.279
a good point for us to wrap up the

2645
02:12:14.279 --> 02:12:17.160
interview. I mean, is there anything else you would

2646
02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:21.990
like to add what we talked during this long

2647
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.870
conversation?

2648
02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:26.399
We covered so much. It was just like so

2649
02:12:26.399 --> 02:12:29.509
many things. Um, I'm about to spend the next

2650
02:12:29.509 --> 02:12:32.020
year in Finland, which is really exciting collecting data,

2651
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:33.939
so I figured I'd throw that out there too.

2652
02:12:34.229 --> 02:12:36.950
Um, I'm not entirely sure of the, the full

2653
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:39.750
viewing folks for your show, but I am looking

2654
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:41.910
for grad students as well, so if somebody is

2655
02:12:41.910 --> 02:12:44.310
interested in working with me, please, please contact me.

2656
02:12:44.810 --> 02:12:47.020
And you know what, people who disagree with me,

2657
02:12:47.069 --> 02:12:49.669
you can contact me too if you are willing

2658
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:51.790
to have a reasonable conversation and not tell me

2659
02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:54.299
I'm to blame for the existence of women firefighters,

2660
02:12:54.509 --> 02:12:56.390
then I am more than happy to talk with

2661
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:58.430
you about the evidence for Woman the Hunter.

2662
02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:01.629
Yeah, also people who are interested in that, they

2663
02:13:01.629 --> 02:13:06.549
can just come on my YouTube particularly and, uh,

2664
02:13:07.049 --> 02:13:10.649
put all the hate comments there, which I will

2665
02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:14.770
promptly ignore because that's my ammo. But anyway, you're

2666
02:13:14.770 --> 02:13:15.069
free to go.

2667
02:13:16.290 --> 02:13:18.930
My favorite is always people commenting like she doesn't

2668
02:13:18.930 --> 02:13:20.450
look like she could hunt and I'm just like,

2669
02:13:20.529 --> 02:13:24.819
oh. Oh, it's a thing they did very little

2670
02:13:24.819 --> 02:13:27.069
research into my background as a former power lifter

2671
02:13:27.069 --> 02:13:29.109
and I'm actually pretty good at archery too, and

2672
02:13:29.109 --> 02:13:31.709
it just cracks me up about these assumptions people

2673
02:13:31.709 --> 02:13:34.649
make because I'm a woman academic, clearly I'm not

2674
02:13:34.649 --> 02:13:36.350
capable of physical activity, uh.

2675
02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:40.790
No, you're just pure intellect, and you should be.

2676
02:13:41.839 --> 02:13:44.080
How could I be? I'm a woman, Ricardo. I

2677
02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:46.160
got the smooth lady brain that keeps me from

2678
02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:48.040
thinking, and I just want to pop out babies

2679
02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:48.629
all the time.

2680
02:13:48.879 --> 02:13:50.680
Uh, YES, everyone.

2681
02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:54.600
That's sarcasm, everybody, so it doesn't get taken out

2682
02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:57.279
of context. It totally will be, uh, but whatever.

2683
02:13:57.990 --> 02:14:01.040
OK, and where can people find you on the

2684
02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:01.430
internet?

2685
02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:04.399
Uh, SO I am on, I think like most

2686
02:14:04.399 --> 02:14:06.120
of the social media things and because I have

2687
02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:09.250
an unusual name, it's easy to find me. Um,

2688
02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:11.819
ON Twitter, it's at Kara Akabak and that's C

2689
02:14:11.819 --> 02:14:14.160
A R A O C O B O C

blue sky and threads and mastodon and Don't find

me on Facebook. I only keep that for close

2693
02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:23.620

2701
02:14:41.589 --> 02:14:44.540
absolute delight and my guess is you're probably gonna

02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:46.680
go to bed soonish there in Portugal.

2703
02:14:46.890 --> 02:14:49.680
Uh, NO, it's still 4 p.m. so it's

2704
02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:51.839
only a 5 hour difference. OK. It's 7 hours

2705
02:14:51.839 --> 02:14:54.160
in Finland and I don't always remember where things

2706
02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:58.259
