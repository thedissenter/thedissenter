00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.840
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs, and

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.090
today I'm joined by Doctor Paul Eastwick. He's professor

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.569
of psychology at the University of California, Davis. And

5
00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:15.470
today we're going to talk about his new book,

6
00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.680
Bonded by Evolution, The New Science of Love and

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.610
Connection. So Doctor Westwick, welcome back to the show.

8
00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.110
It's always a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.430
Yes, thanks so much for having me back.

10
00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.729
OK, so, I mean, I would like to start,

11
00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.459
I guess that in our first conversation, we've already

12
00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:34.930
touched on this a little bit, but I would

13
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.490
like to start by asking you a more general

14
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.290
question. So, what is the psychology of attraction and

15
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.450
close relationships and what got you interested in studying

16
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.729
it?

17
00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.090
Yeah, so, you know, this is the portion of

18
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.049
academic psychology that I consider to be my home.

19
00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:57.889
Um, WE are the folks who study initial attraction

20
00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:01.110
and ongoing close relationships, and the general idea is,

21
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.819
you know, we want. To get people's subjective experiences

22
00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:08.339
of what is it like to be in a

23
00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:11.139
close relationship, what are the challenges that they face,

24
00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:14.220
what are the rewards that people are able to

25
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.699
find by being in close relationships, and how do

26
00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:20.470
those relationships form in the first place. So, often

27
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.050
we're studying how people navigate that entire process and,

28
00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:27.790
you know, it's challenging, but when we do it

29
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.830
well, we're able to study relationships really from the

30
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.349
moment that two people meet all the way up

31
00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:36.510
through the breakup. So it's, it's very challenging, but

32
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.889
it's also a very rewarding topic to explore.

33
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.139
So, but the book is bonded by evolution, and

34
00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:49.639
in the book you mention that at least originally

35
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.839
you were interested in tackling attraction and close relationships

36
00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:58.260
through the lens of evolutionary psychology, correct? So I

37
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.885
mean, What do you make of the way that

38
00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:08.005
evolutionary psychologists approach mating and relationships and uh perhaps

39
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:10.845
tell us a little bit of what uh I

40
00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:14.604
mean uh drove you perhaps away from that kind

41
00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:16.625
of approach that they have.

42
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.529
Yeah, it's interesting because, you know, when I first

43
00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.610
encountered evolutionary psychology, I'm, you know, I'm like in

44
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.509
high school, right? So I'm a long way from,

45
00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.250
you know, practicing any of this kind of science

46
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.380
myself. But I remember having these twin thoughts, which

47
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.080
were simply Wow, how fascinating is it that we

48
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.350
can achieve insights into the, you know, why modern-day

49
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.800
relationships are challenging by drawing from evolutionary principles, and

50
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.960
that there are these threads that connect who we

51
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.080
are today to our ancestors as they might have

52
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.000
lived tens or hundreds or thousands of or even

53
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.360
millions of years ago. And at the same time,

54
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.800
The story, at least the story that I was

55
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.410
getting as filtered through, you know, popular media, was,

56
00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.559
it it was very grim. It really seemed like,

57
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.119
boy, relationships were tough, and, you know, you kind

58
00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:16.240
of got lucky if you could make one work

59
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.320
even for a little while, and men and women

60
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.750
were forever at odds, and I just remember thinking,

61
00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:27.149
like, gosh, is it really this bleak out there?

62
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.770
And, you know, it would be a while before

63
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.050
I came to sort of figure out how to

64
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.210
resolve the tension in those two ideas, but that

65
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.690
was what hit me at first. What a fascinating

66
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.309
idea, but something feels incomplete about this story.

67
00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.050
Mhm. Right, and, and so, I mean, what do

68
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.410
you think about their uh methodology, particularly the way

69
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.009
they study, uh, mating, mating preferences and so on

70
00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:00.419
in men and women based generally on, Surveys and

71
00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.949
studying those preferences in the lab, I mean, what

72
00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:03.929
do you make of that?

73
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.059
Yeah, it's so it, it's, it's tough. I mean,

74
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.020
I, I'll be the first to admit like it

75
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.860
can be really hard to study attraction, to study

76
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.420
relationship formation, especially, and to do it well. When

77
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.980
I entered the field about 20 years ago, I

78
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.480
remember being a little surprised that the methods were

79
00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:30.720
As I, I guess, uniform as they were, you

80
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.160
know, when people started studying, like, oh, what makes

81
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.399
for somebody appealing as an attraction partner or as

82
00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:40.359
a close relationship partner, they, they were doing this

83
00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:43.119
in the early part of the 20th century, and

84
00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:45.720
they were passing out surveys that asked people to

85
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.459
like rate how much you care about various traits.

86
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.040
Now, I think we can learn a lot from

87
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.299
doing methods like that. But that was like the

88
00:04:54.299 --> 00:04:57.420
1930s, and when I entered grad school in the

89
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.540
2000s, that was like a lot of what we

90
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.260
were still doing. And it just seemed like we

91
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.690
kinda got stuck in some paradigms that were pretty

92
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.220
simple, like, oh, like, here's a depiction of a

93
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.899
person, you know, an online profile, somebody you'll never

94
00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:18.209
meet, what do you think of this person? And

95
00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:23.049
we hadn't really gotten into studying people's real relationships

96
00:05:23.049 --> 00:05:25.679
as they unfolded over time. Now, later, I would

97
00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:27.899
discover that there were some people out there that

98
00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:30.369
were doing this, but that's what I remember really

99
00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:32.570
sticking with me was the sense of like, oh,

100
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.559
we've been doing it like this for, for 80

101
00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:37.010
years, and I, I think by now, We could

102
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.940
maybe make some of these studies a little bit

103
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.230
more realistic and a little bit more immersive.

104
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.049
So, I, I mean, what do you make, um,

105
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.089
what do you think perhaps are the limitations of

106
00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:55.329
evolutionary psychology in this domain of mating and romantic

107
00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:56.089
relationships?

108
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.459
Yeah, so it, it's a good question. And the,

109
00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.929
the way that I talk about this in the

110
00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:01.950
book, and I, I think we'll, we'll later hit

111
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.070
uh these in a little bit more detail, but

112
00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:08.450
I think there are sort of three misconceptions or

113
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.489
exaggerations that we get from the popular evolutionary psychological

114
00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:16.649
story. One of them is the idea that like

115
00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:19.769
mate value is the end all be all. The

116
00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:23.549
second is that men and women are really different.

117
00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:27.290
And the third one is that you can kind

118
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.489
of specialize in uh short-term relationships or you can

119
00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:35.769
specialize in long-term relationships, but like, you kind of

120
00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:39.089
gotta pick a lane. I think those are the

121
00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:41.970
three big ideas that have turned out to have

122
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.690
some major shortcomings as the science has, you know,

123
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.760
advanced over the last, you know, 10 or 20

124
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.049
years.

125
00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.339
Right, and we're certainly going to get a little

126
00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:54.220
bit later into the issues with all of those

127
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.109
ideas, with mate value, with sex differences, and so

128
00:06:58.109 --> 00:07:00.899
on. Uh, WHAT do you think are the most

129
00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:06.660
common misconceptions we are told about romantic relationships? I

130
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.779
mean, not considering just, uh, evolutionary psychology, but in

131
00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:14.470
our sort of culture, what, what we tend to

132
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.480
we.

133
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:19.290
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no, it's, it's a great question.

134
00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:21.070
And it, it was actually one of the things

135
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.190
that working on this book really helped me to

136
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.029
see a little bit more clearly, like, you know,

137
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:27.910
I, I understand how to read the science and

138
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.350
critique the science and, and all of this is

139
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.829
great and this is what scientists do and I've

140
00:07:32.829 --> 00:07:36.239
enjoyed being part of that process. But I realized

141
00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:37.559
too, when you go out there and you just

142
00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:40.399
talk with everyday, you know, people who are looking

143
00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:42.640
around and paying attention, is that some of these

144
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.959
evy ideas, it's like they got, you know, squeezed

145
00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:48.519
through, you know, a, a, a toothpaste tube, and

146
00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:50.510
what what comes out the other side is like

147
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:55.049
this funhouse mirror version of evolutionary psychology. Where, you

148
00:07:55.049 --> 00:07:58.649
know, you get stuff like the rules, right? I

149
00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:00.609
mean, you know, that was the 90s where we

150
00:08:00.609 --> 00:08:03.010
got the rules. That was a famous book that

151
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.579
basically was like, women, you need to play coy

152
00:08:06.579 --> 00:08:09.250
to attract a man, but like, also to have

153
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.890
a good relationship and basically, sort of, like, never

154
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.489
let him see your vulnerabilities. I mean, advice like

155
00:08:15.489 --> 00:08:18.545
this. IS, you know, according to the Sciences of

156
00:08:18.545 --> 00:08:21.475
Close Relationships, absolutely bananas. I mean, it would be

157
00:08:21.475 --> 00:08:24.674
hard to point to something that is more off-base

158
00:08:24.674 --> 00:08:26.915
than that. But there's a bunch of examples like

159
00:08:26.915 --> 00:08:30.315
this. I mean, in our culture, everywhere, you see,

160
00:08:30.434 --> 00:08:32.875
well, oh, you know, is, is she like somebody

161
00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:34.914
who's just good for a fling or is she

162
00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:37.325
somebody you'd wanna bring home to meet your parents?

163
00:08:37.715 --> 00:08:43.075
And these distinctions um really have very little support

164
00:08:43.075 --> 00:08:45.729
in the science and You know, part of writing

165
00:08:45.729 --> 00:08:47.809
this book made me realize like, oh, I think,

166
00:08:47.929 --> 00:08:49.750
I think people need to hear this.

167
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:56.840
Yeah, I agree. So what have we really evolved

168
00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.609
to look for in a potential partner? I mean,

169
00:09:00.739 --> 00:09:04.599
what do we really want out of attachment bonds?

170
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.960
Yeah, so, so I, I think the most concise

171
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.320
way that I can put this is that what

172
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.719
people evolved to do in the evolutionary story that

173
00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:17.940
I take from the science is that people evolved

174
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:23.299
to find compatibility. In small networks. We evolved in

175
00:09:23.299 --> 00:09:26.340
a context where you didn't know that many other

176
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:31.330
people. And among these very few people that you're

177
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.010
gonna try to make something work with, what people

178
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.770
were mainly on the lookout for was more, not

179
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:41.010
like, who's the best. But rather, who do I

180
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.369
click with especially well, and in large part that's

181
00:09:44.369 --> 00:09:47.929
because, well, we would go on to form these

182
00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:52.650
longer term interdependent relationships with people for the purpose

183
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.609
of raising these very, very helpless offspring that humans

184
00:09:56.609 --> 00:10:00.494
tend to have. And so, That process of like

185
00:10:00.494 --> 00:10:04.674
finding somebody that you click with very well, because

186
00:10:04.815 --> 00:10:08.174
ideally, you're gonna form a close attached relationship with

187
00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:11.054
that person, I think that is a more useful

188
00:10:11.054 --> 00:10:13.375
way to think about, you know, if you want

189
00:10:13.375 --> 00:10:16.414
like sort of a guiding principle for human mating,

190
00:10:16.614 --> 00:10:18.414
I would put it in that territory.

191
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.320
And I, I mean, a, a sort of a

192
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.330
broader question, why have we evolved to bond even

193
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.549
in the first place?

194
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.469
Yeah, right, I mean, it's a fascinating question, and,

195
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.679
and we're very different than many of our closest

196
00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:39.150
relatives among the other primates, right? I mean, chimpanzees

197
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.840
don't bond in the way humans do, nor do

198
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.150
gorillas, you know. Nor do orangutans, probably gibbons, come

199
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.549
the closest, but we evolved in the last couple

200
00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:54.619
million years, the ability to bond with romantic partners,

201
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.309
and of course, other close people in our lives.

202
00:10:58.989 --> 00:11:03.400
The main reason why is that we are social

203
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.760
creatures. We, we, we need to be around other

204
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.229
people. We need other people to have our backs,

205
00:11:08.239 --> 00:11:11.799
or we simply wouldn't have survived when we were

206
00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:14.419
out, you know, trying to get by as hunter-gatherers.

207
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.989
But, Attachment bonds, you see this throughout different portions

208
00:11:18.989 --> 00:11:22.070
of the animal kingdom, when it's very important to

209
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.710
have high levels of investment in offspring by both

210
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:31.229
mating partners, where you need both males and females

211
00:11:31.229 --> 00:11:34.109
to be contributing to offspring or those offspring are

212
00:11:34.109 --> 00:11:37.669
not gonna make it. So, part of the reason

213
00:11:37.669 --> 00:11:41.780
you see attachments between adult romantic partners is is

214
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.750
sort of those twin reasons. One is that, well,

215
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.539
we need support from close others around us, or

216
00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:49.229
else our need to belong isn't met and we

217
00:11:49.229 --> 00:11:52.169
aren't going to thrive as people. But also there's

218
00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:56.289
this practical, you know, very evolutionarily sensible reason too,

219
00:11:56.609 --> 00:11:59.450
that being in an attachment bond, being in an

220
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.849
interdependent relationship, that's likely to work out better for

221
00:12:02.849 --> 00:12:05.520
the offspring that you're have to having to invest

222
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.650
very heavily in.

223
00:12:07.989 --> 00:12:10.919
OK, so I guess that we can already tackle

224
00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:14.059
one of the two big issues in regards to,

225
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.039
uh, the story, let's call it that way, that

226
00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:20.440
comes out of evolutionary psychology that you mentioned earlier,

227
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:25.320
so. When it comes to sex differences, are there

228
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.780
really big sex differences when it comes to mate

229
00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.820
preferences to what we look out for in a

230
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.059
partner, what we prefer, or do you think that

231
00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:38.820
what we tend to get from evolutionary psychology in

232
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.159
terms of sex differences is a bit exaggerated?

233
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.979
I think it's quite exaggerated. Now here when we're

234
00:12:46.979 --> 00:12:51.299
talking about mate preferences. Um, I'm gonna use that

235
00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:54.960
term to refer to the traits or the attributes

236
00:12:55.179 --> 00:12:59.239
that men and women want in a partner. And

237
00:12:59.419 --> 00:13:01.979
I'm, I'm somewhat agnostic about whether we're talking about

238
00:13:01.979 --> 00:13:05.340
initial attraction settings or whether we're talking about ongoing

239
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:09.419
close relationships. Uh, I think my conclusions apply the

240
00:13:09.419 --> 00:13:12.419
same on this point in both cases. But if

241
00:13:12.419 --> 00:13:14.979
we're thinking about what are the traits you want

242
00:13:14.979 --> 00:13:18.729
in a partner. Um, IT is very true that

243
00:13:18.729 --> 00:13:23.229
men and women will say they want different things,

244
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.489
but I think all of the work that we've

245
00:13:26.489 --> 00:13:30.330
seen looking at what men and women actually want

246
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.650
in a romantic partner, it turns out that those

247
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:39.510
sex differences are very, very small. OK. Do you,

248
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:40.429
do you want me to do, do you want

249
00:13:40.429 --> 00:13:42.250
me to do more detail about like what,

250
00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:44.809
how we do that, yes, yes, please,

251
00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:50.010
yeah, so. In the paradigms that capture what I

252
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.739
would call what men and women say they want

253
00:13:51.739 --> 00:13:55.099
in a partner, these paradigms are very straightforward and,

254
00:13:55.179 --> 00:13:56.919
you know, you, you can do this at home.

255
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.820
Um, YOU come up with a questionnaire like, oh,

256
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.140
how much do you want your ideal partner to

257
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:07.979
have attributes like attractive or um ambitious, uh, have

258
00:14:07.979 --> 00:14:13.010
high earning potential, be sexy, OK. Um, THOSE kinds

259
00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.770
of attributes, you'll see gender differences such that men

260
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.609
will say they care about attractiveness and sexiness more

261
00:14:18.609 --> 00:14:21.549
than women, and women will say they care about

262
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.169
ambition, success, earning potential more than men. It's not,

263
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.539
not like every woman says that. It's not like,

264
00:14:27.609 --> 00:14:31.150
you know, many, many men and women don't fit

265
00:14:31.369 --> 00:14:34.450
that depiction, but on average, that is what you

266
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:39.010
see. All right. But, That's sort of, you know,

267
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:43.049
people's ideas about what they want. What I wanna

268
00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:46.250
know is, if you're meeting a set of women,

269
00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:50.109
let's say, and you, you know, they're gonna vary

270
00:14:50.109 --> 00:14:52.409
in, let's say, how attractive they are, or they're

271
00:14:52.409 --> 00:14:55.770
gonna vary in how ambitious they are. I want

272
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.330
to know, are you especially drawn to, are you

273
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.789
especially attracted to, let's say, the ambitious rather than

274
00:15:03.789 --> 00:15:07.539
the less ambitious women? To what extent is ambition

275
00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:10.960
an aphrodisiac for you when we're talking about the

276
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.280
real people who you might be meeting? Sometimes we

277
00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.359
call that a revealed preference. It's, you know, how

278
00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:19.880
much you like the trait as you experience that

279
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.809
trait among a set of real people. And speed

280
00:15:23.809 --> 00:15:25.890
dating was a useful way to look at this.

281
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.450
Speed dating is not the only way to look

282
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.369
at this, but it's one very useful way, and

283
00:15:29.369 --> 00:15:31.880
I think a very legible way for people. Because

284
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.330
you can imagine, oh, I'm gonna, you know, meet

285
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.849
these 10 people, and let's say 5 are ambitious

286
00:15:36.849 --> 00:15:39.090
and 5 are not. How much do I like

287
00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.250
the ambitious folks more than the less ambitious folks?

288
00:15:42.849 --> 00:15:45.609
When you do studies this way, what you see

289
00:15:45.609 --> 00:15:49.760
is that, not surprisingly, the women uh like the

290
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.289
ambitious guys a little bit more than the unambitious

291
00:15:53.289 --> 00:15:56.969
guys. But what you also see is that the

292
00:15:56.969 --> 00:16:00.700
men like the ambitious women, a little more than

293
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:06.500
the unambitious women, and that gender difference is non-existent

294
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.460
in study after study, those gender differences are reliably

295
00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.140
zero. I mean, they are, it is not there.

296
00:16:15.539 --> 00:16:18.739
So, that's why we often talk about this interesting

297
00:16:18.739 --> 00:16:22.619
phenomenon where you get reasonable size gender differences when

298
00:16:22.619 --> 00:16:25.460
you ask people, oh, you know, draw up your

299
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.049
ideal partner for me, what does it look like?

300
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.099
But when we look at how much traits actually

301
00:16:30.099 --> 00:16:32.979
appeal to people in the moment when they're thinking

302
00:16:32.979 --> 00:16:35.340
about real-life people that they've met or that they're

303
00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.099
in a relationship with, we don't see those same

304
00:16:38.099 --> 00:16:39.780
gender differences for those traits.

305
00:16:41.419 --> 00:16:44.890
OK, so, uh, why is it then that if

306
00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:47.010
we ask men and women, of course I'm not

307
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.859
saying that it's every time the same way they

308
00:16:49.859 --> 00:16:51.809
give the same answer and every man and every

309
00:16:51.809 --> 00:16:54.820
woman gives the same answer, but why is it

310
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:58.825
that they're at least in surveys. We get uh

311
00:16:58.835 --> 00:17:00.864
those average differences.

312
00:17:01.195 --> 00:17:03.155
Yeah, this is a good question, and in some

313
00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:06.555
ways, this is the vanguard of the science right

314
00:17:06.555 --> 00:17:09.314
now. So I, I can tell you my suspicions,

315
00:17:09.435 --> 00:17:11.954
although there, there's only like a couple studies along

316
00:17:11.954 --> 00:17:14.635
these lines, but here are a couple answers. One

317
00:17:14.635 --> 00:17:17.435
is that when people tell you what they want

318
00:17:17.435 --> 00:17:21.180
in a partner, Um, it's kind of hard for

319
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.219
people to separate two things. One is, how much

320
00:17:25.219 --> 00:17:28.368
will that trait ultimately appeal to me, like, do

321
00:17:28.368 --> 00:17:32.300
people have insight into their revealed preferences? That's a

322
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.099
little tricky for people. Um, BUT also what people

323
00:17:36.099 --> 00:17:39.140
do, and they do this very easily, is they

324
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:44.540
kind of reiterate a stereotype or a description of

325
00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:49.270
what members of their preferred gender are like. So,

326
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.150
what I mean by that is that, you know,

327
00:17:51.229 --> 00:17:52.829
you asked me like, how much do I like

328
00:17:52.829 --> 00:17:54.869
these traits, and so I bring to mind like

329
00:17:54.869 --> 00:17:58.109
an ideal woman. Well, an ideal woman is more

330
00:17:58.109 --> 00:18:04.449
characterized by attractiveness, for example. Um, THOSE traits that

331
00:18:04.449 --> 00:18:07.770
I've been talking about, attractiveness and earning potential, those

332
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.290
are attributes that do differ by gender. In other

333
00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.810
words, uh, women will tell you that they are

334
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.729
more attractive than men, than what men will say

335
00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:21.689
about themselves. Also, independent coders will agree that on

336
00:18:21.689 --> 00:18:24.569
average, women are just more attractive than men are.

337
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.569
This is, this is a gender difference. It's a

338
00:18:27.569 --> 00:18:30.560
kind of an overlooked one. Um, AT the same

339
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.060
time, like, you know, it's still true that men

340
00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.599
earn more than women, so I think that might

341
00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:38.599
be a stereo, and I, I use the word

342
00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:41.640
stereotype in a purely descriptive way here, that men

343
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.839
are describing that stereotype, like, well, they don't think

344
00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:47.780
women are likely to be as ambitious. So when

345
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.500
people describe their partner preferences, I think there's like

346
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:56.400
stereotypey stuff that sneaks in there that isn't necessarily

347
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.339
connected to what we desire. You're just describing what

348
00:18:59.339 --> 00:19:03.180
people of the other gender are like. Um, SO

349
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.420
I think that's part of it. Um, I've also

350
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.380
seen a, a real, really interesting recent paper suggesting

351
00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.079
that, Part of the reason men say they care

352
00:19:11.079 --> 00:19:13.900
about attractiveness more is linked to the fact that

353
00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.770
men on average have a stronger sex drive. So,

354
00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.140
it's like an epi phenomenon of that gender difference.

355
00:19:20.219 --> 00:19:22.260
And, and this is, I think, another important point

356
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.890
is that many times when you see a gender

357
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.500
difference, it's actually a reflection of like this other

358
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.619
thing that we already know about. And so, I,

359
00:19:30.699 --> 00:19:33.180
I think that also could be uh happening here

360
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:33.800
as well.

361
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.670
OK, OK, so, uh, let's talk a little bit

362
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.699
about what makes a relationship successful in the long

363
00:19:41.699 --> 00:19:45.380
term, particularly, because we tend to hear very commonly

364
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.180
that there's sort of these, you know, calibrated mix

365
00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:53.739
of similarities and differences for a romantic relationship to

366
00:19:53.739 --> 00:19:57.619
be successful. Um, IS there anything to that? I

367
00:19:57.619 --> 00:19:58.939
mean, is that true at all?

368
00:20:00.109 --> 00:20:06.030
Um, IT'S tricky because it's not like you can

369
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:11.510
assess the attributes of different people and try to

370
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.109
figure out who is gonna be able to make

371
00:20:15.109 --> 00:20:17.390
it work because, oh, they share all the right

372
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.390
attributes, and, you know, who's gonna be a terrible

373
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.069
match because they don't share the right attributes, or

374
00:20:23.069 --> 00:20:25.630
they or they share some attributes that's gonna make

375
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:30.500
their pairing particularly toxic. It would be really, really

376
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.300
wonderful if we could do things like this. But

377
00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:39.800
the reality is, um, it's, it's been far harder

378
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.819
than even I think we anticipated 5 or 10

379
00:20:42.819 --> 00:20:46.819
years ago to document who is likely to end

380
00:20:46.819 --> 00:20:50.140
up being compatible with whom, from the things that

381
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.569
people would report about themselves. Ahead of time. So,

382
00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.530
in many ways, you know, it, it's, it is

383
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.489
another one of the great mysteries that I try

384
00:20:58.489 --> 00:21:00.550
to unpack in the book is that, you know,

385
00:21:00.729 --> 00:21:04.369
we believe that compatibility is really central. And you

386
00:21:04.369 --> 00:21:07.089
can see the importance of compatibility in a number

387
00:21:07.089 --> 00:21:11.890
of ways, but trying to document exactly who is

388
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:16.010
compatible with whom is remarkably difficult. And, you know,

389
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.410
it's like one of the reasons that I'm like

390
00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.910
generally really excited about this topic in a, in

391
00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:21.869
a scientific way.

392
00:21:23.209 --> 00:21:26.339
OK, so, uh, do we have, uh, I guess

393
00:21:26.339 --> 00:21:28.459
that we don't have a good understanding, but do

394
00:21:28.459 --> 00:21:32.260
we have at least an understanding of what makes

395
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.119
a relationship successful in the long term?

396
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:39.060
Oh, absolutely. I mean, if you're following relationships over

397
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.339
time, you can certainly point to, you know, the

398
00:21:42.339 --> 00:21:45.650
various features that are gonna make some relationships, uh,

399
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:50.660
more caring, closer, um, sort of more effective at

400
00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.719
supporting each other than others, and, You know, it,

401
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.609
I, I, I think it's useful to point to,

402
00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.920
uh, these are, um, insights that come from attachment

403
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.060
theory. Um, IT'S useful to think about things like,

404
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.819
um, who can you go to when you feel

405
00:22:06.819 --> 00:22:10.199
like things are not going your way and you

406
00:22:10.199 --> 00:22:13.079
need support. You need somebody to like be there

407
00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:15.989
for you, to experience a sense of being unconditionally

408
00:22:15.989 --> 00:22:19.030
accepted. So you can kind of gather yourself and,

409
00:22:19.109 --> 00:22:21.349
you know, get up off the mat. That is

410
00:22:21.349 --> 00:22:25.729
a key feature of close relationships, um, that is,

411
00:22:25.819 --> 00:22:28.239
is very, very important. So people who can support

412
00:22:28.239 --> 00:22:31.319
each other in that way, those relationships are much

413
00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:33.420
more likely to be successful in the long term.

414
00:22:33.949 --> 00:22:35.869
And you got the mirror image of that same

415
00:22:35.869 --> 00:22:40.280
thing, where who's gonna be there to celebrate my

416
00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.760
successes? Who's gonna be there to push me to

417
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.959
do the especially difficult thing, even though I might

418
00:22:45.959 --> 00:22:48.800
fail, but I'm excited about it, but I'm nervous

419
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.510
about how it's gonna turn out, like, having somebody

420
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.010
who's got your back in that way too, is

421
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.515
also very important. Um, SOMETIMES We call these things,

422
00:22:56.535 --> 00:22:59.854
um, uh, safe haven and secure base. Those are

423
00:22:59.854 --> 00:23:02.625
the attachment terms. But really, what it means is,

424
00:23:02.814 --> 00:23:04.805
who's gonna be there when I'm down and who's

425
00:23:04.805 --> 00:23:08.094
gonna be there to celebrate my successes? And, you

426
00:23:08.094 --> 00:23:10.175
know, if you can point to relationships where people

427
00:23:10.175 --> 00:23:13.655
can do this well, that is an absolutely central

428
00:23:13.655 --> 00:23:16.135
predictor that uh things are, are gonna go well

429
00:23:16.135 --> 00:23:16.775
in the future.

430
00:23:18.189 --> 00:23:21.349
Something that people always also talk a lot about

431
00:23:21.349 --> 00:23:24.750
is about types. I mean, oh, that person is

432
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.349
my type, that person over there is not my

433
00:23:27.349 --> 00:23:31.989
type. Is there really a type of person that

434
00:23:31.989 --> 00:23:34.339
is sort of the best mate for us?

435
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.709
Yeah, not really, I mean this is, and, and

436
00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:39.589
this is kind of connects back to some of

437
00:23:39.589 --> 00:23:42.800
the issues with the gender differences, right, because, Well,

438
00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.000
all right. So, maybe men and women, like, you

439
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.920
know, their insights about what they want in a

440
00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.000
partner isn't quite right, but let's take gender out

441
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.880
of it for a second. Surely, if Ricardo, you

442
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.479
say that you really want a partner who's especially

443
00:23:57.479 --> 00:24:01.685
intelligent, and I want a partner who's Especially adventurous.

444
00:24:02.015 --> 00:24:04.494
Well, if I, you know, set you up with

445
00:24:04.494 --> 00:24:06.775
somebody who's very intelligent, and, you know, I'm set

446
00:24:06.775 --> 00:24:09.535
up with somebody who's very adventurous, um, that's gonna

447
00:24:09.535 --> 00:24:12.724
make us happier than if I had accidentally switched

448
00:24:13.204 --> 00:24:15.574
to what we said we wanted and, and ended

449
00:24:15.574 --> 00:24:18.194
up with the inverse partners. Well, it turns out,

450
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.750
It actually doesn't matter all that much. In other

451
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:24.510
words, the things you say you're looking for, I

452
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.270
mean, if I ask you to draw up what

453
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:30.290
are your three key deal breakers in a partner,

454
00:24:30.829 --> 00:24:34.119
um, yeah, you're probably likely to like somebody more

455
00:24:34.119 --> 00:24:36.890
who has those attributes, you know, let's say, OK,

456
00:24:37.069 --> 00:24:40.750
somebody who's intelligent and somebody who's successful and somebody

457
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:44.790
who's sexy. So it's true, you'll like that person

458
00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:49.390
more, but if you had, again, accidentally gotten somebody

459
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.869
with the three other attributes that I would have

460
00:24:51.869 --> 00:24:54.829
picked, you'd be just as happy. And so, that's

461
00:24:54.829 --> 00:24:57.189
why we talk about, like, people not really having

462
00:24:57.189 --> 00:24:59.469
a type. It's not that people are just like

463
00:24:59.469 --> 00:25:03.270
listing traits randomly, people are listing traits that are

464
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:07.030
desirable, but when they do that, they don't really

465
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.699
seem to have unique insight into what it is

466
00:25:09.699 --> 00:25:13.459
that they want specifically. Sometimes I like to use

467
00:25:13.459 --> 00:25:16.900
a restaurant metaphor, and just imagine, you know, you

468
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.859
and your friends at the table are ordering off

469
00:25:18.859 --> 00:25:21.500
the same menu, you order different things, but when

470
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.439
the waiter comes, the waiter mixes up the orders,

471
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.660
and you all end up with uh, with different

472
00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.670
dishes, not what you. Ordered. Well, if that's like

473
00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.819
relationships, then what would happen is, you'd all eat

474
00:25:31.819 --> 00:25:33.469
your food and you'd all be equally happy, and

475
00:25:33.469 --> 00:25:35.189
it wouldn't have mattered that the waiter messed up

476
00:25:35.189 --> 00:25:38.310
your order. So, I, I, I do think this

477
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.449
gets to the problem of like, why we don't

478
00:25:40.449 --> 00:25:42.709
really have a type in the end.

479
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.949
OK, so let's tackle uh the another one of

480
00:25:47.949 --> 00:25:51.250
the three pillars of what you call the evil

481
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.050
script in your book or the script coming from

482
00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:59.550
evolutionary psychology. Do we have made value?

483
00:26:00.369 --> 00:26:04.050
Yeah, I think main value is this idea, like,

484
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:07.500
boy, is this thing huge out there. I would

485
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.619
say that we have a mate value, and it

486
00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:15.699
matters in initial attraction settings. So when people are

487
00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:19.260
initially getting to know one another, it is true

488
00:26:19.579 --> 00:26:23.219
that we seem to get sized up based on

489
00:26:23.219 --> 00:26:27.180
our observable attributes. We consider some people to be

490
00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.619
the, you know, very desirable tens, and other people

491
00:26:30.619 --> 00:26:33.819
are the more middling sixes, and some people are

492
00:26:33.819 --> 00:26:38.589
the undesirable ones or twos. So, um, in initial

493
00:26:38.589 --> 00:26:42.209
attraction settings, there's some of that going on. Um,

494
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:45.790
I, I think it's less of that than we're

495
00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:49.390
commonly led to believe, but there is some amount

496
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.780
of mate value that is tangible and present in

497
00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:56.670
initial interactions. I think the kicker though, and the

498
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.810
thing that I would surprise a lot of people.

499
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.560
Is that in order for that kind of mate

500
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.510
value to matter, what it really requires is that

501
00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:11.119
people agree about how desirable somebody is. Like, when

502
00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:13.219
I talk about like, oh, this person's a 10,

503
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.319
if, if people don't agree that this person's a

504
00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:18.000
10, right, if there aren't a bunch of people

505
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.099
who are like, oh, yeah, like she's super hot.

506
00:27:20.479 --> 00:27:24.199
If, if people aren't agreeing, then that's a meaningless

507
00:27:24.199 --> 00:27:27.329
statement that I'm making. And, and again, what, in

508
00:27:27.339 --> 00:27:30.810
initial attraction settings, yeah, there's agreement. There's agreement about

509
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.969
who is attractive and who is middling attractiveness and

510
00:27:33.969 --> 00:27:36.839
who's not attractive in initial attraction settings. But what's

511
00:27:36.839 --> 00:27:39.489
fascinating is that as people get to know each

512
00:27:39.489 --> 00:27:44.469
other, that consensus goes down. In other words, when

513
00:27:44.469 --> 00:27:46.310
people have spent a lot of time in each

514
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:50.010
other's presence, we agree less and less about, like,

515
00:27:50.109 --> 00:27:53.500
who the most desirable people are. At first, everybody,

516
00:27:53.589 --> 00:27:56.180
you know, wants to date Naomi cause she's super

517
00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.619
hot, but after a few weeks, some people Also

518
00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:01.339
thinks she's super hot, and some people have kind

519
00:28:01.339 --> 00:28:03.339
of cooled on her. Maybe they don't like her

520
00:28:03.339 --> 00:28:05.979
sense of humor. Maybe, I don't know, there's, you

521
00:28:05.979 --> 00:28:07.859
know, something else that, you know, she doesn't seem

522
00:28:07.859 --> 00:28:10.660
that kind to other people. But for whatever reason,

523
00:28:10.729 --> 00:28:13.300
a few people have now soured on her, and

524
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.989
now you see more disagreement with time. What that

525
00:28:16.989 --> 00:28:21.660
means is that there's more room for quote unquote

526
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.060
6s to date quote unquote 10s, because, well, the

527
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.859
10 has a very, very favorable opinion of the

528
00:28:29.859 --> 00:28:32.420
person that everybody else would uh consider a 6.

529
00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:37.140
So it's like mate value wears off as people

530
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.280
get to know. EACH other. And I, I think

531
00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.430
for a lot of people, that's a good thing

532
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:44.359
and kind of a reassuring message because it means

533
00:28:44.359 --> 00:28:46.640
like, hey, even if you don't have it all

534
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.040
going for you in an initial impression setting, you

535
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.880
know, with time, you know, a lot of people

536
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.599
can find, you know, can find their niche and

537
00:28:55.599 --> 00:28:58.160
can find other people who will ultimately find you

538
00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:58.719
appealing.

539
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.810
What do you make of the distinction that evolutionary

540
00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:09.550
psychologists make between short-term and long-term forms of human

541
00:29:09.969 --> 00:29:13.290
mating, and I mean, is it really that some

542
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:17.890
people prefer dating short-term and other people long-term?

543
00:29:18.599 --> 00:29:22.430
Yeah, I think this is a really tricky concept,

544
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.829
because on the one hand, as you like look

545
00:29:24.829 --> 00:29:27.119
around the world, it seems obvious that, well, yeah,

546
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.160
like some relationships are casual, and there, there are

547
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.479
one night stands, and we see those, and those

548
00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:37.160
seem very different in many ways from when you

549
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:42.329
look at a long term ongoing close relationship. And

550
00:29:42.329 --> 00:29:45.729
I think it's tempting to think, well, this must

551
00:29:45.729 --> 00:29:50.709
be because people have like different modes of mating,

552
00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.430
and what they kind of figure out as they

553
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:55.750
grow up and get some experience is like, OK,

554
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.469
I, I'm really good at the long-term thing. So,

555
00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.589
I'm gonna focus my efforts there and try to

556
00:30:01.589 --> 00:30:06.189
land a long-term partner, versus, oh, like, I seem

557
00:30:06.189 --> 00:30:08.949
to be pretty desirable, so maybe I can end

558
00:30:08.949 --> 00:30:11.829
up having a lot of short-term relationships and have

559
00:30:11.829 --> 00:30:15.609
success that way. And it leads us to think

560
00:30:15.609 --> 00:30:19.530
about a dimension, where you're either good at the

561
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:22.849
long-term thing on the one hand, or you're good

562
00:30:22.849 --> 00:30:26.209
at the short-term thing on the other hand. Um,

563
00:30:26.469 --> 00:30:30.160
THAT is not a great way of thinking about,

564
00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:33.949
uh, the, the distribution of people out there in

565
00:30:33.949 --> 00:30:36.420
the world. Um, AND I say that for a

566
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:40.069
number of reasons, but probably the, the clearest illustration

567
00:30:40.069 --> 00:30:44.250
of why this isn't helpful is that there's really

568
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.469
no indication at all that being the kind of

569
00:30:47.469 --> 00:30:51.589
person who's, you know, sexy and is maybe desirable

570
00:30:51.589 --> 00:30:56.194
initially in attractive. SETTINGS, there's no indication at all

571
00:30:56.194 --> 00:31:00.224
that these people are gonna be worse long-term partners.

572
00:31:00.515 --> 00:31:02.194
And then on the flip side, if you look

573
00:31:02.194 --> 00:31:05.954
at the people who come across as very kind,

574
00:31:06.155 --> 00:31:08.944
very warm, very sensitive, the attributes that we would

575
00:31:08.944 --> 00:31:13.829
associate with long-term relationships. There's no indication that these

576
00:31:13.829 --> 00:31:18.109
folks do any better or worse in the short-term

577
00:31:18.109 --> 00:31:20.750
realm. They, many of them have had plenty of

578
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.390
short-term relationships, and many of them have not had

579
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.349
a whole lot of short-term relationships. So these things

580
00:31:25.349 --> 00:31:28.739
end up being kind of independent. Of each other.

581
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.880
And ultimately, I think it's more useful to think

582
00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:38.079
about a process of uncertainty reduction as people um

583
00:31:38.079 --> 00:31:40.319
get into relationships and kind of figure out where

584
00:31:40.319 --> 00:31:43.680
a given relationship is going. Because many times, short-term

585
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.020
relationships are the relationships that kinda didn't go anywhere.

586
00:31:48.119 --> 00:31:50.420
Like, you had some amount of sexual attraction, but

587
00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:54.599
that was really it. Whereas long-term relationships are commonly

588
00:31:54.599 --> 00:31:56.130
things where, you know, you didn't know where this

589
00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:58.640
was going, you spent some time together, you felt

590
00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.489
attracted to each other, and then it kind of

591
00:32:00.489 --> 00:32:05.489
kept escalating. So, this is why we often encourage

592
00:32:05.489 --> 00:32:08.689
people to think about relationships as these arcs over

593
00:32:08.689 --> 00:32:11.339
time, that can be short or can be long

594
00:32:11.339 --> 00:32:13.910
or can be anywhere in between. But it's not

595
00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:17.989
about like seeking certain kinds of people for certain

596
00:32:17.989 --> 00:32:20.910
kinds of relationships, that that really isn't all that

597
00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.449
well supported by the science.

598
00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.859
What do you think about the idea of a

599
00:32:26.859 --> 00:32:28.900
mating market?

600
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.979
Yeah, yeah, I think that the, the mating market

601
00:32:32.979 --> 00:32:35.219
feels very prominent that day, and I think, I

602
00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:39.020
think the apps are reinforcing this to some extent,

603
00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:41.780
because boy, does that feel like a market. I

604
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.199
mean, there you are, you're putting yourself out there,

605
00:32:44.469 --> 00:32:47.619
uh, you're literally a product for somebody else to

606
00:32:47.619 --> 00:32:51.199
say yes or no to, and that's gonna determine,

607
00:32:51.219 --> 00:32:57.000
uh, ultimately how well you do. Um But this

608
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.959
idea is, it's tightly connected to the concept of

609
00:32:59.959 --> 00:33:03.280
mate value, right? Because in a mating market, well,

610
00:33:03.359 --> 00:33:05.040
how well are you gonna do on that market?

611
00:33:05.109 --> 00:33:07.630
It's gonna depend on, on what your value is,

612
00:33:07.699 --> 00:33:10.979
and it's really gonna get people to focus on

613
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.800
how they fit into that hierarchy. Are you a

614
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.040
10, are you a 6, are you a 2?

615
00:33:17.329 --> 00:33:20.449
I think if one lives one's life, I don't

616
00:33:20.449 --> 00:33:23.170
recommend this, but if one lives one's life by

617
00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:27.969
like trying to hit on strangers, or just using

618
00:33:27.969 --> 00:33:29.969
the apps, trying to pick up people on the

619
00:33:29.969 --> 00:33:36.189
apps, you will experience attraction as a market-like concept,

620
00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:40.270
but, I, I am always compelled to point out

621
00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:44.349
that actually doesn't reflect very well the environment in

622
00:33:44.349 --> 00:33:47.030
which people evolved, which would have been an environment

623
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.949
where, again, it was a small set of people,

624
00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.790
but you were gonna know each other over a

625
00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:53.670
long period of time. That's a lot more time

626
00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.750
to figure out, not like, oh, who's the best

627
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.949
and who's the worst, but rather, who do I

628
00:33:58.949 --> 00:34:02.949
click with especially well? Where is their compatibility here?

629
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.750
By focusing on things like compatibility, we get out

630
00:34:06.989 --> 00:34:09.270
of that market mindset, or at least we can

631
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:12.070
escape it a little bit and not worry so

632
00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.270
much about like, oh, who's the best and who's

633
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:16.850
the worst, but think about, hey, like, you know,

634
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:19.070
this is where the fit is really good, and

635
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.050
this is somebody who makes me really happy.

636
00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:24.208
You know, now that I'm thinking about it, uh,

637
00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:27.500
do you think that the fact that, uh, I

638
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:32.320
mean, usually, or that we evolved in environments where

639
00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:36.208
we, uh, And knew people for a very long

640
00:34:36.208 --> 00:34:38.418
time, learned about them for a very long time,

641
00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:42.560
that perhaps that's one of the reasons why many

642
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.899
times we end up having relationships with, for example,

643
00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:52.389
uh, co-workers or people we went to university with,

644
00:34:52.399 --> 00:34:55.320
or I mean people who we spend more time

645
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:55.659
with,

646
00:34:56.978 --> 00:35:02.520
uh, it's. It is such a profound truism about,

647
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:07.179
about the, the attraction and close relationships literature. These

648
00:35:07.179 --> 00:35:12.540
effects of proximity, it is hard to believe how

649
00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:16.425
huge these effects are. That is, the more time

650
00:35:16.425 --> 00:35:18.745
you spend with somebody, the more opportunities you have

651
00:35:18.745 --> 00:35:23.425
to interact with them are powerfully associated with the

652
00:35:23.425 --> 00:35:25.695
likelihood that at a minimum that you'll end up

653
00:35:25.695 --> 00:35:28.864
being friends with each other and also potentially the

654
00:35:28.864 --> 00:35:33.560
likelihood of forming a relationship with somebody. Um. And

655
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.560
part of that is due to a, you know,

656
00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:39.120
sort of familiarity breeds liking effect. This is a

657
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.479
pretty powerful effect that you see fairly regularly, but

658
00:35:42.479 --> 00:35:44.280
I think part of it too is what I'm

659
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.840
talking about with respect to mate value, that it's

660
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.439
not just that we like people a little more

661
00:35:48.439 --> 00:35:50.320
as we get to know them, but on average,

662
00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.580
we start to disagree more. About various people, how

663
00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.020
much we like them. So, we like each other

664
00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.030
more on average, but also much more disagreement in

665
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:04.139
there, that really presents a lot of opportunities for

666
00:36:04.139 --> 00:36:08.020
people to find partners. So, the environments where, yeah,

667
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.250
you're like meeting people nearby, running into them fairly

668
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:13.699
often. I mean, I recognize I kind of sound

669
00:36:13.699 --> 00:36:15.780
like an old man here, being like, oh, it

670
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.814
was like better in the old days. But like,

671
00:36:18.145 --> 00:36:21.854
there really was some wisdom to the idea that,

672
00:36:22.185 --> 00:36:25.665
hey, you're gonna run into these people repeatedly in

673
00:36:25.665 --> 00:36:27.985
small groups, and this is how a lot of

674
00:36:27.985 --> 00:36:30.385
people are gonna find partners that, that we've like

675
00:36:30.385 --> 00:36:34.225
industrialized this. We've made it a massive market and

676
00:36:34.225 --> 00:36:36.544
we've put it online and you spend 90 minutes

677
00:36:36.544 --> 00:36:39.024
a day swiping. I, I don't think this is

678
00:36:39.024 --> 00:36:41.604
a recipe for happiness for a lot of people.

679
00:36:42.304 --> 00:36:46.250
Mhm. So, uh, uh, you present in the book

680
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:51.449
an alternative to the marketplace idea, so which is,

681
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:55.350
which you call compatibility driven bonding. Uh, uh, TELL

682
00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:58.449
us, I mean, you've been, uh, telling us about

683
00:36:58.449 --> 00:37:02.850
compatibility, but what is compatibility actually? How does it

684
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:03.270
work?

685
00:37:03.709 --> 00:37:06.879
Yeah, so, the way I think about compatibility, I

686
00:37:06.879 --> 00:37:09.919
actually start with a very mathematical way of thinking

687
00:37:09.919 --> 00:37:13.439
about it, which is, it's the connection that I

688
00:37:13.439 --> 00:37:16.479
have to you, that can't be explained by, you

689
00:37:16.479 --> 00:37:19.000
know, I'm like a selective person or, or an

690
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.794
unselective person, it could go out. WAY. So it's

691
00:37:21.794 --> 00:37:25.395
not explained by me alone, and it's not explained

692
00:37:25.395 --> 00:37:28.264
by you alone. Are you popular? Are you unpopular?

693
00:37:28.344 --> 00:37:31.155
OK. So, it's like, once we take out who

694
00:37:31.155 --> 00:37:33.395
I am in general and who you are in

695
00:37:33.395 --> 00:37:36.354
general, is there something special that I feel for

696
00:37:36.354 --> 00:37:40.620
you above and beyond all that? That's the portion

697
00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:45.239
of attraction that's due to compatibility. There's something special.

698
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.530
Between us. That's a different, you know, we can

699
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:52.010
identify that, that that's there, even if we can't

700
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.649
quite explain where it comes from. Why is it

701
00:37:54.649 --> 00:37:56.689
that I felt that way to you and not

702
00:37:56.689 --> 00:37:59.610
somebody else. But in general, that's what I'm talking

703
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:03.429
about with compatibility, that there's unique connections between people

704
00:38:03.649 --> 00:38:07.090
that other people don't share. I, I would ask

705
00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.729
people this thought experiment when I, I want people

706
00:38:09.729 --> 00:38:12.050
to get a real like sense of what I'm

707
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.739
talking about when it comes to compatibility. I think

708
00:38:14.739 --> 00:38:18.820
people commonly have the experience, that if they think

709
00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:22.050
about a group of mixed gender friends, and let's,

710
00:38:22.179 --> 00:38:25.459
you know, imagine the various couples that exist in

711
00:38:25.459 --> 00:38:28.439
that group. I bet there are a lot of

712
00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:30.790
people in that group that you like a lot,

713
00:38:31.159 --> 00:38:34.679
but you, it's not like you'd be excited to

714
00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:37.439
trade romantic partners with any of them. I think

715
00:38:37.439 --> 00:38:40.919
it's really cool that, you know, uh Amanda and

716
00:38:40.919 --> 00:38:43.830
George are dating, and I think that's great. I,

717
00:38:43.959 --> 00:38:46.840
I don't quite understand what he sees in her,

718
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.280
but, you know, that's great for them. That idea

719
00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.659
that like, actually, like, people find things in each

720
00:38:53.659 --> 00:38:55.939
other where they think each other are the greatest

721
00:38:55.939 --> 00:38:57.860
and other people are like, OK, if you say

722
00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:01.020
so, that's kind of what I mean by compatibility.

723
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.219
It's the idea that once we get to know

724
00:39:03.219 --> 00:39:07.780
people, we aren't all just trying, you know, vying

725
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.879
for the most desirable person. A lot of times,

726
00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.570
you know, we look at other people's relationships and,

727
00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.739
and, you know, and we think like, oh, that's

728
00:39:15.739 --> 00:39:17.459
great for you, I'm happy for you, but I

729
00:39:17.459 --> 00:39:18.780
don't quite share your opinion.

730
00:39:20.459 --> 00:39:22.780
Uh, WHAT do you think about the idea of

731
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.439
assortative mating?

732
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:29.550
Yeah, so assorted meaning is important. Um, IT kind

733
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.750
of comes in, in two forms that I think

734
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:35.030
are worth disentangling. It's, it's one of these terms

735
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.070
that can mean a bunch of different things. Sometimes

736
00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:41.110
it refers to demographics. It refers to the fact

737
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.310
that educated people will tend to get together with

738
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:46.429
other educated people, and, you know, rich people will

739
00:39:46.429 --> 00:39:50.629
get together with other rich people. And most of

740
00:39:50.629 --> 00:39:55.479
that demographic sorting. IS because of these mechanisms we

741
00:39:55.479 --> 00:40:00.280
were talking about, these proximity mechanisms, familiarity mechanisms, who

742
00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.879
are you more likely to meet? Um, THERE'S a

743
00:40:02.879 --> 00:40:06.360
paper I'm fond of quoting that actually refers to

744
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:11.199
the, the 1860s in, in Britain, um, the reign

745
00:40:11.199 --> 00:40:14.389
of Queen. Victoria. So, uh, Queen Victoria would hold

746
00:40:14.389 --> 00:40:17.979
these balls, where, uh, many of the young men

747
00:40:17.979 --> 00:40:19.790
and women would get together and meet at these

748
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:21.929
balls, and this was Queen Victoria's way of trying

749
00:40:21.929 --> 00:40:25.709
to create couples among the aristocracy. And yes, this

750
00:40:25.709 --> 00:40:28.830
is the plot of Bridgerton. This is actually drawn

751
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.729
from real life. Um, BUT there were a few

752
00:40:31.729 --> 00:40:36.270
years where, uh, Queen Victoria was grieving and didn't

753
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.110
hold the balls. And so what the young people

754
00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:40.879
did during these years is they said, like, well,

755
00:40:40.949 --> 00:40:43.989
I guess I gotta hit the town. Instead of

756
00:40:43.989 --> 00:40:46.669
just meeting the other rich folks, I gotta, you

757
00:40:46.669 --> 00:40:49.350
know, go meet some poor folks, uh, you know,

758
00:40:49.649 --> 00:40:52.350
gotta leave the castle walls, and they did, and

759
00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:57.709
then, again, because proximity and familiarity, they marry these

760
00:40:57.709 --> 00:41:01.189
more common folks, and it actually changes the trajectory

761
00:41:01.189 --> 00:41:06.780
of wealth in Britain. That wealth gets more redistributed

762
00:41:06.979 --> 00:41:09.419
as a result of this. So, that's a great

763
00:41:09.419 --> 00:41:13.860
example of demographic assortative mating, that it, because of

764
00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:17.010
who people meet, things like wealth and education tend

765
00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:20.879
to concentrate. There's a separate kind of assortive mating

766
00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.159
that's based on things like attractiveness. The fact that

767
00:41:24.159 --> 00:41:27.479
attractive people tend to get together with other attractive

768
00:41:27.479 --> 00:41:30.719
people, and that right there is probably the best

769
00:41:30.719 --> 00:41:34.919
evidence that mate value plays an important role. Again,

770
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.989
I think it's easy to overestimate the power of

771
00:41:37.989 --> 00:41:42.659
assortative mating. Um, IT'S not like gargantuan, it, it's

772
00:41:42.659 --> 00:41:46.300
very much present, um, a useful thought experiment to

773
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.699
understand assortative mating. It's like, oh, if there was

774
00:41:48.699 --> 00:41:51.620
a woman standing next to two men and you

775
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.860
had to guess which one was her partner, if

776
00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.139
you pick the one that was closest to her

777
00:41:56.139 --> 00:41:58.820
level of attractiveness, you'd be right about 70% of

778
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.620
the time. But, you know, that's far from determinative,

779
00:42:01.729 --> 00:42:04.350
but, but that's where you're seeing. Uh, SOME of

780
00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:08.419
the, the mate value marketplace forces at work, because,

781
00:42:08.629 --> 00:42:11.389
oh, initially she was more attractive, so if she

782
00:42:11.389 --> 00:42:14.750
got together with somebody, fairly, uh, you know, shortly

783
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:17.429
after meeting them, she was probably also able to

784
00:42:17.429 --> 00:42:19.770
attract somebody else who was pretty appealing at first.

785
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.929
Right. So one of the things uh that we

786
00:42:23.929 --> 00:42:25.830
have to talk about here is the fact that

787
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:28.989
of course when we talk about the science of

788
00:42:28.989 --> 00:42:33.050
close relationships, uh, many times or even most of

789
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:37.750
the time we focus on heterosexual couples, right? But

790
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:41.574
there uh there's also homosexual couples. OR same gender

791
00:42:41.574 --> 00:42:46.534
couples. So, um, do we have, um, um, I

792
00:42:46.534 --> 00:42:50.455
mean, good enough science on them? The sexual orientation

793
00:42:50.455 --> 00:42:54.135
make a difference in terms of, uh, how compatibility

794
00:42:54.135 --> 00:42:58.455
works and, uh, what makes relationships successful?

795
00:42:59.419 --> 00:43:02.260
Yeah, it's, it's an interesting question. A lot of

796
00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.649
what we've seen, I, I, I would suggest, uh,

797
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:11.739
We see many of the similar conclusions apply. So,

798
00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.840
in other words, when we find that mixed gender

799
00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.530
relationships tend to do especially well when people can

800
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:21.050
support each other, when they, you know, support each

801
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:24.010
other in terms of uh uh taking on new

802
00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:29.209
challenges, uh, and, and overcoming setbacks, these conclusions uh

803
00:43:29.209 --> 00:43:33.449
routinely apply. To same-gender relationships as well. So, it's

804
00:43:33.449 --> 00:43:36.520
like many of the broad principles still hold. There

805
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.290
are many cases where, when we can disentangle, um,

806
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:44.610
who is, you know, the, the gender of the

807
00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:46.800
first person in the couple and the gender of

808
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.649
the second person, we can achieve a whole bunch

809
00:43:49.649 --> 00:43:53.530
of fascinating new insights. So, for example, I mean,

810
00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:57.540
this is just one of many, but, Um, when

811
00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:02.860
I'm, um, sort of helping people to understand better

812
00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:07.250
ways of dating, and that it's possible to have

813
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:10.379
mixed gender networks that you're a part of and

814
00:44:10.379 --> 00:44:13.219
meet friends of friends of friends, and that's how

815
00:44:13.219 --> 00:44:15.659
you meet dating partners rather than through the apps.

816
00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.659
Well, you know, people who are members of sexual

817
00:44:19.659 --> 00:44:22.370
minority groups are like, no, duh, like, we've been

818
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:24.933
doing that for a long time. Like, that is

819
00:44:25.022 --> 00:44:30.752
routinely how uh gay men, lesbian women, bisexual folks,

820
00:44:30.952 --> 00:44:33.752
how they've been meeting other people, and they've long

821
00:44:33.752 --> 00:44:36.242
shown, hey, you know what, sometimes, like, you get

822
00:44:36.242 --> 00:44:38.312
together with somebody and you break up with them,

823
00:44:38.423 --> 00:44:40.873
but they're still kind of in your network. And

824
00:44:40.873 --> 00:44:44.633
it's true that uh people with um minority sexual

825
00:44:44.633 --> 00:44:48.716
identities, They're more likely to to inhabit social networks

826
00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:52.216
with people who are exes. But they also illustrate

827
00:44:52.416 --> 00:44:55.295
how that doesn't necessarily have to be a debilitating

828
00:44:55.295 --> 00:44:56.895
thing. I think a lot of times people think

829
00:44:56.895 --> 00:44:58.875
like, yeah, but I wouldn't wanna have to like

830
00:44:59.656 --> 00:45:02.176
keep encountering my ex because we share the same

831
00:45:02.176 --> 00:45:05.016
friends and, you know, gay and lesbian folks are

832
00:45:05.016 --> 00:45:06.535
like, hold my beer, we do this all the

833
00:45:06.535 --> 00:45:06.855
time.

834
00:45:08.689 --> 00:45:12.600
Uh, WHAT do you make of research on mate

835
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:16.439
preferences that is done on dating apps? I mean,

836
00:45:16.689 --> 00:45:19.689
uh, do, should we take, uh, data coming from

837
00:45:19.689 --> 00:45:22.770
dating apps seriously or not?

838
00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:26.300
I think it's useful for illustrating what it's like

839
00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.949
to be on the apps, right? I mean, if

840
00:45:28.949 --> 00:45:33.350
you, if you wanna understand that, uh, often demoralizing

841
00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:37.469
process, um, it, it's useful in that sense. Um.

842
00:45:38.209 --> 00:45:40.600
People do spend a lot of time on the

843
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.879
apps. These are a part of how we find

844
00:45:43.879 --> 00:45:46.879
partners now. I think trying to unpack some of

845
00:45:46.879 --> 00:45:49.840
the enormous gender differences you see on the apps.

846
00:45:49.919 --> 00:45:51.679
I mean, the way I usually talk about the

847
00:45:51.679 --> 00:45:56.485
apps is that they Exaggerate gender differences. They take

848
00:45:56.485 --> 00:46:00.004
modest gender differences in real life, like the fact,

849
00:46:00.084 --> 00:46:02.304
for example, that women are a little bit more

850
00:46:02.304 --> 00:46:04.945
selective than men. I mean, this is true. If

851
00:46:04.945 --> 00:46:08.225
you look at uh live speed dating events, for

852
00:46:08.225 --> 00:46:12.064
example, you'll see that women, you know, they say

853
00:46:12.064 --> 00:46:14.705
yes to the men about 1/3 of the time

854
00:46:14.705 --> 00:46:17.784
at mixed-gender speed dating events, and men say yes

855
00:46:17.784 --> 00:46:20.024
at about 50/50. But if you look at the

856
00:46:20.024 --> 00:46:23.459
apps, Uh, men are still saying yes at about

857
00:46:23.459 --> 00:46:26.620
50/50, and for women, it goes from being, you

858
00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.020
know, 1 out of every 3 to 1 out

859
00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.540
of every 20, they say yes to. I mean,

860
00:46:32.739 --> 00:46:37.639
it, that is an absolutely enormous gender difference. So,

861
00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:40.379
if that's how people are behaving on the apps,

862
00:46:40.719 --> 00:46:44.090
a wild exaggeration of the gender differences that we

863
00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:45.939
see in real life, well, we need to understand

864
00:46:45.939 --> 00:46:47.899
that, but we need to understand it for the

865
00:46:47.899 --> 00:46:51.939
purposes of understanding. Uh, WHAT'S happening on these apps?

866
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.860
How can we make them better? How can we

867
00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:56.139
better help people to find connections? I think it

868
00:46:56.139 --> 00:47:00.219
has even less relevance to like, for example, the

869
00:47:00.219 --> 00:47:03.260
environment in which we evolved, relative to even the

870
00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:05.659
old ways of studying things, asking people what they

871
00:47:05.659 --> 00:47:08.810
want. I mean, people did not evolve in markets

872
00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:11.179
that look anything like what you see on a,

873
00:47:11.219 --> 00:47:12.580
on a modern dating app.

874
00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:17.090
What do you make of terms like high value

875
00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:19.510
man and high value woman?

876
00:47:19.929 --> 00:47:23.090
Yeah, yeah, this, and this is where some of

877
00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:26.689
these classic evolutionary psychological concepts have, have gotten a

878
00:47:26.689 --> 00:47:31.250
lot of traction online and have really, you know,

879
00:47:31.399 --> 00:47:33.370
it, it's become a, a, a set of fun

880
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:38.310
house mirrors out there. So, um, Uh, I think

881
00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:42.850
this is pretty damaging, because again, it reduces people

882
00:47:43.229 --> 00:47:47.639
to a collection of attributes that can be evaluated

883
00:47:47.639 --> 00:47:51.070
by others, probably strangers. Again, that's the model that

884
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.469
people have in mind with this. It's not like,

885
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.879
are your friends frustrated with how much You know,

886
00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:59.169
you only go to them, you know, when you

887
00:47:59.169 --> 00:48:01.350
need help and you aren't there. This isn't about

888
00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:04.479
like, oh, like your friends have some tips for

889
00:48:04.479 --> 00:48:06.010
how you could be a better friend. This is

890
00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:08.290
like, when people take an initial look at you,

891
00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:10.409
when they meet you for the first time, or

892
00:48:10.409 --> 00:48:14.129
even worse when they're like reading like your CV

893
00:48:14.129 --> 00:48:17.729
of attributes, do they think you are valuable or

894
00:48:17.729 --> 00:48:22.949
not? Uh, THIS is, um, a pretty bad way

895
00:48:23.129 --> 00:48:25.610
to think about what is going to make for

896
00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:30.179
romantic success. I'm not saying that there's nothing to

897
00:48:30.179 --> 00:48:33.459
it, like, you know, people wanna, you, like, you

898
00:48:33.459 --> 00:48:36.760
know, work out, like, eat healthy, like, these are

899
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:40.699
good ideas. You can do things to make yourself

900
00:48:40.699 --> 00:48:44.340
more initially appealing, but I think people like, stop

901
00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.520
there. They think like, well, I just got to

902
00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.179
be a higher value and that's gonna do it.

903
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.320
And ultimately, I think that even if people can

904
00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:56.580
improve their quote unquote value, and again, what I

905
00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.310
mean by that is, make yourself initially more appealing

906
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:03.270
by doing things to boost your attractiveness or your

907
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:06.969
initial appeal. That stuff's gonna be pretty small. It's

908
00:49:06.969 --> 00:49:11.550
gonna be marginal compared to the other more social,

909
00:49:11.729 --> 00:49:15.370
more network-related things that people could be doing, if

910
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:18.010
what they wanna do is find more social connections

911
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.389
and hopefully find a partner.

912
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:23.649
Um, DO you think that, uh, I mean, uh,

913
00:49:23.729 --> 00:49:25.729
I'm asking you this, I'm, or I'm going to

914
00:49:25.729 --> 00:49:28.489
ask you this because this is also something that

915
00:49:28.489 --> 00:49:33.580
we are very frequently from, uh, pop, uh, evolutionary

916
00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:38.570
psychology. Uh, DO people really need to change themselves

917
00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:41.790
in order to correspond as best as possible to

918
00:49:41.949 --> 00:49:45.889
an ideal mate to be able to date and

919
00:49:45.889 --> 00:49:46.290
mate?

920
00:49:46.659 --> 00:49:48.659
Yeah, I don't think this is a helpful way

921
00:49:48.659 --> 00:49:50.419
to think about it at all. In fact, you

922
00:49:50.419 --> 00:49:53.439
know, if you look at the close relationships literature,

923
00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.699
the, the people who study ongoing relationships, in many

924
00:49:56.699 --> 00:50:00.100
ways, you, you get the inverse message, which is

925
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:04.959
that, Um, being in a relationship with somebody else

926
00:50:04.959 --> 00:50:06.459
that you're close to, it, it could be a

927
00:50:06.459 --> 00:50:08.520
romantic partner, but it doesn't have to be, right?

928
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:11.320
It can be close friends. These are the things

929
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:15.020
that change us and help us grow closer to

930
00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:18.040
the person we want to be. So, it is

931
00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.439
in many ways the opposite. You don't sort of

932
00:50:21.439 --> 00:50:25.040
go into the lab and, you know, change yourself

933
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.439
into this ideal form and then come out and

934
00:50:27.439 --> 00:50:31.479
everybody loves you. It's, you grow through your relationships

935
00:50:31.479 --> 00:50:35.860
with other people. Discovering new things, by like, taking

936
00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.659
feedback, like the example I gave earlier, like, you're

937
00:50:38.659 --> 00:50:40.629
not being a good friend when you X, Y,

938
00:50:40.679 --> 00:50:43.300
Z. Like, these are important things that people need

939
00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.260
to hear, but this is how people grow. It's

940
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:50.780
through relationships. So, you know, honestly, for, for a

941
00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:54.580
lot of people who are struggling, I'm, I often

942
00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:57.729
want to encourage them, like, I just want you

943
00:50:57.729 --> 00:51:00.330
to like go have friends and hang out with

944
00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:03.370
people, like, maybe don't worry so much about the

945
00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:07.530
romantic desirability part of it, just be part of

946
00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:10.889
some networks again, like be part of some friendship

947
00:51:10.889 --> 00:51:14.050
groups again, go spend time with other people in

948
00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:19.719
person. And let that process help you grow, rather

949
00:51:19.719 --> 00:51:22.479
than this very intentional, like, I gotta rack up

950
00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:25.120
all the right attributes to be appealing. I, I

951
00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.399
think most people will find, will find that process

952
00:51:28.399 --> 00:51:29.600
to be kind of frustrating.

953
00:51:30.899 --> 00:51:32.949
And also, I, I mean, I hope that this

954
00:51:32.949 --> 00:51:35.469
is also backed by science, but I also get

955
00:51:35.469 --> 00:51:39.830
the sense that many times it is through uh

956
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:43.510
being open and vulnerable with other people that we

957
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:47.229
make deep connections, right? It's through Uh, uh, uh,

958
00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:51.899
uh, being, uh, uh, I guess courageous enough to

959
00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:56.629
expose our vulnerabilities to other people that people get

960
00:51:56.629 --> 00:51:58.989
to like us even more and vice versa,

961
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:03.129
100%, I mean. I, I think it's, again, if

962
00:52:03.129 --> 00:52:05.409
you, if you really buy into this, there's a

963
00:52:05.409 --> 00:52:08.010
hierarchy of value and like, you gotta be at

964
00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:10.570
the top, what, what often comes with that is

965
00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:13.719
the suggestion that like, you gotta wall yourself off,

966
00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:16.820
OK? You gotta be very protective, you gotta show

967
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.830
off. The best version of yourself and do not

968
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:22.830
show any weakness, OK? All of this is part

969
00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:26.290
of the same, I, I think, deeply misleading message

970
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:31.929
about the way relationships actually work. Relationships ultimately require

971
00:52:31.929 --> 00:52:36.209
vulnerability. Now, you can't just go around being vulnerable

972
00:52:36.209 --> 00:52:39.090
with everybody all the time. That's not a recipe

973
00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:41.969
for success, but I, I think on average, people's

974
00:52:41.969 --> 00:52:45.770
intuitions are way misaligned with this, that often we

975
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:49.169
need to be more vulnerable with people than we

976
00:52:49.169 --> 00:52:53.669
instinctively are. Um, I point to some research showing

977
00:52:53.669 --> 00:52:57.100
that, Uh, you know, one of the, the best

978
00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:01.540
experimental interventions to, um, to, to sort of gin

979
00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.260
up more liking between two people when they're initially

980
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.500
meeting for the first time, is you get them

981
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:11.939
to answer questions that encourage more vulnerability, more honest

982
00:53:11.939 --> 00:53:15.209
reflection, get them to talk about their deepest fears.

983
00:53:15.379 --> 00:53:18.300
This is sometimes called the fast friends procedure. It's

984
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.060
been around for decades, and it's very reliable. But

985
00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.705
if you can get people to talk about Their

986
00:53:23.705 --> 00:53:28.225
vulnerabilities. Also, talk about what they like about this

987
00:53:28.225 --> 00:53:30.584
other person that maybe they met an hour ago,

988
00:53:30.824 --> 00:53:33.225
like, really get them to open up in that

989
00:53:33.225 --> 00:53:37.504
way. Huge boosts in liking when you get people

990
00:53:37.504 --> 00:53:40.104
to go through this kind of procedure. So, more

991
00:53:40.104 --> 00:53:44.864
vulnerability rather than less, you know, less grandstanding. These

992
00:53:44.864 --> 00:53:47.544
are the, are the roots. The, the, like, popular,

993
00:53:47.584 --> 00:53:49.745
like, like, I gotta be tough, I gotta be

994
00:53:49.745 --> 00:53:52.264
the best, show no weakness. This, this is not

995
00:53:52.264 --> 00:53:52.725
the way.

996
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.979
What do you make of the red pill community

997
00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:02.360
and the manosphere more broadly, because I, I, I

998
00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.080
mean, I mean, at least me personally, when I

999
00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:09.199
look at it, I think it's extremely toxic and

1000
00:54:09.199 --> 00:54:13.060
uh for the most part a cesspool of bad

1001
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:15.360
relationship ideas. Yeah,

1002
00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.219
right, and this, this is the. Pinnacle, right? I

1003
00:54:18.219 --> 00:54:20.459
mean, this is, this is the pinnacle of the

1004
00:54:20.459 --> 00:54:24.459
bad ideas. And this is how, how, um, a

1005
00:54:24.459 --> 00:54:27.260
lot of these, right, the mate value and hierarchy

1006
00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:30.139
ideas have spun wildly out of control. So if

1007
00:54:30.139 --> 00:54:32.219
you think about like the, the black pill, the,

1008
00:54:32.379 --> 00:54:34.409
sorry, the red pill concept that you mentioned, the

1009
00:54:34.409 --> 00:54:38.620
red pill concept, it really is like, oh, you

1010
00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:42.209
know, again, it comes from the Matrix. This idea

1011
00:54:42.209 --> 00:54:43.750
that, oh, I've taken the red pills, and now

1012
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:45.590
I see reality, and now I see that it's

1013
00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:48.600
all about like my desirable attributes. A lot of

1014
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.909
times this is wrapped up in some misogynist ideas

1015
00:54:51.909 --> 00:54:55.429
about like, well, women's preferences are the things that

1016
00:54:55.429 --> 00:54:59.735
matter. And so, you gotta fit women's preferences. And

1017
00:54:59.735 --> 00:55:01.895
they've got all the power, and men are kind

1018
00:55:01.895 --> 00:55:04.175
of helpless in the face of it all. And

1019
00:55:04.175 --> 00:55:08.574
so, a red pill solution to the problem of

1020
00:55:08.574 --> 00:55:11.175
mating would be things like, well, you know, work

1021
00:55:11.175 --> 00:55:15.294
out, learn how to be the alpha guy who

1022
00:55:15.294 --> 00:55:18.550
all the women will want. And again, I think

1023
00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:22.229
this is mostly misguided. I'm not gonna say like

1024
00:55:22.229 --> 00:55:24.219
don't work out. I'm not gonna say don't eat

1025
00:55:24.219 --> 00:55:27.229
healthy. These are useful things to do, but that's

1026
00:55:27.229 --> 00:55:29.350
about where that kind of advice would end for

1027
00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:33.810
me. Um, BUT it all gets then wrapped up

1028
00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:36.899
in a lot of the, like, misogynistic and hate-filled

1029
00:55:36.899 --> 00:55:39.100
ideas that you see online, and, you know, this

1030
00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:41.820
is what we've been living with for the last

1031
00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:45.020
10 to 15 years is, you know, uh, the

1032
00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:49.760
really nasty bad ideas get spread very easily online,

1033
00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:53.340
and there were folks uh who saw some of

1034
00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:57.500
these evolutionary inspired ideas and said, well, yeah, you

1035
00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:00.179
know, we can, we can make that fit. Uh,

1036
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:03.080
SOME of our, uh, you know, nastier ideas about

1037
00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.340
the relationships between men and women, and so we've

1038
00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:08.179
got this whole, you know, horror show version of

1039
00:56:08.179 --> 00:56:10.139
Ev Psych now that exists online.

1040
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:15.280
Yeah, and it can be very dangerous in terms

1041
00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:18.939
of the ideas that it that the red pill

1042
00:56:18.939 --> 00:56:22.199
community and other parts of the manosphere convey about,

1043
00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:26.899
uh, women particularly and all the misogyny surrounding it,

1044
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:27.449
right,

1045
00:56:27.929 --> 00:56:31.260
yeah, right, I think, um, I, I think it's,

1046
00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:33.860
uh, I'm not saying like, oh, it's inevitable that

1047
00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.100
if you like believe in gender differences and you

1048
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:38.379
believe in mate value, then you end up at

1049
00:56:38.379 --> 00:56:42.600
this toxic place. Um, BUT I also think we

1050
00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:47.040
haven't been that good at explaining to people why

1051
00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:50.320
A + B doesn't lead to C. And this

1052
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:54.840
is, I think, wrapped up in some deeper philosophical

1053
00:56:54.840 --> 00:57:01.020
challenges when it comes to advancing evolutionary psychological ideas.

1054
00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.479
And the one that I like to point to

1055
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:07.479
is, um, it's actually something that evolutionary psychologists have

1056
00:57:07.479 --> 00:57:09.750
not spent a lot of time on. And it's

1057
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:15.149
the concept of biological determinism. So, so geneticists have

1058
00:57:15.149 --> 00:57:18.030
to deal with this stuff all the time. Biological

1059
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:20.790
determinism, is, you know, the way that a geneticist

1060
00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:22.550
would talk about it is the idea like, oh,

1061
00:57:22.669 --> 00:57:25.989
you've got this set of genes, and therefore, this

1062
00:57:25.989 --> 00:57:28.949
outcome is gonna happen, and there's not much you

1063
00:57:28.949 --> 00:57:32.260
can do to change it. So, it's as if

1064
00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:37.540
there's few points of intervention, few places to intervene

1065
00:57:37.939 --> 00:57:42.060
between the biological cause and the outcome that, you

1066
00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:47.929
know, you might not want. Um, BIOLOGICAL determinism is

1067
00:57:47.929 --> 00:57:53.250
just not a useful idea, full stop. Because, uh,

1068
00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:56.030
sometimes biological things are easy to change, and sometimes

1069
00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:59.129
biological things are hard to change. And sometimes learned

1070
00:57:59.129 --> 00:58:02.129
things are hard to change, and sometimes learned things

1071
00:58:02.129 --> 00:58:04.090
are easy to change. So whether a thing is

1072
00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:08.649
learned or biological, it does not bear on how

1073
00:58:08.649 --> 00:58:11.750
hard a thing is to change. So the problem

1074
00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:14.915
that starts to happen As these evy ideas get

1075
00:58:14.915 --> 00:58:17.675
filtered into the popular culture, as people hear, oh,

1076
00:58:17.754 --> 00:58:21.514
like, men evolved to experience a lot of, you

1077
00:58:21.514 --> 00:58:24.544
know, desire for sexual variety. They want to have

1078
00:58:24.544 --> 00:58:27.114
sex with many different women. Well, well, I guess

1079
00:58:27.114 --> 00:58:30.239
there's nothing we can do about that. But that

1080
00:58:30.239 --> 00:58:32.760
conclusion, there's nothing we can do about it, that,

1081
00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:35.830
that is, that does not follow at all from

1082
00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:39.070
any sort of statement about how biological it is

1083
00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:41.290
that men do or do not have a strong

1084
00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:43.889
desire for sexual variety. So, these are some of

1085
00:58:43.889 --> 00:58:47.169
like the, the challenges that we need to start

1086
00:58:47.169 --> 00:58:50.050
addressing better. We need to give people the tools

1087
00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:53.449
to realize that like, hey, if something's evolved, that

1088
00:58:53.449 --> 00:58:56.159
doesn't mean that that thing is inevitable, there are

1089
00:58:56.250 --> 00:59:00.489
Many possible points of intervention here. Again, the geneticists

1090
00:59:00.489 --> 00:59:02.090
know this, they've been dealing with this for a

1091
00:59:02.090 --> 00:59:04.610
long time, but, you know, this is a place

1092
00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:07.209
that like, my lab is, is heading these days,

1093
00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:10.129
trying to figure out, like, how exactly do people

1094
00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:12.929
think about whether a thing can be changed or

1095
00:59:12.929 --> 00:59:15.090
not when they learn it's biological, and what can

1096
00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:17.629
we do as scientists to give people the tools

1097
00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:20.060
that, you know, help them to, to be able

1098
00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:21.889
to make the changes where they want to be

1099
00:59:21.889 --> 00:59:22.969
able to make changes.

1100
00:59:24.209 --> 00:59:26.969
Yeah, and it's not just that it's not inevitable,

1101
00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:31.270
but I guess it's also not impermeable to environmental

1102
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:34.649
inputs, right? Because I mean, there's, there's also the

1103
00:59:34.649 --> 00:59:39.010
way we develop our, for example, the attachment styles

1104
00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:41.929
that we develop, the kinds of people that we

1105
00:59:41.929 --> 00:59:44.600
meet, the culture that we live in, even the,

1106
00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:47.449
the sort of economic circumstances we live, and so

1107
00:59:47.449 --> 00:59:50.090
on and so forth, and I guess even uh

1108
00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:54.604
within a. Given relationship, the way that the relationship

1109
00:59:54.604 --> 00:59:56.794
dynamics play out over time,

1110
00:59:57.185 --> 01:00:00.205
right? Yeah, that's exactly right. And look, I, I

1111
01:00:00.205 --> 01:00:04.445
can hear, you know, evolutionary psychologists screaming at me

1112
01:00:04.445 --> 01:00:07.024
right now, saying like, but we don't tell them,

1113
01:00:07.445 --> 01:00:09.725
then it's inevitable. We tell them that there are

1114
01:00:09.725 --> 01:00:12.604
other important environmental forces. And my response to that

1115
01:00:12.604 --> 01:00:15.405
is, yes, I know, but we now know that

1116
01:00:15.405 --> 01:00:18.870
people aren't hearing that part of the message. And

1117
01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:21.010
what we need to be doing, what we need

1118
01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:24.439
to be doing is using our powers of experimentation

1119
01:00:24.439 --> 01:00:27.649
and scientific study to figure out what do we

1120
01:00:27.649 --> 01:00:30.209
need to do to craft the messages, so that

1121
01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:34.090
folks do understand what what exactly what you just

1122
01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:37.729
said. That like, even if there were a biological

1123
01:00:37.729 --> 01:00:39.510
cause, it doesn't mean it's inevitable, it doesn't mean

1124
01:00:39.635 --> 01:00:42.795
that other forces don't matter. Like, what are things

1125
01:00:42.795 --> 01:00:45.275
we can do to encourage more of that kind

1126
01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:50.756
of scientific and evolutionary literacy among people? Because at

1127
01:00:50.756 --> 01:00:53.855
this point, I, I don't see another way of

1128
01:00:53.855 --> 01:00:57.315
combating what's happening online. I mean, it's very clear

1129
01:00:57.476 --> 01:01:00.756
that we're not gonna get like moderation of online.

1130
01:01:00.931 --> 01:01:04.902
Content in any meaningful way anytime soon. So, you

1131
01:01:04.902 --> 01:01:06.822
know, we're the people that talk about this stuff.

1132
01:01:06.862 --> 01:01:08.771
It's important for us to talk about this stuff,

1133
01:01:08.941 --> 01:01:11.461
but let's also, like, try to figure out how

1134
01:01:11.461 --> 01:01:15.281
can people be more receptive to what we mean

1135
01:01:15.281 --> 01:01:18.461
when we talk about evolutionary processes like this, and,

1136
01:01:18.612 --> 01:01:22.162
and sort of improve scientific education in the process.

1137
01:01:23.399 --> 01:01:25.399
So I have one last topic I would like

1138
01:01:25.399 --> 01:01:28.149
to ask you about. What do you think, uh,

1139
01:01:28.239 --> 01:01:30.439
or do you think that, uh, what we've talked

1140
01:01:30.439 --> 01:01:34.360
about here could have implications? I mean, do you

1141
01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.000
think that the knowledge coming from relationship science could

1142
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.280
have implications as to how people can approach dating

1143
01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:48.760
and relationships in industrialized and post-industrial societies, particularly in

1144
01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.280
the 21st century?

1145
01:01:50.699 --> 01:01:55.129
Yeah, I mean, I, I think that, um, the

1146
01:01:55.129 --> 01:01:59.090
close relationships field, relationship science more broadly, there's a

1147
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:02.489
lot of potential for good here. And to the

1148
01:02:02.489 --> 01:02:04.729
extent that we're able to remind people of the

1149
01:02:04.729 --> 01:02:10.270
value of hanging out in small networks, remember to

1150
01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:13.814
meet your neighbors, meet. Friends of friends. I, I,

1151
01:02:13.935 --> 01:02:15.975
there's another thing that you see too happening is

1152
01:02:15.975 --> 01:02:19.114
like, oh, people still have their in-person friends, but

1153
01:02:19.495 --> 01:02:22.774
they don't do like the group things anymore. They

1154
01:02:22.774 --> 01:02:25.135
don't meet the friends of friends anymore. It's, you

1155
01:02:25.135 --> 01:02:27.695
know, it's, it's all one on one. It look,

1156
01:02:27.774 --> 01:02:29.875
one on one can have a lot of value.

1157
01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:34.510
But, I think what our science does well, is

1158
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:37.750
we are really wedded to the idea that there

1159
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:41.879
is something critical and special about what it feels

1160
01:02:41.879 --> 01:02:44.929
like to interact with another person face to face,

1161
01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:47.510
what it is like when you interact with the

1162
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:50.379
same people over and over again on multiple occasions,

1163
01:02:50.739 --> 01:02:55.364
and of course, the importance of Opening yourself up

1164
01:02:55.364 --> 01:02:59.844
to another person, being vulnerable, to even being willing

1165
01:02:59.844 --> 01:03:02.725
to take on some of their needs as your

1166
01:03:02.725 --> 01:03:07.245
own, to not keep score so much about exactly

1167
01:03:07.245 --> 01:03:09.524
who is doing what in this relationship, who is

1168
01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:12.965
getting the best deal, but rather, like, being part

1169
01:03:12.965 --> 01:03:15.324
of a community, being part of a community of

1170
01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:17.445
two, even if it's just the two of you.

1171
01:03:17.949 --> 01:03:21.929
And the these are gonna be healthy avenues for

1172
01:03:21.929 --> 01:03:25.850
the future. Healthy avenues for people's, you know, uh,

1173
01:03:25.899 --> 01:03:28.909
well-being going forward. So, I think there are a

1174
01:03:28.909 --> 01:03:31.310
lot of good lessons in this science that people

1175
01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:34.409
can take. Um, IT, it's not all bleak out

1176
01:03:34.409 --> 01:03:37.209
there. There, there are a lot of wonderful things

1177
01:03:37.209 --> 01:03:39.610
that people get from their close relationships, you know,

1178
01:03:39.729 --> 01:03:42.909
even if, not especially their relationships that aren't necessarily

1179
01:03:42.909 --> 01:03:45.770
romantic. Like there's a lot to be said for

1180
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:48.889
getting together with, with close friends and kind of

1181
01:03:48.889 --> 01:03:50.919
seeing where the night takes you. So, you know,

1182
01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:54.050
