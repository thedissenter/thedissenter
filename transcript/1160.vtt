00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.190
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.230
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.989
today I'm joined by a return guest, Dr. Edward

4
00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:12.920
Watts. He is Vasiliadis Professor of Byzantine Greek History

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.350
at the University of California San Diego, and today

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.750
we're going to talk about his new book, The

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.270
Romans, A 2000 Year History. So Dr. Watts, welcome

8
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.350
back to the show. It's always a pleasure to

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.850
everyone.

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.549
Oh, it's wonderful to be back. I'm, I'm so

11
00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:29.870
excited to talk to you about the book.

12
00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:33.869
Yeah, so we have a lot to cover today.

13
00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:38.509
Let's see how long we can go. So my

14
00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:43.009
first question is, who were or are the Romans,

15
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.909
since in your book you go through 2000 years

16
00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:51.330
of history in Rome, who are the Romans exactly?

17
00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.630
Yeah, I think this is an excellent question. It

18
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.880
seems simple and um for antiquity and for the

19
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.810
Middle Ages, it's of course quite complicated. Um, I

20
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.610
think as a basic rule, I think for everybody

21
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.690
that we're talking about in antiquity in the Middle

22
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.769
Ages, um, if they say they are Roman, we

23
00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:12.889
should take them seriously. And if we cannot understand

24
00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:15.290
why they're saying they're Roman, that's more of a

25
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.449
problem for us than it is a problem for

26
00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:20.120
them. So for the purpose of this book, what

27
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.160
I'm looking at is, you know, the, the group

28
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.319
of people that live in a society that say

29
00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.519
they are Roman. And I think what's remarkable about

30
00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:30.160
Rome and what makes Rome so different from other

31
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.574
ancient and medieval societies is um Romans were completely

32
00:01:34.574 --> 00:01:37.415
willing to bring new people in and make them

33
00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:42.334
Romans. Uh, THIS was something like Sparta. Sparta collapsed

34
00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:44.535
because Sparta could not do this. It couldn't figure

35
00:01:44.535 --> 00:01:47.135
out how to make more Sparades. Instead, they kept

36
00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:50.500
making less. Um, IN Athens, they also struggled to

37
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.180
figure out how to make more Athenians. In Rome,

38
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.150
this was not a problem at all. And so

39
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.769
a society that starts out along the Tiber River

40
00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:01.569
in, you know, the late Bronze Age in Italy,

41
00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.339
um, makes Romans again and again and again and

42
00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:09.190
adapts their ideas and incorporates them into Roman tradition.

43
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.850
And Roman behaviors and Roman political life, um, so

44
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.869
well that you end up with the same Roman

45
00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:20.509
state 2000 years later surviving in Constantinople, 1000 miles

46
00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:24.589
away where the vast majority of people are Greek-speaking

47
00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.470
Christians. Um, AND so the Romans are who they

48
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.970
say they are. Um, AND for them, that's simple

49
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.750
and for us You know, it can be complicated.

50
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.369
It doesn't look at all in the year 1200

51
00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:38.470
like the Roman state in the year 800 or

52
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.029
the year 700 BC and yet those people see

53
00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.309
a really strong connection even though everything about their

54
00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.190
lives are different, the identification as Romans is the

55
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.350
same and, and so for the book's purposes, I

56
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.429
think we take that seriously.

57
00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:56.509
And when does the history of Rome start and

58
00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.470
what is the Roman state?

59
00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.919
Yeah, so the, the starting point is an excellent

60
00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.389
question. Romans believe they know, like the day, right?

61
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.000
The day and the year it started, 753 BC.

62
00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.740
It's, you know, it started on that day because

63
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.720
Romulus set up a settlements around the Palatine Hill.

64
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.839
Our traditions are a little more messy. Um, AND

65
00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.919
so we have all sorts of traditions again because

66
00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.639
the Roman state is continually remaking itself. People who

67
00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.000
belong to, um, other traditions or came from other

68
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.979
places want to see themselves represented in the history

69
00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.600
of the Roman state. And so we have stories

70
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.710
told by say Greek authors in the first century

71
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.199
BC who speak Greek but are Roman and want

72
00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.520
to see Greek and Roman things connected who talk

73
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.100
about About um people wounded in the campaigns of

74
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.860
Hercules who settle at the base of the Palatine

75
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.699
Hill, who ultimately, you know, become part of this

76
00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.460
community that Romulus establishes. Um, YOU have Italians who

77
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.660
tell stories about how, um, you know, there were

78
00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.979
initially, uh, people who came into the Roman state

79
00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:03.419
from other Italian principalities who then also became Roman.

80
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.039
And so you have this sort of ongoing tradition.

81
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.610
Of, you know, predating that 753 BC moment where

82
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.800
the Roman state is created. Historically, we can't say

83
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.488
753 BC for sure is the moment when something

84
00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:21.630
happens at Rome and before that there were no

85
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.690
Romans and after that there was. Um, WHAT we

86
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.010
can say though is sometime in the 8th century

87
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.649
BC it's pretty clear that you have an organized

88
00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:33.170
settlement um centered on the Palatine Hill and now

89
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.000
if you go to the Roman Forum and you

90
00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:37.029
Walked sort of to the back of it towards

91
00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:39.250
the back part of the Palatine Hill. You can

92
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.209
actually still see post holes um that were drilled

93
00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:45.489
into the bedrock from what Romans believed to be

94
00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:48.559
that initial settlement. And more or less, um, this

95
00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.049
corresponds to what we know is going on in

96
00:04:51.049 --> 00:04:54.089
Italy in the 8th century BC to the extent

97
00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:57.570
that um Italians in that period would bury their

98
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.450
dead in, um, you know, the ashes of their

99
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.119
dead in funeral urns shaped like huts. That match

100
00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:07.910
where those post holes would suggest you had huts.

101
00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:09.839
So, you know, our, our sense in the eighth

102
00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.320
century BC that this is an organized community is

103
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.480
pretty good. It's pretty strong. Um, WE don't know

104
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.799
753 BC for sure, but more or less, this

105
00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:21.279
is, this is kind of consistent with what we

106
00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.279
can see going on.

107
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.040
When it comes to the history of Rome, do

108
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.200
you use the same division of periods that scholars

109
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.320
have traditionally used? There is early Rome from the

110
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.200
8th century BC until around 300 BC, the middle

111
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.940
and later phases of the Roman Republic from 300

112
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.119
BC to 31 BC, the high Empire from 31

113
00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:53.239
BC to. 180 AD and the late empire from

114
00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:57.779
180 to 395 AD. I mean, do you use

115
00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.459
that same, or do you use those same periods

116
00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:02.119
or not?

117
00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:05.109
Uh, I try to stay away from that. So

118
00:06:05.109 --> 00:06:07.149
I mean the, the goal in this book is

119
00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:09.390
really to tell the story of the Roman state

120
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.709
in its entirety. And um those periods are extremely

121
00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:16.670
useful because it's very, very difficult as I learned

122
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.630
in writing this book. It's very, very difficult to

123
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.220
tell that entire story. Um, THERE'S a lot of

124
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.670
material that, for example, for the 6th century BC

125
00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:27.070
looks nothing at all like the material you would

126
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.869
use for the 11th century AD. I mean, literally

127
00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:32.890
nothing is the same. Um, AND so it is,

128
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.390
it is very useful and convenient to say, well,

129
00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:37.890
this is, this is where I have the capacity

130
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.769
and I have the interest to tell a particular

131
00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:42.850
Roman story. The problem with that though is there's

132
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.220
nothing about those moments, um, that is so Definitive

133
00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:51.959
that it is worth dividing the life of the

134
00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:54.799
Romans living at that time, um, and you know,

135
00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:57.920
and separating their stories. So every time we decide

136
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.399
we're gonna stop telling that Roman story at a

137
00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.059
certain point, we're in the middle of somebody's life.

138
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.600
And they might recognize that this was a moment

139
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.000
of significant change. I mean the 31 BC they

140
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.320
did recognize at that moment, OK, Octavian has now

141
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.559
won the Battle of Actium, something significant has happened

142
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.420
and yet their lives continued. And so if we're

143
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.019
telling the story of the state as it, you

144
00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:23.399
know, looked to the citizens and to the Romans

145
00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:26.459
living in it, making these divisions in say 300

146
00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:29.019
BC when nobody woke up on New Year's Day

147
00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:31.339
and said, oh my God, like now I'm living

148
00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:33.579
in the, you know, the Middle Republic, everything is

149
00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:37.779
great. Um, WE create an artificial sort of separation

150
00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:40.359
in those stories. And that means we don't appreciate

151
00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:42.700
how that story is going to unfold across that

152
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.019
person's life or also across the life of that

153
00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:48.350
state. And so there are a lot of developments

154
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.510
that take an extremely long time in Rome to

155
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.269
unfold that transcend these traditional periods. And on one

156
00:07:56.269 --> 00:07:58.869
level, that's fine. If you're talking about a traditional

157
00:07:58.869 --> 00:08:00.790
period with a set of evidence that you're comfortable

158
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.790
using, that story might not actually be so important

159
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.709
to you. But if you want to talk about

160
00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:08.070
the Roman state in its totality and you want

161
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.010
to actually understand What it is that makes this

162
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.299
state so unique in lasting for 2000 years. I

163
00:08:14.299 --> 00:08:17.130
mean, every state ends, but no other state lasts

164
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.929
for 2000 years. If we want to understand what

165
00:08:19.929 --> 00:08:22.970
makes Rome so unique and so powerful and so

166
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.829
capable of, of enduring for so long, we need

167
00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:29.290
those stories that transcend these traditional boundaries, and we

168
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.445
need to understand a lot. Lives of the people

169
00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:34.294
that are um functioning and, and living their daily

170
00:08:34.294 --> 00:08:36.695
lives at the moment that we might want to

171
00:08:36.695 --> 00:08:38.484
sort of draw a line and say, OK, well,

172
00:08:38.775 --> 00:08:42.085
I'm done, right? Um, THEY'RE not done. It's, it's,

173
00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:45.094
you know, their 40th birthday. They're still, they've still

174
00:08:45.094 --> 00:08:46.934
got 15 years to live, right? Their story is

175
00:08:46.934 --> 00:08:49.974
continuing and if we stop, we are losing the

176
00:08:49.974 --> 00:08:51.255
last part of their story.

177
00:08:52.349 --> 00:08:55.270
That's very interesting. So, but when it comes to

178
00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:59.270
the earliest period of Rome in the 8th century

179
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:03.229
BC, how well can it be reconstructed?

180
00:09:04.489 --> 00:09:08.750
Not very Um, so I think the, the, uh,

181
00:09:08.869 --> 00:09:11.150
the thing that we have that's quite interesting is

182
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.200
we do have sources that talk about this. Um,

183
00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:17.989
SO, When we, for example, look at sources that

184
00:09:17.989 --> 00:09:20.229
talk about the development of the city of Rome,

185
00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:23.570
some of this is, is mythological, right, right. Romulus

186
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.380
may or may not have been a real person,

187
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.390
but very little of what's said about Romulus is,

188
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.270
you know, factual. It's, it's storytelling. The same is

189
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.380
true of the second king, Numa, who is the

190
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.469
lawgiver who, you know, is, is an almost mosaic

191
00:09:37.469 --> 00:09:39.619
figure and you look at this person, you're like,

192
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.150
oh yeah, we see the lawgiver in lots of

193
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.739
different traditions and Um, not a real person, probably

194
00:09:46.739 --> 00:09:48.880
in most of the sense of what we hear

195
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.559
about them. Uh, BUT we do have things that

196
00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:56.119
suggest, you know, processes unfolding already at that early

197
00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:58.679
moment in, in and around the city of Rome,

198
00:09:58.919 --> 00:10:01.479
um, in and around the Palatine Hill that really

199
00:10:01.479 --> 00:10:04.190
suggests a, a process of development that we can

200
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.809
understand and we can acknowledge probably as Right. So

201
00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:09.489
there's a, a great source that's written many hundreds

202
00:10:09.489 --> 00:10:12.770
of years later um by an antiquarian named Pliny.

203
00:10:13.049 --> 00:10:15.010
Uh AND what Pliny is doing is, is looking

204
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.770
at um records that talk about people who attended

205
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.929
religious festivals and cities that attended religious festivals. And

206
00:10:22.929 --> 00:10:26.159
he mentions three cities that no longer exist. Um,

207
00:10:26.169 --> 00:10:28.929
AND he identifies them as cities that were once

208
00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:31.750
on hills of Rome. Uh, NO, we don't know

209
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.340
that these cities were conquered. What, what seems to

210
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.219
have happened is, you know, the hills in Rome,

211
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.500
some of them are, are relatively large, like the

212
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.619
Esquiline Hill is a pretty large hill. Some of

213
00:10:40.619 --> 00:10:42.539
them are very small. The Capitoline Hill is a

214
00:10:42.539 --> 00:10:45.419
very small hill. Um, AND what seems to have

215
00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:48.179
happened is, you know, settlements started on these, these

216
00:10:48.179 --> 00:10:50.924
hills. And then they got too big for the

217
00:10:50.924 --> 00:10:52.955
hills, so they grew down into the valleys. And

218
00:10:52.955 --> 00:10:56.184
so the Roman Forum is basically the valley between

219
00:10:56.804 --> 00:10:59.085
a set of hills in the central part of,

220
00:10:59.135 --> 00:11:02.484
of Rome and obviously, it's clear what happened there.

221
00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:04.804
The settlements on the hills grew down into the

222
00:11:04.804 --> 00:11:07.885
Forum and they merged. And as they merged, those

223
00:11:07.885 --> 00:11:12.125
settlements became something bigger. And so we don't have

224
00:11:12.125 --> 00:11:14.924
wonderful records from the 8th century BC saying how

225
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.940
that happened. But it's pretty clear from records that

226
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.780
come later what was going on. The other thing

227
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.140
that we can say with, with pretty good conviction

228
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.500
is um there is a process by which the

229
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.289
um Members of the Roman state work together to

230
00:11:32.289 --> 00:11:34.210
choose a sort of government. Now, in the 8th

231
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.690
century BC we don't know exactly how that process

232
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.450
works, but we do know in the 6th century

233
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.169
BC how the process works in a fashion that,

234
00:11:42.229 --> 00:11:46.130
that could work perfectly well for earlier periods. Um,

235
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.739
WHERE you have a hereditary aristocracy that we can

236
00:11:48.739 --> 00:11:52.940
actually document, um, in places like central Italy through

237
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.419
burial remains and other things. They more or less

238
00:11:56.419 --> 00:11:58.739
nominate a king and everybody else then votes to

239
00:11:58.739 --> 00:12:01.059
approve the king. This is exactly what you'd expect

240
00:12:01.059 --> 00:12:04.780
in a small political society. Um, AND as these

241
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.715
settlements grow, you would expect that this could be

242
00:12:06.715 --> 00:12:10.034
scaled up to include the hereditary aristocracy from other

243
00:12:10.034 --> 00:12:12.315
hills. Uh, AND so I think we can see

244
00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:14.695
in the 8th century BC a set of processes,

245
00:12:14.924 --> 00:12:17.994
um, that would make total sense even though we

246
00:12:17.994 --> 00:12:20.234
don't have evidence for them in that period. We

247
00:12:20.234 --> 00:12:23.715
have evidence from later periods that would totally resonate

248
00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:26.275
with what we imagine could be happening in those

249
00:12:26.275 --> 00:12:28.520
moments. Um, AND so this is, I think the

250
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.369
problem and the solution, right? We don't have really

251
00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:35.799
good evidence for politically what's going on in Rome

252
00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:39.229
before about like the mid-sixth century BC, but the

253
00:12:39.229 --> 00:12:41.359
institutions in the 6th century BC are very well

254
00:12:41.359 --> 00:12:44.739
established and they make sense for what would be

255
00:12:44.739 --> 00:12:47.559
their. Before. And so I think we can say

256
00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:50.799
there is a state structure, there's a political structure,

257
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.960
there's a set of ideas that govern how relationships

258
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.919
in this very small society worked, um, that, you

259
00:12:57.919 --> 00:13:01.440
know, would be perfectly consistent as that society grows

260
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.840
with what we see in the 6th century.

261
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.320
OK, so now and I guess for most of

262
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.799
the rest of our conversation we're going to go

263
00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:13.119
through some of the major events and figures in

264
00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:17.039
the history of Rome. So starting with the Roman

265
00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:23.280
Revolution, what was that and who was Servius Tullius

266
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.080
and what role did he play?

267
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.780
Yeah, so this is a great question. So I

268
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.859
mean the moment that we, we sort of shift

269
00:13:29.859 --> 00:13:33.250
from like let's talk about these mythological figures to

270
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.460
let's talk about real figures is roughly the period

271
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.700
right before this Roman revolution happens. Uh, AND so

272
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.500
the, the first king where I feel like we

273
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.809
can say, OK, this is a real person and

274
00:13:43.809 --> 00:13:47.140
we can say real things about them, um, is

275
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.099
what the person who is now marked as the

276
00:13:50.099 --> 00:13:52.020
5th king of Rome. I mean they think he's

277
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.059
way more than the 5th king of Rome, but

278
00:13:54.059 --> 00:13:57.739
he's the, the, um, Third to last king of

279
00:13:57.739 --> 00:14:00.539
Rome, right? There's traditionally 7 kings of Rome. This

280
00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:03.380
is a man named uh Tarquinius Priscus. And what

281
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.859
we know about Tarquinius Priscus is he was not

282
00:14:05.859 --> 00:14:07.340
born in the city of Rome. He was born

283
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.140
in the, the Etruscan city of Tarquinia, uh, and

284
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.609
he's descended from Greek immigrants. And so, um, he's,

285
00:14:13.659 --> 00:14:17.260
his potential for, uh, for life in the city

286
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.619
of Tarquinia is extremely limited and his wife Tanaquil

287
00:14:20.619 --> 00:14:22.489
gets very frustrated by this and says, you know,

288
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.179
we need to immigrate. And so they go to

289
00:14:25.179 --> 00:14:27.099
Rome and we're told they go to Rome because

290
00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:28.780
Rome is a place where it doesn't really matter

291
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.080
what your family background is. If you are capable

292
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.169
and you have um talents that you can provide,

293
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.900
you can rise to leadership. And uh Tarquinius Priscus

294
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.419
does this. You know, he rises to a position

295
00:14:41.419 --> 00:14:45.140
of leadership um because he has, you know, skills

296
00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.080
and talents and things that make the Roman state

297
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.169
better. But the, the king who preceded him, um,

298
00:14:50.299 --> 00:14:53.260
his sons get very upset that Tarqui Phineas Priscus

299
00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.460
has in a sense jumped the line, right? They,

300
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.059
they believe that they should have been considered for

301
00:14:58.059 --> 00:15:00.419
the kingship and they really don't like this idea

302
00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:02.979
of someone who wasn't born in Rome, of Greek

303
00:15:02.979 --> 00:15:06.659
parents, you know, or of Greek ancestry coming to

304
00:15:06.659 --> 00:15:09.479
Rome and becoming king. So they, they arranged to

305
00:15:09.479 --> 00:15:13.669
have him assassinated. And in this assassination, he is

306
00:15:13.669 --> 00:15:16.880
attacked, but he survives for a little while. And

307
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.080
so his wife, while he's still alive, brings him

308
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.280
into the palace, she locks the doors, she kicks

309
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.599
everybody out, uh, and then she summons his military

310
00:15:25.599 --> 00:15:29.239
commander who's a man named Servius Tullius. And Servius

311
00:15:29.239 --> 00:15:32.239
Tullius is actually um the son of a slave.

312
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.849
Right? And so again, this is the story of

313
00:15:34.849 --> 00:15:39.210
Romans taking capable people regardless of their backgrounds and

314
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.099
putting them in positions of authority. And what um

315
00:15:42.099 --> 00:15:45.049
Servius uh what um Tanaquil, the wife of, of

316
00:15:45.049 --> 00:15:47.809
Turquinius Priscus does is she goes onto the balcony

317
00:15:47.809 --> 00:15:50.690
of the palace, she tells everybody he's alive, the

318
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.570
king is OK, he just needs to rest and

319
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.929
for, you know, the time that he's resting, Servius

320
00:15:55.929 --> 00:15:57.489
Tullis is going to be in charge of the

321
00:15:57.489 --> 00:16:00.840
state. It's a lie. He's already dead. Uh, AND

322
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.960
so what happens is, uh, Servius Tullius then assembles

323
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.640
power. Um, HE gets the armies on his, you

324
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.679
know, backing him, and then he comes forward and

325
00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:11.909
says, you know what, uh, the king is dead,

326
00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:15.159
I'm the new king. And instead of going to

327
00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:18.789
the aristocrats who were, he believed at least somewhat

328
00:16:18.789 --> 00:16:23.599
complicit in the assassination of Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius

329
00:16:23.599 --> 00:16:26.890
instead builds a new set of power bases. Um,

330
00:16:26.929 --> 00:16:31.010
AROUND the soldiers who are the infantrymen in the

331
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:35.159
Roman army. And so he changes the political system

332
00:16:35.409 --> 00:16:38.549
so that instead of the aristocrats nominating the king

333
00:16:38.549 --> 00:16:41.469
and everybody else just voting on it, he has

334
00:16:41.969 --> 00:16:44.049
everybody vote to make him king and then he

335
00:16:44.049 --> 00:16:48.049
creates a system of um assemblies in which or

336
00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:52.070
an assembly in which the members of the um

337
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:57.049
The infantry are given votes according to their property

338
00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.150
and their ability to equip themselves with weapons. And

339
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.630
so the majority of the, the most, the best

340
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.780
people in the infantry form the majority of this

341
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.030
assembly and in this assembly now, they, they make

342
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.233
decisions. Des um that bind the king based on,

343
00:17:11.275 --> 00:17:13.515
you know, what the law should be and what

344
00:17:13.515 --> 00:17:17.194
kind of warfare and, you know, peace negotiations they

345
00:17:17.194 --> 00:17:19.155
can have. And so what he's done is he's

346
00:17:19.155 --> 00:17:21.795
shifted the way the Roman state works from something

347
00:17:21.795 --> 00:17:25.354
that is an aristocratic dominated entity to something that

348
00:17:25.354 --> 00:17:28.795
is now uh dominated basically by the class of

349
00:17:28.795 --> 00:17:30.755
people who can serve in the army. And so

350
00:17:30.755 --> 00:17:35.459
he has then um Made it possible for somebody

351
00:17:35.459 --> 00:17:37.739
who is the descendant of a slave to now

352
00:17:37.739 --> 00:17:39.979
run the Roman state in a fashion that has

353
00:17:39.979 --> 00:17:42.339
a sort of constitutional legitimacy. And so this is

354
00:17:42.339 --> 00:17:45.400
the revolution, right? It, it shifts the Roman state

355
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.660
from an aristocratic dominated state to one that is

356
00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:53.060
um dominated instead by the best equipped members of

357
00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.420
the army, but it is a state in which

358
00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.459
representation occurs and voting occurs. Uh, AND so this

359
00:17:59.459 --> 00:18:01.880
idea of citizenship that goes all the way back

360
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.459
to, you know, the sense of belonging, these early

361
00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:07.339
people on the hill in the Palatine felt. He

362
00:18:07.339 --> 00:18:09.780
does not break with that, right? His revolution is

363
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.300
in a sense a reinterpretation of what role citizens

364
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.859
play in deciding how this state works.

365
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:22.030
So then how and when was the Roman Republic

366
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.270
established?

367
00:18:24.119 --> 00:18:28.180
Yeah, so the Roman Republic is the aristocratic counter-revolution.

368
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.359
Um, AND so what Servius Tullius is able to

369
00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:33.880
create is something that is like a representative, like

370
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.359
maybe a I wouldn't say it's a constitutional monarchy

371
00:18:37.359 --> 00:18:40.040
because there's no constitution, but it is a monarchy

372
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.760
that is still accountable to to various people and

373
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.900
various stakeholders in the state. He though is murdered

374
00:18:48.859 --> 00:18:52.239
before, you know, he's murdered basically in a plot

375
00:18:52.239 --> 00:18:55.319
by his son-in-law and his daughter. And his son-in-law

376
00:18:55.319 --> 00:18:58.930
is the notorious Tarquinius Superbus, um, who is, you

377
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.589
know, the final king of Rome. And what he

378
00:19:01.589 --> 00:19:05.000
realizes, um, you know, he had used aristocratic backing

379
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.469
to launch this plot, and he promised them a

380
00:19:07.469 --> 00:19:10.359
restoration of a kind of a monarchy in which

381
00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:13.560
the aristocrats instead of this assembly were the dominant

382
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.119
force. What he actually delivered was, well, you know,

383
00:19:16.199 --> 00:19:21.689
neither an aristocratic, um, accountable. Monarchy or a monarchy

384
00:19:21.689 --> 00:19:24.079
that was accountable to, you know, to the assembly.

385
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:26.989
Instead, he basically made the state his own thing.

386
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.410
And so he governed the state using mainly family

387
00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:32.250
members. Um, HE didn't believe he should be accountable

388
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.530
to anybody and um the republic is the aristocratic

389
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:43.010
counter-revolution that overthrows Tarquinius Subus, uh, and reinstates something

390
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.050
that is basically an aristocratic dominated state but without

391
00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.719
a king. Uh, AND so the goal of the

392
00:19:49.719 --> 00:19:52.479
initial sort of um foundation of the Roman Republic

393
00:19:52.619 --> 00:19:56.280
is to not have a king anymore and sideline

394
00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:01.260
that assembly that um That Servius Tullis had created.

395
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.250
And so the initial offices in the Roman state

396
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.969
now are only going to be held by the

397
00:20:06.969 --> 00:20:10.420
hereditary aristocracy, a group that's called the patricians. Uh,

398
00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:14.859
AND for a while, there is, um, there is

399
00:20:14.859 --> 00:20:18.540
a kind of acknowledgement because Tarquinius Superbus is putting,

400
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.459
he's in exile, he's trying to win his throne

401
00:20:20.459 --> 00:20:23.260
back. There's an acknowledgement by both patricians and the

402
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.140
plebeians who are the non-patricians in the state that

403
00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.300
they need to work together. But after the death

404
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.180
of Tarquin, the patricians basically locked down the offices

405
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.699
in the state and they make it clear this

406
00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:37.550
is going to be an aristocracy. Uh, AND what's

407
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.410
interesting then is there is a reaction to this

408
00:20:40.709 --> 00:20:44.869
by the wealthy members of the military who had

409
00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:47.550
been the dominant force in the assembly set up

410
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.229
by Servius Tullius. And you have in 494 BC

411
00:20:51.229 --> 00:20:54.910
a conflict between patricians and plebeians that we call

412
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.800
the conflict of the orders um in which wealthy

413
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.349
aristocrats and wealthy non-aristocrats sort of face off and

414
00:21:03.349 --> 00:21:07.109
ultimately decide. They're gonna have both things go on

415
00:21:07.109 --> 00:21:09.589
at once, right? You're going to have the aristocratic

416
00:21:09.589 --> 00:21:14.069
dominated state that the patricians want and alongside this,

417
00:21:14.109 --> 00:21:19.030
you're going to have the military-dominated state and they'll

418
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.939
just figure out how to make this work even

419
00:21:20.939 --> 00:21:24.630
though effectively they're two Roman governments now, they'll figure

420
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.030
out how to make this work. And this builds

421
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:30.270
a really important thing into the Roman, Roman sort

422
00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.900
of political mentality. Um. There are no rules, right?

423
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.810
That it's not clear. You have two things that

424
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.609
are totally contradictory to each other. There are no

425
00:21:38.609 --> 00:21:41.250
sort of governing documents that say this is how

426
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:45.680
you resolve a conflict between the plebeian assembly and,

427
00:21:45.729 --> 00:21:50.089
you know, the patrician magistracies. They just figure it

428
00:21:50.089 --> 00:21:52.329
out. And the way they figure it out is

429
00:21:52.329 --> 00:21:55.449
not by fighting in the streets, but by compromising

430
00:21:55.449 --> 00:21:58.270
and negotiating with each other. And this is such

431
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.709
an important principle, um, and this is what ultimately

432
00:22:01.709 --> 00:22:04.270
the Roman Republic is gonna be. Um, IT'S going

433
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.969
to be a system in which even though you

434
00:22:06.969 --> 00:22:10.089
have really deep contradictions in how the state should

435
00:22:10.089 --> 00:22:13.170
work. Those contradictions will be resolved not by fighting

436
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.750
in the streets, but by negotiating with each other

437
00:22:15.849 --> 00:22:19.170
and finding some sort of consensus and compromise that

438
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.250
both sides can agree to. And ultimately, I mean

439
00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:27.329
it takes 200 years, but ultimately, peacefully, these groups

440
00:22:27.329 --> 00:22:30.150
figure out how to blend their two versions of

441
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.849
the, the republic into one and this creates a

442
00:22:33.849 --> 00:22:38.489
really, really powerful political entity, but it's also a

443
00:22:38.489 --> 00:22:40.775
political entity that has this deeply ingrained. The idea

444
00:22:40.775 --> 00:22:43.094
that people who are Roman and are citizens of

445
00:22:43.094 --> 00:22:46.255
this entity have an obligation to this entity because

446
00:22:46.255 --> 00:22:48.895
they own it collectively. They are all kind of

447
00:22:48.895 --> 00:22:51.814
stakeholders in it. Um, AND so therefore they are

448
00:22:51.814 --> 00:22:55.395
all responsible for making sure it works without violence

449
00:22:55.614 --> 00:22:58.015
and without trampling on the rights of other people

450
00:22:58.015 --> 00:23:00.094
who are citizens. And so I think this is

451
00:23:00.094 --> 00:23:01.974
the great achievement of the republic and this is

452
00:23:01.974 --> 00:23:05.204
what makes it so remarkable. I mean, it's impossible

453
00:23:05.204 --> 00:23:06.775
for us to conceive of a state in a

454
00:23:06.775 --> 00:23:10.729
modern context where you have two governments. Uh, THAT,

455
00:23:10.859 --> 00:23:13.369
that don't have anything in common and how they

456
00:23:13.369 --> 00:23:15.449
are supposed to be running the state who agree

457
00:23:15.449 --> 00:23:19.010
to basically work together to just sort of resolve

458
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.729
any disputes they have even though there aren't laws

459
00:23:21.729 --> 00:23:24.689
that really govern what those disputes should be until

460
00:23:24.689 --> 00:23:27.530
ultimately, you know, over 200 years, they figure out

461
00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:29.270
how to make this all kind of fit together.

462
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.510
Yeah, the way the Roman Republic was sort of

463
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:38.750
organized politically was really very interesting. So, but over

464
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:42.510
time, how did it expand and how did Rome

465
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:47.109
go about absorbing most of the Italian peninsula?

466
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.530
I think again, I mean this, this, this basic

467
00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.430
idea of like we as Romans, we, we take

468
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:57.689
what's good, um, we incorporate, we don't exclude. Uh

469
00:23:57.689 --> 00:23:59.689
THIS is how Rome, how Rome does this. Of

470
00:23:59.689 --> 00:24:02.209
course, Rome is very good at fighting. Its military

471
00:24:02.209 --> 00:24:04.449
is very good. It always is a very good

472
00:24:04.449 --> 00:24:09.369
military. Um, BUT the secret to Rome's success is

473
00:24:09.369 --> 00:24:11.709
what comes after they win the battles. You know,

474
00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.890
so you can defeat a city, you can defeat

475
00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.219
a, you can defeat a sort of confederation of

476
00:24:16.219 --> 00:24:19.420
cities. What do you do next? And what Romans

477
00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.510
realized is, you know, the thing that we can

478
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.979
do next is we can incorporate them. So we

479
00:24:24.979 --> 00:24:27.030
can make them citizens and if we make them

480
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.670
citizens, um, you know, they vote in our elections.

481
00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.229
They're part of this political process. They're part of

482
00:24:32.229 --> 00:24:35.709
this sort of larger, um, this larger structure that

483
00:24:35.709 --> 00:24:38.790
we as Romans value and of course, we have

484
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.930
a bigger army. Um, OR we can make them

485
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:45.869
allies. And, in, in practice, um, we might think,

486
00:24:45.969 --> 00:24:47.650
oh well, being a Roman citizen, that would be,

487
00:24:47.739 --> 00:24:49.410
that would be like the gift, right? That's what

488
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.250
you want. You don't want to be an ally.

489
00:24:51.339 --> 00:24:54.349
You, you want, you know, full participation. The reality

490
00:24:54.349 --> 00:24:57.089
is these cities actually would prefer to be allies

491
00:24:57.089 --> 00:25:00.150
over being citizens because at least as an allied

492
00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.069
state, you run your own internal affairs. But that's

493
00:25:03.069 --> 00:25:04.790
in a sense a gift the Romans are giving.

494
00:25:04.869 --> 00:25:06.869
So it means they trust the people in that

495
00:25:06.869 --> 00:25:09.819
city to run its own internal affairs, but the

496
00:25:09.819 --> 00:25:12.270
allies are also required to give troops to the

497
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.969
Romans. And so, um, one of the great limitations

498
00:25:15.969 --> 00:25:18.550
that a lot of ancient city-states face is again

499
00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.790
going back to Athens and Sparta. They have real

500
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:25.910
trouble expanding their citizen base and that really limits

501
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:28.430
the amount of um casualties they can take in

502
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.040
a war. So, you know, part of the issue

503
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.359
that the, the Spartans run into in the Peloponnesian

504
00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:35.640
War is there just are not that many Spartan

505
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.680
citizens. And so when you have a bunch of

506
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.599
Spartan citizens captured in, in Sphacteria, for example, Sparta

507
00:25:41.599 --> 00:25:44.079
is panicked because they have a few 100 citizens

508
00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:46.989
who are like captured, right? And it's a huge

509
00:25:46.989 --> 00:25:48.800
crisis. What do you do with these, you know,

510
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.760
what do we do? We have to get these

511
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.400
citizens back. Rome did not have that problem. Uh,

512
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.719
Rome could feel by the, uh, by the 3rd

513
00:25:55.719 --> 00:25:58.569
century BC they could field armies of 100,000 people

514
00:25:58.569 --> 00:26:00.930
because they kept bringing in new people and new

515
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:04.369
allies and, and new citizens. Um, AND, and so

516
00:26:04.369 --> 00:26:07.729
what that meant was Rome had this really unique

517
00:26:07.729 --> 00:26:12.530
ability to replenish its military power because it had

518
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.010
this unique ability to incorporate new people into its

519
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.130
society and make them stakeholders who were invested in

520
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:21.010
the success of that society. Uh, AND so you

521
00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:24.959
do have moments, um, In Rome's conquest of Italy

522
00:26:24.959 --> 00:26:27.619
where it, it's kind of touch and go whether

523
00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:30.739
this model will fall apart. Um, BECAUSE until those

524
00:26:30.739 --> 00:26:34.579
people really are bound into the Roman state, they

525
00:26:34.579 --> 00:26:36.619
can say, you know what, like that was great

526
00:26:36.619 --> 00:26:38.260
and we got a lot of, you know, money

527
00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.619
and plunder and, um, you know, fighting with the

528
00:26:40.619 --> 00:26:43.540
Romans. That really helped us, but now the Romans

529
00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.290
look like they're weak, so we're gonna bail and,

530
00:26:45.339 --> 00:26:47.540
and do our own thing again. There were moments

531
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.969
where that, that became a real problem. Um, BUT

532
00:26:51.969 --> 00:26:55.170
not that many. AND mostly what Rome was able

533
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.910
to do was win those battles because militarily you

534
00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.109
could fight quite well, lock those people into this

535
00:27:01.109 --> 00:27:03.469
promise of, you know, you could fight with the

536
00:27:03.469 --> 00:27:06.709
Romans and share in the proceeds of our victory

537
00:27:06.709 --> 00:27:08.310
or you could fight against the Romans and we

538
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:10.670
will take those things from you. Uh, AND most

539
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.750
people in Italy said, yeah, I think we're on

540
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.900
the Roman side. We'll, we'll go with you, um,

541
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.329
and do that. Um, AND there were moments that

542
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.089
This, uh, this coalition was threatened, you know, the

543
00:27:21.089 --> 00:27:25.650
invasion in 280 BC by Pyrrhus, um, the wars

544
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.969
with Carthage. There were moments where this, this coalition

545
00:27:28.969 --> 00:27:32.550
was threatened. Um, BUT mostly what Rome was able

546
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:35.125
to do was make The political adjustments and the

547
00:27:35.125 --> 00:27:39.564
military adjustments necessary to keep this coalition together, uh,

548
00:27:39.655 --> 00:27:43.645
and, and that gave Rome a very, very strong

549
00:27:43.645 --> 00:27:47.765
base of citizen soldiers that made it um superior

550
00:27:47.765 --> 00:27:49.444
to really anybody that it was fighting.

551
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:54.449
So if we're covering the history of Rome here,

552
00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.089
I guess that one thing that we can't really

553
00:27:57.089 --> 00:28:01.250
avoid talking about is the rivalry between Rome and

554
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:04.849
Carthage. So how was it and how did the

555
00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:06.930
Punic Wars play out?

556
00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.150
Yeah, so this is um the Punic Wars in

557
00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.280
a sense, um. I don't want to say they

558
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.119
were inevitable, but they were almost inevitable because as

559
00:28:17.119 --> 00:28:19.599
you have this emergence of Rome as the dominant

560
00:28:19.599 --> 00:28:22.750
power in Italy, a lot of what, what locked

561
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:26.359
those cities, those allied cities into their alliances with

562
00:28:26.359 --> 00:28:28.800
Rome was this promise of yes, we're going to

563
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.599
go and beat up on people and you and

564
00:28:30.599 --> 00:28:34.839
your soldiers can steal things. Um, AND eventually, you

565
00:28:34.839 --> 00:28:37.920
know, the Italian peninsula is a peninsula and it's

566
00:28:38.239 --> 00:28:41.079
finite, right? And eventually they get the whole thing.

567
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.849
Uh, AND so in 264 BC there is an

568
00:28:44.849 --> 00:28:48.270
appeal by a group of people who are really

569
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.550
disreputable and they're, they're kind of like a group

570
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.670
of like bandits or even terrorists who seize a

571
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.869
city in northern Sicily and start using it as

572
00:28:56.869 --> 00:28:59.469
a base of operations. Uh, AND so one of

573
00:28:59.469 --> 00:29:02.329
the leading powers in Sicily marches out against them.

574
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.439
And they appeal to both Rome because they have

575
00:29:05.439 --> 00:29:09.599
this Roman citizenship connection and Carthage, that is the

576
00:29:09.599 --> 00:29:13.000
other major power in Sicily that is really concerned

577
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.640
about um Syracuse which has advanced on this mercenary

578
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.969
city. The Carthaginians show up first, uh, but then

579
00:29:20.969 --> 00:29:23.329
the Romans show up and they tell the Carthaginians

580
00:29:23.329 --> 00:29:26.130
like back off, right? This is our city. The

581
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:30.410
Carthaginians then get terrified that the Romans are now

582
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.130
going to do to Sicily what the Romans had

583
00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:37.239
done to Italy. Uh, AND so this ultimately because

584
00:29:37.239 --> 00:29:41.910
of a series of um Miscommunications and you know,

585
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.270
basically actions that were not intended to lead to

586
00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:48.310
full-scale war. It ultimately becomes a full-scale war that

587
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.719
lasts for about 25 years. Uh, THE challenge is

588
00:29:51.719 --> 00:29:54.719
that Carthage is a naval power based outside of

589
00:29:54.719 --> 00:29:57.239
what's now modern Tunis. You know, Carthage is a

590
00:29:57.239 --> 00:30:00.680
suburb of modern Tunis right now. Um, Rome is

591
00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.890
not a naval power. And so Rome has to

592
00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:06.400
basically build a fleet on the fly. Uh, THEY

593
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.359
do this by reverse engineering one Carthaginian ship that

594
00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:14.060
has run aground. They train their sailors by making

595
00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.520
them row together on the beach because they don't

596
00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.079
have ships for them to practice. They send them

597
00:30:19.079 --> 00:30:21.880
out into battle. The sailors, of course, panic because

598
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.750
this would be the equivalent of you and I

599
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.699
building a navy and sending it out against the

600
00:30:26.699 --> 00:30:29.250
US Navy to compete, you know, it, it, they're

601
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.520
terrified. Uh, AND so Rome ultimately decides um in

602
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.280
this conflict that they are going to just kind

603
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.849
of Out muscle the Carthaginians. So the initial thing

604
00:30:40.849 --> 00:30:42.530
they do to win naval battles is they build

605
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.689
a gangplank so that they could just drop it

606
00:30:44.689 --> 00:30:47.050
on the Carthaginian ships and send marines to fight

607
00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:49.550
a land battle in the ships. Uh, AND then

608
00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:52.900
ultimately, you know, because the Romans are, um, and,

609
00:30:52.949 --> 00:30:55.550
and they have such a large population base of

610
00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:58.969
citizens, they just outlast the Carthaginians. Um, THE first

611
00:30:58.969 --> 00:31:01.989
Punic War is, is a is massive in the

612
00:31:01.989 --> 00:31:05.109
amount of destruction it, it wreaks. Um, BUT Rome

613
00:31:05.109 --> 00:31:07.270
is able to absorb that destruction and, and those

614
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:11.130
losses better than the Carthaginians are. Um, THE second

615
00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:14.109
Punic War is the one that everybody is familiar

616
00:31:14.109 --> 00:31:18.020
with. This is the War of Hannibal. And Hannibal

617
00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:21.219
launches that war in part because he's, he wants

618
00:31:21.219 --> 00:31:25.660
to wreak vengeance on the Romans. Uh, AND he

619
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.500
has a strategy of trying to inflict as many

620
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.260
casualties on the Romans as possible to ultimately maybe

621
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.260
break the alliance structure in Italy and deplete Rome's

622
00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.339
manpower. And the initial phase of that war, Hannibal

623
00:31:39.339 --> 00:31:44.109
is, is totally successful at this. Um, HE Wins

624
00:31:44.109 --> 00:31:48.380
three very significant battles against the Romans in 218,

625
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.670
217, and 216 BC. And after the final battle,

626
00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:53.829
the Battle of Canai, which is um one of

627
00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:57.969
the most devastating battles the Romans ever fight. Um,

628
00:31:57.989 --> 00:32:00.709
HE does break the alliance structure and so the

629
00:32:00.709 --> 00:32:07.420
Romans then have to basically endure huge disruptions. Um,

630
00:32:07.469 --> 00:32:10.439
BUT they do rebuild their alliances and then ultimately

631
00:32:10.439 --> 00:32:13.750
defeat Carthage. Uh, AND you know, and then ultimately

632
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:16.670
they fight a third Punic War which, um, leads

633
00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.989
to the destruction of the city of Carthage. But

634
00:32:18.989 --> 00:32:21.099
what the Punic War shows everybody, what the Punic

635
00:32:21.099 --> 00:32:24.510
Wars show everybody in the Mediterranean is Rome is

636
00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:28.479
not a normal Mediterranean state. Um, IT is willing

637
00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:31.099
to do whatever is necessary to win these wars.

638
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.160
And it has the population base and the resource

639
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.479
base that it can outlast really anybody who's going

640
00:32:38.479 --> 00:32:40.640
to fight it. Um, AND this is an important

641
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.719
lesson for both the rest of the Mediterranean and

642
00:32:42.719 --> 00:32:47.439
for Romans because Romans also understand. We are unique.

643
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.770
Um, WE, we are unique in the Mediterranean and

644
00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:53.829
you know, this, if we do this right, um,

645
00:32:53.969 --> 00:32:56.489
we can be protected and we can be a

646
00:32:56.489 --> 00:32:59.530
dominant force in the Mediterranean. The question then becomes

647
00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:03.119
what is doing this right? Um, DOES that mean

648
00:33:03.319 --> 00:33:06.800
we're an imperial power beyond Sicily and Italy? Um,

649
00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.160
INITIALLY after the Second Punic War, they don't want

650
00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.239
to do this, but by the middle part of

651
00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:13.439
the 2nd century, they realized, yes, I mean this

652
00:33:13.439 --> 00:33:15.280
is going to be essential. Otherwise, we're going to

653
00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.239
just keep going back and fighting wars in these

654
00:33:17.239 --> 00:33:19.680
same regions. Uh, AND so by the middle part

655
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.050
of the 2nd century, Rome has decided to use

656
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:26.760
this massive manpower advantage to expand across the Mediterranean,

657
00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:31.050
start absorbing territories. And as it absorbs territories, it

658
00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:34.569
also starts building in this model of incorporating these

659
00:33:34.569 --> 00:33:39.130
territories, um, slowly. But it does start building in

660
00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:42.130
a, a sort of structure of giving citizenship to

661
00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:45.760
people in these territories, settling Romans in these territories,

662
00:33:45.849 --> 00:33:48.530
right? It is not just going to govern these

663
00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:53.510
territories remotely, it's going to make them Roman. And

664
00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:56.750
this is a slow process, but it is a

665
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.780
crucial process in, you know, understanding why the Roman

666
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.709
Empire is different than, say, the Persian Empire of

667
00:34:02.709 --> 00:34:06.060
Cyrus or the Macedonian Empire of Alexander the Great.

668
00:34:06.229 --> 00:34:08.429
Those are empires that never had any real interest

669
00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:13.300
in making, say, Greeks Persian. Romans, because their model

670
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.659
for controlling territory is building people into this Roman

671
00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:21.110
citizenship structure, this is what they commit to do.

672
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:24.370
And um from the 2nd century forward, you have

673
00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:29.350
a process of, of trying to build Roman presences

674
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.050
in these territories, but also take people from these

675
00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:34.969
areas and, and like link them to this Roman

676
00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:37.770
state that is now governing them and that's different

677
00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:40.889
and that's new and that's really important um because

678
00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:44.168
it's going to be the thing that really sets

679
00:34:44.168 --> 00:34:47.239
the Roman Empire up um to last for as

680
00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:48.050
long as it does.

681
00:34:49.248 --> 00:34:54.447
Right, but when did the Roman Empire start exactly?

682
00:34:54.529 --> 00:34:57.749
I mean, is there any precise date or not?

683
00:34:58.449 --> 00:35:01.489
Yeah, so, um, so what happens with this process

684
00:35:01.489 --> 00:35:04.679
is, um, you know, as you are spreading Romans

685
00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:08.830
out to these other parts of the Mediterranean. They

686
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:11.830
get very, very wealthy. Um, AND it creates an

687
00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.810
imbalance in the way that Roman society is working.

688
00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:18.959
Uh, AND so this wealth imbalance creates political tensions

689
00:35:19.229 --> 00:35:21.669
that the republic, which is based on consensus and

690
00:35:21.669 --> 00:35:25.389
compromise, is ill-equipped to resolve. You know, because the

691
00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:29.250
wealth is accumulating very, very quickly, and Rome doesn't

692
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.229
have a tax structure like a modern, you know,

693
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.689
modern Western democracy that can say, OK, well, So

694
00:35:34.689 --> 00:35:36.590
there's a lot of wealth accumulating at the top

695
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:40.169
of, of our society like let's tax them 90%

696
00:35:40.169 --> 00:35:42.250
and distribute the wealth to everybody else. Trump doesn't

697
00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:45.010
do that, right? So people get wealthier and wealthier

698
00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.409
and wealthier and it creates all sorts of tensions

699
00:35:48.409 --> 00:35:51.290
in this political entity that's supposed to be, you

700
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:54.209
know, about everybody being a stakeholder in this, this

701
00:35:54.209 --> 00:35:58.639
shared enterprise. Um, INITIALLY, people try to solve this

702
00:35:58.649 --> 00:36:02.010
through political means, um, but by the 130s BC

703
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.239
it's become clear that um, The tradition of, of

704
00:36:05.239 --> 00:36:09.280
compromise and consensus building is not going to be

705
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.159
effective enough to solve this problem in time. Uh,

706
00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:14.239
AND so you do have an outbreak of political

707
00:36:14.239 --> 00:36:17.840
violence in 133 BC that everybody hopes is, is

708
00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.719
kind of isolated but ultimately it spirals and people

709
00:36:21.719 --> 00:36:24.530
begin using political violence more and more to solve

710
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:28.860
problems within the Roman um polity. Compromise and consensus

711
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.070
sort of starts. To drop away. Political violence becomes

712
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.100
a more and more effective tool. And in the

713
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:37.229
80s BC there is actually a civil war between

714
00:36:37.229 --> 00:36:41.270
um rival generals who have built armies loyal to

715
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:45.070
them through um providing those soldiers with rewards for

716
00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:49.469
serving under their command. Uh AND those commanders lead

717
00:36:49.469 --> 00:36:51.399
those armies against the city of Rome. They fight

718
00:36:51.399 --> 00:36:53.750
each other on behalf of their commanders instead of

719
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:56.909
the state and this ultimately creates a dynamic in

720
00:36:56.909 --> 00:37:00.520
Rome that, that the republic can't escape. Um, BECAUSE

721
00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.919
once you don't have this tradition of compromise and

722
00:37:03.919 --> 00:37:09.790
consensus, You don't really have rules to um reconcile

723
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:12.840
disputes. And so the uh the civil wars in

724
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.919
the 80s, they traumatize an entire generation of Romans

725
00:37:17.919 --> 00:37:20.229
who, these are some of the most famous Romans

726
00:37:20.229 --> 00:37:23.179
that we have, right? Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great,

727
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.080
Cicero, um Cato, right? These are all people who

728
00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.399
are of that generation who believe really deeply in

729
00:37:30.399 --> 00:37:32.679
their soul that they want the republic to survive,

730
00:37:32.719 --> 00:37:34.760
but they don't trust that it will. And so

731
00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.800
each of them behaves in such a way that

732
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.570
um you know, they, they, they try their best

733
00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.800
to work according to the rules of the republic,

734
00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.320
but they don't actually believe those rules are going

735
00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.919
to protect them. This ultimately leads to a civil

736
00:37:47.919 --> 00:37:52.000
war that Julius Caesar wins. Um, Julius Caesar uh

737
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.320
tries to create a system where he is going

738
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.199
to run the Roman Republic, uh, in a way

739
00:37:57.199 --> 00:38:00.080
that's sort of constitutional, but he's gonna just make

740
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.419
sure everything happens effectively and of course he's assassinated.

741
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.040
And that sparks another civil war that ultimately leads

742
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:11.040
to the victory by Julius Caesar's nephew, Octavian, um,

743
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.300
the, the Emperor Augustus. And what's different about Augustus

744
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.030
from everybody that came before him is Augustus has

745
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:21.149
absolutely no faith in the republic. He understands that

746
00:38:21.149 --> 00:38:25.189
the, the ideas are good, right? That the ideas

747
00:38:25.189 --> 00:38:28.550
that this society should belong to its citizens. Those

748
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:31.590
are good ideas. He also understands that no Roman

749
00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:35.030
is willing to accept something like what um Tarquinius

750
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:37.179
Superbus did, you know, like the state belongs to

751
00:38:37.179 --> 00:38:40.429
me and my family and like screw the rest

752
00:38:40.429 --> 00:38:42.780
of you, right? This is all my thing. Um,

753
00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.989
AND so what Augustus does is he builds a

754
00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:49.330
structure, um, very specific to his own needs where

755
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:53.709
he is ultimately the decider, but the republic works

756
00:38:53.709 --> 00:38:56.959
underneath him in the places he doesn't care about,

757
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.030
right? So if he, he doesn't care about About

758
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.120
how you run, you know, the province of IKEA.

759
00:39:02.429 --> 00:39:04.239
As long as there's no problem that rises to

760
00:39:04.239 --> 00:39:06.310
his level, run the province of IKEA, right? The

761
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.639
Senate can run that. He doesn't care. He doesn't

762
00:39:08.639 --> 00:39:11.360
care about how you're gonna manage the street sweeping

763
00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.520
unless there's a problem. And if there's a problem,

764
00:39:13.719 --> 00:39:16.010
he will come in and fix the problem. But

765
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.169
his whole way of running this is he wants

766
00:39:18.169 --> 00:39:20.449
to be sure that he has enough power that

767
00:39:20.449 --> 00:39:23.520
nobody can dislodge him from authority. He wants to

768
00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.570
be sure that he has the authority to fix

769
00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:28.510
anything that becomes a real problem in the state

770
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:31.889
because the republic lacked that ability. But he ultimately

771
00:39:31.889 --> 00:39:33.850
doesn't want to run the entire state. He doesn't

772
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:36.489
want to micromanage things. He just wants to be

773
00:39:36.489 --> 00:39:40.010
able to solve any problem that, that arises and

774
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.729
he wants credit for solving the problem, not creating

775
00:39:42.729 --> 00:39:46.199
the problem. And so what Augustus creates is something

776
00:39:46.199 --> 00:39:50.070
that um he calls the restored republic. And in

777
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:53.260
some ways it is, right? He, he acknowledges that

778
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.830
there are rights to citizens that are guaranteed them

779
00:39:56.830 --> 00:40:02.590
as citizens of this Roman state. He says explicitly,

780
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.250
I don't have any special powers, right? All of

781
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:09.250
my powers are constitutionally consistent with offices that existed

782
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.250
in the Roman Republic, but what I have is

783
00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.810
the authority to kind of regulate things when they

784
00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:16.649
fall out of line. And so this ultimately is,

785
00:40:16.709 --> 00:40:19.489
is the empire, right? Augustus is very smart in

786
00:40:19.489 --> 00:40:22.330
how he does this. He recognizes that there is

787
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:26.489
no appetite at all in Rome for taking away

788
00:40:26.489 --> 00:40:28.889
this sense that we as citizens own this thing.

789
00:40:29.689 --> 00:40:32.280
But he also recognizes there's no appetite in Rome

790
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.149
for anarchy. And he is very careful to remind

791
00:40:36.149 --> 00:40:38.840
Romans that what, what happens when you have the

792
00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.209
republic. IS what happened, you know, in the 40s

793
00:40:42.209 --> 00:40:45.419
and 50s and 60s BC. It's anarchy. There's violence

794
00:40:45.419 --> 00:40:47.340
in the streets. People are getting, you know, murdered

795
00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.459
for no reason. There's um no ability to hold

796
00:40:50.459 --> 00:40:53.260
elections. You can't actually decide anything because everybody is

797
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.689
sort of jockeying with position. He, you know, he

798
00:40:55.689 --> 00:40:58.570
promises security. He promises that your rights as a

799
00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:01.419
citizen will be guaranteed. He promises that the state

800
00:41:01.419 --> 00:41:05.139
can act decisively and otherwise, let everything be as

801
00:41:05.139 --> 00:41:07.770
it was, right? This is in a sense the

802
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:11.770
genius of the empire that Augustus creates. For regular

803
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.239
people most of the time, it does the same

804
00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:20.040
things the republic promised but couldn't deliver. For people

805
00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.959
who are in the Senate, yes, they recognize, OK,

806
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.919
in the 60s BC we actually decided what happened

807
00:41:25.919 --> 00:41:29.399
in the Roman state. Now, We decide some things,

808
00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.360
but we can be overridden and if something goes

809
00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.479
wrong, we are gonna be blamed and Augustus is

810
00:41:34.479 --> 00:41:36.360
always going to be the hero who steps in

811
00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.120
and fixes it. Um, BUT, you know, but this

812
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:43.320
is a really interesting set of choices that Augustus

813
00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:47.919
makes, I think purely because of, um, self-interest, right?

814
00:41:47.959 --> 00:41:50.330
This is good for Augustus to have this system.

815
00:41:50.729 --> 00:41:53.129
But what it does is it creates a way

816
00:41:53.129 --> 00:41:56.770
for this, all of these tendencies that made Rome

817
00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:00.530
exceptional to continue even though the republic as a

818
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:03.760
sort of representative democracy doesn't really exist anymore. Right?

819
00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:10.010
Citizenship still means something. And so citizenship's expansive expansion

820
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.729
into other parts of the empire, it's something people

821
00:42:12.729 --> 00:42:16.310
still want. Um, IT confers a sort of status.

822
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:20.570
Uh, AND, and the empire. Because it steps back

823
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.790
and lets people run most everything. It doesn't feel

824
00:42:24.689 --> 00:42:29.250
um dominating. It doesn't feel tyrannical, except for those

825
00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:31.719
senators who are, you know, the 600 people who

826
00:42:31.719 --> 00:42:34.090
sit in Rome and, you know, think they should

827
00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:37.370
be doing something and really sometimes get antsy that

828
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:40.330
they're not. Everybody else is pretty OK with this.

829
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:44.209
Um, BUT the basic principles of citizenship matters and

830
00:42:44.209 --> 00:42:46.169
we are going to take new people and make

831
00:42:46.169 --> 00:42:49.389
them citizens continue. But what the empire also does

832
00:42:49.389 --> 00:42:51.850
is, um, emperors realize that there is a way

833
00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:56.270
to leverage this idea of being a Roman citizen

834
00:42:56.409 --> 00:42:58.929
to build power bases that go beyond the traditional

835
00:42:58.929 --> 00:43:01.600
power base in Italy. So what Augustus does is

836
00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.149
he takes people from the Italian aristocracy who didn't

837
00:43:04.149 --> 00:43:06.959
belong to the Roman aristocracy. He builds his senate

838
00:43:06.959 --> 00:43:09.280
out of those people because those people are grateful

839
00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.189
to him for giving them this new status that

840
00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:16.040
they didn't otherwise have. The Emperor Claudius builds his

841
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:19.810
Senate out of people from what's now France. Um,

842
00:43:20.389 --> 00:43:23.270
BECAUSE this is another, it's the same thing. He's

843
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:27.469
extending status to people who, uh, you know, believe

844
00:43:27.469 --> 00:43:29.389
that this is actually a very valuable thing. They're

845
00:43:29.389 --> 00:43:32.389
then loyal to Claudius. But what ends up happening

846
00:43:32.389 --> 00:43:35.830
over time as the empire progresses is these people

847
00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.389
who initially got citizenship and thought this was a

848
00:43:38.389 --> 00:43:42.149
great thing, their grandchildren got senatorial status and thought

849
00:43:42.149 --> 00:43:45.149
this was a great thing. Those great grandchildren, some

850
00:43:45.149 --> 00:43:49.219
of them become emperors. And so the empire takes

851
00:43:49.219 --> 00:43:54.439
this process of making Roman citizenship and membership valuable

852
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:57.219
and it makes it a sort of process of

853
00:43:57.219 --> 00:44:00.280
like integrating every aspect of the state. So that

854
00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:03.820
the empire starts out as something where Augustus is

855
00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.500
more or less running, you know, the Mediterranean on

856
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.709
behalf of Italians. 100 years later, the Emperor Trajan

857
00:44:10.709 --> 00:44:14.580
is Spanish. And, you know, and that's fine. It

858
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:17.500
isn't, it doesn't break the system. It's totally consistent

859
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.699
with how Rome has been, you know, going all

860
00:44:19.699 --> 00:44:23.580
the way back to Tarquitius Priscus coming from Etruria

861
00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.820
with his Greek background and becoming Roman king. This

862
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.195
is what Rome has always been, and Augustus. MANAGES

863
00:44:29.195 --> 00:44:32.294
to create a structure in the empire that continues

864
00:44:32.475 --> 00:44:35.955
and retains that basic idea of, you know, what

865
00:44:35.955 --> 00:44:38.625
Rome is and, and why Rome is great and

866
00:44:38.625 --> 00:44:41.554
why Rome succeeds and why Rome is different from

867
00:44:41.554 --> 00:44:43.834
everywhere that has, you know, surrounded it and has

868
00:44:43.834 --> 00:44:44.514
come before it.

869
00:44:45.939 --> 00:44:47.899
So I would like to ask you about a

870
00:44:47.899 --> 00:44:52.090
few of the emperors and their reigns. So what

871
00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:57.739
characterized Caligulas and Claudius, you've already referred to Claudius

872
00:44:57.739 --> 00:45:01.199
here a little bit. What characterized their reigns?

873
00:45:02.159 --> 00:45:04.879
Uh, SO I think what's interesting about this is,

874
00:45:04.969 --> 00:45:07.320
you know, Augustus, he reigned for a very long

875
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.520
time. I, I think the thing that uh we

876
00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.560
sometimes fail to appreciate because Roman history is so

877
00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.760
long, um, is that Augustus is born in the

878
00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.979
year 63 BC. His political career starts when he's

879
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:21.040
a little less than 19 years old and he

880
00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.000
lives to be 76, right? And so, you know,

881
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.840
if, if we like to think that Rome um

882
00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:31.360
lasts for, you know, for 20 centuries. Augustus is

883
00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:36.219
actually, um, you know, he's basically running this thing

884
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.159
for about 2.5% of the entire history of Rome.

885
00:45:39.399 --> 00:45:42.179
He's, he's the main or a main political figure

886
00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.280
for about 2 2.5% of the entire history of

887
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:50.669
the Roman state. And this is um transformative because

888
00:45:50.679 --> 00:45:54.840
you have a sense that um the emperor is

889
00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:59.620
permanent. Right? We, you know, Augustus is there forever,

890
00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.780
right, if you were born in Rome and you

891
00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.020
make it to 5 years old, your, your average

892
00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.500
lifespan is probably about 50 years. And so when

893
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:10.379
Augustus dies at 76, there's pretty much nobody alive

894
00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:15.530
who remembers what it was like before Augustus. Um,

895
00:46:15.699 --> 00:46:19.530
AND, and then his successor Tiberius reigns for another

896
00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:22.689
23 years. And so there's this assumption that the,

897
00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.290
that when you have an emperor, this is more

898
00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.290
or less a permanent thing, right? This, they don't

899
00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:29.250
change all that regularly. It's like, um, it's like

900
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:31.959
how we think about the, the queen, the English

901
00:46:31.959 --> 00:46:34.840
monarchy, right? Queen Elizabeth was there for so long,

902
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:36.810
it's hard to imagine that you might have like

903
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:40.750
a king, not be there for 2030, 40 years.

904
00:46:41.169 --> 00:46:46.020
Um, AND When Caligula takes power, uh, he takes

905
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:49.639
power as a young man, and it's remarkable because

906
00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.800
there had not been anybody younger than 50 running

907
00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:58.419
the Roman Empire since Augustus turned 50 in 13

908
00:46:58.419 --> 00:47:01.659
BC, right? Caligula takes power in 37 AD. So

909
00:47:01.659 --> 00:47:05.459
this is, it's weird for Romans to not only

910
00:47:05.459 --> 00:47:08.739
have somebody come in who is, is young, but

911
00:47:08.739 --> 00:47:12.979
also have somebody come in who's relatively inexperienced. And

912
00:47:12.979 --> 00:47:15.459
um it becomes very clear, so Caligula actually starts

913
00:47:15.459 --> 00:47:18.239
out as an OK emperor and ends up getting

914
00:47:18.239 --> 00:47:21.540
sick about a year into his reign and the

915
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.500
Caligula that we all know, the crazy Caligula who

916
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:28.530
appoints his horse consul and, you know, um, Takes

917
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.169
the entire grain fleet so he can build a

918
00:47:30.169 --> 00:47:31.810
bridge across a bay so he can ride his

919
00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:35.409
chariot across at once, right? The crazy Caligula is

920
00:47:35.409 --> 00:47:40.090
um and he emerges after this illness. Uh, AND

921
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:43.370
Caligula is such a problematic figure that one of

922
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:48.959
his bodyguards actually assassinates him. That shocks Romans because

923
00:47:48.969 --> 00:47:51.489
they don't imagine that an imperial reign can end

924
00:47:51.489 --> 00:47:54.449
quickly like that. And they definitely don't think that

925
00:47:54.449 --> 00:47:57.610
somebody who's young is gonna have their term end

926
00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:00.889
quickly. So Caligula dies after about 4 years in

927
00:48:00.889 --> 00:48:06.209
power. Um, Claudius is Caligula's Caligula's uncle. Claudius is

928
00:48:06.209 --> 00:48:10.340
basically made emperor by accident. So after Caligula dies,

929
00:48:10.469 --> 00:48:13.149
uh, the Roman Senate actually, you know, they convene

930
00:48:13.149 --> 00:48:15.110
and they start having a debate about restoring the

931
00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:18.729
republic. The Praetorian Guards, who are the, the imperial

932
00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:20.550
guards in the city of Rome and the only

933
00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:24.550
military force allowed in the city, they find Claudius

934
00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:27.229
hiding behind a curtain in the palace. They trot

935
00:48:27.229 --> 00:48:29.389
him out, they proclaim him emperor, and then they

936
00:48:29.389 --> 00:48:31.544
march to the. Senate and say Claudius is now

937
00:48:31.544 --> 00:48:37.205
your emperor. Um, Claudius is a relatively successful emperor,

938
00:48:37.504 --> 00:48:40.205
but he too dies in a very strange way.

939
00:48:40.304 --> 00:48:44.824
So in 54 AD um Claudius dies after eating

940
00:48:44.824 --> 00:48:47.465
dinner. And the story that's told that I think

941
00:48:47.465 --> 00:48:50.465
is somewhat plausible is he was poisoned um by

942
00:48:50.465 --> 00:48:53.520
eating poisoned mushrooms. And the question is, was this

943
00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.780
deliberate or not? Uh, THE story that's told is

944
00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:59.830
his wife had this done. Um, IS that possible?

945
00:48:59.909 --> 00:49:04.459
It's possible. Is it definitive? No. Um, BUT between

946
00:49:04.459 --> 00:49:09.219
Caligula and Claudius, Romans learn that imperial reigns can

947
00:49:09.219 --> 00:49:13.830
end suddenly. And they don't necessarily end with the

948
00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:16.870
natural death of the person, right? They, the people

949
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:21.139
can die prematurely because someone kills them. And this

950
00:49:21.139 --> 00:49:24.719
changes Roman history, you know, it, uh, it again

951
00:49:24.719 --> 00:49:28.379
is this idea of the possible. So the republic

952
00:49:28.379 --> 00:49:31.060
lasted so long as this thing governed by consensus

953
00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.500
and compromise simply because nobody decided to challenge it.

954
00:49:34.699 --> 00:49:37.500
And then in 133, somebody challenges it and everybody

955
00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:40.300
starts saying, oh well, that's possible. How can I

956
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.060
do that? What, what can I do that can

957
00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.800
use this sort of ability to um unleash political

958
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.370
violence in a fashion that helps my career. With

959
00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:50.370
Augustus and, and Tiberius, it sort of recedes from

960
00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:52.870
people's mind that you could use violence to change

961
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:56.850
the imperial regime. Caligula and Claudius sort of show,

962
00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:00.219
yeah, no, you can. You, you can actually use

963
00:50:00.219 --> 00:50:05.179
violence. Um, AND those successions were relatively straightforward, right?

964
00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:10.060
Um, Claudius was, became emperor without um violence in

965
00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.020
the city and there's no street fighting or anything.

966
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.260
He is proclaimed emperor. When Claudius dies, Nero takes

967
00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:18.100
power after Claudius. Um, BUT this idea that you

968
00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.510
can get rid of an emperor, um, unnaturally, right?

969
00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.739
They don't just die, you make sure they die.

970
00:50:24.129 --> 00:50:26.889
Uh, AND then you use violence to take, you

971
00:50:26.889 --> 00:50:29.770
use that violence to take power, this becomes ingrained

972
00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:31.959
in the Roman mentality. And so what Caligula and

973
00:50:31.959 --> 00:50:34.729
Claudia sort of make people understand is if you

974
00:50:34.729 --> 00:50:36.830
don't like an emperor, you can end his reign

975
00:50:36.929 --> 00:50:39.330
and his life at the same time and if

976
00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:41.889
you plan right, you can be the person who

977
00:50:41.889 --> 00:50:45.760
takes over. Uh, AND this is a very, very

978
00:50:45.919 --> 00:50:47.500
damaging thing for Roman history.

979
00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.090
OK, so, but then comes Nero, who is one

980
00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:55.209
of the emperors we hear the most about as

981
00:50:55.209 --> 00:50:58.129
well. So what would you like to tell us

982
00:50:58.129 --> 00:50:58.610
about him?

983
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:03.229
Uh, SO I will say that I am, I'm

984
00:51:03.229 --> 00:51:06.429
something of a Nero apologist. Um, I think so,

985
00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:08.610
so the story that you, I mean the idea

986
00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:11.669
that you have, the two craziest emperors in Roman

987
00:51:11.669 --> 00:51:14.310
history, the ones everybody knows are Caligula and Nero.

988
00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:17.300
Um, AND then there's like another tier below that

989
00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:19.419
that some people know. But, you know, the stories

990
00:51:19.419 --> 00:51:22.290
about Nero, um, are things like Nero is the

991
00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:25.739
first to persecute Christians, that's true. Um, THAT there's

992
00:51:25.739 --> 00:51:27.850
a massive fire in the city of Rome in

993
00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:31.939
64 AD, that's true, um, that Nero started the

994
00:51:31.939 --> 00:51:35.840
fire. That's not true, um, that Nero fiddled while

995
00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:38.030
the fire sort of consumed the city of Rome.

996
00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.600
Absolutely not true because he wasn't even in the

997
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:45.159
city. Um, Nero killed his mother, true. Um, Nero

998
00:51:45.159 --> 00:51:50.520
killed his mother out of spite, probably true, um,

999
00:51:50.679 --> 00:51:52.879
that Nero went to the Greece went to Greece

1000
00:51:52.879 --> 00:51:55.159
and like rigged the Olympics so that he could

1001
00:51:55.159 --> 00:51:58.560
win. True. Uh, BUT, but beneath all of this

1002
00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.350
stuff, uh, there is something that I think is,

1003
00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:06.629
um, An understanding by Nero that makes some sense,

1004
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:10.909
right? I, I think that Nero Nero had some

1005
00:52:10.909 --> 00:52:13.510
ideas that made sense. He had other ideas that

1006
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:16.879
were absolutely utterly crazy, but some of the ideas

1007
00:52:16.879 --> 00:52:18.790
made sense. And so, um, so what I'd like,

1008
00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.929
what I'd like to think about with Nero is

1009
00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.709
what is he trying to do and why? Um,

1010
00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:27.469
BECAUSE his execution generally is abysmal, right? Even when

1011
00:52:27.469 --> 00:52:30.149
he had good ideas, he did them badly. But

1012
00:52:30.149 --> 00:52:32.850
the, going to Greece to compete in the Olympics,

1013
00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:36.209
this actually is an idea that makes some sense

1014
00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:39.110
because Nero takes power as a very young man.

1015
00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:41.310
Um, HE'S a teenager when he takes power, about

1016
00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:43.909
16 years old when he takes power. Uh, AND

1017
00:52:43.909 --> 00:52:47.550
initially he's dominated by his mother and the senators

1018
00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:49.709
who are allied with his mother. Um, AT a

1019
00:52:49.709 --> 00:52:52.379
certain point, he realizes he wants to actually exert

1020
00:52:52.379 --> 00:52:55.320
his own, his own authority. He has his mother

1021
00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.850
done away with. This breaks senatorial faith in Nero

1022
00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:01.169
and Nero needs to build a new power base.

1023
00:53:01.429 --> 00:53:02.989
And so what Nero decides to do is build

1024
00:53:02.989 --> 00:53:05.699
a power base in Greece. Um, AND so the

1025
00:53:05.699 --> 00:53:09.689
trip to Greece is about cultivating support in an

1026
00:53:09.689 --> 00:53:13.040
area of the empire that hasn't yet been brought

1027
00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.850
in, um, to this sort of level of senatorial

1028
00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:19.370
aristocracy. And it's a good bet because the Greek

1029
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:22.040
world is very, very wealthy. Um, SOME of the

1030
00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.399
richest cities and most, um, prominent individuals in the

1031
00:53:25.399 --> 00:53:28.709
Mediterranean are Greeks who had not yet been brought

1032
00:53:28.709 --> 00:53:31.639
into this Roman imperial structure. And Nero is still

1033
00:53:31.639 --> 00:53:34.040
a young man, you know, when he's doing this,

1034
00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.709
um, Nero is, is basically like in his late

1035
00:53:36.709 --> 00:53:40.320
20s, early 30s. So this makes sense as a

1036
00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:44.320
long-term political play. Nero, of course, is incapable of

1037
00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.560
doing it right, but it makes sense. And so

1038
00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.040
when Nero ends up, um, you know, Nero's failures

1039
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:54.899
are so Ridiculous, um, that you end up having

1040
00:53:54.899 --> 00:53:58.120
a revolution launched in the northwest of the empire.

1041
00:53:58.399 --> 00:54:02.080
He doesn't have the support in Greece that would

1042
00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:05.159
allow him to counteract this yet, and he manages

1043
00:54:05.159 --> 00:54:07.439
this civil war in like the worst possible way

1044
00:54:07.439 --> 00:54:09.949
you can imagine, you know, he is. He falls

1045
00:54:09.949 --> 00:54:12.590
into a kind of manic depressive set of episodes

1046
00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:14.419
where when he gets good news, he gets super

1047
00:54:14.419 --> 00:54:16.389
excited and throws parties, when he gets bad news,

1048
00:54:16.459 --> 00:54:18.489
he gets so depressed he can't leave his room.

1049
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:21.189
When he finally decides he's going to um go

1050
00:54:21.189 --> 00:54:23.669
and, and, like, lead an army out to confront

1051
00:54:23.669 --> 00:54:26.344
the rebellion, um, he's much more. Concerned about how

1052
00:54:26.344 --> 00:54:28.584
to get his organ because Nero liked to play

1053
00:54:28.584 --> 00:54:31.395
music, how to get his organ alongside the army

1054
00:54:31.395 --> 00:54:33.864
than he is actually about strategy. Uh, AND so,

1055
00:54:33.965 --> 00:54:36.354
you know, and so Nero ends up dying. Um,

1056
00:54:36.385 --> 00:54:38.864
HE ends up committing suicide rather than being killed

1057
00:54:38.864 --> 00:54:41.455
in the aftermath of, of, you know, losing his

1058
00:54:41.455 --> 00:54:46.010
throne. Um, BUT the outreach to Greece is so

1059
00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:49.610
successful that for more than 20 years after Nero's

1060
00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:54.520
death, you have fake Nero's emerge leading political movements

1061
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:58.929
in the east trying to overthrow Roman emperors. Uh,

1062
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.169
AND so it works. It's just, it didn't work

1063
00:55:02.169 --> 00:55:05.530
fast enough and Nero was too incompetent to actually

1064
00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:08.439
make it, you know, work during his lifetime. But,

1065
00:55:08.479 --> 00:55:10.080
you know, but again, like, a lot of what

1066
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:14.909
Nero does is, is terrible and crazy. Um, BUT

1067
00:55:14.919 --> 00:55:19.239
there is an actual sense of, you know, a

1068
00:55:19.239 --> 00:55:22.659
plan that could have worked. Uh, HAD a better

1069
00:55:22.659 --> 00:55:26.000
person done it in a different circumstance and, you

1070
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.520
know, had more time. Um, AND I think what

1071
00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:32.540
you see that's remarkable is The seeds of Nero's

1072
00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:36.419
plan are actually built upon by emperors in the

1073
00:55:36.419 --> 00:55:40.820
70s, 80s, 90s, and 100s AD to build actually

1074
00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:43.260
the structure that's going to make the Roman Empire

1075
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:45.540
its strongest in the 2nd century AD. That was

1076
00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:48.820
Nero's idea. He couldn't do it, but the idea

1077
00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:49.379
wasn't wrong.

1078
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:57.169
So you've already mentioned briefly Trajan. Tell us about

1079
00:55:57.169 --> 00:56:01.429
Trajan and Hadrian and what they represent in the

1080
00:56:01.429 --> 00:56:03.189
history of the Roman Empire.

1081
00:56:04.149 --> 00:56:06.439
Um, I mean, Trajan and Hadrian, I think represent

1082
00:56:06.439 --> 00:56:08.199
the culmination of all of this stuff that we've

1083
00:56:08.199 --> 00:56:10.149
been talking about for the first century of the

1084
00:56:10.149 --> 00:56:13.659
empire. This idea of, of bringing in new people

1085
00:56:13.959 --> 00:56:16.669
as first as citizens, then as senators, then as

1086
00:56:16.669 --> 00:56:18.439
emperors. The first one to do that is Trajan.

1087
00:56:18.489 --> 00:56:21.120
I mean, Trajan is from Spain. Hadrian is also

1088
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.000
from Spain. Um, THEY are the first two emperors

1089
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.139
not born in Italy. Um, AND They are remarkably

1090
00:56:29.139 --> 00:56:32.540
successful. Uh, Trajan is a general who comes in

1091
00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:37.320
and, and decides to, um, launch military campaigns that

1092
00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.620
ultimately lead to the Roman Empire reaching its greatest

1093
00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:42.300
extent in, in Roman history. He conquers what's now

1094
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.449
more or less all of modern, most of modern

1095
00:56:44.449 --> 00:56:47.669
Romania. Um, HE, he conquers the territory between the

1096
00:56:47.669 --> 00:56:49.820
Tigris and Euphrates that is the, the sort of

1097
00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:53.379
center. Sort of population center of modern Iraq. He

1098
00:56:53.379 --> 00:56:55.750
gets all the way to the Caspian Sea, conquering

1099
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:58.840
what's now modern Armenia and Azerbaijan. Um, HE conquers

1100
00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.300
territory in Arabia that goes into Saudi Arabia. Uh,

1101
00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:04.979
HE actually sets foot in the Persian Gulf. He's

1102
00:57:04.979 --> 00:57:08.655
a remarkable successful military general. Um, BUT by the

1103
00:57:08.655 --> 00:57:11.125
end of his life, it's clear he's overextended himself

1104
00:57:11.125 --> 00:57:13.885
and so when Hadrian takes over, Hadrian is also,

1105
00:57:14.145 --> 00:57:16.945
um, a Spaniard from, from the city of Italica,

1106
00:57:17.104 --> 00:57:19.705
uh, which is basically right near to the, the

1107
00:57:19.705 --> 00:57:23.145
modern city of Sevilla. Uh, AND Hadrian decides he

1108
00:57:23.145 --> 00:57:25.145
has to pull back from some of this territory

1109
00:57:25.145 --> 00:57:29.185
and instead concentrate on integrating more deeply the parts

1110
00:57:29.185 --> 00:57:32.000
of the Roman world that, um, You know, that

1111
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.209
he sees as core. So he's not, he realizes

1112
00:57:35.439 --> 00:57:40.429
it's almost impossible to hold the areas of Mesopotamia

1113
00:57:40.429 --> 00:57:43.179
from the West if you don't also hold Iran.

1114
00:57:43.399 --> 00:57:45.540
And so he pulls back from them because it's

1115
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.080
hopeless. But what he does instead is he focuses

1116
00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:53.699
his attention on Those Greek elites that Nero had

1117
00:57:53.699 --> 00:57:56.860
started to cultivate that had become more prominent under

1118
00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:59.419
uh the emperors between Nero and Trajan. Um, AND

1119
00:57:59.419 --> 00:58:02.820
what Hadrian does is he travels the empire really

1120
00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:05.260
aggressively and he goes everywhere that you can imagine.

1121
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:08.139
Um, AND he visits cities, he gets to know

1122
00:58:08.139 --> 00:58:11.239
those cities. He, he spends lots of money upping

1123
00:58:11.239 --> 00:58:14.840
the quality of the infrastructure in those cities. Um,

1124
00:58:14.959 --> 00:58:19.840
AND he is very close to Greek elites that

1125
00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:23.159
he wants to integrate into this sort of senatorial

1126
00:58:23.159 --> 00:58:25.439
aristocracy and build a, a power base that is

1127
00:58:25.439 --> 00:58:29.669
a really um firm and secure power base. Uh,

1128
00:58:29.679 --> 00:58:33.239
THAT also fundamentally sort of changes the nature of

1129
00:58:33.239 --> 00:58:37.219
Greek interaction with Romans. Uh, BECAUSE now, most of

1130
00:58:37.219 --> 00:58:42.260
the leading intellectuals, um, business people, and civic leaders

1131
00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:45.060
in the Greek world are Roman citizens. Many of

1132
00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:48.219
them interact directly with Roman emperors. Many of them

1133
00:58:48.219 --> 00:58:51.820
are Roman senators. Um, THE Greek world used to

1134
00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:55.330
be something the Romans colonized. Now the Greek world

1135
00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:59.020
is Roman. It's becoming increasingly Roman and in the

1136
00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:02.070
aftermath of what Hadrian is doing, um, we have

1137
00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:04.510
intellectuals who give speeches in Rome where they talk

1138
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:08.879
about how The city of Rome is this unique

1139
00:59:08.879 --> 00:59:11.959
thing because it creates this empire that identifies the

1140
00:59:11.959 --> 00:59:15.659
most talented people everywhere and it brings them in

1141
00:59:15.879 --> 00:59:18.719
um and integrates them into its society and makes

1142
00:59:18.719 --> 00:59:21.550
them its leaders. And so now in Greek, the

1143
00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:23.399
same model that we've seen all the way back

1144
00:59:23.399 --> 00:59:26.300
to, you know, uh, to the to the kings,

1145
00:59:26.639 --> 00:59:28.600
the Greek intellectuals are now saying, well this is

1146
00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:32.040
happening to us too. Uh, AND we are Roman

1147
00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:34.620
and the best of us are as Roman as,

1148
00:59:34.739 --> 00:59:38.500
you know, Cato or Caesar, right? We are fully

1149
00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:42.010
participating in this as not just subjects but as

1150
00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:45.250
citizens and as leaders, uh, and we're invested just

1151
00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:47.459
in the same way that everybody else was. And

1152
00:59:47.459 --> 00:59:49.179
this I think is a, is a great contribution

1153
00:59:49.179 --> 00:59:51.060
that Hadrian makes because he does it in a

1154
00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:53.370
way that is not domineering at all. It's about

1155
00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:56.100
rewarding these people and providing them with things that

1156
00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:59.129
they see to be valuable. Um, AND so, you

1157
00:59:59.129 --> 01:00:00.889
know, I think this is the great success of

1158
01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:03.570
Trajan and Hadrian, right? There is a, an understanding

1159
01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:06.610
of how far you can push Roman territory and

1160
01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:08.370
then an idea that, you know, you should draw

1161
01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:12.679
a line and focus instead on making everything on

1162
01:00:12.679 --> 01:00:16.479
the Roman side of that line fully Roman. In

1163
01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:19.379
the way that the Italian peninsula, you know, became

1164
01:00:19.919 --> 01:00:23.679
Roman, let's make the entirety of this state that's

1165
01:00:23.679 --> 01:00:27.149
the size of, you know, modern Australia. Let's make

1166
01:00:27.149 --> 01:00:30.810
this all Roman. Um, AND this I think is

1167
01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:33.939
a really, really important contribution that these emperors make,

1168
01:00:33.969 --> 01:00:36.429
cause they intend to do it. They understand exactly

1169
01:00:36.429 --> 01:00:37.770
what they're doing and why it's important.

1170
01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.810
So let's talk a little bit now about how

1171
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:45.409
Rome became Christian. So what was the role played

1172
01:00:45.409 --> 01:00:49.570
by Constantine in the creation of the Christian Roman

1173
01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:54.649
Empire and more broadly, how was Rome made Christian?

1174
01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:57.350
Yeah, so I think that this um in a

1175
01:00:57.350 --> 01:00:59.469
way it builds on the tradition that we're just

1176
01:00:59.469 --> 01:01:01.939
talking about. You know, Hadrian dies in, in, um,

1177
01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:07.379
in 139 AD uh A lifetime later, in 212

1178
01:01:07.379 --> 01:01:09.540
AD there is an emperor that passes a law

1179
01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.459
that says that everybody in this empire is now

1180
01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:13.899
a citizen. And once you do that, you now

1181
01:01:13.899 --> 01:01:16.719
have a structure so that everybody in this empire

1182
01:01:16.719 --> 01:01:20.340
can participate in a kind of common project. What

1183
01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.100
Constantine then does when he converts to Christianity, which

1184
01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.580
is, he converts to Christianity in 312. So the

1185
01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:29.060
extension of citizenship is in 212. Um, WHAT Constantine

1186
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.060
then does is he adds a religious kind of

1187
01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:34.820
layer to this notion of everybody participates in the

1188
01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:38.300
Roman state. So Constantine's conversion is something that um

1189
01:01:38.699 --> 01:01:41.860
is somewhat controversial. There's even arguments, there's still arguments

1190
01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:45.159
about whether he was sincere in converting. Um, I

1191
01:01:45.419 --> 01:01:48.139
personally think there is no argument about that at

1192
01:01:48.139 --> 01:01:50.760
all. Uh, IT makes total sense that the story

1193
01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.659
we're told about Constantine's conversion, which is he's fighting

1194
01:01:53.659 --> 01:01:55.729
a war, he doesn't think he will win. He

1195
01:01:55.729 --> 01:01:59.060
has a vision, um, where he sees a symbol,

1196
01:01:59.139 --> 01:02:02.469
a Christian symbol that then Jesus appears. AND says

1197
01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:04.949
that's my symbol, put it on your shield. He

1198
01:02:04.949 --> 01:02:08.689
wins a sort of spectacular and unexpected victory. Constantine

1199
01:02:08.689 --> 01:02:12.060
is a Christian from 312 AD. Uh, BUT what

1200
01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:16.550
Constantine wants to do is take this Roman state

1201
01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:19.899
that is now, um, in many ways A nation

1202
01:02:19.899 --> 01:02:23.300
state, right? Everybody living in Roman territory from Britain

1203
01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:27.020
to Saudi Arabia is a Roman citizen. Everybody living

1204
01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:30.699
in Roman territory now shares this common identity legally

1205
01:02:30.699 --> 01:02:33.739
and to a degree also culturally and intellectually that

1206
01:02:33.739 --> 01:02:38.449
they are Roman. Well, Constantine then um begins to

1207
01:02:38.449 --> 01:02:41.110
realize in the first the first sort of cent

1208
01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:43.989
first decade after he converts to Christianity. What he

1209
01:02:43.989 --> 01:02:47.889
begins to realize is um he has the possibility

1210
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:52.250
of teaching all of these Roman citizens to um

1211
01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:54.790
embrace Christianity. And he needs to come up with

1212
01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:56.469
a way to do it that's consistent with what

1213
01:02:56.469 --> 01:02:58.429
it means to be a Roman citizen, right? And

1214
01:02:58.429 --> 01:02:59.469
he needs to come up with a way to

1215
01:02:59.469 --> 01:03:02.010
do it that is not imposing this on people

1216
01:03:02.189 --> 01:03:06.250
but convincing them. That Christianity is, is a part

1217
01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:08.169
of and should be a part of what the

1218
01:03:08.169 --> 01:03:11.330
Roman state does. Uh, AND he says at one

1219
01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:14.290
point, um, he, he writes a document where he

1220
01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:18.610
says Christianity is not new. What Christianity represents is

1221
01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:22.090
a return to this old idea where we all

1222
01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.250
knew at one point as humans, there was God.

1223
01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:29.139
And over time, different people, different languages, different traditions,

1224
01:03:29.219 --> 01:03:31.340
you know, they lost that sense that there was

1225
01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:34.169
one God. What Christianity does is it provides us

1226
01:03:34.169 --> 01:03:36.540
with a way to get everybody, you know, Egyptians

1227
01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:39.659
and Syrians and Spaniards and people from Gaul and

1228
01:03:39.659 --> 01:03:41.899
people from Italy and, and people from Greece, you

1229
01:03:41.899 --> 01:03:44.379
know, all of them can realize that their traditions

1230
01:03:44.379 --> 01:03:46.544
all go back again to this world. God. And

1231
01:03:46.544 --> 01:03:49.735
I as Constantine, I'm going to create structures that

1232
01:03:49.735 --> 01:03:53.304
will show everybody in this empire that all of

1233
01:03:53.304 --> 01:03:58.024
their diverse traditions, um, religious traditions can be kind

1234
01:03:58.024 --> 01:04:00.745
of brought together towards one God in the same

1235
01:04:00.745 --> 01:04:03.705
way that all of their diverse political identifications can

1236
01:04:03.705 --> 01:04:05.824
be brought together into this like structure that is

1237
01:04:05.824 --> 01:04:09.725
Roman. Uh, AND so the conversion of Constantine, um,

1238
01:04:10.189 --> 01:04:13.989
It leads to ultimately the Christianization of much of

1239
01:04:13.989 --> 01:04:17.750
this space because of the Roman project, because of

1240
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:21.750
the Roman state structure. Christianity is a very appealing

1241
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:24.389
religion in the 4th century AD. It would have

1242
01:04:24.389 --> 01:04:28.070
made tremendous inroads across the Mediterranean by itself without

1243
01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:31.709
Constantine. Um, BUT it was only probably 10% of

1244
01:04:31.709 --> 01:04:33.909
the Roman population that was Christian at the time

1245
01:04:33.909 --> 01:04:37.050
Constantine converts. And it's, it's this ability of emperors

1246
01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:40.469
in the 4th century from Constantine forward to blend

1247
01:04:40.469 --> 01:04:43.989
this notion of, you know, Christianity as a religion

1248
01:04:43.989 --> 01:04:47.550
that everybody regardless of your background can embrace with

1249
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.949
this notion of we as Romans all share a

1250
01:04:49.949 --> 01:04:52.879
common project that gets it kind of over the,

1251
01:04:52.949 --> 01:04:54.629
the bump to get it to a sort of

1252
01:04:54.629 --> 01:04:59.439
majority status and 100 years after Constantine's um conversion,

1253
01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:02.360
Christianity is the majority religion in the Roman Empire.

1254
01:05:02.489 --> 01:05:06.969
Probably, you know, even 60% of the empire in

1255
01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:09.969
412 is Christian. And I think it has a

1256
01:05:09.969 --> 01:05:12.790
lot to do with the understanding these emperors have

1257
01:05:12.969 --> 01:05:15.449
of how this state structure and this notion of

1258
01:05:15.449 --> 01:05:18.620
participating in a state that also belongs to you

1259
01:05:18.879 --> 01:05:21.320
can be used to foster a kind of religious

1260
01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:25.645
transformation that these emperors believe also enhances the Um,

1261
01:05:25.725 --> 01:05:29.044
the, the success of this Roman political project. I

1262
01:05:29.044 --> 01:05:32.524
mean to them, politics and religion work together. This

1263
01:05:32.524 --> 01:05:35.364
is better religion. Getting everybody in the Roman state

1264
01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:38.125
to embrace it makes everybody in that state sort

1265
01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:41.245
of stronger because the state becomes stronger. Uh, AND

1266
01:05:41.245 --> 01:05:42.564
so I think that this, you know, I think

1267
01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:46.885
what Constantine does is, is in a way, totally

1268
01:05:46.885 --> 01:05:49.435
different from anything what, anything the Roman Emperor had

1269
01:05:49.435 --> 01:05:52.284
ever done, but also the mechanism is pretty consistent.

1270
01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:55.179
With how Roman emperors had always been working, right?

1271
01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:57.860
You, you acknowledge the rights of your citizens to

1272
01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:59.899
choose, uh, and then you convince them.

1273
01:06:01.679 --> 01:06:06.080
So let me ask you now one of the

1274
01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:10.159
questions that is, that are the most debated ever.

1275
01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:14.280
So what brought about the end of the Roman

1276
01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.600
West and how did it occur?

1277
01:06:17.729 --> 01:06:20.500
I think this is, um, so there are sources

1278
01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.459
that talk about this in a way that I

1279
01:06:22.459 --> 01:06:24.580
think is, is dead on. I think they completely

1280
01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.820
understood what was happening. Um, I think in a

1281
01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:30.850
sentence, the Roman West committed suicide. Um, AND, you

1282
01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:33.580
know, and the reason for this is, is, you

1283
01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:36.070
know, like everything in Roman history is somewhat complicated.

1284
01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:40.590
But, um, basically in 395 AD the empire is

1285
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:44.360
intact. Um, THERE is one emperor, there are co-emperors,

1286
01:06:44.409 --> 01:06:46.629
but there's one emperor who is the supreme authority

1287
01:06:46.629 --> 01:06:49.760
in both East and West. Uh, AND he dies

1288
01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.889
prematurely and he leaves a son in charge of

1289
01:06:52.889 --> 01:06:55.810
the east who is, I mean, OK, but not

1290
01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:57.489
great, and a son in charge of the West

1291
01:06:57.489 --> 01:07:00.620
who is a moron. Um, AND, you know, not

1292
01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:03.540
capable of doing the job at all. Uh, AND

1293
01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.790
what happens is the, the, the sort of terrible

1294
01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:13.260
qualities of the Emperor Norius mesh with, um, Uh,

1295
01:07:13.379 --> 01:07:16.860
sort of almost racism, um, where some of his

1296
01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.679
generals who do have the best interests of the

1297
01:07:19.679 --> 01:07:22.959
Roman West in mind, they get killed, their policies

1298
01:07:22.959 --> 01:07:26.219
get, um, overturned simply because they were promoted by

1299
01:07:26.219 --> 01:07:29.570
a Germanic general and, uh, and then you have,

1300
01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:32.780
um, advisors who frankly don't care about what's going

1301
01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:36.110
on outside of their court. This creates a kind

1302
01:07:36.110 --> 01:07:39.949
of power vacuum that encourages people who are Roman

1303
01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:43.639
places very far from Italy to make decisions that

1304
01:07:43.639 --> 01:07:45.550
they would not make if the Roman state was

1305
01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:49.469
still strong. So these are decisions like um in

1306
01:07:49.469 --> 01:07:52.370
the city of Trier, there is a city councilor

1307
01:07:52.469 --> 01:07:55.459
whose wife is insulted. And he decides to open

1308
01:07:55.459 --> 01:07:59.020
the gates to a barbarian group to come into

1309
01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.679
the city of Trier simply because he's, he's angry

1310
01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:04.219
that somebody made fun of his wife, right? This

1311
01:08:04.219 --> 01:08:07.300
would not happen in a functional Roman state. And

1312
01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.699
what is he doing there? He's not disavowing his

1313
01:08:09.699 --> 01:08:12.780
Romanness. This isn't like he's giving the city over

1314
01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:15.179
in exchange, you know, for becoming the Duke of

1315
01:08:15.179 --> 01:08:18.180
Trier. He's just angry because somebody made fun of

1316
01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:20.828
his wife. Um, AND, and then you have this,

1317
01:08:20.948 --> 01:08:24.548
this happening over and over and over again, where

1318
01:08:24.548 --> 01:08:27.578
elites in the, um, the parts of the Western

1319
01:08:27.578 --> 01:08:30.269
Empire, especially in France, what's now France, but, but

1320
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:33.948
across the Western Empire are making deals that are

1321
01:08:33.948 --> 01:08:36.309
against the interests of the Roman state because they're

1322
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:38.429
in their own interests. They don't trust that the

1323
01:08:38.429 --> 01:08:44.408
Roman state is um is strong enough to punish

1324
01:08:44.408 --> 01:08:46.969
them if they do this stuff. And so they

1325
01:08:46.969 --> 01:08:49.528
keep doing it. Um, AND so, and so the,

1326
01:08:49.608 --> 01:08:53.008
the fall of the Roman West really is a

1327
01:08:53.008 --> 01:08:56.368
set of stories of people acting in their own

1328
01:08:56.368 --> 01:08:59.688
very narrow self-interest against the best interests of this,

1329
01:08:59.798 --> 01:09:02.099
this sort of common entity that they belong to.

1330
01:09:02.669 --> 01:09:04.750
And we have a source, um, a bishop named

1331
01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:07.549
Salvian of Marseille who writes about this, where he

1332
01:09:07.549 --> 01:09:10.189
says that, you know, you, you have these people

1333
01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:13.229
who are, you know, charged with collecting taxes to

1334
01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:17.310
build defensive um structures to defend against barbarians and

1335
01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:19.390
instead they pocket the taxes and they, you know,

1336
01:09:19.509 --> 01:09:24.889
they're corrupt. And ultimately regular Romans decide Why am

1337
01:09:24.889 --> 01:09:27.749
I doing this? You know, and they walk away

1338
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:29.729
from, and Salvian says they walk away from their

1339
01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:32.849
Roman identity, not because it doesn't mean something to

1340
01:09:32.849 --> 01:09:36.288
them, but because it isn't doing anything for them

1341
01:09:36.288 --> 01:09:39.729
anymore, right? The state is so unable to defend

1342
01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:41.929
them against corruption that why are they gonna trust

1343
01:09:41.929 --> 01:09:45.959
it anymore and they just become non-Roman. Because the

1344
01:09:45.959 --> 01:09:48.560
people who are in charge of, you know, making

1345
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.129
sure that things work like they should have kind

1346
01:09:51.129 --> 01:09:54.279
of absconded, you know, the responsibility of being Roman.

1347
01:09:54.919 --> 01:09:57.160
And so I think when you're talking about the

1348
01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.629
swath of territory outside of Italy. It committed suicide,

1349
01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:04.990
right? The, these people who were Roman instead of

1350
01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:09.160
rallying and defending themselves against these non-Romans who are

1351
01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.870
coming in, decide that it's better for me personally

1352
01:10:13.129 --> 01:10:16.100
to cooperate with them. And so on a very

1353
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:18.970
small level, they're making that same decision that Tarquini

1354
01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:21.470
Superbus made, right? The state, it doesn't belong to

1355
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:24.100
everybody. This small piece of it belongs to me.

1356
01:10:24.359 --> 01:10:26.520
And I'm gonna do what's best for me regardless

1357
01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.640
of what happens to, you know, this larger thing.

1358
01:10:29.319 --> 01:10:32.879
Um, AND it's a betrayal. Um, AND it's a

1359
01:10:32.879 --> 01:10:36.000
betrayal that then we know other people respond to

1360
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.680
because our sources tell us once the elites give

1361
01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.520
up their faith in this project, why is anybody

1362
01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.000
else gonna have any faith in this project? Uh,

1363
01:10:45.029 --> 01:10:47.720
AND so Italy is different, but for the rest

1364
01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:52.080
of this territory, a lot of this loss of

1365
01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:56.620
Roman territory isn't because Um, these cities are all

1366
01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:00.660
besieged excessively and fall apart. There's actually not a

1367
01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.660
lot of resistance at all. It's just people kind

1368
01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:03.220
of giving up.

1369
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:09.520
But then we still have the Roman Empire of

1370
01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:14.459
the East. Were the Byzantines also Romans?

1371
01:11:15.279 --> 01:11:19.839
Yes, they called themselves Romans. Um, THEY called their

1372
01:11:19.839 --> 01:11:24.799
country Romania. They called their language Romaica. Uh, THE

1373
01:11:24.799 --> 01:11:27.120
idea of Byzantium, and, and a great person for

1374
01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.720
this, um, the work of Anthony Caldeli and then

1375
01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:32.979
Leonora Nevill, um, they have done really good things

1376
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.600
to show where this idea of Byzantium comes from.

1377
01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:40.279
Um, NOBODY in that empire had any doubt whatsoever

1378
01:11:40.279 --> 01:11:42.359
that they're wrong. In fact, like all of those

1379
01:11:42.359 --> 01:11:44.200
sources we talked about earlier that are written in

1380
01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.439
Greek about early Rome, they survived because Byzantines copied

1381
01:11:48.439 --> 01:11:52.069
them, because they aren't Byzantines, they're Romans. And so

1382
01:11:52.069 --> 01:11:55.459
the history of Rome in Italy. Uh, MOST of

1383
01:11:55.459 --> 01:11:57.700
what we have that talks about it, the best

1384
01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:00.060
sort of string of narratives we have are actually

1385
01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:03.100
written in Greek because this is the history of

1386
01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:05.970
the people living in Constantinople, and they preserve it,

1387
01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.529
not because it's weird and esoteric, but because it's

1388
01:12:08.529 --> 01:12:11.580
theirs. Um, AND so, you know, so when we

1389
01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:14.430
think about these people, we, we use words like

1390
01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:17.680
Greeks and Byzantines that they wouldn't use to describe

1391
01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:20.419
themselves. Um, AND what we do when we talk

1392
01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:23.660
about them in that way is we break the

1393
01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.620
sense of continuity that they understood to be very,

1394
01:12:26.729 --> 01:12:29.080
very real. I mean they are living in a

1395
01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.899
Roman state. They didn't give it up, right? People

1396
01:12:31.899 --> 01:12:35.089
in France gave up that state willingly. In many

1397
01:12:35.089 --> 01:12:37.669
cases. They didn't. They fought for it. They fought

1398
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:39.850
for it for another 1000, you know, almost 1000

1399
01:12:39.850 --> 01:12:43.810
years. Um, AND there's a credit that we have

1400
01:12:43.810 --> 01:12:46.529
to do to them by acknowledging this reality because

1401
01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:50.089
this reality mattered to them so greatly that they

1402
01:12:50.089 --> 01:12:51.609
fought for it in a way that a lot

1403
01:12:51.609 --> 01:12:54.080
of people in the West didn't. Um, AND so,

1404
01:12:54.129 --> 01:12:56.990
you know, so I think, are they Roman? Absolutely.

1405
01:12:57.529 --> 01:12:59.410
Um, AGAIN, going back to this idea, anybody who

1406
01:12:59.410 --> 01:13:01.810
says they're Roman, if we don't understand why, we

1407
01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:05.930
need to Challenge ourselves, not them. But in this

1408
01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:08.930
case, it's very easy to understand why, right? They

1409
01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:11.109
live in a Roman state, the same Roman state

1410
01:13:11.109 --> 01:13:13.330
that was, you know, founded in the Palatine Hill

1411
01:13:13.330 --> 01:13:15.569
in the 8th century BC. They still live in

1412
01:13:15.569 --> 01:13:19.970
it. Nothing changed in 330 AD when the city

1413
01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:22.970
of Constantinople was founded and scholars want to start

1414
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:27.410
Byzantine history. Nothing changed. Um, AND the people living

1415
01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:30.140
in the east. ARE Roman. They believe they're Roman.

1416
01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:32.180
They have no reason to not believe they're Roman

1417
01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:34.779
and, you know, and their state does not disappear.

1418
01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:37.759
It lasts um for a very long time after

1419
01:13:37.759 --> 01:13:37.979
that.

1420
01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.729
And what happened after the death of Justinian?

1421
01:13:45.339 --> 01:13:48.979
Well, so Justinian is, um, I mean because again

1422
01:13:48.979 --> 01:13:51.209
we have such a, a long scope of Roman

1423
01:13:51.209 --> 01:13:53.660
history. There are a few towering figures that come

1424
01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:56.419
into, um, you know, come into Roman history and,

1425
01:13:56.459 --> 01:13:59.339
and like loom over in some cases an entire

1426
01:13:59.339 --> 01:14:03.049
century. Justinian is one of those figures. Um, Justinian

1427
01:14:03.049 --> 01:14:07.790
is a, a figure who is incredibly Incredibly smart.

1428
01:14:08.279 --> 01:14:11.200
Um, HE'S tireless. The man never, I mean, our

1429
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.569
sources say he never sleeps. He says he never

1430
01:14:13.569 --> 01:14:15.970
sleeps, but our sources also say he never sleeps.

1431
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:19.129
Um, AND, and he has the intellectual capacity to

1432
01:14:19.129 --> 01:14:21.890
really do remarkable things, but he also has a

1433
01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:24.540
tremendous amount of arrogance. Um, AND so, you know,

1434
01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.899
part of what makes the Roman state so successful

1435
01:14:26.899 --> 01:14:29.859
for so long is this idea that like we

1436
01:14:29.859 --> 01:14:32.220
do embrace what's new. We do embrace innovation, we

1437
01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:34.419
do embrace new ideas and new people, but we

1438
01:14:34.419 --> 01:14:38.839
also remain grounded to the institutions and traditions um

1439
01:14:38.839 --> 01:14:40.799
that made us what we are, right? We don't

1440
01:14:40.799 --> 01:14:43.859
radically change things. If we're Rome, we don't radically

1441
01:14:43.859 --> 01:14:45.620
change things. We try to change things, you know,

1442
01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:48.299
in the margins to keep these institutions as strong

1443
01:14:48.299 --> 01:14:51.259
as they have historically been. Justinian didn't believe that,

1444
01:14:51.379 --> 01:14:54.339
like at all. Um, AND so there are really

1445
01:14:54.339 --> 01:14:58.399
dramatic, um, changes that Justinian institutes in the Roman

1446
01:14:58.399 --> 01:15:00.720
state that, um, completely break with the way the

1447
01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.240
state had functioned before. Um, AND so, you know,

1448
01:15:03.319 --> 01:15:05.200
so, so one of these, the most famous of

1449
01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.040
these is the, um, idea to codify all of

1450
01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:11.109
Roman law. Which is fine if you're gonna write

1451
01:15:11.109 --> 01:15:13.350
down all of Roman law, but Roman law works

1452
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:16.189
in a process where, you know, the first Roman

1453
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:19.109
legal code was the 12 Tables founded, created around

1454
01:15:19.109 --> 01:15:22.830
450 BC. Roman law then built on it and

1455
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:25.950
everything was valid from 450 BC. See through the

1456
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:29.589
time of Justinian in the 520s AD what Justinian

1457
01:15:29.589 --> 01:15:32.060
said is, uh, that's not gonna be true anymore.

1458
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:34.430
I'm gonna take all of Roman law. I'm gonna

1459
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:36.990
say what is valid. Everything that I don't say

1460
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:39.189
is valid, is not valid anymore and so Roman

1461
01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:42.660
law starts now, right? There's 1000 years of Roman

1462
01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:46.669
law that has built upon itself. OK, well, here's

1463
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:50.129
a new line. Everything starts again, you know, now.

1464
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:53.640
That is not how Roman law worked. Um, HE,

1465
01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.240
when he decided, he decided to go to the

1466
01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.680
west and reconquer a lot of the territory that

1467
01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.839
Rome lost. Uh, HE decides to do this, um,

1468
01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.520
In a way that wasn't really consistent with how

1469
01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.000
the East had thought about this. You know, the

1470
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.600
regime in Italy to most people in the east

1471
01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:11.240
in the 5, in the 470s, even in the

1472
01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.069
510s was a Roman regime. It wasn't a barbarian

1473
01:16:15.069 --> 01:16:17.799
kingdom. Justinian decides that it's a barbarian kingdom, I

1474
01:16:17.799 --> 01:16:20.399
want to go and take it back. Um, BUT

1475
01:16:20.399 --> 01:16:22.319
one of the most significant things that Justinian does

1476
01:16:22.319 --> 01:16:26.359
is he um overextends the Roman state militarily and

1477
01:16:26.359 --> 01:16:29.680
financially. So he pays for all of this stuff

1478
01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.040
because he has a real, I mean he has

1479
01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:34.589
like a Um, Goldman Sachs level understanding of the

1480
01:16:34.589 --> 01:16:38.129
bond market. And he is able to, to use

1481
01:16:38.129 --> 01:16:41.069
the Roman bond market to pay for huge amounts

1482
01:16:41.069 --> 01:16:43.950
of things. I mean, um, building churches like Hagia

1483
01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:48.060
Sophia in Constantinople, building forts all across the Balkans,

1484
01:16:48.109 --> 01:16:51.759
invading Italy, invading North Africa, invading Spain. Um, ALL

1485
01:16:51.759 --> 01:16:53.549
of these are things that just Indian funds more

1486
01:16:53.549 --> 01:16:57.029
or less with bonds, and he builds everything on

1487
01:16:57.029 --> 01:17:01.500
this kind of Very um shaky structure, right? He

1488
01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:04.580
conquers Italy with a few 10 thousands of troops.

1489
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:08.020
Um, YOU know, when the Romans conquered Italy the

1490
01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:10.500
first time in, in the, 3rd century BC, these

1491
01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:14.049
were with armies of hundreds of thousands. And, um,

1492
01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:16.620
and Justinian has done this and supported all of

1493
01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:20.859
this with basically borrowed money. All of this could

1494
01:17:20.859 --> 01:17:23.740
work if you had somebody as smart as Justinian

1495
01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:28.290
managing all of, you know, the The different moving

1496
01:17:28.290 --> 01:17:31.279
pieces of this system, but the system itself is

1497
01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:34.049
very fragile and requires somebody who's very smart and

1498
01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:36.330
very well in tune with how it works to

1499
01:17:36.330 --> 01:17:38.649
keep it all balanced, and the person who follows

1500
01:17:38.649 --> 01:17:43.080
Justinian is not that person. Um, AND so what

1501
01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.709
ends up happening is within the span of about

1502
01:17:46.209 --> 01:17:50.080
5 years, he guts the financial system and destroys

1503
01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:54.089
the bond market. He, uh, subjects Italy to an

1504
01:17:54.089 --> 01:17:56.649
invasion by Lombards that he doesn't have any ability

1505
01:17:56.649 --> 01:18:00.770
to counter. Uh, AND then he starts wars with

1506
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:03.040
people in the Balkans and with Persia in the

1507
01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.910
east and then he goes crazy. Um, AND when

1508
01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:09.750
he goes crazy, his wife basically has to sort

1509
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:12.750
of manage all of these problems, but he's so

1510
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:18.209
quickly, um, Loss that balance that Justinian had very

1511
01:18:18.209 --> 01:18:21.330
carefully built, that the empire enters a very serious

1512
01:18:21.330 --> 01:18:24.729
and prolonged crisis. And so um what Justinian had

1513
01:18:24.729 --> 01:18:26.890
built, most people feel that what Justinian had built

1514
01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:29.990
was not sustainable. I actually think it was sustainable

1515
01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:34.649
if Justinian were managing it. Um, BUT there is

1516
01:18:34.649 --> 01:18:37.169
no one like Justinian, right? He is a very

1517
01:18:37.169 --> 01:18:40.370
unique figure with very unique capacities, and the person

1518
01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:44.209
who follows him, you know, is mediocre and The

1519
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:48.189
risks of this whole very complicated system failing quickly

1520
01:18:48.509 --> 01:18:51.589
um are so great that when somebody mediocre comes

1521
01:18:51.589 --> 01:18:55.370
in, they, it all fails spectacularly. Uh, AND you

1522
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:56.810
know, and I think this is the legacy of

1523
01:18:56.810 --> 01:19:00.509
Justinian, right? In a sense, he is too smart

1524
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:03.649
for the world in which he's operating. And part

1525
01:19:03.649 --> 01:19:06.879
of why Rome succeeds for so long is those

1526
01:19:06.879 --> 01:19:10.509
institutions, they mean something. And if you have somebody

1527
01:19:10.509 --> 01:19:13.240
who is brilliant and scraps all of the institutions

1528
01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:17.000
that made a state work, it can function well

1529
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.569
when you have someone who's brilliant, but the world

1530
01:19:19.569 --> 01:19:22.319
doesn't always guarantee that brilliance is going to follow

1531
01:19:22.319 --> 01:19:25.600
brilliance and without institutions to kind of regulate how

1532
01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.379
things are done. You don't have any structures. And

1533
01:19:28.379 --> 01:19:30.330
I think after Justinian what you have is a

1534
01:19:30.330 --> 01:19:32.259
collapse of all of the structures that he had

1535
01:19:32.259 --> 01:19:35.379
built uh because they were in a sense not

1536
01:19:35.379 --> 01:19:37.899
grounded in the long way that the Roman state

1537
01:19:37.899 --> 01:19:41.080
had worked. They were instead grounded in his own

1538
01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:45.879
really spectacularly complicated thinking. Um, AND, and it causes

1539
01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:49.580
a catastrophe. Um, A catastrophe that I think fundamentally

1540
01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:51.620
changes, you know, the history of the Mediterranean and

1541
01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:52.720
ultimately the history of the world.

1542
01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.479
Yeah, and we're also going to talk a little

1543
01:19:56.479 --> 01:20:00.080
bit more about the factors behind the longevity of

1544
01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:03.600
Rome toward the end of our conversation, but how

1545
01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.600
did the secession of the city of Rome from

1546
01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.600
the Roman state happen?

1547
01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:13.839
Yeah, so the succession of Rome, um, I mean,

1548
01:20:13.879 --> 01:20:18.160
in a sense it follows on the, the catastrophic

1549
01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:21.399
aftermath of the Justinianic, the collapse of the Justinianic

1550
01:20:21.399 --> 01:20:24.540
order, um, because the catastrophes in the east ultimately

1551
01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.720
lead to, um, the loss of a lot of

1552
01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.680
Roman territory south of what's now Turkey to the

1553
01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:33.040
Arabs. Um, YOU know, Justinian's collapse, you know, was

1554
01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.759
very nicely timed to coincide with, um, the rise

1555
01:20:36.759 --> 01:20:39.359
of Islam and, you know, the, the teachings of

1556
01:20:39.359 --> 01:20:43.169
Muhammad. Uh, AND so about, you know, a lifetime

1557
01:20:43.169 --> 01:20:46.810
after Justinian dies, the eastern Mediterranean south of what's

1558
01:20:46.810 --> 01:20:50.770
now basically southeastern Turkey, it's under Muslim control, uh,

1559
01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:53.799
because the Romans lack the ability to maintain control

1560
01:20:53.799 --> 01:20:57.129
of this territory, uh, and, you know, the structures

1561
01:20:57.129 --> 01:20:59.970
that Justinian had built led to very long warfare

1562
01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:01.850
with the Persians that let the Arabs come in.

1563
01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:04.870
Um, IN Italy, you know, the, the collapse is

1564
01:21:05.009 --> 01:21:07.950
a similar thing. It just is less territory. So,

1565
01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.770
um, the collapse of the Justinian order leads to

1566
01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:14.770
Lombards coming into Northern Italy and Roman control being

1567
01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:16.569
confined more or less to the southern part of

1568
01:21:16.569 --> 01:21:19.229
Italy and then a strip of land from, uh,

1569
01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.334
reaching more. More or less from um the Tyrrhenian

1570
01:21:21.334 --> 01:21:24.194
Sea by, by Ostia to the Adriatic um in,

1571
01:21:24.305 --> 01:21:28.035
in Ravenna, but it's not stable and Roman control

1572
01:21:28.035 --> 01:21:30.915
of that territory um because they are being very

1573
01:21:30.915 --> 01:21:34.714
greatly pressed by the Arabs, they don't have resources

1574
01:21:34.714 --> 01:21:37.075
to send to actually defend the city of Rome.

1575
01:21:37.435 --> 01:21:39.354
And so the secession of the city of Rome

1576
01:21:39.354 --> 01:21:40.944
happens really in the middle part of the 8th

1577
01:21:40.944 --> 01:21:45.200
century, um, but it happens because When the Roman

1578
01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:49.759
state doesn't intervene to defend the city of Rome,

1579
01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.899
uh, the papacy steps in and starts organizing things

1580
01:21:52.899 --> 01:21:57.020
on its own. And the papacy very soon realizes

1581
01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:02.689
that, um, you know, the It has separate interests

1582
01:22:02.689 --> 01:22:06.049
from the emperors in Constantinople and sometimes the emperors

1583
01:22:06.049 --> 01:22:08.890
in Constantinople will use their political authority to do

1584
01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:12.209
things that um that are not consistent with what

1585
01:22:12.209 --> 01:22:14.089
the Vatican or what the, what the papacy wants

1586
01:22:14.089 --> 01:22:16.770
done. Um, AND the popes realized that they have

1587
01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:19.450
some leverage, right? They, they can choose to not

1588
01:22:19.450 --> 01:22:24.270
cooperate with that state. Um, AND ultimately the Lombards

1589
01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:26.950
start also realizing that the Roman state doesn't have

1590
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:29.990
the capacity to defend the city of Rome and

1591
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:33.390
they start pressing on territory, um, and looking like

1592
01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:35.109
they are going to conquer the city of Rome.

1593
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:38.250
And so the papacy decides We can either make

1594
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:41.020
a deal with the Lombards. Uh, WE can sort

1595
01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:43.500
of pray that the eastern emperor shows up or

1596
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.180
we can make a deal with the Franks. And

1597
01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:47.379
what the papacy does is they decide we're gonna

1598
01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:51.859
actually um remove ourselves from the control of the

1599
01:22:51.859 --> 01:22:55.540
eastern Emperor and ally ourselves with the Franks. And

1600
01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:59.060
it's a process that unfolds very, you know, slowly

1601
01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:00.810
and in a complicated way across more or less

1602
01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:04.660
a generation between about 750 to about like 770.

1603
01:23:05.089 --> 01:23:07.129
Um, BUT a key part of this is, is

1604
01:23:07.129 --> 01:23:09.930
a forged document that's very famous called the donation

1605
01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:12.649
of Constantine. Um, THAT appears sometimes in the 8th,

1606
01:23:12.729 --> 01:23:15.930
sometime in the 8th century, uh, and was created

1607
01:23:15.930 --> 01:23:18.930
to say that, um, when the Emperor Constantine converted

1608
01:23:18.930 --> 01:23:23.450
to Christianity, he gave the Western Empire and all

1609
01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:28.029
of its territory, including its crown to the Pope

1610
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:30.970
and therefore the Western Empire belonged to the Pope,

1611
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:33.879
uh, and the crown belonged to the Pope. And

1612
01:23:33.879 --> 01:23:36.600
so this provides the papacy with leverage to go

1613
01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.279
to the Franks and say, oh yeah, like we're,

1614
01:23:38.319 --> 01:23:40.399
you know, we legitimately should be in charge of

1615
01:23:40.399 --> 01:23:44.640
this territory. Everybody knows that this is made up,

1616
01:23:44.779 --> 01:23:46.270
right? Even the Franks know this is made up,

1617
01:23:46.330 --> 01:23:48.370
um, and anybody who'd ever seen a Roman law

1618
01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:49.770
would look at this thing and say this, this

1619
01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:53.509
is not a Roman law. Um, BUT it's, it's

1620
01:23:53.509 --> 01:23:58.410
rhetorical cover. Uh, AND this ultimately forms the rhetorical

1621
01:23:58.410 --> 01:24:03.209
cover that allows for the, the crowning of Charlemagne

1622
01:24:03.209 --> 01:24:06.129
in the year 800 AD where the Pope says,

1623
01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:09.209
I have, you know, the crown is mine, right?

1624
01:24:09.490 --> 01:24:11.810
The Western Empire is mine. I can do what

1625
01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:14.649
I want with it. And here is somebody who

1626
01:24:14.649 --> 01:24:17.555
is a, a Frankish king. We have this long

1627
01:24:17.555 --> 01:24:20.104
relationship with the Franks going back now, you know,

1628
01:24:20.274 --> 01:24:24.084
it's 880, so going back 50 years. Um, THEY

1629
01:24:24.084 --> 01:24:28.084
have guaranteed our security when the East could not.

1630
01:24:28.134 --> 01:24:30.924
And so I, as the person entrusted with this

1631
01:24:30.924 --> 01:24:33.444
Western crown, will give it to Charlemagne and Charlemagne,

1632
01:24:33.484 --> 01:24:36.839
you are now emperor of the Romans. Um, AND

1633
01:24:36.839 --> 01:24:39.000
you know, and it's all based on this, this

1634
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.479
kind of fiction that was used to justify the

1635
01:24:42.479 --> 01:24:45.680
city of Rome more or less jumping from the

1636
01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:48.160
Roman Empire. But I think what's interesting about this

1637
01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.439
is, you know, when we think of great cities

1638
01:24:50.439 --> 01:24:52.879
leaving the Roman Empire, we tend to think of

1639
01:24:52.879 --> 01:24:56.120
them being conquered by somebody else. Uh, AND so

1640
01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.709
it's interesting to realize that the city of Rome

1641
01:24:58.709 --> 01:25:01.770
basically just left. It just stepped out. It stepped

1642
01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:04.129
out of the state that it created. Um, AND

1643
01:25:04.129 --> 01:25:06.350
it stepped out of the state that it created

1644
01:25:06.569 --> 01:25:08.529
using a document that said, oh, it has the

1645
01:25:08.529 --> 01:25:11.810
legitimacy to do this. Uh, AND so, you know,

1646
01:25:11.890 --> 01:25:15.390
if you were to ask 1/9 century pope. Are

1647
01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:18.229
you, you know, is, is your entity part of

1648
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:20.229
the Roman state? They'd say, well, yes, of course,

1649
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:24.080
right? There's a direct correlation in a contact um

1650
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:26.169
where we were given the authority to do this

1651
01:25:26.169 --> 01:25:28.669
by Constantine and that's, that's Rome, right? So we

1652
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:31.069
have the, the legal right under Roman law to

1653
01:25:31.069 --> 01:25:34.640
do what we just did. Um. It's made up,

1654
01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:37.129
it's not true at all, but they would say

1655
01:25:37.129 --> 01:25:39.270
they have it, and so that actually makes things,

1656
01:25:39.330 --> 01:25:41.950
you know, quite interesting. Is Charlemagne a Roman emperor?

1657
01:25:43.009 --> 01:25:46.810
No and yes. Um, AND you know, uh, and

1658
01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:50.350
in Constantinople, it's interesting because they also say no

1659
01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.509
and yes for different reasons.

1660
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:58.359
And how about the Holy Roman Empire? I mean,

1661
01:25:58.479 --> 01:26:02.520
was it really Roman? Was it really an empire?

1662
01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:03.879
What's the deal with it?

1663
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.640
Yeah, the, the, the Voltaire question, right? Um, YEAH,

1664
01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.479
I think that the thing that's interesting about the

1665
01:26:10.479 --> 01:26:13.399
Holy Roman Empire is you have a Roman emperor,

1666
01:26:13.879 --> 01:26:17.200
but he doesn't actually rule over Romans. Right, so

1667
01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.339
the, the Roman state in the east is still

1668
01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.959
a version of this political entity where everybody is

1669
01:26:24.959 --> 01:26:27.600
a citizen and there's a sort of stakeholder. And

1670
01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.100
so everybody in the Roman, so the Roman emperor

1671
01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:33.120
is the emperor of Romans in the east, you

1672
01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.700
know, and, and so when you actually see things

1673
01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:40.580
like Um, the Celjuks conquer parts of Roman territory.

1674
01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:43.529
They call that territory the Celjuk of Rome because

1675
01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:45.379
they, it is, you know, or the Sultanate of

1676
01:26:45.379 --> 01:26:48.470
Rome because it is the Sultanate of Roman territory.

1677
01:26:48.729 --> 01:26:51.529
Um, AND so, you know, because there are Romans

1678
01:26:51.529 --> 01:26:54.450
living there. The Roman emperor in the Holy Roman

1679
01:26:54.450 --> 01:26:56.620
Empire, you know, he, he's in charge of the

1680
01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:59.819
Romans in the city of Rome, sometimes, sometimes, right?

1681
01:26:59.959 --> 01:27:02.089
Depending on how his relationship with the Pope is,

1682
01:27:02.419 --> 01:27:04.859
but it's not a Roman state because there aren't

1683
01:27:04.859 --> 01:27:08.080
Romans really living under him. It's not, you know,

1684
01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.240
he is a, a Roman emperor, but there aren't

1685
01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:14.939
Roman citizens under him. There's no sort of Roman

1686
01:27:16.029 --> 01:27:19.290
institutions or traditions or things that ground people in

1687
01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:25.759
Aachen or I don't know where, um, Hamburg to

1688
01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:29.379
this Roman state that lived before. Uh, AND so

1689
01:27:29.379 --> 01:27:32.180
you have in a sense like a Roman emperor.

1690
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:36.339
But no Romans. And so what is that? Um,

1691
01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:38.229
YOU know, I think is, is he, is he

1692
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:41.770
holy? Who knows, right? That's pretty subjective. Is he

1693
01:27:41.770 --> 01:27:45.500
Roman? He's not. Um, IS it an empire? Well,

1694
01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:47.740
when Voltaire says that it's not really either. It's

1695
01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:50.569
some sort of weird hybrid of a constitutional monarchy,

1696
01:27:50.819 --> 01:27:56.740
but, um, but When um Charlemagne does this, he

1697
01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:00.129
does have an imperial title. But it is a

1698
01:28:00.129 --> 01:28:02.330
title among all of the other titles he has

1699
01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:04.930
too. He's also the king of Lombardy. He's also

1700
01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:07.729
the king of the Franks, um, you know, he

1701
01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:10.959
has other titles as well, and the title Roman

1702
01:28:10.959 --> 01:28:14.930
Emperor is one of them. And it belongs to

1703
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:19.770
him as a title. In Constantinople, the um emperors

1704
01:28:19.770 --> 01:28:23.529
who are reigning in Constantinople, that title doesn't belong

1705
01:28:23.529 --> 01:28:27.850
to them. It's conferred upon them by representatives of

1706
01:28:27.850 --> 01:28:30.689
the Roman population. It's in a sense an office,

1707
01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:33.169
just like the consulship was an office in the

1708
01:28:33.169 --> 01:28:37.140
Roman Republic. It's not an office for Charlemagne, right?

1709
01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:39.580
It's like a bauble. It's like something you can

1710
01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:42.419
show off, but it's not an office and there's

1711
01:28:42.419 --> 01:28:45.979
no obligation to actual Romans to do anything in

1712
01:28:45.979 --> 01:28:50.009
accordance with that office, right? It's just It's a

1713
01:28:50.009 --> 01:28:51.180
nice thing to be able to say.

1714
01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:57.560
And so in medieval times, how was the Roman

1715
01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:00.240
state? What did it look like?

1716
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:05.819
Uh, SO, It's a very, it's a very long

1717
01:29:05.819 --> 01:29:08.419
period we're talking about between the Arab conquest and

1718
01:29:08.419 --> 01:29:10.879
then when the, the state I think actually collapses

1719
01:29:10.879 --> 01:29:12.819
to the Fourth Crusade. But more or less what

1720
01:29:12.819 --> 01:29:14.580
we can imagine is this is a state that's

1721
01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:20.509
centered on um what's now kind of Anatolia and

1722
01:29:20.509 --> 01:29:23.560
the Balkans, the southern Balkans. It gets bigger and

1723
01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:26.470
smaller, but the power base for the Roman state

1724
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:29.229
after the the collapse of the east and the

1725
01:29:29.229 --> 01:29:33.359
Arab conquest of the 7th century is really sort

1726
01:29:33.359 --> 01:29:39.060
of the area around Istanbul. Um, OR Constantinople, uh,

1727
01:29:39.169 --> 01:29:41.299
and then territory in Asia Minor and territory in

1728
01:29:41.299 --> 01:29:43.859
the Southern Balkans. It does hold on to Italy

1729
01:29:43.859 --> 01:29:45.850
for quite a while. Um, AND so Italy is,

1730
01:29:45.899 --> 01:29:48.220
is a part of this. Um, THE last sort

1731
01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:50.779
of Roman presence in Italy is not extinguished until

1732
01:29:50.779 --> 01:29:54.049
the 11th century. So, um, so for most of

1733
01:29:54.049 --> 01:29:55.819
this period, you can imagine sort of southern Italy,

1734
01:29:55.939 --> 01:29:59.979
the Southern Balkans, and, and Asia Minor. Um, WHAT

1735
01:29:59.979 --> 01:30:02.819
it does and how well it controls that territory

1736
01:30:02.819 --> 01:30:06.419
varies over time. So, uh, there are for a

1737
01:30:06.419 --> 01:30:09.979
long period in the 8th and, and 9th centuries,

1738
01:30:10.270 --> 01:30:15.060
um, Rome struggles to control territory, uh, beyond the

1739
01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:19.180
coasts of the Balkans. Um, AND it struggles to

1740
01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:21.899
control territory beyond the coastal areas of Asia Minor.

1741
01:30:22.279 --> 01:30:23.609
Uh, BY the time you get to the 11th

1742
01:30:23.609 --> 01:30:26.330
century, uh, it's, it's pretty firmly in control of

1743
01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:27.890
territory all the way up to the Danube in

1744
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:30.729
the Balkans and, you know, all the way across

1745
01:30:30.729 --> 01:30:33.089
to what's now sort of the modern Turkish eastern

1746
01:30:33.089 --> 01:30:37.089
border and southern border. So, um, so territorially, that's,

1747
01:30:37.169 --> 01:30:41.500
that's kind of what we're talking about. Ethnically, um,

1748
01:30:41.779 --> 01:30:44.609
mainly the people living in this for most of

1749
01:30:44.609 --> 01:30:48.089
that time are, you know, people who identify as

1750
01:30:48.089 --> 01:30:51.439
Romans who we would basically call Greeks. Uh, THEY

1751
01:30:51.439 --> 01:30:54.640
more or less speak Greek. They are mostly Christian.

1752
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:59.089
Um, THEY are mostly in line with, um, all

1753
01:30:59.089 --> 01:31:02.040
of the church councils of up to the 5th

1754
01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.839
century. So, you know, they're Chalcedonian, they're Nicene, they're,

1755
01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:10.009
um, It's a pretty homogeneous territory. As the territory

1756
01:31:10.009 --> 01:31:13.049
starts expanding again in the 10th and 11th centuries,

1757
01:31:13.129 --> 01:31:15.169
you start getting new people in there. So you

1758
01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:18.109
get some Bulgarians, you get some um Slavic people,

1759
01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:20.529
uh, and then in the east, you get Armenians

1760
01:31:20.529 --> 01:31:23.189
and you get Syrians. That complicates things a little

1761
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:24.779
bit. You even get some Muslims. It's not clear

1762
01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:26.970
how many Muslims, but, but you do have Muslim

1763
01:31:27.299 --> 01:31:30.799
communities. Um, AND that complicates things a little bit.

1764
01:31:30.939 --> 01:31:33.500
Uh, BUT generally speaking, I think when we are

1765
01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:37.359
talking about the medieval Roman state. We should imagine

1766
01:31:37.359 --> 01:31:40.540
that there is a basic core where these people

1767
01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.470
share a common history. They share more or less

1768
01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:46.799
a common language. They share a common religion, um,

1769
01:31:46.959 --> 01:31:50.439
they, they share a common citizenship. They share a

1770
01:31:50.439 --> 01:31:54.200
common legal structure, right? This is a much smaller

1771
01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:56.790
nation-state than we had, say, in the 4th century,

1772
01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:58.959
but this really is something that we have to

1773
01:31:58.959 --> 01:32:01.620
imagine functions like a proto nation state at least.

1774
01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:05.000
Um, AND, and there are all sort of institutions

1775
01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:07.319
that encourage you to think this way, right? So

1776
01:32:07.319 --> 01:32:09.500
if you go to church, um, you're gonna hear

1777
01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.339
things that talk about, you know, your religious life,

1778
01:32:11.419 --> 01:32:13.100
but you'll also hear things that talk about political

1779
01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:15.779
leaders, you know, like Constantine. Um, THEY, they give

1780
01:32:15.779 --> 01:32:20.049
you a kind of grounding in Christianity but also

1781
01:32:20.049 --> 01:32:24.089
Romanness. Uh, AND, and so it is a very

1782
01:32:24.089 --> 01:32:27.970
well-structured thing to try to, you know, make all

1783
01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:29.850
of these people very much understand that they are

1784
01:32:29.850 --> 01:32:33.450
still part of this common shared enterprise. Um, AND,

1785
01:32:33.529 --> 01:32:36.200
and I think that's an underappreciated skill of the

1786
01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.129
medieval state because other medieval states in Europe don't

1787
01:32:39.129 --> 01:32:42.410
do this. Um, YOU know, this, this is in

1788
01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:46.930
a sense a direct descent from the, uh, idea

1789
01:32:46.930 --> 01:32:49.330
of like the Polis and the citizenship of the

1790
01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:52.569
Polis from like deep antiquity, right? The Roman state

1791
01:32:52.569 --> 01:32:56.129
never totally loses that, that connection to this idea

1792
01:32:56.129 --> 01:32:59.450
that you belong to something versus, you know, if

1793
01:32:59.450 --> 01:33:02.169
you live in France in the year 1000, what

1794
01:33:02.169 --> 01:33:03.770
do you belong to? I mean, you know, you're,

1795
01:33:03.810 --> 01:33:06.770
you're like in a fiefdom and you're connected somehow

1796
01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:08.979
to like a lord or something, but you're not

1797
01:33:08.979 --> 01:33:11.689
part of a common project. Uh, IN the way

1798
01:33:11.689 --> 01:33:13.970
that, you know, Romans totally understood they were, and

1799
01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:17.470
in a way that is totally weirdly anachronistic, right?

1800
01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:20.229
It is a very old way of thinking about

1801
01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:24.770
your political identity that also looks very modern and,

1802
01:33:24.850 --> 01:33:26.529
you know, so there is this, this weird kind

1803
01:33:26.529 --> 01:33:30.129
of point of inflection between what came before and

1804
01:33:30.129 --> 01:33:31.209
what will come later.

1805
01:33:32.879 --> 01:33:36.680
So when does the history that you cover in

1806
01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:39.560
the book come to an end? I mean, when

1807
01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:42.959
did the death of the Roman state occur and

1808
01:33:42.959 --> 01:33:44.160
how did it happen?

1809
01:33:45.549 --> 01:33:48.310
Yeah, the death of the Roman state, um, it's

1810
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:51.709
like Hemingway's bankruptcy, right? It, it happens very slowly

1811
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:55.049
and then all at once. Um, THE, the real

1812
01:33:55.049 --> 01:33:58.149
crisis the Roman state faces, uh, there's a massive

1813
01:33:58.149 --> 01:34:00.609
loss of territory that occurs in the last part

1814
01:34:00.609 --> 01:34:03.709
of the 11th century and the Roman state has

1815
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:08.419
to adjust very quickly. It's, it's institutions and its

1816
01:34:08.419 --> 01:34:10.620
structures to deal with the fact that a lot

1817
01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:12.620
of the people who are important in that state

1818
01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:14.540
are from Anatolia and they lost a lot of

1819
01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:17.359
their, the territory that supported their wealth and position.

1820
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:20.490
Um, AND there are major, major threats that the

1821
01:34:20.490 --> 01:34:23.819
Emperor Alexius Komnenos has to deal with all kind

1822
01:34:23.819 --> 01:34:26.129
of at once. And so what he does is

1823
01:34:26.129 --> 01:34:28.129
he, he creates a number of sort of measures

1824
01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:32.229
of expediency that ultimately don't seem all that serious

1825
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:34.330
at the moment and he probably didn't have much

1826
01:34:34.330 --> 01:34:36.330
choice about what he was, you know, how he

1827
01:34:36.330 --> 01:34:38.930
was going to deal with these problems. Um, BUT

1828
01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:43.049
these measures are impossible to undo. So one of

1829
01:34:43.049 --> 01:34:45.330
the things that he does is he um instead

1830
01:34:45.330 --> 01:34:49.049
of paying bureaucrats, he gives them the first sort

1831
01:34:49.049 --> 01:34:53.250
of slice of the tax revenue from certain regions

1832
01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:55.589
of the empire because he doesn't have the money.

1833
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:58.529
And so this, this gets them invested in making

1834
01:34:58.529 --> 01:35:00.770
sure those regions are stable and paying their taxes

1835
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:02.589
and it's a good sort of short term way

1836
01:35:02.970 --> 01:35:05.569
to get money going. Um, HE has to deal

1837
01:35:05.569 --> 01:35:09.410
with Normans that are attacking from, um, from the

1838
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:11.810
West. So he makes an alliance with Venice where

1839
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:16.649
he gives Venice significant trade privileges. Uh, AND did

1840
01:35:16.649 --> 01:35:18.729
he really have a choice there? Not, not really.

1841
01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:21.370
And the Venetians do beat back the Normans, but

1842
01:35:21.370 --> 01:35:23.305
those trade privileges are things that he can never

1843
01:35:23.305 --> 01:35:26.725
undo and it undercuts the economic foundations of the

1844
01:35:26.725 --> 01:35:29.125
empire in a really significant way and also creates

1845
01:35:29.125 --> 01:35:32.245
a precedent where the Genoese then start getting trade

1846
01:35:32.245 --> 01:35:35.564
privileges and everybody starts getting trade privileges. Um, BUT

1847
01:35:35.564 --> 01:35:38.444
the biggest mistake he makes is, uh, he invites

1848
01:35:38.444 --> 01:35:41.714
the Crusades to come through Roman territory. And the

1849
01:35:41.714 --> 01:35:44.765
initial idea that Alexius had for the Crusades was

1850
01:35:44.765 --> 01:35:49.270
to, um, use Western knights who are Really, really

1851
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:52.990
formidable, um, to go back through the territory in

1852
01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:55.750
Asia Minor that the Romans had lost, uh, in

1853
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:59.319
the later part of the 11th century. And, um,

1854
01:35:59.549 --> 01:36:02.629
the Crusaders are sold on something different. The Crusaders

1855
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:04.569
are sold on we're going to go to Jerusalem.

1856
01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:07.290
And so Alexius, I mean the Romans had not

1857
01:36:07.290 --> 01:36:10.709
controlled Jerusalem since the 600s, right? And they, they

1858
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:13.189
had no interest in going to Jerusalem. Um, AND

1859
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:15.390
so what they really wanted was a campaign through

1860
01:36:15.390 --> 01:36:18.160
what's now Turkey. Uh, AND the initial phase of

1861
01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:21.319
the crusade works that way, but eventually, as one

1862
01:36:21.319 --> 01:36:25.479
would expect, um, the Romans realized we cannot send

1863
01:36:25.479 --> 01:36:27.919
our troops alongside the Crusaders all the way to

1864
01:36:27.919 --> 01:36:32.299
Jerusalem. And so there's a break in, um, relations

1865
01:36:32.299 --> 01:36:34.549
and the Crusaders start getting this idea that the

1866
01:36:34.549 --> 01:36:39.319
Romans don't like the Crusaders. Um, All of these

1867
01:36:39.319 --> 01:36:43.339
things are manageable during the reign of Alexius, but

1868
01:36:43.339 --> 01:36:45.910
all of these things spin out of control. Alexius

1869
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:48.660
dies in 1118 and they spin out of control

1870
01:36:48.839 --> 01:36:52.160
during the reigns of his successors. Um, AND, and

1871
01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:54.640
yet those successors are very capable and so they

1872
01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:57.600
manage again this like house of cards pretty well.

1873
01:36:58.479 --> 01:37:01.330
But in 1180, uh, the last of those successful,

1874
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:07.270
capable successors dies. You have um a very incapable

1875
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:09.830
successor take over and then a series of civil

1876
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:12.910
wars and during those civil wars, all of these

1877
01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:16.709
entities start basically taking advantage of the hollowed out

1878
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:20.669
nature of Roman institutions and this culminates in 1204

1879
01:37:20.669 --> 01:37:24.250
with the Fourth Crusade, where the Crusaders intervene in

1880
01:37:24.339 --> 01:37:28.740
Another Roman civil war. Ultimately, they put a pretender,

1881
01:37:28.859 --> 01:37:30.299
they put an emperor in charge of the city

1882
01:37:30.299 --> 01:37:33.660
of Constantinople who promises them things he can't give

1883
01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:37.660
them. Um, AND they end up invading and capturing

1884
01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:41.240
the city of Constantinople, looting it, and then divvying

1885
01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:43.779
up the Roman Empire like it's a series of

1886
01:37:43.779 --> 01:37:48.200
fiefdoms. Um, AND there is a Roman resistance to

1887
01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:50.979
this in a number of places, right? The, um,

1888
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:53.799
Roman elite in the Balkans, they go to Epirus

1889
01:37:53.799 --> 01:37:56.200
and what's now sort of Western Greece. Um, THE

1890
01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:58.040
Roman elite in Asia Minor go to the city

1891
01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:01.870
of Mysa, uh, modern Iznik in, in Turkey. They

1892
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:06.350
fight resistance movements. Um, Epirus and Nicaea both set

1893
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:09.189
up their own Roman states. The city of Nicaea

1894
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:12.339
ultimately even comes back and takes Constantinople from the

1895
01:38:12.339 --> 01:38:15.310
Crusaders, but what the Crusaders had done was they

1896
01:38:15.310 --> 01:38:19.629
broke that structure. That citizenship structure, that sort of

1897
01:38:19.629 --> 01:38:23.149
common entity. Uh, AND there's a really remarkable letter

1898
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:26.750
that's written by um the Roman Emperor in 1203,

1899
01:38:27.089 --> 01:38:29.629
writing to the Pope and saying like basically call

1900
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:31.589
the Crusaders off, you know, that this is what

1901
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:33.990
they're doing is illegal. The Crusaders had said that,

1902
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:36.189
um, you know, that they have a right to

1903
01:38:36.189 --> 01:38:38.870
attack the city of Constantinople because they're looking to

1904
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:41.589
put in place the son of the emperor who

1905
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:43.709
had been deposed by the person who's now ruling

1906
01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:46.750
in Constantinople. And what the Roman emperor writes to

1907
01:38:46.750 --> 01:38:49.069
the Pope, he says, this is not how our

1908
01:38:49.069 --> 01:38:51.589
society works. Sons do not have a right to

1909
01:38:51.589 --> 01:38:54.990
succeed from their fathers. Um, WHAT we do instead

1910
01:38:54.990 --> 01:38:58.669
is we allocate power based on the, uh, representatives

1911
01:38:58.669 --> 01:39:02.870
of our citizen body. And the emperor rules through

1912
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:05.589
the consent and choice of those people. He doesn't

1913
01:39:05.589 --> 01:39:08.109
rule because he's the son of somebody. He rules

1914
01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:10.459
because they have chosen him. Um, AND what the

1915
01:39:10.459 --> 01:39:14.049
Crusaders do is they break that. And they actually

1916
01:39:14.049 --> 01:39:16.220
do even after they, they take the city, a

1917
01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:19.819
delegation of Roman notables comes to try to negotiate

1918
01:39:19.819 --> 01:39:22.279
terms and may well have been willing to give

1919
01:39:22.279 --> 01:39:26.580
the crusader king of, of Constantinople recognition, and they

1920
01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:28.859
send him away. Instead, they're going to do the

1921
01:39:28.859 --> 01:39:32.620
way Western do do Constantinople and the empire, what

1922
01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:36.060
Westerners do with territory they conquer. They're gonna divide

1923
01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:38.479
it up among all of the nobility in there.

1924
01:39:38.779 --> 01:39:39.939
And so this I think is the end of

1925
01:39:39.939 --> 01:39:43.339
the Roman state. Uh, BECAUSE in Constantinople, clearly what

1926
01:39:43.339 --> 01:39:46.140
follows the crusader capture is not a Roman state,

1927
01:39:46.299 --> 01:39:49.140
right? It is not connected to what Romulus or

1928
01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:51.740
whoever set up in the 8th century. What goes

1929
01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:54.740
on in Epirus, it is a Roman state, but

1930
01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:58.020
it is a successor state. It doesn't have the

1931
01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:02.009
institutional continuity. Um, IT doesn't claim that it is

1932
01:40:02.009 --> 01:40:04.089
anything more than kind of a resistance movement for

1933
01:40:04.089 --> 01:40:07.250
a few years. Um, AND what happens in Nicaea

1934
01:40:07.250 --> 01:40:10.330
also is only a partial group of representatives of

1935
01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:13.319
the Roman citizen body that ultimately appoints an emperor,

1936
01:40:13.330 --> 01:40:15.959
and they don't do it immediately either. And so

1937
01:40:15.959 --> 01:40:18.839
what you have um with the capture of Constantinople

1938
01:40:18.839 --> 01:40:22.200
is the breaking of that thread that links the

1939
01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.959
Roman state of the 13th century to the Roman

1940
01:40:24.959 --> 01:40:28.200
state of the 8th century. This doesn't end Roman

1941
01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:32.319
political history. The Romans running their own states for

1942
01:40:32.319 --> 01:40:36.000
another, um, you know, 200 and almost 260 years.

1943
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:40.229
But it ends that direct continuity. And I think

1944
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:43.950
that's, that's important, um, because I think that continuity

1945
01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:46.029
in a sense allows us to really focus on

1946
01:40:46.029 --> 01:40:49.390
why this Roman state matters because it tells us

1947
01:40:49.390 --> 01:40:51.549
something. You know, it tells us something that is

1948
01:40:51.549 --> 01:40:54.270
useful now. Um, AND so, you know, that, that

1949
01:40:54.270 --> 01:40:56.379
you can tell the history of the Roman people

1950
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:59.709
for another 700 years. Um, I mean there are

1951
01:40:59.709 --> 01:41:02.740
still people identifying as Romans living in islands in

1952
01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:06.700
the Aegean into the 1940s. Um, YOU know, when

1953
01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:09.899
the Greek state takes over the Aegean islands from

1954
01:41:09.899 --> 01:41:13.020
Italy, there are people when the Greeks show up

1955
01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:15.410
who talk about, I want to see the Greeks

1956
01:41:15.410 --> 01:41:17.740
show up because we are Romans, you know, this

1957
01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:22.470
is Still there in the 20th century. But those

1958
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:26.509
Romans are not connected to that state. So the

1959
01:41:26.509 --> 01:41:29.140
Roman, so you know I could continue, I could,

1960
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:30.589
you know, even write a second book that goes

1961
01:41:30.589 --> 01:41:33.660
the next 700 years of, of Romanness in the

1962
01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:36.830
Mediterranean. But again, I think that that lesson is

1963
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:39.229
different. Um, AND the reason that that matters to

1964
01:41:39.229 --> 01:41:41.750
us is different than focusing on the Roman state

1965
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:42.750
and its continuity.

1966
01:41:43.459 --> 01:41:47.580
Right, so I have one last question then. What

1967
01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:51.540
would you say were the factors behind the longevity

1968
01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:54.009
of Rome? I mean, in the book you talk,

1969
01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:58.140
for example, about the balance between change and tradition.

1970
01:41:58.339 --> 01:42:01.339
Could you tell us about that and what other

1971
01:42:01.339 --> 01:42:03.540
factors might have played a role here?

1972
01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:09.689
Yeah, I think, um, ultimately, There's something in the

1973
01:42:09.689 --> 01:42:14.270
DNA of this polity uh that makes it able

1974
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:17.290
to continue to evolve in a way that most

1975
01:42:17.290 --> 01:42:20.009
states struggle to do. You know, it's, it's a

1976
01:42:20.009 --> 01:42:24.979
state that reaches maturity, um, and is still able

1977
01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:28.879
to bring in new people comfortably. It's still able

1978
01:42:28.879 --> 01:42:31.160
to bring in new ideas. It's still able to

1979
01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:33.520
bring in new religions. It's still able to bring

1980
01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:36.200
in new practices. Um, BUT it does it in

1981
01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:38.629
a way where it never loses its sense of,

1982
01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:42.580
of how it got to be the powerful, um,

1983
01:42:42.669 --> 01:42:45.120
entity that it was. So, you know, so in

1984
01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.500
the United States, there, there is a lot of

1985
01:42:47.549 --> 01:42:49.560
conversation about what, what do we do with people

1986
01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:53.189
like George Washington. WHO um did immense things to

1987
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:55.790
build this country. But also, um, you know, we're

1988
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:57.720
slaveholders and, you know, and did things we might

1989
01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:00.759
be not comfortable with. For Romans what they would

1990
01:43:00.759 --> 01:43:04.779
say is You have to honor the contributions of

1991
01:43:04.779 --> 01:43:06.740
everybody who made this state great. You might not

1992
01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:09.939
agree with everything they did, and that's fine. You

1993
01:43:09.939 --> 01:43:13.000
know, you might have somebody from the Roman Republic

1994
01:43:13.419 --> 01:43:17.399
who is a pagan. OK, right, but they did

1995
01:43:17.399 --> 01:43:20.720
something important for us. So you have um authors

1996
01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.100
in the 11th century that will say things like,

1997
01:43:23.319 --> 01:43:26.560
this person was our Cato. Uh, AND, you know,

1998
01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:31.700
and Cato famously. Didn't like Greeks, really didn't like

1999
01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:35.140
Greeks. He didn't like Greek philosophy. He obviously was

2000
01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:37.779
not a Christian, right? Everything about this person in

2001
01:43:37.779 --> 01:43:42.220
the 11th century might be something that Cato would

2002
01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:46.700
disagree with, would actually, you know, criticize. But Cato

2003
01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:50.060
also represented important positive things for the Romans as

2004
01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:52.620
well. And so what Romans were able to do

2005
01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:56.169
is to say, you know, this entire legacy, um,

2006
01:43:56.379 --> 01:43:58.379
there are good and bad things in it. The

2007
01:43:58.379 --> 01:44:01.060
good still matters. We need to stay connected to

2008
01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:03.200
that good. We need to acknowledge that there's something

2009
01:44:03.339 --> 01:44:05.620
positive that we can take away from what these

2010
01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:07.779
people in the past did. We might not agree

2011
01:44:07.779 --> 01:44:11.629
with everything. But we need to acknowledge what they

2012
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:14.069
did because it was good for us as a

2013
01:44:14.069 --> 01:44:17.470
polity, and it's something that can help us now.

2014
01:44:17.549 --> 01:44:20.709
And if we disregard the sacrifices and choices they

2015
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:25.020
made, we are less able to make good choices

2016
01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:28.069
and sacrifices now. And so I think this is

2017
01:44:28.069 --> 01:44:30.029
the this is the secret of the Roman state,

2018
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:33.830
right? It is always grounded in a sense that

2019
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:37.359
we did things well. And we need to understand

2020
01:44:37.359 --> 01:44:39.700
what those were, and we need to keep doing

2021
01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:43.069
them, but we didn't do things perfectly. And if

2022
01:44:43.069 --> 01:44:45.520
there's a better way to do something or there's

2023
01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:47.600
somebody that we can bring in who is more

2024
01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:51.399
talented than what we have, we have always done

2025
01:44:51.399 --> 01:44:55.709
that. And that's important too. And you know, and

2026
01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:58.009
this I think is the secret. This is what

2027
01:44:58.009 --> 01:45:00.490
made Rome different and what makes Rome different from

2028
01:45:00.490 --> 01:45:03.089
a lot of modern societies too. Um, AND we

2029
01:45:03.089 --> 01:45:05.129
like to think modern societies are really good at,

2030
01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:08.410
at including people and, and they generally are. But

2031
01:45:08.410 --> 01:45:11.560
um, But what Rome was able to do was

2032
01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:14.600
include people and also retain that connection to what

2033
01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:17.500
it once was. That's the balance that a successful

2034
01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:21.640
long-standing society achieves, right? You, you always are able

2035
01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:24.919
to reinvigorate yourself with new ideas and new talents

2036
01:45:24.919 --> 01:45:27.120
and new approaches, but you don't lose your sense

2037
01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:30.189
of yourself either. Uh, AND this I think is

2038
01:45:30.189 --> 01:45:33.080
what we can see from Rome, right? You, if

2039
01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:35.229
you can do both of those things, You can

2040
01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:37.560
last for a really, really long time as a

2041
01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:42.910
society, and not just like Exist. You can thrive,

2042
01:45:43.330 --> 01:45:45.209
and you can thrive in a way that makes

2043
01:45:45.209 --> 01:45:48.250
the life of, I mean probably a billion people

2044
01:45:48.250 --> 01:45:51.109
over time, maybe more than that, lived as Romans.

2045
01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:54.129
You can make the life of those people better.

2046
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:57.029
By doing both of those things in a way

2047
01:45:57.029 --> 01:46:00.709
that is balanced, um, and that I think is

2048
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:03.870
a contribution that is timeless. Uh, AND that's a

2049
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:06.540
contribution that I think Rome alone allows us to

2050
01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:06.770
appreciate.

2051
01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:12.479
Great. So this has been a very fascinating conversation

2052
01:46:12.479 --> 01:46:14.640
about the Romans, and the book is again the

2053
01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:19.000
