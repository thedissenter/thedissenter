00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.859
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.809
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricard Lop, and

3
00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:09.170
today I'm joined by your return guest, Doctor Rebecca

4
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.569
Neuberger Goldstein. She's, of course, for people who don't

5
00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:16.729
know her, a philosopher, novelist, public intellectual, and today

6
00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:19.770
we're going to talk about her latest book, The

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.530
Mathering Instinct, How Our Deepest Longing Drives Us and

8
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.674
divides us, so. Dr. Goldstein, welcome back to the

9
00:00:27.674 --> 00:00:30.075
show. I mean, it's been 7 years, so

10
00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:35.514
7 years, yes, 7 long eventful years since I

11
00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:37.595
saw you last. Yes, yeah,

12
00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:41.255
we went through an entire pandemic, and,

13
00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:47.395
yes, yes, yes, and all sorts of world shattering.

14
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.360
Events,

15
00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:54.200
so yeah, which perhaps are somewhat relevant to the

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.590
matter we're going to talk about today. So uh

17
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.319
what actually matter, I mean it's interesting that I

18
00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:04.559
use that verb here. So what is it to

19
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.639
matter? What does it mean?

20
00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:09.519
Yeah, so, uh, of course we speak about. What

21
00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:13.599
matters, and we speak about who matters. Um, AND

22
00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:15.480
I think in both cases, if you get down

23
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.819
to its very core, it means to be deserving

24
00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.949
of attention. Uh, WHEN we say something doesn't matter,

25
00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:25.519
it's not deserving of attention. Uh, I, I think

26
00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:29.580
that's the basic core meaning, and, and I think

27
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.000
it opens to look at that definition, um, opens

28
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.220
the concept up. To how interesting it is because

29
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.199
that, I mean, attention is very interesting, yes, uh,

30
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.300
but deserving this term is, it's what philosophers call

31
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.209
a normative term. It involves norms of justification. It

32
00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:03.019
involves justification. It involves values, deservingness. So, yeah, when

33
00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:08.690
we're saying that something matters, we are. Invoking norms

34
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.339
of justification, values. And that's the kind of creatures

35
00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.589
we are. We are creatures of matter who belong

36
00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:18.860
to matter. I think that gets at the very

37
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.470
essence of us, uh, and, uh, shows why we

38
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.350
are so very different from the other animals with

39
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.589
which we share this planet, not very well, um.

40
00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.500
We don't share it. We don't respect other animals

41
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.330
very, very much. We, it's hard enough to get

42
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.199
us to respect all humans, but in any case,

43
00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.940
that really shows the sort of normative core of

44
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.399
us.

45
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.589
Mhm. And why do you call mattering an instinct?

46
00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.990
I mean, do you look at it as something

47
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.910
that has evolved, that is part of our evolved

48
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.100
psychology? Yeah,

49
00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:58.949
I do, and I, I take it back to

50
00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:05.110
the very basic laws of nature, which is physics.

51
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.979
I started out in physics. It's been a long

52
00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.990
road away from physics, and I have always, when

53
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.229
I was an under since I was an undergraduate,

54
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.619
then Obsessed with the second law of thermodynamics, law

55
00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:23.039
that says we are all tending towards everything, everything

56
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.800
in the universe, the universe itself is tending towards

57
00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:34.619
disorder, randomness, exhaustion, um, and I thought even, you

58
00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:37.300
know, as a, as a student of, of, of

59
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.399
physics, wow, this somehow has some sort of Human

60
00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.199
dimension to it, right? And, and it, and it

61
00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.800
does. That's one of the things I'm trying to

62
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.259
solve, um, in, in the, uh, in this book,

63
00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:00.440
but because, um, entropy means, uh, literally, uh, transformation

64
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.839
from within. And what it says is that in

65
00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:06.699
a closed system, meaning one that doesn't have recourse

66
00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:11.360
to external sources of energy, um, in a closed

67
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:19.898
system, um, the entropy. Increases, uh, until it reaches,

68
00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.319
uh, equilibrium in which no work can be done,

69
00:04:24.438 --> 00:04:27.158
nothing can be done, and that's the direction of

70
00:04:27.158 --> 00:04:34.149
everything, sadly, but We living systems are not closed

71
00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:38.010
systems. We living organisms, being a closed system is

72
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.730
not compatible with life. We have recourse to external

73
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.829
energy in the form of food, uh, low entropy,

74
00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:52.570
uh, food, and, uh, and, and light, um, and

75
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.850
that's how we can do the work of resisting

76
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.869
entropy and all. The laws of biology, um, are

77
00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:08.519
derived, as the great physicist Erwin Schrodinger wrote in

78
00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:13.179
What Is Life. They're all derived from this resistance

79
00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:17.890
to entropy. That's the business of life. Viva la

80
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.440
resistance, right? We are, that's what, that's what life

81
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.769
is. So. Um, WHAT this means, um, is that

82
00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:34.730
we all evolved every living thing from the bacteria

83
00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:38.970
to us, you know, us complicated creatures, um, have

84
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.570
evolved to take our own. Perpetuation, our own survival,

85
00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:48.720
our own flourishing as fundamental. This is, we, we're

86
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.970
devoted to this, and we creatures who have evolved

87
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.529
attention, spend the bulk of our attention on ourselves,

88
00:05:58.609 --> 00:06:02.179
on the environment, and how it relates to us.

89
00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:07.359
We have evolved to feel ourselves automatically by default,

90
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.630
by nature, by biology, by the deepest. Organizing principle

91
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.450
of all the instincts to feel ourselves to be

92
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.489
deserving of attention, like nothing else in the world

93
00:06:19.489 --> 00:06:23.209
is. So that has evolved in us, but something

94
00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:26.489
else has also evolved in us, and only us,

95
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:33.500
which is with these complicated big Energy, hungry, greedy

96
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.690
brains of ours, um, because they have to be

97
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.760
so ordered, and it takes so much energy to

98
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.359
fight the entropy that keeps our brains ordered. We

99
00:06:44.359 --> 00:06:49.200
have evolved the capacity for self-reflection. That's another capacity

100
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.700
that we have evolved. When you put these two

101
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.540
things together, are paying so much attention to ourselves

102
00:06:57.869 --> 00:07:01.910
and our ability to step outside of ourselves in

103
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.410
this evolved capacity for self-reflection, and look at ourselves

104
00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:09.269
and see how much attention we pay to ourselves,

105
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.350
how much attention we feel ourselves to be deserving

106
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.130
of, the question arises in us, the existential question.

107
00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:21.350
Why am I deserving of all of this? Why

108
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.179
do I feel that I matter so much? There's

109
00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:30.100
such a gap, unless we're a lunatic, some of

110
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.980
whom are right now in power in our world,

111
00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:35.459
unless you are such a lunatic that you think

112
00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:38.320
you are the most important thing in the whole

113
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.079
world, um. For those of us who are less

114
00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:46.429
than who are not lunatics, we ask, how do

115
00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:49.429
I justify this, and we want to get to

116
00:07:49.429 --> 00:07:58.890
work improving ourselves somewhat more deserving, worthy, earning, um,

117
00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:01.170
this attention that we have to pay to ourselves.

118
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:04.619
I compare it to, you know, we have, I

119
00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:06.709
don't know, this is true all over the world,

120
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:12.450
but we have in our universities, um. Certain students

121
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.970
that we call legacy students, they're gonna get in,

122
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:18.640
their parents gave a lot of money. And they're,

123
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.179
they're gonna get in whether they deserve it or

124
00:08:21.179 --> 00:08:25.420
not. I've had, I've had some students, legacy students,

125
00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:29.720
some of them work their little butts off to

126
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.640
get in on their own merits. It's, it's guaranteed

127
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.359
they're gonna get in, their parents' money is going

128
00:08:35.359 --> 00:08:38.400
to get them in, but that's, that's not what

129
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.880
they want for their own self-respect, they want to

130
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.729
earn their admittance. That's what we're like. By default,

131
00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:49.530
we're gonna pay ourselves tremendous amount of attention. We

132
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.150
have to in order to pursue our complicated lives.

133
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.450
Um, THERE'S something called the, um, default network mode

134
00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.150
when we're not paying attention to anything out there.

135
00:09:00.969 --> 00:09:04.809
What are we paying attention to ourselves? We're fantasizing,

136
00:09:04.929 --> 00:09:09.390
we're remembering, we're wishing, we're It's, it's ourselves. So

137
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:14.109
to see this, um, and is to want to

138
00:09:14.109 --> 00:09:17.989
rationalize it, to justify it, that gives rise to

139
00:09:17.989 --> 00:09:19.909
what I call the mannering instincts. So it's sort

140
00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:25.659
of The collision or the joining together of two

141
00:09:25.659 --> 00:09:29.460
evolved instincts. Right, yeah,

142
00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:31.250
yeah, yes, it makes sense,

143
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.440
but, yeah,

144
00:09:32.969 --> 00:09:36.369
but let me ask you then, because um I

145
00:09:36.369 --> 00:09:39.429
mean, do you agree that er when it comes

146
00:09:39.429 --> 00:09:44.650
to mattering for us as humans, it's not mattering

147
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:50.169
in a sort of er absolutely individualistic and atomized

148
00:09:50.169 --> 00:09:52.893
manner, right? I mean we care about mattering to

149
00:09:53.143 --> 00:09:55.523
other people as well, and we care about our

150
00:09:55.523 --> 00:09:58.763
social standing and we care about how we matter

151
00:09:58.763 --> 00:10:02.242
to the people we have relationships with because of

152
00:10:02.242 --> 00:10:06.802
course, uh as uh as people like Joe Henry,

153
00:10:06.992 --> 00:10:10.922
Karen Orenz Zion, and Stephen Hein coined the term

154
00:10:10.922 --> 00:10:13.002
weird, I mean, we in the West tend to

155
00:10:13.002 --> 00:10:16.106
live in. In these weird societies right where we

156
00:10:16.106 --> 00:10:19.916
care a lot, a lot about our, our individualism,

157
00:10:19.955 --> 00:10:24.466
but actually it's not just about us as individuals,

158
00:10:24.515 --> 00:10:29.796
it's it's, it's also about um our relation to

159
00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:33.546
other people and our social standing as well.

160
00:10:34.226 --> 00:10:38.729
Yeah, absolutely, so. Uh, YOU know, Freud had said

161
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:43.979
that the two cornerstones of humanness are love and

162
00:10:43.979 --> 00:10:49.400
work. Now I would say I would. Amend this

163
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.570
somewhat. There are two cornerstones of our well-being, our

164
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:58.530
flourishing, deep down motives without which We feel that

165
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.719
our lives are not going well. One is, uh,

166
00:11:01.729 --> 00:11:06.570
what the social psychologists call belonging or connectedness, that

167
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.330
there are people who you regard as in your

168
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:15.289
life, um, and that they will pay you special

169
00:11:15.289 --> 00:11:17.549
attention, whether you deserve it or not. I mean,

170
00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:20.375
this is certainly how I feel about My family,

171
00:11:20.594 --> 00:11:23.234
you know, I will pay them attention, whether they

172
00:11:23.234 --> 00:11:25.315
deserve it or not, and my friends, so that's

173
00:11:25.315 --> 00:11:26.914
sort of what it is to be a friend,

174
00:11:27.155 --> 00:11:30.155
you know, one's one's one's lovers, one's one's spouse,

175
00:11:30.234 --> 00:11:34.465
one's family, one's, you know, maybe one's colleagues, one's

176
00:11:34.465 --> 00:11:39.155
community, one's neighbors, whatever, people who are in your

177
00:11:39.155 --> 00:11:44.020
life, and without that, Um, you know, and, and

178
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.669
you may not love them. I would, you know,

179
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.969
I think Freud's word love is a little too,

180
00:11:48.549 --> 00:11:51.109
um, specific. No, I mean, they may drive you

181
00:11:51.109 --> 00:11:55.150
mad, but they are in your life, and, and

182
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.210
you, you have this connection to them, and you,

183
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.130
you matter to them, and maybe they even matter

184
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.869
to you, which is the way it ought to

185
00:12:02.869 --> 00:12:08.119
be, but isn't always. So that's connectedness, right? And

186
00:12:08.849 --> 00:12:10.809
But there is this other, and it has to

187
00:12:10.809 --> 00:12:15.049
do with our relationships with others, uh, and it

188
00:12:15.049 --> 00:12:17.729
can also be put in the terms of mattering,

189
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.400
and also when I talk about mattering, that's what

190
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.479
people assume I'm talking about. No, I'm talking about

191
00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:26.190
this other thing that is also A deep motive.

192
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.140
Freud says work, and that shows you a lot

193
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.900
about how he went about trying to satisfy his

194
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:37.650
mannering in by way of his intellectual work, um,

195
00:12:38.059 --> 00:12:41.780
but there are many ways that people have in

196
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:46.320
order to feel, uh, In order to do right

197
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.549
by not their relationship with others, but their relationship

198
00:12:49.549 --> 00:12:53.710
with themselves, you know, this, this sort of existential

199
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.150
moment that I think we all go through, maybe

200
00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:00.299
particularly when we're adolescents or early adulthood, or but

201
00:13:00.299 --> 00:13:02.030
for some of us over and over again, we

202
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.590
need convincing again and again that we truly matter.

203
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.349
I certainly belong to that group, but, um, that

204
00:13:08.349 --> 00:13:10.719
we have to convince ourselves that we are deserving,

205
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.580
deserving of our own attention. Um, THAT, that we

206
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.059
care so much about ourselves. What, why should I,

207
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.219
you know, what, what makes me deserving of all

208
00:13:20.219 --> 00:13:26.190
of this? If I would Um, uh, Estimate the

209
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.119
size of something by how much attention I give

210
00:13:29.119 --> 00:13:32.239
it. If that's, if, if that's the, the uh

211
00:13:32.239 --> 00:13:35.380
measure of how much something matters, it would seem,

212
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.859
and it seems that way to each of us,

213
00:13:38.159 --> 00:13:39.719
that the thing we think matters the most in

214
00:13:39.719 --> 00:13:42.719
the universe is ourselves, given all the attention that

215
00:13:42.719 --> 00:13:45.640
we give it. And that is, that causes a

216
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.780
deep unease, and we try to go about making

217
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.289
All the attention we give ourselves more commensurate with

218
00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.309
who we are. We go about it in such

219
00:13:56.309 --> 00:13:59.270
different ways. Freud, yes, work. I'm also of that

220
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.950
sort, work, yes, yes, I have to be working

221
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.299
constantly, um, but, and which is not to say

222
00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:07.909
that the connectedness is not important. The connectedness is

223
00:14:07.909 --> 00:14:10.909
always, that's a given, we are gregarious creatures evolved

224
00:14:10.909 --> 00:14:13.750
from gregarious creatures. We can explain that very, very

225
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.250
well. There's this other thing, this other existential need,

226
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:21.510
um, and I divide. So I think we're all

227
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.570
alike in this, that we need this, um. And

228
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.530
then I, I, there, I divide us into four

229
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:34.489
different groups according to which our strategies, uh, for

230
00:14:34.489 --> 00:14:38.729
trying to go about realizing this, this mattering, this

231
00:14:38.729 --> 00:14:40.409
longing to matter. We're creatures.

232
00:14:40.489 --> 00:14:44.849
So that's the socializers, the transcenders, the competitors, and

233
00:14:44.849 --> 00:14:47.530
the heroic, the heroic strivers,

234
00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:47.840
right?

235
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.179
Yeah,

236
00:14:48.489 --> 00:14:50.409
and I, so I have been talking to people

237
00:14:50.409 --> 00:14:53.010
about this ever since my first book, which was

238
00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:57.000
published in 1983. And I laid out this, this

239
00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.309
mattering thing, and it was really to try to

240
00:14:59.309 --> 00:15:01.340
understand my main character who is very different from

241
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.400
me, and my editor said, uh, why is she

242
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.320
so unhappy? And I said, oh, why is she

243
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.599
so unhappy? She feels like she doesn't matter. And

244
00:15:07.599 --> 00:15:11.299
that got me thinking since 1983 about this thing,

245
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.039
and I have just been, I talked to people

246
00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:16.080
about this all the time. Most of my conversations

247
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.479
are about this. You sit next to me on

248
00:15:17.479 --> 00:15:20.400
a bus, you're gonna start, we're gonna start talking

249
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.039
about May. I wanna hear how you go about

250
00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:28.359
it. I've never met anybody yet. It's different as

251
00:15:28.359 --> 00:15:31.219
the people I've been speaking to over these past

252
00:15:31.219 --> 00:15:35.700
over 40 years, who didn't fit into one of

253
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.500
these four categories. We can change them, uh, the

254
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.000
transcenders, the socializers, the heroic drivers, and the competitors.

255
00:15:44.739 --> 00:15:49.500
But so far, everyone I've spoken to, read about,

256
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.099
I read a lot of biographies, please it's fit

257
00:15:52.099 --> 00:15:54.849
into these. So should I explain? What they are,

258
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:59.530
yeah, yeah, so, um, yeah, so I just want

259
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:04.030
to make sure that it's, it's somewhat empirical. Not

260
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.549
formally, you know, I'm, and I'm open to counterexamples,

261
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.789
right, and, and, and falsification, but this is what

262
00:16:11.789 --> 00:16:15.030
I have found. Um, SO the transgenders are, are

263
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:21.190
those who want cosmic mattering, um, they want to

264
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.059
feel that they were created for a particular, that

265
00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:29.354
they were created by a particular purpose by A

266
00:16:29.354 --> 00:16:33.135
metaphysical transcendent being, whether they call it God or

267
00:16:33.474 --> 00:16:36.765
something vague or, you know, Atman, whatever, you know,

268
00:16:37.065 --> 00:16:41.794
whatever, something trans empirical that created the laws of

269
00:16:41.794 --> 00:16:46.315
nature, created perhaps the laws of morality to and

270
00:16:46.315 --> 00:16:52.380
who created them purposefully. Intentionally, so that they actually

271
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.460
have a role to play in the narrative of

272
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:58.099
eternity. There is no greater sense of mannering than

273
00:16:58.099 --> 00:17:00.900
that, you know, I, I'm, I am not a

274
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:06.660
transcender, but I recognize and I respect, respect as

275
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.410
a manifestation of the longing to matter. Transcenders, uh,

276
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.010
those who go about it in this way. Um,

277
00:17:15.348 --> 00:17:15.358
uh,

278
00:17:15.489 --> 00:17:19.848
DO you, would you include, uh, religious people, ascetics,

279
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.618
and people like that among the transcenders?

280
00:17:22.729 --> 00:17:26.290
Yes, and you know, anybody who thinks, um, that

281
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:30.599
our reason for living, you know, for, for, for.

282
00:17:30.655 --> 00:17:35.405
Existence, um, it, it is, has something to do

283
00:17:35.405 --> 00:17:38.974
with the nature of the cosmos in general, that

284
00:17:38.974 --> 00:17:41.775
our, our mattering is out there in some sense,

285
00:17:41.854 --> 00:17:44.444
you know, and we have to recognize that, of

286
00:17:44.444 --> 00:17:50.300
course, transcenders recognize many different forms of this. Hence,

287
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.219
you know, they just can disagree with each other

288
00:17:53.219 --> 00:17:57.359
sometimes very bloodily, right? Religious wars, jihads, crusades, all

289
00:17:57.359 --> 00:18:00.880
these things, right? But, um, this, you gotta give

290
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.800
it to them in terms of, in terms of

291
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.560
mattering, short of, short of lunacy and short of

292
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.890
thinking that you yourself are transcendent, you know, um,

293
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.599
um. This is a very, very satisfactory, and so,

294
00:18:15.609 --> 00:18:17.910
so many of the religious people I, I talked

295
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.189
to or spiritual, you know, it doesn't have to

296
00:18:20.189 --> 00:18:23.390
be the conventional religions, um, will say to me,

297
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.589
you know, since I'm not, I don't have such

298
00:18:25.589 --> 00:18:27.869
a metaphysical belief, what gets you out of bed

299
00:18:27.869 --> 00:18:29.849
in the morning? What, what, what, how do you

300
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.750
proceed with your life? How do you know what's

301
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.900
right? How, what, what's wrong? You know, this is

302
00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.400
One of the things I, I say in the

303
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.369
book is, yeah, the transcenders tend to universalize, but

304
00:18:42.369 --> 00:18:44.489
so do other people as well. We'll, we'll get

305
00:18:44.489 --> 00:18:46.530
to that. Let me just talk about these other,

306
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.449
which ones should I do next? Socializers, heroics, yeah,

307
00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.839
let's perhaps do the socializers.

308
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:56.469
Yeah, socialize. I have found in my informal discussions,

309
00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.290
most people seem to be socializers. That is, they

310
00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.650
collapse this connectedness, uh, them, you know, with, well,

311
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.650
I should say that. The most, most of the

312
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.859
people I talked to, I'm take that back, most

313
00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:12.219
of the people I talked to tend to think

314
00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:16.300
of mattering in terms of mattering to others. Um,

315
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.609
IT may be mattering to those others who are

316
00:19:19.609 --> 00:19:22.459
in their lives, you know, the, the family, the

317
00:19:22.459 --> 00:19:26.380
friends, the lovers, the colleagues, neighbors, whatever, or it

318
00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.180
may be perfect strangers, like the need, the need

319
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.400
for fame, the longing for fame to matter to.

320
00:19:33.319 --> 00:19:36.859
Hordes of strangers, um, you know, to be beginning

321
00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:40.439
to be feeling that you're deserving of attention of

322
00:19:40.439 --> 00:19:42.800
all of these people can make you feel like,

323
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.400
yes, you are deserving of your own attention, you

324
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.939
know, if, if, if all the world is is

325
00:19:47.989 --> 00:19:51.410
is waiting to see. What I eat for breakfast

326
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.119
or who my next romantic partner is or whatever

327
00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:57.829
the hell, you know, um, yeah, then, then, then

328
00:19:57.829 --> 00:20:01.250
I must matter. I, I found it's really interesting.

329
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.130
It, um, there's, there are actually studies that show

330
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:08.770
that, um, the, the desire for fame has really

331
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.209
grown, um, and that, that's very interesting, and we

332
00:20:12.209 --> 00:20:14.530
can talk about that, uh, but, you know, the

333
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.530
younger generation. Uh, A certain, uh, questionnaires have shown

334
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.209
that they would be willing to do all sorts

335
00:20:21.209 --> 00:20:23.829
of things, have no romantic partner, not have children.

336
00:20:24.339 --> 00:20:26.109
You know, move to another place if they can

337
00:20:26.109 --> 00:20:29.790
be famous. So, so, but that is the mattering

338
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:32.900
to others. Um, YOU may want to dominate the

339
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.219
others, it's, it's not necessarily wholesome. Um,

340
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.270
SO do you think that perhaps people who post

341
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.589
too much on social media are socializers?

342
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.189
Yes, and, and you do, you get a certain

343
00:20:45.189 --> 00:20:47.310
something. I, I used to tweet because, you know,

344
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.189
my publisher said, oh, you have, you're not on

345
00:20:49.189 --> 00:20:51.910
social media at all, you gotta, you, you gotta

346
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.660
get on there. And I used to tweet, and

347
00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.199
I remember it, you know, when people paid attention

348
00:20:56.199 --> 00:20:57.979
to me in that way, you know, when they

349
00:20:57.979 --> 00:21:01.199
liked it or retweeted, I would feel a little

350
00:21:01.619 --> 00:21:05.390
something, not much, cause that's not my That's not

351
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.229
my way of trying to matter, but, but yeah,

352
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:12.229
it does make you feel something good. People who

353
00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:15.130
live for fame tend not to actually be so

354
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:19.750
very happy often. Um, AND that's interesting too. Um,

355
00:21:20.119 --> 00:21:22.739
I was going to say that is actually interesting

356
00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:26.959
because, uh, many of, for example, the ancient philosophers

357
00:21:26.959 --> 00:21:30.439
and some of the more modern ones, uh, actually

358
00:21:30.439 --> 00:21:35.680
warned against uh caring for fame or putting fame

359
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.060
on a high pedestal.

360
00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:41.459
Exactly, it's, it, it, it's a very unstable kind

361
00:21:41.459 --> 00:21:45.760
of grounding for your mattering to me, this constant

362
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.150
attention from. Um, FROM, from strangers, that's basically what

363
00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:54.219
it means to, to, uh, to on fame, and,

364
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.469
um, and, you know, and it's, it's, it's, it's,

365
00:21:56.569 --> 00:21:59.479
it's unstable and the, and, and these crowds are

366
00:21:59.479 --> 00:22:01.790
fickle, and it can drive you to do crazy

367
00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:05.030
things. There's a Wikipedia page that is devoted to

368
00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:10.099
all the deaths of people who did outrageously crazy

369
00:22:10.099 --> 00:22:13.780
things in order to You know, go viral. You

370
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.819
know, people climbing, do nutty things, you know, and

371
00:22:16.819 --> 00:22:19.979
it's, yeah, but it really, this is a form

372
00:22:19.979 --> 00:22:24.219
that the longing to matter can take, and anyway,

373
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.239
so socializers, um,

374
00:22:26.579 --> 00:22:28.300
how about the competitors

375
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:33.300
then? Competitors are interesting, and that's sense they are

376
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.660
really people who feel that mattering is zero-sum. They,

377
00:22:37.739 --> 00:22:41.390
they, they, they. To, to the extent that they

378
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:43.750
feel that they matter, they have to feel that

379
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.069
they matter more than others. And, and for some

380
00:22:47.069 --> 00:22:49.949
of them, can I, can I mention a, a

381
00:22:49.949 --> 00:22:54.589
political figure? Sure. Our very own president here in

382
00:22:54.589 --> 00:22:59.300
the United States. I mean, he had, he's in

383
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:03.459
competition with everybody. He, he has to prove he's

384
00:23:03.459 --> 00:23:07.439
better than everybody in everything, except for his own

385
00:23:07.859 --> 00:23:10.939
flesh and blood who are regarded as extensions of

386
00:23:10.939 --> 00:23:14.500
themselves, or his lackeys, you know, but he, he

387
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.819
is, you know, he is such a an out

388
00:23:19.819 --> 00:23:25.300
there picture of the extreme competitive. Sometimes competitors can

389
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.449
seem like The next group that I'm gonna talk

390
00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:33.089
about, heroic strivers, um, and I'll just say briefly

391
00:23:33.089 --> 00:23:36.089
what they are, they are, uh, people who, they're

392
00:23:36.089 --> 00:23:39.890
not trying to impress other people, uh, they are

393
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.810
really, it's, it's all about they have certain standards

394
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:49.329
of excellence, um, could be intellectual, artistic. Athletic, um,

395
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:53.449
or ethical, right, um, that they have to meet

396
00:23:53.449 --> 00:23:55.130
in order to be able to live with themselves

397
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:59.069
in order to have this relationship with themselves of

398
00:23:59.069 --> 00:24:06.709
mattering, um, and, um. I, back to competitors, so

399
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:12.310
there's a scientist, I know, very Good scientist, he

400
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.589
got a Nobel Prize, as a matter of fact,

401
00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:19.069
and another friend of mine who knows the scientists

402
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.469
said to me about him, said he was happy

403
00:24:22.469 --> 00:24:25.390
for all of 15 minutes when he got that

404
00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.790
call from Stockholm, and then he remembered that other

405
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.849
people have, have gotten Nobel Prizes also. He was

406
00:24:32.849 --> 00:24:37.500
no longer happy. So, you know, competitors can, you

407
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.140
know, they, they can do the amazing things that

408
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.939
heroic strivers do, but in terms of their own

409
00:24:43.939 --> 00:24:48.219
mattering, it's adversarial, um, and, and, and so the

410
00:24:48.219 --> 00:24:51.810
inner being of them. It is very, is, is

411
00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.369
very different. I think it's very hard to be

412
00:24:53.369 --> 00:24:55.640
a competitor. You can never rest on your laurels,

413
00:24:55.729 --> 00:25:00.010
not even Nobel, not like Nobel laurels, right? It's

414
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:03.359
just incredible. You're always, and, and it's, it's, it's,

415
00:25:03.369 --> 00:25:07.650
uh, it really tends to distance your, your, yourself

416
00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.540
from other people. Everybody is potential, unless maybe your

417
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.209
own flesh and blood or, you know, those you

418
00:25:12.209 --> 00:25:15.619
can regard as extensions to yourself. It's your competitor.

419
00:25:15.689 --> 00:25:17.410
It's, it's, it's not a great way to live.

420
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.280
Anyway, but, you know, so it's interesting, you know,

421
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:25.130
why we fall out one way or the other,

422
00:25:25.329 --> 00:25:29.160
um, but, but we do. Um, IT can change.

423
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.689
I started life as a transcendent, that's the way

424
00:25:31.689 --> 00:25:35.839
I was brought up. But I, I, it didn't

425
00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:39.489
suit me. I, I couldn't do it. It didn't

426
00:25:39.569 --> 00:25:42.359
hit the sweet spot at all, and, um, and,

427
00:25:42.439 --> 00:25:45.020
and so I, you know, my own nature came

428
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.880
out. So, you know, it's, I think it's temperament,

429
00:25:46.939 --> 00:25:51.719
talent, interest, culture, to some extent, um, but somehow

430
00:25:51.719 --> 00:25:54.079
or other we fall out in these very different

431
00:25:54.079 --> 00:25:57.300
ways. So the very thing that makes us human,

432
00:25:57.959 --> 00:26:01.729
so human, so uniquely human. Drives us apart, you

433
00:26:01.729 --> 00:26:04.750
know, so makes us live lives that are so

434
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.310
different to the extent that we can be completely

435
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:11.869
baffled, amused, and appalled by one another. It usually

436
00:26:11.869 --> 00:26:14.229
goes back to the manner and instinct and how

437
00:26:14.229 --> 00:26:15.229
we're realizing it.

438
00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:19.459
So, I, I mean, where would you include, uh,

439
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.339
intellectuals? I mean, do you think that being an

440
00:26:22.339 --> 00:26:26.180
intellectual and caring about a truth with a capital

441
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.390
T involves at least some degree of transcendence?

442
00:26:31.469 --> 00:26:35.069
You know, it depends. Yeah, not transcendence in the

443
00:26:35.069 --> 00:26:39.189
way that I'm using transcenders, you know, the way

444
00:26:39.189 --> 00:26:42.550
I'm using transcenders, it really does require this metaphysical

445
00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:47.829
belief. Um, BUT there, you know, if you are,

446
00:26:48.229 --> 00:26:52.369
if you think of, as, as many heroic strivers

447
00:26:52.369 --> 00:26:55.969
do, think of your, what I call your mattering

448
00:26:55.969 --> 00:27:00.180
project. Um, THE thing that gets you out of

449
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.030
bed in the morning and, you know, and, and,

450
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.140
and to work. Um, IF you think of it

451
00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:09.880
in terms of such ideals as truth, um, or

452
00:27:10.319 --> 00:27:16.010
Um, or justice, um, or, you know, these, these

453
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.130
ideals, these abstract ideals, in some sense, there's a

454
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:22.609
kind of transcendence, yes, you, there is in that

455
00:27:22.609 --> 00:27:25.449
sense, kind of platonic sense, yes, there's that kind

456
00:27:25.449 --> 00:27:29.660
of, yes, transcendence. This is something bigger than me,

457
00:27:29.859 --> 00:27:34.890
um, truth, justice, uh, courage, you know, whatever, you

458
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:39.910
know, human excellence, it's, it's, it's somehow it's. However

459
00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.709
you think about it, um, yeah, it's something bigger

460
00:27:42.709 --> 00:27:46.890
than Do you think, yeah, do you,

461
00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:51.699
do you think that cosmic mattering and for example

462
00:27:51.699 --> 00:27:56.420
when we as humans attribute some er degree uh

463
00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.900
or we think that we are special in comparison.

464
00:28:00.369 --> 00:28:06.410
TO other animals special biologically or special in a

465
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.800
more creationist manner if you are a religious person.

466
00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:13.449
Do you think that those kinds of mattering involve

467
00:28:13.449 --> 00:28:15.890
at least some degree of delusion?

468
00:28:16.609 --> 00:28:19.949
Delusion, well, you know, I think in some sense.

469
00:28:21.079 --> 00:28:25.109
Maybe you'll call me delusional. I think there is

470
00:28:25.109 --> 00:28:29.390
a sense in which we are, our species is

471
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:36.150
very special, that, um, we, like all creatures are

472
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:41.089
driven to, you know, devote all our energy to

473
00:28:41.229 --> 00:28:45.750
basically ourselves. We, you know, that's Uh, the organizing

474
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:50.910
principle of all the instincts, um, but unlike the

475
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:58.329
other creatures, Who had their own dignity. Um, I

476
00:28:58.329 --> 00:29:01.510
take animals very seriously. I'm a true animal lover,

477
00:29:01.849 --> 00:29:08.439
um, but Uh, we have this need to justify.

478
00:29:10.469 --> 00:29:16.329
This, this, you know, our own biologically given, uh,

479
00:29:16.949 --> 00:29:20.910
drives, and that is, yeah, I, I really do

480
00:29:21.069 --> 00:29:22.939
think that, you know, people talk about the intrinsic

481
00:29:22.939 --> 00:29:25.589
dignity of humans and what does that mean? It's

482
00:29:25.589 --> 00:29:27.910
so vague. I never understood what that meant. I

483
00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:31.030
think we are vaguely gesturing towards this. There's something

484
00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:34.300
dignified about this, even in the worst of us,

485
00:29:34.349 --> 00:29:37.839
and we have so many specimens on display. Uh,

486
00:29:38.099 --> 00:29:42.219
THAT there is something about it, you know, that

487
00:29:42.219 --> 00:29:46.699
feeling the need to justify, uh, your, your own

488
00:29:46.699 --> 00:29:49.020
self, your own existence, your own identity, because your

489
00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:56.359
identity is basically constituted of this. Striving to perpetuate,

490
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.489
uh, one's own survival and, and, and, and flourishing,

491
00:29:59.699 --> 00:30:02.599
and we think, yeah, what makes me worth this?

492
00:30:02.849 --> 00:30:05.180
Um, WHAT do I have to prove to myself

493
00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:09.750
about myself, uh, that would make Me deserving of

494
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:13.790
this. Um, EVEN if you decide the worst way,

495
00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:16.760
power over others, you know, I'm going to matter

496
00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.770
by marching into Ukraine or whatever, right? Um, TERRIBLE

497
00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.750
ways of going about it, um, and we need

498
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:29.550
a standard to, um, adjudicate between good and bad

499
00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.900
ways of And I tried to try to answer

500
00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:37.150
that as well, but There is something, there is

501
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:41.430
something estimable, um, in our species, that, that we

502
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.670
are normative, uh, that we are seeking values, even

503
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.910
if we end up with very bad values, that

504
00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:49.949
there is something there. But, so I don't think

505
00:30:49.949 --> 00:30:54.619
it's delusional. I think there is something. To this,

506
00:30:54.709 --> 00:30:58.510
that there is an intrinsic dignity, uh, to human

507
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:01.530
beings because of this, because of the normative dimension,

508
00:31:02.189 --> 00:31:06.680
um, that we That we encompass matter longing to

509
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.660
matter. That's what we are, matter longing to matter,

510
00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:15.579
and um that is something, but Animals, you know,

511
00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:19.469
animals don't gain their dignity by being similar to

512
00:31:19.469 --> 00:31:23.550
us. That is arrogant. That is anthro, you know,

513
00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:24.170
anthro

514
00:31:24.459 --> 00:31:25.849
arrogant anthropocentric,

515
00:31:26.229 --> 00:31:31.849
yes, um, but, um. They, they gain their dignity

516
00:31:31.849 --> 00:31:34.569
on their own terms, um, and, and we, and

517
00:31:34.569 --> 00:31:38.329
we ought to recognize that. But yes, there is

518
00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:41.880
something, there is something special I would say about,

519
00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:45.479
uh, you know, because of this capacity, these big

520
00:31:45.479 --> 00:31:51.599
brains, capacity for self-reflection. We become value seekers. We

521
00:31:51.599 --> 00:31:54.119
bring values into this world. That's something.

522
00:31:55.489 --> 00:31:58.819
So you're a philosopher, what do you think is

523
00:31:58.819 --> 00:32:04.530
the role, if any, that philosophy can play er

524
00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:07.290
in our mattering?

525
00:32:08.699 --> 00:32:14.369
Well, huh. Um, I mean, philosophy is a wonderful

526
00:32:15.109 --> 00:32:21.310
subject. It's, uh, some people, that's how they, uh,

527
00:32:21.469 --> 00:32:24.790
pursue their mattering, you know, it's an intellectual endeavor,

528
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:30.900
right? Um, I think it's, but I think. You

529
00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.540
know, and I, for most of my life, I

530
00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.819
have to confess I was interested in very little

531
00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:38.260
technical problems in philosophy. I came to philosophy from

532
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.180
the sciences, from math and physics. I was interested

533
00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:50.339
in solvable technical, um, problems, um, but, um, I

534
00:32:50.339 --> 00:32:56.300
think much of philosophy is Devoted to problems, um,

535
00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.420
like values, that this sort of thing, um, that

536
00:33:00.989 --> 00:33:06.170
face all of us, you know, that, By being

537
00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:15.130
mad or longing to matter, uh, we Uh Unavoidably

538
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:20.930
enter into philosophical territory, uh, and some philosophers have

539
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:23.670
an awful lot to tell us about that. Uh,

540
00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:28.170
I'm a great, uh, fan of the philosopher Spinoza,

541
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:34.060
uh, who, of course, uh, derived, uh, from Portuguese,

542
00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.979
Portuguese roots, his, his dad, his mom. Uh, WERE,

543
00:33:38.219 --> 00:33:40.969
were born in Portugal. He, he, he went to,

544
00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.939
to, uh, Amsterdam. The family went to Amsterdam in

545
00:33:43.939 --> 00:33:46.359
the 17th century, but anyway,

546
00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.699
yeah, and my compatriot Antonio Damasio also has a

547
00:33:50.699 --> 00:33:52.339
book on Spinoza.

548
00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.660
Yes, we've been on panels together. We are both

549
00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.780
great fans of Spinoza. Spinoza was prescient about so

550
00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:03.949
much. And I, um, yeah, I mean, I, I,

551
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.530
I've taught Spinoza, it was a very unusual thing

552
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:09.750
to do is having come from philosophy of science

553
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:13.090
and philosophy of math, but, um, I find, uh,

554
00:34:13.188 --> 00:34:14.870
you know, that he sheds a tremendous amount of

555
00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:17.580
light, and he made the Enlightenment. He seeded the

556
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.188
Enlightenment. It it came 100 years after him. Uh,

557
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.270
BUT, you know, he is the first person of

558
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:26.389
the modern world to try to answer these deep

559
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:32.100
existential ethical questions through reason, uh, because, you know,

560
00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:36.139
it, it began in ancient Greece. Uh, BUT then,

561
00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:40.070
you know, the transcenders took over the world, you

562
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.379
know, and, uh, all the

563
00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:44.570
the scholastic philosophers, the

564
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:47.188
scholastic philosophers, but it was they were all religious

565
00:34:47.188 --> 00:34:51.469
thinkers, you know, and everybody identified themselves in terms

566
00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:55.438
of their religious orientation. It's it's all great. Theories

567
00:34:55.438 --> 00:35:00.879
of persecution, depending on disagreements between transgenders. But, um,

568
00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.760
you know, in the 70th century, and he really

569
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.399
is, I gotta say, the first to go back

570
00:35:06.399 --> 00:35:10.439
to those ancient existential questions. What is it to

571
00:35:10.439 --> 00:35:12.199
be human? What are we supposed to be doing

572
00:35:12.199 --> 00:35:16.570
here? How do I Justify myself to myself. How

573
00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:18.340
do I, how I, how do I live a

574
00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.010
life that is meaningful in my own eyes, um,

575
00:35:21.129 --> 00:35:24.110
that the Greeks had begun, um, and, and, and

576
00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:25.850
goes back to it. And then of course he

577
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:29.530
was excommunicated by his own Jewish community, uh, community,

578
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:31.889
and, uh, damned by the rest of Christian Europe.

579
00:35:32.129 --> 00:35:36.389
So, um, but people read him. They read him

580
00:35:36.389 --> 00:35:38.489
in order to refute him, in order to make

581
00:35:38.489 --> 00:35:42.320
any progress in um academia, you had to have

582
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:47.129
your refutations of Spinoza lined up. Um, AND study

583
00:35:47.129 --> 00:35:50.590
them. That was very dangerous because people read him,

584
00:35:50.649 --> 00:35:53.530
and slowly his way of thinking began to sink

585
00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:56.689
in, and 100 years later we have the Enlightenment.

586
00:35:56.889 --> 00:36:02.010
So, yeah, ideas really matter, especially these, these kinds

587
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.810
of ideas, the kinds of ideas that are directed

588
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.050
to what it is to be human, what it

589
00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:11.129
is to to have a satisfactory life, a good

590
00:36:11.129 --> 00:36:14.290
life, um, to not get our one chance of

591
00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:15.070
this wrong.

592
00:36:16.989 --> 00:36:22.060
Um, AND what is your approach to religion, because,

593
00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.300
of course, and I've talked on the show with

594
00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:30.790
many, many cognitive scientists of religion already, and religion

595
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:34.969
for many people, I mean I guess still for

596
00:36:35.229 --> 00:36:38.389
a majority of humanity plays a big role in.

597
00:36:38.735 --> 00:36:44.054
Their own mathering projects, let's say so, uh, but

598
00:36:44.054 --> 00:36:49.604
of course there are secular people, atheists, non-religious people,

599
00:36:49.895 --> 00:36:55.135
scientists that look at religion as a form, at

600
00:36:55.135 --> 00:36:58.925
least to some extent a form of delusion. So

601
00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:00.054
how do you approach it?

602
00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.939
Um, I, I, I would have a few years

603
00:37:04.939 --> 00:37:08.659
ago put myself in that group of a delusion.

604
00:37:08.979 --> 00:37:15.469
I'm, uh, yes, um. And uh I have more

605
00:37:15.469 --> 00:37:20.949
sympathy now for the difficulties of being human. Not

606
00:37:20.949 --> 00:37:24.149
everybody, I, you know, I, Richard Dawkins, he's a

607
00:37:24.149 --> 00:37:27.030
good friend of mine. We've spoke, you know, and

608
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:29.310
we've spoken about these sorts of things. I mean,

609
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:35.659
he says he, he gets such. Um, SATISFACTION out

610
00:37:35.659 --> 00:37:38.250
of his life of science, you know, to know,

611
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.419
learn the laws of nature, to make them clear

612
00:37:40.419 --> 00:37:44.540
to others, to, to revel in the beauty of

613
00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:48.219
the laws of, of nature, which, yes, I'm susceptible

614
00:37:48.219 --> 00:37:51.320
to this very, very much. That's my, very much

615
00:37:51.739 --> 00:37:55.179
my notion of transcendence, but not all of us

616
00:37:55.179 --> 00:37:58.260
are made for that, right? That, that's, we are,

617
00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:02.320
we are diverse. You know, diversity is spoken about

618
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.909
so much, you know, racial diversity about, you know,

619
00:38:06.719 --> 00:38:11.840
the, the most important diversity is the diversity that

620
00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.719
makes us go through different areas of the mattering

621
00:38:14.719 --> 00:38:18.719
map. Um, I can't ask somebody to revel in

622
00:38:18.719 --> 00:38:21.280
the laws of nature and learning the laws of

623
00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.860
nature and making them clear to others that I

624
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.850
Have or that Dawkins has, thank goodness in some

625
00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:30.810
sense that we have many different talents, many different

626
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:34.530
passions, many different interests, um, that make us seek

627
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.850
our mannering in different ways. It's hard to be

628
00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:41.830
human. Whatever is doing it for you as long,

629
00:38:42.129 --> 00:38:46.530
and here's the proviso, the guardrail, as long as

630
00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:52.120
your way of Trying to realize you're mattering doesn't

631
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:55.659
cause you to treat others or to regard others

632
00:38:55.879 --> 00:38:59.800
as mattering less um than you. I think the

633
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:04.219
intrinsic ethical mattering, you know, is there in everybody,

634
00:39:04.239 --> 00:39:07.699
and it is, you know, one has to respect

635
00:39:07.699 --> 00:39:11.030
it, um, and, and, and try to understand its

636
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:15.110
manifestations in other people. But if your way, excuse

637
00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:19.620
me, if your way. Leads to your regarding others

638
00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:23.939
as mattering less. Um, THIS is not admissible, this

639
00:39:23.939 --> 00:39:27.979
is not, and one can argue on purely intellectual

640
00:39:27.979 --> 00:39:31.860
grounds, um, as to why this is wrong, to

641
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.219
the extent that any of us ethically matter, we

642
00:39:35.219 --> 00:39:38.419
all matter to that same extent, um, and, you

643
00:39:38.419 --> 00:39:42.919
know, yeah, so. As long as there's, you know,

644
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.610
a tolerance, uh, for, for others' way of approaching

645
00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:51.199
this existential dilemma that we all have, um, If

646
00:39:51.199 --> 00:39:55.600
it works for you, if You do good works

647
00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.040
by it. It's all in the works, right? It's

648
00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.500
all, you know, if you live the kind of

649
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:05.830
life that I would say is counter entropic, um,

650
00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:10.729
rather than works with entropy, um, you're OK, whatever,

651
00:40:10.879 --> 00:40:11.929
whatever you believe.

652
00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:16.699
Yes, I agree with you and uh through my

653
00:40:16.699 --> 00:40:20.909
conversations with cognitive scientists of religion, I also learned

654
00:40:20.909 --> 00:40:24.149
to not look at religiosity as a form of

655
00:40:24.149 --> 00:40:28.439
delusion and as actually a natural phenomenon, something that

656
00:40:28.439 --> 00:40:31.860
is also part of. Our evolved psychology, at least

657
00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:36.219
to some extent, and I've had, uh, academics on

658
00:40:36.219 --> 00:40:40.600
the show who are religious and they do excellent

659
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.959
academic work. So, I mean, and, and they respect

660
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:49.100
science a lot and they. Um, GET, uh, information

661
00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.199
from science to inform their work, their own work

662
00:40:53.199 --> 00:40:55.820
and so on, so I mean, I don't think

663
00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:01.860
that religion, uh, is is even necessarily a matter

664
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:07.100
of believing in unreal things,

665
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.050
so, yeah, you know, and it, it could be,

666
00:41:10.179 --> 00:41:13.100
you know, I mean, for many it's just. A

667
00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:16.530
form of, um, you know, sort of connectedness. There's

668
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:20.379
community, um, there's, you know, and, you know, they

669
00:41:20.379 --> 00:41:23.870
were religion takes so many different forms, um, but

670
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:28.860
I have known personally in my life, um, religious

671
00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:32.459
people, including my own father, um, who, who, who

672
00:41:32.459 --> 00:41:35.719
I respect as much as I've ever respected anybody,

673
00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.719
um, you know, that they, uh, Yeah, it can

674
00:41:39.719 --> 00:41:41.879
be, it can be a force of, um, as

675
00:41:41.879 --> 00:41:48.770
I call it, counteranthropic working against disorder, um, creative,

676
00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:54.270
not destructive, um. It all of these ways of

677
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:58.469
trying to satisfy our longing to matter, um, can,

678
00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:01.639
can be intolerant, you know, when a scientist says,

679
00:42:02.469 --> 00:42:04.179
Look, I mean, I'm doing the most important thing

680
00:42:04.179 --> 00:42:08.850
in the world. Um, I'm, you know, I'm making

681
00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:12.110
the universe clear to people. Why doesn't everybody do

682
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.110
this? Why doesn't everybody seek their meaning in the

683
00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:18.050
way that I am? That's, there's an urge to

684
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:23.610
universalize what, what, um, and it's not just transcenders

685
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.969
who do it, um, it's all across the memory

686
00:42:26.969 --> 00:42:29.489
map you find, you'd find, um, and I have

687
00:42:29.489 --> 00:42:32.050
a bunch of, you know, statements that I've been

688
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:36.524
collecting over the decades, um, of. Of people of,

689
00:42:36.625 --> 00:42:40.364
of these, you know, these, these universalizing statements. So

690
00:42:40.364 --> 00:42:44.905
for example, an editor, um, Diana Freeland, her name

691
00:42:44.905 --> 00:42:47.715
was, it was the editor of, um, the fashion

692
00:42:47.715 --> 00:42:50.995
Vogue, Vogue magazine. She was a great fashion icon,

693
00:42:51.324 --> 00:42:53.334
and she said, you know, you've got to be

694
00:42:53.334 --> 00:42:55.604
well dressed. It's what gets you up in the

695
00:42:55.604 --> 00:42:59.439
morning, it gets you down the stairs. Um, WITHOUT

696
00:42:59.439 --> 00:43:02.840
it, you're nothing. You're nothing. This is a statement

697
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.399
of real denial of mattering to all of us

698
00:43:07.399 --> 00:43:10.479
slobs, you know, I don't care very much about

699
00:43:10.479 --> 00:43:13.399
fashion, um, you know, it'd be all over, you

700
00:43:13.399 --> 00:43:15.189
know, and, and I, I've got it from scientists,

701
00:43:15.239 --> 00:43:18.429
I've got it from artists, from novelists, from musicians,

702
00:43:18.919 --> 00:43:21.830
whatever it is that they are staking their life

703
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:25.760
on, staking their life on, you know, that there's

704
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.330
a great Propensity to universalize it and say if

705
00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:32.770
it's really doing it for me, then it ought

706
00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:35.649
to be doing it for everybody. There's a, a

707
00:43:35.649 --> 00:43:38.489
mistake in the logic there that I'm very eager

708
00:43:38.489 --> 00:43:42.449
to, to analyze and to expose, but it comes

709
00:43:42.449 --> 00:43:44.929
very, very naturally to us. This is a way

710
00:43:44.929 --> 00:43:48.409
in which philosopher, even analytic philosophers trained to look

711
00:43:48.409 --> 00:43:51.239
at every statement and try to take it apart.

712
00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:53.780
You know, is it true? What would make it

713
00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.959
true? What would make it false, um, can be,

714
00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:01.719
can be of some use even to non- philosophers,

715
00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:02.260
I think.

716
00:44:02.939 --> 00:44:06.100
Mhm. Yes, because we have to take into account

717
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:10.379
that even though we share many aspects of our

718
00:44:10.379 --> 00:44:15.100
psychology, there's also personality traits, there's other kinds of

719
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:19.179
psychological traits that make people different in terms of

720
00:44:19.179 --> 00:44:22.419
their values, their interests, and so I mean, I

721
00:44:22.419 --> 00:44:28.169
don't think that uh a universalizing. Project in terms

722
00:44:28.169 --> 00:44:31.870
of mattering and also in other aspects uh would

723
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:35.310
be a very successful one and also it would

724
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.239
probably be very oppressive.

725
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:41.070
Exactly, exactly, yes, and as I see the, the,

726
00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:44.469
the guard rail, the one fundamental thing is, you

727
00:44:44.469 --> 00:44:46.550
know, to the extent that any of us matter,

728
00:44:46.669 --> 00:44:51.649
we, we all matter, and anything that Um, violates

729
00:44:51.649 --> 00:44:54.780
that. This is, this is not a way to

730
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.550
be living your life. Find another way, um, you

731
00:44:57.550 --> 00:45:00.889
know, it's uh, and look at your own. THE

732
00:45:00.889 --> 00:45:03.810
role of your own ego in all of this.

733
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:07.729
Um, SO, yeah, so, you know, the self-reflection that

734
00:45:07.729 --> 00:45:10.250
gets us going on this project, it has to

735
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:15.810
be constantly exercised in operation so that we are

736
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:19.129
reflecting on the answers that we've come to and,

737
00:45:19.409 --> 00:45:22.370
and, and, and being open to other answers that

738
00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:27.250
are Offered or at least sympathize uh with other

739
00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:29.250
ways of doing it, and as you say, see

740
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:33.590
the role of our own individual psychology, you know,

741
00:45:33.649 --> 00:45:37.149
um, in, in, in, in, in contributing to this,

742
00:45:37.209 --> 00:45:40.669
you know, you could I love basketball players. I

743
00:45:40.669 --> 00:45:42.429
tell you, I mean, I can watch, I, I,

744
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:45.429
I moved, you know, because they can fly, they

745
00:45:45.429 --> 00:45:49.469
defy gravity. They're, you know, I wish I could

746
00:45:49.469 --> 00:45:51.350
be, you know, if I could live my life

747
00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:53.229
over, if I could come back as anything, it

748
00:45:53.229 --> 00:45:56.550
would be to be a center forward, but I

749
00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:00.439
am 5'2. This is not a way for me

750
00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:03.870
to go about, uh, you know, there are certain

751
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:10.610
limitations, you know, uh, physical, intellectual, emotional, um, that

752
00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:13.850
sends us on our particular mattering project, sometimes the

753
00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:18.399
wrong one, you know, sometimes people You know, if

754
00:46:18.399 --> 00:46:20.229
I write about, you know, a very good friend

755
00:46:20.229 --> 00:46:23.189
of mine who was very musically talented, very musically

756
00:46:23.189 --> 00:46:27.429
talented, had, had, had, had, uh, gotten a fellowship

757
00:46:27.429 --> 00:46:31.570
to a fine conservatory and Um, but he could,

758
00:46:31.649 --> 00:46:34.479
he, he, and, and, and his whole life was

759
00:46:34.479 --> 00:46:37.429
a classical guitar that was his instrument of choice,

760
00:46:37.729 --> 00:46:39.850
um, and then he couldn't, he couldn't do it,

761
00:46:39.929 --> 00:46:41.929
he couldn't make it, he couldn't make a living

762
00:46:41.929 --> 00:46:45.419
from it. Um, CLASSICAL guitar is, it's very hard.

763
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:53.409
There are no, the, uh, uh, uh. Pieces written

764
00:46:53.409 --> 00:46:56.090
specifically for a classical or very few, and you

765
00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:58.969
can't be hired by an orchestra, um, and anyway,

766
00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:02.209
he had to find, um, heartbreakingly, I mean, he

767
00:47:02.209 --> 00:47:04.250
went through, this is what we call an existential

768
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:08.209
crisis, when your mattering project is failing you. Or

769
00:47:08.209 --> 00:47:10.729
you feel that you are failing it, and you

770
00:47:10.729 --> 00:47:12.449
may think it's the most important thing in the

771
00:47:12.449 --> 00:47:15.719
world, right? Um, BUT yet you have to face,

772
00:47:15.729 --> 00:47:19.090
maybe, no, it's not going right. Maybe it's because

773
00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:21.209
of you, maybe it's because of the world, maybe

774
00:47:21.209 --> 00:47:23.360
you just haven't had the lucky breaks or whatever,

775
00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.770
but don't waste your life. Um, AT a certain

776
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:29.050
point, you've got to change your mattering project, and

777
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:32.159
that's exactly what my friend did. He became Um,

778
00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:35.419
uh, uh, he got his PhD in comparative literature.

779
00:47:35.459 --> 00:47:37.219
He's a writer, he's a filmmaker, he's a, he's

780
00:47:37.219 --> 00:47:38.820
a, he's a marvelous guy, you know, he's still

781
00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.979
an artist, um, because that was still, you know,

782
00:47:42.139 --> 00:47:45.129
that's where his passion lay, but he changed, um,

783
00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:48.560
and so, you know, these are, these are all.

784
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.300
Problems we face because of the need to matter.

785
00:47:53.399 --> 00:47:57.330
Yeah, you know, you mentioned basketball, for me, I'm

786
00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:00.929
more into soccer because of the kind of culture

787
00:48:00.929 --> 00:48:03.330
I was brought in. I mean, here in Portugal,

788
00:48:03.379 --> 00:48:06.689
people are crazy about soccer, but uh I could

789
00:48:06.689 --> 00:48:09.415
never be an athlete because even when I I

790
00:48:09.415 --> 00:48:12.364
was very little, I mean, 56 years old, I,

791
00:48:12.695 --> 00:48:16.334
I was already very much into books and old

792
00:48:16.334 --> 00:48:18.715
movies. I mean, I would just want to watch

793
00:48:18.715 --> 00:48:23.254
all the time, uh my mother's uh videotape collection

794
00:48:23.254 --> 00:48:25.274
of black and white movies.

795
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:30.030
Yeah, my kids too. They love the old movies.

796
00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.310
I used to show that, yeah, yeah, yeah. So,

797
00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.120
you know, we, these inclinations show themselves very early,

798
00:48:35.239 --> 00:48:37.560
you know, sometimes, you know, parents make a terrible

799
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.000
mistake, the same kind of mistake, you know, of

800
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.719
universalizing, but, you know, but caring most about their

801
00:48:43.719 --> 00:48:46.520
kids, you know, that, like, oh, look at what

802
00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:50.304
philosophy has done for me. ALLOWED me to overcome

803
00:48:50.304 --> 00:48:54.245
all my existential despair and blah blah blah, um,

804
00:48:54.764 --> 00:48:57.475
you know, and, uh, yes, my children, whom I

805
00:48:57.475 --> 00:48:59.685
love more than anything, they must be philosophers too.

806
00:49:00.044 --> 00:49:02.405
No, you know, it, it is, this is a

807
00:49:02.405 --> 00:49:04.925
mistake often that we make with the people that

808
00:49:04.925 --> 00:49:07.635
we love the most, um, that we, you know,

809
00:49:07.925 --> 00:49:13.189
what has been our, our saving, uh, project. We

810
00:49:13.189 --> 00:49:15.030
think at least at the very least, they ought

811
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:16.909
to have and and and sometimes parents, and I've

812
00:49:16.909 --> 00:49:19.600
seen this over and over again, they feel rejected.

813
00:49:19.669 --> 00:49:21.669
It's like, oh, so you think I don't matter,

814
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.709
you know, um, uh, you know, I, why are

815
00:49:26.709 --> 00:49:28.909
you not duplicating my life? Uh, ARE you telling

816
00:49:28.909 --> 00:49:31.469
me that my way is wrong? So, yeah, I

817
00:49:31.469 --> 00:49:33.179
mean, all of these things, it, it, it, it

818
00:49:33.179 --> 00:49:35.709
feeds into our life in so many ways and

819
00:49:35.709 --> 00:49:37.830
the raising of our children, the education of our

820
00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:43.520
children, our political, uh, choices, and, oh God. In

821
00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.270
everything, you know, which is why I was scared

822
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:47.090
to write about the book. It just was, ah,

823
00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:50.179
how do I tame this? It's too, but OK.

824
00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:54.860
So, uh, how do you think we develop our

825
00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:57.419
meing projects individually?

826
00:49:57.699 --> 00:50:01.239
Yeah, you know, it is, um, you know, some,

827
00:50:01.379 --> 00:50:03.719
some of it is, some of it, it's random

828
00:50:03.719 --> 00:50:06.179
in life, things are random, but I do think

829
00:50:06.179 --> 00:50:09.899
we have, um, you, you mentioned personality, and there

830
00:50:09.899 --> 00:50:14.729
are psychologists of personality, personality theory. And there's this

831
00:50:14.729 --> 00:50:16.850
one theory that I was very interested to learn

832
00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:22.250
about, um, the Murray-McClellan theory of personality that claims

833
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:26.320
that we divide up into three different types. We

834
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:30.770
all have these three basic needs. Uh, THE need

835
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:36.449
for, um, uh, affiliation with, with one another, the

836
00:50:36.449 --> 00:50:41.169
need for, um, some feeling of, uh, influence, of

837
00:50:41.169 --> 00:50:45.850
status, of, of power, um, power actually is the

838
00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:49.370
way he, he says power, um, and the, the

839
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:54.129
need for, um, uh, for, for excellence, uh, that,

840
00:50:54.389 --> 00:51:00.810
but In different personalities, one of these three dominates,

841
00:51:00.929 --> 00:51:02.770
and he had, they had tests that they had

842
00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:06.409
worked out, very interesting tests to see what dominated.

843
00:51:06.449 --> 00:51:08.729
They were very interested in, no, no, they were

844
00:51:08.729 --> 00:51:11.669
Harvard professors, they were both Harvard professors way before

845
00:51:11.969 --> 00:51:18.219
my time, but, um, and, and so they Giving

846
00:51:18.219 --> 00:51:21.300
into that urge to universalize, thought the best thing

847
00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.139
is wanting to be excellent, you know, the need

848
00:51:24.139 --> 00:51:27.139
for achievement, they called it the need for achievement,

849
00:51:27.419 --> 00:51:31.820
um, and they wanted, they had programs for, uh,

850
00:51:32.379 --> 00:51:37.169
making people over into achievers, uh, not affiliators, you

851
00:51:37.169 --> 00:51:40.379
know, but, but, um, and, and even, uh, trying

852
00:51:40.379 --> 00:51:45.550
to make, uh, countries over into achievers, right, into,

853
00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:48.504
and, you know, This is, again, this is the,

854
00:51:48.665 --> 00:51:51.544
no, not everybody is going to be so happy

855
00:51:51.544 --> 00:51:53.604
feeling that they, that's what they have to do

856
00:51:53.604 --> 00:51:55.705
to achieve, to be what I call a heroic

857
00:51:55.705 --> 00:51:58.125
striver. Some of us, yes, that's what we need.

858
00:51:58.375 --> 00:52:00.264
But, but in any case, there, there is a

859
00:52:00.264 --> 00:52:03.324
way in which at least 3 of these socializers,

860
00:52:03.544 --> 00:52:08.544
um, competitors, and heroic strivers, um, correspond to these

861
00:52:08.544 --> 00:52:11.584
3. Transcenders is, is, is something else, OK, and

862
00:52:11.584 --> 00:52:15.745
transcenders can, can take various forms. Some of them

863
00:52:15.745 --> 00:52:18.790
want power. Um, SOME transcenders, you know, those are

864
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:21.870
the ones who, you know, want to convert the

865
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:27.060
world to their particular religious view. Lord save us,

866
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:31.459
and um there are those who are heroic strivers,

867
00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:35.540
you know, perhaps intellectual, perhaps ethical, um, and then

868
00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.679
there are those who are, you know, who are

869
00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:40.370
the socializers, you know, uh, those who want to

870
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:44.290
work for their community, maybe perhaps becoming pastors, or,

871
00:52:44.379 --> 00:52:47.219
you know, my father was, was a clergyman, um,

872
00:52:47.419 --> 00:52:49.860
and, uh, you know, and he was, he was

873
00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:53.159
a, he was, he was a Socializer, he, that's

874
00:52:53.159 --> 00:52:57.300
what he cared about, helping other people. Um, SO,

875
00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.060
it, it takes many different forms. Again, another reason

876
00:53:01.479 --> 00:53:04.600
not to condemn all religious people, depends what form

877
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.209
it takes, um.

878
00:53:07.669 --> 00:53:10.790
Uh, BUT do you think that, uh, with the

879
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:16.310
sort of, um, individual traits, uh, that distinguish people

880
00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:19.510
from one another and how they get to develop

881
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:23.560
their own mattering projects, it is possible to develop

882
00:53:24.324 --> 00:53:29.004
some sort of objective standard to distinguish between better

883
00:53:29.004 --> 00:53:33.604
and worse ways to respond to the mattering instinct.

884
00:53:33.925 --> 00:53:35.725
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for

885
00:53:35.725 --> 00:53:40.885
asking that question. Yes, um, and that's really, really

886
00:53:40.885 --> 00:53:42.925
my goal, you know, the Spinoza, you know, he

887
00:53:42.925 --> 00:53:45.290
does so much in. His work, but he calls

888
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:47.360
it the ethics, you know, when I, I teach,

889
00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.370
we teach it to my students, it's like, what

890
00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:50.570
do we have to go through all of this

891
00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:52.570
to get to the ethics? Yes, you have to

892
00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:54.649
go through all of this, but, but by his

893
00:53:54.649 --> 00:53:58.330
calling it the ethics, he's telling us that's, that

894
00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:00.129
was the point of the whole project, and that's

895
00:54:00.129 --> 00:54:02.530
the whole point of my project too. That is

896
00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:05.770
these objective standards, you know, if it's OK, we

897
00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:08.290
should be tolerant, it's hard to be human, however

898
00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:11.010
people are doing it, let them do it, you

899
00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:14.860
know. Um, BUT, but some people are doing it,

900
00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:19.360
um, wrong, ethically wrong, and some, and, and what,

901
00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:25.320
what are the, what's the something objective, something that

902
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:31.169
can differentiate between better and worse ways of Satisfying

903
00:54:31.169 --> 00:54:34.429
our manner and instinct, but that yet wide enough

904
00:54:34.489 --> 00:54:37.979
to take in all of us transcenders, socializers, rogues

905
00:54:37.979 --> 00:54:43.050
drivers, and competitors too. Um, AND what I think

906
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:47.500
is I go back again to 2nd law of

907
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:55.870
thermodynamics, entropy, life. Life is the resistance to entropy,

908
00:54:56.229 --> 00:54:58.870
um, you know, that, that is all of our

909
00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:04.679
forces of every living system is trying to push

910
00:55:04.679 --> 00:55:09.669
against this disorder, uh, that is our. Her, or,

911
00:55:09.719 --> 00:55:12.500
or end, uh, you know, the disorder is death.

912
00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.840
I, and that's where I think we could take

913
00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:22.360
our wide and yet differentiating standard of distinguishing between

914
00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.219
good and bad mattering projects. The way I judge

915
00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:29.979
a person, myself and others, is, am I working

916
00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.280
with entropy? Is it going to be more entropy

917
00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.800
because I'm alive, or am I battling with my

918
00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:42.250
battling to Justify myself to myself. Am I battling

919
00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:47.080
in the direction of life against entropy, um, and

920
00:55:47.989 --> 00:55:55.679
against disorder, against Against destructiveness. So anything that is

921
00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:59.979
creative, as opposed to destructive, anything that that uh

922
00:55:59.979 --> 00:56:05.459
conduces to well-being, um, as opposed to suffering and

923
00:56:05.459 --> 00:56:11.050
death, um. The beauty, as opposed to ugliness, civility,

924
00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:15.110
as opposed to dissension, all of these things, knowledge,

925
00:56:15.219 --> 00:56:19.260
as opposed to ignorance, these are all hard things.

926
00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.699
They take so much work for our poor little

927
00:56:21.699 --> 00:56:25.699
overtaxed brains. Um, THEY take so much work because

928
00:56:25.699 --> 00:56:31.500
they are counterentropic. Whatever is worth living for is

929
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:36.090
counterentropic, just like life is. That's, that's how I

930
00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:38.270
judge us. That's how I judge myself.

931
00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:42.969
Do you think that it is possible for people

932
00:56:42.969 --> 00:56:48.889
to live life while acknowledging they do not matter

933
00:56:48.889 --> 00:56:51.199
or believing they do not matter?

934
00:56:51.409 --> 00:56:53.560
It depends, you know, if, if they think, look,

935
00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:57.409
I don't matter cosmically, I'm going to, I'm here

936
00:56:57.409 --> 00:56:59.169
for a short time, I'm gonna go out of

937
00:56:59.169 --> 00:57:03.939
existence. Nobody's gonna remember me in 100 years, whatever,

938
00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:06.750
you know, in, yeah, we can live with that.

939
00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:10.389
I think it's sanity. I mean, we're not, I'm

940
00:57:10.389 --> 00:57:13.860
not gonna say that all transcenders are lunatics, but,

941
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:15.870
you know, I think it, it, it, it can

942
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:20.169
be very sane and very rational. Um, IT'S certainly

943
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:24.209
what I believe, right? But in the sense of,

944
00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:26.510
I might as well not have been here at

945
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:31.590
all for all the Good I'm doing, um. I,

946
00:57:31.679 --> 00:57:35.909
I, I really, you know, in this. If it's

947
00:57:35.909 --> 00:57:39.469
the sort of I don't matter, that's indicative of

948
00:57:39.469 --> 00:57:44.510
I have no reason to live, um, no, no,

949
00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:48.229
it's not, it's not compatible with well-being. We are

950
00:57:48.229 --> 00:57:52.169
willing to even, we're willing to sacrifice our life

951
00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:57.360
in order to Satisfy the manner and instincts, you

952
00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:00.110
know, and, and, you know, that's what mourners do,

953
00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:02.500
whether they do it for a good cause or

954
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:05.399
or not. It is, it, it is so deep

955
00:58:05.399 --> 00:58:07.639
within us. And so the people I've known who

956
00:58:07.639 --> 00:58:11.080
have been suffering um from severe depression, do you

957
00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.760
know what they say? I don't matter. Um, OTHERS

958
00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.459
do, right, but I don't, nothing I can do

959
00:58:17.459 --> 00:58:21.179
will ever make me mad, um. And, and, and

960
00:58:21.179 --> 00:58:23.639
so that is not, you know, the, the, it

961
00:58:23.639 --> 00:58:25.320
depends what you mean by I don't matter if

962
00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:28.399
you're talking about the human condition, it's OK, you

963
00:58:28.399 --> 00:58:28.780
know,

964
00:58:29.489 --> 00:58:31.600
um, yeah, you know, but the interesting thing about

965
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:36.040
depression is that there's also that notion of depressive

966
00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.030
realism where it seems that people who suffer from

967
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:43.419
depression at the same time also have a more

968
00:58:43.719 --> 00:58:48.699
um objective uh or. Yeah, uh, I mean, I

969
00:58:48.699 --> 00:58:51.340
mean they are, they, they tend to, uh, to

970
00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:53.919
look at things in a more realistic

971
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:58.169
way and maybe actually to convince ourselves that this,

972
00:58:58.419 --> 00:59:03.000
you know, mannering project. You know, really matters. You

973
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.040
know, it's, it's, it's very hard cause you don't,

974
00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.949
you don't want the universalizing either. If it matters,

975
00:59:08.159 --> 00:59:10.110
if it's really grounding my life, then why isn't

976
00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:11.800
it grounding your life? Why are you not doing

977
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.520
it exactly the way I'm doing? This is, you

978
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:17.879
know, it's all very hard, but I, um, and

979
00:59:17.879 --> 00:59:21.479
maybe for a lot of people, you know, um,

980
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.360
the way that they convince themselves of their mattering

981
00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.889
is. I, it is a, is a little bit

982
00:59:27.889 --> 00:59:30.610
delusional, right? It is this sort of, yeah, yeah,

983
00:59:30.729 --> 00:59:32.770
this is the way, this is the only way,

984
00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:34.969
it's my way or no way, that sort of

985
00:59:34.969 --> 00:59:38.479
thing, and that's, that is delusional. Um, AND so,

986
00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:42.209
you know, that could be contributing to why, uh,

987
00:59:42.449 --> 00:59:46.689
those who are depressed or compared to the general

988
00:59:46.689 --> 00:59:49.449
population. Um, ARE, are, are a bit more realistic,

989
00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:51.739
but if you, it depends which group you compare

990
00:59:51.739 --> 00:59:54.899
the depressed to. If you compare them to scientists,

991
00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:58.620
philosophers, no, I bet they're no more realistic than

992
00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:01.020
we are. Most of us who live with that

993
01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:03.860
sense of, yeah, in the long run we don't

994
01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.399
matter. Look, the universe is going to heat death.

995
01:00:06.939 --> 01:00:09.260
Nothing's gonna matter, right? I mean, there's a sort

996
01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:13.659
of, you know, but uh yeah, so I, I

997
01:00:13.659 --> 01:00:18.030
think one can be a realistically Fully engaged. And

998
01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:20.389
I think one of the best ways I find

999
01:00:20.389 --> 01:00:23.189
to do it is, you know, when I think

1000
01:00:23.189 --> 01:00:27.570
about, you know what? I'm fighting against entropy. I'm

1001
01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:29.689
fighting with life, you know, and by the way,

1002
01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:32.610
you know, being a good parent, good, you know,

1003
01:00:32.949 --> 01:00:39.050
raising flourishing children, that is a difficult, difficult task,

1004
01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:42.889
um, and, and it's highly counter entropic, you know,

1005
01:00:42.969 --> 01:00:46.600
you don't have to be anything great, uh, or,

1006
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:49.909
or different from most people or have special talents,

1007
01:00:50.159 --> 01:00:54.979
uh, in order to be. Uh, HAVE a mannering

1008
01:00:54.979 --> 01:00:58.570
project that that's counteranthropic, um, and that's hard work,

1009
01:00:58.659 --> 01:01:01.179
that takes a tremendous amount of work. All of

1010
01:01:01.179 --> 01:01:07.050
them do everything, everything, everything worth doing. Takes tremendous

1011
01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:07.669
amount of energy.

1012
01:01:08.959 --> 01:01:12.639
So what do you make of approaches, I, I

1013
01:01:12.639 --> 01:01:14.659
guess we've already ended up touching a little bit

1014
01:01:14.659 --> 01:01:18.399
on nihilism, but what do you make of approaches

1015
01:01:18.399 --> 01:01:23.639
like nihilism and absurdism? I mean absurdism in the

1016
01:01:23.639 --> 01:01:28.520
more, uh, camu should I say Camusian sense?

1017
01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:33.000
I'm not sure how you right, um, yeah, yeah,

1018
01:01:33.199 --> 01:01:35.300
no, it's just sort of it's they're very interesting

1019
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.860
to me, you know, because since I've become interested.

1020
01:01:39.239 --> 01:01:42.629
Unusually for an analytic philosopher in these existential questions,

1021
01:01:42.889 --> 01:01:44.729
um, you know, I, I, I took to reading

1022
01:01:44.729 --> 01:01:47.189
them, and it's sort of proved, and it's interesting,

1023
01:01:47.449 --> 01:01:50.330
you know, they Yeah, everything is absurd. So what

1024
01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:51.969
does it mean, you know, what it means, you

1025
01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:54.669
know, this moment that we step outside of ourselves,

1026
01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:57.250
and we look at how committed we are to

1027
01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:59.770
this one thing in the whole universe as if

1028
01:01:59.770 --> 01:02:01.810
it's the most important thing in the world, and

1029
01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:04.770
how absurd that is. It's absurd, you know, and

1030
01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:07.570
yet we have to return to that life, you

1031
01:02:07.570 --> 01:02:10.330
know, we are going to pursue our life, and

1032
01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:13.939
that makes for For absurdity, you know, I, I,

1033
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.800
my, my, my, uh, PhD advisor was the philosopher

1034
01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.199
Thomas Nagel, um, and he has this lovely, lovely,

1035
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.760
an analytic philosopher who has this lovely article called

1036
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.360
The Absurd. Um, AND, and he says, you know,

1037
01:02:29.409 --> 01:02:32.649
that when we, he calls it, you know, self-transcendence,

1038
01:02:32.739 --> 01:02:34.770
when we step outside of ourselves and look at

1039
01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:39.629
ourselves, it's with that sense of, uh, detached amazement,

1040
01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:44.389
um, of, of watching, uh, ants struggling up an

1041
01:02:44.389 --> 01:02:47.104
anthill and sliding down. And throwing up and sliding

1042
01:02:47.104 --> 01:02:49.094
down, you know, and that's, that's sort of what

1043
01:02:49.094 --> 01:02:50.895
it's like, you know, so that, that captures sort

1044
01:02:50.895 --> 01:02:53.834
of the absurdity of this thing that I think

1045
01:02:54.135 --> 01:02:57.574
gets us going on this mannering, on our mannering

1046
01:02:57.574 --> 01:03:00.695
projects, um, but which is taking a step that,

1047
01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:06.179
that Nagle doesn't take, but, um, But that, but,

1048
01:03:06.229 --> 01:03:08.850
and, and, and, and what's so interesting is that

1049
01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:12.689
the existentialists came up with their own mattering project,

1050
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.909
um, which was to live with every moment of

1051
01:03:16.909 --> 01:03:20.840
our lives with the acknowledgement of how absurd. It

1052
01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.800
is, you know, and that's what courage is, you

1053
01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.800
know, that to be a Camus Camus says in

1054
01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.830
the myth of Sisyphus at the end of it,

1055
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.520
you know, to live defiantly, you know, that yes,

1056
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.879
we don't, we don't really matter, but we're going,

1057
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.110
we're living as if we do, and, and, and,

1058
01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:39.560
but facing every moment that we don't, and, and

1059
01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.840
that's what makes us heroes, you know, that's what

1060
01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.699
it is to be authentic and to be a

1061
01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:49.550
Um, Oh my gosh, do you hear that?

1062
01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:50.850
Uh, YES,

1063
01:03:51.129 --> 01:03:55.479
it's the sky is opening up. I have a

1064
01:03:55.489 --> 01:03:57.639
glass roof. I, I literally live with a glass.

1065
01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:57.850
Oh,

1066
01:03:57.959 --> 01:04:00.000
no, uh, yeah, don't worry too much about it.

1067
01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:02.449
I mean, I can, I, I can put a

1068
01:04:02.449 --> 01:04:03.969
nodule filter when I'm at it.

1069
01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.129
OK, excellent. Yeah. So anyway, so yeah, so, so

1070
01:04:08.129 --> 01:04:10.989
it, it's sort of absurdity is in some sense,

1071
01:04:11.449 --> 01:04:14.590
um, yeah, that is, that's one way of putting.

1072
01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:23.219
What it is to acknowledge this. Incommensurable gap between

1073
01:04:23.219 --> 01:04:29.600
what entropy demands we devote to ourselves, um. And

1074
01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.199
what we really are in this universe, you know,

1075
01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.379
unless, unless you're,

1076
01:04:33.389 --> 01:04:36.840
so, so do you think that as Camus said,

1077
01:04:37.199 --> 01:04:41.469
we should imagine Sisyphus happy just pushing the rock

1078
01:04:41.469 --> 01:04:45.199
up the hill, and we should think of ourselves

1079
01:04:45.199 --> 01:04:47.080
as Sisyphus in this life.

1080
01:04:47.399 --> 01:04:50.379
That's right, that's right, we're just going to. Yes,

1081
01:04:50.459 --> 01:04:53.939
uh, you know, but, but being aware of how

1082
01:04:53.939 --> 01:04:57.340
futile it really is, you know, and, and that's

1083
01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.939
what makes us heroes, that's what makes us authentic.

1084
01:05:00.139 --> 01:05:03.850
We don't get pulled into. You know, and that's,

1085
01:05:04.139 --> 01:05:06.540
yeah, I think that that's fine for some. I

1086
01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:09.100
mean, not everybody, I'm not gonna tell everybody, but

1087
01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:11.270
once again, universalizing, you know, to say this is

1088
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:13.580
authentic, and this is just, you know, not, not

1089
01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:16.520
authentic, is to say that some lives in some

1090
01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.620
sense matter more than others. I don't think that's

1091
01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:22.020
a good way to go. Nihilism would be to

1092
01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:25.860
say that there is no way of distinguishing between

1093
01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:29.260
better and worse ways of satisfying this, you know,

1094
01:05:29.419 --> 01:05:34.760
that, uh. You know, Putin's sway, which is causing

1095
01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:38.219
so much, such an increase of entropy in this

1096
01:05:38.219 --> 01:05:42.899
universe of, of instability, of, of, of disorder, of

1097
01:05:42.899 --> 01:05:49.020
suffering, of death, um, meaning, I mean, just uprootedness,

1098
01:05:49.379 --> 01:05:52.139
everything, you know, this is disorder, this is a

1099
01:05:52.139 --> 01:05:57.500
person who as powerful as he is, is. Not

1100
01:05:57.639 --> 01:05:59.830
living the way he ought to be living. He

1101
01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:04.020
is working with entropy instead of against it, um.

1102
01:06:05.739 --> 01:06:10.290
There's a Mother, who I, uh, feature at the

1103
01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:12.489
end of the book, a woman who I, I

1104
01:06:12.489 --> 01:06:15.909
didn't know her, I only Got to meet her

1105
01:06:15.909 --> 01:06:21.469
daughter, uh, but, uh, an extraordinary person this mother

1106
01:06:21.469 --> 01:06:25.209
had been. She was, uh, was in China, um,

1107
01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.770
lived in China as her daughter lives in China,

1108
01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:32.030
and had, um, during the period when there was

1109
01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:37.810
the one child per family. Uh, DICTUM from the

1110
01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:40.550
government, and all of these given you can have

1111
01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:46.419
only one child, people wanted a boy and not

1112
01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:51.280
a girl. Boys matter more than girls, and, um,

1113
01:06:51.659 --> 01:06:55.570
and, uh, so she was a garbage collector. Uh,

1114
01:06:55.689 --> 01:06:57.659
SHE would, you know, take in, take it to

1115
01:06:57.659 --> 01:07:00.530
the recycling, and then, you know, the, the, the

1116
01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:02.610
poorest person in the world didn't even have a

1117
01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:06.850
roof over her head. Um, SHE found babies, little

1118
01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:10.250
girls, uh, that, that parents had left out on

1119
01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:14.330
the street or in garbage, uh, dumps or dumpsters

1120
01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:18.590
or in the bathroom. She raised more than 30

1121
01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:23.250
little girls. This impoverished woman, I have pictures of

1122
01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:26.459
her in the book that Her daughter, her daughter

1123
01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:30.310
who was found, you know, was not, and um,

1124
01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:33.620
so this is, this is some money, I compare

1125
01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:38.260
her to Putin, this, this impoverished woman who, who

1126
01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:41.770
is, who is responsible for all of these lives,

1127
01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:44.179
who gave everything, you know, and she, she found

1128
01:07:44.179 --> 01:07:47.860
some Jell-O or whatever, you know, would go to

1129
01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.570
the children. Anyway, you know, that this is and

1130
01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.850
and somehow we know this, we intuitively know. We,

1131
01:07:54.969 --> 01:08:00.330
we feel moved by such people, um, so I

1132
01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:03.090
think that this, you know, a way of trying

1133
01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:06.409
to capture what distinguishes the good projects from the

1134
01:08:06.409 --> 01:08:10.489
bad is, is entropy. It starts with entropy, it

1135
01:08:10.489 --> 01:08:15.290
ends with entropy. I'm really an entropically obsessed person.

1136
01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:18.250
I've, I've always that it, I think it has

1137
01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:19.859
a tremendous amount to teach us.

1138
01:08:21.009 --> 01:08:23.049
Yeah, you know, I have to say that I

1139
01:08:23.049 --> 01:08:26.970
got tricked by Camus into liking absurdism because when

1140
01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:29.689
I read the myth of Sisyphus when I was

1141
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:33.649
around 20, um, I mean, I start reading the

1142
01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:36.129
book and then at a certain point he starts

1143
01:08:36.129 --> 01:08:40.089
talking about Dostoyevsky, Kafka, Herman Melville, and I was

1144
01:08:40.089 --> 01:08:42.850
like, oh come on, are you really mentioning all

1145
01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:44.770
of my favorite writers?

1146
01:08:45.790 --> 01:08:47.620
Yes, yes, yes, yes, and then of course all

1147
01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:49.890
these people are worth mentioning because they were heroic

1148
01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:52.580
strivers and they achieved something amazing, you know, they

1149
01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:55.620
all achieved something amazing, but, you know, we can't,

1150
01:08:55.939 --> 01:08:58.100
we can't put that out as the standard for

1151
01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:02.330
living a good life. You know, that's not fair.

1152
01:09:02.649 --> 01:09:08.430
Um, AND anyway, you know, um, extraordinariness can come

1153
01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:12.509
in many, many different forms. That, that Chinese mother

1154
01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:16.870
was extraordinary, um, what it took to be able

1155
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:19.529
to do what she did, um, and then I

1156
01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:23.020
asked this, um, The daughter, her name is Juju,

1157
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:25.930
um, uh, did you ever try to get in

1158
01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:28.259
touch with your birth mother to find out who

1159
01:09:28.259 --> 01:09:30.939
your birth mother is? And she, she, she started

1160
01:09:30.939 --> 01:09:33.419
crying and she said, I had the best mother

1161
01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:35.770
in the world. Nobody could have a better mother,

1162
01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:38.500
you know, I mean, to, to have done such

1163
01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.930
a thing in this world is, is something to

1164
01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:44.859
applaud. So, yeah, I think there, I think, I

1165
01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:48.600
think there are objective values. And I think, I

1166
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.479
think science, you know, can tell us what they

1167
01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:56.439
are, um, in terms of counterentro, are you working

1168
01:09:56.439 --> 01:09:59.640
with entropy or you're working against it? Um, I

1169
01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.279
think that's the best standard that I've come up

1170
01:10:02.279 --> 01:10:04.379
with for judging a person's life.

1171
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:06.899
Oh, OK, so let me just ask you one

1172
01:10:06.899 --> 01:10:10.240
last question, and as a philosopher, I think this

1173
01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.149
will be a provocative question for you. So,

1174
01:10:14.995 --> 01:10:17.084
As if as if these other questions haven't been

1175
01:10:17.084 --> 01:10:17.975
provided. Yeah, but,

1176
01:10:18.134 --> 01:10:20.424
but I think there's one in particular,

1177
01:10:20.754 --> 01:10:20.955
uh,

1178
01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:24.404
I, I, I mean, do you agree when Socrates,

1179
01:10:24.524 --> 01:10:26.725
or at least this is a quote attributed to

1180
01:10:26.725 --> 01:10:30.884
him, when Socrates says the unexamined life is not

1181
01:10:30.884 --> 01:10:31.685
worth living.

1182
01:10:33.109 --> 01:10:37.700
Depends what he meant by that, um. You know,

1183
01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:43.060
I don't like this statement because it, I don't

1184
01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:49.950
like anything. That entails some people are of no

1185
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:54.830
value, you know, um, we are all of value,

1186
01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:59.120
we are all of value, um, but if he's

1187
01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.839
saying, you know, that you, if you haven't. If

1188
01:11:02.839 --> 01:11:09.120
you've just adopted the norms of justification, um, that

1189
01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.240
were passively given to you, and you haven't used

1190
01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:19.319
your power of self-reflection to examine them. Uh, YOU'VE

1191
01:11:19.319 --> 01:11:21.830
got some work to do. You've, you, you get,

1192
01:11:21.879 --> 01:11:24.430
get, get back to work. Um, AND he, of

1193
01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:28.270
course he was addressing the Athenians who were people

1194
01:11:28.279 --> 01:11:30.839
who thought that the Athenians were better than everybody

1195
01:11:30.839 --> 01:11:33.560
else in the world, just to be born an

1196
01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:36.399
Athenian was to be better than everybody else, including

1197
01:11:36.399 --> 01:11:38.390
fellow Greeks, and then, you know, they were always

1198
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:40.819
boring with people and blah blah, you know, and

1199
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.089
um. And, and of course, in that time that

1200
01:11:44.089 --> 01:11:47.850
was a that was a quite frequent thing for

1201
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:51.169
for various empires, inhabitants of empires, you think, but

1202
01:11:51.169 --> 01:11:53.450
they really, you know, they believe this very much,

1203
01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:56.089
and he was taking that on. He was telling

1204
01:11:56.089 --> 01:12:00.470
his fellow Athenians, don't just passively think that you

1205
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:03.720
matter because you happen to have been born in

1206
01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:09.850
Athenian. It's much harder than that. That if that's

1207
01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:13.020
what he was saying, as I do believe he

1208
01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:16.140
was saying, um, then, then yes, I agree with

1209
01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:19.040
him. I totally agree with him. It's, we shouldn't,

1210
01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:24.600
we shouldn't just passively accept, uh, these, the norm

1211
01:12:24.899 --> 01:12:28.399
by which we justify ourselves and often condemn others,

1212
01:12:28.729 --> 01:12:34.060
uh. Yeah, she said, Does that seem right? So

1213
01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:38.660
I, I, I, I always like to, uh, Use

1214
01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:45.729
the principle of maximum charity in in interpreting others,

1215
01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:50.149
including philosophers, including a great philosopher like Socrates, right,

1216
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:53.779
as filtered through Plato. Who you know I like

1217
01:12:53.779 --> 01:12:56.279
very much, you know I like Plato very much,

1218
01:12:56.419 --> 01:12:57.120
yes.

1219
01:12:57.859 --> 01:13:01.279
Well, I mean, for me personally, I think that

1220
01:13:01.899 --> 01:13:05.859
whatever he meant by that, I still think that

1221
01:13:05.859 --> 01:13:09.560
the unexamined life can be worth living.

1222
01:13:09.859 --> 01:13:12.700
Yeah, yeah, but, you know what I mean, you

1223
01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:14.540
know, it depends what you mean, you know, look,

1224
01:13:14.609 --> 01:13:19.000
it's As long as, you know, I have a,

1225
01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:25.580
I have a friend, um, who, uh, he developed

1226
01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:31.060
the, um, God, what did he develop? I think

1227
01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:37.359
he developed the way of, of treating children who

1228
01:13:37.359 --> 01:13:40.779
were born to mothers who had AIDS, to immediately

1229
01:13:40.779 --> 01:13:43.939
being able to treat them when they were born,

1230
01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:47.370
um, and so that they were able to survive

1231
01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:50.299
and live. And then he told me that he,

1232
01:13:50.379 --> 01:13:52.700
he's a wonderful man, um, and he, he told

1233
01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:56.055
me that he, he's, he's been. Haunted by the

1234
01:13:56.055 --> 01:13:59.975
view that so many of these children who lived,

1235
01:14:00.294 --> 01:14:05.694
um, have were born into terrible circumstances, into impoverished,

1236
01:14:06.015 --> 01:14:11.895
difficult, uh, disordered lives, and that he feels guilty

1237
01:14:11.895 --> 01:14:16.984
about this. Maybe by developing this medicine, he increased

1238
01:14:17.345 --> 01:14:20.055
misery in the world, you know, so this is

1239
01:14:20.055 --> 01:14:23.520
it was interesting. But, and I said, you know,

1240
01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.160
I bet if you went to every one of

1241
01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.919
those, of those children now and ask them, are

1242
01:14:28.919 --> 01:14:31.359
you glad that you are alive rather than never

1243
01:14:31.359 --> 01:14:34.279
to have been born, they would, they would say

1244
01:14:34.279 --> 01:14:36.919
yes, you know, that, that there is, there is

1245
01:14:36.919 --> 01:14:40.399
something of such value in, in, in every human

1246
01:14:40.399 --> 01:14:42.830
life, and we, you know, we, we feel this,

1247
01:14:42.919 --> 01:14:44.470
we feel this, we could feel this in ourselves,

1248
01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:47.560
we feel it in others, um, whether they're living

1249
01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.100
examined life. For not.

1250
01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.649
Yeah, OK, so look, I'm seeing that we've reached

1251
01:14:53.649 --> 01:14:57.229
our time limit, so let's end the interview here,

1252
01:14:57.379 --> 01:15:00.430
and the book is again The Mathering Instinct, How

1253
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:03.970
Our Deepest Longing Drives Us and divides us. I'm

1254
01:15:03.970 --> 01:15:05.779
of course leaving a link to it in the

1255
01:15:05.779 --> 01:15:09.339
description of the interview, and Doctor Goldstein, thank you

1256
01:15:09.339 --> 01:15:11.540
so much for coming on the show again. It's

1257
01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.350
always a big pleasure to talk with you. Oh

1258
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:15.490
boy, I could talk to you forever. I, I

1259
01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:18.240
love talking to you. Um, AND

1260
01:15:18.899 --> 01:15:21.330
perhaps, well, maybe we'll have to do, uh, to

1261
01:15:21.330 --> 01:15:24.529
have another one of these conversations sooner rather than

1262
01:15:24.529 --> 01:15:27.270
later instead of waiting for another 7 years.

1263
01:15:27.479 --> 01:15:31.589
That's right, another pandemic, another whatever, but yes, I,

1264
01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.569
I would love, I would love that. I think

1265
01:15:33.569 --> 01:15:36.029
you're, uh, you're a wonderful discussant.
