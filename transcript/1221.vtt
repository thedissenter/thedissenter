00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.099
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:06.420
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.029
today I'm joined by Dr. Richard Wolff. He's a

4
00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:14.439
return guest, and today we're going to talk about

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.520
Marxism, dialectical materialism, and how we should approach them

6
00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:26.920
intellectually, particularly as Marxists. So Dr. Wolff, welcome back

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.940
to the show. It's always a pleasure to talk

8
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.219
with you.

9
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.340
Likewise, a pleasure for me. I'm very, very happy

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.020
to be here and particularly to talk about these

11
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.380
issues.

12
00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:45.439
Great, so, um, starting with, uh, Marxism, I mean,

13
00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:51.509
intellectually, how do you approach it? Uh, IS it

14
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.450
a philosophy? Is it an economic theory? Is it

15
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.810
something else? I mean, or, or, I mean, does

16
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.250
it even matter under which kind of uh scientific

17
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.110
or academic discipline. It, it falls, uh, I mean,

18
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.809
how do you approach it basically?

19
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.059
OK, um, I approach it in a historical way

20
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.010
that I can summarize this way. Every social system

21
00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:32.029
that we have any record of going back hundreds

22
00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:36.290
or thousands of years. Every one of them has

23
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.010
had in the, in the society, people who think

24
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:48.330
it is wonderful, it is successful, it is a

25
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.209
lucky thing that the people living there and then

26
00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:56.849
uh have this system within which to work and

27
00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.569
to have a family and to live a life.

28
00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:05.400
And in every society, there are people who don't

29
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.758
think that way, who believe that society could be

30
00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:16.339
better organized, to be more successful, more happy, more

31
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.360
supportive of human life than the one they're living

32
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.940
in. In other words, societies always Generate self-criticism, that

33
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.500
is the criticism by people in a society of

34
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.460
that society. Marxism is the self-criticism of capitalism. It

35
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.669
is a body of thinking, a body of feeling,

36
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.940
a body of action, of experiments of all kinds

37
00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:59.699
by people who share a basic idea that capitalism.

38
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.779
IS something we can do better than. But let

39
00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:11.220
me give it very concretely. Slavery, which has existed

40
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.880
in various parts of the world at various times.

41
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.229
WAS often welcomed and celebrated by masters, uh, but

42
00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:26.610
it was criticized often by slaves. They had a

43
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.720
different attitude, and the slaves particularly thought hm that

44
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.350
there maybe could be a better arrangement, for example,

45
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.360
if they were free and not slaves, occurred to

46
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.160
them, and then they made eventually the demands. And

47
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.000
the struggles and the ideas that led the human

48
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.070
race to say no more slavery. Mhm. OK. In

49
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.779
feudalism, the, the system in Europe from say 500

50
00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:08.809
to, to, to the Renaissance, that period, we saw

51
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:13.110
lords and serfs, and the lords thought it was

52
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.380
wonderful, and the serfs, not so much. And in

53
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.660
the end, I'm making it simple, of course, the

54
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.339
serfs had the idea, we can do better than

55
00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:29.260
feudalism, we can do better than the, and then

56
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.859
we had capitalism. Marxism is one of, not the

57
00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:42.410
only one, but one of the critical perspectives. Particularly

58
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.049
embraced by the working class, which has the idea

59
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.600
we could do better. Than the system we are

60
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.619
living in. They are critics, they are opponents. Now,

61
00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:03.339
in order to make it clear, we have to

62
00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:07.299
then, and I have to do this, explain what

63
00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:12.320
we mean by capitalism. Well, here, it's very interesting.

64
00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:18.209
The critics of capitalism don't agree on what capitalism

65
00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:22.260
is. That shouldn't surprise you. The critics of feudalism

66
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.820
didn't agree either, and the critics of slavery didn't

67
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.100
agree either. The critics of capitalism are very interesting

68
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:37.209
group. One of them, Marxism. HAS, at least so

69
00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:43.910
far, been by far the biggest and most successful

70
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:51.760
tradition of criticism that capitalism has generated. When people

71
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.859
say to me, uh, uh, Marxism uh will disappear,

72
00:05:55.959 --> 00:06:02.000
I laugh. Marxism won't disappear until capitalism does, because

73
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:08.100
Marxism is the self-criticism of capitalism. If you believe

74
00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:12.559
that capitalism is strong and that capitalism has a,

75
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.179
a big future in our world, Then I'm afraid

76
00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:19.739
I have to tell you that that's good news

77
00:06:19.739 --> 00:06:24.959
for Marxism, because Marxism is the critique of this

78
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.200
system. Now, even among Marxists, there's disagreement. I'm gonna

79
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.320
just mention one or two to get us clear

80
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.450
here. One group of Marxists, perhaps the one most

81
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:44.839
people know, Looks at capitalism and focuses on an

82
00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:50.399
interesting aspect, namely that capitalism as it emerged out

83
00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:54.920
of feudalism, starting in England in the 16th century

84
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.519
and spreading to Europe and eventually becoming the global

85
00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:03.619
system it is today, they focus on the fact

86
00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:11.850
that it was private individuals. Who's established capitalist enterprises

87
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.290
and who built them up until they were able

88
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.339
to make it the dominant system. And for them,

89
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.059
the critique of capitalism that they articulate, what they

90
00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:30.059
find wanting, which we can talk about, but for

91
00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:35.779
them, the solution that Marxism is interested in is

92
00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:44.160
replacing private enterprise. With social or government or public

93
00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:49.459
enterprise. And I'm sure the audience knows what I'm

94
00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:53.459
talking about, because if you look around at many

95
00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:59.549
socialist parties or communist parties around, say, Europe, Including

96
00:07:59.549 --> 00:08:03.549
in Portugal and Spain and so on, these are

97
00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:08.890
political parties that emphasize what the government should do

98
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.269
to control the market or to shape the behavior

99
00:08:13.269 --> 00:08:18.730
of enterprises or perhaps to run certain enterprises itself

100
00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:23.230
like the university, like the hospital, like and so

101
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.739
forth. That's not that part. That's not the kind

102
00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:31.630
of Marxism I find persuasive. I'm more of a

103
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.590
different perspective, and the pers which I believe is

104
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:40.530
now growing because the perspective on private versus state

105
00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:45.010
is kind of shrinking, which is normal. The different

106
00:08:45.229 --> 00:08:50.289
critical views of capitalism move and change over time,

107
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.070
just like the critical views of feudalism did in

108
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.349
the past and so on. So here's mine. For

109
00:08:58.349 --> 00:09:03.469
me, what's unique about capitalism is not that the

110
00:09:03.469 --> 00:09:07.299
state can be the employer that the state can

111
00:09:07.299 --> 00:09:13.299
regulate versus private. I understand that that's a difference.

112
00:09:13.599 --> 00:09:17.380
I take it seriously, but it's not what defines

113
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.669
capitalism for me. What defines it for me is

114
00:09:21.669 --> 00:09:28.270
a particular way of organizing the workplace, the factory,

115
00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:33.719
the office, the store, where people get together to

116
00:09:33.719 --> 00:09:38.400
produce the goods and services that an economy generates.

117
00:09:39.409 --> 00:09:44.059
I find capitalism to be a unique way of

118
00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:50.429
organizing the workplace. It takes, here's how it works.

119
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.450
A very small group of people sit at the

120
00:09:54.450 --> 00:10:00.820
top. Of a capitalist enterprise, the owner. The person

121
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:05.280
who started the enterprise. If it's a modern corporation,

122
00:10:05.859 --> 00:10:10.059
the board of directors of the enterprise, they are

123
00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:15.179
the ones who make all the key decisions. They

124
00:10:15.179 --> 00:10:19.900
have the power. They are the ones who decide

125
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:25.900
what gets produced, what technology is used, where the

126
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.770
production takes place, and what is done with the

127
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.330
output or the revenue if you sell the output,

128
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.359
what is done with it. They are the people

129
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.640
who run the system, and they have a name,

130
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.909
employers. The rest of the people, the vast majority

131
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.010
of the people who come to work in a

132
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:57.789
factory or an office or a store are employees.

133
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.489
They sell their capacity to work to the employer.

134
00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:08.059
That's what makes it different from feudalism, because in

135
00:11:08.059 --> 00:11:13.520
feudalism, the serf didn't sell his or her labor

136
00:11:13.659 --> 00:11:17.780
to the lord. That was not the relationship. Same

137
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.450
thing in slavery, the, the slave didn't sell his

138
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:26.140
ability to work because he did not own it.

139
00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:30.549
He was a slave. His capacity to work was

140
00:11:30.549 --> 00:11:36.609
owned by his master. So, capitalism is the system

141
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:44.489
of employer-employee. Now, this is very important because, for

142
00:11:44.489 --> 00:11:49.609
example, it means that I'm not very interested in

143
00:11:49.609 --> 00:11:54.130
whether the employer is a private person or a

144
00:11:54.130 --> 00:12:00.580
governmental official. That's an interesting difference. I'm not saying

145
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.210
it doesn't make a difference. It does. But it's

146
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:09.239
not crucial because what the state enterprise and the

147
00:12:09.239 --> 00:12:13.979
private enterprise have in common, what they both do

148
00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:19.320
in the same way is organized into a minority

149
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:25.559
that controls and a majority that is controlled, even

150
00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:30.140
to the point that the employer has the control

151
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.460
to say to the employee, If you don't do

152
00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:38.869
what I want, I will fire you. I will

153
00:12:38.869 --> 00:12:42.150
take away your job, I will take away your

154
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.140
income. I will plunge you and your family into

155
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.619
all the difficulties. Whereas what can you do? If

156
00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:53.099
you don't like me as an employer, you can

157
00:12:53.099 --> 00:12:56.179
quit, but then you're gonna go have to find

158
00:12:56.179 --> 00:13:00.690
what? Another employer. So you're not free of this

159
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:05.549
system, but I am free to, to control you.

160
00:13:06.169 --> 00:13:09.630
For me, and let me be real clear here,

161
00:13:10.729 --> 00:13:16.270
this is an unbearable arrangement. I find this as

162
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:23.090
outrageous as any slave ever found slavery or any

163
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:29.690
serf ever found. Vandalism. This is undemocratic, my God,

164
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.979
a capitalist enterprise is an example of the absence

165
00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:39.640
of democracy. It is an autocracy, a tiny group

166
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.030
of people. In our country here in the United

167
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:47.590
States, we refer to them as the CEO, the

168
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.950
chief executive officer of a corporation. I make a

169
00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.530
joke when I travel the country giving speeches. I

170
00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.570
say we thought we killed kings years ago when

171
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:05.229
monarchy was ended mostly in around the world. And

172
00:14:05.229 --> 00:14:09.469
the only monarchs that remain are figureheads. They're not

173
00:14:09.469 --> 00:14:14.780
real political dominant characters. We thought we had gotten

174
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.030
rid of them, as in the French Revolution with

175
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:23.549
the guillotine. But they fooled us. They changed their

176
00:14:23.549 --> 00:14:27.820
names. And now we have them, only we call

177
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:36.000
them CEOs because inside the corporation, the CEO functions

178
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:41.510
like a king. You are his subject. He tells

179
00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.059
when you enter the workplace in the morning at

180
00:14:45.059 --> 00:14:50.030
8 o'clock Monday through Friday, he tells you, your

181
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:54.969
employer, where to sit. What machine to use, what

182
00:14:54.969 --> 00:14:58.049
to do, how to do it, how quick to

183
00:14:58.049 --> 00:15:01.070
do it? When can you go to the toilet?

184
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.289
When can you have your lunch? When you must

185
00:15:04.289 --> 00:15:07.489
come back. And at the end of the day,

186
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.440
after you have done what he has told you

187
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.880
to do. He tells you to go home and

188
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.500
to leave it at the workplace everything you poured

189
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:23.119
your brains and your muscles into that is out

190
00:15:23.119 --> 00:15:27.130
of rage for me. That's why I'm a critic,

191
00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:33.070
and Marxism is the theory. And the practice and

192
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:38.349
the experiments of trying, here we go, trying to

193
00:15:38.349 --> 00:15:42.950
move the society in the direction where this is

194
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:47.789
no longer the case. The, the, the, the Marxist

195
00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:52.679
says, I want to do better than capitalism. But

196
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.380
he doesn't want to give up the machines that

197
00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.510
capitalism developed. He doesn't want to give up the

198
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.950
achievements that capitalism had, of course not, any more

199
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:07.150
than capitalism wanted to give up the, the, the

200
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.830
discoveries that slavery made and so forth. We build

201
00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:17.210
on the previous system, but we do better. And

202
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:22.770
Marxism is sophisticated. Let, let, let me remind people,

203
00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:28.609
Marx dies in 1883, so that means we have

204
00:16:28.609 --> 00:16:35.729
about 150 years since Marx died, roughly. During that

205
00:16:35.729 --> 00:16:44.770
time, his way of criticizing capitalism has produced Marxist.

206
00:16:45.599 --> 00:16:52.119
Trade unions, Marxist political parties, Marxist publishing houses, Marxist

207
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:58.840
professors, Marx, unbelievable growth in 150 years, I can

208
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.039
make the following statement. Every single country on the

209
00:17:03.039 --> 00:17:07.550
face of the earth has Marxists in it. Doing

210
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.689
all kinds of things. You know, the People's Republic

211
00:17:11.689 --> 00:17:15.819
of China has a government that says it's Marxist.

212
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.930
Whatever you think of that government is another matter,

213
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:26.839
but Marxism is a very powerful critical tradition in

214
00:17:26.848 --> 00:17:32.729
global capitalism. And I should say that capitalism had

215
00:17:32.729 --> 00:17:38.189
its greatest growth, not in the period from 1600

216
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:43.369
to 1850. But it has had its most spectacular

217
00:17:43.369 --> 00:17:52.050
growth since 1850. The last 150 to 175 years

218
00:17:52.229 --> 00:17:55.030
have been the growth of capitalism to be a

219
00:17:55.030 --> 00:18:00.189
global system. And just as Marx explained, that would

220
00:18:00.189 --> 00:18:07.780
be the best possible conditions for Marxism. To develop

221
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:15.709
So here's the irony. Marxism is the strongest, most

222
00:18:15.709 --> 00:18:23.540
developed, largest critical tradition of capitalism. If you are

223
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.630
aware, as I hope most people are, That capitalism,

224
00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:35.439
like every other system. Was born, evolved over time,

225
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:41.099
and then passes away. That's what happens to every

226
00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:45.540
other system. There is no reason to believe that

227
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:50.500
capitalism will not show the same pattern. If it

228
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.900
does, and I believe it already is, if it

229
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.959
shows a decline. And in the United States and

230
00:18:57.959 --> 00:19:03.280
Western Europe, decline is what capitalism is now experiencing.

231
00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:11.680
The likely inheritor of that decline, the likely way

232
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:17.540
of thinking and organizing. In that decline will be

233
00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:25.339
whichever critical tradition developed the most during capitalism. And

234
00:19:25.339 --> 00:19:30.290
that's more, which means I make you, not a

235
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:34.170
prediction, I don't believe in that, but a logical

236
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:39.150
inference from what I've said. That the future, the

237
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:45.880
future of capitalism as it declines. WILL be the

238
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.800
emergence of a new system. And that new system

239
00:19:51.219 --> 00:19:57.369
will be characterized by the democratization of the workplace,

240
00:19:57.619 --> 00:20:05.449
the transformation of factories, offices, and stores from top-down

241
00:20:05.449 --> 00:20:15.420
autocratic organization to a horizontal democratic organization where everybody

242
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.819
in the workplace has one vote. And we decide

243
00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:26.709
by majority rule. What the company produces, what the

244
00:20:26.709 --> 00:20:30.770
technology will be, where the production will happen, and

245
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.890
what will be done with the output. That's where

246
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:38.810
we're going, and I would argue, we're gonna go

247
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.250
there in England, and we're gonna go there in

248
00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:46.530
Portugal, and we're gonna go there in India and

249
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:51.920
China too. Each in their own way, each at

250
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.489
their own pace, each with their own history and

251
00:20:56.489 --> 00:21:02.410
religion and traditions, but that capitalism emerged out of

252
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:08.250
feudalism, feudalism emerged out of slavery, and this future

253
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:14.050
that I described, the democratization of the enterprise. Socialism,

254
00:21:14.119 --> 00:21:17.910
if you like, will emerge out of the decline

255
00:21:18.449 --> 00:21:19.530
of capitalism.

256
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.920
OK, but as I said at the beginning, I

257
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.239
also want to ask you about specifically about dialectical

258
00:21:28.239 --> 00:21:31.479
materialism. I mean, how do you look at the

259
00:21:31.479 --> 00:21:37.869
relationship or the role that dialectical materialism plays within

260
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.680
Marxism, and do you think of it as a

261
00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.500
form of scientific endeavor?

262
00:21:46.989 --> 00:21:50.609
OK, good. Let me begin at the end of

263
00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:53.109
what you just said. I don't know what the

264
00:21:53.109 --> 00:21:58.719
word endeavor means. I mean, it dialectical materialism is

265
00:21:58.719 --> 00:22:03.479
an approach to understanding the world. It is a

266
00:22:03.479 --> 00:22:09.319
way of doing scientific research. There are other ways,

267
00:22:09.599 --> 00:22:13.680
uh, there's no unique way. Uh, IN my judgment,

268
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.390
there's no right and wrong way. Uh, HOW you

269
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:21.359
do science for me is very similar to how

270
00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:26.199
you organize eating or how you dance, or what

271
00:22:26.199 --> 00:22:30.479
kind of music you produce and enjoy in your

272
00:22:30.479 --> 00:22:36.479
society. Human beings, thankfully, differ. They do all those

273
00:22:36.479 --> 00:22:41.140
things differently. You know, uh, my family is of

274
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:45.040
French origin. My father was born in France. So,

275
00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:50.170
for example, I love French cuisine. The French are

276
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:54.209
very good at food and wine, as you know,

277
00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.949
as are, of course, the Portuguese. AS well, but

278
00:22:58.829 --> 00:23:02.930
I love French cuisine, and it's different from American

279
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:07.510
cuisine. I live in America. I regret that American

280
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:12.349
cuisine is not French cuisine, never has been, and

281
00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:15.670
I doubt ever will be. OK, so for me,

282
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:22.969
dialectical materialism is one way to do scientific research.

283
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.310
OK, what does it mean? Well, to, to get

284
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.530
at this, you need to know just very briefly

285
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.719
about the history of philosophy. One of the questions

286
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:40.729
That philosophers who've thought about this for thousands of

287
00:23:40.729 --> 00:23:44.489
years, one of the things they've wondered about is

288
00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:50.739
what is the relationship. Between what they call material

289
00:23:50.739 --> 00:23:56.109
reality, you know, the hard reality of the weather

290
00:23:56.209 --> 00:23:59.890
and the soil and the wind, and, and, you

291
00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.689
know, the, the things we can touch, this can

292
00:24:03.689 --> 00:24:08.800
or this shirt that I'm wearing, the material aspect

293
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.969
of life. You know, we are material beings, we

294
00:24:11.969 --> 00:24:16.609
are born, we evolve, and then we go back,

295
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.089
you know, it was Ash Wednesday the other day,

296
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.170
we go back to the soil from which we

297
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:28.619
come. And philosophers have differentiated that part of reality

298
00:24:28.939 --> 00:24:35.380
from something else, which they call ideas. These are

299
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:40.930
thoughts that the human organ of the brain creates,

300
00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:46.579
the idea of something being beautiful, or the idea

301
00:24:46.739 --> 00:24:54.520
of something being dangerous. Human beings construct ideas. And

302
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:59.540
so philosophers have said, What is the, have asked

303
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:06.500
themselves, what is the relationship between material reality. And

304
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:13.640
the ideas human beings create. Now, some people look

305
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:19.810
at this question slightly differently. They think that ideas

306
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:26.859
Actually come from another realm of the world. And

307
00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:32.780
they call that realm God. Or religion. Or the

308
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:37.199
heaven, or spirit, or lots of words for it,

309
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:44.770
but it comes from somewhere else into us. And

310
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:48.319
it shapes who we are and what we do.

311
00:25:48.979 --> 00:25:55.770
Our ideas govern our behavior. And in the religious

312
00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:01.189
way of thinking, Our ideas that govern our behavior

313
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:06.290
come from God, because God, as is written early

314
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.550
in the Bible in Genesis, is the beginning of

315
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:17.250
everything. God created the material and God created the

316
00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:24.060
ideas, and indeed, God is Himself an idea. And

317
00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.050
it shows you that the ideas of the world

318
00:26:28.349 --> 00:26:33.630
are what make everything else happen. And the word

319
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:40.560
for this way of thinking is called idealism. Ideas

320
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:46.680
govern reality. Now, there were philosophers all the way

321
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.349
back to the ancient Greeks who disagreed with this

322
00:26:51.349 --> 00:26:56.939
perspective. Who said, yes, there's a material reality and

323
00:26:56.939 --> 00:27:01.859
there's an ideal reality, that's true, but it is

324
00:27:01.859 --> 00:27:06.699
not true for them that the idea governs the

325
00:27:06.699 --> 00:27:12.099
material. They have the opposite view. They think the

326
00:27:12.099 --> 00:27:17.339
material governs the idea. In other words, the ideas

327
00:27:17.339 --> 00:27:21.670
that take shape in your mind. ARE the result

328
00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:26.050
of the influence on your brain of the weather

329
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:30.390
and what you eat and the work you do

330
00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:34.770
and the relationships you have with other people, etc.

331
00:27:35.349 --> 00:27:41.140
So for them, the material shapes the ideal. And

332
00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:47.180
those people over time, got the name materialists to

333
00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:51.569
differentiate them from the idealists who saw it the

334
00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:58.189
other way. For Marx, who was a student of

335
00:27:58.189 --> 00:28:04.109
philosophy, just to remind everyone, Marx's education was as

336
00:28:04.109 --> 00:28:09.910
a philosophy student. He got his doctoral degree as

337
00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:16.109
a philosophy student. He wrote his doctoral dissertation about

338
00:28:16.109 --> 00:28:22.069
Epictetus and Epicurus, ancient Greek philosophers. And his first

339
00:28:22.069 --> 00:28:26.510
job was as a professor of philosophy, not of

340
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:31.579
economics. So, he knew what he was talking about

341
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.359
when he dealt in this area. He said, I

342
00:28:35.359 --> 00:28:41.280
have a different pos position. And he, he said,

343
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:45.810
I am not an idealist. And I'm not a

344
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.550
materialist in a way I'll explain in a minute.

345
00:28:48.969 --> 00:28:53.530
I'm something else. And then he gave great credit

346
00:28:53.939 --> 00:29:00.380
to his teacher. A very important German philosopher, Marx

347
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.489
studied in Germany. He was born in what is

348
00:29:05.489 --> 00:29:09.729
now France, the city of Metz, uh, or near

349
00:29:09.729 --> 00:29:14.949
there, uh, but It, it was German culture that

350
00:29:14.949 --> 00:29:19.489
he came to. Actually, if I was a mistake,

351
00:29:19.569 --> 00:29:21.449
he wasn't born in Metz. He was born in

352
00:29:21.449 --> 00:29:25.589
Trev or Trier. It's a German, uh, French border.

353
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:32.939
Anyway. He very carefully said, I don't believe that

354
00:29:32.939 --> 00:29:40.780
it's idealism over materialism or vice versa. Instead, I

355
00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:45.839
believe there is a, here we go, dialectical relationship

356
00:29:46.339 --> 00:29:52.839
between ideas and material reality. Each of them shapes

357
00:29:53.099 --> 00:29:58.599
the other. It is an empty exercise which one

358
00:29:58.819 --> 00:30:03.540
shapes the other. They both shape each other. The

359
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.859
way we think shapes how we act, and how

360
00:30:07.859 --> 00:30:12.160
we act shapes how we think, and they're both

361
00:30:12.739 --> 00:30:18.219
always, here we come now, changing each other. And

362
00:30:18.219 --> 00:30:24.510
so in Marxian dialectical materialism, You always study or

363
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:30.150
try to in your scientific research, you try to

364
00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:34.790
understand how the way we think shapes the material

365
00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:40.969
reality you're studying and how that material reality shapes

366
00:30:41.229 --> 00:30:47.050
how you're thinking. It is a very self-conscious way

367
00:30:47.229 --> 00:30:53.270
of conducting scientific research. It is, if you know

368
00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:58.750
the language, the coming together of epistemology, the study

369
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:03.589
of thought, and ontology, the study of how the

370
00:31:03.589 --> 00:31:08.630
world works. Those two things are intertwined. That's what

371
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:15.010
makes it dialectical, as in the word dialogue, interaction.

372
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:19.349
That's what dialectics comes from in the ancient Greek.

373
00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:24.489
So it, it's a particular Marxist way of thinking.

374
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:31.280
I like, if you're interested in the way modern

375
00:31:31.349 --> 00:31:37.239
European Marxists have tried the best of them to

376
00:31:37.239 --> 00:31:43.739
develop this idea of dialectical materialism. And the ones

377
00:31:43.739 --> 00:31:49.310
who went the furthest with it. Were the Hungarian

378
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:58.380
Marxist Georg Lukac. The Italian Marxist, Antonio Gramsci and

379
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:05.359
the French Marxist Luis Altusa. But the interesting thing

380
00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:11.349
is all three of them, Luca, Gramsci, and Altusa.

381
00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:18.180
All found the idea that they could develop for

382
00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:23.719
their way of understanding Marxist dialectical materialism. They found

383
00:32:23.719 --> 00:32:31.609
it in the work of Sigmund Freud. Sigmund Freud's

384
00:32:31.609 --> 00:32:38.670
first book is called The Interpretation of Dreams. It's

385
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:44.040
available in all European languages. It is a fundamental

386
00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:49.290
classic in the literature of psychology. In that book,

387
00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:56.969
Freud analyzes dreams. How do you interpret the dreams

388
00:32:57.109 --> 00:33:02.300
human beings have? And as he does it, he

389
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:08.640
analyzes, here we go now, how the lived material

390
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.180
reality of a person shapes his or her dreams

391
00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:19.109
during the night. And then how the dreams shape

392
00:33:19.109 --> 00:33:27.219
the reality around the person. This for them was

393
00:33:27.359 --> 00:33:34.880
a scientific person, Freud, a medical doctor, trying to

394
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:39.760
understand the medical, the uh mental problems of his

395
00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:46.880
patients using without knowing it. The dialectical method of

396
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:52.849
Marx to understand dreams. So they took this, Lukach

397
00:33:52.849 --> 00:33:59.079
did, Gramsci did, and Altusayer and said, look, here

398
00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:02.560
we can see. A way to do this kind

399
00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:09.438
of research where our scientific work embodies the notion

400
00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:14.728
that material shapes ideal and ideal material all at

401
00:34:14.728 --> 00:34:20.719
the same time in the universal process of everything

402
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:24.958
changing. I hope that's clear.

403
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.090
Mhm. No, right, I, I want to ask you,

404
00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.500
I, I think we will, we will probably have

405
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.580
time for just one more question, but I want

406
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:41.840
to ask you then, uh, since scientific knowledge keeps

407
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.938
e. Evolving and we've just talked about dialectical materialism

408
00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:50.679
as a way of thinking, as a, as a

409
00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:56.958
way of approaching science, of approaching reality since scientific

410
00:34:56.958 --> 00:35:04.399
knowledge keeps evolving. How should Marxists approach Marxism in

411
00:35:04.399 --> 00:35:10.399
the sense that, for example, if Karl Marx, Friedrich

412
00:35:10.399 --> 00:35:16.389
Engels, if Lenin, if Trotsky, and other theorists. Got

413
00:35:17.969 --> 00:35:22.389
things wrong if they made claims about what we

414
00:35:22.389 --> 00:35:29.449
would now classify as anthropology or sociology or economics

415
00:35:29.449 --> 00:35:34.330
or history or whichever other kind of discipline if

416
00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:42.129
they made erroneous claims that with scientific developments we

417
00:35:42.129 --> 00:35:47.010
now know are not correct. I mean, how should

418
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:54.189
Marxists deal with that and with the evolving aspect

419
00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.070
of scientific knowledge.

420
00:35:57.189 --> 00:36:03.320
They should learn the following lesson. If what was

421
00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:07.280
thought to be true in the past has later

422
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.439
been shown not to be true. Then they should

423
00:36:13.159 --> 00:36:18.959
draw from that recognition the humility. To be aware

424
00:36:18.959 --> 00:36:24.080
that what they believe now may also be untrue.

425
00:36:25.699 --> 00:36:31.300
That that's the nature of science. It's always finding

426
00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:36.139
out that the world is different from what they

427
00:36:36.139 --> 00:36:41.169
thought it meant. And the best way to understand

428
00:36:41.169 --> 00:36:45.629
it. That I know of, takes me back to

429
00:36:45.629 --> 00:36:52.800
Marx's teacher. Hagel Who is famous for having said.

430
00:36:53.739 --> 00:36:58.389
You can never step in the same river twice.

431
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:04.590
Why? Because between the 1st and the 2nd time,

432
00:37:05.209 --> 00:37:10.590
both you and the river have changed. So, be

433
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:15.310
aware that you are trying to understand something, and

434
00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:23.020
you are using the scientific. World achievements to do

435
00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:28.030
that. And that's what you should do. But it

436
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:34.959
is always incomplete. When you are trying to explain

437
00:37:34.959 --> 00:37:38.479
something, you can begin, and by the way, this

438
00:37:38.479 --> 00:37:43.959
is the key concept of Sigmund Freud's interpretation of

439
00:37:43.959 --> 00:37:47.560
dreams, just like it's the key concept in the

440
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:53.040
work of Louis Altusa. It's the notion of overdetermination

441
00:37:53.239 --> 00:38:00.310
in French, sur determination. And it's a simple idea.

442
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:06.199
That anything that happens in the world, a rising

443
00:38:06.199 --> 00:38:10.199
interest rate, a war, an idea that occurs to

444
00:38:10.199 --> 00:38:15.850
you, a piece of music is overdetermined by an

445
00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:22.260
infinity of influences. If we want to know why

446
00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:27.929
Ricardo Lopes. THINKS or looks the way he does,

447
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.770
the answer is, he thinks the way he does.

448
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.330
Well, let me tell you about his mother. Let

449
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.570
me look at how his father worked, let me

450
00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:39.169
look at his boyfriend, his girlfriend, he, he, his

451
00:38:39.169 --> 00:38:42.250
teachers, the books he read, the, the movies he

452
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:46.010
saw, the sports he participate. I could go on

453
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:51.699
forever. All of those factors, each in their own

454
00:38:51.699 --> 00:38:57.199
way, helped shape Ricardo Lopes, or me, or anybody

455
00:38:57.199 --> 00:39:01.659
else or any event. To say that I'm gonna

456
00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:09.419
use science to explain why something happens immediately confronts

457
00:39:09.419 --> 00:39:15.540
you with the problem. To explain something would require

458
00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:21.959
you to show all of the infinity of factors

459
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:26.419
that made it happen. But infinity is too big.

460
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.600
You as a scientist will die before you get

461
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.590
through. And therefore, here we go now, from a

462
00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:44.860
dialectical Marxist perspective. No one has ever finally explained

463
00:39:45.399 --> 00:39:50.169
anything. It's not possible. We don't have the capacity

464
00:39:50.169 --> 00:39:53.350
to do that with or without a computer. It

465
00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:57.810
won't make a difference. We can't. We invented God

466
00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.870
because we need to imagine what it is no

467
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:05.189
human being can ever do, and that's what God

468
00:40:05.189 --> 00:40:12.810
is. It's that which is beyond. So, all explanations

469
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:19.010
are incomplete, therefore, all explanations are open to revision.

470
00:40:19.939 --> 00:40:23.500
So yes, of course, there are things we think

471
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.500
now that make us say, as you did, this

472
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.340
statement by Karl Marx is rejected. We don't think

473
00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:36.419
that's correct. OK, fine. That's what science is. It

474
00:40:36.419 --> 00:40:40.020
makes those judgments all the time, and so it

475
00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:45.639
should. As long as we don't imagine. That we

476
00:40:45.639 --> 00:40:50.159
can do what Karl Marx couldn't. We can get

477
00:40:50.159 --> 00:40:55.439
to the truth that will be forever. That's crazy

478
00:40:55.439 --> 00:40:58.439
from a Marxist perspective, and that's not good for

479
00:40:58.439 --> 00:41:04.510
science. You study, you use your apparatus to make

480
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:07.989
sense of the world. Do it. It's interesting. We

481
00:41:07.989 --> 00:41:13.070
will learn from it. But to make the epistemological

482
00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:17.909
claim that you have the truth once and for

483
00:41:17.909 --> 00:41:23.969
all. You know what that is? That's ironically the

484
00:41:23.969 --> 00:41:29.750
Stalinism that these same people criticize. The Russians form.

485
00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.189
It's not, it, it is an attempt. I say

486
00:41:34.189 --> 00:41:37.350
this as a scientist myself. It's an attempt to

487
00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:40.709
shut down science, to say that science is now

488
00:41:40.709 --> 00:41:44.489
finished because we have the truth. No, we don't.

489
00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:49.770
We're constantly correcting what people before us did, and

490
00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:54.610
that's fine. But the notion that we get ever

491
00:41:54.610 --> 00:42:00.479
closer to the final absolute truth. That is actually.

492
00:42:01.209 --> 00:42:03.909
And the, and the person who captured this most

493
00:42:04.129 --> 00:42:08.610
is Antonio Gramsci, the Italian Marxist, and that's a

494
00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:13.850
religious person. That's just God sneaking back into the

495
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:20.610
dialectical materialist conversation. God is the final absolute truth.

496
00:42:21.719 --> 00:42:25.830
It is, and it should be understood as the

497
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:31.110
creation by human beings of the boundary that separates

498
00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:35.419
human thought from something that human thought is not,

499
00:42:35.629 --> 00:42:41.159
namely, absolute truth. We invent the concept because we

500
00:42:41.159 --> 00:42:45.699
don't, we can't get there. It's, it, it's important

501
00:42:45.699 --> 00:42:49.149
to understand, and by the way, if any of

502
00:42:49.149 --> 00:42:53.270
this is of interest to anyone. Then the Marxist

503
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:56.110
tradition is where you need to go. You need

504
00:42:56.110 --> 00:43:01.159
to read this material. These people, Gramsci in Italy,

505
00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.800
Lukach in Hungary, Altus, and many others. I, I

506
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.340
don't mean to only those three, many, many others,

507
00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.159
including in Spain and Portugal and so forth, have

508
00:43:12.159 --> 00:43:17.629
worked on these issues. And out of these issues

509
00:43:17.629 --> 00:43:21.229
comes an awareness. And for those of you who

510
00:43:21.229 --> 00:43:24.949
know my work, uh, dealing with the geopolitics of

511
00:43:24.949 --> 00:43:27.909
the time we live in now, if you have

512
00:43:27.909 --> 00:43:31.709
found my work and that of others who are

513
00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:39.350
Marxists interesting. Then please understand, it's not us. We

514
00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:44.590
didn't do this. We are using the Marxist apparatus

515
00:43:44.929 --> 00:43:49.199
to do our work. We are grateful to all

516
00:43:49.199 --> 00:43:53.850
that that apparatus taught us. Do we still make

517
00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:57.929
mistakes? Of course. Do we still say things which

518
00:43:57.929 --> 00:44:01.330
other people will find to be erroneous? Yes, we

519
00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:04.840
do. And I look forward, as long as I'm

520
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:09.139
alive to learn from those who can teach me

521
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.879
where I made a logical mistake or I misunderstood

522
00:44:13.879 --> 00:44:19.270
some fact or other. I, I'm interested in exchanging

523
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:23.709
these ideas, but as a Marxist, I know that

524
00:44:23.709 --> 00:44:27.899
the system in which I live and work. Is

525
00:44:27.899 --> 00:44:32.629
frightened of me. Tries to stop me from functioning.

526
00:44:34.629 --> 00:44:36.669
For those of you who don't know me, I'm

527
00:44:36.669 --> 00:44:40.469
malfunctioning in the United States, but that's because the

528
00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:45.800
United States has changed. The prohibition on Marxists and

529
00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:50.360
socialists is weaker now in the United States than

530
00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.399
it has been in my entire lifetime. I have

531
00:44:54.399 --> 00:44:57.949
a bigger audience than I could ever have before,

532
00:44:58.159 --> 00:45:03.439
and that's, by the way, mainly because capitalism in

533
00:45:03.439 --> 00:45:08.360
the United States is in a period of serious

534
00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:13.239
decline, and millions and millions of our people know

535
00:45:13.239 --> 00:45:17.060
it. And as they live through it, which is

536
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:23.360
what's happening to us. Questions are being raised, like

537
00:45:23.639 --> 00:45:28.260
what comes after capitalism? What happens if this decline

538
00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:34.129
continues? For the next few years. What does it

539
00:45:34.129 --> 00:45:38.449
mean that China and the BRICS is a larger

540
00:45:38.449 --> 00:45:42.370
economic unit than the United States and the G7?

541
00:45:42.729 --> 00:45:48.239
What does that mean? Why is the United States

542
00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:54.100
In the situation it's in, having become the bully

543
00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.969
of the world, having produced a leader that the

544
00:45:57.969 --> 00:46:00.219
whole rest of the world looks at as if

545
00:46:00.219 --> 00:46:06.080
he were crazy. Why is it that the countries

546
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.320
on either side of us, Canada and Mexico, are

547
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.860
arming themselves out of fear of the military attack

548
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.899
of the United States? That's never been true before.

549
00:46:20.879 --> 00:46:27.189
This is a country in serious decline. Left and

550
00:46:27.189 --> 00:46:32.270
right, everywhere. I live in New York City. We

551
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:35.590
now have a mayor who was elected a couple

552
00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:41.979
of months ago. Who is a socialist Muslim. The

553
00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:45.090
the mayor of the city of New York. We've

554
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:49.129
never had such a thing before. And he was

555
00:46:49.129 --> 00:46:54.330
elected overwhelmingly. It wasn't close. I live in New

556
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:57.570
York City. My neighbors are talking to me with

557
00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:01.250
great excitement about our new socialist mayor, a very

558
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:04.830
nice young man. And the fact that he's a

559
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:10.790
Muslim. Didn't bother them at all. Even though the

560
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:17.629
president is denouncing Islam and Muslims in the crudest,

561
00:47:17.669 --> 00:47:23.500
ignorant way imaginable. Here in New York City, our

562
00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:28.919
president counts for exactly nothing. If he ran for

563
00:47:28.919 --> 00:47:34.810
office here, he would get elected to nothing. These

564
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:39.389
are signs of a society. That's disintegrating, which is

565
00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:44.040
what's going on, and that means That there is

566
00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:49.659
a resurgence of people who are asking. Why is

567
00:47:49.659 --> 00:47:54.429
this happening? Where is this going? What is my

568
00:47:54.429 --> 00:47:57.870
future? What are the futures of my children? And

569
00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:02.389
in that conversation, we Marxists have a lot to

570
00:48:02.389 --> 00:48:06.709
offer, and so people are interested. They don't all

571
00:48:06.709 --> 00:48:11.409
agree. I can't convince everybody, not at all. But

572
00:48:11.409 --> 00:48:16.570
I can speak. I am part of the conversation

573
00:48:16.729 --> 00:48:21.560
in this country, and I must tell you, It

574
00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:25.979
is a wonderful experience. I'm having in many ways,

575
00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.000
the time of my life. Instead of being a

576
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.879
professor in a college or university with a dozen

577
00:48:33.879 --> 00:48:38.020
students in a seminar room. I'm on radio and

578
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.729
television all the time. I have my own program,

579
00:48:41.939 --> 00:48:48.120
weekly program that is global, etc. ETC. So, it

580
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:52.879
is, it is a time when Marxism is coming

581
00:48:52.879 --> 00:48:57.199
back into its own, and for the best of

582
00:48:57.199 --> 00:49:04.189
reasons, because the object of its critique, capitalism, is

583
00:49:04.189 --> 00:49:09.439
in ever deepening trouble. The alliance between Europe and

584
00:49:09.439 --> 00:49:13.639
America is over. The Europeans are trying to figure

585
00:49:13.639 --> 00:49:16.199
out what to do. They're not doing a very

586
00:49:16.199 --> 00:49:21.290
good job of it. They obsess about Russia in

587
00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:25.969
a way that is strange, to say the least.

588
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:31.449
Meanwhile, Russia and China have come closer together than

589
00:49:31.449 --> 00:49:34.879
ever before, which is what Europe and America had

590
00:49:34.879 --> 00:49:38.030
hoped to avoid. Not only did they not avoid

591
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:42.909
it, they helped make it happen. This is a

592
00:49:42.909 --> 00:49:48.429
sign of a system that's falling apart. Uh I

593
00:49:48.429 --> 00:49:51.469
don't want the suffering that comes from that. I'm

594
00:49:51.469 --> 00:49:55.479
very fearful about that. We are all wondering in

595
00:49:55.479 --> 00:49:58.959
the United States whether our government is about to

596
00:49:58.959 --> 00:50:03.199
go to war in Iran with all the implications

597
00:50:03.399 --> 00:50:08.040
that might have, particularly for countries in the southern

598
00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:13.639
half of Europe like Portugal. So, and we share

599
00:50:13.639 --> 00:50:17.669
that with you, but for Marxism, this is a

600
00:50:17.669 --> 00:50:21.949
good time in the United States, better than we've

601
00:50:21.949 --> 00:50:26.290
had uh in my lifetime, and I have white

602
00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:26.649
hair.

603
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:32.290
OK, so Dr. Wolff, let's wrap up the interview

604
00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:35.810
here because I'm noticing that we're reaching our time

605
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:38.850
limit here and I'm very, I'm getting very mindful

606
00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:41.409
of your time. And as always, I will be

607
00:50:41.409 --> 00:50:45.489
leaving links in the description to democracy at work,

608
00:50:45.689 --> 00:50:49.343
to your books, to, I mean. Every week I

609
00:50:49.343 --> 00:50:54.583
watch your economic update show and your wolf response

610
00:50:54.583 --> 00:50:57.702
show. So thank you so much for doing those

611
00:50:57.702 --> 00:51:00.143
and thank you so much for taking the time

612
00:51:00.143 --> 00:51:01.982
to come on the show again. It's always a

613
00:51:01.982 --> 00:51:03.262
big pleasure to talk with you.

614
00:51:03.542 --> 00:51:05.302
Well, it's a pleasure. As I said, it's a

615
00:51:05.302 --> 00:51:08.903
pleasure for me too. I appreciate programs like yours.

616
00:51:09.595 --> 00:51:12.416
THAT have the courage and the interest to develop

617
00:51:12.676 --> 00:51:16.916
these kinds of, of hour-long conversations. So we're not

618
00:51:16.916 --> 00:51:21.496
limited to the twelve-second soundbite and we can actually

619
00:51:21.875 --> 00:51:24.075
go into the material. So if you want to

620
00:51:24.075 --> 00:51:27.055
do it again in the future, please don't hesitate.

621
00:51:27.436 --> 00:51:29.315
I'd be happy to talk with you again.

622
00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:33.129
