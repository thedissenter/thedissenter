00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.730
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.639
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.479
today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor Ravi

4
00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:12.439
Sakotopolo. She's a psychoanalyst in private practice in New

5
00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.640
York City and a member of the faculty of

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.350
the NYU pro postdoctoral program in Psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.079
And today, we're talking about her book Sexuality Beyond

8
00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.819
Consent. Uh, RISK race traumatophilia. So, Doctor Secatopolo, welcome

9
00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.899
back to the show. It's always a great pleasure

10
00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:31.530
to everyone.

11
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.490
Thank you for having me back.

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.520
So I think that this is something that you

13
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.520
also did in your book together with Doctor An

14
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.360
Pellegrini, Gender Without Identity, but last time we didn't

15
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.520
touch too much on it. So I would like

16
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.119
to ask you this time and also to provide

17
00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:52.680
the audience with some background here. Uh, SO you

18
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.169
draw from psychoanalysis and in this specific case, the

19
00:00:56.169 --> 00:01:00.450
psychoanalytic theory of Jean Laplanche. So, uh, are there

20
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.229
perhaps some, what would these are perhaps some of

21
00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.889
the main aspects of it that are important for

22
00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:09.330
people to know, to then understand the sort of

23
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.940
framework you draw from and the rest of our

24
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.449
conversation?

25
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.769
Well, um, One of the key premises of Laplangian

26
00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:23.230
theory, uh, and perhaps it's going to be clearer

27
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.790
if I contrast it with how most psychonlytic theories

28
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.779
being usually read, is that while we usually look

29
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:35.000
Well, usually psychoanalysis gives us the tools to think

30
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.910
about what is outside the reach of our consciousness,

31
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.599
like things that we, our motivations that we don't

32
00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.360
know about or the ways in which traumas of

33
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.360
the past get turned into patterns, into relational patterns

34
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.000
that we then during the course of an analytic

35
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.080
treatment, one might discover what they are in the

36
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.120
hopes that once you know about them, you can

37
00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.580
stop repeating them. La Planche gives us Ops things

38
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.580
up to 3 more domains. The one is to

39
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.599
think about aspects of our psychic life that are,

40
00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:10.100
that can never be discovered, that are always elusive

41
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.850
to us, ways in which our motivations or our

42
00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.220
um our ways of being in the world can

43
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.020
never be fully answered by knowing one's biographical history

44
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.660
or what kind of like larger historical context one

45
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.419
lives in. In other words, that there's something about

46
00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:29.759
ourselves and our Um, our motivations, our desires, that

47
00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:33.389
is always going to be opaque to us. And

48
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.860
one might say, well, how is that helping with

49
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.070
anything, knowing that there is something that we can

50
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.869
never quite get to. It's actually quite a frustrating

51
00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:47.110
premise from some angle, because it means that one

52
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.259
can never quite reached the bottom, the bottom line

53
00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.440
of where another person or oneself is coming from.

54
00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.190
But what this also enlarges space for is to

55
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.690
begin to think about. To move away from this

56
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.179
tendency that we have, especially these days, to try

57
00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:10.860
to totally understand somebody, to try to totally get

58
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.419
where they're coming from. And the idea is, and

59
00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.059
some psychoanalytic theory goes, but also in our cultures,

60
00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.059
we believe that if you really understand where somebody's

61
00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:25.139
coming from, you can pin down the um Their

62
00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.089
intentions, you can understand um the background of what

63
00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:32.580
moves them and therefore that can help you learn

64
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.500
this person better. But what if there's, what if

65
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.350
there's always something that escapes us about each other?

66
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.860
What if the gap between us and other people

67
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.580
can never fully be closed? Now, on the one

68
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.580
hand, that's frustrating. On the other hand, La Planche

69
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.610
will say. That this is also in some way

70
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.929
the guarantor of our freedom insofar as there's always

71
00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:56.960
going to be room, there's always going to be

72
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
something that has escaped, something we might say, thinking

73
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.889
with like Fred Morton and Blacks that is something

74
00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.929
that is fugitive, that can never quite be captured

75
00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:10.529
by meaning or a presentation. And the idea that

76
00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.610
if you think about sexuality and you think about

77
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.130
like what draws us to other people, there's always

78
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.290
something that can never be reduced to who this

79
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.970
person is, right? Something that it feels more mysterious,

80
00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:27.130
more uncapturable, and that is the basis, um, and

81
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.279
the condition of possibility for what can happen between

82
00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.260
people. So that's one thing. Another thing is that

83
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.299
Laplacian theory starts with the premise that trauma is

84
00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:40.850
something that occurs in the very, very early encounter

85
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.070
between a child and an adult. Um. Merely by

86
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.730
virtue of the generational difference between the two, the

87
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.000
adult has a sexual unconscious that the infant does

88
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.720
not yet have, and therefore, the infant is always

89
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.959
presented in their encounter with the adult with something

90
00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:59.779
that is beyond what they can process. I'm not

91
00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.239
thinking here about adults who are like sexually abusive

92
00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:06.600
or who are overwhelming in the sense of being

93
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.850
like overstimulating to, to children, um. I'm talking about

94
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.970
kind of like the more normative ordinary way in

95
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.329
which adulthood has access to sexuality in a ways,

96
00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:22.279
in ways that um infancy and childhood do not,

97
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.970
and therefore, the infant is always unprepared, we might

98
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.890
say for what they encounter in the adult. And

99
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.739
that unpreparedness forces the psyche to respond. La Planche

100
00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:35.739
will call this. Uh, DESCRIBED this as a normatively

101
00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:39.420
traumatic condition. It is traumatic in the sense that

102
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.820
it introduces in the infant's psychic life, something that

103
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.070
cannot quite be processed. And in the effort to

104
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.910
do something of that encounter, to make something of

105
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.910
that trauma, the psyche responds with generating meaning, but

106
00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.549
also always fails to fully account for the foreignness

107
00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:05.540
of the other. And that's what generates the child's

108
00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:11.470
own infantile unconscious, unconscious life. Um, SO we begin

109
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.630
to see with La Planche that trauma is not

110
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.510
the exceptional condition that interrupts a steady state or

111
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.670
a previously serene state. It becomes the enabling condition

112
00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:24.109
through which we also become who we are because

113
00:06:24.109 --> 00:06:27.279
we are forced by this intrusion by the other

114
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:34.089
to produce things to respond to Innovate, um, to,

115
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:41.570
um, generate something new, and that generation is A

116
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.480
complicated one. It's both ours in the sense that

117
00:06:44.489 --> 00:06:47.769
that response comes from the psyche, but it is

118
00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:50.850
also not kind of like done kind of like

119
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.809
with your consent and it's at the border of

120
00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:56.250
what you have got bargained for because you, you

121
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.619
don't quite bargain for everything, anything as a child,

122
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.700
um. So that's the second piece. And the third

123
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.470
piece is instance that psychosexuality is at the core

124
00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:08.420
of human life, which is not to say that

125
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.179
everybody's thinking about sex all the time or that

126
00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:13.019
sex is the most important factor in our lives,

127
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.609
but there's something about the anarchy and the disorder

128
00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:23.329
of the sexual drive that Lines, um, everything that

129
00:07:23.329 --> 00:07:27.049
we do, um, introducing that disturbance that we were

130
00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:29.809
talking about earlier, which gives us the chance to

131
00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:31.450
do things again and differently.

132
00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:36.709
Mhm. So do, do all these aspects of trauma

133
00:07:36.709 --> 00:07:40.230
that you described there from a psychoanalytic perspective and

134
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.019
particularly from the perspective of John Lap Blanche applied

135
00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:45.429
to sexuality?

136
00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:52.700
Absolutely they are in fact. Derived from um the

137
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.739
sexual and then begin to infiltrate the sexual Lablanche

138
00:07:57.739 --> 00:08:02.160
will say well in infiltrate. Everything about our psychic

139
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.799
life, it will infiltrate our sense of our identity,

140
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.440
it will infiltrate how we do relationships, our defenses,

141
00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:11.200
our ways of being in the world are our

142
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.000
affect. So there's not nothing that is untouched by

143
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.600
the sexual, which is again, I want to make

144
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.480
a distinction here between thinking about the sexual and

145
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.559
thinking about sexuality. Sexuality is usually the word that

146
00:08:23.559 --> 00:08:29.859
we reserve for describing sexual preferences, sexual orientation, um,

147
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.710
certain sets of behaviors around sexuality or sexual fantasies,

148
00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:38.119
um, so they're all sexuality is very much in

149
00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:41.400
the domain of things that have become psychically represented.

150
00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:45.809
The sexual is something else. The sexual is precisely

151
00:08:45.809 --> 00:08:49.559
this resistance to meaning. When we were speaking earlier

152
00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:52.679
about how the psyche is forced to respond, I

153
00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:59.119
mentioned briefly that the psychic cannot fully respond to

154
00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:02.679
everything that it's presented with from the other. Initially,

155
00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:04.719
the other is the adult, eventually in life the

156
00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:08.400
other becomes the small other of other people or

157
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.039
the capital other of kind of like whatever feels

158
00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:17.270
foreign to us. Like we can never fully Call

159
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:22.640
the foreigners of these enigmatic presences in our lives,

160
00:09:23.049 --> 00:09:28.330
and that creates a sense of, or rather the

161
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.929
fact that we cannot. Fully totalize the other's foreigners

162
00:09:32.929 --> 00:09:35.090
means that there always remains in us something that

163
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.169
is anarchic, that is kind of like functions as

164
00:09:39.169 --> 00:09:42.890
a disturbance to organized meaning. Um, AND I might

165
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.570
say that this is also the source of our

166
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:50.409
resistance to everything that we are. INCULCATED into thinking

167
00:09:50.409 --> 00:09:53.489
about the world, about others, um, anything new that

168
00:09:53.489 --> 00:09:56.929
comes from us, um, comes from that part of

169
00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:57.690
the psyche.

170
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:03.880
Mhm. And what is then traumatophobia? Could you explain

171
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.559
that concept,

172
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:10.059
please? Yeah. No, I, I do something quite um

173
00:10:10.429 --> 00:10:13.830
surprising in this book, which is that I try

174
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.109
to speak about trauma, not in terms of its

175
00:10:17.109 --> 00:10:19.669
occurrence, whether trauma happens or not, or even if

176
00:10:19.669 --> 00:10:23.109
it's sequela. Usually we talk about what happens when

177
00:10:23.109 --> 00:10:27.280
the subject is traumatized, if you're traumatized. You may

178
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.070
suffer from some kinds of symptoms or trauma may

179
00:10:30.719 --> 00:10:34.760
appear in certain ways in your everyday life, in

180
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:42.590
your relational engagements, um, in your family experiences. I

181
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.599
become more interested in the book. I want to

182
00:10:44.599 --> 00:10:47.440
interest us in how we think about trauma, that

183
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.760
there are ways, most the preponderance of the ways

184
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.880
we think about trauma, I suggest, have a traumatopphobic

185
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.520
quality, and traumatophobia is a word that I draw

186
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.000
from La Planche who gives it to us but

187
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.719
doesn't quite flesh it out, and my project is

188
00:11:04.719 --> 00:11:09.559
to flesh reatophobia and reophilia out. Tremorophobia is the

189
00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:13.119
composite word. Trauma and hovea, which is the Greek

190
00:11:13.119 --> 00:11:16.320
word for hovos, for fear, and it speaks to

191
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.270
the ways in which we are so frightened of

192
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:25.429
trauma. That we respond to it by recoiling into

193
00:11:25.429 --> 00:11:27.359
trying to fix it. Now, this may sound very

194
00:11:27.359 --> 00:11:29.429
paradoxical, so let me explain what I mean by

195
00:11:29.429 --> 00:11:35.659
that. Of course, it is very natural and. Nobody

196
00:11:35.659 --> 00:11:38.099
wants to be traumatized, nor should we want for

197
00:11:38.099 --> 00:11:43.500
people to be traumatized. And yet traumatic encounters are

198
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.419
part of everyday life. They are ordinary, not in

199
00:11:48.419 --> 00:11:51.419
the sense that they are just or fair, but

200
00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:54.549
in the sense that they are inevitable. Maybe in

201
00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:58.380
another utopian society, they're not inevitable, and we kind

202
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:03.799
of like get to. KIND of like diminish the,

203
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.510
the amount of harm that happens in the world,

204
00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:07.840
but that's not the condition right now. So the

205
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.599
question becomes how do we understand the impact that

206
00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:13.080
the trauma has on the human soul, on the

207
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:19.369
human psyche. And homophobic approaches treat trauma as more

208
00:12:19.369 --> 00:12:24.440
or less a disaster, as destroying human life, as

209
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.250
bringing the catastrophe from which then subjects are left

210
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:35.090
either struggling with its implications and trying to piece

211
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.359
together a life so that they can hopefully return

212
00:12:37.359 --> 00:12:40.460
to some pre-traumatic state. So there's this idea that

213
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.179
you were kind of intact, trauma breaks you, and

214
00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:47.140
then the task of treatment, for example, is to

215
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.380
piece your pieces back together, to assemble yourself back

216
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.260
so that you're back to who you were before

217
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.099
you were traumatized. And I argue that that is

218
00:12:56.099 --> 00:12:58.780
a, a phobic approach to trauma for a couple

219
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.159
of different reasons. First of all, because as a

220
00:13:01.159 --> 00:13:03.859
practicing psychoanalyst and as somebody who is not just

221
00:13:03.859 --> 00:13:07.609
seeing patients for Um, over 20 years, but also

222
00:13:07.609 --> 00:13:11.369
somebody who is training other clinicians and is very

223
00:13:11.369 --> 00:13:14.440
active in my field in communication with other colleagues.

224
00:13:14.729 --> 00:13:17.130
I've never seen trauma being healed and neither has

225
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.890
any of my colleagues, uh, meaning nobody ever truly

226
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.869
returns to a pre-traumatic state. Nothing gets repaired back

227
00:13:24.869 --> 00:13:27.710
to where it was, no matter how good your

228
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:31.299
resources or your intentions, or however motivated a patient

229
00:13:31.299 --> 00:13:34.000
is, even if they have the best analyst or

230
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.390
therapist in the world, and all the time in

231
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.030
the world to do the psychic work that they

232
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.619
need to do. Like the psyche never quite returns

233
00:13:41.619 --> 00:13:46.679
to where it was, um. And that is You

234
00:13:46.679 --> 00:13:48.919
know, this brings us back to what we were

235
00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:50.880
talking about earlier in terms of what La Blanche

236
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.719
brings to this conversation, which is that the psyche

237
00:13:54.719 --> 00:13:57.119
does not return back, not because the psyche is

238
00:13:57.119 --> 00:14:01.159
so damaged that it can never reconstitute itself, but

239
00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:04.840
because trauma forces us to respond and we human

240
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:10.750
beings produce responses, secrete, we might say responses, vis

241
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.840
a vis the trauma that we have encountered that

242
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.960
also transform us. So, and this is what I

243
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.739
would call a more traumatophilic approach to trauma, like

244
00:14:20.739 --> 00:14:22.440
what would it mean to think about to have

245
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.599
an affinity for thinking about how trauma does not

246
00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:29.520
just deform us, it also forms us. It doesn't

247
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.000
just bend us out of shape, it also shapes

248
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.789
us, and that is not necessarily always the disastrous

249
00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:40.489
outcome. That is that is purported to be again,

250
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.130
this is not to say, you know, who cares

251
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.369
if people get traumatized or not, nor is it

252
00:14:44.369 --> 00:14:47.039
to say that we should stop whatever social justice

253
00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:50.049
struggles we are engaged in to stop these kinds

254
00:14:50.049 --> 00:14:53.049
of traumatic circumstances from happening. It is only to

255
00:14:53.049 --> 00:14:55.650
say that for a trauma that has already happened.

256
00:14:56.549 --> 00:14:59.380
And that has been the case for millennial of

257
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.780
for thousands of years in human life and will

258
00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.570
continue, I think, to be the case. For trauma

259
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:11.950
that has already happened, the. To to the treatment

260
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:18.190
to to regard trauma as only breaking us overlooks

261
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.750
the many ways in which subjects engage with their

262
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.979
trauma. Now, if I were to say to you,

263
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.520
look, um, think about how much art and literature

264
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.739
comes out of. Artists relationship with their own trauma

265
00:15:32.739 --> 00:15:34.900
with trying not just to express it, but also

266
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:39.030
to. Give it to to use it as a

267
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:43.250
propulsive force. Many of us would say, OK, I

268
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.719
understand that, but that's different, that's creativity. And indeed,

269
00:15:47.809 --> 00:15:49.969
I'm trying to say more than just trauma can

270
00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:55.559
be used creatively. Because when we find a trauma

271
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.020
in the domains of cultural production or literary production,

272
00:15:59.099 --> 00:16:02.780
we welcome that kind of traumatophilic response. But when

273
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.940
we find it in the domains of sexuality, when

274
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.859
we find it in the domains of gender, when

275
00:16:06.859 --> 00:16:08.539
do we find it in the domains of how

276
00:16:08.539 --> 00:16:12.059
people might actually engage their trauma, rather than trying

277
00:16:12.059 --> 00:16:14.340
to heal it or move away from it. It

278
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.159
really frightens us. And then that's, that's when we

279
00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:20.659
begin to pathologize different kinds of sexualities or genders

280
00:16:20.659 --> 00:16:23.510
or different modes of being in the world. So

281
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:27.979
we enjoy finding trauma, thinking to metopilically, even though

282
00:16:27.979 --> 00:16:29.700
we may not be using that word when it

283
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.460
comes to creative endeavors, but it's really hard to

284
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.099
think about this in the breadth of human experience.

285
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:41.820
Mhm. Uh, AND so if not creatively, how could,

286
00:16:41.929 --> 00:16:45.679
uh, just, uh, let's say a regular person could

287
00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:49.840
have a traumatophilic approach to trauma.

288
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.039
Well, I'm not, I'm not going to say that

289
00:16:53.039 --> 00:16:55.340
there's not also creative uses of trauma, so I'm

290
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.580
not trying to like legislate against that. But, um,

291
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.650
and I'm less interested in Offering like a programmatic

292
00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.699
of how we might now treat our deal with

293
00:17:07.699 --> 00:17:10.969
our trauma differently. What I'm trying to call attention

294
00:17:10.969 --> 00:17:13.618
to in, in my book Sexuality Beyond Consent is

295
00:17:13.618 --> 00:17:18.420
how subjects do already engage with their trauma in

296
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.780
traumatophilic ways, but we do not see that as

297
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.939
an engagement of trauma. We sometimes see it as

298
00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:27.130
a symptom of trauma, as if somebody is really

299
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.930
stuck in their trauma and they should get over

300
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.900
it. So it's unlikely that you would hear somebody

301
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:36.920
say, oh, for example, Uh, somebody's writing about their

302
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.599
Holocaust experience, they should just leave it alone because

303
00:17:39.599 --> 00:17:41.640
that's a symptom of how stuck they are on

304
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.959
it. Like the writings that come out of these

305
00:17:44.959 --> 00:17:48.040
kinds of experiences are very well regarded and taken

306
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.609
very much of works of both, um, memoir and

307
00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:56.880
and like of um like expansive uh psychic production.

308
00:17:57.619 --> 00:18:00.709
But when we find trauma in how people have

309
00:18:00.709 --> 00:18:03.979
sex or what people do with their gender, um,

310
00:18:03.989 --> 00:18:06.430
or what kinds of art, I'm thinking of like

311
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.180
art that falls under the category of what Jennifer

312
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.150
Doyle has described as difficult art, art that Adorno

313
00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.949
has described as taking us into the disaster, rather

314
00:18:16.949 --> 00:18:20.250
than trying to speak about the disaster. Uh, I'm

315
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.449
thinking about sexual experiences, like, for example, in my

316
00:18:23.449 --> 00:18:25.209
book I talk a lot about, I spent a

317
00:18:25.209 --> 00:18:27.319
couple of different chapters talking about a, a work

318
00:18:27.319 --> 00:18:30.079
of art, a theatrical piece that's called Slave play

319
00:18:30.369 --> 00:18:35.689
that explores um black person's uh desires for racial

320
00:18:35.689 --> 00:18:40.800
humiliation by white partners. Um, SO here is an

321
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.949
example of the sort of desire that one might

322
00:18:43.949 --> 00:18:48.280
say, oh, this is definitely a traumatic. It's a

323
00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.550
traumatic scar tissue of racism because nobody in their

324
00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:54.750
right mind would want that kind of encounter, right?

325
00:18:55.189 --> 00:18:57.469
Um, IF somebody, if a black person wants to

326
00:18:57.469 --> 00:19:01.390
be racially humiliated, uh, then that could only come

327
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:05.189
from being, um, having been mistreated and having them.

328
00:19:05.969 --> 00:19:11.020
Trauma somehow warped their sexual desire, right? Um, AND

329
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.099
in fact, when um this play, slave play was

330
00:19:15.099 --> 00:19:19.420
first um shown in New York, it generated tremendous

331
00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.300
controversy, precisely because I think a lot of traumatophilic

332
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.109
art actually becomes quite controversial because we're not accustomed

333
00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:29.609
to thinking with trauma. Um, WE'RE only accustomed to

334
00:19:29.609 --> 00:19:32.930
thinking about trauma or about how trauma, how people

335
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.650
work through their trauma, or how they try to

336
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.369
get over it or how they try to heal

337
00:19:36.369 --> 00:19:41.520
it. Um, BUT what the example of this art

338
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.760
piece, but also the sexual practice of race play

339
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.640
forces us to think, um, I mean, if we

340
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.030
don't instinctively respond to it with a traumatrophobic, um,

341
00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:56.540
attitude of saying this is just, um, Kind of

342
00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.979
like the aftermath of trauma and people should not

343
00:19:58.979 --> 00:20:01.859
do it because that's a traumatic effect. It, it,

344
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.180
it calls upon us to ask about what different

345
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.579
kinds of relationships you one might for forge with

346
00:20:08.579 --> 00:20:13.420
their trauma. Like we tend to really appreciate subjects

347
00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.099
who have relationships with their trauma that are very

348
00:20:16.099 --> 00:20:20.119
much about commemoration or mourning or attending to their

349
00:20:20.119 --> 00:20:22.780
wounds. But, and this is one of the big

350
00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.339
arguments in the book that has to do with

351
00:20:24.339 --> 00:20:28.209
my concept of tramaophilia. The thing is we're also

352
00:20:28.209 --> 00:20:30.930
drawn to touch our wounds. We're drawn to relive

353
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.290
them. We're drawn to re-experience them, and that is

354
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:39.619
not as Some popular theory and some psychoanalytic theory

355
00:20:39.619 --> 00:20:42.060
would have it because we're stuck, because we're so

356
00:20:42.489 --> 00:20:46.339
stalled that we can't quite get over it, but

357
00:20:46.339 --> 00:20:51.180
also because there are intensities around traumatic experience, around

358
00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.170
the experience of rape, around the experience of a

359
00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.459
racial violation, around the experience of all kinds of

360
00:20:56.459 --> 00:20:59.109
violence that happen in our everyday lives that That

361
00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:03.760
are so powerfully imprinted on us that there is

362
00:21:03.969 --> 00:21:06.930
a draw sometimes to touch the wound and how

363
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:10.369
that wound is touched. I mean, that's often pathologized,

364
00:21:10.449 --> 00:21:13.410
right? Um, BUT how that wound is touched under

365
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.689
what conditions, what relational circumstances and that makes the

366
00:21:17.689 --> 00:21:22.760
difference um between a traumatic sequela and a traumatophilic

367
00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.170
engagement with trauma, um.

368
00:21:25.689 --> 00:21:29.979
So, uh, tell us then about consent, particularly from

369
00:21:29.979 --> 00:21:33.500
the perspective you apply in the book, what is

370
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.180
consent?

371
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:39.430
Mm. Well, consent in our everyday parlance, we usually

372
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.380
think about consent in the context of affirmative consent

373
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:47.390
where two, usually 2, sometimes more parties contract ahead

374
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:51.829
of time as to what will occur in within

375
00:21:51.829 --> 00:21:56.939
the perimeter of an interpersonal encounter. Consent Could be

376
00:21:56.939 --> 00:22:00.770
discussed in the context of um like a sexual

377
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.739
experience or in the context of all kinds of

378
00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:07.500
like even contractual obligations, um, and it starts with

379
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.739
the premise that you set some boundaries, the other

380
00:22:09.739 --> 00:22:13.459
person agrees to respect that bound those boundaries. If

381
00:22:13.459 --> 00:22:15.859
they cross them, they've violated your consent, and if

382
00:22:15.859 --> 00:22:18.900
they don't cross them, then that sets the conditions

383
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.439
in place for a good experience. Um, AND that's

384
00:22:22.439 --> 00:22:25.939
what we call affirmative consent, but affirmative consent is,

385
00:22:25.959 --> 00:22:27.719
is a concept I argue in the book that

386
00:22:27.719 --> 00:22:31.670
is useful only in very, very limited situations. Like,

387
00:22:31.719 --> 00:22:34.880
for example, in, in an, in an experience of

388
00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.400
a violent rape where somebody has said no and

389
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.880
the other person forces themselves, then obviously that's a

390
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.770
violation of affirmative consent that is, that is meaningful.

391
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.189
But consent has failed as a concept to help

392
00:22:47.189 --> 00:22:49.839
us adjudicate in the way that it promises and

393
00:22:49.839 --> 00:22:51.760
in the way that it is kind of a

394
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.430
cultural it is touted to be able to do.

395
00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.310
It fails to deliver on its promise to secure

396
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:05.839
good encounters, pleasurable encounters, ethical encounters, and one of

397
00:23:05.839 --> 00:23:07.680
the, there's many reasons for that, and many people

398
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.099
have written very uh smartly um. And cogently about

399
00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:14.619
why. But the thing that I focus on in

400
00:23:14.619 --> 00:23:17.060
my, in my book is to talk about how

401
00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.619
consent presumes that the person who's consenting or not

402
00:23:20.619 --> 00:23:23.900
consenting knows everything about themselves, and therefore they know

403
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.050
what they will want, what they will not want,

404
00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:31.050
um. Independently of how it arises, and that if

405
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.089
we go back to your earlier question about La

406
00:23:33.089 --> 00:23:35.650
Planche immediately comes up against the limit of how

407
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.250
there are things about ourselves that are opaque to

408
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.890
ourselves. So if we don't, if we never quite

409
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.989
can get to the bottom of who we are,

410
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:48.209
if we don't, if we can't always exactly predict

411
00:23:48.209 --> 00:23:51.199
what the full array of what we might want

412
00:23:51.199 --> 00:23:56.260
or not want. Then Then affirmative consent begins to

413
00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:00.180
kind of like fray. Um, THIS is not to

414
00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.619
say that you may not know you don't want

415
00:24:01.619 --> 00:24:03.939
like these 5 things, and if you say, I

416
00:24:03.939 --> 00:24:06.530
don't want them, and the other person does them,

417
00:24:06.579 --> 00:24:09.089
that you've been violated, nor is it to give

418
00:24:09.089 --> 00:24:12.729
a pass or an excuse for anybody to say,

419
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.859
well, I know you said no, but you really

420
00:24:14.859 --> 00:24:17.500
wanted it, which is a classic kind of like

421
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.449
rape, rapist, uh, and rape apologist kind of argument.

422
00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.869
It is to say that things arise in our

423
00:24:25.869 --> 00:24:29.439
encounters with others that open up appetites or make

424
00:24:29.439 --> 00:24:31.680
us curious or draw us in directions that we

425
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.199
may not quite anticipate as we're having this consent

426
00:24:35.199 --> 00:24:41.709
negotiations. And when these moments arrive, we make. We

427
00:24:41.709 --> 00:24:44.699
either give ourselves over to these moments and some

428
00:24:44.699 --> 00:24:47.010
sometimes we do, sometimes we don't. So I bring

429
00:24:47.349 --> 00:24:52.229
several examples in the book of how in an

430
00:24:52.229 --> 00:24:58.390
intersubjective moment. One might find themselves before a desire

431
00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.390
that is opening up in their body. For example,

432
00:25:00.439 --> 00:25:04.270
I speak about a patient who describes having gone

433
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.290
being kind of like in a sex club with

434
00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:10.790
his husband, and they are kind of like playing

435
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:16.229
around, and then this man, this really abject disgusting

436
00:25:16.229 --> 00:25:20.209
man. Walks into the room, and while my patient's

437
00:25:20.209 --> 00:25:24.560
husband walks away like appalled, my patient who's actually,

438
00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:27.180
this is not his sexual key, it's not his

439
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.250
sexual idiom, finds himself all of a sudden really

440
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:36.300
fascinated by this man. And decides to engage with

441
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.839
him in ways that go beyond how he understands

442
00:25:38.839 --> 00:25:43.280
his own self. So this gap between what you

443
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.599
think you bargained for in an encounter with another

444
00:25:45.599 --> 00:25:49.810
person. And what arrives and how you negotiate that

445
00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:56.770
distance. Like, let's say that you are before. Somebody

446
00:25:56.770 --> 00:26:01.640
who. Who opens up a certain kind of desire

447
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.319
for you, like a patient of mine described having

448
00:26:04.319 --> 00:26:08.119
negotiated very carefully a slap with her lover. They

449
00:26:08.119 --> 00:26:10.479
were doing an SM scene. Her lover was going

450
00:26:10.479 --> 00:26:14.439
to slap her. They negotiated all the details, and

451
00:26:14.439 --> 00:26:17.239
her lover slapped her. This is how she described

452
00:26:17.239 --> 00:26:20.680
it to me, exactly within the precisely within the

453
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.760
confines of what they had negotiated. Like she didn't

454
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.640
do anything that they had said. She had said

455
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.910
she didn't want her to do. But she said

456
00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:30.810
to me, and This is almost nearly a coach.

457
00:26:30.849 --> 00:26:32.890
She said, you know, but I thought that I

458
00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.010
had negotiated a mediocre slap. Like I thought she

459
00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:38.369
was gonna slap me, but then it was the

460
00:26:38.369 --> 00:26:40.530
exact right part of my face, the exact right

461
00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.810
amount of force. And my patient found herself feeling

462
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:46.650
overwhelmed with how, and this is her word, how

463
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:50.479
exquisite the slap was. Which she was not quite

464
00:26:50.479 --> 00:26:52.719
prepared for. So this is not exactly like being

465
00:26:52.719 --> 00:26:56.040
having her boundaries or her consent violated, right? And

466
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.400
yet she was so overwhelmed that she safe worded

467
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.439
because this distance between what she thought she was

468
00:27:01.439 --> 00:27:04.880
going to get and what arrived. And how that

469
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.739
which arrived really excited her in ways that she

470
00:27:08.739 --> 00:27:11.790
has been unprepared for was not something she was

471
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:14.109
willing to step into. So I'm beginning to talk

472
00:27:14.109 --> 00:27:16.150
now about a different kind of consent that has

473
00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:18.719
to do with consent that happens at the limits,

474
00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:22.160
like things that we would never quite. Um, BE

475
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.800
able to negotiate because that there, there are the

476
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.510
limits of what we ourselves can come up against

477
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:34.030
and limit consent really scrambles. This idea that in

478
00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:36.709
consent negotiations, there's one person who has power and

479
00:27:36.709 --> 00:27:39.709
another person who doesn't, which is how affirmative consent

480
00:27:39.709 --> 00:27:43.290
usually apportions things. In limit consent, there's also the

481
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.510
question of what kind of relationship you have with

482
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.270
yourself and what do you allow yourself to be

483
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.079
exposed to, which is at the limit of your

484
00:27:50.079 --> 00:27:52.500
understanding when my patient feels that this lap is

485
00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:55.829
exquisite. She doesn't quite know what she means by

486
00:27:55.829 --> 00:27:58.310
that or what the danger is of continuing to

487
00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:03.910
go or why all of a sudden, This unexpected

488
00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:08.349
sensation comes up and that's at the limit of

489
00:28:08.349 --> 00:28:10.829
her consent because she can't quite agree or not

490
00:28:10.829 --> 00:28:13.140
agree to it with it in a knowing way.

491
00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:15.150
She has to give herself over to something that

492
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:18.020
is more opaque in herself and in her partner,

493
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.030
and that is what she says no to.

494
00:28:20.979 --> 00:28:23.489
So, yeah, I was actually going to ask you

495
00:28:23.489 --> 00:28:28.170
particularly in cases of SM sadomasochism. Um, I mean,

496
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:32.770
is there any way of uh really determining what

497
00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:36.290
is, where the line, where the line is that

498
00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:41.050
separates consent from non-consensual behavior? Because, of course, as

499
00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:44.760
you said in that in that specific example, uh,

500
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:50.410
they have established some Particular limitations, but if, of

501
00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:53.890
course, uh, in particular context, it's, it might be

502
00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:59.939
hard for participants to really stay within particular, particular

503
00:28:59.939 --> 00:29:04.089
limitations. Uh, SO, uh, I mean, at what point

504
00:29:04.089 --> 00:29:07.689
does it go really, I guess, uh, we're using

505
00:29:07.689 --> 00:29:09.780
the title of your book Beyond Consent.

506
00:29:10.969 --> 00:29:13.560
Um, I really appreciate your question because it gives

507
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.020
me an opportunity to say that while the, the

508
00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.140
examples that I use right now draw from BDSM

509
00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.699
life, I'm using a method in the book that

510
00:29:23.699 --> 00:29:26.790
is actually a very Freudian method, like Freudian history

511
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:30.849
essays on sexuality says something about how he's looking

512
00:29:30.849 --> 00:29:33.180
at the margins, kind of like we might say

513
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.780
that BDSM sexuality is marginal, at least in the

514
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.380
statistical sense. I don't mean this in the pathologizing

515
00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.109
sense, right? That he's using, he's looking at the

516
00:29:42.109 --> 00:29:45.910
margins to understand more about the center. So, the

517
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.630
examples that I bring are not specific, even though

518
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.449
they draw from BDSM life. They don't just apply

519
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.469
to BDSM experiences. I bring them up to begin

520
00:29:55.469 --> 00:29:59.939
to introduce us to the notion that affirmative consent,

521
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.989
even in the most kind of like heterosexual, straight,

522
00:30:03.069 --> 00:30:09.380
vanilla encounters, is not quite the It's not quite

523
00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:13.430
as successful as it wants to be. So another

524
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.989
example that I bring is watching a mother and

525
00:30:15.989 --> 00:30:19.270
a child interact. And so here is like a

526
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:24.750
completely non BDSM extremely coidian kind of scene where

527
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.989
the daughter asks the mother to be the monster

528
00:30:26.989 --> 00:30:28.709
and to scare her, and they play this game

529
00:30:28.709 --> 00:30:31.180
for a while where She says, scare me. And

530
00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.540
the mother becomes like this ogre, and she starts

531
00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.660
chasing her, and she's making this fearful sounds, and

532
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.819
the girl is like, 00, and then the game

533
00:30:38.819 --> 00:30:41.540
is, when she says, stop, the mother stops. So

534
00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.459
the first part of the game proceeds along the

535
00:30:43.459 --> 00:30:46.739
lines of affirmative consent. Like the mother knows the

536
00:30:46.739 --> 00:30:48.780
line, she respects the line, and therefore, she has

537
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:53.099
her daughter's trust. But after, after going through some

538
00:30:53.099 --> 00:30:56.089
rounds of this kind of play, the daughter then

539
00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.219
says she seems kind of bored or sated with

540
00:30:59.219 --> 00:31:00.660
this kind of play and then she says, we'll

541
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.689
do something else. I told you to be the

542
00:31:02.689 --> 00:31:05.869
monster, you scare me. I tell you to stop,

543
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.209
but this time you don't stop. So this is

544
00:31:09.209 --> 00:31:11.369
kind of like a very, you know, anybody who

545
00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:14.329
has been around children and has kind of like

546
00:31:14.329 --> 00:31:16.609
tickled them or has been asked to play a

547
00:31:16.609 --> 00:31:20.199
game of tickling or scaring them or surprising them,

548
00:31:20.569 --> 00:31:23.609
knows that it's a very familiar kind of dynamic

549
00:31:23.609 --> 00:31:27.579
moment in the sense that it is. You know

550
00:31:27.579 --> 00:31:30.229
that things can go right very quickly because the

551
00:31:30.229 --> 00:31:32.939
scare me could go off the rails in a

552
00:31:32.939 --> 00:31:35.829
way that cannot be fully controlled ahead of time.

553
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.579
So what parents or adults usually do is like

554
00:31:38.579 --> 00:31:41.410
tone it down, then children will always tell us,

555
00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:43.459
no, but make it real. Like, I want you

556
00:31:43.459 --> 00:31:46.180
to really scare me, which speaks to how there

557
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.229
is almost a wish to be overwhelmed, but not

558
00:31:49.229 --> 00:31:51.699
to be damaged. I mean, to be overwhelmed and

559
00:31:51.699 --> 00:31:54.650
to be damaged are not the same thing. So,

560
00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.869
Here is to go back to connect that with

561
00:31:57.869 --> 00:32:01.819
the earlier example, here is an invitation for something

562
00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:04.270
to go beyond the bounds of what has been

563
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:08.939
contracted upon which the child, who of course is

564
00:32:08.939 --> 00:32:12.829
kind of like developmentally not fully um kind of

565
00:32:12.829 --> 00:32:17.310
like blossomed, is inviting something that they may or

566
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:20.900
not be able to handle. Right. As adults, we

567
00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.099
know that when we are in our encounters with

568
00:32:23.099 --> 00:32:25.540
children and we make decisions accordingly, like the mother

569
00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.699
might decide to not play that game, because she

570
00:32:27.699 --> 00:32:29.900
doesn't want things to go awry, or she might

571
00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.900
decide to play that game and come up with

572
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.729
an internal framework for how she will handle it.

573
00:32:35.239 --> 00:32:38.380
But I bring this example up to show that

574
00:32:38.619 --> 00:32:40.780
kind of like the question of the limit in

575
00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:46.579
consent is not just about extreme sexual practices or

576
00:32:46.579 --> 00:32:49.859
unconventional moments. This is a very everyday moment in

577
00:32:49.859 --> 00:32:51.969
the life of an adult who is parenting a

578
00:32:51.969 --> 00:32:54.459
child or who's a um grown-up figure in a

579
00:32:54.459 --> 00:32:58.420
child's life. That we come up against the limits

580
00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.010
of our consent all the time, and in fact,

581
00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:03.770
we flirt with those limits. Sometimes we provoke them

582
00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.040
because we sense that there's something beyond the limit

583
00:33:07.579 --> 00:33:10.939
that might be exciting or interesting or new or

584
00:33:10.939 --> 00:33:14.219
give us something that snaps us out of the

585
00:33:14.219 --> 00:33:17.729
ordinary, and that is a domain of a lot

586
00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:21.739
of intensity. And here we go back to the

587
00:33:21.739 --> 00:33:24.219
sexual, again, not a sexuality, but in a sense

588
00:33:24.219 --> 00:33:27.109
of disorder and perturbation that which cannot be fully

589
00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:33.469
controlled by meaning. But it's also frightening. So different

590
00:33:33.469 --> 00:33:36.270
subjects will take different, some, some children or some

591
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.949
adults would never play those games. But it is

592
00:33:38.949 --> 00:33:42.020
not only BDSM practitioners who want to play them,

593
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:45.869
and it says nothing disturbing about this child that

594
00:33:45.869 --> 00:33:48.829
she wants to play that game, right? There's, this

595
00:33:48.829 --> 00:33:50.739
is what I mean by being drawn to the

596
00:33:50.739 --> 00:33:53.030
wounds and being, being drawn to this sense of

597
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.569
overwhelm. Uh, THIS is how I use the term

598
00:33:55.569 --> 00:33:59.890
overwhelm in sexuality beyond consent to speak about. In,

599
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.260
in the, not it's in its usual way that

600
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.859
we use it as a noun, but it's in

601
00:34:04.859 --> 00:34:09.219
its adjectival form to speak uh I'm sorry, not

602
00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:11.649
in its usual adjectival form, but as a noun,

603
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.699
to speak about how we're drawn to states of

604
00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:17.529
overwhelm. Because that's also the place from which something

605
00:34:17.529 --> 00:34:21.608
new can arise. And this is what connects with

606
00:34:21.608 --> 00:34:24.447
what we're saying earlier about doing things with trauma.

607
00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.688
And that's also, you know, doing things with trauma

608
00:34:27.688 --> 00:34:30.429
is always at the border of our consent because

609
00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:35.438
nobody quite wants that kind of disturbance fully 100%,

610
00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.489
and yet we're also drawn to this kind of

611
00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:41.810
dysregulation in a way that is not necessarily pathological

612
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.879
but also court's new experience.

613
00:34:44.908 --> 00:34:48.018
Right. But I was also trying to understand from

614
00:34:48.018 --> 00:34:53.697
a clinical perspective, I mean, this consent or practices

615
00:34:53.697 --> 00:34:57.458
that go beyond consent inform or should inform in

616
00:34:57.458 --> 00:35:02.299
any way how we pathologize or not pathologize certain

617
00:35:02.299 --> 00:35:05.688
kinds of behaviors. I mean, to what extent might

618
00:35:05.898 --> 00:35:09.138
this sort of framework or way of thinking about

619
00:35:09.138 --> 00:35:12.888
consent inform the clinical approaches?

620
00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.479
I think quite a bit, but not in the

621
00:35:15.479 --> 00:35:20.219
way that it's usually used, so, um. It would

622
00:35:20.219 --> 00:35:25.300
be very, very ordinary in a therapeutic situation to

623
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.699
try to ascertain whether the patient consented to something

624
00:35:27.699 --> 00:35:30.179
or not and use that as a criterion to

625
00:35:30.179 --> 00:35:33.659
determine if the encounter was a good encounter or

626
00:35:33.659 --> 00:35:39.560
a bad encounter. Um, BUT Paradoxically, even the secondolytic

627
00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.760
encounter, even the therapeutic encounter materializes at the border

628
00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.320
of the patient's consent. And what I mean, just

629
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.520
to give you another example of like how ordinary

630
00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:53.120
limit consent is like a patient who walks into

631
00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.719
my office for the first time and says to

632
00:35:55.719 --> 00:35:58.239
me, how do you work or what are we

633
00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:00.780
going to do here? I mean, I can say

634
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.179
something as basic as we're going to talk about

635
00:36:03.179 --> 00:36:05.899
your feelings or we're going to think about patterns

636
00:36:05.899 --> 00:36:07.540
or I'm gonna try to help you. I mean,

637
00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.379
these are not things that I say precisely because

638
00:36:10.379 --> 00:36:13.899
I think that they say nothing. I mean, it's

639
00:36:13.899 --> 00:36:16.580
not until after a treatment has started and is

640
00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:20.060
well underway that that those original statements can even

641
00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.659
mean something to the patient. So, the patient, for

642
00:36:23.659 --> 00:36:26.790
example, comes in and says, you know, I have

643
00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:30.209
Trouble staying in relationships. I keep dating the same

644
00:36:30.209 --> 00:36:32.050
kind of person. I keep having the same kind

645
00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:34.530
of breakup. I need to understand what's going on

646
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:38.399
with myself. I also have some traumatic history in

647
00:36:38.399 --> 00:36:40.290
my past. I don't want to talk about that.

648
00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.610
I just want to talk about what happens in

649
00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:46.610
my relationships. Now, from a consent perspective, if somebody

650
00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:48.570
doesn't want to talk about something, obviously, you're not

651
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:53.360
going to like push them. But from a psychic

652
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.159
perspective, the question of whether there are connections between

653
00:36:56.159 --> 00:36:59.199
the constant breaking up of relationships and that traumatic

654
00:36:59.199 --> 00:37:02.800
past, for example, if somebody was incested, and now

655
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.120
that creates problems with trust, and then every relationship

656
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.159
that they're in it so they're so distrustful that

657
00:37:09.159 --> 00:37:11.830
the other person kind of like eventually leaves them

658
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.570
or if they're constantly attracted to people who, or

659
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.840
if they become overly controlling with their partners because

660
00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.270
they're so afraid of being hurt. Obviously, these links

661
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:25.909
are there. But any, any analyst who says to

662
00:37:25.909 --> 00:37:28.350
a patient, well, you think they're not connected, but

663
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.429
I think they're connected, imposes something that you actually

664
00:37:31.429 --> 00:37:32.870
don't know it's true you don't know if it's

665
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:34.750
connected or not, but you may find out that

666
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.659
it is. Neither can you say to somebody, look,

667
00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:40.270
from all my years of experience and everything I've

668
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:42.629
read, I can tell you that it's possible that

669
00:37:42.629 --> 00:37:44.629
they're connected because the person is telling you, I

670
00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:46.830
don't want to talk about this. So you start

671
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:50.510
the treatment. In, in a, in a very paradoxical

672
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.429
place of limit consent where you have kind of

673
00:37:53.429 --> 00:37:55.790
like a very serious intention to respect that limit,

674
00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:58.149
but also hope that in the course of the

675
00:37:58.149 --> 00:38:01.590
work, as the patient trusts you, as the relationship

676
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.709
develops, as things open up in the treatment, and

677
00:38:04.709 --> 00:38:06.449
as they begin to feel perhaps a little bit

678
00:38:06.449 --> 00:38:10.310
less scared, or perhaps they begin to sense the

679
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:12.949
contours of what the connections might be, something that

680
00:38:12.949 --> 00:38:17.489
was off limits at the beginning becomes possible to

681
00:38:17.489 --> 00:38:21.219
discuss. So to some degree, even a patient who

682
00:38:21.219 --> 00:38:23.169
says, I want to talk about this, but not

683
00:38:23.169 --> 00:38:25.459
about that, on some level may sense that there's

684
00:38:25.459 --> 00:38:28.060
a connection. Whether that's accurate or not, you're gonna

685
00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.500
find out, you can't know. So they're already setting

686
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:37.020
the line, hoping that The the explicit communication is,

687
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.649
I don't want to talk about this with you,

688
00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.300
and that of course will always be respected, unless

689
00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.340
things change in the way that it was describing.

690
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.729
But I think this is also a negotiation with

691
00:38:46.729 --> 00:38:49.090
themselves, like I'm here to do this and not

692
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:54.939
that. But no therapeutic encounter, just like no relationship

693
00:38:54.939 --> 00:38:57.300
works like that, you know, like people get in

694
00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.139
relationships all the time where they say, I want

695
00:38:59.139 --> 00:39:02.250
this but not that. But then you, you fall

696
00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:04.739
in love or you trust the person or something

697
00:39:04.739 --> 00:39:06.780
changes in you, and this thing that you said

698
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.739
you didn't want now becomes perhaps something you want,

699
00:39:09.969 --> 00:39:11.820
perhaps something that you don't love, but you're not

700
00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:15.340
willing to do. So even the notion that you're

701
00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.439
willing to do things that you don't want completely

702
00:39:18.439 --> 00:39:22.959
countermands the premise of affirmative consent, which is this

703
00:39:22.959 --> 00:39:26.520
notion of ongoing enthusiasm. I mean, how many ongoingly

704
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.159
enthusiastic things do we do in our everyday lives?

705
00:39:29.199 --> 00:39:31.870
I mean, work is one such good example. One

706
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:34.149
could not say that they're not consenting to work,

707
00:39:34.479 --> 00:39:36.560
but we're not actually consenting to work in an

708
00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.800
ongoing and enthusiastic way. Sometimes you just have to

709
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.840
go to work because the circumstances are such that

710
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.750
you have to show up. So there's, you know,

711
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.110
I'm giving all these different examples between work, between

712
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:50.989
the therapeutic situation, like the mother-child situation, to show

713
00:39:50.989 --> 00:39:54.270
that limit consent is not an exceptional condition that

714
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:57.949
applies only in some circumstance. It actually, like, I

715
00:39:57.949 --> 00:40:00.389
would say that affirmative consent, except in very few

716
00:40:00.389 --> 00:40:03.429
circumstances is a scam. I mean, to put this

717
00:40:03.429 --> 00:40:06.590
very bluntly, and that most of consent has to

718
00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.590
do with the, with the, with limit consent and

719
00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:12.000
with what it comes means to come up. Against

720
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.520
the limit of what you had thought or have

721
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:18.649
found bearable in yourself, and then you make kind

722
00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:20.800
of like you tilt in different directions in terms

723
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.270
of how you negotiate that.

724
00:40:23.219 --> 00:40:25.899
Mhm. So there are 2 more topics I would

725
00:40:25.899 --> 00:40:28.290
like to ask you about. One of them, I

726
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:31.760
think you sort of touched slightly on it earlier

727
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.280
when we were talking about uh traumatopilia and how,

728
00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:39.159
and the different kinds of manifestations of it in

729
00:40:39.159 --> 00:40:42.379
the domain of sexuality. So, how does all of

730
00:40:42.379 --> 00:40:45.040
these relate to what in the book you call

731
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.840
racialization, and what is racialization even?

732
00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:53.129
Yeah. I mean, the term racialization, I used to

733
00:40:53.129 --> 00:40:57.320
describe um the ways by which we become raced

734
00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:03.189
and We become raced not just through the lineages

735
00:41:03.189 --> 00:41:05.629
into which we're born or kind of like the

736
00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:09.149
pigment of our skin or our physiognomy, like, I

737
00:41:09.149 --> 00:41:11.270
mean, these are the, these were the premises of

738
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.709
the racial sciences of that, and I'm putting racial

739
00:41:13.709 --> 00:41:16.590
sciences in quotes here because there were also racist

740
00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:19.429
sciences of the 19th century, the idea that there's

741
00:41:19.429 --> 00:41:22.189
a way to tell what race a person belongs

742
00:41:22.189 --> 00:41:27.300
to racialization also has to do with how different

743
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:31.290
um Kind of like features are and not just

744
00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:35.850
physical features, but also uh social features, psychic features

745
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:40.929
are being understood in each society. For example, um

746
00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.600
like a Mexican, I have a colleague who is

747
00:41:44.129 --> 00:41:46.889
considered to be a white Mexican in Mexico, which

748
00:41:46.889 --> 00:41:48.780
is where he comes from, but he's a very

749
00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.770
racialized subject in in uh in Northern America, which

750
00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.899
is where he lives. So this speaks to the

751
00:41:55.899 --> 00:41:58.889
mobility of racialization that race is not a static

752
00:41:58.889 --> 00:42:00.899
thing, which is not the same thing as to

753
00:42:00.899 --> 00:42:03.489
say that we choose it or that we selected

754
00:42:03.489 --> 00:42:05.340
or that we have that kind of agency over

755
00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:09.550
it. And I speak about racialization specifically in the

756
00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:12.840
context of race play, um, and speak about it

757
00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:17.149
in terms of how race, um, we were talking

758
00:42:17.149 --> 00:42:21.229
earlier about how in the encounter with another person's

759
00:42:21.229 --> 00:42:25.310
foreigners, one has, one is with that traumatic encounter,

760
00:42:25.429 --> 00:42:28.709
one has to translate. And what we usually translate

761
00:42:28.709 --> 00:42:30.100
through and this is something that I go over

762
00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.179
in sexuality beyond consent in great detail. The way

763
00:42:33.179 --> 00:42:35.669
in which we make meaning out of the other

764
00:42:35.669 --> 00:42:39.139
person's, um, out of the encounter with the other

765
00:42:39.139 --> 00:42:43.379
person's excessive excess and foreignness to us is by

766
00:42:43.379 --> 00:42:46.580
drawing on codes and meanings from the meta symbolic

767
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:51.989
world. In order to attach this foreigners to presentation.

768
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:59.189
Um, SO, race, gender, um, like different kinds of

769
00:42:59.189 --> 00:43:00.860
myths that we have in our cultures like the

770
00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:04.179
Oedipus myth are ways in which we give meaning,

771
00:43:04.219 --> 00:43:07.090
we give a shape to the formlessness of this

772
00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:10.540
encounter with another person's sexual unconscious. And as we

773
00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:15.300
give shape, the other elements, the other forces that

774
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:21.149
have already organized these categories. Also shape us. Here's

775
00:43:21.149 --> 00:43:23.699
what I mean by that, that if that when

776
00:43:23.699 --> 00:43:27.969
we give meaning through racialized categories, racialized categories also

777
00:43:27.969 --> 00:43:30.860
have in them the violence of racism. There is

778
00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.340
no category of race without racism, just like there

779
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.659
is no category of gender without the notion of

780
00:43:36.659 --> 00:43:40.169
gender difference, and the, and that immediately calls upon

781
00:43:40.169 --> 00:43:43.040
the hierarchy of gender difference or the gender binary.

782
00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:46.580
So every such code that we use to respond

783
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.409
to the traumatic incursion of the other on us.

784
00:43:50.899 --> 00:43:57.610
Is also. Infiltrated by these regimes of power and

785
00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:01.729
these entire worldviews, so you use a code to

786
00:44:01.729 --> 00:44:04.639
make meaning of something and in making that meaning

787
00:44:04.639 --> 00:44:08.290
you also constitute your own ego. And now all

788
00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:10.879
of these relations of power are part of your

789
00:44:10.879 --> 00:44:14.209
own ego constitution, not because you inherited them, not

790
00:44:14.209 --> 00:44:16.570
because you internalize them, but through this strange act

791
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:19.770
of agency through which you respond to the trauma

792
00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:25.750
of this enigmatic. Um, A fraction of the other

793
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:30.229
intrusion of the other by drawing on the meta

794
00:44:30.229 --> 00:44:36.270
symbolic. So one's own racialization, one's own gendering, one's

795
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:42.750
own understanding of oneself is not separate from. All

796
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:46.510
of these um regimes of power. And that's different

797
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:48.429
than saying, look, we are who we are, we're

798
00:44:48.429 --> 00:44:50.669
born into the world, and then the world imposes

799
00:44:50.669 --> 00:44:53.020
itself on us, telling us this is a good

800
00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.550
race, this is a bad race, this is a

801
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:57.330
good gender, this is a bad gender. And then

802
00:44:57.909 --> 00:45:00.030
you have like a layering of that kind of

803
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:02.510
like pollutant on top of who you are. This

804
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:04.949
is to say that that pollutant becomes part of

805
00:45:04.949 --> 00:45:07.310
how you constitute yourself. So it's, it's very much

806
00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:09.969
at the core of your ego. So that no

807
00:45:09.969 --> 00:45:14.580
amount of education or training or DEI initiative can

808
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:20.649
Educate you differently, like you really have to. Recon

809
00:45:20.649 --> 00:45:24.479
to unconstitute and reconstitute yourself. It's only these encounters

810
00:45:24.479 --> 00:45:28.399
that overwhelm us that break us down that happen

811
00:45:28.399 --> 00:45:30.320
at the limit of our consent that we stand

812
00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.479
a chance to come undone in the way that

813
00:45:32.479 --> 00:45:35.600
we may become redone differently and come back these

814
00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.399
are parts of the stakes of this book.

815
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:41.439
Right. So, one last topic I want to ask

816
00:45:41.439 --> 00:45:43.840
you about, which is something you also focus on

817
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.270
in the book, I think that toward the end,

818
00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:48.760
uh, earlier, I've asked you a little bit about

819
00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:53.600
BDSM and particularly the last two letters, SM7omasochism. But

820
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:57.199
now, I would like to focus specifically on sadism

821
00:45:57.199 --> 00:46:00.580
and on the topic or the current, I, I

822
00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.899
think that there are different currents, the current of

823
00:46:02.899 --> 00:46:07.179
exigent sadism. So what can we learn about say

824
00:46:07.179 --> 00:46:11.419
this more broadly and exigent saving more specifically through

825
00:46:11.419 --> 00:46:14.169
the framework that you bring into your book?

826
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:18.360
This is, uh, this is a really um important

827
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.840
question and a really complicated one. IT'S actually so

828
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:26.399
complicated that I, I came to realize how important

829
00:46:26.399 --> 00:46:28.239
it was to this book only as I was

830
00:46:28.239 --> 00:46:29.899
finishing the book, so then I had to go

831
00:46:29.899 --> 00:46:32.000
back and rewrite some of it and add another

832
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.280
chapter, so the book ends with sadism, and I

833
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.760
found it to be so important that I'm now

834
00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.040
writing a book that is only on sadisms, um.

835
00:46:40.679 --> 00:46:42.219
So I'm gonna try to say that I'm saying

836
00:46:42.219 --> 00:46:43.659
all of this background to say this is very

837
00:46:43.659 --> 00:46:45.739
complicated. I'm gonna try to say this in a

838
00:46:45.739 --> 00:46:49.580
concise way. Um, SO sadism is a word that

839
00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:52.699
usually frightens us, and for good reason, uh, in

840
00:46:52.699 --> 00:46:54.820
the way that we use the word today, it's

841
00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:58.939
usually understood to mean the equivalent of like some

842
00:46:58.939 --> 00:47:05.129
barbaric action or some monstrous, um, violation. The word

843
00:47:05.129 --> 00:47:08.729
sadism, however, starts with the Marquis dear. Uh, I

844
00:47:08.729 --> 00:47:13.580
mean, it's used by um Um, um, a raft

845
00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.500
bon ebbing for the first time in Psychopathia Sexualis,

846
00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.899
but it is sourced from the figure of the

847
00:47:18.899 --> 00:47:24.939
Marques dean, who wrote a series of philosophical and

848
00:47:24.939 --> 00:47:29.179
pornographic novels. Um, WHERE there was a lot of

849
00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:31.939
pornography, uh, and this is one of the reasons

850
00:47:31.939 --> 00:47:33.820
why he was confined for the majority of his

851
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.939
life. He lived during the time of the French

852
00:47:35.939 --> 00:47:39.780
Revolution. But strangely, in the midst of like these

853
00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:43.739
orgies and this like really bizarre and sometimes quite

854
00:47:43.739 --> 00:47:48.500
murderous and, uh, horrific sexual debauches, as he calls

855
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.699
them, that are happening, his main characters stop and

856
00:47:51.699 --> 00:47:55.620
start philosophizing for pages and pages and pages and

857
00:47:55.620 --> 00:48:00.010
give us Um, a kind of political theory that

858
00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.580
speaks about the abuses of the state, the abuses

859
00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:06.260
of church, um, the, the ways in which state

860
00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:09.820
power and violence go together, and is in that

861
00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:14.899
sense quite contemporary.A is also really interested in the

862
00:48:14.899 --> 00:48:17.419
ways in which the sexual and the violent always

863
00:48:17.419 --> 00:48:22.310
co-occur. And he's taken up in kind of like

864
00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:25.669
political in some political theory through Bata Foucault is

865
00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:28.870
very, Michel Foucault is very influenced by him and

866
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:31.639
then certainly in the beginning of the 20th century

867
00:48:31.639 --> 00:48:35.350
by the surrealists who are very inspired by what

868
00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:38.209
he's doing with questions of representation and violence in

869
00:48:38.209 --> 00:48:43.639
the erotic. So, The concept of sadism has many,

870
00:48:43.689 --> 00:48:49.790
many facets, including political possibility, uh, erotic complexity, um,

871
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:54.679
this co-emergence of the sexual with the violent, um,

872
00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:56.929
and all of these are on the table, but

873
00:48:56.929 --> 00:48:59.959
when World War 2 happens and after the Holocaust.

874
00:49:01.489 --> 00:49:05.969
Um, THROUGH Adorno and Horkheimer, through Jacques Lacan's reading

875
00:49:05.969 --> 00:49:09.899
of sad. We have a turn, and World War

876
00:49:09.899 --> 00:49:12.620
II gives us the meaning of the word sadism

877
00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.659
that is canonized today. So if you don't know

878
00:49:14.659 --> 00:49:17.709
all of that history, which most people don't, uh,

879
00:49:17.739 --> 00:49:22.300
it's, it's partly because, um, after World War II,

880
00:49:22.409 --> 00:49:26.739
SAD is used by theorists of the Holocaust to

881
00:49:26.739 --> 00:49:29.500
help us understand the monstrosities that happened in the

882
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.290
camps uh with the extermination of Jewish people. And

883
00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:36.020
there we get a flattening of sadism into meaning

884
00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:39.669
just one thing, like it becomes synonymous with barbarism.

885
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:44.570
It becomes synonymous with um just like brute cruelty

886
00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:48.669
and violence that stops at nothing. So what I

887
00:49:48.669 --> 00:49:50.629
would what I've been trying to do and what

888
00:49:50.629 --> 00:49:52.750
I'm doing in my next book is open up

889
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:55.030
what I call the found of sadisms to reveal

890
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:58.820
the many pleats and many other possibilities of sadism,

891
00:49:59.189 --> 00:50:02.389
and to talk specifically in sexuality beyond consent, I

892
00:50:02.389 --> 00:50:06.469
end with speaking about exigent sadism, about the exigence.

893
00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:11.110
Of that comes with confronting things at the limits

894
00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:14.750
of their representation, perhaps breaking through kind of like

895
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:18.350
the dialectic that Hegel gives us when he talks

896
00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:21.639
about uh thesis antithesis and then synthesis where the

897
00:50:21.639 --> 00:50:26.149
synthetic result is always the move towards progress. That

898
00:50:26.149 --> 00:50:29.060
certainly history has not proved to be the case,

899
00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:33.479
um. To, to speak about a kind of um

900
00:50:33.479 --> 00:50:37.260
sadism that is an offering and actually involves a

901
00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.979
vulnerability for the sadist, which is a very strange

902
00:50:39.979 --> 00:50:43.300
thing to say or hear. Like it sounds immediately

903
00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:45.899
counterintuitive because we're so used to thinking about sadism

904
00:50:45.899 --> 00:50:50.020
as this bad um kind of like violence that

905
00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:54.340
is done to the other. So, my, um, my

906
00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:57.179
project is very much about helping us think about

907
00:50:57.179 --> 00:50:59.500
what it means to be confronted with things that

908
00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:05.330
challenge us. We think that really might even precipitate

909
00:51:05.489 --> 00:51:07.770
the kind of crisis of overwhelmed that we were

910
00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:11.889
describing earlier, the kind of crisis that might deliver

911
00:51:11.889 --> 00:51:14.729
us if we step into our own limit consent.

912
00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:18.239
Deliver us to the possibility of becoming undone and

913
00:51:18.239 --> 00:51:22.149
redone, and we are so frightened as human beings

914
00:51:22.149 --> 00:51:25.469
culturally too, but like the ego does not want

915
00:51:25.469 --> 00:51:27.270
itself to be deposed. It doesn't want to come

916
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:30.469
undone. So the ego, our ego will do everything

917
00:51:30.469 --> 00:51:33.909
to keep itself stable and to preserve itself. So

918
00:51:33.909 --> 00:51:36.750
a different kind of force is required for it

919
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:39.790
to surrender its dominion over the psyche and to

920
00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:42.320
follow the exigency of the unconscious to follow this

921
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.219
opacity. That we were talking about earlier, to which

922
00:51:45.219 --> 00:51:47.830
it's also drawn, we, we're talking earlier about the

923
00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:49.899
draw to the uh to overwhelm or the draw

924
00:51:49.899 --> 00:51:52.379
to our wounds. There's a draw, but there's also

925
00:51:52.379 --> 00:51:55.570
like a reservation or a conservation of psychic energy.

926
00:51:55.969 --> 00:51:59.159
Action and sadism takes the risk, and it's a

927
00:51:59.159 --> 00:52:02.560
risk. It's a risk for the sadist and it's

928
00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.639
a risk for the person receiving it, of daring

929
00:52:05.639 --> 00:52:09.159
into these territories where we're not constituted and safe,

930
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.310
and we're not preserving ourselves, but where we risk

931
00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:14.689
ourselves. And I have a lot to say in

932
00:52:14.689 --> 00:52:18.959
sexuality beyond consent about what kinds of transformative experience

933
00:52:18.959 --> 00:52:21.889
can come out of that. And in, in my

934
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:25.409
forthcoming work, I'm talking also about the political possibilities

935
00:52:25.409 --> 00:52:28.080
on the level of political philosophy of what can

936
00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.250
come out of the state of overwhelm and kind

937
00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:33.399
of like the potentiality of crisis, um.

938
00:52:34.689 --> 00:52:38.100
Great. So, the book is against sexuality beyond consent,

939
00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.139
risks, race, stromatophilia. I'm leaving a link to it

940
00:52:41.139 --> 00:52:44.580
in the description of this interview. And Doctor Sekketopolo,

941
00:52:44.719 --> 00:52:47.580
just before we go apart from the book, where

942
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:50.300
