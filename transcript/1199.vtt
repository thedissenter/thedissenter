00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.039
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:06.179
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:09.010
today I'm joined by Dr. Jason Clark. He is

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.140
a lecturer in psychology in the university, in the

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.779
School of Human and Social Sciences at the University

6
00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.059
of West London. And today we're talking about his

7
00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:24.440
book Constructing Experience, Expectation and Attention in Perception. So

8
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.440
Doctor Clark, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure

9
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.079
to everyone.

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.440
Thank you, Ricardo. It's a pleasure to be on.

11
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.418
I've watched lots of your, uh, episodes and podcasts

12
00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:34.810
with lots of really interesting people and and they're

13
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.299
very stimulating, so it's great to be part of

14
00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:38.560
that now. Yeah.

15
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.029
Thank you. Thank you so much. So tell us

16
00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:47.419
first about the predictive processing framework and how the

17
00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:49.520
brain is a predictive machine.

18
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.509
Yeah, great. OK. I think maybe the best way

19
00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:57.830
into this is to think about what the brain

20
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.610
is, uh, where it is and what the world

21
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.069
is, right? So, you know, human beings got brains,

22
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.790
they're encased in these bony skulls, and these brains

23
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.910
are fed sensory information through various channels, through visual

24
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.050
channels, through Um, auditory channels through the skin, etc.

25
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.790
ALL this sensory information coming into the body and

26
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.260
into the nervous system and into the brain. But

27
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.110
there's a fundamental problem that the brain has, right?

28
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.580
The brain is this, uh, you know, 80 billion

29
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.190
or so massive cells inside the skull. And from

30
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.150
within that kind of closed skull, it has to

31
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.339
somehow Understand the world beyond it, right? So, uh,

32
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.410
and if it doesn't do that, then it's gonna

33
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.839
pretty much die very quickly. So, it, it, so,

34
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.739
in order to do that, the brain, it seems,

35
00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.540
from theory, builds this kind of internal model of

36
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.940
what it thinks. And again, I use it thinks,

37
00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:59.059
it's not thinking in the sense that it's consciously

38
00:01:59.059 --> 00:02:01.139
thinking this, but what is it, what it, what

39
00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:04.860
it's inferring the outside world to be. In other

40
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.199
words, what it's inferring the Causes of the sensory,

41
00:02:10.288 --> 00:02:15.039
uh, the, the, the, uh, outside world impinging on

42
00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.800
the senses, it kind of infers what the causes

43
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.440
of those are. And that's our brain's kind of

44
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.639
world model, what it believes is happening around us

45
00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.639
now in terms of, you know, sound and smell

46
00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.110
and taste and touch and objects, that kind of

47
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.240
thing. So, in other words, it's a kind of

48
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.639
simulation. Of what it thinks the world is. And

49
00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.949
we are living inside that sim simulation. So the

50
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.679
predictive brain hypothesis is basically saying that that's what

51
00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:47.399
the brain is doing. It's, um, given these limitations,

52
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.479
given that it is in this situation where it

53
00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.210
doesn't have You know, it can't step out of

54
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.770
outside of itself to see what the world is

55
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.220
really like. It has to use the evidence provided

56
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.259
by the senses to build up this model of

57
00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:02.500
what it thinks the world is. So, what it

58
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.899
does is it uses, uh, predictions, learned from past

59
00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:14.080
experience, uh, plus this sensory information coming in to

60
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.979
build this model. And the model is constantly refined,

61
00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.300
so the brain is constantly learning. Because sometimes the

62
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.889
model makes mistakes, it gets things wrong, and then

63
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.949
it can correct those mistakes, uh, via the information

64
00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.470
coming through the sensory channels which serve as prediction

65
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.509
errors. So they, um, if the model contradicts what's

66
00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:40.660
coming in through the senses, then the model updates.

67
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.470
And this is what we call prediction error minimization.

68
00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.550
And the, uh, the aim of the brain, I

69
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.990
suppose, again, using, you know, uh, Perhaps not, I

70
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.949
shouldn't use the aim, but the, it seems the

71
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.690
function of the brain is to kind of build

72
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.630
this model that enables us to kind of survive,

73
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.910
enables us to, uh, maintain our existence despite, you

74
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.509
know, the, uh, you know, the kind of second

75
00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:06.309
law of thermodynamics entropy trying to kind of break

76
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:09.860
us down. We're trying to resist that. Um, ANYWAY,

77
00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.990
so that's what, uh, the predictive brain is, and

78
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.798
it's been, um, you know, uh, Uh, written about

79
00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:20.279
by people like Karl Friston and Andy Clark and

80
00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.899
Jacob Howie and Anil Seth among many, many others.

81
00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:26.959
Um, YEAH, so that's, that's, that's what the predictive

82
00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:27.600
brain is.

83
00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:31.459
So tell us a little bit more about the

84
00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:36.140
prediction errors you mentioned there. How are they generated

85
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.459
and how are they minimized?

86
00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:42.660
Yeah, good. So, when we look at the world,

87
00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:44.209
let me think of an example. So when we

88
00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:47.940
look at the world, um, and let's say we

89
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.640
are. I can't think of an example, in a

90
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.390
park, and maybe, uh, so when we're in the

91
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.559
park, we have a lot of expectations about what

92
00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:00.160
we're going to see in the park. So our

93
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.000
brain already kind of expects to see certain things

94
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.420
in the park. So we walk in the park

95
00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:08.850
and let's say we see a flash of white

96
00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:15.119
fur somewhere in the distance. And this is Highly

97
00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:19.730
ambiguous because that flash of white texture could have

98
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.640
come from many different objects in the world. So,

99
00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:25.410
it could be a fur coat, it could be

100
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.570
a dog, it could be a polar bear, it

101
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.929
could be many different things. And so, when you

102
00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:34.290
come into the park, maybe you have, because of

103
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.269
this world model of parks, you have the expectation

104
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.489
that you're going to see dogs, that kind of

105
00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:41.549
thing in the park. So when you see this

106
00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:48.910
flash of white texture, Uh, you. Uh, YOU predict

107
00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:52.130
that this is, uh, a dog. But maybe when

108
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.529
you get a bit closer, uh, You realize that

109
00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.459
it's not a dog, maybe there are some features

110
00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:02.059
of that creature that don't fit with your dog

111
00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:06.380
hypothesis, and you have to revise your hypothesis. So

112
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.940
now you realize, oh my God, it is a

113
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.500
polar bear, and what the hell is a polar

114
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.200
bear doing in the park? So it's highly surprising,

115
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.119
but this, uh, the fact that it is a

116
00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:17.640
polar bear and that the features don't match the

117
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.350
model of the dog that you have, these serve

118
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.200
as prediction errors, and these serve to update your

119
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.130
model of what's going on in the world. And

120
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.880
And the aim, I suppose, is for the brain

121
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.730
to minimize these prediction errors so that it gets

122
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.890
this, you know, the best model of the world

123
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.890
that it can given its epistemic situation of being

124
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.089
inside this bony skull. Um, SO yeah, that's, uh,

125
00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:48.690
so prediction errors are what serve to update the

126
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.529
model. So we have the model, which is our

127
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:55.660
brain's best interpretation of what's going on. Uh, AND

128
00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:59.540
information comes in through the senses. This information can

129
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.690
either align with the model, in which case there

130
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.040
is no error. Or it can misalign with the

131
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.329
model and, in which case it is, uh, uh,

132
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.209
it's, it doesn't align with the, the prediction, so

133
00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:14.130
it's called a prediction error, and in which case,

134
00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:15.970
then we update the, the brain would update the

135
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.970
model or the system would update the model, yeah.

136
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.540
And this model you are referring to is what

137
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.309
is called the generative model, correct?

138
00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:28.980
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So, the generative model is our

139
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.779
brain's, uh, world model, right? To unpack that, that

140
00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:36.779
means, uh, that we can think of it in

141
00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:41.239
terms of a hierarchy of predictions, going from very

142
00:07:41.239 --> 00:07:46.454
abstract levels to predictions about, so. Abstract levels, such

143
00:07:46.454 --> 00:07:51.454
as time flows or space is three dimensional, or

144
00:07:51.454 --> 00:07:55.255
objects, uh, can't exist, you know, two objects can't

145
00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:57.734
exist in one place at the same time, or

146
00:07:57.734 --> 00:08:02.255
light comes from above. These are beliefs, predictions that

147
00:08:02.255 --> 00:08:06.595
we have that are, if not hardwired, they're very,

148
00:08:06.804 --> 00:08:10.434
uh, we learn them very quickly and they become

149
00:08:10.434 --> 00:08:13.605
a real framework for how we understand the world

150
00:08:13.605 --> 00:08:16.239
and how we perceive the world. Uh, SO they're

151
00:08:16.239 --> 00:08:20.640
abstract, um, predictions. And then you come further down

152
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.279
in the hierarchy, you get to predictions about objects

153
00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:26.559
in the world, um, you know, and then you

154
00:08:26.559 --> 00:08:28.880
come further down in the hierarchy and you're getting

155
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.799
to the features of, of the world, the colors,

156
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.440
the motion, the textures, the, uh, edges of objects,

157
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.940
etc. And the idea is that, um, there's this

158
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.539
hierarchy of these cascading predictions from abstract through to

159
00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:48.859
sensory level predictions, and that's our world model. That's

160
00:08:48.859 --> 00:08:51.989
how we currently Perceive the world, think of the

161
00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:56.710
world, understand the world, but that is constrained by

162
00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.510
these, by the sens sensory information coming into the

163
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.780
senses, which if it conflicts with the model, then

164
00:09:03.989 --> 00:09:07.520
the model can be updated by these prediction errors.

165
00:09:07.969 --> 00:09:08.239
Yeah.

166
00:09:09.859 --> 00:09:12.900
OK, so let me ask you now, yes, you're

167
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.140
going to say something.

168
00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:16.200
No, I was gonna say, so that, yeah, that

169
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.640
is the generative model. It's, uh, you know, in

170
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.340
kind of simple terms, it's the, the, the model,

171
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.359
it's a kind of reality model, and I'm, I'm,

172
00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:25.919
I'm kind of, uh, kind of taking that from

173
00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:30.200
a recent paper by, uh, Lauanan, uh, Chandari and

174
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.039
Friston called A Beautiful Leap Theory of Consciousness, which

175
00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:36.520
what I say is a really interesting, uh, paper.

176
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.979
Um, BUT yeah, it's a reality model. It's our,

177
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.460
it's, it's what we're living now. This is reality.

178
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:45.179
This experience is my reality and, and current neuroscience,

179
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.840
the predictive brain, predictive processing theory says that, uh,

180
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.570
underlying this experience of reality I have is this,

181
00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:00.020
uh, hierarchical cascading, uh, system of predictions, which are

182
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.599
shaped by prediction errors.

183
00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:07.580
So in the book you also talk about consciousness

184
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.039
and we're going to explore here how consciousness might

185
00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:15.299
be linked to perception or how it is linked

186
00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:18.599
to perception. So first of all, what is consciousness?

187
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.119
How do you approach it?

188
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.849
Yeah, good question. So, OK, um, well, I think

189
00:10:26.849 --> 00:10:32.510
first, um, in the literature. Uh, IT'S typically spoken

190
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.770
of in terms of what is called phenomenal consciousness

191
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.059
and what is called access consciousness. So just to

192
00:10:40.059 --> 00:10:44.280
briefly explain what those two terms mean. So, Um

193
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:53.539
So phenomenal consciousness is the Uh, subjective experience of

194
00:10:53.539 --> 00:10:56.640
what it's like to be me now, right? So,

195
00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:59.130
uh, philosopher Thomas Nagel wrote a paper, I think

196
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.450
in 1974 called What, what is it like to

197
00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:05.179
be a bat, and he gave, uh, kind of

198
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.239
Definition, I suppose, of consciousness that is kind of,

199
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.770
that most people kind of adhere to, because it

200
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.289
seems to make intuitive sense, which is a system

201
00:11:13.289 --> 00:11:16.289
is conscious that there's something, if there is something

202
00:11:16.289 --> 00:11:19.770
that's, it is like to be that system. So,

203
00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.609
this system is something it's like to be this

204
00:11:22.609 --> 00:11:24.919
system. I don't think there's anything like it's like

205
00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:28.880
to be this system. Um, So, if there's something

206
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.690
that's like to be a system, then it's conscious.

207
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.650
So phenomenal consciousness is, uh, the qualitative experience of

208
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:40.270
redness, for example, or the felt experience of pain

209
00:11:40.409 --> 00:11:42.789
before you even think about it. It's just that

210
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.450
experience or if you drink coffee, the kind of

211
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.890
taste of coffee, or, uh, I don't know, the

212
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.969
smell of a rose or the sound of a,

213
00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:53.969
you know, harmonies being played on the piano, that

214
00:11:53.969 --> 00:11:58.729
qualitative. Thing that we can't quite grasp in physical

215
00:11:58.729 --> 00:12:02.239
terms, that's what we mean by phenomenal consciousness. So,

216
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.049
I, so that's one part of what consciousness is

217
00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:09.599
in the literature. The other is access consciousness, and

218
00:12:09.599 --> 00:12:10.969
the two are related, and I'll talk about that

219
00:12:10.969 --> 00:12:14.590
in a second, but access consciousness. Is more related

220
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:19.599
to, uh, function and behavior. So access consciousness, I

221
00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:21.729
mean, you can, you know, we can see how

222
00:12:21.729 --> 00:12:23.929
we could easily kind of build that really, not

223
00:12:23.929 --> 00:12:25.409
easily, but you could see how you could build

224
00:12:25.409 --> 00:12:27.929
that into, uh, you know, an AI or into,

225
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.489
you know, some other system. But access consciousness is

226
00:12:31.489 --> 00:12:35.530
what Sort of consciousness does, right? So, if we're

227
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.250
conscious, we report, I see an apple in front

228
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.770
of me, or we pay attention, or we integrate

229
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:46.609
information, or, uh, if we're conscious of something, it

230
00:12:46.609 --> 00:12:49.450
makes it available to all lots of other decision

231
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:55.030
making, memory systems, um. So all of that access

232
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.700
consciousness, we can, you know, study in, you know,

233
00:12:59.909 --> 00:13:04.549
functional physical term, using functional and physical terms, and,

234
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.030
uh, that all makes sense. And I think there

235
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.380
have been lots of efforts to kind of, uh,

236
00:13:12.489 --> 00:13:15.799
At least kind of develop theories, uh, where, um,

237
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:21.549
of access consciousness. Um, BUT they're kind of. The

238
00:13:21.549 --> 00:13:25.710
problem in science, the hard problem, uh, which, the

239
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.780
hard problem, which was, uh, first coined, I think,

240
00:13:28.789 --> 00:13:30.929
by David Chalmers in his book, The Conscious Mind,

241
00:13:30.989 --> 00:13:33.260
maybe just before, in a paper just before, uh,

242
00:13:33.429 --> 00:13:36.710
which is, um, you know, OK, maybe we can

243
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:41.270
understand how brains can be access conscious, how they

244
00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.229
can attend, how they can report, how they can

245
00:13:44.229 --> 00:13:46.770
integrate information, how they can make that information available

246
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:52.869
for decision making, for memory, um, And Theories like

247
00:13:52.869 --> 00:13:58.679
the global workspace theory by Dehane. And, uh, and,

248
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:04.000
uh, I think Nkash, um. Kind of our, our

249
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.270
the, I think our theories of access consciousness, right?

250
00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:09.080
But the, the, the problem is this phenomenal consciousness

251
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.780
is what it's like to be that we experience,

252
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:19.429
um, explain that in terms of. Neural activity, physical

253
00:14:19.429 --> 00:14:23.809
information processing, uh, it's that that is a hard

254
00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:27.039
problem to solve, yeah. So, uh, yeah, I hope

255
00:14:27.039 --> 00:14:28.599
I answered your question. So yes, we think, uh,

256
00:14:28.609 --> 00:14:30.010
in terms of what I think, what I think

257
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:36.210
consciousness is. Um, I mean, I, I, I'm a

258
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.200
bit of a maverick, I suppose. I kind of,

259
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.859
I, I don't, I, I, you know, I've been

260
00:14:41.859 --> 00:14:45.099
thinking for a long time about how physical processes

261
00:14:45.099 --> 00:14:47.979
can give rise to qualitative experience and like many

262
00:14:47.979 --> 00:14:52.210
people, I find myself kind of unable to. You

263
00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.090
know, this is a it's called the explanatory gap.

264
00:14:55.169 --> 00:14:58.130
We have all of neuroscience and information processing and

265
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.729
all this whir of information processing in the brain,

266
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.919
all these predictions, all this stuff going on, but,

267
00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:07.369
you know. We don't seem to be able to

268
00:15:07.369 --> 00:15:12.049
from that, uh, get, de juice, explain why this

269
00:15:12.049 --> 00:15:15.049
phenomenal consciousness exists, this what it's like to be.

270
00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:19.130
That's, that is the big, big problem. Yeah, yeah.

271
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.460
Right, and how are the contents of consciousness studied?

272
00:15:26.909 --> 00:15:28.950
Yes, that's a, yeah, that's a really good question.

273
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.869
So, I think, um, a kind of way into

274
00:15:32.869 --> 00:15:36.210
studying consciousness is to, and this was developed by

275
00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:41.429
Bernard Bars, is to create situations as an experimentalist.

276
00:15:41.469 --> 00:15:45.429
I'm an experimental psychologist, to create situations where you

277
00:15:45.429 --> 00:15:48.924
can manipulate whether somebody is conscious of something. Not

278
00:15:48.924 --> 00:15:51.645
conscious of something, right? So, you get a situation

279
00:15:51.645 --> 00:15:54.684
where under one condition, they're conscious of a stimulus,

280
00:15:54.885 --> 00:15:56.765
and in another condition, they're not conscious of the

281
00:15:56.765 --> 00:15:59.885
stimulus. And that allows you to kind of tease

282
00:15:59.885 --> 00:16:05.224
apart, uh, brain processes that are associated just with

283
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.020
Uh, you know, processing the stimulus on the screen

284
00:16:11.799 --> 00:16:16.080
without consciousness and processes that are involved with also

285
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.479
with, uh, you know. Processing the stimulus on the

286
00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.239
screen and being conscious of it. So, it gives

287
00:16:21.239 --> 00:16:23.919
you a way to kind of study those two

288
00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:26.080
things. And so this is, this is called the

289
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.280
contrastive method. So you're contrasting situations, conditions where participants

290
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.039
are, um, aware of the stimulus and situations where

291
00:16:34.039 --> 00:16:36.679
they're not aware of the stimulus. And a few

292
00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:40.340
examples of that, I suppose, are, um, for example,

293
00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:44.489
um, There are lots of examples. So binocular rivalry,

294
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:50.059
for example. So, uh, binocular rivalry is the, uh,

295
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:57.599
phenomenon where. Um, Uh, AGAIN, the participant is presented

296
00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:01.859
with one image to one eye, say, a house,

297
00:17:02.039 --> 00:17:04.920
and one image to another eye, say, uh, a

298
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.920
face. And, I mean, in typical, um, perception, we

299
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.800
are, we, you know, have one image on this

300
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.439
side and one image on this side, but they're

301
00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:15.800
just slightly different, and these depth mechanisms kind of

302
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.910
combine them and give, give us a sense of

303
00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.380
3D depth. Uh, BUT when the, when the two

304
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.588
images are, Uh, not congruent. So when there's a

305
00:17:25.588 --> 00:17:27.788
house and on one eye, and there's a face

306
00:17:27.788 --> 00:17:31.859
on one eye, then what happens is Uh, what's

307
00:17:31.859 --> 00:17:35.900
called binocular rivalry, which is where the perception that

308
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.579
the, uh, participant has kind of vacillates between seeing

309
00:17:39.579 --> 00:17:41.699
a house and then seeing a face. Sometimes a

310
00:17:41.699 --> 00:17:43.380
kind of mixture of the two, but it kind

311
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.300
of ultimately seems to kind of rest on house

312
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.900
or face. Um, And so that's one method we

313
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.640
can use to study consciousness because it allows us

314
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.819
to see, uh, what's going on in the brain

315
00:17:54.819 --> 00:17:57.420
in the brain when the participant is conscious of

316
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.500
seeing the house or the face, let's say, and

317
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.260
what's going on in the brain when they're not

318
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.699
conscious of seeing the house or the face. And

319
00:18:03.699 --> 00:18:05.949
so therefore you can kind of tease the two

320
00:18:05.949 --> 00:18:13.619
apart, right? Um, ANOTHER method is, um, Uh, um,

321
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.010
I think. So I don't want to talk about

322
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.359
inattentional blindness because I think we're going to be

323
00:18:17.359 --> 00:18:20.329
talking about intentional blindness in a bit, but yeah,

324
00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.170
but just very briefly, inattentional blindness is a way

325
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:27.810
to study consciousness because, um, so inattentional blindness is

326
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:33.849
the phenomenon where participants fail to report, uh, an

327
00:18:33.849 --> 00:18:36.489
object that's directly where they're looking at on the

328
00:18:36.489 --> 00:18:39.130
screen in most situations when their attention is not

329
00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.849
on that stimulus, that object on the screen, they

330
00:18:41.849 --> 00:18:45.800
miss it. And this is called. Uh, INATTENTIONAL blindness

331
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.979
and been thoroughly explored, uh, kind of initially by

332
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.680
Arrian Mack at the New School and Urban Rock,

333
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.420
who I think was at Berkeley at the time.

334
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.780
And, um, So, using an attentional bli blindness, we

335
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.859
can, and so if they're not attending to the

336
00:19:01.859 --> 00:19:05.699
stimulus, they won't, invariably won't notice it's there. They're

337
00:19:05.699 --> 00:19:07.900
not conscious of it. But if they are attending

338
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.819
to the stimulus, then they are aware that it's

339
00:19:09.819 --> 00:19:12.130
there. They're conscious of it. So, we have a

340
00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.699
situation where we have a situation where the participant

341
00:19:14.699 --> 00:19:17.699
is not conscious of the stimulus, and in the

342
00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:20.500
full attention, they are conscious of the stimulus. There's

343
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.550
lots of stuff you can do there to see,

344
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.310
you know, what's going on in the brain, for

345
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.069
example, when they are conscious of the stimulus versus

346
00:19:27.069 --> 00:19:29.260
what's going on when they're not. And that allows

347
00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.469
you to see, ah, this, this, uh, neural activity

348
00:19:32.469 --> 00:19:36.449
or this, uh, information processing, this is associated with

349
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.630
them consciously seeing it. And again, that gives you

350
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.270
a kind of grip on what's going on in

351
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.619
the brain when they're, Actually conscious of it versus

352
00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:46.520
when they're not.

353
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.069
OK, so let me get now into the topic

354
00:19:51.069 --> 00:19:56.349
of perception and attention. So starting with perception, what

355
00:19:56.349 --> 00:20:00.310
is perception and tell us about top down and

356
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.589
bottom up theories of perception.

357
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:09.780
Yeah, good. So, um, perception, um, I would say

358
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:16.130
is our brains, uh, Kind of best guess about

359
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:22.390
what's going on, right? Um, IT is our. As

360
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.750
I said earlier, our internal model of what we

361
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.550
think is going on beyond our bodies and inside

362
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:35.380
our bodies. And it is, um, You know, not

363
00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.109
just visual, so there's visual perception. So visual perception

364
00:20:38.109 --> 00:20:42.349
would include seeing colors, seeing shapes, seeing motion, seeing

365
00:20:42.349 --> 00:20:46.739
objects, seeing visual scenes, auditory perception, hearing sounds, hearing

366
00:20:46.739 --> 00:20:53.229
trumpets, um, tactile perception, so feeling velvet, feeling, uh,

367
00:20:53.689 --> 00:20:57.069
uh, wood, for example, feeling sandpaper. So again, this

368
00:20:57.069 --> 00:21:02.060
is our internal model of. The world. Our best

369
00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.300
guess is, again, I'm kind of speaking through a

370
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.699
kind of predictive processing framework, but our kind of

371
00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:10.290
best guess as to what the world is, um,

372
00:21:10.739 --> 00:21:16.859
and our perception is informed by our assumptions about

373
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:19.540
the world, our predictions about the world, our best

374
00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.060
guesses about the world, but these are kind of

375
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.209
reined in by the sensory information that's coming in

376
00:21:26.209 --> 00:21:29.819
through the senses. So, Uh, perception is our, our

377
00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:32.219
model of the world, but it's tethered to the

378
00:21:32.219 --> 00:21:35.199
senses. So we don't kind of lose touch with

379
00:21:35.979 --> 00:21:39.140
reality, let's say. And I think that, you know,

380
00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.819
again, we can talk about this a bit later,

381
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.780
but I think, um, Perception can be untethered to

382
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.469
reality. So, when you're asleep, for example, and you,

383
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.270
and you dream, so you're still experiencing then, but

384
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.939
this is experience kind of more or less untethered

385
00:21:55.939 --> 00:21:59.939
from the sensory, uh, you know, receptors. Um, SO

386
00:21:59.939 --> 00:22:02.550
the brain is kind of, uh, you know, making

387
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:06.410
up its own story without being reined in by

388
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.709
the world, by the information coming in through the

389
00:22:08.709 --> 00:22:12.800
senses. Um, SO yeah, that's what I think perception

390
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.680
is, yeah. Oh, and, and then, so what was

391
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.920
your second question? Yeah, and, and then top-down and

392
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.829
bottom-up processing,

393
00:22:19.079 --> 00:22:22.699
yeah, yeah, yeah, top-down and bottom-up theories of perception.

394
00:22:23.119 --> 00:22:30.560
Yeah, good. So, um. So When we're talking about

395
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.800
perception, we're talking about, uh, our brain's understanding of

396
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:42.119
the world. And this understanding. Can come from the

397
00:22:42.119 --> 00:22:44.199
world. In other words, it can come through the

398
00:22:44.199 --> 00:22:47.199
sensory information channels, in the case of, you know,

399
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.839
light or, or or sound or, um. But also,

400
00:22:52.989 --> 00:22:54.959
as I said before, the brain has this internal

401
00:22:54.959 --> 00:22:59.910
model of the world. So, We talk about two

402
00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.280
kinds of processes going on there. We talk about

403
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:08.270
bottom-up processes and top-down processes. So, roughly speaking, bottom-up

404
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.390
processes refers to the information coming in through the

405
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:18.030
senses and kind of traveling, metaphorically speaking, up and

406
00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:23.969
into the brain. And this, this, uh, bottom-up process,

407
00:23:24.189 --> 00:23:29.520
um, involves taking the sensory information. And processing it.

408
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.349
Uh, AND, um, there's a kind of feed forward

409
00:23:34.349 --> 00:23:39.099
sweep of information that comes in. Um, AND some

410
00:23:39.099 --> 00:23:41.130
people have thought that this is enough for the

411
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.260
brain to create perception, right? This bottom-up sweep of

412
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:50.250
information. But there's also, uh. This, these top-down processes

413
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:54.599
going on. And what these top-down processes are, are,

414
00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:02.560
again, loosely speaking, um, assumptions, beliefs, uh, expectations that

415
00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:09.290
your brain has about the world. And so, one

416
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:14.050
of these top-down assumptions might be that light comes

417
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.500
from above, right? And we see this in various

418
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.459
illusions. There's, I can't remember the name of it,

419
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.819
but there's, there's a, an illusion where you have,

420
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.729
uh, circles on the screen and circles, uh, are

421
00:24:26.729 --> 00:24:29.699
either, uh, light at the top and dark at

422
00:24:29.699 --> 00:24:33.979
the bottom. And the circles on the screen that

423
00:24:33.979 --> 00:24:35.619
are light at the top and dark at the

424
00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:39.219
bottom appear phenomenologically to stick out of the screen,

425
00:24:39.359 --> 00:24:44.260
right? Uh, THEY'RE convex, and the circles with, uh,

426
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.800
Dark at the top and light at the bottom

427
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.939
appear to kind of stick into the screen. And

428
00:24:48.939 --> 00:24:50.939
this is kind of puzzling. It's like, you know,

429
00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.880
why don't we just see circles on the screen

430
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.979
with dots and lights? Why do we see this

431
00:24:55.979 --> 00:24:59.979
kind of convexity and concavity when it's not there

432
00:24:59.979 --> 00:25:03.030
on the screen and. And one explanation is that,

433
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:07.069
uh, human beings have lived in an environment for

434
00:25:07.069 --> 00:25:11.229
millennia where the source of light typically is from

435
00:25:11.229 --> 00:25:14.189
the sun from above. So our brains build this

436
00:25:14.189 --> 00:25:16.589
very strong assumption, maybe it's hardwired. I don't think

437
00:25:16.589 --> 00:25:18.949
it's hardwired. I think there are experiments with chicks

438
00:25:18.949 --> 00:25:22.229
that show it can be, uh, altered. But anyway,

439
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:27.290
but we learned very quickly. And, um, that, uh,

440
00:25:27.829 --> 00:25:30.969
you know, we, um, And that explains why we

441
00:25:30.969 --> 00:25:33.369
see some of the circles are sticking out and

442
00:25:33.369 --> 00:25:36.369
sticking in. We see the, the circles of light

443
00:25:36.369 --> 00:25:38.339
at the top and dark at the bottom is

444
00:25:38.339 --> 00:25:40.810
sticking out, because if there was light coming from

445
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.609
above, it would hit the top of a sticking

446
00:25:43.609 --> 00:25:47.250
out circle just like that. And, uh, and, and

447
00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.890
that's how our brain interprets it, um, as a,

448
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:54.329
as a convex, uh, dimple sticking out of the

449
00:25:54.329 --> 00:25:56.969
screen. That's just one example, but that's an assumption,

450
00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.569
again. We're talking about assumptions, top-down processes. The assumption

451
00:26:00.569 --> 00:26:03.630
then is light comes from above, and we kind

452
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.130
of interpret the world through that assumption. That's one

453
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.569
of them. There are many, many, many others. And

454
00:26:09.569 --> 00:26:13.599
so it, so coming back to kind of top-down

455
00:26:13.599 --> 00:26:19.739
and bottom-up processing, so. Current theories of perception show

456
00:26:19.739 --> 00:26:23.540
that perception is a, is an amalgamation of these

457
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.939
processes. um, AND I think that's where, what the

458
00:26:27.939 --> 00:26:32.420
predictive brain, predictive processing, predictive coding, uh, really kind

459
00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.660
of mathematicizes, uh, and turns into kind of computational

460
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.520
neuroscience.

461
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:41.170
Right. So let's get into attention then. First of

462
00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.890
all, what is attention?

463
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.750
So Um, attention has, study of attention has a

464
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.900
long history, uh, from at least, uh, William James,

465
00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:58.859
um, until, you know, now and onwards. Um, ATTENTION

466
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.439
has been conceived of as some kind of selection

467
00:27:03.439 --> 00:27:08.430
mechanism in the brain. So We are, you know,

468
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.250
walking around the world, we're constantly being bombarded by,

469
00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:18.300
you know, uh. Information impinging on our sensory epithelia,

470
00:27:18.579 --> 00:27:20.359
and there's far too much of it for our

471
00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:25.020
nervous system to handle. So, uh, uh, um, you

472
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.459
know, imagine if you were in, I don't know,

473
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.660
New York City walking through Times Square, all those

474
00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.780
lights, sounds, cars, all the, uh, if you had

475
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.500
to process all of that, you just wouldn't be

476
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:38.819
able to. So, in order to Um Kind of

477
00:27:38.819 --> 00:27:41.060
solve this problem, I suppose. The brain has developed

478
00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:45.979
this kind of selection strategy where it selects, so

479
00:27:45.979 --> 00:27:47.420
you can think of all that information from your

480
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.420
senses coming in via all these channels, uh, kind

481
00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.959
of competing, say, for limited cognitive and neural resources.

482
00:27:55.329 --> 00:27:58.449
And so the idea is attention serves to select

483
00:27:58.449 --> 00:28:01.569
some of these channels, um, give more weight to

484
00:28:01.569 --> 00:28:04.969
some of these channels, and by giving more weight

485
00:28:04.969 --> 00:28:07.770
to them and selecting them, it enables that information

486
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.619
contained in those channels to be processed more deeply,

487
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:13.770
so you can become conscious of it, you can

488
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.209
make decisions based on it, you can react to

489
00:28:16.209 --> 00:28:19.859
it, you can avoid it. Um. So that's a

490
00:28:19.859 --> 00:28:24.949
kind of um That's, uh, one very influential, I

491
00:28:24.949 --> 00:28:28.069
think, view of what attention is. Um, YOU can

492
00:28:28.069 --> 00:28:32.020
also think of attention, um, uh, metaphorically as a

493
00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.910
kind of spotlight, right? That you're kind of, the,

494
00:28:34.989 --> 00:28:36.630
the world is in front of you and you've

495
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.430
got all this information kind of rushing in. And

496
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.989
again, you've only got limited resources to process it.

497
00:28:42.109 --> 00:28:46.819
So, um, So, you know, much as a spotlight

498
00:28:46.819 --> 00:28:50.500
can illuminate a person in an audience, um, bringing

499
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.180
them into view, uh, attention can metaphorically operate like

500
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:59.420
a spotlight, which selects certain bits of information, um,

501
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.030
to, you know, to process more deeply, um, I

502
00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.310
think, um, where I am with attention, and I

503
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:12.520
think, um, Again, I think where, where the field

504
00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.800
is moving in terms of attention is talking about

505
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.239
attention in terms of precision. Um, IN the brain,

506
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.140
which I think would need a lot of unpacking.

507
00:29:21.479 --> 00:29:23.079
Um, SO I don't know if you want to

508
00:29:23.079 --> 00:29:26.430
wait to talk about that later, but, or now,

509
00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.130
I'm not sure.

510
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.270
Yeah, tell us about it now.

511
00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.880
Yes. Yeah, OK, OK. So again, we go back

512
00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.800
to the predictive brain, this, uh, predictive processing, uh,

513
00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:40.910
theory of what brains are doing. Um, And just

514
00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.469
to sort of repeat maybe a bit of what

515
00:29:43.469 --> 00:29:45.510
I said, you know, the idea is that there's

516
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:49.949
this hierarchy of predictions, cascading predictions from abstract predictions

517
00:29:49.949 --> 00:29:54.390
to object-level predictions to sensory-level predictions that are, um,

518
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.930
that's our world model that are being refined by

519
00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:04.020
sensory information that provides, uh, kind of, Learning material

520
00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.619
for the models if there's a mismatch between the

521
00:30:05.619 --> 00:30:07.660
sensory information, the model and the model, the model

522
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:14.020
can update. Now, this whole process, uh, of, uh,

523
00:30:14.959 --> 00:30:20.719
Hierarchical prediction error minimization is shaped also by what

524
00:30:20.719 --> 00:30:27.380
is called precision. Now precision, um, loosely speaking, is

525
00:30:27.719 --> 00:30:35.189
the. Is the confidence. That the system has in

526
00:30:35.489 --> 00:30:40.560
the Prediction error. Right? So, let me give you

527
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.569
an example. So let's say you're in a, a

528
00:30:44.569 --> 00:30:46.729
car and you're driving down the road and it's

529
00:30:46.729 --> 00:30:50.969
a foggy day, right? It's very, very foggy. You've

530
00:30:50.969 --> 00:30:52.890
driven down that road many, many times, but it's

531
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.010
so foggy that you can not really see anything

532
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.770
in front of you. So in that situation, let's

533
00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:58.930
think about what might be going on in the

534
00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:02.349
brain. Again, your brain is making all these predictions

535
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.290
about what's going on right now and what you're

536
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.640
gonna, what's gonna happen in the future. And, um,

537
00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:13.699
And In terms of driving the car, it's making

538
00:31:13.699 --> 00:31:16.140
predictions about the road, about the, you know, the

539
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.770
turns on the road, etc. ETC. But, and in,

540
00:31:19.859 --> 00:31:22.739
in a case of, uh, clear daylight, it would

541
00:31:22.739 --> 00:31:27.859
be able to. Uh Sort of, uh, tune those

542
00:31:27.859 --> 00:31:31.140
predictions by the sensory information that's coming in, uh.

543
00:31:32.109 --> 00:31:33.510
You know, through the car because it's a, it's

544
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.750
a clear, it's a clear day. Now, when it's

545
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:40.739
foggy, the brain can't rely on sensory information to

546
00:31:40.739 --> 00:31:43.189
guide it. It can, it has to rely on

547
00:31:43.189 --> 00:31:46.750
its, um, on its, uh, model of the world,

548
00:31:46.829 --> 00:31:49.630
right? Your understanding of how the road curves, so

549
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:52.810
you're using your model to drive your car, right?

550
00:31:53.099 --> 00:31:58.310
Um, SO in this case, you would have High

551
00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:03.859
precision on your prediction errors, sorry, on your predictions,

552
00:32:03.939 --> 00:32:08.739
on your model, and very low precision on the,

553
00:32:08.969 --> 00:32:13.469
uh, sensory information coming in. What that means is

554
00:32:13.469 --> 00:32:15.930
that you would give more confidence in that driving

555
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:20.479
the car situation to your brain's model of what's

556
00:32:20.479 --> 00:32:22.530
going on. Uh, IN other words, I know this

557
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.560
road, I know there's a curve here. You would

558
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.829
give more confidence to that, more precision to that

559
00:32:28.449 --> 00:32:31.000
than to the sensory information coming in, because the

560
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.369
sensory information is just fog. It's just kind of,

561
00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:39.439
you know, uh, so precision then is. How much

562
00:32:39.439 --> 00:32:46.189
confidence the brain gives to the prediction errors. Versus

563
00:32:46.189 --> 00:32:53.550
the prediction. And attention then under this framework is

564
00:32:53.550 --> 00:33:00.449
precision. It's the confidence the brain gives to either

565
00:33:00.449 --> 00:33:05.189
its predictions or to its prediction errors. So, um,

566
00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:11.310
And, and, and technically, the precision is the, uh,

567
00:33:11.349 --> 00:33:13.829
inverse of the variance, right? So if you think

568
00:33:13.829 --> 00:33:15.949
of, just getting a little bit more technical, so

569
00:33:15.949 --> 00:33:19.030
if you think about, uh, each prediction the brain

570
00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.500
is making as a Gaussian, as a normal distribution,

571
00:33:22.869 --> 00:33:24.939
and so there you can get a mean, you

572
00:33:24.939 --> 00:33:26.949
can get a, a, a variance, you can get

573
00:33:26.949 --> 00:33:30.030
a standard deviation, and the, the variance tells you

574
00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.569
how spread out that distribution is. And if it's,

575
00:33:32.869 --> 00:33:36.979
um, And then the precision is the inverse of

576
00:33:36.979 --> 00:33:40.900
that variance, which tells you how concentrated, uh, the

577
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.900
distribution is. So if you have a very concentrated

578
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.859
distribution, that is a prediction or a prediction error

579
00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:50.609
with very high precision, right? It's, it's saying to

580
00:33:50.609 --> 00:33:52.420
your brain, look, look, look, this is, this is

581
00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:56.430
worth taking note of. But if it's, um, Very

582
00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:01.949
low precision, uh, so, uh, then the brain might

583
00:34:01.949 --> 00:34:04.810
treat it as noise or something not to be

584
00:34:05.589 --> 00:34:08.330
taken seriously, and maybe it would take more seriously

585
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.870
the the the the world model as it currently

586
00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:15.409
stands. Um, SO precision and, and attention then. So,

587
00:34:15.958 --> 00:34:19.159
Uh, uh, so attention is, is, is precision. Attention

588
00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:23.909
is that the brain's ability to, uh, kind of,

589
00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:26.159
and this is metaphorically, right? So turn up the

590
00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:30.478
volume on certain, uh, sensory information coming in or

591
00:34:30.478 --> 00:34:33.458
turn up the volume on certain predictions you're making,

592
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.478
uh, to kind of control the game, uh, there,

593
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.840
yeah. Mhm.

594
00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:44.629
So you've already mentioned earlier inattentional blindness, but tell

595
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:49.570
us now more about phenomena like inattentional blindness, change

596
00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:55.310
blindness, and attentional blink, and what we have learned

597
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:59.290
from the studies on these phenomena you explore in

598
00:34:59.290 --> 00:34:59.909
your book.

599
00:35:00.489 --> 00:35:05.310
Yeah, um, so, um, so we have inattentional blindness,

600
00:35:05.689 --> 00:35:10.500
change blindness, and the attentional blink, uh. What I'll

601
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.659
talk about what they are in a second, but

602
00:35:11.659 --> 00:35:13.540
what they will show, what they all seem to

603
00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.739
show, uh, what they all seem to support is

604
00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:20.760
that without attention, Right, you can think of it

605
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.000
as a spotlight if you want to, or as

606
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.639
a selection mechanism or precision, but without attention, we

607
00:35:26.639 --> 00:35:32.360
are functionally blind to what is. Presented to us,

608
00:35:32.479 --> 00:35:36.409
right? Even though our eyes might be looking directly

609
00:35:36.409 --> 00:35:39.270
at an object or a stimulus on a screen,

610
00:35:39.689 --> 00:35:44.330
uh, these, uh, phenomena seem to show that that's

611
00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:45.899
not enough for us to be aware of it.

612
00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:47.570
In order for us to be aware of that

613
00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:51.149
stimulus, we have to be attending to it. So,

614
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:58.929
overall, they suggest theoretically that attention is necessary for

615
00:35:58.929 --> 00:36:02.909
conscious perception. Um, SO let's talk about each of

616
00:36:02.909 --> 00:36:05.899
those in turn. So inattentional blindness, uh, as I

617
00:36:05.899 --> 00:36:08.510
said before, is this phenomenon where if people are

618
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.219
not paying attention to a stimulus that's in front

619
00:36:11.219 --> 00:36:14.179
of them, uh, invariably, they will not be aware

620
00:36:14.179 --> 00:36:16.659
of it. Um, SO this is typically, so let

621
00:36:16.659 --> 00:36:19.510
me give you one example of an experiment on

622
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:24.780
inattentional blindness. So, uh, Arrian McAna in 2012 wrote

623
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:28.719
a paper called Gist Perception Requires Attention. Just perception

624
00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:30.739
is having a perception of just, you know, the

625
00:36:30.739 --> 00:36:32.459
general sense of what's going on. I'm in a

626
00:36:32.459 --> 00:36:36.100
room, uh, there are chairs there, uh, you know,

627
00:36:36.179 --> 00:36:38.979
it's, it's not a, uh, garden, it's a room.

628
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.219
I got the, I've got the gist, the overall

629
00:36:41.219 --> 00:36:44.300
kind of picture of what's going on. And so

630
00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:49.709
we did these experiments, uh, Actually, just backtrack a

631
00:36:49.709 --> 00:36:52.649
little, a little bit, uh, uh, others had found

632
00:36:53.149 --> 00:36:57.510
that, uh, participants could, uh, pick up the, the

633
00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:01.219
gist of a scene if, even if they weren't

634
00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:05.979
paying attention to it. Um, AND for various reasons,

635
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:09.270
we questioned that study and we did advised our

636
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:12.070
own study to kind of really test this hypothesis

637
00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:15.120
that they were able to perceive the scene even

638
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.149
without attention. And so what we did was we

639
00:37:18.149 --> 00:37:21.379
had an experiment, uh, just to simplify. There were

640
00:37:21.379 --> 00:37:25.429
3 conditions, uh, 3 levels of the attention, uh,

641
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:30.010
factor. So we had inattention, and in the inattention

642
00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:34.389
condition, participants were looking at a computer screen and

643
00:37:34.389 --> 00:37:38.469
they were told their task was to report whether

644
00:37:38.469 --> 00:37:41.969
a, a cross like that, a vertical horizontal cross

645
00:37:42.149 --> 00:37:45.189
that appeared very briefly, I think 200 milliseconds on

646
00:37:45.189 --> 00:37:48.389
the screen. Randomly in one of the four quadrants

647
00:37:48.389 --> 00:37:52.209
of the screen, uh, they, their task was to

648
00:37:52.209 --> 00:37:54.860
say which of those arms of the cross was

649
00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:59.290
longer. And the differences between the lengths of the

650
00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.100
arms was very small. We wanted to make it

651
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.879
quite difficult to make it attentionally demanding. And, um,

652
00:38:05.659 --> 00:38:07.919
so in the inattention condition, they just paid attention

653
00:38:07.919 --> 00:38:10.820
to the cross task, and I think maybe there

654
00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.419
were 10 trials. And then on what we call

655
00:38:13.419 --> 00:38:16.229
the critical trial, Uh, which was the last trial,

656
00:38:16.649 --> 00:38:20.370
uh, in our experiment, a scene appeared, uh, and

657
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.370
it could be a garden, it was a photograph

658
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.449
of a scene, and it could be a garden,

659
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:28.090
a mountain, a farm, uh, people on a racetrack,

660
00:38:28.209 --> 00:38:31.389
people in an audience, lots of different scenes. And

661
00:38:31.389 --> 00:38:33.750
the question we asked them after that final trial

662
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.840
was, OK, after, after they reported the longer arm

663
00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.189
of the cross, did you see anything on that

664
00:38:39.189 --> 00:38:44.350
final trial? And we found that, uh, many, many

665
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:49.229
people reported, didn't report seeing anything. In other words,

666
00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.510
they were. They were not paying attention and they

667
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:57.780
were blind to it, hence inattentional blindness. Now. You

668
00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.100
know, to make sure, so, you know, of course,

669
00:39:00.139 --> 00:39:03.139
we did control, um, experiments. So we also did

670
00:39:03.139 --> 00:39:05.540
this with a divider's attention. So they were asked

671
00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.899
to pay attention to the crosses and anything else

672
00:39:07.899 --> 00:39:10.780
they saw on the screen. And here they tended

673
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:14.790
to. Uh, SOMETIMES report seeing the scene, some of

674
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:16.870
them did not. And then with full attention where

675
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.709
they were told, forget about the, uh, the crosses,

676
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.590
the cross task, just pay attention to anything else

677
00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:24.629
that appears on the screen. And in this case,

678
00:39:24.669 --> 00:39:27.750
with full attention, they did notice the scene and

679
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:31.989
could describe accurately. So this, uh, shows us that

680
00:39:31.989 --> 00:39:36.629
without attention, Uh, they are not conscious of what

681
00:39:36.629 --> 00:39:39.500
is, uh, on the screen. Now, just to add

682
00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.020
something to that, because I think it's interesting, that

683
00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:45.389
doesn't mean that that information is not being somehow

684
00:39:45.389 --> 00:39:49.209
picked up unconsciously by the system and being processed.

685
00:39:50.649 --> 00:39:52.850
Some experiments have found that even though participants are

686
00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:55.250
not aware of the stimulus, in our case, the

687
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:58.530
seeing, there is priming. In other words, that they

688
00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:01.449
don't see it, but it facilitates certain kinds of

689
00:40:01.449 --> 00:40:04.629
processing in their brain despite not being registered consciously.

690
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:08.570
That's an attentional blindness. It's really rich literature on

691
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:12.290
that, um, and, um, and then we come to

692
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:15.229
change blindness. So change blindness is a similar phenomenon,

693
00:40:15.409 --> 00:40:19.840
but in change blindness, uh, Uh, a participant is,

694
00:40:19.949 --> 00:40:26.370
well, change blindness is where participants are, uh. Do

695
00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:29.520
not notice, are not consciously aware of big changes

696
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.489
that are happening in a display, in a scene

697
00:40:32.489 --> 00:40:36.409
right in front of their eyes. So, uh, work

698
00:40:36.409 --> 00:40:39.570
by Rensink and colleagues back in the 90s and

699
00:40:39.889 --> 00:40:45.239
much work since then using, um, the, uh, what's

700
00:40:45.239 --> 00:40:48.229
it called? The Flickr paradigm, right? So in this

701
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:52.169
experimental method, um, uh, the scene is shown on

702
00:40:52.169 --> 00:40:55.370
the screen. And there's a blank, maybe it's shown

703
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:57.280
for, I don't know, maybe 200 milliseconds, I think.

704
00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:00.310
And then there's a blank interval of like, uh,

705
00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:03.050
100 or so milliseconds. And then the scene appears

706
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:06.879
again. And then the gray interval appears again. And

707
00:41:06.879 --> 00:41:09.600
so what's happening is the, in the first scene,

708
00:41:09.909 --> 00:41:11.520
uh, we see the first scene, we see the

709
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.639
gray interval. In the second time we see it,

710
00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.189
something has been changed. So, uh, something has been

711
00:41:17.189 --> 00:41:20.100
added or removed or colors have been changed, or

712
00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:25.959
something's changed. And the participant, participant's task is to

713
00:41:25.959 --> 00:41:31.330
watch this until this kind of repeated, uh, Uh,

714
00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:36.570
you know, pre-change, interval, uh, post-change until they notice

715
00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:39.330
the change and then press a key. And typically

716
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:43.489
it takes people many, many, many seconds to notice

717
00:41:43.489 --> 00:41:46.489
this change, even though, you know, it's happening right

718
00:41:46.489 --> 00:41:49.290
in front of their eyes. Um, AND what seems

719
00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.449
to be key here, at least, uh, one of

720
00:41:51.449 --> 00:41:54.610
the keys is attention. When they're attending to the

721
00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:58.750
change, studies show. They will see the change. So

722
00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:01.510
if you're, if you're just lucky enough to attend

723
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:03.770
on, say, the object that's going to be changed,

724
00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:07.610
and And then the gray interval happens and then

725
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:10.129
the scene pops up, and yeah, hey, Presto, the

726
00:42:10.129 --> 00:42:13.169
object's changed, then you'll notice the change. But unless

727
00:42:13.169 --> 00:42:16.050
you're attending to it, the evidence suggests you will,

728
00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:19.600
will not notice a change. Um, AND then, uh,

729
00:42:19.649 --> 00:42:23.050
we have the attentional blink, which is another phenomenon

730
00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:27.290
that demonstrates, uh, the relationship between attention and conscious

731
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:34.889
perception. So, with the attentional blink, um, This is

732
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:39.300
where. This is a, this shows the kind of

733
00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:43.370
temporal effects of attention. So, if a stimulus, let,

734
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.179
let me give you the experiment first and I'll,

735
00:42:45.379 --> 00:42:46.909
I can explain what it means. So, in the,

736
00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.100
in the, in the experiment, in a typical experiment,

737
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:54.300
uh, we have what's called an RSVP paradigm. RSVP

738
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:59.620
means rapid serial visual presentation. And what the participant

739
00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:03.040
experiences a, is a rapid stream of, you know,

740
00:43:03.459 --> 00:43:05.939
letters or digits that say, appearing to them on

741
00:43:05.939 --> 00:43:09.280
the screen. So in this RSVP what's going on?

742
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:16.520
Is that, um, let's say, Uh OK, so the

743
00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:21.479
participants' task is to Look at the stream of

744
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:25.520
information and let's say the stream of information is,

745
00:43:25.639 --> 00:43:30.169
uh, let's say 10 digits. And embedded in the

746
00:43:30.169 --> 00:43:34.250
10 digits is, let's say, two letters, and let's

747
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.689
say each of the letters and digits is presented

748
00:43:36.689 --> 00:43:39.250
for 100 milliseconds. So what the participant will see

749
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.189
is this stream of digits and letters kind of

750
00:43:42.189 --> 00:43:46.000
being presented to them. And the participant's task is

751
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.169
to report the two letters, let's say, that are

752
00:43:50.169 --> 00:43:53.969
embedded in this stream of digits. Uh, NOW what's

753
00:43:53.969 --> 00:43:58.840
found is, um, participants are very good at reporting

754
00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.530
the first letter that appears in that stream of

755
00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:07.969
digits, right? And if the second letter comes after

756
00:44:07.969 --> 00:44:12.929
500 500 milliseconds or so after the presentation of

757
00:44:12.929 --> 00:44:16.489
the first digit, the first letter, then participants will

758
00:44:16.489 --> 00:44:19.409
also be aware of the second letter. But, and

759
00:44:19.409 --> 00:44:22.209
this is, this is the interesting point. If the

760
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:29.429
Um, second letter appears between 200 to 500 milliseconds

761
00:44:29.429 --> 00:44:32.969
after the first letter. Participants will not be aware

762
00:44:32.969 --> 00:44:36.810
of it, invariably. They will not consciously notice it.

763
00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:41.310
Um, AND this phenomenon is called the attentional blink.

764
00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:44.350
And kind of, just as our, when, when our

765
00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:48.510
eyes blink momentarily, we shut out visual information coming

766
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:53.449
in. Uh, THE idea is that when our attention.

767
00:44:54.179 --> 00:44:58.510
Is processing the first letter in the stream. Um,

768
00:44:59.169 --> 00:45:02.620
This takes up attentional resources to do that, and

769
00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:06.320
if the second letter appears. You know, between 200

770
00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:10.830
to 500 milliseconds after the first letter, then, um,

771
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.989
it will not be. Able to be processed by

772
00:45:13.989 --> 00:45:17.219
attention because attention is still working on processing that

773
00:45:17.219 --> 00:45:20.590
first letter. But if it comes 500 milliseconds after

774
00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:24.209
the first letter, now, uh, we're able to consciously,

775
00:45:24.469 --> 00:45:27.500
uh, perceive it because now attention, now the now

776
00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.429
you're not blinking anymore. Now your eyes are open

777
00:45:29.429 --> 00:45:35.659
again, right? Um. So, uh, so these phenomena, inattentional

778
00:45:35.659 --> 00:45:39.899
blindness, change blindness, and the attentional blink, all seem

779
00:45:39.899 --> 00:45:42.500
to point or, or, you know, provide lots of

780
00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:47.540
evidence for the theory that attention is, uh, is

781
00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.780
necessary for conscious perception to happen. Um, AND if

782
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:56.439
attention is not, uh, deployed, then you might think

783
00:45:56.659 --> 00:45:59.070
you are conscious of what you're looking at, but

784
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:01.500
we suggest that you're not. Um, YEAH.

785
00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.760
In what ways can expectation shape perception?

786
00:46:09.379 --> 00:46:13.120
Good, yeah. So, um, so we've spoken about attention.

787
00:46:13.419 --> 00:46:19.899
Uh, EXPECTATION has a very, uh, powerful, uh, impact

788
00:46:19.899 --> 00:46:25.020
on what we experience. Um, I'm a vision scientist,

789
00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:28.439
so I mostly speak about visual examples. Um, BUT.

790
00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:36.100
I mean, just thinking about um. Let's say visual

791
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:42.699
illusions and. There is, uh, for example, there's an

792
00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:46.020
illusion called the, um, the, um, what they're called

793
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:51.399
illusory contours, and There's a very famous one of

794
00:46:51.399 --> 00:46:55.500
these called the Konitza Triangle. And the Kunitza Triangle,

795
00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.800
to explain it without showing it, but anyway, so

796
00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.760
what you see on the screen, what's literally given

797
00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.929
to you on the screen. Is, uh, 3 little

798
00:47:04.929 --> 00:47:10.030
Pac-Men, black Pac-Man shapes that are kind of oriented

799
00:47:10.649 --> 00:47:18.290
such that. The brain perceives literally a triangle. Uh,

800
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.560
THE outlines of a triangle, the edges of the

801
00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.679
triangle, the triangle looks to be a kind of

802
00:47:24.679 --> 00:47:29.020
bright, brighter than. The background on which it sits,

803
00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.000
right? So we have this phenomenal experience of a

804
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.570
triangle there. And there's no triangle on the screen.

805
00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.080
It's just these three Pac-Man shapes. There's no triangle

806
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.590
there. There's no background that's brighter than an object.

807
00:47:41.159 --> 00:47:44.379
That triangle that we experience is, is, you know,

808
00:47:44.879 --> 00:47:47.669
created by our, our nervous system in response to

809
00:47:47.669 --> 00:47:52.370
that stimulus. Now, I think this shows one of

810
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:55.629
the, this, this kind of illustrates the effects of

811
00:47:56.090 --> 00:48:01.790
expectation on vision. Um, SO. If your brain is

812
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:06.830
faced with some stimulus like that, those three Pac-Men

813
00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:11.709
whose configuration kind of suggests a triangle there, then.

814
00:48:12.669 --> 00:48:17.570
Based on past experience and assumptions, the brain has

815
00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:19.189
picked up over, you know, the years we've been

816
00:48:19.189 --> 00:48:24.179
alive, um, it concludes, comes to the conclusion that,

817
00:48:24.389 --> 00:48:26.909
uh, there really is a triangle there, and that's

818
00:48:26.909 --> 00:48:29.830
what we, you know, actually perceive. It's not that

819
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:31.939
we kind of think, oh, it looks as if

820
00:48:31.939 --> 00:48:33.750
there's a triangle there, we actually perceive a kind

821
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:36.949
of ghostly triangle. So, this is, uh, one example,

822
00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:40.645
perhaps not the best. Example of where expectations our

823
00:48:40.645 --> 00:48:43.725
brain has about the world, predictions our brain has

824
00:48:43.725 --> 00:48:47.044
about the world kind of override in a way

825
00:48:47.044 --> 00:48:49.405
the evidence right in front of our eyes, which

826
00:48:49.405 --> 00:48:53.405
is there's these three black shapes on a white

827
00:48:53.405 --> 00:48:59.889
screen overrides that. That actuality and creates its own

828
00:48:59.889 --> 00:49:03.250
kind of, uh, kind of guess as to what's

829
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:08.639
out there in the world. Um, SO, um, expectations

830
00:49:08.639 --> 00:49:13.120
then are these predictions that our brain has based

831
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:16.770
on past experience of what, what the world is.

832
00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.080
So, we expect, uh, when we go into a

833
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:23.199
doctor's office for there to be certain things and

834
00:49:23.199 --> 00:49:26.600
certain kinds of behavior and, you know, in psychology,

835
00:49:26.639 --> 00:49:28.919
we call it these schemas. We have these kind

836
00:49:28.919 --> 00:49:31.320
of schemas for what to expect. We go to

837
00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:36.560
certain places, how to behave, etc. Um. And In

838
00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:40.239
terms of what's going on in in In the

839
00:49:40.239 --> 00:49:44.020
brain. Um, THERE'S a lot of really interesting research.

840
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:46.860
Um, I'm thinking particularly of the research that's done

841
00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:52.360
by, uh, Peter Kock at UCL. Um, WHERE he

842
00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:59.659
showed that, um. Areas I think in V1. Uh

843
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:05.149
Light up in anticipation of a stimulus that's about

844
00:50:05.149 --> 00:50:07.949
to be presented. In other words, the brain is

845
00:50:07.949 --> 00:50:11.389
kind of predicting the stimulus before it even appears.

846
00:50:11.449 --> 00:50:14.169
It's in other words, it's expecting the stimulus before

847
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:19.629
before it even appears. Um, SO, I mean, that's

848
00:50:19.629 --> 00:50:21.360
the way to think about it in kind of

849
00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.189
terms of the brain. Um, BUT I think, uh,

850
00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.500
sorry, um, yeah, expectations pervade everything. They literally shape

851
00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.840
our reality, what we see. We don't, I don't

852
00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.959
think, well, we don't. We don't see reality as

853
00:50:34.959 --> 00:50:40.360
it is because again, we are our brain's model

854
00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.719
of what it thinks is going on in the

855
00:50:41.719 --> 00:50:45.159
world, uh, and that model can be wrong, um,

856
00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:51.270
But, uh, and this model is. Uh, DEEPLY sculpted

857
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:53.350
and shaped by what we expect to be in

858
00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:56.659
the world. Um, AND I mean, again, you know,

859
00:50:57.149 --> 00:51:01.419
this, you know, you can apply this to. Um,

860
00:51:01.479 --> 00:51:05.510
YOU know, Many different things. For example, feelings of

861
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:08.000
depression or anxiety. I mean, if you have, if

862
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.040
your brain has the prediction that the world is,

863
00:51:11.439 --> 00:51:14.239
uh, gray and, and flat and boring and, you

864
00:51:14.239 --> 00:51:19.989
know, uncaring, then. Again, if you, if your brain

865
00:51:19.989 --> 00:51:23.709
kind of holds that belief deeply enough, you literally

866
00:51:23.709 --> 00:51:29.110
see the world through that. Belief, your world model

867
00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:31.409
is kind of shaped by that belief. So you

868
00:51:31.409 --> 00:51:34.189
probably will see things as being quite gray and,

869
00:51:34.669 --> 00:51:38.060
and, uh. You know, so, uh, anyway, so it

870
00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.419
can, it, it's the point of bringing that in

871
00:51:40.419 --> 00:51:41.699
is to show that it's not just some kind

872
00:51:41.699 --> 00:51:44.899
of theoretical thing. It really does apply to human

873
00:51:44.899 --> 00:51:46.810
experience and how we live. Um, SO it really

874
00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:49.179
does have lots of applications there. But yeah, so

875
00:51:49.179 --> 00:51:50.459
that's just a, I mean, there's lots you could

876
00:51:50.459 --> 00:51:53.870
say about expectations, but that's. A few, there are

877
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:55.000
a few things you could say, yeah.

878
00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:58.949
Uh, TELL us a little bit more about expectation

879
00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:02.090
can lead to illusory experiences.

880
00:52:03.699 --> 00:52:09.189
Yeah, so. So we did, we, so I say

881
00:52:09.189 --> 00:52:13.540
recently, this is back in 2018, but um. We,

882
00:52:13.899 --> 00:52:17.020
so I was talking about Arian Mack, myself, uh,

883
00:52:17.219 --> 00:52:19.100
Muge Errol, and a couple of other people who

884
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.850
were in our lab at the time, um. We're

885
00:52:23.979 --> 00:52:35.060
doing some research on. INATTENTIONAL blindness. And We, um,

886
00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:38.510
I, I'm wondering about how much detail to go

887
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:41.810
into here because it's, but anyway, um, we were,

888
00:52:41.989 --> 00:52:48.709
uh, Wondering whether iconic memory required attention. Now just

889
00:52:48.709 --> 00:52:53.709
very briefly, iconic memory is a very highly transient

890
00:52:53.709 --> 00:52:58.310
but high capacity sensory memory, uh, that the system

891
00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:00.229
has of what it's just looked at in the

892
00:53:00.229 --> 00:53:03.070
case of vision. So we open our eyes, uh,

893
00:53:03.139 --> 00:53:05.620
we look at the world, an iconic memory, roughly

894
00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:10.070
speaking, is a kind of fleeting, kind of high

895
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:13.610
capacity memory of what we just saw, right? Um,

896
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:17.100
AND people have stared. Lots of people, lots of

897
00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:21.020
researchers have said, uh, that, that attention is not

898
00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:24.610
necessary for this iconic memory. And this is particularly

899
00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:28.300
interesting because iconic memory has been equated with phenomenal

900
00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:32.739
consciousness by many people. And so the contents of

901
00:53:32.739 --> 00:53:36.139
iconic memory are equated with what we were conscious

902
00:53:36.139 --> 00:53:40.909
of at that moment by many people. And And

903
00:53:41.409 --> 00:53:43.669
so we wanted to know whether that required attention.

904
00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:46.169
So what we did was we did an inattentional

905
00:53:46.169 --> 00:53:50.409
blindness experiment where, uh, we had, let's say, the

906
00:53:50.409 --> 00:53:52.209
cross task, so which arm of the cross is

907
00:53:52.209 --> 00:53:56.750
longer. And this time on every trial, we had

908
00:53:57.129 --> 00:53:59.530
a matrix of letters at the center of the

909
00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:03.060
screen. Um, AND I think it was a 3

910
00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:06.340
by 3 grid of letters. And, uh, this was

911
00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:09.719
present on every trial. So the participants' task was

912
00:54:09.939 --> 00:54:12.800
to report the longer arm of the cross. And

913
00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:14.979
they did this over repeated trials. And on the

914
00:54:14.979 --> 00:54:19.060
final critical trial, The matrix of letters, the grid

915
00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.959
was absent. There was nothing on the screen apart

916
00:54:21.959 --> 00:54:26.239
from the crosses, and participants were asked, OK, what

917
00:54:26.239 --> 00:54:28.159
was the longer run of the cross? And then

918
00:54:28.159 --> 00:54:30.959
they were asked, uh, uh, what else did you

919
00:54:30.959 --> 00:54:34.879
see on the screen? And surprisingly to us, we

920
00:54:34.879 --> 00:54:38.820
were very surprised by this. I looked, some people

921
00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.790
reported seeing letters, even though there were no letters

922
00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:46.429
on the screen, right? And they even wrote down

923
00:54:46.429 --> 00:54:50.479
some of the letters that they saw. And, and

924
00:54:50.479 --> 00:54:52.129
then we had a control condition where there was

925
00:54:52.129 --> 00:54:54.169
full attention to the grid of letters and then

926
00:54:54.169 --> 00:54:58.370
on that critical trial, you know, nobody reported seeing

927
00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:03.810
letters. So without attention, they reported seeing the letters,

928
00:55:03.889 --> 00:55:07.000
but with attention, uh, they didn't report seeing the

929
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.530
letters. So this was surprising. So we thought, well,

930
00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:13.770
maybe what's going on is that, um, because the

931
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:17.439
matrix of letters appears on every trial except the

932
00:55:17.439 --> 00:55:21.649
critical one. Uh, THEIR brains are building up an

933
00:55:21.649 --> 00:55:24.649
expectation that the matrix of letters is going to

934
00:55:24.649 --> 00:55:28.679
appear. And therefore, when it doesn't appear, But when

935
00:55:28.679 --> 00:55:31.649
their attention is, and when their attention is elsewhere,

936
00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:36.409
their brain still has the experience that it's there,

937
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:41.919
right? Um, AND so this was, you know, really,

938
00:55:42.129 --> 00:55:44.719
uh, surprising and set us off on this, uh,

939
00:55:45.169 --> 00:55:47.409
chain of experiments to explore this. So we looked

940
00:55:47.409 --> 00:55:52.580
at this with color patches. Um, SO, again, using

941
00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:55.610
this inattentional blindness kind of procedure, there was a,

942
00:55:55.739 --> 00:55:58.300
you know, the cross task, and on every trial,

943
00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:00.179
there was a color patch. I, I can't remember

944
00:56:00.179 --> 00:56:03.129
the color, but let's say it was green. And,

945
00:56:03.139 --> 00:56:07.070
um, And then on the critical trial, there was

946
00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:09.909
no color patch. And again, we found that a

947
00:56:10.439 --> 00:56:14.100
significant number of participants reported seeing the color patch

948
00:56:14.439 --> 00:56:16.659
in its absence, it wasn't there. And again, the

949
00:56:16.659 --> 00:56:19.120
control condition, pay attention to the color patch when

950
00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.199
they get to the critical trial, it's not there

951
00:56:21.199 --> 00:56:25.139
and they correctly report it's not there. So this,

952
00:56:25.679 --> 00:56:29.090
uh, uh, seemed to suggest to us that expectation

953
00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:31.360
was playing a very powerful role in what people

954
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:35.350
were experiencing. Again, their brains had come to expect

955
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:39.629
the color patch, the grid of letters, and When

956
00:56:39.629 --> 00:56:41.469
they were not attending to it, so when there

957
00:56:41.469 --> 00:56:44.459
was not much precision given to that sensory information,

958
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:47.020
then there was more precision being given to the

959
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:51.389
prediction, and then that led to them. Maybe hallucinating

960
00:56:51.389 --> 00:56:53.370
a color patch or a grid of letters in

961
00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:58.270
its absence. And then one other, um, experiment we

962
00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:01.790
did following that was the same paradigm, the same

963
00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:04.770
procedure, but this time the stimulus was a face.

964
00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.540
And so at the center of the screen on

965
00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:12.520
every non-critical trial was effaced, participant had to report

966
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.600
the long gram of the cross. Actually, in this

967
00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:17.280
task, in, in this, uh, experiment was slightly different.

968
00:57:17.719 --> 00:57:22.510
Um, Rather than the cross task, there were, uh,

969
00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:27.290
on the screen, 4 color bisected circles. So each

970
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:30.770
circle was red, green, red, green, and they were

971
00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:34.429
either the same configuration or one of them was

972
00:57:34.969 --> 00:57:37.129
not the same configuration as the others. And the

973
00:57:37.129 --> 00:57:39.449
participants' task was to, and again, it was an

974
00:57:39.449 --> 00:57:42.050
intentionally demanding task, that's what we wanted, was to

975
00:57:42.050 --> 00:57:45.570
report whether they were the same or different. And

976
00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:48.250
again, on this, in this experiment, a face appeared

977
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:52.530
on every trial along with the circles. uh, THEY,

978
00:57:52.629 --> 00:57:54.969
you know, they were never asked about it until

979
00:57:54.969 --> 00:57:57.590
that last trial when the face was absent, it

980
00:57:57.590 --> 00:58:00.889
was not on the screen. And they're asked, did

981
00:58:00.889 --> 00:58:02.449
you see anything on the screen apart from the

982
00:58:02.449 --> 00:58:05.909
circles? And again, a significant number of people reported

983
00:58:06.209 --> 00:58:09.909
seeing a face in its absence. Uh, AGAIN, the

984
00:58:09.909 --> 00:58:12.290
control condition when they were attending to that location,

985
00:58:12.649 --> 00:58:15.290
they reported, you know, there was nothing there, which

986
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:24.070
was the radical. Um, SO, So, um, So following

987
00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:27.500
on from this then, um, Uh, and again, that's

988
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:29.750
just some research that I've done in, in my

989
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:31.830
lab. There are lots of other, there's lots of

990
00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:37.419
other evidence that shows that, um. Uh, AN expectation

991
00:58:37.419 --> 00:58:41.010
can lead to, uh, hall, let's say hall, uh,

992
00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:46.060
uh, uh, an illusory experience, uh, work by, uh,

993
00:58:46.379 --> 00:58:52.179
uh, Arun Bachmann, uh, and others. Um, BUT what

994
00:58:52.179 --> 00:58:56.280
we, but what I've done since then, so, so

995
00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:58.899
one question that we had based on these experiments

996
00:58:58.899 --> 00:59:03.270
was, OK. This is all interesting, but let's just

997
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:08.580
pause a minute because. On that last trial, where

998
00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.379
there is no stimulus, let's talk about the face

999
00:59:11.379 --> 00:59:13.810
experiment. There's no stim, there's no face, but the

1000
00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:17.020
participant reports seeing a face after having lots of

1001
00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:19.439
trials where there was a face. Now, it could

1002
00:59:19.439 --> 00:59:23.459
be that, yeah, maybe they're hallucinating a face, maybe

1003
00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:26.139
they are having an experience of the face in

1004
00:59:26.139 --> 00:59:31.000
its absence, um, or it could be that they're.

1005
00:59:31.969 --> 00:59:35.050
Thinking, well, there was a face on previous trials,

1006
00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:37.540
so, uh, maybe there was a face on this

1007
00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:39.500
trial. I'll just guess. Yeah, I saw a face,

1008
00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:41.860
right? So it could, you know, so it could

1009
00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:43.860
be that they're having an illusory experience or it

1010
00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:46.729
could be that they're just inferring it. So, currently,

1011
00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:48.899
uh, in my lab at the University of West

1012
00:59:48.899 --> 00:59:51.620
London, I'm working with my post, uh, so my

1013
00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:54.739
PhD student, Becky Tyler, who's doing some really good

1014
00:59:54.739 --> 00:59:58.439
work on looking at what's happening in the brain

1015
00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:04.570
in terms of, uh, Neural activity, uh, when participants

1016
01:00:04.570 --> 01:00:07.709
are reporting seeing the face that's not there on

1017
01:00:07.709 --> 01:00:12.620
the screen. And again, just very briefly speaking, um,

1018
01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:18.689
there is, uh, There is a I don't want

1019
01:00:18.689 --> 01:00:22.669
to get too technical, so, um. So what she's

1020
01:00:22.669 --> 01:00:25.989
doing is an ERP study, and an ERP study

1021
01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:32.020
is measuring event related potentials, and these are Uh,

1022
01:00:32.139 --> 01:00:34.500
this activity in the brain that can be measured

1023
01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:39.020
on a millisecond scale that relates to, say, the

1024
01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.860
onset of a stimulus on the screen or something

1025
01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:45.649
else, attention or memory or, uh, a mismatch between

1026
01:00:45.649 --> 01:00:47.350
what you see and what you expect to see.

1027
01:00:47.699 --> 01:00:53.100
And, One of these, uh, ERPs is called the

1028
01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:59.050
N170. And the N170, again, briefly speaking, is, uh,

1029
01:00:59.219 --> 01:01:03.979
a, a neural event that occurs 170 milliseconds after

1030
01:01:03.979 --> 01:01:07.979
the presentation of the stimulus. Let's say it's a

1031
01:01:07.979 --> 01:01:11.379
face, and the end just refers to the kind

1032
01:01:11.379 --> 01:01:13.139
of, you know, whether it's a negative wave or

1033
01:01:13.139 --> 01:01:17.070
a positive wave. So the N170 is a signature

1034
01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:20.750
of, uh, face perception. So when people are perceiving

1035
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:24.810
a face, we get this N170 in the EEG.

1036
01:01:25.389 --> 01:01:30.280
And, um, so Becky is currently Doing an experiment

1037
01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.780
where she's, uh, kind of adapted slightly the paradigm

1038
01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:36.459
we use, but she's still asking the question, uh,

1039
01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:40.159
you know, does an expectation lead to an illusory

1040
01:01:40.159 --> 01:01:42.530
experience of a face in its absence? And we're

1041
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:45.239
predicting that if they really are experiencing the face,

1042
01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.459
they're not just inferring it, then we should see

1043
01:01:48.459 --> 01:01:53.250
this evidence for this 1 N170. Um, SO that's

1044
01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:54.800
what we're currently doing. And this allows us to

1045
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.070
kind of tease that question apart, right? Are they

1046
01:01:57.449 --> 01:02:01.320
really experiencing it or are they just inferring that,

1047
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:04.689
uh, inferring it was there just based on prior

1048
01:02:04.689 --> 01:02:12.270
experience, just making a guess. Um, SO. Um If

1049
01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:15.580
they really are seeing this face in its absence,

1050
01:02:15.669 --> 01:02:19.030
if, if an, this expectation really is leading them

1051
01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:23.469
to have, uh, non-veridical conscious experience, in other words,

1052
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:29.030
it's not tethered to the senses, then, um, this

1053
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:33.590
suggests that the, uh, you know, the again, the

1054
01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:36.830
power of expectation in creating what we consciously experience,

1055
01:02:37.149 --> 01:02:43.770
um, And I've called this phenomenon, uh, expectation awareness,

1056
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:50.429
uh, which is, uh, being aware, having an experience

1057
01:02:50.429 --> 01:02:56.030
of something based on your expectations, uh, rather than

1058
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:59.790
what you're attending to. So we, we find evidence

1059
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:02.909
for this expectation awareness under conditions of inattention. So

1060
01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:05.389
if somebody is not paying attention to something, but

1061
01:03:05.389 --> 01:03:07.340
they have a very strong expectation that something is

1062
01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:10.719
going to happen, then this seems to suggest that

1063
01:03:10.719 --> 01:03:14.530
they, they experience it. They, their brain kind of

1064
01:03:14.629 --> 01:03:17.909
stimulates or, or creates that experience in the absence

1065
01:03:17.909 --> 01:03:23.030
of attention based on very strong expectations. Um, So,

1066
01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:25.250
uh, yeah. And I've kind of noticed that in

1067
01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:27.290
my own life, right? Working on this, just like,

1068
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.149
uh, you know, I've got a window here, I've

1069
01:03:29.149 --> 01:03:32.050
got a big communal garden out here. And so,

1070
01:03:32.199 --> 01:03:33.610
you know, I, I sit at my desk quite

1071
01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:35.050
a lot of the time working. And so I

1072
01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:36.689
come to predict, you know, there are going to

1073
01:03:36.689 --> 01:03:39.239
be dogs, there are going to be people, um,

1074
01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:42.729
all kinds of activity. And I noticed sometimes when

1075
01:03:42.729 --> 01:03:44.649
I'm kind of working and maybe there's some kind

1076
01:03:44.649 --> 01:03:47.010
of a flash of light, some movement in my

1077
01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:51.879
peripheral vision, I do kind of very quickly. Kind

1078
01:03:51.879 --> 01:03:54.239
of experience it as a dog, right? You know,

1079
01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.080
I kind of, and then when I shift my

1080
01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.919
attention quickly, it resolve, you know, that prediction is

1081
01:03:58.919 --> 01:04:00.239
shown to be wrong and I see it for

1082
01:04:00.239 --> 01:04:01.989
what it is, just the kind of movement of

1083
01:04:01.989 --> 01:04:06.760
leaves across the, um, across the, the garden outside.

1084
01:04:06.919 --> 01:04:14.010
So, um, yeah, uh, expectations, uh, I mean, we've

1085
01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:15.649
known for a long time that expectations play a

1086
01:04:15.649 --> 01:04:19.050
strong, um, role in what we perceive, um, going

1087
01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:21.810
back to, you know, people like Helmholtz, uh, back

1088
01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:24.489
in the 19th century, but I think, um, today

1089
01:04:24.489 --> 01:04:29.919
we're really getting a kind of Computational neuroscientific, uh,

1090
01:04:29.929 --> 01:04:35.389
account of how these expectations can, um, Influence, yeah,

1091
01:04:35.469 --> 01:04:36.409
what we perceive.

1092
01:04:38.189 --> 01:04:43.500
Is attention necessary for all kinds of conscious experiences?

1093
01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:50.040
Um, SO I would say based on my research,

1094
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:58.810
writing this book and my understanding. That attention is

1095
01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:04.489
necessary for conscious perception. Mm. Um, IF we are

1096
01:05:04.489 --> 01:05:08.790
not paying attention. We will not be aware of

1097
01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:15.649
certain things that are happening around us. Um, And

1098
01:05:15.649 --> 01:05:17.189
our brain, you know, we will not be conscious

1099
01:05:17.189 --> 01:05:19.050
of them. They will not fit into our world

1100
01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:20.570
model at that time. They will not be part

1101
01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:26.530
of that world model. Um, And I don't see

1102
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:29.780
any evidence. And I could be wrong because I

1103
01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:32.020
might not have looked deeply enough, but I don't

1104
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:36.080
see any evidence in the literature that that shows

1105
01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:40.810
that there can be conscious perception without attention. I

1106
01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:44.800
think, and I would argue that And I, I

1107
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.959
do argue this in the book that in all

1108
01:05:46.959 --> 01:05:50.719
cases where it seems that, uh, there's conscious perception

1109
01:05:50.719 --> 01:05:54.330
without attention, actually there's some kind of minimal attention

1110
01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.679
being deployed there. And I think one of the

1111
01:05:57.679 --> 01:06:01.709
best Procedures or methods we have to really explore

1112
01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:04.590
what we see, what we're conscious of, what we

1113
01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:09.459
hear without attention is the inattentional blindness paradigm, because

1114
01:06:09.469 --> 01:06:15.689
it allows us to measure. What people perceive when

1115
01:06:15.689 --> 01:06:19.610
they're Attending to another stimulus and they're not, they're

1116
01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:23.649
not expecting a new stimulus to appear. And, um,

1117
01:06:26.479 --> 01:06:28.479
And yeah, I think the weight of evidence really

1118
01:06:28.479 --> 01:06:31.949
strongly suggests that conscious perception requires attention. Now, having

1119
01:06:31.949 --> 01:06:36.800
said that, I do think that this new evidence

1120
01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:40.750
from our own lab and from others' labs. Points

1121
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:43.790
towards, suggests, and then again then there'll needs to

1122
01:06:43.790 --> 01:06:45.689
be a lot more work here, but suggests that

1123
01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:51.699
under certain conditions, uh, we can have experiences that

1124
01:06:51.699 --> 01:06:55.899
are. Um, ILLUSORY, I prefer to use the term

1125
01:06:55.899 --> 01:06:58.419
illusory, but we can have experiences that are not

1126
01:06:58.419 --> 01:07:02.209
perceptions, so we can hallucinate, we can dream, we

1127
01:07:02.209 --> 01:07:09.139
can mine, you know, uh, daydream, etc. AND The

1128
01:07:09.139 --> 01:07:14.020
evidence that I've, you know, sort of outlined. Suggests

1129
01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:20.419
that not all conscious experiences require attention, right? Expectation,

1130
01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:23.340
awareness. If it's true, if it is the case

1131
01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:27.929
that these participants really are hallucinating a face in

1132
01:07:27.929 --> 01:07:31.030
its absence, and they're not attending to that face,

1133
01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:36.600
right? That's really suggestive that, uh, under those conditions,

1134
01:07:37.179 --> 01:07:39.620
the participant is having an experience in the absence

1135
01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:45.459
of attention. So I think while conscious perception. Does

1136
01:07:46.169 --> 01:07:49.330
require attention. I think there's, again, the weight of

1137
01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:52.889
evidence strongly suggests that. I think that these new

1138
01:07:52.889 --> 01:07:59.010
findings point towards experiences that do not, uh, require

1139
01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:01.739
attention. Um. Yeah

1140
01:08:03.629 --> 01:08:10.590
So then how do attention and expectation construct perceptual

1141
01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:11.350
reality?

1142
01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.969
Yeah, good. I mean, so if we go back

1143
01:08:14.969 --> 01:08:22.469
to this, um, Predictive processing, predictive coding. A way

1144
01:08:22.469 --> 01:08:28.839
of looking at things. Uh, It's all precision, right?

1145
01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:33.540
Um, SO the idea is that we have this

1146
01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:40.740
again, cascading hierarchy of predictions. And The, this cascading

1147
01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:44.799
hierarchy of predictions really kind of, uh, encode our

1148
01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:47.729
our expectations about the world. That's what the expectation,

1149
01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:51.589
that's what expectations are really, these priors, these predictions

1150
01:08:51.589 --> 01:08:59.040
that are, uh. That our brain encodes and Again,

1151
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.560
we have this feed forward sweep of sensory information

1152
01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.879
in terms of prediction errors and attention then is

1153
01:09:06.879 --> 01:09:11.759
the, the kind of deploying of precision, uh, to

1154
01:09:11.759 --> 01:09:16.000
the prediction errors, to the, uh, the predictions. So

1155
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.490
we have this, uh, precision weighted prediction error minimization,

1156
01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:27.078
right, which basically means that the brain is. Using

1157
01:09:27.078 --> 01:09:31.188
expectations and the sensory information and allocating confidence to

1158
01:09:31.188 --> 01:09:34.278
some information as opposed to other bits of information,

1159
01:09:34.519 --> 01:09:37.179
kind of tuning this, tuning that, and that whole

1160
01:09:37.758 --> 01:09:43.970
precision weighted prediction error minimization, uh, is what. Uh,

1161
01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:47.779
ATTENTION and expectation are in terms of, uh, and

1162
01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:52.349
what conscious what perception is. Uh, YEAH. Yeah.

1163
01:09:52.898 --> 01:09:55.579
OK, so I have 2 more questions that have

1164
01:09:55.579 --> 01:09:59.258
to do with the implications of how we've been

1165
01:09:59.258 --> 01:10:02.699
talking about here today. What are the implications of

1166
01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:06.858
this research for scientific theories of consciousness?

1167
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:13.790
Yeah, good question. Um, I think that this, these

1168
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:19.799
findings, what I've called expectation awareness. Present a challenge

1169
01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:25.479
to some scientific theories of consciousness. Particularly to those

1170
01:10:25.479 --> 01:10:29.439
theories which, uh, again, based on the evidence from

1171
01:10:29.439 --> 01:10:32.200
an attentional blindness change, blindness, attentional blink, and other

1172
01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:36.160
bits of evidence, uh, show that attention is a

1173
01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.629
kind of gateway to conscious perception, right? Uh, WE

1174
01:10:39.629 --> 01:10:42.109
can have all these incoming signals coming in, uh,

1175
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:44.100
but if they're not attended to, then they don't

1176
01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.890
get broadcast to the rest of the system. And

1177
01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:49.790
I'm thinking here of the global neuronal workspace theory

1178
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:52.609
by, uh, Bars and, uh, and then later De

1179
01:10:52.609 --> 01:11:00.970
Hane. Um. And, uh, so, These theories, uh, you

1180
01:11:00.970 --> 01:11:04.839
know, Sort of say that attention is necessary for

1181
01:11:04.839 --> 01:11:10.020
conscious broadcast, conscious information processing. But if expectation awareness

1182
01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:13.779
is true, if, if we can have experiences that

1183
01:11:13.779 --> 01:11:19.020
are not, that we're not attending to, um, that,

1184
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.939
that shows that this, these theories can't be quite

1185
01:11:21.939 --> 01:11:26.669
right because if we, because, you know, um, they,

1186
01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:31.490
they kind of challenge those theories, uh, assumptions and,

1187
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:34.560
um, So yeah, so I see this as a

1188
01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.839
challenge to theories like the global neuron and workspace

1189
01:11:36.839 --> 01:11:45.609
theory, the attention schema theory, um. And um You

1190
01:11:45.609 --> 01:11:47.770
know, the evidence seems to require us to kind

1191
01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:51.850
of at least modify these theories slightly to account

1192
01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:56.029
for this, um, this empirical evidence. Yeah.

1193
01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:03.000
And finally, what kinds of clinical implications does this

1194
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.879
research have, particularly for how we understand hallucinations and

1195
01:12:08.879 --> 01:12:10.410
conditions like schizophrenia?

1196
01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:13.609
Yeah, it has a lot of implications. And I

1197
01:12:13.609 --> 01:12:16.729
think that's one of the most exciting, uh, parts

1198
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:21.339
of this, uh, is that, um, What this seems

1199
01:12:21.339 --> 01:12:25.439
to show is that Kind of we hallucinate all

1200
01:12:25.439 --> 01:12:29.640
the time, right? So, when, uh, so one kind

1201
01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:32.799
of way of thinking about this predictive processing, predictive

1202
01:12:32.799 --> 01:12:36.799
coding, Bayesian brain theory is that, uh, perception is

1203
01:12:36.799 --> 01:12:40.720
a controlled hallucination. And I can't remember who was

1204
01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:43.479
the first person to say this, but, uh, Anil

1205
01:12:43.479 --> 01:12:45.830
Seth has mentioned it a lot in, in talks,

1206
01:12:45.879 --> 01:12:49.459
etc. Uh, BUT the idea is this, that, uh,

1207
01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.720
our brains are hallucinating all the time based on

1208
01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:58.240
Uh, you know, our expectations, uh, uh, of what's

1209
01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.319
going to be in the world. It's the kind

1210
01:13:00.319 --> 01:13:02.560
of simulation that our brain makes of what it

1211
01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.799
thinks the world is. It's a, it's a controlled,

1212
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.200
it's a hallucination. But it's, it's not just a

1213
01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:12.029
hall it's not, uh, so hallucinations can, you know,

1214
01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.200
take you far away from reality and make you

1215
01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.359
think things that don't exist and see things that

1216
01:13:16.359 --> 01:13:19.879
don't exist, etc. But this is a controlled hallucination,

1217
01:13:19.959 --> 01:13:24.500
meaning it's tethered to the world via the sensory

1218
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.040
epithelia, right? So we're, we're tethered to the world

1219
01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.549
like a kind of needle on a record, right?

1220
01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:36.270
There's a connection between us. Um, BUT, uh, So

1221
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:38.509
that's our reality and, and, and, you know, and

1222
01:13:38.509 --> 01:13:42.189
it's, and we share this hallucination, we call it

1223
01:13:42.189 --> 01:13:45.810
objectivity, we call it the world, right? There's intersubjectivity.

1224
01:13:46.109 --> 01:13:49.709
Um, BUT this process can, you know, go wrong.

1225
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:55.950
So the, uh, the, the brain can kind of

1226
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:58.979
lose, uh, touch with the sensory information coming in,

1227
01:13:59.049 --> 01:14:02.200
can become untethered from the world. In which case,

1228
01:14:02.259 --> 01:14:05.089
the hallucinate, you know, the system that creates this

1229
01:14:05.089 --> 01:14:06.689
world model is free to kind of do what

1230
01:14:06.689 --> 01:14:11.169
it likes, you know, certain constraints, uh, but it's

1231
01:14:11.169 --> 01:14:15.060
not tethered to reality and therefore, you can see

1232
01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.609
things that aren't there. If you've got a very

1233
01:14:16.609 --> 01:14:22.129
strong expectation that you're gonna say, see a face

1234
01:14:22.129 --> 01:14:28.370
in a crowd, uh, Uh, and if that hallucination

1235
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:30.629
is strong enough, then you will probably see that

1236
01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:32.490
face in the crowd even though it's not there.

1237
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:39.720
Um, SO. So yeah, so this applies to. Um,

1238
01:14:40.089 --> 01:14:42.509
ALL kinds of hallucinations. So in the case of,

1239
01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:48.100
uh, for example, Charles Bonnet syndrome or schizophrenia, um.

1240
01:14:49.779 --> 01:14:54.859
This, uh, uh, controlled hallucination has been, has become

1241
01:14:54.859 --> 01:14:59.819
uncontrolled, and therefore, you perceive what the brain is

1242
01:14:59.819 --> 01:15:04.020
making up. And while that might happen to all

1243
01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:06.069
of us on a certain level all the time,

1244
01:15:06.459 --> 01:15:09.439
uh, many of us who don't suffer from pathologies

1245
01:15:09.439 --> 01:15:11.859
are still tethered to the world. So even though

1246
01:15:11.859 --> 01:15:14.620
we might have an entertain a thought of X

1247
01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.060
or Y, that's a bit strange, uh, you know,

1248
01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:20.870
you quickly resolve that by Uh, testing it against

1249
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:24.029
the world, what's coming in through the senses. Um,

1250
01:15:24.370 --> 01:15:27.509
SO, yeah, I think what this shows is that,

1251
01:15:27.569 --> 01:15:31.750
um, Hallucinations can occur on a kind of range.

1252
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:36.319
Some hallucinations are necessary, you know, this controlled hallucination

1253
01:15:36.319 --> 01:15:38.950
that, that is what we are at the moment,

1254
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:41.229
if that's true. It's necessary for us to survive

1255
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:43.580
in this world to kind of, you know, persist,

1256
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:48.509
but some uncontrolled hallucinations can lead us to, uh,

1257
01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:53.649
places like schizophrenia or, um, delusions, um, or other

1258
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:58.470
kind of, uh, distortions of perception and reality. Yeah.

1259
01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.060
Great, so the book is again constructing experience, expectation,

1260
01:16:05.109 --> 01:16:08.439
and attention in perception. I'm leaving a link to

1261
01:16:08.439 --> 01:16:11.759
it in the description of the interview. And Doctor

1262
01:16:11.759 --> 01:16:14.640
Clark, apart from the book, would you like to

1263
01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.359
tell people where they can find your work on

1264
01:16:17.359 --> 01:16:18.060
the internet?

1265
01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.839
Yeah. So they can find my work on ResearchNet

1266
01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:27.990
and academia.edu. And I don't currently have a personal

1267
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:30.470
website. You can find information about me on the

1268
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:33.229
University of West London website. Uh, THERE'S a list

1269
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:37.069
of all my publications there. Um, YEAH, I, I,

1270
01:16:37.149 --> 01:16:39.109
I really should get a website set up, but

1271
01:16:39.109 --> 01:16:41.680
that's, that's something I need to do next. Yeah.

1272
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:43.259
OK,

1273
01:16:43.419 --> 01:16:46.299
