00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:03.089
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.059
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobs, and

3
00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:08.989
today I'm joined by Doctor Colleen Murphy. She is

4
00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:12.829
James A. Elkins Junior Professor in the Life Sciences

5
00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.949
and professor of molecular biology and director of the

6
00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.000
Louis Siegler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University.

7
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.690
And today we're going to talk about her book,

8
00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:28.149
How We Age The Science of Longevity. So, Doctor

9
00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.389
Murphy, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

10
00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:32.409
everyone. Thanks for having me, Ricardo.

11
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.750
So, uh, first of all, what is the science

12
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.549
of aging and longevity? What kinds of questions do

13
00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:40.549
you ask there?

14
00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:44.279
Yeah, so I think that um it's helpful to

15
00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:50.240
kind of distinguish two areas. There's, um, There's basically

16
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.040
the science, which is all the stuff that we

17
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.319
do in labs to try to understand sort of

18
00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.560
the regulation of longevity and aging. And for that

19
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.200
work, we do a lot of molecular biology, we

20
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.790
do genetics, we use a lot of model systems.

21
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.959
And then, there's the other part, which I think

22
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.800
most people are very familiar with is more of

23
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.309
this like, um, Like people taking some of that

24
00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:14.150
information and trying to extract and use it for

25
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.309
themselves and so, um, you know, people who change

26
00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:20.550
their diet according to things that they've read and

27
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.739
stuff like so I just wanna make sure that

28
00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:24.269
we understand that I'm not like a self-help guru.

29
00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:27.440
I'm not, um. I'm not gonna like, sell you

30
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.069
some supplements. I'm just, uh, my interest is in

31
00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:33.190
trying to understand what do we really know about

32
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.410
how aging is regulated and how can we, you

33
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.930
know, later on, think about like, how can we

34
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.889
apply that? But my expertise is more in the,

35
00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:41.569
the science end of things.

36
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.430
Uh, YEAH, so you mentioned there, and that is

37
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.540
a very important point that you're, of course not

38
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.900
a self-help guru and you're not trying to sell

39
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.059
supplements or anything like that. So what is your

40
00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:58.019
view about those kind of pop science or self-help

41
00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:02.330
books on aging that focus on things like eating,

42
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.879
weight, exercise, and

43
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.540
things

44
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.739
like

45
00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:07.839
that? I mean, look, some of that is deeply

46
00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:12.020
rooted in. Uh, SCIENCE that we is very well

47
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.919
accepted and very well tested, so I don't wanna

48
00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:18.000
pooh pooh all of that. Um, I do think

49
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.919
there's kind of a range of informed thought to

50
00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:26.119
just like people just, uh, you know, biohacking themselves

51
00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:27.679
and stuff like that. So I think, you know,

52
00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.320
I don't wanna be dismissive of there's actually, you

53
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.804
know, good science. It has to do with diet

54
00:02:32.804 --> 00:02:35.645
and and exercise and things, and I do think

55
00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:37.964
there's things that we can do to help make

56
00:02:37.964 --> 00:02:41.074
our lives longer and healthier. Um, THERE'S stuff that

57
00:02:41.074 --> 00:02:43.565
we can do for ourselves, and that's, you know,

58
00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:46.244
kind of healthy. And then, um, but there's lots

59
00:02:46.244 --> 00:02:49.044
of things that really haven't really even come online

60
00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:51.544
yet, these, you know, scientific discoveries that we're making

61
00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:56.880
that still haven't. Yet been developed into, um, into

62
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.880
drugs. And so, I think that we need to

63
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.479
make sure that we remember that the science of

64
00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.479
aging, we're not done with it. We're not finished,

65
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.440
and we don't know all the answers yet. And

66
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.039
so, anyone who tells you that they do know

67
00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:11.279
all the answers, they're not being honest with you.

68
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.800
So, um, yeah, there's a lot of great science

69
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.309
and there's still things that are, are, we're, we're

70
00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.600
discovering that can really help people eventually become very

71
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.000
healthy.

72
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.509
Uh, YEAH, tell us more about that. In what

73
00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:25.089
ways can the study of aging help our society?

74
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.190
OK. So I think one of the biggest uh

75
00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:34.699
Ideas that was helpful is how can we improve

76
00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.059
the quality of our life, right? So there's kind

77
00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:39.460
of, and there's always been, you know, I think

78
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.039
for the past like 3 decades, there's been this

79
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.789
discussion and almost like a fake argument discussing like,

80
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.460
should we make people live longer or live healthier,

81
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.250
as if there's a trade-off between the two. In

82
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.009
fact, In most cases, you know, we know that

83
00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:59.059
centenarians are more likely to have suffered from fewer,

84
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.770
um, age-related diseases, despite even sometimes having the genes

85
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.649
for those. So that's really fascinating. That was work

86
00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:08.130
done by Niram Bartelli's lab a while ago. And

87
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.690
so, um, I think there's this like mistaken or

88
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.479
maybe just for the sake of having a debate,

89
00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:15.949
this mistaken thought that we have to either pick

90
00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.809
lifespan extension or health span. I'm personally interested in

91
00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:23.980
very specific aspects of aging. I'm very interested in

92
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.299
cognitive decline and reproductive decline. And so, um, we

93
00:04:28.299 --> 00:04:31.989
can talk about those as aspects of aging, um,

94
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.529
But, you know, I think, you know, I, I

95
00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.769
saw this debate renewed just like I think in

96
00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:40.010
the past week about health span versus lifespan. I

97
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.640
don't know. It's just kind of uninteresting at some

98
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.970
point because we help people live healthier, better lives.

99
00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:48.130
In most cases, that's gonna stretch out the healthy

100
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.200
part of their lifespan, and it's gonna end up

101
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.410
extending lifespan as well. So I, I think that's

102
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.970
just something that people like to argue about. I

103
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.369
don't think it's really very productive.

104
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.079
Yeah, I mean, I guess that's one of the

105
00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:03.040
reasons why many people think that perhaps there's a

106
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.200
trade-off between living longer and having more healthy years

107
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.399
in their lives is that we just, I mean,

108
00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:14.480
in our own lives get across many people, family,

109
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.279
friends, and others that, uh, I mean, there are

110
00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:21.480
still many people out there that their last few

111
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.735
decades are very. Complicated with lots of disease, lots

112
00:05:25.735 --> 00:05:28.536
of comorbidities, and all of that, and they, it's

113
00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:32.536
not very pleasant, uh, last decades of life, I

114
00:05:32.536 --> 00:05:32.835
guess.

115
00:05:33.055 --> 00:05:35.776
Yeah, so, um, I think maybe the better way

116
00:05:35.776 --> 00:05:37.376
to think of that is that we used to

117
00:05:37.376 --> 00:05:40.175
have really, really high rates of cardiovascular disease and

118
00:05:40.175 --> 00:05:41.996
so people would drop dead of a heart attack

119
00:05:42.256 --> 00:05:44.235
much earlier than they would. So now we have

120
00:05:44.415 --> 00:05:46.855
statins and other things that try to treat some

121
00:05:46.855 --> 00:05:49.552
of those. So people are outliving that phase. And

122
00:05:49.552 --> 00:05:52.332
so, yeah, they're gonna necessarily, if we don't um

123
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:55.351
do other things to help people live healthier, they're

124
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:57.971
gonna eventually get some of those age-related diseases. But

125
00:05:58.231 --> 00:06:00.272
again, I'm not sure that it's better that if

126
00:06:00.272 --> 00:06:02.361
somebody drops dead of 53 of a heart attack,

127
00:06:02.671 --> 00:06:04.992
instead, now in their 70s, they have some of

128
00:06:04.992 --> 00:06:07.592
their comorbidities. So I, I think people have kind

129
00:06:07.592 --> 00:06:10.191
of forgotten that and I think forgotten about things

130
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:12.782
like public health where people just live longer because

131
00:06:12.782 --> 00:06:16.260
they survived through childhood now, right? So. I mean,

132
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.470
that's a good thing. So I, I understand that

133
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.149
people don't want to have a poor, uh, end

134
00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:23.309
of life, and I think that we can, that's

135
00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:24.809
kind of gonna be the goal in the next,

136
00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:27.269
you know, decades of research is how can we

137
00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:30.190
make that, uh, that part of life healthier. But

138
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.540
I don't think that it's a trade-off. It's not,

139
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.299
I mean, people are living longer because they're not

140
00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:38.109
dying of those early, early aging or even childhood

141
00:06:38.109 --> 00:06:39.709
diseases now. So, and that's all good.

142
00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:45.429
Yeah, uh, but is there a biological limit to

143
00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:48.029
how long we can expect to live?

144
00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.779
Um, OK. So the research that's been done on

145
00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:53.660
that, we have to remember, is all in the

146
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.500
absence of anything that's been done to extend lifespan.

147
00:06:57.579 --> 00:06:59.480
So, for example, a person who lives to be

148
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.500
114 years old today, it's not usually because they

149
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.649
have You know, been taking rapamycin or metformin or

150
00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:11.369
something like that. It's beca it's, it's, that's basically

151
00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:14.809
all genetics, right? So that's a genetic lottery. We

152
00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:17.529
don't yet know what's going to happen to this

153
00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:21.130
next generation of people who have been on lifespan

154
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.290
extending, even if we think of like statins or

155
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.570
I'd say now GLP-1 agonists, um, what's gonna happen

156
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.459
with their lifespans? I don't think we know. So,

157
00:07:29.489 --> 00:07:32.730
the work that's been done, this, the demographic studies

158
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.350
that have been done, Haven't been done on people

159
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.109
that have benefited from any of the science of

160
00:07:38.109 --> 00:07:41.230
longevity that we've been working on. So there may

161
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.309
be a genetic limit, maybe not, that's been debated

162
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:48.579
by demographers, um, for good reason, um, but it

163
00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:51.649
doesn't mean that's gonna always be the case.

164
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:56.470
OK. And so why do we age? I mean,

165
00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:58.260
what's the reason behind it?

166
00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:00.630
I mean, that's a big, so why is a

167
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.350
kind of a bad question to ask a scientist?

168
00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:07.070
Because um we only can look at We can

169
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.339
look at underlying mechanisms, we can look at things.

170
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.269
Why is more of a philosophical question, why we

171
00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:15.380
age? I mean, we could say evolutionarily, right? So,

172
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:22.339
every organism is optimized to End up propagating the

173
00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:27.339
most of its progeny. So evolutionary fitness really has

174
00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:30.220
to do with not lifespan. It has to do

175
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.099
with optimizing how, how much we reproduce given the

176
00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:37.039
times that we have. So it doesn't make sense,

177
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.659
for example, to have progeny in a case where

178
00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:42.849
there's, they're not gonna have any, um, nutrients in

179
00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:46.169
which to survive, right? So organisms then have to

180
00:08:46.169 --> 00:08:49.039
ask them, like, figure out how to adapt to.

181
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.770
Uh, LOW nutrient conditions, stressful conditions, and so, some

182
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.679
of those genetic pathways, molecular pathways that are, are

183
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.250
for that adaptation, sometimes they end up slowing down

184
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:04.429
reproduction, and the side effect basically is extended longevity.

185
00:09:04.969 --> 00:09:07.679
So, there are really, unless you're looking at an

186
00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:09.960
organism that can reproduce until the end of its

187
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.690
life, something like a sea urchin, those, almost no

188
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:20.489
organisms have um extended longevity. Because of, uh, well,

189
00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.289
for, uh, for an evolutionary purpose, because all that's

190
00:09:23.289 --> 00:09:26.690
post-reproductive lifespan. So, we have to really understand how

191
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.849
do animals adapt to stress and how do they

192
00:09:29.849 --> 00:09:33.010
deal with, uh, reproductive fitness in order to understand

193
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.890
anything about why they've survived, and that's different from

194
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.330
lifespan regulation.

195
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:44.330
OK, but then why do we have post-reproductive lifespan?

196
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.070
I mean, from an evo from an evolutionary perspective,

197
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.609
do we understand that?

198
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.070
Um, I would say it's still being studied. So

199
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.869
if you were a sociologist, you'd say it's because

200
00:09:52.869 --> 00:09:57.309
of the grandmother hypothesis, this idea that, um, grandmothers

201
00:09:57.309 --> 00:10:01.830
actually help with the survival of their grand progeny.

202
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.630
Um, THE *** in that armor is that, um,

203
00:10:06.169 --> 00:10:08.260
Actually, a nice, uh, it's kind of amazing, an

204
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.859
undergraduate in my lab years ago did a nice

205
00:10:10.859 --> 00:10:13.200
study where he just asked the question, do you

206
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.780
have to take care of your young, grand progeny,

207
00:10:15.809 --> 00:10:19.770
in order to have an extended post-reproductive lifespan? And

208
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.409
what he discovered was that in fact, there's lots

209
00:10:22.409 --> 00:10:26.010
of organisms, including C. ELEGANS that have long post-reproductive

210
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.090
lifespans, and as far as we know, they do

211
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:31.809
not care for their, uh, grand progeny, OK? So

212
00:10:31.809 --> 00:10:35.909
that suggests that this long post-reproductive lifespan evolved many

213
00:10:35.909 --> 00:10:38.169
times, even the absence of this, you know, what

214
00:10:38.169 --> 00:10:41.780
we'd call the grandmother hypothesis. So, Um, and that

215
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.090
more has to do with how they reproduce. So,

216
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.460
what we, what, you know, really George found was

217
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.900
this kind of interesting connection between the size of

218
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.369
the progeny inside the mother and the mother, OK?

219
00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:56.409
So, his data suggests that he looked at this

220
00:10:56.409 --> 00:10:58.380
huge range of animals. So, all the mammals were

221
00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.820
kind of in one little box at the top

222
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.809
of this graph. But if you look at a

223
00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:03.859
huge range of animals, um, all the way from

224
00:11:03.859 --> 00:11:06.179
like sea elegans, you have like, he had all

225
00:11:06.179 --> 00:11:09.229
kinds of lizards and birds and, um, Uh, sea

226
00:11:09.229 --> 00:11:13.549
urchins. What he found was that the post-reproductive lifespan

227
00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:19.500
actually scales, uh, with the ratio of the progeny

228
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.380
size to the mother. OK? So, think of it

229
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.190
this way, the bigger the progeny are, The harder

230
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.760
it is for the mother to, like, have those

231
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.429
projects without killing herself. And in fact, in humans,

232
00:11:31.479 --> 00:11:33.500
you know, humans, our heads have evolved to be

233
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.809
so big that we don't kill 100% of mothers

234
00:11:35.989 --> 00:11:38.049
who have them, but like some, you know, uh,

235
00:11:38.109 --> 00:11:41.359
maternal mortality is a real thing. OK. So, when

236
00:11:41.359 --> 00:11:43.159
we look at that, we can see that um

237
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.510
animals that have progeny all until like until they're,

238
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.239
those are actually microscopic progeny. So, like that ratio

239
00:11:49.239 --> 00:11:51.020
is very small, so they have a very small

240
00:11:51.159 --> 00:11:54.599
post-reproductive lifespan, OK? So, it really has to do

241
00:11:54.599 --> 00:11:56.945
with reproduction. And how the mode of that the

242
00:11:56.945 --> 00:12:00.354
animal reproduces, and that kind of explains this post-reproductive

243
00:12:00.354 --> 00:12:03.065
lifespan. It has very little to do with like

244
00:12:03.065 --> 00:12:05.424
longevity pathways. It has all to do with reproduction.

245
00:12:05.575 --> 00:12:07.705
And that's kind of been ignored, I think, in

246
00:12:07.705 --> 00:12:10.005
the aging field a lot in the longevity field,

247
00:12:10.265 --> 00:12:13.760
um, Yeah. So, I, I think there's more attention

248
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.119
that should be paid to actually the reproductive part

249
00:12:16.119 --> 00:12:19.070
of lifespan, and that can help us understand, should

250
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.200
we extrapolate from this organism to that organism? Is

251
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.039
it the same or do they just use entirely

252
00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:28.340
different reproductive strategies that then help modulate and adapt,

253
00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:33.739
uh, their, their, uh, longevity in response? I hope

254
00:12:33.739 --> 00:12:34.760
that made some sense.

255
00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:38.979
Yes, yes, it totally made sense. So, but why

256
00:12:38.979 --> 00:12:44.280
are there sex differences in longevity and aging?

257
00:12:44.659 --> 00:12:46.340
Actually, you know, that's another thing you could say

258
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.440
with humans for a human to reproduce entirely different

259
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.179
situation for men than for women, right? And so,

260
00:12:53.489 --> 00:12:56.940
actually, um, You can kind of see that men

261
00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.030
can reproduce pretty late. They have a pretty a

262
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:04.669
fairly relatively short reproductive aging like lifespan or post-reproductive

263
00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:09.320
lifespan. Women have a longer one. I mean, that

264
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.380
it's really, again, evolutionarily, the optimization for whatever reproductive

265
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.909
strategy they have. So, um, I would say that's

266
00:13:17.909 --> 00:13:19.760
really where you'll see the differences. Now, in humans,

267
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.520
of course, uh there's a lot of things that

268
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.440
are shared. And so, if somebody tells you to

269
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.140
exercise, it's probably not gonna be vastly different between

270
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.039
men and women. Um, BUT it is true that

271
00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:32.890
when it comes to things like hormones, for example,

272
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.830
um, Richard Miller, he found through this intervention testing

273
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.669
program, his lab showed that, because they've been testing

274
00:13:39.669 --> 00:13:42.469
all these different compounds, right? And so, in mice,

275
00:13:42.549 --> 00:13:45.770
which again, is a mammalian system that we can

276
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.390
um draw some parallels with humans, they found that

277
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.455
some of the drugs that they Look at actually

278
00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:53.854
have only extend the lifespan of males or females.

279
00:13:54.135 --> 00:13:56.945
So there are sex-specific differences, and again, that probably

280
00:13:56.945 --> 00:14:00.054
comes back to what they're regulating in the reproductive

281
00:14:00.054 --> 00:14:04.094
system that then feeds into the, the, uh, longevity

282
00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:04.655
mechanism.

283
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.640
Mhm. Uh, SO you told us about other animals.

284
00:14:08.719 --> 00:14:11.859
I mean, what have you, we learned about aging

285
00:14:11.859 --> 00:14:16.489
through, uh, model systems and what are the best

286
00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:18.640
models to study aging?

287
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.799
What are the best models? I'm not sure it's

288
00:14:20.799 --> 00:14:22.539
the best model, although I have a, I'll tell

289
00:14:22.539 --> 00:14:25.820
you my favorite in a second. Um, WE'VE learned

290
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.700
almost everything that we know about longevity and aging

291
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.500
from studying model systems. I wanna say that right

292
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.700
now because, um, I think it's very misguided. Uh,

293
00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.299
I just have to say as a scientist right

294
00:14:37.299 --> 00:14:40.380
now, what's happening and gutting of the NIH and

295
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.140
taking away funding from model system research is really

296
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:48.619
gonna kill us like, pretty rapidly. And so, um,

297
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.969
What we know about aging is almost entirely from

298
00:14:51.969 --> 00:14:55.849
model systems. We've discovered, there's been hypothesis testing that

299
00:14:55.849 --> 00:14:57.890
we can do at a rapid time scale. There's

300
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.250
discovery of genetic mechanisms that are extremely well conserved

301
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.590
from invertebrates all the way up to humans. And

302
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.530
of course, we can't really do experiments in humans.

303
00:15:06.609 --> 00:15:08.570
So, when we know something from humans, it's usually

304
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.760
from a large demographic study. So, from genetics, that

305
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.429
way, Um, it's from, uh, you know, looking at

306
00:15:16.429 --> 00:15:18.419
studies where we're looking at a broad swath of

307
00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:21.190
humans. Um, WE can't do the kind of tests

308
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.070
that we need to do. THAT we, we do

309
00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.309
in model systems. So, I, I really think that

310
00:15:26.309 --> 00:15:28.349
people, when they, when they, when we can say

311
00:15:28.349 --> 00:15:31.989
something that happens in humans, other than like genome-wide

312
00:15:31.989 --> 00:15:34.950
association studies, that kind of thing, um, really, what

313
00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.270
we know about a lot of things is from

314
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.659
model systems. And we have invertebrates, we have C.

315
00:15:39.669 --> 00:15:44.070
ELEGANS and Drosophila, so worms and flies. Um, A

316
00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.049
ton of work that's been done in mice, but

317
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.070
often I have to say we discover it first

318
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.510
in C. ELEGANS, then flies, and then, then mice,

319
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.549
and so that's, and that's really how you should

320
00:15:52.549 --> 00:15:54.859
do it because our, um, just solin and C.

321
00:15:54.869 --> 00:15:56.429
ELEGANS are cheap, and we can do a lot

322
00:15:56.429 --> 00:15:58.369
of experiments really quickly. You don't want to spend,

323
00:15:58.989 --> 00:16:01.030
and ethically, it's like a lot easier to think

324
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.770
about that as well, staying out of vertebrates, OK,

325
00:16:04.109 --> 00:16:06.494
now. Uh, I do have a favorite new model

326
00:16:06.494 --> 00:16:09.125
system that I don't work on. Um, THAT'S the

327
00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:11.895
African turquoise killifish. And the reason I love that,

328
00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:15.015
so that's work that, um, Dario Valenzano and Anne

329
00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:18.294
Brune and others have worked on. And that's really

330
00:16:18.294 --> 00:16:20.455
cool because it's a vertebrate, so you have a

331
00:16:20.455 --> 00:16:23.974
vertebrate system, but very short-lived. Within a few months,

332
00:16:24.054 --> 00:16:26.669
you can get all this information. And so then

333
00:16:26.669 --> 00:16:29.059
you're more on the time scale now of Drosophila.

334
00:16:29.359 --> 00:16:31.840
And so you can do experiments that actually like,

335
00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:36.349
then very directly have relevance for, for mammals. And

336
00:16:36.349 --> 00:16:38.909
so, I really love that and um I'm too

337
00:16:38.909 --> 00:16:41.030
lazy to start a new model system myself, but

338
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.989
I really, I really enjoy learning about the experiments

339
00:16:43.989 --> 00:16:45.349
that are done in that system because I think

340
00:16:45.349 --> 00:16:47.450
it's really gonna move the field forward.

341
00:16:48.479 --> 00:16:52.210
OK, but then what kinds of limitations should people

342
00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:56.349
keep in mind when they read scientific literature on

343
00:16:56.349 --> 00:17:00.210
aging in other animals? I mean, to what extent

344
00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:04.310
can we extrapolate from other animals to humans?

345
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.910
I mean, that's a great question. Um, ALL right.

346
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:12.270
So, you know, there's this, this trade-off in science

347
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:17.249
where you can Do fast, rigorous experiments very quickly

348
00:17:17.249 --> 00:17:19.568
and really know the answer in, and it kind

349
00:17:19.568 --> 00:17:22.167
of gets less so as you go higher organisms

350
00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:25.568
because it becomes slower. So, for mice, you you

351
00:17:25.568 --> 00:17:28.328
have like, that's like we're talking about 2, 2.5

352
00:17:28.328 --> 00:17:31.529
years for the longest-lived mice. Um, YEAH, people are

353
00:17:31.529 --> 00:17:34.808
still doing really good experiments. Uh, IN mice, you

354
00:17:34.808 --> 00:17:37.489
have to think about, um, is this answer gonna

355
00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:39.925
be true? If I do it in another strain

356
00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:43.314
of mice, for example, um, there are these, uh,

357
00:17:43.555 --> 00:17:45.435
a lot of the lab mice are one strain,

358
00:17:45.525 --> 00:17:47.994
one genetic background. And so the question is, does

359
00:17:47.994 --> 00:17:50.265
it, you know, if I give this treatment, does

360
00:17:50.265 --> 00:17:53.714
it also work in another background, another strain? And

361
00:17:53.714 --> 00:17:55.905
so people have been getting around that by looking

362
00:17:55.905 --> 00:17:58.594
at, um, using these mice that have more genetic

363
00:17:58.594 --> 00:18:01.194
variation, kind of like people. And so that would

364
00:18:01.194 --> 00:18:05.209
be a follow up. Um, Yeah, I mean, there's

365
00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:07.420
obviously, there's always gonna be something in a model

366
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.819
system that's not gonna directly translate to humans, um,

367
00:18:10.979 --> 00:18:12.739
but I don't wanna pooh-pooh that too much because

368
00:18:12.739 --> 00:18:14.500
I think people make a big deal about that

369
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.160
when it's not actually that big a deal. Like,

370
00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.000
like we need to understand, uh, how things work,

371
00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.939
and we can't just always say. You know, this

372
00:18:23.939 --> 00:18:26.859
works in mice, right? OK, sure. But like, we've

373
00:18:26.859 --> 00:18:28.300
learned a lot and we're gonna be able to,

374
00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.380
so something that's really true and like rock solid

375
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.219
results in mice, um, there are follow-up experiments that

376
00:18:35.219 --> 00:18:38.930
can be done with, with human tissues, with other,

377
00:18:38.939 --> 00:18:41.260
like, eventually, organoids are going to be good enough

378
00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.900
for some of these things. They're, I think they're

379
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.619
still being developed. Um, NON-HUMAN primates, like you want

380
00:18:47.619 --> 00:18:51.750
to save the most Non-human primates, you get into

381
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:56.189
more of the ethical issues and more um expense

382
00:18:56.189 --> 00:18:59.300
issues. And so, I don't think we want to

383
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.349
start pretending that we can't trust anything in mice

384
00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.449
and we have to do everything in non-human primates.

385
00:19:04.079 --> 00:19:05.680
On the other hand, I also don't think that

386
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.640
we should jump straight to humans. Like there's this

387
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.319
push now to like, just, and I, I think

388
00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:13.359
that's unethical as well. So, I mean, I think

389
00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:15.810
everybody who reads a C. Elegance or Drosophila or

390
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:20.160
Mao's paper understands that there are limitations and that

391
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.199
it may not directly translate to humans, but, you

392
00:19:23.199 --> 00:19:25.900
know, evolutionarily, a lot of the molecules we're talking

393
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.060
about are extremely well conserved. So when something has

394
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.579
an effect, it's pretty likely that it will have

395
00:19:32.579 --> 00:19:34.459
an effect. It may be more complicated, involve more

396
00:19:34.459 --> 00:19:36.810
tissues, but, um, most of the people are doing

397
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.810
it like, I think we understand that. Um, AND

398
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.859
so I don't wanna be too critical of Extrapolating

399
00:19:43.859 --> 00:19:47.000
information from all these model systems to humans because

400
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.550
I think there's always gonna be a grain of

401
00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.619
truth there. That's the hope at least.

402
00:19:52.579 --> 00:19:56.359
So earlier when you mentioned uh super centenarians, you

403
00:19:56.359 --> 00:20:01.239
said that for example, if someone lives for 114

404
00:20:01.239 --> 00:20:05.719
years that it's probably due to genetic, uh, to

405
00:20:05.719 --> 00:20:08.739
genetic lottery. I mean, it's just genetic luck, but,

406
00:20:09.079 --> 00:20:12.915
uh, I mean, do we already know. Something more

407
00:20:12.915 --> 00:20:17.875
about the secrets, let's call them that of centenarians'

408
00:20:17.875 --> 00:20:20.915
long lifespans, because I'm asking you that because anytime

409
00:20:20.915 --> 00:20:24.795
that someone lives that long, of course, journalists go

410
00:20:24.795 --> 00:20:27.435
and ask them what's their secret, and I mean

411
00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:29.635
their answers are all over the place.

412
00:20:29.864 --> 00:20:33.515
Yeah, so exactly. In fact, actually it's hilarious to

413
00:20:33.515 --> 00:20:35.314
read this, and the vast majority of them, I

414
00:20:35.314 --> 00:20:39.010
don't know if you've noticed, um, mention alcohol. Which

415
00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.810
is hilarious. It's not a recommendation that anyone else

416
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.250
would make. And, um, all the women mentioned staying

417
00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.959
away from men, which is probably just a, a,

418
00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.660
a coping mechanism maybe at some point because like,

419
00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:52.619
uh, the women tend to live, you know, like,

420
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.530
usually 9 of the 10 longest-lived human beings right

421
00:20:55.530 --> 00:21:00.369
now are women, OK. I don't And for them,

422
00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:05.510
that may be very true. But, here, um, Right.

423
00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:08.479
So, these are people who really have won the

424
00:21:08.479 --> 00:21:10.849
genetic lottery because it turns out if you look

425
00:21:10.849 --> 00:21:14.119
in their genomes, right? So, we know from genome-wide

426
00:21:14.119 --> 00:21:17.520
association studies of these exceptionally long-lived people that there's

427
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.969
a handful of genes that are probably associated with

428
00:21:19.969 --> 00:21:24.329
that, right? So, there's, um, And so, we know

429
00:21:24.329 --> 00:21:27.400
what those are, but if you look in the

430
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.910
gen the, their genetic backgrounds, they often will still

431
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:36.209
have the deleterious mutations associated with other things. In

432
00:21:36.209 --> 00:21:39.739
fact, some of them even have the APOE4 allele

433
00:21:39.739 --> 00:21:44.410
that for other non-centenarians, gives them Alzheimer's. So, there's

434
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.400
something kind of amazing about the genetics. And so,

435
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.849
that's why I'm saying, I don't think it's, it

436
00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:50.449
really is a lottery in the sense that they

437
00:21:50.449 --> 00:21:54.140
didn't necessarily do something. That's gonna help them live

438
00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.939
long. It's all the things that they attribute to

439
00:21:55.939 --> 00:21:57.979
living long, like, you know, eating this, you know,

440
00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.859
one boiled egg a day or something, you know,

441
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.219
stuff like that. It just, it, it can't, that

442
00:22:03.219 --> 00:22:04.979
can't be believed, right? And you can see that

443
00:22:04.979 --> 00:22:07.339
in their responses because it's so varied, right? A

444
00:22:07.339 --> 00:22:09.250
lot of them are smokers, you know, no one

445
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.800
else gets away with that, um. Yeah, so, uh,

446
00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:16.079
it's not really a secret in what they've done.

447
00:22:16.199 --> 00:22:19.560
I think they've really just really lucked out. And

448
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.959
then it brings the question, what can we learn?

449
00:22:21.079 --> 00:22:22.550
Well, we can learn the genetics, but I don't

450
00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.910
think we can learn lifestyle things from that. I

451
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.599
think it's gonna be interesting in the next couple

452
00:22:26.599 --> 00:22:30.479
of years where we figure out, um, from people

453
00:22:30.479 --> 00:22:32.560
who are, do not have those genetics. And I

454
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.560
think we're seeing that in some countries where people

455
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.880
are living really long. It really is due to

456
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.280
lifestyle differences, right? And so, the lifestyle differences, that's

457
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.310
what we can all learn from. So, that, that's

458
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.339
something where we'll, we'll And that'll probably lead to

459
00:22:47.339 --> 00:22:50.540
better health as well. So, I think, um, it's

460
00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.380
been interesting to see that, but there's nothing you

461
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.479
can do if you don't have the right alleles

462
00:22:55.819 --> 00:22:58.260
that a centenarian has, there's, uh, I don't think

463
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.680
anyone's gonna go in and CRISPR their genome, right?

464
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.219
So, it's too late for that, but we can

465
00:23:03.219 --> 00:23:05.300
learn from the lifestyle changes, and maybe there's gonna

466
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.099
be eventually a drug. For example, if you have

467
00:23:07.099 --> 00:23:09.989
a certain allele and it does some job, Um,

468
00:23:10.229 --> 00:23:13.709
then maybe that's something that's worth studying for like

469
00:23:13.709 --> 00:23:16.869
developing a longevity drug. So I think that, and

470
00:23:16.869 --> 00:23:18.109
they probably, I'm not the first one to think

471
00:23:18.109 --> 00:23:19.670
of that. I'm sure many people are already working

472
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:21.439
on that. So that's really what we can learn

473
00:23:21.439 --> 00:23:23.469
from those centenarians, not really like what they ate

474
00:23:23.469 --> 00:23:27.329
or drank or smoked or Or anything like that.

475
00:23:27.719 --> 00:23:30.770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, please don't think that smoking or

476
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:35.949
drinking will increase your life. Exactly. Uh, SO, uh,

477
00:23:35.959 --> 00:23:39.469
in, in the book you talk about longevity pathways.

478
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.760
What are those and what do we know about

479
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:42.910
them?

480
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.609
Yeah. So, sort of as I alluded to earlier,

481
00:23:45.689 --> 00:23:47.050
a lot of things that we think of as

482
00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.290
longevity pathways, and we taught them that because we

483
00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.689
found, uh, for example, in Cal is a mutants.

484
00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.650
So, Cynthia Kenyon identified daf-2, so that's an insulin

485
00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:59.689
receptor. And, um, well, Gary Roen actually cloned it

486
00:23:59.689 --> 00:24:02.375
and then identified as daf-2, but Uh, as an

487
00:24:02.375 --> 00:24:06.295
insulin receptor, but the daf-2 mutant lives really long.

488
00:24:06.415 --> 00:24:08.895
It lives twice as long, and the animals are

489
00:24:08.895 --> 00:24:11.775
super healthy. And in pretty much every assay we've

490
00:24:11.775 --> 00:24:13.814
ever done, we found that they have better memory,

491
00:24:14.334 --> 00:24:16.494
they have better learning, even with age, they have

492
00:24:16.494 --> 00:24:19.454
better learning and memory, like, proportionally longer, they have,

493
00:24:19.494 --> 00:24:23.810
um, They are able to reproduce longer because the

494
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:28.900
quality of their ooocytes stays higher longer. Um, Yeah.

495
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.520
So, they do a lot of things better. And

496
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.319
it's not because they necessarily, they do have a

497
00:24:33.319 --> 00:24:35.760
slight delay in development, but not proportional to this

498
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.719
huge massive increase in lifespan. OK. So, that's an

499
00:24:38.719 --> 00:24:41.520
example of a gene that was identified because of

500
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:46.040
its lifespan phenotype, so it's longevity phenotype. And um

501
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.359
through the years, uh, Cynthia and then other people

502
00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:51.089
figured out other genes in that pathway, right? So,

503
00:24:51.099 --> 00:24:52.719
we think of that pathway is something that kind

504
00:24:52.719 --> 00:24:56.900
of flips the switch. Um, BUT As I mentioned

505
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.300
in the book, it's a little bit of a

506
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.020
misnomer. I call them longevity pathways, because really what

507
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.020
they're doing is not messing with longevity. They're allowing

508
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:08.180
the animal to tune their reproductive strategy to the

509
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.300
environment around them, right? So, in the wild, a

510
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.979
wild-type worm will, if there's not enough food or

511
00:25:14.979 --> 00:25:18.189
if it, if it has like Too many nearby

512
00:25:18.189 --> 00:25:20.829
neighbors, so that puts out pheromone. If it senses

513
00:25:20.829 --> 00:25:22.449
too many of those or if it's too hot,

514
00:25:22.869 --> 00:25:24.670
then really what it wants to do is say,

515
00:25:24.709 --> 00:25:26.920
OK, this is not a good time to have

516
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.329
have progeny, right? So, what I want to do

517
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.550
is turn everything for reproduction down, but I also

518
00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:35.349
want to keep my other tissues, my somatic tissues

519
00:25:35.349 --> 00:25:37.640
healthy, so that when I slip things back, Back

520
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.880
on, I'll be healthy enough to reproduce. OK? So

521
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.439
now you can start seeing that there's this switch,

522
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.359
like this neuronal like decision that gets made, that

523
00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:49.189
tells the germline what to do. So, like, slow

524
00:25:49.189 --> 00:25:52.239
down making progeny, maybe don't like stretch that out,

525
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.910
even developmentally, maybe I slow down everything. And then

526
00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.819
there's a signal from the germ line that tells

527
00:25:56.819 --> 00:25:59.780
the body, OK, You can't come out of this

528
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.780
looking like an 80 year old. You gotta like

529
00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.219
be young and healthy. So let's slow down all

530
00:26:04.219 --> 00:26:08.020
those processes. Let's, let's like maintain somatic health, OK?

531
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.020
So then, when they come out of it, they

532
00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.040
can reproduce. And so the, the sort of like

533
00:26:14.099 --> 00:26:17.660
side benefit of that is that those animals will

534
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.979
now live long, OK? So that's a pathway that

535
00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:23.770
makes all those decisions based on information it gets

536
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:26.380
from the environment. And the cool thing is like,

537
00:26:26.959 --> 00:26:29.079
We have those same pathways. We have those same

538
00:26:29.079 --> 00:26:31.630
genes. They regulate many of the same things, not

539
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.599
always for the exact same purpose. We can't, you

540
00:26:33.599 --> 00:26:36.160
know, sense that there's like a bad environment and

541
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.439
then go into a dour state. But, um, if

542
00:26:39.439 --> 00:26:41.880
there's low nutrients, for example, like that does turn

543
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.949
on autophagy and other things to help clean up

544
00:26:43.949 --> 00:26:46.040
ourselves. And so, those are kind of things that

545
00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.790
like, That's why people like these ideas of dietary

546
00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.709
restriction cause they can kind of like turn on

547
00:26:52.709 --> 00:26:55.469
some of these pathways that we know work for

548
00:26:55.469 --> 00:26:58.109
these purposes of keeping an animal young and healthy

549
00:26:58.109 --> 00:26:59.130
while they reproduce.

550
00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:04.229
And I mean, are there already any interventions that

551
00:27:04.229 --> 00:27:07.739
can be applied to these longevity pathways?

552
00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:11.829
Yeah, so that's a great question. Um, In the

553
00:27:11.829 --> 00:27:14.550
dietary restriction area, right? So people are very excited

554
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:18.760
about uh rapamycin and metformin and other, those kinds

555
00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.229
of things that are in that pathway. And I

556
00:27:20.229 --> 00:27:22.229
think a few of the drugs that are being

557
00:27:22.229 --> 00:27:25.589
identified through these intervention testing programs and also will

558
00:27:25.589 --> 00:27:28.010
eventually turn out to be like in that pathway.

559
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:29.949
But the cool thing is that's not the only

560
00:27:29.949 --> 00:27:33.959
pathway, that there's multiple in parallel. Um, The diet

561
00:27:33.959 --> 00:27:36.520
to the, uh, sorry, the insulin signaling pathway, I

562
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.119
was kind of surprised that, you know, that hasn't

563
00:27:38.119 --> 00:27:41.329
been, um, as developed as you, you would think,

564
00:27:41.719 --> 00:27:43.599
given the fact that we've known for like 30

565
00:27:43.599 --> 00:27:46.199
years that those mutants live long. Uh, THERE was

566
00:27:46.199 --> 00:27:47.989
a paper out of, I think, Australia a couple

567
00:27:47.989 --> 00:27:50.319
of years ago where they found a drug that

568
00:27:50.319 --> 00:27:53.160
actually does increase the longevity of mice through that

569
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.239
pathway. So that's pretty cool. So that suggests that

570
00:27:55.239 --> 00:28:00.280
we can perhaps use the same, uh, genetic pathway

571
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.930
to live long. I think actually these, uh, there's

572
00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:06.939
gonna be new drugs that come on that actually

573
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.550
are gonna be found to work through those pathways,

574
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.800
but they weren't developed for that reason. Um, AND

575
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.439
so, I, I think we don't know the answer

576
00:28:14.439 --> 00:28:17.390
yet. So, it'll be an interesting Couple of years

577
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:20.630
to see where, uh, whether there's any longevity drugs

578
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.859
that will come online. I, I actually think that,

579
00:28:22.869 --> 00:28:26.400
um, GLP-1 agonists, the reason I'm kind of excited

580
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.219
about those is because those are having all these

581
00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.869
unintended effects and most of them, like 90% of

582
00:28:33.869 --> 00:28:36.599
them are beneficial. And so, we'll see if any

583
00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:38.800
of those trigger, I, I think people just didn't

584
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.239
know what they did, exactly. They knew some things,

585
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.239
but not all the things. And so that could

586
00:28:43.239 --> 00:28:45.560
be really, uh, really interesting.

587
00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:50.979
Yeah, uh, can factors that we inherit from our

588
00:28:50.979 --> 00:28:54.959
ancestors affect aging? I mean, and if so, what

589
00:28:54.959 --> 00:28:57.599
are these factors and how do they work?

590
00:28:57.959 --> 00:29:00.479
OK, so this is where I'm gonna like deviate

591
00:29:00.479 --> 00:29:04.510
from my usual model systems. I think that um,

592
00:29:05.209 --> 00:29:06.969
You know, we found, you're probably asking this question,

593
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:11.689
because we found Some of these transgenerational pathways and

594
00:29:11.689 --> 00:29:14.770
sea elegans, um, that seem to do with really

595
00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:18.650
about survival in the face of pathogens in their

596
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.849
environment. So, we've seen that those C. ELEGANS can

597
00:29:21.849 --> 00:29:26.369
actually pass on that information for 4 generations. Um,

598
00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:30.219
I think for mammals, it's a little bit less

599
00:29:30.219 --> 00:29:33.609
clear to me. It's clear that there's transgenerational information

600
00:29:33.609 --> 00:29:36.170
that works really well in plants, and that may

601
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.449
have to do with their situation, right? Like they

602
00:29:38.449 --> 00:29:42.369
have to, like, um, pass on information from past

603
00:29:42.369 --> 00:29:45.800
seasons to their progeny to survive. Um,

604
00:29:46.349 --> 00:29:47.829
BUT, but, but, by the, by the way, how

605
00:29:47.829 --> 00:29:50.449
do they pass on that information? Is it through

606
00:29:50.449 --> 00:29:51.949
epigenetics, or, yeah,

607
00:29:52.069 --> 00:29:54.329
so this is all epigenetics. So in, in plants,

608
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.729
the primary mechanism seems to be through DNA methylation.

609
00:29:58.069 --> 00:30:02.109
Um, THERE is in C elegans, there's a lot,

610
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.989
uh, there's a couple of different fat pathways that

611
00:30:04.989 --> 00:30:09.109
involve things like histone methylation, so these epigenetic regulators

612
00:30:09.109 --> 00:30:12.900
that are around the, the DNA. Um, THE pathway

613
00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.300
we found involves smaller RNAs but may ultimately we

614
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.329
think might impinge on the histone methylation because worms

615
00:30:19.329 --> 00:30:23.790
don't have DNA methylation, um. In humans, I think

616
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.229
the jury is still out, but of course, you

617
00:30:25.229 --> 00:30:27.189
can't do the real, like, there's been these things

618
00:30:27.189 --> 00:30:30.270
called natural experiments. And so we'll, we'll have to

619
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.829
see uh what exactly happens and what the mechanisms

620
00:30:33.829 --> 00:30:35.489
underlying that. It's just a little bit, you know,

621
00:30:36.489 --> 00:30:38.790
Obviously, you can't do the same kinds of experiments

622
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:42.050
and um in mice, I know a lot less

623
00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.910
about that. I think there's discussion about, there's some

624
00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.010
things that seem to be very solid results and

625
00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.930
other things that don't seem so solid. So I

626
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:51.609
don't wanna wade into that. I think the jury

627
00:30:51.609 --> 00:30:53.050
is still out. We, we'll still be looking at

628
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:53.439
that.

629
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.579
So at this point in time, what do we

630
00:30:56.579 --> 00:31:01.020
know about the ways that we eat can influence

631
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:01.680
aging?

632
00:31:02.689 --> 00:31:06.119
Um, WELL, there's the kind of obvious things, but

633
00:31:06.119 --> 00:31:10.640
I think, um, and there's a general sense that

634
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.660
eating less would probably be good, but I think

635
00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.339
that we need to refine some of that, like

636
00:31:16.339 --> 00:31:19.500
eating less of what exactly, right? Like, um, and

637
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.189
that may be again the system where like, Maybe

638
00:31:22.189 --> 00:31:24.910
what's true in one model system may not be

639
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:28.709
true in another, right? So, um, right, so I

640
00:31:28.709 --> 00:31:31.540
think we still need to understand that better, um,

641
00:31:31.949 --> 00:31:34.030
for example, you would, there's a chance that you

642
00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.469
could eat all the calories you want to if

643
00:31:35.469 --> 00:31:38.790
you had the right balance of carbohydrates, fats, and

644
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:42.550
proteins. Um, I just think we just don't fully

645
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:46.099
know that yet, um. There's also the idea of

646
00:31:46.099 --> 00:31:48.640
intermittent fasting and other things, and, uh, that actually,

647
00:31:48.739 --> 00:31:51.319
that's been really a kind of wild ride because

648
00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.979
first, everybody thought that would be better, um, but

649
00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:57.020
then there's more recent evidence that it's not so

650
00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.420
great. And so, I think we need to better

651
00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.439
understand all of these things. I mean, you could

652
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.650
Just take it and say, well, I'm just gonna

653
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:07.400
live my life in moderation and not eat so

654
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.729
much and not drink so much. So, but if

655
00:32:09.729 --> 00:32:11.609
you really wanted to like just pinpoint and say,

656
00:32:11.689 --> 00:32:13.130
this is the one thing I'm gonna do to

657
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:15.530
live long, actually, I think that exercise is probably

658
00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.239
the one thing. Regardless of what we eat, and

659
00:32:18.239 --> 00:32:19.479
I may be wrong down the road, but I

660
00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:24.160
think that, um, there's something very important about staying

661
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.959
active, and, in particular, like our muscles seem to

662
00:32:27.959 --> 00:32:32.479
actually do a lot of really positive things for

663
00:32:32.489 --> 00:32:35.839
keeping us young and healthy. And so, um, not

664
00:32:35.839 --> 00:32:39.560
just cardio, but also doing things like weight-bearing exercises.

665
00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.420
Weightlifting, things like that, especially for older people, seems

666
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.800
to be extremely beneficial, even for things like bone

667
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.300
density. And so I think for me, I, I

668
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.180
focus, maybe, I don't know, just because I like

669
00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:55.030
eating, but um I focus less on worrying about

670
00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:59.579
what I eat and instead, um really getting enough

671
00:32:59.579 --> 00:33:02.119
exercise and making sure that, that, I think that,

672
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.819
and every person can be different, but I think

673
00:33:04.819 --> 00:33:08.349
that for most people, If they can get exercise,

674
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:10.150
it'll help them in a lot of ways that

675
00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.750
just um constantly being obsessed with what they eat

676
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.939
is not gonna be that be beneficial, and they

677
00:33:14.939 --> 00:33:17.739
could actually be wrong. Because we just don't know

678
00:33:17.739 --> 00:33:17.900
yet.

679
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:22.170
Uh, uh, AND, and what if you exercise a

680
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:24.910
lot, but you also eat a lot, and so,

681
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:29.089
I mean, uh, uh, your BMI is high. I

682
00:33:29.089 --> 00:33:31.609
mean, do you think that BMI itself is a

683
00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:32.829
good enough metric?

684
00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.890
Oh, well, BMI is a is, is a famously

685
00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:38.709
bad metric, right? So someone who's in super shape.

686
00:33:39.099 --> 00:33:43.020
And has really high, uh, muscle density, right, they're

687
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.930
gonna have a moderately high BMI that has nothing

688
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:48.099
to do with body fat. So I think we

689
00:33:48.099 --> 00:33:50.780
can say in general fat cells seem to be

690
00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.739
bad. Fat cells secrete things that are bad. So

691
00:33:53.739 --> 00:33:57.739
like it's probably good to not have high fat

692
00:33:57.739 --> 00:34:01.680
on our bodies, um. One thing that's unfortunate with

693
00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.040
age is there's like, especially with menopause, there's actually

694
00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.360
um deposition of fat that's inside. It's not so

695
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.120
obvious, but it surrounds our tissues, our organs and

696
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.879
things, and that is a little bit, seems to

697
00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:14.719
be less healthy, and that's harder to get rid

698
00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:18.918
of too. Um, SO, but again, perhaps one of

699
00:34:18.918 --> 00:34:22.080
these things with having more, um, muscle mass actually

700
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.360
could be very beneficial there in fighting off some

701
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.239
of those detrimental effects.

702
00:34:27.438 --> 00:34:29.350
So I mean at this point in time when

703
00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:33.120
it comes to caloric restriction and things like intermittent

704
00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.239
fasting, I, I'm asking you that because of course

705
00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.280
in recent years we've heard a ton about that,

706
00:34:38.438 --> 00:34:42.320
about that and many claims made about its supposed

707
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.438
health benefits. I mean at this point in time

708
00:34:44.438 --> 00:34:45.580
we're not sure.

709
00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:48.250
I don't think, I think the jury is out.

710
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.409
I think it's really. I think what the people

711
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:54.668
you hear enthusiastic things about caloric restriction from are

712
00:34:54.668 --> 00:34:57.510
a subset of people who are gonna be very

713
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.790
enthusiastic about that. For a lot of people, that's

714
00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:05.860
not realistic, um, I Uh, yeah. Um, AND it's

715
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.600
not clear that the controls have been done to

716
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.979
actually say whether it's healthy or not. We know

717
00:35:10.979 --> 00:35:14.979
in a lab setting with mice, the calorically restricted

718
00:35:14.979 --> 00:35:17.419
animals actually live longer and they seem to be

719
00:35:17.419 --> 00:35:21.500
healthier. Um, WE know that that's true for rhesus

720
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.659
macaques as well. Um, FOR humans, of course, there

721
00:35:25.659 --> 00:35:29.620
is a social element to eating. There's a, you

722
00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:34.219
know, a psychological element to restricting calories. And so

723
00:35:34.219 --> 00:35:35.899
I think it's just a harder thing to do

724
00:35:35.899 --> 00:35:38.600
in humans. And so it's not necessarily, it's not

725
00:35:38.979 --> 00:35:41.780
fun. And so some people, I, I, I know

726
00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.219
some people who have done it, and they're very

727
00:35:43.219 --> 00:35:46.810
like. DOGMATIC about it. I just, for me, I

728
00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.649
just can't see it ever as being the thing

729
00:35:48.649 --> 00:35:52.290
that we'd want people to do necessarily. There are

730
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.330
situations though, for example, I think that is true

731
00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:59.219
that some There's been evidence that brief fasting or

732
00:35:59.219 --> 00:36:02.379
dietary restriction around the time of a surgery or

733
00:36:02.379 --> 00:36:04.770
certain medical treatments can be extremely beneficial. And so,

734
00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.860
I think that's the stuff that's really interesting. If

735
00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:11.219
you could increase the survival or reduce this hospital

736
00:36:11.219 --> 00:36:13.780
time by doing like, or taking one of these

737
00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:17.129
like, um sort of fasting diets, that would be

738
00:36:17.129 --> 00:36:19.219
interesting. But as a permanent way of life, I

739
00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:24.090
think it just sounds miserable. Yeah, uh,

740
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:28.100
and what is the role of DNA repair and

741
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:33.209
cell replacement and things like a telomere length and

742
00:36:33.209 --> 00:36:33.919
things like that,

743
00:36:34.169 --> 00:36:37.129
right, so those are each, uh, different mechanisms by

744
00:36:37.129 --> 00:36:42.129
which animals have been shown to regulate aging. Telomeres

745
00:36:42.129 --> 00:36:44.800
were the big deal years ago, but mostly becomes,

746
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:48.479
has to do with how How long cells can

747
00:36:48.479 --> 00:36:52.199
divide, because if a cell has no ends of

748
00:36:52.199 --> 00:36:54.800
its chromosomes anymore because it's been eaten back by

749
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.699
like reproducing, like replicating many times, they're not gonna

750
00:36:58.699 --> 00:37:01.959
survive anymore. So, um, and that's called the hay

751
00:37:01.959 --> 00:37:05.320
flip limit. Um, WHETHER you could actually get a

752
00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.439
longer life out of adding more telomeres to the

753
00:37:08.439 --> 00:37:10.020
end, like longer telomeres to the end of your

754
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.280
chromosomes, that jury is still out on that. I

755
00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.229
think that hasn't proven to be extremely successful. Um,

756
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.530
DNA repair is probably really important, and one of

757
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.610
the GWAS, the genes that's come up in human

758
00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:24.709
longevity, just actually has to do with DNA repair.

759
00:37:24.979 --> 00:37:28.209
So that's probably a real thing, um, that regulates

760
00:37:28.209 --> 00:37:30.889
how long we can live. And then what was

761
00:37:30.889 --> 00:37:32.770
the last thing you asked about, um, uh,

762
00:37:32.969 --> 00:37:33.530
cell

763
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:37.229
replacement, cell replacement. I mean, look, you know, that's

764
00:37:37.489 --> 00:37:41.889
stem cells we're seeing as actually a growing, um.

765
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:45.989
Therapeutic, in fact, and we'll see how well that

766
00:37:45.989 --> 00:37:47.449
works out, um.

767
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:51.300
But do you think it's a promising avenue or

768
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:51.540
not?

769
00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.250
I think that it is. And in fact, actually,

770
00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:58.040
um, yeah, let's see, how do I say this?

771
00:37:58.959 --> 00:38:00.580
It, it's interesting to know. I think that the

772
00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:04.300
longevity field could take a hint from, uh, from

773
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.270
looking at what pro athletes do. Pro athletes do

774
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:12.070
the things that make them, uh, perform best in

775
00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:15.040
the fastest time like they. And if you look

776
00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.899
at the treatments that they get, it's like, you

777
00:38:16.899 --> 00:38:19.659
know, decades ahead of what you actually get, like

778
00:38:19.659 --> 00:38:22.649
an average person gets in a clinic, right? And

779
00:38:22.649 --> 00:38:25.139
so I think that, that's kind of interesting cause

780
00:38:25.139 --> 00:38:27.540
then there's more and more of this um like

781
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:32.939
during like surgical repair that combined with uh stem

782
00:38:32.939 --> 00:38:36.820
cell therapeutics. It's kind of interesting, right? So, um,

783
00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.909
Yeah, I think that there's lots of avenues. The

784
00:38:40.909 --> 00:38:43.350
thing that's aging, about the aging field that's really

785
00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:45.669
interesting to me, it's, it's not gonna be just

786
00:38:45.669 --> 00:38:48.570
one answer. You know, we break down in a

787
00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:51.600
lot of different ways. And so a few of

788
00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.959
these things could be really helpful, and they may

789
00:38:53.959 --> 00:38:56.439
be like done in parallel. And so I think

790
00:38:56.439 --> 00:38:58.389
there's like, it's kind of, um, we'll see which

791
00:38:58.389 --> 00:39:02.479
ones are most. Uh, EFFICACIOUS, but I think we

792
00:39:02.479 --> 00:39:04.040
can't say there's just one thing. And that's why

793
00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.280
I kinda wanna get away from the whole caloric

794
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.600
restriction thing because even though that probably regulates a

795
00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.439
bunch of different things, I think there's other things

796
00:39:09.439 --> 00:39:10.800
that we're gonna be able to do that will

797
00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.060
help people live longer.

798
00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:16.010
So let me ask you about another thing that's

799
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:19.330
been on the news a lot recently and there's

800
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.810
been a lot of work done on it. What

801
00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:25.850
about our gut microbiome? I mean, does it have

802
00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:29.449
any relationship with aging or not?

803
00:39:29.929 --> 00:39:32.409
OK, so the gut microbiome, that was one of

804
00:39:32.409 --> 00:39:34.729
those things that's kind of like overhyped for a

805
00:39:34.729 --> 00:39:36.570
long time, but there's always a grain of truth.

806
00:39:36.649 --> 00:39:41.120
OK, so we know that the, the microbiome in

807
00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.050
our gut changes with age, and actually changes with

808
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.250
health, OK? So that's a correlation, right? So we

809
00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:49.534
have to keep that in mind. So, for example,

810
00:39:49.655 --> 00:39:54.135
there is a set of bacteria that are present

811
00:39:54.135 --> 00:39:59.294
in young healthy guts, right? And with age, there's

812
00:39:59.294 --> 00:40:02.614
fewer of those good healthy bacteria and more of

813
00:40:02.614 --> 00:40:05.415
these like less healthy ones, right? So we know

814
00:40:05.415 --> 00:40:08.774
there's changes. The question becomes like what is causing

815
00:40:08.774 --> 00:40:12.135
what regulates this, OK, um, and there's some really

816
00:40:12.135 --> 00:40:16.534
cool experiments showing that if you could transfer, um,

817
00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:22.060
microbes from the gut of healthy animals to older

818
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.929
or less healthy animals that you can help them

819
00:40:23.929 --> 00:40:26.620
repair, OK? And so, that's actually like, that is

820
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:31.989
actually a clinical thing that's done. So, um, Uh,

821
00:40:32.689 --> 00:40:35.929
FMT, so fecal microbial transfer, is actually done to,

822
00:40:36.129 --> 00:40:38.729
especially in like cases where someone's entire gut has

823
00:40:38.729 --> 00:40:41.370
been wiped out by an infection or, or needs

824
00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:44.689
to be replaced, OK? So, there's a, you know,

825
00:40:44.889 --> 00:40:47.570
so it's not fantasy, it's actually a true thing

826
00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:51.820
and actually very helpful. Now, do I know whether

827
00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.939
like the capsules that someone is selling to like

828
00:40:55.939 --> 00:40:59.419
have young gut microbiome is actually useful? I, that

829
00:40:59.419 --> 00:41:02.659
I don't know. And there's an uh even cooler

830
00:41:02.659 --> 00:41:04.379
thought, which is that maybe we could figure out

831
00:41:04.379 --> 00:41:06.780
why they're useful, right? Uh, OH, I want to

832
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.620
back up and say that there's a nice um

833
00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.860
experiment that was done by um Dario Valenzano, where

834
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:16.260
they took the They wiped out in killifish, they

835
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:20.459
wiped out the gut of a micro gut microbiome

836
00:41:20.739 --> 00:41:23.860
of animals, and then they replaced it with the

837
00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.620
young microbiome, and they were extend, they extend the

838
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.459
lifespan of these fish. OK? So that's super cool.

839
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.750
OK, so it does suggest there's something there. But,

840
00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.239
you know, it'd be nicer just to figure out

841
00:41:33.239 --> 00:41:36.250
like, what are the young microbes produce? And it

842
00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:38.320
seems like they produce metabolites that could be super

843
00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.439
healthy. And so, on these short chain fatty acid,

844
00:41:41.479 --> 00:41:43.719
things like that, maybe those are the key. And

845
00:41:43.719 --> 00:41:45.540
so that could actually become something that would help

846
00:41:45.679 --> 00:41:48.360
someone eventually. So, I think there's been a lot

847
00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.709
of stuff where you like, there's correlation, but we

848
00:41:50.709 --> 00:41:52.840
have to distinguish cause and effect, and I think

849
00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.080
that uh the field is actually getting closer to

850
00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:55.919
figuring that part out.

851
00:41:57.179 --> 00:42:00.219
Right, I mean, this is just speculation on my

852
00:42:00.219 --> 00:42:03.979
part, but since the gut microbiome also seems to

853
00:42:03.979 --> 00:42:07.139
be affected by diet, do you think that if

854
00:42:07.139 --> 00:42:11.219
we can establish a causal relationship between the gut

855
00:42:11.219 --> 00:42:17.530
microbiome and aging, then, uh, diet, at least indirectly,

856
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.729
could also play a role

857
00:42:18.729 --> 00:42:22.350
there. I think that that's probably very true. So,

858
00:42:22.429 --> 00:42:26.110
and, and part of eating a better diet, especially

859
00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:28.270
one that like with yogurt and things that can

860
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.719
actually help, that, that might be useful. Um, WHETHER

861
00:42:31.719 --> 00:42:34.959
it's gonna make you live like 2 weeks longer,

862
00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.110
2 years, that I don't know. OK, so that's,

863
00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.030
that's what I was saying I can't really like

864
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.320
say that, but I think there's nothing wrong with

865
00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.600
saying that there's actually differences in our microbiome with

866
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:49.080
age, and because of that rise in deleterious microbes,

867
00:42:49.159 --> 00:42:51.439
uh, replacing them with good microbes could only be

868
00:42:51.439 --> 00:42:51.899
helpful.

869
00:42:52.679 --> 00:42:56.620
OK, and what, how would you characterize the current

870
00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:59.889
state of longevity, uh, longevity biotech?

871
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.060
Well, longevity biotech is really thriving. And part of

872
00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:07.540
the, the, uh, excitement is the fact that what

873
00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.419
I just said, there's many different ways that we

874
00:43:09.419 --> 00:43:13.090
can attack the problem. And so, I think, um,

875
00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.929
as a result, some of the stuff is moving

876
00:43:14.929 --> 00:43:18.500
out of academia. I mean, the academic discoveries are

877
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.510
still continuing. I, I actually want to say this

878
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.300
very clearly, if academia fails, it's gonna be really

879
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:27.239
bad for biotech because We do, like, you know,

880
00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:29.659
it's like the iceberg, right? Like you need that

881
00:43:29.919 --> 00:43:33.439
basis to make the decisions and discoveries that will

882
00:43:33.439 --> 00:43:36.159
take things to the biotech because biotech's risky. So

883
00:43:36.159 --> 00:43:37.719
you only want to take the things that are

884
00:43:37.719 --> 00:43:40.479
the most likely and then help develop those, and

885
00:43:40.479 --> 00:43:43.000
then eventually those will make its way into like

886
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.360
mainstream pharmaceutical. So, um, I think there's a ton

887
00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.800
of interesting things going on right now. And, um,

888
00:43:50.409 --> 00:43:52.010
I'm not a betting person, so I'm not gonna

889
00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:53.649
say which one of those are most likely, but

890
00:43:53.649 --> 00:43:56.489
I think that there's real potential for moving some

891
00:43:56.489 --> 00:43:58.169
of the things that we've discovered in the past

892
00:43:58.169 --> 00:44:02.000
couple of decades into real useful treatments for people.

893
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:04.399
And that's at some of the biotech and then

894
00:44:04.399 --> 00:44:07.169
eventually it'll make it into, uh, into bio into

895
00:44:07.169 --> 00:44:07.929
pharmaceuticals.

896
00:44:08.899 --> 00:44:13.340
In your opinion, how seriously should we take those

897
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:17.699
kinds of uh experiments that some billionaires are doing

898
00:44:17.699 --> 00:44:21.419
on themselves in terms of trying out many different

899
00:44:21.419 --> 00:44:23.570
things to see if they can live longer?

900
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:26.179
OK, so in science, the way we do science

901
00:44:26.179 --> 00:44:30.060
is we do things with controls. We change one

902
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:32.969
variable at a time. So that we can actually

903
00:44:32.969 --> 00:44:35.889
interpret the results. So what you described is not

904
00:44:35.889 --> 00:44:41.850
an experiment. It's just doing something. It's not gonna

905
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:45.439
lead to like, how would you know. How would

906
00:44:45.439 --> 00:44:47.070
you know at the end of all these, like,

907
00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.639
what's, what they're doing to themselves? I will say

908
00:44:49.639 --> 00:44:54.310
one thing. The most effective way to live longer

909
00:44:54.530 --> 00:45:00.310
is to be rich. It's sad, right, because rich

910
00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:03.000
people have access to the best, best food, healthcare,

911
00:45:03.469 --> 00:45:06.679
exercise, normal sleeping schedules. They are not worried about

912
00:45:06.679 --> 00:45:08.639
food deserts, right? They can actually get everything they

913
00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:11.399
need. And so, um, I think we'll never know

914
00:45:11.399 --> 00:45:13.679
if a billionaire who's doing a million things to

915
00:45:13.679 --> 00:45:18.070
themselves daily. If they live long or not, it's

916
00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.620
gonna be due to any of the things that

917
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.669
they're doing to themselves. So, it's not, it's not

918
00:45:21.669 --> 00:45:22.870
informative, in my opinion.

919
00:45:23.879 --> 00:45:26.110
Yeah, uh, I mean, that's actually very true. Uh,

920
00:45:26.239 --> 00:45:28.239
THE last time I looked at the sort of

921
00:45:28.239 --> 00:45:32.639
longevity gap between rich people and poor people in

922
00:45:32.639 --> 00:45:35.449
the US, it's like in the order of 10

923
00:45:35.449 --> 00:45:37.439
years of difference or something like

924
00:45:37.439 --> 00:45:39.590
that. Yeah, yeah, a lot of that can be

925
00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:45.580
attributed to. Preventative healthcare, right? Because if you're poor,

926
00:45:45.739 --> 00:45:47.929
you cannot afford to go in to see a

927
00:45:47.929 --> 00:45:49.899
doctor when you start to feel kind of sick.

928
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.909
You might wait until you're really sick, right? Uh,

929
00:45:55.729 --> 00:45:59.120
GOOD food in this country is very expensive compared

930
00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.679
to cheap, like bad food, so there's all kinds

931
00:46:01.679 --> 00:46:05.209
of, there's a million little decisions. That get made,

932
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:08.510
uh, for pretty logical choices, you know, poor people

933
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:12.070
are not illogical. They just are, they have a

934
00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:15.310
limited set of options, and so they're making, doing

935
00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:17.110
their best to get by, and that's not the

936
00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:18.989
same set of options that a rich person has.

937
00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:21.790
And so that really leads to those, uh, discrepancies

938
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:24.979
as a huge differential, as you mentioned, in lifespan.

939
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.520
That's right.

940
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.169
Yeah, and I mean if poor people, if someone

941
00:46:28.169 --> 00:46:30.610
has to work 2 or 3 jobs just to

942
00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:33.229
pay their bills, I mean, they don't have any

943
00:46:33.229 --> 00:46:35.489
time at all to be cooking. I mean, they

944
00:46:35.489 --> 00:46:38.129
just have to eat fast food most of the

945
00:46:38.129 --> 00:46:38.530
time.

946
00:46:38.889 --> 00:46:40.969
Or in fact, what you just mentioned, it's also

947
00:46:40.969 --> 00:46:43.889
super stressful. So high stress is very bad for

948
00:46:43.889 --> 00:46:47.250
us, and shift, shift work, like working late at,

949
00:46:47.439 --> 00:46:50.000
like at night shifts and things, that's really messed

950
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.439
up. So there's all that's what I'm saying, it's

951
00:46:51.439 --> 00:46:54.469
like, and it's probably cumulative. And there's even this

952
00:46:54.469 --> 00:46:57.840
cumulative stress of living in a, like, being feeling

953
00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.439
poor actually raises your stress levels. So, like, all

954
00:47:01.439 --> 00:47:04.520
these things, um, so, you know, when a rich

955
00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.760
person lives a long time, uh, I think a

956
00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.439
lot of people want to believe it's because they've

957
00:47:08.439 --> 00:47:09.959
done a good job taking care of themselves, but

958
00:47:09.959 --> 00:47:12.909
it's really because of these structural inequities that are,

959
00:47:13.199 --> 00:47:16.550
are, uh, You know, like if you're poor, you're

960
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:19.199
fighting up an uphill battle to live a long

961
00:47:19.199 --> 00:47:21.179
time or even have a healthy life. Yeah,

962
00:47:21.719 --> 00:47:24.459
yeah, and I mean, uh, uh, to be more

963
00:47:24.459 --> 00:47:28.919
specific, what kinds of molecules are being targeted for

964
00:47:28.919 --> 00:47:31.899
clinical treatment when it comes to waging?

965
00:47:32.399 --> 00:47:34.280
Well, right now there's a lot of attention for

966
00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:37.600
in the caloric restriction pathway. MTOR is really a

967
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.320
thing that people are trying to target through multiple

968
00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:43.399
mechanisms, but in fact, there's a lot of, uh,

969
00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.459
If you like, if I showed you a slide

970
00:47:45.459 --> 00:47:47.979
of everything that is around that MTOR regulation, there's

971
00:47:47.979 --> 00:47:50.020
a lot of other proteins that actually could be

972
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:56.550
targets as well, um. I'm just trying to think.

973
00:47:58.399 --> 00:48:00.040
And that's probably the place where the most is

974
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.439
being developed, but I don't think it's where it

975
00:48:01.439 --> 00:48:02.800
should be. The only, the only place where it

976
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.800
should be, oh, there's also autophagy, I think they're

977
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.719
being developed, uh, autophagy promoters, because actually, that could,

978
00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.199
that's, you know, also the longevity field. I just

979
00:48:11.199 --> 00:48:12.520
want to step back and say that the longevity

980
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.479
field is taking advantage of like research has been

981
00:48:14.479 --> 00:48:16.310
done in a lot of areas as well, uh,

982
00:48:16.439 --> 00:48:18.479
such as cancer, right? So that's where some of

983
00:48:18.479 --> 00:48:20.590
the drugs that are being found to be beneficial

984
00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.080
for cancer treatments actually turned out to be helpful

985
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.899
for longevity as well. Um, SENOLYTICS, so like drugs

986
00:48:27.899 --> 00:48:30.979
that target senescent cells. So, senescent cells are not

987
00:48:30.979 --> 00:48:32.879
just dying cells, they're actually cells that are super

988
00:48:33.179 --> 00:48:35.699
unhealthy and they actually secrete things that are bad

989
00:48:35.699 --> 00:48:37.540
for other cells. So, targeting, the idea is if

990
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.060
you target them, you get rid of them. And

991
00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.659
I, I heard a nice story in this field

992
00:48:41.659 --> 00:48:46.550
that I really like. Uh, IS that senolytics might

993
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:50.679
be helpful for people who have had childhood cancers

994
00:48:50.679 --> 00:48:52.600
and they survived that, but then later on, it

995
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.120
turns out they have a lot of accelerated age-related

996
00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:59.360
diseases. So, senolytics might be useful in helping those

997
00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.939
people just even have a normal lifespan. So I

998
00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:04.500
think there's a lot of things, and I'm probably

999
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.860
forgetting some because there's just so many. Like every

1000
00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.739
chapter of my book, we talked about a different

1001
00:49:08.739 --> 00:49:12.979
like pathway or um mechanism and like you can

1002
00:49:12.979 --> 00:49:15.139
imagine if you find the proteins are in the,

1003
00:49:15.219 --> 00:49:17.659
the genes that are responsible that they can become

1004
00:49:17.659 --> 00:49:22.149
new targets, right? So pharmaceutical targets, so um. That's

1005
00:49:22.149 --> 00:49:24.310
why I didn't just say like, you know, restriction

1006
00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:26.419
and we're done. There's actually really a ton of

1007
00:49:26.419 --> 00:49:28.510
different things that are going on. So, each one

1008
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:30.830
of those, even, like if you think creatively, like

1009
00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:32.790
most of them could probably be developed into some

1010
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:35.110
sort of uh pharmaceutical treatment.

1011
00:49:35.939 --> 00:49:39.929
Yeah, so just one final question then, how, how

1012
00:49:39.929 --> 00:49:43.179
can we develop new treatment, and I mean, what

1013
00:49:43.179 --> 00:49:45.899
is the best approach for, for us to develop

1014
00:49:45.899 --> 00:49:49.370
new, new treatments for age-related decline?

1015
00:49:49.739 --> 00:49:53.679
Ah, OK, so, um, so one of the barriers

1016
00:49:53.679 --> 00:49:55.540
that you might be aware of is this idea

1017
00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:59.889
that, um, aging is not considered an FDA. Treated

1018
00:49:59.889 --> 00:50:02.570
disease, right? And so that makes it difficult to

1019
00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:04.510
do things like clinical trials and so that's been

1020
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.429
the effort by um Neer Bar Barzilai and others

1021
00:50:09.429 --> 00:50:13.229
to try to develop, um, car, carry out clinical

1022
00:50:13.229 --> 00:50:15.389
trials that you really use aging as an endpoint.

1023
00:50:15.419 --> 00:50:17.590
But of course, as you noted earlier in the

1024
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:19.510
program, there's a lot of things that happen with

1025
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:23.550
age, age-related diseases. And so, uh, one clever approach

1026
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:26.429
that several companies have used is to instead like

1027
00:50:26.429 --> 00:50:29.830
target one of those age-related diseases and say, OK,

1028
00:50:29.949 --> 00:50:32.540
does my You know, does the drug that I

1029
00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.179
have, does it slow down this or that, OK?

1030
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:38.100
So, for example, there's things with the eyes, right?

1031
00:50:38.179 --> 00:50:40.610
So, like, age-related problems with the eyes, we can

1032
00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:43.879
look at that. We have things like osteoarthritis, um,

1033
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.879
lots of things that are not They're saying is

1034
00:50:46.879 --> 00:50:49.199
proxies of aging. So we don't have to ask

1035
00:50:49.199 --> 00:50:51.080
the question, does this drug make someone live longer?

1036
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.520
We can ask, does it actually treat this disorder

1037
00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:57.800
that I'm, that's an age-related disorder? And if so,

1038
00:50:58.199 --> 00:51:00.560
then, you know, you could probably market it for

1039
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.790
that one thing, but you might have the benefit

1040
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:05.379
of living longer as well. Yeah.

1041
00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:08.979
OK, so the book is again How We Age,

1042
00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.879
The Science of Longevity. I'm leaving a link to

1043
00:51:11.879 --> 00:51:14.520
it in the description of the interview. And Doctor

1044
00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.840
Murphy, just before we go, would you like to

1045
00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.790
tell people where they can find you and your

1046
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:21.000
work on the internet?

1047
00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:25.870
Uh, uh, YEAH, so I, um, I'm a professor

1048
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:27.659
at Princeton, and so if you just look up

1049
00:51:27.659 --> 00:51:29.790
Princeton in my name, you'll find me. I have

1050
00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:31.750
a lab here and I also am the director

1051
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:35.709
of the Louis Siegler Institute for Integrative Genomics, and

1052
00:51:35.709 --> 00:51:37.209
so, uh, that's a link there.

1053
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:40.689
