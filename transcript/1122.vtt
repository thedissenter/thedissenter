00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.430
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.269
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.470
today I'm joined by Doctor Danielle Rodriguez. She's an

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.510
invited assistant professor at University of Catholic Portuguese, where

5
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.069
she teaches master students about the cognitive foundations of

6
00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:23.104
language. She studies gestural communication. Human and nonhuman primates.

7
00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:26.645
And today we're going to talk about exactly that

8
00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:32.485
communication in non-human pri and non-human apes, gestures, child-directed

9
00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:37.525
communication, language, and some other related topics. So Daniela,

10
00:00:37.564 --> 00:00:40.185
welcome to the show. It's always, it's a pleasure

11
00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:40.645
to everyone.

12
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.099
Thank you, Ricardo. Thank you for the invitation, and

13
00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:49.639
it's a real pleasure to be here. So, uh,

14
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.090
let,

15
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.009
let me start by asking you, which kind of

16
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:58.799
non-human apes have you studied the most just to

17
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.720
uh have a little bit of background here.

18
00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:05.470
So actually, I, I was lucky enough to, to

19
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.819
study lots of different primates. Uh, IT was mostly

20
00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:15.540
behavior studies, uh, but I studied some lemurs, um,

21
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.470
also some crabby eating macaques, mandrills, uh, and then

22
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.230
also chimpanzees, uh, and I focus mostly on, on

23
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.830
chimpanzees during my PhD and even a bit before

24
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.309
my PhD I already started like collecting data in

25
00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:34.360
chimpanzees, yes. And

26
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.349
what kinds of,

27
00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:37.080
yeah,

28
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.239
yeah, sure, sure. No, no, no worries. What kinds

29
00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:44.760
of communication do you study in non-human apes?

30
00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:50.209
Um, SO I, so most of my work is

31
00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:55.690
in gestures, so usually researchers in private communication study

32
00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.930
vocalizations, uh, facial expressions or gestures, and early work

33
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.250
was just focused on each modality. Uh, LAST decades,

34
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.660
I would say that people tend to to study

35
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.190
these different modalities together, at least having those, uh,

36
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.619
this modality into account. Um, SO most of my

37
00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:21.059
work is in gestures, but we have like, I,

38
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.699
I've been collecting also data in vocalizations and facial

39
00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:27.729
expressions. So my first studies have all these modalities

40
00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.539
into account and then I specialize in in gestural

41
00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.979
research.

42
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.639
So what kind of gestures do you study in

43
00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.369
nonhuman apes?

44
00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:44.910
Um, SO, mostly it's, um, it's a bit different

45
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.350
from human research because we study like all body

46
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.179
gestures and we we use a different methodology like

47
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.149
uh different names, I would say it's an approach

48
00:02:55.149 --> 00:03:00.229
that is more descriptive, uh, so, um, it's basically

49
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.539
we have lots of uh uh things in common.

50
00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:07.460
Um, BUT the way we address gestures in human

51
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.740
research and in human research, it's a bit different.

52
00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.669
So what I try to do, and because I

53
00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.190
study also humans, adjusters in humans, I use the

54
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.949
same approach and I use the this descriptive approach

55
00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:21.990
that is more common in primates, and I use

56
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.949
the these same names, this same approach to study

57
00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:28.869
both. So, for example, we, it's only a subset

58
00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:32.710
of the gestures that we have in humans. I'm

59
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.690
aware that In human research uh in the gesture

60
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.940
domain, um, we have lots of different things, um,

61
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.100
but for example, in nonhuman primates, we tend to

62
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.350
be more cautious in Uh, interpreting, for example, gestures

63
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.990
or uh to consider it a gesture in the

64
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.610
first place. So we study a subset of these

65
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.990
gestures, uh, for example, the ones that are communicative,

66
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.910
the intentional gestures, the ones that involve a change

67
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.710
in the behavior of the recipient. So of course

68
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.589
we know that we cover only a small part

69
00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:11.589
of the gestural world, uh, but I would say

70
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:14.179
that most of the research in a human primates,

71
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.309
it's this subset of gestures.

72
00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:21.470
So I know that you've studied greetings and leave

73
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.390
taking. So what are they?

74
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.989
So greetings and leave takings are basically the little

75
00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:33.429
rituals that we do, uh, when we say hello,

76
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.709
like say hello and goodbye to people when we

77
00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:38.989
meet or when we are about to leave. Um,

78
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.519
SO I studied those kind of rituals, uh, the

79
00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.989
the signals that are changed during the arrivals and

80
00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:49.980
departures. Uh, IN one of one community of chimpanzees.

81
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.910
So we had like a really great setting where

82
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.980
you have like this outdoor laboratory where they would

83
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.320
go there to to crack some nuts and uh

84
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.230
they would uh join uh others that were already

85
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.709
there, for example, and they will live also at

86
00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:09.179
different times, so it's, it was a perfect setting

87
00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:11.339
to to check if they greet each other or

88
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.160
if they say goodbye. Um, AND yeah, basically it's

89
00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:20.290
So it's hard to tell if they actually are,

90
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.549
if I arrive up to a place and say

91
00:05:23.549 --> 00:05:27.410
hello, or if I just saying how the weather

92
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.679
is like outside, like in other place, it's hard

93
00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:32.989
to tell what is a greeting or not. So,

94
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.679
of course, we, at least in our study, what

95
00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:38.459
we did is considering all the signals that are

96
00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:41.279
changed during the arrivals or during departures, but of

97
00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:45.420
course, this doesn't mean that our greetings are Uh,

98
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.950
leave takings, you know, so then we have like

99
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.829
some challenges and probably we'll talk about this a

100
00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:55.290
bit later. Um, BUT yeah, it's basically these kind

101
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.980
of signals that we change when we meet someone

102
00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:59.510
or when we are about to leave.

103
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.670
But how do you go about studying these kinds

104
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.739
of gestures? I mean, how do you know that

105
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.670
when they do a particular kind of gesture, they're

106
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.589
doing a greeting or a leave taking?

107
00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:18.420
Yeah, so this is the first challenge. So we

108
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.149
have actually considered and we have lots of variability

109
00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:26.109
uh in definitions if you check in the literature,

110
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.279
um, and this is quite challenging because then we

111
00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:34.279
if you want to to know. If this species

112
00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.079
of, if it's like some greetings reported in this

113
00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:41.109
community, for example, the way people define a greeting,

114
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.679
uh, it's quite different from, for example, other research

115
00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:47.720
groups and sometimes it's a bit hard then to

116
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.070
compare results in different communities in different, even in

117
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.839
the same species if the research is conducted by

118
00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:56.559
different people. So this is the first challenge like

119
00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:59.959
about the definition. So some people consider a greeting

120
00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:03.510
even if For example, chimpanzees or other animals, if

121
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.140
they are already present, but they approach other individuals

122
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.869
a bit closer, and they could greet each other.

123
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.230
So like the signals if it is changed during

124
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:17.269
that um interaction. But other ones will involve like

125
00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:20.299
uh they, they would need to, to have like

126
00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:24.790
um a separation, a physical separation in the, the

127
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.269
physical space, I would say. So for more, for

128
00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:29.549
example, than 5 minutes, others like it's more than

129
00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:33.380
1 hour absent. So, of course, this will also

130
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.790
uh will imply different interpretations and results. Um, LEAVE

131
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.790
takings, it's another story because it's not very uh

132
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.910
studied, um, but even for, for the, but the

133
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.600
challenges are are similar. I would say because greetings

134
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.279
are a bit more studied and involve what are

135
00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:54.760
the types of signals that we already know a

136
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.760
bit about the functions and how they are so

137
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.470
important in maintaining and keeping relationships. Uh, IT'S, it's

138
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.440
somehow easier, but we face similar problems because sometimes

139
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.630
we tend to overinterpret some, some of the things,

140
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.100
uh, and for example, the leave takings, uh. We

141
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.630
are not sure sometimes if we, even for, we

142
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.309
are very cautious about uh the, the signals and

143
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:25.269
choosing the signals um that are changed that we

144
00:08:25.269 --> 00:08:28.059
can consider a gesture, for example, or not, um,

145
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:32.400
and I, I would say that we cannot be

146
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.229
super sure about. ABOUT the nature of the justice.

147
00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.638
Firstly, first of all, because it's um the clarity

148
00:08:40.638 --> 00:08:42.717
in nature, so if I say goodbye, I don't

149
00:08:42.717 --> 00:08:45.989
expect also that the others will change the behavior

150
00:08:45.989 --> 00:08:50.719
and uh Well, uh, it, it basically the, the,

151
00:08:50.729 --> 00:08:54.760
the, the communication that the gesture communication studies usually,

152
00:08:55.169 --> 00:08:58.099
uh, as I mentioned before, focus on the subset

153
00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:02.369
of communication that imply, uh, changing the commun changes

154
00:09:02.369 --> 00:09:06.169
in the behavior uh of the recipient, they imply

155
00:09:06.169 --> 00:09:09.229
intentional uh criteria, so lots of different things that

156
00:09:09.229 --> 00:09:11.460
sometimes it's hard to tell, you know taking if

157
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.789
these are occurring or not, right? Mhm.

158
00:09:15.229 --> 00:09:20.489
And uh in chimpanzee, fusion fusion societies which you've

159
00:09:20.489 --> 00:09:24.590
studied, how do these gestures work? And by the

160
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.179
way, what is a fusion fusion society?

161
00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:34.960
Uh, SUFFICIENT fusion societies are, uh, societies like when

162
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.580
individuals basically come and go, uh, pretty often, so,

163
00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:41.479
so they don't spend all the time together and

164
00:09:41.479 --> 00:09:44.969
uh this is actually super important because of course,

165
00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.359
to understand a bit the the role of greetings

166
00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:52.510
and risk takings because if in one community, um,

167
00:09:52.719 --> 00:09:55.369
you spend all the time together, maybe greetings and

168
00:09:55.369 --> 00:09:58.380
risk takings are not so important, right? Uh, BUT

169
00:09:58.609 --> 00:10:02.330
in your like in your community, if you come

170
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.320
and go pretty often, sometimes you can spend, uh,

171
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.289
like a few hours or days without seeing the

172
00:10:10.289 --> 00:10:15.880
other individuals. Um, OF course, things happen, uh, outside,

173
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.650
like, uh, and you'll probably meet other individuals, and

174
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.450
it's super important, if greetings are so important to

175
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:29.335
maintain and Uh, to, to check social relationships among

176
00:10:29.335 --> 00:10:32.655
each other, um, it's in these moments they invest

177
00:10:32.655 --> 00:10:36.265
a lot, uh, not only to to greet and

178
00:10:36.265 --> 00:10:39.614
to be able to check if they were standing

179
00:10:39.614 --> 00:10:44.424
in the same place as they before the other

180
00:10:44.424 --> 00:10:47.215
individuals also to inform the other one's present. So

181
00:10:47.505 --> 00:10:51.385
they have a very important role in these societies

182
00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:55.520
when they don't. Uh, THEY, they're not together all

183
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.419
the time.

184
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.650
Yeah. And so I, I read in your work

185
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.979
that there are some contextual and social factors that

186
00:11:04.979 --> 00:11:09.330
play a role in who, when, and how chimpanzees

187
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.090
greet. Uh, TELL us about that.

188
00:11:12.409 --> 00:11:17.099
Um, SO one important thing, uh, to start with

189
00:11:17.099 --> 00:11:21.559
is that Uh, they don't greet all the time.

190
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.369
Like, even if they, so they arrive to a

191
00:11:24.369 --> 00:11:28.169
place and we probably would assume that they will

192
00:11:28.169 --> 00:11:31.130
at least say hello to 11 present and actually

193
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.210
in our study we've seen that in half, more

194
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.530
than a bit more than half of the cases,

195
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.630
um they Didn't greet anyone, so it happens sometimes

196
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:46.210
they just arrive and they start nuts and do

197
00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:50.070
other behaviors and so this is also important just

198
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.830
to have uh to have this in mind, um,

199
00:11:53.849 --> 00:11:56.010
but then of course if they arrive to a

200
00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.119
place and there is like a group of chimpanzees,

201
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.349
they don't greet everyone present, so they are super

202
00:12:02.349 --> 00:12:06.440
selective in the ones that are uh greeting. Usually

203
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.070
it's high ranking individuals or um or males or

204
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.400
a specific individual for some reason because of course

205
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.690
there is all these contacts about what happened before

206
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.669
or the mood of the group, if they are

207
00:12:18.669 --> 00:12:21.669
aroused or not. So of course there's like all

208
00:12:21.669 --> 00:12:24.250
these things that they have into account and sometimes

209
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:29.080
for us as a researcher, it is very difficult

210
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.840
to, to have, of course, we collect data on

211
00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:34.000
most of the things that we can uh collect,

212
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.049
but sometimes if they It's impossible. We are not

213
00:12:37.049 --> 00:12:41.530
following them 24 hours and it's hard to complete

214
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.809
the puzzle of the, the social complexity they they

215
00:12:44.809 --> 00:12:49.489
have. Um, BUT yeah, I, I, I think at

216
00:12:49.489 --> 00:12:54.880
least, uh, knowing, uh. We, we know that um

217
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:59.599
this social complexity has of like their lives plays

218
00:12:59.599 --> 00:13:03.679
in super important role, um, and we do our

219
00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:07.690
best, but it's it's hard like to To tell,

220
00:13:07.729 --> 00:13:09.530
I would say, I don't know if we are

221
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:13.489
going into this a bit later, but uh so

222
00:13:13.489 --> 00:13:16.369
for example, as I said before, so the, the

223
00:13:16.369 --> 00:13:18.780
ones they choose to greet, it's one of the

224
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.849
important things, and sometimes they choose not to greet

225
00:13:21.849 --> 00:13:26.739
at all. Different, uh, individuals, but so these social

226
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.710
uh rules they have in the group. So for

227
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.869
example, hierarchy plays an important role. So, uh, the

228
00:13:33.869 --> 00:13:38.309
kinship, um, so they also will, depending on the

229
00:13:38.309 --> 00:13:41.030
relationship they have with each individual, they, they may

230
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.539
choose, for example, OK, this is a friend or

231
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.909
a kin like it's, I, I have like A

232
00:13:48.909 --> 00:13:52.109
more predictable outcome if I would communicate with my

233
00:13:52.109 --> 00:13:54.109
friend. So maybe I will invest a bit more

234
00:13:54.109 --> 00:13:57.070
in greeting like one male that I'm not so

235
00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.659
confident if, if, if it's OK with me approaching,

236
00:14:00.669 --> 00:14:04.559
you know. Um, SO I would say that these

237
00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:08.440
contextual factors that I mentioned before, like arousal, what

238
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.239
happened before, for how long they don't see each

239
00:14:11.239 --> 00:14:15.080
other, but also these social relations between them, and

240
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.049
also another important thing, it's like the audience, like

241
00:14:18.239 --> 00:14:20.515
the ones. Present or not, sometimes they get more

242
00:14:20.515 --> 00:14:22.875
confident, for example, if they could have like some

243
00:14:22.875 --> 00:14:27.315
friends, uh, some allies nearby, of course, or they

244
00:14:27.315 --> 00:14:30.155
may feel a bit insecure if there's like my

245
00:14:30.155 --> 00:14:33.155
males or high ranking individuals there, and maybe they

246
00:14:33.155 --> 00:14:36.395
would prefer not to greet anyone present or, you

247
00:14:36.395 --> 00:14:36.825
know.

248
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.270
Yeah. So you mentioned social rank there. I have

249
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:45.429
here uh somewhat of a list of other factors

250
00:14:45.429 --> 00:14:48.390
which I read about in your work. How about

251
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:53.270
kinship? I mean, do chimpanzees tend to greet uh

252
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.309
other chimpanzees who are genetically related to them?

253
00:14:58.099 --> 00:15:01.739
Um, SO usually what we've seen at least in

254
00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:04.099
this study is that they are not investing much

255
00:15:04.099 --> 00:15:08.059
inbreeding. Uh, YEAH, if they are, uh, their kidneys,

256
00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.690
like if there's like someone uh related to them,

257
00:15:11.859 --> 00:15:15.659
um, they usually prefer to invest, invest the greetings

258
00:15:15.659 --> 00:15:21.710
in other, um. Non-related individuals. So it was quite

259
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.669
and it's why we think that maybe about the

260
00:15:24.669 --> 00:15:27.580
this uncertainty of the outcomes, so chimpanzees sometimes get

261
00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.020
pretty aggressive and I've seen in some videos that

262
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.580
I analyzed that, so for example, if someone would

263
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.179
greet. A male that is not very high ranking

264
00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:42.270
and the alpha male is nearby, uh, you would

265
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:46.150
be like someone just because, OK, you beat this

266
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.390
male first, you know, so they are a bit

267
00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:54.200
uh so aggressive sometimes depending on the situations, um,

268
00:15:54.469 --> 00:15:56.934
but so for example, if they have a More

269
00:15:56.934 --> 00:15:59.934
close relationship, even if it's not kin, uh, I,

270
00:15:59.974 --> 00:16:03.534
I only focused or only coded these relationships if

271
00:16:03.534 --> 00:16:06.784
they were or not related, but also we, we

272
00:16:06.784 --> 00:16:09.934
see this in, in more close individuals. So if

273
00:16:09.934 --> 00:16:12.275
they are friends, if they spend more time together,

274
00:16:12.655 --> 00:16:15.135
uh, they are kind of more tolerant to each

275
00:16:15.135 --> 00:16:18.724
other and it's not super important to signal, uh,

276
00:16:18.734 --> 00:16:22.215
that I, my friendly intent of coming by, you

277
00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:27.849
know, so we didn't see um. IN terms of

278
00:16:27.849 --> 00:16:32.830
um frequency of greetings, um, much greetings with related

279
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:33.450
individuals.

280
00:16:34.729 --> 00:16:38.609
Uh, HOW about, uh, their, their position as a

281
00:16:38.609 --> 00:16:42.929
traveler or party member? Does that influence the way

282
00:16:42.929 --> 00:16:43.690
they red?

283
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.590
We also didn't find evidence for that. So, for

284
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.429
example, I don't know, in some cultures also this

285
00:16:50.429 --> 00:16:53.750
in humans these varies, so maybe, of course, in

286
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.109
chimpanzees and it's one thing that I want to

287
00:16:56.109 --> 00:17:00.369
mention, so this was only in one community, um,

288
00:17:00.659 --> 00:17:04.390
in, in Western African chimpanzees, so we also need

289
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.510
to be aware that this can vary a lot

290
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:09.739
in different communities. But at least in this study,

291
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.888
we didn't find evidence. So if it was the

292
00:17:12.888 --> 00:17:15.068
one that was already in the party, like in

293
00:17:15.068 --> 00:17:17.338
the group, or the one that was joining the

294
00:17:17.338 --> 00:17:19.489
group that was greeting or not, so we didn't

295
00:17:19.489 --> 00:17:22.128
find any evidence and, for example, in some cultures,

296
00:17:22.249 --> 00:17:24.928
maybe in human cultures, it's more common than the

297
00:17:24.928 --> 00:17:26.848
one that is arriving, for example, that is the

298
00:17:26.848 --> 00:17:30.529
one that is greeting, um, but here, yeah, we

299
00:17:30.529 --> 00:17:33.769
didn't find and the same for example, so we

300
00:17:33.769 --> 00:17:38.530
focused on Not only the communication of this individual

301
00:17:38.819 --> 00:17:42.060
when arriving, but we studied them to be able

302
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.619
to address the, the selective nature of their greetings,

303
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.329
we studied all the possible interactions between that individual

304
00:17:50.579 --> 00:17:53.140
and the other ones present. Uh, IF they were

305
00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.939
traveling together, even uh or separated by 5 minutes

306
00:17:57.939 --> 00:18:00.949
or 10 minutes or wherever we were studying. The

307
00:18:00.949 --> 00:18:04.510
behavior like the possible communication occurring during these individuals

308
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:07.560
with everyone, and to be able to say, OK,

309
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.020
they were preferring to to communicate with this individual,

310
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.189
um, and also, for example, if they were traveling

311
00:18:14.189 --> 00:18:17.439
together or separated by a short amount of time,

312
00:18:17.589 --> 00:18:20.910
they would not greet those uh those chimpanzees. So

313
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.310
it was this uh travel or party member position

314
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.979
and also the this possibility of being traveling together

315
00:18:28.469 --> 00:18:30.140
that didn't have an impact.

316
00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:34.109
Mhm. I also read about the level of potential

317
00:18:34.109 --> 00:18:38.069
threat, but what constitutes, first of all, what constitutes

318
00:18:38.069 --> 00:18:41.790
a potential threat in these kinds of societies and

319
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:44.790
then how does it influence uh greeting?

320
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:51.140
Um, SO, mostly, um, we, we address this by

321
00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.300
different contexts, and so, and the level of arousal

322
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.020
we consider so when they were super aroused, if

323
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.329
there was like a fight before, like usually agonistic

324
00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:05.219
contexts and sexual contexts, they also get really aroused.

325
00:19:05.484 --> 00:19:09.114
Um, AND it's where we consider, we only divided

326
00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:13.694
in three general levels, uh, so high arousal, neutral,

327
00:19:13.704 --> 00:19:18.055
and low arousal, and these, uh, constitutes so that

328
00:19:18.055 --> 00:19:21.895
the, the high arousal would constitute mostly agonistic and

329
00:19:21.895 --> 00:19:26.560
sexual context, for example, neutral would be. Uh, FEEDING,

330
00:19:26.689 --> 00:19:31.849
resting, like the things that are most often don't

331
00:19:31.849 --> 00:19:36.609
involve much uh social interactions, but, um, although they

332
00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:39.209
are all engaging in the same place doing the

333
00:19:39.209 --> 00:19:43.890
same thing, and low arousal would be some affiliative

334
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.869
contacts, for example, they, they were pretty more uh

335
00:19:47.869 --> 00:19:51.099
relaxed, I would say. And so, and this is

336
00:19:51.099 --> 00:19:54.469
how this impact greetings, um, we see that these

337
00:19:54.469 --> 00:19:58.489
neutral contexts and we would expect for that. Um,

338
00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:02.069
THEY, they usually don't, uh, in the terms of

339
00:20:02.069 --> 00:20:05.310
frequency, they don't involve much greetings like we've seen

340
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.310
that in. Uh, IN, in the exchange of signals.

341
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:12.229
So in our, uh, arousal context, they would change

342
00:20:12.229 --> 00:20:14.430
more often, uh, signals and also when they are

343
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.630
pretty relaxed, it's also like a safe place sometimes

344
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.280
to change more signals. So it's like either I

345
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.449
arousal or uh. Low arousal and then the way

346
00:20:24.449 --> 00:20:26.530
they greet will vary. So of course, if they

347
00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.010
are super nervous, for example, what we see more,

348
00:20:29.089 --> 00:20:33.890
they will use lots of vocalizations, um, and when

349
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.810
they are a bit more relaxed, they would use

350
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.900
more gestures, for example. Um, BUT in greetings in

351
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.050
general, I would say, and one of the most

352
00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.930
known signals exchange and here in our study too

353
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:51.089
is the pangrams, this vocalization that is also high,

354
00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.500
um, connected to the, the dominance in the, the

355
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.140
ranks of the individuals, usually it's the lower ranking

356
00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:01.140
individuals that um vocalize towards high ranking, uh, and

357
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.339
this was one of the most um the the

358
00:21:04.339 --> 00:21:08.560
signals most uh present in our study. Mhm.

359
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:13.349
Uh, THIS is something that you mentioned briefly earlier,

360
00:21:13.479 --> 00:21:18.150
but how about the presence of mature males? How

361
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.920
do they influence, uh, greetings?

362
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:26.400
Um, So it's the same in our study, it

363
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.020
was the same trend that there was like also

364
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.729
reported in a pangrant studies, like also greeting studies,

365
00:21:32.739 --> 00:21:35.540
but with this vocalization I mentioned before, and there

366
00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.180
was like this inhibitory effect. So when there were

367
00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.050
like other metro males present or high ranking individuals,

368
00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:46.660
um, they tended to to greet less. So yeah,

369
00:21:46.939 --> 00:21:50.260
but at least, so we always measure this. Possibility

370
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.689
to greet one of the opportunity to greet each

371
00:21:53.689 --> 00:21:56.180
individual. So in terms of this big pool, we

372
00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:00.550
found that they can inhibitory effect that was already

373
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.540
reported to penmans, but here in our study because

374
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.979
we included all vocalizations, also facial expressions and gestures,

375
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.369
we found that the same front. Yeah.

376
00:22:11.849 --> 00:22:16.930
So that's about chimpanzees. What about humans? What do

377
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.250
we know about the greetings and leave takings in

378
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.680
human societies?

379
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.750
Uh, SO there is a lot of variation in

380
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:30.469
culture, so I would say it's universal because you

381
00:22:30.469 --> 00:22:34.619
can see it like across the globe, um, and,

382
00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:38.810
but the way people greet each other or they,

383
00:22:38.869 --> 00:22:40.989
they say goodbye to each other, it varies a

384
00:22:40.989 --> 00:22:47.000
lot. Um, SO for example, Even the the the

385
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.819
same thing that I mentioned before, if I arrived

386
00:22:48.819 --> 00:22:51.699
to a place, maybe I may choose to greet

387
00:22:51.699 --> 00:22:57.390
just one person or everyone, um, maybe I don't,

388
00:22:57.459 --> 00:23:00.099
uh, in some cultures they don't, and we can,

389
00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.989
I think I will see this later, they don't

390
00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:05.099
uh address children, for example, or they will, they

391
00:23:05.099 --> 00:23:08.900
can just greet the chief of the tribe, you

392
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.979
know, or so the way, so there are also

393
00:23:13.979 --> 00:23:16.719
differences in. The people you choose to greet when

394
00:23:16.719 --> 00:23:19.119
you arrive at place or to say goodbye, but

395
00:23:19.119 --> 00:23:22.910
also in terms of uh the signals you change.

396
00:23:23.119 --> 00:23:26.160
So we, we also have this flexibility in the

397
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.150
same culture to use different signals depending on who

398
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.349
you greet. For example, of course, if I would

399
00:23:32.349 --> 00:23:37.239
read maybe um A university professor might be a

400
00:23:37.239 --> 00:23:41.160
bit more formal or different, um, if I, uh,

401
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.130
if I with a friend, of course, and even

402
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.810
if I with a friend like that I see

403
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:51.410
yesterday, uh, that it's, it's different from the, if

404
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:55.569
I see this the same friend like if I

405
00:23:55.569 --> 00:23:58.199
didn't see him like in 3 years or 4,

406
00:23:58.329 --> 00:24:01.770
so we have this ability to adjust our greetings.

407
00:24:02.069 --> 00:24:05.530
In the same cultures, we do it differently. If

408
00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.839
we compare cultures, we have even different signals, uh,

409
00:24:08.849 --> 00:24:12.650
different, uh, choices and who we greet. So lots

410
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.650
of, uh, I would say lots of different uh

411
00:24:14.849 --> 00:24:19.810
uh variations of greetings and the way we, we

412
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.089
say goodbye, uh, I would say it's, it works

413
00:24:22.089 --> 00:24:26.180
the same um in the same way. Uh, I

414
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.930
think both have a super important function of, uh,

415
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.410
also maintaining, as I mentioned before, for the chimpanzees,

416
00:24:33.739 --> 00:24:37.599
um, maybe, of course, not in the same extent,

417
00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.709
but they also inform people about social relationships, so

418
00:24:41.709 --> 00:24:44.939
people around if I had someone and uh give

419
00:24:44.939 --> 00:24:47.540
a handshake to another one, they will notice that

420
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.130
my relationship will be different, right? Um. So I

421
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.319
think there is like some similarities in terms of

422
00:24:54.449 --> 00:24:58.329
they are super important to keep social relationships and

423
00:24:58.329 --> 00:25:02.170
uh to inform uh if there are like also

424
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:06.199
changes in the way uh you, we, we are

425
00:25:06.199 --> 00:25:08.599
fission fusion societies as well, so you don't spend

426
00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:11.609
all the time together. Some, some things may have

427
00:25:11.609 --> 00:25:14.930
happened in your absence, so I think these moments

428
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.170
are also super important, as I mentioned before, for

429
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.050
the chimpanzees.

430
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:23.260
So it's, it's then the case that greetings and

431
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:27.739
leave takings, their presence is a human universal. I

432
00:25:27.739 --> 00:25:30.900
mean, they occur across all human societies or at

433
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.094
least the ones that we've studied and then. Uh,

434
00:25:35.334 --> 00:25:39.135
I mean, who we greet, when we greet, and

435
00:25:39.135 --> 00:25:43.734
all of those other contextual factors. They vary cross

436
00:25:43.734 --> 00:25:47.974
culturally and they are, I would imagine, very heavily

437
00:25:47.974 --> 00:25:49.525
influenced by culture,

438
00:25:50.055 --> 00:25:53.895
correct. Yeah, no, so basically, uh, uh, it's, it's

439
00:25:53.895 --> 00:25:59.709
that like we've seen. Some of these, uh, the

440
00:25:59.709 --> 00:26:02.550
things that you mentioned, so people would choose how

441
00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:06.109
you greet, uh, and so if you compare across

442
00:26:06.109 --> 00:26:08.420
cultures, one of the things that you see like

443
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.510
greeting and these takings are quite universal because they

444
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.719
occur, but the way they occur, the people who

445
00:26:13.719 --> 00:26:17.270
greet or the people who decide to communicate is

446
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:20.339
quite different. So we can infer that this is

447
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.989
a universal behavior. And it's why it seems super

448
00:26:23.989 --> 00:26:27.189
interesting to study the evolutionary origins of these behaviors,

449
00:26:27.239 --> 00:26:30.500
and it's when you study uh other close or

450
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.750
phylogenetic relatives of the other great apes, or even

451
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:37.869
in other animals, it's also pretty uh studied and

452
00:26:37.869 --> 00:26:41.989
these functions of keeping and maintaining social relationships plays

453
00:26:41.989 --> 00:26:46.189
an important role. Um, SO, yeah, I think the

454
00:26:46.189 --> 00:26:49.699
most interesting part of this is being able to

455
00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.780
go back and say, OK. The way we, so

456
00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.459
for example, there is like some signals like embrace

457
00:26:55.459 --> 00:26:58.020
and kids that we also see in chimpanzees or

458
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.579
both. So there is when you study these uh

459
00:27:01.579 --> 00:27:04.939
these gestures, for example, or some of the vocalizations,

460
00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.180
of course it's a bit more different, but for

461
00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.790
gestures in specific that I'm more focused on, uh,

462
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.060
it is quite nice to see that there is

463
00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.619
like some of these signals that we also see

464
00:27:15.619 --> 00:27:18.900
in humans. So what we can also some infer

465
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:23.689
when we compare. Humans and other great apes. If

466
00:27:23.689 --> 00:27:27.449
you see similar behaviors that you can infer that

467
00:27:27.449 --> 00:27:31.729
probably our last common ancestor had similar communicative um

468
00:27:31.729 --> 00:27:35.250
registers or behaviors. So it's how we, you can

469
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.510
go back and take some of the things in

470
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:42.400
terms of uh. Evolutionary origins. Of course this is

471
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.239
always you, you cannot be sure, but it's how

472
00:27:46.239 --> 00:27:49.670
we usually work and if you see in more

473
00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:54.560
distant related species, um you can consider convergence evolution,

474
00:27:54.599 --> 00:27:58.069
for example. Um, BUT yeah, I, I guess the,

475
00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.449
the most interesting thing, so the most interesting thing

476
00:28:00.449 --> 00:28:04.329
here is, uh, going back to study the evolution

477
00:28:04.329 --> 00:28:07.489
of these, the, these rituals, the greetings and leave

478
00:28:07.489 --> 00:28:09.849
takings and be able to infer probably our last

479
00:28:09.849 --> 00:28:13.719
common ancestor also did these behaviors. So for greetings,

480
00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.479
they are quite spread around the, the animal kingdom,

481
00:28:17.819 --> 00:28:21.329
uh, so maybe it's it's super interesting just to

482
00:28:21.329 --> 00:28:26.849
study more detailed, uh, uh. MORE details about the,

483
00:28:26.859 --> 00:28:29.209
the signals. So for example, the, as I mentioned,

484
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:33.000
the types of signals, were they present maybe, you

485
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.959
know, and instead of general questions. Mhm.

486
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.079
So I also read in your work that individuals

487
00:28:41.079 --> 00:28:46.069
both in non-human apes and in humans learn to

488
00:28:46.069 --> 00:28:50.709
adjust their communication during their development. I mean, why

489
00:28:50.709 --> 00:28:54.189
do they do that? Why, what is the social

490
00:28:54.189 --> 00:28:55.660
importance of that?

491
00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.979
Um, SO if, if you think uh about uh

492
00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:05.510
primates in general, we have like, um, uh, a

493
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.069
long period of uh in which we are dependent

494
00:29:08.069 --> 00:29:13.270
on our mothers and caregivers. So it's a safe

495
00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:16.310
place to learn, right? So there is no this

496
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:22.250
social pressure, um, or we are safe. Um, BECAUSE

497
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.770
our mothers would protect us. So I would say

498
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.369
humans in general, of course, but I, I was

499
00:29:27.369 --> 00:29:30.130
thinking more about the chimpanzees now, uh, but you

500
00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.130
have like a long period in which you are

501
00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:36.199
able to learn from your environment, from the social

502
00:29:36.199 --> 00:29:41.410
relationships, um, and to pick how the social rules,

503
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:43.569
the social rules, and the same works for the

504
00:29:43.569 --> 00:29:47.050
communication. So to be able to survive and navigate

505
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:49.569
this complex world, the social complex world that I

506
00:29:49.569 --> 00:29:52.550
mentioned before. You need to know how these things

507
00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:56.229
work. And when you are super young, because you

508
00:29:56.229 --> 00:29:59.709
are protected uh by your mother, you can just

509
00:29:59.709 --> 00:30:04.069
learn from the environment, right? Uh, AND the communication

510
00:30:04.069 --> 00:30:08.000
is the same thing. Of course, um, they will

511
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.510
learn by the surrounding environment and we can talk

512
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:15.709
about this a bit later, um, but also the

513
00:30:15.709 --> 00:30:20.439
way Mothers and other individuals address their in their

514
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:24.800
infants or immature individuals could be also be different.

515
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:29.199
Um, BUT all these adaptations, I would say that

516
00:30:29.199 --> 00:30:33.449
they are super important to survive. So if an

517
00:30:33.449 --> 00:30:36.969
individual is able to adjust their communication. Uh, DEPENDING

518
00:30:36.969 --> 00:30:39.170
on the situation, so for example, if a, if

519
00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:43.689
a chimp will uh exaggerate their signals to attract

520
00:30:43.689 --> 00:30:46.569
the attention of a female, uh, they will probably

521
00:30:46.569 --> 00:30:49.640
be more successful in this sexual context, for example,

522
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:52.560
or if there is like some aggression going on,

523
00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.594
maybe I. Able to adjust the communication and to

524
00:30:55.875 --> 00:30:59.915
have a more silent register but maybe I can

525
00:30:59.915 --> 00:31:03.094
survive a bit more. So this is very the

526
00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:05.765
ability to adjust the communication to different contexts, to

527
00:31:05.765 --> 00:31:10.375
different individuals. I would say that it's super important

528
00:31:10.805 --> 00:31:12.885
to survive in the group and to be accepted

529
00:31:12.885 --> 00:31:17.689
by the group and to navigate these. Hierarchies to

530
00:31:17.689 --> 00:31:21.239
have some allies that are super important. And during

531
00:31:21.449 --> 00:31:24.530
the development is the way that you can learn

532
00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:27.770
how things work. And then the way you learn,

533
00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:29.729
of course, and for example, in humans we have

534
00:31:29.729 --> 00:31:34.329
this active learning, um or active teaching in chimpanzees

535
00:31:34.329 --> 00:31:36.489
is a bit different, but here I would say

536
00:31:36.489 --> 00:31:39.530
it's more, uh, maybe, yeah, it's what we will

537
00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:43.770
talk now about this kind of child or mature.

538
00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:49.500
Um, COMMUNICATION, directed communication. So the way we, the

539
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.689
way infant learns or immature individuals learn these things

540
00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.500
might differ a bit between if you compare humans

541
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.780
and other apes. Mhm.

542
00:31:59.219 --> 00:32:03.560
So let's get then into child-directed communication. What is

543
00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.900
it and which pieces have you studied it in?

544
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.510
Um, SO I studied in, in chimpanzees, like again,

545
00:32:12.589 --> 00:32:14.650
so my, my PG was focused on the accommodate

546
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:17.910
that our ability to adjust our language, um, that

547
00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:21.109
our communication, and so I did these studies in

548
00:32:21.109 --> 00:32:23.750
greetings and takings, but also then I focused on

549
00:32:24.109 --> 00:32:28.300
uh child directed communication, and here I studied in

550
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:32.060
how this ability emerge in our ontogeny in humans,

551
00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:36.489
and also, uh, so in chimpanzees in general, if

552
00:32:37.069 --> 00:32:41.390
This register, this register is present or not uh

553
00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:45.339
in chimpanzees, and for that, so I focus, I

554
00:32:45.339 --> 00:32:49.199
collect data on uh toddlers, so in humans in

555
00:32:49.199 --> 00:32:53.520
different groups of toddlers and uh in chimpanzees I

556
00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.030
study two groups, two different communities.

557
00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.329
Um, AND what forms of child directed communication can

558
00:33:02.329 --> 00:33:04.609
we find then in chimpanzees?

559
00:33:06.319 --> 00:33:11.359
Um, SO I focused again on these studies were

560
00:33:11.359 --> 00:33:15.150
mainly focused on gestures, um, I guess I, I,

561
00:33:15.239 --> 00:33:18.520
I, I said it before, but, um, so why

562
00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:23.119
these interesting gestures in particular, because although we see

563
00:33:23.119 --> 00:33:27.349
lots of vocalizations and facial expressions, and of course

564
00:33:27.349 --> 00:33:29.439
we have all this into account, even if we

565
00:33:29.439 --> 00:33:31.800
study just as we collect some general information about

566
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.969
these other modalities. Um, BUT in terms of the

567
00:33:34.969 --> 00:33:41.250
evolutionary origins of language and communication, there's especially interested

568
00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:44.920
in studying gestures because they look more flexible. Then

569
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.949
vocalizations and facial expressions. I'm not saying that they

570
00:33:47.949 --> 00:33:49.989
are not flexible. They are the modalities they, they

571
00:33:49.989 --> 00:33:52.939
are, and studies that are coming and we need

572
00:33:52.939 --> 00:33:55.150
technology, we, we see that they actually are pretty

573
00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:58.790
flexible, but compared to the complexity we see in

574
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:03.140
human speech, um, we were all the researchers were

575
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:06.989
looking for some of these features and they failed

576
00:34:06.989 --> 00:34:10.300
like when analyzing vocalizations, for example, in facial expressions,

577
00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:14.550
they would say they were more um Tied to

578
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:18.360
emotional states. Um, SO we, we see more flexibility

579
00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.830
in gestures and it was in gestures that I

580
00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.639
focused my research for the child art of communication

581
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:28.467
and like in in toddlers. It's super important, these

582
00:34:28.467 --> 00:34:31.967
um developmental stage where before they they learn how

583
00:34:31.967 --> 00:34:33.928
to speak properly, they use a lot, they rely

584
00:34:33.928 --> 00:34:37.688
a lot on gestures. So I was focusing on

585
00:34:37.688 --> 00:34:41.438
gestures, uh, the gestures they use, and look at

586
00:34:41.928 --> 00:34:45.768
if they were adjusting when they were communicating with

587
00:34:45.768 --> 00:34:50.599
younger toddlers, for example. Um, AND for the chimpanzees,

588
00:34:50.978 --> 00:34:54.928
I was more interested also in gestures, um, focusing

589
00:34:54.928 --> 00:34:59.929
on gestures, but More general, more generally speaking, if

590
00:34:59.929 --> 00:35:03.689
they were adjusting also their gestures, but finer uh

591
00:35:03.689 --> 00:35:07.330
features of, of gestures because we already know that

592
00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:12.689
uh There are some infant directed gestures uh in

593
00:35:12.689 --> 00:35:18.370
other great tapes like in gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees, um,

594
00:35:18.659 --> 00:35:22.340
they exist, but and there's like some general features.

595
00:35:22.419 --> 00:35:25.699
So for example, in gorillas, the mothers and will

596
00:35:25.699 --> 00:35:30.419
use more repetitive uh sequences with tactile elements, for

597
00:35:30.419 --> 00:35:34.649
example, or in in chimpanzees we know that. This

598
00:35:34.649 --> 00:35:37.250
tactile modality is more present when they are young

599
00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:40.530
and they use visual gestures and silent gestures when

600
00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:44.199
they grow older. Um, SO we already know that

601
00:35:44.199 --> 00:35:48.800
it is some kind of infant directed uh communication,

602
00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.649
uh, but not in the same way, so never

603
00:35:52.649 --> 00:35:55.500
was uh in, in the literature we didn't find

604
00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:00.050
any evidence for these finer grained features of, uh,

605
00:36:00.419 --> 00:36:02.860
child directed communication that we studied in humans. So

606
00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.929
for example, What is uh child directed communication is

607
00:36:06.929 --> 00:36:10.969
like this register that we use when we talk

608
00:36:10.969 --> 00:36:15.199
with the babies and infants. Uh, SO we change

609
00:36:15.729 --> 00:36:19.489
our pitch, our like the frequency, the rhythm or

610
00:36:19.489 --> 00:36:23.020
like the temporal patterns, so we tend to, to

611
00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.989
communicate slower with more pauses and using different speech

612
00:36:26.989 --> 00:36:31.169
as I mentioned before, repeating more. And it's like

613
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.340
this kind of detail that it's not studied so

614
00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:38.580
often in, in other red tapes. Um, IT'S what,

615
00:36:38.699 --> 00:36:42.020
so in our study we focus more on these

616
00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.169
like temporal patterns, the repetitions as well. We looked

617
00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:48.100
the complexity of the vocabulary like as we tend

618
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:51.100
to use simple vocabulary when we address children we

619
00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:54.020
also look at these in both. So I use

620
00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.060
similar methodologies for the toddlers and for the chimpanzees,

621
00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:00.270
but not to compare. One thing, so in one

622
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:03.590
study I was focusing on the emergence of these

623
00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:08.389
uh uh register of mother is uh in, in

624
00:37:08.389 --> 00:37:10.510
humans to see if they were already present in

625
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:14.500
our gesture modality before being able to speak properly,

626
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.590
and in the other study was to see if

627
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:19.310
there were at all present these features, these finer

628
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:20.899
brain features in chimpanzees.

629
00:37:22.389 --> 00:37:25.679
Right. Uh, AND so in terms of the gestures

630
00:37:25.679 --> 00:37:29.469
that are directed at, uh, children in, in the

631
00:37:29.469 --> 00:37:33.310
case of chimpanzees, what characterizes them and how do

632
00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:37.310
they differ from the ones that are directed at

633
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:37.870
adults?

634
00:37:38.979 --> 00:37:45.719
Uh, SO in chimpanzees you mentioned, right? Um, So

635
00:37:46.909 --> 00:37:51.489
I would say that the So the first part

636
00:37:51.489 --> 00:37:55.760
of our study was actually compared like uh how

637
00:37:56.169 --> 00:37:59.530
females, so we focus on females, would communicate with

638
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:03.169
other adults compared to infants. So for example, to

639
00:38:03.169 --> 00:38:06.610
see if there was a different register. um, AND

640
00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:12.439
we found some differences, um, specifically, uh, uh, I

641
00:38:12.439 --> 00:38:15.310
think. It it was a bit surprising because it

642
00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.830
was not the same, the same thing that we've

643
00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:23.770
seen in humans. So, mostly they were um In

644
00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:26.409
humans, what we see, they simplify the vocabulary, they

645
00:38:26.409 --> 00:38:29.840
use a slower written and in our case in

646
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.159
chimpanzees, they were using shorter gestures. So for example,

647
00:38:34.899 --> 00:38:38.050
when communicating with younger individuals, and this is a

648
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:44.489
bit counterintuitive, um, because actually if you need, if

649
00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:46.489
they, they would have like the same function like

650
00:38:46.489 --> 00:38:52.040
the child direct communication to Uh, facilitate, uh, communicative,

651
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:57.840
uh, uh, functions. Um, YOU would expect they would

652
00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.830
use slower rhythm, like a slower pace, they would,

653
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.050
uh, the gesture duration would be longer as well,

654
00:39:06.159 --> 00:39:08.679
but it's not what we've seen, so they, at

655
00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:11.800
least the shorter gestures were one of the our

656
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.800
findings and it was quite surprising, yeah.

657
00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:20.479
So when it comes to mother offspring pairs, do

658
00:39:20.479 --> 00:39:26.199
mothers adjust their communication based on their offspring developmental

659
00:39:26.199 --> 00:39:28.709
stage and their sex?

660
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:34.100
Um, So yes and no for some of the

661
00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:38.780
things. So for the age, we've seen some results,

662
00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:42.260
yes, and I'll go to that, uh, I'll go

663
00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.620
back to that later, but, uh, so for example,

664
00:39:44.739 --> 00:39:46.540
one of the things that we've seen that there

665
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.020
was like no effect of the sex of the

666
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.300
offspring. And so why in the first place we

667
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.530
also were interesting to to know if they were,

668
00:39:54.899 --> 00:39:58.659
they would adjust. First of all, because it's already

669
00:39:58.659 --> 00:40:04.260
reported that the mothers will adjust their social uh

670
00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:09.120
sociality, so they will Adjust their behavior according to

671
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.330
the sex of the offspring. So we were thinking

672
00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.729
maybe they also adjust their communication. And also we

673
00:40:13.729 --> 00:40:19.679
know that young um immature males, for example, um,

674
00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:22.010
in chimpanzees, they will have a like uh in

675
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:25.090
terms of just the repertoire, and it's reported that

676
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:28.889
it's, it's larger than the females, but so we

677
00:40:28.889 --> 00:40:30.810
were thinking like maybe here there is like some

678
00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:34.149
communicative adaptation as well, but we didn't. Find anything

679
00:40:34.639 --> 00:40:38.169
regarding the sex. So we think that maybe they

680
00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:42.560
already adjust their behavior and that's big enough. So

681
00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.719
probably they create more opportunity. So if I, if

682
00:40:45.719 --> 00:40:51.159
they have a um infant male as a um

683
00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.739
That, so, first of all, sorry, uh, because sometimes

684
00:40:54.739 --> 00:40:58.340
I assume that uh you already know this, but

685
00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:01.429
males will stay in the same community. Most of

686
00:41:01.429 --> 00:41:03.780
the males will stay in the same community when

687
00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:08.020
they um when they grow up and stay in

688
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.620
the, the hierarchy of that group, but females tend

689
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:14.479
to migrate, so. This is also an important thing

690
00:41:14.479 --> 00:41:18.209
to consider why would expect differences uh in the

691
00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:22.570
sex of the individuals. Um, AND mothers with uh

692
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:26.409
male offspring, they would, uh, or what we reported

693
00:41:26.409 --> 00:41:29.489
is that they end up like hang out like

694
00:41:29.489 --> 00:41:34.419
more uh with the group of the, the chimpanzees,

695
00:41:34.489 --> 00:41:37.129
the community, they make more effort to be socially

696
00:41:37.129 --> 00:41:41.080
involved in other activities and compared to when they

697
00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.530
have female offspring. But in terms of gestures, we

698
00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:48.290
didn't see any difference. So we think that maybe

699
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:51.209
they have even the differences in the gesture, the

700
00:41:51.209 --> 00:41:53.840
size of the repertoire might have to do with

701
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.129
these more opportunities that males, young males have to

702
00:41:57.129 --> 00:42:00.219
socialize because mothers will make this extra effort to,

703
00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.800
to, to be around more individuals. Uh, BUT so

704
00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.010
for the sex, we didn't find anything and for

705
00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:09.459
the age as I mentioned before, um, so we

706
00:42:09.459 --> 00:42:13.219
had like this effect. So first, when we analyzed

707
00:42:13.219 --> 00:42:19.610
females to communication to adults and other individuals to

708
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:22.459
adults and to young individuals, we saw that trend,

709
00:42:22.739 --> 00:42:25.100
but when we analyzed the subset of mother offspring,

710
00:42:25.219 --> 00:42:30.510
we also found repetition. Uh, THAT is also a

711
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.629
common feature study in mothers, and we, but also

712
00:42:33.629 --> 00:42:37.899
again, the opposite trend. They were repeating more often

713
00:42:37.899 --> 00:42:41.229
to all their offspring. So usually we, when we

714
00:42:41.229 --> 00:42:44.510
are talking uh to young kids, we tend to

715
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:46.949
repeat a lot like because this helps right like

716
00:42:46.949 --> 00:42:51.699
the facilitates language acquisition. Uh, SO we are also

717
00:42:51.699 --> 00:42:54.310
expecting that maybe they would repeat a bit more

718
00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:59.699
when addressing uh. Immatures, like younger immatures, but we

719
00:42:59.699 --> 00:43:01.270
didn't find that fun.

720
00:43:02.449 --> 00:43:07.080
Right. And is mother is or this kind of

721
00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:14.149
uh child-directed uh communication that we humans have, um,

722
00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.129
is it a human universal?

723
00:43:17.459 --> 00:43:21.100
Um, SO yes, it's a bit similar to what

724
00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.989
you asked me about the greetings. Um, SO you

725
00:43:23.989 --> 00:43:26.870
see across the globe, so you would say this

726
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:32.699
is universal in. The weird like the Western, it's

727
00:43:32.699 --> 00:43:36.169
like the weird cultures, right, like the western, uh,

728
00:43:36.179 --> 00:43:38.459
compared to the Western cultures, so you see a

729
00:43:38.459 --> 00:43:41.899
lot of differences, but in general, when they address

730
00:43:41.899 --> 00:43:46.649
kids, they, they change the way they communicate. Um,

731
00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:50.649
SO what we can infer it's like it's present,

732
00:43:51.179 --> 00:43:54.479
uh, in most of the cultures, at least it's

733
00:43:54.479 --> 00:43:55.979
reported in most of the cultures, so we can

734
00:43:55.979 --> 00:43:59.020
infer that it's universal, but then the way the

735
00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:05.310
frequency. Uh, OF, for example, of, uh, the communication

736
00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:07.350
that we direct to a child, it also varies

737
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:10.510
a lot in the the cultures, and the, the

738
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:13.389
things in our way we communicate that we adjust

739
00:44:13.389 --> 00:44:15.949
it's also quite different. So in some cultures, for

740
00:44:15.949 --> 00:44:19.330
example, they don't address so often the kids directly.

741
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:23.270
So, of course, this also varies, uh, and they

742
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.000
still learn, so we know that mother is is

743
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.709
super important to language acquisition, but the fact that

744
00:44:28.709 --> 00:44:32.939
in these cultures. They don't address kids directly often,

745
00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:35.939
and still they acquire the language. So they, they

746
00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:39.469
can, and it's here where the surrounding environment is

747
00:44:39.469 --> 00:44:42.989
super important, so they probably are picking up the

748
00:44:42.989 --> 00:44:45.709
communication in the environment also to learn and to

749
00:44:45.709 --> 00:44:48.310
make these models uh of, of language.

750
00:44:49.239 --> 00:44:52.800
Right. So for the last part of our conversation

751
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.909
today, I have here just a few more general

752
00:44:56.909 --> 00:44:59.790
questions to ask you. So when it comes to

753
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:05.030
establishing a connection between chimpanzees and humans in terms

754
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:10.350
of communication, would there be a connection through gestures

755
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.939
and also between gestures and language?

756
00:45:15.169 --> 00:45:18.909
Um, YES, so in my work, what I, I

757
00:45:18.909 --> 00:45:23.010
was focusing on was precisely that like the connection

758
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:27.300
that we can establish between like the evolution of

759
00:45:27.669 --> 00:45:31.459
our language and specifically the evolution of uh our

760
00:45:31.459 --> 00:45:35.590
communicative systems, and because of course the way you

761
00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:39.550
define like language, human language is super complex, so

762
00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:43.250
it helps us if we try. To establish the

763
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:48.010
origin of language, it's useful to, to try to

764
00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:51.989
take apart the all these different components of language,

765
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.060
like to uh To, to try to put it

766
00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:59.060
in simple terms and simple components that we then

767
00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:03.179
can look at those things in other primates and

768
00:46:03.179 --> 00:46:08.129
also most important, so using uh similar definitions, um

769
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:12.780
the similar methodologies, of course, this implies always to

770
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:17.030
have um At some adaptations because it's not possible

771
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:19.820
and here is where the challenge is, because sometimes.

772
00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.879
The nature of communication is so different that we

773
00:46:22.879 --> 00:46:25.639
need to do an adaptation here and there, but

774
00:46:25.639 --> 00:46:29.280
keeping like uh comparable is super important because what

775
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:32.040
we've seen before is like some researchers, mostly that

776
00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.760
are focused on human research do like use a

777
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.959
methodology that is not possible to apply in other

778
00:46:38.959 --> 00:46:42.679
primates and vice versa, and then other people or

779
00:46:42.679 --> 00:46:46.229
even the same researchers will compare. So the other

780
00:46:46.229 --> 00:46:49.070
findings, but we are not comparing similar things, so

781
00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:52.790
it's hard to also be fair in this comparisons.

782
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:56.110
So what we, we try to do, it's like

783
00:46:56.110 --> 00:47:00.110
using Just so focusing here on justice because of,

784
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.800
yeah, the, the reasons that I mentioned before, the,

785
00:47:03.139 --> 00:47:05.739
the fact that they are used in a flexible

786
00:47:05.739 --> 00:47:10.010
and intentional way, so they are promising, promising modality

787
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:14.540
to, to study the evolution um of of our

788
00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.860
language and because we also retain, so we also

789
00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.659
use a lot of gestures in development and even

790
00:47:20.899 --> 00:47:24.250
as I'm speaking, I'm using gestures, right? So, uh,

791
00:47:24.459 --> 00:47:27.939
we, we are super interested in in Uh, in

792
00:47:27.939 --> 00:47:30.419
gestures, but we try to address this in a

793
00:47:30.419 --> 00:47:32.780
way that can be useful for this debate of

794
00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.010
the evolution of language.

795
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.750
Right, uh, but I mean, cognitively speaking, there's definitely

796
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:45.189
a link between gestures and language,

797
00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:51.699
right? Yes. Um, SO, uh. Gestures, uh, and I

798
00:47:51.699 --> 00:47:55.159
was mentioning it like a bit earlier that in,

799
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:58.820
in other primates, we tend to, to just study

800
00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:02.889
a a small subset of gestures. We know, um,

801
00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:06.090
and this is just uh Because there is so

802
00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:10.489
much uncertainty about, so if we study gestures in

803
00:48:10.489 --> 00:48:12.570
adults, some of the things that we study in

804
00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:15.330
these gestures, we can just ask, and it's much

805
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:18.810
easier to access to which part of the brains

806
00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:22.780
are activated and Lots of different details that when

807
00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.820
we, for example, we are studying other species or

808
00:48:26.229 --> 00:48:30.270
even human infants, you cannot just ask or uh

809
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:33.250
be sure about certain things, about their intentions, about

810
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:36.979
even if they were uh about if they were

811
00:48:36.979 --> 00:48:41.250
gesturing at all or not, so. Uh, THE approach

812
00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:45.550
that like developmental psychologists use to study uh infants,

813
00:48:45.649 --> 00:48:49.610
it's, uh, basically, or we have lots of as

814
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.649
permatologists have lots of influences of, uh, the, some

815
00:48:53.649 --> 00:48:55.729
of the tools they use. So for example, to

816
00:48:55.729 --> 00:49:01.489
study intentionality, we use uh similar uh criteria, um,

817
00:49:01.649 --> 00:49:07.159
so I, I would say. Um, THAT'S. We, we

818
00:49:07.159 --> 00:49:09.870
need to, to work like, of course, in the

819
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:15.320
same um using similar methodologies and as I mentioned

820
00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.389
before, using similar tools, but then because it's also

821
00:49:18.389 --> 00:49:20.439
not possible to use exactly the same tools, we

822
00:49:20.439 --> 00:49:22.280
need to adapt. So it was this work that

823
00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:27.030
we were Um, we're doing before, but uh, so

824
00:49:27.399 --> 00:49:29.399
what I would say just disease was because we

825
00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:32.510
are studying a small subset, but in humans, um,

826
00:49:32.679 --> 00:49:35.719
we also gesture sometimes when we are alone, for

827
00:49:35.719 --> 00:49:39.270
example, as a Uh, for example, it, it helps

828
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:43.540
us thinking about something. Uh, IF you forget about,

829
00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:47.750
uh, about something, uh, that you need to remember

830
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:50.310
sometimes or where you put your keys or the

831
00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:52.989
way that you did, sometimes we gesture and it's

832
00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:57.580
not for a communicative purpose. So Uh, of course,

833
00:49:57.709 --> 00:50:01.429
there is like this cognitive, uh, the functions of

834
00:50:01.429 --> 00:50:04.110
these gestures, I would say they are a bit

835
00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:08.530
different and it's hard to, to study in other

836
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:11.550
animals. So it's why when we are talking here

837
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:16.149
about gestures and these cognitive processes in gestures, I

838
00:50:16.149 --> 00:50:18.790
would say that if we are just talking about

839
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:21.429
the comparisons of these uh or the evolution of

840
00:50:21.429 --> 00:50:25.040
gestures, we are focusing still on these. This subset

841
00:50:25.229 --> 00:50:28.189
that is more comparable, but it's super fascinating to

842
00:50:28.189 --> 00:50:30.909
think that of course there are gestures also in

843
00:50:30.909 --> 00:50:35.270
humans have different functions, may have different functions um

844
00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:38.149
that are not studied there because it's so super

845
00:50:38.149 --> 00:50:41.229
hard to address these other functions in other animals.

846
00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:42.679
Mhm.

847
00:50:43.179 --> 00:50:47.260
So one last question then I think. So, when

848
00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:52.340
it comes to the cognitive and evolutionary foundations of

849
00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:58.260
language and the link between gestures and language, at

850
00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:01.500
this point in time, what do we know about

851
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:01.889
it?

852
00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:07.669
So about the, can you just repeat the, uh,

853
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.560
yes, I, I mean, there, there's a, uh, as

854
00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.159
we talked about, there's a link between gestures and

855
00:51:13.159 --> 00:51:18.560
language. So, uh, in terms of the evolutionary and

856
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:23.719
cognitive foundations of language and through the link with

857
00:51:23.719 --> 00:51:27.870
gestures, with gestures, what do we know about it?

858
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:36.919
Um, SO we know, um, that most of the

859
00:51:36.919 --> 00:51:39.280
bits here what we mentioned a bit before, so

860
00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.399
when we studied, uh, in other primates, uh, and

861
00:51:43.399 --> 00:51:46.550
using similar methodologies, and if you, if you find

862
00:51:46.919 --> 00:51:52.209
uh similar goals, similar Uh, the way they, they

863
00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:56.729
use in the flexible way, um, so the intentionality

864
00:51:56.729 --> 00:52:00.040
that I mentioned before, so all these properties are,

865
00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:04.000
uh, things that are studied in in human language,

866
00:52:04.169 --> 00:52:07.550
so we can assume that they were present in,

867
00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:09.600
if they are present in these species, they would

868
00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.790
be present in these last common ancestors. So if

869
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:16.649
we go back in the primate cage a bit

870
00:52:16.649 --> 00:52:18.969
earlier and if we find these same features, we

871
00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:24.044
can just For that uh these cognitive abilities and

872
00:52:24.044 --> 00:52:27.304
these features of the communication were already present in

873
00:52:27.685 --> 00:52:32.965
uh these uh common ancestors in uh in humans

874
00:52:32.965 --> 00:52:35.844
in language because it's so complex, some of the

875
00:52:35.844 --> 00:52:38.965
features that they are reported like to be maybe

876
00:52:38.965 --> 00:52:44.564
exclusively uh found in humans. Um, SO, but it's

877
00:52:44.564 --> 00:52:49.469
helpful then to to to understand. How we would

878
00:52:49.469 --> 00:52:53.129
define, uh, is this defined in a way that

879
00:52:53.129 --> 00:52:55.889
it's impossible to look in the first place to

880
00:52:55.889 --> 00:53:00.010
other animals, in other animals. Um, SO first of

881
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:03.830
all, yeah, I think we need to, to To

882
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:07.219
make things like to to compose things and uh

883
00:53:07.629 --> 00:53:11.189
uh to see, OK, we have this complex, complex

884
00:53:11.189 --> 00:53:15.310
uh uh ability to communicate like using language that

885
00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:19.310
involves this, and it's what researchers actually do, the

886
00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:22.550
ones that are focusing on the evolution of communication,

887
00:53:22.649 --> 00:53:24.699
and then they try to look into to address

888
00:53:24.699 --> 00:53:27.520
these different things like nationality that I mentioned before,

889
00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:31.320
how that you were using um The gestures in

890
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.719
this flexible ways, so using the same gesture in

891
00:53:33.719 --> 00:53:40.139
different contexts and um These markers of intentionality, for

892
00:53:40.139 --> 00:53:43.699
example, that I mentioned before, so already will uh

893
00:53:43.699 --> 00:53:46.429
inform us that we had the intention to communicate

894
00:53:46.429 --> 00:53:48.979
this to there. So these all these markers, I

895
00:53:48.979 --> 00:53:53.149
would say um that can tell us when they

896
00:53:53.149 --> 00:53:57.020
emerge in the primate image. And of course, as

897
00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.260
I mentioned before, they could be also and they

898
00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:04.250
are present in other animals and This can also,

899
00:54:04.459 --> 00:54:09.540
um, bring us the conversion evolution scenario or even

900
00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.300
if there are things that we are not finding

901
00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:14.939
or the combination of these modality, these features are

902
00:54:14.939 --> 00:54:18.379
not finding uh you know across the animal kingdom

903
00:54:18.379 --> 00:54:21.459
besides humans, you, you can say that maybe they

904
00:54:21.459 --> 00:54:24.879
emerge later, you know, only in humans. So I

905
00:54:24.879 --> 00:54:29.360
think it's um. How we you usually address these

906
00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.449
things in, in primate research or in animal communication

907
00:54:33.449 --> 00:54:33.870
research.

908
00:54:34.919 --> 00:54:38.199
Mhm. Great. So, I mean, would you like to

909
00:54:38.199 --> 00:54:41.399
tell us what you're going to be working on

910
00:54:41.399 --> 00:54:44.280
in the near future, a little bit more about

911
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.070
your current research?

912
00:54:46.969 --> 00:54:50.449
Uh, SO now I'm, uh, this, uh, mother is

913
00:54:50.449 --> 00:54:54.500
research, the child directed communication research, um, I'm uh

914
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:57.250
uh focusing a bit on, on that part right

915
00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:01.520
now, trying to include other communities. So in our

916
00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:05.179
lab, we had like this huge archive of uh

917
00:55:05.179 --> 00:55:11.314
gestures in Different apes. So we are trying to

918
00:55:11.685 --> 00:55:15.165
address the questions that I mentioned here before and

919
00:55:15.165 --> 00:55:19.965
study these, uh, different, uh, these finer grained uh

920
00:55:19.965 --> 00:55:24.955
features of mother is like vocabulary complexity, temporal patterns,

921
00:55:25.314 --> 00:55:30.550
um. Also, the repetition the prominence of our communication

922
00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:33.010
if you are exaggerating the way you communicating or

923
00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:35.959
not. So I have these features that are already

924
00:55:35.959 --> 00:55:38.229
addressed in these two communities of chimpanzees and we

925
00:55:38.229 --> 00:55:41.909
are trying um to, to see if they are

926
00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:46.709
also present in other uh in other apes, so

927
00:55:46.709 --> 00:55:49.310
in other chimpanzees communities but also in bonobos and

928
00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:52.169
gorillas, um to be able to also to make

929
00:55:52.169 --> 00:55:55.110
this because we have like these promising results that

930
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:58.689
actually Uh, they are able to adjust their communication

931
00:55:58.689 --> 00:56:00.689
to young individuals, but they are not doing it

932
00:56:00.689 --> 00:56:03.330
the same way that we humans do. So they

933
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:07.709
have probably different function. Uh, PROBABLY relates with the

934
00:56:07.709 --> 00:56:11.739
related with this, uh, active, uh, teaching that, uh,

935
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:14.989
that is not occurring in chimpanzees, so probably they

936
00:56:14.989 --> 00:56:18.989
will prefer to invest in the other social relationships

937
00:56:18.989 --> 00:56:22.860
around, um, and be more efficient with their own

938
00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:25.870
infants and immatures because they will have time to

939
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:29.659
learn. So this trend that we've seen. Um, WE

940
00:56:29.659 --> 00:56:31.500
don't, we are not sure if this disease is

941
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.290
just because of these two communities that we studied,

942
00:56:34.459 --> 00:56:37.179
if it is like a general trend across the

943
00:56:37.179 --> 00:56:41.969
chimpanzees, communities, or even if we can take back

944
00:56:41.969 --> 00:56:45.580
this ability of adjusting our communication to younger individuals,

945
00:56:45.979 --> 00:56:49.139
um, at an early stage in evolution. So if

946
00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:51.780
they were present also in guerrillas or in bonobos,

947
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:54.699
we can take back the emergence of disability.

948
00:56:56.239 --> 00:56:59.260
Great, so would you like to tell the audience

949
00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.959
where they can find your work on the internet?

950
00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:06.469
Well, actually, I don't have my, uh, I don't

951
00:57:06.469 --> 00:57:08.620
have any specific channels, so I think I would

952
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:14.760
say Google Scholars and yeah, maybe the, the lab

953
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.780
web page, but yeah, I would say Google Scholar

954
00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.770
is probably the place.

955
00:57:20.459 --> 00:57:24.300
OK. So, Daniel, thank you so much for taking

956
00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.330
