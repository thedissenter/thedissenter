Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:06.000
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.750
here. I have a very special guest, Doctor Carl

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.399
Freston. He is Professor of Imaging Neuroscience and welcome

5
00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.850
principal research fellow of Imaging Neuroscience at University College

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.309
London. He is a theoretical neuroscientist and his main

7
00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:26.110
contribution to theoretical neurobiology has been a free energy

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.170
principle for action and perception. And today we're going

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.700
to focus a lot on the free energy principle.

10
00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:35.514
And let's say what point we can get to

11
00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:41.525
because there are many topics that Doctor Freston researchers

12
00:00:41.534 --> 00:00:43.825
that, that I would be interested in talking with

13
00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:47.564
him about about today. But let's see where we

14
00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:49.904
can get. So, Doctor Frisson, welcome to the show.

15
00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:51.095
It's a pleasure to have everyone.

16
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.310
Thank you very much for inviting me. It's a

17
00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.409
great pleasure to be here.

18
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.810
OK. So the free energy principle, first of all,

19
00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:04.129
could you tell us in the simplest terms possible?

20
00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:07.610
What is, what the free energy principle is about?

21
00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:09.669
And could you tell us perhaps also a little

22
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.410
bit about uh the history behind its development?

23
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.209
Yes, the free energy principle is in effect the

24
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.500
physics backstory to um a move in cognitive neuroscience

25
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.650
towards understanding brain function in terms of predictive predictive

26
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.949
processing and specifically the way in which we actively

27
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.150
get information to process and to predict. Um AND

28
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.889
that's sometimes in my world referred to as active

29
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.300
inference. So the free energy principle is the physicists

30
00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:57.260
or the mathematicians foundation from which you can build

31
00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:59.800
a story about how we make sense of our

32
00:01:59.809 --> 00:02:03.639
world. And I repeat how we actively engage with

33
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.559
the world to get the right kinds of sensations

34
00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.000
to make sense of our world.

35
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:15.350
So when applied to, for example, perception and cognition,

36
00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.660
you call it active inference is that it

37
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.990
Yeah, absolutely. So active inference which um I read

38
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.660
as synonymous with predictive processing provided there's an active

39
00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:34.669
and embodied aspect to uh predictive processing. Um IS

40
00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:38.770
an application of the free energy principle. Um SOMETIMES

41
00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:43.690
in explaining the free energy principle, um one can

42
00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:46.839
take a low road or a high road and

43
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.080
by the low road and the high road, I

44
00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:55.190
mean a an intuitive um theological account of what,

45
00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:58.050
what it means to engage in active inference and

46
00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:02.210
predictive processing um where the the high road will

47
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.389
be the physicists way of telling exactly the same

48
00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:10.630
story. So um you, you asked for a simple

49
00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.350
explanation, so perhaps I'll go for the uh the

50
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.710
low road explanation um which I think he could

51
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.070
probably um start with the ideas of Plato and

52
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.669
and his students in terms of um the Allegorical

53
00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:32.179
Cave. Um BUT perhaps best developed by um Herman

54
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.740
Helmholtz, predicated on his understanding of not only physics,

55
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.399
but of course, um perception in the brain as

56
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.419
an anatomist and physiologist, possibly predicated on the ideas

57
00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:48.419
of Kant that were prevalent at that time. So

58
00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:52.529
this um if we start with um Helmholtz and

59
00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:57.429
his notion of unconscious inference, the idea here is

60
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.179
that we make sense of the world by internally

61
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.279
generating a hypothesis, an explanation in our head that

62
00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:10.190
could best account for the sensory impressions on our

63
00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.360
ears, on, on our eyes and all our sensory

64
00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:19.700
epithelia. So as Andy Clark puts it where turning

65
00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.920
the usual conception of perception on its head. So

66
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.420
in the 20th century, people thought that perception was

67
00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:32.540
basically an outside in process. So sensory information impressed

68
00:04:32.549 --> 00:04:36.679
itself upon the sensory organs that was registered by

69
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.790
the brain. And somehow this sensory information provided was

70
00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:47.660
successively refined and then provided the basis for perception.

71
00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:53.220
The predictive processing or active inference story is exactly

72
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.100
the other way around. The perception rests upon an

73
00:04:57.109 --> 00:05:01.510
inside out process that you are actively and constructively

74
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:08.209
generating hypotheses. Explanations. Sometimes you can think of these

75
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.670
as hallucinations or fantasies that are fit for purpose

76
00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:18.829
in terms of explaining what I am actually encountering

77
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.459
and perhaps the best way of understanding that would

78
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.359
be through the lens of predictive coding. So, predictive

79
00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:29.720
coding is a scheme in fact, originally invented to

80
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.859
compress sound files in the 19 fifties. But more

81
00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:37.010
recently, over the past few decades, it has become

82
00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:41.420
a very popular scheme for understanding how the brain

83
00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:46.709
works in terms of message passing and technically belief,

84
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.980
updating. And it's very simple. All that happens is

85
00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:54.709
that if I had an idea or a hypothesis

86
00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:58.609
about the cause of this pattern of visual input,

87
00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:02.130
say it was you and your face that I

88
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.130
would be able to predict what I would see

89
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.480
if I was right. And I can compare my

90
00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:11.510
prediction to what I'm actually sensing. So if I

91
00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:15.239
am correct, then there should be no difference between

92
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.850
my prediction and my sensations. And that difference is

93
00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:23.829
scored by a prediction error. So if I can

94
00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:28.399
eliminate or resolve prediction errors, I've got the right

95
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.959
explanation for states of affairs in the world out

96
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.880
there. And when I say out there, what I,

97
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.910
what I'm implying is that the brain can't, doesn't

98
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.640
have direct access to the world. It can only

99
00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:46.010
sample it all it has access to are very

100
00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:50.950
sparse sensory signals afforded by our eyes, our ears,

101
00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:53.760
our skin and our body, all our all our

102
00:06:53.769 --> 00:07:00.029
sense organs. So this picture puts prediction error at

103
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.260
the center of driving changes in our beliefs. So

104
00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:08.480
if we have a large prediction error, that basically

105
00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:14.739
means our perception, our belief, I should qualify this.

106
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.329
When I say belief, I mean a mathematical belief,

107
00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:21.709
a representation. If you like an encoding of the

108
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.839
cause of a sensation by some neuronal uh activity.

109
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.209
So if I have a belief that is not

110
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.079
able to predict what I'm currently seeing, I can

111
00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:39.429
now use that prediction error to change my mind

112
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.769
to. So using the prediction error, the prediction error

113
00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:48.380
will drive belief updating until it eliminates itself. And

114
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.250
this can be um described in many ways but

115
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.209
has a very nice description in relation to the

116
00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.029
wiring in the brain. And in particular, the sort

117
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.480
of hierarchical structure of our brains where there is

118
00:08:03.489 --> 00:08:11.820
recurrent message passing or um or influences between successive

119
00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:15.399
levels of a hierarchical brain, very much like say

120
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.739
an onion. If you imagine the brain being an

121
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.459
onion and the surface is in receipt of all

122
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.799
the sensory impressions. But there are layers upon layers

123
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:26.720
and layers, literally giving you a very deep structure

124
00:08:26.769 --> 00:08:29.500
and deep is used exactly in the sense of

125
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.219
deep learning. For example, in machine learning, it's the

126
00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:35.698
hierarchical depth that is implied by this steepness. And

127
00:08:35.707 --> 00:08:39.758
in the brain, there are connections between one level

128
00:08:39.768 --> 00:08:43.658
and a deeper level, which suggests that we can

129
00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:48.328
understand these reciprocal or recurrent connections in terms of

130
00:08:48.338 --> 00:08:51.528
prediction errors being passed from a low level to

131
00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:54.518
a deeper level or a higher level, changing the

132
00:08:54.528 --> 00:09:00.340
beliefs. So that the recurrent or the inside out

133
00:09:00.349 --> 00:09:05.580
connections now convey the predictions that are the result

134
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.140
of my belief updating and the predictions come back

135
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.780
down again. They are compared with the input from

136
00:09:10.789 --> 00:09:13.190
the lower levels get the prediction error and then

137
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.840
that was sent forward. So you have this view

138
00:09:15.849 --> 00:09:18.559
of recurrent message passing in the brain where at

139
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.309
each level you are trying to minimize the prediction

140
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.469
error. And if you can do that in a

141
00:09:24.479 --> 00:09:29.820
hierarchical context, then you've got an apt description of

142
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.349
the state of the world at multiple levels of

143
00:09:32.359 --> 00:09:37.869
abstraction, all driven by these ascending messages ascending deep

144
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.140
into the hierarchy that can be construed as prediction

145
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.770
errors. So that's if you like the sort of

146
00:09:46.729 --> 00:09:50.650
I I mentioned sort of a teen explanation. So

147
00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:53.950
the one concern, the objective of the brain is

148
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.650
to make sense of the world by finding an

149
00:09:57.659 --> 00:10:01.500
appropriate explanation for everything that it is currently sensing.

150
00:10:01.859 --> 00:10:06.039
Um And if you take that view and generalize

151
00:10:06.049 --> 00:10:10.590
it to um the consequences of action, you can

152
00:10:10.599 --> 00:10:14.719
now tell a story whereby some of the things

153
00:10:14.729 --> 00:10:17.440
that you're predicting some of the sensations you're predicting

154
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.479
are basically reporting the state of your, your body.

155
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.229
And this can be in two flavors. It can

156
00:10:24.239 --> 00:10:28.190
either be um in terms of the state of

157
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.059
your muscles, you know, physically where your limbs are

158
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.599
and how the degree to which various muscles are

159
00:10:34.609 --> 00:10:39.140
stretched, or it could be um more autonomic, you

160
00:10:39.169 --> 00:10:41.099
know. So we can only really affect the world

161
00:10:41.109 --> 00:10:42.840
in one of two ways. We can only act

162
00:10:42.849 --> 00:10:44.070
upon the world in one or two ways. We

163
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.770
can either move a muscle, um striated muscle would

164
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.059
be those muscles that we can move, volitionally. Um

165
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.359
OR smooth muscle means that we can secrete things

166
00:10:55.369 --> 00:10:58.229
or the kind of muscles we find in the

167
00:10:58.239 --> 00:11:02.169
heart or the gut. But they're both in essence,

168
00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:05.299
providing the brain with signals about the state of

169
00:11:05.309 --> 00:11:08.309
the motor system, sometimes known as the motor plant.

170
00:11:08.719 --> 00:11:11.450
So notice if I've now got a good prediction

171
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.380
of what's happening in the world that includes a

172
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.289
prediction of what I should feel my muscles and

173
00:11:19.299 --> 00:11:22.760
my autonomic nervous system doing. I can then use

174
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.799
that prediction to basically realize or make that prediction

175
00:11:27.809 --> 00:11:32.280
come true. And that's um effectively equipping a predictive

176
00:11:32.289 --> 00:11:38.059
coding scheme with reflexes. So this this perspective on

177
00:11:38.099 --> 00:11:45.640
active sensing, active prediction, um active inference um can

178
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.590
be told in many different ways. For example, um

179
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.580
in robotics, it would be model predictive control. If

180
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.960
you were a motor physiologist, you might describe it

181
00:11:55.969 --> 00:11:59.250
in terms of the equilibrium point hypothesis that some

182
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.080
people like perceptual control theory. The idea is that

183
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.770
you specify you predict the state of your body

184
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.840
and then you reflexively fulfill those predictions. And that

185
00:12:11.849 --> 00:12:16.190
now takes you beyond this perception, but now subsumes

186
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:23.169
action under this generic imperative to minimize prediction error.

187
00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:28.340
And that is one way of understanding um perception

188
00:12:28.349 --> 00:12:31.900
and action within the same frame. And then you

189
00:12:31.909 --> 00:12:33.940
can sort of add cognition on that and that

190
00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.570
all this perception has to be contextualized. You have

191
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.059
to attend to various things, you have to have

192
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:43.390
the history um of things that have just happened

193
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.080
and also crucially roll out into the future. It's

194
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:50.900
certainly if you want to make predictions about your

195
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.280
um your behavior that unfolds in terms of policies

196
00:12:55.289 --> 00:12:59.559
and plans and narratives of your, what's going to

197
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.820
happen to me, what should I do? Um Given

198
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.640
I have some predictions about the consequences of acting

199
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.239
in this way, uh act or acting in that

200
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.000
way. And the link to the free energy principle

201
00:13:13.229 --> 00:13:17.280
is that roughly speaking, the total amount of prediction

202
00:13:17.289 --> 00:13:21.590
error can be regarded as free energy from the

203
00:13:21.599 --> 00:13:25.619
point of view of a theorist um um an

204
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.559
information theorist or a physicist. So the free energy

205
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:35.590
of the free energy principle is effectively scoring the

206
00:13:35.599 --> 00:13:40.119
prediction er the overall prediction error or the implausibility

207
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.039
that if I was right, if my model of

208
00:13:43.049 --> 00:13:45.969
the world as it is at the moment was

209
00:13:45.979 --> 00:13:51.700
correct, then I'm going to want to um that

210
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.919
if it was correct, then the probability of getting

211
00:13:53.929 --> 00:13:56.770
these sensory data will be very high and the

212
00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.640
free energy scores a negative log probability of, of

213
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:05.070
um of, of these data given a particular model

214
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.140
of those data um sometimes known as surprise. So

215
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.820
you can see immediately that sort of prediction error

216
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:18.669
scores also or reflects the surprise. Technically, uh surprisal.

217
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:22.400
Again, if you're doing information theory, the mathematical description

218
00:14:22.409 --> 00:14:26.359
of this is called self information. And that's important

219
00:14:26.369 --> 00:14:30.669
because from the point of view of the physicist

220
00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:34.510
to thinking about self organizing systems, like you and

221
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:39.150
me, but also like um macro molecules and viruses

222
00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:47.049
possibly even to biospheres. Then the minimization of prediction

223
00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:50.989
error means the minimization of surprise, which means the

224
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.090
minimization of self information. And the key thing here

225
00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.109
is that the average of the self information is

226
00:14:58.119 --> 00:15:02.500
also known as entropy, which means that self-organization of

227
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.679
this inactive sort where the system is actually acting

228
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:11.289
upon the world to realize its predictions, or basically

229
00:15:11.299 --> 00:15:17.830
means you're resisting um the natural tendency of systems

230
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.200
to increase in their entropy, to decay, to dissipate,

231
00:15:22.229 --> 00:15:27.719
to die, um to become more disordered. So things

232
00:15:27.729 --> 00:15:31.390
that self organize according to the free energy principle

233
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.640
resist this entropic erosion. If you are a physiologist,

234
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.260
it's just a statement of homeostasis. It just means

235
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.119
that I've got certain predictions that I should be

236
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:44.640
say at a particular temperature. And if I sense

237
00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:49.640
that my temperature is deviating from these predictions, then

238
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:54.789
that is surprising in a non propositional sense. Um

239
00:15:54.799 --> 00:15:58.679
It entails a prediction error because the, you know,

240
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.799
my prediction and my sensation are now not in

241
00:16:02.809 --> 00:16:06.570
accord. And if I now act in a way

242
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.570
to eliminate that prediction error, I will act in

243
00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.979
a way that brings my temperature back towards my

244
00:16:11.989 --> 00:16:17.489
preferred, my preferred homeostatic set point. So there are

245
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.900
lots of ways of telling this story depending upon

246
00:16:19.909 --> 00:16:23.099
whether you're a physiologist or whether you're an economist

247
00:16:23.109 --> 00:16:28.080
or, you know, a mythologist. But they all basically

248
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:31.760
speak to the importance of having a model of

249
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:37.659
the world that prescribes certain behaviors so that you

250
00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:42.539
can sample the world so that everything is unsurprising

251
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.570
from your point of view, given the kind of

252
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.250
thing that you are. Uh I'll just conclude with

253
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.539
a couple of um a couple of key points.

254
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:54.650
I'm talking about a model uh very um deliberately

255
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.690
because at the heart of this is the notion

256
00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.260
of a generative model that can generate the predictions.

257
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:09.800
Um So this um this perspective um places center

258
00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:14.910
stage, the notion of an agent or anything that

259
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:20.290
has some kind of sentient behavior. Um It means

260
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.130
that you can always describe the behavior of this

261
00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:27.108
kind of thing in terms of the agent or

262
00:17:27.118 --> 00:17:29.790
the system, having a generative model that can generate

263
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.790
predictions which it actively pursues and and tries to

264
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.329
uh and tries to fulfill. So, you know, the

265
00:17:37.339 --> 00:17:40.780
notion of a generative model brings us exactly back

266
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:45.359
to the low road discussion um in the sense

267
00:17:45.369 --> 00:17:51.349
that I have models hypotheses, explanations in my mind

268
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:56.109
that I'm actively revising through this process of basing

269
00:17:56.119 --> 00:18:00.920
belief, updating another way of describing this. Um um

270
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.479
IN order to realize my predictions, given my model

271
00:18:05.489 --> 00:18:08.290
of the world that effectively I am, you know,

272
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:12.609
everything that defines my characteristics, sensations and exchange with

273
00:18:12.619 --> 00:18:16.750
the world can be described as a generative model.

274
00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:23.209
The final point just to explain why people might,

275
00:18:23.219 --> 00:18:25.260
terms of people might come across if they read

276
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:29.510
this literature, particularly the philos philosophical literature. It so

277
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.920
happens that that's surprise that self information um which

278
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:39.609
mathematically is a negative logarithm of the probability of

279
00:18:39.729 --> 00:18:43.479
my sensory data given my model or given me

280
00:18:43.829 --> 00:18:49.770
um is also known as the negative log evidence.

281
00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:54.459
And the evidence is the evidence for your model

282
00:18:54.469 --> 00:18:58.670
of the world, which means you can describe active

283
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.500
inference and this active sampling of the data to

284
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.270
minimize free energy or prediction error as exactly the

285
00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.819
same as gathering evidence for your model of the

286
00:19:08.829 --> 00:19:13.880
world sometimes refer to as self evidencing. So that's

287
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.469
something that Jacob Hai has promoted, which I think

288
00:19:17.479 --> 00:19:21.239
is a very neat summary of this kind of

289
00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:25.189
explanation. We're just in the game of gathering evidence

290
00:19:25.209 --> 00:19:28.290
for our model of the lived or possibly sensed

291
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:28.680
world.

292
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.180
Mhm No, it is a great summary. And before

293
00:19:32.189 --> 00:19:36.250
we delve deeper into the cognitive science and the

294
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.119
neuroscience of it, because there are also a few

295
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.859
concepts, there are terms that you use that I

296
00:19:41.869 --> 00:19:45.079
would like you to uh explain a little bit

297
00:19:45.089 --> 00:19:50.614
better. Like for example, generative model, autonomous states, hierarchical

298
00:19:50.625 --> 00:19:53.375
organization. Before we get into all of that, let's

299
00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:57.244
go step by step here. So one concept that

300
00:19:57.255 --> 00:20:00.094
I would like you to explain to people who

301
00:20:00.104 --> 00:20:03.984
are not familiar with the free energy principle is

302
00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:06.604
what are Markov blankets?

303
00:20:08.119 --> 00:20:10.170
That was the one thing that I didn't include

304
00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:16.750
in my long, long, well spotted, right? So the

305
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:23.339
physics um um story, the free energy principle has

306
00:20:23.349 --> 00:20:28.000
to derive the self evidencing. I've just described the

307
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.449
predictive pressing I have just described from first principles.

308
00:20:32.099 --> 00:20:36.369
So how does, how does one do that? Um

309
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.739
It's relatively straightforward, although it does involve um um

310
00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.739
some esoteric maths if you're not, if you're not

311
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.660
uh a physicist. Uh BUT the arguments are quite

312
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:52.619
straightforward. THE, you f you basically start by asking

313
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.209
the question, if you want to talk about self-organization,

314
00:20:56.589 --> 00:21:00.959
what is a self? And that's quite a deep

315
00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:04.560
question. So the first thing you realize is that

316
00:21:04.569 --> 00:21:08.109
you have to be able to mathematically in a,

317
00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:12.839
in a principled way, individuate the states of the

318
00:21:12.849 --> 00:21:16.199
self from everything else that is not the self.

319
00:21:17.479 --> 00:21:21.660
How would you do that? Well, as a physicist,

320
00:21:21.869 --> 00:21:25.680
you can't assume that the self is closed. So

321
00:21:25.689 --> 00:21:28.219
you can't assume the kind of physics that you

322
00:21:28.229 --> 00:21:31.300
would have been taught at school where there is

323
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:35.020
an equilibrium in a closed system. So for example,

324
00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:39.060
the second law of thermodynamics only applies to closed

325
00:21:39.069 --> 00:21:45.099
systems where there is no openness of the self,

326
00:21:45.109 --> 00:21:50.160
to the environment, to the eco niche um to

327
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.010
other selves. So we are now talking about the

328
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:58.119
physics of open systems. And in so doing, we

329
00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:02.400
have to now distinguish the states of a self

330
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:08.000
or anything, anything basically from everything else or nothing.

331
00:22:08.689 --> 00:22:11.160
And that's where the Markov blanket comes into play.

332
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:16.060
So the Markov blanket is a set of states

333
00:22:16.699 --> 00:22:22.130
that intervene between the states that are internal to

334
00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.550
let's call it an agent. It could be anything,

335
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.469
it could be any self, let's call it, call

336
00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:29.790
it an agent, but it could be a particle,

337
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.800
it could be a person, it could be a

338
00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.079
population, but we'll call it an agent. So the

339
00:22:34.199 --> 00:22:38.459
Markov blanket is a way of drawing a boundary

340
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.290
around the states that are internal to the agent

341
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.020
that separates the internal states from the external states.

342
00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:50.329
And the external states are now the environment and

343
00:22:50.339 --> 00:22:52.680
the Markov blanket very much in the same way

344
00:22:52.689 --> 00:22:55.780
that we talked about before that the brain is

345
00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.300
in the darkness of the skull and only has

346
00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:02.689
access to the environment through the sensory impressions. So

347
00:23:02.699 --> 00:23:07.189
the Markov blanket contains all the sensory impressions that

348
00:23:07.199 --> 00:23:11.739
the external states provide on the blanket. These are

349
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.290
sensations and then those sensory states that are part

350
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.920
of the boundary of the blanket then affect the

351
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.300
intern states in the neuronal activity. But the Markov

352
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:27.410
blanket also contains those states that mediate the influence

353
00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.650
of the inside on the outside and they refer

354
00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.719
to as active states. So you've got this notion

355
00:23:33.729 --> 00:23:36.479
that there's a set of states, the internal states

356
00:23:36.489 --> 00:23:40.650
say my brain, I've got my external states, the

357
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.300
rest of the universe. And then there are the

358
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.000
boundary or the blanket states. This is a Markov

359
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.300
blanket and they are split into two and the

360
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.359
sensory states mediate the effects of the outside on

361
00:23:53.369 --> 00:23:57.469
the inside and the active states mediate the effects

362
00:23:57.479 --> 00:24:00.729
of the inside on the outside. So this is

363
00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:04.880
the physics and the Markov blanket has a very

364
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:12.109
particular definition. It simply means that the the um

365
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:17.359
the sensory states cannot be influenced by the internal

366
00:24:17.369 --> 00:24:22.150
states and the active states cannot be influenced by

367
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.010
the external states. So let me try and make

368
00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.609
that even simpler. Um If you were a systems

369
00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:32.099
theorist, you would define any given system. So now

370
00:24:32.109 --> 00:24:34.979
our agent is now a system um in terms

371
00:24:34.989 --> 00:24:39.349
of its inputs and outputs and the active and

372
00:24:39.359 --> 00:24:43.229
sensory states are just the outputs and the inputs

373
00:24:43.239 --> 00:24:45.750
of a particular system. So it's a way of

374
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:49.959
defining a system or an agent in terms of

375
00:24:49.969 --> 00:24:53.010
its relationship to everything else through its inputs and

376
00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.390
outputs. And the Markov blanket condition requires that the

377
00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.469
inputs to a system cannot be affected by the

378
00:25:00.479 --> 00:25:04.829
system that is being into which the inputs are

379
00:25:04.839 --> 00:25:09.589
being supplied. Similarly, the outputs of a system can't

380
00:25:09.599 --> 00:25:13.670
be influenced by the, by the external states that

381
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.550
are receiving that output. And with that very, very

382
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.310
simple rule or definition of some thing, an agent

383
00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:25.810
or a system. Um IN terms of Markov blankets,

384
00:25:25.869 --> 00:25:28.599
you can then show that there is always a

385
00:25:28.609 --> 00:25:33.670
description of the observable aspects of the system which

386
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.680
are just the uh the blanket state. So you

387
00:25:36.689 --> 00:25:41.000
can never see inside you observing me means that

388
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.800
all you can see are my blanket states, my

389
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:47.599
surface, my boundary. Uh And usually you can only

390
00:25:47.609 --> 00:25:51.439
see the consequences of my, of my action. Um

391
00:25:52.849 --> 00:25:58.030
So given those, um given those um uh those

392
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.660
conditions and the existence of a Markov blanket, um

393
00:26:01.719 --> 00:26:06.180
it is then fairly straightforward to show mathematically that

394
00:26:06.189 --> 00:26:09.689
the internal states and the active states have to

395
00:26:09.699 --> 00:26:14.520
minimize free energy if this system has some characteristic

396
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:18.010
states and it has to have characteristic states, otherwise

397
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.750
it wouldn't have a markoff blanket. So what you're

398
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.709
saying is that anything that exists in the sense

399
00:26:23.719 --> 00:26:28.660
of possessing a Markov blanket or a boundary that

400
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.680
persists over a certain amount of time can always

401
00:26:32.689 --> 00:26:38.040
be described as self evidencing, can always be described

402
00:26:38.109 --> 00:26:40.839
as if it is engaging in some kind of

403
00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:44.469
active infant sense making and acting on the basis

404
00:26:44.479 --> 00:26:47.430
of, of that sense making. So the mark of

405
00:26:47.449 --> 00:26:50.359
black is absolutely crucial because that's where the story

406
00:26:50.369 --> 00:26:54.560
starts really. And it also it takes you beyond

407
00:26:54.589 --> 00:26:58.630
um physics as we know and love it. Um

408
00:26:58.819 --> 00:27:03.420
IN the sense that um this description of the

409
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:08.040
dynamics of something or an agent is in terms

410
00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:15.619
of the, the internal states holding mathematical or probabilistic

411
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:20.069
beliefs about external states. This is quite unique to

412
00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:22.189
the free energy principle. Normally, when people talk about

413
00:27:22.199 --> 00:27:26.359
probability distributions, they are talking about a probability distribution

414
00:27:26.369 --> 00:27:30.949
over some states. When you're, when you're talking about

415
00:27:31.209 --> 00:27:35.449
um the free energy principle and what some people

416
00:27:35.459 --> 00:27:39.250
refer to as the basing mechanics that ensues you're

417
00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:44.489
talking now truly about um beliefs encoded by the

418
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:49.420
internal states about something. So it's information beyond Shannon,

419
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.189
it's, you know, it's truly representational beliefs. And I

420
00:27:54.199 --> 00:27:57.469
introduced the notion of basing mechanics because um just

421
00:27:57.479 --> 00:28:02.140
to reassure you that the maths that underwrites the

422
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:07.310
basic mechanics um is exactly the same maths that

423
00:28:07.319 --> 00:28:11.930
you will find in quantum mechanics in statistical mechanics.

424
00:28:11.939 --> 00:28:15.819
And in classical mechanics, it's all the same maths.

425
00:28:15.829 --> 00:28:19.750
The only difference um or the only special thing

426
00:28:20.079 --> 00:28:23.510
required by the basing mechanics is the existence of,

427
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.640
of this separation. Uh The Markov blanket that separates

428
00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.959
the states of something from the states that are

429
00:28:30.969 --> 00:28:33.189
not part of, of the thing in question.

430
00:28:34.839 --> 00:28:39.089
And is it possible to determine precisely where the

431
00:28:39.099 --> 00:28:43.199
boundary or the mark of blanket is located and

432
00:28:43.209 --> 00:28:47.459
how we separate internal states from external states?

433
00:28:48.349 --> 00:28:52.130
Yes. Uh YOU know, with, with a formal and

434
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:56.050
um um mathematically crisp definition. Yes, it is. So

435
00:28:56.099 --> 00:29:00.489
um um you and there are if you like

436
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:05.260
numerical um studies illustrating, how you can identify markoff

437
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:09.729
blankets, given some data. Um I have colleagues um

438
00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.520
um in academia and in industry working on Markov

439
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:19.689
blanket discovery algorithms. Um So it certainly is possible

440
00:29:19.699 --> 00:29:23.369
and what you're basically looking for is um an

441
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.099
absence of, of influence or coupling that it's this

442
00:29:27.109 --> 00:29:33.099
sparsity um that emerges from, oh sorry, that underpins

443
00:29:33.209 --> 00:29:38.250
Marko blankets. And interestingly in um some work by,

444
00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:42.459
by my friend Dalton shows that for any um

445
00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:47.380
technically any random uh random dynamical system with sparse

446
00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:51.250
coupling, there will always be with probability 11 or

447
00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:55.150
more markoff blankets in any system. So, you know,

448
00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.280
these are not remarkable things, you know, it can

449
00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.564
be no, the way for any random, you know,

450
00:30:00.785 --> 00:30:06.015
any random dynamical system that has um that persists

451
00:30:06.025 --> 00:30:10.005
it doesn't sort of diverge exponentially into nothing as

452
00:30:10.015 --> 00:30:12.464
long as it persists and has technically what's called

453
00:30:12.474 --> 00:30:14.755
a pull back a tractor, then you will have

454
00:30:14.765 --> 00:30:19.420
markoff blankets having said that um you have to

455
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:25.119
pick the scale and the internal states to define

456
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:28.660
the Markov blanket. So there's not one Markov blanket,

457
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:34.060
there are possibly uncountable, countably large number of Markov

458
00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:37.099
blankets and you can have Markov blankets within Markov

459
00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:41.010
blankets. You can have Markov blankets of Markov blankets.

460
00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:44.859
So you, you have to, if you actually wanted

461
00:30:44.869 --> 00:30:48.180
to identify a Markov blanket and there are lots

462
00:30:48.189 --> 00:30:49.760
of good reasons why you might want to do

463
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.829
that. You really have to specify the scale at

464
00:30:52.839 --> 00:30:55.000
which you are doing it. So if you were

465
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:58.599
a molecular biologist, the Markov blanket or a cellular

466
00:30:58.609 --> 00:31:02.109
biologist, you might draw a Markov blanket around a

467
00:31:02.119 --> 00:31:06.329
particular cell of interest. If you were a cognitive

468
00:31:06.339 --> 00:31:09.939
neuroscientist, you might draw it around the brain. If

469
00:31:09.949 --> 00:31:14.410
you were a theoretical biologist interested in evolution, you

470
00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.219
might draw it around a species. If you were

471
00:31:17.229 --> 00:31:20.089
doing climate change, you might draw it around certain

472
00:31:20.099 --> 00:31:24.380
aspects of the biosphere. So uh and each one

473
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:27.489
of these Markov blankets would, would contextualize all the,

474
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.410
all the smaller Markov blankets within it and at

475
00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.489
different scales. So I I'm trying to emphasize there

476
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.079
is no wrong Markov blanket. But as soon as

477
00:31:37.089 --> 00:31:40.540
you identify some thing, then it must, by definition

478
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:43.589
have a markoff blanket. So if it is a

479
00:31:43.599 --> 00:31:47.040
natural kind, then it must have a Markov blanket

480
00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.020
just to describe it. So a cell has a

481
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:54.150
markoff blanket. Um A organ has a markoff blanket,

482
00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:56.459
a set of organs, a phenotype has a markoff

483
00:31:56.489 --> 00:32:00.979
blanket. A family has a markoff blanket, a community,

484
00:32:00.989 --> 00:32:04.579
a population, they all have their inputs and outputs.

485
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.719
And I repeat because you've got a very precise

486
00:32:07.729 --> 00:32:11.199
specification of what it means how you define the

487
00:32:11.209 --> 00:32:13.979
Markov blanket. All you have to do is to

488
00:32:13.989 --> 00:32:17.130
identify the sparse coupling. You just have to identify

489
00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.670
what is not influenced by what. And once you've

490
00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.209
done that, there are easy mathematical recipes for identifying

491
00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:28.219
the Markov blanket just for your entertainment. Um The

492
00:32:28.229 --> 00:32:31.209
the Marko blanket of any given state or set

493
00:32:31.219 --> 00:32:37.150
of states is effectively the parents of by which

494
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.420
I mean, those things that influence the parents of

495
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:45.780
your internal states, the Children, which are your active

496
00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:49.310
states, the things that you influence in the things

497
00:32:49.319 --> 00:32:52.349
that the internal states influence and the parents of

498
00:32:52.359 --> 00:32:56.300
the Children. So, if you think about the the

499
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.739
two rules, I said that the sensory states cannot

500
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.040
be influenced by the internal states and the active

501
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:06.300
states cannot be influenced by the external states. Then

502
00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:10.969
the complete set of parents and Children and parents

503
00:33:10.979 --> 00:33:13.790
of the Children are just the blanket state. It

504
00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:16.560
is sensitive based on the active states. So you

505
00:33:16.569 --> 00:33:20.069
can identify that using matrix algebra and dynamical systems

506
00:33:20.079 --> 00:33:23.390
theory. Um OR you can infer that by using

507
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.349
Markov blanket discovery algorithms.

508
00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:31.880
Mhm But there's a bidirectional interaction between the internal

509
00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:33.910
states and the external states.

510
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:37.709
Correct. Absolutely. And, and that, I mean that that

511
00:33:37.719 --> 00:33:40.910
is a key construct uh that the Markov blanket

512
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.390
uh brings to the table, you've got this sort

513
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.170
of um boundary that allows you to say no,

514
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.849
these are the states of the agent or the

515
00:33:49.859 --> 00:33:52.569
system in question. And these are the state of

516
00:33:52.579 --> 00:33:56.890
the environment um or the external states, but they

517
00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:02.099
are uh bidirectionally coupled. So the system is vicariously

518
00:34:02.109 --> 00:34:06.819
open to everything else, but only through this two

519
00:34:06.829 --> 00:34:10.679
way street, which is the Markov blanket. And you

520
00:34:10.688 --> 00:34:13.879
know, and that reciprocal aspect that you you foregrounded

521
00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:16.889
there is really important. And that's just why I

522
00:34:16.899 --> 00:34:20.000
made such a big point about saying there are

523
00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:23.989
sensory and active parts of the Markov blanket sometimes

524
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.310
referred to as sectors. Um And I say that

525
00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.739
because the, you know, you can think of the

526
00:34:29.748 --> 00:34:34.239
Markov blanket in terms of inputs and outputs. Um

527
00:34:34.248 --> 00:34:38.289
But you can also um apply quantum information theory.

528
00:34:38.299 --> 00:34:40.549
Um And people like chris fields have done this

529
00:34:40.559 --> 00:34:42.918
and then the Markov blanket becomes something known as

530
00:34:42.928 --> 00:34:46.408
a holographic screen. And the holographic principle says that

531
00:34:46.518 --> 00:34:51.368
all the information that is accessible um from an

532
00:34:51.378 --> 00:34:55.043
observer from the outside about the internal states on

533
00:34:55.054 --> 00:34:58.725
the other side of the holographic screen is available

534
00:34:58.774 --> 00:35:01.915
on the holographic screen. So that's all, that's what

535
00:35:01.925 --> 00:35:05.324
I was intimating before. When I, you know, when

536
00:35:05.334 --> 00:35:08.564
I'm looking at you, I'm basically looking at your

537
00:35:08.574 --> 00:35:12.205
Markov blanket or your holographic screen at the scale

538
00:35:12.215 --> 00:35:14.284
that you know that we are actually communicating.

539
00:35:15.629 --> 00:35:19.459
So if we want to talk about causality here,

540
00:35:19.469 --> 00:35:23.699
would there be a circular causality between the internal

541
00:35:23.709 --> 00:35:26.219
states and the external states? Is that it?

542
00:35:26.229 --> 00:35:29.649
Yes. Yeah, that, that, that, that is another really

543
00:35:29.659 --> 00:35:34.820
important point. Yes. Um So, first of all, just

544
00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:40.149
to be very clear and precise about um causal

545
00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.719
causality in this framework. Um So this framework, the

546
00:35:44.729 --> 00:35:48.270
three principle always stays very close to the physics.

547
00:35:48.449 --> 00:35:52.330
So causality here is very, very clear. It is

548
00:35:52.449 --> 00:35:58.260
basically the influence of one state on another state

549
00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:01.879
that is expressed in time, usually expressed in terms

550
00:36:01.889 --> 00:36:04.469
of a stochastic differential equation, which would be one

551
00:36:04.479 --> 00:36:07.580
way of writing down a random dynamical system such

552
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.699
as I say a long random system. So we're

553
00:36:09.709 --> 00:36:14.409
using causality in a mathematical sense. Um um THAT

554
00:36:14.419 --> 00:36:17.590
could also be read as in a controlled theoretic

555
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.629
sense I cause changes in you simply by having

556
00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:24.899
an influence on you. So is that causal structure

557
00:36:26.149 --> 00:36:29.889
that defines the Markov blanket? Now notice there is

558
00:36:29.899 --> 00:36:36.330
another whole universe of causality which does not rest

559
00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.899
upon control theory or dynamical systems theory or random

560
00:36:39.909 --> 00:36:44.739
dynamical systems. Um You know, the French principle is

561
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:47.810
not interested in that kind of causality. It's just

562
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.899
interested in exactly the kind of causality that underwrites

563
00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:54.979
the uh the market blanket. And simply because we've

564
00:36:54.989 --> 00:36:59.919
got these bidirectional influences causal inferences, you're absolutely right.

565
00:36:59.929 --> 00:37:03.600
There's c causality and that circular causality just as

566
00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:08.330
the action perception cycle. And that becomes really important

567
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.330
when you think about two agents or an ensemble

568
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.820
of agents all communicating with each other or coupled

569
00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:19.580
through their own bound markoff boundaries or markoff blankets

570
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:24.540
with each other, no one system causes the others,

571
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:27.370
they all cause each other. Uh And you even

572
00:37:27.379 --> 00:37:30.580
see that uh within the o let's take, let's

573
00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:34.219
come back to this notion of the brain as

574
00:37:34.229 --> 00:37:38.750
a hierarchical generative model. Then the hierarchies are defined

575
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.120
by their Markov blankets. So you've got nested Markov

576
00:37:41.169 --> 00:37:44.739
blankets in the brain. And we were saying before

577
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:55.560
that one functional architecture that is um necessary, not

578
00:37:55.870 --> 00:38:00.540
that is necessary in terms of the Markov banker,

579
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.280
but also necessary to understand the predicted coding is

580
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.969
the sort of they are sending and descending messages,

581
00:38:05.979 --> 00:38:09.250
predictions and prediction errors. So again, you know, you've

582
00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.250
got circular causality. Does the prediction cause a prediction

583
00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:16.649
error or does the prediction revise your prediction. So

584
00:38:16.739 --> 00:38:19.709
circular circular causality wherever you look.

585
00:38:20.159 --> 00:38:23.260
Mhm Perhaps this is a good point to introduce.

586
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:27.020
Then another concept, what is an autonomous state,

587
00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:32.070
an autonomous state in the context of a Markov

588
00:38:32.189 --> 00:38:36.629
blanket partition is just a description of those states

589
00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:41.580
that can be described as minimizing free energy and

590
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:44.370
very simply they are just the internal states and

591
00:38:44.379 --> 00:38:50.929
the active states. So mathematically, um it's just those

592
00:38:50.939 --> 00:38:55.010
states, those subset, those states of a particular agent

593
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:58.250
um that can be described as if they are

594
00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:03.739
minimizing prediction error or free energy. So the nice

595
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:07.280
thing about having that split of autonomous states into

596
00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:10.800
internal states and active states, then you can say

597
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:14.020
that it must be the case that the internal

598
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:17.270
states are minimizing free energy. So it looks as

599
00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.340
if they are minimizing their prediction. So it looks

600
00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:22.520
as if they are doing perception while the active

601
00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:25.439
states which are the other part of the autonomous

602
00:39:25.449 --> 00:39:29.459
states um are also minimizing exactly the same quantity

603
00:39:29.469 --> 00:39:31.830
which is the prediction error. But in this instance,

604
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.219
in the productions of the felt body, technically the

605
00:39:35.229 --> 00:39:40.449
proprioceptive or inceptive um uh predictions. And of course,

606
00:39:40.459 --> 00:39:43.270
that's just action. So again, you've got a nice

607
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.199
if you like a common framework or a first

608
00:39:47.209 --> 00:39:52.949
principle account that ties together action and perception through

609
00:39:52.959 --> 00:39:56.679
a common application of the free energy principle to,

610
00:39:56.689 --> 00:39:58.899
to those states to which the free energy principle

611
00:39:58.909 --> 00:40:01.419
applies, which are just the internal states and the

612
00:40:01.429 --> 00:40:03.979
active states. So notice the sensory states don't do

613
00:40:03.989 --> 00:40:07.729
that. The sensory states don't minimize prediction error because

614
00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:10.320
they are influenced by the external states. But the

615
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:15.790
active states by construction are only influenced, they are

616
00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.040
not influenced by the external states and the internal

617
00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:21.979
states are not influenced directly by the external states

618
00:40:21.989 --> 00:40:25.860
because they are hidden behind or sequestered by the

619
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:29.840
Markov blanket. So the autonomous states, the active states

620
00:40:30.209 --> 00:40:34.149
and the internal states are unique in the sense

621
00:40:34.159 --> 00:40:36.919
that they are not directly influenced or caused by

622
00:40:36.929 --> 00:40:41.189
external states. And that's, you know, that then um

623
00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.639
leads you to this interpretation in terms of inference,

624
00:40:44.649 --> 00:40:47.340
in terms of, you know, the internal states holding

625
00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:50.669
beliefs about the external states and using those beliefs

626
00:40:50.679 --> 00:40:52.989
to predict how they're going to act, act upon

627
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:53.399
the world.

628
00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:58.600
Mhm You've already explained here more or less how

629
00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:02.669
this framework might apply to different kinds of systems.

630
00:41:02.679 --> 00:41:06.719
But how do we get to living systems? I

631
00:41:06.729 --> 00:41:09.919
mean, what is the difference between a living system

632
00:41:09.929 --> 00:41:11.689
and the nonliving system?

633
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.149
Um Yeah, that's an excellent question. Um I think

634
00:41:17.159 --> 00:41:19.199
probably best tackled from the point of view, the

635
00:41:19.209 --> 00:41:22.979
free energy principle. Um So you've got this um

636
00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:27.340
this description of any kind of particle, any kind

637
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:31.340
of thing um in terms of its markoff blanket

638
00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:36.050
partition. Now that means that there are different kinds

639
00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.800
of things. And your question I think is at

640
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:42.459
what point would you call this particle living or

641
00:41:42.469 --> 00:41:46.820
biotic? And at which point would it um take

642
00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:51.360
on the um the attribute that would associate with

643
00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:55.590
agency and possibly sentience? Um So we just work

644
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.419
through it again, it's relatively straightforward. So we can

645
00:41:59.429 --> 00:42:03.010
have things where the mark where the active sector

646
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.919
of the markoff blanket is empty. So we're talking

647
00:42:06.929 --> 00:42:09.489
about things that cannot act upon the world, they

648
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.600
can still sense the world, they can still be

649
00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:15.389
affected by the universe, but they can't act. So,

650
00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:17.919
you know, one might imagine a rock on the

651
00:42:17.929 --> 00:42:21.540
moon, for example, or something that, that, that does

652
00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:24.790
not have the um does not have a full

653
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.679
complement of autonomous states in the sense that if

654
00:42:27.689 --> 00:42:30.500
the autonomous states are the internal states and the

655
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:32.810
active states, if they don't have the active states,

656
00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.820
they can't move. So you wouldn't call these kinds

657
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:42.320
of inert systems or inert particles. Um um Living,

658
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.489
would you call them uh living if they were

659
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:51.889
able to move basically um active states that express

660
00:42:51.899 --> 00:42:55.209
themselves by acting upon the environment? We were just

661
00:42:55.219 --> 00:42:57.889
talking about things that move effectively in a, in

662
00:42:57.919 --> 00:43:02.360
a classical uh context. Um AND things that move

663
00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:04.770
in a way that depends on and only on

664
00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.610
the internal states and not the external states. So

665
00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:11.459
there will be another definition of autonomous dynamics. Then

666
00:43:11.469 --> 00:43:17.219
I think you're probably getting closer to biological self-organization

667
00:43:17.229 --> 00:43:21.590
or biotic self-organization. Uh Is it living um at

668
00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.989
this point, um probably not there, there's an extra

669
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.179
uh if you like condition that you would probably

670
00:43:30.189 --> 00:43:33.590
want to apply before you would say that this

671
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.500
is biotic or biological uh self organization. And that

672
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:44.020
is the precision or the reproducibility of the movement.

673
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:48.120
So, if something is very, very small, it usually

674
00:43:48.129 --> 00:43:51.860
comes along with lots of random fluctuations. So usually

675
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:55.379
things fluctuate very quickly. They have a higher temperature

676
00:43:55.389 --> 00:43:57.550
from the point of view of cis mechanics. When

677
00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.290
they are very, very small. And in the limit

678
00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.429
of quantum uh physics, it's all uh it's all

679
00:44:03.439 --> 00:44:08.169
random effectively um or occurring so quickly, you can't

680
00:44:08.179 --> 00:44:09.790
measure it. So you can only describe it in

681
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.149
terms of probability distributions. Um But living things have

682
00:44:14.159 --> 00:44:18.510
characteristic states that they keep on revisiting that you

683
00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.879
can recognize um you know, when um in, you

684
00:44:22.889 --> 00:44:27.399
know, in a life form simply because um there

685
00:44:27.409 --> 00:44:31.750
is some systematic revisiting of certain states. And that

686
00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:35.560
tells you two things about self-organization of biological, of

687
00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:39.550
a biological sort or a living sort. It tells

688
00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:44.179
you that they have to be realized in systems

689
00:44:44.189 --> 00:44:47.969
that are sufficiently large for the random fluctuations to

690
00:44:47.979 --> 00:44:51.209
be averaged away. So you won't find living things

691
00:44:51.219 --> 00:44:54.989
at the quantum level. Um But you may find

692
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.409
it at the level of um say a virus

693
00:44:58.419 --> 00:45:00.100
and you'll certainly find it at the level of

694
00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:01.860
a cell as you get to sort of, you

695
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:04.889
know, hundreds of microns or you know, even millimeters.

696
00:45:05.139 --> 00:45:07.959
Uh AND when you get to something, our size,

697
00:45:07.969 --> 00:45:12.129
then if something, our size moves around of its

698
00:45:12.139 --> 00:45:15.330
own accord because it, it has active states that

699
00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.409
are driven by turn. So you'll say yes, that

700
00:45:17.419 --> 00:45:21.379
that is certainly living. Um So size really does

701
00:45:21.389 --> 00:45:24.419
matter. The scale really does matter, I think. Um

702
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:28.520
And the reason that scale is so important is

703
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:32.520
as things get bigger, all the random fluctuations disappear

704
00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.929
and things get much more precise in terms of

705
00:45:34.939 --> 00:45:38.409
their dynamics that flowed. But the other interesting aspect

706
00:45:38.419 --> 00:45:45.120
of this and interestingly um this inherits from the

707
00:45:45.129 --> 00:45:48.639
physics work of Helmholtz when he was trying to

708
00:45:48.649 --> 00:45:53.760
understand the flow of systems, say for example, turbulence

709
00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:58.120
in water. Um YOU know, is there any way

710
00:45:58.129 --> 00:46:01.419
that you can sort of classify the dynamics of

711
00:46:01.429 --> 00:46:03.959
the flow or the movement of states in some

712
00:46:03.969 --> 00:46:08.800
state in some abstract state space? And the Helmholtz

713
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:15.419
decomposition says yes, you can divide things into those

714
00:46:15.429 --> 00:46:20.340
flows that try to minimize their energy. And for

715
00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:23.120
our invasive mechanics, this is the variation of free

716
00:46:23.129 --> 00:46:25.850
energy in classical mechanics. It would be things like

717
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.270
gravity in thermodynamics. It would be things like a

718
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:36.050
potential potential energy. So systems can be described in

719
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.110
terms of their flows, you know, so I'm using

720
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.120
flows and dynamics interchangeably here. So and the flow

721
00:46:43.129 --> 00:46:45.610
can be split into two parts. The first part

722
00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.510
is known as a dissipative flow. And it's that

723
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:52.610
which can be described as flowing downhill, like literally

724
00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.860
water flowing um flowing down a valley or down

725
00:46:56.870 --> 00:47:02.820
a potential gradient. And that dissipative um aspect underwrites.

726
00:47:02.909 --> 00:47:06.040
Um A lot of cis mechanics in terms of

727
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:10.969
fluctuation dissipation theorems. Uh um um uh AND a

728
00:47:10.979 --> 00:47:15.959
lot of the rhetoric surrounding c mechanics like heat

729
00:47:15.969 --> 00:47:19.399
and work all speaks to the way in which

730
00:47:19.409 --> 00:47:24.540
heat is dissipated or work with work due to

731
00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:27.139
this kind of flow. There's another kind of flow.

732
00:47:27.149 --> 00:47:31.310
So if you imagine a valley and you've got

733
00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:36.469
flows down the valley and these flows are equipped

734
00:47:36.479 --> 00:47:38.760
with random fluctuation, so you never settle at the

735
00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:41.959
bottom of the valley. You, you, you um uh

736
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:43.570
because as soon as you get there, there will

737
00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:47.050
be some random fluctuation that pushes you away. So

738
00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:49.560
there'll be a little um a little regime at

739
00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:52.399
the bottom of the valley that every you have

740
00:47:52.409 --> 00:47:54.600
flown down into and then you're perturbed by the

741
00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:59.149
random fluctuations that's thermodynamic equilibrium. And that will be

742
00:47:59.159 --> 00:48:03.879
the dissipative physics that you know, the statistical mechanics

743
00:48:03.889 --> 00:48:06.820
is based on. But there's another really important kind

744
00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:11.899
of flow which emerges in non equilibrium systems. Um

745
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:16.610
And that's flow around the iso contours around the

746
00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.909
rim or any given level of the bowl. So

747
00:48:20.919 --> 00:48:23.969
this conserves the energy or the height of the

748
00:48:23.979 --> 00:48:29.760
bowl. So it's called conservative uh mechanics. Um And

749
00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:34.340
um this is really important. So in the limit

750
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:37.830
that things get very, very, very, very big, the

751
00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:42.159
random fluctuations are almost zero. And so what do

752
00:48:42.169 --> 00:48:46.550
you see, you just see this conservative flow, like

753
00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.030
for example, the motion of a heavenly body like

754
00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:53.639
the moon orbits. Now, these things have a certain

755
00:48:53.649 --> 00:48:56.899
aspect which brings us back to um what we're

756
00:48:56.909 --> 00:48:59.770
talking about for in terms of biological self-organization, which

757
00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:03.199
is revisiting states that you were once in characteristic

758
00:49:03.209 --> 00:49:07.620
states that you sometimes wander away from um with

759
00:49:07.629 --> 00:49:10.439
an itinerant trajectory, but you always come back again.

760
00:49:10.709 --> 00:49:13.250
Um So in the limit of being very, very

761
00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:16.239
big, much bigger than you and me, uh then,

762
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:19.739
then we now conform to conservative mechanics and we

763
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:23.790
have this c this circular flow. This is sometimes

764
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.860
a solenoid flow as well. And you can read

765
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:29.110
about that if you look at you know basic

766
00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:33.409
descriptions of things like fluid, fluid mechanics. But that

767
00:49:33.419 --> 00:49:37.889
decomposition or variance of it holds for any kind

768
00:49:37.899 --> 00:49:41.600
of state including the states that comprise the Markov

769
00:49:41.689 --> 00:49:45.830
blanket partition into internal blanket states and external states.

770
00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:48.659
And this is so this is to my mind

771
00:49:48.669 --> 00:49:51.840
is so important because what it says is if

772
00:49:52.199 --> 00:49:56.060
the random fluctuations are sufficiently small that I can

773
00:49:56.070 --> 00:50:02.429
see the steroidal flow, what that means is things

774
00:50:02.439 --> 00:50:07.860
of a certain scale will always revisit states that

775
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:10.810
they were once in. And then you just think

776
00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:13.889
about this at different scales. What you are talking

777
00:50:13.899 --> 00:50:17.439
about is either very, very fast oscillations, for example,

778
00:50:17.449 --> 00:50:21.239
in your brain cells or they could be the

779
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:26.189
cardiac cycle going around these um itinerant orbits just

780
00:50:26.199 --> 00:50:28.879
like the move but much more complicated now and

781
00:50:28.889 --> 00:50:32.679
uh slightly fuzzy because you're sufficiently small um to

782
00:50:32.689 --> 00:50:36.540
actually have random fluctuations there. Um It could be

783
00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:39.560
walking or it could be by sleep weight cycle.

784
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.840
It could in fact be reproduction or replication at

785
00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:46.610
an evolutionary scale. At every scale, you've got this

786
00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:51.870
characteristic solenoid dynamics, this conservative aspect that I think

787
00:50:51.879 --> 00:50:56.919
is definitive of biological self-organization. So essentially things that

788
00:50:56.929 --> 00:51:01.929
have biorhythms and life cycles. Um MEAN that um

789
00:51:02.419 --> 00:51:06.709
well put it another way, if um biological, if

790
00:51:06.719 --> 00:51:12.879
living things have evinced spy RMS and life cycles,

791
00:51:12.979 --> 00:51:15.040
then that means that they must belong to a

792
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:19.139
certain class of um things at a particular scale,

793
00:51:19.149 --> 00:51:21.159
they have to be bigger than the quantum scale,

794
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:24.469
but to be sufficiently itinerant, um they have to

795
00:51:24.479 --> 00:51:27.419
be smaller than the, you know, the, the cosmological

796
00:51:27.429 --> 00:51:30.479
scale you we can go on if you wanted

797
00:51:30.489 --> 00:51:32.969
to, you know, there are, there are, there's one

798
00:51:32.979 --> 00:51:38.260
final um kind of thing that has this um

799
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:45.040
this um conservative aspect, um the solenoid um um

800
00:51:45.189 --> 00:51:50.330
aspect to it. And that's when the dynamics become

801
00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:53.780
very, very precise. Um WHICH means that you can

802
00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:57.479
effectively roll out into the future. And if you

803
00:51:57.489 --> 00:52:00.370
can run out into the future, that means not

804
00:52:00.379 --> 00:52:03.510
only can you predict the state at the moment

805
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.300
that um um this um uh this system is

806
00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:11.929
in but the long term future And if the

807
00:52:11.989 --> 00:52:14.149
uh if you can predict the long term future,

808
00:52:14.419 --> 00:52:16.530
it will look as though certain kinds of things

809
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.110
like you may plan into the future we have

810
00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:22.239
intentions. And I think now we're now getting very

811
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:27.520
close to um life forms with agency. Um So,

812
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:31.840
you know, to uh cut a long story short.

813
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:35.149
Um um So the answer to your question is

814
00:52:35.159 --> 00:52:37.860
yes, there are certainly different kinds of physical systems

815
00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:42.280
uh at different scales with different degrees of random

816
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:47.139
fluctuations um and different kinds of dynamics. Um And

817
00:52:47.149 --> 00:52:51.689
I would posit that life is basically um uh

818
00:52:51.699 --> 00:52:55.229
a special kind of thing. Um THAT would subsume

819
00:52:55.239 --> 00:52:59.229
things that are um properly a gent in the

820
00:52:59.239 --> 00:53:01.189
sense that they plan and some things that are

821
00:53:01.199 --> 00:53:04.340
not, I don't think viruses plan. Um Whereas I

822
00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:06.409
do think, say b is a new, you and

823
00:53:06.419 --> 00:53:10.090
I plan into the future. Um And, but we

824
00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:13.290
are quite special. We're in a goldilocks regime between

825
00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.899
being very, very small and being very, very big.

826
00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:20.899
So would this framework help us deal with the,

827
00:53:20.909 --> 00:53:26.060
with questions surrounding what separates exactly the organic from

828
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:30.439
the inorganic and particular kinds of entities like viruses?

829
00:53:30.449 --> 00:53:34.459
Because viruses in particularly are very people debate a

830
00:53:34.469 --> 00:53:39.129
lot about whether they are living systems or nonliving

831
00:53:39.139 --> 00:53:39.889
systems,

832
00:53:39.899 --> 00:53:44.010
right? Yeah. Um I mean, you could certainly use

833
00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:48.870
this framework um to happily accommodate the vagueness and

834
00:53:48.879 --> 00:53:51.379
I'm using vagueness now in a philosophical sense. Yeah.

835
00:53:51.649 --> 00:53:54.409
How many grains of sand, make a pile of

836
00:53:54.419 --> 00:53:56.949
sand. So at what point would a virus be

837
00:53:56.959 --> 00:53:59.929
called living when it was sufficiently big or complicated?

838
00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:04.429
You can certainly locate a vague notion of um,

839
00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:08.909
living versus nonliving. Um And even to, uh I

840
00:54:08.919 --> 00:54:11.500
think to a certain extent agents versus non agents

841
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:16.110
or sentient, but versus non agent on, on this

842
00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.929
space afforded by, um, the, the Markov blanket and

843
00:54:19.939 --> 00:54:23.070
implicitly the free Engine principle. Absolutely. Uh You know,

844
00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:27.500
could you draw bright lines um between, um you

845
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:32.939
know, is, I think you possibly could draw some

846
00:54:32.949 --> 00:54:40.500
bright lines. Um um YOU know, in, for example,

847
00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:45.669
you could say, well, in the limit that the

848
00:54:45.679 --> 00:54:49.870
random fluctuations disappear on the inside, that might be

849
00:54:49.879 --> 00:54:54.000
a bright line between things that are biotic and

850
00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:58.409
not biotic. Um That's not to say that, you

851
00:54:58.419 --> 00:55:01.520
know, so a virus would certainly be biotic. Um

852
00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:05.389
It would have, it would have recognizable um states

853
00:55:05.399 --> 00:55:08.199
and trajectories and character and it would have this

854
00:55:08.209 --> 00:55:10.239
solo aspect. It will, it will have a life

855
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:13.260
cycle, it will, you know, survive in a particular

856
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:18.169
eco niche. So usually intracellular one. BUT you wouldn't

857
00:55:18.179 --> 00:55:20.889
necessarily say it was living. So you ask, well,

858
00:55:20.899 --> 00:55:23.030
what does it have to, what does it mean

859
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.860
to, to, to, to, to live? Um um AND

860
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:30.189
in particular, what does it mean to, I, I

861
00:55:30.199 --> 00:55:33.810
think be um to be an agent in, in,

862
00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:37.159
in a sort of, in the sense that um

863
00:55:37.229 --> 00:55:41.860
there is that kind of anthropomorphic agency and autonomy,

864
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:44.780
autonomy. And I think that the bright line there

865
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:49.159
is that the um the system can be described

866
00:55:49.169 --> 00:55:51.310
as if it has a garr model of the

867
00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:54.840
consequences of its own active states. I think that

868
00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:56.939
is a, that possibly is a bright line that,

869
00:55:56.949 --> 00:56:00.719
that helps basically give you an ontology of different

870
00:56:00.729 --> 00:56:04.489
kinds of things. Um And, you know, if you've

871
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:08.139
got, if so, I'm now appealing to you, if

872
00:56:08.149 --> 00:56:09.699
you recall at the beginning, I was setting up

873
00:56:09.709 --> 00:56:13.080
the notion of a model as foundational. Um So

874
00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:17.439
the jar model is just basically a description of

875
00:56:17.479 --> 00:56:22.320
a pro description of the characteristic states of the

876
00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:26.919
thing in question. Um And if you, if your

877
00:56:26.929 --> 00:56:32.360
generative model is such that it includes uh paths

878
00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:36.100
into the future and because the future is caused

879
00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:39.250
because of the circular, circular causality you mentioned before,

880
00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:43.159
which is acting upon the world, then implicitly, you've

881
00:56:43.169 --> 00:56:47.629
got a generative model or at least your internal

882
00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:52.530
dynamics can be described as having an internal model

883
00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:55.209
of the consequences of your action in the future.

884
00:56:55.729 --> 00:56:58.649
And at that point, I think you are starting

885
00:56:58.659 --> 00:57:02.780
to talk about minimal agency, not minimal self hood.

886
00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:07.010
This kind of system doesn't know it's an agent,

887
00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.689
but it now has a minimal kind of agency

888
00:57:10.699 --> 00:57:13.219
in the sense it represents the consequences of its

889
00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:17.989
actions and can be understood or read as selecting

890
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.510
among a number of different actions. And choosing the

891
00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.419
one that is most probable for that kind of

892
00:57:23.429 --> 00:57:26.409
thing, that kind of thing that it is. So,

893
00:57:26.419 --> 00:57:28.580
yeah, I think I'm not quite sure what a

894
00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:32.469
virus would, um, the virus would not plan. Um

895
00:57:32.679 --> 00:57:36.959
So it's certainly biotic. Is it an agent? Is

896
00:57:36.969 --> 00:57:42.189
a thermostat agent? Um You know, probably not.

897
00:57:42.699 --> 00:57:46.909
So earlier, we've talked about the need to reduce

898
00:57:46.919 --> 00:57:51.120
prediction errors. And in your work, you talk about

899
00:57:51.129 --> 00:57:56.050
existential imperative. So what is an existential imperative in

900
00:57:56.159 --> 00:57:59.159
this particular context? What does that mean?

901
00:58:00.239 --> 00:58:06.449
Um It's just another way of um putting a

902
00:58:06.459 --> 00:58:10.939
teleology, a theological understanding or description on the physics

903
00:58:10.949 --> 00:58:15.020
backstory. So um in the same way that you

904
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:19.530
can describe the behavior of anything in terms of

905
00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:23.439
self evidencing which we rehearsed in terms of gathering

906
00:58:23.449 --> 00:58:27.409
evidence from my model of the world, um existential

907
00:58:27.419 --> 00:58:30.870
imperatives are what it would look like to be

908
00:58:30.879 --> 00:58:35.429
something. So the free energy principle actually turns this

909
00:58:35.439 --> 00:58:38.199
on its head and says, if you exist in

910
00:58:38.209 --> 00:58:42.729
the sense of possessing a markoff blanket which itself

911
00:58:42.739 --> 00:58:47.139
implies or entails a set of attracting or characteristic

912
00:58:47.149 --> 00:58:49.969
states, that is the gerit model that is the

913
00:58:49.979 --> 00:58:53.719
pullback attractor when described um oh sorry, that is

914
00:58:53.729 --> 00:58:57.560
the pullback attract tractor that when described probabilistically is

915
00:58:57.570 --> 00:59:02.379
the gerit model. That means if you exist, you

916
00:59:02.389 --> 00:59:06.830
will um look as if you are conforming to

917
00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.820
certain imperatives, namely minimizing your prediction error or your

918
00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:16.080
free energy. So this the minimization of free energy

919
00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:19.989
is a consequence of existing I exist. Therefore, I

920
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.139
can be described as thinking and inferring and perceiving

921
00:59:24.149 --> 00:59:28.429
and acting. Um But you can sort of turn

922
00:59:28.439 --> 00:59:30.899
that on its head and say if you wanted

923
00:59:30.909 --> 00:59:33.429
to, you are licensed to tell a much more

924
00:59:33.469 --> 00:59:39.379
theological function story now to exist. I must infer

925
00:59:39.389 --> 00:59:41.969
I must perceive and act. I must have a

926
00:59:41.979 --> 00:59:45.120
generative model of my lived world in order to

927
00:59:45.129 --> 00:59:50.139
act sensibly in that world. So that's the um

928
00:59:50.149 --> 00:59:53.780
the genesis of the existential imperative that if I

929
00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:58.419
do not uh minimize my free energy, then I

930
00:59:58.429 --> 01:00:02.489
cannot exist. It's a slight of hand, it's, it's,

931
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.570
it's slightly cheeky because the physics. So the other

932
01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.620
way around the physics says that if you exist,

933
01:00:10.189 --> 01:00:14.449
um then you can always be described as minimizing

934
01:00:14.459 --> 01:00:17.179
uh of conforming to the looking as if you

935
01:00:17.189 --> 01:00:19.790
are minimizing your free energy. So that means you

936
01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.389
can be described as if you like optimizing something

937
01:00:23.399 --> 01:00:28.810
extremis something complying with a principle of least action

938
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:32.010
which means that you can, it looks as if

939
01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.875
you are complying with it to minimize um you

940
01:00:35.885 --> 01:00:38.614
know, to minimize your free energy. Uh JU just

941
01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:40.844
for um people who are not familiar with the

942
01:00:40.854 --> 01:00:44.895
principle of least action action here um as in

943
01:00:44.925 --> 01:00:49.675
um is read as time times free energy. Um

944
01:00:49.824 --> 01:00:53.735
So it's, it's, it's uh technically, it's the area

945
01:00:53.745 --> 01:00:56.314
under the curve as you move forward in time.

946
01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.739
But the ba mechanics just is a principle of

947
01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.360
least action in exactly the same way that Hamilton's

948
01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:05.620
principle of least action just describes the motion of

949
01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:11.600
massive bodies. All we're doing here is describing the

950
01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:15.050
motion or the dynamics of internal states in terms

951
01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:18.500
of them holding beliefs about external states and then

952
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:21.340
acting upon. It's the exactly the same kind of

953
01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:23.050
maths. Mhm.

954
01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:25.530
So I would like to get now a little

955
01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:29.229
bit more into nervous systems and the brain. But

956
01:01:29.239 --> 01:01:32.949
there's another concept that you touched on briefly earlier

957
01:01:32.959 --> 01:01:35.760
that I think it's important for you to explain

958
01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:38.379
a bit better just for people to understand what

959
01:01:38.389 --> 01:01:41.040
we're going to talk about here. So what is

960
01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:46.330
self-organization and specifically biological self-organization?

961
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:54.040
Well, self organization um is a term U usually

962
01:01:54.050 --> 01:02:01.409
used um by um physicists to describe um uh

963
01:02:01.419 --> 01:02:06.370
how systems, how the dynamics of systems bring about

964
01:02:06.379 --> 01:02:11.290
particular states. Um And it's effectively what we have

965
01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.219
just been talking about. I mean, I've slipped in

966
01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:18.429
some technical words like pullback tractors. Um um So

967
01:02:18.439 --> 01:02:23.760
you want to understand the physics or more specifically

968
01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:30.639
the mechanics um behind um the uh propensity or

969
01:02:30.649 --> 01:02:33.080
the existence of certain systems that seem to be

970
01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:36.600
drawn to, you know, to certain attracting states. So

971
01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:40.360
the simplest example of that is uh equilibrium physics,

972
01:02:40.379 --> 01:02:42.679
you know, why is it that things cool down,

973
01:02:42.689 --> 01:02:45.560
you know, why is it that you can um

974
01:02:45.899 --> 01:02:48.780
why do we have the second law? Um YOU

975
01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:53.280
know, what, why do things settle to a free

976
01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:56.179
energy minimum when isolated from the world, when, when

977
01:02:56.189 --> 01:03:00.179
they, when they're closed systems. So the physics of

978
01:03:00.189 --> 01:03:04.120
closed systems is just a way of writing down

979
01:03:04.389 --> 01:03:07.899
the physics or the laws, literally, you know, the

980
01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:12.419
equations of motion of states that describe the behavior

981
01:03:12.429 --> 01:03:14.659
of things that are isolated and they just settle

982
01:03:14.669 --> 01:03:18.969
down to the, the lowest energy point. Um uh

983
01:03:19.909 --> 01:03:24.600
One when one moves um to systems that are

984
01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:29.090
now open, that also now induces the circular causality

985
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:32.530
you're picking up on before. Then one now moves

986
01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:36.820
to self-organization the context of non equilibrium. So non

987
01:03:36.899 --> 01:03:41.679
equilibrium physics because there are no equilibria anymore because,

988
01:03:41.689 --> 01:03:44.760
you know, because of this circular causality and then

989
01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:48.360
one, what, what one is aspiring to understand is

990
01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:52.350
the um the ability or the existence of certain

991
01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.040
systems that have um what can be described as

992
01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:59.840
a non equilibrium steady state, which is just a

993
01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:02.409
way of saying that, you know, if I wait

994
01:04:02.419 --> 01:04:07.689
long enough, um my system will confine itself to

995
01:04:07.699 --> 01:04:11.149
a set of characteristic states. Um And it will

996
01:04:11.159 --> 01:04:13.449
never leave those states. So do so just, you

997
01:04:13.459 --> 01:04:18.439
know, probabilistically or um um very sporadically, that's the

998
01:04:18.449 --> 01:04:22.219
attracting set, that's the pullback attractor. So you want

999
01:04:22.229 --> 01:04:26.040
to understand how do things converge upon their, their

1000
01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:30.790
attracting uh states, their characteristic states and characteristic states

1001
01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.169
here is just a euphemism for um being a

1002
01:04:35.179 --> 01:04:38.739
member of this attracting set that is characteristic of

1003
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:40.229
me. And you can actually score it with a

1004
01:04:40.239 --> 01:04:45.300
characteristic function. The characteristic function is one if, if

1005
01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:47.879
uh I'm in one of my characteristic states and

1006
01:04:47.889 --> 01:04:50.090
zero, if I'm not, if I'm, you know, long

1007
01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:54.229
temperature or um in two pieces or um or

1008
01:04:54.239 --> 01:04:58.780
anything else that would be inconsistent um and violate

1009
01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:04.800
those existential imperatives. So, self-organization, you know, it is

1010
01:05:04.810 --> 01:05:08.830
an umbrella term to, that starts to get really

1011
01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:15.179
um interesting certainly in physics, when you're talking about

1012
01:05:15.219 --> 01:05:18.659
non uh non equilibria and open systems,

1013
01:05:19.379 --> 01:05:23.300
and how does it apply specifically in the case

1014
01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:26.699
of nervous systems? What does it mean for a

1015
01:05:26.709 --> 01:05:29.820
nervous system to be self organizing?

1016
01:05:30.489 --> 01:05:34.090
Well, self-organization, strictly speaking, um can be applied to

1017
01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:37.030
any system that possesses this characteristic based. But of

1018
01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.830
course, the most interesting for people like you and

1019
01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.889
me is, is is the nervous system. Um BUT

1020
01:05:41.899 --> 01:05:44.110
you know, the principles should be exactly the same.

1021
01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:51.889
Um So the self-organization um um usually um is

1022
01:05:51.899 --> 01:05:56.939
manifest at a number of different scales. Um And

1023
01:05:56.949 --> 01:06:01.449
at each scale, you're basically looking for an explanation

1024
01:06:01.459 --> 01:06:03.590
which um from the point of view of the

1025
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.729
Free engine principle is a minimization of free energy,

1026
01:06:06.739 --> 01:06:09.929
but at different scales. So at a very fast

1027
01:06:09.939 --> 01:06:12.419
scale, well, actually, now let's start off with a

1028
01:06:12.429 --> 01:06:15.850
very large uh large scales and then sort of

1029
01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:19.219
winnow down. So at the, you know, at an

1030
01:06:19.229 --> 01:06:24.570
evolutionary timescale, we are now looking for processes, self-organizing

1031
01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:28.800
processes uh where the where speciation is you know,

1032
01:06:28.929 --> 01:06:33.000
uh a self organizing uh phenomena at the level

1033
01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:38.649
of evolution itself. Um AND you know, things like

1034
01:06:38.659 --> 01:06:41.830
adaptive fitness and indeed, the definition of the species

1035
01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:46.810
entails a persistence over time with characteristic states, characteristic

1036
01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:50.560
pheno states. So what kind of basing mechanics would

1037
01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:54.120
you be looking at if you were applying the

1038
01:06:54.129 --> 01:06:57.000
free energy principle? Well, you'd be looking at those

1039
01:06:57.010 --> 01:07:00.489
free energy minimizing processes that have this uh notion

1040
01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:03.629
of selecting the good phenotypes that are a good

1041
01:07:03.639 --> 01:07:08.000
match minimum prediction error with their environment. Um In

1042
01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:11.070
statistics, this is known as Bayesian model selection. So

1043
01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:15.020
selecting a number of different generative models, which we

1044
01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:17.879
can now read as the phenotype. So, before I

1045
01:07:17.889 --> 01:07:20.600
am my genitive model, I am seeking evidence from

1046
01:07:20.610 --> 01:07:23.419
my own existence because I am seeking evidence from

1047
01:07:23.429 --> 01:07:27.110
my model and I am my model. So now

1048
01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:31.340
I can label each phenotype each uh each baby

1049
01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.040
um uh uh um as a model and I

1050
01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:39.120
can score the adaptive fitness of that model in

1051
01:07:39.129 --> 01:07:43.159
terms of um that baby's um well, that over

1052
01:07:43.169 --> 01:07:46.320
the lifetime, um we can take the uh the

1053
01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:48.489
free energy over the lifetime or the pathogen or

1054
01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:51.679
the free action um and that would be adaptive

1055
01:07:51.689 --> 01:07:55.959
fitness. So now we've got be model selection now

1056
01:07:55.969 --> 01:08:00.350
is just natural selection. So evolution is nature's way

1057
01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.989
of doing be model selection to select the free

1058
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
engine minimizing generative model with her Markov blanket. That

1059
01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:11.070
is the phenotype. What does that mean from the

1060
01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.969
point of view of neurodevelopment at a slightly sort

1061
01:08:13.979 --> 01:08:16.879
of faster time scale. Well, it means that the

1062
01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:19.899
model that I've inherited from my genotype of my

1063
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:24.220
parents and this basic model selection of, you know,

1064
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:30.950
over millennia means that I can now um learn

1065
01:08:30.959 --> 01:08:35.160
my environment quickly and efficiently in an adaptive way

1066
01:08:35.169 --> 01:08:38.270
in a free and minimizing way. Also, it means

1067
01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:42.009
that my environment is actually built to be learnable.

1068
01:08:42.529 --> 01:08:45.810
So the self-organization that you'd expect to see during

1069
01:08:45.819 --> 01:08:50.609
um uh neurodevelopment um say development of the brain

1070
01:08:50.899 --> 01:08:55.000
in um in utron then crucially during early developmental

1071
01:08:55.009 --> 01:09:00.359
periods is basically a um a selection of the

1072
01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:04.959
neuronal elements and systems and connectivity. The connectome um

1073
01:09:05.129 --> 01:09:10.709
that is fit for purpose to um to provide

1074
01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.250
a good generative model of this phenotype of this

1075
01:09:15.259 --> 01:09:19.520
infant's world where this world is carefully crafted by

1076
01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:22.830
the mother by school, you know, by carers um

1077
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.790
by teachers to make it as learnable as possible.

1078
01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:29.500
And then you'd be asking uh if you're a

1079
01:09:29.509 --> 01:09:32.140
neurobiologist, what are the mechanisms of this? Well, there

1080
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:36.740
are all sorts of um um um levels on

1081
01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:39.680
which you can study this sort of epigen specification

1082
01:09:39.689 --> 01:09:44.979
and of neurodevelopment right through to experience dependent plasticity

1083
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:49.359
where neurons or brain cells that wi together fire

1084
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:53.479
together. This itself is a free energy minimizing process.

1085
01:09:54.149 --> 01:10:02.410
It's also known as heavy plasticity and effectively the

1086
01:10:02.419 --> 01:10:06.479
the connectivity as it grows. Well, interestingly, in fact,

1087
01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:09.000
we're usually born with too many connections. It's a

1088
01:10:09.009 --> 01:10:11.850
bit like being a large language model that we

1089
01:10:11.859 --> 01:10:14.270
have to actually prove. So it's actually a question

1090
01:10:14.279 --> 01:10:17.049
of the right level of sparsity. So we actually

1091
01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:20.575
lose redundant connections as we grow up and become

1092
01:10:20.584 --> 01:10:23.865
old and wise and sparse in our uh our

1093
01:10:23.875 --> 01:10:27.794
much simpler and more efficient uh generative model. But

1094
01:10:27.975 --> 01:10:31.524
um irrespective of that, um all of this can

1095
01:10:31.535 --> 01:10:35.654
be written down as uh effectively learning in exactly

1096
01:10:35.665 --> 01:10:38.365
the same way that machine learning uses recurrent neural

1097
01:10:38.375 --> 01:10:43.560
networks to um um identify the the best weights

1098
01:10:43.569 --> 01:10:47.009
that the best explain the content to which this

1099
01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:53.020
um um recurrent ne network was exposed. Uh For

1100
01:10:53.029 --> 01:10:56.060
example, for, you know, for example, a large language

1101
01:10:56.069 --> 01:11:00.089
model. So this will be plasticity of a developmental

1102
01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:03.939
sort but also experience dependent plasticity um that we

1103
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:06.200
still enjoy today, we, we can still learn to

1104
01:11:06.209 --> 01:11:07.959
drive a car when we're quite old or you

1105
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:10.279
can now go off and learn a new sport

1106
01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:12.270
or you could run away from fires in a,

1107
01:11:12.279 --> 01:11:14.750
in a way that you've never, never done before.

1108
01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:17.080
Um So we, you know, we still have this

1109
01:11:17.089 --> 01:11:20.629
capacity to learn. Um And we also have the

1110
01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.450
capacity to revise the very structure of our models

1111
01:11:24.459 --> 01:11:29.669
of the kind that is um prescribed epigenetic at

1112
01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.450
birth. Uh You know, when we go to sleep

1113
01:11:32.459 --> 01:11:35.189
at night, for example, you know, we are eliminating

1114
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:39.569
certain synaptic connections that are redundant that have accumulated

1115
01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:42.750
through experience dependent during the day. So this is

1116
01:11:42.759 --> 01:11:47.569
self organ organization over a timescale of years, developmentally

1117
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:51.140
um days, in terms of the sleep wake cycle

1118
01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:53.430
and hours, in terms of learning a new skill,

1119
01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:57.229
and then we go to um a faster um

1120
01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:03.189
um uh level of um self-organization um which um

1121
01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.410
would be um framed now, not in terms of

1122
01:12:06.419 --> 01:12:10.600
hours, but in terms of milliseconds and seconds. And

1123
01:12:10.609 --> 01:12:13.990
this would be the kind of self-organization that would

1124
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.669
be appropriate for describing the dynamics, not neuroplasticity, not

1125
01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.490
the efficacy of the strength of neural connections, but

1126
01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:25.200
the actual activity, the neural activity, the dynamics themselves,

1127
01:12:25.209 --> 01:12:27.709
the amount to which brain cells are spiking or

1128
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.540
shouting or trying to influence each other through message

1129
01:12:31.549 --> 01:12:36.180
passing and depolarization events. And this is the inference

1130
01:12:36.189 --> 01:12:38.910
part, this is the perception and the active part.

1131
01:12:39.609 --> 01:12:42.069
So what is this kind of self organization? Well,

1132
01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.520
we've just said it's neuronal dynamics that have, that

1133
01:12:45.529 --> 01:12:48.419
can be described in terms of space mechanics that

1134
01:12:48.479 --> 01:12:51.470
can be read as perception of action, changing your

1135
01:12:51.479 --> 01:12:55.540
mind in the moment to predict accommodate and to

1136
01:12:55.549 --> 01:13:00.140
realize predictions about the sensorium given the way that

1137
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:02.660
you are sampling your sensorium. And then you get

1138
01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:05.520
into the world of cold in neuroscience, even rated

1139
01:13:05.529 --> 01:13:09.319
potentials and things that change very, very quickly. So

1140
01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:13.410
we've moved away from learning and ethology um into

1141
01:13:13.419 --> 01:13:18.649
the world of self-organization over milliseconds. There's an interesting

1142
01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:22.169
intermediate scale which I just slip in. Um WHICH

1143
01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.770
I think makes us um intelligent and, and cognitive,

1144
01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:29.709
which is uh being able to recognize the context

1145
01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:34.910
um in further context you are in and make

1146
01:13:34.919 --> 01:13:39.029
short term adjustments to the connectivity that it has

1147
01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.330
been learned. Um And this is often framed in

1148
01:13:42.339 --> 01:13:48.220
terms of representation of uncertainty or confidence or precision

1149
01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:52.580
ascribed to different sources of evidence in psychology. It

1150
01:13:52.589 --> 01:13:57.990
would be attention. Um um um So this is

1151
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.310
not actually recognizing or inferring the particular content at

1152
01:14:03.319 --> 01:14:06.040
the moment or in the future, but the context

1153
01:14:06.049 --> 01:14:10.850
in which the ability that your brain has to

1154
01:14:10.859 --> 01:14:14.640
recognize you're in the dark and therefore make appropriate

1155
01:14:14.649 --> 01:14:19.609
adjustments in terms of pupillary dilatation. Um um um

1156
01:14:19.759 --> 01:14:23.500
SORT of, you know, adapt your photoreceptors uh in

1157
01:14:23.509 --> 01:14:27.430
a way that knows that there's a different dynamic

1158
01:14:27.439 --> 01:14:30.419
range range at hand. So being in the dark

1159
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:33.729
provides a context that outlives in time, the very

1160
01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:37.069
fast sense making they get from say visually avert

1161
01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:40.629
responses. I mentioned that because that's quite important, attention

1162
01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:44.209
is quite important when it comes to talking about

1163
01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:49.439
things like sentience and phenomenal experience and possibly mental

1164
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:53.700
action. Because if you've got the ability to recognize

1165
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:56.479
the context in which you are making sense, it

1166
01:14:56.490 --> 01:14:58.350
may be that a higher level of the brain

1167
01:14:58.359 --> 01:15:02.419
in this deep architecture is able to now act

1168
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:06.250
upon lower levels to say it's in this context,

1169
01:15:06.259 --> 01:15:08.720
you're making you're doing your predictive coding or it's

1170
01:15:08.729 --> 01:15:11.020
in that context. And now you've got the notion

1171
01:15:11.029 --> 01:15:14.500
of action on the inside, not just through moving

1172
01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:17.819
your bodies. And that mental action, which I repeat,

1173
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:23.729
it could be just optimizing or seen as optimizing

1174
01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.759
your intentional set or in the active domain, your

1175
01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:30.229
intentional set may be an important if you like

1176
01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:34.700
facility that thermostats don't have and possibly insects don't

1177
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:37.319
have it. Certainly, you and I have this sort

1178
01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:42.270
of, um, fast but not very fast. Um, SCALE

1179
01:15:42.279 --> 01:15:46.569
of self organization, coordinating things in, you know, 300

1180
01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:49.129
milliseconds through to several seconds, for example.

1181
01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:54.359
Mhm And still on the topic of nervous systems

1182
01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:58.399
and the brain more specifically, uh earlier, you mentioned

1183
01:15:58.410 --> 01:16:01.180
another concept that I said, I would need to

1184
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:05.240
ask you more about what is hierarchy in this

1185
01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:07.640
context. What does it mean for the brain to

1186
01:16:07.649 --> 01:16:09.319
be hierarchical?

1187
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:13.919
Right? So again, that's an excellent question. So um

1188
01:16:14.919 --> 01:16:22.209
hierarchy um simply means um that there are separable

1189
01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:27.799
levels or scales of some thing and implicitly lots

1190
01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:30.990
of things because there's things at every scale. Um

1191
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:34.810
So, from the point of view of a physicist,

1192
01:16:35.259 --> 01:16:39.390
uh there's another kind of circular causality which you'll

1193
01:16:39.399 --> 01:16:43.180
find in um non equilibrium physics. And in particular,

1194
01:16:43.459 --> 01:16:47.720
um the uh synergetics of, of the sort that

1195
01:16:47.729 --> 01:16:50.709
Herman Hagen is famous for was, was, was famous

1196
01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:57.299
for um he unfortunately died very recently. Um So

1197
01:16:57.310 --> 01:17:02.180
this circular causality is a circular causality between scales.

1198
01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:04.189
And you think of this as a sort of

1199
01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:08.069
a hierarchical ladder So the hierarchy very much as

1200
01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:11.169
in an organization or in a caste system means

1201
01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:13.620
that there is a certain ordering. So you can

1202
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.410
be low in the hierarchy or high in the

1203
01:17:16.419 --> 01:17:24.220
hierarchy. Um And this hierarchical structure always exists in

1204
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:28.959
the universe. Um SIMPLY because you can take small

1205
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:33.500
fast fluctuations at any given scale and take the

1206
01:17:33.509 --> 01:17:38.129
averages of these. And then what happens is that

1207
01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:40.569
the fast stuff gets averaged away, you're left with

1208
01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:44.419
slightly slower, larger scale things. So you've got a

1209
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:47.229
representation of the fast stuff at the lowest, at

1210
01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.189
any given level. And then at the higher level

1211
01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:55.569
there, um things slow down. There are um they

1212
01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:01.520
are if you like um caused by or subtended

1213
01:18:01.529 --> 01:18:05.450
by the fasting simply because the fast things are

1214
01:18:06.779 --> 01:18:11.240
um uh added together to create the slow things.

1215
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:15.759
So um um but at the same time, the

1216
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:19.430
slow things provide a context for the fast things.

1217
01:18:19.649 --> 01:18:23.549
And this is the kind of circular causality um

1218
01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:29.290
celebrated in synergetics. And that providing the context means

1219
01:18:29.299 --> 01:18:32.700
that you can write down mathematically akin to things

1220
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:36.279
like the center manifold theorem. Um A notion that

1221
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:40.540
the slow things at the higher scale enslave the

1222
01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:44.109
fast fluctuations to particular manifolds on which the slow

1223
01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:49.129
things operate. Um And, and you repeat that you

1224
01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:51.680
can rinse swash and repeat. Now you've got the

1225
01:18:51.689 --> 01:18:53.740
slow things that can be averaged to make even

1226
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:56.669
slower things. And if it is a case as

1227
01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:59.930
it probably is. Um AND certainly from the point

1228
01:18:59.939 --> 01:19:02.810
of view that the energy it is relatively easy

1229
01:19:02.819 --> 01:19:05.290
to show it is the case uh if it

1230
01:19:05.299 --> 01:19:09.399
is the case that the dynamics, uh the functional

1231
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:12.830
form of the dynamics expressed as a Lagrangian or

1232
01:19:12.839 --> 01:19:16.879
in terms of the equations of motion are conserved

1233
01:19:16.890 --> 01:19:20.319
over scales with different scaling properties. But you know,

1234
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:22.060
the functional forms the same you have what they

1235
01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:25.350
call the renormalization group. So what that means is

1236
01:19:25.359 --> 01:19:30.620
that the world out there has this hierarchical structure

1237
01:19:30.959 --> 01:19:34.740
where slow things contextualize and enslave fast things and

1238
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:39.620
the fast things effectively um are coarse grained in

1239
01:19:39.629 --> 01:19:43.500
order to summarize and create the slow things. So

1240
01:19:43.509 --> 01:19:47.620
this is a circular causality that um that emerges

1241
01:19:47.629 --> 01:19:51.259
from the slaving principle in physics. Why is that

1242
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:55.580
interesting? Well, remember before, the free energy principle says

1243
01:19:55.589 --> 01:19:58.810
that um an existential imperative is to have a

1244
01:19:58.819 --> 01:20:03.319
good uh um narrative model of your lived world.

1245
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:06.959
Um And by good, it just basically means that

1246
01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:09.990
the probability of the data being provided by of

1247
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.600
the sensory input being provided by this world is

1248
01:20:12.609 --> 01:20:14.770
very high on your model, which means that you

1249
01:20:14.779 --> 01:20:16.629
have to have a good model of the world

1250
01:20:16.899 --> 01:20:21.959
because I'm using that expression um with a nod

1251
01:20:21.970 --> 01:20:24.919
to an acknowledgment of things like the good regulator

1252
01:20:24.930 --> 01:20:29.069
theorem and the law of requisite variety that was

1253
01:20:29.359 --> 01:20:33.439
established in the early days of cybernetics. And what

1254
01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:36.669
this basically says is that if I am in

1255
01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:39.169
an open exchange with my environment. And if I

1256
01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:42.220
could control and measure, if I can act upon

1257
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:47.509
and sense my environment um in the language of

1258
01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.060
the good regulator there, if I can regulate this

1259
01:20:50.069 --> 01:20:53.220
environment, then I have to be a good model

1260
01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:56.919
of that environment. So this is just another statement

1261
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:59.169
of the free energy principle. In the sense that

1262
01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:01.649
um um to be a good model means that

1263
01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:04.279
my model evidence is very high. And if I

1264
01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:08.240
maximize my model evidence, I'm imply minimizing my surprise

1265
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:11.879
or, or my free energy. Um But we've said

1266
01:21:11.890 --> 01:21:15.529
that the world has to have a hierarchical structure,

1267
01:21:15.759 --> 01:21:18.129
which means that my brain as a good model

1268
01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:20.850
of this world has to have a hierarchical structure.

1269
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:23.540
So, what would that look like? Well, it would

1270
01:21:23.549 --> 01:21:27.830
look like um effectively bits of the brain sitting

1271
01:21:27.839 --> 01:21:30.750
very close to the sensory input, responding very, very

1272
01:21:30.759 --> 01:21:34.310
quickly um to what's going on. And then there

1273
01:21:34.319 --> 01:21:37.430
would be a level above it, a level above

1274
01:21:37.439 --> 01:21:40.229
another part of the brain, a brain system that's

1275
01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:43.229
looking at the level below as if it was

1276
01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:45.839
the Sensorium as if it was a sensory interface,

1277
01:21:45.850 --> 01:21:49.189
as if it was the Markov blanket. And indeed,

1278
01:21:50.279 --> 01:21:54.240
and then you've got a third level or scale

1279
01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:58.500
that's looking at the second level. Um And it's

1280
01:21:58.509 --> 01:22:01.930
enacting in this um in the spirit of the

1281
01:22:01.939 --> 01:22:04.629
renormalization group, it's doing exactly the same thing. In

1282
01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.959
fact, it's doing predicted coding, which is minimizing free

1283
01:22:06.970 --> 01:22:09.600
energy that that is the, the Lagrange in this

1284
01:22:09.609 --> 01:22:13.149
instance. Um uh And so that gives you a

1285
01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:16.029
view of the, of the brain as basically layer

1286
01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.470
upon layer, very much like that onion analogy. Uh

1287
01:22:18.479 --> 01:22:21.689
We had before where each layer is trying to

1288
01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:26.310
make sense of the layer towards the outside, the

1289
01:22:26.319 --> 01:22:29.500
lower layer, the layer or the level that is

1290
01:22:29.509 --> 01:22:34.270
closer to the fast sensory fluctuations that are provided

1291
01:22:34.279 --> 01:22:38.879
by vision or hearing or interception and making sense

1292
01:22:38.890 --> 01:22:44.470
of means um being able to predict um um

1293
01:22:45.379 --> 01:22:49.350
vertically and simply um um in the, in the

1294
01:22:49.359 --> 01:22:53.310
spirit of minimizing or maximizing model evidence or minimizing

1295
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:57.870
um free energy. Um And that basically can always

1296
01:22:57.879 --> 01:23:02.569
be read as providing a simple account that is

1297
01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:05.770
accurate of what's going on at the level below.

1298
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:09.129
Uh And I use that language because um the

1299
01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:12.089
simplicity is important here um in the sense that

1300
01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.609
the model evidence, the, well, let's put it the

1301
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:17.810
other way, the free energy can always be expressed

1302
01:23:17.819 --> 01:23:21.149
as complexity minus accuracy. So if I want to

1303
01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:25.919
minimize my free energy or maximize my model evidence

1304
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:29.279
or minimize my prediction error or minimize my surprise,

1305
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:34.649
I'm effectively trying to find the minimally complex explanation

1306
01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:37.390
that retains an accurate account. So I'm always trying

1307
01:23:37.399 --> 01:23:40.120
to simplify, I'm always trying to compress, I'm always

1308
01:23:40.129 --> 01:23:43.700
trying to dimension reduce, I'm always trying to summarize

1309
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:49.439
coarse grain without losing accuracy. So it's lossy compression,

1310
01:23:49.450 --> 01:23:53.229
but the least lossy in terms of the amount

1311
01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.709
of information. So this notion of compression is really

1312
01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:59.250
important because this is where um a lot of

1313
01:23:59.259 --> 01:24:04.509
people think about um uh the the existential imperatives

1314
01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.390
can also be seen not as minimizing prediction, but

1315
01:24:07.399 --> 01:24:11.540
just by compressing. Uh JUST arac in coarse brain

1316
01:24:11.549 --> 01:24:14.629
away what really matters in describing what's really going

1317
01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:19.629
on and increasingly longer and larger spatial scales. So

1318
01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.709
as you send the hierarchy in the brain, as

1319
01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:24.430
you move deeper into the brain, in terms of

1320
01:24:24.439 --> 01:24:28.520
this anion analogy, then you see more of the

1321
01:24:28.529 --> 01:24:32.600
surface. Um So, you know, after a certain uh

1322
01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:35.589
uh after a certain depth, there will be brain

1323
01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:38.890
systems that are multimodal, they will be receiving say

1324
01:24:38.899 --> 01:24:42.609
prediction errors from the visual brain, from the hearing

1325
01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:45.390
brain from the intercepted brain from the, you know,

1326
01:24:45.399 --> 01:24:48.810
the proceed brain, they will be multimodal, they will

1327
01:24:48.819 --> 01:24:53.330
be a modal, they will be domain general. And

1328
01:24:53.339 --> 01:24:57.859
furthermore, because this scaling as um as we were

1329
01:24:57.870 --> 01:25:03.470
emphasizing when describing the slaving principle, um the the

1330
01:25:03.479 --> 01:25:07.020
the compression will be into slower and slower narratives.

1331
01:25:07.319 --> 01:25:10.580
So receptive fields inside the visual cortex in the

1332
01:25:10.589 --> 01:25:12.689
back of the brain at the very the very

1333
01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:18.540
lowest hierarchical level, um the one primary visual cortex,

1334
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:21.529
they just see a very small part of the

1335
01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:24.069
visual scene and they, you know, and they respond

1336
01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:29.200
to very little transient changes, little bars and you

1337
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:31.955
know, very, very quickly. Um And if you go

1338
01:25:31.964 --> 01:25:33.805
right down to the brain stem. You know, you're

1339
01:25:33.814 --> 01:25:40.845
talking about very fast processing in less than less

1340
01:25:40.854 --> 01:25:44.254
than 100 100 milliseconds. But as you get out,

1341
01:25:44.265 --> 01:25:48.895
say to the prefrontal cortex or intermediately parietal cortex,

1342
01:25:49.075 --> 01:25:53.625
then things you start to get notions of things

1343
01:25:53.634 --> 01:25:57.290
moving visual motion, which means that something has to

1344
01:25:57.299 --> 01:25:59.220
move for a period of time before you can

1345
01:25:59.229 --> 01:26:02.020
actually estimate, you know how fast this thing is

1346
01:26:02.029 --> 01:26:04.140
moving. Is it a bird or is it an

1347
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:08.649
airplane? Meaning that the spatial temporal receptive fields increase

1348
01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:12.040
in size crucially in time as well. So you

1349
01:26:12.049 --> 01:26:14.649
might argue that when you get to very high

1350
01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:20.919
levels, say hippocampus, you've got whole narratives lasting encoding,

1351
01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:23.890
you know where I've been and where I'm going,

1352
01:26:23.899 --> 01:26:28.759
uh you know, seconds into the future. So this

1353
01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:31.430
would be um yeah. So that would be the

1354
01:26:31.439 --> 01:26:37.750
implication of having a world which has this renormalized

1355
01:26:37.779 --> 01:26:40.140
structure, which it always has to, it has had

1356
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:45.080
different levels of description. Um HOW that hierarchical structure

1357
01:26:45.089 --> 01:26:48.810
gets installed into the neur anatomy of a brain

1358
01:26:49.149 --> 01:26:57.660
that has this increasingly deep, slow compressed representation of

1359
01:26:58.399 --> 01:27:04.089
a narrative self that transcends any given moment. So

1360
01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:08.140
there is no present. We are just representing things

1361
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:11.049
that are unfolding very, very, very slowly. So perhaps

1362
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:14.129
language is a good example here, the primary auditory

1363
01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:18.350
cortex will be perfectly attuned and respond to a

1364
01:27:18.359 --> 01:27:21.470
particular frequency glide. Then there will be sort of

1365
01:27:21.479 --> 01:27:26.020
per Aitor cortices that may respond to phones the

1366
01:27:26.029 --> 01:27:28.839
the the higher levels that may start responding to

1367
01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:31.850
the words and the lexical structure of words, there

1368
01:27:31.859 --> 01:27:35.290
will be higher levels that actually look over increasing

1369
01:27:35.299 --> 01:27:39.399
numbers uh periods, extended periods of time and start

1370
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:43.750
to look at the, the, the put semantics in

1371
01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:46.645
the con of syntax. And then you have higher

1372
01:27:46.654 --> 01:27:52.944
levels that have, you know, representing the narrative. And

1373
01:27:52.955 --> 01:27:56.015
then the genre of the book say that you're

1374
01:27:56.024 --> 01:28:00.294
reading. So each level you're moving up same principles

1375
01:28:00.305 --> 01:28:02.694
that play out at different different scales.

1376
01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:06.470
So when it comes to studying the brain, we

1377
01:28:06.479 --> 01:28:10.209
have different methodologies, different ways we can do it.

1378
01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:16.359
Like for example, neuroimaging lesion studies, brain stimulation studies,

1379
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:19.549
animal models and so on. Uh I would like

1380
01:28:19.629 --> 01:28:22.870
to start by talking a little bit about neuroimaging

1381
01:28:22.879 --> 01:28:26.049
because that's an area where you've done lots of

1382
01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:29.799
work. So what can we learn about the brain

1383
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:34.569
by studying it through imaging? What are the limitations

1384
01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:35.859
of neuroimaging?

1385
01:28:36.259 --> 01:28:42.970
Um Well, neuroimaging read as brain mapping. Um I

1386
01:28:42.979 --> 01:28:47.430
think is a way of testing hypotheses about functional

1387
01:28:47.439 --> 01:28:50.290
brain architectures. And we've just been, we've spent, you

1388
01:28:50.299 --> 01:28:53.350
know, 20 minutes talking about some really important aspects

1389
01:28:53.359 --> 01:28:56.830
of, of, of, of functional brain architectures. Um But

1390
01:28:56.839 --> 01:28:59.919
as we said, at the beginning, uh I can't

1391
01:28:59.930 --> 01:29:03.209
peer beneath your Markov blanket without breaking you. So

1392
01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:05.319
if your Markov blanket goes away, you're no longer

1393
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:08.529
you. Um So that, that, that, that presents an

1394
01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:10.939
interesting problem if I want to understand how I

1395
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:14.640
work. I can't use my own brain because if

1396
01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:18.379
I use my own brain, it, um I will

1397
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:21.129
disturb all the perception and action that underwrites me,

1398
01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:23.520
trying to understand and experiment my own. But I

1399
01:29:23.529 --> 01:29:25.939
could study your brain. But can I? Well, no,

1400
01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:30.560
I can't. Well, perhaps I could study um things

1401
01:29:30.569 --> 01:29:34.850
like your brain. Uh Perhaps I could study um

1402
01:29:35.279 --> 01:29:38.990
the uh the brain um of uh your um

1403
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.459
great grandparents after they died and I could do

1404
01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:45.819
some neuron after and dissect dead dead brains. Um

1405
01:29:46.279 --> 01:29:48.250
So that would be, you know, if you just

1406
01:29:48.259 --> 01:29:51.899
look at the history of neuroscience, it all starts

1407
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:55.589
with dissecting dead ones where the thing doesn't exist

1408
01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:58.370
anymore. So its Marko blanket has disappeared and you

1409
01:29:58.379 --> 01:30:01.279
can intervene as you look at the structure and

1410
01:30:01.290 --> 01:30:06.189
get a lot of insights into the function simply

1411
01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:09.540
by looking at the structure. So just discovering hierarchical

1412
01:30:09.549 --> 01:30:15.129
organizations, just discovering the preponderance of connections in the

1413
01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:17.879
brain. Um So if you just think about that,

1414
01:30:17.890 --> 01:30:19.979
that's interesting from the point of view of that

1415
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:23.580
good regulator theorem. I was saying before, if you

1416
01:30:23.589 --> 01:30:26.709
were able to dissect the brain, you would be

1417
01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.500
amazed that nearly all of it is wire, there

1418
01:30:30.509 --> 01:30:33.310
are, there's only a very small part of it

1419
01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:38.200
mostly on the surface like a cauliflower uh covered

1420
01:30:38.209 --> 01:30:41.740
um with the um you know, the cortex, which

1421
01:30:41.839 --> 01:30:43.680
literally means that, you know, that which is on

1422
01:30:43.689 --> 01:30:45.700
the on the surface which is just a few

1423
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:48.950
millimeters deep. That's where all your brain cells are.

1424
01:30:49.229 --> 01:30:52.540
All the rest of it to a certain approximation

1425
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:57.930
uh is just wiring. Um And that wiring is

1426
01:30:57.959 --> 01:31:02.950
uh um very sparse uh mediated by axons that

1427
01:31:02.959 --> 01:31:07.779
conduct um or have influences over um a whole

1428
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:11.000
range of distances. Um YOU know, uh you know,

1429
01:31:11.009 --> 01:31:14.580
up up to several centimeters um in some instances

1430
01:31:14.589 --> 01:31:17.810
with a, with a certain fasula and they are

1431
01:31:17.819 --> 01:31:20.850
able to conduct with high fidelity and influence other

1432
01:31:20.859 --> 01:31:23.850
neurons by being wrapped in myelin, which is a

1433
01:31:23.859 --> 01:31:28.569
fatty insulator like a cable. And that fatty substance

1434
01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:30.950
looks white. So it's called white matter. So the

1435
01:31:30.959 --> 01:31:34.990
cortex is gray matter, the interior, most of the

1436
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.770
interior of the collectivity is white matter. That is

1437
01:31:37.779 --> 01:31:40.000
interesting because what it means is if you are

1438
01:31:40.009 --> 01:31:45.379
AJ model of your world, then your world basically

1439
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:48.799
must be of the sort where there is action

1440
01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:51.819
at a distance and it is quite sparse, which

1441
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:53.560
is interesting, isn't it? Because by,

1442
01:31:53.569 --> 01:31:56.790
by the way, sorry for interrupting you, what does

1443
01:31:56.799 --> 01:32:01.270
the term sparse or sparsity mean in the context

1444
01:32:01.279 --> 01:32:02.680
of neuroscience?

1445
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:06.450
Um Well, it's used, I think in the same

1446
01:32:06.459 --> 01:32:09.540
context everywhere. It just means that it's, it's it's

1447
01:32:09.549 --> 01:32:17.229
um can be used um us refers to um

1448
01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:24.549
um distributions. So a very sparse distribution um would

1449
01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.890
for example be where there are a very, very

1450
01:32:27.899 --> 01:32:30.430
small number of big things and a large number,

1451
01:32:30.439 --> 01:32:33.430
a very large number of, of, of small things

1452
01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.060
when used in the context of connectivity, which is

1453
01:32:36.069 --> 01:32:38.069
a sense in which we've been using it throughout

1454
01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:43.620
this conversation. Um uh Either in terms of coupling

1455
01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:47.339
in random dynamic systems and causal inferences or in

1456
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:50.129
terms of brain connections that are if you like

1457
01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:55.410
the physical instantiation of those causal causal influences. Um

1458
01:32:55.609 --> 01:32:59.109
Then we're talking about uh we can envisage a

1459
01:32:59.339 --> 01:33:02.729
matrix, a big square with lots of elements where

1460
01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:06.529
there's where there's an entry when one thing is

1461
01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:10.250
connected to another thing. So if everything was connected

1462
01:33:10.259 --> 01:33:15.839
to everything that matrix would be populated with nonzero

1463
01:33:15.850 --> 01:33:18.709
elements everywhere and it would be dense. So it

1464
01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:21.399
would be a non sparse matrix. On the other

1465
01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:26.290
hand, if everything is just connected to one other

1466
01:33:26.299 --> 01:33:28.899
thing, then for every column in that matrix, there

1467
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:32.209
would just be one entry. So although you have

1468
01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:36.089
N squared possible connections, there will only be a

1469
01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:39.189
small number in that particular simple example, just N

1470
01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:42.779
connections. So that's a sparse matrix. So what people

1471
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:46.029
are looking for when they look at connectomes of

1472
01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:49.779
connectivity or adjacency matrix in graph theory they're looking

1473
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:54.060
for um or they expect to see um sparse

1474
01:33:54.069 --> 01:33:58.120
sparse connections. So of all the possible connectivity, only

1475
01:33:58.129 --> 01:34:02.259
a very small number of connections are actually evident

1476
01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:06.850
or or present. So the brain um has, you

1477
01:34:06.859 --> 01:34:10.569
know, billions of neurons. Um So you can imagine

1478
01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:15.209
an enormous big connectivity matrix sometimes calls them called

1479
01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:18.459
an adjacency matrix that I'm next to you. If

1480
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:22.040
I'm connected to you, a massive billion times of

1481
01:34:22.049 --> 01:34:26.160
billions, billions times billions of potential entries. But the

1482
01:34:26.169 --> 01:34:29.899
actual number of connections is a tiny, tiny fraction

1483
01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.259
of all the possible connections. And that's what people

1484
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:36.470
mean when they say spars, people who are experts

1485
01:34:36.479 --> 01:34:42.160
in this field nowadays dubbed connectome say from, in

1486
01:34:42.169 --> 01:34:45.160
terms of the connectivity, the brain is almost empty

1487
01:34:45.450 --> 01:34:47.720
of all the possible ways it could be, you

1488
01:34:47.729 --> 01:34:51.100
know, wires you could have, there's hardly anything there.

1489
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:52.970
And yet, of course, it takes up most of

1490
01:34:52.979 --> 01:34:56.200
the uh the wiring at most of the space.

1491
01:34:56.229 --> 01:35:00.319
So that's what sparsity means. It's an important point

1492
01:35:00.330 --> 01:35:03.470
to pick up on because um you know, again,

1493
01:35:03.479 --> 01:35:09.160
this theme that the brain is or entails the

1494
01:35:09.169 --> 01:35:13.009
model of the lived world, it means that your

1495
01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:18.330
world has very sparse causal structure. And of course,

1496
01:35:18.669 --> 01:35:21.859
that's exactly where we started with the definition of

1497
01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:24.270
things in terms of Markov blankets. So if I

1498
01:35:24.279 --> 01:35:29.689
live in a universe that is constituted by things

1499
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:33.290
that just means I live in a universe with

1500
01:35:33.299 --> 01:35:36.970
lots of Markov blankets at a particular scale, if

1501
01:35:36.979 --> 01:35:38.919
I live in a universe with lots of markup

1502
01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:40.839
blankets at a particular scale, that means it has

1503
01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:45.029
to be sparsely coupled. And if my self-organization in

1504
01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:49.959
terms of synaptic plasticity is a way of learning

1505
01:35:49.970 --> 01:35:52.810
that sparse, you know, where those sparse connections or

1506
01:35:52.819 --> 01:35:57.100
couplings are, that means that my brain should have

1507
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:59.890
a sparse connectivity and it does. So that, that,

1508
01:35:59.899 --> 01:36:02.049
you know, sorry, we wander away from your question

1509
01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:04.359
about brain imaging. But I'm just saying you can

1510
01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:07.629
learn a lot about the anatomy. Yeah, just knowing,

1511
01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:10.700
just being able to dissect a dead brain, it

1512
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:13.600
tells me a lot about the world that this

1513
01:36:13.609 --> 01:36:16.759
brain used to be in and the principles, you

1514
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:19.490
know, and you know, and the scale at which,

1515
01:36:19.509 --> 01:36:22.740
you know, this brain was operating and it also

1516
01:36:22.750 --> 01:36:25.930
tells you about the different modalities. Then he then,

1517
01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:30.209
then he moved to neuropsychology. So, and they, you

1518
01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:33.899
know, af after you had all the famous um

1519
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:39.399
natural scientists um doing that section of dead bodies,

1520
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:43.600
then came along the ability to um do um

1521
01:36:43.979 --> 01:36:47.740
uh lesion experiments on, you know, on animals, for

1522
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:51.120
example, on electrical stimulation experiments. So there's a lot

1523
01:36:51.129 --> 01:36:55.040
of work in the 17th and 18th century um

1524
01:36:55.049 --> 01:37:00.529
asking a really simple question is the brain plural

1525
01:37:00.609 --> 01:37:05.839
potential in the sense that every capacity, perceptual or

1526
01:37:05.850 --> 01:37:13.040
cognitive capacity that we enjoy involves or entails every

1527
01:37:13.049 --> 01:37:17.700
neuron in a distributed fashion or are certain parts

1528
01:37:17.709 --> 01:37:22.500
of the brain specialized for particular functions. So, you

1529
01:37:22.509 --> 01:37:25.060
know, there were sort of uh and this, this

1530
01:37:25.069 --> 01:37:28.640
debate raged even into the 20th century in terms

1531
01:37:28.649 --> 01:37:31.100
of sort of lash's law of mass action, for

1532
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:33.779
example, you know, if I take a little mouse

1533
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:38.040
brain and I just scoop out a thumbnail or

1534
01:37:38.049 --> 01:37:40.600
less, does it matter where I do it in

1535
01:37:40.609 --> 01:37:44.439
terms of what function I have now compromised in

1536
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:48.200
this little animal. Um And one could argue no

1537
01:37:48.209 --> 01:37:51.700
uh that, that it was a bad argument because

1538
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:54.549
it does matter. But yeah, that was, that was

1539
01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.950
what people were trying to understand was there. And

1540
01:37:57.959 --> 01:38:03.000
this uh you know, became known subsequently as um

1541
01:38:03.049 --> 01:38:06.979
the principle of functional specialization or segregation that different

1542
01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:11.450
parts of our brain are specialized for modeling different

1543
01:38:11.459 --> 01:38:14.560
modalities in different parts of the world. Um AND

1544
01:38:14.569 --> 01:38:16.870
different aspects of the world at different temporal scales,

1545
01:38:16.879 --> 01:38:20.180
for example. So most of the uh the compelling

1546
01:38:20.189 --> 01:38:26.759
work in terms of um lesioning studies, usually um

1547
01:38:26.779 --> 01:38:29.399
use certainly with humans. The only lesions that you

1548
01:38:29.410 --> 01:38:33.879
could use were those that were um occur naturally

1549
01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:38.689
as in terms of strokes, for example, um or

1550
01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:43.520
if you were um involved as you know, as

1551
01:38:43.529 --> 01:38:45.700
a war medic, you, you had the opportunity to

1552
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:48.689
discover lesions caused by bullets, for example, in say

1553
01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:52.089
World War One that became known as neuropsychology. So,

1554
01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:57.060
neuropsychology just is uh understanding the deficits that follow

1555
01:38:57.069 --> 01:38:59.799
from a lesion to the brain. Um YOU know,

1556
01:38:59.810 --> 01:39:02.379
you can then say, well, if I've lost this

1557
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:04.700
function, I have this, you know, by appeal to

1558
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:07.620
this lesion deficit model, if I've lost this function

1559
01:39:07.950 --> 01:39:12.339
when I've had a stroke here, whereas I've lost

1560
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:14.049
this function. When I've had a stroke here, you've

1561
01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:16.779
got a double dissociation. That's one of the main

1562
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:20.580
workhorses of neuropsychology and that sort of means that

1563
01:39:20.589 --> 01:39:22.250
that part of the brain might be specialized for

1564
01:39:22.259 --> 01:39:25.180
this kind of function, whereas that might be specialized

1565
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:28.080
for another one. So you are starting to segregate

1566
01:39:28.089 --> 01:39:32.649
the functional specialization anatomically. So it's also known as

1567
01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:37.899
functional segregation. So functional segregation would be the anatomical

1568
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:41.660
segregation of functionally specialized brain areas. And we're talking

1569
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:44.500
about brain areas that at different scales cover the

1570
01:39:44.509 --> 01:39:48.430
entire lobe load that say doing right down to

1571
01:39:48.439 --> 01:39:55.140
little thumbnail sized patches of the brain, say B

1572
01:39:55.149 --> 01:39:58.930
five also known in animal research as NT have

1573
01:39:58.959 --> 01:40:02.200
been specialized for visual motion. So this was uh

1574
01:40:02.209 --> 01:40:06.939
this was if you like um the, the whole

1575
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:12.140
set of um really important questions um pertaining to

1576
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:16.580
is the functional specialization is a functional segregation in

1577
01:40:16.589 --> 01:40:19.520
the brain. We think there is because you look

1578
01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:24.459
at all these beautiful neuropsychology experiments, all these very

1579
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:29.979
fine neur anatomy and tracing studies. Um EVERYTHING points

1580
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:34.290
to functional specialization, but no one knew, no one

1581
01:40:34.299 --> 01:40:39.089
knew until brain imaging came along. It's strange. But

1582
01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:43.330
before really before the sort of the late eighties,

1583
01:40:43.339 --> 01:40:46.990
early nineties, this was just a hypothesis. It was

1584
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.069
only when you could actually measure the entire brain

1585
01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:54.720
doing one thing that you could say yes, this

1586
01:40:54.729 --> 01:40:57.479
part of the brain was involved in visual motion

1587
01:40:57.790 --> 01:41:01.290
and it didn't activate anything else. And this part

1588
01:41:01.299 --> 01:41:04.560
of the brain was involved in processing visual color

1589
01:41:05.129 --> 01:41:07.479
and it's not the visual motion area and it

1590
01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:10.390
didn't activate anything else? So it's only when you

1591
01:41:10.399 --> 01:41:14.140
were able to do imaging proper by which I,

1592
01:41:14.330 --> 01:41:16.879
I'm assuming that your question is about being able

1593
01:41:16.890 --> 01:41:20.529
to form pictures of the entire brain natural. Yeah.

1594
01:41:20.729 --> 01:41:24.069
Uh So at that point, all of these, um

1595
01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:28.490
I mean, unsurprising but, but strictly speaking, all up

1596
01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:32.520
until that, up until that time, functional specialization and

1597
01:41:32.529 --> 01:41:35.899
segregation and all the theories about uh that intend

1598
01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:38.790
in terms of uh functional brain architectures were just

1599
01:41:38.799 --> 01:41:42.189
hypotheses. No one actually knew until you could actually

1600
01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:47.359
measure the brain responding or executing a particular function

1601
01:41:47.370 --> 01:41:50.540
or engage in a particular kind of perception. Uh

1602
01:41:50.759 --> 01:41:53.770
um um Until you can actually see that and

1603
01:41:53.779 --> 01:41:59.189
see the anatomical segregation in the images that we

1604
01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:02.569
knew that was the case. And that having established

1605
01:42:03.319 --> 01:42:07.970
the principle of functional specialization or segregation, the next

1606
01:42:07.979 --> 01:42:10.459
stage was to turn to the second principle which

1607
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:16.569
was um which is in my word referred to

1608
01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:19.270
as the principle of functional integration. So now you've

1609
01:42:19.279 --> 01:42:21.660
got this notion, you've got lots of different sort

1610
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:27.589
of centers and anatomically segregated specialized processing brain regions.

1611
01:42:27.970 --> 01:42:29.680
Now, you want to know how they talk to

1612
01:42:29.689 --> 01:42:33.890
each other, how are the messages passed around? How

1613
01:42:33.899 --> 01:42:37.160
does one system influence another or contextualize another? What

1614
01:42:37.169 --> 01:42:41.379
is the nature of the distributed processing? And that

1615
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:44.609
really requires you to understand the connectivity. So we

1616
01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:47.060
we're back now to the adjacent sea matrices and

1617
01:42:47.069 --> 01:42:49.839
the collective and the causal influences of one region

1618
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:53.660
on another region that is going to recapitulate or

1619
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:57.509
install that causal architecture out there. You know that

1620
01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.609
it matters. You know, when you're speaking that I

1621
01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:02.930
can either infer what you are saying through the

1622
01:43:02.939 --> 01:43:05.819
movement of your lips, through the visual modality or

1623
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:08.439
through my ears. In terms of the sound waves

1624
01:43:08.450 --> 01:43:11.660
that you you produce, there is a common cause

1625
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:13.359
and therefore there has to be part of the

1626
01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:16.919
brain in which there is audio visual integration is

1627
01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:25.120
mechanistically evinced through connections between or through convergence into

1628
01:43:25.129 --> 01:43:29.279
these a modal domain general readers through these hierarchical

1629
01:43:29.290 --> 01:43:33.520
structures. So this then became the focus of um

1630
01:43:33.529 --> 01:43:36.959
decades of research ongoing uh in brain imaging to

1631
01:43:36.970 --> 01:43:39.549
understand the connectivity and the uh and how the

1632
01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:45.890
connections um underwrite patterns of activation and systems uh

1633
01:43:45.930 --> 01:43:52.899
you know a different scales so that um understanding

1634
01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:56.259
the integration of these functionally specialized regions was very

1635
01:43:56.270 --> 01:44:00.129
important for me. Um And many people like me.

1636
01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:05.810
Um ONE important aspect of functional integration in the

1637
01:44:05.819 --> 01:44:09.290
brain was this hierarchical structure. So the very first

1638
01:44:09.299 --> 01:44:14.720
paper in cerebral cortex and the first issue was

1639
01:44:14.729 --> 01:44:18.439
a very famous Fellow of Vanessen paper just looking

1640
01:44:18.450 --> 01:44:23.770
at the connectivity studies usually in primates of post

1641
01:44:23.819 --> 01:44:27.649
mortem studies, looking at great detail about the nature

1642
01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:29.990
and the lambda specificity of different connections. And they

1643
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.689
came up with a wiring diagram that was the

1644
01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:35.689
visual hierarchy. And a lot of work since that

1645
01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:39.700
time has now been trying to understand the hierarchical

1646
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:44.229
relationship in terms established by the connections by using

1647
01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:47.100
brain imaging to measure not just which brain areas

1648
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:50.990
are activated, but can you infer the influence that

1649
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.169
this brain area has on this brain area?

1650
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:57.330
Right. And so uh we've been talking a lot

1651
01:44:57.339 --> 01:45:01.319
about brain imaging, but are there ways by which

1652
01:45:01.330 --> 01:45:06.310
we can integrate the more coarse grained approaches to

1653
01:45:06.319 --> 01:45:09.060
the brain with the more fine grained approaches? And

1654
01:45:09.069 --> 01:45:15.319
for example, integrates the smaller sort of microscopic aspects

1655
01:45:15.330 --> 01:45:20.680
of brain physiology with the more abstract understanding of

1656
01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:24.149
the mind, like what we have in psychiatry or

1657
01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:24.950
psychology.

1658
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:30.779
Yeah. No, that's an excellent question. Um um And

1659
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:33.870
in essence, yes, you know, there is, you know

1660
01:45:33.879 --> 01:45:36.729
that that would be the holy grail of um

1661
01:45:37.169 --> 01:45:41.600
um um certainly translational neuroscience in the context of

1662
01:45:41.609 --> 01:45:45.799
translating into a clinical context, neurology or or psychiatry

1663
01:45:45.919 --> 01:45:49.240
to do that usefully as you intimate, you really

1664
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:52.879
need to link the scales. So sometimes um um

1665
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.169
framed in terms of from um from molecules to

1666
01:45:57.180 --> 01:46:02.069
behavior. Uh I like from sin, the sentience. Um

1667
01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:05.399
So how, how do you bridge that gap? Um

1668
01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:08.250
I if you want, if you want my honest

1669
01:46:08.259 --> 01:46:10.700
and personal answer, you, you, you need to have

1670
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:13.009
a generative model of the brain. So we've been

1671
01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:16.080
talking about the brain as a generative model but

1672
01:46:16.089 --> 01:46:18.549
a lot of the maths um behind the the

1673
01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:22.370
energy principle that kind that, that description of self

1674
01:46:22.399 --> 01:46:27.759
organizing self-organization in the brain inherited from the problem

1675
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:32.080
of actually analyzing brain imaging data and integrating data

1676
01:46:32.089 --> 01:46:36.430
at different scales and different modalities. And the secret

1677
01:46:36.439 --> 01:46:40.279
behind it is to have a model of how

1678
01:46:40.290 --> 01:46:43.470
you think the brain works that can generate predictions

1679
01:46:43.479 --> 01:46:45.509
of the data that you would get if you

1680
01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:48.240
measured it at this scale versus that scale. So

1681
01:46:48.250 --> 01:46:51.620
what normally happens is that people um specialize in

1682
01:46:51.629 --> 01:46:53.580
a particular scale. So you can be a molecular

1683
01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:59.379
biologist and work with um um um all the

1684
01:46:59.390 --> 01:47:04.339
the the delicate and, and sometimes overwhelming plurality of

1685
01:47:04.350 --> 01:47:08.169
um of, of different in intercellular mechanisms and biochemical

1686
01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:11.069
pathways and or even the genetics and genomics and

1687
01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:14.104
all this. Uh SO the whole universe just looking

1688
01:47:14.115 --> 01:47:18.234
at not just one cell but even mitochondria within

1689
01:47:18.245 --> 01:47:20.584
one cell. You know, there are people who know

1690
01:47:20.595 --> 01:47:24.095
more than I could possibly know about the entire

1691
01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:27.745
brain, you know, just about the dynamics and the

1692
01:47:27.754 --> 01:47:31.654
structure of organelles and, and things like, you know,

1693
01:47:31.665 --> 01:47:34.924
I repeat mitochondria in the cell right through to

1694
01:47:35.084 --> 01:47:38.680
eho you know, who just look at um uh

1695
01:47:38.729 --> 01:47:42.529
stigma, look, look at ant colonies, for example, uh

1696
01:47:42.549 --> 01:47:46.930
sort of multiple individuals or psychologists uh um of

1697
01:47:46.939 --> 01:47:48.709
a certain b who are, you know, interested in

1698
01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:52.859
the social neuroscience. Um So all of these people

1699
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:55.200
work at different scale, but in principle, you should

1700
01:47:55.209 --> 01:47:58.120
be able to link the scales. Um And that

1701
01:47:58.129 --> 01:48:01.720
means you have to have um you have to

1702
01:48:01.729 --> 01:48:05.229
have again, another instance of this sort of hierarchical

1703
01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:08.359
scale free modeling, which means you need to have

1704
01:48:08.370 --> 01:48:12.189
the right principles. So, you know, just to come

1705
01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:15.509
back to where we started, you know, the rates

1706
01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:17.930
on debt for the free principles to identify these

1707
01:48:17.939 --> 01:48:20.779
scale free principles that you should find operating at

1708
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:22.970
every level so that you can start to link

1709
01:48:22.979 --> 01:48:26.879
the levels. So just experimentally, what one is looking

1710
01:48:26.890 --> 01:48:31.040
for is at a very, very fine scale to

1711
01:48:31.049 --> 01:48:36.950
try and estimate certain dynamics rate constants connectivity structures.

1712
01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:41.979
Um IN a way that allows you now to

1713
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:48.759
constrain um estimates um in more elaborate higher scale

1714
01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:51.640
models of what's going on. Uh So just to

1715
01:48:51.649 --> 01:48:56.700
give you a concrete example, say take psychiatry um

1716
01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:03.979
and you're uh predicating your understanding of psychiatry, say

1717
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:10.140
psychosis in terms of a predisposition to hallucinations. And

1718
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:14.870
you can start to look for models psychological models

1719
01:49:14.879 --> 01:49:18.100
of hallucinations and do brain scanning when people are

1720
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:22.640
hallucinating versus not hallucinating at a very large scale

1721
01:49:22.649 --> 01:49:27.279
level. And then start to say does this kind

1722
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:32.509
of paradigm and the emergent brain activations and effective

1723
01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:39.520
connectivity um um matter in terms of uh identifying

1724
01:49:39.529 --> 01:49:42.569
people with and without say schizophrenia or some kind

1725
01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:47.490
of volcanic psycho syndrome or um um uh snap.

1726
01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:49.220
Um

1727
01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:52.549
WHAT do you sign up top? Sorry,

1728
01:49:53.009 --> 01:49:58.669
a pathology of synapses? So, um um so the

1729
01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:01.430
connection, the connectivity we've been talking about is uh

1730
01:50:01.439 --> 01:50:09.430
connections between nerve cells or neurons. Those connections come

1731
01:50:09.439 --> 01:50:11.649
in many different flavors. And how people argue that,

1732
01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:14.680
you know, they are also um non neuron cells

1733
01:50:14.689 --> 01:50:17.970
are important in in in message passing and self-organization.

1734
01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:22.649
But the primary way in which one nerve cell

1735
01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:26.950
or population of nerve cells, neurons talk to another

1736
01:50:26.959 --> 01:50:31.370
uh population is through this, these axons, the wires

1737
01:50:31.850 --> 01:50:38.109
and these wires basically um impinge upon receptors, dendritic

1738
01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:43.370
trees uh of the of the recipient neuron. And

1739
01:50:43.379 --> 01:50:46.669
the actual connection is very much like a little

1740
01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:49.830
plug and socket. It's called a synapse. So, so

1741
01:50:49.839 --> 01:50:53.029
this is a very, very small um um uh

1742
01:50:53.319 --> 01:50:57.979
plug and socket um that has an amazing physiology

1743
01:50:57.990 --> 01:51:00.430
and, and it can, it can be tuned much

1744
01:51:00.439 --> 01:51:04.549
like a transistor or, or uh you know, modern

1745
01:51:04.569 --> 01:51:08.839
day implementations of chips and but much more complicated

1746
01:51:08.959 --> 01:51:13.640
than you'll find in the computer. Um So that's

1747
01:51:13.649 --> 01:51:19.279
the synapse, a pathology of synaptic communications transmission. Um

1748
01:51:19.609 --> 01:51:34.279
um IS a synaptophysin transmission. It is the understanding

1749
01:51:34.290 --> 01:51:37.080
of the biochemistry, the Nero and the genomics and

1750
01:51:37.089 --> 01:51:41.160
the physiology of how one neuron nerve cell talks

1751
01:51:41.169 --> 01:51:44.080
to another through these synapses and it can go

1752
01:51:44.089 --> 01:51:52.040
wrong in all sorts of ways. So, synaptophysin communication,

1753
01:51:52.049 --> 01:51:54.770
if you are machine learning, it would be basically

1754
01:51:54.810 --> 01:51:59.009
breaking the connection weights. Um There are lots and

1755
01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:00.729
lots of different ways in which it can be

1756
01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:05.810
changed. Um USUALLY associated with neurodegenerative conditions. But also

1757
01:52:05.819 --> 01:52:10.930
you can generalize the notion that because this synaptic

1758
01:52:10.939 --> 01:52:17.770
communication involves, involves neurotransmitters and the neurotransmitters cause their

1759
01:52:17.779 --> 01:52:22.430
effects in the post synaptic cell by latching onto

1760
01:52:22.439 --> 01:52:26.790
receptors. Those receptors are the targets of drugs. So

1761
01:52:26.799 --> 01:52:29.089
nearly all the fact that all the drugs that

1762
01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:32.500
we use. Nearly all the drugs that we use

1763
01:52:32.509 --> 01:52:38.830
in neurology and psychiatry are those drugs that affect

1764
01:52:38.839 --> 01:52:43.910
synaptic transmission. Interestingly not to usually directly cause a

1765
01:52:43.919 --> 01:52:49.149
response but to attenuate or augment the impact of

1766
01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:52.950
an existing input. So it's like switching again on

1767
01:52:52.959 --> 01:52:55.310
the synaptic connections much in the way that we

1768
01:52:55.319 --> 01:53:02.910
could imagine increasing the gain on connectivity in the

1769
01:53:02.919 --> 01:53:06.770
brain by deploying attention attending over here. As opposed

1770
01:53:06.779 --> 01:53:10.680
to over there means that I can use certain

1771
01:53:10.689 --> 01:53:16.819
mechanisms, usually neuromodulatory mechanisms to modulate the gain of

1772
01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:21.299
the synaptic transmission, sometimes known as post synaptic gain

1773
01:53:21.310 --> 01:53:25.120
or sensitivity. Um So, you know, if that those

1774
01:53:25.129 --> 01:53:28.319
systems go wrong, then you've got now um a

1775
01:53:28.330 --> 01:53:31.790
very small scale and you understand the mechanics because

1776
01:53:31.799 --> 01:53:34.850
you've done all the um the neuropharmacology and the

1777
01:53:34.859 --> 01:53:39.325
molecular biology. Um um I studied these cells in

1778
01:53:39.334 --> 01:53:43.924
context in microcircuits. If you understand that you've now

1779
01:53:43.935 --> 01:53:50.285
got a link between the the macro scale belief,

1780
01:53:50.294 --> 01:53:55.000
updating that underlies a hallucination and what could possibly

1781
01:53:55.009 --> 01:54:00.120
cause the difference in the propensity for illusory or

1782
01:54:00.129 --> 01:54:03.479
hallucinatory perception in this group of people versus that

1783
01:54:03.490 --> 01:54:06.629
group of people predicated on an understanding of the

1784
01:54:06.899 --> 01:54:10.720
mear biology or the drug status of these people

1785
01:54:10.729 --> 01:54:14.779
because he started to understand the biophysics of the

1786
01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:19.009
message passing that ultimately, that just is the neural

1787
01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:23.620
dynamics of the internal states. But because you've now

1788
01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:29.450
got a principled account of how the internal dynamics

1789
01:54:29.609 --> 01:54:33.180
can manifest in terms of perception. You've now got

1790
01:54:33.189 --> 01:54:37.120
an explanation at the level of perception and hallucinations

1791
01:54:37.259 --> 01:54:40.910
and belief, updating, and failures of belief, updating like

1792
01:54:40.919 --> 01:54:44.020
delusions. Or in fact, if you think about it,

1793
01:54:44.029 --> 01:54:49.370
nearly every psychiatric syndrome can be thought of as

1794
01:54:49.379 --> 01:54:53.750
some kind of false inference whether it's anorexia, nervosa

1795
01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:57.910
and I have I falsely infer that I am

1796
01:54:57.919 --> 01:55:01.109
much fatter than I am. So I just morph

1797
01:55:01.129 --> 01:55:03.950
a phobia. So it's quite natural. If I, if

1798
01:55:03.959 --> 01:55:08.109
I infer and believe that I'm grossly obese, then

1799
01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:10.589
it's quite understandable. I'm going to be very resistant

1800
01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:16.810
to overeating um through to um you know, um

1801
01:55:16.819 --> 01:55:19.939
delusional systems of paranoia. For example, if I, you

1802
01:55:19.950 --> 01:55:24.250
know, falsely infer that you have some antagonistic view

1803
01:55:24.259 --> 01:55:26.750
or I falsely infer that the TV presenter is

1804
01:55:26.759 --> 01:55:29.319
actually talking to me personally, you know, of, you

1805
01:55:29.330 --> 01:55:31.890
know, a failure of attribution of uh a failure

1806
01:55:31.899 --> 01:55:35.370
of attribution of kind of false inference right through

1807
01:55:35.379 --> 01:55:40.580
to um you know, um the kind of the,

1808
01:55:40.589 --> 01:55:44.220
you know, the influences that need new learning for

1809
01:55:44.330 --> 01:55:46.430
if I, if we lose a loved one in

1810
01:55:46.439 --> 01:55:48.569
our lives, you know, the grief reaction requires a

1811
01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:52.419
lot of new learning, which um you know, um

1812
01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:55.279
means that for a certain amount of time, um

1813
01:55:55.290 --> 01:55:57.850
you will be making false influence, I expect, you

1814
01:55:57.859 --> 01:55:59.720
know, my daily life to be like this and

1815
01:55:59.729 --> 01:56:01.729
the loved one is not there. You know, you

1816
01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:04.950
have to completely relearn a new world model or

1817
01:56:04.959 --> 01:56:07.430
a new challenge of model where that person is

1818
01:56:07.439 --> 01:56:10.439
no longer there that can be very painful. Um

1819
01:56:10.450 --> 01:56:13.140
AND involve lots of mistakes and high free energy

1820
01:56:13.149 --> 01:56:16.169
which you try to repair by, by learning a

1821
01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:18.810
new way. I think, slowly coming to terms with

1822
01:56:18.819 --> 01:56:20.839
what with what has happened.

1823
01:56:21.450 --> 01:56:24.750
Could that also apply to depression? And in this

1824
01:56:24.759 --> 01:56:27.859
case, depression, what would it be like? Would it

1825
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:33.890
be sort of having pessimistic generative models of the

1826
01:56:33.899 --> 01:56:35.799
world or something like that?

1827
01:56:36.669 --> 01:56:40.410
Yeah, there are lots of interesting counts of depression

1828
01:56:41.180 --> 01:56:43.709
under the free energy principle, more particularly sort of

1829
01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:48.529
active influence focusing on different aspect of it. You

1830
01:56:48.589 --> 01:56:52.700
know, there is an argument that depression is not

1831
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:55.250
false inference in the sense that it is actually

1832
01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:59.029
veridical and the very fact that we have depression

1833
01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:02.799
after millennia of natural selection means that there must

1834
01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:05.470
be something good about, about the ability to be

1835
01:57:05.479 --> 01:57:08.410
depressed. Um And of course, you know, if you

1836
01:57:08.419 --> 01:57:12.919
read depression in a very simple way as avoidance

1837
01:57:12.930 --> 01:57:18.669
behavior that restricts that precludes um putting yourself in

1838
01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:22.089
situations where you will be surprised or hurt or

1839
01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:26.120
damaged or embarrassed or upset, um in some way,

1840
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:29.970
um then it can be very protective. Um So

1841
01:57:29.979 --> 01:57:33.450
it's quite good to be de depressed and withdrawn

1842
01:57:33.459 --> 01:57:37.350
in situations where if you didn't withdraw from this

1843
01:57:37.359 --> 01:57:42.810
different if you didn't preclude or um um preclude

1844
01:57:42.819 --> 01:57:45.390
that interaction, you could actually end up being more

1845
01:57:45.399 --> 01:57:50.959
surprised and, and, and um agitated or upset than

1846
01:57:50.970 --> 01:57:54.680
if you did the problem with depression. Um IS

1847
01:57:54.689 --> 01:58:00.569
when you, when that base optimal um response, active

1848
01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:08.589
inference response, um um outlives the circumstances that caused

1849
01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:11.700
it. So say I have a bad experience, but,

1850
01:58:11.709 --> 01:58:14.540
you know, you can see how the argument could

1851
01:58:14.549 --> 01:58:17.680
be extended to all sorts of phobias and obsession

1852
01:58:17.689 --> 01:58:20.560
compulsive disorder. But let's just simplicity, say I have

1853
01:58:20.569 --> 01:58:23.669
a very bad experience. That means that if I

1854
01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:26.790
leave my house, I am going to be very

1855
01:58:26.799 --> 01:58:30.689
surprised. I, I um by something awful happening, whether

1856
01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:34.770
it's a social, uh socially awful thing or emotionally

1857
01:58:34.779 --> 01:58:38.189
aw awful thing or physically awful thing. Um, YOU

1858
01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:40.290
know, I'm going to be in excruciating pain or,

1859
01:58:40.459 --> 01:58:44.479
um, or feel terrified, uh have a panic attack

1860
01:58:44.490 --> 01:58:47.450
if I leave the house. Um This will happen

1861
01:58:47.459 --> 01:58:50.569
to me because it happened to me once. Therefore,

1862
01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:52.770
this is the kind of thing I don't do

1863
01:58:52.779 --> 01:58:55.060
because I don't have panic attacks. And I don't,

1864
01:58:55.069 --> 01:58:57.750
you know, I don't, uh um I don't get

1865
01:58:57.759 --> 01:59:01.089
upset by uh by, by other people. Um You

1866
01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:03.500
know, I have um I have this kind of

1867
01:59:03.509 --> 01:59:06.209
self model, therefore, it's highly unlikely that something like

1868
01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:08.509
me will leave the house. So I end up

1869
01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:12.950
socially withdrawn. Uh I avoid social media, for example,

1870
01:59:12.959 --> 01:59:19.000
you know, um and that can be very functional

1871
01:59:19.009 --> 01:59:22.450
if you have, if it's actually quite dangerous out

1872
01:59:22.459 --> 01:59:26.270
there, but now say the world changes and all

1873
01:59:26.279 --> 01:59:29.250
your friends are missing you and they don't know

1874
01:59:29.259 --> 01:59:32.359
where you are, but you don't have the opportunity

1875
01:59:32.370 --> 01:59:34.790
to revise your prior beliefs that if I go

1876
01:59:34.799 --> 01:59:38.950
outside, I'm going to get hurt simply because your

1877
01:59:38.959 --> 01:59:43.720
behavior has prevented you from self evidencing from gathering

1878
01:59:43.729 --> 01:59:47.720
evidence to revise your self model or your model

1879
01:59:47.729 --> 01:59:50.330
of the consequences of your behavior. So there are

1880
01:59:50.339 --> 01:59:56.939
some certain pernicious responses, active um inference that mean

1881
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:59.720
you can never get out of that behavior because

1882
01:59:59.729 --> 02:00:04.819
you're not exploring, you're not always seeking evidence for

1883
02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:08.629
this way of being and that way of being.

1884
02:00:08.839 --> 02:00:11.700
So this is sometimes framed in terms of literally

1885
02:00:11.709 --> 02:00:14.240
getting stuck in a rut because you can't get

1886
02:00:14.250 --> 02:00:15.979
out of the rut, you can't get out of

1887
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:18.839
the valley because you've got no evidence that's going

1888
02:00:18.850 --> 02:00:21.470
to cause prediction errors to drive you to change

1889
02:00:21.479 --> 02:00:25.129
your mind. So what you need to do in

1890
02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:29.490
these situations such as depression is to basically um

1891
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:32.850
make the sides of the valley shallower to allow

1892
02:00:32.859 --> 02:00:35.709
people to escape again and to, to, to allow

1893
02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:39.009
the prediction errors to uh you know, drive to,

1894
02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:44.350
to seek out information um to um um resolve

1895
02:00:44.359 --> 02:00:48.660
uncertainty to where uncertainty is expected, surprise and expected

1896
02:00:48.669 --> 02:00:51.660
free energy. And to do that, you can do,

1897
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:52.919
you can do it in one of two ways.

1898
02:00:52.930 --> 02:00:57.220
You can either create an environment where the patient

1899
02:00:57.359 --> 02:01:01.180
feels safe so that they can explore different ways

1900
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:03.569
of interacting and you'd be thinking about. So di

1901
02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:09.310
um um either cognitive behavioral therapy or, or psychotherapy,

1902
02:01:09.319 --> 02:01:14.509
talking therapy and psychoanalysis um with uh or you

1903
02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:16.339
can think about doing it chemically if you understand

1904
02:01:16.350 --> 02:01:21.709
the men, if you understand um how we encode

1905
02:01:21.779 --> 02:01:25.330
the precision, the conviction, the depth of our, you

1906
02:01:25.339 --> 02:01:27.470
know, I'm stuck in this flat and I've got

1907
02:01:27.479 --> 02:01:29.830
no latitude to move. So you've got very, very

1908
02:01:29.839 --> 02:01:33.149
precise beliefs that are holding you in place. Do

1909
02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:39.799
you understand what neurochemically and biophysical is representing that

1910
02:01:39.810 --> 02:01:43.500
particular belief? Which is, this is about the, about

1911
02:01:43.509 --> 02:01:46.770
the precision of your conviction that this is the

1912
02:01:46.779 --> 02:01:49.729
way I behave. And then you can actually give

1913
02:01:49.740 --> 02:01:52.720
drugs to try and relax that to try and

1914
02:01:52.729 --> 02:01:55.910
uh um relax the constraints. So people can start

1915
02:01:55.919 --> 02:01:58.790
to explore other ways. Uh You know, so you

1916
02:01:58.799 --> 02:02:02.779
can understand a lot of uh pharmacotherapy uh in

1917
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:09.560
terms of the uh uh retuning um the encoding

1918
02:02:09.569 --> 02:02:13.669
of uncertainty or precision, which is if you remember

1919
02:02:13.890 --> 02:02:17.129
that sort of slow but not very fast sort

1920
02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:21.250
of thing between inference and learning. So this is

1921
02:02:21.259 --> 02:02:24.109
the contextual inference. This is the attention, this is

1922
02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:27.000
the, you know, the way that we encode uncertainty

1923
02:02:27.009 --> 02:02:32.120
in the brain. Um And if, if surprise expected,

1924
02:02:32.129 --> 02:02:36.790
surprise is uncertainty, which it is self information is

1925
02:02:36.799 --> 02:02:42.270
expected. Self information, average self information is entropy. Um

1926
02:02:42.279 --> 02:02:47.169
PUT in layman's language or the vernacular would basically

1927
02:02:47.259 --> 02:02:50.830
the surprise I expect is uh uh is uncertainty

1928
02:02:50.839 --> 02:02:52.979
then I'm in the, you know, I am always

1929
02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:55.459
in the game of reducing uncertainty under the free

1930
02:02:55.470 --> 02:03:00.660
energy principle, reducing expected surprise. But to do that,

1931
02:03:00.669 --> 02:03:05.240
I've also got to recognize my level of uncertainty,

1932
02:03:05.250 --> 02:03:09.189
my level of surprise or average surprise, which brings

1933
02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:12.700
us back to this sort of crucial um um

1934
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:17.779
ability to recognize the context in terms of how

1935
02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:21.970
confident I am in my beliefs. And that relates

1936
02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.779
to microscopic on the molecular level, to synaptic fish

1937
02:03:26.879 --> 02:03:29.299
p the same post synaptic gain and all the

1938
02:03:29.310 --> 02:03:31.270
neuromodulation that we've been talking about.

1939
02:03:32.529 --> 02:03:36.629
Mhm So, Doctor Frieden, I would really love to

1940
02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:40.209
get into other topics like for example, the application

1941
02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:44.990
of active influence to explaining or understanding certain social

1942
02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.529
phenomena like social conformity. And then I would like

1943
02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:51.589
to ask you about culture, but I, I'm just

1944
02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:54.259
seeing that we've already done two hours. So do

1945
02:03:54.270 --> 02:03:56.879
you think it would be better for us to

1946
02:03:57.149 --> 02:03:59.950
uh do it? Uh Again, another time,

1947
02:04:01.069 --> 02:04:03.060
I would be very happy to come back and

1948
02:04:03.069 --> 02:04:06.740
do all those, we have to come back a

1949
02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:09.040
few times to do to do all that.

1950
02:04:09.959 --> 02:04:12.649
Yeah, because if we get, if we get into

1951
02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:17.040
the topic of social expectations, culture and all of

1952
02:04:17.049 --> 02:04:19.990
that, we will be here for another two hours.

1953
02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.879
Probably. Yes, if not longer. Now, I I now

1954
02:04:23.890 --> 02:04:26.120
I now need to go neuromodulation and have a

1955
02:04:26.129 --> 02:04:28.319
nice cigarette and a cup of coffee to think

1956
02:04:28.330 --> 02:04:30.089
about what we've been talking about.

1957
02:04:31.319 --> 02:04:35.830
Great. So, just before we finish this interview, are

1958
02:04:35.839 --> 02:04:39.220
there any places on the internet where people can

1959
02:04:39.229 --> 02:04:40.540
find your work?

1960
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:45.450
Uh Yes, there are. Uh I mean, it's not

1961
02:04:45.459 --> 02:04:47.870
really my work. I mean, the, the active influence

1962
02:04:47.879 --> 02:04:52.069
is now, you know, growing well beyond, um, even

1963
02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:54.899
that, which I know about. Um, SO there, there's

1964
02:04:54.910 --> 02:04:57.149
a, a large literature in all of the fields

1965
02:04:57.160 --> 02:04:59.200
that we've, we've spoke about. So I think you

1966
02:04:59.209 --> 02:05:02.600
just, you know, Google, active infants and um but

1967
02:05:02.609 --> 02:05:06.129
specifically that there um there's something called the Active

1968
02:05:06.140 --> 02:05:11.729
Inference Institute. Um The um um and it's based

1969
02:05:11.740 --> 02:05:14.589
in California and it's, it, it, it, it provides

1970
02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:17.919
an excellent resource of teaching materials and possible live

1971
02:05:17.930 --> 02:05:20.779
streams and mentorship uh for people who are interested

1972
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:23.330
in sharing ideas or just learning about how, you

1973
02:05:23.339 --> 02:05:27.279
know, um um active influence in its various um

1974
02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:32.819
various fields of application. There's also international workshops where

1975
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:36.000
the community gets together and um tells each other,

1976
02:05:36.009 --> 02:05:38.439
tell each other what what's happening and what's exciting

1977
02:05:38.450 --> 02:05:42.839
in the field. Uh So uh active Inference Institute,

1978
02:05:42.850 --> 02:05:45.140
but otherwise you're just looking at the theoretical neuro

1979
02:05:45.399 --> 02:05:47.520
literature in the field in the field of your,

1980
02:05:47.529 --> 02:05:50.740
your inquiry don't necessarily look for my name. As

1981
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:54.359
I say, it's, it's go, it's gone, it's gone

1982
02:05:54.370 --> 02:05:57.629
past me. I'm now an admiring spectator of uh

1983
02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:58.479
on the applications.

1984
02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:02.810
Great. So look this has been a really fascinating

1985
02:06:02.819 --> 02:06:05.810
conversation. We've covered a lot of ground when it

1986
02:06:05.819 --> 02:06:10.029
comes to the free energy principle nervous systems, active

1987
02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:13.419
influence. So I'm very much looking forward to our

1988
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:16.640
next talk. Excellent. I look forward to that.

1989
