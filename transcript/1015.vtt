00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:03.119
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.079
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.810
joined by our return guest, Doctor Julia Haman. She

4
00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.270
is an assistant Professor of Philosophy and Ethics at

5
00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.250
the University of Trent. And today we're talking about

6
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.719
the ethics of Actos technologies and techno moral revolution.

7
00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:23.399
So, Doctor Eman, welcome to the show. It's a

8
00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:24.760
pleasure to everyone again.

9
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.979
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure for me

10
00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:27.579
to be here.

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.069
So I I mean, we've already covered a bit

12
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.200
of these in our first interview with doctors IBO

13
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.369
van de Van de Pool and yo and Hob

14
00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:42.610
and Doctor Hob is going to kill me because

15
00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:48.180
I keep mispronouncing his first name. But anyway, um

16
00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.229
what is Actos technology?

17
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.240
Yeah, that technology is better known as artificial womb

18
00:00:57.279 --> 00:01:02.169
technology. It's a reproductive technologies that enables the gestation

19
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.669
of a fetus outside of its mother's body in

20
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.529
a device that mimics the maternal womb. The term

21
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.500
exogenesis means mammalian development outside the maternal body where

22
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.980
this normally happens within so, not necessarily human development,

23
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.150
but the development of a mammal more generally and

24
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.190
so those devices, those extra two set of devices

25
00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:30.540
really try to be completely like the natural womb.

26
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.980
So they include components such as an artificial placenta,

27
00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:39.900
artificial amniotic fluid. Yeah. And currently such a technology

28
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.209
is being developed in the Netherlands, for instance, at

29
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.919
Eindhoven University, but also in the United States, of

30
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.559
course, and by a team from Japan and Australia.

31
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.080
And uh there's an interesting distinction here between the

32
00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:59.360
partial Acto gestation and full Acto gestation. Could you

33
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.089
tell us about the difference?

34
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.589
Yeah, it's very important actually to distinguish the two.

35
00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:08.149
So the term partial active gestation refers to the

36
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.149
use of this technology only for part of this

37
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.520
gestation process. So for instance, when a fetus is

38
00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:21.809
born prematurely, full ecto gestation by contrast refers to

39
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.820
a more futuristic scenario where this technology is used

40
00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:29.410
for the whole process of extra uterine gestation. So

41
00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:34.279
from fertilization to birth and the scientists who are

42
00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:38.110
currently developing this technology, they intended to be used

43
00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:40.479
only for partial electro gestation. So the idea is

44
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.059
that this would solve the big problem of premature

45
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.339
death. So it would replace current incubators, the incubators

46
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.619
that are in use in neonatal intensive care units.

47
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.899
So partial electro gestation seems to be much closer

48
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.470
to the current situation. Whereas full electro gestation for

49
00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:03.440
some seems completely like science fiction. Um SOME say

50
00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.940
we shouldn't even think about it. It's far too

51
00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:10.770
futuristic. Others view it as the liberation of women,

52
00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:14.360
like especially people who see pregnancy as a burden

53
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.839
something we should get rid of, it's much more

54
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.789
contested. And it's important that the developers of this

55
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.770
technology at least say that they are not interested

56
00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.429
at all in such a scenario.

57
00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:31.389
So uh but from an ethical perspective, because that's

58
00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:34.750
what we're going to focus on mostly here today,

59
00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:39.779
why does this distinction matter between these two different

60
00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:44.460
kinds of ecto gist technologies? Even though at least

61
00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:48.429
one of them is more, let's say conceptual, more

62
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.740
fut futuristic. So,

63
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.559
yeah, so one argument from an ethical perspective is

64
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.740
that we need to first look at the specific

65
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.820
case of partial activation because that is something that

66
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.970
might already become real in the very near future,

67
00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.500
let's say probably in a few years, we already

68
00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:20.010
have the first inhuman trials. And it already already

69
00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:29.010
this scenario raises significant ethical issues specifically about the

70
00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:33.970
rights that the mother would still have over the

71
00:04:33.989 --> 00:04:36.170
yeah, features that would then be in this device

72
00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:40.239
about the rights of doctors. Um Would that human

73
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.799
being in this device be treated as a patient

74
00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:44.929
in its own right? Or would it more be

75
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.970
seen as part of the mother still, although it's

76
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.510
not in her body anymore, and it has all

77
00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:54.089
kinds of legal implications and because it is sometimes

78
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.869
presented as just something like a more high tech,

79
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.149
more advanced incubator that might lead people to think,

80
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.480
well, then there is not much ethical like not

81
00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:07.679
many ethical issues um that we need to consider

82
00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:10.209
but that is not the case. So it's very

83
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.920
important to point that out that already this use

84
00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:18.010
um has these important implications. And then comparatively, if

85
00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:21.019
you look at full electric gestation, that of course

86
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:26.640
raises entirely new issues because the whole idea that

87
00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:28.660
we might, that women might not need to get

88
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:34.720
pregnant anymore for like offspring to be created that

89
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.859
makes you Yeah. Yeah. Comes with a whole sub

90
00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:39.290
issues that I I'm happy to talk also more

91
00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:42.760
about later. So I think there are some questions

92
00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:46.140
that you can say apply to both use of

93
00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:50.480
the technology. But um it's important to distinguish between

94
00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:54.390
that which might become real or might be in

95
00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:58.589
use already. Yeah, in the near future. And those

96
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.700
new questions actually that arise when we contemplate this

97
00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:05.329
more futuristic scenario

98
00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:13.880
and what kinds of sative technologies if any do

99
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.709
we already have available?

100
00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:21.609
Well, that is the so called bio that has

101
00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:25.739
been used by the researchers at Philadelphia's Children's Hospital

102
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:31.290
in the US when 2017 managed to transfer lamb

103
00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:33.809
fetuses in such a bio and then took them

104
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.250
out of the bag health. And that was seen

105
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.980
as a great success towards such a device for

106
00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:41.179
humans so that we already have, but we don't

107
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.730
yet have any such technology available for humans. We

108
00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:47.829
first we are still expecting the first in human

109
00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:52.549
trials and perhaps also one other thing to note

110
00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:56.070
that next to this artificial womb is I now

111
00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:57.709
want to call it just to make clear that

112
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.720
the idea is to mimic the natural womb. There's

113
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.290
also a technology just called the artificial placenta, that's

114
00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:07.000
for instance, currently developed at my home university in

115
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:12.170
20 that is in some respects similar and also

116
00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:15.200
aims at solving this problem of preterm death. So

117
00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:19.109
also intended to, to sort of replace incubators, but

118
00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:22.809
it doesn't aim at completely mimicking the womb. Um

119
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.320
So it doesn't create this womb like environment, but

120
00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:27.570
you could perhaps say it, it is something similar,

121
00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:32.019
it gets much less media attention than the the

122
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:34.130
other form of this technology.

123
00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:39.450
Uh So you mentioned a premature premature death there.

124
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:44.339
Um WHAT would be the goals, the medical goals

125
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.130
of these technologies? I mean, in what kinds of

126
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.200
situations would people want or would expect to use

127
00:07:52.209 --> 00:07:52.529
them?

128
00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:58.160
Yeah, in cases where fetuses are prematurely born and

129
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.049
especially they are looking at the period between 22

130
00:08:01.059 --> 00:08:05.630
and 24 weeks of gestation. Um The idea would

131
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.829
be that those prematurely born born babies would have

132
00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:14.799
much higher chances to survive in such an artificial

133
00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:17.940
womb compared to an incubator. And that is mainly

134
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.059
because the lungs and then not sufficiently developed yet.

135
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.720
And in an incubator, the baby has to breathe,

136
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.179
which is actually cannot yet. And in the artificial

137
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.299
womb, it wouldn't have to do that. It would

138
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:34.320
be in an environment very similar to the maternal

139
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.340
womb. And so the chances of survival are expected

140
00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:40.090
to be much higher and also to um the

141
00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:44.958
chance of survival without severe handicaps. So the if

142
00:08:44.968 --> 00:08:47.758
asked also scientists about this and they said that

143
00:08:48.059 --> 00:08:51.849
they feel with the current technology, the incubators, they

144
00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:54.510
have reached a certain limit, they are unable to,

145
00:08:55.049 --> 00:08:58.210
to solve this problem to reduce like the death

146
00:08:58.219 --> 00:09:01.630
even more. And they really need a fundamentally new

147
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.179
technology to make progress here.

148
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.659
So last time in our first interview, as I

149
00:09:10.669 --> 00:09:14.669
said before, we talked about uh the ethics of

150
00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:19.119
socially disrupt disruptive technologies. And that also included a

151
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.330
discussion about how uh cons concepts that we have

152
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.510
can be disrupted in a way. So in this

153
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.700
particular case of sative technologies, what would you say

154
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.500
are perhaps some of the main concepts, main ideas

155
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:39.869
that we share as a society that could potentially

156
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.229
be disrupted.

157
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:47.530
Yeah, concepts such as pregnancy, birth, also body, then

158
00:09:47.539 --> 00:09:51.479
concepts of fetus in neonates and the whole cluster

159
00:09:51.489 --> 00:09:57.039
of concepts uh involving including mother, father, parent, family

160
00:09:57.489 --> 00:09:59.760
and so on. So perhaps if I can start

161
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.219
with birth, interesting concept in this context. So if

162
00:10:03.229 --> 00:10:06.440
we look at parry electro gestation, we don't really

163
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.010
need to go so far and look at full

164
00:10:08.059 --> 00:10:12.830
electric gestation, then the question would arise when the

165
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.119
moment is when a baby is being born because

166
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.739
usually we conceive of birth as involving two kinds

167
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:24.380
of changes, a physiological change and a change in

168
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:30.919
location. And this technology would that separate the two.

169
00:10:30.929 --> 00:10:33.030
So in in this case, you would say that

170
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:37.210
the fetus that has been transferred into this device

171
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.590
has gone through like location change, but there has

172
00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:46.130
been no significant physiological change. It would still not

173
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.809
have to breathe, it would still continue developing in

174
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.549
the same way as it did in the maternal

175
00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:53.280
womb. So then you could ask, well, has it

176
00:10:53.289 --> 00:10:57.469
been born or not? And you would wonder perhaps

177
00:10:57.479 --> 00:11:00.580
there would be two moments of birth. So it

178
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:06.570
will be completely unclear to what? Yeah, um event

179
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.380
the concept of birth would apply. And perhaps you,

180
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.940
you would even have to conclude that you need

181
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.840
a different concept because that's not really birth, neither

182
00:11:13.849 --> 00:11:17.150
of that, right? Neither the transfer into the artificial

183
00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:20.599
womb nor than the extraction out of this device

184
00:11:20.609 --> 00:11:20.969
or something

185
00:11:22.369 --> 00:11:25.039
on the topic, on the topic of birth. Uh

186
00:11:25.049 --> 00:11:29.200
GOING back to the distinction between partial and full

187
00:11:29.359 --> 00:11:32.390
ecto gestation because in the case of partial ecto

188
00:11:32.619 --> 00:11:37.859
gestation at a certain point, uh the fetus goes

189
00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:42.140
out of the womb into the machine or whatever

190
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.830
it might be for, for it to undergo the

191
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.789
rest of what would have been interest uterine development,

192
00:11:50.799 --> 00:11:53.969
right? But, but if we add somewhere in the

193
00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:58.700
future, full actual gestation, then there would be at

194
00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:03.729
least the potential there for even the conception and

195
00:12:03.739 --> 00:12:09.020
the rest of the development to occur fully within

196
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.679
a machine, right? And, and not at any point

197
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:17.190
within a woman's body, right? So in that specific

198
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.429
case, birth would be completely disrupted, right? II I

199
00:12:23.369 --> 00:12:25.739
Yes, because of course, there would be this moment

200
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.299
where this entity, however, you would then want to

201
00:12:29.309 --> 00:12:33.799
call, it would undergo a location change because it

202
00:12:33.809 --> 00:12:36.559
would somehow come out of this machine. But yeah,

203
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.429
would you really call that birth? Right? You also

204
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.640
talk about giving birth. Would the machine give birth?

205
00:12:43.539 --> 00:12:44.719
It would probably

206
00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:47.559
that would sound very weird.

207
00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:49.830
Very weird. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

208
00:12:50.969 --> 00:12:53.950
So uh and perhaps tell us about other concepts

209
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.479
like body fetus.

210
00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.760
Yeah. So with body, the interesting thing is that

211
00:13:00.099 --> 00:13:04.229
the boundary between body and machine seems to be

212
00:13:04.239 --> 00:13:10.530
very blurred, right? Because according to one model of

213
00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:15.840
um pregnancy, the parts are called part hood model.

214
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.119
The fetus is seen as part of its mother's

215
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.830
body. So when we take this model and then

216
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.859
we think of the fetus being transferred into this

217
00:13:25.869 --> 00:13:29.030
machine and developing and growing further inside the machine,

218
00:13:29.239 --> 00:13:31.859
you might want to consider it as now becoming

219
00:13:31.869 --> 00:13:35.429
part of this machine. So that's really interesting. And

220
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.979
you and then you can also ask, well, um

221
00:13:37.989 --> 00:13:40.409
what actually then happens to the relation between the

222
00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:43.219
fetus and the mother? So perhaps there's also then

223
00:13:43.229 --> 00:13:47.309
a very intimate relationship between the mother and this

224
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.260
machine because this fetus was a part of her

225
00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:52.729
and that then has been transferred. So that's, that's

226
00:13:52.739 --> 00:13:56.309
really interesting. It seems there's no clear distinction between

227
00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.539
um the body of either the fetus or the

228
00:13:59.549 --> 00:14:03.770
mother and this machine. And then that's also interesting

229
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.880
to consider the concepts fetus in the unit because

230
00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:09.479
there's a debate in the literature, especially in the

231
00:14:09.989 --> 00:14:14.739
medical bioethics literature about how we should call the

232
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.719
being that has been transferred into this device. So

233
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.599
there are people who argue it, it should just

234
00:14:20.609 --> 00:14:22.429
be called a fetus because it's very similar to

235
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.150
a fetus. It's actually a fetus and others say,

236
00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:26.010
no, it's not a fetus is it's a neon

237
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.960
or newborn and it should be called. Thus, it's

238
00:14:27.969 --> 00:14:30.380
more similar to a neon. And it has been

239
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:35.260
argued by Elizabeth Roman is that both concepts or

240
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.890
both terms do not really fit because they have

241
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.940
specific connotations that are not adequate when we think

242
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.940
of this new situation. So we need a new

243
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.719
concept, a new term. They talk about terms, but

244
00:14:45.729 --> 00:14:48.359
they think that there are conceptual implications here. So

245
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.429
Oman is herself has suggested the term gest link,

246
00:14:52.219 --> 00:14:56.299
very technical sounding term. Others have come up with

247
00:14:56.309 --> 00:14:59.750
uh the concept font that clearly combines F as

248
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.059
a neon at the fonet. There's also the concept

249
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:05.359
Perin. So that is a very interesting discussion and

250
00:15:05.369 --> 00:15:08.659
it shows that the disruption is taking place here

251
00:15:08.669 --> 00:15:12.859
and we do not know anymore what concept to

252
00:15:12.869 --> 00:15:13.309
apply.

253
00:15:14.979 --> 00:15:18.080
So uh I had these questions for later, but

254
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.530
perhaps since we're already talking about disrupting a concept

255
00:15:21.539 --> 00:15:26.489
like body, let's introduce the topic here of abortion.

256
00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:29.919
Uh I want to introduce it now because um

257
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:32.239
I mean, o of course, we have this idea

258
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:36.000
or at least the people who defend the right

259
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:39.440
for women to abort or the right for abortion.

260
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:44.200
Uh Many times argue on the grounds that at

261
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.969
least while the fetus is inside her body, it

262
00:15:48.979 --> 00:15:52.969
is her body. We're still talking about her body.

263
00:15:52.979 --> 00:15:55.890
It's a part of her body. So it's for

264
00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.450
her to decide what occurs in her body, right?

265
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.500
So, but in this particular case, since uh at

266
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.594
least at a certain point in partial ectal gestation

267
00:16:07.604 --> 00:16:11.625
and in full ectal gestation, it's fully outside of

268
00:16:11.635 --> 00:16:13.655
the body or it would be fully outside of

269
00:16:13.664 --> 00:16:17.434
the body. The fetus is no longer part of

270
00:16:17.674 --> 00:16:23.215
uh the mother's body. Do you think that the

271
00:16:23.224 --> 00:16:27.195
ways we think about abortion uh would also have

272
00:16:27.205 --> 00:16:28.054
to change?

273
00:16:28.869 --> 00:16:30.900
I do think so. And this is already also

274
00:16:30.909 --> 00:16:33.320
being anticipated. So there is also a discussion in

275
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.789
the philosophical literature about this and some really fear

276
00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:41.299
that this technology could have a negative effect on

277
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:44.419
the right to abortion because indeed, it could for

278
00:16:44.429 --> 00:16:47.169
instance, be argued that if there's the possibility to

279
00:16:47.179 --> 00:16:52.409
transfer a fetus to an artificial womb, then um

280
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.739
yeah, there would be no grounds. We would lose

281
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.690
the grounds for arguing that there is a right

282
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.690
to abortion, right? So then you might be, you

283
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:05.410
might even force pregnant women to opt for ation

284
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.818
instead of abortion for instance, if you think of

285
00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:12.348
fall to gestation and then wonder, well, what would

286
00:17:12.358 --> 00:17:14.808
abortion mean? In this case they get that is,

287
00:17:14.818 --> 00:17:17.048
I think even more disruptive to even understand what

288
00:17:17.058 --> 00:17:21.659
abortion would amount to so terminating. Yeah, would be

289
00:17:21.667 --> 00:17:24.229
turning off the machine. Exactly. It would there be,

290
00:17:24.239 --> 00:17:25.749
how would you, so you really would have to

291
00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:30.699
think about new or new legal regulations. Um, SO

292
00:17:30.709 --> 00:17:32.739
how people do the first, um, aspect that I

293
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.849
mentioned, what, what people have argued is for instance,

294
00:17:35.859 --> 00:17:41.109
that the grounds for defending still like the right

295
00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:43.439
or the permissibility of abortion would be to say

296
00:17:43.449 --> 00:17:47.020
that. And some really argue that that there is

297
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.280
a right to the death of the fetus. So

298
00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.319
it's let's go so far. So there is a

299
00:17:52.329 --> 00:17:53.760
right to the death of the fetus and then

300
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.380
you could that way justify abortion. And another way

301
00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:02.439
of arguing is to say that like doing this

302
00:18:02.449 --> 00:18:06.949
transferal of the fetus is very invasive and that

303
00:18:06.959 --> 00:18:09.180
women should have the right to s to reject

304
00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:12.839
that invasive, like a a and, and, and instead

305
00:18:12.849 --> 00:18:16.099
opt for an abortion. And it's certainly very interesting

306
00:18:16.109 --> 00:18:18.260
topic and there is already quite some discussion in

307
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.349
the literature about what this would mean. And, and,

308
00:18:20.359 --> 00:18:25.380
and some people really were very worried that this

309
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.199
might have a negative effect on abortion.

310
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.180
Yeah. A a and another thing that was coming

311
00:18:31.189 --> 00:18:35.170
to my mind is of course, if uh a

312
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.829
child is born I mean, we have to take

313
00:18:38.839 --> 00:18:42.579
care of it in some way. So in this

314
00:18:42.589 --> 00:18:49.339
particular case, if uh the state forced women went

315
00:18:49.349 --> 00:18:52.930
to abort to sort of transfer their fetus into

316
00:18:52.939 --> 00:18:57.959
a machine for partial gestation, I mean, who would

317
00:18:57.969 --> 00:19:03.239
be uh legally responsible for raising the uh the

318
00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:08.439
child? I mean, would we force the original mother,

319
00:19:08.449 --> 00:19:13.670
the original gest, let's say to uh provide for

320
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.920
that child that she didn't want. I mean, th

321
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.750
this raises lots of questions, complicated questions.

322
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.150
Right. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I think no

323
00:19:23.859 --> 00:19:25.920
way of seeing this would be that the idea

324
00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.030
would be then to you look for like adoptive

325
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.729
parents for that child. So the idea would be

326
00:19:31.739 --> 00:19:34.170
then to do a but what if they don't

327
00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:39.060
find anyone? So that definitely, yeah, perhaps it would

328
00:19:39.069 --> 00:19:42.390
just be seen as a child that has lost

329
00:19:43.219 --> 00:19:46.910
the parents through. Yeah, an incident, accident or something.

330
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.760
And then you need to see the, I guess

331
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.359
the state would be, it will probably be that

332
00:19:51.369 --> 00:19:53.579
the state is responsible and then the aim would

333
00:19:53.589 --> 00:19:57.900
be to find people who adopt that. But then

334
00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.449
of course you need also enough people who, who

335
00:20:00.459 --> 00:20:03.680
want to adopt a child. Um, YEAH, it's hard

336
00:20:03.689 --> 00:20:06.930
to do think of this really because we don't

337
00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:10.699
know how many cases there would be. Yeah, it

338
00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:14.510
gets very speculative but definitely a lot of questions

339
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.770
that we would have to answer. Yeah. Yeah.

340
00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:20.479
Yeah. And perhaps I mean, perhaps we are still

341
00:20:20.489 --> 00:20:24.680
thinking a little bit here from our own cultural

342
00:20:24.689 --> 00:20:28.260
perspective because we still live in a society where

343
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.959
this kind of technology is not available and these

344
00:20:30.969 --> 00:20:34.625
kinds of concepts have not been disrupted yet. So

345
00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:39.064
we still tend to think about fathers, mothers, about

346
00:20:39.074 --> 00:20:42.915
neonates, fetuses and all of that, about bodies. Uh

347
00:20:42.925 --> 00:20:45.935
But um I, I mean, I, I was just

348
00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:49.155
thinking that uh I mean, along the same lines

349
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:51.675
of what I was saying just in my previous

350
00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:56.145
question that uh II I mean, this could be

351
00:20:56.155 --> 00:21:00.869
sort of, this could create some nightmarish scenarios because

352
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.650
if, for example, a government uh just takes away

353
00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.020
the right to abortion and forces women, even women

354
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.839
who don't want to have Children just because they

355
00:21:13.849 --> 00:21:17.589
get accidentally pregnant or something like that to then

356
00:21:17.599 --> 00:21:20.880
move their f to a machine and do partial

357
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:25.250
act of gestation. I mean, they could either force

358
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:31.239
the women to be responsible for that child, she

359
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.839
doesn't want to or didn't want to have. Uh

360
00:21:34.849 --> 00:21:38.329
OR I mean, uh we could go down the

361
00:21:38.339 --> 00:21:41.380
route that you described there or, or perhaps looking

362
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:44.890
for adoptive parents or something like that. But at

363
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.800
least in the very early stages, Children would still

364
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.550
live in a culture where they think about mothers

365
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.180
and fathers and in that particular case, since the

366
00:21:56.189 --> 00:22:00.290
child exists and was not aborted, I mean, there

367
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:05.560
would be a mother, biological mother out there that

368
00:22:05.569 --> 00:22:10.180
basically didn't want the child and the child if

369
00:22:10.189 --> 00:22:12.920
she knows or he or she knows, gets to

370
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.339
learn about that. I mean, since we live in

371
00:22:15.349 --> 00:22:19.400
this particular cultural context, it could be traumatic.

372
00:22:19.719 --> 00:22:23.099
Right. Absolutely. Yeah. But of course, we could also

373
00:22:23.109 --> 00:22:27.790
imagine that the whole all practices have already been

374
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.359
disrupted fundamentally. And we do not think in terms

375
00:22:31.369 --> 00:22:34.819
of mothers and fathers anymore, but perhaps even more

376
00:22:34.829 --> 00:22:38.939
parents generally and that perhaps groups of people who

377
00:22:38.949 --> 00:22:42.689
would act as parents. And yeah, perhaps also the

378
00:22:42.699 --> 00:22:46.180
way of becoming parents would, would have changed. So

379
00:22:46.189 --> 00:22:48.050
then you would also not look for these adoptive

380
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.800
like a mother and a father anymore, but you

381
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.060
would look for a community for instance, perhaps that

382
00:22:53.069 --> 00:22:55.069
would raise this child.

383
00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.050
Yeah. Yeah. No, no, definitely. That's why I, I

384
00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:03.069
prefaced my uh my previous question by saying that

385
00:23:03.079 --> 00:23:04.579
we have to keep in mind that we are

386
00:23:04.589 --> 00:23:08.750
still thinking in these terms and it's very hard

387
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.219
for us to put ourselves in the world or

388
00:23:12.229 --> 00:23:13.805
to imagine. And also I was in a world

389
00:23:13.814 --> 00:23:18.314
where we were Children, perhaps wouldn't care that much

390
00:23:18.324 --> 00:23:23.125
about who, who is their father, their mother or

391
00:23:23.145 --> 00:23:24.364
something like that.

392
00:23:25.055 --> 00:23:27.155
And we already have, of course, in our world

393
00:23:27.165 --> 00:23:32.285
cultures where always many more people are closely involved

394
00:23:32.295 --> 00:23:36.125
in, in the upbringing and where, yeah, much less

395
00:23:36.135 --> 00:23:39.165
weight is given to one particular person as a

396
00:23:39.175 --> 00:23:41.785
mother and where even several women, but mostly women.

397
00:23:42.459 --> 00:23:45.260
Yeah, if not only women are seen as their

398
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.609
mothers or as mother being a child.

399
00:23:48.579 --> 00:23:50.910
Yeah. I, I mean, I've talked with lots of

400
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:55.910
anthropologists on the show about cooper breathing. So that's

401
00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.469
a very, very, very common thing mostly nowadays in

402
00:24:00.479 --> 00:24:04.560
traditional societies. But for most of our history and

403
00:24:04.569 --> 00:24:06.969
our revolution it was very common.

404
00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:09.400
Yeah, exactly. I mean, now I saw in the

405
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.500
western world are so used to this idea that

406
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.390
the mother and the father and this is not

407
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.660
even something indeed that has such a long history,

408
00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.099
but this is yeah, very dominant at the moment.

409
00:24:18.109 --> 00:24:20.060
And, and that's also how we first of all

410
00:24:20.069 --> 00:24:22.920
look at this technology and possible future scenarios. That's

411
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:23.199
true.

412
00:24:23.239 --> 00:24:28.020
Yeah, it's just our obsession with the nuclear family,

413
00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.680
right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

414
00:24:31.359 --> 00:24:36.439
So uh tell us now about how perhaps gender

415
00:24:36.449 --> 00:24:39.829
roles could also be disrupted because it's not only

416
00:24:39.839 --> 00:24:43.280
that we think about fathers and mothers, but we

417
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:48.060
also associate fatherhood and motherhood with being a man

418
00:24:48.229 --> 00:24:51.329
or being a woman, right? So could that also

419
00:24:51.339 --> 00:24:55.380
be disrupted the way we think about genders and

420
00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.420
gender roles?

421
00:24:56.869 --> 00:24:59.520
Yeah, I do think so because there are these

422
00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:04.089
different dimensions of parenthood or motherhood in particular, namely

423
00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:07.760
the genetic dimension or biological dimensions, we can talk

424
00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:13.599
about genetic motherhood than gestational motherhood. That of course,

425
00:25:13.609 --> 00:25:15.790
doesn't exist for parents generally that's really tied to

426
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.400
the gender to the females. This gestational motherhood and

427
00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:24.410
then social motherhood or parenthood that's independent of independent

428
00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.109
of gender, but of course, the social expectations or

429
00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:31.349
the expectations of social parenthood, they are very different

430
00:25:31.359 --> 00:25:36.729
between the different genders. So this technology especially Full

431
00:25:36.739 --> 00:25:42.069
Act legislation that would enable the um yeah, development

432
00:25:42.329 --> 00:25:46.619
or creation of offspring without there being any gestational

433
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:51.709
mother at all that I think would really disrupt

434
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.079
the concept of a woman or a man. And,

435
00:25:55.089 --> 00:25:59.089
and, and yeah, the gender current gender roles. And

436
00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:02.670
um yeah, I mean, we see that's very often,

437
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.989
I think um the notion of woman is so

438
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.890
closely tied to her ability to become pregnant and

439
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.790
to have Children. And there are many societies, communities

440
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.119
where this is also expected of women and where

441
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.810
you, you sort of fail as a woman if

442
00:26:20.819 --> 00:26:23.250
you do not have or do not have Children.

443
00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.890
So it can be very problematic, very also psychologically

444
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.290
disturbing for a woman if she cannot have Children

445
00:26:31.219 --> 00:26:34.969
and like in a natural way. So if it

446
00:26:34.979 --> 00:26:37.420
is, of course, all is ultimately tied to the

447
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:42.920
fact that as things currently are. Mhm You need

448
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:46.630
to feed my body to, to have a child

449
00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.060
for a child to be born, if this were

450
00:26:49.069 --> 00:26:51.400
to change, if this were not necessary anymore. I

451
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.050
think it is hard to think from all the

452
00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.780
implications but that I think it's such a central

453
00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:56.319
point.

454
00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:57.579
Mhm

455
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.670
So I definitely think that gender roles.

456
00:27:01.479 --> 00:27:04.359
Yeah. And do you think that perhaps, do you

457
00:27:04.369 --> 00:27:07.270
think that perhaps the disruption here could even take

458
00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.640
a step further. Uh I mean, beyond uh disrupting

459
00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:16.900
generals and perhaps even disrupting our understanding of sex

460
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.250
itself. And I mean, by sex, I mean, a

461
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:23.670
male, female, our understanding of what you, what it

462
00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.219
is to be a male, what it is to

463
00:27:25.229 --> 00:27:27.579
be a female. Because I mean, even in that

464
00:27:27.699 --> 00:27:33.619
visionary biology, our understanding of what sex is keeps

465
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.819
changing a little bit as we make new discoveries.

466
00:27:36.829 --> 00:27:41.520
But in this particular case, if we have machines

467
00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:45.270
that would potentially be able to create new Children

468
00:27:45.349 --> 00:27:49.739
without handing it for uh a uterus or something

469
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:53.869
like that, then could that also be disrupted?

470
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.660
I would say yes, but of course, that is

471
00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.819
quite an extreme scenario. You would really have to

472
00:27:59.829 --> 00:28:06.189
assume perhaps even have to assume that all a

473
00:28:06.219 --> 00:28:09.670
reproduction would happen through this technology at some point.

474
00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:15.479
So then you could even completely forget about the

475
00:28:15.489 --> 00:28:19.800
past where actually like mothers became pregnant and had

476
00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:21.750
Children. But if this was in a way forgotten

477
00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.449
because you have these machines and you have like

478
00:28:24.459 --> 00:28:28.150
IVF and then the stage in these machines, then

479
00:28:29.089 --> 00:28:35.109
yeah, you might not at all conceptualize female and

480
00:28:35.119 --> 00:28:39.609
male according to those differences. So these perhaps that,

481
00:28:39.619 --> 00:28:41.219
I mean, of course, I imagine if, if then

482
00:28:41.229 --> 00:28:46.880
also those biological functions wouldn't really be used anymore.

483
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:50.020
So that then perhaps they would also in part

484
00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:56.199
of evolution just disappear, right? So perhaps even women

485
00:28:56.209 --> 00:29:00.469
would lose the ability or capacity to, to, to

486
00:29:00.479 --> 00:29:02.140
have Children to become pregnant.

487
00:29:02.959 --> 00:29:06.569
Oh my God. Another sort of dystopic scenario just

488
00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:09.890
came to my mind where we would get into

489
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:14.339
a future where we have full sative technology. And

490
00:29:14.349 --> 00:29:19.660
then we also have ways of artificially producing mass

491
00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:24.310
producing sperm and eggs. And then it would be,

492
00:29:24.319 --> 00:29:28.810
and then a dictatorship, the state would just keep

493
00:29:28.819 --> 00:29:33.060
producing its own Children without any need for people

494
00:29:33.069 --> 00:29:36.650
to reproduce. And, oh, now I need more soldiers

495
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.979
for war. Let's pump out 10,000 new kids.

496
00:29:41.609 --> 00:29:44.079
And you find things like that in the science

497
00:29:44.089 --> 00:29:48.060
fiction literature. So this is something that indeed people

498
00:29:48.069 --> 00:29:50.849
have thought of. Really. It is, yeah, very dystopian

499
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.829
scenario. And also I think, I mean, there are

500
00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:58.949
a lot of objections to this technology, right? And

501
00:29:58.959 --> 00:30:01.560
one is a colleague of mine has made that

502
00:30:01.569 --> 00:30:06.770
objection that it seems to be absurd to develop

503
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.760
and implement a technology to take over a function

504
00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:14.380
that women can just um yeah, do by themselves,

505
00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:18.439
right? I mean, imagine how much energy those devices

506
00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:23.199
would use, think, think about our climate crisis in

507
00:30:23.209 --> 00:30:28.160
that light. So how can you justify doing this?

508
00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.119
I mean, it it it seems crazy when you

509
00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.339
think about, yeah, the fact that this is something,

510
00:30:33.349 --> 00:30:36.280
although of course there are problems, pregnancies can be

511
00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:40.209
very dangerous, they can be very burdensome. The fact

512
00:30:40.219 --> 00:30:43.000
that women are pregnant and, and give birth to

513
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:46.310
Children and not men has created huge social and

514
00:30:46.319 --> 00:30:49.530
economic inequality. So all of that definitely could provide

515
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.660
reasons to think that such a technology would be

516
00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:54.329
desirable. But on the other hand, of course, there

517
00:30:54.339 --> 00:30:57.459
are also pregnancy and giving birth has also many

518
00:30:57.469 --> 00:31:02.290
positive connotations and and and many women have enjoyed

519
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.680
like being pregnant and and and having their Children

520
00:31:05.689 --> 00:31:08.729
this way. And yeah, and you can say that

521
00:31:08.739 --> 00:31:11.640
it it it enables a particular way of bonding

522
00:31:11.939 --> 00:31:14.469
between mother and child. And there are also all

523
00:31:14.479 --> 00:31:17.530
these question marks related to what effect would that

524
00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.569
have on the development of the baby? Also on

525
00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:26.660
the like mental health, perhaps general development. It it's

526
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.959
it's many, many question marks whether this would actually

527
00:31:29.969 --> 00:31:33.260
be to the benefit of the child. You might

528
00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:36.369
say, well, it would be a very safe environment

529
00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.650
safer than the natural womb because you could monitor

530
00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:42.099
everything, couldn't happen that for instance, the mother eats

531
00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:45.489
unhealthy food or drinks, alcohol consumes drugs, which has

532
00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.790
a ne like certainly we know that the negative

533
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.020
health effect on the baby. And so you could

534
00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:55.130
control all that. Um But nevertheless, what I mean,

535
00:31:55.510 --> 00:32:00.670
you also, people also believe that it is very,

536
00:32:00.989 --> 00:32:04.290
has a very positive effect on the fetus that

537
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.640
it has this very intimate relationship to its mother

538
00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.589
already while it is in the womb, that feeling

539
00:32:10.599 --> 00:32:13.410
her heartbeat or hearing her h hearing her voice,

540
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.550
also hearing the father's voice through the belly, etcetera,

541
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.089
etcetera. So many uh yeah, question marks and, and,

542
00:32:21.099 --> 00:32:22.800
and worries that you can have.

543
00:32:23.589 --> 00:32:26.770
So let me ask you uh a more perhaps

544
00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:31.449
positive question. Now, so when it, we've already talked

545
00:32:31.459 --> 00:32:34.640
about how gender roles and the concepts of father,

546
00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.250
mother, parent might be disrupted by these kinds of

547
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.819
technologies. So, on a more positive note, do you

548
00:32:41.829 --> 00:32:47.859
think that it could be um positive for trans

549
00:32:47.869 --> 00:32:50.750
women? Because we uh we tend to, as we've

550
00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.089
already talked about here, we tend to associate the

551
00:32:54.099 --> 00:32:58.390
idea of mother to s uh to people who

552
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.609
can produce babies who can get pregnant and give

553
00:33:02.619 --> 00:33:05.920
birth to them. So in this particular case, if

554
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.930
we arrived at a point where uh we would

555
00:33:08.939 --> 00:33:13.829
not no longer necessarily need that for babies to

556
00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:18.329
be, to develop. Um Do you, do you think

557
00:33:18.339 --> 00:33:24.000
that perhaps that would uh increase social acceptance at

558
00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:28.130
least uh not, not necessarily for trans people themselves,

559
00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.829
but for the idea of attaching a label like

560
00:33:31.839 --> 00:33:34.589
mother to a trans woman?

561
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.739
Yes, I do do think so. I do think

562
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:40.020
that that would be a way it develops, could

563
00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.479
be that we would be more open to apply

564
00:33:42.829 --> 00:33:47.619
the concept of mother to, for instance, um childs

565
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:51.959
uh women, it could also go like a slightly

566
00:33:51.969 --> 00:33:56.109
different direction, namely that we would get rid of

567
00:33:56.119 --> 00:34:00.680
the concept mother altogether and would just talk about

568
00:34:00.689 --> 00:34:05.780
parents. Because if you think about scenarios of electric

569
00:34:05.819 --> 00:34:11.708
station, you start wondering what actually is the crucial

570
00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:15.100
difference here between a mother and a father. It,

571
00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.760
it is far from clear. So um you could

572
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:23.969
argue that if gestational motherhood is taken over by

573
00:34:23.978 --> 00:34:28.540
a machine, which was the thing that the aspect

574
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.219
that man could not like, it didn't apply to

575
00:34:31.228 --> 00:34:34.330
men would say what would be the difference. I

576
00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.560
mean, we would, we could just talk about parents

577
00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:39.989
because they can be social parents, they can be

578
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.118
genetic parents. Nobody has to be the gestational parent.

579
00:34:44.217 --> 00:34:46.878
That would be the machine. So in that sense,

580
00:34:46.888 --> 00:34:51.330
and then of course, you anyway, could be much

581
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:55.179
more open to apply that label parent to all

582
00:34:55.188 --> 00:34:57.669
kinds of people. So it why would that have

583
00:34:57.679 --> 00:35:01.639
to be related to gender or sex? Right? Um

584
00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.350
It seems it wouldn't have to be so that

585
00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.110
I think are two ways you could say that

586
00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.739
because you might argue that the concept mother is

587
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:12.820
so deeply ingrained in our culture. And it's just

588
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:15.010
because I mean, there are so many connotations that

589
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.790
you have with, with the term mother. So you

590
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.689
might really think that this is not something that

591
00:35:18.699 --> 00:35:21.780
we would give up that is really important. And

592
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.989
then you might say, OK, but that would perhaps

593
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.870
be that there's openness to apply it to, to

594
00:35:26.879 --> 00:35:34.669
not just women. Um The alternative would be why,

595
00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:37.659
why do we need this concept anymore? In the

596
00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:40.260
end, there is no significant distinction between mother and

597
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:43.179
father. So why not just talk about parent And

598
00:35:43.189 --> 00:35:48.070
interestingly, Sally Haslinger has also thought about this but

599
00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.139
not related to this technology. But she has also

600
00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:54.830
in a way suggested talking about parents instead of

601
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.280
making this distinction between mothers and fathers.

602
00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:01.959
Yeah, I was just thinking because of course, culture

603
00:36:01.969 --> 00:36:06.340
tends to change um slowly, I mean, it's not

604
00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:10.389
that uh today we have act or just technology

605
00:36:10.399 --> 00:36:14.479
and then suddenly tomorrow, everyone no longer cares about

606
00:36:14.489 --> 00:36:18.169
concepts like mother and father or, or things like

607
00:36:18.179 --> 00:36:20.540
that. So I was just thinking that in the

608
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:24.310
case of trans women, since they uh identify as

609
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.129
women and like to present themselves socially as women

610
00:36:28.139 --> 00:36:32.500
that perhaps uh at least while we're still using

611
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:37.040
concepts like mother and father, it would uh potentially

612
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:41.800
become more socially acceptable for uh them to also

613
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:45.540
use or, or identify themselves as mothers if they

614
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:50.290
are raising Children or so because they might like

615
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:54.889
to do that themselves since that there's that concept

616
00:36:54.899 --> 00:36:58.469
in our culture and to perhaps express, I don't

617
00:36:58.479 --> 00:37:01.060
know their femininity or something like that,

618
00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.949
they probably also would really want to be called

619
00:37:04.959 --> 00:37:08.189
mothers, right? Or to, to, to count as mothers

620
00:37:08.199 --> 00:37:10.600
and rather than just parent because this is something

621
00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:14.060
that they, yeah, I agree with that. And I

622
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.600
mean, we can of course, already see especially the

623
00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:22.060
philosophical like discussion, ethical discussion that become very careful

624
00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.649
when using the term woman. And so already there

625
00:37:25.659 --> 00:37:29.939
is an openness to, to refer to people as

626
00:37:29.949 --> 00:37:32.889
women who are not women in the sense of

627
00:37:32.899 --> 00:37:37.750
being born with the female. And yeah, sex. So

628
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.590
I think that is definitely something that we can

629
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.590
imagine. And I mean, of course, that's something I

630
00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.600
want to note also is that it's not that

631
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.129
we can consider this technology in isolation. Of course,

632
00:37:50.139 --> 00:37:53.550
it is embedded in a history of reproductive technologies

633
00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.419
and some of these disruptions and changes have already,

634
00:37:57.429 --> 00:37:59.949
I mean, they are already ongoing. So it's not

635
00:37:59.959 --> 00:38:02.510
that it's only this technology that brings about all

636
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.820
those, but it's it's others have also already done

637
00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.449
their part and we have to see it in

638
00:38:07.459 --> 00:38:11.939
that context. And then the question is how perhaps

639
00:38:11.949 --> 00:38:16.139
this technology um leads to more radical and faster

640
00:38:16.149 --> 00:38:20.979
changes and yeah, accelerates developments perhaps that are already

641
00:38:20.989 --> 00:38:23.939
going on because of course, gender roles, traditional gender

642
00:38:23.949 --> 00:38:27.229
roles have already been disrupted and are changing. And

643
00:38:27.239 --> 00:38:31.959
nevertheless, we notice how much certain pictures stick, right?

644
00:38:31.969 --> 00:38:33.989
Especially I think in the western world, as you

645
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.330
said, this idea of the nuclear family and of

646
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.600
the mother is the main like a caregiver of

647
00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:42.899
a child, the most important person in the life

648
00:38:42.909 --> 00:38:44.949
of a child. I think this is still very

649
00:38:44.959 --> 00:38:49.689
dominant in our culture, right? Despite all these changes

650
00:38:49.699 --> 00:38:50.610
that have already happened.

651
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.070
And it's very interesting that you mentioned that this

652
00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.860
is or would be part of a history of

653
00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:04.590
um reproductive uh technologies that disrupt certain aspects of

654
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:09.030
how we think and conceive of reproduction because we're

655
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.784
also going to get into uh some of that

656
00:39:11.794 --> 00:39:14.945
here. But before that, could you tell us also

657
00:39:14.955 --> 00:39:19.385
about this concept that you wrote about in your

658
00:39:19.395 --> 00:39:24.225
work of techno moral revolutions? What is uh uh

659
00:39:24.324 --> 00:39:27.415
uh I mean, if even before the techno techno

660
00:39:27.784 --> 00:39:31.685
moral part of it, what is a moral revolution

661
00:39:31.695 --> 00:39:32.745
more generally?

662
00:39:33.274 --> 00:39:36.044
Yes, a moral revolution is a particular type of

663
00:39:36.054 --> 00:39:41.010
moral change and it's typically taken to occur in

664
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.000
a rather short period of time and to involve

665
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:48.070
a moral paradigm change. So the authors who've mainly

666
00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.760
written in philosophy about moral revolutions, they are typically

667
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:54.270
inspired by the work of Thomas Cohn on the

668
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.739
structure of scientific revolutions. And I think that in

669
00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:01.340
the moral realm, something analogous happens or has happened.

670
00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:04.830
Um IMPORTANT to say that more revolutions do not

671
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.469
necessarily have to be instances of moral progress. There's

672
00:40:08.479 --> 00:40:11.699
also the whole literature of moral progress. Um And

673
00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:15.429
a paradigm example is always the abolition of slavery.

674
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.679
And um the more revolution often you find actually

675
00:40:20.689 --> 00:40:26.010
the same examples. But um in principle, that's something

676
00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.629
that my co authors and I have also stressed,

677
00:40:28.639 --> 00:40:32.649
it could also be a revolution that we would

678
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:35.899
regard as something negative or regressive from a moral

679
00:40:35.909 --> 00:40:37.429
point of view. So it doesn't have to be

680
00:40:37.439 --> 00:40:41.850
progressive, but it's so it's a radical change that

681
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.070
usually happens. It's most people think that in a

682
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.189
short period of time and you could perhaps talk

683
00:40:47.199 --> 00:40:49.850
about like a moral paradigm shift.

684
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.659
So when we have the suffix or the pre

685
00:40:54.760 --> 00:41:00.270
the prefix techno to moral revolution, uh what does

686
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.949
that mean specifically? And could you give us perhaps

687
00:41:02.959 --> 00:41:04.060
an example of that?

688
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:07.350
Yeah. So the idea is that those techno more

689
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.780
revolutions consist of radical group or society level change,

690
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:18.290
not individual but society in morally significant practices whereby

691
00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.090
technology plays a noteworthy role. So basically the idea

692
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:27.189
to call some yeah, development techno more revolution, not

693
00:41:27.199 --> 00:41:31.070
just more revolutions is to point to the significant

694
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.550
role played by technology because that seems to have

695
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.239
been overlooked by most people who wrote about moral

696
00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:45.899
evolutions. So an example is um the revolution in

697
00:41:45.909 --> 00:41:50.389
sexual morality where contraceptive technology and in particular, the

698
00:41:50.399 --> 00:41:53.699
pill arguably has played a very important role. So

699
00:41:53.709 --> 00:42:00.050
the claim is not that um a technology alone

700
00:42:00.209 --> 00:42:03.629
brings about a revolution but that it's a complex

701
00:42:03.639 --> 00:42:09.469
process where different developments, different agents movements play a

702
00:42:09.479 --> 00:42:13.800
role. But also there is a very interesting important

703
00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:15.629
role played by technology. And in the, in the

704
00:42:15.639 --> 00:42:19.179
case of the um sexual revolution or revolution in

705
00:42:19.189 --> 00:42:23.360
sexual morality, we can say that contraceptives played an

706
00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:24.790
enabling role.

707
00:42:25.449 --> 00:42:30.550
Mhm A and here uh perhaps you are focusing

708
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.639
mostly on uh the pill is that

709
00:42:33.649 --> 00:42:36.139
it? Yes, that is the focus also in the

710
00:42:36.149 --> 00:42:39.739
literature on techno moral change. Um That is an

711
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.729
example that is very often given and they always

712
00:42:41.739 --> 00:42:44.169
focus on the pill from what I've read about

713
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:50.060
the sexual revolution. Um Actually, it is contraceptive technology

714
00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:53.080
more generally. It is not really plausible to think

715
00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:56.320
it's only the pill. But yeah, the pill is

716
00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.699
the one that is always singled out. And perhaps

717
00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:03.090
because of its particular reliability, it is sort of

718
00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.500
different. It's, yeah, it is a different kind of

719
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.550
contraception, but it is already earlier, you can see

720
00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:13.750
significant changes once contraceptive technologies became available.

721
00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:21.560
And when you mentioned changes in sexual morality, what

722
00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:27.050
are or what were those changes specifically? Because uh

723
00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.739
I know that, I mean, nowadays, we hear a

724
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:35.260
lot sometimes particularly more conservative people or people who

725
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.870
are more on the conservative end of the spectrum

726
00:43:37.879 --> 00:43:42.879
talking about how some of these technologies in their

727
00:43:42.889 --> 00:43:51.780
minds were just complete disaster because apparently, apparently people

728
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:55.500
became much more promiscuous and people do not care

729
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:59.209
about marriage anymore. So are those the sorts of

730
00:43:59.219 --> 00:44:01.050
things we're talking about here or?

731
00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.360
Yeah. No, I mean, the idea is more that

732
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:07.770
we moved away from a relatively strict system of

733
00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:11.250
sexual morality where so sex outside of marriage was

734
00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.639
seen as impermissible. Um The permissibility of sex and

735
00:44:14.649 --> 00:44:17.489
gender was closely tied to reproduction, which is what

736
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:21.520
this technology really changed, right? Because it decoupled reproduction

737
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:25.709
from sex. So also homosexuality is what really regarded

738
00:44:25.719 --> 00:44:28.229
as something negative. And also because the idea was

739
00:44:28.239 --> 00:44:30.750
sex always has to lead to, to offspring. That

740
00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.080
is what its purpose is and that couldn't of

741
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:38.250
course, be the purpose of homosexual sexual activities. So

742
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:43.899
through this decoupling of sex and reproduction, the grounds,

743
00:44:43.909 --> 00:44:48.649
the reasons for arguing that homosexuality is like morally

744
00:44:48.659 --> 00:44:50.770
bad and it should not be permitted. They were

745
00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:55.530
just like they were not existed anymore and especially

746
00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:59.469
also the expectations and the norms applying to women

747
00:44:59.479 --> 00:45:02.879
changed and, and, and some virtues that used to

748
00:45:02.889 --> 00:45:06.709
be very important like chastity, purity, sexual modesty, mainly

749
00:45:06.719 --> 00:45:10.169
related to women. They just lost important with K

750
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.800
but of course, there are still groups but especially

751
00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:17.189
also certain religions who uphold those values. It's not

752
00:45:17.199 --> 00:45:20.929
that they have appeared disappeared entirely. But in many

753
00:45:21.239 --> 00:45:24.139
contexts, in many societies, they now play rather a

754
00:45:24.149 --> 00:45:27.110
marginal role. So an idea of, of technical changes

755
00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.570
also that the relative importance of values and virtues

756
00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:34.310
that changes through the influence of technology. So it's

757
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.510
not that something disappears entirely, but some virtues or

758
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.530
values become much more important, others less important. And

759
00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:45.649
we see this phenomenon of demoralization. So homosexual sexuality

760
00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:49.219
was highly moralized was seen as something morally bad,

761
00:45:49.739 --> 00:45:52.360
but it came more and more to be seen

762
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:55.209
as actually something morally neutral. I mean, it's not

763
00:45:55.219 --> 00:45:59.389
more really irrelevant whether someone is heterosexual or homosexual

764
00:45:59.399 --> 00:46:00.949
or bisexual or whatever.

765
00:46:01.889 --> 00:46:06.659
Uh I mean, not only it wasn't just moralized,

766
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.169
but it was also at a certain point even

767
00:46:09.179 --> 00:46:12.899
medicalized, right? Because at a certain point, it was

768
00:46:12.909 --> 00:46:17.689
in psychiatry, at least homosexuality and other kinds of

769
00:46:17.699 --> 00:46:24.929
uh non heterosexual behaviors or tendencies were uh pathologize.

770
00:46:25.239 --> 00:46:29.860
Yes, absolutely. And of course, this didn't change entirely

771
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:32.639
only through this technology to contraceptive technology. But that

772
00:46:32.649 --> 00:46:35.550
really, you might say played a role here. And

773
00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.060
then of course, you have to also give credit

774
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:41.179
to the social movements, um, that there's a lot

775
00:46:41.189 --> 00:46:43.679
of work here. But this technology certainly without that,

776
00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:46.550
you might wonder how perhaps it had been a

777
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.340
much slower process. You could imagine that and, and

778
00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:52.399
yeah, perhaps that never happened in this way.

779
00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:55.669
Uh But this is also very interesting to me

780
00:46:55.679 --> 00:46:58.770
in another very particular kind of way that is,

781
00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.709
doesn't this point also to the idea that I

782
00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:05.219
mean, if we think we could think about it

783
00:47:05.229 --> 00:47:08.239
in terms of i in realistic terms, I mean,

784
00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:13.600
in sort of Marxist terms where I mean, ideas

785
00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:17.492
that are prevalent in a society, hegemonic ideas do

786
00:47:17.502 --> 00:47:21.333
not come from nowhere or it's not about the

787
00:47:21.343 --> 00:47:24.903
just the ideas themselves, but it's, it's the sort

788
00:47:24.913 --> 00:47:28.812
of uh the way our society is structured, our

789
00:47:28.822 --> 00:47:35.093
sociality, ecological conditions, also technological revolutions that really lead

790
00:47:35.103 --> 00:47:39.785
to people, people actually changing the ways they relate

791
00:47:39.795 --> 00:47:42.815
to one another and the ideas that are prevalent

792
00:47:42.825 --> 00:47:45.635
in their own societies, right? So, I mean, it

793
00:47:45.645 --> 00:47:50.756
very much gives sort of a materialistic basis to

794
00:47:51.006 --> 00:47:53.996
uh where ideas come from in society

795
00:47:55.166 --> 00:47:59.850
because those conditions also constrain what we can imagine

796
00:48:00.979 --> 00:48:03.350
what we can think of the ideas that could

797
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:06.510
appear. Yeah, I mean, there's this argument by um

798
00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.570
the philosopher Nigel Pleasant, who has written about moral

799
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:13.030
revolutions and about the abolition of slavery. And who

800
00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.600
has argued that the reason why slavery was abolished

801
00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:20.679
at the moment, but it was abolished after centuries

802
00:48:20.689 --> 00:48:22.919
in which slavery was just accepted was that at

803
00:48:22.929 --> 00:48:28.379
that point, a super realistic superior alternative became available.

804
00:48:28.389 --> 00:48:32.370
So that is indeed a Marxist thought that unless

805
00:48:32.379 --> 00:48:38.959
you have such a superior real alternative, the criticism

806
00:48:38.969 --> 00:48:41.620
that always existed just had no authority. It wasn't

807
00:48:41.629 --> 00:48:45.570
heard because this practice, the practice of slavery was

808
00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:48.889
seen as something indispensable, something natural. Yeah, bad, perhaps

809
00:48:48.899 --> 00:48:52.520
bad, perhaps not really desirable. But yeah, we just

810
00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:56.080
need it. We cannot, couldn't our economy couldn't work

811
00:48:56.090 --> 00:49:00.040
without slaves. And once there was like wage labor

812
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:04.340
is an alternative criticism gained authority. And then the

813
00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:09.239
abolitionist movement was at to to happen and to

814
00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:11.649
to to the practice was able to be abolished.

815
00:49:11.659 --> 00:49:13.199
So that's of course, there are many different. Slavery

816
00:49:13.209 --> 00:49:14.820
is a very complex topic. There's a lot of

817
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.810
literature about it, but I like that. So I

818
00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:20.860
find that thought convincing. And so that's also one

819
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:22.429
of the reasons why I think it's important to

820
00:49:22.439 --> 00:49:24.429
look at the role of technology as a part

821
00:49:24.439 --> 00:49:28.300
of the of the conditions that enable criticism to

822
00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:33.189
become really forceful and to make changes possible. So

823
00:49:33.199 --> 00:49:36.810
I always careful of not giving too much weight

824
00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:39.550
to the role of individual agents in these processes,

825
00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.969
but also to, to look at the these conditions

826
00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:46.050
and these developments that enable the particular agents and

827
00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:52.530
also to make that criticism hurt and so change.

828
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:57.659
So in many ways, our morality and ethics follow

829
00:49:57.669 --> 00:50:02.750
from the material conditions we live in, right? I

830
00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:08.129
mean, it's ideas or even moral ideas specifically are

831
00:50:08.139 --> 00:50:14.395
not just about people thinking about things or rationalizing

832
00:50:14.405 --> 00:50:17.625
things a lot and coming up with new ideas

833
00:50:17.635 --> 00:50:22.665
and then changing societies, sometimes it's material conditions change.

834
00:50:22.675 --> 00:50:25.794
And then because of that people have new ideas

835
00:50:25.804 --> 00:50:28.435
and then I morals change

836
00:50:28.875 --> 00:50:33.264
exactly though this idea of techno change assumes that

837
00:50:33.274 --> 00:50:37.165
it goes both ways. But usually people often just

838
00:50:37.175 --> 00:50:40.510
think about the way that morality or ethical thinking

839
00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:45.110
can in a way influence technological development. Um So

840
00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.659
the whole techno moral change literature focuses on what

841
00:50:47.669 --> 00:50:50.939
they call technology induced moral change. But taking for

842
00:50:50.949 --> 00:50:53.510
granted, there's also the other influence, right? It's not,

843
00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.310
it's not like purely deterministic or saying that these

844
00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.909
conditions determine the development of ethics. But the idea

845
00:51:00.919 --> 00:51:02.669
is more that this has to be taken seriously

846
00:51:02.679 --> 00:51:04.840
that there is this influence. But at the same

847
00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:08.260
time, there is also it goes also the other

848
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:13.639
way. So also our ethical arguments, ideas, experiences have

849
00:51:13.649 --> 00:51:16.250
an influence on those conditions. So it it it's

850
00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:20.120
it's mutual, mutual, very complex I think interaction. Mhm

851
00:51:20.489 --> 00:51:23.929
So I have one last question here. Then still

852
00:51:23.939 --> 00:51:28.149
on the topic of techno moral revolutions or changes

853
00:51:28.439 --> 00:51:31.979
in your work, I read about this term techno,

854
00:51:32.399 --> 00:51:36.070
moral resilience. And also let me read the quote

855
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.879
here since we do not know what elements of

856
00:51:39.889 --> 00:51:44.459
morality will change and how they will change. Moral

857
00:51:44.469 --> 00:51:48.290
education should aim at fo uh fostering what has

858
00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:52.699
been called moral resilience. So could you explain this

859
00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:57.340
idea? What does moral or techno, moral resilience mean?

860
00:51:58.889 --> 00:52:03.510
Yeah. So the idea is that techno or change

861
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.469
or disruption that brings about a lot of uncertainty,

862
00:52:07.479 --> 00:52:12.689
confusion, loss of orientation, that this requires a certain

863
00:52:12.699 --> 00:52:17.300
complex capacity, which my co-author Katarina Ba and I

864
00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:20.699
then termed techno more resilience, we already find in

865
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.709
X Spar's work on techno model change the concept

866
00:52:23.719 --> 00:52:26.300
of moral resilience. But then he doesn't develop that.

867
00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.879
But I think he even says techno model at

868
00:52:27.899 --> 00:52:31.179
some point, but he doesn't really develop that further.

869
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.080
So um the idea is that moral education should

870
00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:41.270
prepare us or should prepare people to cope with

871
00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:45.340
those instances of technological change and disruption. And that

872
00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:50.580
this has basically, yeah, two important elements. One is

873
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:56.209
um the ability to cope with moral disturbances. And

874
00:52:56.219 --> 00:52:57.800
so in a way also to be open to

875
00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:00.580
changes, to be able to adapt, but at the

876
00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:03.510
same time, not to lose one's identity as a

877
00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:08.100
moral agent. So still also maintain like a sort

878
00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:14.449
of a stable identity. Um We argued that this

879
00:53:14.459 --> 00:53:16.739
is something that so we can conceive of this

880
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:20.530
techno resilience as at the individual level, but also

881
00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:25.679
at the systemic or like practice level. And we

882
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:31.760
ar with that in order to foster this capacity

883
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:34.510
that we contact a more resilience, moral education should

884
00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:38.729
focus on a triangle of capacities, namely moral imagination.

885
00:53:38.739 --> 00:53:43.209
Very importantly, the capacity for critical reflection and the

886
00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:46.050
capacity for maintaining one small agency in the face

887
00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:48.949
of disturbances. And I think imagination is really important

888
00:53:48.959 --> 00:53:55.520
though what you need to cope with this phenomenon

889
00:53:55.530 --> 00:54:01.219
of technical change of disruption is to be able

890
00:54:01.229 --> 00:54:05.300
to I think react creatively to those changes. So

891
00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:14.449
to be able to imagine possible scenarios, developments to

892
00:54:14.459 --> 00:54:20.189
um not let yourself completely like despair because of

893
00:54:20.199 --> 00:54:24.360
all the uncertainty but creatively react and that might

894
00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:29.620
also contribute to shaping this techno moral future. So

895
00:54:29.629 --> 00:54:31.820
I I am admittedly itself on a bit vague.

896
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:37.719
Um But yeah, in fact, in fact, it also

897
00:54:37.729 --> 00:54:40.159
was mentioned in the quote that you read out

898
00:54:41.929 --> 00:54:44.389
morality has this dynamic character and we do not

899
00:54:44.399 --> 00:54:46.189
know we know that it can change and it

900
00:54:46.199 --> 00:54:49.280
will change, but we don't know how and we

901
00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:51.600
know by now or at least I believe and

902
00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:55.750
others believe that those changes are intertwined with technological

903
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:58.550
changes. And we know that technology is being developed

904
00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:04.719
like faster, more rapidly, think of artificial intelligence and

905
00:55:04.729 --> 00:55:07.120
all its applications now how much it disrupted our

906
00:55:07.129 --> 00:55:12.729
world already. So it seems that um somehow we

907
00:55:12.739 --> 00:55:16.810
need to try to, to prepare people for that

908
00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:19.520
and also to, to be aware of the fact

909
00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:22.469
that their current, as we talked about that also

910
00:55:22.479 --> 00:55:26.179
earlier in the context of technology, our current moral

911
00:55:26.189 --> 00:55:31.229
and conceptual frameworks, they are not fixed. So it's

912
00:55:31.239 --> 00:55:33.989
in the future, it's not that we have these

913
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.399
fixed frameworks. And with, with those, we will assess

914
00:55:37.409 --> 00:55:42.750
and evaluate future technologies, but those frameworks are changing

915
00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:51.120
themselves. And so sort of develop capacities to, to

916
00:55:51.129 --> 00:55:55.629
nevertheless be able to take a moral stance to

917
00:55:55.639 --> 00:55:58.370
be open also to those changes in those frameworks.

918
00:55:58.379 --> 00:56:02.169
So to keep also reflecting critically upon our moral

919
00:56:02.179 --> 00:56:06.159
concepts and the the standards and concept that we

920
00:56:06.169 --> 00:56:11.979
use to evaluate technological developments and new technologies that

921
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:15.149
are being developed and implemented in our societies.

922
00:56:16.439 --> 00:56:19.120
Yeah, I if I may uh and if you

923
00:56:19.129 --> 00:56:22.110
disagree with, with what I'm about to say, please

924
00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.780
uh tell me so. But uh I think that

925
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:29.219
perhaps uh an example, a good example of um

926
00:56:29.229 --> 00:56:33.580
perhaps uh educationally and also just even outside of

927
00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:38.800
the education system, how uh people could become more

928
00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:42.860
techno moral resilient. I mean, a specific example of

929
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:47.000
that is earlier, we talked about how concepts like

930
00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:52.110
father and mother could be disrupted by Actos technologies.

931
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:55.879
And I mean, I myself personally have sort of

932
00:56:55.889 --> 00:56:59.850
been liberated from this uh from these kinds of

933
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:04.350
concepts by learning more about anthropology because I know

934
00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:09.129
that there are other human societies out there that

935
00:57:09.139 --> 00:57:14.729
do not care much about the nuclear family of

936
00:57:14.739 --> 00:57:20.449
cooper breathing. And I mean, if things change if

937
00:57:20.459 --> 00:57:22.929
uh somewhere in the future, we no longer care

938
00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:27.429
about using concepts like that, like father, mother, whatever,

939
00:57:27.439 --> 00:57:31.040
uh it will not necessarily spell the end of

940
00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:32.820
western civilization.

941
00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:37.780
Let's see. Yes. No, you're right. And in a

942
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:41.790
way, this is also a way of experiencing conceptual

943
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:46.300
disruption when you are learning about very different human

944
00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:51.139
societies where yeah, certain concepts do not play an

945
00:57:51.149 --> 00:57:54.820
important role or have a different meaning that also

946
00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:58.060
has this disruptive effect. So in, in my research

947
00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:01.570
program, we mainly study the disruptive effect that technologies

948
00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:04.620
have on, on some of our fundamental concepts. But

949
00:58:04.629 --> 00:58:07.689
we um we acknowledge that there's also this phenomenon

950
00:58:07.699 --> 00:58:12.510
of disruption that comes from the Yeah, I'm learning

951
00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.330
about those very different societies and cultures.

952
00:58:17.179 --> 00:58:20.699
Yeah. But, but I guess that unfortunately, it's not

953
00:58:20.709 --> 00:58:23.719
something that humans and in this case, it's humans

954
00:58:23.729 --> 00:58:26.969
in general like to do that is teach their

955
00:58:26.979 --> 00:58:31.639
Children that wherever is prevalent in their society is

956
00:58:31.649 --> 00:58:36.014
not necessary with the correct way of doing things

957
00:58:36.024 --> 00:58:41.925
because everywhere people always teach their Children that however

958
00:58:41.935 --> 00:58:46.514
society works is the way it should work unfortunately.

959
00:58:47.084 --> 00:58:50.919
Right. Yeah. Yeah. But of course, I would say

960
00:58:50.929 --> 00:58:53.510
that moral education, which of course is also not

961
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.870
distinct from education in general and it's of course

962
00:58:56.879 --> 00:58:59.199
sort of integrate into that. But what we would

963
00:58:59.209 --> 00:59:02.889
want to call moral education should always aim at

964
00:59:02.899 --> 00:59:06.699
the development of this critical capacity because on the

965
00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:10.320
one hand, when you are in moral upbringing, you

966
00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:13.659
adopt a moral outlook, you are socialized like into

967
00:59:13.669 --> 00:59:18.620
a certain moral community. And you have to also

968
00:59:18.629 --> 00:59:20.870
to be able to develop a moral outlook. I

969
00:59:20.879 --> 00:59:22.620
think in the first place, you need to accept

970
00:59:22.629 --> 00:59:24.979
some norms, you cannot question everything, then you are

971
00:59:24.989 --> 00:59:27.030
unable to make any moral judgments. So you need

972
00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:32.090
to also of course, come to believe many moral

973
00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:36.199
judgments and adopt uh values and norms. But then

974
00:59:36.209 --> 00:59:39.389
at the same time, you also need to, to

975
00:59:39.399 --> 00:59:41.909
become like a competent moral agent, you need to

976
00:59:41.919 --> 00:59:46.330
develop this capacity to critically reflect upon elements, different

977
00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:48.330
elements of that outlook. And then of course, usually

978
00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:52.050
that is prompted through certain experiences where you suddenly

979
00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:55.570
see that a certain norm of value or judgment

980
00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:59.239
is problematic and something that happens when you like

981
00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:02.669
um come into contact with humans that are sites

982
01:00:02.679 --> 01:00:05.360
that have different norms or if you just yeah,

983
01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:11.129
experience cases where there is perhaps in incoherent inconsistency

984
01:00:11.139 --> 01:00:15.159
between some other things that that society believes is

985
01:00:15.169 --> 01:00:17.510
important and good. And that conflicts perhaps with a

986
01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.000
certain norm that is perhaps very old but still

987
01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:23.280
like has an important role because it's it's suggested

988
01:00:23.399 --> 01:00:26.510
generally speaking, being very important. So all these experiences

989
01:00:26.699 --> 01:00:29.510
and I think that is definitely part of moral

990
01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.290
education, this development of this critical capacity. While at

991
01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:37.639
the same time, of course, adopting taking on the

992
01:00:37.649 --> 01:00:42.389
standards and and norms of one particular society

993
01:00:43.489 --> 01:00:46.669
also. Because I I think it is important for

994
01:00:46.679 --> 01:00:50.350
people to develop that sort of moral capacity because

995
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:56.169
it's just inevitable that even during your own lifetime

996
01:00:56.350 --> 01:01:00.120
norms will change in your own society. So I

997
01:01:00.129 --> 01:01:03.610
guess that would even make you more, uh, even,

998
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:09.030
not just morally, but also psychologically more resilient when

999
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.870
faced with those changes. Because as we see many

1000
01:01:12.879 --> 01:01:18.455
times older people, whenever societal norms change, they think

1001
01:01:18.465 --> 01:01:21.274
it's already the, the end of the world and

1002
01:01:21.284 --> 01:01:24.054
they get very confused and stuff like

1003
01:01:24.064 --> 01:01:24.445
that.

1004
01:01:24.584 --> 01:01:24.945
Right.

1005
01:01:25.264 --> 01:01:27.885
Yeah. And I guess that um like with the

1006
01:01:27.895 --> 01:01:30.824
younger generations in their lifetime, the changes are much

1007
01:01:30.834 --> 01:01:34.165
more drastic than they were like when I think

1008
01:01:34.175 --> 01:01:36.445
of my grandmother who indeed also at some point

1009
01:01:36.455 --> 01:01:39.159
had problems like following them things. But I think

1010
01:01:39.169 --> 01:01:42.469
in her lifetime, the changes were much less like

1011
01:01:42.479 --> 01:01:46.330
quick and, and, and radically fargo than what we

1012
01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:49.449
experience and the the younger generations done even more.

1013
01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:54.760
Yeah. So that also means technical resilience becomes more

1014
01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:59.370
and more important because of the acceleration technological development

1015
01:01:59.379 --> 01:02:04.439
and the way it, yeah, really radically changes all

1016
01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.120
like domains of, of our life,

1017
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.060
right. So Doctor Eman, uh just before we go,

1018
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:16.060
would you like to tell people where they can

1019
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:17.939
find your work on the internet?

1020
01:02:18.979 --> 01:02:23.000
Yeah. So um one important source is the book

1021
01:02:23.669 --> 01:02:28.510
Ethics of Socially Disruptive Technologies and introduction that has

1022
01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.510
been published by open book publishers and whether it's

1023
01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:36.949
chapter five on this particular technology, technology, I also

1024
01:02:36.959 --> 01:02:40.929
actually just today posted a blog post of the

1025
01:02:40.939 --> 01:02:43.790
blog and block justice everywhere on this topic. And

1026
01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.239
there are also two previous posts about this technology

1027
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:50.169
that people could read and then there will hopefully

1028
01:02:50.179 --> 01:02:54.979
soon be also more articles on different aspects of

1029
01:02:54.989 --> 01:02:55.989
the technology.

1030
01:02:57.110 --> 01:03:00.449
Great. So I'm leaving links to that in the

1031
01:03:00.459 --> 01:03:03.469
description of the interview. And look, I I really

1032
01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:05.889
love our talks. I love the first one. And

1033
01:03:05.899 --> 01:03:08.280
that's the reason why I wanted to have you

1034
01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:12.260
on the show again to talk just about sative

1035
01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:16.310
technologies and techno moral revolution. So uh thank you

1036
01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.340
so much for your work and thank you for

1037
01:03:18.350 --> 01:03:19.370
coming on the show again.

1038
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:22.030
Thank you very much. Lean. I enjoyed it as

1039
01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.149
well. Thanks a lot.

1040
01:03:24.239 --> 01:03:26.969
