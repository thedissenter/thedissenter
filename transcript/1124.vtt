00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.789
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:06.860
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.979
today I'm joined by two guests. We have here

4
00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:15.100
with us Doctor Miguel Segundoartin. He's a Ramon Icahal

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.129
research fellow in the philosophy department at the University

6
00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:21.139
of Murcia in Spain and a member of the

7
00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:25.290
Minimal intelligence lab or Mint lab there. And we

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.969
also have Doctor Vicente Raja. He's a postdoctoral researcher

9
00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:32.560
at the MIT lab, uh, and a research fellow

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.490
at the University of Murcia as well. And they

11
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.610
are both authors of ecological Psychology, the book we're

12
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.770
going to talk about today. So, Doctor Artin and

13
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.770
Doctor Raja, welcome to the show. It's a huge

14
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.729
pleasure to everyone.

15
00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.759
Thank

16
00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:53.119
you so much. So let's start with perhaps the

17
00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:57.990
most basic question, I guess. What is ecological psychology?

18
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.569
Uh, WELL, this is, this is the The question

19
00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.610
we in some ways we try to develop in

20
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.650
the book, uh, ecological psychology can be seen as

21
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.559
an approach to To understand perception and action so

22
00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:17.809
these aspects of of psychology that has to do

23
00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:21.889
with how how we come to know about our

24
00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:24.730
environment through our senses and how we are able

25
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.900
to organize our behavior with respect to that right

26
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.730
at the same time some people think that it

27
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.650
can be expanded to other uh fields of of

28
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.379
uh of uh psychology to other faculties, you know,

29
00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:41.510
to, to, to other capabilities. And generally speaking, as

30
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.139
a, let's say as a scientific paradigm is uh

31
00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:48.379
is an alternative way to do psychology or to

32
00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.339
do experimental psychology if you compare it to cognitive

33
00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:56.059
psychology, which is the mainstream dominant uh paradigm, uh,

34
00:01:56.419 --> 00:02:01.519
that, you know, it posits some. Different ideas on

35
00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:06.080
how we should approach uh um human psychology and

36
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.480
animal psychology at least.

37
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.229
And I mean, uh, when it comes to a

38
00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:17.910
broader view of psychology, what aspects of psychology does

39
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.789
it apply to or does it apply to all

40
00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:22.229
aspects of psychology?

41
00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:27.529
Um, WELL, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say necessarily all

42
00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:31.210
aspects of psychology, so I don't think that's any.

43
00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:36.419
Ecological psychologists believe that uh ecological psychology can offer

44
00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.500
a theory of everything, again, theory of all aspects

45
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.520
of morcognition. But what is true is that if

46
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.559
you take seriously the principles of ecological psychology and

47
00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:50.479
unless, unless you believe that perception action are enclosed,

48
00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.979
so unless you believe in a highly modular theory

49
00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.399
of cognition in, in which theory of an action

50
00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.720
are just modules that are isolated from other faculties,

51
00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.399
it means that, unless you believe that, I mean.

52
00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:04.750
Uh, IF you don't believe that, then it means

53
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.910
that the principles you apply, uh, to explain perceptual

54
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.750
action from an ecological perspective should apply also to

55
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.160
other co faculties. So, I mean, for example, the

56
00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:19.910
non-brain syncentrism, the embodied approach, the idea that the,

57
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.550
actually your, your interaction with the environment, your embodied

58
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.869
interaction with the environment changes the cognitive process and

59
00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.710
makes it possible that some cognitive activities appear or

60
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.080
emerge in some systems. For example, the, the idea

61
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.559
that uh you interact with rich information, so you

62
00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:40.399
don't need to uh make uh internal inferences or

63
00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:42.800
internal models of the, of the environment. Also the

64
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.880
mathematical tools used to explain in cognition, for example,

65
00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.240
in Ecodega psychology, the use of uh dynamical systems

66
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.360
theory or the use of time series analysis. So

67
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.110
there are, I, I, I believe there are consequences

68
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.360
for how you explain or how you understand the

69
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.240
mind and cognition outside of perception and action if

70
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.119
you already are an ecological psychologist.

71
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.750
Right. And later on, we're going to get into

72
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.860
how it applies to perception and action and also

73
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.080
into a little bit into an embodied cognition and

74
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.350
dynamical systems theory. But for now, let me ask

75
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.988
you uh uh another thing. So, uh, would you

76
00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:22.149
like to tell us a little bit about the

77
00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:25.390
history of ecological psychology that is something that you

78
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.350
also go through in the book? I mean, how

79
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.070
did the discipline develop?

80
00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:33.839
Yeah, um, I think it's an interesting history actually.

81
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.549
I, I, I refer to it, uh, as the,

82
00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:41.320
as, um, the last instance or, or, or, or

83
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.510
one of the latest instances of the other psychology.

84
00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:49.959
If you see the, the typical roots of psychology

85
00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:54.420
as a science since it, since it started. Um,

86
00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:57.750
IN the last part of the 19th century, you

87
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.329
see, you know, it's like, it's bound and James,

88
00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:05.309
structuralism, functionalism, and then behaviorism takes it all until

89
00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.549
the 50s, 60s, especially, you know, where the cognitive

90
00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:12.880
revolution happens. And we are still within that cognitive

91
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.869
psychology. We know, uh, the, the particular paradigms change

92
00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:21.350
like we talk now more about the Bayesian brain

93
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.079
and that kind of thing, right? But it's still

94
00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:26.920
within the, the context of a cognitive psychology. But

95
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.989
if you explore history. Uh, THERE'S has always been

96
00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:35.369
an alternative. Psychology. So some different ways to do

97
00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:38.649
psychology that run parallel to the mainstream that are

98
00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:41.890
small, right? But they are still there. And I

99
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.700
think ecological psychology is one of them and you

100
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.809
can trace it back to, to William James, actually

101
00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:50.529
to some of the, some of the things William

102
00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.929
James uh postulates in the principles of psychology, but

103
00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:56.929
also later on in his essays of in in

104
00:05:56.929 --> 00:06:01.850
radical empiricism. Uh, THERE'S a fantastic book by Harry

105
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.290
Heft called Ecological Psychology in a context that explores

106
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.880
all this in very, very, uh, nice, uh, uh,

107
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.170
detail, but, you know, like, uh, James Gibson that

108
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.890
along with the Leonard Gibsons are the two founding

109
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.609
figures of the, of the disciplines. James Gibson got

110
00:06:19.609 --> 00:06:24.760
his PhD in the 1920s in um uh Princeton

111
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.649
under the mentorship of IB Holt. That considered himself

112
00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:34.010
a radical empressist and was himself a student of

113
00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.579
of William James. So there's a very clear historical

114
00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:40.700
root there and then what James Gibson was trying

115
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.179
to do again along with Eleanor Gibson, um, was

116
00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:48.619
trying to develop a kind of a scientific theory

117
00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:53.950
of radical empiricism, right? And Many things happened there,

118
00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:57.420
right? Uh, ONE very important thing is that, uh,

119
00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:01.869
James Gibson was recruited by the US Army to

120
00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:06.109
teach pilots uh on how to land and in

121
00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:09.709
trying to develop resources to do so he understood

122
00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:14.309
that the classical psychophysics experiment on, on experiments on

123
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:17.429
uh perception didn't work and so he needed to

124
00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:23.459
explore other, other. Alternative to actually uh uh provide

125
00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:28.420
some tools that actually work in how um pilots

126
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.570
learn, right? So in that, that happens during, during,

127
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.899
during the 40s, he writes his, his, his first

128
00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:37.779
book in the 1950s, still kind of in the

129
00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:41.290
mainstream side of things, but already with some tweaks.

130
00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:46.100
And in, in his second book in 1966, uh

131
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.170
he is already very well into. Uh, THE ecological

132
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.519
approach basically rejecting, uh, two main ideas, right? The,

133
00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.079
on the one hand, the idea that uh stimulation

134
00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:04.109
is poor, right? That, that, that we don't get

135
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.480
uh information enough through our senses as to guide

136
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.290
our behavior so we need to enrich it internally

137
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:14.440
somehow. And that visual perception starts with the retinal

138
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.609
image, right? That we have some kind of small

139
00:08:17.609 --> 00:08:21.619
picture of uh the world in, in our retina

140
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.820
and then uh we manipulate it until, until, uh,

141
00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:28.869
it, it serves us to know our environment, right?

142
00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:32.729
Uh. At the same time, Eleanor Gibson is already

143
00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:37.280
taking care of the, of, of, of perceptual learning

144
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.609
development has a book in 1969, right? So there

145
00:08:40.609 --> 00:08:45.479
are a few things there. And Things evolve until

146
00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:49.239
James dead uh right after he published or uh

147
00:08:49.239 --> 00:08:51.679
or around the time he published his last book

148
00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:55.200
in 1979, and then there's a group of few

149
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.760
psychologists uh that take over that enterprise during the

150
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.400
80s, the 190s, and now. So that's kind of

151
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.479
the, a rough sketch of how things developed.

152
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.400
Yes, of course, we don't have uh enough time

153
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.150
to go into much detail here. But uh let

154
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.080
me ask you still on the same topic, how

155
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.880
does ecological psychology relate to other schools of psychology

156
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.119
like Gestalt psychology, phenomenology, and behaviorism?

157
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.469
Yeah, well, that's, that's certainly part of the, of

158
00:09:33.469 --> 00:09:36.669
the history that Vicente was telling, right? So, first

159
00:09:36.669 --> 00:09:39.109
of all, I mean, we need to understand that

160
00:09:39.109 --> 00:09:42.179
uh both James and E Gibson that they studied

161
00:09:42.179 --> 00:09:46.270
as Partly as behaviorists, partly as guesttal psychologists because

162
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.909
they were, there were, they were the main uh

163
00:09:48.909 --> 00:09:50.510
part in psychology when they started in the, in

164
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.700
the 20, in the 20s and, and 30s, right?

165
00:09:53.469 --> 00:09:55.679
So they both studied under the uh under the

166
00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:59.080
mentorship of uh behaviorist. James in the case of

167
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.200
Evie Hall, which is a strange behaviorist more probably

168
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.890
closer to uh James radical um radical impre than,

169
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.229
than probably behaviorism, but Edie Holt actually considered himself

170
00:10:10.229 --> 00:10:14.690
a behaviorist of sorts. Um, uh, Eleanor Gibson and,

171
00:10:14.719 --> 00:10:17.070
and the the mentorship of Clark Hall, which is

172
00:10:17.599 --> 00:10:21.460
actually uh one of the Uh, most recognized behavior

173
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.260
figures. The thing with behaviorism is, uh something that

174
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.559
we say, we try to say in the book

175
00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:27.979
even though we don't have time, we don't have

176
00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:29.700
space because a very short book is that behaviorism

177
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.219
is, is not a molytic thing. It's very difficult

178
00:10:32.219 --> 00:10:34.659
to speak of behaviorism as a, as one thing.

179
00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:37.500
I mean, the behaviorism of Watson is not the

180
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.820
same as the behaviorism of Skinner, not the same

181
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.219
as Tollman, not the same as, as Halls, not

182
00:10:42.219 --> 00:10:47.239
the same as Thorndykes, yada yada. So. It's difficult

183
00:10:47.239 --> 00:10:51.840
to, uh, to pinpoint one single behaviorist theory to

184
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.380
which ecological psychology is indeed, but it's clear that

185
00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.119
uh both James and, and Eleanor Gibson recognize themselves

186
00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:04.880
as, uh, uh. Behaviorist of some, of some kind

187
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.349
and actually in the, in the autobiography of Gibson,

188
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.679
he mentions that he's a something I was a,

189
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.070
a behaviorist like Holt and uh Eleanor was a

190
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.239
Hallen uh behaviorist and then actually the ideas of

191
00:11:17.239 --> 00:11:21.500
behaviorism that that remains in the ecological tradition. Uh,

192
00:11:22.119 --> 00:11:24.919
THEN there's Gestalt, there's obviously, I mean, uh, I

193
00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:27.559
think that Gibson, uh, did his PhD on, on

194
00:11:27.559 --> 00:11:29.530
Gestalt, right, didn't, so he was, his PhD was

195
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:33.070
trying to criticize. Uh, SOME ideas of, of Gestalt,

196
00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:35.229
but there are some ideas of Galt that also

197
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.880
stayed in the ecological approach. For example, and in

198
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.119
the book, we, we say that this idea that

199
00:11:40.549 --> 00:11:42.880
information is structured and the idea of uh, of

200
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.109
uh energy arrays is actually a Gestalt idea. The

201
00:11:46.109 --> 00:11:49.419
difference that uh James Gibson didn't believe that information

202
00:11:49.419 --> 00:11:53.070
or uh uh structure wasn't inside. He thought that

203
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.039
the structure was outside and we could actually access

204
00:11:56.039 --> 00:11:58.200
this. So this is kind of a realist twist.

205
00:11:58.809 --> 00:12:01.950
To, to Gestalt. And there's the last element which

206
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.469
is uh phenomenology, which is probably the most elusive

207
00:12:05.469 --> 00:12:07.469
in a way because it's difficult to find real

208
00:12:07.469 --> 00:12:11.950
references or, or precise reference to um phenomenology in

209
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.830
the, in the ecological tradition unless in the early

210
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.390
ecological tradition, the one by, by Eleanor and, and

211
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.929
James Gibson. But there are some others like, for

212
00:12:20.929 --> 00:12:23.909
example, Semiro and Koer who actually say that there

213
00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:26.669
is evidence that James Gibson read, for example, Merlo

214
00:12:26.669 --> 00:12:30.390
Ponti's uh pheromology of Perception, which is actually a

215
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.429
book in, uh, in the philosophical tradition in phenomenology

216
00:12:33.429 --> 00:12:36.869
that um emphasized the role of the body in

217
00:12:36.869 --> 00:12:39.349
how we experience the world. So there's probably a,

218
00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:42.940
a connection there or, or some, some sort of,

219
00:12:42.989 --> 00:12:47.820
of um friendship uh that James Gibson detected there

220
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.289
with the phenological tradition too. Now, and we speak

221
00:12:51.289 --> 00:12:55.229
now of uh contemporary ecological psychologists. There is a,

222
00:12:55.289 --> 00:13:00.250
a lot of uh um work of current ecological

223
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.729
psychologists looking at the phenomenology, for example, like Tony

224
00:13:02.729 --> 00:13:04.650
Semero is a, is a good example of, of

225
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.070
uh an ecological psychology figure that tried to bridges,

226
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:12.010
uh, phenomenology, especially Heidegger and Merlo Ponti with uh

227
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:13.369
contemporary ecological psychology.

228
00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:17.659
Right. So, let me ask you now a little

229
00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:21.010
bit about perception and action, because in the book,

230
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.299
you actually focus on ecological psychology as an approach

231
00:13:25.299 --> 00:13:29.539
to perception and action. But before we get into

232
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.570
this specifically and how it applies there, what are

233
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.380
the main theories of perception and action that we

234
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.659
have apart from ecological psychology?

235
00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:47.140
Um, I guess from, from From our point of

236
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.109
view, from the view from the view from here,

237
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.789
so to speak, from, from the, from the ecological

238
00:13:52.789 --> 00:13:58.059
approach, there's basically one with little variations, right? Uh,

239
00:13:58.109 --> 00:13:59.950
AND the one is the one that has to

240
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:04.830
do with cognitive psychology, right? Uh, THAT basically tells

241
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.239
you a story about something like an input output

242
00:14:08.239 --> 00:14:11.710
system, right, in which you get the input. Again,

243
00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:15.609
it reaches your retina in case of, of, of

244
00:14:15.609 --> 00:14:20.359
visual perception, right? And it goes inside and, and

245
00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:22.510
it's kind of, you know, that input which is

246
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:27.039
this, the stimulus is somehow not good enough as

247
00:14:27.039 --> 00:14:30.780
to support a proper perception of the environment. So

248
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.000
internally somehow, and we will bracket this because that

249
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.159
somehow can mean different things. Uh, IT gets enriched,

250
00:14:39.469 --> 00:14:45.900
enriched, manipulated, uh, changed, reshaped to the point that

251
00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.630
now we have an internal model, a mental representation

252
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.549
of the external. Environment that is very difficult in

253
00:14:53.549 --> 00:14:56.150
some ways, right, at least in the, in the,

254
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.909
in the relevant ways and that then can be

255
00:14:58.909 --> 00:15:05.669
used to To to be uh retrieved by another

256
00:15:05.669 --> 00:15:08.919
part of the brain and then the that other

257
00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:12.429
part can execute or can send some motor commands,

258
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.239
say, right, as for the body to move in

259
00:15:15.239 --> 00:15:18.039
such and such a way given that the environment

260
00:15:18.039 --> 00:15:21.229
is that way that's kind of the input output

261
00:15:21.599 --> 00:15:28.469
uh system with. Cognition in the center and perception

262
00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:32.809
and action being part of that uh central system

263
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.299
that basically uh are in, are in the business

264
00:15:37.299 --> 00:15:41.979
of constructing a verical model of the environment. And

265
00:15:41.979 --> 00:15:45.179
how it can be done, it can be kind

266
00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:48.140
of bottom up, you know, that you just retrieving

267
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.090
more and more information and mixing it with memory,

268
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.619
past experience to do so. It can be in

269
00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:57.260
a predictive way, right, with a generative model and

270
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.604
just trying to, to shape. That model in such

271
00:16:00.604 --> 00:16:04.744
a way that actually reflects the latent variables of,

272
00:16:04.775 --> 00:16:08.205
of, of, of, of uh stimulation, right? But that's

273
00:16:08.205 --> 00:16:11.325
it. That's the thing that happens inside and it's

274
00:16:11.325 --> 00:16:13.085
in the business of building up a model of

275
00:16:13.085 --> 00:16:15.565
the environment such that that model can be used.

276
00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.820
Uh, uh, AS a, as a reference to execute

277
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:20.380
actions.

278
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.979
Uh, AND what are some of the most important

279
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:29.349
concepts to understand perception and the action from the

280
00:16:29.349 --> 00:16:32.309
perspective of ecological psychology?

281
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.830
Well, I would say that the most important one

282
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.789
is something that we try to, to emphasize in

283
00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:40.989
the book is the notion of information. So for

284
00:16:40.989 --> 00:16:44.750
us, the real game changer that ecological psychology brings

285
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:48.260
up and brings you to um psychology is information.

286
00:16:48.429 --> 00:16:52.179
So if you believe that there is actually rich

287
00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:53.750
information in the environment in the structure of the

288
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.369
light or instructural sound or in, in, in, in

289
00:16:57.669 --> 00:17:01.219
your skin intact. Then the richer the information there

290
00:17:01.219 --> 00:17:04.160
is outside. So the more possibility you have to

291
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.660
gather information, the less you need to build it

292
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.618
inside. So that's, this is the main idea of

293
00:17:09.618 --> 00:17:13.939
ecolega psychology. So if internal models were introduced as

294
00:17:13.939 --> 00:17:18.280
an explanatory posit to compensate for the Uh, impoverishment

295
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.920
for the poverty of the stimulus. If you don't

296
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.640
think that the stimulus is that poor, so you

297
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.319
think the stimulus is rich, then it seems that

298
00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.479
you don't need the second explanatory step of positive

299
00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:29.880
internal models. So for us, the real game changer

300
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.270
is the notion of information. And then the, the

301
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.599
second idea I think is the notion of embodiment.

302
00:17:37.069 --> 00:17:39.270
And it means two different things. Well, you perceive

303
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.189
that, so you gather the information, you perceive the

304
00:17:41.189 --> 00:17:43.069
world through your body. So the fact that you

305
00:17:43.069 --> 00:17:45.670
have this specific body means that you will occupy,

306
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.430
for example, some point of views, like taller or

307
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.300
shorter, whatever, but also it means that you can

308
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.310
explore this information. So you have to move, you

309
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.630
can generate new information, you can discover invariant properties.

310
00:17:56.719 --> 00:18:01.829
In this information, etc. So, uh, real life exploration

311
00:18:01.829 --> 00:18:04.030
with your body is an essential aspect of how

312
00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.229
you perceive the environment. And it's something that you

313
00:18:06.229 --> 00:18:08.819
see in, in, in nature, right? So, when people

314
00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:11.949
are, or when animals, for example, are unsure about

315
00:18:11.949 --> 00:18:14.709
uh relative distance, for example, they move to generate

316
00:18:14.709 --> 00:18:19.150
motion parallax. So moving actually is an, a strategy

317
00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.229
to perceive distance in this case, right? And then

318
00:18:22.229 --> 00:18:27.089
the Probably the, the, the third most important concept,

319
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.930
I don't know if you disagrees, we probably have

320
00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.369
affordances, which is a concept that was introduced by

321
00:18:31.369 --> 00:18:34.410
ecological psychologists. Nowadays it is used in many other

322
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.569
paradigms because in a way, affordances are not necessarily

323
00:18:37.569 --> 00:18:41.489
conceptually tied to ecological psychology. So affordances are opportunities

324
00:18:41.489 --> 00:18:44.900
for interaction and as such, they can be accommodated

325
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.199
in different frameworks, but what ecological psychologists believe is

326
00:18:48.199 --> 00:18:52.310
that Through detected information, you perceive affordances. I mean,

327
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.959
through detected information, you are able to visual to

328
00:18:54.959 --> 00:18:58.079
perceive, not visual, right, you're able to perceive what

329
00:18:58.079 --> 00:19:00.160
you can do in the environment. For example, how

330
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.760
you can control your behavior to get to um

331
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.290
catch the bottle or avoid an obstacle or um

332
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.500
Uh, duck, uh, uh, you know, in, in a,

333
00:19:09.579 --> 00:19:11.939
in a fist fight, whatever. So, for me, those

334
00:19:11.939 --> 00:19:14.660
are probably the three most important concepts. I don't

335
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.020
know if Vicente would add any other.

336
00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:19.459
Um, NO, yeah, I think, I think this is,

337
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.939
these are the core things and I think all

338
00:19:21.939 --> 00:19:26.510
of them uh together gives you the, the essence

339
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.300
of the approach which sometimes is referred to as

340
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:34.790
direct perception. Which is usually misinterpreted, uh, basically means

341
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.709
that if there's information enough in, in the, in

342
00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:39.989
the energy arrays that surround you, you know, light,

343
00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:45.469
chemicals, whatever, uh, you don't need, uh, some mediating

344
00:19:45.469 --> 00:19:50.699
steps in order to, to perceive your Environment so

345
00:19:50.699 --> 00:19:53.859
in that sense you are, you are directly connected

346
00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:56.099
to your, to your, to your, to your environment

347
00:19:56.099 --> 00:19:58.469
through your senses and not, you know, and not

348
00:19:58.469 --> 00:20:00.989
through a representation internal model, etc.

349
00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.410
OK. So could you tell us just a little

350
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:11.000
bit more about affordances because for people who might

351
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.930
not be familiar with these kinds of concepts, I

352
00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:18.969
mean, what are affordances exactly to explain them a

353
00:20:18.969 --> 00:20:19.839
little bit more.

354
00:20:20.569 --> 00:20:25.000
And affordance, uh, according to James Gibson is an

355
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.119
opportunity of interaction with the environment. So, uh, you

356
00:20:30.119 --> 00:20:32.079
can think about it like among the things that

357
00:20:32.079 --> 00:20:37.280
we, that we perceive, you know, uh, let's, let's

358
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.280
be pluralistic here, right? We are able to perceive

359
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.189
things, right, uh, chairs, uh, uh, TVs, whatever things,

360
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.680
right, but among the things that we perceive are

361
00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.560
the things that we can do with things, right?

362
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.969
So I, uh, perceive this glass and I also

363
00:20:53.969 --> 00:20:57.859
perceive that they can uh grab it, right? I,

364
00:20:57.939 --> 00:21:00.300
I, I perceive a door and I can see

365
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.060
whether I can open it or not, right? That

366
00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.619
kind of thing. So the things I can do

367
00:21:04.619 --> 00:21:10.109
with. The with the elements around me are affordances,

368
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.270
right? I can step in uh the ground. I

369
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:17.310
can walk through the ground but not through water,

370
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:22.630
right? So, uh, the ground is walkable, uh, it

371
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:27.589
affords walkability while, uh, uh, water doesn't for us,

372
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.630
right? There are some other organisms that that that

373
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:33.959
can actually walk there, right? So those are affordances,

374
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.849
right? The things we can do with things and

375
00:21:36.849 --> 00:21:40.849
according to ecological psychologists, we can perceive them and

376
00:21:40.849 --> 00:21:46.099
we can perceive them without. The need to do

377
00:21:46.099 --> 00:21:49.829
any the any, any inferential steps. So it's not

378
00:21:49.829 --> 00:21:53.310
that we perceive the object and somehow then we

379
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:57.589
do other mental operations, so we infer that we

380
00:21:57.589 --> 00:22:01.290
can do something with that object. But that we

381
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.599
directly uh perceive what we can do with things.

382
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:08.520
Again directly here means that there's information enough in

383
00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.010
the surrounding energies of the, of the organism in

384
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.489
light, in uh chemicals in air that tell us,

385
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:19.599
hey, you can do this. Basically, and those are

386
00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:21.199
the affordances, the things you can do around you.

387
00:22:22.069 --> 00:22:25.069
OK. So, let, let me ask you now a

388
00:22:25.069 --> 00:22:28.030
little bit about embodied cognition. In what way is

389
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.140
the psychological psychology connect to it?

390
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:38.500
Well, I would say that, uh, historically speaking, Ecological

391
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.810
psychology probably invented embody cognition for psychology. I mean,

392
00:22:42.859 --> 00:22:48.839
the first scientific theory in psychology that We can

393
00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:50.719
say it's actually an embodied theory of cognition. It's

394
00:22:50.719 --> 00:22:53.489
probably ego a psychology in, in, so it doesn't,

395
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.199
so the one that really is the first that

396
00:22:56.199 --> 00:22:58.489
takes the body seriously so that the body is

397
00:22:58.489 --> 00:23:01.920
part, is part of this planetary uh uh machinery

398
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.670
of the theory is ecological psychology and body cognition.

399
00:23:06.459 --> 00:23:09.449
It's something that emerged later, but the first instance

400
00:23:09.449 --> 00:23:13.369
of that, it, it's probably like a psychology. No,

401
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.130
I would say that. For example, I mean, the,

402
00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.930
in the 90s, uh there's this book by Elena

403
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:23.209
Roche, uh Evantonsson and Abella was the Embodied Mind,

404
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.500
which is the, the, I think it's one of

405
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.239
the first book that starts speaking about embody cognition,

406
00:23:27.609 --> 00:23:30.170
but Ecodea psychology was in, uh, was already in

407
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:34.619
the 60s and in '79 or so it's. So

408
00:23:34.619 --> 00:23:37.339
historically speaking, I would say that Ecoleca is the

409
00:23:37.339 --> 00:23:41.380
first embodied theory of commission that there is.

410
00:23:43.229 --> 00:23:45.739
Uh, AND by the way, does it also relate

411
00:23:45.739 --> 00:23:50.069
to the other three E of 4E cognition and

412
00:23:50.069 --> 00:23:54.430
embedded, uh, extended and enacted cognition or is it

413
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.869
just with embodied cognition?

414
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.290
I'm, I, I like these questions because I have

415
00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:06.069
uh ongoing discussions with many friends about the 4E,

416
00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:10.420
right, uh, which is embodied, embedded and acted, extended

417
00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:15.359
something like that and I don't like that name,

418
00:24:15.609 --> 00:24:19.050
uh, in, in, and, uh, and this is only

419
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.209
my opinion. I, this doesn't mean it's Miguel's opinion

420
00:24:22.209 --> 00:24:25.060
too, uh, uh, I think you, did you, did

421
00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.599
you, you, you only need one E which is

422
00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:31.790
ecological actually, right? I mean. What other aspects of,

423
00:24:31.819 --> 00:24:34.520
of the ecological approach that we have maybe not

424
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.890
stressed enough, is that for ecological psychologists, the Psychological

425
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.959
unit. So the, the, the, the, the unit you,

426
00:24:42.969 --> 00:24:44.969
you need to look at in order to understand

427
00:24:44.969 --> 00:24:48.930
psychological process is the organist environment system. So when

428
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.250
you try to understand perception action, you don't look

429
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.689
just at the organism. You look at the organism

430
00:24:54.689 --> 00:24:57.650
environment system as a whole, right? As a self-organized

431
00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.939
whole that, that exhibits that, that kind of thing.

432
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.319
But once you have that, once you have that

433
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:12.430
approach, you are by default. Embodied, embedded, extended and,

434
00:25:12.439 --> 00:25:15.160
and, and as Miguel has been saying action is

435
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.560
a central part of it moving around is a

436
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.920
central part of it. You are also an active.

437
00:25:20.939 --> 00:25:24.280
So basically, ecological psychology 1 E.

438
00:25:25.369 --> 00:25:28.459
Uh, TO rule them all, to rule them all.

439
00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:31.150
Uh,

440
00:25:32.439 --> 00:25:35.079
YEAH, you know, once you, once you take, so

441
00:25:35.079 --> 00:25:38.390
to speak, the ecological stance, you are by default

442
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.020
embodied embedded and active and extended.

443
00:25:43.449 --> 00:25:47.800
Uh, BUT, uh, I mean, uh, when you, when

444
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.920
you mentioned ecological psychology as an E, I mean,

445
00:25:52.079 --> 00:25:54.199
would it be 1/5 E

446
00:25:54.199 --> 00:25:57.079
or just, just one e we take off the

447
00:25:57.079 --> 00:26:01.359
other 4 and cognition.

448
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.560
OK,

449
00:26:06.489 --> 00:26:07.619
OK, fair, to be fair, I, I, I, I

450
00:26:07.619 --> 00:26:12.520
mean, I'm, I think, um. Just to, just to

451
00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.599
give a point of, of the, of the sociology

452
00:26:14.599 --> 00:26:19.699
of science here. Uh, TO be fair, ecological psychologists

453
00:26:19.699 --> 00:26:22.390
and, and activists, and people that work in these

454
00:26:22.739 --> 00:26:25.300
paradigms are kind of in a, in a, in

455
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.339
a, in a, in a, in a great great

456
00:26:28.339 --> 00:26:31.979
minority, right? And we sometimes spend a lot of

457
00:26:31.979 --> 00:26:36.420
time arguing among us on how to be a

458
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.900
good an activist or a good ecological psychologist and

459
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.280
how we are different from each other. So many

460
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.180
times I just uh refer to all of us

461
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.089
as radical embodiment. Um, JUST to try to be

462
00:26:49.089 --> 00:26:52.089
open, of course we disagree and, and if we

463
00:26:52.089 --> 00:26:55.930
sit with an activist, we, we are going to

464
00:26:55.930 --> 00:27:01.060
disagree about this, this, this and that. But generally

465
00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.000
speaking, you know, like we are very few people,

466
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.750
so maybe 5 Es or whatever is you wanna

467
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.839
have, but it's better that we work together than

468
00:27:10.839 --> 00:27:11.680
against each other.

469
00:27:13.069 --> 00:27:17.869
Yeah, by the way, explain that radical embodiment, right?

470
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.270
What what does that mean?

471
00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.969
Um, I, I mean, um, this is, this comes

472
00:27:23.969 --> 00:27:28.479
from, uh, uh, to me, basically from Tony Chamero's

473
00:27:28.479 --> 00:27:31.969
book Radical Embodied Cognitive Science. Uh, Tony Chamero is,

474
00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.479
is, is, is my PhD advisor, right? So I'm

475
00:27:34.479 --> 00:27:38.000
very influenced by him. But in this book, uh,

476
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.920
Tony recovers that, that phrase, right, radical embodied cognitive

477
00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:47.619
science from Andy Clark. Andy Clark, uh, before said,

478
00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.459
you have people that do, uh, embodied cognitive science

479
00:27:52.459 --> 00:27:56.949
like, like, like Andy Clark himself, and then you

480
00:27:56.949 --> 00:28:00.260
might have other people who do radical things, right?

481
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.060
But he was like, we don't know if Anybody

482
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.910
is doing this. And then Tony's book is like,

483
00:28:05.989 --> 00:28:08.229
no, look, there are people that have been doing

484
00:28:08.229 --> 00:28:11.260
radical embodied cognitive science for the last 40 years,

485
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.270
and those are ecological psychologists and at least some

486
00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:19.589
an activists, right? And, and, and Tony develops why

487
00:28:19.589 --> 00:28:22.530
he thinks that and, and that's and he actually

488
00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:27.349
explicitly tries to, to build bridges between, you know,

489
00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:31.800
ecological psychology and activists and maybe some other, uh.

490
00:28:32.459 --> 00:28:37.790
Radical, uh, approaches to embody the cognition. So I,

491
00:28:38.069 --> 00:28:40.719
so I thought that radical embodiment is a good

492
00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:44.390
umbrella term, uh, for all of us, right? uh,

493
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.589
BECAUSE it doesn't point to any of us. It

494
00:28:47.829 --> 00:28:54.050
doesn't require, uh, you know, uh. 100 words to

495
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.390
explain who we are or like, and I think

496
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:58.579
it's a, it's a good thing. So to be

497
00:28:58.579 --> 00:29:05.930
radically embodied in In summary just means that you,

498
00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:10.390
you not only think that the body uh influences

499
00:29:10.579 --> 00:29:16.810
uh uh cognition you think that body and environment

500
00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:23.020
are substantive uh considerative parts of the cognitive system.

501
00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.400
I know that uh constituive here can be a

502
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.920
little bit uh tricky, but the thing is that

503
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.719
when you think about the cognitive system, you think

504
00:29:31.719 --> 00:29:33.939
about the brain-body environment system. Hm.

505
00:29:34.959 --> 00:29:36.359
And I'll tell you about the, if, if you

506
00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:38.079
allow me, so about the, the whole point of,

507
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.839
of radical embodiment. So there are two ways to

508
00:29:40.839 --> 00:29:44.819
approach that. So there is one way to Characterize

509
00:29:44.819 --> 00:29:48.140
radical embodied cognitive science that is purely negative, which

510
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:51.300
is where, well, it's people doing ego psycho doing

511
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.760
science without representation. So it's kind of a characterizing

512
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.619
radical embodiment by what we are not doing according

513
00:29:58.619 --> 00:30:01.939
to some people. But actually something that Vicente and

514
00:30:01.939 --> 00:30:04.430
I try to defend and we defend. We have

515
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:07.079
done in many different, uh, with audiences that no,

516
00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.359
actually doing radical embolic cognition, uh, implies a lot

517
00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:12.119
of positive things that we do, a lot of

518
00:30:12.119 --> 00:30:14.150
new expiratory methods. So it's not that we are

519
00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.619
doing traditional uh cocis without our representations, that we

520
00:30:17.619 --> 00:30:20.660
are introducing new methods. That are not there and

521
00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.219
were not dead in the 80s, 90s. I mean,

522
00:30:23.739 --> 00:30:25.920
there, I mean, the, the classical co science. I

523
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.939
mean, you take uh a textbook on co science

524
00:30:28.939 --> 00:30:30.939
nowadays, I, I mean, I'm, now I have one

525
00:30:30.939 --> 00:30:32.770
in front of me. You open it and you

526
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:35.060
don't see anything of that. So what we are

527
00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.180
not doing, so we're not doing just traditional code

528
00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.689
signs with uh mental maps or, or uh mental

529
00:30:41.689 --> 00:30:46.020
observations. We're actually introducing new explanatory methods and uh

530
00:30:46.339 --> 00:30:49.989
techniques of analysis. That's. NEEDED to be recognized as

531
00:30:49.989 --> 00:30:50.510
well, I think.

532
00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:56.270
Right, and all the psychological psychology relate then to

533
00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.760
dynamical systems theory.

534
00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.680
Well it's probably more a question for Vicente, which

535
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.489
is the expert on dynamical

536
00:31:04.489 --> 00:31:11.410
systems. This is, this also has a story, uh,

537
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:16.130
you know, during, during, during, during the 70s, a

538
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:20.319
few young scholars at the time uh were related

539
00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:23.520
to James uh Gibson, you know, like postdocs or,

540
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:27.310
you know, or research visitors and that stuff. Uh,

541
00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.939
TWO of them were, for instance, Dave Lee, who

542
00:31:30.939 --> 00:31:33.770
afterwards worked at the University of Edinburgh and is

543
00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:36.780
the main developer of, uh, of the tau theory,

544
00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.449
which is one of the main, uh, theories within,

545
00:31:39.459 --> 00:31:43.069
within the ecological approach, but also Michael Tarvie, uh,

546
00:31:43.339 --> 00:31:46.650
who is basically the leading figure of ecological psychology

547
00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:51.380
after Gibson and And after, after he died like

548
00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.760
a couple of years ago, actually last year, uh,

549
00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.670
why, why, while we were writing the book actually,

550
00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:03.280
um, um. And both of them, but especially Michael

551
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.930
Tarvie was interested in motor control. Gibson was also

552
00:32:09.089 --> 00:32:13.760
Interested in motor control in action, but he was

553
00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.569
leaning towards uh perception more while Michael Tarvi was

554
00:32:18.569 --> 00:32:22.380
someone that who came from motor control to ecological

555
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:26.609
psychology and he already came uh being kind of

556
00:32:26.609 --> 00:32:32.530
a uh um dissident within the motor control uh

557
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:37.449
community because he was very. Interested on um in

558
00:32:37.449 --> 00:32:40.369
a theory by Nicola Burstein, which is a Russian

559
00:32:40.369 --> 00:32:47.290
uh physiologist, uh, that thinks basically that, uh. Motor

560
00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:51.250
behavior is some, to some degree self-organized and not

561
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:55.170
fully commanded from, from, from uh the brain and

562
00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.890
you know, there's, it is coordinated before it gets

563
00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.770
commanded. You know, there are a few, a few

564
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.650
things there that, that, that I don't want to

565
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.849
get into but the, but the main idea is

566
00:33:06.849 --> 00:33:11.729
that this idea that Uh, motor control is to

567
00:33:11.729 --> 00:33:16.170
some degree self-organized between brain, body, and environment fits

568
00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:18.770
very well with the, with the, with the organized

569
00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.280
environment system and with the ecological approach in which,

570
00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:25.170
you know, our psychological features are also self-organized in

571
00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:29.250
some ways, right? So with Michaelar be coming into

572
00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.609
this, uh, they were trying to find new methods.

573
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.189
And it started in the late 70s, they start

574
00:33:36.189 --> 00:33:39.520
thinking about synergies, which is our com are this

575
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.000
kind of self-organized uh combination of parts within the

576
00:33:43.239 --> 00:33:45.910
brain body environment system. Uh THEY call them at,

577
00:33:45.959 --> 00:33:50.479
at the beginning um uh coordinative structures and they

578
00:33:50.479 --> 00:33:54.359
are starting to try to find mathematical tools to

579
00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:57.910
deal with them. Uh, AND in this uh context,

580
00:33:58.119 --> 00:34:01.479
uh, some other figures get into that. Peter Kugler

581
00:34:01.479 --> 00:34:06.069
is very important, uh, Scott Kelso, it's also um

582
00:34:06.199 --> 00:34:08.879
works with ecological psychologists in the, in the, in,

583
00:34:08.958 --> 00:34:12.340
in the early 80s developing these ideas, although he

584
00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.739
then goes his own way, some ways. And yeah,

585
00:34:15.879 --> 00:34:18.958
during the 80s, they find that dynamical systems, which

586
00:34:18.958 --> 00:34:21.260
is just a mathematical tool that some people use

587
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.360
in some aspects, you know, in the statistical physics,

588
00:34:23.399 --> 00:34:26.800
in some, in some places. Um, It was a

589
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.688
good thing to was a, was a good tool

590
00:34:29.688 --> 00:34:37.319
to study collective behavior. Uh, SOMEHOW self. Organized mathematically.

591
00:34:37.447 --> 00:34:40.739
And yeah, and during the 80s, ecological psychologists along,

592
00:34:41.188 --> 00:34:43.608
along with Kelso and with uh Schoner and some

593
00:34:43.608 --> 00:34:46.529
other people are the first one that start up

594
00:34:46.529 --> 00:34:50.608
trying to apply those dynamical systems or methods to,

595
00:34:50.799 --> 00:34:54.658
to, to behavior, right? To, to how we, we

596
00:34:55.447 --> 00:34:59.279
organize our, our action. And since then it's been

597
00:34:59.849 --> 00:35:04.760
uh along with. Several tools to, to perform time

598
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.159
series analysis. Uh, DYNAMICAL systems theories is one of

599
00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:11.360
the main tools within the, the ecological approach since

600
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:11.600
then.

601
00:35:13.479 --> 00:35:16.639
So, uh, let me ask you then, does ecological

602
00:35:16.639 --> 00:35:25.550
psychology stand in opposition to uh representationalist slash computationalist

603
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.239
approaches to the, to cognition?

604
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:33.719
Well, that's actually a very difficult question to answer

605
00:35:33.719 --> 00:35:38.570
because the more you study representational theories of, of

606
00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:41.530
cognition, the more you see that there's also not

607
00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:45.360
one thing. I mean, there are many different uh

608
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.810
options to, to, there are many versions, there are

609
00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:51.239
many flavors, so to speak, of representations out there.

610
00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:55.699
So Uh, I think what ecological psychologists are against

611
00:35:55.699 --> 00:35:59.540
too is the idea that you need uh mental

612
00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:04.540
models of the environment in your brain so. Now

613
00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:07.300
it's true that there are more and more deflationary

614
00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:10.439
accounts of mental representations there that some, some of

615
00:36:10.439 --> 00:36:12.830
them are even like just neural activity that correlates

616
00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:16.659
with some external states. So I guess the answer.

617
00:36:17.439 --> 00:36:22.979
Depends on how Complex you think mental presentations are.

618
00:36:23.699 --> 00:36:25.850
So again, if you, if you know uh take

619
00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:29.169
a paper on, on, uh, cognitive neuroscience about mental

620
00:36:29.169 --> 00:36:31.770
about representations, you see that the no representation is

621
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:33.949
actually quite weak. To the point, as I said,

622
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.899
to the point that they, they, it's just neural

623
00:36:35.899 --> 00:36:39.290
activity that correlates with some external state of affairs.

624
00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.500
Well, if that's your notional representation, then I, I

625
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.969
don't think anyone can be. Against that because it's

626
00:36:45.969 --> 00:36:50.070
that thing, is that minimal that No one would

627
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:54.270
deny that. That's why I, we wouldn't want to,

628
00:36:54.439 --> 00:36:57.000
we, we don't, we didn't want, sorry to, to

629
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.870
put too much emphasis on representations in our book

630
00:37:00.239 --> 00:37:02.929
because we think it's not really uh uh and

631
00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:06.459
that an easy topic. So no, I know what

632
00:37:06.459 --> 00:37:07.830
they think they would say, but that's, I, I,

633
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.739
I have uh my problems with these questions because

634
00:37:10.739 --> 00:37:12.699
I'm not, I'm not sure how to answer it

635
00:37:12.699 --> 00:37:13.280
actually.

636
00:37:13.699 --> 00:37:15.179
Yeah, I, I, I, I'm kind of, kind of

637
00:37:15.179 --> 00:37:19.830
the thing. I, I think. That the, the rejection

638
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:23.590
of at least some kinds of representation is a

639
00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.830
consequence of the ecological approach but it's not a

640
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:30.310
core uh aspect of it, right? Uh, um, I

641
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:33.709
think there's a very uh a very simple way

642
00:37:33.709 --> 00:37:37.070
to see that which is like even though there

643
00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:42.300
are ecological psychologists and some people around them that

644
00:37:42.429 --> 00:37:47.350
uh using ecological psychologists have. Have developed strong claims

645
00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:51.189
against mental representations. One example we've talked about him

646
00:37:51.189 --> 00:37:54.030
a few times, Tony Chamero, it's a very clear

647
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.949
example of that, but not the only one, right?

648
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:59.310
Uh, IF you read Gibson in 1979, the most

649
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:02.800
famous book, right, the, the ecological approach to visual

650
00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.189
perception, he talks nothing about representations. He uses the

651
00:38:07.189 --> 00:38:09.830
word twice to talk about pictures, you know, like,

652
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:13.149
like, uh, actually, so it was not a part

653
00:38:13.149 --> 00:38:17.870
of his own thinking because representations, uh, uh, I

654
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:21.719
think this is the history is good here. Gibson

655
00:38:21.719 --> 00:38:24.800
is not an old man, right? It's, it's, he,

656
00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:27.520
he, he, he was all for the, for our

657
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.969
mentors, right? For, for the, for the, for the

658
00:38:30.969 --> 00:38:33.250
big figures of, of the film now, right? He

659
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:36.689
got his PhD in 1920. People were not talking

660
00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:40.090
about there, there were not representation wars there, you

661
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:43.370
know, like, uh, it's, it's like, so he, he

662
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:45.570
was just not interested in that. But now, you

663
00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:50.959
know, after the cognitive revolution takes place. Um, Well,

664
00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.639
if you are an ecological psychologist and, and, and

665
00:38:54.639 --> 00:38:57.040
you start dealing with the new words and one

666
00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.750
of them is computation, the other one is representation,

667
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.719
you will eventually end up in some form of

668
00:39:02.719 --> 00:39:08.030
anti-representationalist. What form was what, as Miguel said, depending,

669
00:39:08.159 --> 00:39:10.989
but uh it's more, it's more of a consequence

670
00:39:10.989 --> 00:39:12.719
or it's more of a thing like you can

671
00:39:12.719 --> 00:39:16.550
use, you can use ecological psychology to develop a

672
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:20.199
theory against mental representations or against some mental representations.

673
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:24.270
But I don't think that clay is core to,

674
00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:25.780
to, to the ecological approach.

675
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.340
Yeah. And the same of course with, with computation.

676
00:39:28.389 --> 00:39:31.030
I mean, there's a very cool paper when he

677
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:33.560
the idea that computation is a, a motif, no,

678
00:39:34.149 --> 00:39:36.429
like a musical motif, and that tells you basically

679
00:39:36.429 --> 00:39:38.510
that computation is not a natural kind. It's not

680
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:42.790
a well-defined concept in cognitive science either. So competition

681
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:46.229
means, means very different things for very, very complex,

682
00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:51.179
highly abstract with Something that doesn't seem so problematic.

683
00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:55.340
So it really depends on what your definition and

684
00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.939
characterization of mental representation is and computation is that

685
00:39:57.939 --> 00:40:02.159
we will be uh More inclined to agree or

686
00:40:02.159 --> 00:40:04.429
more inclined to disagree, but I also agree with

687
00:40:04.429 --> 00:40:07.989
this, it's a consequence of the paradigm and not

688
00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:12.120
necessarily uh uh beginnings or uh uh uh starting

689
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:12.639
claim of that.

690
00:40:13.689 --> 00:40:17.270
Mhm. So earlier I asked you a little bit

691
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:21.889
about the history of ecological psychology. What is its

692
00:40:21.889 --> 00:40:25.409
current status? How does it look nowadays?

693
00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:29.709
Yeah, that's actually a good, a good question. So

694
00:40:29.709 --> 00:40:34.780
in the, in the book, we somehow identify 4

695
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.590
different trends that are now being explored. The first

696
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.590
one is ecological neuroscience, which uh Vicente is one

697
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.469
of the leading figures among others with the Main

698
00:40:43.469 --> 00:40:45.790
the beat or You know, people that are trying

699
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:49.429
to, OK, let's gonna bring back uh the nervous

700
00:40:49.429 --> 00:40:52.879
system in the story that was somehow neglected for

701
00:40:52.879 --> 00:40:54.629
uh most part of the, of the history of

702
00:40:54.629 --> 00:40:58.600
the paradigm. There are also like people from early

703
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.979
200 working on social coordination and how we uh

704
00:41:01.979 --> 00:41:05.000
understand and interact others and how we can uh

705
00:41:05.399 --> 00:41:09.550
build social uh synergies. Also, there are people uh

706
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.149
working on, on how to apply ecological psychology to

707
00:41:12.149 --> 00:41:14.909
motor rehabilitation and skill acquisitions. So there are people

708
00:41:14.909 --> 00:41:17.909
working, for example, on how to apply ecological psychology

709
00:41:17.909 --> 00:41:21.750
principles to um physical training, like, for example, applying

710
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:24.909
to uh football or applying to uh basketball to

711
00:41:25.189 --> 00:41:28.149
many different sports. That also brings back the, for

712
00:41:28.149 --> 00:41:31.699
example, for collective sports, the social coordination approach. There

713
00:41:31.699 --> 00:41:34.250
are also people like, like me or Harry Heft

714
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.379
uh interested in, in making space for uh cultural

715
00:41:37.379 --> 00:41:40.979
and social normativity in the theory and also like

716
00:41:40.979 --> 00:41:45.270
people working on um technological applications like sensory substitution.

717
00:41:45.659 --> 00:41:48.620
So there are actually many different uh approaches that

718
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:52.860
are being developed there. So I know this can't

719
00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:53.540
remember any other

720
00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.409
when I think about it is like. We are,

721
00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.939
uh, I think we are kind of as good

722
00:41:57.939 --> 00:42:02.979
or as bad as always. Um, AGAIN, ecological psychology

723
00:42:02.979 --> 00:42:04.780
has been the other psychology or part of the

724
00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.699
other psychology, so it's minority. We are very few

725
00:42:07.699 --> 00:42:12.229
people doing this, um. In kind of in a,

726
00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:17.669
in a constant struggle for survival, right? Because we,

727
00:42:17.699 --> 00:42:20.459
we need in almost any venue we need to

728
00:42:20.459 --> 00:42:24.139
justify that we exist, right? Um, I call it

729
00:42:24.139 --> 00:42:27.379
sometimes the ecological handicap. EVERY talk I give that

730
00:42:27.379 --> 00:42:30.100
is not for ecological psychologists. I need to spend

731
00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.860
like at least 20% of it justifying why I'm

732
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.100
doing this, what ecological uh psychology is, right? And

733
00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:42.159
then, um, so, uh. I like to say sometimes

734
00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:45.540
that in some ways we've lost the battle, right?

735
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:50.800
Um, COGNITIVE psychology is so dominant everywhere, right? Um,

736
00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.399
THAT we are a very small, uh, a very

737
00:42:53.399 --> 00:42:56.760
small paradigm, but having lost it, uh, there are

738
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:01.010
like 50 years of continuous empirical research, right? So

739
00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:04.760
I think we are surviving and hopefully, you know,

740
00:43:04.939 --> 00:43:09.010
uh, us also. I think cognitive science and cognitive

741
00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:13.729
neuroscience is reaching some limits on ecological validity and

742
00:43:13.729 --> 00:43:15.290
that kind of stuff. I think they are looking

743
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:19.360
out for tools to try to, to be more,

744
00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:22.290
you know, to, to, to, to make more sense

745
00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:24.489
of the whole organism and the environment in our

746
00:43:24.489 --> 00:43:27.689
experiments and in the and I, and I think

747
00:43:27.689 --> 00:43:31.409
it has, uh, something to, uh, to say there,

748
00:43:31.449 --> 00:43:31.870
so.

749
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.840
So, I mean, when it comes to what we

750
00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:41.719
could consider to be more mainstream in psychology and

751
00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:47.639
particularly in cognitive psychology, uh, ecological psychology is not

752
00:43:47.639 --> 00:43:51.554
that, right? I mean, it's not. Mainstream at all.

753
00:43:52.024 --> 00:43:55.245
It's, it's, it's super minoritary. I would say that

754
00:43:55.245 --> 00:43:57.875
most people, if, if you go to any cognitive

755
00:43:57.875 --> 00:44:01.445
cognitive psychology or cognitive neuroscience department, random one and

756
00:44:01.445 --> 00:44:03.554
you ask a random uh person that do you

757
00:44:03.554 --> 00:44:08.729
know ecological psychology, the standard is no. And whoever

758
00:44:08.729 --> 00:44:10.969
knows I've heard about it, but yeah, no, no.

759
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:11.989
Yeah, mhm.

760
00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:14.850
And so this is some kind of very strange

761
00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:17.100
phenomenon that for all, we, we have many, many

762
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:20.820
friends that work, uh, doing empirical research in like

763
00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.770
a psychology and I've heard this story many times

764
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:25.550
that for them it's easier to get grants in

765
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.540
philosophy than, than in psychology. So it's easier for

766
00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.709
them to get a Funds to do psychology they

767
00:44:31.709 --> 00:44:33.550
apply to philosophy grants and to do it in

768
00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:36.020
psychology because when they, they apply to psychology grants,

769
00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:39.429
they usually get some uh psychologists who come to

770
00:44:39.429 --> 00:44:41.429
science from very mainstream and say, well, you know,

771
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.669
we, and the, the usual response is, well, we

772
00:44:43.669 --> 00:44:45.909
all know that coal psychology is either a form

773
00:44:45.909 --> 00:44:48.350
of behaviorism, so it's dead, or we all, we

774
00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:50.510
all know it doesn't, it doesn't work on what

775
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:53.389
is psychological psychology. So are the three default answers

776
00:44:53.389 --> 00:44:55.709
that they, they get. So that's

777
00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:03.290
Yeah, and how successful has ecological psychology been experimentally?

778
00:45:04.889 --> 00:45:09.439
This is a question I think very successful given

779
00:45:09.439 --> 00:45:12.879
that only a few people are. Doing that, right?

780
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.949
So, so in, in broad numbers, there's no comparison.

781
00:45:17.159 --> 00:45:21.699
There's maybe only a few 100 ecological psychologists in

782
00:45:21.699 --> 00:45:24.439
the, in the, in the world right now, right?

783
00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:26.520
What you are going to be able, able to

784
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.399
be funding tens of thousands of, of uh cognitive

785
00:45:30.399 --> 00:45:34.320
psychologists slash neuroscientists, right? So, given that the small

786
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.070
community and that those, those difficulties for funding and,

787
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.330
you know, and, and to get published sometimes. Etc.

788
00:45:41.889 --> 00:45:44.199
I think, you know, again, you, you have an,

789
00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:48.889
an steady stream of empirical work since, since the

790
00:45:48.889 --> 00:45:52.320
mid-seventies as uh uh up to, up to date.

791
00:45:52.409 --> 00:45:57.290
So I think it's, it's uh there's experimental success

792
00:45:57.290 --> 00:46:03.360
there. Um. Although experimental success is always difficult to,

793
00:46:03.389 --> 00:46:09.310
to evaluate, uh, because The thing is that would

794
00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:14.030
a cognitive psychologist take uh experiment in ecological psychology

795
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:18.310
to be successful? In, in what sense, right? Like,

796
00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.979
like we are critical with some of the experiments

797
00:46:20.979 --> 00:46:24.860
cognitive psychologists think are successful. I think they, they

798
00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.409
would be critical, um, with us, so yeah.

799
00:46:28.889 --> 00:46:30.889
Now, do you have anything to add to that

800
00:46:30.889 --> 00:46:31.729
doctor or to,

801
00:46:31.969 --> 00:46:33.899
no, no, no, I, I, I was about to

802
00:46:33.899 --> 00:46:35.669
say that, that, that the, the question is difficult

803
00:46:35.669 --> 00:46:39.629
to, to answer because it's difficult to measure, uh,

804
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:42.489
empirical success. I mean, in the ecological psychology paradigm,

805
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:45.350
yes. If you ask someone outside, they would say

806
00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.129
no. Yeah.

807
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.840
Uh, AND how do you look at the future

808
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.060
of ecological psychology?

809
00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:58.969
Well, I'm, I'm optimistic actually. I'm, I'm optimistic that

810
00:46:58.969 --> 00:47:03.040
uh new people are The fact is that ecological

811
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.280
psychology is not dead. It's not dead because uh

812
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.479
every year new students come, uh, every year, I

813
00:47:09.479 --> 00:47:12.280
mean, some people get keep getting grants and keep

814
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:16.399
getting, uh getting new students, people interested. So I,

815
00:47:16.479 --> 00:47:18.919
I wouldn't say it's dead. So I'm, I'm in

816
00:47:18.919 --> 00:47:21.699
a way, I'm, I'm optimistic. Do I believe ec

817
00:47:21.699 --> 00:47:23.550
psychology is gonna, is gonna become the new mainstream

818
00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:25.360
now. I don't believe that. I mean we are

819
00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.179
far away from this universe actually. But I think

820
00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:31.110
there are a lot of uh interesting and cool

821
00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:34.300
people doing really interesting work, um, applying uh ecological

822
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.610
principles to, to many different areas and also bringing

823
00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:41.580
into ecological psychology, uh, explanatory tools and uh techniques

824
00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.810
that were not there before. So in a way,

825
00:47:43.889 --> 00:47:45.860
I'm, I'm, I'm quite optimistic about the future.

826
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.810
And uh how do you go about integrating it

827
00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:52.810
with neuroscience?

828
00:47:53.659 --> 00:47:58.360
Um This is, this is, uh, the thing I've

829
00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:01.000
spent the last 10 years trying to do, kind

830
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:10.750
of, uh. Um, Ecological psychology has been Generally ignoring

831
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.830
neuroscience for some reasons that we don't, I, I

832
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:16.889
don't think we need to get into, but there

833
00:48:16.889 --> 00:48:19.709
were some particular reasons why the leading figures of

834
00:48:19.709 --> 00:48:23.300
ecological psychology for years didn't really pay attention to

835
00:48:23.469 --> 00:48:26.669
physiology in general or, or at least to neurophysiology.

836
00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:31.340
Um, But in the last year, in the last

837
00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.000
10 years or so there have been a few

838
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.929
people that we've been trying to, to, to think

839
00:48:37.929 --> 00:48:41.050
of, OK, if the brain is not in the

840
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.330
business or in the business of building up an

841
00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:46.290
internal model of the external environment, what is the

842
00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:48.600
business, what is the brain doing here, right? Uh,

843
00:48:48.689 --> 00:48:51.770
WHAT, what's the, what's, what's, what's the role and

844
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:55.320
how can we study it? And so my, in,

845
00:48:55.419 --> 00:48:59.100
in my, in my own work, I recover uh

846
00:48:59.659 --> 00:49:04.379
the notion of resonance. Um BASICALLY, James Gibson says

847
00:49:04.379 --> 00:49:06.409
what the brain is doing is not building up

848
00:49:06.409 --> 00:49:10.459
an internal model but resonating to uh to ecological

849
00:49:10.459 --> 00:49:14.300
information, which is that reads information in the stimulation,

850
00:49:14.379 --> 00:49:19.280
right? So, of course he uses in some metaphorical

851
00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.080
way, but he takes it from Lashley, which is

852
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.600
a neurophysiologist in the, in the early 20th century.

853
00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.729
So there are some ideas there, but the, but

854
00:49:27.729 --> 00:49:30.800
the, but the main idea is that what the

855
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.040
brain is doing is somehow coupling to that information,

856
00:49:34.139 --> 00:49:38.159
right? So it's reshaping its its own dynamics uh

857
00:49:38.159 --> 00:49:42.169
with respect to that information. And that's uh the

858
00:49:42.409 --> 00:49:46.689
basic idea that I've, uh, labeled that psychological resonance

859
00:49:46.689 --> 00:49:49.209
as to refer to this particular thing, you know,

860
00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:53.489
what's, uh, how, how the, how the dynamics of

861
00:49:53.489 --> 00:49:58.050
neural activity get coupled or shaped or entangled to

862
00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:04.939
ecological information. Um, So by, by doing this, I

863
00:50:04.939 --> 00:50:08.139
think you get what ecological psychologists would like, right,

864
00:50:08.199 --> 00:50:12.590
which is like uh Uh, a way to talk

865
00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:16.520
about brain activity without saying that brain activity is

866
00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:20.929
modeling, representing, uh, building up. Anything but, you know,

867
00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:25.010
but having its own dynamics, which is uncontroversial and

868
00:50:25.409 --> 00:50:29.610
through the interaction with the environment, those dynamics get

869
00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:32.169
coupled to, to something that is already there, right,

870
00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:37.520
which is the, the ecological information. Um, AND so

871
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:41.729
this has been theoretical work on my part and

872
00:50:41.729 --> 00:50:43.850
I've been the last 5 years or so trying

873
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:46.840
to do experimental work on that. We have already

874
00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.780
a print out and we have some other works

875
00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:53.629
that are going on by people like Ruth Vander

876
00:50:53.629 --> 00:50:56.709
Van der Bell and Audrey van der Meer that

877
00:50:56.709 --> 00:51:02.229
are doing really, really cool work using EG uh

878
00:51:02.229 --> 00:51:05.270
to explore brain dynamics and to see whether there's

879
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:10.520
this, this, this resonance, right? Um, MYSELF with, with

880
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.370
the Professor Klaus, Klaus Grahaman at the at the

881
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:18.520
Technical University of, uh, Berlin, we, we have, again,

882
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:21.010
we set that, we set up an experiment that,

883
00:51:21.129 --> 00:51:25.850
that combines uh virtual. Reality and and eye tracking

884
00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:28.969
and Mo EG trying to explore this kind of

885
00:51:28.969 --> 00:51:31.409
stuff. And of course there are other people like

886
00:51:31.409 --> 00:51:35.010
Miguel said Matthew the which are doing other cool

887
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:39.239
stuff. Lou Louis Favela has this book The Ecological

888
00:51:39.239 --> 00:51:41.449
Brain in which uh you have some form of,

889
00:51:41.489 --> 00:51:46.320
you know, um um an understanding of ecological neuroscience

890
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.169
as we could call it. Uh, FROM the point

891
00:51:49.169 --> 00:51:52.209
of view of computational neuroscience and other methods, manifolds,

892
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:53.979
that kind of stuff. So I think this is,

893
00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:55.969
this is a trend that, that we are trying

894
00:51:55.969 --> 00:51:59.209
to build up and, and uh I think it's

895
00:51:59.209 --> 00:52:03.800
going to keep growing in the next few years.

896
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:09.679
Also because importantly people in cognitive neuroscience departments. Uh,

897
00:52:09.889 --> 00:52:13.760
WANT to have experiments that are ecologically valid, so

898
00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.770
they are interested in how the hell can we

899
00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:21.070
include the environment in our experiments. If, if any

900
00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:23.399
of you have ever been in an, in an,

901
00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:25.969
in an FMRI, the FMRI is a very weird

902
00:52:25.969 --> 00:52:29.530
place, right? And it's not a very naturalistic uh

903
00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:32.070
way to understand that, right? You are, you are

904
00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:34.729
laying there with a lot of noise, not moving

905
00:52:34.729 --> 00:52:37.290
the head, right? Like, so what can we do?

906
00:52:37.899 --> 00:52:40.840
To try to be more, more ecological, right? More

907
00:52:41.379 --> 00:52:43.489
including our own body and the things we do

908
00:52:43.489 --> 00:52:45.659
and the, and the environment in this, and there

909
00:52:45.659 --> 00:52:48.060
are already many labs that are trying to do

910
00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:51.199
this. I'm familiar, for instance, with, with, with the,

911
00:52:51.219 --> 00:52:54.620
the lab of Jodi Cola at Western University in

912
00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:58.699
Canada. Uh, THEY invented this kind of trade to,

913
00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:01.479
to show actual objects to the, to, to, to

914
00:53:01.479 --> 00:53:04.219
the FMRI people, right? And you know, trying to

915
00:53:04.219 --> 00:53:07.139
include not pictures but objects is already a step.

916
00:53:08.949 --> 00:53:13.110
Towards a more realistic environment, right? And as the

917
00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:15.830
whole field moves that way, I think they are

918
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:20.350
going to find interesting stuff within ecological psychology even

919
00:53:20.350 --> 00:53:22.780
if they don't buy the whole package, right? So

920
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:26.469
I think it's um. Good years um ahead of

921
00:53:26.469 --> 00:53:26.709
us.

922
00:53:27.459 --> 00:53:32.149
Yeah. By the way, you mentioned Doctor Favela's book,

923
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:35.550
The Ecological Brain. I actually have an interview with

924
00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:37.820
him about that book on the show. So if

925
00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.510
people are interested, you can go and watch it.

926
00:53:40.909 --> 00:53:43.590
Uh, BUT I mean, do, do you think, or

927
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:48.580
do you have the sense that neuroscientists, uh, take

928
00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:55.060
ecological psychologists more seriously than cognitive psychologists do, or

929
00:53:55.350 --> 00:54:02.929
not? Um. I don't think so. Uh. It is

930
00:54:02.929 --> 00:54:06.010
interesting, like, like there's a, there's a last week,

931
00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:11.290
uh, a new grant was announced, um, $10 million

932
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:15.600
for 8 years to study ecological neuroscience. Uh, AND

933
00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.429
they, and they explicitly refer like that they were

934
00:54:19.429 --> 00:54:22.719
inspired by ecological psychology, blah blah blah, but no

935
00:54:22.719 --> 00:54:26.719
single ecological psychologist was part of that grant, right?

936
00:54:27.199 --> 00:54:30.159
Which is, I mean, uh, so when you say

937
00:54:30.159 --> 00:54:33.439
that some people can hear oh that there, therefore

938
00:54:33.439 --> 00:54:35.320
the ground is bad. No, the ground is awesome,

939
00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:40.679
right? It's very cool, successful cognitive neuroscientists that are

940
00:54:40.679 --> 00:54:44.149
trying to explore according to them how affordances are

941
00:54:44.149 --> 00:54:48.020
encoded and represented in the brain. Of course, for

942
00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:50.939
a, for, for a, for, for an ecological psychologist,

943
00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:52.939
this is not the right way to look, to

944
00:54:52.939 --> 00:54:56.179
look uh at affordances, right? We, we've been telling

945
00:54:56.179 --> 00:55:01.760
that affordances are there. Uh, PRECISELY, uh, to try

946
00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:04.040
to avoid the need to, you know, to have

947
00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:07.800
internal models representations. But anyways, I think this is

948
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.840
a good step, right? It's, it's, it's the whole

949
00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:15.399
field moving towards ecological uh concepts and this is

950
00:55:15.399 --> 00:55:17.159
good. And I think they are going to do

951
00:55:17.159 --> 00:55:20.719
cool stuff and they are going to, to read

952
00:55:20.719 --> 00:55:23.679
more ecological psychology and we are going to be

953
00:55:23.679 --> 00:55:27.199
more visible in some ways. Now. Again, are they

954
00:55:27.199 --> 00:55:31.120
doing that by including us, so, so to speak,

955
00:55:31.159 --> 00:55:33.310
or including the people that have been doing ecological

956
00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:37.040
neuroscience for years now? Not really, right? So do

957
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:41.300
they Pay more attention. Not really, but, but I

958
00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:45.570
think my point here is more like it's unavoidable

959
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:49.570
given, given the limits they are facing in terms

960
00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:53.649
of ecological validity and the naturalization of their experiments.

961
00:55:54.439 --> 00:55:58.479
Ecological psychology or something in that camp is going

962
00:55:58.479 --> 00:56:00.429
to become unavoidable.

963
00:56:01.679 --> 00:56:05.669
Right. So, another thing that you talk about in

964
00:56:05.669 --> 00:56:10.270
your book is the study of social coordination. Uh,

965
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:14.310
I mean, first of all, what is social coordination

966
00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:18.479
and can it be studied through ecological psychology?

967
00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.909
Yeah, well, I can. I mean, uh, it kind

968
00:56:21.909 --> 00:56:24.449
of has been studied for, for decades already. I

969
00:56:24.449 --> 00:56:26.729
mean, the work on Mike Richardson, Kerry Mars, and

970
00:56:26.729 --> 00:56:28.770
there are many people working on, on that um

971
00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:32.659
are really inspired by some remarks by James and

972
00:56:32.659 --> 00:56:36.604
Gibson. The social coordination is our ability. TO act

973
00:56:36.774 --> 00:56:39.655
with others, for example, to form dyadics or to,

974
00:56:39.735 --> 00:56:42.975
to collaborate in in tasks, to play sports with

975
00:56:42.975 --> 00:56:46.375
others. So it involves our, our ability to understand

976
00:56:46.375 --> 00:56:48.614
what the others are doing and to understand what,

977
00:56:48.895 --> 00:56:51.495
what we have to do to contribute to this

978
00:56:51.495 --> 00:56:54.139
uh group action, right? And the idea here is

979
00:56:54.139 --> 00:56:56.780
that uh you should be able to study social

980
00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:59.219
coordination the same way you study individual coordination with

981
00:56:59.219 --> 00:57:03.020
the environment. So there should be information about the

982
00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:06.939
environment and about the others that specifies what you

983
00:57:06.939 --> 00:57:09.814
can do there. So how you can behave. What

984
00:57:09.814 --> 00:57:12.175
options you have, etc. So basically the principles are

985
00:57:12.175 --> 00:57:14.774
the same. The only difference is that instead of

986
00:57:14.774 --> 00:57:18.475
uh speaking about a person and a material environment,

987
00:57:18.534 --> 00:57:21.604
so to speak, we're, we're speaking about different people

988
00:57:21.895 --> 00:57:24.485
acting together in a material environment. So there is

989
00:57:24.485 --> 00:57:27.215
information about the objects and information about what the

990
00:57:27.215 --> 00:57:30.564
others are doing. And that the, the quality of

991
00:57:30.564 --> 00:57:33.415
uh colega in correlations, it's actually a very good

992
00:57:33.415 --> 00:57:37.854
example of uh successful research doing chole psychology with

993
00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:41.669
dynamical systems theory. So once you introduce more people

994
00:57:41.669 --> 00:57:44.739
there, then the to introduce dynamical system is obvious.

995
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:46.959
You need to have like a lot of uh

996
00:57:46.959 --> 00:57:50.110
differential equations and temporal analysis because otherwise impossible.

997
00:57:51.189 --> 00:57:54.909
Mhm. So there's one last uh topic that I

998
00:57:54.909 --> 00:57:57.870
would like to ask you about. Uh, HOW about

999
00:57:57.870 --> 00:58:00.909
the study of culture? I mean, is there space

1000
00:58:00.909 --> 00:58:04.750
for the study of culture within ecological psychology?

1001
00:58:07.419 --> 00:58:09.280
Well, I, I guess that's uh that's my turn

1002
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.760
to. Well, I think it, it must, it has

1003
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:16.120
to be based there. So unless you believe human

1004
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:20.600
perception and action is completely secluded from cultural influences

1005
00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.040
and social influences, unless you believe that and be

1006
00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.620
my guest if you believe that. Unless you believe

1007
00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:28.939
that, then you need to have some space for

1008
00:58:28.939 --> 00:58:32.429
that. The question is how, that's the big, that's

1009
00:58:32.429 --> 00:58:34.139
the big, the same way as, as was saying,

1010
00:58:34.189 --> 00:58:36.510
well, unless you believe that the brain doesn't play

1011
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:39.840
any role in perception and motor control, then you,

1012
00:58:39.909 --> 00:58:41.389
the question is how, what is the role of

1013
00:58:41.389 --> 00:58:43.550
the brain? OK, then the same question applies here.

1014
00:58:43.899 --> 00:58:45.550
So what is the role of culture? What is

1015
00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:47.709
the role of the role of social normativity? How

1016
00:58:47.709 --> 00:58:50.550
does it, how does is involved here? How does,

1017
00:58:51.229 --> 00:58:54.110
how do social norms affect the way we perceive

1018
00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:56.989
and interact with affordances? Well, there's a question that

1019
00:58:56.989 --> 00:58:58.939
for many years too was also like ignored by

1020
00:58:58.939 --> 00:59:03.840
psychologists uh until uh people like Uh, it was

1021
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.969
already mentioned in some of the words of Eleanor

1022
00:59:06.969 --> 00:59:10.090
and, and James Gibson, but then Edward Reed, uh,

1023
00:59:10.219 --> 00:59:13.040
especially Harry Heft, is the one who, uh, uh,

1024
00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:14.969
was more interested in that, and now I'm working

1025
00:59:14.969 --> 00:59:17.620
on that also like inspired by Heft and in

1026
00:59:17.929 --> 00:59:21.050
constant, uh, debate with him. So we're trying to,

1027
00:59:21.169 --> 00:59:25.770
to understand how, uh, social norms and cultural norms

1028
00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:27.850
can influence perception and action. And there are different

1029
00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:31.040
options, different Possibilities. There is also like this um

1030
00:59:31.209 --> 00:59:35.689
uh work um um values, uh, do you remember

1031
00:59:35.689 --> 00:59:40.620
the name of uh oh. I'm sorry, I, I

1032
00:59:40.629 --> 00:59:42.229
can't remember the name of the, of the researcher

1033
00:59:42.229 --> 00:59:44.570
working on that, but yeah, there is, there are

1034
00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:46.669
different options, different people working on, on the, on

1035
00:59:46.669 --> 00:59:47.219
the topic.

1036
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:53.270
Right. So, uh, I mean, Doctor Raja, is there

1037
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:55.500
anything you'd like to add to that or?

1038
00:59:56.949 --> 01:00:01.250
Um, YEAH, I mean, I, I think, uh, um,

1039
01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:06.939
It is, it is difficult to think about how

1040
01:00:06.939 --> 01:00:10.419
ecological psychology can get to that. It should, I

1041
01:00:10.419 --> 01:00:14.239
agree with, with, with, with uh Miguel. I think

1042
01:00:14.239 --> 01:00:17.040
it is going to change when it happens, um.

1043
01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:20.459
Uh I don't know how it is going to

1044
01:00:20.459 --> 01:00:26.060
change, uh, but, but I think, yeah, uh. The

1045
01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:29.419
thing is that it is also possible that ecological

1046
01:00:29.419 --> 01:00:32.250
psychology is just not enough and that's OK too.

1047
01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:39.080
Uh. Um, Human psychology and animal psychology and maybe

1048
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.350
plant psychology as as Miguel and I have, have,

1049
01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.639
have worked on, uh, sometimes it's super complex, it's,

1050
01:00:46.679 --> 01:00:52.080
it's super, you know, intruncated. Maybe we cannot. We

1051
01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.439
cannot explain everything with just one theory, right? Uh,

1052
01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.040
I'm, if I, if I, if I swear some

1053
01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.939
alliance in the psychological camp, my alliance is to,

1054
01:01:03.959 --> 01:01:06.629
is to, is to, is to Will and James,

1055
01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:10.500
and he basically says that in the principles of,

1056
01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.360
uh, psychology, right? Like the, he says, uh, something

1057
01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.929
like, um. The, the, you know, the, the, the

1058
01:01:20.929 --> 01:01:25.649
boundaries of what is mental are, are blurry. It's

1059
01:01:25.649 --> 01:01:27.530
better to not to be pedantic and to leave

1060
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:30.729
our side uh as, as, as, uh, blurry too,

1061
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.939
right? Like as open-ended kind of thing. So, so

1062
01:01:33.939 --> 01:01:35.989
yeah, I, I, I mean, I think, I think

1063
01:01:35.989 --> 01:01:40.209
at least at least ecological psychologists eventually should have

1064
01:01:40.209 --> 01:01:43.520
something to say about it, even, even if what

1065
01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.370
if what is to say is that we are

1066
01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:46.159
not enough.

1067
01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:54.050
OK, so any last uh message uh Doctor Orin

1068
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:56.360
or can we wrap it up?

1069
01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:01.199
No, I don't have any final remark or anything.

1070
01:02:02.149 --> 01:02:05.760
OK, psychology is alive and that's what some people

1071
01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.500
seem to believe,

1072
01:02:06.879 --> 01:02:08.959
and we have a book, a short book about

1073
01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:10.620
it, so you can say that, yeah,

1074
01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:15.439
yeah, yeah, uh, it's psychological psychology. I'm leaving a

1075
01:02:15.439 --> 01:02:20.370
link within the description down below and, uh, where,

1076
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:24.159
just before we go, where can people find your

1077
01:02:24.439 --> 01:02:27.810
work on the internet, Doctor Martin and Doctor Raja.

1078
01:02:29.689 --> 01:02:32.649
Well, I guess they can, they can buy from

1079
01:02:32.649 --> 01:02:38.429
the Cambridge University press website. Uh, ALSO they can

1080
01:02:38.429 --> 01:02:40.560
email us and we can send them some pre

1081
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:43.870
like pre-print version of those ones that are, that

1082
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:47.310
we are actually allowed to share officially. And yeah,

1083
01:02:47.399 --> 01:02:49.510
I mean, we, we try to publish as many

1084
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:51.350
papers as possible to open access because we think

1085
01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.469
that people should be able to read it without

1086
01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:56.840
having to pay subscription to journals or being Affiliated

1087
01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.919
to universities that have those subscriptions. But anyway, I,

1088
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.429
I always like Encourage people, my students. I, I,

1089
01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:04.879
what I tell them is that, well, you know,

1090
01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.820
researchers, Write papers to be read. I mean, it's

1091
01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:11.040
not that we write papers to just to be

1092
01:03:12.189 --> 01:03:14.600
online. So if you can't find a paper, if

1093
01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.959
you can't access a paper, the best strategy usually

1094
01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:20.790
is to contact the researcher, uh her or himself,

1095
01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.070
because they are actually happy to send you. I

1096
01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:25.760
mean, there's no point to to write a paper

1097
01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.919
for if no one can read it. So if

1098
01:03:27.919 --> 01:03:31.159
people can't access our paper, then please contact us

1099
01:03:31.159 --> 01:03:32.840
because we will be more than happy to send

1100
01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.639
you everything that we can and we

1101
01:03:34.639 --> 01:03:35.070
have.

1102
01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:39.790
Yeah. OK, great. So thank you both so much

1103
01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:41.510
for taking the time to come on the show.

1104
01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:43.870
I really like the book and it goes in

line with other interviews I've done recently on dynamical

1106
01:03:48.229 --> 01:03:53.070
systems theory, ecological psychology as well. So thank you

1107
01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:55.110
