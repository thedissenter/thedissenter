00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:03.299
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:06.019
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes and

3
00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.649
to the MJ by Doctor Scott Hershowitz. He's the

4
00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.770
Thomas G. AND Mabel Long Professor of Law and

5
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.329
Professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan. And

6
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.409
today we're talking about his book Law is a

7
00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:23.290
Moral Practice. So Doctor Hershowitz, welcome to the show.

8
00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:24.930
It's a pleasure to everyone. Yeah,

9
00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:26.049
thanks so much for having me.

10
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.620
So let's start perhaps with a few definitions here.

11
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.150
So first of all, what is a rule? What

12
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.340
counts as a rule?

13
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.180
What counts as a rule? Yes. Oh, you know,

14
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.930
I, um, Uh, it's, it's, you know, it's, it's

15
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.290
a, it's a funny question cause it's a hard

16
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.200
question to answer. Um, NOTWITHSTANDING the fact that everyone

17
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.650
knows what rules are, we're familiar with lots of

18
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.610
examples, we're familiar with the speed limit, or, you

19
00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.639
know, you have to wear shoes to go in

20
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.470
to the restaurant. Um, SO I think maybe the,

21
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.555
the simplest. The answer you might give is it's

22
00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:10.685
a norm of general application, right? That it's um

23
00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:15.916
sets a standard that applies um uh to many

24
00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:18.365
instances of the same activity. So it's not, so,

25
00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:20.916
so later, right? I will go pick up my

26
00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:25.561
son at 1:55. Uh, WHEN he's done taking his,

27
00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:28.452
uh, his high school exam today, I, it's not,

28
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.192
I, there's no rule that I do so, um,

29
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:33.561
because that's the thing that's happening today and not

30
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:38.001
other days. Um, uh, BUT, but so when we've

31
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.561
got norms, um, that, that have generality, we tend

32
00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:45.772
to think of them, and generality and, um, uh,

33
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:47.472
uh, we tend to think of them as being,

34
00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:49.601
uh, at least in the ballpark of rules.

35
00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.959
Right. And what is law then?

36
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.129
Yeah, so, um, you know, there's a debate about

37
00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:04.849
what law is that goes back, um, hundreds or

38
00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:08.050
really thousands of years, um, and the book that

39
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.050
we're talking about laws and moral practice is, um,

40
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.690
Uh, an effort to, uh, reframe how people understand

41
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.169
and think about that question, and invite people actually

42
00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.770
to recognize that there's many different ways that we

43
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.929
talk about law and many things that we might

44
00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.330
mean by law, and then to zoom in on

45
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.720
something specific that I think is neglected and often

46
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.490
misunderstood. So let me not give you like the

47
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.970
whole history of thousands of years of debate, but

48
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.330
let me sort of start in the mid-20th century.

49
00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:43.169
When HLA Hart, who was uh the professor of

50
00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.369
jurisprudence at Oxford, um, published a book called The

51
00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:50.130
Concept of Law, which argues that law is a

52
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.410
set of rules and not just any set of

53
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.770
rules, a set of rules that have a particular

54
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.690
structure. He distinguished different kinds of rules and he

55
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.130
thought there was a particular kind of rule that

56
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.250
sat at the foundation of a legal system called

57
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.770
the rule of recognition, and it picked out other

58
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.770
rules that would be part of the system. Um,

59
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.830
HEART, right, um, it's just one very famous instance

60
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.979
of somebody who thinks of law as a kind

61
00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:21.179
of Domain of normativity. It's a collection of rules

62
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.259
brought into being by our social activities. There's other

63
00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:27.979
versions of views like this. So before Hart, John

64
00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.529
Austin said that law was a set of commands,

65
00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:35.220
right? After Hart, Scott Shapiro says that law is

66
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.690
not rules, it's a set of plans, right? Um,

67
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.330
BUT what all of those folks have in common

68
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.703
is they think of there being, um, Uh, our,

69
00:03:44.863 --> 00:03:47.703
our legal activities are generating some new domain of

70
00:03:47.703 --> 00:03:51.132
normativity, right? Um, AND that law is the stuff

71
00:03:51.132 --> 00:03:53.423
is the stuff that's in there. And I want

72
00:03:53.423 --> 00:03:56.902
to invite people to think about law differently, right?

73
00:03:57.022 --> 00:04:00.742
Not that our legal activities are bringing into being

74
00:04:00.742 --> 00:04:04.563
this normative system that didn't exist before, but rather

75
00:04:04.742 --> 00:04:08.212
to understand our legal activities as things we do

76
00:04:08.462 --> 00:04:12.656
to adjust our moral relationship. So here's an analogy,

77
00:04:12.865 --> 00:04:16.026
right? So I promised you that I would join

78
00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:19.656
up to this, uh, to this video chat at

79
00:04:19.704 --> 00:04:23.906
uh at 11 a.m. my time, uh, today, right?

80
00:04:23.985 --> 00:04:27.906
And before we made that agreement by email, I

81
00:04:27.906 --> 00:04:29.985
didn't have any obligation to sit down at my

82
00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:32.906
computer and, you know, turn it on and click

83
00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:34.985
on the link you sent me and join you

84
00:04:34.985 --> 00:04:38.160
for this conversation. But after you asked, you asked

85
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.519
and I said, yes, that sounds great. I'll be

86
00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.519
there. I acquired this new obligation. I think it's

87
00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:46.200
a matter of morality. And what I want people

88
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.309
invite what I want to invite people to do

89
00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:52.959
is to think of our legal activities as practices

90
00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.799
like promising. I call them moral practices. Practices that

91
00:04:55.799 --> 00:05:00.929
are intended to adjust are moral relationships, and to

92
00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:03.679
think of legal. Claims as being a species of

93
00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:06.760
moral claim. So when I go to court and

94
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.839
I say, hey, Ricardo, you owe me compensation for

95
00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.619
this injury inflicted, right? The Harian story or the

96
00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:17.029
Scott Shapiro story is to test the truth of

97
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.959
that claim, we look to this normative system that

98
00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:23.279
was created out of our legal activities, where my

99
00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:25.679
view is, ah, I've made a moral claim. I've

100
00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:28.959
said you owe me something. And the question is

101
00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:31.829
what could make that true? And the answer might

102
00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:35.959
depend on, you know, facts about the political history,

103
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.679
the legal history of our community, but I want

104
00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:40.760
people to see law as something we do as

105
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.679
part of our moral lives, not as something that's

106
00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:43.320
separate from it.

107
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.350
And where do laws come from? How are they

108
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.140
developed? Can we say that they are invented or

109
00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.700
not?

110
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.829
Yeah, so, um, the folks who hold the kind

111
00:05:55.829 --> 00:06:00.109
of positive side of the picture, right? Hart and

112
00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:04.670
Shapiro, and Austin, and many others, um, one way

113
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.190
in which they try and capture the idea is

114
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.750
they, they think of law as an artifact, right?

115
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.250
It's something that human beings. Things have made and

116
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.769
let's look at see what the social practices are

117
00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:17.559
that make law and try and understand the social

118
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.730
social practices between the, the, the, how to understand

119
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.959
the connections between those social practices and law um

120
00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:28.010
and I'm inviting people to try out a different

121
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.869
way of understanding it. Right? Because, right, we also

122
00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:37.070
make morality, and I feel like that's a neglected

123
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.109
aspect of this conversation. Um, IN some ways I

124
00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.829
feel like the book is as much trying to

125
00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:45.299
say something about morality as it is about law.

126
00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:47.109
So what do I mean when we say we

127
00:06:47.109 --> 00:06:49.670
make morality? We'll take that example I just gave

128
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.260
you. I, um, made a promise to you and

129
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.010
brought into being this new kind of obligation that

130
00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:01.260
I would meet you here. Or maybe, um, uh,

131
00:07:01.299 --> 00:07:05.380
you know, I, uh, my, my younger son wanted

132
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.005
to go to the pool last night, and You

133
00:07:09.005 --> 00:07:12.005
know, I told him, you know, when he had

134
00:07:12.005 --> 00:07:15.404
to be home, right? And if, if I'm right

135
00:07:15.404 --> 00:07:17.304
in thinking that I have the kind of moral

136
00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:20.795
authority, um, to set the conditions of when he

137
00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:22.524
can when he can go and when he must

138
00:07:22.524 --> 00:07:25.964
come back, then my saying so created for him

139
00:07:25.964 --> 00:07:29.619
this obligation. Um, YOU know, either, you know, in

140
00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:33.200
our house, disjunctive, either be home by 7 o'clock

141
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.230
or text me and ask me for permission to

142
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.220
stay longer. Let me know that you want to,

143
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:43.209
right? Um, BUT, uh, but, but it turns out,

144
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.540
right, that that that to say that something's an

145
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.100
artifact doesn't necessarily mean to say, right, that it's

146
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.820
not a part of morality, right? Because we make

147
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.630
moral obligations too. And so I think Right, one

148
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.700
thing I share in common with positivist folks is,

149
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.309
right, I think that we make law, right, through

150
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:07.670
our legal activities, but I think that that's, that's

151
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.760
something that we're doing as part of our moral

152
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.589
lives, not something that we're doing separate from our

153
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:13.350
moral lives.

154
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.299
And why do we grant authority to certain people

155
00:08:18.299 --> 00:08:21.500
to create and enforce laws?

156
00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:27.730
Um, SO I think that we face, um, a

157
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.720
variety of challenges. Challenges, you know, like there's lots

158
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.200
of things I agree with people who work in

159
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:39.159
the positivist tradition about. Um, SO, um, so let

160
00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.000
me, you know, highlight some of that agreement. Hart

161
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.119
was particularly focused on, um, conflicts, uh, that we

162
00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:49.400
might have about what he Called the primary rules,

163
00:08:49.549 --> 00:08:54.659
rules of obligation, rules of duty, right? So, um,

164
00:08:54.669 --> 00:08:56.510
who has to pay for the upkeep of our

165
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.750
fence or when can I go on your land

166
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.500
or if we disagree about whose land it is,

167
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.309
how do we decide, right? And so hard thought

168
00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:10.890
communities that um Uh, you know, they, they faced

169
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.890
kinds of problems and coordinating on what the rules

170
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.179
were that they would live by, right? So they

171
00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:20.049
faced challenges in identifying what the rules were at

172
00:09:20.049 --> 00:09:23.289
all. They might face challenges in applying rules, they

173
00:09:23.289 --> 00:09:27.419
might face um challenges in enforcing rules, and so

174
00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:31.409
he thought our legal practices were going to provide

175
00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:33.369
answers if we could create a new set of

176
00:09:33.369 --> 00:09:37.059
socially determined rules. Right about which we could have

177
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.099
um at least some clarity and rules for adjudicating

178
00:09:41.099 --> 00:09:44.869
our disputes and rules for creating new rules, um,

179
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.890
and rules for recognizing the rules we've already got

180
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.700
that we would get ourselves out of some of

181
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.520
these problems, right? I think one reason, right, we

182
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.700
confer authority on some legal actors is something like

183
00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.520
that story, right, which is to say, um. You

184
00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.479
know, we have fights about what our rights and

185
00:10:02.479 --> 00:10:06.440
responsibilities are. Um, SOMETIMES it's really helpful to have

186
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.799
third parties that can resolve those disputes. And if

187
00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:11.619
you look at pre-legal societies, I have a colleague,

188
00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:16.590
Bill Miller, who studies, um, Lots of um honor

189
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.500
cultures, right? AND describes a cars the character of

190
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.260
the odd man. The odd man is a third

191
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.849
party, right? You've got two people who are at

192
00:10:25.849 --> 00:10:28.419
odds, they're gonna get the odd man, he's gonna

193
00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:31.739
tell them how to get even, right? Um, AND,

194
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.210
you know, a lot of our institutionalized practice. Practices

195
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:39.440
of adjudication are, are just more developed, more formalized

196
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.770
versions of that. So, so one answer is conflict,

197
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:48.239
right? Another answer is um coordination. We can accomplish

198
00:10:48.239 --> 00:10:52.690
a lot together, right? That we can't accomplish on

199
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:57.849
our own. Right, so if we create um uh

200
00:10:58.119 --> 00:11:04.359
institutions that raise taxes and um and have organizational

201
00:11:04.359 --> 00:11:08.330
capacity, they can build roads and, you know, stand

202
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.489
up armies and build rocket ships that take us

203
00:11:11.489 --> 00:11:14.570
to space. All of these reasons are also all

204
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.039
of the Like you know, these like capacity building

205
00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:21.640
coordination reasons are also good reasons to have legal

206
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.559
institutions. Um, AND we could, we could continue on

207
00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:28.840
with that. But, um, you know, there, but like

208
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.919
the more general answer is they're solving interpersonal problems

209
00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:34.349
we have and then also helping us to extend

210
00:11:34.349 --> 00:11:36.039
beyond our individual capacities.

211
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.260
And where do you think the idea that law

212
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:45.530
and morality are two completely separate things stems from

213
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.700
and uh and why, why does it seem to

214
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:53.500
be so popular among particularly legal scholars and legal

215
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.650
practitioners?

216
00:11:55.099 --> 00:11:57.369
Uh, SO I think it's actually super easy to

217
00:11:57.369 --> 00:12:01.520
understand. The law can be awful, just really, um,

218
00:12:01.616 --> 00:12:07.375
Um, terribly dreadful. And so here's a simple explanation

219
00:12:07.375 --> 00:12:09.616
for that, right? And, and actually let's, before we

220
00:12:09.616 --> 00:12:12.486
even do a simple explanation, let's just like notice

221
00:12:12.895 --> 00:12:16.395
some of the ways in which law can be

222
00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:19.935
awful, right? So I live in a country in

223
00:12:19.935 --> 00:12:22.135
the moment in which people are being, you know,

224
00:12:22.366 --> 00:12:25.976
pulled off the streets and, um, and locked up.

225
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:31.882
And deported, um, uh, you know, um, uh, unpredictably

226
00:12:31.882 --> 00:12:37.281
and for no good reason with alarming frequency, or

227
00:12:37.281 --> 00:12:41.601
for a long time, uh, in the common law

228
00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:47.731
legal world, um, a man was not considered legally

229
00:12:47.731 --> 00:12:52.989
capable of raping his wife. Or, right, well, you

230
00:12:52.989 --> 00:12:55.030
know, or we can just do lots of wars.

231
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.349
You find me a legal system and I will

232
00:12:57.349 --> 00:13:01.500
find you um uh things that are absolutely awful

233
00:13:01.909 --> 00:13:06.270
about the legal practices in our community. And this

234
00:13:06.679 --> 00:13:09.989
draws people to think, I think quite understandably, and

235
00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:13.119
I'm tempted to think this way sometimes. Oh, this

236
00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:15.830
must mean that law is something different than morality,

237
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.429
right? Why? Because, well, morality, right, will, will, um,

238
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.710
like, not morality in the sense of like what

239
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.510
people's beliefs about morality happen to be, but actual

240
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.580
morality, whatever it is, whatever we're struggling to grasp,

241
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.150
that will turn out to be a good thing

242
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:34.239
and law is so often not, right? So, um,

243
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.080
Lots of people think that law just must be

244
00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:41.690
separate from morality. I think there's clear senses in

245
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.849
which that's true. And one of the things I

246
00:13:43.849 --> 00:13:47.409
try to do in laws and moral practices highlight

247
00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:50.690
the different ways that we talk about law and

248
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.969
to notice the similarities actually with the different ways

249
00:13:52.969 --> 00:13:55.210
that we talk about morality. So I just drew

250
00:13:55.210 --> 00:14:00.260
a distinction between um What people think about morality,

251
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.140
and what morality actually is. Sometimes people draw a

252
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:07.099
distinction between, say, social morality and critical morality to

253
00:14:07.099 --> 00:14:11.989
capture that. Um, TO capture that difference, right? So

254
00:14:11.989 --> 00:14:15.469
I can ask a question, for instance, like, what's

255
00:14:15.469 --> 00:14:19.150
the morality of bond traders or, you know, what

256
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:23.640
is, um, you know, what's the morality of, um,

257
00:14:23.669 --> 00:14:25.950
you know, ICE agents or what have you, where

258
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.580
what I'm trying to understand is how do they

259
00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.349
think about the world, what do they take their

260
00:14:30.349 --> 00:14:34.109
rights and responsibilities to be, and having that kind

261
00:14:34.109 --> 00:14:38.510
of sociological conversation. I'm not saying that I think

262
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.400
bond traders have the proper view of their rights

263
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.390
and responsibilities. I'm not saying I think ICE agents

264
00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.570
behave well, right? I'm just trying to understand the

265
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.539
kind of um uh social feature of the world.

266
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.679
People have views about morality that they act on,

267
00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.169
right? I think the same is true of law.

268
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.049
I can approach it sociologically, and I can ask,

269
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.859
right, what do people around here take their rights

270
00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:06.419
and responsibilities to be and how do they carry

271
00:15:06.419 --> 00:15:08.700
on, right? But I could also do the other

272
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.219
thing, right? I could ask, what are their rights

273
00:15:11.219 --> 00:15:15.489
and responsibilities actually in light of their legal practices.

274
00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:17.919
And I think it's very important to do both.

275
00:15:18.119 --> 00:15:20.159
I think it's actually very important for a lawyer

276
00:15:20.159 --> 00:15:22.330
to be able to do both, to wear both

277
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.080
hats, to be able to say, oh I'm gonna

278
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.119
go to court, I better understand how judges and

279
00:15:27.119 --> 00:15:30.530
other lawyers think about the question. That I am

280
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.880
arguing about, but I also have to think about

281
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.020
what I think the right answer is, right? And

282
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.739
that may not just be a function of how

283
00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:39.890
other people think about it in the same way

284
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.619
that when I have an argument with a bond

285
00:15:41.619 --> 00:15:45.619
trader, you know, at, uh, um, you know, at

286
00:15:45.619 --> 00:15:47.780
a bar, right? I might be interested in what

287
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.859
he thinks, but also in telling him I think

288
00:15:49.859 --> 00:15:50.619
he has it wrong.

289
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.010
And why should we care whether law is a

290
00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.880
moral practice or not?

291
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.809
Um, SO I am of two minds about this,

292
00:16:03.099 --> 00:16:06.700
right? One is, I've got a kind of deflationary

293
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.770
view about the philosophical endeavor, which is to say,

294
00:16:10.979 --> 00:16:14.179
if you're a lawyer out there every day during

295
00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:16.460
your job, I don't think you have to worry

296
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.390
about the philosophy of law that much. I think

297
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.320
it's lurking in the background. I think occasionally you

298
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.309
bump up against it. Um, I think more frequently

299
00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:27.109
when things are breaking as they are in the

300
00:16:27.109 --> 00:16:30.710
United States right now, you bump up against philosophical

301
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.669
questions, but in your day to day work, I

302
00:16:33.669 --> 00:16:37.830
don't think you have to worry about whether law

303
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:41.940
is a moral practice. Having said that, or whether

304
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.489
positivism is true or any of these other theses.

305
00:16:44.549 --> 00:16:48.010
Having said that, Um, I do think that there

306
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.380
are reasons that I want to encourage people to

307
00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.940
see, see things this way, um, and that I

308
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.179
want to talk to my students about this, and

309
00:16:56.179 --> 00:17:00.539
let me highlight two for you. One is, I

310
00:17:00.539 --> 00:17:04.219
think we'll understand ourselves better if we see the

311
00:17:04.219 --> 00:17:07.035
way that law is a Part of our moral

312
00:17:07.035 --> 00:17:11.214
lives and uh in at least two ways we'll

313
00:17:11.214 --> 00:17:15.454
understand the significance that we accord law, um, that

314
00:17:15.454 --> 00:17:21.045
we often treat in our everyday interactions, um, uh,

315
00:17:21.214 --> 00:17:24.655
conclusions about legal rights and responsibilities as simply settling

316
00:17:24.655 --> 00:17:26.949
what we ought to do. And this would be

317
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:31.969
puzzling, I think, if law was, um, uh, you

318
00:17:31.969 --> 00:17:36.449
know, purely uh a social creation and, and not

319
00:17:36.449 --> 00:17:39.930
connected, um, to morality. It's not that it couldn't

320
00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.599
be explained, but I think it would be puzzling.

321
00:17:42.969 --> 00:17:44.729
A second way in which it might help us

322
00:17:44.729 --> 00:17:48.569
understand ourselves better is we have really deep disagreements,

323
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.540
not just about what the law should be, but

324
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:55.030
about what the law is. And that's puzzling on

325
00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:58.630
the kind of positivist picture that law is um

326
00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.790
purely a social creation, right? Because if their circumstances,

327
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.020
Ronald Workin was fond of observing this. There are

328
00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.229
circumstances where we agree on what the social facts

329
00:18:08.229 --> 00:18:11.510
are, what the statute says, what the previous decisions

330
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.589
say, and we still disagree about what law they've

331
00:18:14.589 --> 00:18:20.390
created and um I. The the sort of picture

332
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.150
that law is like our legal practices are an

333
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.979
attempt to influence our moral obligations, has a nice

334
00:18:25.979 --> 00:18:28.750
explanation of why we have these kinds of disagreements,

335
00:18:28.989 --> 00:18:31.670
which starts from the thought that well we have

336
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.949
different moral, we have lots of moral disagreements, we

337
00:18:33.949 --> 00:18:37.790
have different moral pictures, different ways of understanding our

338
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.869
background, rights and responsibilities, and so when we have

339
00:18:41.869 --> 00:18:44.630
legal practices, we're also gonna understand how those background

340
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:48.260
rights and responsibilities have been shifted. Differently. So that's

341
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.900
one class of answers. I think that um this

342
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.140
can help us understand ourselves better. Second, kind of

343
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.540
more oriented towards what I want to say to

344
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.099
lawyers, what I wanna say to students, what I

345
00:18:59.099 --> 00:19:01.780
try to say in the last chapter of laws

346
00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.380
and moral practice is that um. I think it's

347
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.140
tempting for lots of lawyers when they take this

348
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.099
approach to thinking about law that they think it's

349
00:19:12.099 --> 00:19:15.810
a separate normative system that has, you know, no

350
00:19:15.939 --> 00:19:18.810
necessary connections to law and morality and Hart's famous

351
00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.099
phrase, um, to kind of let themselves off the

352
00:19:22.099 --> 00:19:24.739
hook, right? And to think, oh, like I'm just

353
00:19:24.739 --> 00:19:26.540
doing law here, and yeah, I see that what

354
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.880
I'm doing is morally awful, or I see that

355
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.972
it's. Having terrible impacts, but my job is just

356
00:19:31.972 --> 00:19:37.171
to do law, right? Um, AND, uh, again, you

357
00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:40.092
could hold a positivist picture, right? Joseph Roz very

358
00:19:40.092 --> 00:19:42.651
famously wrote an article called Judges are Humans too,

359
00:19:42.692 --> 00:19:45.332
where the whole point was, judges aren't just subject

360
00:19:45.332 --> 00:19:46.771
to the norms of law, they're subject to the

361
00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:49.241
norms of morality. So I don't think there's anything,

362
00:19:49.332 --> 00:19:52.682
I don't think that like my positivist friends, right?

363
00:19:52.813 --> 00:19:55.443
Can't say to people, hey, you should, um, care

364
00:19:55.443 --> 00:19:58.043
about your moral responsibilities. I just think I observed

365
00:19:58.043 --> 00:20:00.764
lots of people in the world, let themselves off

366
00:20:00.764 --> 00:20:03.244
the hook for bad behavior by imagining that they're

367
00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:06.244
doing something that's called law and not morality, and

368
00:20:06.244 --> 00:20:08.484
it's other people's jobs to worry about morality. And

369
00:20:08.484 --> 00:20:10.354
I want to say to lawyers, no, no, no,

370
00:20:10.524 --> 00:20:13.764
if you properly understand what law is, it's a

371
00:20:13.764 --> 00:20:15.524
part of your moral life. You are part of

372
00:20:15.524 --> 00:20:18.885
this moral practice. This, this moral endeavor, it only

373
00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:21.666
makes a difference to us because of its connections

374
00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:25.706
um to morality. And so I want to educate

375
00:20:25.706 --> 00:20:29.156
them, educate lawyers differently, not to think of themselves

376
00:20:29.156 --> 00:20:32.745
as the high priests and priestesses of, you know,

377
00:20:33.036 --> 00:20:35.995
uh, something that's wholly different from morality, but to

378
00:20:35.995 --> 00:20:38.515
see themselves as engaged in, in a, in a

379
00:20:38.515 --> 00:20:39.755
fundamentally moral endeavor.

380
00:20:41.229 --> 00:20:45.869
When lawyers argue in court, what do they argue

381
00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:46.339
about?

382
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.540
Um, WELL, they can argue about lots of things,

383
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:55.109
right? Um, THEY can argue about facts, right, about,

384
00:20:55.199 --> 00:20:58.310
you know, you know, was Ricardo there when the

385
00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.750
gun was fired or was Ricardo not there when

386
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.750
the gun was fired and then they, you know,

387
00:21:02.949 --> 00:21:06.189
point to the evidence that's been gathered in the

388
00:21:06.189 --> 00:21:10.550
investigation or in discovery, right? They also argue about.

389
00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:14.214
Law, right? And here are two different ways of

390
00:21:14.214 --> 00:21:17.645
thinking about what it means to argue about law.

391
00:21:17.935 --> 00:21:21.324
There's the picture that I'm pushing against, which says,

392
00:21:21.535 --> 00:21:25.375
ah, what's happened in legislatures and courts and administrative

393
00:21:25.375 --> 00:21:27.974
agencies in the past has created this special set

394
00:21:27.974 --> 00:21:30.935
of rules or plans, that's the law, and we're

395
00:21:30.935 --> 00:21:33.135
all trying to figure out what's in that special

396
00:21:33.135 --> 00:21:37.260
set that applies to this case. Right? That's picture

397
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.800
number 1. Picture number 2, the picture I'm urging

398
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.729
is, well, somebody has come to court, you know,

399
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.250
in a civil suit, say a plaintiff, and they've

400
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.650
said, I have a right, and I think it's

401
00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.839
a right, typically, I'm my home is tort law,

402
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.550
right? So in tort law, right, it's a right

403
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.050
with a kind of complicated structure. They say I

404
00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:00.719
have a right to have the court enforce. A

405
00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:03.969
right to compensation against this defendant. This defendant wronged

406
00:22:03.969 --> 00:22:06.680
me. I have a right to compensation from them,

407
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.369
but not just that, I have a right to

408
00:22:08.369 --> 00:22:10.180
have a court order that person to pay me

409
00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.989
money. Right? And so I think the question that

410
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.750
that's being argued about is, is that true? Does

411
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:23.079
this person have that right? Um, AND I, you

412
00:22:23.079 --> 00:22:25.680
know, the answer I think is not to be

413
00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.319
found, right, in Kant or Aristotle or Mil or

414
00:22:30.319 --> 00:22:33.000
in any like work of philosophy because they're at

415
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.920
too high level of an abstraction, right? The things

416
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.109
that we say and do and Our lives, the

417
00:22:38.109 --> 00:22:40.430
things that we say and do in legislatures and

418
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.189
courts, they shape what rights we have in much

419
00:22:43.189 --> 00:22:46.229
the same way that practices like promising and issuing

420
00:22:46.229 --> 00:22:48.949
orders shape what rights we have. And so I

421
00:22:48.949 --> 00:22:51.430
think when you go to court, we're asking a

422
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:55.069
moral question, does this person have that right against

423
00:22:55.069 --> 00:22:58.030
a very complicated um social background?

424
00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.750
But which kinds of moral questions are contested in

425
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:04.199
court?

426
00:23:04.939 --> 00:23:10.369
Um, SO, um, Uh, so that's a good question

427
00:23:10.369 --> 00:23:12.829
because there's lots of aspects of our moral lives

428
00:23:12.829 --> 00:23:16.709
that won't surface in court, right? Um, IF my

429
00:23:16.709 --> 00:23:19.890
friend is rude to me, you know, they're scrolling

430
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.180
their phone while I'm trying to tell them something

431
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.310
important, I'm not going to sue them, right? And

432
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.050
if I do sue them, my claim will be

433
00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:30.589
dismissed, the court will say, um, uh, you failed

434
00:23:30.589 --> 00:23:33.290
to state a claim, uh, Because there's no cause

435
00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.530
of action, right? I'm not authorized. Even if, even

436
00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:38.569
if my person, even if my friend owes me

437
00:23:38.569 --> 00:23:41.369
something, right? They owe me an apology. Maybe they

438
00:23:41.369 --> 00:23:44.520
owe me, you know, another opportunity to go out

439
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.579
and have a drink and have a good conversation.

440
00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.119
So they don't just owe me an apology, they

441
00:23:48.119 --> 00:23:50.729
owe me some kind of compensation if they, they

442
00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:53.410
want to stay in good standing as friends. That's

443
00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:57.260
not something I can enforce in court. Right, so,

444
00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.510
um, I tend to think of, um, when we're

445
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:04.109
thinking about law as a part of morality, I

446
00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:07.040
tend to think Um, in the way that Ronald

447
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.280
Orin suggested, we, uh, we think in the very

448
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.800
last book he wrote that, um, that law is

449
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.930
picking out or or or sort of like when

450
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.359
we talk about legal rights, let's say, that modifier

451
00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:21.079
legal is picking out a a special subset of

452
00:24:21.079 --> 00:24:25.050
our ordinary moral rights. It's rights that we're entitled

453
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:29.859
to enforce through legal institutions like courts or administrative

454
00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:32.239
agencies. That's why I said a tort suit has

455
00:24:32.239 --> 00:24:35.130
this kind of complicated structure. It's not just hey

456
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:38.530
you owe me money, right? It's, it's you owe

457
00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.939
me money, and in a way for a reason

458
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:47.369
that I can demand that these legal institutions tell

459
00:24:47.369 --> 00:24:50.030
you to pay me. Right? And so then it's

460
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.510
like an interesting question. Why do we make some

461
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:56.060
of our rights enforceable through these institutions and others

462
00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.150
we just leave to informal negotiation, right? You know,

463
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:04.750
among acquaintances or among friends. And I think the

464
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.084
answer there is because there's a kind of Constant

465
00:25:08.084 --> 00:25:13.515
trade-off to be made. Legal institutions are expensive. They

466
00:25:13.515 --> 00:25:19.964
um are clumsy, they are time consuming, um, they

467
00:25:19.964 --> 00:25:24.125
can be really disruptive to people's lives, um, and

468
00:25:24.125 --> 00:25:28.000
so, um, I. You know, we're not gonna use

469
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
them for really trivial things like you were scrolling

470
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.839
through your phone or you were a few minutes

471
00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:37.150
late when we said we had lunch. We're going

472
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.400
to use them for the most part, when there's

473
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:48.020
been really serious breaches of of um. Of morality

474
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.510
or really serious um injuries, um, but not just

475
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:57.020
that actually, right? Um, ALSO, right, really serious problems,

476
00:25:57.099 --> 00:26:00.660
but really serious problems that courts can remedy. Because,

477
00:26:00.819 --> 00:26:05.099
for instance, right, like, you know, your friend betraying

478
00:26:05.099 --> 00:26:07.660
you, right, in some more substantive way, let's say,

479
00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:09.500
than scrolling on your phone might be a really

480
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.750
serious moral breach. It's really hard for courts to

481
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:16.510
patch up friendships, right? Um, YOU know, the tools

482
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.300
they have in their kit, you know, pay money,

483
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.589
right? Don't work as well. So they can patch

484
00:26:21.589 --> 00:26:24.469
up commercial relationships, much better they can patch up

485
00:26:24.469 --> 00:26:27.430
friendships. Um, SO we use them where it's worth

486
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:31.869
using them, and we use them um when they

487
00:26:31.869 --> 00:26:32.819
might be helpful.

488
00:26:34.709 --> 00:26:38.949
Does the law hold the answer to all legal

489
00:26:38.949 --> 00:26:39.589
questions?

490
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.609
Does the law hold the answer to all legal

491
00:26:43.609 --> 00:26:49.949
questions? Um, SO, um, You know, there there's this,

492
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.229
uh, there's this kind of debate, especially on the,

493
00:26:53.239 --> 00:26:55.959
um, well, this is kind of debate among philosophers

494
00:26:55.959 --> 00:27:02.550
of law, right, as to, um, As to um

495
00:27:02.949 --> 00:27:05.219
uh whether the law is ever indeterminate. So think

496
00:27:05.219 --> 00:27:07.189
of a legal question, right? Or think of a

497
00:27:07.189 --> 00:27:10.510
legal claim. I say I have a right, right,

498
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.469
a right against Ricardo. Ricardo owes me, I don't

499
00:27:13.469 --> 00:27:18.829
know, $100,000 right? Um, AND, and here are at

500
00:27:18.829 --> 00:27:22.900
least two possibilities. My claim could be true. Right,

501
00:27:23.079 --> 00:27:26.339
my claim could be false, right? And then there's

502
00:27:26.339 --> 00:27:29.729
like there's a question, is there a third possibility?

503
00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:34.800
Could it be neither true nor false, right? That

504
00:27:34.979 --> 00:27:39.699
I have a right to $100,000 from Ricardo, as

505
00:27:39.699 --> 00:27:42.660
a legal matter? Could it be neither true nor

506
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.020
false? And then there's a downstream question from that.

507
00:27:45.099 --> 00:27:46.579
If you think the answer is yes, it could

508
00:27:46.579 --> 00:27:50.780
be neither true nor false, then um then what

509
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.989
should be done about it? Right, um, and, uh,

510
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.119
you know, one phase of the argument, say, between

511
00:27:58.119 --> 00:28:01.359
Hart and Dworin was about just this question. Hart

512
00:28:01.359 --> 00:28:04.439
thought that the law could be indeterminate because it

513
00:28:04.439 --> 00:28:07.319
might turn out to be that that there was

514
00:28:07.319 --> 00:28:12.229
no rule in the set. Of rules that counted

515
00:28:12.229 --> 00:28:15.390
as the law that applied to a particular kind

516
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.109
of case or a particular kind of question. It

517
00:28:18.109 --> 00:28:20.550
would just be legally unregulated. There would be no

518
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.469
answer and Hart thought, what's gonna happen in cases

519
00:28:23.469 --> 00:28:26.630
like that if courts nevertheless have to provide an

520
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:30.890
answer is they'll create one. And depending on the

521
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.770
rules about the creation of new norms, they're creating

522
00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.689
an answer might mean that there is now a

523
00:28:35.689 --> 00:28:38.550
rule going forward, that might be how precedent works,

524
00:28:38.729 --> 00:28:42.579
right? But Hart thought that there was significant indeterminacy,

525
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:47.010
um, and, uh, and necessarily so, he argues in

526
00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:51.800
the concept of law. And Dwarkin famously defended, um,

527
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:54.209
uh, not quite the opposite view, but close to

528
00:28:54.209 --> 00:28:57.650
the opposite view. He argued that there was always

529
00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:02.219
a right answer. Right, that, um, that somebody has

530
00:29:02.219 --> 00:29:04.660
come to court and they say they have a

531
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.979
right, and either they do have the right or

532
00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:10.140
they don't have a right, right? And he observed

533
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.500
that courts never, never, right, throw up their hands

534
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.380
and say, ah, there's just no answer to this

535
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.699
question. They answer the question, right? And somebody who's

536
00:29:19.699 --> 00:29:22.780
defending the, the hardy and the positivist kind of

537
00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.859
picture will say, oh yeah, they answer it, but

538
00:29:24.859 --> 00:29:27.500
they know there's no really no answer, right? They

539
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.859
just don't want to say that cause it would

540
00:29:28.859 --> 00:29:31.819
undermine their authority. So they have explanations of why

541
00:29:31.819 --> 00:29:34.859
courts don't say there's no answer. And working for

542
00:29:34.859 --> 00:29:36.300
his part, you know, if you got him in

543
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.140
a quiet moment, he might say, could I imagine

544
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:43.729
a case where, like, the arguments were exactly tied,

545
00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.900
right? You know, like they had equal weight on

546
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.050
both sides. He's like, I guess I can imagine

547
00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.770
it, but it seems to me so incredibly unlikely

548
00:29:51.979 --> 00:29:54.275
that if I thought that I was in that

549
00:29:54.275 --> 00:29:57.994
position of equipoise in the arguments, I would think

550
00:29:57.994 --> 00:29:59.675
I should go back and do more homework and

551
00:29:59.675 --> 00:30:02.074
keep going to try and figure out if one

552
00:30:02.074 --> 00:30:05.145
of these sides has the, has the better argument

553
00:30:05.145 --> 00:30:07.074
than the other, right? I think of one of

554
00:30:07.074 --> 00:30:12.175
Dwarkin's great contributions to legal philosophy, but contributions generally,

555
00:30:12.834 --> 00:30:16.599
was to remind people that. The fact that it's

556
00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:18.640
hard to answer a question does not mean that

557
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.859
there's no answer. The fact that we disagree about,

558
00:30:22.209 --> 00:30:24.800
um, the answer to a question does not mean

559
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.000
that there's no answer. In fact, he said, the

560
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.640
fact that we disagree and it's hard and we

561
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.520
keep going, tells you that we're presupposing that there

562
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.130
is an answer, right? Maybe we're Wrong, right? But

563
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:40.010
he wanted people to understand that indeterminacy is not

564
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:42.369
a kind of default position that we argue ourselves

565
00:30:42.369 --> 00:30:46.520
out of. It's as much a conclusion, right, as,

566
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.489
uh, you know, there is no answer is as

567
00:30:48.489 --> 00:30:51.609
much a conclusion as Ricardo wins or Ricardo loses.

568
00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.089
It needs an argument in its favor, and he

569
00:30:54.089 --> 00:30:55.729
thought it was very unlikely to be there.

570
00:30:57.119 --> 00:30:59.890
And what is natural law?

571
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:04.089
Yeah, it's a phrase I like to avoid because

572
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.900
it has meant lots of different things to lots

573
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.250
of different people at lots of points in history.

574
00:31:11.339 --> 00:31:13.300
So let me in a very kind of crude

575
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:19.709
way. Distinguish um two ways of thinking about natural

576
00:31:19.709 --> 00:31:23.510
law, right? So one way of thinking about natural

577
00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:27.589
law says, oh look, there's this, there's this like

578
00:31:27.589 --> 00:31:31.790
realm of legal rights and obligations that human beings

579
00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.670
haven't created and our job is to use the

580
00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:39.550
power of our minds to ascertain. Um, TO ascertain

581
00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:43.189
what's in that set, and then, you know, uh,

582
00:31:43.239 --> 00:31:46.359
some people would append to that thought that positive

583
00:31:46.359 --> 00:31:49.079
law, the law made by human beings, is valid

584
00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:53.619
only insofar as it matches up with what's in

585
00:31:53.839 --> 00:31:56.400
the natural law, right? And a lot of the

586
00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.160
early positivists set themselves in opposition to that kind

587
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.209
of picture. Right, so, you know, an old natural

588
00:32:03.209 --> 00:32:05.609
law slogan might have been an unjust law is

589
00:32:05.609 --> 00:32:07.969
not a law where the thought was, you know,

590
00:32:08.089 --> 00:32:11.609
oh look, an unjust um posited law is not

591
00:32:11.609 --> 00:32:16.329
gonna count as like a full-blooded enforceable law, right?

592
00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.489
Um, YOU know, sometimes people want to lump folks

593
00:32:19.489 --> 00:32:22.609
like Twin or me or Mark Greenberg is another

594
00:32:22.609 --> 00:32:27.359
contemporary anti-positivist. In with a tradition like that, and

595
00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:29.550
I don't think we fit very well, which is

596
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:34.040
one reason that I want to um avoid the

597
00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.640
term, right? Because what we're saying is not that

598
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.969
there's um this, you know, Like set of secret

599
00:32:42.969 --> 00:32:45.930
books somewhere that tell you like, you know, what

600
00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.010
the laws of the universe are or what God's

601
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.719
law is, and that human law has to match

602
00:32:50.719 --> 00:32:54.729
up to it. What what we're saying is that

603
00:32:54.729 --> 00:33:01.000
um I I We engage in legal practices, um,

604
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:05.900
in part, right, to adjust our moral relationships and

605
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.699
the question what rights and obligations we have is

606
00:33:08.699 --> 00:33:14.410
best understood as a kind of moral question, um,

607
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.219
but as I was discussing earlier, that doesn't mean

608
00:33:16.219 --> 00:33:18.780
that human beings aren't making legal rights and obligations.

609
00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.209
We're doing it in the same way that we

610
00:33:20.209 --> 00:33:27.089
make promissory rights and obligations. Um, SO, uh, you

611
00:33:27.089 --> 00:33:29.520
know, I feel like it's some misleading to, to,

612
00:33:29.839 --> 00:33:33.050
um, or it's confusing, right, to take this phrase

613
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:35.729
natural law and try to apply it to two

614
00:33:35.729 --> 00:33:40.119
really such different, such different views, um. But it's

615
00:33:40.119 --> 00:33:41.630
also true, and I try to say this a

616
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.199
little bit at the explain this a little bit

617
00:33:43.199 --> 00:33:45.760
at the end of law, is a moral practice

618
00:33:46.079 --> 00:33:50.160
that um that um that lots of possivists will

619
00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.040
turn out to count as natural lawyers on some

620
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.750
ways that the phrase has been understood as well,

621
00:33:54.959 --> 00:33:58.680
right? So I mentioned Joseph Roz, right, who insisted

622
00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.410
that um That uh the judges are people too.

623
00:34:03.449 --> 00:34:06.439
They're subject to morality and in fact he thought

624
00:34:06.439 --> 00:34:09.610
they should look to law to resolve cases because

625
00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:13.429
sometimes that's their moral responsibility, right? So if all

626
00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.168
it means to be as a natural lawyer is

627
00:34:15.168 --> 00:34:17.929
to mean that ultimately what a person ought to

628
00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:20.728
do is a function of morality and not a

629
00:34:20.728 --> 00:34:22.850
function of law, then a lot of positivists turn

630
00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.770
out to be natural lawyers in that way too.

631
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:28.090
So I've given a confusing answer because it's a

632
00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:32.179
confusing phrase. Um, IN part because it has a

633
00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:35.010
has a kind of long and a very varied

634
00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:35.260
history.

635
00:34:36.418 --> 00:34:39.739
In the book you argue that there are different

636
00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:43.658
sets of norms that constitute what we call the

637
00:34:43.658 --> 00:34:45.697
law. Could you explain that?

638
00:34:45.849 --> 00:34:51.938
Yeah, so I um Uh, I think if the,

639
00:34:51.958 --> 00:34:54.239
the project is ecumenical. What I want to try

640
00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:57.519
and do is explain why people are attracted to

641
00:34:57.519 --> 00:35:00.408
positivism, why people are attracted to what we in

642
00:35:00.408 --> 00:35:04.599
the states call legal realism, why, but then also

643
00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:06.820
why it's important to hold. Onto this idea that

644
00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:10.409
law is a moral practice. And one way of

645
00:35:10.739 --> 00:35:14.209
getting at all this is through analogy I offer

646
00:35:14.209 --> 00:35:16.300
to thinking about the rules in my household. So

647
00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.780
I told you about like the rule, you get

648
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.979
to be home by 7 or you got to

649
00:35:18.979 --> 00:35:21.699
text me and tell me that you, um, that

650
00:35:21.699 --> 00:35:25.229
you won't be. Um, SO, you know, I imagine

651
00:35:25.229 --> 00:35:28.939
this conversation, right? Maybe, maybe my family is having

652
00:35:28.939 --> 00:35:31.580
some difficulty and we go and we go to

653
00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.419
see a therapist and she says, oh, what are

654
00:35:33.419 --> 00:35:37.030
the rules of your house? Right. And well, there's

655
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.679
lots of things that you might get at, right?

656
00:35:39.699 --> 00:35:42.469
And asking that question. Suppose I say, oh, you

657
00:35:42.469 --> 00:35:44.270
have like the rules of the house is our

658
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.790
younger son has to be in bed by 8:30,

659
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.389
right? And then she might say, well, is he

660
00:35:50.389 --> 00:35:53.060
in bed by 8:30? And I might say, no,

661
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:57.629
no, it's usually closer to 8:45, 9 o'clock, and

662
00:35:57.629 --> 00:35:59.530
she might respond, well, that isn't really a rule

663
00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.810
of the house, is it? Right, so just think

664
00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.899
about what's happened in that conversation. Right, when she

665
00:36:04.899 --> 00:36:06.780
first asked for the rules of the house, I

666
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.219
heard her in a certain kind of way, right?

667
00:36:09.419 --> 00:36:13.100
I heard her to be wondering what rules do

668
00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:16.500
you articulate? What what rules do you announce? What

669
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.620
rules do you take yourself to have adopted? Right?

670
00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.979
But then it turns out when she, she's observing

671
00:36:22.979 --> 00:36:25.780
a mismatch between that and another set of rules,

672
00:36:25.979 --> 00:36:28.620
right? The rules that we enforce or the rules

673
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:33.459
that are followed, right? And um, uh, you know,

674
00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.979
lawyers are familiar with this contrast, at least in

675
00:36:36.979 --> 00:36:39.860
the states we have this phrase, we talk about

676
00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.399
the difference between law on the books and law

677
00:36:42.399 --> 00:36:45.550
in action. Right? So what do we mean? Well,

678
00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:48.949
there's a sign near my house, right, that says

679
00:36:48.949 --> 00:36:53.709
the speed limit on on I-94, the highway, is

680
00:36:53.860 --> 00:37:01.040
uh 70 MPH. Um, uh, BUT everybody that lives

681
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.100
around here knows that you're not gonna get pulled

682
00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.280
over by a police officer if you're traveling 71

683
00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.719
or 72. No one really starts to worry until

684
00:37:10.719 --> 00:37:13.360
they're driving 75, and even then they think it's

685
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.120
unlikely, it's probably like 77 or 78, where it

686
00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.320
becomes a legitimate possibility, right, that you might be

687
00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.239
stopped. And so some people look at this and

688
00:37:23.239 --> 00:37:26.330
they say, oh, the real speed limit is 77,

689
00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:29.479
78, right? It's not the law in the books,

690
00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:33.280
it's the law in action. And I think I

691
00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:37.479
understand that thought, right? That, like, you know, oh,

692
00:37:37.689 --> 00:37:40.129
you know, maybe, maybe if you're trying to acculturate

693
00:37:40.129 --> 00:37:42.489
someone around here, you might say to them knowingly,

694
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.239
the real speed limit is 77 miles an hour.

695
00:37:45.409 --> 00:37:48.209
You're giving them useful information that you can drive

696
00:37:48.209 --> 00:37:51.330
up to that speed and nobody's going to bother

697
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.610
you. But here's the thing, suppose you're the unlucky

698
00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:58.639
person, right, who does get pulled over traveling 75.

699
00:37:59.209 --> 00:38:02.070
You can't go to court and say, oh yeah,

700
00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.560
but the real speed limit is 77, right? Because

701
00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.469
the court's gonna say, well what what number was

702
00:38:07.469 --> 00:38:10.389
on the sign? It was 70, that's the speed

703
00:38:10.389 --> 00:38:12.429
limit, right? So part of what I'm trying to

704
00:38:12.429 --> 00:38:15.909
do is draw attention to the fact that we

705
00:38:15.909 --> 00:38:18.310
talk about what the law is in different ways,

706
00:38:18.389 --> 00:38:19.989
in the same way that we might talk about

707
00:38:19.989 --> 00:38:21.669
the rules of my house in different ways or

708
00:38:21.669 --> 00:38:24.080
to go back to Our earlier conversation, we might

709
00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:28.280
talk about morality in different ways. Sometimes, right, we're

710
00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.560
interested in what's been announced or what's been written

711
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.360
down. Sometimes we're interested in what's been enforced and

712
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.629
what I'm trying to remember to remind people of,

713
00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.199
we might also be interested in the question, what

714
00:38:38.199 --> 00:38:40.979
are you actually obligated to do. Right, and I

715
00:38:40.979 --> 00:38:44.120
think in court that is the primary question, what

716
00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.939
are you actually obligated to do, right? But the

717
00:38:46.939 --> 00:38:50.739
explanation of why I think people are drawn to

718
00:38:50.739 --> 00:38:55.449
positivist pictures or realist pictures is that they um

719
00:38:55.449 --> 00:39:00.469
is that they track, um. These like many useful,

720
00:39:00.489 --> 00:39:03.010
helpful ways of thinking about law, right? If you

721
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.850
live under law, you should want to know what

722
00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:07.129
the police are going to do, even if you

723
00:39:07.129 --> 00:39:09.409
think it's not what they're permitted to do, even

724
00:39:09.409 --> 00:39:11.389
if you think it's not what's written down, you

725
00:39:11.389 --> 00:39:13.370
should want to know what they're going to do,

726
00:39:13.689 --> 00:39:15.530
right? But you should also be interested in what

727
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.129
they're permitted to do, and maybe you should be

728
00:39:18.129 --> 00:39:20.889
interested in, you know, how judges are going to

729
00:39:20.889 --> 00:39:23.760
understand. What their permissions are, even if that's different

730
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.959
from what you think their permissions are. So I

731
00:39:25.959 --> 00:39:27.719
just think it turns out the law, the word

732
00:39:27.719 --> 00:39:29.719
law is very flexible and we really need to

733
00:39:29.719 --> 00:39:32.120
do a better job of paying attention to all

734
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.080
of the ways that we that we use it.

735
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.860
But referring to something you mentioned there, uh, I

736
00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:42.419
mean, what are we obligated to do really? Are

737
00:39:42.419 --> 00:39:46.979
people obligated to obey the law? How do we

738
00:39:46.979 --> 00:39:48.010
approach this question?

739
00:39:48.989 --> 00:39:51.629
Yeah, so this is another one of the, the

740
00:39:51.629 --> 00:39:57.510
huge debates that um that philosophers have uh have

741
00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:00.659
been having about law at least since Plato probably

742
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:03.629
uh probably before. And what I try and do

743
00:40:03.629 --> 00:40:06.909
in law as a moral practice is just um

744
00:40:06.909 --> 00:40:11.030
frame the issue a little differently than it has

745
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.149
in the past, has has been framed in the

746
00:40:13.149 --> 00:40:16.750
past. So, um. If you have this picture of

747
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.510
law as a separate normative system, and you see

748
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:21.510
all these rules over here, right? And they've been

749
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.939
created by our social practices, and the question is,

750
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:27.989
do we have moral obligations to follow those rules?

751
00:40:29.159 --> 00:40:31.719
Right, um, and you know, there's a very famous

752
00:40:31.719 --> 00:40:35.800
article, um, uh, by a philosopher named MBE Smith

753
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.159
called Is there a prima facie Obligation to obey

754
00:40:38.159 --> 00:40:40.399
the Law, where he says the answer is no.

755
00:40:40.929 --> 00:40:44.070
And he works through historically, all the many answers

756
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.669
that have been given from people who wanted to

757
00:40:45.669 --> 00:40:48.370
say yes and he shows quite convincingly, they're they're

758
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.030
pretty bad answers, right? It may be that in

759
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.949
some cases, like you should do what the law

760
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:57.070
what the law requires because it's independently a good

761
00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:59.550
thing to do, right? Like that's commonly the case,

762
00:40:59.669 --> 00:41:02.149
right? You know, the law says, you know, don't

763
00:41:02.149 --> 00:41:04.909
assault people and assault people, assaulting people is generally

764
00:41:04.909 --> 00:41:06.909
a bad thing to do. So you have Smith

765
00:41:06.909 --> 00:41:10.209
says a specific obligation. Right, but the mere fact

766
00:41:10.209 --> 00:41:13.219
that something's against the law, right, Smith wants to

767
00:41:13.219 --> 00:41:17.260
say doesn't um imply, right, even a prima facie

768
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.939
obligation not to do, uh, not to do what

769
00:41:20.939 --> 00:41:26.290
the law has prohibited. So I think that Smith

770
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.729
is looking in the wrong place for the moral

771
00:41:29.729 --> 00:41:34.050
differences that our legal practices make. I agree with

772
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:37.169
him, right, that that most of the time, right,

773
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.409
the law can't make something impermissible just by saying

774
00:41:40.409 --> 00:41:45.830
it's impermissible, right? There are There are exceptions, right?

775
00:41:45.909 --> 00:41:47.550
You know, which relate back to some of the

776
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.110
conversations we're having earlier about the, the tasks of

777
00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:52.790
law, right? Sometimes we need to coordinate our conduct,

778
00:41:52.899 --> 00:41:55.429
right? You know, like the street sweepers are coming

779
00:41:55.429 --> 00:41:58.409
through, right? And, you know, somebody needs to tell

780
00:41:58.409 --> 00:42:00.949
us, you know, when to move our cars so

781
00:42:00.949 --> 00:42:03.580
that the streets can be cleaned, right? I think

782
00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.649
we're, when Right, and order is serving a kind

783
00:42:06.649 --> 00:42:08.649
of moral function like that, then it turns out

784
00:42:08.649 --> 00:42:11.810
the law can create an obligation just by telling

785
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.969
you what to do, right? But the law makes

786
00:42:14.969 --> 00:42:20.030
other kinds of moral differences, right? So, um, uh,

787
00:42:20.209 --> 00:42:22.209
you know, even when it's telling you not to

788
00:42:22.209 --> 00:42:25.199
do something that you should know not to do.

789
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:29.550
Um, IT'S, uh, it's making a moral difference. So

790
00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:31.719
in the chapter on the obligation to obey the

791
00:42:31.719 --> 00:42:36.719
law in laws and moral practice, I, um, talk

792
00:42:36.719 --> 00:42:41.560
about this awful case involving, uh, teenagers, um, I

793
00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.919
think it was, oh no, I've forgotten the state

794
00:42:43.919 --> 00:42:47.780
already, I think it was in Oklahoma, um, uh,

795
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.739
you know, a teenage boy who, um, uh, who

796
00:42:53.169 --> 00:42:55.510
Well, actually, you know, like, uh maybe because people

797
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:57.590
aren't expecting this. I, I, I won't describe in

798
00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:00.310
any detail um that uh it was it a

799
00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:01.830
case of sexual assault, and I just won't describe

800
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:04.310
in any detail what it was, um, that the

801
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.429
boy was accused of doing, but I'll, but I

802
00:43:06.429 --> 00:43:09.909
will say this, right, um, the charges against him

803
00:43:09.909 --> 00:43:14.620
were dismissed for fairly technical reasons because the statute

804
00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:18.050
that he was being prosecuted under. Um, HAD been

805
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:20.800
drafted in a way that it didn't actually cover

806
00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:24.330
what he had done, even though it was obviously

807
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:27.850
intended to do so. And almost immediately people, people

808
00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:32.209
were outraged, understandably so, and almost immediately the legislator

809
00:43:32.209 --> 00:43:35.449
amended the statute, right, so that it would going

810
00:43:35.449 --> 00:43:39.129
forward cover what what this teenage boy had done.

811
00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.229
And so here's the kind of question you might

812
00:43:41.229 --> 00:43:45.830
ask, like, what changed morally as a result of

813
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.179
as a result of the adoption of that statute?

814
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.939
And I don't think that his primary obligations did.

815
00:43:50.989 --> 00:43:52.629
It was always wrong for him to act the

816
00:43:52.629 --> 00:43:55.389
way he did, right? Um, IT didn't didn't need

817
00:43:55.389 --> 00:43:57.629
the state legislature to tell him that it was

818
00:43:57.629 --> 00:44:03.550
wrong, right? Um, BUT something really important changed, right,

819
00:44:03.649 --> 00:44:07.679
which is that the, the state. Got the power

820
00:44:07.679 --> 00:44:10.760
to hold him to account, right? So, uh, in

821
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.739
criminal law we talked about the principle of legality,

822
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.280
that you can't be punished for something that wasn't

823
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.129
announced as unlawful in advanced, right? Even if it

824
00:44:19.129 --> 00:44:21.879
was immoral, right? And we've got good reasons for

825
00:44:21.879 --> 00:44:26.330
constraining state power this way. So I, I, um.

826
00:44:26.639 --> 00:44:28.719
YOU know, I think when our legal practices are

827
00:44:28.719 --> 00:44:31.560
defective, it's often the case that we're not obligated

828
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.590
to do what people think we're obligated to do.

829
00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.360
I also think it's the case that when they're

830
00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.550
defective, sometimes we're obligated not to do something that

831
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:44.320
looks permissible from the law's perspective, right? But that

832
00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.000
when we think about what the moral significance of

833
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.600
our legal practices are, sometimes it's creating new relations

834
00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.679
of accountability, like with this Oklahoma case that I'm

835
00:44:52.679 --> 00:44:53.120
describing.

836
00:44:54.679 --> 00:44:57.639
In the book, you also talk about the central

837
00:44:57.639 --> 00:45:01.750
worry that people have about linking law and morality.

838
00:45:01.879 --> 00:45:05.310
What is that worry and how should we deal

839
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:05.830
with it?

840
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.260
Well, so it connects again back to some of

841
00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:12.340
the conversations we've been having so far. I think

842
00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:14.659
one worry, um, I can't remember if I call

843
00:45:14.659 --> 00:45:17.020
this the central worry, but I probably did. The

844
00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:21.340
one worry that, uh, that people have is that

845
00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:23.300
if we see law as part of our moral

846
00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.659
lives, we'll lose our ability to criticize law, right?

847
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:31.020
Um, THIS was, um, you know, a worry expressed

848
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:36.125
by Hansel. AMONG others, um, that, uh, that we

849
00:45:36.125 --> 00:45:39.084
need to understand law as a social practice and

850
00:45:39.084 --> 00:45:41.834
to recognize that our social practices can be bad

851
00:45:42.205 --> 00:45:44.725
and uh and that will give us this kind

852
00:45:44.725 --> 00:45:48.125
of critical distance so people don't fall into the

853
00:45:48.125 --> 00:45:50.604
habit of hearing the word obligation or duty in

854
00:45:50.604 --> 00:45:53.284
a legal context and thinking that it means they

855
00:45:53.284 --> 00:45:55.764
really should or must do the thing that they're

856
00:45:55.764 --> 00:46:00.330
being told to do. Um, I think, um, this

857
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:04.639
is sort of like selling people short. Um, WHY?

858
00:46:04.949 --> 00:46:08.080
Well, so first of all, I think that, um,

859
00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:12.719
uh, we criticize, um, aspects of our moral lives

860
00:46:12.719 --> 00:46:17.679
all the time, right? Um, SO, uh, uh, Sophia

861
00:46:17.679 --> 00:46:22.360
Moreau teaches at NYU, um, has a paper that

862
00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:26.020
uh that she's working on about objectionable obligations. Um,

863
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.020
WHICH is really capturing better than I did in

864
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.290
the book, the idea that I'm trying to capture,

865
00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:33.179
right? But sometimes we take ourselves to have genuine

866
00:46:33.179 --> 00:46:36.260
moral obligations and nevertheless think it's objectionable that we

867
00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:40.340
have them. So, uh, to take, um, to take

868
00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:45.050
a um a familiar example, right? Um, IN our

869
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:49.979
society we tend to um assign uh caregiving responsibilities

870
00:46:49.979 --> 00:46:55.610
to women. Um, DISPROPORTIONATELY, discriminatorily so, and so you

871
00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:59.469
might think in a particular case, right, um, you

872
00:46:59.469 --> 00:47:01.790
might have two thoughts. You might have like, well,

873
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:04.219
there's somebody here who's dependent, maybe it's a child,

874
00:47:04.389 --> 00:47:07.629
maybe it's an elderly relative. You might think that

875
00:47:07.629 --> 00:47:10.909
this, this mom or this daughter, they really do

876
00:47:10.909 --> 00:47:14.979
owe this person a responsibility. Right, um, they would,

877
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.169
they would wrong the person in their care if

878
00:47:17.169 --> 00:47:18.939
they didn't show up to take them to the

879
00:47:18.939 --> 00:47:21.639
doctor or didn't, um, feed them or what have

880
00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:24.449
you. You might also think it's objectionable that they

881
00:47:24.449 --> 00:47:27.409
have the obligation. Right, that the obligation hasn't been

882
00:47:27.409 --> 00:47:29.419
assigned to someone else, maybe a man, or that

883
00:47:29.419 --> 00:47:32.370
the obligation hasn't been shared, or that the obligation

884
00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.209
hasn't been dedicated to an institution or, you know,

885
00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:40.080
to, to free individuals from the burdens of, of

886
00:47:40.489 --> 00:47:44.850
um discharging it themselves. And so, um, so we

887
00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:47.729
can think, oh, there's a genuine obligation here, and

888
00:47:47.729 --> 00:47:50.399
also it's objectionable and we ought to rearrange our

889
00:47:50.399 --> 00:47:52.969
social practices so that people don't have this obligation.

890
00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:56.600
I think law gets us in that situation all

891
00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:01.689
the time. Right, that we have genuine obligations, right?

892
00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:05.590
But we also shouldn't have those obligations or that

893
00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:08.780
we have duties, but we shouldn't have those duties.

894
00:48:08.989 --> 00:48:11.340
And so once you see this feature of morality,

895
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:13.949
right? And what's the feature? The feature is what

896
00:48:13.949 --> 00:48:16.389
our actual rights and responsibilities are do depend on

897
00:48:16.389 --> 00:48:20.870
our social practices, right? Um, I am responsible for

898
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:23.350
caring and feeding for my children because of particular

899
00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:26.110
social practices. We could have other social practices, communal

900
00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:29.409
practices of raising children. That would assign that responsibility

901
00:48:29.409 --> 00:48:32.649
differently, right? So, but, but, but my genuine moral

902
00:48:32.649 --> 00:48:35.290
rights and responsibilities do depend on our social practices,

903
00:48:35.409 --> 00:48:37.689
but also our practices might be objectionable, they might

904
00:48:37.689 --> 00:48:40.449
be things that we should reform because they're better

905
00:48:40.449 --> 00:48:43.239
ways of living. I think that's a fairly standard

906
00:48:43.239 --> 00:48:44.929
feature of our moral lives and then it turns

907
00:48:44.929 --> 00:48:46.689
out to be a fairly standard feature of our

908
00:48:46.689 --> 00:48:47.489
legal lives too.

909
00:48:49.199 --> 00:48:53.320
What can all of these teaches about lawyers? What

910
00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:56.530
is exactly the kind of work that lawyers do

911
00:48:56.530 --> 00:49:00.000
and do they have any form of moral expertise?

912
00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:03.399
Yeah, so, um, I think, uh, one of the

913
00:49:03.399 --> 00:49:06.149
claims that people find most startling in the book

914
00:49:06.439 --> 00:49:11.350
is that, um, that, uh, that lawyers, well, first,

915
00:49:11.639 --> 00:49:14.399
lawyers are engaging in moral arguments, right? I think

916
00:49:14.399 --> 00:49:16.479
they're trying to sort out when they go to

917
00:49:16.479 --> 00:49:19.280
court and argue over claims, they're trying to sort

918
00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.919
out the moral consequences of our legal practices, who

919
00:49:21.919 --> 00:49:25.919
has what rights and responsibilities in virtue of our

920
00:49:25.919 --> 00:49:29.530
political history. Right? Um, THE second claim, the one

921
00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.370
that people find startling that goes along with that

922
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:32.929
is that I think that lawyers have a kind

923
00:49:32.929 --> 00:49:36.530
of moral expertise, right? Um, IT doesn't mean that

924
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:39.199
I always think that they're immoral, often they're not,

925
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:41.280
and I try and account in the last half

926
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.449
of the last chapter for reasons that lawyers behave

927
00:49:44.449 --> 00:49:47.010
immorally. But before that, I want to defend a

928
00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:50.649
kind of moral expertise. What is it consistent? Well,

929
00:49:50.919 --> 00:49:54.399
if our moral rights and responsibilities depend on our

930
00:49:54.399 --> 00:49:58.280
political history, depends on who's made what decisions and

931
00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:01.949
um and how were cases resolved in the past,

932
00:50:02.159 --> 00:50:05.159
then one source of expertise will be knowing what

933
00:50:05.159 --> 00:50:08.189
decisions have been made, knowing how cases have been

934
00:50:08.189 --> 00:50:10.850
decided, or if you don't know that, knowing where

935
00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:14.239
and how to look, right? So, knowing, I, I

936
00:50:14.239 --> 00:50:17.040
put it this way, knowing the morally relevant facts,

937
00:50:17.239 --> 00:50:20.199
that's a kind of moral expertise. Second kind of

938
00:50:20.199 --> 00:50:23.800
moral expertise is, um, you know, like this is

939
00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:27.560
not just, um, uh, any corner of our moral

940
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:32.719
lives, right? Legal decisions, um, uh, you know, take

941
00:50:32.719 --> 00:50:36.834
place in particular institutions. That are structured in particular

942
00:50:36.834 --> 00:50:40.215
ways that have a recurring set of concerns, right?

943
00:50:40.294 --> 00:50:41.574
So part of what you get when you get

944
00:50:41.574 --> 00:50:46.135
educated as a lawyer is, right? Education into the

945
00:50:46.135 --> 00:50:50.455
concerns in this part of life, for instance, um.

946
00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:54.709
You know, lawyers worry about floodgates problems. If we

947
00:50:54.709 --> 00:50:57.949
recognize a claim for Ricardo, will there be thousands

948
00:50:57.949 --> 00:51:01.070
of claims that will overwhelm our ability to adjudicate

949
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:04.030
claims? I don't have to worry about that when

950
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:06.709
my kids assert that they have a right. I've

951
00:51:06.709 --> 00:51:09.469
got 2 children, I've got time, right? I can

952
00:51:09.469 --> 00:51:11.879
listen to both of them make an argument, right?

953
00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:14.350
But a court might have to worry about, you

954
00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:16.946
know, Do we have the capacity to adjudicate these

955
00:51:16.946 --> 00:51:21.105
kinds of claims or slippery slope arguments, right? They,

956
00:51:21.266 --> 00:51:24.145
they'll notice that uh if we take this step,

957
00:51:24.305 --> 00:51:26.295
somebody's gonna ask us to take the next step

958
00:51:26.295 --> 00:51:28.545
and do we know where we're gonna stop? Right?

959
00:51:28.645 --> 00:51:30.466
And so I think like a kind of morally

960
00:51:30.466 --> 00:51:35.775
expertise is that you, um, you, you become accustomed

961
00:51:35.775 --> 00:51:40.372
to, comfortable with, cognizant of. Of the recurring moral

962
00:51:40.372 --> 00:51:45.382
issues, um, I, I, the issues, the moral issues

963
00:51:45.382 --> 00:51:47.981
that recur with these kinds of institutions. So I

964
00:51:47.981 --> 00:51:50.771
think that's another kind of moral expertise, but, but,

965
00:51:50.781 --> 00:51:53.541
you know, let it be said, um, there are

966
00:51:53.541 --> 00:51:56.572
features of the practice that I think push lawyers

967
00:51:56.582 --> 00:52:00.461
sometimes towards having badly, bad moral judgment and, uh,

968
00:52:00.491 --> 00:52:01.931
and I want to highlight those as well.

969
00:52:03.199 --> 00:52:07.739
So one last question slash topic then. Why is

970
00:52:07.739 --> 00:52:12.500
it that sometimes people find lawyers repugnant and what

971
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.810
can we do about their repugnance?

972
00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:19.780
Yeah, so, um, I, uh, I had fun writing

973
00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:21.580
this section of the book. It picks up, it

974
00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:24.340
picks up on, um, a theory that was put

975
00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.939
forward by Aaron James, uh, who's a philosopher at

976
00:52:27.939 --> 00:52:31.060
UC Irvine, who wrote a brilliant little book called

977
00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:35.189
Assholes Theory. Um, AND the book is an effort

978
00:52:35.189 --> 00:52:38.110
to figure out, um, just what is an asshole

979
00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:41.590
to take the, take the category seriously, um, as

980
00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:44.750
a moral label, right? What, what, what is this

981
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.280
kind of person? Why do we find them bothersome?

982
00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:49.189
Why do they make us angry? Why are they

983
00:52:49.189 --> 00:52:52.850
hard to deal with? And Aaron has a really

984
00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:56.560
interesting answer, right? He says that an asshole is

985
00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:01.280
someone who claims special privileges out of an entrenched

986
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:05.399
sense of entitlement that makes them immune to criticism.

987
00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:07.780
And one of the things he does in his

988
00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:13.929
book is he observes that bankers often, uh, often,

989
00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:16.739
uh, are assholes, and he, he sort of plays

990
00:53:16.739 --> 00:53:18.939
around what features of the profession of being a

991
00:53:18.939 --> 00:53:23.260
banker, right, might generate this. Uh, AND it occurred

992
00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.500
to me as I was reading this, I was

993
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.540
like, oh, a lot of, a lot of lawyers

994
00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.060
have this problem too. A lot of lawyers are

995
00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:30.219
assholes, and I think they're features of the profession

996
00:53:30.219 --> 00:53:32.350
that pull them in that. Direction. And just to

997
00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:35.429
pick up on his definition, the um the sense

998
00:53:35.429 --> 00:53:38.030
of entitlement, right? And I think part of the

999
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:40.790
sense of entitlement, at least an adversarial legal culture

1000
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:43.820
like America, comes from the idea that you represent

1001
00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.429
your clients and only your client's interests and you're

1002
00:53:46.429 --> 00:53:49.110
supposed to do so zealously. So if I am

1003
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:52.139
being rude or breaking the bounds of polite behavior

1004
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:55.429
or acting like an asshole, I have permission to

1005
00:53:55.429 --> 00:53:59.520
do this. Um, BECAUSE my only responsibility is to

1006
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.820
my client, it's not to the rest of humanity.

1007
00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:03.870
And I think this is actually like a quite

1008
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:06.459
bad construction of what the actual ethical rules are

1009
00:54:06.459 --> 00:54:08.909
for lawyers even here in the United States, but

1010
00:54:08.909 --> 00:54:11.989
it's certainly the cartoon construction that I think licenses.

1011
00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:14.739
A lot of bad behavior. So in that, in

1012
00:54:14.739 --> 00:54:16.580
that, in that last phase of the book, I

1013
00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.500
just try and try and think through if, if,

1014
00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:21.100
if I'm right that law is a moral practice,

1015
00:54:21.179 --> 00:54:24.239
why aren't lawyers more moral? And I think that,

1016
00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.699
uh, and I think that James is offering us

1017
00:54:26.699 --> 00:54:27.419
part of the picture.

1018
00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:31.689
Great. So, the book is again, law is a

1019
00:54:31.689 --> 00:54:34.320
moral practice. I'm leaving a link to it in

1020
00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.979
the description of the interview, and Doctor Hershowitz, so

1021
00:54:37.979 --> 00:54:41.120
just before we go apart from the book, where

1022
00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:44.189
can people find your work on the internet?

1023
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.550
Oh, terrific. So, um, I have a website, just

1024
00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:51.459
scott Hershowitz.com. I've got a Twitter and a blue

1025
00:54:51.459 --> 00:54:55.270
sky account and uh and I also, um, I,

1026
00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:58.389
I, I try to write philosophy for a wide

1027
00:54:58.389 --> 00:55:01.149
audience. So I've got a book behind me, Nasty,

1028
00:55:01.189 --> 00:55:03.510
Brutish and Short Adventures and Philosophy with Kids, which

1029
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:05.679
is a kind of introduction to philosophy through the

1030
00:55:05.679 --> 00:55:08.590
eyes of children, and you'll see occasional essays in

1031
00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:10.500
the New York Times or The Atlantic, any place

1032
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.179
I can get to give me a platform for

1033
00:55:12.179 --> 00:55:12.679
philosophy.

1034
00:55:13.889 --> 00:55:16.239
