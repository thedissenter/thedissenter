00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.809
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.809 --> 00:00:05.500
Dissenter. I'm your host, Ricard Lops, and today I'm

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.100
joined by Rebecca Love. She's an adult film actress

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.819
who has been in the industry since 1995, and

5
00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.260
she's also the co-founder of Adult Film Star Network,

6
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.725
which educates people in The adult industry and today

7
00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:22.764
we're going to talk about uh sex work in

8
00:00:22.764 --> 00:00:27.514
general, pornography more specifically, and I mean several different

9
00:00:27.514 --> 00:00:31.204
topics related to sex work. So Rebecca, welcome to

10
00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:32.865
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:33.284 --> 00:00:36.924
Well, thank you for having me. W, I am

12
00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:40.044
excited to talk about the sex industry, the adult

13
00:00:40.044 --> 00:00:41.424
industry, whatever you wanna call it.

14
00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:45.099
Yeah, I, I mean, I, I usually, I'm, I'm

15
00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:48.139
still trying to figure out what's the most respectful

16
00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.680
way

17
00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:52.529
of both of them, OK, OK, yeah, yeah, it,

18
00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:58.450
it's the adult industry with sex workers. You can't

19
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.849
have it without us. I, I guess.

20
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.430
So, OK, so, uh, let me, before we get

21
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.389
into, um, more broadly on the topic of sex

22
00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:13.309
work, tell us a little bit about yourself. I

23
00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:16.690
mean, you've been in the industry for the past

24
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.069
30 years, right? So, uh, yeah, it's been 30

25
00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.459
years. I

26
00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:22.300
know who's counting.

27
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.680
So, uh, how did you get into it? I

28
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.480
mean, what got you interested in pornography?

29
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.599
Well, I mean, I, I went to college for

30
00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:40.870
acting. I really enjoyed that, um, but, you know,

31
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.800
cost money to go to college and I worked

32
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.300
a lot of hours at a sports bar bar

33
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.529
and a stripper came in one night, talked about

34
00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:52.580
how much money she made, and it wasn't that

35
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.599
a lot of time and I go, you know

36
00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:57.800
what? I'm gonna cocktail waitress. I bet they make

37
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.040
great money without taking their clothes off. Well, it

38
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.589
just snowballed from there because Cocktail waitresses make great

39
00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:10.559
money, but strippers make even more. And I jumped

40
00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.240
on the other side and I was like, OK,

41
00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.300
I can do this. Um, I saw a feature

42
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.619
one night, that's where they have a headliner come

43
00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:23.330
in or a porn star. Or uh Pole Olympics,

44
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.429
you know, somebody that has a lot of credits,

45
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.850
and they were featuring, they put on this whole

46
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.919
show and I went, hmm, I wanna do that.

47
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.770
So I went and I researched and I figured

48
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.649
it out. Um, AND I figured out the fastest

49
00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:39.360
ways to make movies. Well, I wanted to be

50
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.089
an actress, maybe not a pornographer, but, you know,

51
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.610
I figured I'm one of those people that set

52
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.339
the bar so low I can trip over it,

53
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.600
but I always succeed. Because it's so low. Um,

54
00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.199
SO I went out to LA. I booked a

55
00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:58.750
couple of appointments with Playboy and Hustler, and they,

56
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.869
they took me, and I also bought a book

57
00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.600
off Amazon, How to Be a Porn Star. This

58
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.240
is when Amazon didn't make money, they just sold

59
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.869
books, and there happened to be a book. And

60
00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.619
it, it guided me in the right direction. I

61
00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.589
got the agent, I did all the things, and

62
00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:18.089
I got to be a feature, a headliner. Um,

63
00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:21.229
I think the best part about the adult industry,

64
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.880
it's honest work. I mean, if there's a skeleton

65
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.520
in your closet, that's gonna be hard, cause you

66
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.669
are out there, you are exposed, um, but technology,

67
00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:36.419
because I loved the internet and figuring things out,

68
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.529
and technology is like my, my hobby. Like AI

69
00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:44.490
is on the thing now and just a little

70
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.160
bit ago I'm watching movie or coaching movies on

71
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.929
teaching me more about the AI stuff because I

72
00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:55.570
shoot movies in the metaverse where the avatars get

73
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.410
naked and we put on storylines and all that.

74
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.149
When I say metaverse, I don't mean Facebook metaverse.

75
00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:05.649
I mean, yeah, an adult metaverse, and I, I

76
00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:07.289
go in there with my girlfriend and we shoot

77
00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:11.610
little clips and stuff for OnlyFans. So, I like

78
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.570
the, when it evolves like that, cause I get

79
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.329
so bored fast that I'm waiting for the next

80
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.928
train to leave the station so I can learn

81
00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:19.290
about it.

82
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.489
OK, so, uh, look, uh, I, I, I'm very

83
00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:28.589
curious about this and uh since you've been in

84
00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:31.709
the industry for so long, uh how do you

85
00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:34.709
look back at how it changed over the years?

86
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.309
Because I guess that in the 90s, there were

87
00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:43.029
still VHS tapes and then there were DVDs and

88
00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.989
then in the 2000s or somewhere around that, perhaps

89
00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:52.105
in some countries earlier. During the late 1990s, uh,

90
00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:56.005
the porn basically went online and now, and now

91
00:04:56.005 --> 00:05:00.875
you have platforms like OnlyFans and others where performers

92
00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:03.945
can create their own content and set their own

93
00:05:04.565 --> 00:05:06.644
prices and so on. So how do you look

94
00:05:06.644 --> 00:05:12.125
at how the pornographic industry has changed over the

95
00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:14.904
past 30 something years?

96
00:05:15.045 --> 00:05:17.519
I love it. I love it. I get to

97
00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:19.829
run my own shit. I get to be my

98
00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:23.720
own pimp. I'm in control of my body and

99
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.559
my wares, and the inventory is pretty good, but

100
00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.959
if something happens to me, I get it. I

101
00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:33.440
really need my AI Rebecca 2.0 because I wanna

102
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.880
retire on the beach with my pina colada while

103
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.260
that bitch is running shit for me. But in

104
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.299
the 90s and the early 2000s, pornography in the

105
00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:48.980
movies and Playboy, um, VCA, Wicked, Vivid, those were

106
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.779
good stepping stones to market your wares and build

107
00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:58.100
up your rate and your value. So I used

108
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.320
the movies as a marketing platform for me. Because

109
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.839
I needed those credits to feature, but the better

110
00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:08.640
the credits and more and people recognized me, the

111
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.160
higher the rate I could go. So more of

112
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.100
a demand. That's, that's why I use them, but

113
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.589
when the internet. Well, the internet was around in

114
00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:20.910
the late 90s and I was using it. It

115
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.190
was 25 frames per minute, but I was using

116
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.760
it. Um, AND I've been webcamming for at least

117
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.839
25 years, uh, early 2000s. I've been webcamming and

118
00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:36.679
that's changed a lot, and I still webcam. So

119
00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:38.799
not only do I do the fan sites, the

120
00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:42.839
webcamming, phone, cause phone doesn't go away. I know

121
00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.230
people are like, really, people still do phone sex?

122
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.000
Yes, cause they're in, they're intimidated by video, but

123
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.720
talking to somebody on the phone, less intimidation, and

124
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.239
you can go anywhere with your imagination, you're not

125
00:06:56.239 --> 00:07:00.980
stuck to just this, a video call. So, I

126
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.540
enjoy it. I just love to know what's leaving

127
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.019
the, you know, station next, so I can jump

128
00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:07.700
on board, and I've jumped on a lot of

129
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.489
wrong trains, but The internet's great for me.

130
00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:17.790
Uh, SO you didn't shoot with porn companies for

131
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.149
too long, or did you?

132
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.100
Um, I shot with porn companies 5 years, about

133
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:31.709
5 years, and then, I'm, I, I. I, I

134
00:07:31.709 --> 00:07:35.649
got into a relationship, there was a compromise, and

135
00:07:35.829 --> 00:07:39.390
didn't wanna share that part, you know, we had

136
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.630
a compromise and I was like, OK, I'll just

137
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.429
do the Skinemax films on HBO and Showtime because

138
00:07:45.429 --> 00:07:49.040
there's no penetration. And that's what I did. I

139
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.130
did the compromise.

140
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.179
Yeah, but I mean, before we, you got into

141
00:07:55.559 --> 00:08:01.880
pornography, were you interested in sex or was it

142
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.200
more for the money? I mean, what were your

143
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.839
motivations back then?

144
00:08:07.739 --> 00:08:09.920
Well, I mean, I love sex cause I was

145
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.450
giving it away for free in college. I guess

146
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:16.250
that was my intern. Uh, I just thought sex

147
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.690
was the easy part. It's the dialogue, it's the

148
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.209
homework, it's the acting. Well, I love acting, so

149
00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:27.109
that's the fun part. Improvisation, um, sex was just

150
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.890
Part of the deal, I mean, Who doesn't love

151
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.308
sex? And I gotta tell you, on-camera sex is

152
00:08:36.308 --> 00:08:40.150
way different than in your bedroom sex. On camera,

153
00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:43.429
it might not feel as good cause you're opening

154
00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.969
up to the camera, you gotta play to that.

155
00:08:46.349 --> 00:08:49.190
I'm But I still loved it, it was just

156
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.950
part of my job, and I'm like, I can

157
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.989
do that easily. It's, I always tell people, I

158
00:08:54.989 --> 00:08:58.630
did porn for the acting, I know, right? It's

159
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.549
really stupid, but I just wanted to be an

160
00:09:01.549 --> 00:09:04.510
actress so bad and to be a mainstream actress.

161
00:09:05.359 --> 00:09:07.950
You had to go through a lot of auditions,

162
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.080
a lot of rejection, um, you had to do

163
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.419
it for free, you had to do all these

164
00:09:14.419 --> 00:09:17.280
other things before you even got paid or was

165
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.869
on the map. I didn't have that choice. I

166
00:09:19.869 --> 00:09:23.159
had nobody to fall back on. I was paying

167
00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:27.000
for myself, let alone college and all that. So

168
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.419
I just did porn. It was a fast track.

169
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.460
Yeah, and I still got to do what I

170
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:33.979
loved.

171
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.700
No, yeah, I asked you that question just because

172
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.380
there are some people out there, I mean, many

173
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.080
of them conservatives, but there are also. I guess

174
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.679
that probably we should also call them conservatives, but

175
00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:51.419
there are also sex negative feminists who assume that

176
00:09:51.989 --> 00:09:56.239
no one gets into sex work because they like

177
00:09:56.239 --> 00:09:59.799
it. It's just because they are in some way

178
00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:03.659
coerced into it. I mean, is that really true?

179
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.989
I don't know because I don't live in that

180
00:10:05.989 --> 00:10:08.960
world. If they think those negative thoughts, I don't

181
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.799
surround myself. I live in my own bubble. I

182
00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:14.729
have thick skin. I get tons of trolls online

183
00:10:14.729 --> 00:10:17.049
and stuff. It doesn't really hurt me. I've got

184
00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:19.510
that armor and it's built up over the years.

185
00:10:20.169 --> 00:10:22.690
I think I was worried in the beginning of

186
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.669
people finding out and all that, and they will.

187
00:10:24.849 --> 00:10:27.890
You do adult work, they're finding out. Stop thinking

188
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.369
you can hide from it because you can't. You

189
00:10:30.369 --> 00:10:34.020
need your ID, you need your, um, documentations. It

190
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.539
is out there. Even if you're being legit and

191
00:10:37.539 --> 00:10:40.099
you're blocking geos and stuff, they're gonna find out.

192
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.900
So I want people to know if you're gonna

193
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.460
do pornography, you better have thick skin. People are

194
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.309
gonna find out, yes, you're family too, um, and

195
00:10:51.119 --> 00:10:53.039
I wouldn't do it for the money cause there's

196
00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:56.159
so much. I mean, back in the day, oh

197
00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:58.690
my God, the money was crazy. In fact, 2020

198
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.150
was crazy too. What am I talking about? But

199
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.429
there's other jobs that you can do without selling

200
00:11:04.429 --> 00:11:06.909
your soul to the devil. And when I say

201
00:11:06.909 --> 00:11:11.969
that, I mean, you really gotta fight for You

202
00:11:11.969 --> 00:11:15.030
really gotta preach how much you love this job,

203
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.239
because people will bring you down with the negativity

204
00:11:18.239 --> 00:11:22.690
and think that you were um sexually, what's the

205
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:27.869
word I'm looking for? I've assaulted or, or,

206
00:11:28.159 --> 00:11:30.880
oh, yeah, I, I, I think you're referring to

207
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.179
those common assumptions that people make about, uh, porn

208
00:11:35.179 --> 00:11:39.169
actresses and sex workers more generally where they say

209
00:11:39.169 --> 00:11:42.520
that or they assume that because they got into

210
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.169
that kind of work or job. That they must

211
00:11:46.169 --> 00:11:50.489
have been the victims of sexual abuse or perhaps

212
00:11:50.489 --> 00:11:54.090
they grew up in a fatherless home or they

213
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.489
were neglected in some way. I mean, those are

214
00:11:56.489 --> 00:11:59.729
the kinds of narratives that you're pointing to,

215
00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:02.530
right, right, OK, I might have daddy issues, but

216
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.359
I, you know, I have a really good dad

217
00:12:04.359 --> 00:12:10.090
that I picked out. I'm a, I, I was

218
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.080
never sexually assaulted or any of those things. I

219
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.289
just don't think sex is a bad thing. In

220
00:12:16.289 --> 00:12:17.830
fact, I think I was born in the wrong

221
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.640
era, or maybe I was born in the right

222
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.729
era cause I can charge fully with this positive

223
00:12:22.729 --> 00:12:27.390
note, um. I feel like there's a freedom in

224
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.309
it, and it's my choice if I wanna do

225
00:12:30.309 --> 00:12:32.549
it. It's all about consent and if you have

226
00:12:32.549 --> 00:12:35.510
my consent, it's gonna be a beautiful experience. Not

227
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.940
all are beautiful experiences, it just means I won't

228
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:44.179
work with you again. I I don't have. I

229
00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:46.450
mean, I've heard the horror stories that the casting

230
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.450
couch was, listen, ladies and men, there is no

231
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.109
fucking casting couch, and if they make you audition,

232
00:12:52.369 --> 00:12:54.359
get the fuck out of there, they're not legit,

233
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.650
and you let everybody else know cause we'll have

234
00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.130
your back. With Social media day, you cannot hide

235
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.400
behind that casting couch. Bad behavior is bad behavior.

236
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.349
I find it very professional, and I can run

237
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.400
my own business, my own body. I got it

238
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.820
under control.

239
00:13:14.909 --> 00:13:14.919
Yeah,

240
00:13:14.929 --> 00:13:14.940
and,

241
00:13:16.369 --> 00:13:19.960
yeah, and the thing is, um, because, uh, and

242
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.729
this is a very dangerous assumption for people to

243
00:13:22.729 --> 00:13:25.169
make for several reasons, and we can get into

244
00:13:25.169 --> 00:13:28.590
it, I guess, but, er, when people assume that

245
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:35.304
pornography always entails non-consensual sex. I mean that that's

246
00:13:35.304 --> 00:13:40.104
sexually wrong, right? I mean, por pornography is always

247
00:13:40.104 --> 00:13:44.025
about consensual sex, correct? I mean, if we're talking

248
00:13:44.025 --> 00:13:50.505
about non-consensual sex, it's basically, uh, rape, sex trafficking,

249
00:13:50.864 --> 00:13:51.195
things like

250
00:13:51.195 --> 00:13:53.765
that's probably the dark, it's probably the dark web

251
00:13:54.585 --> 00:13:58.375
because with pornography you have to get tested. It

252
00:13:58.385 --> 00:14:02.549
means you're STD free. You have to, um, you

253
00:14:02.549 --> 00:14:05.229
have to fill out all the paperwork on camera.

254
00:14:05.549 --> 00:14:08.270
You have to, um, tell them if you're under

255
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.590
the influence of anything. You're not gonna shoot that

256
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:16.469
day if you are. Uh, IT'S so business-oriented. I

257
00:14:16.469 --> 00:14:19.809
don't know how, when I got into the business,

258
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.229
we were testing, we were filling out all the

259
00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:24.630
paperwork. I think there's even more paperwork now, save

260
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:29.679
a tree. Uh, AND you can ask people, like

261
00:14:29.679 --> 00:14:31.000
you can go on social media and say, is

262
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.989
this a legit company? Are they OK? You can

263
00:14:33.989 --> 00:14:38.200
ask for references. You know, I, it's, I think

264
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.280
it's safe, as long as you do your research.

265
00:14:42.369 --> 00:14:45.650
Mhm. And what do you, what would you say

266
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.969
are perhaps the pros and cons of sex work

267
00:14:49.969 --> 00:14:53.530
that, for example, you would tell, uh, I don't

268
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.729
know, an 18 year old, a nineteen-year-old girl if

269
00:14:56.729 --> 00:15:00.130
she told you that she was thinking about getting

270
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:00.820
into

271
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.520
it? No. She's a teen. It's all in the

272
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.510
name 1819. I think you should be a little

273
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.239
bit older, only and look, I got in at

274
00:15:11.239 --> 00:15:16.320
19, OK, so I just When you're gonna do

275
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.719
this job. It's forever on your, on your record,

276
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.500
on your resume. You have to go against society,

277
00:15:25.619 --> 00:15:27.809
cause society is gonna put you in a category,

278
00:15:27.859 --> 00:15:30.049
we talked about it earlier, and if you don't

279
00:15:30.049 --> 00:15:33.960
have that thick skin, oh, your mental health. I

280
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.869
mean, it's, it's not worth it. What I would

281
00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:39.500
say is, do your research. You can do your

282
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.989
research at 1819, 2021, do your research. In the

283
00:15:44.989 --> 00:15:49.770
meantime, Go learn a skill, go learn a trade,

284
00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.590
go to college, get, get some um life under

285
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.950
your belt, go hiking in Europe, I don't give

286
00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:59.359
a shit. If you wanna come back to that

287
00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:02.520
sex work after a few years of doing your

288
00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.190
research, by all means, because you made a uh

289
00:16:07.369 --> 00:16:10.760
educated decision, cause if you just get into it

290
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.219
for the money, cause you're, let's just say desperate

291
00:16:13.219 --> 00:16:14.799
for money and you want it, and it's gonna

292
00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:18.179
rain, you know. You want to turn that umbrella

293
00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:22.250
upside down and catch all the monies? Well, Don't

294
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.770
do it because of that. Don't do it because

295
00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.859
you're in a pickle, because you might regret what

296
00:16:27.859 --> 00:16:31.770
you've done, and it will affect your life. Like

297
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:35.830
I can't go be a teacher. I can't do

298
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.869
certain jobs cause they're gonna check my background. I'm

299
00:16:38.869 --> 00:16:44.599
an HR issue. Sexual harassment issue. They're not gonna

300
00:16:44.599 --> 00:16:47.140
hire me So get all your ducks in a

301
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.780
row before you make that, and it's life-changing. It's

302
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.130
life-changing.

303
00:16:53.669 --> 00:16:55.989
And, and I mean, in, when we're talk, when

304
00:16:55.989 --> 00:16:59.590
we're talking about sex work, it's uh, I guess,

305
00:16:59.669 --> 00:17:05.040
a somewhat broad category because we're including uh pornography

306
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.010
and the different kinds of ways you can do

307
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.670
pornography, you can shoot scenes for companies, you can

308
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.390
do OnlyFans, you can do other platforms. It includes

309
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.505
being an escort, it includes being a dancer. OR

310
00:17:16.505 --> 00:17:19.925
a stripper. So, I mean, I guess that uh

311
00:17:20.385 --> 00:17:24.265
depending on the kind of work you're looking for

312
00:17:24.265 --> 00:17:27.824
or you want to do, there are different considerations

313
00:17:27.824 --> 00:17:29.954
that you should make, right?

314
00:17:30.344 --> 00:17:34.584
I think sex works, sex worker, I, I've done

315
00:17:34.584 --> 00:17:38.525
my research. Let's see, I did phone sex, internet,

316
00:17:38.785 --> 00:17:42.005
pornography, worked at a brothel for a little bit,

317
00:17:42.155 --> 00:17:46.520
um. Escorted. Let's see, what else have I done?

318
00:17:47.339 --> 00:17:50.780
Uh, WELL, the internet stuff, I mean, if you

319
00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.260
name it, I pretty, I didn't street walk, I

320
00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.790
can tell you that. I didn't do that, but

321
00:17:56.099 --> 00:17:58.469
I dipped my toe in going, oh, what's this?

322
00:17:58.579 --> 00:18:01.260
Oh, what's this? And I just figured out what

323
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.900
works for me. But like I said, I'm a

324
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.040
free spirit. Like, I don't think of sex in

325
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.939
a negative way. I just embrace it like it's

326
00:18:10.939 --> 00:18:13.119
the 1960s and I'm going to Woodstock.

327
00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.939
By the way, let's talk a little bit more

328
00:18:18.939 --> 00:18:23.579
about that because it's interesting in society. I mean,

329
00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.520
I, I don't want to say all societies, uh,

330
00:18:26.729 --> 00:18:29.500
in all, in all times because that's actually, I

331
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.520
don't think that's actually true, but in, in the,

332
00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:36.060
the kind of societies we live in, people tend

333
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:41.204
to associate many negative things with sex. And then

334
00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:45.324
there's those stakes from more conservative people where they

335
00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:48.525
say that, oh, sex is just, you should only

336
00:18:48.525 --> 00:18:51.964
have sex when you are in a relationship or

337
00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:55.805
when you are married and you uh you you

338
00:18:55.805 --> 00:18:59.165
should reproduce and so on and so forth. I

339
00:18:59.165 --> 00:19:03.035
mean, in your, in your mind, where do you

340
00:19:03.035 --> 00:19:06.685
think that these negative ideas that people attach to

341
00:19:06.685 --> 00:19:07.785
sex come from?

342
00:19:09.369 --> 00:19:11.810
I mean, it's how they're raised, you're gonna have

343
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:18.170
that, um, society, you know, your environment. Uh, YOU

344
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.849
just have to break free from those, and what

345
00:19:20.849 --> 00:19:24.130
do you want? Do you want monogamous? Do you

346
00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:29.130
want polygamy? Do you wanna be promiscuous? Do you

347
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.449
just want to wait for marriage? What works for

348
00:19:32.449 --> 00:19:36.729
you? How are you gonna live with yourself? Do

349
00:19:36.729 --> 00:19:39.890
you want all those adventures and sex, or do

350
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.689
you go, hmm, it's not that big of a

351
00:19:41.689 --> 00:19:45.010
deal. So it just depends on the individual, as

352
00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.439
long as you're not harming anyone. I say go

353
00:19:48.439 --> 00:19:51.459
for what you want. Don't let somebody else tell

354
00:19:51.459 --> 00:19:52.579
you what's right or wrong.

355
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.949
Yeah, uh, and so I mean, what do you

356
00:19:58.949 --> 00:20:06.310
think that sex workers actually need from society and

357
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.310
from politicians, because it's interesting that people many times

358
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.109
they don't even talk, they don't care to talk

359
00:20:13.109 --> 00:20:17.010
with sex workers to ask them their opinion, to

360
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.099
ask them. What they really need and want, how

361
00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:22.300
they want to be treated and if they really

362
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:27.239
want sex work to be legalized or decriminalized or

363
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.939
any other form of um legal approach to it.

364
00:20:31.099 --> 00:20:33.839
So, I mean, what do you think that uh

365
00:20:34.219 --> 00:20:37.020
you as a sex worker and other sex workers

366
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.459
need from the rest of society and politicians?

367
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.680
I really don't think it's gonna change. I think

368
00:20:44.859 --> 00:20:48.030
prostitutes are going to be, or sex workers are

369
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.089
going to be an outcast no matter what you

370
00:20:51.089 --> 00:20:55.739
do. Um, WHAT do they need to do? They

371
00:20:55.739 --> 00:20:58.540
need to make it legit, safe. I mean, in

372
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.660
Nevada, we have brothels that are legal. Do I

373
00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.739
think they should take 50%? Do I think, no,

374
00:21:05.979 --> 00:21:08.410
no, I think the sex workers should make the

375
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.479
majority of the money. And then you get a

376
00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:14.750
little cutback from that if you're the establishment. I

377
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.489
like it where they get tested just like porn

378
00:21:17.489 --> 00:21:20.739
stars and stuff. In fact, if a porn star

379
00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:22.949
goes to a brothel, she's gotta get tested again

380
00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:26.890
because it doesn't. Um, GO over and vice versa,

381
00:21:26.969 --> 00:21:32.369
which I love, um, porn, porn stars and sex

382
00:21:32.369 --> 00:21:34.869
workers that get tested like the brothels and stuff,

383
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.609
uh, they always have a battle back and I

384
00:21:37.609 --> 00:21:41.300
go, you know what? You both are getting tested,

385
00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:45.000
OK? You both are doing safe choices, so I

386
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.750
love that. Let's not go against each other. Let's

387
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:51.800
celebrate and unite. And I think sex workers from

388
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.920
all industries, there should be no level, all industries

389
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.199
from streetwalker all the way down to uh selling

390
00:21:59.199 --> 00:22:01.719
phone sex, maybe even a Victoria's Secret model cause

391
00:22:01.719 --> 00:22:03.800
she's selling sex. Come on now, we don't buy

392
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:10.189
the lingerie, you know, for comfort. So So, I

393
00:22:10.189 --> 00:22:14.449
think there should be a united platform, union, healthcare,

394
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.109
things set up, so we have somewhere to go

395
00:22:18.109 --> 00:22:20.250
instead of being blacklisted and we have to go

396
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:24.030
underground. But do I think that's gonna happen? Is

397
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.829
it gonna change? I'm sorry, I don't think so.

398
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.500
What do you reply or what would you reply

399
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.540
to people who are so conservative and they have

400
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.140
such a negative view of pornography and sex work

401
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.420
that they say that uh if they were to

402
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.540
decide, it would just be banned. I mean, do

403
00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.819
you think that that would solve even the issues

404
00:22:50.819 --> 00:22:52.979
they they supposedly care about?

405
00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.500
No, we'll just relocate, we'll go to a different

406
00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.619
country, we'll do something, you know, if you really

407
00:22:59.619 --> 00:23:04.380
like your job, like I'm invested 30 years, I,

408
00:23:04.459 --> 00:23:06.630
I will go somewhere else, but you know what,

409
00:23:06.739 --> 00:23:09.819
you are not allowed to ban pornography until I

410
00:23:09.819 --> 00:23:14.099
go through your search history, because that would be

411
00:23:14.099 --> 00:23:14.819
a hypocrite.

412
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.599
Yeah, you know, it, it's funny that you say

413
00:23:19.599 --> 00:23:25.380
that because actually, uh, Pornhub every year releases their,

414
00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:29.770
uh, data, uh, for their statistics for that year,

415
00:23:29.939 --> 00:23:33.020
and they've already done that for 2025 and there's

416
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.900
some funny stuff there, but one of the things

417
00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.260
that are really interesting is that, uh, the red

418
00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.839
states in the US are some of the highest

419
00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.219
consumers of pornography, so.

420
00:23:45.839 --> 00:23:48.000
Right. Tell me I can't. Tell me I can't,

421
00:23:48.079 --> 00:23:50.800
and I'll find a way I can. That's how

422
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.160
it works. It's like teenagers, right? Tell me I

423
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.790
can't do it because I will figure it the

424
00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:57.280
fuck out. I know your Playboys back in the

425
00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.880
day. I don't think there's Playboys anymore underneath the

426
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.699
bed. We'll find your VHS tape, you know. So

427
00:24:04.199 --> 00:24:06.239
tell me I can't, and I'll show you I

428
00:24:06.239 --> 00:24:06.560
will.

429
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.430
Yeah. But do you think that uh sex work,

430
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.709
I guess that you've already at least partially answered

431
00:24:14.709 --> 00:24:17.790
this question, but do you think that sex work

432
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:22.390
is for anyone in terms of the traits that

433
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:26.630
the sex worker should have to really like what

434
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.099
they're doing and to be successful. Stressful doing it

435
00:24:30.099 --> 00:24:34.969
and to not suffer, I mean, very dire psychological

436
00:24:34.969 --> 00:24:37.060
consequences from it. I mean, what, what do you

437
00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.459
think are the traits that sex workers should have

438
00:24:40.459 --> 00:24:45.780
to have a healthy, uh, take or to deal

439
00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.859
with, uh, pornography or other kinds of sex work

440
00:24:48.859 --> 00:24:50.060
in a healthy way?

441
00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.709
Well, I think you should like sex. If you

442
00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:55.069
don't like it, I don't think you should do

443
00:24:55.069 --> 00:24:59.189
it because you're just gonna hate your job. I'm,

444
00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:02.030
I think that you should stay creative and not

445
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:05.109
just do what you think is like the bestseller.

446
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.189
Do something that you enjoy and put your little

447
00:25:08.189 --> 00:25:14.680
twist on it. Um, DON'T shoot constantly, take breaks,

448
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:20.390
do vacations. I'm, don't film 30 minutes. Nobody has

449
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.729
that attention span. Chop that sucker up into like

450
00:25:23.729 --> 00:25:25.849
3 minutes here and there because come on now,

451
00:25:25.969 --> 00:25:28.010
we don't even watch TikTok videos that are 10

452
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.329
minutes, all right? I want you to focus on

453
00:25:31.329 --> 00:25:34.089
things that you really love. If you don't like

454
00:25:34.089 --> 00:25:37.290
shooting customs, put a surplus on it and charge

455
00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.569
even more, so when you do get the custom,

456
00:25:39.849 --> 00:25:41.849
you're like, fuck yeah, I put a fire under

457
00:25:41.849 --> 00:25:44.290
my ass, and you put your twist on it,

458
00:25:44.369 --> 00:25:48.719
so you love it. Um, IF you need therapy

459
00:25:48.719 --> 00:25:51.390
or mental health or need to talk to somebody,

460
00:25:51.729 --> 00:25:56.189
either find a peer. And, and bond with your

461
00:25:56.189 --> 00:25:59.869
friends, like build your community. Here in Nevada here

462
00:25:59.869 --> 00:26:03.369
in Las Vegas, I have a very beautiful community

463
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.239
that we get together for Thanksgiving and holidays and

464
00:26:06.239 --> 00:26:08.709
barbecues, and they're the adult industry. In fact, I

465
00:26:08.709 --> 00:26:11.530
tell people, I go, this is where everybody comes

466
00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:14.750
to die. This is like our Sun City here

467
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.910
in Las Vegas. Come on, join us. Um, FIND

468
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.310
that community, it can be online, it could be

469
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:26.849
in present. Therapy, find a sexual therapist or somebody

470
00:26:26.849 --> 00:26:29.890
that's been in the industry, or at least advocates

471
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.810
for us, cause you don't want to go with

472
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.939
a negative Nellie that we talked about earlier. And

473
00:26:34.939 --> 00:26:38.420
have them downing um everything that you do. Somebody

474
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.579
that's sex positive, there's pineapple support out there if

475
00:26:42.579 --> 00:26:45.979
you need it, which will help, that's online and

476
00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:50.959
at conventions. And you gotta have thick skin, but

477
00:26:50.959 --> 00:26:54.439
who gives a shit what those people say? Do

478
00:26:54.439 --> 00:26:57.040
you feel good about your job? Cause if you

479
00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.599
don't, it's time to change. You don't, you're, you

480
00:27:00.599 --> 00:27:03.079
shouldn't be in this. If you can't find what

481
00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:05.849
you love about it, get the fuck out. It's

482
00:27:05.849 --> 00:27:08.060
just not for you, which is not a bad

483
00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:12.150
thing. You know, I guess that's what I would

484
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.300
say, and find tons of tools out there that'll

485
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.989
help you get through it a lot easier, and

486
00:27:17.989 --> 00:27:20.390
then instead of doing it all on your own,

487
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.550
cause there's plenty of courses out there, podcasts, YouTube

488
00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.310
videos, you name it, I even have one out

489
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.949
there. Besides Adult Film Star Network, I have my

490
00:27:29.949 --> 00:27:33.030
creative beaver that'll keep you nice and creative, and

491
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:38.430
it goes through all my Adult content creations and

492
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.550
business guidance.

493
00:27:40.829 --> 00:27:43.140
Yeah, uh, uh, I will ask you about the

494
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.150
Adult Film Star Network toward the end of our

495
00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.770
conversation, but I mean, it's, uh, one interesting thing

496
00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:51.630
that you said there and reminded me of sort

497
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.670
of another thing is that you said that people

498
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:59.069
should perhaps shoot shorter scenes, and that reminded me

499
00:27:59.069 --> 00:28:02.229
of the fact that uh if you look at

500
00:28:02.229 --> 00:28:06.109
uh porn movies from the 80s, the 90s, I

501
00:28:06.109 --> 00:28:09.030
mean, it would be perhaps a 75, 80 minute.

502
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:14.410
Movie, but the scenes were like 7 minutes, 99

503
00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:17.550
minutes, 10 minutes, 13 minutes. I mean, and not

504
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.339
beyond, beyond that, so I mean, I find it

505
00:28:20.339 --> 00:28:23.530
funny that nowadays, and I guess, I guess since

506
00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:26.209
the 2000s or even a bit earlier than that,

507
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:30.319
it's like sometimes 30 minutes, 40 minutes.

508
00:28:30.849 --> 00:28:33.489
That blows my mind. I've never done a 30

509
00:28:33.489 --> 00:28:36.050
minute scene. I mean, unless you're talking about the

510
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.890
dialogue and all that. I mean, it was like

511
00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:42.609
you do 7 minutes of oral, uh, 7 minutes

512
00:28:42.609 --> 00:28:45.920
of fuck position, 123, and then they're gonna edit

513
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.229
it down to like, I don't know, 15. In

514
00:28:50.229 --> 00:28:51.109
the 90s

515
00:28:52.959 --> 00:28:55.079
Yeah, I, I mean, but, but what do you

516
00:28:55.079 --> 00:28:57.319
think about that? Why do you think, uh, I

517
00:28:57.319 --> 00:29:00.319
mean, I don't know if you know why that,

518
00:29:00.439 --> 00:29:03.160
why that happened, but why do you think that

519
00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.839
over time, apparently sins became longer?

520
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.199
No, I think, well, I think scenes became shorter

521
00:29:13.199 --> 00:29:15.119
now that, well, I don't know about the pornography,

522
00:29:15.199 --> 00:29:17.760
but I know about the fan base sites because

523
00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:21.520
we are constantly getting information in short form. So

524
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.760
I think that's why it's shorter now, especially with

525
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.199
the fan base. But when somebody comes on the

526
00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:29.829
scene and shoots 30 minutes, I think they're just

527
00:29:29.829 --> 00:29:34.239
not educated. Or maybe they're taking that 30 minute

528
00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:36.609
scene and chopping it up into 10 minutes each,

529
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:41.150
which is smart. Because you can sell that 3

530
00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:42.410
times instead of 1.

531
00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:43.880
Yeah.

532
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:49.079
So Shorter, not longer. I know, right? I'm telling

533
00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:51.670
you, shorter, not longer. It's all about the girth,

534
00:29:51.719 --> 00:29:52.260
baby.

535
00:29:54.469 --> 00:29:57.040
Yeah, um, yeah, maybe we can get into that

536
00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.469
later, so I, I, I mean, but I've also

537
00:30:00.469 --> 00:30:04.250
heard from, uh, some, I, I mean this is

538
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:08.250
already My 6th, I, I think it's the 6th

539
00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:12.170
interview on this um humanizing sex workers series I'm

540
00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:15.849
doing. So, uh, I've, I've also asked other people

541
00:30:15.849 --> 00:30:19.640
because there are, uh, OK, I, I've, I've, uh,

542
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.910
I've talked about the feminists and of course, not

543
00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:26.645
all feminists are sex negative. They're all Also sex-positive

544
00:30:26.645 --> 00:30:32.444
feminists, feminists who uh defend uh uh porn actresses

545
00:30:32.444 --> 00:30:35.604
and actors and who defend sex workers in general

546
00:30:35.604 --> 00:30:38.614
and think that sex work is a legit activity.

547
00:30:38.685 --> 00:30:42.204
So, and some of them say that sex work

548
00:30:42.204 --> 00:30:45.165
can even be empowering. I mean, do you agree

549
00:30:45.165 --> 00:30:45.645
with that?

550
00:30:46.729 --> 00:30:49.380
I think so. I'm almost 50 and I still

551
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.729
get a, a charge from it, like a, oh,

552
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:57.089
I'm so pretty and I'm almost 50. I remember

553
00:30:57.089 --> 00:31:02.469
when 50 was old. So, do I get empowered?

554
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.760
Yes, I have my spurts where I'm like, damn,

555
00:31:05.829 --> 00:31:10.040
yeah, here I am, born in 1976, so I'm

556
00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.760
actually 49, but I'll be 50 next year. By

557
00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.599
the time you probably listen to this podcast. Uh,

558
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.560
WELL, eventually, I'm I, I I find it empowering

559
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.329
at moment, especially in the 90s when I was

560
00:31:25.329 --> 00:31:28.979
dancing in my 20s. I wish I knew now

561
00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:32.040
and go back to my 20s. 0 my God,

562
00:31:32.369 --> 00:31:35.910
it would have been raining money all the time.

563
00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.319
Uh, BUT I learned on the way, and you

564
00:31:39.319 --> 00:31:43.160
educate yourself. So, yes, I find it empowering at

565
00:31:43.449 --> 00:31:45.680
at times, and then when the negativity comes in,

566
00:31:45.729 --> 00:31:48.839
you just flick it away like a mosquito, just,

567
00:31:48.869 --> 00:31:49.729
you know, zap it.

568
00:31:51.079 --> 00:31:54.739
But do you think that over these 30 years

569
00:31:54.739 --> 00:31:58.739
that you've been in sex work, uh, have you

570
00:31:58.739 --> 00:32:04.660
noticed any changes in society as to how people

571
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.410
approach sex workers? I mean, in terms of, for

572
00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:11.180
example, the social stigma, do you think that it

573
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.060
has improved at all or

574
00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.819
not? No, no, I think it's just on rinse

575
00:32:16.819 --> 00:32:19.099
and repeat and it has its cycles just like

576
00:32:19.099 --> 00:32:23.510
history. I, uh I think 90s, it was a

577
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:27.469
little bit more aggressive and hard. Um, YOU definitely

578
00:32:27.469 --> 00:32:31.510
would have very judgy people, but do I think

579
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:36.869
it's improved? I don't, I don't, I don't think

580
00:32:36.869 --> 00:32:38.469
it's improved that much. I mean, look at all

581
00:32:38.469 --> 00:32:41.819
the states that are banning pornography that I can't

582
00:32:41.819 --> 00:32:44.510
even broadcast from North Carolina if I was a

583
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:47.109
webcam model because they blocked it even if you

584
00:32:47.109 --> 00:32:50.339
use a VPN. So do I think it's getting

585
00:32:50.339 --> 00:32:53.660
better? Fuck no, I don't. I think it's rinse

586
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.300
and repeat. I chose to play in that playground,

587
00:32:56.569 --> 00:32:59.099
and I have to deal with the consequences. I

588
00:32:59.099 --> 00:33:01.239
just figure out how to get around it.

589
00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.130
Do, do you think that, I, I mean, do

590
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:09.449
you see lots of hypocrisy coming from people? I

591
00:33:09.449 --> 00:33:12.569
mean, do you see that perhaps there are many

592
00:33:12.569 --> 00:33:18.260
people out there who might, for example, send DMs

593
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.930
to sex workers, porn stars, and so on, but

594
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.930
if people ask them on the street and in

595
00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:28.209
their personal life, they say they are against sex

596
00:33:28.209 --> 00:33:28.770
work.

597
00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.660
Yeah, there's a lot of. There, there's so much.

598
00:33:31.739 --> 00:33:34.219
I remember this one time I was on LinkedIn

599
00:33:34.219 --> 00:33:37.579
when, when sex workers actually were on LinkedIn, putting

600
00:33:37.579 --> 00:33:40.459
their resumes, and this guy contacted me with his

601
00:33:40.459 --> 00:33:44.140
penis. I mean, it was just boom, right in

602
00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.109
my face, and I'm like, Oh, I'm sorry, honey,

603
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.349
but do you realize I see where you work

604
00:33:49.349 --> 00:33:52.390
everywhere, like I could really fuck up your life

605
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:55.349
right now. I wouldn't, because I'm not that that

606
00:33:55.349 --> 00:33:58.810
person, but I'm like, what are you doing, baby?

607
00:33:59.469 --> 00:34:02.229
Stop thinking with that head right away. So I,

608
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:06.670
I, I like to educate, especially on webcam, when

609
00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:10.389
somebody approaches me aggressively or whatever, I give them

610
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:14.228
a teachable moment. So, the next time they approach

611
00:34:14.228 --> 00:34:18.560
somebody in the DMs or whatever, they respect that

612
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.159
sex worker because honey, we don't do it for

613
00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:25.199
free. We don't, we charge money. So I love

614
00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:27.989
it when guys are like, oh, I'm gonna hook

615
00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:30.159
up with a porn star at this convention. Do

616
00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:32.649
you realize you better get out your American Express

617
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.978
black card? Because they, they come with paychecks, honey.

618
00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.998
So I was a slut in college. I'm a

619
00:34:41.998 --> 00:34:44.319
whore in my career cause I get paid for

620
00:34:44.319 --> 00:34:50.389
it. Oh, yeah, is there, is there hip, you

621
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:55.129
know, um. Yeah, yeah, because you know their skeletons

622
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:57.570
in their closet, and I said, check their search

623
00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:00.840
history, see what they're doing. They wanna tell me,

624
00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:03.879
no, why they're doing, I'm just gonna go sneak

625
00:35:03.879 --> 00:35:07.889
over here and diddle my Willie, you know, without

626
00:35:07.889 --> 00:35:08.850
her knowing. What,

627
00:35:10.159 --> 00:35:12.600
what do you make of those people who have

628
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.679
sort of a, a patronizing paternalistic attitude towards sex

629
00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:21.520
workers where they might say, and there are people

630
00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.979
that are even part of organizations like that where

631
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:29.370
they say they want to fight the evils of

632
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:32.439
sex worker, they want to fight, for example, sex

633
00:35:32.439 --> 00:35:36.000
trafficking and so on and. They say that to,

634
00:35:36.209 --> 00:35:43.770
to protect sex workers, uh, porn websites and OnlyFans

635
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:49.550
and, uh, your own accounts on social media like

636
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:53.370
X slash Twitter, Instagram, and so on should be

637
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:56.610
taken down and they, uh, they say they do

638
00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:59.449
that with the intent of, of protecting you.

639
00:36:00.129 --> 00:36:04.560
They take the worst scenario, hype it up, make

640
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.370
us look like the bad people, make us go

641
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:12.469
underground where it's unsafe, and we're not protected. When

642
00:36:12.469 --> 00:36:14.870
they can embrace us and make it a better

643
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:18.550
world, shame on them, shame on them for taking

644
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:22.129
the dirties because politics, let me take the dirties

645
00:36:22.129 --> 00:36:25.949
out of your closet, OK? You have more bad

646
00:36:25.949 --> 00:36:28.750
on your side than I do in this, in

647
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:31.810
the adult industry. So if we had to do

648
00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:34.570
the pros and cons, I bet you politics would

649
00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:36.290
be a longer list on the cons.

650
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.790
I mean, I guess that if they're so interested

651
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:47.250
in fighting uh sex trafficking, they should be much

652
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:52.250
more invested invested in uh releasing the Epstein files,

653
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:52.889
for example.

654
00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.010
Oh, that would be nice, wouldn't it? Wouldn't it?

655
00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:00.040
Wouldn't that list be crazy. Love to see it,

656
00:37:00.159 --> 00:37:02.560
it'll never happen, but I would love to see

657
00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.840
it. Stop wasting your time with the stupidity of

658
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.679
cleaning up our, our world, because you know what,

659
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.060
we regulate our world. We came up with the

660
00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:19.169
testing thing. We, we go off each other to

661
00:37:19.169 --> 00:37:23.739
make sure everything's OK. Stop it. Leave our little

662
00:37:23.739 --> 00:37:26.500
world alone. We run better than the government.

663
00:37:28.149 --> 00:37:31.429
No, you, you know, it's, it's funny because some

664
00:37:31.429 --> 00:37:37.350
of those people, uh, assume that, er, and they

665
00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:40.370
usually, they're usually focusing on the women, of course,

666
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:45.209
but uh they assume that no woman out there

667
00:37:45.629 --> 00:37:51.105
can consciously decide freely to be. Become a sex

668
00:37:51.105 --> 00:37:54.186
worker to become a porn star, whatever I mean

669
00:37:54.186 --> 00:37:58.365
that there must be something wrong in their life,

670
00:37:58.585 --> 00:38:01.345
in their lives for them to make that kind

671
00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:05.315
of decision and then they assume that oh if

672
00:38:05.315 --> 00:38:10.065
they uh arrange a way of banning the kind

673
00:38:10.065 --> 00:38:12.946
of work that they do, they will be saved.

674
00:38:13.302 --> 00:38:15.261
Them and I mean they have those sort of

675
00:38:15.261 --> 00:38:19.662
very irritating patronizing attitudes where uh I mean they're

676
00:38:19.662 --> 00:38:24.781
dealing with adult women and they sort of uh

677
00:38:24.781 --> 00:38:27.181
deal with them as if they do not have

678
00:38:27.181 --> 00:38:31.541
any sort of agency and they can make their

679
00:38:31.541 --> 00:38:34.701
own choices in life and so on and so

680
00:38:34.701 --> 00:38:34.981
forth,

681
00:38:35.302 --> 00:38:38.840
right. Right? There's nothing wrong, there's nothing wrong with

682
00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.840
me. I just want a different way of doing

683
00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.020
things. I, I, I did a fun, adventurous way.

684
00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:51.129
I love sex, I love business, I love The

685
00:38:51.129 --> 00:38:55.159
creativity, all the things that I can do, travel,

686
00:38:55.489 --> 00:38:57.969
meeting new people, that, I don't know, there's a

687
00:38:57.969 --> 00:39:01.550
unity there. It's warm and fuzzy, and I choose

688
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:03.969
to live here. I made that choice on my

689
00:39:03.969 --> 00:39:07.070
own. Nobody told me to do it. In fact,

690
00:39:08.229 --> 00:39:10.909
I did it in the 90s. 0 my God,

691
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:15.949
frowned upon. No, no, no. I chose a harder

692
00:39:15.949 --> 00:39:18.270
way when it came to society and I had

693
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:22.600
to live with those choices. But I could, like

694
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.919
I didn't feel dirty. I felt like I was

695
00:39:24.919 --> 00:39:29.419
advocating something that was beautiful. And the reason I,

696
00:39:29.679 --> 00:39:33.879
I still do this is because I enjoy it.

697
00:39:34.159 --> 00:39:36.159
Could you imagine doing something for 30 years you

698
00:39:36.159 --> 00:39:41.280
absolutely hate? Without a 401k plan or retirement. Could

699
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.090
you imagine? No healthcare either. But I figured out

700
00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.159
a way to do all those things cause I

701
00:39:47.159 --> 00:39:51.800
run my own business. I'm I've done it for

702
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.600
30 years because I love it. I like it,

703
00:39:54.899 --> 00:39:56.750
I enjoy it, and I love the people.

704
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.459
Yeah, uh, uh, but, but, but look, for, for

705
00:40:01.459 --> 00:40:05.580
some people apparently just the fact of you openly

706
00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:09.979
saying that you love sex is like mind blowing

707
00:40:09.979 --> 00:40:11.199
for them, uh, because,

708
00:40:11.459 --> 00:40:15.300
OK, let me rephrase this. I like sex, I

709
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:19.520
love acting, OK. I could take a penis in

710
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:24.250
the vagina, no problem. That's easy peasy. So, I

711
00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.649
told you, I did porn for the acting, OK?

712
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:29.889
I know it's stupid. Porn pornography to me was

713
00:40:29.889 --> 00:40:33.689
just um marketing. I was like, I can do

714
00:40:33.689 --> 00:40:36.219
that. That's freaking OK. It's part of the requirements.

715
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:36.969
I got this.

716
00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:38.270
Yeah,

717
00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:38.469
you

718
00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:42.270
know, uh, uh, there are several reasons why I

719
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:45.629
decided to do this or to start this series

720
00:40:45.629 --> 00:40:49.270
on my channel and podcast that I call humanizing

721
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:52.229
sex workers, not, not just for uh people who

722
00:40:52.229 --> 00:40:56.510
have some sort of prejudice against sex workers in

723
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:59.840
general, to, to really, uh, I mean to, to.

724
00:40:59.939 --> 00:41:05.239
Be another voice in uh getting people into direct

725
00:41:05.379 --> 00:41:07.860
uh or I mean in this case indirect, I

726
00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.020
guess, but contact with sex workers for them to

727
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.370
know them better and to really realize that you

728
00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:18.540
are human beings like any of us. So, but,

729
00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:22.550
but the, the other main reason was that I

730
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:26.030
mean, it really pisses me off that people are

731
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:29.870
so patronizing and they make these kinds of assumptions

732
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:35.070
about sex workers without even ever have talked with

733
00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:35.929
any of you.

734
00:41:36.399 --> 00:41:39.709
Right. Why does it piss you off? Are you

735
00:41:39.709 --> 00:41:42.090
a, are you a sex worker in the industry?

736
00:41:42.629 --> 00:41:46.870
No, no, I got a burning fire for it.

737
00:41:47.469 --> 00:41:47.750
I, I

738
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.419
mean, I mean, it's, it's just,

739
00:41:50.399 --> 00:41:52.469
no, I love that you advocate for us, but

740
00:41:52.469 --> 00:41:56.070
I was just wondering, do you know, like, Is

741
00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:58.669
there a family member that does sex work? Is

742
00:41:58.669 --> 00:42:01.489
there, like, I love what you're preaching.

743
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.479
Uh, I mean, I mean, no, I don't have

744
00:42:05.479 --> 00:42:08.360
anyone, at least as far as I'm aware, uh,

745
00:42:08.479 --> 00:42:11.639
doing sex work in my family, but I mean,

746
00:42:11.679 --> 00:42:16.639
it's just that, uh, I've also I've also been

747
00:42:16.639 --> 00:42:20.639
interested in pornography and stuff like that since I

748
00:42:20.639 --> 00:42:26.679
was an adolescent and uh I Uh, and I,

749
00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.979
and I mean it, it, it really irritates me

750
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:36.080
that, that people, uh, don't even listen to interviews,

751
00:42:36.199 --> 00:42:40.909
don't even read books written by sex workers and

752
00:42:40.909 --> 00:42:44.199
stuff like that, and then they just make stupid.

753
00:42:44.439 --> 00:42:48.399
ASSUMPTIONS, assumptions based mostly on prejudice and on their

754
00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:53.520
own moral values that they attach to sex and

755
00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.750
stuff like that. I mean, it, it irritates me,

756
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.260
so.

757
00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.159
No, I can tell you have a passion for

758
00:42:58.159 --> 00:43:02.399
it. That was like, what happened? What happened? But

759
00:43:02.399 --> 00:43:06.590
you, you're advocating. That you don't want your pornography

760
00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:09.110
taken away, just like I love horror movies, and

761
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.590
if somebody said that was too violent and gore,

762
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.459
and we're gonna start banning that in certain states

763
00:43:14.459 --> 00:43:17.189
or countries, I would be doing the same thing.

764
00:43:18.219 --> 00:43:21.270
Uh, uh, NO, look at, at, I'm an atheist,

765
00:43:21.389 --> 00:43:26.110
but I very much like Jesus, and I mean

766
00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:30.570
Jesus was very caring towards sex workers, for example,

767
00:43:30.989 --> 00:43:32.110
and Mary Magdalene.

768
00:43:32.889 --> 00:43:34.770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

769
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:36.629
Hey, Jesus is part of history.

770
00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.560
Yeah. So, I, I mean, but, but what do

771
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.860
you think are perhaps, also because maybe I can

772
00:43:45.159 --> 00:43:48.879
learn something from this, and if there are something

773
00:43:48.879 --> 00:43:52.600
in my interviews that is lacking, maybe you can

774
00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.659
tell me. I mean, what is the best way,

775
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.679
or what do you think are the best ways

776
00:43:56.679 --> 00:44:00.060
of humanizing sex workers?

777
00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.479
I think what you're doing right now, podcasting, getting

778
00:44:04.479 --> 00:44:08.870
the videos out there, using social media. Um, INTERVIEWS

779
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:11.949
are great because you get to behind the scenes

780
00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:14.090
and we get to have a real discussion about

781
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:19.209
it. I mean, that's the best way. I, I

782
00:44:19.209 --> 00:44:23.100
hate talking politics only because I feel like I

783
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:27.070
feel like it's just useless trying to have them

784
00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:31.889
change anything because corporations and lobbyists and stuff run

785
00:44:31.889 --> 00:44:34.270
the country. Well, I'm only talking for the United

786
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:35.699
States. I don't know how it works in other

787
00:44:35.699 --> 00:44:38.669
countries, but I just know there's powerful people to

788
00:44:38.669 --> 00:44:42.350
keep us down. And I feel like my voice

789
00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.659
doesn't get heard that way, but when it comes

790
00:44:44.659 --> 00:44:47.760
to the social media, it's a great outlet.

791
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:52.389
Yeah. So, uh, tell us about uh the adult

792
00:44:52.389 --> 00:44:56.080
Film Star Network. I mean, what is it about?

793
00:44:56.149 --> 00:44:59.949
What kind of work do you do there, and

794
00:44:59.949 --> 00:45:01.830
what are your goals with it?

795
00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:06.850
So, Adult Film Star Network was created in 2014,

796
00:45:06.969 --> 00:45:10.409
a podcast, and we teach people about the adult

797
00:45:10.409 --> 00:45:14.590
industry. So if you're looking up phone sex, webcamming,

798
00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:18.090
um, you name it, you can do your research

799
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:22.520
there and it will just Give you a grasp

800
00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.560
on what you're getting into. We talk about the

801
00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.959
conventions, uh, fetish, cause my girlfriend Jocelyn Stone is

802
00:45:28.959 --> 00:45:32.679
a dominatrix. I'm a vanilla cupcake, like, the things

803
00:45:32.679 --> 00:45:35.120
that she does, I'm just like, ah, I can't

804
00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.100
play in that playground, so I feel pretty normal.

805
00:45:38.959 --> 00:45:42.560
Um, BUT she gives me her perspective, I give

806
00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.840
her my vanilla cupcake perspective, and then we mesh

807
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.159
together and find this beautiful butterfly that just pops

808
00:45:48.159 --> 00:45:52.239
out. But Uh, we've been doing that for so

809
00:45:52.239 --> 00:45:54.360
many years. We used to do it every week,

810
00:45:54.439 --> 00:45:56.040
now we do it once a month, we find

811
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.360
a really good topic. I'm sure we have to

812
00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.510
go back and update some of the topics cause,

813
00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:05.040
you know, technology changes, things happen. Um, SO Adult

814
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:09.040
Film Star Network, that's where you would find information

815
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.340
about the adult industry and how to navigate it.

816
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.320
And then my other podcast, which I started in

817
00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.979
2025, is My Creative Beaver. And that is about

818
00:46:20.979 --> 00:46:24.889
my beaver, but it beavers build things, so I

819
00:46:24.889 --> 00:46:29.419
teach you, um, tips, tricks, hacks, um, I, I

820
00:46:29.419 --> 00:46:31.780
tell you how exactly I do certain things. It

821
00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:35.979
could be fan base, it could be webcamming, phone,

822
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:41.020
um, taxes, and I just tell you in about

823
00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:44.719
20 minutes. And I, I've been releasing that every

824
00:46:44.719 --> 00:46:48.060
week for a few months now. So either one,

825
00:46:48.399 --> 00:46:51.120
I'm giving back to my community and helping you

826
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:55.040
as best I can. I'm not very political, so

827
00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:58.760
mine is more about creativity. Now, Jocelyn Stone, an

828
00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.040
adult film starwork, she's all about the law and

829
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.179
politics and all that, and I just gloss over.

830
00:47:07.629 --> 00:47:10.179
Cause I feel like I can't, I can't do

831
00:47:10.179 --> 00:47:12.229
anything. All I can do is figure out a

832
00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:12.929
way around it.

833
00:47:14.459 --> 00:47:16.969
By the way, you say you're not very political,

834
00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:19.610
but what do you think, I, I, I don't

835
00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:23.010
know if you have uh, an informed opinion on

836
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:26.330
it necessarily, but what do you think about the

837
00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:30.649
new age verification laws that are getting passed in

838
00:47:30.649 --> 00:47:34.290
the US, the UK, and so on? Do you

839
00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:38.850
think that really serves the purpose that people say

840
00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:40.389
they should have?

841
00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:44.550
Right? I mean, I love the concept of age

842
00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:47.600
verification cause I always get nervous if I'm entertaining

843
00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.479
somebody underage. But then I count on like the

844
00:47:51.479 --> 00:47:54.159
other sites to like weed through that and make

845
00:47:54.159 --> 00:47:56.800
sure they're of age. But then at the same

846
00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.000
time, those mom and pop businesses and stuff, I

847
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.219
mean, you got a hard on, you got, you

848
00:48:03.219 --> 00:48:05.199
know, you, you're not thinking about, let me get

849
00:48:05.199 --> 00:48:08.080
my ID out and type in all this information,

850
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.959
especially if you wanna stay anonymous because society doesn't

851
00:48:11.959 --> 00:48:13.879
fucking accept it. As soon as you put your

852
00:48:13.879 --> 00:48:17.800
credit card in or your ID, well, what did

853
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.770
I tell you? It's gonna be there forever, and

854
00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:22.169
it could come back to bite you in the

855
00:48:22.169 --> 00:48:26.340
ass. So, I love the idea of making sure

856
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.620
they're of age, but at the same time, It's

857
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.889
going to diminish our and they're just gonna go

858
00:48:31.889 --> 00:48:35.250
to another country. They're just gonna skip this site

859
00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:37.330
and go, oh, I don't need age verification and

860
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:39.729
just do it there because the internet is around

861
00:48:39.729 --> 00:48:43.790
the world, it's not just in one area, so

862
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:45.050
it's, it's,

863
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.969
and I, and I mean you can visit websites

864
00:48:47.969 --> 00:48:52.209
from all over the world, right? So just, just

865
00:48:52.209 --> 00:48:56.110
say, just saying. Just saying, and I, I mean,

866
00:48:56.149 --> 00:48:59.790
I guess I'm also not very comfortable with the

867
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:03.389
idea of the government er collecting that kind of

868
00:49:03.389 --> 00:49:04.459
data from,

869
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:09.959
right? Yeah. Right? OK. So, I get the age

870
00:49:09.959 --> 00:49:13.760
verification thing on the idea of consent and making

871
00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.439
sure they're of legal age, but at the same

872
00:49:16.439 --> 00:49:19.280
time, I agree with you, they're, they're getting into

873
00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:24.199
our business. Stop it. Stop it. Get your nose

874
00:49:24.199 --> 00:49:26.070
out of there, cause you, you can't even run

875
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:27.679
a government, all right? You can't even run a

876
00:49:27.679 --> 00:49:30.159
country, and now you wanna dip your toes over

877
00:49:30.159 --> 00:49:33.919
here. You ain't solving any problems. You're just making

878
00:49:33.919 --> 00:49:38.719
shit go underground. That's all you're doing. And before

879
00:49:38.719 --> 00:49:41.459
they did this age verification thing and all that.

880
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.850
If I felt uncomfortable or if I thought somebody

881
00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:47.370
was underage or whatever, I would just ask them

882
00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:50.060
flat out, how old are you? What year were

883
00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:53.330
you born? Send your ID. It could be by

884
00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:55.310
email, whatever, it depends on what I was doing.

885
00:49:55.810 --> 00:50:00.550
So I was already doing it myself in certain

886
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.449
situations when I felt, hm, this is a little

887
00:50:02.449 --> 00:50:06.139
off. Let me just double check. So,

888
00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.760
I mean, uh let me ask you uh now

889
00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.600
to get into a sort of another topic. Do

890
00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:17.000
you think that uh pornography and sex work more

891
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.929
generally, but specifically pornography can play a role in

892
00:50:22.479 --> 00:50:25.620
sex education at all, or do you think that

893
00:50:25.879 --> 00:50:30.760
should be left for uh sex education at school

894
00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.879
or some other uh mediums?

895
00:50:34.889 --> 00:50:40.350
Yeah, school's great at teaching. Um. Uh, Especially nowadays,

896
00:50:40.429 --> 00:50:48.260
right? I'm Gosh, should pornography teach sex education? God,

897
00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:51.489
I feel like pornography is glamorized, cause I do

898
00:50:51.489 --> 00:50:55.139
want a pile driver in my bedroom, OK? I,

899
00:50:55.219 --> 00:50:58.179
I feel like, uh, I feel like it should

900
00:50:58.179 --> 00:51:02.419
be left to sex educators, but nowadays you can

901
00:51:02.419 --> 00:51:06.469
do everything online. Should a, should a A child

902
00:51:06.469 --> 00:51:09.250
and a teenager know this, yes, go out there,

903
00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:14.389
find the right course or coach. Forget the schools

904
00:51:14.389 --> 00:51:16.229
because schools are fucked up. I mean, they're not

905
00:51:16.229 --> 00:51:18.590
even teachers don't get paid enough. There's not enough

906
00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:22.590
money and, you know, find a course that everybody's

907
00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:27.229
using. And make sure it's got great reviews, legit

908
00:51:27.229 --> 00:51:30.590
reviews, and have your child watch that because it'd

909
00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:33.300
be awkward as a parent, because think about it.

910
00:51:33.389 --> 00:51:35.179
Oh God, mom and dad are teaching me, yeah.

911
00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:39.510
But you can go secluded into your bedroom and

912
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:41.909
make sure that they watch this video or download

913
00:51:41.909 --> 00:51:44.510
the course and teach them online that way in

914
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:46.709
the privacy of your own home. You can even

915
00:51:46.709 --> 00:51:48.629
regulate it, leave the door open and make sure

916
00:51:48.629 --> 00:51:52.860
they're watching it. Education is your best. Is your,

917
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:57.149
is your best ammunition. It will educate you, it'll

918
00:51:57.149 --> 00:52:00.020
make you stay safe, you'll use the condoms, you'll

919
00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:04.280
get tested, you know. You'll figure it out a

920
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.159
lot easier with the education than hiding it away

921
00:52:08.159 --> 00:52:10.669
from your child, cause they're gonna find out. Look

922
00:52:10.669 --> 00:52:13.199
how we found out. Oh, we know where things

923
00:52:13.199 --> 00:52:13.520
go.

924
00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.840
So I asked you earlier about the empowerment. I

925
00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:25.600
mean, do, do you think that, uh, sex worker

926
00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:30.500
can also contribute to uh people caring more about

927
00:52:30.679 --> 00:52:33.679
the female sexual pleasure in any way?

928
00:52:34.469 --> 00:52:35.159
They don't

929
00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:39.770
Uh, I don't think, I don't think that many

930
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:42.290
people out there care about that.

931
00:52:43.169 --> 00:52:48.909
Yeah, after 40, now I'm I know it's about

932
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:53.169
ejaculation, mostly on pornography, but that's only because who's

933
00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:57.600
buying the porn? Who's our customers? I'm gonna say

934
00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:02.350
90% are men, yeah, fuck that, 99% are men.

935
00:53:02.719 --> 00:53:04.840
That's what you're catering for your market.

936
00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:07.889
Well, but you know, but you know what, maybe

937
00:53:07.889 --> 00:53:11.409
that's more of a cultural issue than people tend

938
00:53:11.409 --> 00:53:15.030
to think about because in the earliest data coming

939
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:21.324
from Pornhub from 2025, 3rd right now. At least

940
00:53:21.324 --> 00:53:23.854
in the US if I remember correctly, I'm not

941
00:53:23.854 --> 00:53:26.804
sure about other countries or if, if, uh, or

942
00:53:26.804 --> 00:53:30.034
if it's the average across countries, but there are

943
00:53:30.294 --> 00:53:37.399
38%, uh, 38% of watchers are women. No, yeah,

944
00:53:37.489 --> 00:53:39.409
we watch gay porn, just to let you guys

945
00:53:39.409 --> 00:53:41.689
know that's what we watch cause that's what I'm

946
00:53:41.689 --> 00:53:45.989
pulling up on my browser. I don't know. There's

947
00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:47.909
one about two men I freaking love.

948
00:53:48.899 --> 00:53:51.360
I, I mean, I mean, is it really? Because

949
00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:56.300
the category that has been the most searched, at

950
00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:00.469
least in the US this year was lesbian, so

951
00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:04.500
lesbian? I, I'm gonna say lesbian scenes are freaking

952
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:07.159
hot. I used to be a lesbian lover back

953
00:54:07.159 --> 00:54:09.659
in the 90s, early 2000s, and then I kind

954
00:54:09.659 --> 00:54:12.459
of evolved into the whole, oh, I like, I

955
00:54:12.459 --> 00:54:15.879
like dick on dick, let's do that. So, and

956
00:54:15.879 --> 00:54:18.800
I, and I love cartoon porn too, and monsters.

957
00:54:18.879 --> 00:54:22.399
Um, I think it just changes in time, you

958
00:54:22.399 --> 00:54:25.429
know, but I feel like I catered to the,

959
00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:28.439
the customer and whoever my customer is, which is

960
00:54:28.439 --> 00:54:31.300
male-based, is what I'm gonna focus on, but there's

961
00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.120
plenty of educational videos cause I have people come

962
00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:37.399
on webcam to teach them how to eat pussy.

963
00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:40.770
And I explained it to them behind a paid

964
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:44.510
wall, how to eat pussy. So, I think there's

965
00:54:44.649 --> 00:54:48.709
women, men looking up how to please their partner,

966
00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:50.969
but I feel like that's been around for ages,

967
00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:52.649
like you could buy a book and it would

968
00:54:52.649 --> 00:54:53.469
teach you too.

969
00:54:54.469 --> 00:54:57.070
But, but it's quite interesting. I mean, I asked

970
00:54:57.070 --> 00:55:00.389
you about if pornography can play a role in

971
00:55:00.389 --> 00:55:05.209
sex education, so I guess that's, uh, also somewhat

972
00:55:05.209 --> 00:55:07.629
of an answer to it, but it's I find

973
00:55:07.629 --> 00:55:12.129
it interesting that people would pay for you to

974
00:55:12.149 --> 00:55:16.334
teach. Them how to perform oral sex on women,

975
00:55:16.794 --> 00:55:21.354
but they are not willing to admit openly that

976
00:55:21.354 --> 00:55:24.875
they're interested in that because there's still that sort

977
00:55:24.875 --> 00:55:28.754
of idea that it's not very manly to do

978
00:55:28.754 --> 00:55:29.094
that.

979
00:55:29.395 --> 00:55:33.094
What to eat pussy? Yeah. Who doesn't eat pussy?

980
00:55:33.554 --> 00:55:36.770
I wouldn't even like. I wouldn't even talk. That

981
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:38.939
should be the first question on a date, right?

982
00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:41.500
You're sipping your coffee, like, OK, so do you

983
00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:46.659
eat pussy? Cause I saw a dick. I mean,

984
00:55:46.959 --> 00:55:49.239
who doesn't eat pussy? And if you're listening to

985
00:55:49.239 --> 00:55:51.520
this and don't eat pussy, shame on you. Now

986
00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.439
go download a course on how to eat pussy.

987
00:55:54.919 --> 00:55:57.840
Uh, DOESN'T do that? I,

988
00:55:58.139 --> 00:56:00.760
I, I mean, I mean, but you're aware of

989
00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:04.520
the fact that, uh, in the US and, and

990
00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:08.030
other countries, of course, but in the US particularly,

991
00:56:08.199 --> 00:56:10.429
I mean, I've watched, uh, no,

992
00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:12.520
you're blowing my mind right now. I do not.

993
00:56:13.959 --> 00:56:16.739
No, but wait a minute. Wait a minute. For,

994
00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:20.070
for, for, for a long time, I'm not sure

995
00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:22.389
about now in the 20 twenties, but for a

996
00:56:22.389 --> 00:56:26.989
long time in the US, oral sex and, uh,

997
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:30.149
I mean, in both directions, not just oral sex

998
00:56:30.149 --> 00:56:34.030
on women, uh, was frowned upon and it was

999
00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:36.729
called sodomy, so

1000
00:56:37.149 --> 00:56:37.270
it

1001
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.850
was,

1002
00:56:38.389 --> 00:56:42.909
yeah. I wasn't born in that era, no, because

1003
00:56:43.239 --> 00:56:44.959
what did I tell you about living in my

1004
00:56:44.959 --> 00:56:49.419
freaking peaceful bubble of glitters and rainbows, OK, no,

1005
00:56:49.479 --> 00:56:51.629
I mean, if it was frowned upon, I wasn't

1006
00:56:51.629 --> 00:56:54.719
part of that generation, so I was part of

1007
00:56:54.719 --> 00:56:58.110
the generation of slut shaming, sure, where if you

1008
00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:00.959
slept with too many guys, you're a slut, but

1009
00:57:00.959 --> 00:57:02.919
if a guy slept with so many girls, he's

1010
00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:03.699
a stud.

1011
00:57:04.239 --> 00:57:06.959
Uh, I guess that, I guess that's still part

1012
00:57:06.959 --> 00:57:08.120
of our culture,

1013
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:11.389
yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't live there. I, I,

1014
00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:14.090
I guess I, I separate myself. This is why

1015
00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:17.889
I probably can do adult, uh, adult pornography and

1016
00:57:17.889 --> 00:57:20.729
all that stuff, because I don't live there. I,

1017
00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:23.169
I can't wrap my brain around it. If you

1018
00:57:23.169 --> 00:57:26.250
believe that in all the ignorance, then you go,

1019
00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:28.810
buddy, I'm just not gonna live there.

1020
00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:32.709
I, I mean, I guess that's the reason why

1021
00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:38.770
I'm probably uh very irritated when talking about these

1022
00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:42.489
things, because I am constantly exposed to this kind

1023
00:57:42.489 --> 00:57:43.850
of BS, so,

1024
00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:45.989
you know. But I think you like the debate.

1025
00:57:47.449 --> 00:57:50.199
I think you enjoy the debate. Like you come

1026
00:57:50.199 --> 00:57:52.409
across that negative person and you want to give

1027
00:57:52.409 --> 00:57:54.310
them all these beautiful facts.

1028
00:57:55.389 --> 00:57:56.350
Uh, YEAH,

1029
00:57:56.909 --> 00:57:59.419
yeah, come on, you know it. I think if

1030
00:57:59.419 --> 00:58:03.330
somebody came to me as a negative person, I

1031
00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:07.510
would listen. And I would take that information in,

1032
00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:11.040
and I would try to politely say in my

1033
00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:16.520
own stories. And make it more relatable, so they

1034
00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:19.919
can have a different perspective. But I, I don't

1035
00:58:19.919 --> 00:58:21.679
know what that question would be or how it

1036
00:58:21.679 --> 00:58:24.600
would come about, but I would try to put

1037
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:30.899
it in more On civilian terms. Civilian term.

1038
00:58:31.919 --> 00:58:34.600
What does that mean? I mean, give us an

1039
00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.189
example of those civilian

1040
00:58:36.189 --> 00:58:38.939
terms. I wouldn't give him the porn star version.

1041
00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.459
I, I would have to have the right question,

1042
00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:51.300
like if they said, let's see, um. Pornography is

1043
00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:53.760
um evil or

1044
00:58:53.979 --> 00:58:54.840
exploitative,

1045
00:58:55.219 --> 00:58:58.780
exploited, thank you, exploited. That's a, that's a good

1046
00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:01.830
one. And, and they went on this whole thing

1047
00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:04.830
to me, I would just tell them, did you

1048
00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:09.560
watch Die Hard? Or, um, let's see, did you

1049
00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:12.080
watch Friday the 13th, or maybe a horror movie,

1050
00:59:12.199 --> 00:59:16.060
something violent or a game? And do you play

1051
00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:19.699
those? Do you watch those? Those are pretty violent.

1052
00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.899
Do you do those in your everyday life? No.

1053
00:59:22.889 --> 00:59:26.729
But, you know, we enjoy that. Why can't we

1054
00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:31.510
enjoy sex? It's a beautiful thing. Especially when it's

1055
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:35.949
consenting adults. It's consenting on those movies and horror

1056
00:59:35.949 --> 00:59:38.629
games or uh video games. Video games are more

1057
00:59:38.629 --> 00:59:43.389
violent. They're a lot more explicit exploitation, those girls

1058
00:59:43.389 --> 00:59:46.709
are boom, beautiful, and those men are very well

1059
00:59:46.709 --> 00:59:55.060
endowed. Um, EXPLOITATION. Not my favorite word, but if

1060
00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:58.300
they think that, then just give them a positive

1061
00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:01.020
spin on it, because a lot of things are

1062
01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:04.669
exploited. Doesn't have to be just sex.

1063
01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.080
Yeah, you know what, it's interesting that some of

1064
01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:13.199
those people, as we've already mentioned before in our

1065
01:00:13.199 --> 01:00:16.780
conversation, some of those people who say they care

1066
01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:20.820
so much about protecting women, protecting sex workers, but

1067
01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.159
then at the same time they are the first

1068
01:00:23.159 --> 01:00:26.500
ones to condemn. THEM and abuse them and call

1069
01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.060
them names and call them slut and whore and

1070
01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:33.939
this and that and, and accusing them of sexualizing

1071
01:00:33.939 --> 01:00:39.959
society and uh promoting tackiness and degeneracy and I

1072
01:00:39.959 --> 01:00:42.439
mean come on really.

1073
01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:46.669
I can't change their minds on how they grew

1074
01:00:46.669 --> 01:00:48.830
up or what they think. All I can do

1075
01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:52.580
is embrace what I'm doing now. I, I, that's

1076
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:58.340
all I, women are beautiful creatures. Let's celebrate. Can

1077
01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:03.750
women be um Clickish and catty and and say

1078
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:07.600
negative things about each other, or men slut shaming

1079
01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.320
us, sure, but you don't have to be part

1080
01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.959
of that, just remove them from your situation or

1081
01:01:13.959 --> 01:01:18.120
your world. You're not gonna change their minds. It

1082
01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:22.080
might take somebody in their family, somebody close to

1083
01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:26.739
them, or even themselves, doing a sex worker job

1084
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.280
to finally get it.

1085
01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:32.449
Yeah, I, I guess so, but I mean, I,

1086
01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:36.030
I think that also one of the reasons why

1087
01:01:36.370 --> 01:01:41.169
sex work bothers so many people so much is

1088
01:01:41.169 --> 01:01:43.610
that at the end of the day, even though

1089
01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:47.449
many of them wouldn't admit it openly or wouldn't

1090
01:01:47.449 --> 01:01:50.090
say that openly, at the end of the day

1091
01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:52.909
what they really want and what really bothers them

1092
01:01:53.129 --> 01:01:56.889
is that they want to have control over over

1093
01:01:56.889 --> 01:01:58.739
women's sexuality. So,

1094
01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:02.780
so you wanna be my pimp? You want control

1095
01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:05.229
over my body? You want to tell me how

1096
01:02:05.229 --> 01:02:06.649
I can sell myself?

1097
01:02:07.739 --> 01:02:10.639
No, because, you know, you should only have sex,

1098
01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:14.250
uh, within marriage, and you should only have sex

1099
01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:17.540
for, you should, you should only have procreative sex.

1100
01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:18.340
You can't

1101
01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.689
just have sex you can for fun. So what

1102
01:02:20.689 --> 01:02:23.060
if you're married and you can't have kids? It

1103
01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:25.050
means you can't have sex.

1104
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:28.239
Yeah, there are some women out there who are

1105
01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.429
infertile, right?

1106
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.500
So, right, so that means you can't have sex.

1107
01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:34.489
Because your body can't reproduce.

1108
01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.929
I don't know. You, you should ask.

1109
01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:41.110
No, I'm just saying, you're saying you get married,

1110
01:02:41.189 --> 01:02:43.659
you have sex to have babies, and what if

1111
01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:46.669
your body can't do that. So now you're not

1112
01:02:46.669 --> 01:02:47.590
allowed to have sex.

1113
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:50.350
I, I guess you're less of a woman in

1114
01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:51.489
their minds, so

1115
01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:55.310
isn't that pretty? Yeah, I don't, I don't think

1116
01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:58.310
about, I don't think about those things. God, if

1117
01:02:58.310 --> 01:03:00.790
I lived in that world, I would hate myself,

1118
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:03.270
my job, I mean, it would have a reversed,

1119
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.469
it would be a reverse effect on my mentality.

1120
01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:12.100
No, no. And what about the people that can't,

1121
01:03:12.419 --> 01:03:18.709
what about the people that are um paraplegic, or

1122
01:03:18.709 --> 01:03:23.790
are socially awkward, or um are in a facility

1123
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:27.110
where they, they can't do certain things outside the

1124
01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:31.350
facility, and I don't mean prison, I mean, Hospitals

1125
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:34.469
and certain things, they have to, they can't have

1126
01:03:34.469 --> 01:03:37.629
sex, they can't have something that most of us

1127
01:03:37.629 --> 01:03:41.530
think or we take for granted. That's not fair.

1128
01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:44.629
Why, why can't they have sex?

1129
01:03:44.909 --> 01:03:47.149
Uh, I mean, I guess that they should only

1130
01:03:47.149 --> 01:03:51.000
have, have access to their own imagination or something.

1131
01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:54.689
That's not fair though. That's not fair. Everybody should

1132
01:03:55.709 --> 01:04:02.179
of legal consent, consensual sex. Should have the ability,

1133
01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:05.760
that's why I believe in professionals. Let the pros

1134
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.010
handle it, they know exactly how to please a

1135
01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:08.629
person.

1136
01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:12.330
I, I mean, even though there are probably at

1137
01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:15.929
least some religious people out there who even, who

1138
01:04:15.929 --> 01:04:19.330
would even condemn the thoughts, because, I mean, if

1139
01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:23.229
you're thinking about sex, they say that you have

1140
01:04:23.229 --> 01:04:27.590
lascivious thoughts or libidinous thoughts, or, you know.

1141
01:04:28.889 --> 01:04:32.770
I don't, I'm not religious. I only see religion

1142
01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:34.770
on TV and all that. I try not to

1143
01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:37.810
immerse myself because organized religion is very corrupt like

1144
01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:41.260
politics, and I don't like living in those worlds.

1145
01:04:41.689 --> 01:04:45.209
So, but I enjoy good history points in the

1146
01:04:45.209 --> 01:04:48.729
debate and all that, especially on TikTok and Instagram,

1147
01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:53.010
uh, but I, I. I'm not a religious person.

1148
01:04:53.129 --> 01:04:55.169
I'm not gonna live there. I might live on

1149
01:04:55.169 --> 01:04:58.479
a commune though, cause I do like everybody uniting

1150
01:04:58.479 --> 01:05:01.729
and helping each other and all that, and um

1151
01:05:01.729 --> 01:05:03.810
I could see myself joining a cult one day,

1152
01:05:03.889 --> 01:05:04.300
but

1153
01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:10.090
But just don't join a Jim Jones or right,

1154
01:05:12.449 --> 01:05:16.209
right, but look, that was a man, that was

1155
01:05:16.209 --> 01:05:18.770
on my, not that there's anything against men, because

1156
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:22.699
women can do it too, but uh, yeah, no,

1157
01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:28.250
I, I just religion becomes very negative when you

1158
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:30.909
get too many people involved, and then it just,

1159
01:05:31.169 --> 01:05:33.530
it's just politics, you just don't have to pay

1160
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:34.110
taxes.

1161
01:05:34.949 --> 01:05:37.389
Uh, I mean, that's why I'm always telling people,

1162
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:40.870
even religious people, that I'm an atheist, but I

1163
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:44.070
follow Jesus, and they should follow Jesus as well,

1164
01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.090
because Jesus did not condemn uh sex work.

1165
01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:53.250
I always say, what would Jesus do? WWJD I

1166
01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:56.050
always, or what would Judge Judy do because one

1167
01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:57.790
of those fall into place.

1168
01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:01.689
Oh, OK, so look, let, let me just ask

1169
01:06:01.689 --> 01:06:05.629
you one last question then. And, and again addressing,

1170
01:06:05.969 --> 01:06:09.530
uh, what we've already talked about when there are

1171
01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:14.909
people out there like people associated with organizations that

1172
01:06:15.169 --> 01:06:19.010
want to take down porn sites and want to

1173
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:24.750
ban pornography. And sex negative feminists that say, oh,

1174
01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:29.449
we should save those poor female sex workers because

1175
01:06:29.449 --> 01:06:33.080
they're all being exploited and objectified and this and

1176
01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:36.520
that. I mean, as a sex worker, what would

1177
01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.479
you tell them? What would you like them to

1178
01:06:39.479 --> 01:06:42.060
know? I mean, do you need any saving or

1179
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:46.729
do I look like I need saving? No, I

1180
01:06:46.729 --> 01:06:50.209
don't need saving. I'm, what would I tell them?

1181
01:06:51.229 --> 01:06:53.629
Unless you walked 1 mile in my shoes, you

1182
01:06:53.629 --> 01:06:57.820
have no idea where I'm coming from. Yeah, so

1183
01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:01.639
I would say educate yourself, listen to us, not

1184
01:07:01.639 --> 01:07:05.040
just the, the negative, because there's plenty of negative

1185
01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.760
out there that people had a bad experience, yeah,

1186
01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.919
or they had a bad experience and they found

1187
01:07:10.919 --> 01:07:14.350
Jesus and, you know. All that, well, listen to

1188
01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:16.620
the ones that have had good ones and turned

1189
01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:18.870
it into a career because I didn't think this

1190
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:21.989
was gonna be a, a, a career, but I

1191
01:07:21.989 --> 01:07:24.139
found the business in it and I was like

1192
01:07:24.139 --> 01:07:27.590
this is great, let me run with this. So

1193
01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:30.709
I need you to look at both aspects. I

1194
01:07:30.709 --> 01:07:33.949
don't need saving, but some people do. So point

1195
01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:35.949
them in the right direction so they can get

1196
01:07:35.949 --> 01:07:37.149
the help that they need.

1197
01:07:38.959 --> 01:07:42.620
Great. So, where can people find you on the

1198
01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.750
internet and tell us about your podcasts a little

1199
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.239
bit more and where and where people can find

1200
01:07:48.239 --> 01:07:49.020
them as well.

1201
01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.979
I'm gonna make it super simple for you guys.

1202
01:07:52.159 --> 01:07:54.199
It's just my name. I've had it for 30

Say my name, say my name. That's it.
