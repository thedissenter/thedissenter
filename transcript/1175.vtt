00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:02.779
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:05.730
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricard Lops, and

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.810
today I'm joined by Doctor Jacob Norberg. He's professor

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.409
of German studies at Duke University, and today we're

5
00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.540
going to talk about his latest book, Schopenhauer's Politics.

6
00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.959
So Doctor Norberg, welcome to the show. It's a

7
00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:19.889
huge pleasure to

8
00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:21.969
everyone. Well, thank you for the invitation.

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.719
So, I mean, as I was telling you off

10
00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:31.389
record, er I quite like Schopenhauer and his philosophy,

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.159
I mean his pessimism, his metaphysics, the will and

12
00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.200
the world as a representation and his aesthetics and

13
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.569
ethics and so on. But I never thought about

14
00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:45.610
him as a political philosopher as a or as

15
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.169
a potential political philosopher. So why would someone like

16
00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:55.250
Schopenhauer with the kind of philosophy that we tend

17
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.169
to associate with him write about politics?

18
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.009
Well, I think a lot of people would agree

19
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.410
with you. Most people claim that Chopponahar has little

20
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.330
to say about politics, as you mentioned, he is

21
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.690
interested in what the world consists of, how we

22
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.010
come to know anything about the world, how we

23
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.730
should behave, and the role of art. So metaphysics,

24
00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:22.769
epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, and he doesn't say much about

25
00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:26.779
politics. That's the traditional standard view. Um, BUT I

26
00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:30.300
do think that his philosophy leads him to, uh,

27
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.599
a conception of politics. And that his conception of

28
00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.160
politics is deeply rooted in his metaphysics. So if

29
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.480
you will allow me to say a few things

30
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.639
about his philosophy, and then I'll explain how it

31
00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.839
hangs together with politics. So as you know, this

32
00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:47.319
most famous book that you already mentioned is The

33
00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.620
World as Will and Representation, and there he discusses

34
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.430
the world as will. We're all willing, striving beings

35
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.639
driven by this force, the will. We're constantly desiring,

36
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.260
constantly striving, never ending. Uh, BECAUSE that's what we're

37
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.050
made of. That's what the world consists of, will.

38
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.910
At the same time, we perceive the world, uh,

39
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.789
the world appears to us as representation. And when

40
00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:17.710
we perceive the world, we kind of impose spatiality

41
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.910
and temporality on the world. We see everything is

42
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.770
broken up in things, separate things located in time

43
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.360
and in space. So we see the world as

44
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.210
consisting of myriads, millions, billions of things, but all

45
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.460
of those things are animated and powered by will,

46
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.410
and that leads him to think that the world

47
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.929
as we see it is a world in which

48
00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:46.690
there are constant clashes between desiring, striving beings, constant

49
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.850
conflict where everything and everyone is trying to tear

50
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.539
everything away from everyone else and There's a lot

51
00:02:53.539 --> 00:03:00.240
of hostility, antagonism, clashing, collision. Basically he says, the

52
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.639
world as will and the world as representation means

53
00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.360
that the world is in a state of constant

54
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.360
war. He talks about the Hobisian, the war of

55
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.600
all against all. So you could say that his

56
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.639
commitment, his metaphysical and his epistemological commitments lead him

57
00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.320
to believe that the world is a world of

58
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.009
constant conflict. And that is maybe not a political

59
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:29.089
philosophy, but it's certainly a political situation. And he

60
00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.369
then discusses how you deal with this situation, and

61
00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:34.889
then he has these famous answers, you need to

62
00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.289
practice resignation, you need to renounce everything. You need

63
00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:41.770
to try to still the desire within you. But

64
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.539
he doesn't think that that response is really adequate

65
00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:49.059
for everyone. Not everyone is capable of practicing renunciation.

66
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.729
And so you need some other solution, a solution

67
00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:56.080
that is maybe not metaphysically deep, but is pragmatically

68
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.649
necessary, and that solution is politics. You need a

69
00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:04.289
state that legislates and enforces laws and keeps the

70
00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.149
war of all against all in a kind of

71
00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:10.449
at bay, and mutes the conflict. So that would

72
00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.610
be my long winded answer. He doesn't seem to

73
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.428
speak about politics. But his metaphysical and his epistemological

74
00:04:17.428 --> 00:04:19.820
ideas lead him to believe that the world is

75
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.739
a world of conflict, and that world of conflict

76
00:04:22.739 --> 00:04:23.579
needs politics.

77
00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:27.910
By the way, in terms of his metaphysics, please

78
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.790
correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that

79
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.429
at least the fundamental aspects of it, he derived

80
00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:38.309
it or even adopted directly the metaphysics of Emmanuel

81
00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:41.549
Kant, right, because I mean, even that distinction that

82
00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:44.529
he makes in the case of Schopenhauer between. The

83
00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.489
world as a representation and the will, I mean

84
00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:51.170
in terms of Kant, you would call it the

85
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.609
phenomenon and the noumenon, right? So at least in

86
00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:59.350
the fundamental aspects he adopts Kant's metaphysics.

87
00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:02.769
Yes, I think you're right. I think Schopenhauer viewed

88
00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:06.230
himself as a Kantian. And that his ideas of

89
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.109
the world as representation are derived from Kant, that

90
00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:14.149
our minds impose temporality, spatiality, and causation on things

91
00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:17.809
out there. Uh, BUT of course he says that

92
00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:20.579
we can know the noumenon. I think that's the

93
00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:23.299
distinction with Kant, that Kant says that there is

94
00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:26.179
such a thing as the thing that's ding anzis,

95
00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:28.220
the thing in itself, and we can't really know

96
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.970
that. But Schopenhauer does make claims about it. He

97
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.059
says it's will, and that's, uh, very controversial. Not

98
00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:38.220
everyone is persuaded that he's able to prove or

99
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.380
show how we can come to know that the

100
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.899
world is will, but basically I think the The

101
00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:45.299
distinctions are Kantian.

102
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:51.040
OK, but uh when people talk about or comment

103
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.679
on Schopenhauer's politics, whenever, I mean if even if

104
00:05:55.679 --> 00:06:01.190
it's not the most common way that people approach

105
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.160
his philosophy, whenever anyone has something to say about

106
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.940
his politics, what are the most common ideas?

107
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.429
Well, I think the most common approach is the

108
00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:14.260
one that um that you mentioned earlier, is that

109
00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:16.829
that he has no philosophy of politics, that he

110
00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:22.429
is uh uninterested or indifferent or maybe underinformed or

111
00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:27.589
ignorant, um. So that was a very common response,

112
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.309
and I think it was kind of consensual. So

113
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:33.119
you have right-wing thinkers like Carl Schmidt saying that,

114
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.179
you know, Schopenhauer has no genuine philosophy of politics,

115
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.350
but you also have left wing thinkers like Georg

116
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.890
Luca saying that Schopenhauer is not a political thinker

117
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.470
or insofar as he thinks about politics, he's regressive.

118
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:52.089
Uh, CONSERVATIVE and unhelpful from a progressive viewpoint. So

119
00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:55.209
that's, I think, the standard view, and it's shared

120
00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:59.769
across the ideological spectrum, but I don't think that's

121
00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:04.450
entirely true. I think that Schopenhauer felt that politics

122
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.410
was inevitable. We do need a politics to kind

123
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.049
of try to contain the war of all against

124
00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:15.769
all, and in fact, politics is indispensable. Because if

125
00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:19.489
we don't have politics understood as the construction of

126
00:07:19.489 --> 00:07:23.010
a state, the legislation, enforcement of laws, and so

127
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.609
on, then we will live in a chaos of

128
00:07:26.609 --> 00:07:29.839
constant war with one another, and that's an unbearable,

129
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.170
intolerable condition. So I think that he does have

130
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.209
a politics. It's just that his understanding of politics

131
00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:42.250
is pretty narrow in scope. Politics is basically the

132
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.290
use of reason to manage human conflict. It can

133
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.200
never do away or eliminate that conflict. It will

134
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.089
always be latent, but you can at least mitigate

135
00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:55.019
it and contain it a bit. So for someone

136
00:07:55.019 --> 00:07:58.040
like Lucas or someone like Schmidt, like an aspiring,

137
00:07:58.119 --> 00:08:01.040
ambitious left wing or right wing thinker, that's never

138
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.839
going to be enough. It's very modest, it's very

139
00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:07.880
pragmatic, it's very narrow, but it's not, not politics.

140
00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:11.679
I just think that he has a very circumscribed,

141
00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:14.920
contained understanding of what politics can do and should

142
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.040
do, and it doesn't quite satisfy people, and that's

143
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.480
why they've often brushed him off. But it's true

144
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.040
also that the way that he structures his books.

145
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:29.440
Metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, ethics doesn't seem to leave room

146
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.739
for conception of politics. So my book is basically

147
00:08:32.739 --> 00:08:35.219
trying to piece together his understanding of politics from

148
00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:36.580
different areas of his work.

149
00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:40.390
And where do you think that this very common

150
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:46.530
image of Schopenhauer as an apolitical philosopher uh stems

151
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.289
from, uh stems from? I mean, do you think

152
00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:53.690
that it is understandable at least that people would

153
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.635
have these. Image of him.

154
00:08:56.315 --> 00:08:59.674
Yes, I think it's understandable, and it's certainly a

155
00:08:59.674 --> 00:09:02.434
view that was established early on by his first

156
00:09:02.434 --> 00:09:04.315
readers and people who knew him. So the first

157
00:09:04.315 --> 00:09:07.794
biographers written by people who had met him and

158
00:09:07.794 --> 00:09:10.234
spoken to him and were in some cases, his

159
00:09:10.234 --> 00:09:13.630
disciples. They said that he was basically uninterested in

160
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.570
politics. He didn't really have that many political opinions,

161
00:09:16.909 --> 00:09:18.869
and some of these people were lawyers and had

162
00:09:18.869 --> 00:09:21.390
studied law, and they could say that he didn't

163
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.820
really know very much about jurisprudence from their perspective.

164
00:09:24.989 --> 00:09:27.940
He didn't speak much about law from their perspective,

165
00:09:28.229 --> 00:09:31.179
so it was established early on. And then those

166
00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:35.270
observations were kind of turned into accusations by later

167
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.429
thinkers, especially on the left, like Kowski and Lukach,

168
00:09:38.549 --> 00:09:41.320
who said that. The fact that he doesn't have

169
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.260
much politics or much of an understanding of politics

170
00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:48.359
is a real problem because he does, Luke Schopenhauer

171
00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:53.359
doesn't understand the vital importance of coordinated collective action,

172
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.000
coordinated collective things like revolution or rebellion or the

173
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.320
transformation of society, and so that there is something

174
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.520
suspect about Schopenhauer's lack of politics, that he's in

175
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.609
fact. As someone who wants to defend the status

176
00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:13.679
quo, not openly, but simply by questioning and corroding

177
00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:18.130
our sense of the possibility and meaning of collective

178
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.309
action. So that's what people have said in the

179
00:10:21.309 --> 00:10:23.820
past, but again, I don't think that's entirely fair.

180
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.099
I think he had a narrow sense of politics,

181
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.989
but a very defined one. It had a very

182
00:10:28.989 --> 00:10:32.289
definitive place in his, in the architecture of his

183
00:10:32.289 --> 00:10:34.950
philosophy. It has to do with the use of

184
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.030
reason to moderate human conflict.

185
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.260
Uh, AND do you think that there can be

186
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:47.219
a direct link between his pessimism and his politics?

187
00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.320
I mean, because that's one of the most popular

188
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.299
images that people have of Schopenhauer, uh, he's, that

189
00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:58.919
he's a pessimist philosopher. Also because of, of course,

190
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.340
what he derives from his own metaphysics about the

191
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.674
will. And so on, right? So, but you can

192
00:11:04.674 --> 00:11:06.224
tell us more about that if you want. So,

193
00:11:06.385 --> 00:11:08.674
but do you think that there's a direct link

194
00:11:08.674 --> 00:11:09.455
there, or

195
00:11:09.715 --> 00:11:11.914
yeah, I think that's usually what people say is

196
00:11:11.914 --> 00:11:16.905
that he's so pessimistic about the possibility of a

197
00:11:17.155 --> 00:11:20.554
of a of a life of satisfaction and happiness

198
00:11:20.554 --> 00:11:26.715
and so on, but he grounds that pessimistic outlook

199
00:11:26.984 --> 00:11:32.119
in a metaphysical claim so that The we're dissatisfied

200
00:11:32.119 --> 00:11:36.520
and we are unhappy and we're uh uh experience

201
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.239
hostility and antagonism and so on, and we do

202
00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:43.359
all those things. And they're not really curable. They

203
00:11:43.359 --> 00:11:46.760
are, we're hardwired to behave this way, and that's

204
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.640
because we consist of will, and will is always

205
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.150
striving. And even if we satisfy any individual isolated

206
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.400
desire, we will always feel a new desire, and

207
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.030
hence we will feel more dissatisfaction and so on.

208
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.080
So the fact that we are desiring beings made

209
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.239
of will means that we will always be striving

210
00:12:07.239 --> 00:12:10.809
and always in a state of perpetual dissatisfaction. So

211
00:12:10.809 --> 00:12:14.570
you could say that because we, because he has

212
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:20.090
this view, politics cannot genuinely, fundamentally transform us or

213
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:27.559
society. That is what I think irritates people, people

214
00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:31.960
who are politically engaged, especially progressives, that pessimism kind

215
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.479
of dooms politics. We can never fundamentally change the

216
00:12:35.479 --> 00:12:38.700
world by political means. We shouldn't maybe even try

217
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.080
and any kind of Makes that a metaphysical, unchangeable

218
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.159
fact about the world. So I understand that, but

219
00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:50.200
I think it's not entirely fair again. He thinks

220
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.000
that you can do something about perpetual conflict. You

221
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.460
can use reason. To coordinate with others and construct

222
00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.219
a state that legislates and monopolize monopolizes violence and

223
00:13:02.219 --> 00:13:05.700
drains society of a lot of antagonism, it doesn't

224
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.380
do away with hostility, but it mutes hostility, and

225
00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.479
you can do away with things like child labor.

226
00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:15.169
You can do away with things like slavery. And

227
00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:18.400
you can certainly do away or not eliminate fully,

228
00:13:18.409 --> 00:13:23.039
but maybe mute warlike conditions. So there's a lot

229
00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:25.049
that you can do with politics. It's just that

230
00:13:25.049 --> 00:13:30.710
you cannot fundamentally solve the Uh, metaphysical problem of

231
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.630
the world. So I say in the book that

232
00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:36.429
his conception of, um, politics is as an activity

233
00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:41.250
of mitigation, not salvation. And that, of course, puts

234
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.090
him at odds with every thinker who has a

235
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:49.869
utopian streak. He's a very anti-dealistic, anti-utopian thinker. Politics

236
00:13:49.869 --> 00:13:52.840
is the constant work of keeping conflict at bay,

237
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.289
and that doesn't feel very inspirational to a lot

238
00:13:55.289 --> 00:13:57.929
of people. But it doesn't mean that politics doesn't

239
00:13:57.929 --> 00:14:00.369
exist or that politics is not important.

240
00:14:01.669 --> 00:14:03.710
I mean, please correct me if I'm wrong or

241
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.010
if you uh have an uh different idea, but

242
00:14:07.349 --> 00:14:10.469
one thing that I got when reading his, his

243
00:14:10.469 --> 00:14:13.739
books when it came to his ethics that he

244
00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:17.469
also derives from the metaphysics, because I mean, if

245
00:14:17.469 --> 00:14:21.190
we are all, if we can't really escape the

246
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.690
will and the will causes suffering because. We're always

247
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.359
striving and striving and striving to fulfill our desires,

248
00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:30.729
and this is also something that he derives very

249
00:14:30.729 --> 00:14:34.609
much from Eastern philosophy and religion, Buddhism and so

250
00:14:34.609 --> 00:14:37.349
on. They have those exact same kinds of ideas.

251
00:14:37.729 --> 00:14:40.049
Um, I mean, it seems to me that he

252
00:14:40.049 --> 00:14:45.710
also, uh, proposes or advocates for compassion a lot

253
00:14:45.849 --> 00:14:48.750
because I mean. We all suffer, we all live

254
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:52.289
in this predicament and so I mean it is

255
00:14:52.669 --> 00:14:55.270
uh in terms of ethics and how we should

256
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.109
deal with other people, at least this is what

257
00:14:58.109 --> 00:15:01.669
I get from my reading of him is that

258
00:15:01.669 --> 00:15:05.590
we should be compassionate and I mean compassion is

259
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:09.010
something that we can also apply politically.

260
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.400
Correct. I think you're entirely right. He was, uh,

261
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.289
he believed that we are all suffering. Uh, THAT

262
00:15:17.289 --> 00:15:20.150
this suffering is inescapable because of the way that

263
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.409
we're constituted, uh, of will, uh, but that we

264
00:15:24.409 --> 00:15:30.530
can in through compassion, understand ourselves as linked, as

265
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.450
fellow sufferers, and ultimately, uh, there was a kind

266
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.049
of metaphysical realization at the, at the end of

267
00:15:38.049 --> 00:15:40.690
compassion, and that is that in fact we are

268
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.559
all the same. We are not even separate beings.

269
00:15:43.849 --> 00:15:47.419
That's just an artifact of our perception. But ultimately

270
00:15:47.419 --> 00:15:51.179
we are just one will and the suffering is

271
00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:55.059
completely shared because we are one, we are partaking

272
00:15:55.059 --> 00:15:58.500
in, in one world that is unitary. So you're

273
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.219
completely right, and I think that was inspiring to

274
00:16:02.219 --> 00:16:05.140
some people who are progressives, this idea that we

275
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:11.659
owe everyone full compassion as fellow sufferers, um. Now,

276
00:16:11.909 --> 00:16:16.270
he doesn't think though that you can. Um, THAT

277
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.799
you can command people to feel compassion. He doesn't

278
00:16:19.799 --> 00:16:23.229
think that the state can, uh, introduce some kind

279
00:16:23.229 --> 00:16:27.349
of mandatory compassion. What the state can do, what

280
00:16:27.349 --> 00:16:33.609
the political institutions can do is just, um. Restrain

281
00:16:33.609 --> 00:16:36.609
people from hurting each other. Whether or not they

282
00:16:36.609 --> 00:16:39.809
are good people, whether or not they're compassionate, that's

283
00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:41.969
not something that the state can change. The state

284
00:16:41.969 --> 00:16:45.479
can simply legislate and enforce law. And so even

285
00:16:45.479 --> 00:16:48.039
though he has this idea of compassion and that

286
00:16:48.039 --> 00:16:51.080
has been an inspiration for people on the left,

287
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.559
he doesn't think that that can be, uh, politicized

288
00:16:55.559 --> 00:17:00.000
necessarily or can become an obligation or task for

289
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
the state. You can't educate state can't educate people

290
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.239
to become more compassionate.

291
00:17:04.979 --> 00:17:08.459
Mhm. But even when it comes to, for example,

292
00:17:08.868 --> 00:17:14.459
using an ethics of compassion, uh, and applied politically,

293
00:17:14.618 --> 00:17:18.380
er, one philosopher that was very much influenced by

294
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.525
Schopenhauer was Philipp Mein Wender, right? And he was

295
00:17:22.525 --> 00:17:25.723
very much a socialist even though he died by

296
00:17:25.723 --> 00:17:29.844
suicide very young after his book got published. He

297
00:17:29.844 --> 00:17:32.724
was very much into socialism and he was also

298
00:17:32.724 --> 00:17:36.604
a pessimist and a Schopenhauian in a, in a

299
00:17:36.604 --> 00:17:36.925
sense,

300
00:17:37.005 --> 00:17:40.189
right? Yeah, I think I, I'm not, I mean,

301
00:17:40.229 --> 00:17:42.140
I do speak a little bit about Mainland. I'm

302
00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.459
not an expert on his philosophy by any means,

303
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.790
but it is true that socialists found something in

304
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.790
Schopenhauer. He's not the only one. There's another man

305
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.670
called Hans Zimm who also felt that Schopenhauer was

306
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.390
in some ways a strange ally of socialists, and

307
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.829
it has to do with this idea that we

308
00:17:57.829 --> 00:18:02.229
owe others universal compassion, that metaphysically we're kind of

309
00:18:02.229 --> 00:18:05.510
all the same thing, and so we should remove

310
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:09.310
all ranks in society. We should be. Metaphysically, we

311
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:11.349
should all be democrats, so to speak, and we

312
00:18:11.349 --> 00:18:15.739
should all understand other people as fellow sufferers. Schopenhauer

313
00:18:15.739 --> 00:18:19.150
was deeply committed to this idea, but he does

314
00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:23.989
have some reservations against socialism. Schopenhauer does. Well, first

315
00:18:23.989 --> 00:18:28.589
of all, he thinks that. Because of the way

316
00:18:28.589 --> 00:18:31.270
that we are structured, because we're always desiring and

317
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:36.030
striving, you can satisfy all people's needs, and yet

318
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.650
they wouldn't necessarily be happy or stop fighting anyway.

319
00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.589
So the idea that you can reach a more

320
00:18:42.589 --> 00:18:45.449
equitable distribution or something is not going to solve

321
00:18:45.449 --> 00:18:47.630
the fundamental problems of the world, and in that

322
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.630
sense, socialism doesn't quite understand what the ultimate problem

323
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.910
is with society. And the second thing is, if

324
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:58.170
you do satisfy everyone, and everyone is somehow satiated

325
00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.780
and happy in that material sense, they will start

326
00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.550
to feel boredom, and boredom is another kind of

327
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:09.859
problem, another type of suffering. So human beings typically

328
00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:12.760
suffer because they desire things, they want things, they

329
00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.560
need things, hunger, sexual frustration, whatever it is. But

330
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.640
when all their needs are satisfied, there's still the

331
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.560
issue of a mental vacuousness, restlessness, boredom, and so

332
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.640
on. So I think Schopenhauer just felt that socialists

333
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.839
had fundamentally the wrong picture of humans, and that's

334
00:19:29.839 --> 00:19:31.479
his reservations against socialists.

335
00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.670
Uh, I mean, I guess that there are other

336
00:19:35.219 --> 00:19:38.459
big thinkers like Dostoyevsky who fought more or less

337
00:19:38.459 --> 00:19:40.560
the same, uh, I mean with that quote of

338
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.819
is that human beings are not piano keys, and

339
00:19:43.819 --> 00:19:47.819
if we just get complete satisfaction, then some people

340
00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:51.079
would ruin it all just because that's the nature

341
00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:51.589
of human,

342
00:19:51.739 --> 00:19:55.109
you're absolutely right, Schopenhauer. He says that the problem

343
00:19:55.109 --> 00:19:57.439
with socialism is that it is a kind of

344
00:19:57.439 --> 00:20:00.189
bestialism, and what he means by that is that

345
00:20:00.189 --> 00:20:04.439
socialism typically reduces human beings to just bundles of

346
00:20:04.439 --> 00:20:07.250
materials cravings, and when you satisfy those, you're fine.

347
00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.040
And he just doesn't think that it works like

348
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.800
that. So he, he doesn't think that a socialist

349
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.880
utopia would actually make people happy. He thinks they're

350
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.959
fundamentally misguided.

351
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.160
OK, so later we're going to come to other

352
00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:25.469
uh political ideologies that Schopenhauer also had something to

353
00:20:25.469 --> 00:20:30.540
say about, but which aspects of his biography would

354
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.010
you consider to be important in other, in order

355
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.819
to understand how he developed his politics?

356
00:20:38.719 --> 00:20:40.739
So I think there are two things that I

357
00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:44.609
would emphasize, and that is one, Schopenhauer is a

358
00:20:44.609 --> 00:20:48.270
strange background as a philosopher in Germany. He came

359
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:52.250
from a very wealthy merchant family, who lived in

360
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.489
the kind of northern shores of Germany in Danzig

361
00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:59.290
and in Hamburg. His father was a very successful

362
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:04.030
businessman. He was quite rich, and um, he, uh,

363
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.239
his father also had this idea that Schopenhauer would

364
00:21:06.239 --> 00:21:09.819
be another worldly man of business. He would learn

365
00:21:09.819 --> 00:21:12.479
languages, he would learn accounting, he would learn trade,

366
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.650
and he would take over the family firm. Um,

367
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.170
AND, uh, but Schwopenhauer, of course, veered away from

368
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.599
this path, and he chose a life of, uh,

369
00:21:21.609 --> 00:21:24.829
the intellect of philosophy. And he lived on his

370
00:21:24.829 --> 00:21:28.270
inheritance his entire life, right? So he was basically

371
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.689
an independently wealthy gentleman for his entire life. I

372
00:21:31.689 --> 00:21:34.849
think those two facts are important, his background in

373
00:21:34.849 --> 00:21:38.560
the kind of wealthy, high bourgeoisie of Germany, and

374
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.369
then the fact that he himself kind of lived

375
00:21:41.369 --> 00:21:44.530
in a state of social and civic isolation for

376
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.589
the rest of his life. Uh, THE bourgeois background

377
00:21:47.589 --> 00:21:50.510
is important because a lot of his political thoughts

378
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:54.229
to me reflect the ethos of the commercial middle

379
00:21:54.229 --> 00:21:59.229
class. He's very committed to industry, frugality, the sanctity

380
00:21:59.229 --> 00:22:02.069
of property, uh, the fact that there is a

381
00:22:02.069 --> 00:22:05.750
state that legislates, enforces those laws, and that the

382
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:09.469
laws protect people's property and the sanctity of their

383
00:22:09.469 --> 00:22:13.099
life. And so he basically Absorbed a lot of

384
00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:16.500
this bourgeois ideas of, of what the state ought

385
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:21.520
to do for society, but he himself never became

386
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.219
a wealthy merchant, he never started a family, he

387
00:22:24.219 --> 00:22:26.979
never joined an association, he never joined a movement,

388
00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.540
he never joined a party. So he always stood

389
00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.660
apart from the civic life of everyone else. He

390
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.939
was never part of a network, and I think

391
00:22:33.939 --> 00:22:37.699
that cut him off from these ideologies that emerged

392
00:22:37.699 --> 00:22:39.900
in here in the period of his life, nationalism,

393
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.569
socialism, conservatism. He was always kind of a marginal

394
00:22:44.569 --> 00:22:46.920
figure, and he knew that. He wrote notes saying,

395
00:22:46.969 --> 00:22:50.160
I have no family, no house, no firm, uh,

396
00:22:50.329 --> 00:22:54.569
no position. And so his conception of politics is,

397
00:22:54.699 --> 00:22:56.670
I think, a reflection of that. It's very thin.

398
00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.260
He has this idea that there should be a

399
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:02.500
monarchy, and the monarch should preserve order and the

400
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.540
sanctity of property, and no one should interfere with

401
00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.339
him and his work and his thinking, and that's

402
00:23:08.339 --> 00:23:11.099
kind of the end of it. So, his bourgeois

403
00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:12.849
background and the fact that he lived as an

404
00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:15.260
isolated figure for the rest of his life, those

405
00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.290
two things, I think, influence or shape his political

406
00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:18.780
outlook.

407
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.579
So I would like to ask you, because at

408
00:23:21.579 --> 00:23:25.619
a certain point in your book you say or

409
00:23:25.619 --> 00:23:30.420
claim that his philosophy was bourgeois, to use a

410
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:34.760
Marxist term here I guess. So could you explain

411
00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.859
that in what ways do you think his philosophy

412
00:23:37.859 --> 00:23:38.780
was bourgeois?

413
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.880
So I think just to return to what I

414
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.560
said earlier, his values, the key values are things

415
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:51.180
like industry, frugality, the careful management of your assets,

416
00:23:51.719 --> 00:23:56.439
fulfilling your promises, fulfilling your contractual obligations to others.

417
00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.339
He truly imbibed this bourgeois ethos from his. OWN

418
00:24:00.339 --> 00:24:02.369
family and his own background. And you can see

419
00:24:02.369 --> 00:24:05.599
that all over his writings. When asked when, when

420
00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:07.959
he wrote about what children ought to be reading

421
00:24:08.219 --> 00:24:10.130
to learn good values, he said, oh, they should

422
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:13.079
read Benjamin Franklin about how to organize your time

423
00:24:13.079 --> 00:24:15.660
and never waste anything. So he was very bourgeois

424
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.819
in his kind of basic outlook. But I think

425
00:24:17.819 --> 00:24:22.589
his conception of politics is also deeply shaped by

426
00:24:22.589 --> 00:24:26.550
the Burgerum, the bourgeoisie in Germany, he understands politics

427
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:31.630
to be the business of self-interested individuals who come

428
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.780
together and coordinate for the protection of each of

429
00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:39.959
their own self-interests. That doesn't sound. So anomalous to

430
00:24:39.959 --> 00:24:44.329
us today, it's just kind of a simplified version

431
00:24:44.329 --> 00:24:47.290
of Thomas Hobbes that we all know. But at

432
00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:51.449
the time, people had much loftier ideas about the

433
00:24:51.449 --> 00:24:54.130
state. They thought the state should reflect the ethnic

434
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.969
unity of the people or the state should reflect

435
00:24:56.969 --> 00:25:00.469
some spiritual ideals, or that the state was basically

436
00:25:00.469 --> 00:25:03.609
a divine institution and the king ruled by the

437
00:25:03.609 --> 00:25:06.069
grace of God and so on. So he stood

438
00:25:06.069 --> 00:25:08.270
apart from all of those things. He thought that

439
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.849
politics and the state was just a gigantic extension

440
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.510
of the individual self-interest, and I think that's, and

441
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.030
that they aggregate, so to speak, and that's, I

442
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.589
think, is, is very much shaped by his background.

443
00:25:21.739 --> 00:25:24.839
And in what ways do you think his ideas

444
00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:28.719
about politics were shaped by the sort of historical

445
00:25:28.719 --> 00:25:30.839
context he lived in, and of course we have

446
00:25:30.839 --> 00:25:34.239
to take into account that he lived for 72

447
00:25:34.239 --> 00:25:39.869
years from 1788 up till 1860. And I, I

448
00:25:39.869 --> 00:25:43.949
mean, many, many political developments across the world happened

449
00:25:44.229 --> 00:25:49.270
during those decades, but, er, particularly I guess in

450
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:54.390
Germany, what was the kind of context, historical, pol

451
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.069
political that he lived in?

452
00:25:57.079 --> 00:26:00.550
And as you say, it's 70 eventful years or

453
00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:04.920
72 eventful years. So he did live through, uh,

454
00:26:05.079 --> 00:26:07.560
basically the French Revolution, although he was very young

455
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.439
at the point of time, and then the Napoleonic

456
00:26:10.439 --> 00:26:13.800
Wars that went on forever, uh, and then the

457
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:18.150
reorganization and consolidation of German lands. And then of

458
00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.750
course, also the emergence of a working class and

459
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:24.510
the uh appearance of mass immiseration, and then the

460
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:28.829
influx of enormous amounts of information from Asia, from

461
00:26:28.829 --> 00:26:31.650
America, a kind of global connectedness in the world.

462
00:26:32.189 --> 00:26:37.729
And progressives reacted to this um. TUMULTUOUS time with

463
00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:41.050
great hopes. I mean, politics kind of seemed malleable,

464
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:44.930
we could maybe radically transform society, we could reach

465
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:48.959
perpetual peace, or we could have justified revolutions that

466
00:26:48.959 --> 00:26:54.369
transformed society and did away with all stratification. Uh,

467
00:26:54.489 --> 00:26:57.130
AND then the conservatives reacted to this time with

468
00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.530
horror and invoked custom and incremental change and tradition

469
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.589
and piety. And in some sense, he stood beyond

470
00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:07.400
both of those groups. He did not think that

471
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.520
there could be a uh. Uh, TRANSFORMATIVE revolution that

472
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.439
would lead anywhere better, but he also didn't really

473
00:27:14.439 --> 00:27:17.000
speak the language of someone like Edmund Burke, you

474
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.160
know, the language of piety and tradition and, and

475
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.479
custom and slow change and so on and so

476
00:27:23.479 --> 00:27:27.560
forth. Um, IN some sense, he just felt like

477
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.359
we need to understand that politics can achieve something

478
00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:35.300
very specific, namely peace and calm, and we should

479
00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:40.310
and we should just, um, Empower a monarch, uh,

480
00:27:40.369 --> 00:27:43.369
with a monopoly of violence, monopoly on power to

481
00:27:43.369 --> 00:27:46.609
keep, to contain all strife, and that's what we

482
00:27:46.609 --> 00:27:49.050
should do. It's a very modest program that it

483
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.290
differed both from socialists and from conservatives.

484
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:57.380
And how would you place Schopenhauer in relation to

485
00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.810
other political thinkers of his age, and of course,

486
00:28:00.819 --> 00:28:05.900
again, 72 years of life, uh, I mean, he

487
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.540
went through, as you said, the French Revolution even

488
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.439
though he was very young, but then, I mean,

489
00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:17.459
uh, he also went through the period where people

490
00:28:17.459 --> 00:28:21.810
like Edmund Burke. And Thomas Paine were publishing his

491
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:26.050
writings that would then influence the way the political

492
00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.609
thinking on the right and the left developed and

493
00:28:28.609 --> 00:28:31.800
then we also have, of course, a major figure,

494
00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.689
Karl Karl Marx, and we also have other political

495
00:28:34.689 --> 00:28:38.069
thinkers like John Stuart Mill and so on. So

496
00:28:38.369 --> 00:28:42.709
where would you place that him in relation to

497
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:45.630
those other political thinkers?

498
00:28:46.609 --> 00:28:49.359
It's a great question. I think that he, uh,

499
00:28:49.579 --> 00:28:52.989
he placed himself sort of out of time or

500
00:28:52.989 --> 00:28:55.969
out of joint. He was in his, his political

501
00:28:55.969 --> 00:29:00.500
references were, um, deliberately anachronistic, you could say. He

502
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.479
really liked to quote and refer to Thomas Hobbes.

503
00:29:03.849 --> 00:29:06.030
When it came to the construction of a state,

504
00:29:06.209 --> 00:29:08.329
and when it came to individual behavior and how

505
00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:11.579
we should interact in society, he liked to quote

506
00:29:11.579 --> 00:29:15.170
Baltazar Gracia, this, uh, Spanish thinker, I'm not sure

507
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.689
I'm pronouncing the name correctly, who wrote on, um,

508
00:29:18.699 --> 00:29:22.689
prudence and how we can use our prudential insights

509
00:29:22.689 --> 00:29:26.489
to navigate in a treacherous, volatile environment. But what

510
00:29:26.489 --> 00:29:29.569
I'm saying is he's basically turning to 17th century

511
00:29:29.569 --> 00:29:34.380
thinking. AND allying in associating himself with them because

512
00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:38.030
he felt like they had a more realistic, tougher

513
00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:41.109
understanding of a grim, bleak world in which we

514
00:29:41.109 --> 00:29:43.229
just have to do whatever we can to preserve

515
00:29:43.229 --> 00:29:46.310
some order and to protect ourselves a bit, and

516
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:50.109
he turned away from all these exuberant visions of

517
00:29:50.109 --> 00:29:54.430
some transformed society, whether it's a Kantian perpetual peace

518
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.349
or a fistian. Uh, CLOSED commercial state or a

519
00:29:58.349 --> 00:30:03.099
Marxist idea of a society of egalitarian collaboration and

520
00:30:03.099 --> 00:30:06.750
no exploitation. He just thought that they were too

521
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:10.709
grand, promised too much, and could not be sensibly

522
00:30:10.709 --> 00:30:14.469
realized, and uh instead turning to these 17th century

523
00:30:14.469 --> 00:30:17.229
thinkers, and this is explicit, he says somewhere that.

524
00:30:17.859 --> 00:30:22.140
Uh, WHENEVER Germans speak about politics, they immediately become

525
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.920
super bombastic and talk about the destiny of mankind

526
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.540
and the future and the redemptive future, and all

527
00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.260
of that stuff just shows that they have their

528
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.020
heads in their clouds and that we should really

529
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:38.050
understand what society is like, how much hostility, antagonism,

530
00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.300
and what we can do to contain that. That's

531
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.290
all we should do when we think politically. So

532
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.849
he was definitely anti-utopian, and that's how he differentiated

533
00:30:46.849 --> 00:30:48.270
himself from the thinkers of his time.

534
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.199
Oh, by the way, and it is also linked

535
00:30:51.199 --> 00:30:55.459
to Marx and Marxism, uh, another person that perhaps

536
00:30:55.459 --> 00:30:58.339
we should mention here is Hegel, right? I mean,

537
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.180
was he also, uh, would you also consider him

538
00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.900
a political philosopher, and I'm also, I also thought

539
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:08.500
of him because, uh, Schopenhauer, uh, to say the

540
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.060
least, was not very fond, uh, fond of Hegel,

541
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:12.569
right?

542
00:31:12.939 --> 00:31:17.302
No, he, he, he, he absolutely loved. Hegel. I'm

543
00:31:17.302 --> 00:31:19.463
not sure how much he read. He read a

544
00:31:19.463 --> 00:31:21.902
few things and was immediately convinced that this was

545
00:31:21.902 --> 00:31:24.743
just gibberish, and then he gave some examples of

546
00:31:24.743 --> 00:31:28.463
how nothing made sense. But he also experienced how

547
00:31:28.463 --> 00:31:32.312
Hegel and especially the Hegelian school were everywhere at

548
00:31:32.312 --> 00:31:36.662
German universities, and that the sheer dominance of Hegelian

549
00:31:36.662 --> 00:31:41.182
thought suffocated and strangled his life chances, so he

550
00:31:41.182 --> 00:31:44.465
could never gain access to. University positions because everyone

551
00:31:44.465 --> 00:31:48.005
around him was Hegelian or defended Hegel, but his

552
00:31:48.895 --> 00:31:52.826
main criticisms against Hegel are in fact political. He

553
00:31:52.826 --> 00:31:56.186
says that Hegel has these ideas about how a

554
00:31:56.186 --> 00:32:02.745
dignified moral life consists in the individual understanding his

555
00:32:02.745 --> 00:32:06.426
role in a greater society and fits himself and

556
00:32:06.426 --> 00:32:11.689
his activities into this greater state. And then finds

557
00:32:11.689 --> 00:32:15.849
happiness and calm and meaning as a member of

558
00:32:15.849 --> 00:32:18.760
the state, as a, as a, as a dutiful

559
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.969
citizen, and the state is kind of the destiny

560
00:32:20.969 --> 00:32:24.089
of mankind. That's what Schopenhauer says about Hegel, and

561
00:32:24.089 --> 00:32:28.729
Schopenhauer just thinks that's horrific. He says, no, moral

562
00:32:28.729 --> 00:32:35.010
action, dignified action consists in compassionate conduct, you understanding

563
00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.369
the suffering of others and maybe sacrificing yourself for

564
00:32:38.369 --> 00:32:41.939
that. That's morality. That's where you find true dignity,

565
00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.099
not in fitting your life into, uh, the vast

566
00:32:46.099 --> 00:32:49.260
architecture of the modern state. And so he thinks

567
00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.819
that Hegel is, uh, horrifically wrong and that he

568
00:32:53.819 --> 00:32:58.219
conflates and confuses ethics and politics, and so he's

569
00:32:58.219 --> 00:32:59.260
very critical of Hegel.

570
00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.609
Mhm. So, uh, I guess that you've already told

571
00:33:03.609 --> 00:33:08.310
us a lot about Schopenhauer's conception of politics, but

572
00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:13.410
what would you say are the functions of politics

573
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:16.949
according to him? I mean, what, what functions should,

574
00:33:16.959 --> 00:33:19.829
should politics serve, I guess.

575
00:33:20.209 --> 00:33:21.969
Yeah, so he says, uh, I mean, I've mentioned

576
00:33:21.969 --> 00:33:25.869
this again, uh, a little before, but Um, he

577
00:33:25.869 --> 00:33:29.189
thinks that we find ourselves as human beings, driven

578
00:33:29.189 --> 00:33:33.199
by will and um receiving the world through, um,

579
00:33:33.469 --> 00:33:36.150
categories that break up the world in, in fragments,

580
00:33:36.219 --> 00:33:40.069
so to speak. We find ourselves in a situation

581
00:33:40.069 --> 00:33:44.380
of constant conflict. The world is war, basically, and

582
00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:48.099
the function of politics is to use reason. The

583
00:33:48.099 --> 00:33:51.260
fact that human beings are capable of reasoning and

584
00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.459
then capturing their reasoning in language and then communicating

585
00:33:54.459 --> 00:33:58.060
with others, we should use reason and language to

586
00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:02.739
try to construct some kind of state that will

587
00:34:02.739 --> 00:34:07.300
serve our long-term interests, basically by draining immediate hostility,

588
00:34:07.339 --> 00:34:11.969
antagonism, and violent clashes from our immediate lives. And

589
00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:15.208
so the function of politics is basically the rational

590
00:34:15.208 --> 00:34:19.379
management of inevitable human strife. That's what the purpose

591
00:34:19.379 --> 00:34:23.449
of politics is, and it's an incredibly important activity,

592
00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:27.750
incredibly important task, but it's also a limited task

593
00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:31.270
in that it doesn't lead you to a realization

594
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.370
about what You know, the metaphysical constitution of the

595
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:38.168
world, it doesn't lead you to genuine human compassion

596
00:34:38.168 --> 00:34:41.129
with others, and it doesn't lead you to a

597
00:34:41.129 --> 00:34:45.770
resignation or renunciation that will free you from being

598
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:49.850
propelled by the will constantly and living this life

599
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:54.000
of constant dissatisfaction. So it's a very important purpose,

600
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:58.209
the rational management of inevitable human strife, but it

601
00:34:58.209 --> 00:35:00.770
can never be the final goal of any individual.

602
00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.000
And so that's also where, as you mentioned earlier,

603
00:35:06.159 --> 00:35:11.229
his Hobbesian view of um human nature and politics

604
00:35:11.229 --> 00:35:13.159
gets into the picture, right? Because I mean, I

605
00:35:13.159 --> 00:35:16.479
don't, I'm not sure if you would say he

606
00:35:16.479 --> 00:35:20.800
agreed with the sort of Leviathan idea of Hobbes

607
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.580
in terms of the, the The role the state

608
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.780
plays in human society, I mean, did he agree

609
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.500
with it? Did he not? And what were his

610
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.040
views about more broadly the role of the state?

611
00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.659
I would say he has a kind of a

612
00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:39.850
dual view of the state. On the one hand,

613
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.850
he thinks the state is, well, first of all,

614
00:35:43.919 --> 00:35:46.919
it's crucial. It needs to be erected so that

615
00:35:46.919 --> 00:35:49.209
people can live in peace with one another. There

616
00:35:49.209 --> 00:35:51.449
needs to be laws, and there need, people need

617
00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:54.169
to be scared of punishment so that they adhere

618
00:35:54.169 --> 00:35:57.209
to those laws. Uh, THE state in this sense

619
00:35:57.209 --> 00:36:01.649
is a major, um, civilizational achievement. He says, we

620
00:36:01.649 --> 00:36:04.959
have, human beings are rational, we have reason. And

621
00:36:04.959 --> 00:36:08.879
one of the finest things that our reason produces

622
00:36:08.879 --> 00:36:12.199
collectively is a state. By when we've erected a

623
00:36:12.199 --> 00:36:15.199
state, we enter the condition of civilization. So it

624
00:36:15.199 --> 00:36:18.879
is incredibly important. It's a major achievement. On the

625
00:36:18.879 --> 00:36:22.860
other hand though, The state only really contains and

626
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:27.449
mutes our mutual violence. It doesn't lead us to

627
00:36:27.449 --> 00:36:31.820
any greater insight philosophically, and it doesn't bring us

628
00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.739
closer to true salvation, which lies in enunciation and

629
00:36:35.739 --> 00:36:39.340
the mortification of all our desires. So it's on

630
00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:43.060
the one hand, completely indispensable and on the other

631
00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.659
hand, completely insufficient.

632
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.979
Mhm. So, I mean, did he have anything to

633
00:36:49.979 --> 00:36:54.139
say about, because these are the philosophies we usually

634
00:36:54.139 --> 00:36:56.659
pit against one another. I mean, on the one

635
00:36:56.659 --> 00:37:00.000
hand, Hobbes and on the other hand, Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

636
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.620
I mean, did he have anything to say about

637
00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:07.899
the er philosophical and political ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau

638
00:37:07.899 --> 00:37:10.100
because I mean nowadays, and I don't want to

639
00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:13.939
be an chronic here of course, nowadays through anthropology

640
00:37:13.939 --> 00:37:18.600
and so on we. Know that those two camps

641
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.239
are simplistic in terms of their view of human

642
00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:25.520
nature, but, uh, did he have anything to say

643
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.139
about Rousseau directly or

644
00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:31.760
very little. He clearly had read him. Uh, HE,

645
00:37:31.959 --> 00:37:35.800
his father had, uh, was a kind of an

646
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:40.560
enlightenment reader of Enlightenment literature, and he also inherited

647
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.010
that. He read Voltaire and Rousseau and so on.

648
00:37:43.379 --> 00:37:46.459
But it's certainly not his favorite thinker. There are

649
00:37:46.459 --> 00:37:50.209
only a few references, and when he talks about

650
00:37:50.209 --> 00:37:52.899
things like popular sovereignty, you know, he will say,

651
00:37:52.949 --> 00:37:57.139
yes, well, of course, um, all power in some

652
00:37:57.139 --> 00:38:00.899
ways is rooted in, uh, the people, but the

653
00:38:00.899 --> 00:38:03.564
people. As a whole must be put under permanent

654
00:38:03.564 --> 00:38:07.284
guardianship. You need a monarch to lead the people

655
00:38:07.284 --> 00:38:10.475
because the people are basically not mature enough to

656
00:38:10.475 --> 00:38:12.965
somehow lead themselves and so on. So I would

657
00:38:12.965 --> 00:38:14.764
say insofar as he speaks about Rousseau, and there

658
00:38:14.764 --> 00:38:18.925
are only a handful of references, it's curtain dismissive.

659
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:23.830
OK, and what were his ideas or did he

660
00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:28.350
have any ideas about religion and religious institutions, because

661
00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:32.110
this is also something that we have to consider

662
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:32.770
politically.

663
00:38:33.389 --> 00:38:38.790
Yes, he definitely did, yeah, he thought that. So,

664
00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.320
um, he thought that the religion responds to a

665
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.919
very, uh, very, uh, a kind of, um, fundamental

666
00:38:46.919 --> 00:38:49.879
human need, which he called the metaphysical need. You

667
00:38:49.879 --> 00:38:53.000
know, human beings find themselves in this world of

668
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.120
pain, this world of frustration, uh, where they suffer

669
00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:03.989
from injuries, illness, uh. A heartbreak, uh, betrayal, you

670
00:39:03.989 --> 00:39:08.439
name it. And they naturally ask themselves, why am

671
00:39:08.439 --> 00:39:10.679
I experiencing this? What is the purpose of all

672
00:39:10.679 --> 00:39:16.439
this? And Schopenhauer felt that there were basically 22

673
00:39:16.439 --> 00:39:20.629
disciplines or two activities that provided an answer. On

674
00:39:20.629 --> 00:39:23.870
the one, and the first, uh, is philosophy, which

675
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:26.580
is, you know, the use of human reason to

676
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.010
examine the world and come to understand the world.

677
00:39:29.229 --> 00:39:31.830
But philosophy is not for everyone. It's for people

678
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:35.189
who are highly intelligent, highly rational, and who have

679
00:39:35.189 --> 00:39:38.389
time on their hands to truly, um, explore the

680
00:39:38.389 --> 00:39:42.070
world in thought. Uh, THE other provider of a

681
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:47.020
kind of set of explanations is religion. Uh, RELIGION

682
00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:51.679
also satisfies this ineradicable meta metaphysical needs of humans.

683
00:39:52.139 --> 00:39:55.260
But it does so in a popular way with

684
00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:59.919
fables, with stories, with images, with symbols, with allegories

685
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:04.100
that speak to the great majority. And so religion

686
00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.659
is a kind of folk metaphysics, he says. They

687
00:40:07.659 --> 00:40:11.149
clearly responds to a human need, a human, um,

688
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.820
mode of questioning, but it does so in a

689
00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:17.219
way that ultimately is inferior to philosophy. That's his

690
00:40:17.219 --> 00:40:18.939
understanding of religion.

691
00:40:19.899 --> 00:40:22.860
OK, so, let me ask you, because if I

692
00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:27.860
remember correctly, when reading about his aesthetics, uh, he

693
00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:31.629
says that the two ways to, um, at least,

694
00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:33.979
uh, I mean, one of them is temporary, the

695
00:40:33.979 --> 00:40:39.100
other one is potentially permanent or ideally permanent of

696
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.699
escaping from the will or, or, or, uh, I

697
00:40:42.699 --> 00:40:46.810
mean the, the sort of more oppressive. Uh, ASPECTS

698
00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:51.689
of the will is through art, through artistic experience,

699
00:40:51.729 --> 00:40:54.949
and then he puts music above all the other

700
00:40:55.209 --> 00:40:59.300
forms of art, and the other one is what

701
00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:03.050
I guess people we could call sages do, the

702
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:07.850
more ascetic people, and those would include some but

703
00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:11.760
not necessarily religious people, right? I mean, so. So

704
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.320
I, I mean what I'm trying to ask you

705
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.320
here or try to understand is that, um, I

706
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:21.320
mean, he, I guess that rationally, intellectually, he would

707
00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:26.439
place religion below philosophy, but he also had lots

708
00:41:26.439 --> 00:41:30.399
of respect for these people who try to break

709
00:41:30.399 --> 00:41:34.530
themselves out of the uh oppression of the will

710
00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:38.300
and try to annihilate, let's say to use. Perhaps,

711
00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:42.669
uh, Buddhist idea annihilate their desires and so on.

712
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.709
Yes, you're completely correct. He has a lot of

713
00:41:45.709 --> 00:41:52.060
respect for, um, extraordinary religious figures, um, people capable,

714
00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:56.489
in, for instance, in Christianity of great sacrifice and

715
00:41:56.489 --> 00:42:00.389
all-encompassing compassion to the point of sacrificing their own

716
00:42:00.389 --> 00:42:05.179
lives, or as you say, sage. WHO live a

717
00:42:05.179 --> 00:42:09.699
life of very rigorous asceticism and kind of tranquilize

718
00:42:09.699 --> 00:42:13.560
the desires within them to enter into a state

719
00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.169
of, you know, calm and serenity and bliss. You

720
00:42:17.169 --> 00:42:20.520
know, these are extraordinary figures that he finds very

721
00:42:20.979 --> 00:42:23.850
inspiring and that he holds up as great ideals.

722
00:42:24.179 --> 00:42:26.699
It's just that I don't think he says that

723
00:42:26.699 --> 00:42:28.739
they can be scaled, so to speak. It's not

724
00:42:28.739 --> 00:42:33.189
that. OK, OK, OK, OK. Of this tremendous self-discipline

725
00:42:33.189 --> 00:42:38.919
and compassion, it's really anthropologically anomalous. It's, uh, ideals

726
00:42:38.919 --> 00:42:40.530
for all of us, but it's not clear that

727
00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:43.330
we can put it into practice, uh, for billions

728
00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:46.800
of people. And, uh, in, for, for those people,

729
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:50.010
there is, on the one hand, religion to kind

730
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.399
of answer questions about why it is that we

731
00:42:52.399 --> 00:42:56.090
find ourselves in this difficult, painful world, uh, with

732
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:59.270
stories and fables and symbols. Uh, TO kind of

733
00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:03.550
satisfy us and accept our inevitable hardships, and on

734
00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:07.469
the other hand, politics, which doesn't solve any problems,

735
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:12.989
doesn't explain anything, but makes us, um, um, mutes

736
00:43:12.989 --> 00:43:16.909
our violent impulses and keeps, uh, keeps hostility at

737
00:43:16.909 --> 00:43:19.824
bay, so to speak, so. Uh, IT'S true that

738
00:43:19.824 --> 00:43:23.995
philosophy and certain forms of religious practice are what

739
00:43:23.995 --> 00:43:26.995
he holds in the highest regard, but they are

740
00:43:26.995 --> 00:43:30.594
really only available for an elite, and for everyone

741
00:43:30.594 --> 00:43:34.995
else, there are religious sermons and there's, uh, political

742
00:43:34.995 --> 00:43:38.034
institutions to kind of make life bearable in different

743
00:43:38.034 --> 00:43:38.415
ways.

744
00:43:39.389 --> 00:43:42.719
OK, so still on the topic of religion, uh,

745
00:43:42.919 --> 00:43:46.000
did you think that it was or was he

746
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.820
in favor of separating church from state?

747
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.560
Yes, he was in favor of separating the state

748
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.479
and the church because they satisfy different needs, uh,

749
00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:00.439
but he constantly saw how they were entangled for

750
00:44:00.439 --> 00:44:03.770
reasons that he also sort of understood. So the

751
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:06.879
state responds to one human need, namely the human

752
00:44:06.879 --> 00:44:11.020
need for safety, security, stability, predictability, and so on.

753
00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:14.760
Uh, AND religion or the church, in the case

754
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.080
of uh Europe, responds to another human need, namely

755
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.080
the need for some kind of consolation in the

756
00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.840
painful world. And they should ideally be separate, but

757
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.520
he noticed that human beings are more prone to

758
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.360
follow political leaders if they thought that those political

759
00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:36.959
leaders also were somehow, um, sanctified by some religious

760
00:44:36.959 --> 00:44:40.280
power, or if those leaders were pious and believed

761
00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:44.379
in, uh, in religion, the religion of their own,

762
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.060
of their religion, and he also believed that, uh,

763
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.689
If the princes or the monarchs would preach a

764
00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:58.209
religious creed, they, they could make people calmer. So

765
00:44:58.489 --> 00:45:02.010
if I feel that I have nothing, and uh

766
00:45:02.129 --> 00:45:04.729
I think that's just a political problem, someone's taking

767
00:45:04.729 --> 00:45:06.489
something away from me, I might be prone to

768
00:45:06.489 --> 00:45:09.290
rebel. But if I constantly hear that this is

769
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.679
just my lot in life and this is what

770
00:45:11.679 --> 00:45:13.570
God believes that I should live, and there will

771
00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:16.989
be another existence beyond death, then I might be

772
00:45:16.989 --> 00:45:20.810
calmer and um accept more orderly behavior and so

773
00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:23.570
on. So he thought that for all these different

774
00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:27.129
reasons, the state or the monarchy would like to

775
00:45:27.129 --> 00:45:30.689
ally itself with the religious institutions. So even though

776
00:45:30.689 --> 00:45:34.330
they're separate, uh, they tend to get entangled, and

777
00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:37.370
he thought that was a problem. Because whenever the

778
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:42.250
state allies itself, associates itself with one religion. It

779
00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:47.610
also kind of takes on the religious attitude towards

780
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:52.239
philosophical free thinkers. It wants to have all the

781
00:45:52.239 --> 00:45:55.729
institutions of the state, the, uh, the Sunday school,

782
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.649
the school system, the university system. They want the

783
00:45:58.649 --> 00:46:01.489
state wants all of those institutions to kind of

784
00:46:01.489 --> 00:46:05.209
preach the local religion, to have a uniform homogeneous

785
00:46:05.209 --> 00:46:09.209
ideological message for everyone, and then they start censoring

786
00:46:09.209 --> 00:46:14.830
and silencing. Philosophical free thinkers such as Schopenhauer. So

787
00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:18.360
he was kind of ambivalent about the relationship between

788
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.520
the state and religion. On the one hand, he

789
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.159
thought this would maybe strengthen the chances for peace

790
00:46:23.159 --> 00:46:25.550
and calm and order in society, and on the

791
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:28.260
other hand, he felt he suffered as a philosopher

792
00:46:28.679 --> 00:46:31.500
because he knew that there was censorship of his

793
00:46:31.919 --> 00:46:35.040
more radical views in a very religious society.

794
00:46:36.479 --> 00:46:40.159
So do you think that if he was still

795
00:46:40.159 --> 00:46:44.360
alive, he would have been opposed to uh what

796
00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:48.280
we see in states like uh Islamic states like

797
00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:53.080
Iran and the Saudi Arabia and the rise, the

798
00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:57.239
very unfortunate in my opinion, rise of what appears

799
00:46:57.239 --> 00:47:01.439
to be Christian nationalism in the US nowadays.

800
00:47:01.879 --> 00:47:04.879
Yes, I think that he would. I think as

801
00:47:04.879 --> 00:47:08.120
a person who was, so he did believe that

802
00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.959
a state that promulgates and preaches a religion might

803
00:47:12.959 --> 00:47:16.709
have a better chance at securing compliance in the

804
00:47:16.709 --> 00:47:19.439
population, so maybe those societies will be a little

805
00:47:19.439 --> 00:47:24.540
calmer, but as a philosopher, he hated that situation,

806
00:47:24.879 --> 00:47:27.879
and he felt it was incredibly undignified for a

807
00:47:27.879 --> 00:47:30.800
philosopher to be chained to any kind of religious

808
00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:35.120
creed. And so he was just fundamentally ambivalent. Politically

809
00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.959
speaking, he wanted the state to use any means

810
00:47:37.959 --> 00:47:43.360
necessary to maintain peace and control conflict, but as

811
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.139
a philosopher, he wanted the state and the church

812
00:47:46.639 --> 00:47:50.110
out of philosophy entirely. So I think he's just

813
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:51.159
ambivalent about this.

814
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.820
OK. So, uh, there's, uh, a quote that I

815
00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:59.939
have here from your book, uh, where you talk

816
00:47:59.939 --> 00:48:04.520
about Schopenhauer's quote, conception of state and political leadership

817
00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:08.820
as simultaneously protective of life and property. Uh, WE'VE

818
00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:13.139
already talked about that aspect earlier, but also damaging

819
00:48:13.139 --> 00:48:16.209
to free inquiry. So could you tell us about

820
00:48:16.209 --> 00:48:20.649
that specific aspect? I don't think you've already told

821
00:48:20.649 --> 00:48:23.530
us about it. So in what ways, in what

822
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:26.090
ways do you think that it could be damaging

823
00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:27.979
to free inquiry?

824
00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:31.050
So it has to do with this uh relationship

825
00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:34.409
between uh the state on the one hand and

826
00:48:34.409 --> 00:48:38.050
uh religious institutions on the other and the, and

827
00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:40.439
that kind of bond and what that allows people

828
00:48:40.439 --> 00:48:44.250
to say and think in society, so. Um, SO

829
00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:48.070
he realized that he basically felt that religion and

830
00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:51.949
philosophy not only provide answers to the same set

831
00:48:51.949 --> 00:48:54.310
of questions, namely why do we live, why is

832
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:56.270
existence so painful, why am I here? What is

833
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:58.389
the purpose of this? He also thought that they

834
00:48:58.389 --> 00:49:03.620
were basically rivals, that religious clerics, uh, the religious

835
00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:07.270
institutions would look with great suspicion at philosophers. He

836
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:10.290
says at some point. That from the viewpoint of

837
00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:15.810
the clergy, philosophers are some kind of um suspect

838
00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:19.570
traveling horde of people with very dangerous ideas. And

839
00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:23.969
basically, you need to really control philosophers, because you

840
00:49:23.969 --> 00:49:27.169
don't want them to spread their ideas and corrode

841
00:49:27.169 --> 00:49:30.610
religious authority. So he thought there was a rivalry

842
00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:35.399
between the church and uh philosophy. And when the

843
00:49:35.399 --> 00:49:41.300
state connects with the clergy in order to maintain

844
00:49:41.919 --> 00:49:45.639
a message that will render people more pliant, more

845
00:49:45.639 --> 00:49:49.760
docile in society, the state also takes on, or

846
00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.820
they takes the church's side in this rivalry between

847
00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:58.239
religion and philosophy, and starts going after philosophers, and

848
00:49:58.239 --> 00:50:00.139
he felt he had witnessed that in his own

849
00:50:00.139 --> 00:50:04.479
time. So he basically felt that the incredible dominance

850
00:50:04.479 --> 00:50:07.280
of the Hegelian school in his time at the

851
00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.600
university in Berlin and other universities in Germany, was

852
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:16.879
basically German kings and German states, um, privileging Hegelians

853
00:50:16.879 --> 00:50:21.600
because Hegelians uh had a message that was uh

854
00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:26.350
in conformity with local religion. Mhm. So he thought

855
00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:30.719
that, you know, once you get a state team

856
00:50:30.729 --> 00:50:35.510
teaming up with clerics to um to make people

857
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:40.419
more docile as thinkers, as questioners, people like I

858
00:50:40.419 --> 00:50:45.070
suffer, and the free inquiry um becomes uh a

859
00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:47.909
problem, and that's why he thinks, he thought, and

860
00:50:47.909 --> 00:50:50.979
this was a little self-serving. That in the end

861
00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:57.110
Genuine philosophy cannot be maintained at universities. You basically

862
00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:00.810
have to have independent wealth, to truly be able

863
00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:04.209
to think for yourself. And who had independent wealth?

864
00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:06.669
Well, he did. So in some ways he felt

865
00:51:06.669 --> 00:51:12.810
like his position. AN independently wealthy gentleman who lived

866
00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:16.330
on his inheritance all his life, that was the

867
00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:21.179
one truly reliable guarantee for free thinking in society

868
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:26.209
because universities were too easily co-opted by religion and

869
00:51:26.209 --> 00:51:30.050
by clergy because ultimately they were funded in Germany

870
00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:30.689
by the state.

871
00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:36.270
Right. So, um, tell us about, uh, because this

872
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:38.399
is also something you talk about in your book,

873
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:42.979
the connection for Schopenhauer, the connection between the rational

874
00:51:42.979 --> 00:51:47.989
governance of society and the rational self-control of the

875
00:51:47.989 --> 00:51:48.389
individual.

876
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:54.659
So when we talked about his politics um up

877
00:51:54.659 --> 00:51:57.060
until now, we basically talked about the state, the

878
00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:59.860
fact that human beings can use reason to kind

879
00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:04.010
of rationally cooperate and communicate with one another to

880
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:06.899
establish a state that then has the monopoly of

881
00:52:06.899 --> 00:52:09.979
violence. So that's one part of his political philosophy,

882
00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:13.219
but the other part is this, uh, are these

883
00:52:13.219 --> 00:52:17.840
sections inspired by Gracian, the Spanish thinker of prudence.

884
00:52:18.199 --> 00:52:21.080
He believes that we have an obligation to try

885
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:24.489
to maintain peace and calm in our daily lives,

886
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.659
in our social interaction, interactions with others. We need

887
00:52:28.659 --> 00:52:32.199
to learn, he, he thought, Schopenhauer, to restrain our

888
00:52:32.199 --> 00:52:36.330
impulses, to mute our desires, to fit ourselves into

889
00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:39.379
society, and we can do that by having our

890
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:45.679
rational faculties control our. Irrepressible desires you could say.

891
00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.040
So that was another part of his, uh, political

892
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:53.280
philosophy in sals, the, the self-discipline, rational self-discipline for

893
00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:58.679
the sake of, um, orderly, uh civil human interaction.

894
00:53:00.129 --> 00:53:02.770
So there's an individual aspect and there is a

895
00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:05.409
kind of collective aspect to his politics, and in

896
00:53:05.409 --> 00:53:08.429
both cases, he thought that reason was the key,

897
00:53:08.649 --> 00:53:12.409
because reason allows us to understand not our immediate

898
00:53:12.409 --> 00:53:16.889
desire, our immediate apparent immediate interest, but our long

899
00:53:16.889 --> 00:53:19.530
term interest. He said reason kind of works as

900
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:23.889
a profit for us. We can forecast what will

901
00:53:23.889 --> 00:53:27.570
likely happen at a longer time scale, and that's

902
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:31.770
very important just to. Uh, ESTABLISH a state, but

903
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:35.159
also to kind of control our own behavior and

904
00:53:35.159 --> 00:53:37.689
understand what is good for us long term. So

905
00:53:37.689 --> 00:53:42.129
those two things, the, the self-discipline and the construction

906
00:53:42.129 --> 00:53:44.810
of a state, he sees as two activities that

907
00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:49.530
involve human reason for the, for securing, uh, some

908
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:50.689
kind of long-term stability.

909
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:56.590
So you mentioned prudence there. What is prudence and

910
00:53:56.590 --> 00:54:00.030
how does it apply to politics? I mean, what,

911
00:54:00.189 --> 00:54:03.050
what is its role in political action?

912
00:54:03.629 --> 00:54:07.719
So, uh, prudence, the German word is klugheit. And

913
00:54:07.719 --> 00:54:11.000
prudence is for him, the kind of key political

914
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.939
virtue, that what we need to follow or exercise

915
00:54:15.189 --> 00:54:18.919
if we want to um survive and possibly also

916
00:54:18.919 --> 00:54:23.159
thrive in a very treacherous world of constant human

917
00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:25.945
conflict. And what is prudence? Well, prudence. IS again,

918
00:54:25.995 --> 00:54:28.594
just the use of the intellect to secure your

919
00:54:28.594 --> 00:54:31.354
long-term interests. But how do you do that in

920
00:54:31.354 --> 00:54:33.435
a world where everyone is sort of out to

921
00:54:33.435 --> 00:54:35.864
get something from themselves and don't care about you,

922
00:54:35.875 --> 00:54:38.554
and would, would gladly steal from you or kill

923
00:54:38.554 --> 00:54:40.274
you if they could? Well, what you need to

924
00:54:40.274 --> 00:54:42.584
do is you need to understand the motivations of

925
00:54:42.584 --> 00:54:45.195
other people. You need to be able to read

926
00:54:45.195 --> 00:54:47.475
them. They need to be legible to you, so

927
00:54:47.475 --> 00:54:49.594
that you understand where they're heading, what they're trying

928
00:54:49.594 --> 00:54:53.469
to achieve, what they desire. And then for that

929
00:54:53.469 --> 00:54:56.620
can help you manipulate them or avoid their, uh,

930
00:54:56.629 --> 00:54:58.989
avoid provoking them or something. And then you also

931
00:54:58.989 --> 00:55:02.189
need to be able to control your own facade,

932
00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:05.530
so to speak. You need to practice impression management.

933
00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:08.229
You need to conceal your own desires, conceal your

934
00:55:08.229 --> 00:55:11.879
own motivations, and so on. That, those kinds of

935
00:55:12.219 --> 00:55:14.659
the ability to read others, understand others, and the

936
00:55:14.659 --> 00:55:17.979
ability to control yourself, if you have those, that

937
00:55:17.979 --> 00:55:21.739
set of skills, then you possess prudence, and you

938
00:55:21.739 --> 00:55:26.820
can um navigate a society more easily and maybe

939
00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:30.520
survive longer or make a little more money or

940
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:31.659
save your skin, basically.

941
00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:35.770
Mhm. So I guess that since we're talking about

942
00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:40.250
politics and uh another aspect of Schopenhauer's philosophy that

943
00:55:40.439 --> 00:55:44.929
I guess while reading his writings I passed over

944
00:55:44.929 --> 00:55:47.590
or didn't pay too much attention to was that

945
00:55:47.649 --> 00:55:52.139
that he. Also has a philosophy of sociability. So,

946
00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.560
and since we're talking about politics, of course that

947
00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:58.959
is very relevant because politics is basically about uh

948
00:55:58.959 --> 00:56:03.360
collectives of people. Uh, WHAT is social community for

949
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.419
Schopenhauer?

950
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:08.169
So yes, it's another one of those neglected aspects

951
00:56:08.169 --> 00:56:11.439
of uh Schopenhauer's philosophy that I tried to dig

952
00:56:11.439 --> 00:56:15.479
out and reconstruct in the book. So, uh, strangely,

953
00:56:15.489 --> 00:56:21.169
when he talks about morality and politics. Other people

954
00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:23.070
kind of fade away a little bit, in a

955
00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:28.350
certain sense. Uh, WHEN you're compassionate, you grasp that

956
00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:30.510
other human beings are not separate from you, that

957
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:32.669
you're all fellow sufferers, that you are in some

958
00:56:32.669 --> 00:56:35.389
ways one. And so other people kind of fade

959
00:56:35.389 --> 00:56:38.479
away as other people. And when you're engaged in

960
00:56:38.479 --> 00:56:41.840
politics, uh, you approach the world as an egoist

961
00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.280
and you ask yourself, how can I survive and

962
00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.719
live in this world, and, uh, given that other

963
00:56:46.719 --> 00:56:49.110
people uh just are hostile or something, and in

964
00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:53.300
that situation, You don't truly understand others as others,

965
00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:55.790
they're not that interesting or important to you as

966
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:58.350
other people, they're sort of just obstacles that you

967
00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:00.360
have to deal with, and you need to kind

968
00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.629
of silence them or use them or something like

969
00:57:02.629 --> 00:57:06.350
this. So in both morality and politics, both compassion

970
00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:09.790
and political action, other people kind of fade away.

971
00:57:09.909 --> 00:57:14.270
They're either really non-existent or they're mere obstacles. But

972
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:16.510
there is a situation in which he really truly

973
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:19.189
thinks about other people as others, and that is

974
00:57:19.189 --> 00:57:23.850
insociability. But when and why does sociability arise? Well,

975
00:57:23.909 --> 00:57:27.149
he says that when we are satisfied, our needs

976
00:57:27.149 --> 00:57:30.060
are satisfied, our material needs, our hunger, our sexual

977
00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:32.629
desires, and so on. We end up in this

978
00:57:32.629 --> 00:57:34.989
state of boredom that we talked about earlier, a

979
00:57:34.989 --> 00:57:37.870
kind of sense of vacuousness and emptiness that in

980
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:41.270
itself is distressing, right, even when we've satisfied all

981
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:43.429
our needs, we just end up in a new

982
00:57:43.429 --> 00:57:45.909
state of distress, namely boredom, and that can be

983
00:57:45.909 --> 00:57:48.199
very painful in its own right. And when we

984
00:57:48.199 --> 00:57:51.879
are bored, we turn to others for diversion, for

985
00:57:51.879 --> 00:57:55.760
amusement, for company. We play games, we chat, we

986
00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.360
gossip, we drink, we play cards, we go to

987
00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:03.820
dances. There's this whole range of human activities, travel,

988
00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:08.320
sociability, and all those. Things that basically arise out

989
00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.570
of a sense of emptiness that we feel when

990
00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:13.919
other needs are taken care of. So you could

991
00:58:13.919 --> 00:58:16.300
say that we have politics to deal with our

992
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:20.080
aggression, and we have sociability or social community to

993
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:23.360
deal with, uh, a kind of sense of innuendo

994
00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:24.000
or boredom.

995
00:58:25.649 --> 00:58:29.129
So at this point, because I think it's also

996
00:58:29.129 --> 00:58:34.820
relevant when we're talking about politics. Was Schopenhauer a

997
00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:38.979
misanthrope, and I mean, uh, I, I, by misanthrope,

998
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.500
I'm not meaning the common usage of the world,

999
00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:45.659
the word as someone who hates humanity, but as

1000
00:58:45.659 --> 00:58:50.580
someone who sort of morally condemns humanity, which are,

1001
00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:53.100
I guess, two different things, but I mean, was

1002
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:56.580
he a misanthrope and if so, uh, is that

1003
00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:00.500
relevant to how he approached poli politics?

1004
00:59:01.310 --> 00:59:03.389
I, you know, I know that there are articles

1005
00:59:03.389 --> 00:59:05.590
and books about this, so I'm not the best

1006
00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:08.830
person to ask, but I did feel that he's

1007
00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:11.629
not an outright misanthrope. There's too much, too many

1008
00:59:11.629 --> 00:59:13.830
things going on in his philosophy, it's too nuanced

1009
00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:16.949
a view. It's true that he says that he

1010
00:59:16.949 --> 00:59:21.719
understands misanthropes. If you are exposed to humanity, uh,

1011
00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:24.949
the madness of uh living in society with other

1012
00:59:24.949 --> 00:59:28.969
people. Uh, THEN you know how that other human

1013
00:59:28.969 --> 00:59:32.969
beings are scoundrels and thieves and potential murderers, and

1014
00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:36.110
so he says it's not strange that some people

1015
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:39.169
can become misanthropic. He understands misanthropy, which is not

1016
00:59:39.169 --> 00:59:42.090
the same thing as declaring that you yourself are

1017
00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:45.719
one. But as we've discussed earlier, he also has

1018
00:59:45.719 --> 00:59:49.270
this philosophy of compassion. That the highest moral achievement

1019
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:52.469
that we can uh reach is basically feeling compassionate

1020
00:59:52.709 --> 00:59:56.110
with other uh fellow sufferers, I guess humans and

1021
00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:58.500
animals and everything that can suffer. And so that

1022
00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.830
doesn't seem like something a misanthrope would say. Uh,

1023
01:00:01.989 --> 01:00:08.120
I think in the end, He realizes that. Society

1024
01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.360
is very difficult, and yet we can't seem to

1025
01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.560
live without each other either, and the trick is

1026
01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.679
to find some kind of middle ground. There's a

1027
01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:20.000
very famous parable of the hedgehogs somewhere in his

1028
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.919
philosophy where he says that if hedgehogs move too

1029
01:00:23.919 --> 01:00:28.000
close to keep warm and keep company, they start

1030
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.820
hurting each other with their quills or whatever. But

1031
01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:34.600
if they move apart entirely, then they freeze and

1032
01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.830
live alone and feel isolated. So they can't be

1033
01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:40.389
too close, they can't be too far apart, they

1034
01:00:40.389 --> 01:00:43.179
have to find some kind of middle distance, where

1035
01:00:43.179 --> 01:00:45.510
they can maybe get some heat from others without

1036
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:47.570
being too close, and I think that's, in some

1037
01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:51.340
ways a telling parable that he felt like. It's

1038
01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:55.290
very difficult to live collectively with other human beings.

1039
01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.860
Um, WE have to adapt to them, they can

1040
01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:00.840
be a danger to us, and yet living alone,

1041
01:01:01.219 --> 01:01:04.340
completely in total isolation is not really an option

1042
01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.580
either. So again, he's a little bit of a

1043
01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:12.040
philosopher of mitigation, of compromise, rather than a radical

1044
01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:13.479
misanthropy, maybe.

1045
01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:18.489
So earlier when I asked you how you would

1046
01:01:18.489 --> 01:01:23.169
place Schopenhauer in relation to other political philosophers of

1047
01:01:23.169 --> 01:01:28.090
his time, we talked about Hegel, but I mean

1048
01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:31.550
we also talked about Kent but not directly related

1049
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:34.770
to his political views. We talked about his metaphysics

1050
01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:39.090
and how it compares to Schopenhauer's metaphysics, but I

1051
01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:41.889
would also like to ask you now about how.

1052
01:01:42.075 --> 01:01:47.206
Oppenhauer engaged with Kent's political philosophy. Of course, uh,

1053
01:01:47.246 --> 01:01:51.226
I'm not sure if we should place uh Kent

1054
01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:56.115
in the same time period in terms of, uh,

1055
01:01:56.125 --> 01:02:00.006
political philosophers that were part of Schopenhauer's time while

1056
01:02:00.006 --> 01:02:04.285
he was alive because Kent died in 1804 when

1057
01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:08.246
Schopenhauer was 16, so he was already, I mean,

1058
01:02:08.285 --> 01:02:12.001
even though of course he was. AN immensely influential

1059
01:02:12.001 --> 01:02:17.362
philosopher. Kant was, uh, for the philosophers, uh, the

1060
01:02:17.362 --> 01:02:20.711
idealists that, that came after him in Germany and

1061
01:02:20.711 --> 01:02:23.362
elsewhere, uh, and he, of course, he is one

1062
01:02:23.362 --> 01:02:28.082
of the most prominent Enlightenment philosophers. Um, I, I

1063
01:02:28.082 --> 01:02:32.102
mean, but going back to my original question, uh,

1064
01:02:32.362 --> 01:02:36.882
how did Schopenhauer engage with Kant's political philosophy?

1065
01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:39.770
I think he did engage with it in a

1066
01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:43.500
very interesting way. He was very critical of Kant

1067
01:02:43.739 --> 01:02:46.260
and basically he said that, uh, as I said

1068
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.060
earlier, when he approached Hegel, he said, the problem

1069
01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:53.479
with Hegel is that Hegel confuses and conflates morality

1070
01:02:53.479 --> 01:02:56.340
and politics. Hegel thinks that we should fit our

1071
01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.625
lives. Into the state and that the state is

1072
01:02:58.625 --> 01:03:03.465
this guarantor of a of a meaningful civic and

1073
01:03:03.465 --> 01:03:08.185
moral life and this is fundamental misunderstanding of morality

1074
01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:12.425
which consists in individual compassion and politics, which is

1075
01:03:12.425 --> 01:03:18.620
just a device to mute human strife. Interestingly, Schopenhauer

1076
01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:22.209
has a kind of similar cri criticism of Kant's

1077
01:03:22.659 --> 01:03:27.649
political and moral philosophy, so he says that. He

1078
01:03:27.649 --> 01:03:31.290
kind of um engages first with Kant's moral philosophy,

1079
01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:34.370
and he says, well, Kant has these moral ideas

1080
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:36.449
or ideas about morality, and that is that we

1081
01:03:36.449 --> 01:03:39.290
should act according to a maxim that we can

1082
01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:42.719
elevate to the status of a universal law. If

1083
01:03:42.719 --> 01:03:44.290
we act according to a maxim that we can

1084
01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:47.229
elevate to a universal law, then we act morally

1085
01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.639
and so on. And then Schopenhauer says, but wait

1086
01:03:49.639 --> 01:03:53.709
a moment. When Kant speaks about morality, he just

1087
01:03:53.709 --> 01:03:56.629
goes on about the fact that we need to

1088
01:03:56.629 --> 01:03:59.909
kind of self-legislate and that the laws need to

1089
01:03:59.909 --> 01:04:02.060
be universal and that we need to adhere to

1090
01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:04.350
those laws and so on, and that we can

1091
01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:07.669
maybe expect or should expect reciprocity in the adherence

1092
01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:11.489
of laws. Wait a moment, this is all politics.

1093
01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:14.929
He is really talking about the political life. So

1094
01:04:14.929 --> 01:04:18.610
basically Schopenhauer says whenever Kant says he's going to

1095
01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:22.010
talk about morality, what he in fact delivers is

1096
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:26.350
a theory or an account of politics, because morality,

1097
01:04:26.689 --> 01:04:32.129
again he's uh Schopenhauer says, consists in spontaneous compassion

1098
01:04:32.129 --> 01:04:35.709
with other suffering human beings. That's what morality is

1099
01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:39.120
and all this stuff about general laws and acting

1100
01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:42.370
in accordance with duty and so on, that's political

1101
01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:45.520
life, the political domain. So he has this critique

1102
01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.649
of Kant, which is, which says, The problem with

1103
01:04:49.649 --> 01:04:52.919
Kant is that he confuses morality and politics, much

1104
01:04:52.919 --> 01:04:56.889
like Hegel confuses morality and politics, and I, Schopenhauer,

1105
01:04:56.939 --> 01:04:59.979
have arrived, and I can very clearly differentiate these

1106
01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:02.739
activities and keep them apart, and it's a problem

1107
01:05:02.739 --> 01:05:06.040
in German philosophy that people are always mixing them

1108
01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.860
up and letting them be blurred.

1109
01:05:10.449 --> 01:05:14.000
Right. So, uh, we've already talked when I asked

1110
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.520
you about Philipp Meinlander about uh Schopenhauer's views on

1111
01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:24.179
socialism. How about other prominent ideological movements that were,

1112
01:05:24.659 --> 01:05:30.439
uh, very prominent and came into the political picture

1113
01:05:30.439 --> 01:05:35.780
while he was alive like liberalism, conservatism, and nationalism.

1114
01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.820
What were his thoughts on those movements?

1115
01:05:39.389 --> 01:05:42.550
I think uh he was just, um, kind of

1116
01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:46.989
constitutionally averse to any kind of collective movement where

1117
01:05:46.989 --> 01:05:50.370
you have a mass of people espousing a set,

1118
01:05:50.669 --> 01:05:54.870
um, kind of a set number of beliefs that

1119
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:57.860
are cohesive in some way. So I think he

1120
01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.340
was just, I think he was just kind of

1121
01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:03.139
an alien in the world of emerging ideologies. He

1122
01:06:03.139 --> 01:06:05.500
just didn't think of politics as structured in that

1123
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.780
way. He didn't join a party, he didn't join

1124
01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:10.780
a movement, and he would have been horrified by

1125
01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:15.260
the idea, I think. So, just that uh kind

1126
01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:18.469
of pushes him away from, from, um, from mass

1127
01:06:18.469 --> 01:06:21.739
politics organized by ideologies. But he did have a

1128
01:06:21.739 --> 01:06:25.209
number of specific arguments against. Against all these ideologies

1129
01:06:25.209 --> 01:06:27.770
that you mentioned, he didn't like socialism, as we

1130
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:29.409
said, because he didn't think that they had a

1131
01:06:29.409 --> 01:06:33.409
fundamentally right picture of human beings. Uh, SOCIETY cannot

1132
01:06:33.409 --> 01:06:37.090
satisfy everyone's needs, and if it were to satisfy

1133
01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:39.449
everyone's needs, they would still be dissatisfied because they

1134
01:06:39.449 --> 01:06:42.689
would sprout new needs. And if you satisfied those

1135
01:06:42.689 --> 01:06:44.689
needs, then human beings would be bored, and that

1136
01:06:44.689 --> 01:06:46.870
would be a problem on its own. And so

1137
01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:49.570
you can never get out of the distress and

1138
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:52.530
pain of existence, basically. So that was the argument

1139
01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:57.250
against socialism. Uh, AGAINST nationalism, which was extremely prominent

1140
01:06:57.250 --> 01:07:01.199
in his time, espoused by many people that like

1141
01:07:01.199 --> 01:07:03.610
him had lived through the Napoleonic Wars and the

1142
01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:07.770
French occupation of German lands, um, was also anathema

1143
01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:10.689
to him. He, he did not share, uh, his

1144
01:07:10.689 --> 01:07:14.199
generational peers' enthusiasm for the nation at all. Uh,

1145
01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:18.929
HE thought that nationalism prioritizes the community, the national

1146
01:07:18.929 --> 01:07:23.100
community, the ethnic community. That is morally and intellectually

1147
01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.209
kind of meaningless, and so it glorifies a group

1148
01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:29.409
of human beings for all the wrong reasons. And

1149
01:07:29.409 --> 01:07:31.979
then, uh, we mentioned earlier that, you know, he

1150
01:07:31.979 --> 01:07:35.060
wasn't actually much of a conservative in the eyes

1151
01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.100
of his time, because he wasn't a great proponent

1152
01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.500
of the church, he wasn't a great proponent of

1153
01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:44.570
the aristocracy. He didn't believe in the ideals of

1154
01:07:44.570 --> 01:07:48.500
honor and piety and tradition and respect and community,

1155
01:07:48.689 --> 01:07:51.500
and so he just didn't have the vocabulary of

1156
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.590
the most prominent conservatives in Europe at the time.

1157
01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.090
So in that sense he stood apart from all

1158
01:07:57.090 --> 01:08:00.570
ideologies. Again, he was deliberately anachronistic, a kind of

1159
01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:04.250
hoisian in a few 100 years too late, you

1160
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:04.610
could say.

1161
01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:08.959
Uh, I mean, uh, unless I'm getting my timeline

1162
01:08:08.959 --> 01:08:12.280
wrong here, uh, I think that, I mean, he

1163
01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:17.729
was German. He very much directly had to live

1164
01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:20.839
through, uh, what was the, at least the initial

1165
01:08:20.839 --> 01:08:24.580
phases of the transformation of Germany into a nation

1166
01:08:24.919 --> 01:08:28.600
state. Yes, right, so, uh, that's probably one of

1167
01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.916
the reasons why. I had something to say about

1168
01:08:31.916 --> 01:08:32.185
that.

1169
01:08:32.555 --> 01:08:36.386
Absolutely, you know, he lived through his life coincides

1170
01:08:36.386 --> 01:08:39.274
with the rise of national romantic nationalism in Germany,

1171
01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:43.234
and many of his generational peers became prominent nationalists

1172
01:08:43.555 --> 01:08:47.515
who then of course, advocated for a unified Germany,

1173
01:08:47.666 --> 01:08:51.545
which then became a reality shortly after his Schopenhauer's

1174
01:08:51.545 --> 01:08:58.051
death. But Those nationalists, they were very interested in

1175
01:08:58.392 --> 01:09:02.270
the kind of German governance over Germany, and out

1176
01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:05.691
of self-interest, they were very interested in their own

1177
01:09:06.221 --> 01:09:11.352
aspirations being realized, you know, participating in civic life

1178
01:09:11.352 --> 01:09:14.832
in Germany, being members of a political and diplomatic

1179
01:09:14.832 --> 01:09:17.868
and commercial elite, and so on. And so they

1180
01:09:17.868 --> 01:09:21.068
were interested in breaking French dominance over Germany so

1181
01:09:21.068 --> 01:09:24.599
that they themselves could become prominent members of that

1182
01:09:24.599 --> 01:09:26.548
society and didn't have to live under some French

1183
01:09:26.548 --> 01:09:30.548
regime. But of course, Schopenhauer, being a lifelong independently

1184
01:09:30.548 --> 01:09:33.429
wealthy person, he never really had those ambitions and

1185
01:09:33.429 --> 01:09:36.599
hopes. So I think just economically speaking, he was

1186
01:09:36.599 --> 01:09:40.028
a little separate from all the students in his

1187
01:09:40.028 --> 01:09:43.288
generation who were became nationalists and wanted to advance

1188
01:09:43.548 --> 01:09:45.828
within the German future German administration.

1189
01:09:46.979 --> 01:09:49.419
And of course I mean I'm not sure if

1190
01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:53.299
he ever used this kind of terminology and if

1191
01:09:53.299 --> 01:09:57.600
he ever uh emitted this kind of opinion, but

1192
01:09:57.819 --> 01:10:01.339
I, I would imagine that when we talked earlier

1193
01:10:01.339 --> 01:10:04.779
about religion, uh, I, and you said that he

1194
01:10:04.779 --> 01:10:08.995
would put it below philosophy in terms of. Uh,

1195
01:10:09.314 --> 01:10:13.234
IN, in, in terms of intellectual, in the, it's

1196
01:10:13.234 --> 01:10:17.234
their intellectual aspects and rationality, I would imagine that

1197
01:10:17.234 --> 01:10:21.665
you would also not be very fond of, uh,

1198
01:10:21.674 --> 01:10:26.194
myths such as nationalism or a nation-state, right? Because

1199
01:10:26.194 --> 01:10:29.714
that's also another form of myth, of, of mythology.

1200
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:33.560
Yes, I think you're dead on. Uh, HE was

1201
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:38.160
extremely critical of nationalism. He felt like there are

1202
01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.839
a handful of intelligent people in every country, and

1203
01:10:41.839 --> 01:10:46.500
you should really communicate or respect them. To respect

1204
01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.500
or to feel some solidarity with people just because

1205
01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.129
they are ethnic related or speak the same language,

1206
01:10:52.339 --> 01:10:55.779
that's ridiculous. It makes no intellectual sense. Lots of

1207
01:10:55.779 --> 01:10:58.419
people speak your language. Some are intelligent, some are

1208
01:10:58.419 --> 01:11:01.299
not, and you should not necessarily feel any special

1209
01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:05.700
solidarity with them. Right, so intellectually speaking, it makes

1210
01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:08.509
no sense to glorify the nation, and certainly the

1211
01:11:08.509 --> 01:11:11.310
myths of a nation are also just stories and

1212
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:14.200
fables that people tell to feel better, or to

1213
01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:17.129
justify some political action or some conquest or something.

1214
01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:20.359
But then he also felt that morally speaking, nationalism

1215
01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:24.000
was ridiculous, because we owe everyone compassion, not just

1216
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.419
our compatriots, our fellow nationals. And so we need

1217
01:11:27.419 --> 01:11:29.750
to, if someone suffers, it doesn't matter if they're

1218
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:32.759
Portuguese, Spanish, Indonesian, or whatever, we ought to feel

1219
01:11:32.759 --> 01:11:35.399
compassion with them. So in some sense, the nation

1220
01:11:35.399 --> 01:11:39.520
was either too vast a collective, not a small

1221
01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:43.959
intellectual elite, or too small a collective, not everyone

1222
01:11:43.959 --> 01:11:46.589
who suffers. And so nationalism didn't make sense to

1223
01:11:46.589 --> 01:11:48.359
him. But I will say that a lot of

1224
01:11:48.359 --> 01:11:52.720
the nationalists of his time. We also tenddentially more

1225
01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.799
democratic. They felt that the government should reflect the

1226
01:11:57.799 --> 01:12:02.040
people just simply by maybe speaking the same language

1227
01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.839
as the people. You shouldn't have a French regime

1228
01:12:04.839 --> 01:12:08.680
ruling over a German speaking people. So tendentialally speaking,

1229
01:12:08.759 --> 01:12:10.640
you could say that the nationalists had more of

1230
01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:13.990
a democratic sensibility. And at the time, of course,

1231
01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:18.759
nationalists were considered the progressives and the revolutionaries, because

1232
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:21.970
they wanted to reorganize all of political life along

1233
01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:27.169
national lines. And so, because, because Schopenhauer is not

1234
01:12:27.169 --> 01:12:30.370
a democrat in any way, he also felt that

1235
01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:33.390
nationalism had no appeal whatsoever.

1236
01:12:34.509 --> 01:12:38.990
So we've already talked about how he didn't like

1237
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:41.540
socialism and the reasons why he didn't like it,

1238
01:12:41.629 --> 01:12:44.270
but do you think that he would have been

1239
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:51.435
at least sympathetic toward the internationalist aspect of. Of,

1240
01:12:51.584 --> 01:12:55.254
uh, for example, communist movements in the 20th century

1241
01:12:55.254 --> 01:12:59.714
because at least they didn't have, uh, or didn't

1242
01:12:59.714 --> 01:13:04.714
limit things to the nation. They wanted to be

1243
01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:07.854
for the movement to really be international.

1244
01:13:08.799 --> 01:13:10.919
I, that's an interesting question. I don't really know

1245
01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:13.109
how to answer it. I think that Schopenhauer was

1246
01:13:13.109 --> 01:13:18.640
a very dedicated cultural cosmopolitan. That he truly believed

1247
01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:22.509
that to understand the greatness of human artistic life

1248
01:13:22.509 --> 01:13:25.910
and human philosophy, we need to be cosmopolitans. We

1249
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:29.160
need to read across all national lines, and of

1250
01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.399
course he is famous for very being very appreciative

1251
01:13:33.399 --> 01:13:35.839
of Eastern thought, which you brought up too, that

1252
01:13:35.839 --> 01:13:39.899
he believed that Eastern religions had truly an incredible

1253
01:13:39.899 --> 01:13:42.319
a kernel of insight and wisdom that we need

1254
01:13:42.319 --> 01:13:45.859
to spread to Europe, and he was incredibly uh

1255
01:13:45.859 --> 01:13:50.620
um. Um, WELL informed, you know, reading scholarly journals

1256
01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:54.299
about, uh, Asian languages and Asian cultures, and he

1257
01:13:54.299 --> 01:14:00.020
was the very opposite of, uh, a narrow-minded, parochial,

1258
01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:03.899
provincial promoter of his own nation. But I think

1259
01:14:03.899 --> 01:14:07.939
he is more a person. I don't think. Uh,

1260
01:14:08.089 --> 01:14:09.490
I think it's better to think of him as

1261
01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:13.169
a kind of legatee of the influence of Goethe,

1262
01:14:13.290 --> 01:14:16.609
the great, uh, German, you know, who he knew

1263
01:14:16.609 --> 01:14:19.560
personally, and the great German writer who also had

1264
01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:23.649
a similar appreciation for the wonderful achievements of all

1265
01:14:23.649 --> 01:14:27.410
culture rather than the narrow, narrow achievements of your

1266
01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:28.089
own province.

1267
01:14:28.919 --> 01:14:33.319
OK. So I, I mean, um, I get the

1268
01:14:33.319 --> 01:14:38.359
sense that er Schopenhauer, at least to some extent,

1269
01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:44.250
at least intellectually, intellectually was an elitist. So, um,

1270
01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.240
what did they think about aristocracy?

1271
01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:51.810
So, I think you're right, he is intellectually an

1272
01:14:51.810 --> 01:14:55.490
elitist. He thinks that some ideas, some modes of

1273
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:57.810
life are truly only available to a small set

1274
01:14:57.810 --> 01:15:00.910
of remarkable people, and they can never be generalized,

1275
01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.770
and that you owe respect intellectually only to a

1276
01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:06.089
handful of people, of course, he is a member

1277
01:15:06.089 --> 01:15:10.350
of that very small elect group, he thought, uh,

1278
01:15:11.129 --> 01:15:15.029
but. The fact that he's an elitist doesn't necessarily

1279
01:15:15.029 --> 01:15:17.029
mean he likes the aristocracy. In fact, he sees

1280
01:15:17.029 --> 01:15:20.470
the aristocracy as a kind of rival elite, and

1281
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:24.189
that people have to dismantle their respect, their misguided

1282
01:15:24.189 --> 01:15:28.870
respect for this social, political elite and direct their

1283
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:32.290
respect to the actual. Elite, namely the intellectual, spiritual

1284
01:15:32.290 --> 01:15:34.750
elite. So you could say that he's kind of

1285
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:39.350
venomous about aristo aristocrats because it is the wrong

1286
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:42.509
kind of elitism. It is an elitism that is

1287
01:15:42.509 --> 01:15:46.700
superficial and idiotic rather than, uh, you know, genuinely

1288
01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:49.569
well founded. So he doesn't like the aristocracy, and

1289
01:15:49.569 --> 01:15:53.580
he often talks about the authentic aristocracy of the

1290
01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:56.459
mind, you know, trying to separate it from this

1291
01:15:56.459 --> 01:16:00.370
inauthentic aristocracy of social caste or something. But there

1292
01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:04.419
was another thing that made him dislike the aristocracy,

1293
01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:08.839
and that is that aristocrats still was. Still held

1294
01:16:08.839 --> 01:16:12.319
on to their privilege of bearing weapons, of fighting

1295
01:16:12.319 --> 01:16:18.720
duels, of basically being legitimately violent towards others, towards

1296
01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:21.879
other people who had insulted them or damaged their

1297
01:16:21.879 --> 01:16:24.799
honor or something like that, and he was just

1298
01:16:24.799 --> 01:16:29.759
adamantly against any kind of action of violent action

1299
01:16:29.759 --> 01:16:32.080
by individuals in society. He felt that there should

1300
01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.839
be a police force. There should be a judiciary,

1301
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.470
and the state should handle that should fully monopolize

1302
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:40.839
violence, and aristocrats for him was just kind of

1303
01:16:40.839 --> 01:16:43.870
a strange activism in society. These people who ran

1304
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:46.080
around with swords still and insisted that they could

1305
01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.359
fight duels. He really abhorred that.

1306
01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:51.870
Uh, BUT then do you think that he would

1307
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:55.729
have been in favor of, uh, not an, an

1308
01:16:55.729 --> 01:16:59.189
aristocracy but an epistocracy?

1309
01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:04.310
In some sense, yes, I think he, he had

1310
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:08.290
great respect for philosophers, for intellectuals, and so on,

1311
01:17:08.509 --> 01:17:10.750
but he also added that he didn't think that

1312
01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:15.029
philosophers who were so geared towards contemplation of the

1313
01:17:15.029 --> 01:17:20.589
world and recognition of the general laws and the

1314
01:17:20.589 --> 01:17:23.229
forms of the universe, he didn't think that they

1315
01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:26.375
were. Equipped to rule the world, he said that

1316
01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:30.655
philosophers, they use their reason to the maximum, but

1317
01:17:30.655 --> 01:17:33.735
it's no longer subservient to the will. It's no

1318
01:17:33.735 --> 01:17:37.056
longer politically useful. So he didn't believe in a

1319
01:17:37.056 --> 01:17:40.735
philosopher king or an epistocracy because he felt like

1320
01:17:40.735 --> 01:17:45.105
genuine philosophers, philosophers will be pretty impractical and will

1321
01:17:45.105 --> 01:17:48.341
be turned away from the world of. Of ambition

1322
01:17:48.341 --> 01:17:50.921
and violence and honor and so on, he did

1323
01:17:50.921 --> 01:17:54.562
think though that monarchies would probably be best for

1324
01:17:54.562 --> 01:17:59.642
philosophers because in the monarchy, the ruler is kind

1325
01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:02.521
of taken out of all contestation. The ruler is

1326
01:18:02.521 --> 01:18:05.282
always the ruler, and he doesn't have to seem

1327
01:18:05.282 --> 01:18:08.202
like the most intelligent person or the best person.

1328
01:18:08.521 --> 01:18:11.390
He is just an unquestioned ruler. And he felt

1329
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:15.149
that was better for intellectual life when the ruler

1330
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:17.620
felt like he didn't have to compete with philosophers.

1331
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:21.549
He didn't like more egalitarian systems where the ruler

1332
01:18:21.549 --> 01:18:24.629
would be kind of um pretend to be also

1333
01:18:24.629 --> 01:18:28.350
the most intelligent person, or the most intellectually gifted

1334
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:30.750
person. So you could say that he liked this

1335
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:35.100
idea of maybe a Prussian king, uh, corresponding with

1336
01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:37.549
Voltaire or something. That was his ideal of a

1337
01:18:37.549 --> 01:18:40.009
relationship between the philosopher and the king. He didn't

1338
01:18:40.009 --> 01:18:42.850
think that the king should be a rival thinker

1339
01:18:42.850 --> 01:18:44.410
or something like that, or the ruler should be

1340
01:18:44.410 --> 01:18:45.310
a rival thinker.

1341
01:18:46.169 --> 01:18:48.370
Yeah, no, I also asked you about that because

1342
01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:52.810
in recent times we've seen, I, I mean, I

1343
01:18:52.810 --> 01:18:56.049
wouldn't even call it a resurgence because I think

1344
01:18:56.049 --> 01:18:59.450
it's not that many people making those kinds of

1345
01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:02.910
claims, but for example, in the US there's the

1346
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:07.100
libertarian economist Brian Kaplan making that kind of argument,

1347
01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:09.770
and in Portugal, there's also a philosopher making that

1348
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:13.430
kind of argument that they claim that because most

1349
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:18.549
people are. And informed in terms of politics that

1350
01:19:18.549 --> 01:19:24.629
perhaps only an epistemic elite people who prove that

1351
01:19:24.629 --> 01:19:28.410
they are sufficiently informed in terms of politics should

1352
01:19:28.410 --> 01:19:32.000
have the right to vote and I mean sometimes

1353
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.229
they make other claims in terms of political participation,

1354
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:38.029
but at least in terms of voting and I

1355
01:19:38.029 --> 01:19:41.069
mean I'm not very fond of that kind of

1356
01:19:41.069 --> 01:19:44.430
idea because I I don't think that uh intellect.

1357
01:19:44.529 --> 01:19:47.129
I mean, I, I of course respect very much

1358
01:19:47.129 --> 01:19:50.569
intellectuals, but I don't think that we should, we

1359
01:19:50.569 --> 01:19:53.689
should let an elite of people, even if they

1360
01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:58.569
are highly intellectual, to make decisions for everyone in

1361
01:19:58.569 --> 01:20:02.649
society, because I don't think that any elite, any

1362
01:20:02.649 --> 01:20:07.229
minority of people is sufficiently well equipped to weigh

1363
01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:14.149
properly, the conflicting interests of people in society. You

1364
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.410
know,

1365
01:20:14.669 --> 01:20:16.620
I remember that. I, is it called The Myth

1366
01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:20.270
of the Rational Voucher, that book by? Yes, yes,

1367
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:22.580
I looked at, I was years and years and

1368
01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.950
years ago, it's probably, um, I, I don't know

1369
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:27.109
to what extent, uh, Schopenhauer is an ally here.

1370
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:29.350
It is, it is true that he too thinks

1371
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:31.765
the masses are ignorant. And that they shouldn't be

1372
01:20:31.765 --> 01:20:34.325
involved in politics. So in that sense, it's just

1373
01:20:34.325 --> 01:20:36.004
that he doesn't think that you can have a

1374
01:20:36.004 --> 01:20:40.604
philosophical elite running society, because the genuine philosophers will

1375
01:20:40.604 --> 01:20:44.305
be solving issues that go far beyond politics, issues

1376
01:20:44.305 --> 01:20:46.165
that the questions about the purpose of life and

1377
01:20:46.165 --> 01:20:48.805
the constitution of the world and so on. And,

1378
01:20:48.814 --> 01:20:51.524
uh, and philosophers are not practical beings to begin

1379
01:20:51.524 --> 01:20:53.314
with. That's just his kind of picture of a

1380
01:20:53.314 --> 01:20:56.680
philosopher. Uh, BUT he is in some ways a

1381
01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:59.319
neo-absolutist in that he does think that there should,

1382
01:20:59.399 --> 01:21:02.379
that monarchy is the best, monarchy is the best,

1383
01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:07.240
um, regime type for human beings. Um, uh, EVERYTHING

1384
01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:11.040
else is a little too volatile, um, and runs

1385
01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.359
the risk of being too fickle, too combustible, and

1386
01:21:14.359 --> 01:21:14.680
so on.

1387
01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:21.939
OK. So another interesting thing is that um during

1388
01:21:21.939 --> 01:21:25.939
his time when he was alive, uh, we, he

1389
01:21:25.939 --> 01:21:29.740
also, I mean, not witnessed directly, of course, but

1390
01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:35.475
probably informed. Himself of the early development of the

1391
01:21:35.475 --> 01:21:38.084
United States, I mean, because the independence was in

1392
01:21:38.084 --> 01:21:43.145
1776 and he was born just 12 years later,

1393
01:21:43.154 --> 01:21:47.479
and so those early stages of the Um, American

1394
01:21:47.479 --> 01:21:51.419
republic, he, he at least could have informed himself

1395
01:21:51.419 --> 01:21:54.060
about it. Uh, DID he have any thoughts about

1396
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:54.649
the US?

1397
01:21:54.979 --> 01:21:57.540
Plenty, I mean, he, as you say, his life

1398
01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:01.259
coincided with the rise of America from being kind

1399
01:22:01.259 --> 01:22:05.859
of a, a colony far away to being basically

1400
01:22:05.859 --> 01:22:08.580
one of the emerging world powers. I mean that

1401
01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:12.430
happened basically during his lifetime. And he was quite

1402
01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:14.959
well informed. He was an Anglophile. He read English,

1403
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.919
he read British newspapers, he read travel accounts from

1404
01:22:18.919 --> 01:22:21.839
America. He never visited, but he was pretty well

1405
01:22:21.839 --> 01:22:24.319
informed, and he had lots of views. I mean,

1406
01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:27.779
I think he was very curious and interested in.

1407
01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:32.279
The number of institutional experiments that happened in America.

1408
01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:35.640
He was interested in their penal reforms, in the

1409
01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.109
renewal of religious life in America with all the

1410
01:22:38.109 --> 01:22:42.160
sects, and he was also appreciative of the interest

1411
01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.000
in new ideas. So he talks about the Philadelphia

1412
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.160
Society for Animal Rights and things like that. So

1413
01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.540
he was appreciative in that way. But he didn't

1414
01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:54.620
think that this enthusiasm for novelty worked politically, so

1415
01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:58.939
he was quite critical of American republicanism. He basically

1416
01:22:58.939 --> 01:23:03.299
felt the American republic was too fickle in its

1417
01:23:03.299 --> 01:23:07.779
international connections, its international diplomacy. It waged too many

1418
01:23:07.779 --> 01:23:10.950
wars, it was too unpredictable. Uh, IT didn't pay

1419
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:13.950
its debts, and that American society was also very

1420
01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:17.490
violent. A lot of duels, a lot of, um,

1421
01:23:17.899 --> 01:23:21.189
uh, homicides, a lot of lynching, and the worst

1422
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:23.430
thing about America, and he returns to this again

1423
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:27.149
and again, was, uh, uh, American slavery, the enslavement

1424
01:23:27.149 --> 01:23:30.899
of African Americans. And he thought this was just

1425
01:23:30.899 --> 01:23:35.049
absolutely abhorrent, and, uh, and he was very well

1426
01:23:35.049 --> 01:23:37.419
informed about it. This is in some way, and

1427
01:23:37.419 --> 01:23:42.700
strangely, and uh uh strangely, he thought that the

1428
01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:45.060
fact that America was a republic and the fact

1429
01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:48.100
that there was slavery in America, he connected those

1430
01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:52.910
two things. In his mind. The ancient republics of

1431
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:56.640
Greece were often built on enslavement of large numbers

1432
01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.810
of people, and when he saw the American republic

1433
01:24:00.029 --> 01:24:03.950
being a slave economy partly, he also felt like

1434
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:08.509
this just confirmed his idea that republics are are

1435
01:24:08.509 --> 01:24:13.950
suspect and that they really are morally and politically

1436
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:18.029
deficient and. And objectionable

1437
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:22.279
OK, uh, and I mean you've already mentioned that

1438
01:24:22.279 --> 01:24:26.439
uh his preferred political system would have been the

1439
01:24:26.439 --> 01:24:30.640
monarchy, but since we're also talking about the US

1440
01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.359
here, here, uh, what did they think about republicanism?

1441
01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:38.100
So as I already kind of indicated, he basically

1442
01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:41.779
felt that republicanism was, uh, had a contin uh

1443
01:24:41.779 --> 01:24:43.970
was one, it was a continuum, so he, he

1444
01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:46.779
talks about ancient republics and modern republics and uh

1445
01:24:46.779 --> 01:24:48.779
on the same page, and he thinks that they

1446
01:24:48.779 --> 01:24:51.790
have the same problems. What I think he's saying,

1447
01:24:51.859 --> 01:24:53.259
and he's not saying it very clearly, it's sort

1448
01:24:53.259 --> 01:24:55.160
of implied, but what I think he's saying is

1449
01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:00.490
that. Republics introduce more people into the business of

1450
01:25:00.490 --> 01:25:03.129
rule. You have more people who can take the

1451
01:25:03.129 --> 01:25:06.649
lead, more people who are active politically who interact

1452
01:25:06.649 --> 01:25:10.279
and shape politics. You have more political actors basically,

1453
01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:13.770
and monarchies only has one king and one ruler,

1454
01:25:13.930 --> 01:25:16.370
and when that king dies, the next king or

1455
01:25:16.370 --> 01:25:19.450
queen takes over, and everyone else is sort of

1456
01:25:19.450 --> 01:25:24.089
subordinate to that king and queen. The problem with

1457
01:25:24.089 --> 01:25:27.330
republics, he said, were basically twofold. On the one

1458
01:25:27.330 --> 01:25:30.569
hand, if you introduce more agents, more actors, there

1459
01:25:30.569 --> 01:25:33.089
will be more strife, there will be no more

1460
01:25:33.089 --> 01:25:35.930
collisions, there will be more intrigue, so you get

1461
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:40.270
more volatility and less peace. That's not good. So

1462
01:25:40.450 --> 01:25:44.450
republics tend to be more anarchic than monarchies, and

1463
01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:47.649
that's an argument in favor of monarchy. But then

1464
01:25:47.649 --> 01:25:51.089
he also implied. That all those people who in

1465
01:25:51.089 --> 01:25:54.740
republics who are now political agents, they need a

1466
01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:58.419
kind of power base. They need resources to act

1467
01:25:58.419 --> 01:26:01.979
like mini kings in this way, and that's why

1468
01:26:01.979 --> 01:26:05.459
there is slavery. All of those people who were

1469
01:26:05.459 --> 01:26:09.299
working in Virginia to shape American politics and create

1470
01:26:09.299 --> 01:26:11.379
the new American republic, not all, but many of

1471
01:26:11.379 --> 01:26:13.479
them or most of them were also slave owners,

1472
01:26:13.779 --> 01:26:16.950
and he thought that was very telling. So republics,

1473
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.080
he pointed out, were tended tended also to be

1474
01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.640
more despotic than monarchies because each of those individual

1475
01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:29.479
republican agents relied for their resources and for their

1476
01:26:29.479 --> 01:26:32.439
money and everything on like a vast army of

1477
01:26:32.439 --> 01:26:35.330
slaves who worked and labored under them. So he

1478
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:38.129
basically said republics, they might look nice on the

1479
01:26:38.129 --> 01:26:41.850
page. It's all about freedom and liberty and equality,

1480
01:26:42.169 --> 01:26:45.609
but in fact they're too fractious, they're too fractured.

1481
01:26:45.689 --> 01:26:49.529
They're too, too much strife, too anarchic, and because

1482
01:26:49.529 --> 01:26:52.410
they typically Rely on slave labor, they're too despotic.

1483
01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:55.850
Monarchies are better, yes, it seems like we all

1484
01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:58.169
have to be in one hierarchy under a king,

1485
01:26:58.410 --> 01:27:02.509
but that hierarchy is to be preferred over enslavement

1486
01:27:02.729 --> 01:27:07.259
and fracturing in republics. Mhm. So it's a sort

1487
01:27:07.259 --> 01:27:10.979
of anti pro-monarchist, anti-slavery arguments.

1488
01:27:11.890 --> 01:27:16.540
OK. So, and finally, and this sort of surprised

1489
01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:18.859
me when I was reading your book. I mean,

1490
01:27:19.339 --> 01:27:21.819
even though in hindsight, I guess that I should

1491
01:27:21.819 --> 01:27:25.859
have expected that he would also have opinions on

1492
01:27:25.859 --> 01:27:29.009
China's political system because he was also informed on

1493
01:27:29.009 --> 01:27:32.979
Asian affairs, but, uh, what did you think about

1494
01:27:32.979 --> 01:27:34.509
China's political system

1495
01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:37.740
from he, so he was, uh, he was very

1496
01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:43.029
appreciative of the Chinese, uh, political. Um, SYSTEM now,

1497
01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:46.000
he again, he had not visited China. He relied

1498
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.560
on travel accounts. He relied on scholarly journals who

1499
01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:52.600
brought him information about China, but he was very

1500
01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:57.379
interested, mostly I think in the religious insights, religious

1501
01:27:57.379 --> 01:27:59.600
wisdom, but he also had things to say about

1502
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.919
the political system. And basically, I think that China

1503
01:28:02.919 --> 01:28:07.220
for him became the ideal, the political ideal, because

1504
01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:11.109
on the one hand, China was resolutely hierarchical. There

1505
01:28:11.109 --> 01:28:13.660
was an emperor and there was a vast bureaucratic

1506
01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:17.290
apparatus, and then there was everyone else, and power,

1507
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:19.870
and the monopoly of violence was firmly in the

1508
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:23.500
hands of the state, and it was a calm,

1509
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:27.149
stable, orderly, hierarchical system. So that's all good. That's

1510
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:30.259
what he wants from politics, right? On the other

1511
01:28:30.259 --> 01:28:33.459
hand though, he pointed out that the Chinese religions

1512
01:28:33.459 --> 01:28:37.189
were not necessarily theistic. There was no Catholic or

1513
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:41.459
Christian church who insisted on controlling thought, and so

1514
01:28:41.459 --> 01:28:46.620
he felt like. Intellectually, there might be more freedom

1515
01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:50.479
in a place like China, where the uh religious

1516
01:28:50.479 --> 01:28:55.540
institutions aren't committed to a kind of a misguided

1517
01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:59.419
theism and trying to impose its ideas of the

1518
01:28:59.419 --> 01:29:02.290
savior and the God and the Son of God

1519
01:29:02.290 --> 01:29:07.459
onto philosophy. So he basically felt in, in America,

1520
01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.779
I get kind of freedom, but I get too

1521
01:29:09.779 --> 01:29:14.790
much violence and too much despotism. In uh in

1522
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:17.700
uh in Europe, I get stable monarchies and the

1523
01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:21.419
kind of peace given a guaranteed by them, but

1524
01:29:21.419 --> 01:29:26.020
I also get censorship and religious control of free

1525
01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:29.180
thought. But maybe in China, I can see a

1526
01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:35.229
combination of rigorous hierarchy. And calm and order coupled

1527
01:29:35.229 --> 01:29:41.549
with a weaker religious influence and so sort of

1528
01:29:42.029 --> 01:29:45.430
potentially a place for my type of philosophy. So

1529
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:47.990
this is maybe just a projection, but he did

1530
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:50.709
see China as a kind of political ideal. China,

1531
01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:55.069
in China, his ideas about a combination of free

1532
01:29:55.069 --> 01:29:58.250
thinking and high and political hierarchy had been realized.

1533
01:29:59.490 --> 01:30:02.620
OK, so I have just one final question then,

1534
01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:05.419
and uh I mean, I'm not sure if this

1535
01:30:05.419 --> 01:30:08.100
is a very fair question to ask, but I

1536
01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:10.899
mean, since people do it, since people when they

1537
01:30:10.899 --> 01:30:14.930
think about or talk about political philosophers, political thinkers,

1538
01:30:15.259 --> 01:30:18.060
they try to put them into boxes like for

1539
01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:22.890
example, oh. Work was more conservative. Payne was more

1540
01:30:22.890 --> 01:30:28.729
liberal, and then there's the republicanists, the monarchists nowadays

1541
01:30:28.729 --> 01:30:31.970
in more recent times, the right wingers, the left

1542
01:30:31.970 --> 01:30:37.589
wingers, the socialists, the anarchists, the anarcho-capitalists, the anarcho-socialists,

1543
01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:40.410
and so on and so forth. Um, I mean,

1544
01:30:40.890 --> 01:30:45.729
would you attach any label at all to Schopenhauer

1545
01:30:45.729 --> 01:30:47.410
as a political philosopher?

1546
01:30:48.450 --> 01:30:51.830
I think it's hard. I, I, um, maybe I

1547
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:54.299
would say that he is a kind of, uh,

1548
01:30:54.979 --> 01:30:59.220
uh, Hobbesian liberal or something, that he does believe

1549
01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:03.259
in, uh, individual freedom to some extent, but under

1550
01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:08.549
a strong, um, monarchical state, you know, that was

1551
01:31:08.549 --> 01:31:14.359
his political ideal, uh. Now, when people say that

1552
01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:17.229
he is a conservative, I mean, maybe in some

1553
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:19.620
ways they're right in that if you placed him

1554
01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:22.740
today on a kind of ideological spectrum, he would

1555
01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:25.299
probably be more to the right or more in

1556
01:31:25.299 --> 01:31:27.779
the conservative camp. But one of the points I

1557
01:31:27.779 --> 01:31:29.620
make in the book, as I've said, is that

1558
01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:33.700
he wasn't necessarily recognizable to conservatives in his own

1559
01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:36.299
time. He didn't have ties to the aristocracy, to

1560
01:31:36.299 --> 01:31:40.339
the church. He wasn't really sycophantic in his relationship

1561
01:31:40.339 --> 01:31:43.779
to the king. Um, HE didn't really like the

1562
01:31:43.779 --> 01:31:47.259
traditional elites. Uh, HE didn't really invoke values such

1563
01:31:47.259 --> 01:31:49.290
as religion and piety and so on and so

1564
01:31:49.290 --> 01:31:52.060
forth. So in his own time, he was not

1565
01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:55.569
really recognizable as a conservative, but maybe today we

1566
01:31:55.569 --> 01:31:56.220
would call him one.

1567
01:31:57.870 --> 01:32:02.229
OK, so the book is again Schopenhauer's Politics and

1568
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:04.229
I'm of course leaving a link to it in

1569
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:07.709
the description of the interview. Um, AND Doctor Norberg,

1570
01:32:07.790 --> 01:32:10.169
just before we go, would you like to tell

1571
01:32:10.169 --> 01:32:13.109
people where they can find you and your work

1572
01:32:13.109 --> 01:32:14.069
on the internet?

1573
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:20.169
So, um, if they type in Schopenhauer's Politics, uh,

1574
01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:23.729
and Cambridge University Press, they should find the website

1575
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:27.890
where the text, the whole book is available, open

1576
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:30.310
access, you can just download the chapters and read

1577
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:33.589
it. Uh, SO it should be widely available for

1578
01:32:33.589 --> 01:32:34.950
everyone. If you just type in my name and

1579
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:36.290
the title of the book, it's there.

1580
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:40.470
OK, great. So thank you so much for taking

1581
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:42.100
the time to come on the show. It's been

1582
01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:43.770
