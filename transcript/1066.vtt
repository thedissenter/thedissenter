00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:02.890
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.840
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes and

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.420
today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor Carl

4
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.239
Freston. Last time we talked a lot about the

5
00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:14.029
free energy principle and today we're going to talk

6
00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.850
about how a free energy pri The framework applies

7
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.850
to culture, the relationship between the free energy principle

8
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.450
and embodied cognition and more generally for ecognition and

9
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.600
some other related topics. So, Doctor Friesen, welcome back

10
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.799
to the show. It's always a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.930
It's a pleasure to be back. Thank you for

12
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.490
inviting me. So,

13
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.619
let's start by talking here a little bit about

14
00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:45.150
culture. So, uh how, or how would you say

15
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.380
a free energy principle framework applies to culture? I

16
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.130
mean, how do you approach culture through that framework?

17
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.529
The most obvious way would be to apply the

18
00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:06.529
free energy principle to cultural niche construction. So by

19
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.389
by which I mean Acknowledging that not only are

20
00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:15.309
we trying to fit our environments, but by acting

21
00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:19.910
upon the environments we are also constructing many important

22
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.940
aspects of those environments, those niches, and of course

23
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.779
because we're doing it together, these niches are co-constructed,

24
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.190
so the application of the free energy principle in

25
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.069
that setting really reduces to how do I navigate

26
00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.919
my world. In order to reduce uncertainty. In the

27
00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:45.069
special circumstance that this world is occupied by lots

28
00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.470
of things that are like me and some of

29
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.470
other things that are not like me, and how

30
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.989
do I make it as predictable as possible and

31
00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:57.949
of course once one has that imperative, namely reducing

32
00:01:57.949 --> 00:02:03.470
uncertainty by rendering your eco niche cultural, social, or

33
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:11.729
physical more predictable, then you have a Principled motivation

34
00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:15.570
for things like belief sharing, communication that can be

35
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.089
either direct in terms of what we're doing now,

36
00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:22.479
actually sharing ideas and beliefs. Offloaded my poster beliefs

37
00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:26.000
so that you could understand them, um, or indirectly

38
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.800
by the environment. Uh, SO, you know, my favorite

39
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.729
example of that is, um, The desire path or

40
00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:39.210
the elephant path, so the appearance of trodden worn

41
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.449
grass in shortcuts that people take to their favorite

42
00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:46.500
destinations. So strictly speaking this is an attribute of

43
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.490
the environment, and yet it was caused by my

44
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.699
action and your action and in Installing or changing

45
00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.889
the environment in this particular way, I've implicitly created

46
00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.339
a cue or a sign or some evidence in

47
00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:06.759
the environment that you can now use to infer,

48
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.779
well, if I take this path, I'm going to

49
00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.020
get to where I want to go, or at

50
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.100
least where things like me usually want to go

51
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.020
more efficiently and more more quickly, and you can

52
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.809
take that idea and generalize it to. Uh, THINGS

53
00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:24.449
that we explicitly design, and I'm referring obliquely here

54
00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.809
to Andy Clark's notion of the designer environment, such

55
00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:34.720
as, um, signs, traffic lights. Books, language, and culture

56
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.729
of a more general sort, things that make our

57
00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:42.330
life more predictable, more sustainable, and easier to navigate.

58
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.449
Mhm. And what, what happens when we face people

59
00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.130
with different ideas because from a free energy principle

60
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.809
perspective, we have the goal of reducing surprise and

61
00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:58.169
uncertainty, correct?

62
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.100
Yeah, that's a really good question, very prescient given,

63
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:09.729
you know, current political and geopolitical situations. So Most

64
00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:14.289
of my understanding of the answer to that question

65
00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:21.048
inherits from numerical simulations, agent-based simulations, where crucially the

66
00:04:21.048 --> 00:04:25.880
agents are equipped with active inference, which simply means

67
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.899
that they behave in a way that Um, solicits

68
00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:36.190
information from other people or the environment or the

69
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.070
population, um, in which they find themselves. That reduces

70
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.109
our uncertainty about the states of affairs and the

71
00:04:44.109 --> 00:04:48.859
situation in which they find themselves. In doing that,

72
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.859
you have to, um, Decide who you're going to

73
00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:55.339
ask, who you're going to talk to. So this

74
00:04:55.339 --> 00:05:00.779
is one aspect of the epistemic affordances that we

75
00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:04.980
were, we've talked about previously, the choosing those behaviors

76
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.450
and maximize your expected information gain. So you have

77
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.459
to make a decision about what quality of information

78
00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:15.140
am I going to get if I ask this

79
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.089
person. In other words, I have to evaluate the

80
00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:21.760
epistemic trust that I place in this source of

81
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.010
information, be it a person, an institution, a news

82
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.510
channel, a social media source. I am therefore in

83
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.980
the very difficult situation of selecting among a number

84
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.350
of different sources of information which could be other

85
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.510
people and those other people have to be evaluated

86
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.149
in terms of how trustworthy are they in terms

87
00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:48.149
of providing. UNAMBIGUOUS, precise information that will enable me

88
00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:53.579
to resolve my uncertainty about states of affairs. What

89
00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:56.410
am I going to do in terms of evaluating

90
00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:01.019
their trustworthiness? Well, one obvious thing is if they

91
00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:03.769
look like me and talk like me, then they

92
00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:06.579
are likely to share the same understanding of the

93
00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:08.940
world and have the kind of knowledge that is

94
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.019
going to be useful for me in terms of

95
00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:13.820
resolving my uncertainty. So I'm going to have to

96
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.859
make an inference about whether you are like me

97
00:06:17.859 --> 00:06:20.480
or not. So to put that very simply, are

98
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.920
you with my group or are you in another

99
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.649
group? If I can make that inference, then I

100
00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:29.369
can choose who to listen to. So one gets

101
00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:34.450
to this situation where there's a paradox. On the

102
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.649
one hand, I am going to choose to listen

103
00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:38.649
to those people who are likely to agree with

104
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:40.850
me because we have a shared narrative, a shared

105
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.170
generative model, some common ground in the way that

106
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.890
we understand the world, and I'm going to effectively

107
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.730
induce an echo chamber or we are collectively going

108
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.609
to induce an echo chamber. But remember, we're also

109
00:06:53.609 --> 00:06:57.670
quintessentially curious because we are also also chasing information.

110
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.049
We're acting in a way to maximize information gain.

111
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.440
So I'm going to be quite curious about you,

112
00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:04.570
even if I don't infer that you are like

113
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.440
me. So there's always going to be this tension,

114
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.589
and when you simulate these, um, um, ensembles or

115
00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:16.609
populations of active influence, uh, agents that are all

116
00:07:16.609 --> 00:07:20.959
exchanging ideas or commitments or beliefs or ideologies, then

117
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.480
what tends to happen is that the, uh, only,

118
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.089
you could say, evolutionary steady state or sustainable state

119
00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:31.630
is roughly a fifty-fifty split. So if one group

120
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.700
is too small, it will be basically absorbed into

121
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.540
the other group, but there is a stable solution

122
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:42.179
where one half of the population believes one thing

123
00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:44.579
and the other half of the population believes another.

124
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.170
So they can both be And enjoy mutual predictability

125
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.190
within their own group but also sate their curiosity

126
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.769
by occasionally listening to the other group that I

127
00:07:55.769 --> 00:07:59.250
find a really quite appealing description of exactly where

128
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.739
we find ourselves, whether it's Trump versus Biden, Brexit

129
00:08:02.739 --> 00:08:08.079
versus Remain. Wherever you look, the only stable polarization

130
00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:10.209
is basically a 50/50 split.

131
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.690
Right. By the way, you used at a certain

132
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.959
point, the word narrative there. What does that mean

133
00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:20.959
in the context of the free energy principle?

134
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:26.980
I was just using it basically to describe a

135
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.380
belief about the succession of outcomes in which I

136
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.820
participate. So technically this will be written down in

137
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.700
simulations as a policy. There's a sequence of actions

138
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.830
that each follow each other. And the choice of

139
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.070
those actions depends upon the expected information gain and

140
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.940
the expected value of each of those outcomes given

141
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.099
a particular action at this point in the sequence,

142
00:08:52.349 --> 00:08:55.460
and that combination is the expected free energy. So

143
00:08:55.789 --> 00:09:01.520
we in being authentic agents. We necessarily have to

144
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.679
have a world model or a generative model of

145
00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:07.880
the consequences of our actions to be able to

146
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.830
evaluate the goodness of any given action in terms

147
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.880
of the expected free energy conditioned upon that particular

148
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.520
action. And moreover, it is a sequence of actions.

149
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.359
So that sequence of navigating or stepping through various

150
00:09:22.359 --> 00:09:27.559
scenarios, a tree of consequences, I'm using the word

151
00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:30.869
narrative. It's like a story of my immediate future.

152
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.380
Mhm. So, changing topics, how do you look at

153
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:40.780
the relationship if, if there's any between the free

154
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.669
energy principle and 4E cognition?

155
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.510
I think there's a very, very close relationship. I

156
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:53.140
mean, you could argue that certainly, you know, one

157
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.969
application of the free energy principle, namely active inference,

158
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.229
is quintessentially embodied because it's all about using your

159
00:10:00.229 --> 00:10:04.530
body to act upon the world. So that the,

160
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:09.750
you know, certainly that that embodied and inactivist aspect

161
00:10:10.049 --> 00:10:15.049
is inherent in the mechanics, sometimes referred to as

162
00:10:15.049 --> 00:10:21.700
Bayesian mechanics that underwrites active inference. The extended and

163
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:28.539
embedded nature, I think is also subsumed. When applying

164
00:10:28.539 --> 00:10:30.940
active inference in exactly the way that we're just

165
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.219
discussing, say, to cultural niche construction or just niche

166
00:10:34.219 --> 00:10:38.020
construction generally, that the way that I make sense

167
00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.059
of my world determines how I evaluate the consequences

168
00:10:42.059 --> 00:10:44.380
of my actions and therefore my action upon the

169
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.340
world and the action upon the world changes the

170
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.500
world, which means that my sense making and decision

171
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.700
making actually becomes installed in my world, in my

172
00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.520
environment. So in one sense my cognition, my cognitive

173
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:06.119
processes become extended into the world. Again, I'm appealing

174
00:11:06.119 --> 00:11:08.799
to the writings of people like Andy Clark, you

175
00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:13.280
know, insofar as I can plan to retrieve a

176
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.369
phone number from my iPhone. I don't have to

177
00:11:16.369 --> 00:11:18.969
remember that cognitively, but I do know where it

178
00:11:18.969 --> 00:11:22.530
is because it's now in my environment, so I

179
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.770
have effectively embedded my cognition or it is now

180
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.840
extended into the environment, and again one could apply

181
00:11:30.409 --> 00:11:36.169
loosely similar arguments to the co-constructed environment that comprises

182
00:11:36.169 --> 00:11:40.549
deontic signs for, for example, elephant paths, desire paths,

183
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.770
traffic lights, or signs in general on the roadside.

184
00:11:44.849 --> 00:11:48.989
Mhm. Uh, WOULD the free energy principle also apply

185
00:11:48.989 --> 00:11:54.599
to artificial systems, artificial intelligence, and things like that?

186
00:11:55.349 --> 00:11:58.390
Um, YES, no, it, it could certainly, uh, be,

187
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.690
uh, be applied. I mean, the free energy principle

188
00:12:01.059 --> 00:12:06.059
is just a description, um, of things that have

189
00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:09.789
characteristic states and act in a way to sustain

190
00:12:09.789 --> 00:12:11.969
themselves within those states. So if you can find

191
00:12:11.969 --> 00:12:14.989
anything. That can be labeled semantically or you can

192
00:12:14.989 --> 00:12:18.640
individuate from its environment, then you are licensed to

193
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.039
apply the free energy principle to it, including a

194
00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:24.840
computer, including a robot, and including any artifact, you

195
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.570
could actually apply the free energy principle to a

196
00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:31.159
thermostat. Um, THE question would that have uh artificial

197
00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:36.859
intelligence of the kind that one would, um, Anticipate

198
00:12:36.859 --> 00:12:39.609
seeing in, you know, something like you and me

199
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.539
at the moment I think not, although there are

200
00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:44.500
lots of arguments about large language models at the

201
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.020
moment precisely, you know, do they share the same

202
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.979
narrative that we share? Do they have the same

203
00:12:49.979 --> 00:12:53.460
kind of understanding that, that, that, that, that, that

204
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.479
we have? But you can certainly apply the free

205
00:12:55.479 --> 00:12:59.380
energy principle to a large language model, um, and

206
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.409
indeed, um, the whole. The point of large language

207
00:13:03.409 --> 00:13:07.169
models is that they not only use prediction to

208
00:13:07.169 --> 00:13:11.090
generate the next word, but also they are very

209
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.729
predictable in the sense that they recapitulate things that

210
00:13:14.729 --> 00:13:20.049
we've spoken or written or draw, drawn previously. So

211
00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:22.130
yeah, I, I certainly think you can apply the

212
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.650
free entry principle to any artifact, natural or artificial.

213
00:13:26.919 --> 00:13:30.349
Is that, does that mean that all of these

214
00:13:30.349 --> 00:13:36.590
things engage, um, Intelligently in active inference, and I

215
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.830
think that would really depend upon how you define

216
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:45.239
active inference. If you're, um, defining active influence in

217
00:13:45.239 --> 00:13:50.559
its full sense of engaging agency through a minimization

218
00:13:50.559 --> 00:13:53.960
of expected free energy, then I'd say no. You,

219
00:13:54.239 --> 00:13:56.359
you, there are only a certain number of things

220
00:13:56.359 --> 00:14:00.450
that, that have that kind of authentic agency, um,

221
00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:05.950
and thereby have that kind of intelligent behavior. Um,

222
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:12.270
SO put that very simply, if your artifact. Plans,

223
00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:15.729
then I would say that it has the kind

224
00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:19.179
of intelligence that you would get with, uh, what

225
00:14:19.179 --> 00:14:21.580
some people record to, well, what some people refer

226
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.299
to as not merely reflexive active inference of the

227
00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:27.900
kind you might find in a thermostat or a

228
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.929
Watts governor. So. You, if you're asking, can you

229
00:14:32.929 --> 00:14:36.969
use the free energy principle to build truly intelligent

230
00:14:36.969 --> 00:14:41.919
or authentically intelligent embodied artifacts, yes, you can, but

231
00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:47.830
you'd have to equip these artifacts with a generative

232
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.570
model of the consequences of their action. And in

233
00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.289
so doing, they'd have to have the capacity to

234
00:14:54.289 --> 00:14:57.289
act. They'd have to have the capacity to ask

235
00:14:57.289 --> 00:15:03.059
questions, to move. To select data of their own

236
00:15:03.059 --> 00:15:07.479
choice as opposed to you providing the data. Is

237
00:15:07.479 --> 00:15:09.190
that what you were chasing?

238
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.109
Yes, it was. So moving now a little bit

239
00:15:13.109 --> 00:15:16.599
to a few questions that are more related to

240
00:15:16.599 --> 00:15:20.960
physics. Does the free energy principle relate in any

241
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.239
way? And if so, how to quantum mechanics and

242
00:15:25.239 --> 00:15:26.640
general relativity?

243
00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.780
Yes, um, in some interesting ways. Um, SO, A

244
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.460
The broad answer to your question is that the

245
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:44.090
free energy principle. Inherits exactly from the same physics

246
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:50.570
that underlies quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and classical mechanics

247
00:15:50.809 --> 00:15:55.900
that would include, um, general relativity. Um, In the

248
00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.409
sense that the Bay mechanics that defines the free

249
00:16:00.409 --> 00:16:05.270
energy principle follows exactly the same mathematics and laws

250
00:16:05.619 --> 00:16:08.419
that are found in the other kinds of mechanics

251
00:16:08.419 --> 00:16:12.349
such as quantum mechanics, statistical, or more specifically stochastic

252
00:16:12.349 --> 00:16:17.070
mechanics and Lagrangian or classical mechanics. So, um, there's

253
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.669
a, a, a, a deep connection between the free

254
00:16:20.669 --> 00:16:24.400
energy principle and its emergence in these other kinds

255
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.239
of mechanics, for example, you know, the, um, in

256
00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:31.830
thermodynamics, you could, um, argue that this is, um,

257
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:36.320
the homologue of, uh, the minimization of Helmholz free

258
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.599
energy. In information theory, there's a much closer relationship

259
00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:46.929
between the free energy principle and Jane's maximum entropy

260
00:16:46.929 --> 00:16:51.130
or path entropy principle, also known as the maxent

261
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.849
or max cal. The distinction is a bit subtle

262
00:16:53.849 --> 00:16:57.969
but relatively simple in the sense that the max

263
00:16:57.969 --> 00:17:03.169
caliber principle applies to paths, mathematical narratives, as you

264
00:17:03.169 --> 00:17:06.009
roll out into the future or Uh, uh, or

265
00:17:06.009 --> 00:17:09.249
back into the past. Um, SO that's a deep

266
00:17:09.249 --> 00:17:13.088
connection. In terms of specifically quantum, uh, mechanics and,

267
00:17:13.188 --> 00:17:16.948
and, and relativity, um, if you apply the free

268
00:17:16.948 --> 00:17:22.469
energy principle, um, There, although you can apply it

269
00:17:22.469 --> 00:17:25.800
in a scale-free way, there is a certain scale

270
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:31.020
dependence, which basically means that the balance between the

271
00:17:31.589 --> 00:17:39.530
deterministic predictable behavior and the more random stochastic dissipative

272
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.589
kind of behavior that one sees in systems changes

273
00:17:42.589 --> 00:17:46.310
as the scale increases. So one way of looking

274
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.520
at that would be to think about, um, Your

275
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.489
dynamics of any system. Being comprised of two parts.

276
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.189
One part would be a deterministic evolution of flow.

277
00:17:59.489 --> 00:18:02.250
So mathematically if I'm at one point in some

278
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.920
phase space, then the flow determined by some, say,

279
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.410
vector field at that point will take me to

280
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.729
another point in state space and then to another

281
00:18:11.729 --> 00:18:14.239
point and then to another point. And again this

282
00:18:14.239 --> 00:18:16.369
is what I mean by a narrative, it's just

283
00:18:16.369 --> 00:18:20.790
a sequence of being in different states. Um, BUT

284
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.349
that, um, that flow is also subject to random

285
00:18:24.349 --> 00:18:28.670
fluctuations. So there's two parts to my flow. There's

286
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.949
a dissipated part which is due to the random

287
00:18:30.949 --> 00:18:35.719
fluctuations, and there's a non-dissipative part, sometimes called a

288
00:18:35.719 --> 00:18:39.689
solenoidal part to the flow. Which, uh, usually, because

289
00:18:39.689 --> 00:18:42.040
I have to keep on returning to my characteristic

290
00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:46.239
states goes around in circles. It's, um, referred to,

291
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.819
uh, well, that is one perspective on why it's

292
00:18:48.819 --> 00:18:53.869
called solenoidal flow. Now Think about the different contributions

293
00:18:53.869 --> 00:18:57.260
of this dissipative and non-disipative or divergence free or

294
00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.270
solenoidal flow as we move from very small things

295
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.540
to very big things for very, very small things,

296
00:19:03.739 --> 00:19:08.430
the random fluctuations dominate. So everything is fluctuating very

297
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:14.270
fast, very, very with a high amplitude randomness of

298
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.989
fluctuations, and that's the world of the microscopic, that's

299
00:19:17.989 --> 00:19:22.560
the world of the quantum scale. So everything. Disappears

300
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:28.150
before you can measure it. Everything disappears or dissipates

301
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.270
before you can observe it, so you can only

302
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.829
describe things in terms of probability distributions or wave

303
00:19:34.829 --> 00:19:40.819
functions in quantum physics. Um, ONCE you appreciate, you

304
00:19:40.819 --> 00:19:44.579
can only describe things in terms of wave functions,

305
00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:46.459
and you just think about the structure and the

306
00:19:46.459 --> 00:19:49.969
nature of these wave functions. For example, having, uh,

307
00:19:50.099 --> 00:19:53.300
putting a wave of a certain wavelength around a

308
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.425
ring, you suddenly realize that you can only. Either

309
00:19:56.425 --> 00:19:59.175
3 of these or 4 of these wavelengths into

310
00:19:59.175 --> 00:20:02.214
this ring, uh, and therefore you get this quantum,

311
00:20:02.415 --> 00:20:05.814
uh, quantum aspect that just comes from the fact

312
00:20:05.814 --> 00:20:09.854
you have to describe things probabilistically simply because, uh,

313
00:20:09.974 --> 00:20:12.265
they're not observable. But as you get bigger and

314
00:20:12.265 --> 00:20:16.890
bigger and bigger, The random fluctuations average themselves away.

315
00:20:17.569 --> 00:20:19.540
And they get smaller and smaller and smaller and

316
00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.380
smaller until when you get very, very big, say

317
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.930
the size of the moon, there are almost no

318
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:29.989
random fluctuations and all the behavior is solenoidal. So

319
00:20:29.989 --> 00:20:33.020
you now have a picture of classical mechanics or

320
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:38.040
grangian mechanics in which you have the circulation of

321
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.670
the heavenly bodies around each other. So you've still

322
00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:45.189
got, you know, the same mathematics, but the balance

323
00:20:45.189 --> 00:20:48.869
of the dissipative and non-dissipative part has has changed

324
00:20:48.869 --> 00:20:53.140
profoundly. Now in the middle. Things of your size

325
00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.089
beyond, say, single molecules or indeed single cells, but

326
00:20:57.089 --> 00:21:02.170
multicellular organization that is sufficiently large. Then you've got

327
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.400
both things in play. You've got your, you now

328
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:11.410
yourself trying to maintain yourself within this attracting set

329
00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:16.300
by the solenoidal actively keeping on this attracting set

330
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.329
through active inference through the self evidencing or Baying

331
00:21:19.329 --> 00:21:24.729
mechanics and resisting the random fluctuations in an environment

332
00:21:24.729 --> 00:21:29.140
that can sometimes be quite, quite chaotic and random.

333
00:21:29.569 --> 00:21:32.369
So we're not like the moon, but we're also

334
00:21:32.369 --> 00:21:35.859
not like, um, uh, particles below the, you know,

335
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:40.449
the, the quantum scale. So, can you apply quantum,

336
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:46.729
um, quantum mechanics, um, or can you, um, apply

337
00:21:46.729 --> 00:21:49.569
the free energy to quantum mechanics? No. Quantum mechanics

338
00:21:49.569 --> 00:21:52.530
is quantum mechanics, free energy principle is Bay mechanics.

339
00:21:52.689 --> 00:21:54.810
They both can be cast as principles of least

340
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:58.130
action. Uh, THEY both inherit from, uh, the work

341
00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.849
of Richard Feynman in, in the sense that they're

342
00:22:00.849 --> 00:22:04.170
both, uh, can be characterized in terms of variation

343
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.089
free energy, but they're talking about different things. Um,

344
00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:13.150
Can you apply quantum information theory? I think you

345
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.310
can, and there's been a lot of work done

346
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:20.579
by my friend and colleague Chris Fields attempting to

347
00:22:20.949 --> 00:22:27.750
apply the holographic principle to translate or to frame

348
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.270
the free energy principle as as the principle of

349
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:36.989
unitarity by effectively treating. What the free energy principle

350
00:22:36.989 --> 00:22:39.219
would regard as a mark of blanket, which is

351
00:22:39.219 --> 00:22:42.589
the set of states that separate me from the

352
00:22:42.589 --> 00:22:46.380
rest of my world, effectively my inputs and outputs

353
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.500
by which I exchange with the world, otherwise known

354
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.050
as sensory and active states. But if we just

355
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.390
lump the sensory and active states together, that provides

356
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.310
a set of inputs and outputs across which I

357
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.719
am open to my world. If you replace that

358
00:23:03.719 --> 00:23:06.719
with something called the holographic screen, then you can

359
00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:10.160
use the argument, the holographic principle, that everything you

360
00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.189
need to know or everything that is knowable about

361
00:23:12.189 --> 00:23:17.040
the internal bulk, say my brain is expressed on

362
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.800
the Markov blanket. It is expressed via my sensory

363
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.239
impressions, but also crucially my action upon upon the

364
00:23:24.239 --> 00:23:28.280
world. So he's developed a very beautiful calculus and

365
00:23:28.619 --> 00:23:33.430
Um, applies category theoretic, uh, arguments and, um, uh,

366
00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:37.739
can derive lots of, um, quite, um, engaging conclusions

367
00:23:38.339 --> 00:23:41.579
from this quantum information theoretic formulation, the free energy

368
00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:44.660
principle. So there, there is a, I think, a

369
00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.619
deep connection between quantum information theory and the free

370
00:23:47.619 --> 00:23:52.599
energy principle. But there's a, uh, despite the common

371
00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:56.729
roots, there is a fundamental distinction between quantum mechanics

372
00:23:56.729 --> 00:23:59.959
and, and Bayesian mechanics. In terms of, uh, uh,

373
00:23:59.969 --> 00:24:05.400
general relativity, with respect to general relativity, um, I,

374
00:24:05.479 --> 00:24:09.079
I personally haven't dealt with that very deeply, but

375
00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:15.199
there is an interesting limiting case of very big

376
00:24:15.199 --> 00:24:21.119
things under this Markov blanket partition that defines things

377
00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:25.959
or particles and the states of particles in which

378
00:24:25.959 --> 00:24:34.680
if you associate Sensory and active states with velocity

379
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:39.040
and position respectively, you can now derive classical mechanics

380
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:45.750
or Lagrangian mechanics around certain probability distributions that define

381
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:50.150
the characteristic states of these systems expressed in terms

382
00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:54.239
of their blanket states, namely their position and velocity.

383
00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:58.810
And then you can derive classical mechanics and also

384
00:24:59.619 --> 00:25:03.420
with an adjustment to the definition of the attracting

385
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.420
sets, one can then just borrow the equations from

386
00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.979
general relativity and express it as the same kind

387
00:25:08.979 --> 00:25:09.780
of mechanics.

388
00:25:11.199 --> 00:25:15.300
Mhm. And I, I mean, sort of related to

389
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.140
physics as well, do you think that free energy

390
00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.229
itself can be a theory of everything?

391
00:25:23.489 --> 00:25:27.160
Um, YES, um, but with a twist, so it's

392
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:33.349
a theory of every space thing. Um, SO the

393
00:25:33.349 --> 00:25:40.630
free energy principle rests upon the individuation or separation

394
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:45.130
of a subsystem, a particle, a person or population

395
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:52.569
from everything else. So If one induces this separation

396
00:25:52.569 --> 00:25:56.550
statistically in the form of a Markov blanket. That

397
00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:00.839
itself inherits from sparse coupling among states of any

398
00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:05.640
given universe, then you now have a definition of

399
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:10.739
thinness. And with that definition you can now say

400
00:26:10.739 --> 00:26:15.489
should that thing persist and have for a non-trivial

401
00:26:15.489 --> 00:26:18.979
amount of time characteristic states to which it is

402
00:26:18.979 --> 00:26:23.219
confined, technically a pullback a tractor, and then you

403
00:26:23.219 --> 00:26:26.180
can apply the free energy principle. So if you

404
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.010
start a repeat from the definition of a thing,

405
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.939
then the free energy principle is a principle of

406
00:26:32.939 --> 00:26:35.829
everything that exists. So

407
00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.770
and is free energy fundamental in the metaphysical sense?

408
00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.229
Um, THAT'S an interesting question, um. From the point

409
00:26:51.229 --> 00:26:58.859
of view of the information theory, um, you could

410
00:26:58.859 --> 00:27:03.369
argue it's not, um, in the sense that, um,

411
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.660
if one just. Turns to its instantiation in the

412
00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:13.650
work of Richard Feynman as a bound on the

413
00:27:13.939 --> 00:27:17.540
what's called self-information or the negative log probability of

414
00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.739
a path or being in a particular state and

415
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.900
at any instant in time then because it's a

416
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.339
bound, it is not in and of itself the

417
00:27:28.339 --> 00:27:32.849
metaphysical self-information or the, or the probability. Um, AND

418
00:27:32.849 --> 00:27:35.910
you could even argue that the probability of something

419
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:39.640
being in some state, uh, is itself not metaphysically

420
00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.869
real. It's just a probabilistic description. However, I would

421
00:27:42.869 --> 00:27:44.670
not argue that. I would argue that all of

422
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:48.060
physics, all of reality, is just an expression of

423
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:51.949
the, um, the dynamics of probability densities from quantum

424
00:27:51.949 --> 00:27:54.599
mechanics through to the way that we infer our,

425
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:58.069
our, you know, infer our world, uh, through the

426
00:27:58.069 --> 00:28:01.260
application of the, of the free energy principle. Um.

427
00:28:02.439 --> 00:28:06.010
So you could argue, I think, that, that free

428
00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.569
energy in the sense of the free energy principle

429
00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:14.219
that we're talking about here, um, is not metaphysically

430
00:28:14.949 --> 00:28:18.089
real. Could you make the same arguments for thermodynamic,

431
00:28:18.459 --> 00:28:21.780
free energy? Um, I, I think you probably could

432
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.349
actually, uh, in the sense that, you know, these

433
00:28:24.349 --> 00:28:28.349
things depend upon ensemble averages and the probability distributions.

434
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:32.150
This is where they come from, um. So, um,

435
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.410
you know, is a probability that, you know, uh,

436
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.930
real in a metaphysical sense, um, in the sense

437
00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.709
that does it have to be, if you like,

438
00:28:43.939 --> 00:28:50.540
um, encoded by an observer. So, This brings you

439
00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.099
to the other perspective that if you want a

440
00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:58.660
way of describing something observing something that is metaphysically

441
00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:02.500
real, then yes, the free energy could be construed

442
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:07.540
as, um, depending, um, on a metaphysical reality in

443
00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.260
the sense that you are observing it. So this

444
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.500
speaks to, um, something that we started off by

445
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:19.260
talking, uh, uh, talking about, but. It, it depends,

446
00:29:19.319 --> 00:29:24.910
um, it rests upon a commitment to reality as

447
00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:29.310
observed, as, as measured, as inferred. So this is

448
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.390
very close to sort of the relational formulation of

449
00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:36.630
quantum mechanics, for example. It's all about the observation,

450
00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:41.670
um, and certainly as people like, um, Carlo Rovelli

451
00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:45.520
would, you know, would argue, um. A lot of

452
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:49.500
the paradoxes of quantum mechanics just dissolve when you

453
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.750
realize that the measurement is the thing itself, so

454
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:57.819
you can't talk about Bob and Alice looking at

455
00:29:57.819 --> 00:30:01.380
something because, well, you can, but you have to

456
00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.979
now realize there are now 3 things in the

457
00:30:03.979 --> 00:30:07.739
game, and whatever Bob and Alice think about their

458
00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:11.030
observations, it cannot be assumed to be the same

459
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:15.699
thing. So I think that the um The, the

460
00:30:15.699 --> 00:30:18.209
answer to your question is that the free energy,

461
00:30:18.739 --> 00:30:23.489
uh, as a functional of a probability distribution is

462
00:30:23.489 --> 00:30:26.930
in and of itself not a metaphysically real thing,

463
00:30:27.219 --> 00:30:31.290
but it only exists when there is some observer

464
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.810
of some metaphysical reality. Mhm.

465
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:39.589
So, I have just one last question then, can

466
00:30:39.589 --> 00:30:43.550
we get a new understanding of death through a

467
00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.260
free energy framework?

468
00:30:46.199 --> 00:30:52.229
Of death. Yes. That's a very morbid question. And

469
00:30:52.229 --> 00:30:54.369
you nearly asked it with a straight face as

470
00:30:54.369 --> 00:30:59.239
well, right? Yes, yes, certainly you can. Uh, um,

471
00:30:59.489 --> 00:31:02.569
AND it's a, it's a rather, um, um, trivial

472
00:31:02.569 --> 00:31:04.329
answer, but perhaps it will make it more interesting

473
00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:09.170
by referring to mortal computation. Um, SO, um, on

474
00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.439
the point of view, the free energy principle, um,

475
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.290
Is the dissolution or the loss of your Markov

476
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:21.699
blanket, uh, that necessarily implies a um uh a

477
00:31:21.699 --> 00:31:28.439
loss of the, um, Attracting set that confines the

478
00:31:28.439 --> 00:31:33.239
way that you move around your state space, which

479
00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:38.760
means that you will dissipate. So death mathematically in

480
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.270
this instance can be described in lots of D

481
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:46.939
words so that you, you will decay. You would,

482
00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:51.329
uh, desiccate if you were dry, you would dissipate,

483
00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:54.849
you would dissolve. All of these things are descriptions

484
00:31:54.849 --> 00:31:58.890
of a loss or collapse of your attracting set

485
00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:02.010
and inherently your Markov blanket. So if your attracting

486
00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:06.640
set goes away, your self-information or your, um, your,

487
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:11.680
um, Surprisal that defines the kinds of states that

488
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.599
you occupy your characteristic states no longer exists. You

489
00:32:15.599 --> 00:32:18.670
lose your Markov blanket. There is no difference between

490
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.319
you and the rest of the universe, and you

491
00:32:21.319 --> 00:32:26.699
diffuse, decay. Dissipate, dissolve into the universe. So, um,

492
00:32:27.489 --> 00:32:30.050
and the characteristic, you know, if you do retain

493
00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.680
your Markov blanket for a short period of time,

494
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:37.150
um, then that attractive set will now collapse to

495
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:40.339
a single point. And now, and that's interesting from

496
00:32:40.339 --> 00:32:43.209
a physics perspective because when you collapse to a

497
00:32:43.209 --> 00:32:47.290
single point, then you're now moving from the physics

498
00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:53.229
of, uh, non-equilibrium steady states. To equilibrium steady states

499
00:32:53.229 --> 00:32:57.079
and now the second law applies and classical physics

500
00:32:57.079 --> 00:33:01.400
applies, but only when you are converging to a

501
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.239
pointer tractor and normally, well, you may not be

502
00:33:05.239 --> 00:33:08.040
dead, but you would be, you may be petrified

503
00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.765
in the sense. Be turned into stone. So if

504
00:33:10.765 --> 00:33:13.415
you were a stone, you have a pointer tractor.

505
00:33:13.564 --> 00:33:16.484
So you, you, you, you, you, um, uh, you

506
00:33:16.484 --> 00:33:20.244
don't have this solenoid or circular itineracy to your

507
00:33:20.244 --> 00:33:24.444
dynamics, you just keep returning to the, this, this,

508
00:33:24.765 --> 00:33:30.599
this same point, um. So On that view, death

509
00:33:30.599 --> 00:33:36.280
is exactly what is meant by um Um things

510
00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.630
that exist avoid death in the sense that things

511
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:44.109
that exist have this sustainable attracting set for a

512
00:33:44.109 --> 00:33:47.150
non-trivial amount of time, and after that non-trivial amount

513
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:50.069
of time they die because that set no longer

514
00:33:50.069 --> 00:33:56.390
exists because they, because they are now drawn away

515
00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:00.750
from or fail to maintain the occupancy of that

516
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:04.260
attracting set or pull back a tractor. More entertainingly,

517
00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.050
I think you can talk about mortal computation. So,

518
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.500
um, I could also ask you, um, well, I

519
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:14.340
could answer your question, um, what is death? Uh,

520
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.219
WELL, death is an attribute of things that are

521
00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:20.260
mortal. What kinds of things are we talking about,

522
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.889
of interest? Well, we're talking about things that infer,

523
00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:28.070
measure, observe, and compute. So we are talking about

524
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.399
things in the real world that are mortal computers.

525
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:36.179
So what's an immortal computer? Well, immortal software, according

526
00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:39.590
to, um, people like Geoffrey Hinton, is software that

527
00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:44.100
can be run on any substrate, uh, on any

528
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.039
machine. So the software itself. It is immortal in

529
00:34:48.039 --> 00:34:51.780
the sense that it cannot die. So that means

530
00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:56.219
that introduces the interesting question, can you ever have

531
00:34:56.219 --> 00:35:00.929
immortal software, or are we examples of immortal software?

532
00:35:01.129 --> 00:35:04.330
And I think most people, certainly the 4E perspective,

533
00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.459
the embodied perspective, would say absolutely not. No, the

534
00:35:07.459 --> 00:35:11.715
whole point is that are mortal computers. We are

535
00:35:11.715 --> 00:35:15.225
an instance of mortal computation as an inference process,

536
00:35:15.475 --> 00:35:20.304
and that inference process actually depends and is installed

537
00:35:20.675 --> 00:35:23.955
in the very physiology and the physics and the

538
00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:26.074
material of our embodied brain.

539
00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:31.399
Great. So I think we've covered a lot of

540
00:35:31.399 --> 00:35:34.520
ground in our two interviews, Doctor Freston. So just

541
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.879
before we go now, would you like to tell

542
00:35:36.879 --> 00:35:39.760
people again where they can find you and your

543
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.010
work on the internet?

544
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:44.770
I think you asked me that last time and

545
00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.250
I think I said no, no, no, I'm trying

546
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:50.629
to be a recluse, so I'm very happy to

547
00:35:50.629 --> 00:35:52.159
talk to you and I enjoyed talking to you,

548
00:35:52.929 --> 00:35:55.169
but otherwise I'm, I'm trying to, I try to

549
00:35:55.169 --> 00:35:57.959
avoid exposure, but thank you for the invitation anyway.

550
00:35:58.649 --> 00:36:02.270
OK, thank you so much. Hi guys, thank you
