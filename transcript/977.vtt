00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:05.699
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.680
joined by Doctor Susan Charles. She is Professor of

4
00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.560
Psychological Science and Nursing Science in the School of

5
00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:15.310
Social Ecology at the University of California Irvine. Her

6
00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:20.309
research examines emotional processes across the adult lifespan. And

7
00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:23.620
today we're going to talk about effective well-being emotional

8
00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:28.579
function across the lifespan, emotion regulation, social relationships and

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.670
some other related topics. So, Doctor Charles, welcome to

10
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.330
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:35.459
Well, thank you. Thank you for inviting me.

12
00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:40.270
So let's start perhaps with um a definition here.

13
00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:43.319
So when it comes to effective well being, what

14
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.909
are we talking about here

15
00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:48.150
exactly? Um Yes, effective well being is a, is

16
00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.430
a term researchers use. Um AND, and people in

17
00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:55.349
the community and, and society really don't accept, we

18
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.400
use it every day. So you know how you,

19
00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.340
you meet someone and you say, how are you?

20
00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:04.050
Um AND, and when someone asks you, how are

21
00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.430
you doing? You, you kind of think to yourself,

22
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.940
how am I doing overall? Am I good? Am

23
00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:11.110
I bad? And so you'll say, you know, I'm

24
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.629
doing well or I'm not. And that is your

25
00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:16.989
effective well being. It's basically how positive you are

26
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.540
or how negative and, and the way we measure

27
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.199
this as um in our research is by asking

28
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.120
discreet emotions, like how happy, how, how content, how

29
00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:30.669
calm and then we look at the average and

30
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.720
that's your overall like positivity. And so whether it's

31
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.750
low or high, and then we also do the

32
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.139
same thing for negative, you know how angry, how

33
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.779
sad, like uh a host of different negative emotions

34
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.180
and then we average those together and we look

35
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.540
at your positive, overall positive bucket compared to your

36
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.830
negative bucket and that's your overall well being.

37
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.849
Yeah, I I mean, isn't there a small risk

38
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.330
of people just sometimes lying about their own effective?

39
00:01:58.339 --> 00:02:01.290
Well, because I mean, when we ask one another,

40
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.790
how are, how are you doing? We, we usually

41
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.540
say well fine but sometimes

42
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.654
that's not. Yeah, you're right. Maybe that's a bad

43
00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:13.054
example because the society we just, we just default

44
00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:16.654
to fine. Um, BUT um it is true and

45
00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:20.884
sometimes we have social desirability, right? So, so you

46
00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:24.024
don't wanna look bad and um, and some people

47
00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:26.455
have even wondered, does that change with age? So

48
00:02:26.634 --> 00:02:29.104
are you trying to, you know, to look more

49
00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.964
socially desirable, look good at different stages in your

50
00:02:31.975 --> 00:02:33.975
life? More or less

51
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.750
and, and talking about how things change across the

52
00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:43.210
lifespan? How does emotional function change? Exactly.

53
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.210
Yeah. It's really um interesting because emotions when we

54
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.440
think of what emotions are and they're obviously cognitive

55
00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.759
processes because it involves thinking like, how do I

56
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.770
feel and their behavioral processes of responding to an

57
00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:00.899
emotional event, like fight or flight. Um And when

58
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.539
we think about our thoughts and we think about

59
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.660
physical fitness and you think about aging, you think,

60
00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.470
you know, as I tell my students, there are

61
00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.500
very few Olympians who are you who are old,

62
00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:16.220
you know, so, so clearly all these, these physical

63
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:19.919
and cognitive processes decline with age. Um, AND that's

64
00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:24.550
pretty, pretty normative. Um, BUT emotions actually look pretty,

65
00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.309
pretty well preserved across the lifespan. And we, and

66
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.960
when we ask people, how are you or how

67
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.190
has your life been like in the past month,

68
00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:37.500
generally older adults report similar, if not higher levels

69
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:40.710
of well being than younger. Definitely, if I would

70
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.240
take the average well being of a 60 year

71
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.089
old over a 20 year old any day because

72
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.500
it is higher. So, um, they're generally less negative

73
00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:53.119
like they're, they're less um angry or distressed, um,

74
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.449
than younger people.

75
00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:58.119
Well, then actually in this particular case, at least

76
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.630
the that common stereotype that older people tend to

77
00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.720
experience more positive emotion seems to be correct.

78
00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.880
Yeah. You know, it's, it's interesting, some oftentimes stereotypes

79
00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.190
are either really positive or really negative. So you'll

80
00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.289
have like the grumpy old man kind of uh

81
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.450
trope or you'll have, you know, the old witch

82
00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.510
or you'll have like the benign, like loving grandma.

83
00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.809
But um the truth is more of the kind

84
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.100
of benign look. Um WHICH is, which is great

85
00:04:28.109 --> 00:04:30.940
because we tell young people, um these are the

86
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.559
best moments of your life and when we think

87
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.970
of mental health today and especially after the pandemic

88
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.309
of younger adults, I think it's kind of a

89
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.690
child abuse type thing if we ask like, if

90
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.250
we tell a 19 year old, you know, this

91
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.040
is the happiest you're gonna get, you know, that

92
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.570
they might think this is it, you know, which

93
00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:48.390
is and it isn't. I mean, from all the

94
00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:52.429
data we've seen um the older you, you get,

95
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.910
well, definitely like the happiest people sometimes are in

96
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.450
their late sixties and early seventies. So interesting.

97
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.769
But, but middle aged people, I mean, middle age

98
00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.609
seems to be a bit scary. I, I mean,

99
00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:09.510
I haven't got there yet. I mean, looking at

100
00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:12.500
many middle aged people out there, it seems to

101
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.670
be a very uh I mean, uh a a

102
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.109
stage in life where people really go down in

103
00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:23.420
terms of their uh emotions and stuff like that.

104
00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:26.190
You know, it's really interesting because there's a, a

105
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.829
question um how satisfied are you with your life

106
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.160
unless, and we often see this kind of u

107
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.940
shaped curve where it's highest in the younger and

108
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.750
the middle age, but in the in midlife it

109
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.720
gets lower and, and so it kind of, and

110
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.130
even longitudinally, you'll see people go down and then

111
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.149
go up again and, and people have done a

112
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.010
lot of research to kind of reason why um

113
00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:54.410
life satisfaction is more cognitive, like how is my

114
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.429
life going? Um And they used to think it

115
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.320
had to do with like when you got married,

116
00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:01.859
you're happier and then you go down and then

117
00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:03.709
you, and then the kids, if you have Children,

118
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.579
they leave the house, then you go up. But

119
00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.630
it, but since then these, these data have been

120
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.940
replicated with people who are not married and you

121
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.929
see the same kind of dip and then the

122
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.339
move up. And so, I mean, there's a lot,

123
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.019
we we don't have a definitive answer, but there's

124
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:25.609
a lot of um speculation and for example, there's

125
00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:29.140
a little mortality kind of blip in the fifties.

126
00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:31.480
You see cardio, you know, like a lot of

127
00:06:31.489 --> 00:06:34.739
um cardio vascular like death, like a lot of

128
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.049
heart attacks. I mean a lot. But you, so

129
00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:40.769
especially among men, like with everyone's been healthy and

130
00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:42.589
then all of a sudden like one person in

131
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.369
your friendship, you know, network dies about like a

132
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.230
heart attack as opposed to an accident. And then

133
00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:50.859
you start realizing, oh people are dying for health

134
00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:53.640
related reasons to join my age group. And so

135
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.239
that, that also triggers kind of mortality. Um So

136
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.119
there's a lot of speculation about why that happens.

137
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.709
But it, it we do see that too.

138
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.750
Yeah. May maybe they think, oh my God, perhaps

139
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.720
I don't have 30 or 40 more years ahead

140
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.260
of me.

141
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.250
Yeah. Yeah.

142
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.190
Uh OK. So uh since you mentioned this is

143
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.630
actually I wanted to ask you, do we know

144
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.910
what are the specific biological changes that across the

145
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.989
lifespan affect emotional processes?

146
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.359
So um it, it's interesting about brain like what

147
00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:37.200
changes in the brain that would affect emotion, emotional

148
00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:41.500
processes. So, um people have, have done studies looking

149
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.730
at um about the brain structure and changes. So

150
00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:48.829
for example, what changes first in the brain with

151
00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:51.209
age is the frontal lobes and the ones that

152
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.920
are important for processing information and judgment, decision making.

153
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.670
Um AND, and very important for emotion. So if

154
00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:01.549
we think, oh, that's the first thing that declines

155
00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:05.750
with age, that sounds pretty scary. But what researchers

156
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.359
have found is that um perhaps this slower reaction

157
00:08:11.369 --> 00:08:14.829
time that we see with aging could benefit emotions.

158
00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:18.320
I mean, if you think about it, when we

159
00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:21.290
say something we regret or say something out of

160
00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:24.440
anger oftentimes it's we do this quickly. And so

161
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.010
maybe this, this the kind of slowing actually helps

162
00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:33.880
um emotional regulation. Um That's one hypothesis. Um And

163
00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.080
of course, I do have to say that other

164
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.200
people have looked at older adults and the people

165
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.929
who have the highest function are are doing are

166
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.369
remembering the more positive emotions relative to negative emotions.

167
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.179
And there are age related um, diseases like dementia

168
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.599
where we see higher rates of depression. So it's

169
00:08:51.609 --> 00:08:53.239
not, oh, you get worse and you get better.

170
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.390
That's I'm not saying that, but I'm just saying

171
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.200
kind of slowing down and taking things into perspective

172
00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:02.630
might also have a kind of biological basis. Mhm.

173
00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:06.369
So another thing that we have emotion related is

174
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.520
emotion regulation does that also increase with age, I

175
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.900
mean, not only perhaps the kinds of emotions we

176
00:09:14.909 --> 00:09:19.289
experience more positive or more negative, but also uh

177
00:09:19.299 --> 00:09:23.650
our ability to regulate our emotions.

178
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.099
Now this is a really good question because as

179
00:09:26.109 --> 00:09:27.929
I said, you know, we ask older adults how

180
00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.270
they're doing and they, they often seem similar or

181
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.239
if not better with age and, and yet we

182
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.510
do know that older, that more losses in life

183
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.440
are associated with older age, that people lose status

184
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:44.330
with retirement or financial, you know, their wealth. I

185
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.919
mean, when they retire, they don't make as much

186
00:09:45.929 --> 00:09:49.520
money that, that friends, you know, you, you lose

187
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:53.140
friends through illness. And so um why is it

188
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.619
so they must be regulating their emotions better? But

189
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.320
when we, we put older and younger people in

190
00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.489
the lab and we make them regulate their emotions.

191
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.280
So we get them really upset or sad or

192
00:10:03.289 --> 00:10:05.900
angry or disgusted and we see how quickly it

193
00:10:05.909 --> 00:10:09.580
takes them to get back to baseline. It, that's

194
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.679
not where we see the age related benefit. So

195
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.799
that looks, we see very few, actually, age differences,

196
00:10:15.809 --> 00:10:19.690
people look pretty similar where we see older people,

197
00:10:20.859 --> 00:10:25.419
right? Engage in processes that we think do help

198
00:10:25.469 --> 00:10:28.719
daily life is that older adults are less what

199
00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:31.260
we're finding in our research, they're less likely to

200
00:10:32.119 --> 00:10:35.429
place themselves in situations that can turn negative. And

201
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.679
by, let me give you an example. So if

202
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.640
a younger and older person both love a favorite

203
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.690
restaurant and it's in L A and the traffic

204
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.969
is horrific. Um, AND road rage is something that

205
00:10:48.979 --> 00:10:51.659
both younger and older people that everyone uniformly says

206
00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:55.890
is unpleasant. Um, OLDER people might say, you know

207
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.039
what? I really love that restaurant, but I'm gonna

208
00:10:58.049 --> 00:11:00.919
go on Saturday or I, I'm gonna eat very

209
00:11:00.929 --> 00:11:03.830
early or, or later than the lunch crowd. And

210
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.719
so they kind of proactively in structure their lives

211
00:11:08.729 --> 00:11:11.969
so that they don't get into that traffic jam

212
00:11:11.979 --> 00:11:14.280
or they don't find themselves. I, if you're, if

213
00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:17.809
you're talking to somebody and that conversation starts go,

214
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.390
like, starts leaning towards a question that you think,

215
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.250
ah, no, it's going towards politics and we never

216
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.000
get along or it looks like they're gonna start

217
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.289
telling a joke and I always find their jokes

218
00:11:27.299 --> 00:11:31.159
offensive. Older people are more likely to, to just

219
00:11:31.169 --> 00:11:33.960
to walk away or to change the topic. Um,

220
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.650
THEY are less likely to press on with the

221
00:11:35.659 --> 00:11:40.880
conversation that is getting negative. Um, SO, so that's

222
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.260
what we find. So it's not really in a

223
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.380
bad state. It's kind of avoiding it in the

224
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.090
first place.

225
00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:51.590
And so, in what ways do differences in effective

226
00:11:51.599 --> 00:11:57.190
experience relate to things like cognitive and health related

227
00:11:57.219 --> 00:11:58.309
processes.

228
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.559
Uh Yes. So we um have done a lot

229
00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.539
of studies of Dave Almeida at Pennsylvania um at

230
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.549
Penn State. And um and I have collaborated for

231
00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:12.190
over 20 years. Um AND he has a wonderful

232
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.150
day set looking at daily stressors of life. And

233
00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:18.200
so we've looked at age differences and in that,

234
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.469
and we've looked at over time, um how people

235
00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:23.369
respond to stress and how it relates to their

236
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.250
health 10 years later. And what we find is

237
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.049
that on days when you have a stressor and

238
00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:30.109
if you say at the end of the day,

239
00:12:30.119 --> 00:12:33.979
how are you feeling and your emotions really change.

240
00:12:33.989 --> 00:12:35.549
So on days without a stressor, you're like, I'm

241
00:12:35.559 --> 00:12:37.150
ok, but on days you have a stressor, you're

242
00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:40.299
like, oh, that was awful. So the more awful

243
00:12:40.309 --> 00:12:42.669
you know that you, you report the more your

244
00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:46.099
emotions change in response to the stressor um that

245
00:12:46.109 --> 00:12:50.390
increases your likelihood of having um a, a qua

246
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.140
both a physical, a chronic illness, it increases your,

247
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.820
your risk of physical health and it increases your,

248
00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.460
your risk of um either anxiety or depression. So,

249
00:13:00.469 --> 00:13:01.859
uh so mental health as well

250
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.020
and where do these differences in effective experience stem

251
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.679
from? Do they have to do with some sort

252
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:15.299
of individual differences, like personality or some other ways

253
00:13:15.309 --> 00:13:19.125
related to information process, see the way we deal

254
00:13:19.135 --> 00:13:22.775
with our own experiences in life. Uh, WHAT are

255
00:13:22.784 --> 00:13:23.934
they related to?

256
00:13:23.945 --> 00:13:28.155
Ah, so, um, there are, are we think there

257
00:13:28.164 --> 00:13:30.724
are many differences. So it's, it can start with

258
00:13:30.734 --> 00:13:34.695
just temperamental differences. So, uh, we often talk about

259
00:13:34.705 --> 00:13:36.635
temperaments of dogs. For example, this dog has a

260
00:13:36.645 --> 00:13:38.604
different temperament than that dog. So we see this

261
00:13:38.614 --> 00:13:40.554
in animals and we see it in humans too,

262
00:13:40.565 --> 00:13:43.994
with even newborn babies, them some cry easily, some

263
00:13:44.005 --> 00:13:46.739
just sit and are really kind of, you know,

264
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.460
easy, easier to, to um to care for because

265
00:13:51.469 --> 00:13:53.979
they, they don't need as much soothing. And so

266
00:13:53.989 --> 00:13:56.409
we see these differences unfold across the lifespan. Some

267
00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:59.260
people are frightened very easily, other people think it's

268
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:02.940
hilarious. So, um if some new like loud sound

269
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.380
comes into their, into their uh into their arena.

270
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.570
So, so we have these temperamental differences and we

271
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.039
do see um that these personality that unfold into

272
00:14:14.049 --> 00:14:17.450
personality traits over time and we see that personality,

273
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.830
um certain personality traits are related to higher reactivity

274
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.210
to our stressors. And we also, um so from

275
00:14:25.219 --> 00:14:28.739
modeling behavior, so how our parents responded, um can

276
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:33.130
also influence us and um how we're learned to,

277
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.130
to deal with our own emotional experiences and what

278
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.960
scares us or what, what's novel in the stimuli.

279
00:14:39.969 --> 00:14:41.950
Like if you grow up in a place where

280
00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.770
anything new can be potentially very dangerous for you,

281
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.700
then you might have a very different outlook than

282
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.500
someone who is raised in a bit safer environment,

283
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:56.000
for example. So a combination of, of you, what

284
00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.479
you came into the world with and how the

285
00:14:57.489 --> 00:14:58.400
world has shaped you.

286
00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:03.380
And I would imagine of course, that uh earlier,

287
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:07.169
we've talked about, let's say general trends across the

288
00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:12.340
lifespan. But you've also mentioned some opposite stereotypes that

289
00:15:12.349 --> 00:15:14.890
we have for old people, like the grumpy old

290
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.469
man or the carefree old men, let's say, and

291
00:15:18.479 --> 00:15:21.489
I guess that some of that would also be

292
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.650
the result of these individual differences, like personality, temperament

293
00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:27.539
and so on.

294
00:15:27.549 --> 00:15:30.520
Right. Yeah. Uh FOR, for the, you know, the

295
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.659
upturns, um we sometimes see especially after 65 and

296
00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:37.950
some of those upturns in, in emotional distress um

297
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:42.229
can be from certain losses of physical health um

298
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.409
like increases in physical health problems and cognitive dysregulation

299
00:15:46.419 --> 00:15:51.200
from dementia like cognitive health problems. So, um and

300
00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:56.979
also certain losses. So for example, losing social support

301
00:15:56.989 --> 00:16:00.960
is so important for, for everyone um for everyone's

302
00:16:00.969 --> 00:16:04.940
health, but the older you are um and if

303
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.849
you start losing enough people, those the core people

304
00:16:08.859 --> 00:16:10.770
in your, in your life that can be a

305
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.580
very lonely isolating experience.

306
00:16:13.929 --> 00:16:17.489
But by physical health factors, I mean, what do

307
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.159
you mean exactly? Are you focusing on specific diseases

308
00:16:21.169 --> 00:16:25.039
or for example, losing mobility or what they,

309
00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:29.030
that's a really um wonderful question because and it's

310
00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:32.809
interesting like just this, the concept, the definition of

311
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.919
healthy of success. We used to call it successful

312
00:16:35.929 --> 00:16:38.130
aging and we call it healthy aging. It used

313
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.830
to be, you have to be free from disease.

314
00:16:40.289 --> 00:16:44.400
That is a healthy aging person. Well, about over

315
00:16:44.409 --> 00:16:47.109
85% of people, 65 and older have at least

316
00:16:47.119 --> 00:16:50.520
one chronic condition. Um AND yet around 80% of

317
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.159
older adults, if you ask them, are you a

318
00:16:52.169 --> 00:16:56.080
successful age? They will tell you yes. So clearly,

319
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.150
it's not a disease model and, and the absence

320
00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:01.679
is a good thing. And the World Health Organization

321
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:06.829
actually now defines healthy aging as whether or not

322
00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:10.170
you have an impairment or a co a chronic

323
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.729
illness. It's been able to do what you wanna

324
00:17:13.739 --> 00:17:16.270
do that makes you happy and engaged in your

325
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.390
life. Um Now, with that said, chronic illness by

326
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.300
itself doesn't, isn't related to lower levels of well

327
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.589
being. Unless what we found is if you report

328
00:17:26.598 --> 00:17:30.510
having three or four illnesses or more, then we

329
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.160
do see a decline in, well, we do see

330
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.359
differences in well being, um, lower. I mean, people

331
00:17:36.369 --> 00:17:39.810
have lower levels of well being. Um, AND, and

332
00:17:39.819 --> 00:17:42.760
you mentioned functional decline, you know, that inability to

333
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.229
climb stairs or to walk that far. And, and

334
00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:49.160
that certainly we think is one of the reasons,

335
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.589
um, because the more the more illnesses, it just

336
00:17:52.599 --> 00:17:55.589
increases the risk of, you know, the functional disability

337
00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:59.660
and, um, which leads you to not be able

338
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.680
to do what you wanna do that keeps you

339
00:18:01.689 --> 00:18:02.219
happy.

340
00:18:02.619 --> 00:18:06.079
Mhm. Uh So usually if people have just for

341
00:18:06.089 --> 00:18:10.650
example, one chronic disease, like, I don't know, diabetes

342
00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:15.750
or um high uh blood pressure or something or

343
00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.050
cholesterol or perhaps if they just lose some uh

344
00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:26.339
functional capacity, some mobility, perhaps one single uh uh

345
00:18:26.349 --> 00:18:30.744
I, I mean, a single one, those conditions probably

346
00:18:30.755 --> 00:18:34.185
doesn't affect the people much or. Yeah.

347
00:18:34.194 --> 00:18:36.814
Yeah, we found in, in looking at large studies,

348
00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:40.204
um just the number of illness is, is definitely

349
00:18:40.214 --> 00:18:43.744
correlated. However, um and you bring good point. So

350
00:18:43.755 --> 00:18:46.344
it, so for example, if you said, well, you

351
00:18:46.354 --> 00:18:48.114
can't really see if you take off your glasses.

352
00:18:48.125 --> 00:18:49.984
So, you know, that must affect your well being

353
00:18:49.994 --> 00:18:53.464
and like, well, it would if glasses weren't invented.

354
00:18:53.849 --> 00:18:57.630
Um DEFINITELY, but um I don't think I could

355
00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.869
cope with that very well. Some people might. Um

356
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.729
And so some people do. Um But, but I

357
00:19:03.739 --> 00:19:05.880
put my glasses, I'm fine. So if someone has

358
00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.119
high cholesterol and they take a, you know, lower

359
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:14.650
cluster, so chronic illnesses, um we think it's the

360
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.530
symptoms and they, and the way these illnesses might

361
00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.219
impact their daily lives. So if you have an

362
00:19:20.229 --> 00:19:22.339
illness, but you take a pill or it's is

363
00:19:22.349 --> 00:19:26.359
asymptomatic and doesn't bother you, then, then we don't

364
00:19:26.369 --> 00:19:33.060
see that. Um It's so, so um chronic pain

365
00:19:33.069 --> 00:19:36.189
is, is especially the uncontrollable. Chronic pain can be

366
00:19:36.199 --> 00:19:40.380
just devastating, just absolutely devastating. But when we look

367
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.349
at huge populations of people, usually we see that

368
00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:45.550
a real change with that three or more chronic

369
00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.189
conditions.

370
00:19:47.239 --> 00:19:47.640
Mhm.

371
00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:48.140
So,

372
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.810
so unless you have really a very severe condition,

373
00:19:52.819 --> 00:19:56.189
like, for example, chronic pain, I would imagine that

374
00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:01.880
the way you adapt to your new life also

375
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.780
plays a big role.

376
00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.050
Right. Right. And, and yes, and you see some

377
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.869
people, um, as we say, in research, we can

378
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.270
predict a population but we can't predict your aunt

379
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.810
or your uncle or you. And so, um some

380
00:20:13.819 --> 00:20:17.250
people are incredible and they cope and they do

381
00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.170
an incredible, incredible job. I remember talking to someone

382
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.869
who was par who was, who had a LS

383
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.589
um a horrible degenerative condition where he had lost

384
00:20:27.599 --> 00:20:29.910
his ability to move every part of his body

385
00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.939
except above and he could talk and he could

386
00:20:32.949 --> 00:20:37.209
kind of blink and he was so grateful for

387
00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:41.560
his life and his, his partner and, and he

388
00:20:41.569 --> 00:20:44.170
was happier than some of the undergraduates I see

389
00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.430
at the college who are in peak physical condition.

390
00:20:47.439 --> 00:20:52.750
And so I, I don't wanna say everyone but

391
00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.780
for, for many people who lose that function, like

392
00:20:56.489 --> 00:20:58.979
losing eyesight, for example, and not being able to

393
00:20:58.989 --> 00:21:04.280
drive at night. Um AND then some people have

394
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.650
a social network that allows them to, to drive

395
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.530
them and, and so it doesn't affect their ability

396
00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.469
to see their friends and, and, and do the

397
00:21:10.479 --> 00:21:13.329
activities they want in the evening. Other people live

398
00:21:13.339 --> 00:21:16.290
in places where there's public transportation that allows them

399
00:21:16.689 --> 00:21:22.530
um to be more independent. Um But some people

400
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.280
have a real hard time, they might live in

401
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.010
a rural area, for example, that is related to

402
00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.790
more problems with chronic conditions. Um BECAUSE they have

403
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.449
less help.

404
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:36.699
Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's definitely many aspects of

405
00:21:36.709 --> 00:21:40.689
aging are very complicated for many people out there.

406
00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:44.589
So, uh but earlier you mentioned uh being exposed

407
00:21:44.599 --> 00:21:48.699
to daily stressors, for example. So when that occurs,

408
00:21:48.709 --> 00:21:51.579
when that's the case, do they usually have long

409
00:21:51.589 --> 00:21:55.069
term physical health ramifications or not?

410
00:21:55.359 --> 00:21:58.660
Um Yes. Uh We find that it does predict

411
00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.790
um physical health problems. Um 10 years later, a

412
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.859
higher likelihood of having them. Um And we think

413
00:22:04.869 --> 00:22:07.760
that that part of just these daily stressors is

414
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.540
the release of cortisol. Um So cortisol is, is

415
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.160
commonly referred to as a stress hormone in the

416
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.250
literature. We all need cortisol. It's, it's a regular

417
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.260
part of our body. So it's great and um

418
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.369
and when we have it and we need it.

419
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.150
So if we see something and we need to

420
00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.670
quickly move it kind of mobilizes the body and

421
00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.939
allows us to run away or to fight our,

422
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.719
our enemy or, you know, the bear that's attacking

423
00:22:33.729 --> 00:22:36.109
us, you know, a millennial, you know, thousands of

424
00:22:36.119 --> 00:22:39.270
years ago, our ancestors to use this to, to,

425
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.869
to um have the energy to fight their fears

426
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.339
and their stressors. Um Nowadays, a lot of our

427
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.699
in a in um our developed world. So a

428
00:22:48.709 --> 00:22:50.619
lot of our fears and structures are not something

429
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.420
we fight. Um We just sit quietly in our

430
00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:58.469
board room or our classroom or, you know, wait

431
00:22:58.479 --> 00:23:00.489
in line at a store and have to deal

432
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.729
with our frustration. And we have to, sometimes we

433
00:23:03.739 --> 00:23:05.380
have to smile when we're doing it. And so

434
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.510
we're not using this energy, just kind of sitting

435
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.920
in our bodies. And if we're constantly feeling stressed,

436
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.060
these daily stressors, like, got an argument with somebody

437
00:23:16.069 --> 00:23:18.410
or there's someone who is really annoying. This is

438
00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.359
the most common. We all have something really annoying

439
00:23:21.369 --> 00:23:22.979
but you decide to let it go. Just, I'm

440
00:23:22.989 --> 00:23:25.400
not gonna, I'm not gonna engage with this person.

441
00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.979
Um, AND you have that but you're really upset

442
00:23:27.989 --> 00:23:30.770
by, it really bothers you, then you're gonna have

443
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.719
the stress response that includes this cortisol release. And

444
00:23:33.729 --> 00:23:37.670
if you have just high levels of cortisol and

445
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.930
no way to release it, it's, it's going to

446
00:23:39.939 --> 00:23:41.790
wear, it's gonna cause wear and tear in your

447
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.770
body. And so, um, it's going to eventually affect

448
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.790
your immune system. It's not, your immune system isn't

449
00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:52.770
gonna work as well. Um, FOR example, and, um,

450
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.699
and it, it's related to, to worse health later,

451
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:02.079
the more functional declines it's, it's related to a

452
00:24:02.089 --> 00:24:04.369
lot of very bad health risks.

453
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.729
Yeah, when it comes to hormones, I guess it's

454
00:24:07.739 --> 00:24:09.839
important for people to keep in mind that there

455
00:24:09.849 --> 00:24:13.420
are no bad hormones. What is bad is if

456
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.180
you find them, or some of them in very

457
00:24:16.189 --> 00:24:19.709
high concentrations in your blood or in particular parts

458
00:24:19.719 --> 00:24:23.689
of your body where they should have been, uh,

459
00:24:23.709 --> 00:24:26.689
uh, at least in those levels and some of

460
00:24:26.699 --> 00:24:29.670
them in particular parts of the day because some

461
00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.380
of them help you go to bed, go to

462
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.729
sleep or wake up in the morning. But perhaps

463
00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:38.250
if they are in high concentrations throughout the day

464
00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.949
and through long periods of time, that's when they

465
00:24:41.959 --> 00:24:43.540
have bad consequences.

466
00:24:44.069 --> 00:24:46.880
Yeah, that's an excellent point. There are no bad

467
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.040
hormones and in the same way, there are no

468
00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:54.079
bad emotions. I, I remember reading Leo's work. Um

469
00:24:54.089 --> 00:24:58.839
He's a wonderful effective neuroscientist and, and in his

470
00:24:58.849 --> 00:25:01.160
um in his research, he talks about anxiety, for

471
00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:05.140
example, and anxiety is a horrible, you know, if

472
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.739
people have anxiety disorders, it's, it's, it's a very

473
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.760
unpleasant, it's um very uncomfortable and yet what he

474
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.140
talks about is we would be alive if there

475
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:18.540
wasn't anxiety and fear because fear has motivated us

476
00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.780
to stay safe. And so it's a very adaptive

477
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.819
emotion and we all need it. But it's just

478
00:25:24.829 --> 00:25:27.939
when we have too much of it that it's

479
00:25:27.949 --> 00:25:28.449
a problem.

480
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.390
And no, this is a very important point to

481
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.569
make here because nowadays it's very frustrating to all

482
00:25:35.579 --> 00:25:40.250
the time here on social media, people bashing certain

483
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.229
hormones. Oh, you should do a dopamine detox. And

484
00:25:43.239 --> 00:25:46.099
I'm like, man, if you don't, if you didn't

485
00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:48.670
have dopamine in your brain, you wouldn't even be

486
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.150
able to make decisions.

487
00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.869
Come on. Yes, sir. So, right, there's a study

488
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.084
where they had, um, they brought it with and,

489
00:25:55.194 --> 00:25:57.714
um, and brought in pictures of their, their babies.

490
00:25:57.724 --> 00:26:00.645
They, all, these women had young Children, had babies

491
00:26:00.665 --> 00:26:04.864
and when they looked at their babies, um, they

492
00:26:04.875 --> 00:26:07.354
had more dopamine, they, they, they isolated and they

493
00:26:07.364 --> 00:26:09.185
had more dopamine And when people who are in

494
00:26:09.194 --> 00:26:11.814
love, when they see their, the people they're dating,

495
00:26:12.055 --> 00:26:14.474
same thing. It's like, yeah, you, you want the

496
00:26:14.484 --> 00:26:17.744
person, you, you want your romantic partner to see

497
00:26:17.755 --> 00:26:19.494
you and to have a little dopamine really. So

498
00:26:19.505 --> 00:26:23.530
they didn't, that's not great for dating, you know,

499
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.640
that young love.

500
00:26:25.449 --> 00:26:29.670
Yeah, you probably wouldn't feel uh much for the

501
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:35.140
person which wouldn't be at least in that context.

502
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.989
Yeah, for attachment.

503
00:26:39.339 --> 00:26:42.430
So I, I mean, another thing that I haven't

504
00:26:42.439 --> 00:26:46.410
asked you about yet is effective reactivity or perhaps

505
00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.530
you've already touched on it on it a little

506
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.170
bit. But what is it? And how does it

507
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:55.050
relate to the way people deal with daily stressors

508
00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:55.890
specifically?

509
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.680
It's interesting, you know that. So as I said,

510
00:26:59.689 --> 00:27:01.979
we've talked about this daily diary and how reactive

511
00:27:01.989 --> 00:27:06.449
you are to daily stressors. Um We always joke

512
00:27:06.459 --> 00:27:10.650
with emotion researchers that there are as many definitions

513
00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.579
of whatever of emotions of reactivity than there are

514
00:27:13.589 --> 00:27:17.310
emotion researchers in the room. And so, so even

515
00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:18.989
the reactivity at the end of the day, you

516
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.800
say, well, it was it is that reactivity or

517
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.329
is that rumination that we're still thinking about it?

518
00:27:23.339 --> 00:27:27.609
So some people define reactivity as that second, you

519
00:27:27.619 --> 00:27:31.650
know, that, that, that that initial response. So um

520
00:27:31.969 --> 00:27:35.510
appraisal theorists, for example, will say when something comes,

521
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.310
you know, when, when you see some some emotional

522
00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.180
stimulus in front of you, the first thing you,

523
00:27:43.189 --> 00:27:45.859
your body, your, your brain does even before you

524
00:27:45.869 --> 00:27:49.680
actually realize it is, identifies it as is it

525
00:27:49.689 --> 00:27:51.939
a threat or not? And then is it good

526
00:27:51.949 --> 00:27:53.780
for me or not? So these are these initial

527
00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.439
appraisals like good, bad, you know, and so if

528
00:27:56.449 --> 00:27:58.020
you, and once you do that, let's say you

529
00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.300
say it's bad. So it's like, oh bad, then

530
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.459
you think is it gonna harm me? Do I

531
00:28:02.469 --> 00:28:03.939
have what it takes to deal with it or

532
00:28:03.949 --> 00:28:05.910
not? So you're like, OK, I can deal with

533
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.459
this, yes or no or like no, I don't.

534
00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:12.609
So these initial, so that's reactivity for them. Um

535
00:28:12.709 --> 00:28:14.719
We say you reactivity at the end of the

536
00:28:14.729 --> 00:28:19.930
day, is it still bothering you? Um So, so,

537
00:28:19.989 --> 00:28:22.599
so that's those are two different definitions of reactivity

538
00:28:22.609 --> 00:28:26.209
that, that we can often use like initial reactivity

539
00:28:26.219 --> 00:28:27.800
and then longer term reactivity.

540
00:28:27.989 --> 00:28:31.099
Mhm So I would also imagine that there would

541
00:28:31.109 --> 00:28:34.599
be some or at least some individual differences here

542
00:28:34.609 --> 00:28:38.430
in how people respond to daily stressors, right? Or

543
00:28:38.439 --> 00:28:42.280
even perhaps in certain cases, if they even consider

544
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.040
it a stressor or not at all.

545
00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:49.430
Right. Yes. And um Richie Davidson who's a, um

546
00:28:49.439 --> 00:28:53.150
affect a neuroscientist in, at Wisconsin University of Wisconsin.

547
00:28:53.439 --> 00:28:56.979
Um, HE talks about the chronometer, the time chrono

548
00:28:56.989 --> 00:28:59.819
for time, the chronometer of emotions. And so he

549
00:28:59.829 --> 00:29:03.040
says there are individual differences in, in so many

550
00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.369
aspects of the emotional experience. So there's differences in

551
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.329
like how angry you get or how happy you

552
00:29:08.339 --> 00:29:11.170
get. So in that peak and then there's differences

553
00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.760
in how slowly you recover. So if you stay

554
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.140
angry or do you stay, you stay happy and

555
00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:18.420
you can see this, I think anyone can with

556
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.390
friends, they're like, oh yeah, that person takes a

557
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.704
long time to get upset once they're upset who

558
00:29:22.724 --> 00:29:25.084
stay away or it could be the reverse like

559
00:29:25.165 --> 00:29:27.064
they go from 1 to 100 and then they

560
00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:29.214
go, they're fine the next day or they're fine

561
00:29:29.224 --> 00:29:32.954
five minutes later. So um so we, we see

562
00:29:32.964 --> 00:29:36.474
differences in um we have, we see differences in,

563
00:29:36.484 --> 00:29:40.045
in even how, yeah, so how quickly people respond,

564
00:29:40.055 --> 00:29:41.704
how, how long it takes them to get back

565
00:29:41.714 --> 00:29:45.155
down. Um So in, in, in all of the

566
00:29:45.165 --> 00:29:49.064
processes that we study, there's these wonderful individual differences.

567
00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.030
So let's talk a little bit about social interactions

568
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.760
and social relationships here because of course, we as

569
00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:01.339
humans value those kinds of interactions a lot because

570
00:30:01.349 --> 00:30:04.900
there's many aspects of our lives that revolve around

571
00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:08.829
them uh and, and sometimes we have negative social

572
00:30:08.839 --> 00:30:13.359
interactions and uh we have effective responses to them.

573
00:30:13.369 --> 00:30:16.290
So, are there age differences here as well in

574
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:21.520
terms of uh people's effective responses to negative social

575
00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:22.380
interactions?

576
00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:27.099
It's interesting because when we ask people of different

577
00:30:27.109 --> 00:30:32.699
ages, um how often they have negative interactions, older

578
00:30:32.709 --> 00:30:36.459
people report them a lot less often than younger

579
00:30:36.469 --> 00:30:40.140
people and older people are more often to say

580
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:44.300
that a negative interaction wasn't as bad. Um Compared

581
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.969
to a younger person. Um Karen Ferman at UT

582
00:30:46.979 --> 00:30:49.319
Austin did this wonderful study years ago where she

583
00:30:49.329 --> 00:30:53.569
brought adult daughters into the lab with their mothers.

584
00:30:53.579 --> 00:30:55.209
So the mothers were in like their sixties and

585
00:30:55.219 --> 00:30:56.949
seventies and the daughters like there is in the

586
00:30:56.959 --> 00:30:59.859
forties and she brought them in and they, she

587
00:30:59.869 --> 00:31:02.969
had them do a task together that was collaborative

588
00:31:02.979 --> 00:31:06.089
task. It's kind of frustrating and then she separated

589
00:31:06.099 --> 00:31:07.770
them at the end and then she had them

590
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.099
report how was it? And so the the the

591
00:31:10.109 --> 00:31:12.920
moms are like, it was great, it was wonderful

592
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.930
and the daughter is like, yeah, not so much,

593
00:31:14.939 --> 00:31:18.449
you know, so, so even that same interaction, um

594
00:31:18.989 --> 00:31:21.180
the the moms are the older, you know, women

595
00:31:21.189 --> 00:31:25.060
were reporting much less negative than the the daughters.

596
00:31:25.069 --> 00:31:27.300
And we see that just whenever we ask people

597
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:31.790
about negative yeah, about any interactions that older people

598
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.420
are less likely to say they were negative and

599
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:39.000
they report lower levels of um negativity So they're

600
00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.729
generally like happier, we call them like happier relationships

601
00:31:41.739 --> 00:31:46.319
because there's less negativity of them. So, but, but

602
00:31:46.329 --> 00:31:48.150
often if you just ask how happy were you

603
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.310
to see somebody? Um SOMETIMES older people, especially family

604
00:31:52.319 --> 00:31:55.660
members will, will report much higher levels of happiness.

605
00:31:55.869 --> 00:31:59.359
But oftentimes, um but sometimes you see no differences

606
00:31:59.369 --> 00:32:04.170
because um young people do like people in their

607
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:04.780
lives too.

608
00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.900
I would imagine that the period of life where

609
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:14.150
people would report experiencing more negative social interactions would

610
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.199
be during their teenage years.

611
00:32:16.209 --> 00:32:20.280
Right? And also um Laura Carson, who did the

612
00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.380
socio emotional s activity theory that really addresses this.

613
00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:26.209
Um She did a study years ago where she

614
00:32:26.219 --> 00:32:29.380
asked people. So would you rather be with a

615
00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:33.839
close friend? Um, A stranger? Um And she had

616
00:32:33.849 --> 00:32:37.339
a whole different descriptions of different types of people

617
00:32:37.349 --> 00:32:39.599
and, and you had to see whether you'd want

618
00:32:39.609 --> 00:32:41.609
to interact with them. And one of those was

619
00:32:41.619 --> 00:32:43.500
a per a person you don't really know but

620
00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.599
you dislike and some, and she found that some

621
00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.729
of the people in their teens, some adolescents said

622
00:32:50.739 --> 00:32:53.579
they wanted to interact with that person. No older

623
00:32:53.589 --> 00:32:56.479
people did none in her study. And so she

624
00:32:56.489 --> 00:32:59.010
asked, she asked these young, she's like, why, why

625
00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.449
would you want to interact with someone you know,

626
00:33:00.459 --> 00:33:02.719
you dislike and the young people would say I

627
00:33:02.729 --> 00:33:04.819
want to know why I dislike them. What it,

628
00:33:04.829 --> 00:33:07.599
what is it about that person? I dislike, I,

629
00:33:07.609 --> 00:33:10.479
I haven't seen an older person tell me that.

630
00:33:10.489 --> 00:33:13.400
Um, BUT I would doubt that would happen very

631
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:16.040
often. Um, AND we don't see that happening. Very

632
00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:19.160
older people generally know why they dislike people. I

633
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:22.199
mean, like, what will bother them about, you know,

634
00:33:22.209 --> 00:33:25.000
a certain type of person. And so they, again,

635
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:27.449
back, going back to that so they don't engage

636
00:33:27.459 --> 00:33:31.500
or seek to engage in situations where they think.

637
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.020
Oh, no, this is not gonna go. Well,

638
00:33:33.589 --> 00:33:35.939
yeah. And I guess that with age we also

639
00:33:35.949 --> 00:33:38.859
learn that it's not a problem at all. If

640
00:33:38.869 --> 00:33:42.329
not everyone out there likes us, right? I, I

641
00:33:42.339 --> 00:33:45.140
mean, if, if there's one or two people out

642
00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:49.040
there that really dislike is whatever, it's not a

643
00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:49.859
big deal.

644
00:33:50.359 --> 00:33:52.640
Yes, you have that, you know, with age you,

645
00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:55.859
you absolutely learn these wonderful, you know, can't please

646
00:33:55.869 --> 00:33:57.959
all the people all the time and you also

647
00:33:57.969 --> 00:34:03.630
have comparisons. Um uh So, so if you meet

648
00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.170
someone, you don't like them, older people say well,

649
00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.340
but that was nearly as bad as, you know,

650
00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:11.500
when I was fired by my boss or when,

651
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:14.080
you know, they'll have this horrible situation in their

652
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.478
past. So they can put it in perspective too

653
00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.245
based on their expenses.

654
00:34:20.014 --> 00:34:23.245
But in your work, I, I read you talking

655
00:34:23.254 --> 00:34:28.145
about things like goals, appraisals. So what would be

656
00:34:28.155 --> 00:34:32.165
the roles that goals and appraisals play in our

657
00:34:32.175 --> 00:34:35.965
effective responses to negative social interactions?

658
00:34:37.688 --> 00:34:40.339
Well, I, I think that, you know, so a

659
00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:43.349
lot of times like giving talks, people say, how

660
00:34:43.358 --> 00:34:46.599
can young people be like older people? Um And

661
00:34:46.608 --> 00:34:50.268
so kind of not take these, these bad things

662
00:34:50.279 --> 00:34:52.398
as seriously. And, and some is what you said

663
00:34:52.408 --> 00:34:55.447
is, is going to appraise that, you know, what's

664
00:34:55.458 --> 00:34:58.059
possible and learning to accept what you can't change,

665
00:34:58.069 --> 00:35:02.560
for example, about other people. And um but I

666
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:06.239
also say, you know, some, I, I think that

667
00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:10.719
older people also in societies, again, in societies where

668
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.100
they have a retirement where they're, they're, they're not,

669
00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:19.149
they're no longer working. Um They also have something

670
00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:21.040
that younger people don't often have and that's the

671
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:24.209
ability to avoid something negative. So for example, if

672
00:35:24.219 --> 00:35:26.699
you're working and there's negative people that you have

673
00:35:26.709 --> 00:35:28.520
to, you know, you, you're working with some colleagues,

674
00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:30.879
you don't like, you don't have the ability just

675
00:35:30.889 --> 00:35:33.510
not talk to them or, you know, you don't

676
00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.419
have uh customers really bothering you. You can't just

677
00:35:36.429 --> 00:35:38.159
say, you know, I'm not gonna talk to you,

678
00:35:38.169 --> 00:35:42.929
you know. So, so sometimes um young, some older

679
00:35:42.939 --> 00:35:46.199
people have, you know, we have the ability to

680
00:35:46.209 --> 00:35:48.939
do to, to engage or not engage whereas younger

681
00:35:48.949 --> 00:35:52.449
people don't often, well, they might not. And so,

682
00:35:52.659 --> 00:35:55.919
um so I, as I joke with, but people,

683
00:35:55.929 --> 00:35:57.989
I think like my graduate students, they said, you

684
00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.250
know, I don't really want to work on my

685
00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.620
dissertation. I think I'm just gonna take the next

686
00:36:01.629 --> 00:36:04.889
month off, you know, it's, I'd say no, no,

687
00:36:05.429 --> 00:36:08.260
you don't have, you don't have necessarily have that

688
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.830
the same freedom, um, that older people have, have

689
00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.370
gained from, from their life and their place of

690
00:36:15.379 --> 00:36:17.820
where they are their role in life right now.

691
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.550
Mhm. Yeah. I, I guess that also when you

692
00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.669
get old, um, I mean, there are many more

693
00:36:25.679 --> 00:36:28.850
things that you don't care about anymore because, I

694
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.060
mean, I can't be fired anymore. I don't, I,

695
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:35.370
I don't need to impress anyone anymore. So I

696
00:36:35.379 --> 00:36:37.800
will say whatever I want

697
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.610
and what we do find and especially, and, um,

698
00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:47.090
more so for women. Um, AND then is that

699
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.689
you care less about what other, as you point

700
00:36:49.699 --> 00:36:51.449
out that what other people think about you, it's

701
00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:53.649
like, oh, they think I'm an idiot. Ok. You

702
00:36:53.659 --> 00:36:56.500
know, it just, whereas younger people, they're very concerned

703
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.610
and it makes sense if you're thinking, well, this

704
00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.889
person might be hiring me next week. You know,

705
00:37:00.899 --> 00:37:03.689
this person might put in a bad reference for

706
00:37:03.699 --> 00:37:06.550
me or, you know, so they might have to.

707
00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.300
So. Exactly. Exactly.

708
00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.560
Mhm. A and so I, I mean, just to

709
00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:14.679
close this section before I ask you about another

710
00:37:14.689 --> 00:37:18.370
topic, can we say that? Uh, AT least there's

711
00:37:18.379 --> 00:37:23.379
a tendency to, for effective well-being to increase with

712
00:37:23.389 --> 00:37:23.979
age.

713
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:29.620
Yes. Um, BASED on questions like how happy you

714
00:37:29.629 --> 00:37:32.540
are. You know, Art Stone did a study with

715
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:35.030
almost a half a million Americans and they called

716
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.169
them and said today, tell me about your emotions

717
00:37:38.409 --> 00:37:40.669
and the people, they, they asked people from age

718
00:37:40.679 --> 00:37:44.600
18 to people in their late eighties and the

719
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:50.540
happiest people were the age 72. So, um so

720
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.500
overall we see well being sometimes we see a

721
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:57.310
slight, a slight kind of increase in people after

722
00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:01.000
age 65. But, but generally we see the highest

723
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:05.530
rates of, of negative emotions in people in their

724
00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.350
teens and early twenties.

725
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:13.219
Yeah. Uh AND so uh earlier you mentioned very

726
00:38:13.229 --> 00:38:19.070
briefly rumination. Does that play a role in um

727
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:23.830
how levels of effective well-being change across the lifespan?

728
00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.110
I mean, if some people uh have a a

729
00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.639
higher tendency to ruminate compared to others, does that

730
00:38:30.649 --> 00:38:32.320
have any influence there?

731
00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:36.239
So, so we have um seen um in, in

732
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.709
studies um that when you ask people how often

733
00:38:39.719 --> 00:38:42.850
they ruminate um or, or did you did, did

734
00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.570
something bother you? Are you still thinking about it

735
00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:48.629
that fewer older adults say they're doing that than

736
00:38:48.639 --> 00:38:52.050
younger people? So um it's not that that older

737
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.870
adults handle rumination better because if you get them

738
00:38:54.879 --> 00:38:58.570
to ruminate it's bad but they are less likely

739
00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:03.510
to do that than younger people. And again, like

740
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.179
why? Um AND some people think older people are

741
00:39:06.189 --> 00:39:09.300
better at letting go and saying things like what

742
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:12.790
you were imagining like, hey, can't please everyone just

743
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.169
let it go. Um Other people think maybe it

744
00:39:16.179 --> 00:39:19.760
has it, maybe it has to do with not

745
00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:22.409
like remembering better, the gist like, oh we had

746
00:39:22.419 --> 00:39:25.060
a negative conversation than if you remembered every single

747
00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:28.179
detail. He said this and then she said this

748
00:39:28.189 --> 00:39:29.989
and then he said this and then I can't

749
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.850
believe they said this about me. Whereas if you

750
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.520
just said, yeah, this is something negative about me.

751
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:37.020
I don't remember as opposed they said that I

752
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.239
was, you know, and, and you remember every single

753
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:41.679
word and so some people think maybe that can

754
00:39:41.689 --> 00:39:45.120
help. But, um, for, for all these reasons, we

755
00:39:45.129 --> 00:39:49.379
see that perhaps again, some of them have to

756
00:39:49.389 --> 00:39:52.060
be tested still. Um, BUT there, but we do

757
00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.870
see that older people report lower levels of rein

758
00:39:54.909 --> 00:39:58.820
nation, no lower levels of regret. Like, um, Carson

759
00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.540
Bush does incredible research looking at regret and older

760
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:05.110
people have actually fewer regrets than younger people even

761
00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.629
though they live a lot longer.

762
00:40:07.909 --> 00:40:10.790
Yeah, I, I mean, in younger people, it's that

763
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.169
typical kind of conversation. Oh, he was there and

764
00:40:14.179 --> 00:40:16.350
then he was like, and I was like, and

765
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:21.260
he was like, I was right. Oh my God.

766
00:40:21.979 --> 00:40:25.419
So, uh, and I guess that rumination is also

767
00:40:25.429 --> 00:40:31.419
something very highly correlated with uh mental health conditions

768
00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:33.179
like depression, right?

769
00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.580
And you think about it if so if you

770
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.850
have a stressor and then you don't ruminate it

771
00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.810
if don't ruminate on it, you're like, oh, that

772
00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.360
happened. That was bad. Let's move on your body

773
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:45.679
kind of resets. Right. And, and so it's gone,

774
00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.159
whereas if you ruminate, you're keeping it with you,

775
00:40:48.169 --> 00:40:50.909
you're keeping that stress alive. And so you think

776
00:40:50.919 --> 00:40:53.850
if it's, whether it's cortisol or whether you're air

777
00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.229
and we didn't even talk about cardiovascular activity, so

778
00:40:56.239 --> 00:40:59.179
your heart rate is higher and your blood vessels

779
00:40:59.189 --> 00:41:02.540
are constricted, which we know that, you know, over

780
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:05.040
time that can lead to be related to higher

781
00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:09.010
incidents of hypertension. So, if you have these, so

782
00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.830
your, your vasoconstriction, so you have high blood pressure

783
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.360
and your, your heart rate's going and your, your

784
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.479
blood pressure is going up and you're keeping it

785
00:41:17.489 --> 00:41:20.179
like that for long periods of time. Um Because

786
00:41:20.189 --> 00:41:23.510
you're ruminating, you're still staying angry, you're still, or,

787
00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:26.830
you know, whatever emotion you will have anger and

788
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.600
hostility are probably the worst for health. Um, BASED

789
00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:32.239
on what we've seen in the studies and you

790
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:34.979
keep that going then that's very, that's very bad

791
00:41:34.989 --> 00:41:38.479
for you. I mean, think about it's, it's worse

792
00:41:38.489 --> 00:41:42.090
to have vasoconstriction and like high heart rate and

793
00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.179
really be aroused, thinking about it, then if you

794
00:41:44.189 --> 00:41:46.770
just calm yourself down and, and let it go,

795
00:41:47.909 --> 00:41:50.860
by the way, one concept I haven't asked you

796
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:55.689
about yet is emotional memory. What is that? Exactly?

797
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.909
Yeah. So, um emotional memory and that's kind of

798
00:41:58.919 --> 00:42:02.750
related what we've been talking about. So it's, it's

799
00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.330
the memories that you say, hey, remember that summer

800
00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.489
camp you went to or that vacation you were

801
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.530
on or how was it? You know, so, or

802
00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.629
that conversation you had with somebody. And so what

803
00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:17.270
we find is for people, regardless of age we

804
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.510
call that summer camp effect that, um, it's, it's

805
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.370
better than it was, you know, like I had

806
00:42:23.379 --> 00:42:25.260
a great time. You're like, wait a minute, you

807
00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.010
wanna remember as soon as you got back, you

808
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.580
said you'd never wanna go again? Yeah. Well, you

809
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:34.500
know, so, so, so we see that most people

810
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:37.679
remember it a little better than they do at

811
00:42:37.689 --> 00:42:41.040
the time. Um But we see this kind of

812
00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:44.729
memory, this, this difference in how you felt at

813
00:42:44.739 --> 00:42:46.699
the time versus how you talk about it. Now,

814
00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:50.010
we see that it's even more positive for older

815
00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:54.889
people than for younger people. So um we call

816
00:42:54.899 --> 00:42:58.729
um and Laura Carson and, and Joe Michael's, Mara

817
00:42:58.739 --> 00:43:00.939
Mather, they've done a lot of research on this

818
00:43:00.949 --> 00:43:03.570
and they, and they were, and it's referred to

819
00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.790
as the positivity effect. So their memories are either

820
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.879
more positive or they're less negative, but either way

821
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.409
it's, it's a more positive looking back and more

822
00:43:14.419 --> 00:43:15.330
positive memory.

823
00:43:16.439 --> 00:43:19.620
So we, we've talked about how people deal with

824
00:43:19.629 --> 00:43:25.419
negative emotion, uh negative social interactions earlier, but how

825
00:43:25.429 --> 00:43:30.699
do social relationships change across adulthood? Do they tend

826
00:43:30.709 --> 00:43:33.540
to get better with time or not?

827
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:39.270
So, we think better and the, the driving theory

828
00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:43.020
behind that is socio emotional selectivity theory. Um BUT

829
00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:47.979
uh Laura Carson and um developed um and

830
00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:50.620
by the way, tell us then a little bit

831
00:43:50.629 --> 00:43:53.939
about depth uh theory for also the audience to

832
00:43:53.949 --> 00:43:56.540
understand a little bit about what it refers

833
00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:01.340
to socio emotional selectivity theory is a theory about

834
00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:05.060
time and time perspective. And we're not talking, talking

835
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.179
about clock time, we're talking about how much time

836
00:44:08.189 --> 00:44:12.379
people perceive is left in their lives. So we

837
00:44:12.389 --> 00:44:15.510
think everyone has an awareness. Um All adults have

838
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.449
an awareness of how much time they have left

839
00:44:17.459 --> 00:44:20.159
in their lives. This is not something you consciously

840
00:44:20.169 --> 00:44:22.100
wake up in the morning and say to yourself,

841
00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:25.570
but it's something that you have um that you're,

842
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.689
you're kind of aware of. And so when you're

843
00:44:27.699 --> 00:44:31.219
younger and you see this broad and vast future,

844
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.399
um you have this, you have many years ahead

845
00:44:33.409 --> 00:44:35.199
of you and you have to plan for those

846
00:44:35.209 --> 00:44:38.080
years and you have to prepare for those years

847
00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:41.610
and you have to think about what you're gonna

848
00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.800
do in those years. And so a lot of

849
00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:47.409
your goals are gonna be about information and, and

850
00:44:47.419 --> 00:44:54.989
knowledge accruing for um for that vast future as

851
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.229
you get older, your future is, is shorter, is

852
00:44:58.239 --> 00:45:01.699
getting, is, you know, the the time horizons are

853
00:45:01.709 --> 00:45:04.679
um are decreasing and you have less, less time

854
00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:09.370
ahead of you. And so you can shift and,

855
00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:12.699
and um instead of focusing so much on this,

856
00:45:12.709 --> 00:45:16.100
on gaining information and knowledge for that future, you

857
00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:20.500
can then instead focus on the present and and

858
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:22.580
then by focusing on the present and focus on

859
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:26.510
emotional goals of well being, I should have said

860
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.260
at the beginning that so we, that socio emotional

861
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:34.419
selectivity theory states that there are two really important

862
00:45:34.429 --> 00:45:37.760
goals for all social interactions. And that's gaining information

863
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:40.689
and knowledge and just enjoying being with a person,

864
00:45:40.699 --> 00:45:43.540
you know, the emotional well being and and emotional

865
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:47.689
meaning. And so those are important, very important for

866
00:45:47.699 --> 00:45:50.429
everyone no matter how old you are, but you're

867
00:45:50.439 --> 00:45:54.379
constantly kind of gauging the relative importance of these

868
00:45:54.389 --> 00:45:58.679
two goals. And so you younger, you might sacrifice

869
00:45:58.689 --> 00:46:02.739
emotion more for that information, whereas older, you're more

870
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:05.500
likely to focus on the emotion rather than the

871
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:08.840
information. Um And so the older you get, the

872
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.939
more you really focus on this emotional meaning and

873
00:46:11.949 --> 00:46:16.060
emotional well being. And so you'll make decisions about

874
00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:17.860
who you want to interact with and what you

875
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:22.090
wanna do based on these increased emotional goals. And

876
00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.679
so, for example, you might want to interact more

877
00:46:25.689 --> 00:46:28.310
with close friends and family members because, you know,

878
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.629
they mean a lot to you and um just

879
00:46:30.639 --> 00:46:33.699
like they do for younger people. But, but hey,

880
00:46:33.709 --> 00:46:35.100
do you want to meet this new person? It

881
00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:38.379
has this new start up company. That's really interesting,

882
00:46:38.389 --> 00:46:40.500
you know, like I'd rather hang out with my,

883
00:46:40.629 --> 00:46:43.790
with my, you know, Children or my grandchildren. Um

884
00:46:44.419 --> 00:46:47.830
It's not as compelling to them because of their

885
00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.330
goals um than it would be for younger. And

886
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.719
so as a result, um they're focused on their

887
00:46:52.729 --> 00:46:55.139
emotional goals and they drive a lot of meaning

888
00:46:55.149 --> 00:46:59.219
and fulfillment in these interactions and they, they report

889
00:46:59.229 --> 00:47:02.260
greater happiness um selecting these skulls.

890
00:47:03.489 --> 00:47:07.669
So, in regards to my original question, does that

891
00:47:07.679 --> 00:47:12.669
mean then that social relationships tend to get better

892
00:47:12.909 --> 00:47:14.600
across the lifespan. So

893
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:18.110
older people will report greater satisfaction with their families,

894
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.659
with their friends. Um They report um great desire

895
00:47:22.669 --> 00:47:24.870
to want to interact, interact with them and when

896
00:47:24.879 --> 00:47:29.330
they've had an argument, um then they, and you

897
00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.860
ask them, was it resolved? Um They're more likely

898
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:33.729
to say it was resolved and they're more likely

899
00:47:33.739 --> 00:47:37.689
to, um, to not be, you know, to, to

900
00:47:37.699 --> 00:47:39.580
not be bothered by them as, as, as much

901
00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:43.790
a report that they haven't been. So, so overall,

902
00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:46.070
like every way we ask them, it's always better

903
00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:50.090
for older people, better relationships, happier when, you know,

904
00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:53.189
when they're with relationships, few arguments not as upset.

905
00:47:53.199 --> 00:47:56.110
So, so we do think that relationships are better.

906
00:47:56.699 --> 00:47:57.120
Mhm.

907
00:47:57.669 --> 00:48:01.169
So, of course, there's lots of research on the

908
00:48:01.179 --> 00:48:05.739
benefits of having social relationships or social circle and

909
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:09.479
even in terms of the health benefits themselves, it

910
00:48:09.489 --> 00:48:12.310
seems that if people at least have a few

911
00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:16.250
close friends and family, then they tend to age

912
00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:21.020
better even in terms of their physical health. Uh

913
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:24.879
But is that really always the ca, I mean,

914
00:48:24.889 --> 00:48:27.979
is it always the case that having low social

915
00:48:27.989 --> 00:48:32.409
ties relates to better health in old age. I

916
00:48:32.419 --> 00:48:36.820
mean, do they always come for benefits or not?

917
00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:41.959
Yes, I think so. Yes. And let me see

918
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:46.629
problems with the social relationships with older people. Um,

919
00:48:46.639 --> 00:48:49.870
IT'S those super close people, the, the people that,

920
00:48:49.879 --> 00:48:52.179
as we define, who are those people in your

921
00:48:52.189 --> 00:48:55.030
life that if they were to disappear, your life

922
00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.320
would never be quite the same. It's always about

923
00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:00.064
four or five people. People put their parents in

924
00:49:00.074 --> 00:49:04.114
there, people put their partners, their Children. Um, IF

925
00:49:04.125 --> 00:49:06.945
they have like, their close best friend or two,

926
00:49:07.405 --> 00:49:11.655
when that group gets to be two or fewer

927
00:49:11.665 --> 00:49:15.935
than that, that affects their well being. So, um,

928
00:49:15.945 --> 00:49:19.074
socio, emotional selectivity theory says that our huge network

929
00:49:19.084 --> 00:49:22.455
of social people in their lives decreases with age,

930
00:49:22.465 --> 00:49:26.139
but not that inner core. Um, AND yet if

931
00:49:26.149 --> 00:49:29.489
that inner core diminishes and there's no people to

932
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.719
replace those people. Um, SO, like, if your best

933
00:49:32.729 --> 00:49:36.050
friend dies, you never, you never find someone, a

934
00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:38.250
good friend of yours that becomes your best friend

935
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.219
or a new person that becomes your best friend

936
00:49:40.229 --> 00:49:42.600
that, that, um, and that core gets smaller and

937
00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:45.159
smaller. That, that is a problem. Mhm.

938
00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:48.610
But, but I mean, I would imagine that what

939
00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:52.370
really matters is for people to have a couple

940
00:49:52.379 --> 00:49:55.969
or a few close people, close friends. Right. I

941
00:49:55.979 --> 00:50:00.709
mean, iii, I wouldn't imagine that you get even

942
00:50:00.719 --> 00:50:04.429
more benefits if you try to have like 100

943
00:50:04.439 --> 00:50:07.919
friends or so, I mean, uh, a certain point

944
00:50:07.939 --> 00:50:11.370
it doesn't matter anymore. Right. You don't get more,

945
00:50:11.379 --> 00:50:14.770
be added benefits. And, uh, I would imagine that

946
00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:20.500
perhaps you, you would be sacrificing, uh, some more

947
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:25.060
closeness with a few people just to spend more

948
00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:27.649
time with those other people.

949
00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.260
That's a good question. I've never, I've never seen

950
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:32.169
a study looking at like, who are those inner

951
00:50:32.179 --> 00:50:35.489
core and, like, the differences in size other than

952
00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.370
if it gets to be two or, or feet

953
00:50:37.379 --> 00:50:40.189
or one or zero, that's the problem. But if

954
00:50:40.199 --> 00:50:42.520
it's three or more you're good. But I've never

955
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:45.469
seen a study looking at like, how, you know,

956
00:50:45.479 --> 00:50:48.129
if there's a different problems with having more or

957
00:50:48.139 --> 00:50:49.929
less than, besides the two.

958
00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.219
Yeah. No, I, I mean, I was just asking

959
00:50:52.229 --> 00:50:55.699
that out of curiosity because, you know, nowadays, particularly

960
00:50:55.709 --> 00:50:59.060
with social media, you go to Facebook, you have

961
00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:03.600
500 friends there and people care a lot about

962
00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:07.520
that and some, and there are highly social people

963
00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:10.939
that, uh, I have, uh, I don't know, hundreds

964
00:51:10.949 --> 00:51:13.320
of acquaintances or something like that. But I, I

965
00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:18.550
guess that uh, like at least 9095 probably more,

966
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.860
a higher percentage of those people are just people

967
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:26.580
who, with whom you have positive social interactions, but

968
00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:29.770
it's not really close friendships.

969
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:34.100
Right. Absolutely. No. Absolutely. And that's those, exactly those

970
00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:36.419
people you're describing are exactly the people that you

971
00:51:36.429 --> 00:51:39.530
see decline the most with age are these peripheral,

972
00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.860
they call them, these purple friends and, and that's

973
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:45.090
where you see older people are reporting far fewer

974
00:51:45.239 --> 00:51:46.189
than younger.

975
00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:49.149
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I, I mean, I guess

976
00:51:49.159 --> 00:51:53.870
that after this interview, uh, I'm really, I feel

977
00:51:53.879 --> 00:51:58.080
better that I'm already ahead of my teenage and,

978
00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:03.379
uh, my, uh, twenties, uh, years. So, but, and

979
00:52:03.389 --> 00:52:06.030
I, I'm also looking forward to my sixties, I

980
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:09.100
guess, but I'm still a little bit scared of

981
00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:12.699
my forties because you haven't convinced me that

982
00:52:12.709 --> 00:52:13.899
middle age

983
00:52:13.909 --> 00:52:14.979
will be a good thing.

984
00:52:15.439 --> 00:52:18.459
Well, it's interesting, like one of the Laura Carson's

985
00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:21.889
first studies that really introduced sociological activity theory was

986
00:52:21.899 --> 00:52:26.629
this your social network gets smaller. And so we

987
00:52:26.639 --> 00:52:28.969
see this as an old age thing, but she

988
00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:32.389
started seeing this, this kind of select selection and

989
00:52:32.399 --> 00:52:34.530
it wasn't that people are saying, oh, I want

990
00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.429
friends. I don't have them. It was like these

991
00:52:36.439 --> 00:52:37.659
are the people in my network and I'm really

992
00:52:37.669 --> 00:52:40.409
happy with them. She started seeing this in, in

993
00:52:40.419 --> 00:52:43.270
the people in their thirties. So this was a

994
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.739
gradual linear experience across age. It wasn't like all

995
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:48.389
of a sudden you're 65 and you're like, ok,

996
00:52:48.399 --> 00:52:51.560
no more friends, you know. So, so, and, and

997
00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:54.290
at least this part, you shouldn't be scared about

998
00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:57.689
the social because the social is you're more selective.

999
00:52:57.699 --> 00:52:59.919
You're keeping it like fine wines, you're like putting

1000
00:52:59.929 --> 00:53:02.340
out all the, the bad stuff that you're just

1001
00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:03.610
keeping that really good stuff.

1002
00:53:04.379 --> 00:53:06.889
Yeah. And no, I, I actually like that. I

1003
00:53:06.899 --> 00:53:11.610
actually like a fewer people because it's really bothersome

1004
00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:14.389
to try to make plans with. I don't know

1005
00:53:14.399 --> 00:53:17.790
what number of people out there. I mean, it's

1006
00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:22.030
just too much for me at least. So. Yeah.

1007
00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.989
So I, is there anything else, uh, just that

1008
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.830
you would like to add that perhaps we have

1009
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.350
missed in our conversation just as, I don't know,

1010
00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:35.100
a final message about effective well being across the

1011
00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:36.790
lifespan or, or not.

1012
00:53:37.409 --> 00:53:41.689
Um, NO, I, um, you know, older, old age

1013
00:53:41.699 --> 00:53:44.580
is generally a pretty good time for a life

1014
00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:49.219
or emotional well being, um, uh, older people, at

1015
00:53:49.229 --> 00:53:52.310
least in countries like Portugal and the United States

1016
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:57.330
and, and North America, Western Europe. Um, THEY, um,

1017
00:53:57.719 --> 00:54:01.199
luckily have these safety nets of retirements that where

1018
00:54:01.209 --> 00:54:03.949
they, they can get some social security if somehow

1019
00:54:03.959 --> 00:54:06.679
and so life is pretty good. Um, THEY do

1020
00:54:06.689 --> 00:54:09.969
see studies comparing like eastern Europe with Western Europe

1021
00:54:09.979 --> 00:54:12.090
and, and when you live in a place where

1022
00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:14.199
you don't have that old age looks a little

1023
00:54:14.209 --> 00:54:16.870
different. So I don't want to say, oh, old

1024
00:54:16.879 --> 00:54:18.389
age is great for everyone. It's like, well, if

1025
00:54:18.399 --> 00:54:19.760
you live in a war torn area or if

1026
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:22.159
you live in some countries in Eastern Europe that

1027
00:54:22.169 --> 00:54:25.739
don't have the social security and the financial safety

1028
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:28.719
nets that, that you do, you don't see the

1029
00:54:28.729 --> 00:54:33.080
well being getting better with age, but in countries

1030
00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:35.409
that do have that you do see it. And

1031
00:54:35.419 --> 00:54:38.409
so it's a wonderful, it's, it's a wonderful testament

1032
00:54:38.419 --> 00:54:40.889
to only, it's like the context of aging. It's

1033
00:54:40.899 --> 00:54:43.330
a wonderful testament to countries that do have that

1034
00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:48.229
do prioritize taking care of, um, all of its

1035
00:54:48.239 --> 00:54:50.570
citizens that we see a healthy aging.

1036
00:54:51.139 --> 00:54:54.060
I mean, actually that's a great point because at

1037
00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:59.209
least in more developed societies with lower birth rates

1038
00:54:59.219 --> 00:55:01.949
and all of that and aging populations, we're seeing

1039
00:55:01.959 --> 00:55:06.540
more of this phenomenon of loneliness in old age

1040
00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:10.709
and just told people being, I guess abandoned and

1041
00:55:10.719 --> 00:55:14.580
I guess that wouldn't really be good at all

1042
00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:17.510
for their physical or mental health.

1043
00:55:17.959 --> 00:55:21.709
Yes. And just, yeah, we see that loneliness is

1044
00:55:21.719 --> 00:55:25.520
actually lower in the sixties. I just met people

1045
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:28.399
in their twenties. But after 85 that's when you

1046
00:55:28.409 --> 00:55:31.790
see loneliness is a, is a problem for older

1047
00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:35.689
adults. Yeah. Yeah. And, yeah. Ok.

1048
00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:39.169
So let's keep that in mind. And just before

1049
00:55:39.179 --> 00:55:41.229
we go, would you like to tell people where

1050
00:55:41.239 --> 00:55:43.370
they can find you when your work on the

1051
00:55:43.379 --> 00:55:43.909
internet?

1052
00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:48.159
So, um, yes. Well, if you, if you look

1053
00:55:48.169 --> 00:55:50.350
at my web page, um, I'll try to update

1054
00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:54.689
it and it's at UC I, um, also if

1055
00:55:54.699 --> 00:55:56.860
you go into Google Scholar and just put my

1056
00:55:56.870 --> 00:56:00.570
name, Susan T Charles, you can find articles and

1057
00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:02.689
a lot of them are, are free and available

1058
00:56:02.699 --> 00:56:04.479
to read if you, if you want to do

1059
00:56:04.489 --> 00:56:08.350
that too. Um, SO those are the two places

1060
00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:08.969
I'd suggest.

1061
00:56:09.379 --> 00:56:12.320
Ok, great. So I'm leaving that in the description

1062
