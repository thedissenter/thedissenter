00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.009
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.820
Dissenter. I'm your host, Ricardo Lopes and today I'm

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.739
joined by Doctor Craig Callender. He, he is status

4
00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:13.460
Chancellor's professor of philosophy and founding faculty and co-director

5
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.450
of the Institute for Practical Ethics at the University

6
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.360
of California San Diego. And today, we're talking about

7
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.350
the philosophy of physics with the focus on time

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.600
and also uh how it compares to our intuitive

9
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.040
model of time. So Doctor Callender, welcome to the

10
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.319
show. It's a pleasure to have you everyone.

11
00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:37.080
Hi, thank you very much, Ricardo. It's a pleasure.

12
00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:42.509
So, before we get into the physics itself, uh,

13
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.889
just to talk a little bit about how we

14
00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:49.290
as humans, uh, into it time. So we have

15
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.400
this, or we tend to have this model of

16
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.720
time where we think about it as, uh, flowing

17
00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.159
present that divides the fixed past from an open

18
00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.830
future. I mean, comparing it to physics or, uh,

19
00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.180
how we think about time in physics. Uh, I

20
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.819
mean, how close is, is it?

21
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.260
Um, YEAH, I think it's, well, I think at

22
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.970
the kind of fundamental level, it's basically wrong. Uh,

23
00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:23.180
BUT, uh, yeah, so in my book, I call

24
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.220
this model, uh, manifest time, and I don't mean

25
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.809
it necessarily as like manifest in the sense of

26
00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:32.139
the time you observe, but it's sort of like

27
00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:34.819
this sort of more common sense model of time.

28
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.220
Um, AND so, yeah, you, you think that this

29
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.290
moment, this moment we're talking right now is, uh,

30
00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:45.379
you know, distinguished in the world. It's the only

31
00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:48.370
thing that's happening and that it divides the world

32
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.739
into two, you know, and it's the present that

33
00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:54.059
it's the, but it divides, you know, the past

34
00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:57.500
from the future and, uh, the past and the

35
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.739
future, we tend to think of very different from

36
00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:03.480
one another, you know, so that. Past is very,

37
00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:07.239
is fixed, uh, the future open. And then we

38
00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:09.758
think this whole structure just kind of updates itself

39
00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:13.289
and moves. Um, YEAH, and then I think, well,

40
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.050
that, that actually, from the point of view of

41
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.380
physics, I think is, is, uh, at. Well, it's

42
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.080
wrong. OK,

43
00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:27.800
so then what is the correct uh view of

44
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.160
time, how does time actually work in physics?

45
00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.350
Yeah, so if we, well, you know, we, we,

46
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.600
we can look at different physical theories, but if

47
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.320
we think of relativity as sort of the theory

48
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.770
that Uh, explicitly tackles time. Uh, THEN, you know,

49
00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.009
there, you know, on, on the, in the relativistic

50
00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:52.529
universe, what you have instead is, you know, a

51
00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.220
bunch of all of the events of the universe

52
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.520
also laid out in this kind of four-dimensional manifold.

53
00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:04.169
And you don't really think of um time is

54
00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:08.600
a fundamental aspect of this, you know, famously Minkowski

55
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.440
said, you know, with space, uh, you know, that

56
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.690
space and time we're doomed to fade away into

57
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.809
mere shadows. Um, AND so in a relativistic universe,

58
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.979
you don't need This kind, you will, a, you

59
00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:26.779
don't have a distinguished moment uh moment of simultaneity.

60
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.199
But really the, the common sense picture is more

61
00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.199
than about simultaneity. It's about, you know, I kind

62
00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.320
of distinguished now, which is like an indexical, you

63
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.679
know, so now is now, but now, now is

64
00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:45.600
now and, you know, and so the physics, even

65
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.520
even before relativity didn't make use of uh distinguished

66
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.119
now, even when you had simultaneity like in classical

67
00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:56.750
physics. Uh, SO I think even classical physics shows

68
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.639
that are Common sense, conception of time is not

69
00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.449
right, or at least it's, it's not, it doesn't

70
00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:08.479
vindicate it, maybe I should say. Um, And uh

71
00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:10.509
yeah, so in, in, in physics then, but then

72
00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.149
relativity is sort of makes it even worse for

73
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.559
common sense time. Uh, IT'S uh not only it

74
00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:19.899
makes it harder to, if you think of it

75
00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.839
like common sense time as a kind of model

76
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.910
and you try to like graft it onto the

77
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.920
relativistic universe. It's very hard to do that in

78
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.899
a non-arbitrary way.

79
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.299
But I, I mean, compared to the way we

80
00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:40.209
commonly think about time, I mean, our sort of

81
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.570
folk physics, let's say, uh, this time actually have

82
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.450
uh a direction or even or a fixed direction

83
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.250
or not?

84
00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:53.779
Uh, ACCORDING to, yeah, I think according to the

85
00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.899
kind of folk model, it definitely does. So I

86
00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:00.279
think of, well, I think of, so I'm thinking

87
00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.619
of the folk model, I'm thinking of, you know,

88
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.739
past, present, future, and then that distinguishes the, the

89
00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:09.739
future from the past in a kind of intrinsic

90
00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:10.100
way.

91
00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.010
Uh, BUT, but then, uh, I mean, uh, what

92
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.730
about the model that we have in physics? Does

93
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.480
it have any direction or not?

94
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.720
Uh, WELL, it, it, it, yes and no. Uh,

95
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.570
SO I, uh, think that, you know, there are,

96
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.559
so when we think about that in physics, we,

97
00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:34.540
we ask, you know, are the laws, uh, what

98
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.779
they're called time reversal invariant. And so if you

99
00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:39.890
know, viewers want to think of it intuitively, you

100
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.809
know, just think of like a kind of film,

101
00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:43.970
you know, you have a film of the universe

102
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.140
and then you run it backwards. Is the, is

103
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.459
what you saw backwards also a solution to the

104
00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:53.609
laws of physics? And if not, then it seems

105
00:05:53.609 --> 00:05:56.130
like the laws care about the direction of time.

106
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.029
And so when it comes to some of the

107
00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:03.769
big famous equations, uh, fundamental equations of physics, it

108
00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:06.640
seems like they are time reversal invariant that I,

109
00:06:06.859 --> 00:06:10.040
if I ran everything backward, it would be possible.

110
00:06:10.489 --> 00:06:15.209
That's certainly the case of classical mechanics. Um, But

111
00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:18.549
there are these, you know, phenomena in quantum field

112
00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:22.059
theory that do seem to be time, not time

113
00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:27.179
reversal invariant. Um, AND then there's this other symmetry

114
00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:31.040
people talk about called CPT, which is the combined

115
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.670
operations of flipping charges. Flipping spatial handedness and then

116
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.880
flipping the direction of time. And then physics is

117
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.820
invariant under that. And so if that is sort

118
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.429
of like the modern version of thinking of time

119
00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:52.779
time reversal environment, then it's uh That then physics

120
00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.700
is, uh, you know, invariant of that. That is

121
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.769
if I gave you a movie. Uh, OF the

122
00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:04.089
universe, and then I switched all the charges, positive

123
00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:07.570
to negative, switched all the hands from right-handed to

124
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.329
left-handed, and then switched the direction of time, then

125
00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:15.029
you couldn't tell the difference between the two. Um

126
00:07:16.859 --> 00:07:20.429
And so, well anyway, yeah, so that, that may,

127
00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:24.690
might clash with our ordinary uh conception of time,

128
00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:29.579
uh, that, you know, firmly has a direction in

129
00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:30.690
it. Mhm.

130
00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:36.209
And where this time come from exactly? I mean,

131
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.660
how does time arises?

132
00:07:40.609 --> 00:07:45.489
Uh, I guess I think there's Well, there's no

133
00:07:45.489 --> 00:07:49.369
real answer to that question, you know, so I

134
00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:53.000
think of time as just a kind of non-fundamental

135
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.609
aspect of spacetime. And then if I, if I,

136
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.829
so that if I translate the question to You

137
00:08:00.829 --> 00:08:04.670
know, is, uh, where spacetime come from? And I

138
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.950
think, well, spacetime just is, uh, so it's a

139
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.589
bit like, you know, why, you know, why, then

140
00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:13.630
the question becomes more like, you know, why, why

141
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.950
is there something rather than nothing or why is

142
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.980
there being rather than not being? And then I

143
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.429
just think there's not really an answer to that

144
00:08:21.429 --> 00:08:24.929
question. We've reached the limit at that point.

145
00:08:25.859 --> 00:08:28.179
Yeah, uh, but when it comes to the space

146
00:08:28.179 --> 00:08:30.809
time continuum, I mean,

147
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.320
I,

148
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.900
I'm not sure if this question even makes sense

149
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.900
or at least the way I'm going to put

150
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:42.820
it, but Um, how does time relate to space?

151
00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:43.499
Exactly.

152
00:08:45.789 --> 00:08:53.570
Uh, YEAH, so it's, um, If you, um, how

153
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.929
does time relate to space? Yeah, so they, they

154
00:08:55.929 --> 00:09:03.309
have 22 different. DIMENSIONS of the space-time continuum. And

155
00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:08.650
so there, but It's not, um, in relativity, it's

156
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.890
not like that, it's not like you just sort

157
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.299
of You know, in classical physics, you could sort

158
00:09:15.299 --> 00:09:17.099
of think of like the universe is like a

159
00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:19.650
big, you know, I don't know, a, a big

160
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.419
ham or a salami, and I sli put it

161
00:09:22.419 --> 00:09:24.609
into the slicer and I slice, slice, slice, slice,

162
00:09:24.619 --> 00:09:28.919
slice. And each slice is entirely spatial and there's

163
00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:33.320
one way to do the slicing. In relativity, You

164
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.640
could do that kind of slicing, but it's not

165
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.599
unique. And so there's all these other ways you

166
00:09:37.599 --> 00:09:40.239
could you could have sliced the, the ham or

167
00:09:40.239 --> 00:09:45.510
the the spacetime manifold. And the time is the

168
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.330
direction in which You know, that's sort of orthogonal

169
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.729
to all those possible slicings. Uh, SO there's all

170
00:09:52.729 --> 00:09:55.570
these different ways you could do the slicing and

171
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.119
time is the sort of direction, so really we

172
00:09:59.119 --> 00:10:03.330
should speak about the timelike directions in relativity. So

173
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.239
what directions are the timelike ones, and those are

174
00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:09.289
the ones that will allow this kind of slicing

175
00:10:09.289 --> 00:10:14.219
to happen. Uh, AND so it relates to space.

176
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:19.049
It's just, it's another, um, Well, it's another direction

177
00:10:19.049 --> 00:10:20.080
on the manifold.

178
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.539
Mhm. But uh, but I mean, what are maybe

179
00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:30.099
the distinctions between the space-like and the time-like directions

180
00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:31.260
in physics?

181
00:10:32.289 --> 00:10:36.669
Yeah, so that's really a huge uh issue uh

182
00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:41.169
and really uh very important uh because Once people

183
00:10:41.169 --> 00:10:43.849
think about and people tend to go to relativity

184
00:10:43.849 --> 00:10:45.549
and they start thinking about it, then they think,

185
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.969
well, yeah, time is just another dimension of the.

186
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.010
Uh, OF a four-dimensional kind of block, and then

187
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.380
they think it, it's then, you know, like space.

188
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.719
But it's not like space, it's, you know, the,

189
00:11:01.169 --> 00:11:04.570
so the fundamental feature of relativity is the, the

190
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:09.179
metric, which gives the distances between events. And the

191
00:11:09.179 --> 00:11:13.340
dis the distances between events in the timely direction

192
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.289
are um of one. Of one sign, either positive

193
00:11:18.289 --> 00:11:21.729
or negative, and the distance between the the the

194
00:11:21.729 --> 00:11:25.630
space-like ones are the other sign. And that little

195
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.590
sign difference, so sometimes people just talk about like

196
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.989
there's just a minus a minus in front of

197
00:11:30.989 --> 00:11:35.919
the time like directions. Uh, THAT little minus sign,

198
00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:38.700
it seems like it's not that important. But that

199
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.780
little Einstein is massively important, and so it ends

200
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.940
up making all the difference, uh, excuse me, all

201
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.859
the difference between the, the space-like and the timelike

202
00:11:48.859 --> 00:11:54.599
directions. And so you can have um You know,

203
00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:57.809
there's uh and and what behavior and how that

204
00:11:57.809 --> 00:12:00.000
how that then that mind sign then hooks into

205
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.919
the rest of physics. Like about with the, with

206
00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:07.400
its relationship to mass, its relationship to the dynamics

207
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.640
of what happens, all is very, very different. And

208
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.659
so to me when I don't, when I see

209
00:12:14.659 --> 00:12:18.299
that little minus sign, uh, I think, you know,

210
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.299
I don't try to obscure. I, I don't pretend

211
00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:24.340
it's only a little minus sign. I see it

212
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.580
is really like the core difference between the space

213
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.099
like in the time like and you know, super

214
00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:34.859
important, which leads to basically all the important physical.

215
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.169
At a gross scale, all the important physical features

216
00:12:38.169 --> 00:12:40.299
of, of the physical world.

217
00:12:41.669 --> 00:12:45.640
But, but, but then just to clarify one point

218
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.039
that you made there, when people say, which is

219
00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:55.119
something that we commonly hear that physics specializes time

220
00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:56.950
that is incorrect.

221
00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:02.309
Right. That's right. I think that's uh uh incorrect

222
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.369
and that that. That that saying that has led

223
00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:10.059
to, you know, uh uh really a misunderstanding of

224
00:13:10.059 --> 00:13:14.239
relativity and led to You know, I think, I

225
00:13:14.239 --> 00:13:18.119
think some of the less productive directions and philosophy

226
00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:21.080
of time. Um, YOU know, so people have said

227
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.390
this many times, uh, you know, where they say,

228
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.390
uh, you know, so Bergson famously said that, uh,

229
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:36.229
you know, physics, uh, spatialized time. And I think,

230
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.349
you know, there's a certain way of seeing it

231
00:13:38.349 --> 00:13:42.109
where maybe, maybe, you know, it, well, I don't

232
00:13:42.109 --> 00:13:43.989
think it does at all, but I think what's

233
00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:48.119
going on is this, you know, so in, when

234
00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:50.650
we think of the spatial, we don't think of

235
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:56.039
the Um, We might call the, uh, the kind

236
00:13:56.039 --> 00:14:00.809
of the spatial the indexical terms as as objective.

237
00:14:01.359 --> 00:14:03.960
So I say I'm here, I'm here and and

238
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.880
here means San Diego, you're there and you're there

239
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.630
in Portugal, and then I might move, I might

240
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.599
fly to Portugal, and then I then my here

241
00:14:12.599 --> 00:14:15.760
is Portugal. And no one thinks that the spatial

242
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.320
here is important in any way, uh, you know,

243
00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:25.659
objective, uh, sorry. And So, And then, and so

244
00:14:25.659 --> 00:14:29.239
then when we get to relativity or, or physics,

245
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:34.049
it doesn't require the indexical time counterparts of those

246
00:14:34.049 --> 00:14:39.580
spatial indexicals. So it doesn't require a now um

247
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.030
and uh uh a past or a future. You

248
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.429
can just have all the earlier than later than

249
00:14:45.429 --> 00:14:48.539
relations. Just like in space, you can have all

250
00:14:48.539 --> 00:14:50.380
the, you know, just to the right of or

251
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.460
to the left of or something. We don't think

252
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.880
of those as You know, that you don't think

253
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.869
that there's like a right side to the universe.

254
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.150
And so when we say that physics spatialized time.

255
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.229
Um, MAYBE if we just meant, well, it, we

256
00:15:06.229 --> 00:15:10.909
don't objectify the temporal and dexicles. Well then that

257
00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:13.979
might be right. But then classical physics didn't do

258
00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:17.830
that either. And so it it's not really um

259
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.590
You know, uh, and we, you know, so. That

260
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.510
doesn't mean that for the non-indexical stuff that space

261
00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.140
and time are, are, are treated the same way.

262
00:15:27.349 --> 00:15:31.059
They're clearly not, even even in classical physics. So

263
00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:34.729
I think that we've never specialized uh time in

264
00:15:34.729 --> 00:15:37.900
one sense, or we've always specialized time in this.

265
00:15:39.169 --> 00:15:42.679
Weaker sentence, uh, but the important thing is that

266
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.869
in the terms of the non-indexical stuff. We've never

267
00:15:46.869 --> 00:15:50.619
specialized time and relativity certainly doesn't do it either.

268
00:15:51.739 --> 00:15:52.469
Mhm.

269
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.960
Yeah, yeah, I, I guess that also, uh, I

270
00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.559
mean, many things in science are extremely counterintuitive, but

271
00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:04.799
probably things coming from physics are some of the

272
00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:08.119
most counterintuitive out there and particularly when it, when

273
00:16:08.119 --> 00:16:11.539
it comes to the time and the space-time continuum,

274
00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:14.400
I mean, it's very easy for us to imagine.

275
00:16:14.989 --> 00:16:20.280
A 33 dimensional space because that's actually what we

276
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.000
see. But when it comes to trying to understand

277
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.070
this, uh, for, uh, dimension of time, it clashes

278
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.250
against our common understanding of time a lot. Uh,

279
00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.359
AND so it's, it's very hard for us to

280
00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:39.390
wrap our minds around it,

281
00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:41.880
right? Yeah, definitely.

282
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.609
So, uh, and, uh, I mean, what is the

283
00:16:45.609 --> 00:16:49.989
tense theory of time? I mean, what are tensor

284
00:16:49.989 --> 00:16:52.190
in the context of physics?

285
00:16:53.869 --> 00:16:57.080
Yeah, so tenses are, yeah, so if we think

286
00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:02.719
of these temporal indexicals. Like now and uh you

287
00:17:02.719 --> 00:17:07.020
know, uh, past and future. Those are called tenses

288
00:17:07.719 --> 00:17:11.640
and notice that they're always relative. What the crucial

289
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.640
thing is really this idea that there's a distinguished

290
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:20.250
now or present. All of the other. TEMPORAL uh

291
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.810
properties are ultimately connected to this idea that there's

292
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:30.430
a kind of privileged now. Um, AND You know,

293
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.510
so McTaggart famously in 1908 had this paper in

294
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.630
which he talks about uh the tent, uh, these

295
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.589
tense properties. And he calls it the A series.

296
00:17:43.439 --> 00:17:46.489
And Yes you could just, you could look at

297
00:17:46.489 --> 00:17:48.530
all of, you could organize all the events of

298
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.479
the universe and just say which ones are now,

299
00:17:51.689 --> 00:17:55.290
which ones are past, which ones are future. We

300
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.729
could also do what's been called the B series,

301
00:17:58.849 --> 00:18:01.689
the tense list series where I organize all the

302
00:18:01.689 --> 00:18:03.969
events in terms of the earlier than or later

303
00:18:03.969 --> 00:18:10.119
than relations. So Socrates dying, that was earlier than

304
00:18:10.969 --> 00:18:14.910
this our discussion. It was in the past. So

305
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.469
in the first one, I'm using tenseless language. It's

306
00:18:18.469 --> 00:18:23.229
always true that Socrates's death was earlier than our

307
00:18:23.229 --> 00:18:28.369
discussion. Uh, BUT it wasn't always past, you know,

308
00:18:28.449 --> 00:18:31.290
at one point for Socrates, it was present, at

309
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.770
one point for Socrates was in the future, and

310
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.290
both our both our discussion and Socrates' death were

311
00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:41.160
were in the future. So that, so what's one

312
00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:44.170
feature of this, the tense properties are that they

313
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.609
have this kind of changing truth values with with

314
00:18:47.609 --> 00:18:51.050
respect to what time. Uh, YOU, you use them.

315
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.670
And the Mta was really ahead of his time

316
00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:00.040
because You know, this, I mean, identifying this then

317
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.479
became a a a a feature in cognitive linguistics

318
00:19:03.479 --> 00:19:06.750
where people do. You know, look at this kind

319
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.270
of language we use. So it's definitely a real

320
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.819
thing, you know, that we, as we as we

321
00:19:14.469 --> 00:19:19.310
use language, I think it's And I, I'm not

322
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.050
a linguist, so I, I maybe I'm wrong, but

323
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.859
I think it's a, it's Not every language has

324
00:19:25.859 --> 00:19:29.060
tenses exactly, but, but most, all every language has

325
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.219
a way of encoding them in some way, as

326
00:19:31.219 --> 00:19:33.380
far as I understand. And so it seems to

327
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.060
be a pretty universal feature of human language that

328
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:40.150
we speak in this kind of tense way. And

329
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:41.709
you can see why, you know, it's a good

330
00:19:41.709 --> 00:19:46.989
shortcut, uh, given the way. Given the way the

331
00:19:46.989 --> 00:19:49.430
physics of the world works and everything, if I

332
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:50.750
did, if we were in like in the same

333
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.719
room and I just Point to some object and

334
00:19:53.719 --> 00:19:57.369
say it's, you know, like blue. Then I don't,

335
00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:58.930
I don't need to, I could say it's blue

336
00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.310
now. I don't need to say, give a whole

337
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.599
elaborate thing about the earlier than later than relations.

338
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.469
Um, And so it's pretty interesting actually because there

339
00:20:10.469 --> 00:20:12.709
you can see a big difference between space and

340
00:20:12.709 --> 00:20:14.989
time and the way we act and think and

341
00:20:14.989 --> 00:20:19.689
talk. Because if I was, uh, suppose, uh, Ricardo,

342
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.160
I was, we were having a dinner and you're

343
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.959
at the opposite side of the table, and I

344
00:20:24.959 --> 00:20:28.140
said, you know, please pass the salt. And you

345
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.780
look around and you're wondering where it is, and

346
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.829
I say, you know, it's on your right. Uh,

347
00:20:32.939 --> 00:20:38.609
SO there I'd be indicating that the spatial indexical

348
00:20:38.609 --> 00:20:41.219
is relative to, you know, I'm understanding that it's

349
00:20:41.219 --> 00:20:44.010
relative to you, might it'll be on my left,

350
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.109
but it might be, it'll be on your right.

351
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.660
That we never do that with time. I don't

352
00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.339
say, oh, it's in your future, not mine, or

353
00:20:54.339 --> 00:20:59.839
your past, not mine. Um, AND so, uh, so

354
00:20:59.839 --> 00:21:03.089
we do use this model, and then you can

355
00:21:03.089 --> 00:21:06.640
then see why, so then the 10th theory of

356
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:12.199
time. Is um Well, so, yeah, so there's, let

357
00:21:12.199 --> 00:21:14.959
me back up a second. So in terms of

358
00:21:14.959 --> 00:21:18.199
language, there's no question we use tenses and we

359
00:21:18.199 --> 00:21:21.959
speak particular ways and we distinguish between what we

360
00:21:21.959 --> 00:21:25.630
might call the spatial tenses and the temporal tenses

361
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.699
in interesting ways. Now what does that mean? Now

362
00:21:30.699 --> 00:21:34.000
sometimes what's called the tense theory of time is

363
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.910
now supposed to then be a theory in metaphysics.

364
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.630
Which then takes those tenses, uh, and thinks of

365
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:45.989
them as latching onto reality in some way. So

366
00:21:45.989 --> 00:21:48.900
whereas relativity doesn't have a kind of privilege now.

367
00:21:49.589 --> 00:21:53.489
A tense model of time and and understood in

368
00:21:53.489 --> 00:21:57.689
a metaphysical way. Yeah, we'll have a uh uh

369
00:21:57.689 --> 00:22:02.300
positive uh special, a special now in some way,

370
00:22:02.869 --> 00:22:07.500
typically. Then they come in all these different varieties

371
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.459
of metaphysical models, so some say there's just this

372
00:22:10.459 --> 00:22:14.780
present. And it changes in some way. Some say

373
00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.170
there's the present, and then there's a real past,

374
00:22:18.339 --> 00:22:21.579
but not a real future. That's called a becoming

375
00:22:21.579 --> 00:22:25.050
model. Then there's all sorts of other models. There's

376
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.949
probably like a couple 100 of them really. Um,

377
00:22:29.959 --> 00:22:33.810
And uh yeah, so that's supposed to then these

378
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:38.430
models are positive to vindicate that way of speaking

379
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.359
that I mentioned.

380
00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:45.140
But even if you, if our intuitive model of

381
00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:49.619
time is incorrect, uh, do we have a good

382
00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:54.630
understanding of how it develops cognitive cognitively?

383
00:22:56.479 --> 00:22:58.949
Yeah, so that's what I, uh, try to do

384
00:22:58.949 --> 00:23:02.229
in my, in my book, uh, what makes time

385
00:23:02.229 --> 00:23:06.310
special is the the whole idea about half of

386
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.180
the book is to Basically try to come up

387
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.619
with an explanation for why, why it is, even

388
00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:15.739
if it's fundamentally wrong, why it nonetheless makes sense

389
00:23:15.739 --> 00:23:17.699
for creatures like us to come up with this

390
00:23:17.699 --> 00:23:23.209
model and to treat the spatial. So tenses uh

391
00:23:23.209 --> 00:23:26.619
differently than the temporal ones or the spatial indexicles

392
00:23:26.619 --> 00:23:30.849
differently than the temporal indexicles. And you know, so

393
00:23:30.849 --> 00:23:34.280
for me, excuse me, for me, I, I think.

394
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:38.380
Yeah, it might be wrong, but given our environment,

395
00:23:38.589 --> 00:23:44.660
given our the our cognitive and perceptual and anatomical

396
00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:48.189
uh situation, the kinds of problems we have to

397
00:23:48.189 --> 00:23:52.099
solve to get around in the world, given the

398
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.770
Physics, where the temporal direction is different than the

399
00:23:56.770 --> 00:24:01.449
spatial direction. Um, AND a whole host of other

400
00:24:01.449 --> 00:24:04.150
things. I try to then show why it makes

401
00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:07.849
sense for us to, uh, Develop this kind of

402
00:24:07.849 --> 00:24:10.949
tense model and so I try to vindicate the

403
00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:15.060
tense model as Even, you know, not fundamentally right,

404
00:24:15.229 --> 00:24:19.099
but uh a really good thing for us, uh,

405
00:24:19.229 --> 00:24:22.589
because it helps us, helps us get around. Um,

406
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:28.829
Yeah, so I, uh, Given the physics and given

407
00:24:28.829 --> 00:24:30.270
a bunch of other things that, you know, I

408
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:33.670
just can't, I just can't move on the spacetime

409
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.430
manifold in ways or have access to information of

410
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:43.790
this on the spacetime manifold. In particular ways. That

411
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:47.469
would, it's so given that, given these constraints, it

412
00:24:47.469 --> 00:24:49.180
makes sense for me to come up with this,

413
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.709
makes sense for human beings, but also I think

414
00:24:51.709 --> 00:24:55.819
animals, uh, probably most animals have. Some kind of

415
00:24:55.819 --> 00:24:59.369
tense conception of time, maybe they don't think about

416
00:24:59.369 --> 00:25:02.760
time, of course, but You know, they don't do

417
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.339
philosophy as far as I know or physics, but,

418
00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:09.229
um, but they still, you know, seem to, there's

419
00:25:09.229 --> 00:25:12.069
some evidence that they employ a kind of the

420
00:25:12.869 --> 00:25:16.949
theory of time as well. And so I think

421
00:25:16.949 --> 00:25:21.219
it's a very It organisms are reacting to a

422
00:25:21.219 --> 00:25:27.760
very Low level basic feature of the universe. And

423
00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:32.540
that is then. You know, creating in them a

424
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.900
uh Reason to think that uh there is this

425
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:42.359
like preferred now. Oh It's a good organization tool

426
00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:45.290
for us. And for most of those sort of

427
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.880
things you As you're sort of navigating around locally.

428
00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.260
You, you know, the signal speeds are are very

429
00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:59.390
fast. And we've become attuned to our, our brains

430
00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:03.030
and our perceptual systems are sort of adapted to.

431
00:26:04.469 --> 00:26:07.189
Try to figure out when the signals that are

432
00:26:07.189 --> 00:26:09.709
reaching us are coming from the same thing or

433
00:26:09.709 --> 00:26:13.859
not. So when somebody is like in front of

434
00:26:13.859 --> 00:26:17.260
you and they say hi. You'll see their lips

435
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.219
move. So then you have the light bouncing off

436
00:26:20.219 --> 00:26:23.150
their lips, going into your eye. So it's going

437
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.989
very fast, the light, you know, the speed of

438
00:26:24.989 --> 00:26:30.359
light, um. Then you'll hear hi. And so then

439
00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:33.359
there'll be sound coming from their mouth, that's then

440
00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:37.469
coming in very, very slowly. Um, BUT your eye

441
00:26:37.469 --> 00:26:42.130
works very slowly versus your ear. So your ear

442
00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:45.469
is kind of mechanical, very fast. Your eye is

443
00:26:45.469 --> 00:26:51.229
photochemical, uh, a bit slower. That's decreasing the, so

444
00:26:51.229 --> 00:26:54.819
if the if the if the if the sound

445
00:26:54.819 --> 00:26:57.060
and the light both came from the same source.

446
00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.239
Now you've already decreased the, the gap between the

447
00:27:01.239 --> 00:27:03.959
arrival of the, the light and the sound to

448
00:27:03.959 --> 00:27:07.040
some extent. Then your brain is doing all this

449
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.510
other stuff too. And so you, there will actually

450
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:15.810
be, you know, some people will. Then bind those

451
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.400
two and think that those two signals came together,

452
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:22.369
um, if the light comes first, or if the

453
00:27:22.369 --> 00:27:24.489
sound comes first, and so there are light firsters

454
00:27:24.489 --> 00:27:29.969
and soundirsters. Uh, BUT basically if. Uh, YOU know,

455
00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.010
if it comes within a certain wind, if these

456
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.810
two signals come within a certain window, you'll tend

457
00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.609
to think that they came from the same, the

458
00:27:36.609 --> 00:27:40.819
same source. You then don't need to know then,

459
00:27:40.829 --> 00:27:42.949
you know, which one is earlier than or which

460
00:27:42.949 --> 00:27:45.579
one is later than you can just say, oh,

461
00:27:45.709 --> 00:27:49.930
you know that. That person said hi now. And

462
00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.530
I don't need, uh, I don't need to relate

463
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:56.670
it to some other events. Um, IF you compare

464
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:00.319
that to like receiving something in the mail. You're

465
00:28:00.319 --> 00:28:04.550
getting your bank statements in the mail. And the

466
00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.260
bank statements didn't say what. You know what time

467
00:28:08.739 --> 00:28:12.239
the the bank statement was for. Then the information

468
00:28:12.239 --> 00:28:15.689
would be pretty useless because maybe the mailman or

469
00:28:15.689 --> 00:28:18.280
mailwoman, you know, put it in the box, you

470
00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.839
know, the wrong, the wrong order or something like

471
00:28:20.839 --> 00:28:24.160
that. And so the signal, the sign, you know,

472
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.000
if the signal takes a long time and has

473
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.579
all these transmission errors. Then you really needed the,

474
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:37.359
the, those letters, the information dated. For high You

475
00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:39.300
know, it said to you in the room, you

476
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.030
don't need to say, you know, OK, Ricardo, let's

477
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:46.859
synchronize watches ready and then hi, uh, you don't

478
00:28:46.859 --> 00:28:48.510
need to do that. You can just say hi

479
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:54.750
and it's understood that it's now. Um, YEAH, and

480
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.750
so I, I look to see why it then

481
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:58.750
makes sense to, you know, so all these sorts

482
00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.469
of considerations. I like to then see why it

483
00:29:01.469 --> 00:29:03.630
would make sense to come up with the, uh,

484
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.540
Uh, this kind of tense model of time and

485
00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:11.290
treated differently than the Corresponding model of space.

486
00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:16.930
I, I guess that also from a biological slash

487
00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:20.839
evolutionary perspective, uh, we have to keep in mind

488
00:29:20.839 --> 00:29:25.339
that what really matters here for organisms like humans

489
00:29:25.339 --> 00:29:27.880
and other kinds of organisms is, is for them

490
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:33.380
to have Uh, useful construct of the world in

491
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.739
ways that increases their fitness, right? I mean, of

492
00:29:36.739 --> 00:29:39.729
course, we don't need to have at all any

493
00:29:39.729 --> 00:29:43.739
direct access to objective reality, and I guess that

494
00:29:43.739 --> 00:29:48.089
in terms of other, um, things that we perceive,

495
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:51.939
like, for example, caller, of course, uh, a physicist

496
00:29:51.939 --> 00:29:56.449
would say that. The color is not uh an

497
00:29:56.449 --> 00:30:01.930
intrinsic property of objects. It's not really there, but

498
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:07.050
it's useful for organisms to perceive it, to move

499
00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.699
in the world and to perhaps eat the correct

500
00:30:10.699 --> 00:30:14.619
things and uh some other aspects of. Uh, THEIR

501
00:30:14.619 --> 00:30:17.310
life where color plays a role. I mean, it's

502
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:23.650
much more about usefulness than necessarily about the truth

503
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:29.099
or at least truth index to uh objective reality,

504
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:32.430
right. Yeah, exactly. Uh, THAT, that's exactly the way

505
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.780
I'm thinking of it. Uh, IN fact, very much

506
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.380
like color. I think of it as a. You

507
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:42.540
know, very low, low level sort of thing, so

508
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.099
that that's why I think animals and that also

509
00:30:45.099 --> 00:30:47.189
have with color, yeah, yeah, so I think of

510
00:30:47.189 --> 00:30:50.180
it very much like color. um, YEAH, and so

511
00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.739
I think of it as, you know, each all

512
00:30:52.739 --> 00:30:56.339
the different animals were all trying to solve this

513
00:30:56.339 --> 00:30:58.900
an evolution, you know, so we're trying to solve

514
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.689
this kind of problem with we're bombarded with all

515
00:31:02.689 --> 00:31:06.489
these signals and the signals don't tell us the

516
00:31:06.489 --> 00:31:09.810
time like a letter does, and so we have

517
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:11.489
to figure it out, but if we don't figure

518
00:31:11.489 --> 00:31:14.530
it out, we'll die. You know, so you need

519
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:19.540
to, if you If you know, a, a, a

520
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.260
tiger comes up and roars at you and you're

521
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:28.050
still, uh, you know, and you're not uh syncing

522
00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:32.160
the visual with the auditory, uh, you know, you

523
00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:36.560
you probably die. And it'll also be very hard

524
00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.900
to catch things. And so, but probably all the

525
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.459
different animals do this differently and so they probably

526
00:31:42.459 --> 00:31:46.979
have different simultaneity windows, you know, so I, in

527
00:31:46.979 --> 00:31:50.939
the book I uh talk about probably the giraffe

528
00:31:50.939 --> 00:31:52.780
has not just a long neck, but a long

529
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.729
now uh because if you just think of how,

530
00:31:56.099 --> 00:31:59.530
how long the The nerves from the feet to

531
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.530
the brain to the brain and back on the

532
00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:04.609
giraffe. And that, it doesn't go that fast, the

533
00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:08.170
signal speeds and the nerves, uh, and so when

534
00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:11.250
you think of it like adjusting its foot, uh,

535
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:14.270
for where, you know, on, on the ground for

536
00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:17.130
bumps on the ground and stuff and it's, you

537
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.479
know, that, that signal is like going like 18

538
00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:23.329
ft or something. And so there's gonna be this

539
00:32:23.329 --> 00:32:27.640
kind of lag, um. And so we, we have

540
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.420
the same kinds of things too, um, but, you

541
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.270
know, the giraffe would be maybe more uh exaggerated.

542
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.930
A seal would be interesting because the speed of

543
00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:41.920
sound, the speed of sound in water is, is

544
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.959
very different than in air. And so all of

545
00:32:44.959 --> 00:32:49.109
these things should should shape the their their um

546
00:32:50.359 --> 00:32:53.589
Um, maybe not there where they don't have a

547
00:32:53.589 --> 00:32:55.589
conception of time, but that maybe the model of

548
00:32:55.589 --> 00:32:58.589
time is very similar to ours, but like the

549
00:32:58.589 --> 00:33:01.949
lengths of the simultaneity windows and things like that

550
00:33:01.949 --> 00:33:04.459
might be very different. Mhm.

551
00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:10.000
And uh getting into a question directly related to

552
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.959
metaphysics, uh, how do you look at the relationship

553
00:33:13.959 --> 00:33:18.060
between uh philosophy of science and in this case,

554
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:23.359
more specifically philosophy of physics and metaphysics?

555
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:30.709
Um, Yeah, I, well I think of Well, that's

556
00:33:30.709 --> 00:33:32.839
a big question. Uh, SO yeah, I think of,

557
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:39.319
uh, I think all of physics as Uh, implicitly

558
00:33:39.609 --> 00:33:46.010
assuming, making very many, um, metaphysical assumptions. Mhm. And

559
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.140
so I, I have a lot, I have a

560
00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.650
bunch of things where I'm criticizing metaphysics, but it's

561
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.569
not that I'm anti-metaphysics because I, I do think

562
00:33:54.569 --> 00:33:56.729
that, you know, when we look at physics, we

563
00:33:56.729 --> 00:33:59.510
can And pry into it, we then see that

564
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.339
there are all these different metaphysical assumptions within it.

565
00:34:03.359 --> 00:34:05.270
And so that's what I'm trying to do is

566
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:10.110
sort of unearth these metaphysical assumptions and uh you

567
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:14.219
know, try to see what the Physics, uh, what

568
00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:19.129
physics is telling us about the universe. Um, But

569
00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:23.870
you know, there are uh there are uh Bits

570
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:28.350
of philosophy, you know, some types of philosophy of

571
00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:32.799
time that I think are um You know, misguided

572
00:34:32.799 --> 00:34:36.289
the way they go, you know, so historically philosophy

573
00:34:36.289 --> 00:34:37.839
of time I think has always been one of

574
00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:42.719
the Methodologically, most I don't know if I should

575
00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:45.929
say this um. A public thing, but yeah, um,

576
00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:50.060
like the the most backward areas. You know, so

577
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.379
for so long, it was just doing, you know,

578
00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:57.780
this kind of uh analytic philosophy, uh, this kind

579
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.419
of ordinary language philosophy where the, the way the

580
00:35:00.419 --> 00:35:03.350
game worked was You would find out what the

581
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:06.070
nature of time was, and, and, and here's how

582
00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:10.080
it would go, you would Um, take a sentence,

583
00:35:10.399 --> 00:35:14.120
you know, in in English or in Portuguese, with

584
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.679
tenses in it, and then see if you could

585
00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:19.830
translate it into a sentence without tenses. And then

586
00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:23.949
if you uh couldn't, then it proved that the

587
00:35:23.949 --> 00:35:27.110
10 theory of time was true and that relativity

588
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:32.090
was wrong or not fundamentally right, uh. This is

589
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:34.330
terrible, you know, why, you know, so we know

590
00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.729
that you can't because of the essential index, we

591
00:35:37.729 --> 00:35:42.030
know that you can't translate. Statements from with indexicals

592
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.909
to, uh, with, you know, you can't translate the

593
00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:48.070
sta uh statements that are in with indexicals into

594
00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:52.959
non-indexicals and retain the same meaning. And You know,

595
00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.850
that argument was always bad anyway, even, you know,

596
00:35:56.139 --> 00:35:58.300
because you could, it would do that, you, you

597
00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.300
know, it would prove too much because, because, you

598
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.100
know, you could do it with other index skills

599
00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.979
like spatial ones and personal pronouns and and things

600
00:36:05.979 --> 00:36:08.820
like that. And so it ends up proving too

601
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.370
much. And so Anyway, so it's like a mugs

602
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:16.189
game. You know, if you got into it because,

603
00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:21.570
you know, if you wanted to. Defend, uh, anything

604
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:23.689
but the tense there of time and you start

605
00:36:23.689 --> 00:36:25.530
to play this game, you were, you were destined

606
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:29.129
to lose, uh, but, you know, the game was

607
00:36:29.129 --> 00:36:32.840
rigged because you could never do this. So they

608
00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.570
changed the rules of the game and maybe the,

609
00:36:37.919 --> 00:36:39.639
you know, started to change it and maybe I

610
00:36:39.639 --> 00:36:42.439
don't know, the 80s and 90s, then people would

611
00:36:42.439 --> 00:36:44.879
say, well, no, now we're interested just in the

612
00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:48.590
truth makers for these claims, not, not translating without

613
00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:54.320
loss of meaning. Um, But you know, still it

614
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:58.719
it it it came down to somewhat. Fairly similar

615
00:36:58.719 --> 00:37:04.100
sort of games still. Um, And then to me,

616
00:37:04.159 --> 00:37:06.330
the big thing has always been that you could

617
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:08.909
posit as many models as you like, all these,

618
00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:13.860
all these really elaborate metaphysical models. But what is

619
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.770
the evidence for those models? What do they explain?

620
00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:21.530
And I've always thought that they were lacking explanatorily.

621
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.540
Uh, SO, the, the core thing really is that

622
00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:28.679
they're all They're all positing some kind of now

623
00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:32.129
or present. And the only difference between the events

624
00:37:32.129 --> 00:37:33.729
that are now and the events that are not

625
00:37:33.729 --> 00:37:36.530
now, they say usually is that the events that

626
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.810
are now exist and the events that are not

627
00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:43.939
now don't exist. Of course, existence is I, you

628
00:37:43.939 --> 00:37:48.100
know, what kind of property is existence? Well, a

629
00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.979
well on the standard way of thinking it's not

630
00:37:49.979 --> 00:37:52.959
a property at all. But even if you took

631
00:37:52.959 --> 00:37:55.320
a view where it's a property, it's, uh, you

632
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.500
know, a property that has no, no character, no,

633
00:37:58.719 --> 00:38:02.199
no, no, no essence to it whatsoever. And so

634
00:38:02.199 --> 00:38:04.600
then, but then how can that feature into the

635
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.199
causal network of the world in any way? And

636
00:38:07.199 --> 00:38:10.129
so it's never gonna be most explanations are causal

637
00:38:10.129 --> 00:38:12.389
explanations, and so you're not going to end up

638
00:38:12.389 --> 00:38:14.280
uh being able to say that there's any kind

639
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:19.820
of causal explanation for why you have the phenomenon

640
00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:23.750
we have or the data we have. Um, SO

641
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:29.429
best, it's gonna vindicate some linguistic intuitions. But I

642
00:38:29.429 --> 00:38:32.919
think it's better to Uh, we'll do what I

643
00:38:32.919 --> 00:38:34.959
try to do, which is just try to show

644
00:38:34.959 --> 00:38:37.879
how this model arises, uh, in order to try

645
00:38:37.879 --> 00:38:39.360
to vindicate those intuitions.

646
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:44.270
So, do you think that when it comes to

647
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:51.030
metaphysics. We should derive metaphysics from physics. I mean,

648
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:55.419
the, in this case, the philosophy from the science

649
00:38:55.669 --> 00:38:57.540
or not necessarily.

650
00:38:58.659 --> 00:39:01.979
Um, YEAH, I don't wanna make it too differential

651
00:39:01.979 --> 00:39:04.439
to physics that uh we just look at the

652
00:39:04.439 --> 00:39:09.610
physics and then Um, You know, derive it from

653
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:13.129
there because I think sometimes the physics is it's

654
00:39:13.129 --> 00:39:15.409
a two-way street and sometimes the physics can be

655
00:39:15.409 --> 00:39:22.479
wrong, I think, or in Not properly interpreted. Um,

656
00:39:23.379 --> 00:39:25.229
So I think it's a two-way street, and of

657
00:39:25.229 --> 00:39:27.750
course there's more the world that the world of

658
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:30.669
science and physics too and there's biology, you know,

659
00:39:30.729 --> 00:39:34.510
and everything else. Um, BUT I do think, you

660
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:36.600
know, there, there has been this kind of trend

661
00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:42.149
in analytic philosophy where uh it's wants to vindicate

662
00:39:42.149 --> 00:39:46.949
the linguistic intuitions too much, doesn't really care about

663
00:39:46.949 --> 00:39:51.399
the, how much it's gonna explain. Now people who

664
00:39:51.399 --> 00:39:54.360
disagree with me will they'll say, oh, but we

665
00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.330
are explaining. You know, just like in science and

666
00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:01.290
science uses all these kind of theoretical virtues like

667
00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:04.659
simplicity and that too. And so they'll say, oh,

668
00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:07.540
we're all just using infants to the best explanation.

669
00:40:08.959 --> 00:40:11.449
I think that that's really, you know, maybe if,

670
00:40:11.669 --> 00:40:15.250
maybe, maybe OK at one level, that's true, but,

671
00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:17.649
you know, if we dive in and and actually

672
00:40:17.649 --> 00:40:23.429
compare that kind of uh just absolutely brutal critical

673
00:40:23.969 --> 00:40:27.290
process that happens in science and just the high,

674
00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:31.090
how high the standards are for scientific theory to

675
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:34.929
actually explain, you know, be taken to explain something.

676
00:40:35.679 --> 00:40:39.219
And then the very modest things that these metaphysical

677
00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:42.090
models end up explaining. You know, then I think

678
00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.439
it's really more like night and day difference uh

679
00:40:44.439 --> 00:40:48.320
than uh doing the same thing. Mhm.

680
00:40:49.219 --> 00:40:52.350
So, let me then just ask you one last

681
00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:56.750
question. We've been focusing our conversation a lot on

682
00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.040
time, but uh looking at physics more generally and

683
00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.560
as a philosopher of physics, what would you say

684
00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.320
are perhaps some of the biggest or at least

685
00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.560
what you consider to be the most interesting unanswered

686
00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.360
questions in physics?

687
00:41:15.899 --> 00:41:21.360
Oh, Uh, well, yeah, I'd have to start with

688
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:26.000
all the puzzles, you know, that quantum mechanics provides,

689
00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.560
you know, so we have massive. Debates and disagreements

690
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.149
over what to make of, you know, quantum non-locality

691
00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:40.750
and um Uh, you know, just, uh, the measurement

692
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:46.449
problem. And so I think that resolving those are

693
00:41:46.449 --> 00:41:50.679
key to Uh, you know, many other things, you

694
00:41:50.679 --> 00:41:53.620
know, so that what's happened is we've, that kind

695
00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.760
of foundational philosophical questions have been sort of shunted

696
00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.669
aside for a long time. And you know, so

697
00:42:00.669 --> 00:42:06.300
you've had the Copenhagen kind of understanding of quantum

698
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.709
mechanics, making it so that you're not able to

699
00:42:08.709 --> 00:42:10.389
ask, you know, you're not supposed to ask a

700
00:42:10.389 --> 00:42:13.030
lot of questions about the awkward questions about what's

701
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:16.469
going on. But then when you look at um

702
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.270
You know, you're trying to develop quantum gravity, and

703
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:21.989
come up with a theory that will uni, you

704
00:42:21.989 --> 00:42:25.310
know, or make consistent gravity with uh quantum mechanics.

705
00:42:26.409 --> 00:42:29.159
It seems crazy to me to think that what

706
00:42:29.159 --> 00:42:32.989
quantum theory of quantum mechanics is is actually right,

707
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.010
won't matter to that question. And so you're sort

708
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:41.209
of trying to you know, produce this consistent or

709
00:42:41.209 --> 00:42:44.689
unified new theory, but you've got your hands tied

710
00:42:44.689 --> 00:42:46.729
behind your back because you're not allowed to speak

711
00:42:46.729 --> 00:42:50.639
about what 111 half of that equation, you know,

712
00:42:50.649 --> 00:42:53.100
what, what that world is really like. And so

713
00:42:55.989 --> 00:42:59.320
I think understanding better quantum nonlocality is, is really

714
00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.830
one way uh this quantum no locality comes up

715
00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:07.139
in. And a lot of that, uh, but the

716
00:43:07.139 --> 00:43:10.350
really the the correct interpretation of the quantum mechanics

717
00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:15.989
is really one of the core things. Um, But

718
00:43:15.989 --> 00:43:19.350
yeah, there, there's so many other uh questions too,

719
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.860
uh, but that's just one.

720
00:43:22.719 --> 00:43:24.840
Yeah, but, but that, OK, so let me just

721
00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:28.540
ask you a more specific thing then. Do you

722
00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:32.179
think that at this point we would be anywhere

723
00:43:32.179 --> 00:43:37.459
close to finally developing uh or having a theory

724
00:43:37.459 --> 00:43:41.090
of everything, uh, or, uh, I guess at least,

725
00:43:41.419 --> 00:43:45.419
uh, following, I guess the main line that people

726
00:43:45.419 --> 00:43:51.939
have been proposing anywhere near unifying uh relativity with

727
00:43:51.939 --> 00:43:54.899
quantum mechanics or not?

728
00:43:55.679 --> 00:43:58.739
Yeah, I don't think we're any closer than we've

729
00:43:58.739 --> 00:44:01.290
been for, and we haven't been close, I think,

730
00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:04.550
for, you know, to a theory of everything. Um,

731
00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.010
I mean, even Hawking gave up on the idea

732
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:11.469
that there could be a theory of everything. Um,

733
00:44:11.479 --> 00:44:13.260
AND so I'm not even convinced that there could

734
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.879
be a theory of everything. Um, BUT we could

735
00:44:16.879 --> 00:44:20.459
hope for a theory of quantum gravity. But now,

736
00:44:20.659 --> 00:44:22.409
but boy, now that's been a long, long time

737
00:44:22.409 --> 00:44:24.330
that people have been trying to work on that

738
00:44:24.489 --> 00:44:27.270
and it doesn't seem like we're any, you know,

739
00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:32.209
the different research programs of Become far more developed

740
00:44:32.209 --> 00:44:35.510
than they were, like when I started in. Grad

741
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.879
school, you know, now. The different programs are much

742
00:44:38.879 --> 00:44:42.000
more sophisticated than they were, uh, but you can't

743
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.389
really say that there's any closer to. Um, You

744
00:44:46.389 --> 00:44:50.080
know, it being decided which one is the right

745
00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.739
one or or. Or connecting it with experiments in

746
00:44:53.739 --> 00:44:56.860
any way, and so we still seem very far

747
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.169
away.

748
00:44:59.149 --> 00:45:02.330
Great. So, uh, and where can people find you

749
00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:04.389
