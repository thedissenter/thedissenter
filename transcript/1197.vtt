00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.450
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.679
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lobsson. Today

3
00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:10.199
I'm joined by Doctor Mark Wicklair. He's professor of

4
00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.800
philosophy emeritus at West Virginia University, and today we're

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.760
going to talk about his book Conscientious Objection in

6
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.799
Medicine. So Mark, welcome to the show. It's a

7
00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:22.799
pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.850
Well, thank you for inviting me.

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.469
So let's start perhaps with a definition or at

10
00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:34.669
least an understanding of the main subject we're going

11
00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:38.110
to tackle today. So what is conscientious objection?

12
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.310
Well, conscientious objection essentially is a refusal to provide

13
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.939
services, um, and in the case of healthcare, it

14
00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:53.209
would be healthcare services. Uh, A refusal that is

15
00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:58.930
based on um the provider's ethical beliefs, and those

16
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.889
ethical beliefs can either be based on just straightforward

17
00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:06.910
secular principles, um, or they can be based on

18
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.809
religious principles. But the important, really essential characteristic of

19
00:01:12.809 --> 00:01:16.809
a conscientious objection or a conscientious refusal to provide

20
00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:21.370
a service is that it is based on the

21
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.410
provider's ethical beliefs because there are a lot of

22
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.660
other reasons for refusing to provide medical services. Um.

23
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.330
So, for example, surgeons frequently will just say, um,

24
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.430
well, if, if a patient requests a, uh, let's

25
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.510
say brain surgery for a brain tumor, the surgeon

26
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.349
can simply respond, well, I'm sorry, but it's not

27
00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:49.709
operable. And that's not based on ethical beliefs, but

28
00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:56.069
it's based on uh clinical criteria. Um, ANOTHER possible

29
00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.150
reason, um, is, for example, in relation even to

30
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.389
abortion, um, the provider's refusal may be based on

31
00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:10.610
a concern about their own health or well-being. Um,

32
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.570
SO in the US at least, there have been

33
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.100
some cases where abortion providers have been subject to

34
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.820
violence and in some cases actually killed. So, an

35
00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:28.630
OBGYN who has absolutely no moral objection to abortion

36
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.009
might simply refuse to provide it out of a

37
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:37.009
concern for their own, their own safety. Then the

38
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:42.050
providers can refuse to provide requested services, um, for

39
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.869
financial reasons. And again, in the US at least,

40
00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:50.270
um, there are reimbursements for um the Medicaid program.

41
00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:55.039
Uh, WHICH, uh, are quite low. And so some

42
00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.339
providers just simply say, well, I'm not going to

43
00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:04.440
treat, um, patients on Medicare or Medicaid because it's

44
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.639
just not worthwhile for me. Uh, OTHER reasons include

45
00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:16.240
it's contrary to professional, uh, professional codes, uh, and

46
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.320
that would subject them to disciplinary action and they

47
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.639
want to avoid that. And another one finally is

48
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.679
that it's illegal in the jurisdiction that they're in.

49
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.580
And so again, it's not that they have a

50
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.449
moral objection to providing the service, it's that it,

51
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.179
it's illegal. So that's why it's so important to

52
00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:45.699
keep in mind that in the cases of conscientious

53
00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:51.839
objection, The objection is based on moral beliefs.

54
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.649
Right, uh, so we're going to tackle conscientious objection

55
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.910
from a philosophical perspective, but it can also be

56
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.509
a legal concept. So what are the differences between

57
00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:11.429
how conscientious objection is approached in the law and

58
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.050
how it is approached in ethics?

59
00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:19.358
Well, actually, the two approaches are similar in at

60
00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:24.908
least one respect. And that respect is, um, the,

61
00:04:24.989 --> 00:04:30.648
the challenge in both cases is to uh strike

62
00:04:30.908 --> 00:04:36.968
some sort of balance between two competing interests. Um,

63
00:04:37.348 --> 00:04:42.989
ONE is a physician's interest in, uh, practicing medicine.

64
00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:46.609
Which is in a way that's consistent with their

65
00:04:46.609 --> 00:04:51.809
ethical beliefs. And the other category of interest are

66
00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:57.350
patients' interest in having timely and convenient access to

67
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.390
uh healthcare services that they want. So in both

68
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.850
cases, in the law and in ethics, and uh

69
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.390
the, the primary challenge is how one strikes that

70
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.839
balance. Um, NOW, the primary difference, I think, is

71
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.730
It's only in the case of ethical approaches that

72
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:26.380
striking that balance requires ethical justification and is ethical

73
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.209
guidance. In the case of law, that's not a,

74
00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:32.570
that's not a requirement, but in the case of

75
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.790
ethical considerations, it is.

76
00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:41.329
So in the book you distinguish between conscientious objection

77
00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:45.130
and a few other concepts in bioethics which can

78
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.130
be similar to it or at least adjacent to

79
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.929
it. Let's start with conscientious provision. What is that?

80
00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:58.890
So conscientious uh provision is really some, uh, it,

81
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.269
it's also an appeal to conscience. But it's the

82
00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:09.679
reverse of conscientious objection. Um, CONSCIENTIOUS objection is a

83
00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:16.540
refusal. To provide requested services based on one's ethical

84
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:23.190
beliefs. In the case of conscientious provision. It's in

85
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.489
situations where certain services are prohibited. It can be

86
00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:34.339
prohibited by institutional, uh, uh, policies. It can be

87
00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:38.410
prohibited by law. It can be, uh, prohibited by,

88
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:45.519
um, uh, professional organizations, codes of ethics, but it's

89
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:52.660
prohibited. To provide the service. And physicians believe now

90
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.279
in this case, well, they have an ethical obligation

91
00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.890
to provide it. And at least in the US

92
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.540
this comes up now quite frequently with respect to

93
00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:10.570
abortion post the Dobbs decision. That's the Supreme Court

94
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:16.609
decision that overturned Roe versus Wade. So now abortion

95
00:07:16.609 --> 00:07:20.920
is no longer a constitutionally protected right in the

96
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.130
US, which means that states can pass a number

97
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:31.760
of restrictions. ON abortion. Uh, SOME outlaw it completely.

98
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.000
Some have, uh, restrictions that are, are, are, are

99
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.019
quite, quite restrictive. Um, AND then for, uh, OBGYNs,

100
00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:47.959
um, might believe, well, even though it's illegal. To

101
00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:51.760
provide an abortion in this case, the well-being of

102
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.260
my patient requires it. Uh, SHE'S at, at risk

103
00:07:56.399 --> 00:08:00.399
of severe morbidity or mortality if I don't provide

104
00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:05.200
it. Um, AND so conscientious provision then would be,

105
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:12.160
well, um, my conscience tells me I have an

106
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.480
obligation to provide it. And then the question is,

107
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.799
how is that dealt with? But that's, that's, as

108
00:08:20.799 --> 00:08:25.200
I said, it's the reverse of conscientious, um, of

109
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.720
conscientious objection. Another, uh, fairly frequent case again in

110
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:36.460
the United States, uh, is, um, the procedure of,

111
00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:42.318
uh, providing gender-affirming care to adolescents. And in that

112
00:08:42.318 --> 00:08:44.318
case, there are a number of states, I think

113
00:08:44.318 --> 00:08:51.119
um now about 26 states that prohibit providing gender-affirming

114
00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:56.698
care to adolescents, uh, even with parental um approval.

115
00:08:57.549 --> 00:08:59.700
And now there are a number of physicians and

116
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.030
a number of professional organizations um that take the

117
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:09.130
view that, well, but these procedures, in some cases,

118
00:09:09.909 --> 00:09:13.929
Um, are absolutely essential for the health and well-being

119
00:09:14.349 --> 00:09:19.750
of adolescents and patients. And again, uh, in cases

120
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:23.869
where it's in states where it's illegal, there still

121
00:09:23.869 --> 00:09:29.030
is a belief among, uh, providers that they are

122
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:34.109
violating their obligations to their patients uh if they

123
00:09:34.109 --> 00:09:35.669
don't provide those services.

124
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.760
And what is conscience? What does that mean?

125
00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:47.599
Well, conscience, uh, is a very complex concept. There

126
00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:52.359
are a number of different interpretations of it, conceptions

127
00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:57.799
of conscience. Um, TO some extent, the different conceptions

128
00:09:57.799 --> 00:10:02.590
of conscience can be distinguished by, um. The kind

129
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.830
of questions they ask, they can ask questions that

130
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.679
are uh more metaphysical, like what is the nature

131
00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:13.150
of conscience, uh, what is the function of conscience,

132
00:10:13.229 --> 00:10:18.070
what kind of entity is conscience. Um, THEY, they

133
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:23.539
can uh differ on answers to epistemological questions, uh,

134
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:28.010
you know, what is the epistemological status of conscience?

135
00:10:28.229 --> 00:10:32.169
Um, IS it? Is it an ethical guide at

136
00:10:32.169 --> 00:10:35.690
all? And if it is an ethical guide, is

137
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:43.239
it a reliable ethical guide? Um, uh, NOW, there

138
00:10:43.239 --> 00:10:47.400
are different answers to those kinds of questions. Another

139
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.559
question that's asked is, uh, what's the origin of

140
00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:54.719
conscience? And some, some views say, well, it's basically,

141
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.919
uh, comes from God. The conscience is the voice

142
00:10:57.919 --> 00:11:01.960
of God. Those are religious conceptions of conscience. Um.

143
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.590
Now, I think one way of understanding conscience was

144
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:12.929
that without getting into this very complex philosophical debate

145
00:11:13.429 --> 00:11:18.010
about how we should understand con uh conscience, um,

146
00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:21.369
is to think of conscience, at least in the,

147
00:11:21.789 --> 00:11:26.270
when we're, when we're, um, analyzing conscientious objection in

148
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:31.820
healthcare. IS to think of it as a physician's.

149
00:11:33.219 --> 00:11:39.849
MORAL compass. Or if you will, moral GPS.

150
00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:45.619
OK. Uh, A third concept that you explore in

151
00:11:45.619 --> 00:11:49.419
the book is moral complicity. What is that?

152
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:57.219
Moral complicity, um, really what that is, is a

153
00:11:57.219 --> 00:12:03.270
belief that it's not just direct provision. Of a

154
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:10.309
service, whether it's abortion or contraception or medical assistance

155
00:12:10.309 --> 00:12:14.390
in dying, it's not just the direct provision of

156
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:19.400
that, that is contrary to a person's conscience. But

157
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:25.190
it's any involvement at all. In the provision or

158
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:31.650
facilitation of that service. So this would extend then

159
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:40.549
conscientious objection to, for example, referring. To, um. Uh,

160
00:12:41.049 --> 00:12:46.489
INFORMING patients of the availability of, of a, of

161
00:12:46.489 --> 00:12:52.190
a medical service. Um, IT has extended, uh, to

162
00:12:52.690 --> 00:13:00.090
non-physicians, nurses, um, aides in, in, in the, in

163
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:04.809
the, uh, sense that nurses have sometimes refused on

164
00:13:04.809 --> 00:13:09.130
the grounds of complicity, um. To be involved in

165
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:16.659
pre-abortion care or post-abortion care. Um, SOME, in, to,

166
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.840
to extend it even further, uh, aides have and

167
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.580
have objected, um, in doing it, cleaning instruments or

168
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:34.130
providing instruments. Uh, FILE clerks have objected. Um, AMBULANCE

169
00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:41.039
drivers have objected to transporting. Patients to abortion clinics.

170
00:13:41.619 --> 00:13:46.159
Um, SO complicity then is just the view that

171
00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:54.130
any involvement. Can be perceived. As being a moral

172
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:59.409
wrong, even if it's not directly involved in providing

173
00:13:59.409 --> 00:14:00.630
that service.

174
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.659
So, so one final concept before we move on

175
00:14:05.659 --> 00:14:09.059
to other topics, what is moral integrity?

176
00:14:11.469 --> 00:14:17.510
Moral integrity, uh, again, like most philosophical concepts, uh,

177
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.289
there are a number of different conceptions of it.

178
00:14:20.989 --> 00:14:27.380
Um, MY conception focuses on What I call core

179
00:14:27.719 --> 00:14:32.719
moral beliefs. Um, AND that's sort of the notion

180
00:14:32.719 --> 00:14:38.719
that, um, individuals who have core moral beliefs, these

181
00:14:38.719 --> 00:14:44.000
are beliefs that are just very deep-seated to them.

182
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.780
In a way, they're connected with their sense of

183
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:54.510
who they're, they are, with their identity. Um, AND

184
00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:01.440
their integrity, their moral integrity involves acting in accordance

185
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.770
with those core ethical beliefs. So an example of

186
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:11.729
how a provider might think that providing a medical

187
00:15:11.729 --> 00:15:15.809
service is contrary to their core moral beliefs or

188
00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:19.210
moral integrity, uh, in the case of, let's say,

189
00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:23.609
medical assistance in dying, would be if the provider

190
00:15:23.609 --> 00:15:29.510
were to sort of believe that providing this service

191
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:34.640
is just something they can't live with. Um, IT'S

192
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:40.750
contrary to their understanding of who they are. Um,

193
00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:45.049
AND in that sense of their identity. And, and

194
00:15:45.049 --> 00:15:48.969
so for me at least, or my, my, my

195
00:15:48.969 --> 00:15:58.580
analysis, uh, to protect one's integrity. Um, REQUIRES acting

196
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.419
in accordance with one's core ethical beliefs and undermining

197
00:16:05.479 --> 00:16:08.760
and, and to, um, act contrary to those core

198
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:15.179
ethical beliefs undermines one, one's, uh, integrity. And I

199
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:21.500
make this distinction between More where moral integrity is

200
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:27.419
at stake, and it's. Simply what I call peripheral

201
00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:30.570
moral beliefs. Um, YOU know, like there are a

202
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.750
lot of things in life, um, that we find

203
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:37.679
unfair or unjust, and we just live with them.

204
00:16:37.849 --> 00:16:39.780
You know, we sort of say, well, you know,

205
00:16:39.929 --> 00:16:43.130
the world is unjust, uh, and we have to

206
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.849
kind of, um, um, accommodate that in our lives,

207
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.489
or, or we, we go to use the technical

208
00:16:50.489 --> 00:16:56.030
term, crazy. Um, WHEREAS core moral beliefs are, are

209
00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:00.840
not that easily, uh, disregardable because they do cut

210
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.919
to the core of who we think we are.

211
00:17:04.689 --> 00:17:10.130
And that is what involves uh integrity, moral integrity.

212
00:17:11.499 --> 00:17:16.338
So all of these concepts, conscientious provision, conscience, moral

213
00:17:16.338 --> 00:17:20.358
complicity, and moral integrity, do they play a role

214
00:17:20.358 --> 00:17:24.338
in conscientious objection? Do they relate to it in

215
00:17:24.338 --> 00:17:24.878
some way?

216
00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:31.168
Yes, absolutely. Um, AND, you know, as I said,

217
00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:38.279
when it comes to conscientious objection, um, the kind

218
00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:43.930
of the strongest claims that providers would have. For

219
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:50.140
accommodation. Uh, ARE those that are based on, uh,

220
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:56.530
protecting one's moral integrity. Uh, THERE are a lot

221
00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:02.060
of other reasons for accommodating conscientious objection in healthcare,

222
00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:06.030
but at least I think that the primary reason

223
00:18:06.599 --> 00:18:09.530
is its connection to moral integrity.

224
00:18:10.699 --> 00:18:13.880
Mhm. And what would you say are the main

225
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:19.209
ethical controversies surrounding conscientious objection in medicine?

226
00:18:20.589 --> 00:18:24.349
Well, one of the basic ones is whether it

227
00:18:24.349 --> 00:18:28.229
should be tolerated at all. Uh, AND there are

228
00:18:28.229 --> 00:18:33.989
some, uh, writers on conscientious objection in healthcare who

229
00:18:33.989 --> 00:18:38.229
take the extreme position that no, it just shouldn't

230
00:18:38.229 --> 00:18:42.089
be accommodated. Um, SO that's a, a sort of

231
00:18:42.089 --> 00:18:45.150
what I'd say as a, as a threshold question

232
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.369
or a threshold controversy. Uh, SHOULD it be tolerated

233
00:18:49.369 --> 00:18:53.800
at all? Uh, AMONG those who think it should

234
00:18:53.800 --> 00:19:01.800
be tolerated. Um, THEN the controversy centers on, well,

235
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:07.060
OK, it should be tolerated, but what should be

236
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:13.239
required. Of physicians who are accommodated, who are permitted

237
00:19:13.439 --> 00:19:18.239
to refuse to provide services. And then there's debates

238
00:19:18.239 --> 00:19:23.380
about, well, OK, should they be required to um

239
00:19:23.869 --> 00:19:30.160
refer. Patients to to providers who will provide the

240
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.459
service. Should they be required at least to inform

241
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.680
patients of the availability, even though they won't provide

242
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.680
it? Should they make sure that patients at least

243
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.000
are aware of the fact that these services are

244
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.219
available? And there have been studies uh related to

245
00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:58.359
the um. Uh, SO-CALLED morning after pill or Plan

246
00:19:58.359 --> 00:20:03.349
B or Ella, um, where patients who come into

247
00:20:03.349 --> 00:20:10.119
emergency departments, uh, rape victims, um, actually are not

248
00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:13.079
aware of the fact that there is emergency contraception.

249
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.910
And um so the question then would be, well,

250
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.849
in cases like that or to make sure that

251
00:20:21.849 --> 00:20:26.310
patients do have awareness of at least the availability,

252
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.030
should there be an, a requirement to at least

253
00:20:30.489 --> 00:20:33.810
inform patients, say, well, there is this service, I

254
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.829
won't provide it, but there is this service. Um,

255
00:20:38.489 --> 00:20:42.670
THEN there's a question of um whether or not.

256
00:20:44.189 --> 00:20:52.650
Um, PROVIDERS should be required to justify. Their refusal.

257
00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:55.849
Um, Should we just take them on their word

258
00:20:55.989 --> 00:20:59.750
that it's contrary to their conscience, or should we

259
00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:04.849
require them to at least provide some justification for

260
00:21:05.069 --> 00:21:10.290
that refusal? Uh, WHERE we would scrutinize their beliefs,

261
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.459
their moral beliefs, and see whether or not they

262
00:21:13.459 --> 00:21:19.170
can give, um, a plausible, acceptable defense of those,

263
00:21:19.619 --> 00:21:23.819
uh, of those beliefs. Um, THOSE are some of

264
00:21:23.819 --> 00:21:28.000
the kind of major controversies that, that still remain.

265
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:35.069
Um, AGAIN, once the threshold is crossed. And um

266
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:41.420
at least there's some acknowledgement that, that, um, uh,

267
00:21:41.439 --> 00:21:45.229
conscientious objection should be accommodated. Oh, I should add,

268
00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:51.160
uh, one other controversy is about, um, advanced notification.

269
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.270
And that is whether or not uh physicians who

270
00:21:55.270 --> 00:22:01.339
conscientiously object have an obligation. Um, LET'S say within

271
00:22:01.339 --> 00:22:06.510
institutions to inform supervisors in advance, uh, rather than

272
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:10.880
at the last minute. Um, AND whether or not

273
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.819
there's an obligation to inform patients, uh, in advance

274
00:22:16.319 --> 00:22:20.359
so that it's not, uh, after the patient, uh,

275
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:25.199
well, after the patient-physician relationship is already established, and

276
00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:29.050
then after the patient requests the service. Um, THE

277
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:33.660
controversy is, well, should those kinds of situations be

278
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.500
avoided if, if possible by, um, requiring physicians to

279
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.979
make it clear to patients, um, ideally in advance

280
00:22:42.979 --> 00:22:48.930
of even, um, forming that relationship that they, uh,

281
00:22:48.939 --> 00:22:50.939
object to it. Uh, AND there are a number

282
00:22:50.939 --> 00:22:54.239
of ways of doing that. Uh, ONE could post,

283
00:22:54.540 --> 00:23:00.699
uh, online. Uh, SOME notification that, that this particular

284
00:23:00.699 --> 00:23:05.900
person doesn't provide certain services. Um, THIS could be

285
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.300
done at the time that patients request the first

286
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.280
appointment. Um, BUT there are a number of different,

287
00:23:13.459 --> 00:23:16.500
you know, uh, views about that, and again, that's

288
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.380
a, that's a controversial issue.

289
00:23:19.719 --> 00:23:22.560
So let me ask you about one of the

290
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.880
controversies you focus on the most in your book,

291
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.880
and it has to do with whether conscientious objection

292
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.099
is compatible with physicians' professional obligations. Could you explain

293
00:23:35.099 --> 00:23:36.160
that controversy?

294
00:23:37.739 --> 00:23:44.459
Sure. Well, that controversy um typically arises um in

295
00:23:44.459 --> 00:23:49.300
the context of uh those who object to conscientious

296
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:54.069
objection in healthcare. Um, AND one of the primary,

297
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:59.369
uh, reasons they have for objection is to claim

298
00:23:59.369 --> 00:24:04.349
that conscientious objection is contrary to the professional obligations

299
00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:11.910
of physicians. Um, AND so that really requires some

300
00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:17.800
analysis of what those professional obligations are. And those

301
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.839
who argue that it's um an incompatible with professional

302
00:24:22.839 --> 00:24:28.280
obligations, typically cite um what is, uh, I think

303
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:33.040
a, a widely recognized general principle in healthcare and

304
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.079
not just in medicine, also in nursing, also in

305
00:24:36.079 --> 00:24:41.369
pharmacy, um, which is to put patients' interests first.

306
00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:49.939
Uh, PUT patients, uh, interests, well-being first. And so

307
00:24:49.939 --> 00:24:54.060
that leads, I think, to the, at least those

308
00:24:54.060 --> 00:25:00.449
who object to conscientious objection, then simply assume. That

309
00:25:00.449 --> 00:25:05.589
this principle. What I refer to as the patient's

310
00:25:05.589 --> 00:25:10.829
interest first principle, um, just rules out conscientious objection

311
00:25:10.829 --> 00:25:15.750
because physicians who conscientiously object are putting their interests

312
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:21.660
above patients' interests. Um, AND I think that reflects

313
00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:28.479
a failure. To provide a plausible specification of this

314
00:25:28.479 --> 00:25:32.819
principle. Um, AGAIN, I think it is a widely

315
00:25:32.819 --> 00:25:39.699
held principle, but it's extremely general and vague. And

316
00:25:39.699 --> 00:25:46.819
surely, it cannot require physicians to totally disregard their

317
00:25:46.819 --> 00:25:51.660
interests. Um, IF that were the case, physicians couldn't

318
00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.640
take vacations. They couldn't say, I don't, uh, I,

319
00:25:55.699 --> 00:25:58.339
I won't come to your house. They couldn't say,

320
00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.020
um, I don't, I, I, I'm not, uh, you

321
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.079
know, I'm not available on weekends, um. They would

322
00:26:07.079 --> 00:26:10.599
basically be the slaves of patients, and that's, that's

323
00:26:10.599 --> 00:26:14.530
clearly implausible. So there have to be some kind

324
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:19.400
of boundaries. To this notion And that, it seems

325
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:24.680
to me, is the major, a major question in

326
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:30.260
relation to conscientious objection is what is a plausible

327
00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:37.339
specification of this principle, and then examine the implications

328
00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:44.339
of this plausibly specified principle for conscientious objection. And

329
00:26:44.339 --> 00:26:48.699
at least my view is that um that there

330
00:26:48.699 --> 00:26:54.099
is no plausible specification of this principle that would

331
00:26:54.099 --> 00:27:00.540
rule out in principle conscientious objection. At most, what

332
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:05.339
it would require um are some require some specific

333
00:27:05.339 --> 00:27:12.709
requirements among objectors to qualify for conscientious objections. And

334
00:27:12.709 --> 00:27:15.380
again, that goes back to a question we considered

335
00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:19.410
before, which is what are some of the requirements

336
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:25.989
or constraints that might apply to conscientious objectors in

337
00:27:25.989 --> 00:27:29.040
terms of referral, in terms of informing, in terms

338
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.819
of advanced notification, and so on.

339
00:27:33.579 --> 00:27:35.540
So let me ask you a little bit more

340
00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.500
about the compatibist and the incompatible position as you

341
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.300
referred to them there, because there are people, as

342
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:46.979
you said, that think that conscientious objection is compatible

343
00:27:46.979 --> 00:27:50.219
with physicians' professional obligations, and there are people who

344
00:27:50.219 --> 00:27:55.140
think that it is incompatible. Starting with the incompatible

345
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:59.619
position, what do you think are the main issues

346
00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:00.140
with it?

347
00:28:01.829 --> 00:28:07.229
Well, the incompatibleness, um, it seems to me rely

348
00:28:07.229 --> 00:28:14.670
heavily on, um, the professional or the, the alleged

349
00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:20.660
professional obligations of physicians. And so, uh, as I've

350
00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.170
already said, one of the issues there as well,

351
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:28.880
uh, to provide some specification. Of those professional obligations,

352
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.280
uh, obligations, and not just this general vague notion

353
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:39.130
of putting patients' interests first. Um, AND I think

354
00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:46.369
the second issue is that incompatibles, um, tend to

355
00:28:46.369 --> 00:28:54.310
focus, um, on the fact that, that physicians are

356
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:59.930
professionals. And as such have professional obligations. But I

357
00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:04.770
think what they give, what they give inadequate attention

358
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:10.949
to is that, yes, physicians are professionals. They do

359
00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:16.209
have professional obligations, but they're also moral agents. Um,

360
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:22.949
AND, uh, along with moral agency comes, um, a

361
00:29:23.219 --> 00:29:30.599
some sphere of, um, Of what? Of autonomy in

362
00:29:30.599 --> 00:29:36.209
which one can make moral judgments. Um, AND, and

363
00:29:36.209 --> 00:29:39.290
that I think is, is given, is, is not

364
00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:43.089
given sufficient attention by incompatibles.

365
00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:48.030
And in the case of compatible lists, you explore

366
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:52.790
the challenge for those who support a reason giving

367
00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.910
requirement. Could you explain that challenge?

368
00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:01.020
OK. So, um, I think there are a number

369
00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:07.660
of reasons to question the, uh, uh, uh, reason-giving

370
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.920
requirement. Again, and that would, that would be a

371
00:30:11.339 --> 00:30:17.180
public justification. Of a refusal to provide a particular

372
00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:25.060
service. Now, one problem with that view. Um, IT'S

373
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:35.229
not clear that providing a justification. Um, IS a

374
00:30:35.229 --> 00:30:39.060
requirement, it is, is a justifiable or defensible requirement.

375
00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:45.510
Now, I'm a philosopher and I'm a teacher. And

376
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:51.869
I certainly value the ability to provide justifications for

377
00:30:51.869 --> 00:30:57.859
one's beliefs and to critically analyze one's beliefs. But

378
00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:02.709
my, my kind of issue is, my question is,

379
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:07.430
should that be a requirement in relation to conscientious

380
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:18.089
objection? And if, as I maintain, Um, protecting. Physicians'

381
00:31:18.089 --> 00:31:23.329
ability to practice medicine consistent with their core moral

382
00:31:23.329 --> 00:31:26.969
beliefs and their moral integrity. If that's an aim.

383
00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:34.790
Of of tolerating conscientious objection. Um, OF accommodation. Then

384
00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:38.709
it seems to me that it's unclear that we

385
00:31:38.709 --> 00:31:45.760
should probe into their justifications. Why? Well, because their

386
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.400
moral integrity is at stake, right? If those are

387
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:54.400
their, their core moral beliefs. If they have that

388
00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:59.640
importance to the physician. Then it seems to me,

389
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.900
if we want to protect moral integrity. If we

390
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.579
want to give providers some space in which to

391
00:32:07.579 --> 00:32:13.680
practice medicine consistent with maintaining their moral integrity, consistent

392
00:32:13.979 --> 00:32:17.339
with their moral, with their core moral beliefs, then

393
00:32:17.339 --> 00:32:22.020
it's just, as I said, unclear that giving that

394
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:30.189
this requirement to provide a justification is defensible. Another

395
00:32:30.729 --> 00:32:34.589
problem I have with a reason, public reason giving

396
00:32:34.969 --> 00:32:43.839
justification. I That It, in some cases, it, it

397
00:32:43.839 --> 00:32:47.939
might be construed as a violation of, of privacy.

398
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:56.140
Um, Physicians might be reluctant. I mean, in one

399
00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.150
case, they might lack the ability to provide, right,

400
00:32:59.219 --> 00:33:04.500
the, the critical philosophical skills to provide a justification

401
00:33:04.719 --> 00:33:09.579
that's at least acceptable to whoever is um reviewing

402
00:33:09.579 --> 00:33:16.099
them. Um, BUT another, another possibility is they don't

403
00:33:16.099 --> 00:33:20.369
want to. Um, BECAUSE they've hold these beliefs as

404
00:33:20.369 --> 00:33:23.979
being very personal, and this could be specifically in,

405
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:28.209
in relation to religious beliefs that they just don't

406
00:33:28.209 --> 00:33:31.150
want to disclose that. They don't want to be

407
00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:39.719
cross-examined about those very intimate personal beliefs. And, and

408
00:33:39.719 --> 00:33:49.750
finally, um, I worry. That requiring Physicians, conscientious objectors.

409
00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:56.579
To provide a justification to someone else. Whether it

410
00:33:56.579 --> 00:34:02.859
be uh an administrator, um, a department head, or

411
00:34:02.859 --> 00:34:09.188
as some have proposed a tribunal. Um, THAT a

412
00:34:09.188 --> 00:34:13.929
requirement to provide a justification that satisfies someone else.

413
00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:23.860
Might introduce arbitrariness. And subjectivity. Into whether or not

414
00:34:24.958 --> 00:34:29.478
conscientious objectors are accommodated because what is acceptable to

415
00:34:29.478 --> 00:34:32.840
me may not be acceptable to you in terms

416
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:38.978
of a justification, and it may, you know, introduce

417
00:34:38.978 --> 00:34:43.280
in that way bias, and that I think it

418
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:48.179
would be, uh, would be a mistake and regrettable,

419
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:54.810
and I worry that Um, that is unavoidable if,

420
00:34:55.030 --> 00:35:00.270
if we require, again, if we require, um, physicians,

421
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:06.469
objectors to provide a justification, which whoever it is

422
00:35:06.469 --> 00:35:11.350
that's reviewing this justification finds acceptable.

423
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:19.179
When it comes to requiring conscientious objectors to inform

424
00:35:19.399 --> 00:35:22.820
and refer patients, what would you say are the

425
00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:27.219
main arguments for and against those kinds of requirements?

426
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.060
Well, I think the main argument for those kinds

427
00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:39.429
of requirements um is a concern about patients. And

428
00:35:39.429 --> 00:35:48.179
whether refusals will impede Uh, timely access to, um,

429
00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:54.669
important medical services. Um, AND it's that concern that

430
00:35:54.669 --> 00:35:56.750
leads to, uh, at least in, in my mind,

431
00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:02.129
it's that concern that is the primary reason, uh,

432
00:36:02.469 --> 00:36:08.949
that defenders give for requiring, uh, referral, uh, and

433
00:36:08.949 --> 00:36:15.429
informing. Now, I think the primary kind of argument

434
00:36:15.429 --> 00:36:20.929
against that or or reason to question that. Is

435
00:36:21.709 --> 00:36:32.469
To question whether. In all cases, Referral informing is,

436
00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:38.250
is required. And I think it would be better

437
00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:43.469
in terms of striking an appropriate balance between the

438
00:36:43.469 --> 00:36:47.709
interests of physicians and maintaining moral integrity and the

439
00:36:47.709 --> 00:36:51.949
interests of patients and timely access. Uh, IT would

440
00:36:51.949 --> 00:36:56.840
be a better way of striking that balance to

441
00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:04.389
have a context-dependent approach. So, in some cases, it

442
00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:11.090
may very well not be required for the physician

443
00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:16.830
themselves to provide the information or to provide the

444
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:23.429
referral. Uh, FOR example, in a, um, hospital emergency

445
00:37:23.429 --> 00:37:29.860
department. In which one of the many uh ED

446
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:36.350
physicians objects to emergency contraception, um, it might be

447
00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:40.750
possible. Depending on the staffing and the size of

448
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:44.469
the, of the hospital. It might be possible to

449
00:37:44.469 --> 00:37:48.110
set up a procedure where rape victims who come

450
00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:55.350
into the ED uh uh are, are, uh, directed

451
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:59.830
by nurses or by whoever does the uh the

452
00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:06.979
initial screening, um, uh, to. To be to be

453
00:38:06.979 --> 00:38:11.590
seen by physicians who don't object. And in that

454
00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:15.770
way, it wouldn't be on the individual objector to

455
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:20.750
provide that information or refer. Um, IT would be

456
00:38:21.229 --> 00:38:24.750
other people who do it. And so that, I

457
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:29.429
think, would strike a, a better, um, more justifiable

458
00:38:29.429 --> 00:38:34.909
balance if it's possible. Now, in many cases, it

459
00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:39.300
will not be feasible. To set up those kinds

460
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:43.899
of uh procedures. And in that case, uh, a

461
00:38:43.899 --> 00:38:48.179
referral requirement is, is certainly justified or an informant

462
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:52.949
um requirement is certainly justified. But as I said,

463
00:38:53.179 --> 00:38:57.379
um, it may not be, uh, it may it

464
00:38:57.459 --> 00:39:06.629
it that. Satisfying the goal of. Protecting patients' timely

465
00:39:06.629 --> 00:39:10.949
access to medical services may not require a blanket.

466
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.020
Referral or informing requirement.

467
00:39:16.649 --> 00:39:20.770
Another controversy you explore in the book is the

468
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:26.560
justifiability of a symmetry between responses to conscientious objectors

469
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:31.770
and conscientious providers. What is this controversy about?

470
00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:39.770
Well, the controversy, first of all, what is the

471
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:47.469
asymmetry and the, the asymmetry, um, is that whereas

472
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:54.340
it's very common. Uh, BOTH in law and in,

473
00:39:54.399 --> 00:40:04.389
uh, policy. To Tolerate conscientious objectors, to accommodate conscientious

474
00:40:04.389 --> 00:40:09.889
objectors. Um, ALBEIT sometimes with requirements, but at least

475
00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:16.719
it's common to, um, to, to accommodate. Whereas in

476
00:40:16.719 --> 00:40:24.699
the case of conscientious providers, For example, um, OBGYNs

477
00:40:24.699 --> 00:40:28.659
who think they have an obligation to provide abortions

478
00:40:28.899 --> 00:40:33.760
in cases that are not legally permitted or, um,

479
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:37.679
pediatricians who believe that they have an obligation to

480
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:43.219
provide gender-affirming care where it's legally prohibited, um, there

481
00:40:43.219 --> 00:40:51.250
is generally no accommodation whatsoever. Um, AND so the

482
00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:57.199
controversy is there is, well, is that justified? Um,

483
00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:03.229
IF the idea is. That we want to protect.

484
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:11.020
Physicians moral integrity. We want to provide a space

485
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:18.199
for them. To practice medicine. Without undermining their moral

486
00:41:18.199 --> 00:41:23.370
integrity. Then it seems like this asymmetry is unjustified

487
00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:29.300
because in both cases, Um, a physician's moral integrity

488
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:34.600
is at stake. In both cases, um, by hypothesis,

489
00:41:34.939 --> 00:41:40.219
a physician's core moral beliefs are at stake. So

490
00:41:40.219 --> 00:41:45.260
what is the justification for treating them differently?

491
00:41:47.159 --> 00:41:51.770
And what are the main arguments for this symmetry

492
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:54.850
and how do you evaluate them? Are they good

493
00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:55.229
enough?

494
00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.860
Um, WELL, there are a, a couple of, of

495
00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:08.389
arguments. Um, ONE is an argument that Uh, focuses

496
00:42:08.389 --> 00:42:10.830
on the law, but it could also apply, as

497
00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:17.179
opposed, to policy. And that is an argument of

498
00:42:17.179 --> 00:42:23.899
um inconsistency. So the claim is, well, look, if

499
00:42:23.899 --> 00:42:31.540
there's a law. Against, let's say, um, Providing gender-affirming

500
00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:36.939
care. Or a law against providing medical assistance in

501
00:42:36.939 --> 00:42:45.479
dying. Then granting an exception. To physicians who believe

502
00:42:45.479 --> 00:42:50.530
they have an obligation to provide those services. Um,

503
00:42:50.889 --> 00:42:54.280
IT, it's just inconsistent. Right, on the one hand,

504
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.429
you're saying, well, this is illegal, and on the

505
00:42:57.429 --> 00:42:59.639
other hand, you're saying, well, but in, for some

506
00:42:59.639 --> 00:43:05.060
people, it's not illegal. And so the, the argument

507
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:09.379
then is that there's something very problematic with that

508
00:43:09.379 --> 00:43:13.729
kind of stance. Now, I don't think that's a

509
00:43:13.729 --> 00:43:16.649
good argument, and the reason I don't think it's

510
00:43:16.649 --> 00:43:21.929
a good argument is because once an exception is

511
00:43:21.929 --> 00:43:27.050
granted, then it is no longer illegal to provide

512
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:32.610
the services. Right? And the argument um in favor

513
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:37.850
of a of um asymmetry was kind of presupposing

514
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:42.909
that what you're doing is licensing people to act

515
00:43:42.909 --> 00:43:47.929
illegally. When in fact, what is being done is

516
00:43:47.929 --> 00:43:54.800
not licensing doctors to act illegally. But giving them

517
00:43:54.939 --> 00:43:59.419
um the uh uh a space in which uh

518
00:43:59.419 --> 00:44:04.229
they they're not acting illegally, right? Um, SO I,

519
00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.540
that's why I think it's a bad argument. Um,

520
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:12.179
THERE'S another argument which I think is, uh, warrants

521
00:44:12.179 --> 00:44:17.179
more attention. And that's the argument that, well, it,

522
00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:24.429
it's, if, if you allow an exception. To uh

523
00:44:24.429 --> 00:44:27.739
physicians who believe they have an obligation to provide

524
00:44:27.969 --> 00:44:35.199
a service. Um, THAT thwarts. The goal or purpose.

525
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:41.110
Of that law. Right, so it's not, uh, this,

526
00:44:41.229 --> 00:44:43.510
it's not saying it's illegal, you know, you're granting

527
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:47.350
them the permission to act illegally. But what you're

528
00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:52.350
doing is you're granting them to perform actions, which

529
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:57.060
if it's a law, the state, um, believes, um,

530
00:44:57.149 --> 00:45:03.520
or the state's position is that this particular uh

531
00:45:03.629 --> 00:45:10.489
activity, this particular service, um, is contrary. To, um,

532
00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:14.500
you know, the values of the state. It's contrary

533
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:18.979
to um protecting citizens, which is one of the

534
00:45:19.219 --> 00:45:23.320
obligations of the state. And so that argument, I

535
00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:29.050
think, is stronger. Because it's, it's now saying, you

536
00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:31.129
know, which it seems to me is correct to

537
00:45:31.129 --> 00:45:38.300
say that it is undermining um the The underlying

538
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:43.260
goal or purpose of the law or regulation. And

539
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:46.469
that seems to me to then kind of shift

540
00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:51.850
the debate, shift the controversy to another very, I

541
00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:57.729
think, intriguing and challenging question, which is what are

542
00:45:57.729 --> 00:46:05.750
the limits. Um, OF legitimate state interference, um, with

543
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:13.899
medical care. Um, AND to what extent? Uh, IS

544
00:46:13.899 --> 00:46:24.360
it? Justified For the state to prohibit. Um, MEDICAL

545
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:29.280
services, the provision of medical services, which the profession

546
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:34.840
or professions at issue, um, uh. Their view is

547
00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:43.409
these are perfectly acceptable, appropriate, uh, medical services. And

548
00:46:43.409 --> 00:46:46.290
that, for example, you know, comes up in case

549
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:51.520
of gender affirming care, where most of the professional

550
00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.810
organizations that have taken positions say, well, this is

551
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:59.370
basically should be standard of care. It, it's, it's

552
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:02.969
promoting the health and well-being of patients. And so

553
00:47:02.969 --> 00:47:05.489
that raises the question, well, who should be the

554
00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:10.350
ultimate arbiter of what promotes the health and well-being

555
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:11.370
of patients.

556
00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.959
So in the cases where there's a conflict between

557
00:47:16.959 --> 00:47:22.909
the patient's interests or well-being and the physician's self-interest,

558
00:47:23.399 --> 00:47:27.439
what kinds of implications can there be for the

559
00:47:27.439 --> 00:47:31.000
relationship between patient and physician?

560
00:47:32.689 --> 00:47:35.810
Well, I think that depends on the kind of

561
00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:39.050
the nature of the conflict. Um, YOU, you know,

562
00:47:39.129 --> 00:47:46.110
you mentioned, uh, doctors self-interest. Well, if the self-interest

563
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:51.989
is, um, a financial interest. Uh, IF, say, uh,

564
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.919
the physician is recommending tests or procedures, um, because

565
00:47:56.929 --> 00:48:02.649
somehow the physician will financially benefit from that, uh,

566
00:48:02.969 --> 00:48:05.510
that would seem to me to kind of be

567
00:48:05.729 --> 00:48:11.530
totally undermine patient trust, um, and undermine the, the

568
00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:18.149
doctor-patient relationship. In the case of conscientious objection, I

569
00:48:18.149 --> 00:48:24.429
think the question is whether or not um the

570
00:48:24.429 --> 00:48:34.810
physicians. Um. Ability or the physician's interest in um.

571
00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:40.379
Following their conscience, the physician's interest in protecting their

572
00:48:40.379 --> 00:48:46.090
moral integrity. Um, WOULD have that kind of destructive

573
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:52.060
effect on the doctor-patient relationship. And I think to

574
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:57.020
a great extent, the answer to that depends on.

575
00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:04.860
How the physician communicates. Their objection to the patient.

576
00:49:05.689 --> 00:49:08.550
And again, this is a case where advanced notification

577
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:13.610
um might prevent this issue from even arising because

578
00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:16.889
you're not put in a position where there is

579
00:49:16.889 --> 00:49:21.520
this conflict. But let's say where there is an

580
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:26.010
established relationship, then the question is, how is the

581
00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:33.459
objection presented. And surely if the objection is presented

582
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.709
in the form of a moral lecture. Um, YOU

583
00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:41.989
know, which makes patients feel like they're bad people.

584
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:47.649
Um, THAT will totally just undermine, uh, the relationship

585
00:49:47.649 --> 00:49:50.379
and the patient's trust in the doctor. But if

586
00:49:50.379 --> 00:49:53.370
it's presented in a way that does not have

587
00:49:53.370 --> 00:50:00.199
that kind of implication. Um, 11 possibility would be

588
00:50:00.199 --> 00:50:03.800
not even to specify that the reason for not

589
00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.510
providing the service, um, is a moral objection. Say,

590
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.760
well, um, I, I, I, I can't provide this

591
00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.050
service. Now the patient might say, well, why not?

592
00:50:14.139 --> 00:50:17.129
And then there might be a need to provide

593
00:50:17.129 --> 00:50:21.340
it. But again, uh, there's a, there, there's a

594
00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:30.389
way, I think. To To communicate that objection. Without

595
00:50:30.969 --> 00:50:36.669
um making the patient feel like they're bad people

596
00:50:36.889 --> 00:50:40.370
or making the patient feel that the, that the

597
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:45.929
physician is judging them morally. Right, that, uh, that

598
00:50:45.929 --> 00:50:50.989
they have different moral beliefs. Uh, THEY'RE both worthy

599
00:50:50.989 --> 00:50:56.229
of respect, and that, I think, would still, uh,

600
00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:01.040
would, would be compatible with maintaining, uh, patients' trust.

601
00:51:01.159 --> 00:51:04.239
Now, in some cases, patients may just not want

602
00:51:04.239 --> 00:51:08.209
to have a doctor who has such divergent beliefs

603
00:51:08.209 --> 00:51:11.540
than they do, but at least it could minimize

604
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.560
the impact it has on the doctor-patient relationship.

605
00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:20.229
So let me ask you a question regarding the

606
00:51:20.229 --> 00:51:26.040
beliefs and reasons that conscientious objectors might present. On

607
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:31.159
what grounds should we ethically evaluate those beliefs and

608
00:51:31.159 --> 00:51:31.780
reasons?

609
00:51:33.169 --> 00:51:39.120
OK, so, I've, you know, already said that I'm

610
00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:47.719
kind of skeptical of requiring a full-throated philosophical justifications

611
00:51:47.939 --> 00:51:52.419
of their refusal, right? Um, SUCH that they can

612
00:51:52.419 --> 00:51:57.580
provide a, a, a plausible. Ethical justification, and again,

613
00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:02.270
plausible to whoever is evaluating. On the other hand,

614
00:52:02.969 --> 00:52:10.709
I think there are uh circumstances and situations where

615
00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:17.189
asking for reasons um can be valuable. One is

616
00:52:17.429 --> 00:52:22.379
to sort out objections that are based on um

617
00:52:22.389 --> 00:52:29.229
discriminatory beliefs. So, um, it's one thing for physicians

618
00:52:29.229 --> 00:52:34.040
to refuse to provide a service, abortion, medical assistance,

619
00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:41.260
and dying, um. Contraception. It's another thing for them

620
00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:44.379
to say, well, OK, I'll provide it to these

621
00:52:44.379 --> 00:52:50.370
kinds of people. Uh, Christian white Christians, um, but

622
00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:52.370
I won't provide it to other kind of people.

623
00:52:53.189 --> 00:53:03.209
Um, BLACKS or Muslims. That's discrimination. And it's both

624
00:53:03.209 --> 00:53:08.290
professionally prohibited and I think supported by defensible general

625
00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:13.530
ethical principles that that kind of invidious discrimination is

626
00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:18.449
morally wrong and should not be tolerated. So, insofar

627
00:53:18.449 --> 00:53:28.330
as um at least some Um, exploration. Of the

628
00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:35.979
patient of a physician's reasons, um, can uncover. Those

629
00:53:35.979 --> 00:53:43.149
kinds of biased, um. Bases, it's, I think, uh,

630
00:53:43.159 --> 00:53:47.600
justifiable. But again, that's very different from a sort

631
00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:51.879
of cross-examination and, you know, requirement that it'd be

632
00:53:51.879 --> 00:53:59.169
a philosophically suitable justification. Um, ANOTHER kind of situation

633
00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:04.510
where probe where at least examining or considering reasons.

634
00:54:05.969 --> 00:54:10.330
Um, CAN be to distinguish between what I call

635
00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:16.719
these core moral beliefs and peripheral moral beliefs. So

636
00:54:16.719 --> 00:54:19.080
a a discussion, and I, I would say now

637
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:24.560
here, a discussion. With someone else, whether it's a

638
00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:32.139
department head, administrator, um, whatever, a discussion might, uh,

639
00:54:32.399 --> 00:54:37.110
make the physician more aware. Of the fact that

640
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:41.120
it's really not that critical. Um, IT'S not that

641
00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:46.820
critical when you consider the burdens that an objection

642
00:54:46.919 --> 00:54:51.010
and a refusal is going to impose on others.

643
00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:55.750
Uh, AND it's not only on patients that it

644
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:58.590
can impose a burden, but it can also impose

645
00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:04.989
burdens on other professionals. Um, IN institutional contexts, if

646
00:55:04.989 --> 00:55:11.179
one physician refuses, say, to provide, um, a routinely

647
00:55:11.179 --> 00:55:16.860
offered service within that institution. Then other physicians must

648
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:22.560
be willing and available to provide it. Which means

649
00:55:22.659 --> 00:55:25.260
that there's going to be a burden on those

650
00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:28.820
other providers. Now, in some cases, if, if it's

651
00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:33.860
a large hospital with uh lots of staff, it

652
00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:37.139
may not be an um an excessive burden on

653
00:55:37.139 --> 00:55:42.419
other providers, but if it's a small community hospital,

654
00:55:42.659 --> 00:55:48.239
it could be. So a discussion. Uh, OF the,

655
00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:51.840
the sort of the grounds for this objection might

656
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:57.350
be helpful in just to, uh, um, uh, considering

657
00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:00.860
whether and having the physician consider whether or not

658
00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:08.540
the burdens to others, um, is justified by They,

659
00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:11.510
you know, what's at stake for them and whether

660
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:17.280
it's core or peripheral ethical beliefs. Now, a, a

661
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:22.560
final, um, consideration that might be, uh, you know,

662
00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:26.489
might, uh, make it relevant to have a, again,

663
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:34.209
a discussion of reasons, um, is Whether or not

664
00:56:35.129 --> 00:56:44.879
Objections are based on um. Indisputably false empirical beliefs,

665
00:56:45.219 --> 00:56:51.800
demonstrably false, and I emphasize, demonstrably false clinical beliefs.

666
00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:59.199
And there were some rather disturbing studies several years

667
00:56:59.199 --> 00:57:05.919
ago. Um, THAT indicated, reported that, uh, pharmacists, uh,

668
00:57:05.979 --> 00:57:11.899
who objected to emergency contraception, uh, a fairly substantial

669
00:57:11.899 --> 00:57:14.899
proportion of them, I think up to 20% in

670
00:57:14.899 --> 00:57:24.100
some cases, um, falsely, uh, confused. Emergency contraception with

671
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:32.639
mifepristone or the abortifacient. Now, insofar as those, the

672
00:57:32.639 --> 00:57:37.219
objection is based on those false beliefs, and if

673
00:57:37.639 --> 00:57:43.870
the pharmacist um had understood. That this is not

674
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:50.250
an abortive fiction. It's only a uh medication that

675
00:57:50.469 --> 00:57:58.389
prevents um conception. Um, They wouldn't have objected. Then

676
00:57:58.389 --> 00:58:04.449
it seems to me it's, it's a perfectly justifiable

677
00:58:04.459 --> 00:58:09.889
situation where at least discussing the reasons is appropriate.

678
00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:14.760
But I, at least I hope. That situations where,

679
00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:21.120
uh, where objections are based on demonstrably false clinical

680
00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:24.500
beliefs, uh, they're gonna be relatively rare.

681
00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:30.530
OK, so do you think then that there is

682
00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:36.179
space for physicians to practice medicine consistent consistent with

683
00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:42.929
their own moral convictions, should conscientious objectors be accommodated?

684
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:50.820
Well, the short answer is yes. Um, THE more

685
00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:55.320
complicated answer is yes, but, and the but is,

686
00:58:55.550 --> 00:59:02.239
uh, again, um, there has to be some recognition,

687
00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:09.600
um, of the patient's, uh, interest in timely access

688
00:59:10.179 --> 00:59:15.810
to medical services. So I would say, yes, there

689
00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:22.909
is space for conscientious objection in healthcare, provided that

690
00:59:23.409 --> 00:59:32.290
the um toleration, the accommodation. IS conditioned on not

691
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:40.949
Interfering with timely access to um information and medical

692
00:59:40.949 --> 00:59:45.500
services, and I would add, and does not does

693
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:52.389
not impose excessive burdens on uh other physicians, um,

694
00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:59.959
which, uh, unfortunately, uh, uh, has the implication. That

695
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:05.110
whether or not conscientious objection should be accommodated is

696
01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:10.889
going to be very substantially context-dependent in the sense

697
01:00:10.889 --> 01:00:15.909
that or situational dependent such that um whether or

698
01:00:15.909 --> 01:00:22.120
not. A refusal is going to impede. A patient's

699
01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:26.919
timely access. Whether or not a patient's refu uh

700
01:00:26.919 --> 01:00:31.360
a doctor's refusal, um, is going to impose excessive

701
01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:36.080
burdens on other physicians, is going to depend on

702
01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:41.600
a lot of factors, um, that, uh, you know,

703
01:00:41.719 --> 01:00:47.229
are, are context dependent. The, um. Uh, WHAT kind

704
01:00:47.229 --> 01:00:50.290
of hospital it is? Is, is it a major

705
01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:53.510
health center in an urban area? Well, then it's

706
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:57.500
probably more likely that it can be accommodated as

707
01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:03.110
opposed to a small rural hospital. Or is the

708
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:09.270
provider located in a small rural area where they

709
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:16.260
are, um, the only OBGYN within 200 miles. Um,

710
01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:20.429
THAT is going to be, I think, um, at

711
01:01:20.429 --> 01:01:24.550
least on my view, uh, very critical in deciding

712
01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:30.030
whether or not conscientious objectors should be accommodated. And

713
01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:35.010
so, uh, unfortunately, my view is somewhat messy. Um,

714
01:01:35.629 --> 01:01:37.570
uh, RATHER than, you know, the, the sort of

715
01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:41.949
blanket thing. Well, uh, here are the requirements, and

716
01:01:41.949 --> 01:01:44.929
as long as these requirements are satisfied, I say,

717
01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:50.909
well, let's not have the requirements focused on actions

718
01:01:51.090 --> 01:01:56.570
that physicians need to, uh, provide. Let's have the

719
01:01:56.570 --> 01:02:07.040
um requirements focused on providing. Patients access and avoiding

720
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:15.090
excessive burdens. So it's more um consequence-oriented requirements rather

721
01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:17.459
than action requirements.

722
01:02:18.659 --> 01:02:22.979
I have just one final question then. What implications

723
01:02:22.979 --> 01:02:26.060
do you think these debates or these kinds of

724
01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:30.020
debates like the one we're referring to today surrounding

725
01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:36.379
conscientious objection can have for institutions and society more

726
01:02:36.379 --> 01:02:36.939
widely?

727
01:02:39.169 --> 01:02:43.209
Well, I think one way in which it uh

728
01:02:43.209 --> 01:02:50.850
relates to the broader context is, um, with respect

729
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:59.760
to kind of tolerating differences. Um, AND at least

730
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.989
in the US, but I take it, the US

731
01:03:01.989 --> 01:03:06.199
isn't alone these days. Um, THERE, there's a lot

732
01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:13.139
of polarization. And one of the issues associated with

733
01:03:13.139 --> 01:03:17.260
conscientious objection, whether it should be tolerated, it, it

734
01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:20.840
has to do with the the extent to which

735
01:03:21.189 --> 01:03:26.300
um differences are respected. So people with different beliefs

736
01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:32.310
are respected, are not tolerated. Um, FOR example, if

737
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:37.260
if conscientious objection in medicine, let's focus on medicine

738
01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:42.040
now. Weren't tolerated and at least accommodated in some

739
01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:48.429
cases. Um, IT could lead to a medical profession

740
01:03:48.429 --> 01:03:56.600
profession, um, that is, you know, not at all

741
01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:04.370
diverse. So, people who had uh diverse beliefs, beliefs

742
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:09.429
that departed from the, the, the accepted view, uh,

743
01:04:09.439 --> 01:04:15.139
just wouldn't be allowed within the, the profession. Um,

744
01:04:15.479 --> 01:04:20.520
IF the view were taken that, well, we, we

745
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:26.560
can't tolerate these differences, then, um, it, it might

746
01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:33.840
result in, um, kind of weeding out. People from

747
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.260
the medical professions, sort of preventing them from even

748
01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:41.300
entering the medical profession if they are morally sensitive

749
01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:46.379
people because the message might be, um, leave your

750
01:04:46.379 --> 01:04:50.500
ethical beliefs at the door when you go into

751
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:55.209
the clinic. And that would, I think, be an

752
01:04:55.209 --> 01:05:06.500
undesirable impact. So, uh, The. I think What we,

753
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:11.699
what's at stake here. Is the extent to which

754
01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:21.459
um We respect. Moral differences. Um, ANOTHER kind of

755
01:05:22.729 --> 01:05:27.469
Issue that's that's relevant here um is what's called

756
01:05:27.969 --> 01:05:35.449
um epistemic modesty. Um, WHICH shouldn't be confused with,

757
01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:39.070
uh, cultural relativism, right? It's not the view that,

758
01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:43.070
uh, there are no right answers in, in ethics,

759
01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:47.449
but it's the view that, well, yeah, there surely

760
01:05:47.449 --> 01:05:50.889
are right answers in ethics as there is in

761
01:05:50.889 --> 01:05:54.929
science, but in some cases, we still don't know

762
01:05:54.929 --> 01:06:00.169
the answers. Right? Um, IS there intelligent life somewhere

763
01:06:00.169 --> 01:06:03.290
else in the universe? Well, yeah, either yes or

764
01:06:03.290 --> 01:06:06.250
no, but do we know? No, right now we

765
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:09.530
don't know. Uh, AND similarly with respect to some

766
01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:14.270
of these issues like abortion and, uh, birth control

767
01:06:14.409 --> 01:06:18.550
and medical assistance in dying, um, we may have

768
01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:23.909
certain beliefs right now, um, but we should recognize.

769
01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:31.179
That we often are mistaken. Uh, WE often, um,

770
01:06:31.639 --> 01:06:35.080
think we, we, we know what's right or wrong.

771
01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:38.040
We, we often think we know what are what

772
01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:41.030
are facts, and, and, and we just, it turns

773
01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:45.330
out that we are mistaken about them. Um, SO

774
01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:51.449
I think there's what this debate, um, What this

775
01:06:51.449 --> 01:06:56.229
debate, I think, suggests is that we have more

776
01:06:56.649 --> 01:07:02.590
than an understanding of how, of the importance of

777
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:09.510
both epistemic modesty generally and also the importance of

778
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.489
being respectful of the views of people with whom

779
01:07:13.489 --> 01:07:19.149
we disagree. And, um, you know, as much as

780
01:07:19.149 --> 01:07:26.310
is justifiable and feasible, um, to give them moral

781
01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:32.199
space. Um, AS long as it doesn't interfere with

782
01:07:32.199 --> 01:07:36.929
some other morally important goal or objective.

783
01:07:38.909 --> 01:07:42.949
Great, so the book is again conscientious Objection in

784
01:07:42.949 --> 01:07:45.310
Medicine, and I'm leaving a link to it in

785
01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:49.510
the description of the interview. And Mark, apart from

786
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:52.909
the book, are there any places on the internet

787
01:07:52.909 --> 01:07:54.889
where people can find your work?

788
01:07:56.659 --> 01:08:00.419
Uh, WELL, I've published a number of, um, I

789
01:08:00.419 --> 01:08:05.939
mean, published, uh, two other books. Uh, ONE is

790
01:08:05.939 --> 01:08:10.050
Unconscientious Objection. Um, THAT'S not available on the web,

791
01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:14.159
but I've published numerous articles, and some of those

792
01:08:14.159 --> 01:08:18.939
are available, um, well, uh, they're not open access,

793
01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:23.200
but many of them are available through academic libraries.

794
01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:27.540
Um. I have a, a website at the University

795
01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:31.740
of Pittsburgh Center for Bioethics and Health Law, uh,

796
01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:34.779
which has, uh, a, a, a, a number of

797
01:08:34.779 --> 01:08:40.209
references to my work. Um. So, and, you know,

798
01:08:40.259 --> 01:08:46.359
if anybody is um is interested and can't um

799
01:08:46.819 --> 01:08:51.060
get a, uh, get an article, they could email

800
01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:54.620
me and um I would, uh, you know, certainly

801
01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:56.939
be happy to, to send them a copy of

802
01:08:56.939 --> 01:08:57.620
the article.

803
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.759
Great, so thank you so much for taking the
