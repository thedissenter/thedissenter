00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.450
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.510
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.300
today I'm joined for a second time by Doctor

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.470
Kostas Kampouakis. He's author and editor of several books

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.500
about science. He works at the Teacher Training Institute

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.540
and the section. Biology at the University of Geneva

7
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.870
and today we're talking about his book Darwin Mythology

8
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.219
Debunking Myths, Correcting Falsehoods. So Dr. Kampoakis, welcome back

9
00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.229
to the show. It's always a pleasure to talk

10
00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.780
with you.

11
00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.590
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure for me

12
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.869
too.

13
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.279
OK, so let me start by asking you, I

14
00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:41.490
guess, a simple question. So what is the premise

15
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.560
of the book and why did you feel the

16
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.279
need to write a book, uh, such a volume

17
00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:50.549
on Darwin and myths surrounding Darwin?

18
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.319
Yeah. Well, Darwin is perhaps the most well-known uh

19
00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.639
naturalist of all time, and even though there are

20
00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:02.360
so many books about him, there also exists numerous

21
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.010
myths. And whereas I had seen them being debunked

22
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.839
in one book or another, I thought that it

23
00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:11.970
would be useful to have a collection. Uh, WITH

24
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.089
all the myths debunked in one place. And as

25
00:01:15.089 --> 00:01:17.529
you know, this is not a book I wrote

26
00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:20.169
because I don't think that any single person could

27
00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:23.769
have written this book because uh the scholarship and

28
00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:28.010
the available material on Darwin is enormous. That's why

29
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.290
I'm glad that I managed to bring together a

30
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.080
group of stellar historians, each one of whom, uh,

31
00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:38.620
took the task to debunk uh a specific myth,

32
00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:40.730
and here we are with this collection.

33
00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:45.519
So, I mean, of course, Darwin is considered a

34
00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:49.150
very big figure, I mean, the biggest figure in

35
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.550
biology, and evolutionary biology and so on in naturalism

36
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.989
more generally. And he's considered, of course, a hero

37
00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:01.669
by many people. So what would you say are

38
00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:06.760
the problems with hero worshiping in science and other

39
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.790
disciplines?

40
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.910
Yeah, I think this is a big issue and

41
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.029
this is actually the topic of another book I

42
00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:17.639
have written about Mendel, uh, because Mendel, Darwin, and

43
00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.509
other people uh are important, uh, in what they

44
00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.889
did, but they were never alone. All of them

45
00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:29.770
always relied on predecessors or contemporaries, people who did

46
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.279
similar work. And of course, there's something to be

47
00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.809
uh important about them. There's, there are features that

48
00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.970
distinguish them from others, but it was never the

49
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.570
case that they did what they did on their

50
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.270
own. They always received feedback, material, information. Uh, VIEWS

51
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.750
from other people. And they relied on the predecessors,

52
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.750
they worked with contemporaries, and therefore, hero worshiping masks

53
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.300
the important fact that science is always done by

54
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.990
communities. Even though we may have some brilliant individuals

55
00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.869
who managed to bring together the key ideas, it

56
00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:13.149
was never them alone who came up with these

57
00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.509
ideas.

58
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.130
Mhm. And in regards to hero worshiping and this

59
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.570
sort of simplistic narratives that many times we hear

60
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.570
about the lives of scientists and other intellectuals, why

61
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.500
do you think that people tend to like them

62
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.460
so much?

63
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.160
Well, we like them because it is easy to

64
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.539
think that a single genius individual uh who is

65
00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.949
Far away from what we, you know, normal people

66
00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.750
are, came up with this brilliant idea. I think

67
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.789
we like heroes. That's why mythology was something that

68
00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:54.110
people always like. That's why people watch films with

69
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.300
heroes. And it's, and it's also a very simple

70
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.960
explanation that, you know, that someone brilliant found this

71
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.929
and we're done. Uh, HOWEVER, this, I repeat, this

72
00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:06.970
is not how science, uh, is done, and this

73
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.130
is actually something that makes science seem distant to

74
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.050
people, whereas all those individuals, they were brilliant, but

75
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.040
they were also ordinary people with ordinary lives. So

76
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.600
there's no need to make this uh seem very,

77
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.679
very different from what regular people are. Uh, PEOPLE

78
00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:31.489
like heroes, uh, for many reasons. There is also

79
00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:35.480
the fact that textbooks and school materials perpetuate these

80
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.880
images, you know, with, uh, this historical vignettes they

81
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.440
usually have about the lives of, um, these people.

82
00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:44.640
And I must not, I, I don't want to

83
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.070
mean that these people were not important. They were

84
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.170
important, but they always worked in a specific context,

85
00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:55.029
scientific and social, which we have to acknowledge.

86
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.010
Mhm. So, let's talk a little bit about myths

87
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.570
before we explore some of the myths in regarding

88
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.769
Darwin that you talk about in the book because

89
00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:10.450
you also talk about myths themselves in the book.

90
00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:13.529
So, first of all, what is the myth and

91
00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:15.769
what roles do myths play?

92
00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:22.500
Myths are not just simple falsehoods, and that's why

93
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.399
in the subtitle of the book, I make the

94
00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:29.500
distinction between debunking myths and correcting falsehoods. Falsehoods are

95
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.220
inaccurate statements about history, which are probably easy to

96
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.459
correct, but myths are more than that. And as

97
00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:42.750
the late John Halborn uh explains in this magnificent

98
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.700
first chapter that he kindly accepted to write. Uh,

99
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.260
MYTHS usually serve a role, a specific role in

100
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.260
the specific social context in which they're conceived. And

101
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.140
that's why they're not always bad. And there are

102
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.790
myths that sometimes are useful. Of course, there are

103
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.540
myths that are sometimes dangerous, but they are there

104
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.739
in some sense in a deliberate way. They're not

105
00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:14.299
just accidents uh of history or falsehoods that nobody

106
00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:17.529
cared to correct. This exists, but myths are more

107
00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.959
than that.

108
00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:22.739
Mhm. And uh in the book you talk about

109
00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:27.700
an interesting distinction that Costas Gavroglu, I hope I'm

110
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.500
pronouncing the name correctly, has made among three different

111
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.380
kinds of myths andnodyne myths, dangerous myths, and historiographical

112
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.260
myths. Could you tell us about

113
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.779
that? Yeah, historian Koso Ravroullo made this distinction which

114
00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:43.820
I found very useful and as you see, I

115
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.700
cite a book in Greek that he wrote. And

116
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.179
the key issue here is that we have myths

117
00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:51.670
that, you know, do not do any harm. For

118
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.820
instance, whether Galileo dropped those balls from Pisa or

119
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.059
the Pisa Tower or not, it doesn't change anything

120
00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:01.299
in how science is done. This is what he

121
00:07:01.299 --> 00:07:05.049
describes as anodyne myths, myths that do no harm.

122
00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:07.579
This is what the word means. But there are

123
00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:11.704
also dangerous myths like the perpetual myths that. You

124
00:07:11.704 --> 00:07:16.315
know, science and religion are always in conflict which

125
00:07:16.315 --> 00:07:22.315
masks the complicated interaction between scientists and their religious

126
00:07:22.315 --> 00:07:26.125
beliefs, scientists themselves and the church across time. This

127
00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:31.994
is a very strange, uh, complicated, interesting uh relationship

128
00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:35.954
that is not clearly explained by the representation of

129
00:07:35.954 --> 00:07:38.890
the conflict. And we also have in the end,

130
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.480
as he argues, historiographical myths which were created by

131
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.529
historians in the past in their attempt to correct

132
00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:48.200
the first two kinds. Uh, FOR instance, you know,

133
00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:51.130
that the science is objective and is not affected

134
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.290
by the cultural context, which of course is not

135
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.184
true. All of us. All scientists, everyone who works

136
00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:59.904
in a specific sociocultural context, and they're always influences.

137
00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:02.625
So there are myths which are more or less

138
00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:05.295
important. There are myths that do more or less

139
00:08:05.295 --> 00:08:09.424
harm, uh, but all these are more just, just

140
00:08:09.424 --> 00:08:11.665
falsehoods, and it is important to keep this in

141
00:08:11.665 --> 00:08:11.984
mind.

142
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.119
Mhm. So, of course, we will not have time

143
00:08:16.119 --> 00:08:19.399
to go through all of the myths regarding Darwin

144
00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:22.200
that you explore in the book. So I just

145
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.679
picked some of them that I think are good

146
00:08:24.679 --> 00:08:28.679
illustrations of what you explore there both in regards

147
00:08:28.679 --> 00:08:32.840
to Darwin's work and character, but also a broader

148
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.304
comment. Carry on how science works and is done

149
00:08:36.304 --> 00:08:40.974
and how we should relate to, uh, scientists. So,

150
00:08:41.505 --> 00:08:45.825
first of all, were Darwin's ideas original to him?

151
00:08:45.864 --> 00:08:49.864
I mean, for instance, did people before Darwin really

152
00:08:49.864 --> 00:08:53.625
not think that species change was possible?

153
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.520
Yeah, Pietro Corsi explains in his chapter that the

154
00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.960
idea of evolution was in the air long before

155
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.000
Darwin. It is now, it's also interesting that all

156
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.039
the key uh notions that Darwin used, uh, the

157
00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:12.760
analogy with artificial selection, uh, the idea that Malthus

158
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.030
had about the struggle for existence, and everything else

159
00:09:16.559 --> 00:09:19.960
were there. What was brilliant in Darwin is that

160
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.400
he found a way to put these pieces of

161
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.494
the puzzle together and pro. A theory, the basis

162
00:09:26.494 --> 00:09:31.054
of which is still accepted today. And the key

163
00:09:31.054 --> 00:09:35.775
idea that Darwin is dissent with modification with two

164
00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:39.135
important aspects, common descent on the one hand, and

165
00:09:39.135 --> 00:09:42.405
natural selection on the other, which leads to divergence.

166
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:47.080
Uh, SO what the brilliance of Darwin was through

167
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.719
his deep, uh, reading and his own experimental work

168
00:09:51.719 --> 00:09:55.880
and observations to bring everything together in a quite

169
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.719
coherent theory.

170
00:09:59.059 --> 00:10:02.530
More, uh, but more broadly, what does it mean

171
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:06.059
for ideas to be original? I mean, does it

172
00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:10.619
matter who have the ideas first and what does

173
00:10:10.619 --> 00:10:11.619
it mean exactly?

174
00:10:12.309 --> 00:10:16.700
Mhm. Well, there are some people who come up

175
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.510
with original ideas, but when it comes to science,

176
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.830
I don't think that it is the idea that

177
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.460
is uh the only important aspect. It is also

178
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.789
who manages to do something with this idea, for

179
00:10:29.789 --> 00:10:34.460
instance, propose a theory that explains or makes predictions.

180
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.539
And this is the important stuff. So, We do

181
00:10:38.539 --> 00:10:40.770
not really know who was the first to come

182
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.380
up with the idea of evolution, but it was

183
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.940
Darwin, who in 1859, published a book that presented

184
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.289
a coherent theory. There were theories before that, for

185
00:10:52.289 --> 00:10:56.179
instance, uh, Lamarck had proposed the theory many years

186
00:10:56.179 --> 00:10:59.900
before Darwin, but this was a quite speculative theory.

187
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.900
It was not a theory as well constructed and

188
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.659
as well documented as Darwin's. This being said, what

189
00:11:08.659 --> 00:11:12.359
Darwin managed to show was the potential of his

190
00:11:12.359 --> 00:11:16.659
theory to explain evolution, but he never managed to

191
00:11:16.659 --> 00:11:21.409
show that natural selection was actually competent in producing

192
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.219
new species, something that of course since then has

193
00:11:25.219 --> 00:11:27.859
been demonstrated in several different ways.

194
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.090
Mhm. So, of course, we know that, uh, we,

195
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.489
we know it's true that some other person could

196
00:11:36.489 --> 00:11:39.489
have come up with the theory of evolution by

197
00:11:39.489 --> 00:11:42.729
natural selection instead of Darwin because we have someone

198
00:11:42.729 --> 00:11:46.609
like Alfred Russell Wallace. But do you think that

199
00:11:46.609 --> 00:11:51.969
even other people in that particular historic and cultural

200
00:11:51.969 --> 00:11:55.130
context could have come up with the idea if

201
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.940
Darwin never existed?

202
00:11:57.239 --> 00:12:00.349
Mhm. Absolutely. First of all, Darwin has been blamed

203
00:12:00.349 --> 00:12:03.109
by at least 3 authors that he stole the

204
00:12:03.109 --> 00:12:05.989
idea from some other people, one of them being

205
00:12:05.989 --> 00:12:09.390
Wallace. And Wallace did not come up with the

206
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.570
same theory as Michael Roos explained in his chapter.

207
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.020
Uh, IT was a similar, a similar idea but

208
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:20.539
with different basis. Uh, BUT historians have argued that

209
00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:23.469
it is not a coincidence that it was Wallace

210
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:29.450
who lived in the same, uh, imperial, uh, social,

211
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.849
cultural context of England at the time who came

212
00:12:32.849 --> 00:12:36.460
up uh with the, this idea because it was

213
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.960
the aspects of society. Uh, THAT made him think

214
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.330
in a similar way with Darwin. Nevertheless, Darwin had

215
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.080
worked on that, uh, theory for a longer time,

216
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.609
and as historians admit, he managed to establish it

217
00:12:52.609 --> 00:12:56.409
in a perhaps more coherent way than Wallace, who

218
00:12:56.409 --> 00:13:00.950
nevertheless thought in quite similar terms. Mhm.

219
00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:05.669
And who were the people who influenced Darwin the

220
00:13:05.669 --> 00:13:08.309
most because I think it's also important for people

221
00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:13.700
to understand who's behind the ideas that then led

222
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.280
Darwin to come up with his own ideas. So,

223
00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:20.260
uh, tell us about that? Yeah, I, I think

224
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.729
there are 3 principle, 3 major influences. The first

225
00:13:24.729 --> 00:13:29.270
one was his uh observation and work related to

226
00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.760
animal breeding. So he got engaged in breeder societies.

227
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:37.010
He was able to see how uh breeders could

228
00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:41.289
do artificial selection in order to make individual animals

229
00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:44.750
that they wanted and produce the features uh in

230
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.650
the next generation that they wished. Uh, SO that

231
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:51.690
was one important uh aspect. And the, the big

232
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.070
problem that Darwin had to deal with was, OK,

233
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.369
but who's making this selection? In artificial selection with

234
00:13:58.369 --> 00:14:01.609
breeding in the context of breeding, it was humans

235
00:14:01.609 --> 00:14:03.770
who made that selection, but what happens in nature?

236
00:14:04.299 --> 00:14:09.039
And then when he read the uh the book

237
00:14:09.039 --> 00:14:12.280
by Thomas Malthus that talked about uh the struggle

238
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.840
of existence, that an idea that was very common

239
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.159
at the time in the social context in which

240
00:14:18.159 --> 00:14:20.679
they will lived, he thought that perhaps it was

241
00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:25.760
a struggle and the competition within and between species

242
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.580
that was driving this selection. This was already a

243
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.099
core element of the theory uh which Darwin had

244
00:14:34.349 --> 00:14:38.669
very well developed until 1839, but there was something

245
00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:43.070
missing. Uh, WHAT was missing was how the divergence

246
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.320
of species was possible, and it took him another

247
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.909
almost 20 years until 1857 to come up with

248
00:14:50.909 --> 00:14:53.349
another principle which is important for his theory, the

249
00:14:53.349 --> 00:14:59.020
principle of divergence. Uh, THAT showed that wherever there

250
00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.140
was space in the ecosystems, there was an open

251
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:06.380
niche, it could be occupied by uh individuals which

252
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:11.099
would thus, uh, further diverge in adapting in their

253
00:15:11.099 --> 00:15:15.299
environments. And he started writing a big book that

254
00:15:15.299 --> 00:15:19.020
he would call natural selection, but it was the

255
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.929
receipt of the letter by Wallace in 1858 that

256
00:15:24.099 --> 00:15:27.890
made him. Uh, RECONSIDER things and write an abstract

257
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.580
of 500 pages of, uh, which was the origin

258
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.690
of species. Uh, SO it was all in all

259
00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:40.140
his readings and understanding of, uh, development, uh, with

260
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.799
respect. To the principle of divergence, Mattos's idea of

261
00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:47.200
the struggle for existence, and importantly, and that was

262
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.960
a key difference with Wallace, uh, the analogy uh

263
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.000
with artificial selection that produced the core of his

264
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.400
theory.

265
00:15:57.049 --> 00:16:00.419
So we have to, of course, talk about his

266
00:16:00.429 --> 00:16:05.630
historic visit to the Galapagos Islands because everyone talks

267
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.140
about that. I mean, it's one of the most

268
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.770
famous uh aspects, events, if you want to call

269
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.869
it that of Darwin's life and Uh, I mean,

270
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.030
there's this common idea that, uh, what he was

271
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:23.799
exposed to there was enough to convert him to

272
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:28.349
evolutionary theory. I mean, is that true? And what

273
00:16:28.349 --> 00:16:31.789
did he gain intellectually from this visit? Mhm.

274
00:16:33.195 --> 00:16:35.575
No, it's not true, and that's an interesting myth

275
00:16:35.575 --> 00:16:39.174
because uh the visit to the Galapagos is usually

276
00:16:39.174 --> 00:16:43.655
described, presented as a eureka moment. Darwin suddenly saw

277
00:16:43.655 --> 00:16:46.414
the finches and came up with this brilliant idea,

278
00:16:46.534 --> 00:16:48.775
but the truth is that Darwin had no clue

279
00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:51.719
what was happening. When he visited there, it was

280
00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:55.559
only later upon his return to England that ornithologist

281
00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:59.119
John Gould managed to understand the connections between the

282
00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:02.239
different specimens that Darwin had brought with him or

283
00:17:02.239 --> 00:17:07.348
sent back to England during his trips and Even

284
00:17:07.358 --> 00:17:10.917
after that, it doesn't seem that uh the finches

285
00:17:10.917 --> 00:17:13.118
were that important because even though they have a

286
00:17:13.118 --> 00:17:17.098
prominent place in his book about the uh the

287
00:17:17.098 --> 00:17:20.800
Beagle voyage. They're not even mentioned in The Origin

288
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.020
of Species. So they're not that important for the

289
00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.800
theory and it seems it was other organisms in

290
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:32.170
the Galapagos which were more important. So, this is

291
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.930
not um perhaps something a myth that is that

292
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:39.890
dangerous but it is misleading because we tend to

293
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.760
present an individual with a sudden observation and a

294
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.329
sudden, uh, you know, insight that goes up to

295
00:17:47.329 --> 00:17:50.170
bring uh a theory, but of course, the real

296
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.680
story is more complicated than that.

297
00:17:53.199 --> 00:17:56.439
So you mentioned the finches, uh, what about them?

298
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.469
I mean, what insights did you really get from

299
00:17:59.469 --> 00:17:59.750
them?

300
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:05.689
When once uh Darwin understood the connection, he realized

301
00:18:05.689 --> 00:18:11.430
that uh They were different but related species that

302
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:16.069
had evolved from perhaps a single individual, which was

303
00:18:16.069 --> 00:18:19.630
something that was new at the time. Uh, THERE

304
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.630
were many people who believed in special creation. Darwin,

305
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.979
of course, was wondering why he could not see

306
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:31.880
the same species. Inhabiting similar environments which would make

307
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.119
sense from the perspective of special creation. If a

308
00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:40.060
divine uh entity of God had created species, it

309
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.640
would be something to expect that they would be

310
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.349
created in order to fit, to be adopted in

311
00:18:45.349 --> 00:18:49.640
the specific uh conditions. But, uh, he realized that

312
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.459
in different volcanic islands, Uh, Galapagos and that's where

313
00:18:53.459 --> 00:18:56.699
there were different species living. And it only made

314
00:18:56.699 --> 00:19:00.300
sense to explain this by thinking that, well, it's

315
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.849
not a special creation, it has to do with

316
00:19:03.459 --> 00:19:10.839
individuals migrating from nearby continents. That diversified and diverged

317
00:19:10.839 --> 00:19:13.430
to produce the species that were there. So when

318
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.630
he realized what the available evidence was, it, it

319
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.069
made sense to uh explain this as uh the

320
00:19:21.069 --> 00:19:25.339
outcome of a migration from uh the American continent

321
00:19:25.339 --> 00:19:28.189
and what we call today adaptive radiation of the

322
00:19:28.189 --> 00:19:31.979
different uh species in the, on the different islands.

323
00:19:33.459 --> 00:19:38.239
So there's this also uh this myth that Darwin

324
00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.000
was a sort of armchair theoretician that, I mean,

325
00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.719
he came up with these ideas, these theories, basically

326
00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:50.719
by uh sitting for very long periods of time

327
00:19:50.719 --> 00:19:55.199
thinking very hardly about whatever he was thinking about

328
00:19:55.199 --> 00:19:57.560
to come up with these ideas. So, I mean,

329
00:19:57.719 --> 00:19:59.790
is that really the case?

330
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.660
Well, it's uh an interesting story because, you know,

331
00:20:03.859 --> 00:20:06.020
he traveled around the world for 5 years and

332
00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.979
then moved to London, got married, and once they

333
00:20:08.979 --> 00:20:11.939
moved uh uh south of London to Downhouse, he

334
00:20:11.939 --> 00:20:14.859
practically never left the place instead for some, you

335
00:20:14.859 --> 00:20:18.579
know, some therapies or short trips. He was not

336
00:20:18.579 --> 00:20:22.020
working to earn his living. Uh, HE did not

337
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.180
give public lectures. He did not appear that much

338
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:28.530
in the scientific meetings of, uh, of the time.

339
00:20:28.859 --> 00:20:31.920
So that of shows that he was a bit

340
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:37.390
distant from uh the social activities of science, but

341
00:20:37.719 --> 00:20:41.359
he had an enormous number of correspondents all over

342
00:20:41.359 --> 00:20:44.839
the world, and he also did experimental work himself

343
00:20:44.839 --> 00:20:48.869
and observations uh in, in his house. So he

344
00:20:48.869 --> 00:20:52.439
was not an armchair theoretician, he was a practical

345
00:20:52.439 --> 00:20:55.800
experimentalist. Uh HE was a scientist who was doing

346
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.000
real scientific work. It is just that he was

347
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.770
a bit Um, disconnected physically, uh, he did not

348
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.770
appear in person meetings, but as I said, he

349
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.569
had a huge number of correspondents with whom he

350
00:21:08.569 --> 00:21:12.209
exchanged views, who sent him samples or anything he

351
00:21:12.209 --> 00:21:15.770
wanted. So he was quite active in real scientific

352
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:20.630
work. Nothing to do with just uh thinking and

353
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.770
developing theories uh without any practical part.

354
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:29.219
And he also bred pigeons, right? So that's another

355
00:21:29.219 --> 00:21:34.040
example uh that illustrates why and how he wasn't

356
00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.560
just simply a theoretician.

357
00:21:36.969 --> 00:21:39.410
Yeah, he, he, he did interesting work, you know,

358
00:21:39.489 --> 00:21:41.579
he was trying to see, for instance, whether the

359
00:21:41.579 --> 00:21:46.170
seeds of plants can survive in salted water in

360
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:48.890
order to, to explain whether seeds could be transferred

361
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:52.099
through sea from, you know, the continent uh to

362
00:21:52.099 --> 00:21:54.410
islands. He did all kind of different kinds of

363
00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.369
experimental work which was very interesting.

364
00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:01.709
And I mean, even for scientists in general, is

365
00:22:01.709 --> 00:22:06.869
the, is being uh an armchair thinker really the

366
00:22:06.869 --> 00:22:11.030
way by which scientists usually come up with ideas

367
00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.939
because there's this very common idea that, I mean,

368
00:22:14.069 --> 00:22:18.675
there are certain. Individuals who have very high cognitive

369
00:22:18.675 --> 00:22:22.875
capacity that if they just sit on some ideas

370
00:22:22.875 --> 00:22:25.765
for long enough, then they can come up with

371
00:22:26.194 --> 00:22:30.875
big uh uh big revolutionary theories. But is that

372
00:22:30.875 --> 00:22:33.435
really how science tends to work?

373
00:22:33.829 --> 00:22:36.300
Uh NOT at all, even though I should say

374
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.910
that today with all these data available on our

375
00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.189
computers, I, I know scientists who can, you know,

376
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.979
compile DNA data from different databases and do computational

377
00:22:47.979 --> 00:22:51.979
analysis, but even that is not really armchair thinking.

378
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.630
It is work, real scientific work, but it's not

379
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.390
done always in the lab, it's done on the

380
00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:02.079
computer. And nevertheless, even if today we have uh

381
00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:05.520
different means of interaction, mostly the internet that was

382
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.560
not available in Taiwan's time, and we cannot really

383
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.719
describe scientists as armchair thinkers because they need to

384
00:23:13.719 --> 00:23:17.119
have data and they need to explain what they

385
00:23:17.119 --> 00:23:21.920
see uh in ways that are uh in agreement

386
00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.829
with this data.

387
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:27.369
Mhm. So let's talk a little bit about Lamarck.

388
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:32.270
I mean, how did Darwin react to Lamarck's ideas,

389
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.790
at least on the first, uh, uh, instance? I

390
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:39.339
mean, did he really reject them outright?

391
00:23:39.949 --> 00:23:43.030
Well, Darwin, it seems that he did not like

392
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:47.550
the spec the very speculative um aspect of Lamarck's

393
00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:51.109
theory. Uh, HE was exposed to it when he

394
00:23:51.109 --> 00:23:55.729
was uh very young in Edinburgh. Uh, WORKING with

395
00:23:55.729 --> 00:23:58.750
Gran there and uh he was also aware of

396
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.369
the the, the speculations of his own grandfather Erasmus

397
00:24:02.369 --> 00:24:06.250
Darwin. Now, in his writing, he has on several

398
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:11.250
occasions tried to distance himself from Lamarck's nonsense, he

399
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.160
wrote one. But if you look at his theory,

400
00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.650
in some sense he's more Lamarckian than Lamarck himself

401
00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:21.209
in the sense of how important uh the idea

402
00:24:21.209 --> 00:24:24.589
of using. This use was for the production of

403
00:24:24.589 --> 00:24:28.500
variation in his own theory. So, whereas publicly, he

404
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.219
has distanced himself from Lamarck, he practically accepted not

405
00:24:33.219 --> 00:24:36.339
the exact mechanism that Lamarck proposed, but a very

406
00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:39.199
similar idea where using this use was important for

407
00:24:39.199 --> 00:24:40.469
the production of variation.

408
00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:47.010
Um, IN regards to his, uh, theories, we can

409
00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:52.650
we reduce Darwin's theories to natural selection and was

410
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:57.250
his main theory completed after he arrived that, that

411
00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:57.569
idea?

412
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.949
Uh, NO, and that's uh another important myth that,

413
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.989
you know, Darwin came up with a theory, as

414
00:25:03.989 --> 00:25:07.709
I said in uh March 1839. He had natural

415
00:25:07.709 --> 00:25:10.550
selection, that is all. No, natural selection, of course,

416
00:25:10.569 --> 00:25:13.550
is an important aspect of his theory, but there

417
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:17.180
are other important ones. The most important two being

418
00:25:17.469 --> 00:25:20.489
uh the idea of common descent. Which was not

419
00:25:20.489 --> 00:25:23.930
widely accepted uh uh at the time, and the

420
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.540
principle of divergence, which was key uh for how

421
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.119
natural selection works. So natural selection is indeed one

422
00:25:31.119 --> 00:25:34.719
important uh part of his theory, but it's not

423
00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.160
that his whole theory can be reduced to that.

424
00:25:39.369 --> 00:25:44.959
Right. So you've already mentioned this briefly in, in

425
00:25:44.959 --> 00:25:48.719
uh earlier in our conversation, but were Darwin's and

426
00:25:48.719 --> 00:25:52.560
Alfred Russell Wallace's theories the same?

427
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:55.959
No, they were not the same. That there was

428
00:25:56.369 --> 00:26:00.719
essentially a process like natural selection described in both,

429
00:26:00.849 --> 00:26:04.209
but there were important differences throughout the years. The

430
00:26:04.209 --> 00:26:07.390
most important one being the analogy with artificial selection.

431
00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:13.290
For Darwin, this was key. For Wallace, it was

432
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:17.010
wrong and that's why uh at some point he

433
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:20.489
suggested Darwin to replace the concept of natural selection.

434
00:26:21.439 --> 00:26:23.709
With the concept of the survival of the fittest,

435
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.540
which had been coined by Herbert Spencer. For Wallace,

436
00:26:28.619 --> 00:26:31.500
the idea that there's selection done by someone or

437
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.260
somehow was misleading in how natural selection, in how

438
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.859
the process takes place. And so the analogy with

439
00:26:38.859 --> 00:26:42.020
artificial selection was a big, big difference between the

440
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.020
two views. It was central for Darwin. It was

441
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.619
practically wrong for Wallace.

442
00:26:49.359 --> 00:26:52.719
So there is also this very common idea that

443
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:56.449
uh once Darwin came up with this theory of

444
00:26:56.449 --> 00:27:00.650
evolution by natural selection and published on the Origin

445
00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.689
of Species and then these other books, but particularly

446
00:27:03.689 --> 00:27:07.609
The Origin of Species. He basically won the argument.

447
00:27:07.734 --> 00:27:12.395
When when the debate immediately, but were there opponents

448
00:27:12.395 --> 00:27:16.364
of Darwin's that had good scientific arguments?

449
00:27:16.415 --> 00:27:20.675
Absolutely. It is interesting that there are two reviews

450
00:27:20.675 --> 00:27:23.155
appearing a few months after the publication of The

451
00:27:23.155 --> 00:27:29.175
Origin of Species, both anonymous, which have the same,

452
00:27:29.234 --> 00:27:34.324
the very same argument that natural selection has never

453
00:27:34.324 --> 00:27:37.750
been, had never been shown at the time. To

454
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:42.829
be actually competent to produce new species. And this

455
00:27:42.829 --> 00:27:45.949
argument was made both in the review by Samuel

456
00:27:45.949 --> 00:27:51.150
Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, and by Thomas Henry Huxley,

457
00:27:51.229 --> 00:27:55.349
who was one of Darwin's most ardent supporters. Both

458
00:27:55.349 --> 00:27:59.030
of them acknowledged and made the scientific argument saying

459
00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:03.099
that look, natural selection as proposed by Darwin might

460
00:28:03.099 --> 00:28:08.119
in principle, explain. The uh emergence of new species,

461
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.760
but what, what is an actual example? There was

462
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.040
no actual example of the diamond. And Darwin never

463
00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.800
managed to provide one.

464
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:24.050
Mhm. So, uh, people attribute very commonly the phrase

465
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:28.579
survival of the fittest to Darwin, but where does

466
00:28:28.579 --> 00:28:29.810
it really come from?

467
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.020
Yeah, as I said, that was an idea, a

468
00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:36.020
concept coined by Herbert Spencer, and that was what

469
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:40.819
Darwin was gradually convinced to uh replace that uh

470
00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:44.380
in subsequent. Um, TO use that to replace natural

471
00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.170
selection in subsequent editions of the origin. And the

472
00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.599
reason was that, and it is true, natural selection

473
00:28:49.599 --> 00:28:54.160
is a bad metaphor because there's this implicit idea

474
00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.369
that someone does the selection. But interestingly, survival of

475
00:28:58.369 --> 00:29:02.219
the fittest is even worse because it is an

476
00:29:02.219 --> 00:29:07.849
eliminative view of selection, whereas natural selection allows for

477
00:29:07.849 --> 00:29:12.849
variations to coexist and this gives material to evolution.

478
00:29:13.209 --> 00:29:15.530
And the, the idea of survival of the fittest

479
00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.930
is not a creative selection, it's a eliminated selection

480
00:29:19.209 --> 00:29:22.489
that takes out all but one, and this actually

481
00:29:22.489 --> 00:29:26.780
limits the potential for further evolution. So both metaphors

482
00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:31.449
have problems, and neither natural selection, neither survival of

483
00:29:31.449 --> 00:29:35.260
the fittest was ideal, but natural selection eventually was

484
00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.770
closer to Darwin's own views.

485
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:45.689
Mhm. So did Darwin undermine essentialism because we also

486
00:29:45.689 --> 00:29:49.689
hear very commonly that once he came up and

487
00:29:49.689 --> 00:29:53.770
published about his theory of evolution by natural selection

488
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:58.339
then. uh, I mean, sometimes people talk about biological

489
00:29:58.339 --> 00:30:04.099
essentialism, other times just specifically about species essentially that,

490
00:30:04.199 --> 00:30:09.089
that was completely undermined by his uh theory. I

491
00:30:09.089 --> 00:30:12.209
mean, but, but did he really undermine essentialism and

492
00:30:12.209 --> 00:30:16.160
if so, what kind of essentialism exactly?

493
00:30:16.329 --> 00:30:20.489
Yeah. It was a kind of typological essentialism that

494
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.339
Darwin had to deal with. It was certainly not

495
00:30:23.339 --> 00:30:26.930
Aristotelian essentially that was the problem. And the, the

496
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:31.819
big issue here, notwithstanding the details, it was that

497
00:30:31.819 --> 00:30:34.540
the, the myth, and this is perhaps a bit

498
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.859
implicit in the chapter. And the, what annoys me

499
00:30:37.859 --> 00:30:41.219
in this story is that we have a big

500
00:30:41.219 --> 00:30:46.709
figure of science, Aristotle. And another big figure, Darwin,

501
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.790
and the second shows that the first was wrong.

502
00:30:50.079 --> 00:30:52.079
Of course, the story is never as simple as

503
00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:56.310
that and it's never about individual figures, no matter

504
00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:00.920
how important their contributions were. Uh, THERE is this

505
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.920
intuitive notion that, you know, in scientific revolution, we

506
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:09.250
had 2000 years of uh Aristotelian biology and then

507
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:12.839
Darwin suddenly came and destroyed everything and changed everything.

508
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:16.150
It was neither one nor the other. It was

509
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:19.489
always a complicated story. What is true is that

510
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:24.449
people tended not to realize the extent of variation

511
00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:27.589
that is available in nature, not even Darwin himself

512
00:31:27.589 --> 00:31:30.369
before he did his famous study with the barnacles.

513
00:31:30.489 --> 00:31:34.250
And so what Darwin brought in, which was new

514
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.510
and important was That he documented that there was

515
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:40.989
a lot of variation available in nature and therefore

516
00:31:40.989 --> 00:31:45.550
it was possible for selection to take place, and

517
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:48.630
he also noted that, you know, the, the limits

518
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:52.010
between species are not always that clear. It's not,

519
00:31:52.089 --> 00:31:54.770
even today, we know that it's not simple to

520
00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:58.680
delimit uh species. So we have this intuitive notion

521
00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.770
of essentialism that we still use to do taxonomy

522
00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:05.209
and classification because we have to define some essential

523
00:32:05.209 --> 00:32:08.479
properties, but still, it is not as clear cut

524
00:32:08.479 --> 00:32:10.880
as we think it to be. At the time,

525
00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.040
essentially it was more accepted because under the notion

526
00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.800
of special creation, we could think that species are

527
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.219
created and therefore are clearly the limited. That one

528
00:32:20.219 --> 00:32:22.719
realized that they were not clearly the limited and

529
00:32:22.719 --> 00:32:25.719
this brought in the idea that perhaps they're not

530
00:32:25.719 --> 00:32:28.400
created but have evolved from one another.

531
00:32:29.829 --> 00:32:33.800
So let me ask you now about his 1871

532
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:39.560
prediction of African human origins about how humans originated

533
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.719
in Africa. What did he claim

534
00:32:42.719 --> 00:32:45.880
exactly? Well, that that was not really a scientific

535
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:50.469
prediction. It was just a speculation that because humans

536
00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.359
and uh apes are quite similar. And because apes

537
00:32:55.359 --> 00:32:58.800
are mostly found in Africa, therefore, it makes sense

538
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.760
to think that uh humans may have originated in

539
00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.589
Africa, which in the end was shown to be

540
00:33:05.589 --> 00:33:09.209
the case, but it was not uh really uh

541
00:33:09.209 --> 00:33:12.199
a, a consistent and coherent scientific prediction. It was

542
00:33:12.199 --> 00:33:15.760
just a speculation that ended up being correct because

543
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.469
of the similarities that were evident. What was important

544
00:33:19.469 --> 00:33:23.150
is that that we accepted that, you know, apes

545
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:26.150
uh could be our relatives, which was not something

546
00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.219
that other people find, found easy to accept.

547
00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:34.069
Mhm. So let's talk a little bit now about

548
00:33:34.069 --> 00:33:40.760
the scientific revolution. So was Darwin's theory revolutionary, at

549
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.989
least in the life sciences?

550
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.760
Well, it was not exactly revolutionary in the Kunian

551
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.920
sense that, you know, there was a paradigm uh

552
00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.160
that was very different than Darwin brought something that

553
00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:59.699
was entirely new. Uh, BUT what Darwin managed to

554
00:33:59.699 --> 00:34:04.150
establish was first the idea of common dissent, which

555
00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:08.070
he documented very well in his book, and second,

556
00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:13.379
the process by which diver divergence diversification is possible.

557
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:17.188
So what was revolutionary in Darwin. WAS that he

558
00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:21.138
managed to bring together many different elements that produced

559
00:34:21.138 --> 00:34:25.898
a quite coherent theory. And as I said, even

560
00:34:25.898 --> 00:34:29.858
today, after so many years, the main premise, dissent

561
00:34:29.858 --> 00:34:33.217
with modification is something that we still accept. Of

562
00:34:33.217 --> 00:34:35.938
course, the details have changed, the theory has advanced,

563
00:34:36.259 --> 00:34:40.168
but What was revolutionary in some sense in Darwin

564
00:34:40.168 --> 00:34:43.560
is that he managed to establish a coherent theory

565
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.800
which we use uh still today.

566
00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.310
And uh at least in the Kunian sense, what

567
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.978
makes for a scientific revolution? I mean, what is

568
00:34:54.978 --> 00:34:57.020
a scientific revolution exactly?

569
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.879
In the Kunin sense, we have, you have to

570
00:34:59.879 --> 00:35:03.949
have two paradigms that are very different, uh, that,

571
00:35:03.959 --> 00:35:07.389
uh, a commensurable is a term that could use

572
00:35:07.389 --> 00:35:12.250
that and totally different from each other and The

573
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:16.010
new one has to entirely replace the previous one.

574
00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.689
But if you look at the, the theories accepted

575
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:23.600
before and after, first of all, there's no, uh,

576
00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:27.010
there were many different, different theories before Darwin and

577
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:31.060
there were many different theories after Darwin. Darwinism, as

578
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.449
we call it today itself, was not accepted immediately.

579
00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.250
It took years for it to be widely accepted.

580
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.540
It was well in the 2 the 20th century

581
00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:45.459
that it became the mainstream theory. So it was

582
00:35:45.459 --> 00:35:48.060
never the case that we had the complete replacement

583
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.649
of one theory by another. We had many theories

584
00:35:50.649 --> 00:35:54.060
before, many theories after. It was just that Darwin's

585
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.620
was the most solid one, and that's why again

586
00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.939
we accept today it's main premises. Not all the

587
00:36:00.939 --> 00:36:03.229
details because many of the details were wrong, obviously.

588
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:08.469
Mhm. So, just a minute ago, you mentioned that

589
00:36:08.469 --> 00:36:12.870
uh the theory of evolution by natural selection over

590
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.909
time has changed, of course, and there's been the

591
00:36:15.909 --> 00:36:20.139
introduction of new ideas and new data provided us

592
00:36:20.139 --> 00:36:24.189
with a better understanding of how evolution actually works

593
00:36:24.189 --> 00:36:28.110
and even more recently, we have proposals like the

594
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:32.949
extended evolutionary synthesis and things like that. So, uh,

595
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.899
I mean, I wanted to ask you, I, I'm,

596
00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:38.429
I don't think that you talk exactly about this

597
00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:41.469
in the book, but it's sort of related to

598
00:36:41.469 --> 00:36:45.219
the ideas you explore there. I mean, many times

599
00:36:45.219 --> 00:36:48.530
when we talk about Darwin, people sort of put

600
00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:54.459
him on a pedestal and uh if someone questions

601
00:36:54.459 --> 00:36:59.055
some of his ideas. AND provides novel data and

602
00:36:59.055 --> 00:37:02.135
information and says that Darwin was wrong in this

603
00:37:02.135 --> 00:37:05.936
or that aspect. Sometimes people have a very negative

604
00:37:05.936 --> 00:37:10.125
and even emotional reaction to that as if Darwin,

605
00:37:10.285 --> 00:37:13.766
just because he, he, he came up with the

606
00:37:13.775 --> 00:37:18.305
theory originally, I guess we can say, um, that,

607
00:37:18.375 --> 00:37:21.842
that it We can't really question him, uh, that,

608
00:37:22.281 --> 00:37:26.402
that Darwin is basically someone we can't question when

609
00:37:26.402 --> 00:37:30.761
it comes to natural selection and evolutionary biology more

610
00:37:30.761 --> 00:37:35.072
generally. But that's not really how we should treat

611
00:37:35.201 --> 00:37:37.582
the scientists and their ideas.

612
00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:41.152
Exactly. Well, for some people, Darwinism is a kind

613
00:37:41.152 --> 00:37:44.929
of secular religion. Uh, AND they do not accept

614
00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:48.219
any criticism on Darwin, but Darwin was wrong on

615
00:37:48.219 --> 00:37:51.340
many things, as all scientists have been wrong on

616
00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.419
many things. Actually, most scientists have been wrong on

617
00:37:54.419 --> 00:37:56.340
most of the things that they have said, but

618
00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.909
it is just that some of them ended up

619
00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:03.100
being correct, accurate, and work, uh, but it is

620
00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.739
normal in science not to be able to find

621
00:38:05.739 --> 00:38:10.010
all the answers immediately. In some cases, never. And

622
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.050
then, of course, it is always a collaborative endeavor.

623
00:38:13.179 --> 00:38:15.500
There are groups that work across time and this

624
00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.500
is why, as you said, evolutionary theory itself has

625
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:22.139
evolved. We had the merging with genetics at the

626
00:38:22.139 --> 00:38:25.780
beginning of the 20th century. We have, uh, the

627
00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:29.459
merging with development and genomics and all this recent

628
00:38:29.459 --> 00:38:34.649
stuff and epigenetics more recently, the theory becomes richer.

629
00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:38.469
And with a greater potential to explain, uh, and

630
00:38:38.469 --> 00:38:41.669
this is how science works. Uh THEORIES evolve. Darwin,

631
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:45.389
I repeat once again, put a solid basis, dissent

632
00:38:45.389 --> 00:38:48.189
with modification, that's what we still accept. But he

633
00:38:48.189 --> 00:38:50.590
was wrong about many things, and that's normal. Uh,

634
00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.659
HE could not have known what we know today,

635
00:38:52.949 --> 00:38:57.270
but he put us, the scientists doing research in

636
00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:00.870
the path that was very fruitful, and this is

637
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:03.780
why we still accept the theory. Mhm.

638
00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:06.449
So, uh let's, uh, let me just ask you

639
00:39:06.449 --> 00:39:09.449
about one last topic then, and it, it is

640
00:39:09.449 --> 00:39:13.129
just a sort of conclusion to all of what

641
00:39:13.129 --> 00:39:16.489
we've been talking about. So, uh tell us about

642
00:39:16.489 --> 00:39:20.570
the main things we can learn about science as

643
00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:24.760
a human activity by tackling myths like this.

644
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:28.969
Mhm. Well, hero worshiping is a big problem as

645
00:39:28.969 --> 00:39:32.165
we have already discussed. And it is important to

646
00:39:32.165 --> 00:39:35.655
know that uh science is not done by male

647
00:39:35.655 --> 00:39:39.965
white individuals who are more brilliant than other people.

648
00:39:40.175 --> 00:39:43.814
It is done by humans who work in groups

649
00:39:44.054 --> 00:39:47.895
and who collectively together produce what we accept as

650
00:39:47.895 --> 00:39:50.054
knowledge. And this is why it is the consensus

651
00:39:50.054 --> 00:39:54.264
of experts that matters. It is not what Darwin,

652
00:39:54.415 --> 00:39:59.469
Mendello, any individual ever said. Uh, WHAT we call

653
00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:03.709
today's scientific knowledge is what was accepted as the

654
00:40:03.709 --> 00:40:06.750
consensus by experts. Now, as I got to the

655
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:10.469
conclusion, at the, at Darwin's time, the position of

656
00:40:10.469 --> 00:40:14.429
women, not only in science is society, society more

657
00:40:14.429 --> 00:40:17.219
broadly. It was much worse than it is today.

658
00:40:17.389 --> 00:40:20.870
I hope that uh uh today we're, you know,

659
00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.550
doing better in that sense. People should be judged

660
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.870
not by the gender. There or anything else that

661
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.860
should be just about, you know, the intellectual contributions

662
00:40:29.149 --> 00:40:31.909
when it comes to science. uh BUT as I

663
00:40:31.909 --> 00:40:35.020
show, uh Darwin, even though he did not think

664
00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:39.659
that women were as capable, capable intellectually as men,

665
00:40:39.949 --> 00:40:43.110
he did help many of them, uh, when he

666
00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.649
realized that there was something in what they had

667
00:40:45.649 --> 00:40:47.389
to, to, to contribute. And I think this is

668
00:40:47.389 --> 00:40:53.570
very important. No matter his um prejudices and There

669
00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:56.060
were many prejudice at the time. He did help

670
00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.810
some women to advance and produce uh the kind

671
00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.729
of work they wanted to do. So all in

672
00:41:01.729 --> 00:41:05.409
all, we need to think of science as a

673
00:41:05.409 --> 00:41:11.300
collective endeavor done by uh many people. Uh, AND

674
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.340
what is important is to realize that it is

675
00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.939
the view of experts, the consensus of the expert

676
00:41:15.939 --> 00:41:20.050
communities that is important, not what any single individual,

677
00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.540
no matter how influential he, she is, has to

678
00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:23.879
say.

679
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.939
Mhm. And we also have to take into account,

680
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:33.379
I guess, the influence of the historical, social, cultural,

681
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:38.229
and even scientific milieu of the particular individuals. I

682
00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:41.489
mean, where they lived in the the sort of

683
00:41:41.489 --> 00:41:44.189
broad. CONTEXT they inhabited.

684
00:41:44.439 --> 00:41:48.820
Absolutely. I mean, Darwin was working in the tradition

685
00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:53.280
of natural theology for which adaptation was crucial and

686
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.239
this is why, you know, by reading Paley, he

687
00:41:56.239 --> 00:41:59.199
became interested in the question of adaptation and then

688
00:41:59.199 --> 00:42:03.199
he had uh the political economies of the time.

689
00:42:03.659 --> 00:42:07.260
Adam Smith and Thomas Matthews, they were both important

690
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.060
influences on him. And then he traveled all over

691
00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.419
the world thanks to the British ships, and he

692
00:42:12.419 --> 00:42:15.810
sent back his material. So all in all, he

693
00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.260
worked in a context that facilitated what he was

694
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.790
doing. It would not have been perhaps that easy

695
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.340
for anyone else, anywhere else in the world, and

696
00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.530
that's why, as I said, it's not a coincidence,

697
00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:28.340
perhaps the Wallace, who worked and lived in the

698
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.830
same context, came up with the same idea.

699
00:42:31.719 --> 00:42:34.699
Mhm. And I guess that it's not just the

700
00:42:34.699 --> 00:42:39.979
ways that the context can facilitate the production of

701
00:42:39.979 --> 00:42:43.080
particular ideas or coming up with particular ideas, but

702
00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:47.870
also how we can limit the individual when it

703
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:52.580
comes to uh his, his or her biases and

704
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.409
limitations when it comes. To producing science because, for

705
00:42:56.409 --> 00:43:00.530
example, certain kind of scientific information or data might

706
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.370
not be there yet and they also might be

707
00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:07.129
influenced by their social milieu as Darwin was when

708
00:43:07.129 --> 00:43:10.520
it comes to his ideas about women, for example.

709
00:43:10.949 --> 00:43:13.409
Right. Mhm. Yeah, and that's why the community matters

710
00:43:13.409 --> 00:43:15.370
because it is the community that will serve as

711
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:19.530
a filter. To filter out what each individual says,

712
00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:23.379
and the community together will decide which a view

713
00:43:23.379 --> 00:43:28.179
makes more sense or not. Uh, THAT'S why individuals

714
00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.810
have their own biases, but you know, when the

715
00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:34.409
community comes together, these biases can be discussed, filtered,

716
00:43:34.629 --> 00:43:37.919
and we end up with the most plausible theory

717
00:43:37.919 --> 00:43:38.379
possible.

718
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:44.250
Mhm. Great. So, the book is again Darwin Mythology,

719
00:43:44.389 --> 00:43:48.350
Debunking myths, Correcting Falsehoods. Of course, I'm leaving a

720
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:50.750
link to it in the description of the interview

721
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:54.389
and I'm also leaving a link to our first

722
00:43:54.389 --> 00:43:58.459
interview. So Doctor Campoakis, just before we go, apart

723
00:43:58.459 --> 00:44:01.830
from the book, where can people find your work

724
00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:02.750
on the internet?

725
00:44:03.489 --> 00:44:06.610
Well, uh, I have a personal, uh, website, the

726
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:11.409
Caraciss.com, where all my work, uh, is available, both

727
00:44:11.409 --> 00:44:14.570
books and articles, and much of it is accessible.

728
00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:17.090
Of course, anybody is welcome to contact me and

729
00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:18.879
ask for any material possible.

730
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.250
Great. So thank you so much again for taking

731
00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:25.090
the time to come on the show. It's, as

732
00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:27.330
I said at the beginning, it's always a pleasure

733
00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:28.080
to talk with you.

734
00:44:28.209 --> 00:44:29.729
It's a pleasure for me too. Thank you for
