Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.630
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Loops. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.010
joined by two guests. The first one is Doctor

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.500
Brian La, a returned guest. I'm leaving the link

5
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.029
to our first interview in the description of this

6
00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.049
one is the Carl N Le in Professor of

7
00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.739
Jurisprudence at the University of Chicago. And I also

8
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.200
have together with me today, Doctor Jimmie Edwards is

9
00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:25.739
a lecturer in law at the University of Chicago

10
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.139
where he teaches political philosophy and they are both

11
00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:34.520
authors of Marx, a new book. So, Doctors Lather

12
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.819
and Edwards. Welcome to the show. It's a pleasure

13
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.459
to everyone.

14
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.619
Thank you very much.

15
00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:41.020
Thank you. It's great to be back.

16
00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.810
So I think I will start with Doctor Edward

17
00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:47.200
Zer. I would like to ask you just to

18
00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:52.200
start off with a broad question about Marx. Uh

19
00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:55.810
Marx's background. Tell us a little bit about his

20
00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:58.130
personal life. I mean, at least the aspects of

21
00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:00.349
it that you think are the most relevant for

22
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.250
us to then get into uh his main political,

23
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.010
his main ideas and theories. Yeah.

24
00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:11.339
Good. And thanks. Uh Marx had a bit of

25
00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:14.500
an interesting life in contrast to many philosophers. So

26
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.819
um there, there is quite a lot to that

27
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.139
we could say, but um I'll keep it short

28
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.120
for now. So he was born in 1818 in

29
00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:26.180
Trier, Germany, which is in the western side of

30
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.510
Germany. Uh That's relevant because it was shortly after

31
00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.540
um uh Napoleon had um uh lost power, but

32
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.190
the region was still very much influenced by Napoleonic

33
00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:41.750
ideas more so than the sort of conservative ideas

34
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.209
coming from Berlin. Uh Mars, uh he was um

35
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.739
raised in a Jewish family, not practicing and his

36
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.300
father converted to pro um protestantism um in order

37
00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:58.800
to secure um continue working as a, as a

38
00:01:58.809 --> 00:02:04.089
lawyer. Um Marx was uh studied for law for

39
00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.870
a bit at Bonn for a year, um was

40
00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:10.020
a bit of a rebellious student, caused some trouble

41
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.270
and um they decided it would be better to

42
00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.199
send him a little further away. So he went

43
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.649
to Berlin um to continue his education and it's

44
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.309
there that he um fell under the intellectual influence

45
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.800
of Hegel um who had uh passed away shortly

46
00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.809
before. Um BUT whose ideas were still very much

47
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.660
in the air, uh especially he came under the

48
00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:34.979
influence of what we call left Hegelian with the

49
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.339
young hegelian, a group of, of liberal hegelian who

50
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.820
wanted to reject Hegel's uh conservative aspects, his, the

51
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.050
religious aspects of his thinking. Um um And so

52
00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:51.449
they, and while preserving something of what they took

53
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.259
to be core to Hegel's ideas. Um And uh

54
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.289
especially there was Bruno Bauer who Marx came to

55
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.360
work with. Um AND Bauer supervised Marx's dissertation, uh

56
00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:07.490
which was in ancient philosophy interestingly enough. Um But

57
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.910
by the time Marx had completed his phd under

58
00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:16.169
Bauer Bauer um had moved uh to bond, but

59
00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:20.029
that yet there was a reactionary um uh spirit

60
00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:22.770
in the air and it was clear that Bauer

61
00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.789
was not going to have a position for much

62
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.960
longer. And Marx would never um have a position

63
00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:32.740
in the academy. It's at that point um while

64
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.889
he's out there um that he um becomes an

65
00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:42.429
editor of a newspaper um in cologne. And he's,

66
00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:46.029
some of his academic ideas are um coming through,

67
00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.690
you know, i in this writing, but he's, he's

68
00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.110
concerned primarily with a very real world events as

69
00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:54.869
they're unfolding. And so this is, is kind of

70
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.589
a, an important early time for Marx is it's

71
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.669
merging a bit of his intellectual influence with seeing

72
00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:03.820
these things play out in practice. Um Marx went

73
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.759
to uh Paris uh as a, as an expat

74
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.975
as that as the uh the newspaper was finally

75
00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:14.126
coming to a close um and he was joined

76
00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:17.485
there by a number of other German expats. Um

77
00:04:17.495 --> 00:04:20.226
And it was also there that he met Frederick

78
00:04:20.425 --> 00:04:23.286
Engels, um who, you know, would have famously a

79
00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:26.765
lasting impact on his, uh you know, a friendship,

80
00:04:26.776 --> 00:04:29.615
but a mentor they, uh uh Marx would be

81
00:04:29.626 --> 00:04:31.661
a bit of a mentor to angles. Angles would

82
00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:35.981
be a bit of a financial um uh benefactor

83
00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:38.212
to Marx. Um But they would have a, they

84
00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:41.242
would have a long career working together and it

85
00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:44.601
was there that Marx really started to reject this,

86
00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:47.321
this sort of young hegelian ideas, we can get

87
00:04:47.332 --> 00:04:49.971
into, you know, the content of that later. Um

88
00:04:49.981 --> 00:04:53.441
But it's in this period that uh that Marx

89
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:56.002
Marx is writing the things that we come to

90
00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:59.962
now think of as very early uh Marx writings.

91
00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:03.880
Um And he's developing very early there, his theory

92
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.579
of historical materialism, which we'll talk about, of course

93
00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:11.320
and um and et cetera. So, um you know,

94
00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:16.869
wrap that up, he um is forced to flee.

95
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.709
The Paris goes to Belgium for a time. Uh

96
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.429
What years

97
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.220
are these, Jamie? You throw the years.

98
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:28.179
This is, you know, 1844 1845 1846 in this

99
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.910
period. Um But the German authorities are, are putting

100
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.329
pressure on the Parisians to get rid of Marx.

101
00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:39.989
And so he goes to a time to Brussels.

102
00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.309
Um There's a moment here, very important uh a

103
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.119
revolutionary moment in 1848 now widely considered a failed

104
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.079
revolutionary moment, but there were uprisings across Europe. It

105
00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:54.709
was a very promising moment and it's in, it's

106
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.790
in this period that Marx and Engels um released

107
00:05:57.799 --> 00:06:01.380
the Communist Manifesto. Um Marx moved back to Germany

108
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.700
for a time. But quickly the 1848 revolution fails

109
00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:10.059
mostly across Europe and Marx together with a lot

110
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.820
of the, that era that that generation of revolutionaries

111
00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:18.049
um moved to London, which was open to refugees

112
00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:20.600
at that point. And Marx moves what he thinks

113
00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:23.279
is gonna be a temporary uh for a temporary

114
00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:25.850
um stay. And he ends up spending the rest

115
00:06:25.859 --> 00:06:29.589
of his life in London um involved variously in

116
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.920
political movements, some journalistic efforts. Uh BUT, but mostly

117
00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:39.049
retreating to the um library to, to work on

118
00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:41.820
capital and, and think about and think through these

119
00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:44.519
issues. So that's a, that's a rough sketch. Um

120
00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.869
I we can fill in any details but rough

121
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.970
outline. Um BUT he doesn't sustain much fame in

122
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.399
his life um guess moments. Um BUT lives into

123
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.369
the 18 eighties um and he passes away in

124
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.549
1883 having finished capital, but leaving a lot of

125
00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:06.980
manuscripts behind um for angles to sort through which

126
00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:10.510
becomes capitals two and three. But that's roughly the

127
00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:12.510
rough sketch of how life goes,

128
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.570
right? And as I mentioned, we're going to get

129
00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:18.920
into some of his main ideas and he was

130
00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:22.619
very prolific and he also wrote about many different

131
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.170
topics so as an intellectual and because he mainly

132
00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:29.279
started as a philosopher, but then went through topics

133
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.420
as diverse as economics, history, politics, social theory. How

134
00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:35.880
would you classify him as an intellectual?

135
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.049
Yeah, I I would classify him as all of

136
00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:41.160
those things, II, I think this is very important

137
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:46.630
to him. So, so he um there's three well

138
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.399
known influences, one might say on Marx, the, the

139
00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:55.709
Hegelian background, um the sort of Parisian socialist movements

140
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.380
that he's exposed to increasingly in Paris. Um And

141
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.000
then the economic writings of Smith uh Ricardo, these

142
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.570
figures which influence him. And I think he bears

143
00:08:05.579 --> 00:08:07.519
the mark of all of this. Really. I, I

144
00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:10.859
um he certainly leaves behind what he thinks is

145
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:16.670
this, you know, purely scholastic um uh excursions that,

146
00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:19.940
you know, the hegelian he felt were taking. Um

147
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.049
BUT he doesn't abandon philosophy. I mean, it, it's

148
00:08:23.059 --> 00:08:25.049
uh it, it informs his thing. So I think

149
00:08:25.059 --> 00:08:26.239
he's all of those things. I, I don't know

150
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.510
Brian, what you would say, but I think he's

151
00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:31.470
a journalist, a philosopher, a social critic and economist.

152
00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:32.380
And

153
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.239
yeah, I mean, I guess what I would add

154
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.989
is I, I think his conception of philosophy changes

155
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.270
very substantially. Um That is, you know, I mean,

156
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.489
my, my way of thinking about it is he

157
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.890
becomes a kind of philosophical naturalist that is he

158
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.969
doesn't think philosophy is kind of has the synthetic

159
00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:56.049
enterprise of bringing together all the different empirical sciences,

160
00:08:56.059 --> 00:09:02.010
speaking very broadly, history among these empirical sciences. Um

161
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.450
And you know, the idea that there's some special

162
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:10.049
philosophical method as hegel thought, right? Um That is,

163
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.789
you know, distinctive of philosophy. He, he abandons that.

164
00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:16.200
So in that sense is uh you know, uh

165
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:20.159
his approach um is familiar from developments even in

166
00:09:20.169 --> 00:09:24.039
20th century um philosophy, he does not think of

167
00:09:24.049 --> 00:09:28.340
philosophical reflection is somehow methodologically distinct from other ways

168
00:09:28.349 --> 00:09:31.239
of understanding how the world actually works, which is

169
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.840
why you have to know some economics and history,

170
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.159
um some politics and, and so on.

171
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.229
So let's get into historical materialism. And then you

172
00:09:41.239 --> 00:09:45.320
mentioned very briefly that Doctor LA that uh you

173
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.849
rejected some of Eagle's ideas. So what, what aspects

174
00:09:49.859 --> 00:09:54.030
of Eagle's idealism did he reject? And what were

175
00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:57.530
the main ideas of Eagle's uh theory of history

176
00:09:57.539 --> 00:09:58.869
that Marx retained?

177
00:09:59.369 --> 00:10:04.090
Yeah. So, um uh you know, it's, it's natural

178
00:10:04.099 --> 00:10:08.380
and appropriate to think of Marx's own theory of

179
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.989
historical change, the theory of historical materialism as being

180
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.090
developed as a reaction against um Hagel. Um The,

181
00:10:17.099 --> 00:10:19.469
the irony is he actually takes over a lot

182
00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:23.210
of Hagel's view. Um You see Hagel's view and

183
00:10:23.219 --> 00:10:25.169
you get it in the phenomenology of Spirit. You

184
00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:28.049
see it in the lectures that are collected in

185
00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:31.690
English under the title Reason um in, in History.

186
00:10:31.989 --> 00:10:36.549
Um Marx agrees with um Hagel that history has

187
00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:40.080
a teleological structure, it's end directed, it's evolving in

188
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:44.869
a very particular direction. Um He shares with uh

189
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.409
Hagel the view that history has um a dialectical

190
00:10:50.419 --> 00:10:53.309
structure though Marx was not a dialectical materialist, but

191
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.890
that's a separate matter that was a later um

192
00:10:57.369 --> 00:11:00.690
sort of vulgarization of Marx. But he, he accepts

193
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.429
that history is dialectical in the sense that um

194
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.270
each historical epic uh is characterized by certain contradictions.

195
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.190
Um AND the resolution of those contradictions is what

196
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.840
sort of propels us forward into the, into the

197
00:11:15.849 --> 00:11:18.489
next stage of history. And I, I'll come back

198
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.940
to that because this is where there's a very

199
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.239
important difference between Marx and Hagel. Um Marx also

200
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.559
agrees with Hagel that history is cunning um in

201
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.440
the sense that particular historical actors act for their

202
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.640
own reasons and motives without necessarily understanding the way

203
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:37.570
in which they're contributing to um a historical development

204
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.000
that has a certain structure to it. You know,

205
00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:43.520
the big difference is that Marx is a materialist

206
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.679
and Hagel is an idealist, right, more precisely. Um

207
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:53.210
Hagel thinks that the contradictions in each historical epic

208
00:11:53.219 --> 00:11:56.479
that are significant are contradictions at the level of

209
00:11:56.489 --> 00:12:05.400
ideas, philosophical, religious, moral, economic ideas um that embed

210
00:12:05.409 --> 00:12:09.109
within them certain contradictory elements, right? And so the

211
00:12:09.119 --> 00:12:12.049
phenomenology of the, of spirit, Hagel's phenomenology of spirit

212
00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:16.659
is the history of these contradictions in different domains

213
00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:20.909
of human spirit, human thought, right? And how their

214
00:12:20.919 --> 00:12:24.609
con the resolution of those contradictions leads to um

215
00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:28.590
to the next stage. This is what Marx rejects

216
00:12:28.599 --> 00:12:33.909
entirely, right? For Marx, the ideas, the Geist, the

217
00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:39.809
spirit of the Age um uh is largely epiphenomenal,

218
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:44.510
right? That what really matters is um the material

219
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.799
stuff. Now, the question is what's meant by the

220
00:12:46.809 --> 00:12:52.200
materialism and historical materialism. Um FOR Marx, the the

221
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.440
crucial fact about each historical epic is the level

222
00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:01.150
of development of its productive power. OK. And history

223
00:13:01.159 --> 00:13:05.190
is the history of growth and productive power, which

224
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.719
in turn then is responsible for changes in other

225
00:13:08.729 --> 00:13:14.429
aspects of uh society and human consciousness. Um Some

226
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.500
elements of productive power are relatively stable, right? I

227
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.820
mean, human beings today are bigger than human beings

228
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.239
a couple of 1000 years ago, but our physical

229
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:29.309
strength hasn't increased significantly. Um Our knowledge has certainly

230
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.549
increased a great deal. But what matters about the

231
00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:34.500
growth in knowledge is that um it affects the

232
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.260
growth in technology. And I'm gonna just use technology

233
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.340
very broadly to mean everything, you know, from simple

234
00:13:40.349 --> 00:13:44.539
tools to computers, to the power loom, to the

235
00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:47.119
steam engine, right? All of this, I'm gonna just

236
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:51.869
treat his technology. Um So Marx's account of historical

237
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.989
change is material in the sense that he thinks

238
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.799
it's changes in technology growth in technology, growth in

239
00:13:58.809 --> 00:14:03.070
productive power. Um That explains the other changes that

240
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.099
we see in um in society and the contradictions

241
00:14:08.109 --> 00:14:11.530
for Marx. And now, um here, contradiction from Marx

242
00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:14.429
is not being used in quite the strict sense,

243
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.289
it was being used in Hagel. That is when

244
00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:20.190
Hagel is talking about ideas, he really identifies or

245
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.419
claims to find, you know, fundamental logical inconsistencies in

246
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.700
uh in earlier philosophical systems, all of which of

247
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.500
course are resolved by um Hagel, which is why

248
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.460
history ends with Hagel. Uh DIDN'T quite work out

249
00:14:34.469 --> 00:14:37.130
that way. But that's how Hagel thought um the

250
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:44.239
contradictions for Marx um are contradictions um between what

251
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.580
he calls the forces of production. That's technology. Let

252
00:14:47.599 --> 00:14:50.239
me just gloss that as a technology and what

253
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.059
he calls the relations of production, right? And you

254
00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.799
can think of the relations of production and it's,

255
00:14:55.809 --> 00:14:58.150
it's more complicated than this for reasons we talk

256
00:14:58.159 --> 00:15:00.000
about in, in the book. But you think of

257
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:04.320
the relations of production roughly as the distribution of

258
00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:08.770
property rights in any particular society, right? Um WHO

259
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:13.390
has property in uh who owns technology, who owns

260
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.960
only their own labor power, most of us own

261
00:15:15.969 --> 00:15:19.380
only our, our own labor power, right? Um And

262
00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.039
uh but in every society, some people also own

263
00:15:23.049 --> 00:15:27.820
the available technology, right? That that exists, right? So

264
00:15:28.789 --> 00:15:32.659
um a contradiction for Marx occurs according to the

265
00:15:32.669 --> 00:15:36.489
theory of historical materialism. When the existing relations of

266
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:41.250
production, the existing distribution of property rights is incompatible

267
00:15:41.719 --> 00:15:46.679
with the maximum effective use of the existing technologies,

268
00:15:46.849 --> 00:15:49.309
right? That's what he means by a contradiction. OK.

269
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.409
So it's not strictly a logical contradiction at all.

270
00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:55.299
And when that occurs, Marx thinks we enter a

271
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:59.799
period of historical transformation. Um So let me just

272
00:15:59.809 --> 00:16:02.950
give you a simple example. It's um it's not

273
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.940
exactly a historically accurate example in the sense that

274
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.030
it's running roughshod over long periods of time. But,

275
00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:13.440
but think of it this way. Um OK, suppose

276
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.630
the technology is developed for the power loom right

277
00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.010
now, the power loom, if you can get people

278
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.809
to work on, it can outproduce individual weavers of

279
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.919
fabrics, you know, by orders of magnitude. Ok? But

280
00:16:26.929 --> 00:16:29.530
if you're the owner of a power loom, right,

281
00:16:29.539 --> 00:16:32.109
you need peop, you need people available to work

282
00:16:32.119 --> 00:16:37.289
on it. Right? And under feudalism, right? Which precedes

283
00:16:37.299 --> 00:16:42.429
capitalism and the feudalism, capitalism transition was Marx's main

284
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.260
focus as a historical example, under feudalism. Right? You've

285
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:50.030
got serfs who are stuck on the feudal estates,

286
00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:53.780
right? Who work for the feudal lord. Ok? You've

287
00:16:53.789 --> 00:16:57.070
got journeymen who are sort of under the control

288
00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.109
of these guild masters, right? And while they can

289
00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:02.960
earn some money, they, they, they have very limited,

290
00:17:02.969 --> 00:17:06.550
they don't have market flexibility and what the owner

291
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.239
of the power lo needs, right? Is people who

292
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:15.229
can sell their labor, power to the power loom

293
00:17:15.239 --> 00:17:18.390
owner and work on the power loom in order

294
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.550
to produce massive amounts of fabrics. Ok? Um That

295
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.050
gives the owner of the power loom an incentive

296
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.109
to try to change the economic relations in their

297
00:17:30.119 --> 00:17:33.510
society, right? Um And you'll notice that on this

298
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.709
story, the motivation for changing the relations of production

299
00:17:38.439 --> 00:17:42.180
is a fairly simple economic motivation, right? I've got

300
00:17:42.189 --> 00:17:44.780
my power loom. I've got nobody to work on

301
00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.670
it again. I'm oversimplifying enormously, but I've got my

302
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.550
power loom. I've got nobody available to work on

303
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.069
it, right. This is no good. I need to

304
00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:55.719
get the serfs of the feudal estate. I need

305
00:17:55.729 --> 00:17:58.949
to break the control that the guild masters have

306
00:17:58.959 --> 00:18:01.689
over these journeymen, right? So that I can get

307
00:18:01.699 --> 00:18:04.420
them into my factory to, to run my, my

308
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.729
power lo all right. And that's gonna require changes

309
00:18:07.739 --> 00:18:11.229
in laws. It's gonna require changing where people are,

310
00:18:11.239 --> 00:18:13.410
right. Serfs are gonna have to get off the

311
00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.880
feudal estates and into the urban centers where the

312
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.859
factory is and so on. And this then precipitates

313
00:18:19.869 --> 00:18:24.425
a historical uh moment of, you know, conflict between

314
00:18:24.435 --> 00:18:28.165
classes, right? The feudal lords are now in conflict

315
00:18:28.175 --> 00:18:30.814
with the new owners of power looms, all right.

316
00:18:30.864 --> 00:18:34.324
Um The serfs see the potential of getting off

317
00:18:34.334 --> 00:18:36.755
the lousy feudal estate and into the city which

318
00:18:36.765 --> 00:18:38.885
looks more attractive and they could have some more

319
00:18:38.895 --> 00:18:41.885
money, you know, they could actually have income, right,

320
00:18:41.895 --> 00:18:44.859
which they couldn't have on the feudal estate. Um

321
00:18:44.869 --> 00:18:47.829
And so we enter a period of uh conflict

322
00:18:47.839 --> 00:18:51.790
which will ultimately result in a fundamental transformation of

323
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.760
the relations of production in society and in Marxist

324
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.530
telling give birth to capitalism.

325
00:18:58.849 --> 00:19:01.869
So I, I have to ask you is historical

326
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.239
materialism true. I mean, what sort of evidence do

327
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.459
we have to tell us whether it's true or

328
00:19:08.469 --> 00:19:08.869
not?

329
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.079
Ok. Well, so a couple of things to say

330
00:19:12.089 --> 00:19:15.920
about that. Um The first thing is that, um

331
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.619
you know, contrary to sort of simple minded critics

332
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.439
of Marx like Carl Popper, right? Um Historical materialism

333
00:19:23.449 --> 00:19:28.890
does actually make falsifiable predictions. OK? Um And uh

334
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.489
and the thing we know about historical materialism as

335
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.689
a theory of historical change, um is that its

336
00:19:34.699 --> 00:19:39.079
predictions aren't always borne out, right? Um That sometimes

337
00:19:39.089 --> 00:19:42.000
we have, for example, regress in productive power rather

338
00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:45.880
than growth in productive power, you know. Um SO,

339
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.469
but that's, that's well known. Second thing to say,

340
00:19:49.479 --> 00:19:53.209
of course is that um every grand theory of

341
00:19:53.219 --> 00:19:59.939
history um fails Brodell theory of history fails Vico

342
00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:03.380
certainly fails Hegel, certainly fails, right? That is, it

343
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.380
can't account or explain for certain phenomena, you know.

344
00:20:06.969 --> 00:20:10.939
Um However, historical materialism is probably the best of

345
00:20:10.949 --> 00:20:15.439
the bunch. Um That is uh it has attracted

346
00:20:15.449 --> 00:20:19.260
the interest of historians as a general framework for

347
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.560
the analysis of historical events um and turned out

348
00:20:23.569 --> 00:20:26.780
to be extremely productive in explaining an awful lot

349
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.859
of um historical transformation. But like every theory in

350
00:20:30.869 --> 00:20:34.739
the human sciences, um you know, uh there are

351
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:38.640
exceptions to its generalizations that the theory really can't

352
00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.739
um can't deal with. Um YOU know, as I

353
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.020
like to say, historical materialism has a very simple

354
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.920
explanation for why the Soviet Union collapsed, right? Which

355
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:51.170
is that um the Soviet Union involved relations of

356
00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:55.989
production, mainly centralized planning, right? That were totally inadequate

357
00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.469
to maximize the effective use of the existing technologies,

358
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.050
right? So the Soviet Union was outproduced by the

359
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.520
capitalist world, right? Um And lo and behold it

360
00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.880
collapsed, right? I mean, it does strangely enough fit

361
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:14.060
very nicely with, with the historical materialist view. But

362
00:21:14.489 --> 00:21:18.890
you know, the there's an enormous loosely speaking Marxist

363
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:24.209
historiography that pays attention to economic classes in conflict

364
00:21:24.219 --> 00:21:28.050
with each other, right in conflict because one class

365
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.290
can make better use of technology than another, but

366
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.109
the other class, they have to change property relations

367
00:21:34.119 --> 00:21:37.130
in order to do that. Um And this turns

368
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.760
out to be very, very illuminating about many uh

369
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.890
historical events. Uh So I think that's what we

370
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.810
can say on behalf of the, the importance of

371
00:21:45.819 --> 00:21:48.839
the theory of the grand theories of history. It's

372
00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:52.290
actually the most successful one, like all grand theories

373
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.680
of history, it fails to explain certain historical events.

374
00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:59.319
And so one of the biggest themes in Marxism

375
00:21:59.329 --> 00:22:02.489
has to do with class and class conflict. So

376
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.040
what is the class according to Marx? And how

377
00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.760
do classes develop?

378
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.699
Yeah, this is good. I I and, and we've

379
00:22:10.709 --> 00:22:12.699
already touched on some of this, you know, in,

380
00:22:12.709 --> 00:22:15.089
in answer to the last question, I was kind

381
00:22:15.099 --> 00:22:18.520
of pre suppose there's classes. So this is gonna

382
00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.630
be crucial for Marx, right? He says the history

383
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.020
of the world is the history of class conflict.

384
00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.380
So, so under this is the dynamic that's going

385
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:30.310
to um move along the the the schema of

386
00:22:30.319 --> 00:22:37.109
historical materialism, so to speak, um Marx given its

387
00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:40.020
centrality, we might of course hope that Marx, that

388
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.839
Marx is going to give us a necessary and

389
00:22:42.849 --> 00:22:45.880
sufficient conditions, et cetera, which he does not do.

390
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:51.689
Um And so, so we aren't what he's going

391
00:22:51.699 --> 00:22:56.030
to propose is that um history situates people into

392
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.859
paradigmatic cases, right? So, and this is going to

393
00:22:58.869 --> 00:23:01.339
vary and there'll be some contingency. So, but we,

394
00:23:01.349 --> 00:23:04.689
we can look uh Brian's already gone over some

395
00:23:04.699 --> 00:23:06.969
of these cases, right? In the feudal times, you

396
00:23:06.979 --> 00:23:10.849
have the monarchy. Um AND you of the serfs

397
00:23:10.859 --> 00:23:15.329
um as we move into the industrial times, right?

398
00:23:15.339 --> 00:23:19.199
We have the capitalist class, the remnants of this

399
00:23:19.209 --> 00:23:22.510
feudal society still exerting some influence. And now this

400
00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.369
new emerging working class, the proletariat um that have,

401
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.380
that are working for the capitalists. Um We can

402
00:23:30.729 --> 00:23:34.869
roughly identify these, we can identify the paradigmatic cases,

403
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.459
right? The, the uh capitalists are the ones who

404
00:23:38.469 --> 00:23:42.729
own the factories and, and given their relations, given

405
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.140
the current structure, um they're the ones that can

406
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.849
take advantage of this and so they own this

407
00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:50.819
property. They're the ones that can um hire and

408
00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:54.910
fire workers, et cetera. If you are AAA liberated

409
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.555
service, now you can move to the city where

410
00:23:57.564 --> 00:24:00.104
you can where before you had to work for

411
00:24:00.275 --> 00:24:03.814
um a particular monarch, you can now work for

412
00:24:03.824 --> 00:24:07.214
factory owner, a factory owner, b, factory owner C

413
00:24:07.314 --> 00:24:10.145
et cetera. Um But what you, but the position

414
00:24:10.155 --> 00:24:11.984
you're in when you're doing that is you own

415
00:24:11.994 --> 00:24:15.204
really nothing but your own labor power, right? So

416
00:24:15.214 --> 00:24:17.625
you don't have a lot of options. Um These,

417
00:24:17.635 --> 00:24:21.930
these are, these are your options um the aristocracy,

418
00:24:21.939 --> 00:24:25.280
obviously the, the remnants of the aristocracy, so powerful,

419
00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.439
remnants of the aristocracy, um they own the land,

420
00:24:28.449 --> 00:24:31.689
so they're essentially working as uh renting out land.

421
00:24:31.699 --> 00:24:36.319
Um Marx is not going to be concerned so

422
00:24:36.329 --> 00:24:39.489
much with, uh in between cases, the sort of

423
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.959
aspiring capitalist who may be acquiring enough money to

424
00:24:43.969 --> 00:24:48.359
consider going into business for themselves. Um He's going

425
00:24:48.369 --> 00:24:50.780
to be interested in the, the paradigmatic cases and

426
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.819
if these can explain the sort of tensions he

427
00:24:53.829 --> 00:24:58.359
sees. So, um it's also important, right? Stepping back

428
00:24:58.369 --> 00:25:02.640
for Mars, it is to not think of society

429
00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:07.209
as a um collaborative endeavor for the mutual benefit

430
00:25:07.219 --> 00:25:10.420
of everybody. He thinks that's uh mythology, what you

431
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:14.130
have instead, right? Are people who sort of secured

432
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:18.329
um advantage for themselves and use the, the political

433
00:25:18.349 --> 00:25:22.589
establishment to sort of that um for themselves to,

434
00:25:22.619 --> 00:25:26.630
to enforce that. Um But, but that's roughly the

435
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.589
picture you're going to get. So you're not gonna

436
00:25:28.599 --> 00:25:32.449
get uh a genealogy in every case of how

437
00:25:32.459 --> 00:25:35.030
every, yeah, every class came to be. But, you

438
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.170
know, you can think of the proletariat as the

439
00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.869
recently emancipated serfs by and large, et cetera. Um

440
00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.300
But that's how the division of sort of who

441
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:46.719
goes into the process works. Um What you're gonna,

442
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.079
what you're gonna have here though, Mark thinks is

443
00:25:50.089 --> 00:25:54.500
right, rather than um a collaboration, you're gonna have

444
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:59.030
tension. So the factory owners, given their position are

445
00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.160
going to be incentivized. They want to make as

446
00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.420
much, they want to take as much advantage of

447
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.719
their position as they can. So they are going

448
00:26:05.729 --> 00:26:11.880
to be incentivized to, uh, decrease, uh, wages where

449
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.280
possible increase working hours, um, where they can, et

450
00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:19.540
cetera. The working class is going to be, uh,

451
00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.599
they're gonna have opposite, uh, intention, they're going, they're

452
00:26:22.609 --> 00:26:25.380
going to be trying, fighting where they can with

453
00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:30.420
what resources they have to decrease the, uh the

454
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.609
day, the length of the working day or to

455
00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:36.380
increase wages, et cetera. So it's these sort of

456
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:40.680
tensions of the classes in competition with one another

457
00:26:40.709 --> 00:26:42.900
that, so that sets this sort of relationship of

458
00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.989
conflict in place. Um J

459
00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:49.949
can I interject something because yeah, can you give,

460
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.800
I mean, we do in the book if something

461
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.390
close to necessary and sufficient conditions for what a

462
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.510
class is and I kind of think that's what

463
00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.959
Ricardo was after. Yeah. So why don't, why don't

464
00:27:00.969 --> 00:27:02.569
you put that on the table because I think

465
00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:05.319
that would help uh in, in the conversation.

466
00:27:05.699 --> 00:27:11.849
Yeah, I mean, it's so following something like Elster,

467
00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:15.150
um we want to say something like, you know,

468
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.750
a cla you, you're a member of a class

469
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.349
in virtue of given your stake in the means,

470
00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:24.949
you know, your ownership of the means of production.

471
00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.479
Um What are you best positioned? How are you

472
00:27:29.489 --> 00:27:32.270
best positioned to sort of maximize what's going on

473
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.420
for you? Right. So if you're a factory worker

474
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.239
again. Right. If you're a factory, how do we

475
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.449
know the factory owners say the factory owners are

476
00:27:39.459 --> 00:27:42.739
the ones that own the factories and can make

477
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.810
best use of their position in the economic structure

478
00:27:45.819 --> 00:27:49.410
by like we were saying before, um, getting as

479
00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.390
much labor for as little as they can if

480
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.890
you're a working class person, right? You're, you're approaching

481
00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:59.130
the market that what you need to do to

482
00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.750
get by is you need to sell your labor.

483
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.880
You have no other options available. So you're incentivized

484
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:09.599
on pain of starvation as it were in this

485
00:28:09.609 --> 00:28:14.670
case, right? To go find work at the factory,

486
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.310
whatever, whatever you think of that work. But that's,

487
00:28:17.319 --> 00:28:19.339
that's, that's what your best position to do. If

488
00:28:19.349 --> 00:28:23.532
you're uh um member of the aristocracy who's sort

489
00:28:23.542 --> 00:28:27.123
of losing its, losing its power in the new

490
00:28:27.133 --> 00:28:30.363
industrial revolution, but you still own all the land,

491
00:28:30.772 --> 00:28:34.883
you're gonna be incentivized to rent your land and

492
00:28:34.892 --> 00:28:37.453
make as much from money as you can from

493
00:28:37.463 --> 00:28:39.912
that land. So again, it's, there's going to be

494
00:28:39.922 --> 00:28:42.676
in between cases, but you can see people sort

495
00:28:42.686 --> 00:28:46.666
of sorted in broad categories based on where they

496
00:28:46.676 --> 00:28:48.166
stand in the, in the

497
00:28:50.605 --> 00:28:51.526
particular, on what they own

498
00:28:51.965 --> 00:28:53.686
and particular on what they own, right?

499
00:28:54.005 --> 00:28:56.906
What, what productive they own or control.

500
00:28:56.985 --> 00:28:59.086
Yeah, I would, yeah, fact we might say like

501
00:28:59.095 --> 00:29:02.786
what they effectively control, right? Because um that might

502
00:29:02.796 --> 00:29:04.975
be a better way to put it. Um Yeah,

503
00:29:05.735 --> 00:29:07.765
but then with all of that in mind, with

504
00:29:07.776 --> 00:29:08.576
the square.

505
00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:14.109
Yeah. So class consciousness is for marks, this is

506
00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:18.810
important, right? It's not um it's you, you, you

507
00:29:18.819 --> 00:29:20.619
can be whether you are a member of a

508
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:22.750
class or not. If you're in a paradigmatic, you

509
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.589
know, you're paradigmatic, a member of a class or

510
00:29:24.599 --> 00:29:27.489
not, is a fact about you, an objective fact

511
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.209
about you, right? Um You may or may not

512
00:29:31.689 --> 00:29:35.170
be cognizant of the, the significance that plays in

513
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.430
the structure, right? You may know, right. I'm, I'm

514
00:29:37.439 --> 00:29:40.359
a worker. I know I have to go work

515
00:29:40.369 --> 00:29:41.829
for a salary to make a living. I know

516
00:29:41.839 --> 00:29:45.819
that part. But you're not thinking about necessarily, you're

517
00:29:45.829 --> 00:29:48.319
not thinking about the role of all the other

518
00:29:48.329 --> 00:29:50.229
workers, et cetera, et cetera. You're not, you're not

519
00:29:50.239 --> 00:29:52.800
stepping back to think about sort of the incentive

520
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:54.829
structure of the economy as a whole and the

521
00:29:54.839 --> 00:29:57.280
way it's organized and maybe the ways that you're

522
00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.760
pitted against et cetera, those sort of things you're,

523
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.260
you're, you're not necessarily conscious of, but Mark says

524
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.819
you can become conscious of. So for instance, he

525
00:30:05.829 --> 00:30:11.939
thought um the the peasants in France were a

526
00:30:11.949 --> 00:30:15.489
class um but did not have class consciousness in

527
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.780
part because they were separated on farms, they weren't

528
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.560
interacting with one another, et cetera, et cetera. So

529
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:24.229
it's, it was a true fact about them that

530
00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:26.339
they were a member of a class, but they

531
00:30:26.349 --> 00:30:28.780
weren't thinking about it in terms of, they weren't

532
00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.800
making aware, conscious to themselves. Hey, I'm a member

533
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:34.130
of a class. These are my interest, my interests

534
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.239
are in fact pitted against this other group. Perhaps

535
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:40.050
we should organize, etcetera, etcetera, leverage what we can

536
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.150
to sort of um maximize our benefits. Um

537
00:30:43.829 --> 00:30:46.199
Can I interject just on that? Because, because I

538
00:30:46.209 --> 00:30:48.719
think that touches on the crucial thing, I mean,

539
00:30:48.729 --> 00:30:51.310
to be conscious of your membership in a class

540
00:30:51.319 --> 00:30:53.109
is to be conscious that in virtue of your

541
00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:57.569
position in the economy, right? You have certain interests

542
00:30:57.630 --> 00:30:59.619
and these interests are shared with other people who

543
00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:03.109
are in the same economic position, right? And that's

544
00:31:03.119 --> 00:31:05.949
what class consciousness mean. And this is why they

545
00:31:05.959 --> 00:31:08.390
thought Marx and Engels thought of the Communist Party

546
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.310
as the instrumentality for producing class consciousness for helping

547
00:31:13.319 --> 00:31:17.239
the vast number of laborers in the new industrial

548
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:20.839
economy. Understand that they had similar economic interests and

549
00:31:20.849 --> 00:31:23.560
that their economic interests were totally opposed to the

550
00:31:23.569 --> 00:31:26.979
economic interests of the factory owners, the capitalists that

551
00:31:26.989 --> 00:31:28.660
they, that they work for. I think that's the

552
00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:32.119
crux of class consciousness is consciousness of what your

553
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.020
shared interests are given your economic position.

554
00:31:37.459 --> 00:31:42.489
So, a and then how does Marx characterize capitalism

555
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.170
and what are perhaps the main positive and negative

556
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.650
aspects of ca capitalism that he identifies?

557
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.560
Ok. Uh I guess I'll try to take that

558
00:31:52.569 --> 00:31:55.369
one to start but Jamie feel free to jump

559
00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:00.199
in. Um OK, so it's very important for Marx

560
00:32:00.209 --> 00:32:03.869
that, you know, capitalism represents a distinctive way of

561
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:09.839
organizing production in, in a society. OK. Um And

562
00:32:09.849 --> 00:32:14.719
the distinctive feature of capitalism for Marx, um it's

563
00:32:14.729 --> 00:32:16.939
not just that you have people who, you know,

564
00:32:16.949 --> 00:32:20.660
own books. Are you a, are we still there?

565
00:32:21.719 --> 00:32:25.170
Sorry, I, I the screen just disappeared. Did you,

566
00:32:25.369 --> 00:32:26.949
should I start again? Ricardo?

567
00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:31.329
Uh I mean, I didn't miss anything from that

568
00:32:31.459 --> 00:32:32.489
that you said so

569
00:32:32.939 --> 00:32:37.839
sorry, my screen disappeared. Um The, the distinctive feature

570
00:32:37.849 --> 00:32:43.020
of capitalism um is that um he defines it

571
00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:47.069
in terms of an exchange relation. Um You know,

572
00:32:47.079 --> 00:32:51.839
one kind of exchange relation is where, um you

573
00:32:51.849 --> 00:32:58.609
know, uh I um I do some work, all

574
00:32:58.619 --> 00:33:02.800
right. Um In order to buy a commodity, something,

575
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:05.729
some object that I just wanna use for myself.

576
00:33:05.829 --> 00:33:11.040
OK. Um And the distinctive thing about capitalism is

577
00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:14.520
that the ultimate object of it is not simply

578
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:18.910
to get something right that I can immediately use,

579
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.219
right? Um You know, to buy a chicken, cook

580
00:33:22.229 --> 00:33:24.859
it and eat it and it's gone, right? The

581
00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:29.489
distinctive feature of capitalism is that capitalists engage in

582
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:33.530
exchange in order to get more money capital, right?

583
00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:36.699
So the the form of capitalist exchange is either

584
00:33:36.709 --> 00:33:41.069
the capitalist lay out money to buy technology, rent

585
00:33:41.079 --> 00:33:45.819
a factory, rent, land, hire workers produce a commodity

586
00:33:45.829 --> 00:33:48.420
not to be used by me, the capitalist, but

587
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.410
to be sold in order to get more money,

588
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.819
right? That's really the distinctive thing is that the

589
00:33:53.829 --> 00:33:57.930
entire ra zone detro of capitalists is to engage

590
00:33:57.939 --> 00:34:00.270
in production in order to produce more money at

591
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.140
the end, a sub more than what they put

592
00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:05.859
uh in at the, at the start. So he

593
00:34:05.869 --> 00:34:09.639
describes it as, you know, it's m money to

594
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:13.159
pur purchase commodities to get M prime that is

595
00:34:13.168 --> 00:34:16.590
extra money at the, at the end. All right.

596
00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.080
Um Commodities is a term of art from Mars.

597
00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:23.300
Commodity is something that is produced with the intention

598
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:26.149
of selling it to someone else, right? So it's

599
00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:30.840
not simply production for personal use. Um Commodity production

600
00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:35.344
exists prior to capitalism, but capitalism organizes it in

601
00:34:35.353 --> 00:34:40.405
this very distinctive form where commodity production occurs at

602
00:34:40.415 --> 00:34:42.264
the behest of capitalists who are looking to get

603
00:34:42.274 --> 00:34:45.293
more money as the outcome of that process and

604
00:34:45.304 --> 00:34:48.735
then to start the whole um uh the whole

605
00:34:48.745 --> 00:34:54.050
s uh sequence once again. OK. Now, um why

606
00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:57.709
is capitalism important in the, in the history of

607
00:34:57.719 --> 00:35:00.659
the world? Well, a very sim simple minded way

608
00:35:00.669 --> 00:35:03.419
of putting it would be without capitalism? No communism,

609
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.469
right? Which is why the question is capitalism good

610
00:35:06.479 --> 00:35:10.000
or bad is not a Marx question, right? Without

611
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.290
capitalism, communism is impossible. And we'll return to, to

612
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.689
why that is, it's actually related to the most

613
00:35:15.699 --> 00:35:18.840
positive thing about capitalism, which is Marx thinks that

614
00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:23.250
this incentive structure where you want as a capitalist,

615
00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.090
you wanna spend money in order to engage in

616
00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.280
a productive process. That will get you more money

617
00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:34.149
out in the end, creates a remarkable incentive for

618
00:35:34.159 --> 00:35:38.290
people to try to develop technology, right? Because think

619
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.600
of the question, how do I get more money

620
00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:43.879
out of the productive process than I put into

621
00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.669
it in the first place, right? I have certain

622
00:35:46.679 --> 00:35:48.949
fixed costs, right? I have to pay for labor

623
00:35:48.959 --> 00:35:52.389
power, right? I have to pay for the technology,

624
00:35:52.399 --> 00:35:55.300
the maintenance of it, the acquisition of it. Um

625
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:58.610
AND so on. Um I can sometimes, you know,

626
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.820
reduce what I pay the workers, right? Which will

627
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:06.120
increase my profit margin. Um uh SOMETIMES I can

628
00:36:06.129 --> 00:36:08.080
get the workers to work more for the same

629
00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:10.889
wage, right? And so they produce more, that'll increase

630
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.709
my my profit margin. Um But other times I

631
00:36:15.719 --> 00:36:18.939
can invest in technology that will allow the same

632
00:36:18.949 --> 00:36:22.050
workers at the same wage to produce much more

633
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.620
than they could have otherwise. Ok, let me go

634
00:36:24.629 --> 00:36:27.780
back to our power loom example, right? You know,

635
00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:31.820
you could have 100 individual weavers working away in

636
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:34.959
your faco factory or you could have just five

637
00:36:34.969 --> 00:36:37.280
of them working the power loom and they'll produce

638
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:41.090
the exact same quantity of goods. OK. This marks

639
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.669
things creates an endless incentive for capitalists to innovate

640
00:36:45.679 --> 00:36:47.959
in technology because that is one of the ways

641
00:36:47.969 --> 00:36:51.040
in which they increase their profit margins and increasing

642
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:52.639
their profit margin is the point of the whole

643
00:36:52.649 --> 00:36:55.090
exercise. The whole exercise is meant to produce more

644
00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.739
money. OK. Um And this is where Marx, you

645
00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:02.649
know, agrees with my colleagues in the Chicago School

646
00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:06.840
of, of economics that capitalism, right? Is it an

647
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:11.459
extr the most productive, economically productive system in the

648
00:37:11.469 --> 00:37:16.580
history of humanity? Right? Um The problem marks things,

649
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:21.189
right is that the logic of capitalism is necessarily

650
00:37:21.199 --> 00:37:23.969
going to have a very bad ending. OK. For

651
00:37:23.979 --> 00:37:27.860
the following reason, uh um if capitalists have an

652
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:34.659
endless incentive to increase productive power through technological innovation,

653
00:37:34.709 --> 00:37:38.409
which they clearly do, all right. Um The effect

654
00:37:38.419 --> 00:37:40.820
of technological innovation is to reduce the need for

655
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:45.850
human labor power. OK. Um So it displaces certain

656
00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:49.310
human labor power. Marx thinks at the limit, right?

657
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.929
At some point, this capitalist capacity for developing technology

658
00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:57.800
is gonna eliminate almost all need for human labor

659
00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.510
power. And that's a big problem if what most

660
00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.790
people have to sell is their labor power, right?

661
00:38:03.889 --> 00:38:07.520
If you don't have any buyers, right, you're going

662
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.879
to be in a very bad economic state. But

663
00:38:09.889 --> 00:38:12.379
the irony is, it's also gonna be fatal to

664
00:38:12.389 --> 00:38:16.800
capitalism because capitalism needs buyers, right? I give you

665
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:18.770
an anecdote that we use in the book, but

666
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:22.489
it illustrates this very nicely. Um uh The head

667
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.830
of the United Auto Workers Labor Union in the

668
00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.090
United States is visiting a Ford Motor plant where

669
00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.840
they just installed a bunch of robots to replace

670
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:34.899
human laborers who work on the assembly line. And

671
00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:38.979
the Ford Motor Company executives says, look at these

672
00:38:38.989 --> 00:38:42.639
robots. And he says to Walter Reuther, the famous

673
00:38:42.649 --> 00:38:44.629
head of the labor and he says, try to

674
00:38:44.639 --> 00:38:49.290
organize these robots, right? You can't, they don't need

675
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.179
a labor union. And Rouer says, try to sell

676
00:38:52.189 --> 00:38:55.500
them your cars. Ok? And that was the, and

677
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:57.659
that was in a way the essential point Mars

678
00:38:57.709 --> 00:39:00.639
was making is if you displace human labor power

679
00:39:00.649 --> 00:39:04.159
to too great an extent, right? There's gonna be

680
00:39:04.169 --> 00:39:06.479
no one to purchase the commodities you produce. And

681
00:39:06.489 --> 00:39:09.459
at that point, capitalism is over, all right. Capitalism

682
00:39:09.469 --> 00:39:12.459
is over because the whole point of capitalist production

683
00:39:12.629 --> 00:39:14.830
is profit and you can't make profit if you

684
00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.250
can't sell the commodities you produce. Right? It's pretty

685
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.899
simple. Ok. And so Marx thinks that this is

686
00:39:20.909 --> 00:39:24.209
the fundamental reason. Now there's other accounts you can

687
00:39:24.219 --> 00:39:25.679
find in Marx. But I think this is the

688
00:39:25.689 --> 00:39:29.899
most plausible of the reasons he identifies why capitalism

689
00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:32.709
is eventually going to come to an end. That

690
00:39:32.719 --> 00:39:34.510
doesn't, by the way mean it's going to be

691
00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:38.520
replaced with communism. This is here when we disagree

692
00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:41.459
with him in the book about this. Um, YOU

693
00:39:41.469 --> 00:39:45.189
know, here the sort of teleological view that necessarily

694
00:39:45.199 --> 00:39:49.389
communism is what replaces capitalism, where communism would mean

695
00:39:49.689 --> 00:39:55.080
using the amazing technology and productive power created by

696
00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:58.620
capitalism to produce things to meet human needs, right?

697
00:39:58.629 --> 00:40:01.909
Rather than to generate profit. And that's certainly one

698
00:40:01.919 --> 00:40:03.919
way it could go, right. The other way it

699
00:40:03.929 --> 00:40:06.379
could go, of course, is that the capitalist class

700
00:40:06.389 --> 00:40:09.820
just uh walls itself off from everyone else, pays

701
00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:12.709
some people for security and produces what it needs

702
00:40:12.719 --> 00:40:16.679
to live very well. Um And you know, Rosa

703
00:40:16.689 --> 00:40:19.580
Luxembourg, a famous Marxist theorist and revolutionary in the

704
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.409
early 20th century said the choice is gonna become

705
00:40:22.419 --> 00:40:27.260
socialism or barbarism, right? Um Socialism would be we

706
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:31.030
use enormous productive power in order to liberate people

707
00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.469
from the need to work, to survive and to

708
00:40:33.479 --> 00:40:36.419
meet their needs and allow them to engage in

709
00:40:36.429 --> 00:40:39.989
free productive activities. Marx puts it, uh the other

710
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.979
alternative would be where, you know, through barbaric force,

711
00:40:42.989 --> 00:40:46.419
those who control productive power, use it for themselves

712
00:40:46.429 --> 00:40:52.320
and let everyone else rot basically. Um And uh

713
00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:54.330
we're gonna have an election next week in the

714
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.449
United States. It's not socialism versus barbarism, but there

715
00:40:57.459 --> 00:41:00.070
is barbarism on one side. We'll see how it

716
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.419
goes. Uh

717
00:41:02.739 --> 00:41:05.219
So, uh let me ask you then because of

718
00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:08.909
course, people use a lot, the word communist and

719
00:41:08.919 --> 00:41:13.419
communist society and of course, particularly now after uh

720
00:41:13.429 --> 00:41:17.250
things like the Soviet Union and Mao's China, we

721
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:21.550
tend to associate communism with them. But what did

722
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.669
Mars mean by communism or communist society or did

723
00:41:25.679 --> 00:41:27.629
they have much to say about that? And if

724
00:41:27.639 --> 00:41:30.459
so would it, what would it look like,

725
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:33.110
Jamie? I'm gonna let you take this, you can

726
00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.270
talk about the two phases of Yeah. And I

727
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:38.219
think this is more your daily. Yeah.

728
00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:40.629
Good. I mean, it's So, you know, Marx didn't

729
00:41:40.639 --> 00:41:42.770
invent the term communism, right? So this is part

730
00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.080
of he's coming of age, right? In a, in

731
00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:47.510
a time where people are thinking through these ideas.

732
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:51.040
Um What's so, you know, so people often look

733
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.870
to Marx, right? What is, what exactly is this

734
00:41:52.879 --> 00:41:55.850
vision gonna be et cetera? And it's worth noting

735
00:41:55.860 --> 00:42:00.000
here that he has relatively little to say about

736
00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:02.189
it for somebody who's written so much, right? So,

737
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.760
so most of what we get, especially, you know,

738
00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:09.610
in Capitol is a critique of, of the dynamics

739
00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.649
of capital that Brian just went through. Um It's

740
00:42:12.659 --> 00:42:15.060
not a, it's not a program for the future,

741
00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.159
what the future is going to look like. Um

742
00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:21.379
We do get some indications though, right? So he

743
00:42:21.389 --> 00:42:23.520
is, so this is so it's important for him

744
00:42:23.919 --> 00:42:26.629
to distinguish him from the sort of utopians that

745
00:42:26.639 --> 00:42:30.929
the utopian socialists that he uh opposed, right? So

746
00:42:30.939 --> 00:42:33.189
their project is going to be one of, of

747
00:42:33.199 --> 00:42:35.409
laying out what the goods of a new society

748
00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:37.000
are going to be, what it could look like,

749
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:40.510
maybe trying on the margins um to, you know,

750
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.754
develop some s some communities in part to practice

751
00:42:43.764 --> 00:42:46.735
this. Marx was not interested in any of this

752
00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:49.385
and for the reasons Brian said he, so he

753
00:42:49.395 --> 00:42:52.655
thought communism was coming, it was gonna have a

754
00:42:52.725 --> 00:42:55.995
certain form but, but it's, it's going to follow

755
00:42:56.004 --> 00:43:01.844
the natural progression of capitalism disintegrating. OK. Um What

756
00:43:01.854 --> 00:43:05.864
will he he does say things though, programmatically here

757
00:43:05.875 --> 00:43:08.185
and there and suggest certain things through letters, et

758
00:43:08.195 --> 00:43:10.245
cetera. We don't want to put too much on

759
00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:13.790
this. But, but, but he says something. So what

760
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.129
he does say is he thinks that um the,

761
00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:21.290
the, the there will be a revolution. Uh We

762
00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.209
don't, we, we it's going to come in the

763
00:43:23.219 --> 00:43:27.030
most advanced countries again for the reasons that historical

764
00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.889
materialism predicts um historical materialism, we get the goods

765
00:43:31.899 --> 00:43:35.709
of capitalism. Um But the problem is we have

766
00:43:35.719 --> 00:43:38.570
this mass of the miser people. And so the

767
00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.959
solution, Mars Banks is going to be available with

768
00:43:42.969 --> 00:43:45.379
a little consciousness raising will be available to the

769
00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:48.850
working class itself, right? So he's, he's thinking especially

770
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.709
we now have a working class. I think Germany

771
00:43:51.719 --> 00:43:55.100
England of his time, the most advanced industrial classes

772
00:43:55.250 --> 00:44:01.060
uh are countries. Um The workers are now together

773
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:06.520
in factories. They're, they're organized under the labor process.

774
00:44:06.729 --> 00:44:11.989
There are lots of workers. Um They are increasingly

775
00:44:12.699 --> 00:44:15.719
a miser and aware of this as they're watching.

776
00:44:15.969 --> 00:44:20.610
The fact are increasingly enriched. Um And so they're

777
00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:22.679
able to identify, not only are they a miser,

778
00:44:22.899 --> 00:44:25.399
it, but they're able to identify the source of

779
00:44:25.409 --> 00:44:29.620
their em miration. Um And in the easiest case,

780
00:44:29.629 --> 00:44:32.379
you know, you can just lock the factory owners

781
00:44:32.389 --> 00:44:34.939
out. It's, it's almost something like that. Marx has

782
00:44:34.959 --> 00:44:37.219
in mind in the early days. But you, but,

783
00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.260
ok, so you have this class, it's going to

784
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.429
be conscious, Marx is open and this is where

785
00:44:42.439 --> 00:44:45.060
I think he's genuinely not an a priori thinker

786
00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:47.479
like he is, he is attentive to what's unfolding

787
00:44:47.489 --> 00:44:52.070
on the ground. And there are times where he's

788
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.000
early on thinks it's necessarily going to be an

789
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:59.449
armed revolution. Um COMING out of the 1848 days.

790
00:44:59.459 --> 00:45:02.979
Uh This is obviously in the air after some

791
00:45:02.989 --> 00:45:06.080
time in England, he thinks it's possible that the

792
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:12.340
working class could leverage uh the the ballot in

793
00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:15.399
order to take control. Um But he does think

794
00:45:15.409 --> 00:45:17.760
there's there's problem and now we're just getting into

795
00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:20.570
him sort of predicting not saying with determination what's

796
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.909
gonna happen. He thinks it probably will be an

797
00:45:22.919 --> 00:45:25.239
armed conflict at some point or other either to

798
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:29.439
take control um through armed conflict or if the

799
00:45:29.449 --> 00:45:32.989
proletariat take it through the ballot, he expects there

800
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.689
will be a reaction from the factory owner. So

801
00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:37.659
at some point, there will probably be an armed

802
00:45:37.949 --> 00:45:42.360
insurrection or backlash uh from the, from the factory

803
00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:45.560
owners. And so it's at this point, we, this

804
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:47.600
is where Marx is now suggesting two things. So

805
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.219
we get this sort of first phase of communism

806
00:45:50.229 --> 00:45:52.600
again, just as a suggestion, not as a program,

807
00:45:52.649 --> 00:45:56.169
uh first phase of communism and then uh what

808
00:45:56.179 --> 00:45:58.510
he calls the higher form. So at the first

809
00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.790
phase, he suggests that there will be a dictatorship

810
00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.923
of the polar, which is a scary term for

811
00:46:06.933 --> 00:46:08.583
uh many of us. Now having lived through the

812
00:46:08.593 --> 00:46:11.903
20th century. But it's important for Marx uh uh

813
00:46:11.952 --> 00:46:15.943
uh dictatorship didn't mean what it's come to me.

814
00:46:15.952 --> 00:46:18.853
Now, he thought it would be a temporary phase

815
00:46:18.863 --> 00:46:21.512
in which the working class sees power, make sure

816
00:46:21.522 --> 00:46:24.002
that they can kind of keep down any reactionary

817
00:46:24.012 --> 00:46:27.895
uprisings, et cetera, et cetera in this early phase.

818
00:46:27.946 --> 00:46:29.815
Marx thinks there will be sort of an, an

819
00:46:29.825 --> 00:46:33.525
economic principle that will be. He does, you know,

820
00:46:33.535 --> 00:46:35.895
again, he's just venturing here, but he thinks something

821
00:46:35.906 --> 00:46:37.986
like a coupon system or something, he thinks the

822
00:46:37.996 --> 00:46:41.196
old capitalist system will still be sort of uh

823
00:46:41.595 --> 00:46:44.795
have a little afterlife and people will expect to

824
00:46:44.805 --> 00:46:47.045
get what put, get back what they put in

825
00:46:47.055 --> 00:46:50.120
or something like this. Um But he thinks this

826
00:46:50.129 --> 00:46:53.540
will transition, how quickly this will transition. He doesn't

827
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:56.070
say he's quite, um but he thinks this will

828
00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:01.040
transition economically again as the, as the, the uh

829
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:05.709
richness of the economy that capitalism made possible is

830
00:47:05.719 --> 00:47:08.350
really harnessed. It will be, it will come a

831
00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.540
point when the principle of justice, Mark says is

832
00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:15.939
uh you know, uh each according to his needs.

833
00:47:15.949 --> 00:47:18.860
Um So it's, it's not going. So, Mark thinks

834
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:21.580
there'll be uh an abundance there. And at this

835
00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:26.959
moment, he suggests that something like the political state

836
00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:30.989
will wither away what that means. It remains a

837
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.060
bit vague. Um A bit vague, a lot vague.

838
00:47:34.219 --> 00:47:37.120
Um But it's something like, you know, Marx clearly

839
00:47:37.129 --> 00:47:40.810
has this view of politics as the way that

840
00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:45.580
a dominant class harnesses uh economic or harnesses political

841
00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:49.399
power to sort of subjugate. Um The underclasses Marx

842
00:47:49.409 --> 00:47:52.010
thinks in this revolution, there will be no underclasses.

843
00:47:52.379 --> 00:47:53.379
And so at

844
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.939
least

845
00:47:53.949 --> 00:47:57.810
this sort of pejorative role the state plays um

846
00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:02.399
of, of favoring, of being an unfair referee is

847
00:48:02.409 --> 00:48:05.520
going to wither away. Um But that, that's sort

848
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.560
of the, that's as much as we're really given

849
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.030
of what the communist, the uh life is going

850
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:14.110
to be. And, and this is just consistent, I

851
00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.040
mean, this can be frustrating for uh people reading

852
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:19.860
Marx, but this is very consistent with historical materialism.

853
00:48:20.139 --> 00:48:25.530
He thinks that uh our ideas, the things we

854
00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:28.479
value, the possible things we consider. All of these

855
00:48:28.489 --> 00:48:31.909
things are follow from the sort of material conditions

856
00:48:31.919 --> 00:48:33.969
that are available and, and when we're thinking about

857
00:48:33.979 --> 00:48:36.929
a communist society, we're thinking about a transformation of

858
00:48:36.939 --> 00:48:40.459
the material conditions. So what direction that's going to

859
00:48:40.469 --> 00:48:43.189
take? Mark thinks will just is a, is a

860
00:48:43.199 --> 00:48:45.689
historical matter to be determined.

861
00:48:46.729 --> 00:48:49.030
Let me, let me follow up on this, Ricardo,

862
00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:52.159
if I might just put this in, just make

863
00:48:52.169 --> 00:48:57.060
this very concrete, right. Um You know, it's, it's,

864
00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:59.969
it's often objected to Marx to say, well, people

865
00:48:59.979 --> 00:49:03.590
are basically self-interest, right. Marx doesn't deny that by

866
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.860
the way. All right. Um uh YOU know, but

867
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.550
uh at least the way in which people are

868
00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.300
self interested now is presumably partly a function of

869
00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:17.050
the circumstances under which they live. Right. Um, SO

870
00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:18.870
think of it this way, suppose we did not

871
00:49:18.879 --> 00:49:22.770
live in a society or an economy, right? Um,

872
00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:26.770
IN which you had to devote most of your

873
00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:30.550
life to activity simply in order to earn a

874
00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.860
wage. Right. Suppose it was a society with productive

875
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:37.000
abundance and, and we are of the view, I'm

876
00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:38.820
definitely the view, but I think Jamie is too

877
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:43.280
that, uh, on, on Marx's view, productive abundance is

878
00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:47.719
a necessary condition for any alternative, any humane alternative

879
00:49:47.729 --> 00:49:52.199
to, to capitalism, which is why um Mao should

880
00:49:52.209 --> 00:49:55.270
not have been a communist. Why Lenin sort of

881
00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:59.669
understood this, but then circumstances over overtook him. Um

882
00:49:59.679 --> 00:50:02.840
YOU know, Russia and China were agricultural societies. They

883
00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:06.610
had no business pretending to be communist. Um And

884
00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:09.879
you know, so productive abundance is required. Suppose we

885
00:50:09.889 --> 00:50:13.399
have productive abundance, suppose productive abundance is used to

886
00:50:13.409 --> 00:50:19.639
liberate people from uh the struggle to survive, right?

887
00:50:19.879 --> 00:50:22.280
So that Ricardo, you are free to produce the

888
00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:24.409
dissenter. You don't have to worry about paying the

889
00:50:24.419 --> 00:50:28.350
bills or the rent, right? And Jamie and I

890
00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.919
are free to teach what we want to teach

891
00:50:30.929 --> 00:50:33.159
or write, right? And other people are free to

892
00:50:33.169 --> 00:50:37.520
engage in other activities that are meaningful and, and

893
00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:41.260
satisfying to them. Um If we aren't locked in

894
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:45.239
a constant struggle for survival, it's quite possible our

895
00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:48.250
motives and our values might be very different. Indeed,

896
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:52.649
it seems somewhat likely. Um YOU know, just as

897
00:50:52.659 --> 00:50:56.560
you find within a functional family. Um, YOU know,

898
00:50:56.889 --> 00:50:59.360
people don't act on the basis of self-interest all

899
00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:01.790
the time. Why not? Well, because they aren't locked

900
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:04.570
in a struggle for survival with each other. So,

901
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.199
too, if it could be, if it could be

902
00:51:06.209 --> 00:51:09.649
replicated at a, at a society wide level, one

903
00:51:09.659 --> 00:51:13.149
might expect that people's motivations will be, will be

904
00:51:13.159 --> 00:51:16.429
quite different. Um, AND I do think that is

905
00:51:16.439 --> 00:51:18.510
part of Marx's picture and it's why as Jamie

906
00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.000
was saying, he doesn't want to write the cookbooks

907
00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:23.560
for the chefs in the future. Uh That's his

908
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:26.770
famous metaphor for this. Um Some of this will

909
00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:31.739
emerge under new material and economic conditions, right? That

910
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:34.169
being said, I think it's fair to say that

911
00:51:34.179 --> 00:51:37.620
the word communism has been so damaged by the

912
00:51:37.629 --> 00:51:41.260
tyrants of the 20th century that Marx needs a

913
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:44.469
new word to describe this kind of humane way

914
00:51:44.479 --> 00:51:48.489
of organizing social production. Um Because there's just no

915
00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:51.870
way around the fact that, you know, between Stalin

916
00:51:51.879 --> 00:51:55.219
and Mao, you know, and, and the tyrants in

917
00:51:55.229 --> 00:51:58.610
East Europe, you know, Ceausescu and so on, right?

918
00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:04.120
Communism is damaged goods as a, as a concept.

919
00:52:04.129 --> 00:52:08.129
So we need a different concept to describe circumstances

920
00:52:08.139 --> 00:52:11.199
where immense productive power is used in order to

921
00:52:11.209 --> 00:52:14.290
free people to engage in the kind of activities

922
00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:16.810
they want to engage in rather than giving over

923
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.949
their lives to work. They would rather not do

924
00:52:18.959 --> 00:52:21.050
if given the choice, which is the lives of

925
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.469
most people. Right. I mean, there's just no way,

926
00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:26.840
uh, around that. Um, AND of course it's never

927
00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:30.929
discussed, you know, in, uh, in democracies that way.

928
00:52:30.939 --> 00:52:33.090
But that is the reality that Marx is very

929
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:36.050
alert to that people spend their entire lives coerced

930
00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:39.070
in effect by the marketplace to do things they

931
00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.459
probably really don't want to do but they have

932
00:52:41.469 --> 00:52:44.649
to do on pain of, you know, I miration,

933
00:52:44.659 --> 00:52:45.929
starvation and so on.

934
00:52:46.189 --> 00:52:49.770
So, but the sort of related to that Marx

935
00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:53.469
was also interested in what constitutes a good life

936
00:52:53.479 --> 00:52:57.070
for humans. And uh uh before we get into

937
00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.550
the good life itself, let me ask you because

938
00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.649
this is very interesting to me because there are

939
00:53:01.659 --> 00:53:05.010
many people out there who I hear accusing Mars

940
00:53:05.449 --> 00:53:09.729
of denying human nature of being an extreme environment,

941
00:53:09.739 --> 00:53:13.479
environmentalist, so to speak when it comes to psychology,

942
00:53:13.489 --> 00:53:17.959
sociology, for example. Uh So did they recognize any

943
00:53:17.969 --> 00:53:20.560
kind of human nature?

944
00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:23.679
Yeah. So the answer to that is quite clearly,

945
00:53:23.689 --> 00:53:27.939
yes. Um uh You know, now I think the

946
00:53:27.949 --> 00:53:31.060
I I think the critics, you, you allude to

947
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:34.399
who, you know, I mean, the most famous, right?

948
00:53:34.409 --> 00:53:37.479
I mean, Steven Pinker, right? Says some people think

949
00:53:37.489 --> 00:53:40.419
that human beings are a blank slate and mark

950
00:53:40.429 --> 00:53:43.689
certainly didn't think they were a blank slate. Um

951
00:53:43.909 --> 00:53:47.949
What he does think is that some attributes that

952
00:53:47.959 --> 00:53:50.870
are said to be features of human nature are

953
00:53:50.879 --> 00:53:56.570
often artifacts of particular socio-economic forms of organization. That

954
00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.489
was my point about the example of the ex

955
00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:01.669
you know, the rational man of economics, right is

956
00:54:01.679 --> 00:54:04.040
always instrumentally rational in trying to get what he

957
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:08.199
wants. OK. And under capitalism, that's exactly how you

958
00:54:08.209 --> 00:54:11.409
better be or you'll be destroyed. OK. Does that

959
00:54:11.419 --> 00:54:14.830
mean that people by nature are that way or

960
00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:18.110
that people act that way under circumstances where that's

961
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.929
the condition of economic survival, so that Marx is

962
00:54:20.939 --> 00:54:23.530
quite skeptical about, right? And I think you've got

963
00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.520
to be skeptical about uh about that. On the

964
00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:29.899
other hand, he has a very substantive view about

965
00:54:29.909 --> 00:54:35.540
human nature. Um He articulates it primarily uh explicitly

966
00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:39.850
in his early work of the 1844 period. Um

967
00:54:39.929 --> 00:54:42.500
BUT some of the ideas remain in the background

968
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:44.419
all the way into the mature Marx. He ST

969
00:54:44.429 --> 00:54:46.679
he kind of stopped writing about it. He loses

970
00:54:46.689 --> 00:54:48.979
interest in it in part because of one of

971
00:54:48.989 --> 00:54:51.649
his differences with the, with the left young Gallian

972
00:54:51.659 --> 00:54:54.530
Jamie talked about earlier, which is, he doesn't think

973
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:58.800
moral exhortation is gonna change anything. All right, societies

974
00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:02.060
don't change because you give a good sermon, right?

975
00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:06.070
Um Societies change when the material circumstances are right

976
00:55:06.159 --> 00:55:08.540
for them to change. And then you need to

977
00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:11.820
appeal to the self-interest of the largest economic class.

978
00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:14.889
Um THAT'S where class consciousness comes in, you know,

979
00:55:15.139 --> 00:55:17.510
but in the early writings, he, he spells this

980
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.760
out, right? So one of the things he thinks

981
00:55:20.770 --> 00:55:22.919
and this is the the core to his view.

982
00:55:22.929 --> 00:55:25.679
And it's a view that he shares with Hegel.

983
00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:28.159
He shares with uh many of the ancient Greek

984
00:55:28.169 --> 00:55:32.949
philosophers, especially Aristotle um is the idea that um

985
00:55:33.189 --> 00:55:35.860
for human beings to lead a good life, right,

986
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:38.850
to flourish, as we often say, is for them

987
00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:44.459
to realize their essential nature. OK. So right there,

988
00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:46.330
if that's the case, then you gotta know what

989
00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:49.270
is their essential nature. And Marx thinks the essential

990
00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.469
nature of human beings is that they want to

991
00:55:51.479 --> 00:55:54.810
engage in productive activity, right? That it is not

992
00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:56.679
in the nature of human beings to lie on

993
00:55:56.689 --> 00:56:00.389
the sofa all day and watch television. OK. Um

994
00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:02.550
uh That doesn't mean there may not be some

995
00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.959
people like that and it certainly doesn't deny that

996
00:56:04.969 --> 00:56:07.310
people who are ground down by, you know, a

997
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:10.780
life in the capitalist marketplace may have energy for

998
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:12.560
nothing else but lying on the sofa at the

999
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:16.889
end of the day. Um But Marx doesn't think

1000
00:56:16.899 --> 00:56:19.179
that's what people are essentially like he says, he

1001
00:56:19.189 --> 00:56:22.969
thinks people essentially want to produce, right? And in

1002
00:56:22.979 --> 00:56:25.449
particular, he thinks and, and this is really the

1003
00:56:25.459 --> 00:56:27.590
most striking claim, I think that you find in

1004
00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:30.159
Marx and that survives into the late Marx as

1005
00:56:30.169 --> 00:56:32.949
well is that human beings not only want to

1006
00:56:32.959 --> 00:56:36.060
produce, but they like to produce things for aesthetic

1007
00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:40.229
reasons because they are aesthetically satisfying because they're beautiful

1008
00:56:40.239 --> 00:56:44.360
because they're pleasing. Um And you know, uh two

1009
00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:46.699
interesting facts that I think, you know, speak to

1010
00:56:46.709 --> 00:56:49.239
this. One is that we know that throughout the

1011
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:53.800
history of humankind, human beings have engaged in productive

1012
00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:56.870
activity have made things simply because they were beautiful,

1013
00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:01.739
even under the most difficult material circumstances, right? People

1014
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:05.639
did this human beings, right? Cave drawings, right? I

1015
00:57:05.649 --> 00:57:09.330
mean, where you find human beings, they make certain

1016
00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:12.649
things for aesthetic reasons, right? Their aesthetic taste may

1017
00:57:12.659 --> 00:57:14.590
be very different but they make them because they're

1018
00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:18.479
pleasing, they're beautiful, they're satisfying in a different way.

1019
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:20.590
Uh The other fact that I think is very

1020
00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.909
telling about this is the way we educate Children.

1021
00:57:23.149 --> 00:57:25.969
So when Children first go to school, you know,

1022
00:57:25.979 --> 00:57:28.139
at the age of four or five or six,

1023
00:57:28.159 --> 00:57:29.989
there's always a lot of time given to them

1024
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.149
for artwork, right? And here's the thing about art

1025
00:57:33.159 --> 00:57:35.070
work time, you don't have to force Children to

1026
00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:37.000
do it. Nobody has to say if you don't

1027
00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:39.899
do it, you won't get your snack, they like

1028
00:57:39.909 --> 00:57:44.510
it, they just Children instinctively, they like coloring, making

1029
00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.919
things with clay. It's very appealing to them, right?

1030
00:57:47.949 --> 00:57:51.530
Um This too suggests that he's on to something

1031
00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:54.090
very important about human beings, that human beings really

1032
00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:58.239
have a very profound need to produce things for

1033
00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:03.219
uh reasons of aesthetic satisfaction. OK. Um You know,

1034
00:58:03.229 --> 00:58:06.100
now in the early Mars, he makes other claims

1035
00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:09.060
about what uh the essential needs of, of human

1036
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:12.590
beings are. Um YOU know, so he, he's got,

1037
00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.209
it's a more complicated picture. But I think the

1038
00:58:15.219 --> 00:58:17.929
the two crucial ideas that I think he always

1039
00:58:17.939 --> 00:58:20.850
holds through is that human beings are by nature

1040
00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:24.939
productive and that they like to produce things for

1041
00:58:24.949 --> 00:58:27.330
aesthetic reasons, right? And Marx thinks this is the

1042
00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:30.379
big difference between human beings and other animals, right?

1043
00:58:30.399 --> 00:58:33.340
Is that other animals produce strictly for need. Whereas

1044
00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:36.129
human beings, if given the chance will produce for

1045
00:58:36.139 --> 00:58:39.850
aesthetic reasons. So it's a very, it's a pretty

1046
00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:41.969
rich, it's a, it's a robust picture of what

1047
00:58:41.979 --> 00:58:46.090
human beings are essentially. Like that being said, I

1048
00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:49.979
will say that I do think Marx um is

1049
00:58:49.989 --> 00:58:53.590
probably a bit naive about um other aspects of

1050
00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:57.370
human beings. Um You know, this was, this is

1051
00:58:57.379 --> 00:58:59.850
sort of the big dividing line between Marxists and

1052
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:04.120
Freudians, right? I mean, Freud thought that human beings,

1053
00:59:04.129 --> 00:59:07.879
you know, were instinctively aggressive and he didn't think

1054
00:59:07.889 --> 00:59:10.080
it was just an artifact of the way society

1055
00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:14.120
was organized and, you know, my own inclination is

1056
00:59:14.129 --> 00:59:16.889
to think that unfortunately, Freud is probably more right

1057
00:59:16.899 --> 00:59:19.560
than Marx when it comes to this. Um But

1058
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:21.330
it's wrong to say Marx doesn't have a view

1059
00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:22.919
of human nature. He clearly does

1060
00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:28.899
so religious uh related to that. And again, this

1061
00:59:28.909 --> 00:59:32.179
occurs in the context of capitalism according to Marx,

1062
00:59:32.189 --> 00:59:35.800
a very Marxian term as well as alienation. So

1063
00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:39.899
what is alienation and how the alienation occur?

1064
00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:43.760
Ok. So the right. So the early Marx is

1065
00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:47.110
very interested in the concept of alienation and fremd,

1066
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:50.679
which is a estrangement. Sometimes in English, it's translated

1067
00:59:50.689 --> 00:59:54.060
as uh a strange um to be alienated is

1068
00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:57.500
to be alienated from your essential nature. That's what

1069
00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:00.830
alienation is, right? So if you cannot express or

1070
01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.969
realize your essential nature, right? Um THEN you are

1071
01:00:04.979 --> 01:00:08.340
in a state of alienation under capitalism, most people

1072
01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:11.469
engage in productive activity not to express their essential

1073
01:00:11.479 --> 01:00:15.610
nature, but to uh survive. In that sense, people

1074
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:20.050
are always alienated under capitalism because their productive activity

1075
01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.939
doesn't really belong to them. I mean, literally, it's

1076
01:00:22.949 --> 01:00:25.449
owned by the capitalist who's ever paying, you know,

1077
01:00:25.459 --> 01:00:28.639
their, their wage, what they produce is owned by

1078
01:00:28.649 --> 01:00:31.669
the capitalist. It's not even theirs, right? And their

1079
01:00:31.679 --> 01:00:35.000
productive activity itself is not productive activity they would

1080
01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:36.919
engage in if they didn't need the wage to

1081
01:00:36.929 --> 01:00:40.330
survive, right? So, in that sense, people are profoundly

1082
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:43.919
alienated under, under capitalism and notice that in that

1083
01:00:43.929 --> 01:00:46.750
way of characterizing alienation and, and there's more we

1084
01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.879
could say about it, which we do discuss in

1085
01:00:48.889 --> 01:00:51.290
chapter six of the book. But in that way

1086
01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.959
of characterizing alienation, alienation is not primarily a matter

1087
01:00:54.969 --> 01:00:57.820
of how you feel. All right, that is people

1088
01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:00.270
can be alienated from their essential nature and feel

1089
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.189
perfectly fine about it, right? Um That is until

1090
01:01:04.199 --> 01:01:07.979
they acquire class consciousness and they realize that they're

1091
01:01:07.989 --> 01:01:10.040
spending their whole life doing things they would rather

1092
01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:12.120
not do except they have to in order in

1093
01:01:12.129 --> 01:01:15.439
order to survive. Um But that's the basic idea

1094
01:01:15.449 --> 01:01:18.800
of uh of alienation. And again, it's very tightly

1095
01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:20.600
connected to his notion of human nature.

1096
01:01:20.949 --> 01:01:23.649
So go going back a little bit, I would

1097
01:01:23.659 --> 01:01:27.290
like to ask you now about uh Marx's ideas

1098
01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:31.219
about ideology. So uh going back for a second

1099
01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:35.669
to historical materialism, how do material conditions lead to

1100
01:01:35.679 --> 01:01:41.850
differences in ideas, culture values, basically what Ma Marx

1101
01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:43.250
called the super structure?

1102
01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:47.389
Mhm You wanna take that, Jim? Yeah, sure.

1103
01:01:47.399 --> 01:01:51.649
Um Good. Um Right. So it's a bit of

1104
01:01:51.659 --> 01:01:53.959
a thorny issue obviously, but I, but what we

1105
01:01:53.969 --> 01:01:55.770
have going on, I mean, just to, to tie

1106
01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:59.510
it very closely to the historical materialism account, right?

1107
01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:05.629
Mars has the idea that um in those cases,

1108
01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:07.360
then there could be

1109
01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.739
um Right. So in those cases, you're, you're going

1110
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:17.879
to have in the case, think of the monarchy

1111
01:02:17.889 --> 01:02:20.729
or something, right? You have this feudal regime um

1112
01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:24.199
they, they own the land, they've, they have, they

1113
01:02:24.209 --> 01:02:27.629
have the land and they're going to

1114
01:02:28.409 --> 01:02:30.850
let me say something quick while Jamie solves the

1115
01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.870
feedback problem and then I give it back to

1116
01:02:32.879 --> 01:02:35.580
Jamie. I mean, the the basic idea is that

1117
01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:39.820
the dominant moral, political, philosophical, religious, economic ideas in

1118
01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:43.080
any society are the ones that serve the interests

1119
01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:46.260
of the dominant class in that society. Right? That's

1120
01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:48.489
the basic idea and that's where I'm sure JB

1121
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.260
was going with that example. So now JB, hopefully

1122
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:54.840
you're done. Echoing. Yeah. OK. Your example. All right,

1123
01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:57.860
we'll see. Um Right. So, so just like Brand

1124
01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:00.729
said, right? So you're, you're gonna have um so

1125
01:03:00.739 --> 01:03:03.419
in, in the times of feudalism, you're going to

1126
01:03:03.429 --> 01:03:05.939
now have a set of ideas that are going

1127
01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:07.909
to be the, the ideas that get traction and

1128
01:03:07.919 --> 01:03:12.840
culture. And Marx predicts with what you're going to

1129
01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:17.439
get are going to be ideas that reinforce um

1130
01:03:17.449 --> 01:03:20.179
this, this status quo and that this is what

1131
01:03:20.189 --> 01:03:21.840
you get. So, right, if you look at in

1132
01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:24.840
the times of feudalism, you're going to have in

1133
01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:26.649
the ch you're gonna go to the church and

1134
01:03:26.659 --> 01:03:29.179
the church is going to tell you um be

1135
01:03:29.189 --> 01:03:32.679
good and um your reward will be in heaven.

1136
01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.459
And what you need to do right now is

1137
01:03:34.469 --> 01:03:37.600
to recognize that the, the king or the queen

1138
01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:40.590
is God's representative on earth, et cetera, et cetera.

1139
01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:43.459
Um You're going to have the music of the

1140
01:03:43.469 --> 01:03:46.159
time, the painting of the time are going to

1141
01:03:46.169 --> 01:03:49.560
be in some sense, not on purpose, propaganda, but

1142
01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:51.780
so steeped in this culture that they're going to

1143
01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:54.110
be reproducing it in some ways, right? So there'll

1144
01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.120
be odes to the greatness of the king and

1145
01:03:56.129 --> 01:03:59.469
the queen and, and et cetera, et cetera. Um

1146
01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:04.939
And then when we switch to capitalism, those that

1147
01:04:04.949 --> 01:04:08.590
will disappear and you're going to instead have ideas

1148
01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.949
about the valor of rather than knowing your place

1149
01:04:11.959 --> 01:04:14.610
in the universe, there will be ideas about um

1150
01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:17.479
being free where Marx is gonna think this means

1151
01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.409
you're free to leave the land to go work

1152
01:04:19.419 --> 01:04:22.429
for the factory owners. But these kind of this

1153
01:04:22.439 --> 01:04:26.270
valor of the new ideal as opposed to the

1154
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.639
old ideal. But so, so that's, that's in the

1155
01:04:29.649 --> 01:04:32.889
sense that ideology is tied to the material conditions,

1156
01:04:32.899 --> 01:04:35.790
right? It's the material conditions are sort of generating

1157
01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:39.030
um a a situation that are then that's then

1158
01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.699
expressed in the culture of the times. Um uh

1159
01:04:42.709 --> 01:04:45.219
That's how it's tied to the material conditions. But,

1160
01:04:45.889 --> 01:04:49.219
but the idea itself, right is, is more complicated

1161
01:04:49.229 --> 01:04:51.810
than that a bit in Marx. So, right, so

1162
01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:55.280
in Marx, we get um he again, he doesn't

1163
01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:57.939
quite come out and identi uh uh define the

1164
01:04:57.949 --> 01:05:01.340
term uh but he uses it frequently. So uh

1165
01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:04.520
the the chore is to sort of see what

1166
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:08.219
the common, what, what's common throughout his various uses

1167
01:05:08.229 --> 01:05:12.560
of the term. Uh What we suggest is that

1168
01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:16.379
throughout the various uses, um there's a core component

1169
01:05:16.389 --> 01:05:20.760
for ideology, there's an epistemic comp component, namely uh

1170
01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:25.889
ideologies or uh complexes of beliefs. But importantly, some

1171
01:05:25.899 --> 01:05:27.760
of the beliefs are going to be false for

1172
01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:30.389
mark. So not all of not all, not every

1173
01:05:30.399 --> 01:05:33.169
component will be false, but importantly, you'll be able

1174
01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:35.659
to look at an ideological belief and there will

1175
01:05:35.669 --> 01:05:37.469
be a, there will be a, a room for

1176
01:05:37.479 --> 01:05:40.679
epistemic critique. You can say this is false, this

1177
01:05:40.689 --> 01:05:44.110
is not true about uh you know the nature

1178
01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:47.590
of humans or the nature of this particular economic

1179
01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:51.110
situation or et cetera, et cetera. OK. Um That's

1180
01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.280
one component. Um Marx is very interested though, not

1181
01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:59.370
just in saying that the views of his opponents

1182
01:05:59.379 --> 01:06:01.770
are false, but he thinks it's an important thing

1183
01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:04.399
to understand how they came to be false. And

1184
01:06:04.409 --> 01:06:07.270
this will be very important for Marx because he,

1185
01:06:07.439 --> 01:06:12.840
he accuses wide swaths of the community to be

1186
01:06:12.889 --> 01:06:16.120
um in the grips of ideological belief, right? So,

1187
01:06:16.209 --> 01:06:21.149
so for instance, the Economic Department, the theology department,

1188
01:06:21.159 --> 01:06:23.969
the et cetera. So the question is going to

1189
01:06:23.979 --> 01:06:26.330
be for Marx, he, he wants to say a

1190
01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.780
lot of these beliefs are, are false. Core aspects

1191
01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:32.169
of these beliefs are false and not just accidentally.

1192
01:06:32.179 --> 01:06:36.310
So, but systematically. So even people working sort of

1193
01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.750
uh in enclave separate from one another, he thinks

1194
01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:43.360
theorizing in a particular time are going to come

1195
01:06:43.479 --> 01:06:45.989
to, to make the same sorts of mistakes. So

1196
01:06:46.489 --> 01:06:49.580
it's epistemic false. Um There's going to be some

1197
01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:53.389
account of the genesis of these beliefs, how it

1198
01:06:53.399 --> 01:06:55.959
could be, that they came to be false and

1199
01:06:55.969 --> 01:06:58.169
there's going to be a functional component in all

1200
01:06:58.179 --> 01:07:00.870
of the cases. It's going to be the case

1201
01:07:00.929 --> 01:07:04.149
that these beliefs are false. We can explain their

1202
01:07:04.159 --> 01:07:07.270
genesis, but they also serve to promote or at

1203
01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.510
least sustain the interests of the ruling class who

1204
01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:15.780
have um who have monopolized political power. Um So

1205
01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:19.540
that's the rough schema in the early days, we

1206
01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:22.070
get this very early with Marx when he is

1207
01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.550
first becoming critical of the young he gleans. Um,

1208
01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:30.860
AGAIN, his remarks are scathing. Um, IT'S important to

1209
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:33.169
remember they were a big influence and they included

1210
01:07:33.179 --> 01:07:36.500
his teachers, et cetera. Um, BUT he thinks he

1211
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:39.879
thinks that the mistake that they're making is that

1212
01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:43.070
they're imagining again, echoing things we've talked about already.

1213
01:07:43.179 --> 01:07:46.280
They're imagining that ideas. This is what they, they

1214
01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:48.820
take over from Hegel that Marx wants to reject.

1215
01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.320
They think that ideas are, are really where the

1216
01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:55.350
action is. If you wanna understand transformation over history,

1217
01:07:55.379 --> 01:07:58.439
you understand ideas. If you yourself want to transform

1218
01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:01.090
history, you want to make sure people get their

1219
01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:03.840
conceptions, right? They think about themselves the right way,

1220
01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:09.669
et cetera, et cetera. Um Marx rejects this for

1221
01:08:09.679 --> 01:08:12.350
in favor of the historical materialism that we've outlined

1222
01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.820
that he's putting forward and he calls this in

1223
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:18.209
the early days their ideology. It's, it's a pejorative

1224
01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:22.120
sense in their, their belief that ideas are really

1225
01:08:22.129 --> 01:08:26.629
the um the mechanism of history and which he

1226
01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:30.180
thinks is false. Um And he has an account

1227
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.669
of how they came to have this belief. But

1228
01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.189
he thinks this functions, even though, right, we, as

1229
01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:38.890
we said earlier, people like Bauer were um uh

1230
01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:43.879
exiled from the academic community. They, the young heals

1231
01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:48.330
are imagining themselves to be uh revolutionary. But Marx

1232
01:08:48.339 --> 01:08:51.729
thinks despite what they think, despite their self understanding,

1233
01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:55.939
they're mistaken because the ideas they're proposing are are

1234
01:08:55.950 --> 01:09:00.149
so far afi from actually understanding how historical materialism

1235
01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:03.799
works and a true understanding of class consciousness that

1236
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:07.310
even though they think they're being revolutionary, they're in

1237
01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:11.419
fact just bolstering the status quo. Um So this

1238
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:13.660
is in the early days and, and this is

1239
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:16.069
gonna be a very particular, we, we detail this

1240
01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.339
in the book. It's a very particular kind of

1241
01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:20.819
critique of sort of the idealism of The Young

1242
01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:25.790
Galions. Um But Marx employs this uh more liberally

1243
01:09:25.799 --> 01:09:29.600
in his later years, he's less interested in, I

1244
01:09:29.609 --> 01:09:31.520
mean, he continues to do this, but he doesn't

1245
01:09:31.529 --> 01:09:37.580
exclusively critique people's philosophical views, um their ideological views,

1246
01:09:37.589 --> 01:09:39.379
but he uses it in the, in the sense

1247
01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:42.589
that we've kind of come to now um use

1248
01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.009
the term ideology as sort of a still a

1249
01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:48.859
pejorative um uh view, but a, a pejorative belief

1250
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:53.259
um view about a whole host of beliefs people

1251
01:09:53.270 --> 01:09:57.379
have but still in the spirit of status quo,

1252
01:09:57.390 --> 01:10:01.709
justifying beliefs, the beliefs about economic system, the beliefs

1253
01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.250
about religious system, the beliefs about a certain moralizing

1254
01:10:05.259 --> 01:10:08.899
systems, et cetera. Um THAT they're, they're still in

1255
01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:14.140
the service of um bolstering the, the um prevailing

1256
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:15.529
economic interests.

1257
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:19.600
So now for the last part of our conversation,

1258
01:10:19.609 --> 01:10:21.169
I would like to ask you a little bit

1259
01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:24.740
about Marx's legacy and the influence in some of

1260
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:29.319
the developments in Marxism that we saw throughout the

1261
01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:34.959
20th century particularly. So, h how do writers like

1262
01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:38.129
Ramsy and the, the ones who were part of

1263
01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:41.450
the Frankfurt School relate to Marxism.

1264
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:44.169
Yeah. Good. I mean, I, you know, last to

1265
01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:47.939
say here and Brian obviously jump in and I

1266
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:49.399
think there's, I think it's good to think of.

1267
01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:52.500
There's two movements, there's a movement, say before um

1268
01:10:52.509 --> 01:10:55.959
Western Marxism itself, that's important, which is, you know,

1269
01:10:55.970 --> 01:11:00.500
after Marx's death, um angles takes up the mantle

1270
01:11:00.509 --> 01:11:03.919
and people following angles for a while you um

1271
01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:09.020
uh it's really important to them that Marxism becomes

1272
01:11:09.089 --> 01:11:12.390
um s what they think of as scientific. Um

1273
01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:16.430
And so you get this um almost this very

1274
01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:19.910
orthodox reading of Marx where everything is a completely

1275
01:11:19.919 --> 01:11:23.279
reduced to science and um it's predictive all the

1276
01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:25.779
way down, et cetera, et cetera. Um So this

1277
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:27.850
is sort of a movement that goes more in

1278
01:11:27.859 --> 01:11:30.680
the science trying to make Marxism more of like

1279
01:11:30.689 --> 01:11:35.310
a objective science uh on the model of science.

1280
01:11:36.299 --> 01:11:36.629
Um

1281
01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.649
Can I just interject something about that? Yeah, the

1282
01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:41.729
last thing you said is, is important on that.

1283
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:45.029
Um Marx himself understood his theory to be a

1284
01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:48.379
scientific theory, they'll understand, right? A Wissen like theory

1285
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:51.709
in German is not necessarily a natural scientific theory.

1286
01:11:52.029 --> 01:11:54.649
Uh THAT doesn't have to be uh physical science,

1287
01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:58.359
all right. Um uh But he certainly thought he

1288
01:11:58.370 --> 01:12:00.959
was, you know, had unlocked the secret of historical

1289
01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:03.970
change and he, you know, was explaining how capitalism

1290
01:12:03.979 --> 01:12:06.319
works. I mean, so he thought his theory was

1291
01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:09.120
a scientific theory in that German sense of a,

1292
01:12:09.129 --> 01:12:13.140
of a scientific um theory. So what, what I

1293
01:12:13.149 --> 01:12:15.879
think is distinctive and and was probably a bit

1294
01:12:17.004 --> 01:12:20.274
was the effort by angles but then those especially

1295
01:12:20.285 --> 01:12:24.035
influenced by angles um to make it into the

1296
01:12:24.044 --> 01:12:29.174
science of dialectical materialism, right? Um That explains everything,

1297
01:12:29.185 --> 01:12:32.095
including the physical sciences with Marx. And Marx himself

1298
01:12:32.104 --> 01:12:34.834
always exempted the physical sciences from his attacks on

1299
01:12:34.845 --> 01:12:38.020
ideology and, and so on, right? But it, but

1300
01:12:38.029 --> 01:12:39.910
it is important to realize that Marx thought his

1301
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:42.100
theory was a scientific theory. So that wasn't wrong.

1302
01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:45.779
That was actually correct. It was the particular direction

1303
01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:47.899
in which they, in which they took it. So

1304
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:49.839
that's just what I wanted to interject. Yeah,

1305
01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:51.819
that's right. And that think about that's important, right?

1306
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:58.660
So, um so with that, um what you have

1307
01:12:58.669 --> 01:13:02.660
just historically, right is uh actually by world war

1308
01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:06.939
one, there was a, a large socialist um political

1309
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:11.709
movement in Europe. Um THAT'S completely fractured during the

1310
01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.899
first World War. Um PEOPLE working classes of the

1311
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:18.140
world did not unite, they retrenched back into their

1312
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:25.069
um nationalist enclaves. Um And the revolutionary spirit seemed

1313
01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.669
to have failed after World War one, you, you

1314
01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.770
get what you have in the, the Soviet Union

1315
01:13:29.779 --> 01:13:33.390
with Lenin. But as Brian's already alluded to um

1316
01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:35.970
most people in the West thought, no, this is,

1317
01:13:35.979 --> 01:13:39.910
this is uh not what Marx was predicting, et

1318
01:13:39.919 --> 01:13:44.209
cetera, et cetera. And then you increasingly see now

1319
01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:48.850
into the thirties and the forties. Um THE not

1320
01:13:48.859 --> 01:13:52.270
only the failed, sort of the working class, failing

1321
01:13:52.279 --> 01:13:54.970
to rise up, but the working class seeming to

1322
01:13:54.979 --> 01:13:57.330
buy in, in various ways to the, to the

1323
01:13:57.339 --> 01:14:00.529
system. And so there's a, there's a movement of

1324
01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:03.189
sort of a birth of what's called Western Marxism.

1325
01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:07.009
It's um a, a loose um collection of thinkers,

1326
01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.129
not all of them who saw themselves this way.

1327
01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:14.500
But um but trying to theorize Marxism, given what

1328
01:14:14.509 --> 01:14:18.629
they took to be the, its failure to predict

1329
01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:24.129
um the working class revolution. So they then turned

1330
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:26.779
in various ways. But you mentioned Gramsci before Gramsci

1331
01:14:27.149 --> 01:14:31.620
of Lukash, the Frankfurt School in various ways, uh

1332
01:14:31.629 --> 01:14:36.870
their interests turned to ideology but is ideology, not

1333
01:14:36.879 --> 01:14:40.589
just a sort of this um limited causal thing

1334
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.479
that can maintain the status quo um for a

1335
01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:48.509
while, but be seen through uh instead it becomes

1336
01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:52.370
in the project becomes increasingly one of understanding, why

1337
01:14:52.379 --> 01:14:55.439
did the revolution fail? It seems like it's only

1338
01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:59.290
into something about the thinking, the indoctrination of the

1339
01:14:59.299 --> 01:15:03.490
working class. Um MAYBE even the thinking, the indoctrination

1340
01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:07.649
of, you know, capitalism more generally. And so you,

1341
01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:10.930
you get this move to thinking um moving away

1342
01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:16.080
from Marx's economics, moving away from historical materialism in,

1343
01:15:16.089 --> 01:15:20.240
in ways um thinking that is a failed project.

1344
01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:23.509
And now thinking all the action is really in

1345
01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.910
the ideological realm and that's what we need to

1346
01:15:25.919 --> 01:15:29.910
understand. Um And so here, you also get, you

1347
01:15:29.919 --> 01:15:31.560
know, and the thinking goes in various ways, but

1348
01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:36.120
you get a return to heal is because again,

1349
01:15:36.129 --> 01:15:39.419
the focus on is on ideas in a way

1350
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:41.209
that it seems like that's where all the action

1351
01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:43.930
is. And so in various ways, these thinkers, I

1352
01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:47.109
think Brian and I agree that they, this is

1353
01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.540
one of their failings as they uh too quickly

1354
01:15:50.549 --> 01:15:53.279
think the revolution Marx predicted is going to fail

1355
01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:56.350
and too quickly abandon the economic aspects of the

1356
01:15:56.359 --> 01:16:00.069
theory. Um Focusing on this, the sort of the

1357
01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.029
men here.

1358
01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:04.859
Yeah, let me uh just add a few complimentary

1359
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:07.439
remarks to what Jamie said. I'm gonna put it

1360
01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:08.810
a little more strongly. I mean, I do think

1361
01:16:08.819 --> 01:16:12.830
Western Marxism is predicated on a mistake um from

1362
01:16:12.839 --> 01:16:15.720
a Marxist point of view, um which isn't to

1363
01:16:15.729 --> 01:16:19.560
say there aren't interesting ideas and people like Kheer

1364
01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.100
and Adorno and Marcus and Ramsey and um and

1365
01:16:23.109 --> 01:16:24.669
some of the, I'm not sure they're interesting ideas

1366
01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.629
in Lukash, but that's a different matter. Um But

1367
01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.029
um the mistake was that they thought they needed

1368
01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.850
to explain why revolutions had not occurred. Mhm And

1369
01:16:36.299 --> 01:16:39.589
yet it was absolutely clear that the material conditions

1370
01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:43.500
for revolutions to be possible. Marx's actual prediction didn't

1371
01:16:43.509 --> 01:16:46.640
actually obtain. He thought capitalism had to be global.

1372
01:16:46.649 --> 01:16:49.709
He thought that the uh those who sell their

1373
01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:53.000
labor power to survive had to be, you know,

1374
01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:56.770
being gradually miser. OK? And none of this was

1375
01:16:56.779 --> 01:17:00.089
happening in 19th century Europe, right? One thing Marx

1376
01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.839
did not fully anticipate. Uh Well, I mean, we

1377
01:17:02.850 --> 01:17:05.049
discussed this in chapter three. He, he started to

1378
01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:08.060
become aware of it um as his career went

1379
01:17:08.069 --> 01:17:10.580
on, but he didn't fully anticipate the extent to

1380
01:17:10.589 --> 01:17:15.330
which the capitalist state would negotiate peace between the

1381
01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:18.750
classes, right? By, for example, making concessions to labor

1382
01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:23.100
movements. Right, Marx, I didn't fully foresee that. Um

1383
01:17:23.109 --> 01:17:26.250
BUT we didn't have global capitalism in 1925 or

1384
01:17:26.259 --> 01:17:30.979
1935. Capitalism is much more global. Now, some of

1385
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:34.040
the trends that Marx thought um would result from

1386
01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:37.279
global capitalism, we're actually seeing in the wealthy capitalist

1387
01:17:37.290 --> 01:17:39.819
countries, right? This is part of the Trump phenomenon

1388
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:42.379
is that, you know, there's a huge section of

1389
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:45.479
the working class whose lives have gotten worse over

1390
01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:48.990
the last 30 or 40 years. Historically, when the

1391
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.410
technology, new technologies would have um you know, would

1392
01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:57.370
displace labor, human labor from one sector, but move

1393
01:17:57.379 --> 01:18:02.040
it into another sector, right? You know, um when

1394
01:18:02.049 --> 01:18:05.649
uh when the automobile, you know, put um put

1395
01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:07.890
the guys who make horseshoes out of business, they

1396
01:18:07.899 --> 01:18:10.689
went and worked in the auto factory, right? But

1397
01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:14.910
what economists even neoclassical economists have been documenting is

1398
01:18:14.919 --> 01:18:18.069
that in the beginning of the 21st century, there

1399
01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.640
are fewer of these replacement effects that is technology

1400
01:18:21.649 --> 01:18:24.450
is still displacing labor, but the labor isn't getting

1401
01:18:24.459 --> 01:18:27.490
replaced, you know, shifted over to another part of

1402
01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:31.609
the, the economy, you know, um you know, if

1403
01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.859
I were making predictions and I'm no good at

1404
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:36.209
and there's no reason people should take my predictions

1405
01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:38.759
at all seriously. But I'd say we've got another

1406
01:18:38.770 --> 01:18:41.879
100 years to go on capitalism before we get

1407
01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:44.439
to something closer to the situation. Marx is talking

1408
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:46.100
about and it may be more than that. Right.

1409
01:18:46.109 --> 01:18:48.500
And there's huge parts of the globe that haven't

1410
01:18:48.509 --> 01:18:52.299
been fully incorporated in the capitalist uh capitalist market.

1411
01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:56.189
So that was the basic mistake was to think

1412
01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.700
that there was a reason that there was something

1413
01:18:57.709 --> 01:19:01.140
to be explained that required a new explanatory tool,

1414
01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.100
namely ideology, the other development. And this is the

1415
01:19:04.109 --> 01:19:06.259
one Lukas is responsible for, which is why I

1416
01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:09.609
think his influence is so pernicious was Lukas had

1417
01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:13.259
a very hegelian reading of Marx Lukas was basically

1418
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:15.879
the return of the left young hegelian that Marx

1419
01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:20.339
ridiculed in Haiti, right? Um And that then had

1420
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:23.220
a spillover effect in lots of aspects of Western

1421
01:19:23.229 --> 01:19:26.580
Marxism, even with theorists in the Frankfurt School who

1422
01:19:26.589 --> 01:19:31.299
weren't especially, you know, devoted to Lukas still retained.

1423
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:34.899
Um YOU know, took over many of his ideas

1424
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:38.029
about the relevance of the hegelian reading of, of

1425
01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.740
Marx. Um So our book in a way is

1426
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:45.419
an attempt to restate um uh a more orthodox

1427
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:48.500
view of Marx, though not orthodox in, in the,

1428
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:52.410
in the Ham fisted angle, Soviet Union way, right?

1429
01:19:52.419 --> 01:19:55.140
No science of dialectical materialism from us. There is

1430
01:19:55.149 --> 01:20:02.100
no science of dialectical materialism. Um So I'll stop

1431
01:20:02.109 --> 01:20:02.439
there.

1432
01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:06.430
OK. Uh uh So I would really love to

1433
01:20:06.439 --> 01:20:09.850
have time to go through all the major developments

1434
01:20:09.859 --> 01:20:13.020
in Marxism across the past century. But since we

1435
01:20:13.029 --> 01:20:15.640
have limited time, let me just ask you a

1436
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:18.560
couple of more questions before we wrap up the

1437
01:20:18.569 --> 01:20:22.779
interview. So uh there are now extinctions of Marxism.

1438
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:25.160
I think we could call them that like feminist

1439
01:20:25.169 --> 01:20:29.120
Marxism. So earlier, we talked about a class. Do

1440
01:20:29.129 --> 01:20:31.629
you think that Marx would have been open to

1441
01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:37.160
ideas like intersectionality or expanding the array of social

1442
01:20:37.169 --> 01:20:40.779
identities or of ca or categories by which people

1443
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:44.240
can be oppressed beyond just class?

1444
01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.040
Yeah. Good. I mean, this is a good question.

1445
01:20:47.049 --> 01:20:50.479
Brian obviously jump in here too for Marx, what

1446
01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:54.100
is going to be important, right? The different Marxists

1447
01:20:54.109 --> 01:20:56.660
who could answer this question differently. Um But I

1448
01:20:56.669 --> 01:21:00.970
I think what's going to be uncontroversial for Marx

1449
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:05.790
is class matters at the end of the day.

1450
01:21:05.939 --> 01:21:11.189
Um So you, so you might have cases, right?

1451
01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:14.629
Where there are various moves that can be made

1452
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:17.169
within the prevailing system, there might be groups that

1453
01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:20.189
are more dominated than others, you know, within the

1454
01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.859
present system that seems clear. Um And there could

1455
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:27.259
be some progress made, say within, you know, um

1456
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:31.390
a a group that stigmatized, destigmatize them or, or

1457
01:21:31.399 --> 01:21:33.490
things like this right then and that all seems

1458
01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:36.689
to the good. Um But it's gonna be limited

1459
01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.609
this is what's gonna be crucial for Marx. All

1460
01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:40.939
of these moves are gonna be moves. You have

1461
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:46.160
a society that is fundamentally hierarchical and where the,

1462
01:21:46.169 --> 01:21:52.580
the economic ruling class is taking advantage, exploiting the,

1463
01:21:52.839 --> 01:21:57.319
the rest. Right? And so the, the rest again

1464
01:21:57.330 --> 01:21:59.839
there, there, you know, you can fight over the

1465
01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:02.160
crumbs in various ways. But I think that's how

1466
01:22:02.169 --> 01:22:03.770
Marx is gonna see it. It's gonna be crumb

1467
01:22:03.779 --> 01:22:06.609
fighting and you, you know, and it's not to

1468
01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:08.979
dismiss all of that. But it's just to say

1469
01:22:09.089 --> 01:22:12.450
that for Marx, any of these changes are going

1470
01:22:12.459 --> 01:22:15.450
to be just changes within, say, you know, it's

1471
01:22:15.459 --> 01:22:19.169
unjust, say within a prevailing system, you might think

1472
01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:23.470
it's unjust that um certain demographics are on the

1473
01:22:23.479 --> 01:22:25.529
bottom and certain demographics are on the top and

1474
01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.689
that, that may seem, right? But for Marx, what's

1475
01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:31.359
going to be more fundamental is, is that presupposing

1476
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:34.109
that whole background, which is that it's hierarchical in

1477
01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.700
the first place so you can move around the

1478
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:39.040
positions and Marx thinks there's still going to be

1479
01:22:39.049 --> 01:22:44.490
in a fundamentally um exploitative situation. As long as

1480
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.629
you have the rulers and the rule, it doesn't

1481
01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:50.240
matter who's wearing the various hats, right? So, so,

1482
01:22:50.410 --> 01:22:53.779
um so at, at a minimum, I think Marx

1483
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:59.259
is gonna say, um it's what really matters is,

1484
01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:04.439
is undoing this fundamental hierarchical structure where there's the

1485
01:23:04.450 --> 01:23:08.899
haves and the have nots um stronger marks. Um

1486
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:12.240
I, you know, could, would, would also say things

1487
01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:16.459
like um these other fights might be a distraction.

1488
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:18.430
This is where things will get controversial. But, you

1489
01:23:18.439 --> 01:23:20.430
know, I think for Marx, he would say it's

1490
01:23:20.439 --> 01:23:25.270
not that certain um political movements say are yeah,

1491
01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:27.629
wrong or it wouldn't be good if they had

1492
01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:31.229
their ends realized or something but focusing exclusively on

1493
01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.859
certain aspects, um frustrates others. So let me give

1494
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:36.709
an example, just an example that comes to mind

1495
01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.609
if recently that I think sort of illustrates this.

1496
01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:42.310
Um THIS is owing to a friend of mine.

1497
01:23:42.319 --> 01:23:45.910
Um SHE um gave me this example but she

1498
01:23:45.919 --> 01:23:49.689
uh works in the child welfare system and long

1499
01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:52.259
story short, you know, a couple of years ago

1500
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:57.569
in Illinois, same legislative sessions where they're decreasing funding

1501
01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:01.529
for kids in um the system who don't have

1502
01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:06.290
parents, they pass a bipartisan bill that changes what

1503
01:24:06.299 --> 01:24:09.439
you call kids in the system from wards of

1504
01:24:09.450 --> 01:24:12.129
the state, which sounds like a prisoner. So it

1505
01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:15.450
sounds like a dignitary harm to youth in care.

1506
01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:19.290
And uh that was enacted into law and the

1507
01:24:19.299 --> 01:24:21.089
both the right and the left went home and

1508
01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:23.689
patted themselves on the back on this amazing thing

1509
01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:26.009
they had done for the kids changed what they

1510
01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:30.600
were called. Um Does it, is it bad that

1511
01:24:30.609 --> 01:24:32.060
you change what a kid is called? No, it's

1512
01:24:32.069 --> 01:24:33.600
not bad. You change what a kid is called?

1513
01:24:33.609 --> 01:24:36.259
Does it change? Does it transform their life in

1514
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:39.339
a meaningful way? No. And it and it's ridiculous

1515
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:41.319
to think it does and to the extent that

1516
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:43.720
you think, to the extent that one thinks so.

1517
01:24:43.799 --> 01:24:47.439
Right. It's taking, it's distracting attention away from the

1518
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:49.779
real needs that are happening. Um JUST as a

1519
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:53.979
footnote. Um I uh teach classes in prison and

1520
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:58.640
in Wisconsin, they have just switched from um calling

1521
01:24:59.279 --> 01:25:02.609
prisoners inmates to persons in our care and that's

1522
01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:06.819
now become official even as, and it remains largely

1523
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:09.189
like a dungeon um series of dungeons up there.

1524
01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:11.169
So I think it's this kind of thing that's

1525
01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:13.330
going to animate sort of Marxist thinking here. It's

1526
01:25:13.339 --> 01:25:15.279
not that it's, you know, it's not that we

1527
01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:17.250
should be fighting over the crumbs. And it's not

1528
01:25:17.259 --> 01:25:19.770
to say, you know, that's all misguided or something.

1529
01:25:19.779 --> 01:25:24.049
But I think for Marx, there's a profoundly hierarchical,

1530
01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:27.740
economically structured system and until you have some, until

1531
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:30.850
you amend that in some way, everything else is

1532
01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:33.259
just um gonna be kind of a losing battle.

1533
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.740
But

1534
01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:37.000
let me just add 11 thing to that if

1535
01:25:37.009 --> 01:25:38.629
I might, I, I mean, I agree with everything

1536
01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.120
Jamie said. And the example is certainly an apt

1537
01:25:41.129 --> 01:25:46.009
example of utterly meaningless symbolic identity politics as it

1538
01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:49.319
were. Um But, you know, the, the starker form

1539
01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:52.709
of the question that uh Ricardo, your initial question

1540
01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.560
suggested to me is, um you know, is there

1541
01:25:55.569 --> 01:25:59.250
still gonna be sexism in a communist society, right?

1542
01:25:59.259 --> 01:26:00.779
Um And this is a question, a lot of

1543
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:05.209
feminist Marxists are, are worried about. Um, AND, you

1544
01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:10.390
know, it's a hard question to answer. Mark certainly

1545
01:26:10.399 --> 01:26:16.339
seems to write as if, um, features of sexism

1546
01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:18.870
in the family that he did notice were artifacts

1547
01:26:18.879 --> 01:26:24.919
of capitalism. Um, WOULD there cease to be any

1548
01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:28.810
sexism in a classless society where people weren't locked

1549
01:26:28.819 --> 01:26:32.209
in a struggle for survival? I'm a little more

1550
01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:34.359
skeptical and I think this turns on the question

1551
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:36.839
of what we think the ultimate roots of sexism

1552
01:26:36.850 --> 01:26:39.529
are. Um I don't actually think there would be

1553
01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:41.770
any racism in a class of society because I

1554
01:26:41.779 --> 01:26:45.600
do think racial prejudice is entirely an artifact of

1555
01:26:45.609 --> 01:26:51.509
class conflict. Um Sexism, I'm less optimistic about unfortunately

1556
01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:55.049
because um you know, it may well be that

1557
01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:59.919
the, the conflict between male and female um even

1558
01:26:59.930 --> 01:27:02.390
when you take the market out of it, um

1559
01:27:02.399 --> 01:27:05.029
is still going to result in various kinds of

1560
01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:09.979
discrimination and oppression specific to sex and, and gender

1561
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:13.100
and even in the absence of economic class. But

1562
01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:15.819
that's just my speculation. Um And I do think

1563
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:18.759
it's something that feminist Marxists are correctly worried about.

1564
01:27:19.129 --> 01:27:22.689
Um So just wanted to add that. Mhm.

1565
01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:26.419
So my last question will be then what aspects

1566
01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:31.810
of Marxism are still worth considering and are worthy

1567
01:27:31.819 --> 01:27:34.100
intellectual pursuits in your review?

1568
01:27:36.399 --> 01:27:39.100
Well, do, shall I start on that one? Jem.

1569
01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:43.959
Um Well, as I mentioned earlier, right? Um Marx's

1570
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:47.000
theory of historical change has been very fruitful in

1571
01:27:47.009 --> 01:27:50.020
history as a way of understanding historical events. And

1572
01:27:50.029 --> 01:27:53.279
I'm sure historians will continue to draw on aspects

1573
01:27:53.290 --> 01:27:56.350
of class conflict and class analysis as a way

1574
01:27:56.359 --> 01:28:00.709
of understanding um historical events. Um I think the

1575
01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:04.080
Marxist theory of ideology is quite important. Um I

1576
01:28:04.089 --> 01:28:09.060
think the role of ideology in contemporary societies is

1577
01:28:09.069 --> 01:28:11.750
really quite extraordinary in terms of what just doesn't

1578
01:28:11.759 --> 01:28:15.240
get discussed, right? What is just assumed to be

1579
01:28:15.410 --> 01:28:19.870
off the, off the table? Um And the only

1580
01:28:19.879 --> 01:28:22.430
explanation I think there is for that is that

1581
01:28:22.439 --> 01:28:26.370
there are shared ideologies that inevitably turn out to

1582
01:28:26.379 --> 01:28:29.790
be advantageous to the dominant economic classes in that

1583
01:28:29.799 --> 01:28:31.890
society. So I think there's still a lot of

1584
01:28:31.899 --> 01:28:35.310
uh room for for work on that. Um I

1585
01:28:35.319 --> 01:28:40.689
think Marx's basic diagnosis of, you know, why capitalism

1586
01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:43.669
is going to go awry is correct. I think

1587
01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:46.399
other aspects of Marxist economics we didn't talk about

1588
01:28:46.410 --> 01:28:49.020
like the labor theory of value are just mistaken.

1589
01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.850
Um I think there's a lot of time wasted

1590
01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:54.979
on trying to salvage it, right? People start treating

1591
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:57.279
capital like the Talmud, right? And they want to

1592
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:59.569
parse every little sentence. And so I'm not sure

1593
01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:03.990
that's a productive use of intellectual um time. Um

1594
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.479
I do think there's a lot of work to

1595
01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:08.000
be done and a lot of uh theorists inspired

1596
01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:10.899
by Marx are doing it in thinking about how

1597
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:13.850
the concept of class needs to be modified in

1598
01:29:13.859 --> 01:29:16.669
light of points Jamie made earlier, which is that

1599
01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:20.140
um you know, the the categories are, they're more

1600
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:23.160
mixed now than they were then, right? So a

1601
01:29:23.169 --> 01:29:26.680
lot of Marxist theorists talk about the profe professional

1602
01:29:26.689 --> 01:29:31.169
managerial class as somewhere intermediate between the proletariat, you

1603
01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:35.850
know, um and the traditional capitalist class, right? That

1604
01:29:35.859 --> 01:29:38.689
is these are the highly educated people who largely

1605
01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.609
work in the service of the capitalist class, but

1606
01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:44.140
are still as it were selling their labor power,

1607
01:29:44.189 --> 01:29:45.910
but perhaps they're selling it for a lot of

1608
01:29:45.919 --> 01:29:49.359
money. Right? So their situation is a bit different

1609
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:52.140
than the, uh you know, the people working in

1610
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:55.180
the Amazon warehouse, you know, um who are getting

1611
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:58.029
the minimum wage. So I think there's important work

1612
01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.020
that's being done there and that, that needs to

1613
01:30:00.029 --> 01:30:01.970
be done. Those, those are a few. I would

1614
01:30:01.979 --> 01:30:03.459
single out. I don't know if Jamie wants to

1615
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.979
add to that.

1616
01:30:04.729 --> 01:30:06.819
No, II, I would agree with that list. I

1617
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:08.689
think, I think those are the, you know, as

1618
01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:12.930
far as the substantial ideas of Marx. Those strike

1619
01:30:12.939 --> 01:30:15.520
me as important. I mean, it does seem like

1620
01:30:15.529 --> 01:30:19.259
we're, we remain in crisis, right? And so, um

1621
01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:23.689
I, I think that Marx offers insights along, you

1622
01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:26.979
know, along the content, Brian offered. Marx is also

1623
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:29.439
just fun to read. Um So I would encourage

1624
01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:31.180
if people haven't read, I mean, I, I don't

1625
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:32.950
think you should start with capital. It's um a

1626
01:30:32.959 --> 01:30:37.640
bit tricky but um, but Marx is, is good

1627
01:30:37.649 --> 01:30:40.450
to read to think through because he what you,

1628
01:30:40.459 --> 01:30:42.330
when you really right. If you just read his

1629
01:30:42.339 --> 01:30:44.399
followers, he seems like a religious figure. But when

1630
01:30:44.410 --> 01:30:47.700
you read Marx himself, you, you, it's an exciting

1631
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:52.040
live mind who is responding in real time to

1632
01:30:52.049 --> 01:30:55.220
events unfolding around him critically but trying to bring

1633
01:30:55.229 --> 01:30:57.299
all the resources he can to bear on these

1634
01:30:57.310 --> 01:31:00.399
issues thinking through them in real time. So even

1635
01:31:00.410 --> 01:31:03.020
if you disagree with certain, you know, of his

1636
01:31:03.029 --> 01:31:05.919
conclusions, he's an exciting person to read and think

1637
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:07.319
along with a bit contagious

1638
01:31:07.330 --> 01:31:07.430
in

1639
01:31:07.459 --> 01:31:07.879
that way.

1640
01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:13.109
He's funny. He's not boring. Like most academic Marxist

1641
01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:17.240
are, he's very funny. He's rude. Uh, HE, he

1642
01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:19.870
hates certain people and he has great fun with

1643
01:31:19.879 --> 01:31:23.140
them. Um, AND, you know, so he really is

1644
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:25.459
enjoyable to read. I think that's right. I wouldn't

1645
01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:27.200
start, I mean, there are parts of capital that

1646
01:31:27.209 --> 01:31:28.740
are like that too, but I would agree. I

1647
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:31.459
wouldn't, I wouldn't start there. I would even start

1648
01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:35.990
with the Communist Manifesto. But, you know, um, he's,

1649
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
uh, he's, he's a lot more fun to read

1650
01:31:38.009 --> 01:31:40.020
than most Marxists I think. I think that was

1651
01:31:40.029 --> 01:31:43.220
well said by Jamie. Um, AND he should definitely

1652
01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:45.140
not be treated like a religious figure and we

1653
01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:46.979
certainly don't do that in the book because we

1654
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:48.379
think there are a lot of things like the

1655
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:51.319
labor theory of value, um, that were as it

1656
01:31:51.330 --> 01:31:56.100
were failed intellectual, uh, undertakings that, uh, but that

1657
01:31:56.109 --> 01:31:59.319
much of Marx survives without it. Mhm

1658
01:31:59.959 --> 01:32:03.160
Yes. Uh And of course, if people do not

1659
01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:06.959
want to start directly with Marxist writings, they have

1660
01:32:06.970 --> 01:32:12.029
this wonderful introductory text we've been talking about. So

1661
01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.129
I'm leaving a link to it in the description

1662
01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:17.520
