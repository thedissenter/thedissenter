00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.789
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:05.679
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:08.800
today I'm joined by Doctor Costica Bradaan. He is

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.560
a professor of humanities in the Honors College at

5
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.680
Texas Tech University and an honorary research professor of

6
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.799
philosophy at the University of Queensland in Australia. And

7
00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:22.760
today we're talking about his book In Praise of

8
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.520
Failure, Four Lessons in Humility. So Costica, welcome to

9
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.559
the show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.700
Thank you for inviting me.

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.630
So I would like to start by asking you,

12
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:37.770
what is failure

13
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.950
exactly? What is failure? I guess we all know

14
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.630
it, uh, when we see it, right? But it's

15
00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:48.549
sometimes we may have problems trying to define it.

16
00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.310
The definition I end up using um was a

17
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.849
combination of etymology and phenomenology. Obviously, when you define

18
00:00:58.849 --> 00:01:01.119
failing, you have to bring in, bring in success

19
00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:04.839
as well. So to, to define success, I went

20
00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.180
to the etymology of the word, which in English

21
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.269
as, as in other modern languages, European languages comes

22
00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:15.599
from the Latins of cheddar, which means that the

23
00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:20.300
fact that one thing, one thing comes after another.

24
00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:23.839
We are used to this pattern, right? Things happen

25
00:01:23.839 --> 00:01:28.410
in a certain order, chronological order. So that succession

26
00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:31.849
is something that we get from experience, something we

27
00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:36.000
get from observing the world around. And when that

28
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.489
succession does not take place, precisely because we, we

29
00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:42.730
have those expectations, we, we are left with a

30
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.739
feeling of frustration of the disruption of, of Of

31
00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:50.980
disappointment and that's failure. So that's where phenomenology kicks

32
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.250
in because uh my approach more or less is

33
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.180
kind of ground in in phenomenology. So I, I

34
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.220
was, I, I, in the book, I was very

35
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.779
interested in how we respond, how the self responds

36
00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:07.050
to this experience of, of disruption, discomfort, and so

37
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.639
on. Mhm.

38
00:02:10.157 --> 00:02:12.919
And in the book, you go through 4 different

39
00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.149
kinds of failure, and for each of them, you

40
00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:20.238
have one prominent figure that you associate with each

41
00:02:20.238 --> 00:02:24.358
type of failure. You talk about physical failure, political

42
00:02:24.358 --> 00:02:29.449
failure, social failure, and biological failure. So why these

43
00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.438
four different types of failure? Why do you focus

44
00:02:32.438 --> 00:02:34.078
on this one specifically?

45
00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:39.380
Well, because of the word, to some extent, because

46
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.910
of the word itself, which in English kind of

47
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.449
cover so much ground, unlike other other languages, uh,

48
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.259
where we have different words for different types of

49
00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.139
failure, in English, we have only one, and indeed,

50
00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.059
we have the same, that same word, even for

51
00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.539
the agent who fails. We call somebody a failure,

52
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.860
right? So I needed this kind of, I needed

53
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.520
some kind of division, some kind of Uh, um,

54
00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:10.740
some kind of subdivisions of failure, types of failure,

55
00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.000
otherwise it would have been unmanageable, but also I

56
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.279
needed some kind of organizing principle, the book needs

57
00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.440
to have chapters and needs to have, you know,

58
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.789
uh, some kind of progressive order of progression, right?

59
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:31.720
So I start with again, phenomenological with that kind

60
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.429
of failure that's most remote from remote from us,

61
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.100
the failure of things, the physical failure. It's remote

62
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.229
not not necessarily spatially, it's remote in terms of,

63
00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.229
of what we really are and what things are,

64
00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.830
if, if, um, if um some engine, you know,

65
00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.860
the car engine breaks down. Even if it happens

66
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.699
in my proximity, that piece of, you know, machinery

67
00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.059
is quite remote from who, what I am or

68
00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:03.259
who I am as a human being. So that's

69
00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.339
the most remote. And then the next one would

70
00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:08.789
be uh political failure, which is again, it's still

71
00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:13.470
remote in the sense that we are, we may

72
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.858
be, you know, political beings, but we don't always

73
00:04:16.858 --> 00:04:19.589
engage in politics. It's kind of it's a special

74
00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.420
field, it's a special activity, it's a special. Uh,

75
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.570
TYPE of attitude and so on. We may well,

76
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.959
you know, live whole our whole lives without, you

77
00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:32.970
know, being engaged in politics. I'm not saying it's

78
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.519
a good thing, but it may well happen. Then

79
00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:38.109
the next is a social failure, which is kind

80
00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:40.410
of even, it's even closer in the sense that

81
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.600
unavoidably, we, we, we are, we, we engage socially,

82
00:04:44.609 --> 00:04:49.149
we, we, we are socially. Yeah, society structures as

83
00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:51.760
you know, in a quite a profound way, even

84
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.549
if, let's imagine you, you kind of take, uh,

85
00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:58.589
going to some retreat away from the world, right,

86
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.989
away from society, away from everybody and still society

87
00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:05.720
is with you. Society follow, follows you even there

88
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.350
because you speak a language which is a social

89
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.109
thing, right? And to even to think in so

90
00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:14.109
you you you employ that language, which makes you

91
00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:18.890
social. And finally, uh there is a layer. Um,

92
00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:22.769
EVEN closer and, and in my, in my book

93
00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:26.049
is the closest, it's the ultimate, I call it

94
00:05:26.049 --> 00:05:28.899
the ultimate failure, biological fate in the sense that

95
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.209
it's really, it's death, right? It's, uh, it's failure,

96
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.200
the failure of the body. It's our mortality. It's,

97
00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:42.619
it's how we end. Um, BUT those were, I'm

98
00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:46.739
not saying they're arbitrary, um, but they're, they're not

99
00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:49.209
all, they're not all the types of fate one

100
00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:51.660
can think of. I have to make a selection,

101
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.799
the book need, need to have some kind of

102
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.739
to be finite, to be, to be able to

103
00:05:56.739 --> 00:05:59.980
be brought to completion, right? So I may well,

104
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.019
I may well uh uh come up with others

105
00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:06.299
just for, for that particular purpose, I, I, I

106
00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:07.339
ended up with 4.

107
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.049
So when it comes to physical failure, the figure

108
00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:14.040
you focus the most on, and I hope I'm

109
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.959
pronouncing her name correctly, Simon Weil, uh, so she

110
00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:21.529
represents at least in your view, and as far

111
00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:25.410
as I understood, I understood it, uh. WAYS of

112
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.679
clumsiness and pursuing the the intellectual life instead of

113
00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:32.239
the practical life. So, tell us a little bit

114
00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:36.359
about her and what she represents in terms of

115
00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:39.640
failure and the lessons we can draw from her

116
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.519
life.

117
00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:44.339
Before, before doing that, I, I guess I, uh,

118
00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:47.459
I, I, I suspect we, we owe our viewers

119
00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:51.959
some explanation of, of a more methodological nature. Um,

120
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.940
FOR each of those, so those types of failure

121
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.750
correspond to four different chapters in the book, which

122
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.869
I, uh, call, you know, the circles of failure.

123
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.130
But to, to make that point, to, to, you

124
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.679
know, to make, to, to talk about those type

125
00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:09.799
of, types of failure, I want, I wanted to

126
00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:12.750
bring in in every single one of those four

127
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.839
circles. I wanted to bring in some real human

128
00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:19.920
being, somebody, uh, a person, you know, who, who,

129
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.000
uh, who lived and died and, and, and, and

130
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.640
experienced that particular kind of failure or who had

131
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.500
a special relationship to that kind of failure. Uh,

132
00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:33.339
THE reason is that I wanted this to be,

133
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.540
um, well, it is a philosophy book, in an

134
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.679
important sense. But I, I then, I didn't want

135
00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:43.559
it to be confined to philos philosophical readers only.

136
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.160
I wanted to have some broader appeal and to

137
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.320
make it more accessible and more um uh more

138
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.390
relevant, more relevant for people who are interested in,

139
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.149
in the humanities and the big questions, not necessarily,

140
00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:00.359
you know, not just professional philosophers or students of

141
00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:03.660
philosophy. So in every single one of those chapters,

142
00:08:03.739 --> 00:08:06.059
I do have a story. So there is every

143
00:08:06.059 --> 00:08:08.790
single, everywhere throughout the book, I, I kind of,

144
00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:12.059
I use this, this double tier. There is one

145
00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:15.790
layer of text, which is augmentative, it's, it's, it's,

146
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:20.410
it's philosophical in the conventional sense. I make an

147
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.500
argument or prove a point or whatever. And then

148
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.239
second layer is this narrative. It's kind of, it's

149
00:08:27.239 --> 00:08:30.619
a story, it's an unfolding story of somebody, right?

150
00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:34.250
Um, AND they, they go together alternatively, so I,

151
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.239
I, I, there is a, there's a couple of

152
00:08:37.239 --> 00:08:41.619
pages on, um, uh. On physical failure, and then

153
00:08:41.619 --> 00:08:43.938
I have the story of Simone Weil, and then

154
00:08:43.938 --> 00:08:46.158
I go back to the argument, you know, about

155
00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:48.739
the physical failure and then again. So it's just

156
00:08:48.739 --> 00:08:51.958
back and forth, which kind of, it's also serves

157
00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.968
to give the reader a sense of uh rhythm,

158
00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:58.859
but also a sense of some uh a certain

159
00:08:58.859 --> 00:09:01.408
amount of time to think about, you know, to

160
00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:05.939
process, to digest whatever um um he or she

161
00:09:05.939 --> 00:09:08.190
maybe, maybe reading there. So to go back to

162
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:13.510
your finally to your question, um, Simonee was a

163
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.450
fashion, is a fascinating figure to study, to explore,

164
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.250
to think about. Um, SHE could be approached from

165
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.169
different angles. She, she means so many things, she

166
00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:27.809
did so many things. She was a social activist

167
00:09:27.809 --> 00:09:31.109
and she was a philosopher, a mystic, a theologian,

168
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.659
and so many things. From my point of view,

169
00:09:35.369 --> 00:09:38.489
from the point of view of this book. She

170
00:09:38.489 --> 00:09:42.690
was an extraordinary case of, of, of failure, even

171
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.859
if she was a very successful person, you know,

172
00:09:45.059 --> 00:09:48.530
in her life. In some respects, in some respects,

173
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.880
in others, she chose to be a failure. She

174
00:09:52.599 --> 00:09:54.580
She quit at some point, for example, she quit

175
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.940
her, her job, her teaching job to be as

176
00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.460
a, you know, you know, in the French system

177
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.380
of education, to be an unskilled labor to work

178
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.080
in a factory as, as, as, as an ordinary,

179
00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:11.219
not just, not just as an ordinary worker, but

180
00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:15.150
as somebody at the, as the lowest possibility. So

181
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.710
on the, you know, the lowest, uh, um, um,

182
00:10:17.719 --> 00:10:21.039
scale in terms of payment, in terms of, uh,

183
00:10:21.049 --> 00:10:23.859
of, of qualifications and in terms of skills and

184
00:10:23.859 --> 00:10:27.919
so on. So, she wanted to experience, she wanted

185
00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:30.150
first of all to know what was like to

186
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.750
be a worker. Everybody was talking about the working

187
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.229
class, working conditions of, of the French people and

188
00:10:36.229 --> 00:10:38.429
so on, and everybody was there, there's so much

189
00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:41.950
just like today, there's so much political politics involved

190
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.780
around her. And but she wanted for once to,

191
00:10:44.979 --> 00:10:48.570
to go and see, right, to, to actually witness

192
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:53.059
how those, what, how those workers were leading their

193
00:10:53.059 --> 00:10:57.500
lives and what their daily lives in in fact

194
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.179
in the factory were like and to produce to

195
00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:03.169
come up with an account. So she came back

196
00:11:03.169 --> 00:11:07.809
and wrote what she experienced there. What's interesting, and

197
00:11:07.809 --> 00:11:10.309
that's again, go back to your question is that

198
00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:13.909
as a person, she was a profoundly clumsy person.

199
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.390
She was, she was not suited for that kind

200
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.710
of work. She was a brilliant intellectual, a great

201
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.650
mind. Particularly gifted for, for foreign languages, for example,

202
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.099
for classics, for philosophy and so on, but not

203
00:11:29.099 --> 00:11:31.690
for that kind of labor, and yet, and yet

204
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.250
she chose precisely that kind of activity to, to,

205
00:11:35.369 --> 00:11:37.809
to, to make a point, to understand the difficulty

206
00:11:37.809 --> 00:11:40.130
of, of the, of the, of the person, you

207
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.599
know, the assembly line, uh uh spending their lives

208
00:11:44.119 --> 00:11:47.770
in very hard conditions and um she wanted, of

209
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:51.570
course, to, to transcend her limits, her limits in

210
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:57.109
the sense of Uh, I don't know, learning to

211
00:11:57.109 --> 00:12:01.869
live with her natural clumsiness, but also the limits

212
00:12:01.869 --> 00:12:04.950
she wanted to understand, to better understand the limits

213
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.739
of the human condition itself. So you do have

214
00:12:07.739 --> 00:12:10.469
that case of clumsiness, which for me is a,

215
00:12:10.549 --> 00:12:15.130
is a very interesting case of failure. OF the

216
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.210
physicality of our, of the world, right? It's, it's,

217
00:12:18.289 --> 00:12:21.729
it's something that happens when we are simply, we

218
00:12:21.729 --> 00:12:26.450
find ourselves, ourselves ill equipped to deal with the

219
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.289
problem, to grasp something, to, to manage something, and

220
00:12:30.289 --> 00:12:33.260
it's, it's, it's, no matter how much learning, you,

221
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.200
you invest in that, how much effort you make,

222
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.929
there is a point that you cannot just, you,

223
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:42.090
you cannot uh uh move on over. Uh, BECAUSE

224
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.489
it's, it's, it's, you are naturally clumsy and that,

225
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.090
that's a, that's an interesting case of, of failure

226
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:50.010
where the body and the physicality of the world

227
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.770
is, is heavily involved. So,

228
00:12:53.859 --> 00:12:57.500
but what kinds of lessons or positive lessons can

229
00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.299
we draw from that example?

230
00:13:02.659 --> 00:13:06.780
Well, uh, I, I would be reluctant to talk

231
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.080
about lessons. Well, even if it's in the title

232
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.130
of the book, of course, it's a, but the,

233
00:13:11.179 --> 00:13:14.080
the lessons that the title refer to are a

234
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.489
bit broader. It's a, there are some kind of

235
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.460
There are philosophical lessons, there are lessons of, of

236
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.570
a, of a, of a, of a different nature

237
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.260
than, you know, practical lessons that you can learn

238
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.900
from, you know, something or other. Uh, THE lessons

239
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.780
she learned. First of all, was something very specific

240
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:42.260
about how the French working class was, was um

241
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.780
treated or rather mistreated by, by society, by politicians,

242
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.979
by, by factory owners and so on. So, so

243
00:13:49.979 --> 00:13:52.700
she, she, she learned something very specifically in terms

244
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:58.080
of, of, uh, you know, sociologically, uh, psychologically. In

245
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.260
terms of, of, of uh policies, if you like,

246
00:14:01.599 --> 00:14:04.960
uh, from that experience. But of course, much more

247
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.700
importantly, Again, she's a very special because she's such

248
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.729
a special person. She learned a lot about theology.

249
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.700
She went into the factory to learn about the

250
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.739
working class, the working conditions of the French, you

251
00:14:19.739 --> 00:14:22.960
know, workers. But she came back a mystic. She

252
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.599
came back almost converted, not necessarily to Christianity, but

253
00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:29.440
to kind of a spiritual, highly spiritual way of

254
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.840
life. She went, she was looking for the French

255
00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.450
work uh uh worker and ended up discovering Jesus

256
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.239
Christ because the way in which she describes the

257
00:14:40.239 --> 00:14:43.409
condition of the work. Of the workers kind of

258
00:14:43.599 --> 00:14:48.090
is very because as you, as you read those

259
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.960
texts, the, the, the her diaries and so on,

260
00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.890
you, you, it's the language becomes more and more

261
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:58.289
uh uh religious religiously charged and eventually she, she,

262
00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.409
she kind of she sees herself, you know, there

263
00:15:01.409 --> 00:15:04.500
in the factory as a slave. But it's, it's

264
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.559
that language of slave is not, of course, she

265
00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:11.400
knew what slave slavery was. She, she had studied

266
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.109
the, the classics and, and the, you know, the,

267
00:15:14.119 --> 00:15:16.880
the, the Asian world where there's, there were so

268
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.159
many slaves around. But more importantly, she, for her

269
00:15:20.159 --> 00:15:23.760
slave had a theological meaning very much like in

270
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.159
the gospel where, where you read that, you know,

271
00:15:26.409 --> 00:15:29.130
Jesus Christ came into the world as a slave.

272
00:15:29.869 --> 00:15:32.140
So that's, that's where, that's the meeting that, that's

273
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.799
the encounter that happens there. Um SHE is Simone

274
00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:41.409
V discovers Jesus Christ under this, this unexpected guise

275
00:15:41.409 --> 00:15:44.010
of, of, of the, of the worker of the

276
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:49.929
humble oppressed, over oppressed worker. Mhm.

277
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.780
So, uh let me ask you, uh, because this

278
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.940
is something that you get into when you talk

279
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.619
about her life as well, but as you said,

280
00:15:58.659 --> 00:16:01.460
you go through some of the philosophical aspects and

281
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.260
then you also go through the life of the

282
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.340
people you explore in the book. What effects do

283
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:12.179
you think, uh things working flawlessly with us? I

284
00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:16.679
mean, what kinds of effects would perfection have on

285
00:16:16.679 --> 00:16:19.260
us? Do you think it could be something negative?

286
00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:22.869
Yeah, that's one of the points I, I, I

287
00:16:22.869 --> 00:16:25.830
make there. There is a sense in which if

288
00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:31.349
nothing breaks down, if everything works smoothly forever, we

289
00:16:31.349 --> 00:16:36.349
ended up useless. We, and there's no, there'll be

290
00:16:36.349 --> 00:16:39.099
no room for us there because it's kind of

291
00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.960
um It's the system, the work, you know, the,

292
00:16:44.039 --> 00:16:47.280
the, the things are self-sufficient. There's no, no room

293
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.280
for us, no need for us. We ended up,

294
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.200
you know, as some kind of uh appendix, you

295
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.539
know, unnecessary and, and, and, and useless and so

296
00:16:57.539 --> 00:17:00.559
on. But more important, that's one aspect, we can

297
00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:02.960
just take a break and go somewhere and read

298
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.400
a book or do something interesting. But more importantly,

299
00:17:06.439 --> 00:17:10.319
if If we place ourselves in situations where there

300
00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:14.199
is too much perfection or there is perfection, that

301
00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:16.640
affects our minds, that affects the way in which

302
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.709
we function, you know, internally because it's kind of,

303
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.839
um, we, we, we stop, we stop paying attention

304
00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.819
to things. We, what, what I, I'm trying to

305
00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:30.260
say is that we need to be To be

306
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.349
challenged. We need to, we need to be, you

307
00:17:33.349 --> 00:17:37.050
know, we need to wake up. We need events,

308
00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.859
we need occasion, uh, you know, uh, occasions to

309
00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:45.130
wake us up, to, to make us think, to

310
00:17:45.339 --> 00:17:48.060
take, to make us make a decision. We need

311
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.130
to become aware, otherwise, we, we, we fall asleep.

312
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.540
Uh, THIS, this, this, this regularity, this, we, we,

313
00:17:56.069 --> 00:17:59.150
because of how things are, we, we end up

314
00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.750
living in a pat, you know, inside and within

315
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:07.140
a, a, a heavily patterned existence. Everything is, is

316
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.380
in, comes in patterns. We, and which is good,

317
00:18:10.459 --> 00:18:12.849
which is natural, right? It's life itself has this,

318
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.780
this, this tendency to, to happen to take place

319
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.660
in patterns and we develop patterns when, when, when

320
00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.010
solving problems, when leading our life, we cannot afford

321
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.780
every day to do something to start from scratch

322
00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.500
our lives, to reinvent our lives completely. We need

323
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.900
those patterns, but when, when those patterns kind of

324
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:36.209
take over. Kind of when they occupy too much

325
00:18:36.209 --> 00:18:40.140
of our lives, there is this danger that we

326
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.489
become useless and we, we, we in turn become

327
00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:48.260
routine. We become uh kind of automated, automate, we

328
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.099
need to stay alive. We need to remain spontaneous

329
00:18:51.099 --> 00:18:54.619
and that automation which first comes in the outside

330
00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:57.650
world, we, we, we, we call it, we, we,

331
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.900
we build, you know, we, we invest in automation,

332
00:19:00.989 --> 00:19:05.530
right? But somehow there is a, there is a

333
00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.530
strange process where we, we, we ended up automated

334
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.209
in, in, in our own minds. Much of, of

335
00:19:13.209 --> 00:19:17.130
what's going on inside our heads is becomes a

336
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.619
form of automation. And that's, that's, um, that's a

337
00:19:20.619 --> 00:19:23.869
problem, I think. We, we cannot afford, we, if

338
00:19:23.869 --> 00:19:25.609
we, if we fall victim to that kind of

339
00:19:25.609 --> 00:19:29.020
automation, uh, we, we kind of, we, we, we,

340
00:19:29.089 --> 00:19:32.550
we die little by little. Uh, WHILE, while still

341
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.170
alive technically. Right.

342
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.030
So then you get into the topic of political

343
00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.150
failure and the main figure here is Mohandas Gandhi.

344
00:19:43.229 --> 00:19:46.579
But before we get into Gandhi himself, why do

345
00:19:46.579 --> 00:19:51.189
you think that we are drawn to political movements?

346
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.380
Um, IN what sense? I mean,

347
00:19:56.939 --> 00:19:57.709
I, I, I mean,

348
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:02.000
because specific to certain kinds of political movements or

349
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.589
uh, I,

350
00:20:02.709 --> 00:20:06.829
I mean if existentially speaking there are particular reasons

351
00:20:06.829 --> 00:20:10.349
why we feel drawn to being part of political

352
00:20:10.349 --> 00:20:13.790
movements if we get some meaning out of them

353
00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.130
or something like that.

354
00:20:17.939 --> 00:20:20.619
Well, I guess that's a good point. Uh, IT'S

355
00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:23.300
an interesting question. It's a, it's a modern, it's

356
00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.339
a kind of a post-renaissance thing before, uh, even

357
00:20:27.339 --> 00:20:31.099
if we are political animals and we are, we've

358
00:20:31.099 --> 00:20:35.239
always been, we've always been interested in politics. Up

359
00:20:35.239 --> 00:20:38.520
to, let's say the Renaissance, only a limited number

360
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.300
of people who are doing politics. You are, if,

361
00:20:42.439 --> 00:20:45.790
if you're a king or a pope or, uh,

362
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.880
you know, adviser to the king or to the

363
00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.280
pope, you are actively doing politics. Most of the

364
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.589
other people were not involved. They were, you know,

365
00:20:54.719 --> 00:21:00.560
silent, uh. Not participants. They were spectators. They were

366
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.359
just witness in the best of cases, as witnesses

367
00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:08.359
and the politics were, was done, you know, uh,

368
00:21:08.369 --> 00:21:11.329
without them, but with the, with democrat, well, of

369
00:21:11.329 --> 00:21:13.130
course, you do have in the ancient Greece, but

370
00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:16.369
those are exceptions. But through, you know, from the

371
00:21:16.369 --> 00:21:20.890
modern, uh from with modernity, there we have the,

372
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.239
this very different ways, uh, different ways of understanding

373
00:21:24.239 --> 00:21:27.180
politics and especially comes with the parliamentary Uh, with

374
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.880
parliamentary democracies where politics is no longer done by

375
00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.939
a very limited number of people, but by more

376
00:21:34.939 --> 00:21:38.660
and more. First, there are males, male citizens, and

377
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.660
you have women and you have other classes and

378
00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.979
so on. And today, pretty much except for uh

379
00:21:44.979 --> 00:21:50.420
children who are, or um non-citizens, today it's expected

380
00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.260
that everybody has to do to get involved in

381
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.130
politics. We don't, and that's a, that's a pity

382
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.380
because we should, there should be more of us

383
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:02.670
who, who go to, you know, who vote. Um,

384
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.599
THAT'S one thing, right? But I guess the question

385
00:22:05.599 --> 00:22:07.680
can also have a, a different layer in the

386
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.849
sense of why we are we attracted to radical

387
00:22:10.849 --> 00:22:15.560
movements I guess. Yes, it's why it's interesting, I

388
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.760
guess it's connected because it's, uh, if, if politics

389
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.160
was not accessible at all, uh, there'd be no

390
00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.449
point in getting involved in radical movements. On politics

391
00:22:26.449 --> 00:22:31.140
was democratized, you know, let's say. What's, I guess

392
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.609
after the French Revolution, right, why politics was, was,

393
00:22:34.819 --> 00:22:38.050
was spacious enough to, to, uh, you know, to,

394
00:22:38.339 --> 00:22:40.949
to embrace a number of, a large number of,

395
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.060
of actors, we do have those, those forms of

396
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.530
radical involvement. I mean that's interesting. I it's, uh,

397
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:52.130
it depends on so many things, right? It's It's,

398
00:22:52.219 --> 00:22:55.530
it can be uh the expression of a failure

399
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.469
in the sense that the failure of, of the

400
00:22:57.469 --> 00:23:00.810
democratic process we have. For some reason, you know,

401
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.280
people are, or some people are, are, are left,

402
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.390
they feel that they are left without options. They,

403
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.900
they have to do something radical. Just voting, uh,

404
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.300
you know, every 4 years or every 2 years

405
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.760
is not enough or you know, standing up or

406
00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:23.949
But uh um For, for elections, but somehow they,

407
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.099
those, there are people who want to do more

408
00:23:27.479 --> 00:23:31.280
to kind of participate in, in, in forms of

409
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.329
political life that are not part of that process.

410
00:23:34.439 --> 00:23:36.599
They want to do a revolution, they want to

411
00:23:36.599 --> 00:23:38.880
do, I don't know, coup d'etat, I don't know,

412
00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:42.630
it's a Because, because of the, I, I don't

413
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.069
know, because of some form of impatience that they,

414
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:50.589
they cannot wait for 4 more years. They want

415
00:23:50.589 --> 00:23:53.630
to do it now because of a lack of

416
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.109
trust in the political process. They don't trust the

417
00:23:56.109 --> 00:23:57.900
system that they want to do it their own

418
00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:02.670
way. Um, BECAUSE of their, I don't know, rebellious

419
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.829
nature, they, they don't want any procedures, they don't

420
00:24:05.829 --> 00:24:08.780
want to follow any, anything, they just, uh, um,

421
00:24:08.829 --> 00:24:12.520
they want to kind of Um, you know, demolish

422
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.410
the system and, and, and, and, and, and perhaps

423
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.719
uh create something new from scratch. I don't know.

424
00:24:19.089 --> 00:24:20.689
But it's a good question, so it's um.

425
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:26.310
So, uh, getting into Gandhi, what were the several

426
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:30.150
different ways that he experienced political failure?

427
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.479
Well, before I get there, I just, uh, He

428
00:24:37.479 --> 00:24:40.520
had a quite an intimate relationship to failure in

429
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.310
the sense that even before he was actively involved

430
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:49.199
in politics, he wrote his autobiography, which was published

431
00:24:49.199 --> 00:24:51.400
when he was still, he, he just got back

432
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.079
from South Africa, back, back to India, and it

433
00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:57.869
was 1925, I think when he published that book.

434
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.479
So it's again, it's, so the biggest, you know,

435
00:25:00.719 --> 00:25:05.280
accomplishment, his, his biggest accomplishments were ahead of him.

436
00:25:05.839 --> 00:25:08.880
HAD not happened yet. And yet he felt this

437
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.239
need to write his autobiography to, to come up

438
00:25:12.239 --> 00:25:15.439
with a story, right, of his, of his failures

439
00:25:15.439 --> 00:25:17.689
because it's a very strange book. It's, it's an

440
00:25:17.689 --> 00:25:19.880
interesting, a very strange book in the sense that

441
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.160
it's a, it's an account of his, of his,

442
00:25:22.209 --> 00:25:25.079
of, of a long, you know, of his long

443
00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:28.359
history of engagement with failure of one kind or

444
00:25:28.359 --> 00:25:33.040
another. He, he complains uh forever, endlessly, he complains

445
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.750
that he was a terrible kid. He was, uh,

446
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.400
he, he, he was such a terrible, you know,

447
00:25:37.609 --> 00:25:41.089
uh uh uh uh student, and then he was

448
00:25:41.089 --> 00:25:43.410
a terrible husband, he was a terrible father and

449
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.609
so on and so on. But of course that's

450
00:25:45.609 --> 00:25:48.719
his own account, right? That that's his own story.

451
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.410
When, when, no matter how harsh you are with

452
00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.650
yourself, when you are the one who, who, who

453
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.489
produces the story, uh, you, you, you are in

454
00:25:58.489 --> 00:26:02.520
charge, you, you, you have some control, it's, it's,

455
00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:06.680
you know. What to select, what, what to put

456
00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.900
in there and what to give out, and so

457
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.339
on. So there is, it's not a totally innocent

458
00:26:11.339 --> 00:26:14.359
uh process there. And of course, after that, we

459
00:26:14.359 --> 00:26:17.359
have the Gandhi, we know, we all know, right?

460
00:26:17.439 --> 00:26:20.849
The Gandhi, the Gandhi, the public person, Gandhi Gandhi,

461
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.880
uh, uh, you know, the, the Mahama, uh, the

462
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.520
new, the face of India, of, of, of the

463
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.380
struggling of the India. STRUGGLING for independence. It's a,

464
00:26:30.739 --> 00:26:35.410
and we do have a series of failures, uh,

465
00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.699
starting from, you know, small things like the way

466
00:26:39.699 --> 00:26:41.819
in which he dealt with his asso some of

467
00:26:41.819 --> 00:26:45.400
his associates who, who, who left him were unhappy

468
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.670
because of his style, political style and, and, and.

469
00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.069
And, and so on, but the biggest would come

470
00:26:53.069 --> 00:26:57.030
later and they would somehow involve him and his

471
00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:59.699
life as well and says that he was killed

472
00:27:00.219 --> 00:27:03.260
eventually because of some of those failures. It's uh

473
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:06.750
his murder, his assassination was in a way the

474
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:11.329
expression. Or spectacular, the physical expression of, of those

475
00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:14.569
failures. He, he was in the end, he was

476
00:27:14.569 --> 00:27:17.010
perceived as a, as a, as a traitor by

477
00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.589
some Indians as, as an ineffective figure, as, as,

478
00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:24.699
as somebody who kind of messed everything up, even

479
00:27:24.699 --> 00:27:28.530
if the country had become independent now, right? Um.

480
00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.150
It's, it's a, it's a, there's so many of

481
00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:33.310
them. So, in the book, I, I try to

482
00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.780
cover some. The book was not, of course, about

483
00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.589
Gandhi per se. He was, he's one of, one

484
00:27:38.589 --> 00:27:41.329
of the characters. So I, I, I kind of,

485
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:43.619
I had to make a selection and focus on,

486
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.869
on some of them. So it's, there's the failures

487
00:27:46.869 --> 00:27:51.579
of Gandhi, the politician, um, that I paid some

488
00:27:51.579 --> 00:27:54.000
attention to. They are the failures of Gandhi, the,

489
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.969
the The guru, because he was also a spiritual

490
00:27:56.969 --> 00:28:01.650
master, he wanted to teach Indians how to live

491
00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:06.719
better lives, how to redeem themselves, how to, uh,

492
00:28:06.729 --> 00:28:10.130
uh, become spiritually superior and, and I don't know,

493
00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:14.839
um, and the failures of, as he himself said,

494
00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:18.530
of Gandhi, the, the, the husband, Gandhi, the father,

495
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.489
and so on. So I'm not sure we have

496
00:28:20.489 --> 00:28:22.329
time to go with all those details, but that

497
00:28:22.329 --> 00:28:23.530
those would be some of them.

498
00:28:24.349 --> 00:28:27.229
Mhm. But I, I mean, generally speaking, what do

499
00:28:27.229 --> 00:28:31.310
you think that the political life of Gandhi teaches

500
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:35.030
us about the value of failure in the political

501
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.099
realm and how to approach politics?

502
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.989
Uh, Good question. Um, WHAT I try to do

503
00:28:43.989 --> 00:28:50.599
there. Even if it's not immediately intuitive. I connect,

504
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.869
or, or people don't expect that to, to, to

505
00:28:52.869 --> 00:28:56.109
be done. I connected Gandhi to a certain kind

506
00:28:56.109 --> 00:29:00.030
of utopia, bad utopianism. So I go, I went

507
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.750
back to his, to his uh Hins barrage, the

508
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:05.010
book he wrote while he was still in South

509
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:11.560
Africa. Hinzarage a very important, very interesting. Also disturbing

510
00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:16.270
book because well before he, he, he moved back

511
00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.880
to India, well before he was a, you know,

512
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.760
a fighter for independence, Gandhiro there, some, some very

513
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:28.239
strange things. It was a anti-Western manifesto, anti, not

514
00:29:28.239 --> 00:29:33.739
just anti-Western, anti-modern manifesto in which, for example, he

515
00:29:34.119 --> 00:29:37.880
He blames for the ills of India, of, of,

516
00:29:37.939 --> 00:29:42.079
you know, colo colonial India. He blames England, of

517
00:29:42.079 --> 00:29:45.800
course, the British Empire, but more specifically, he blames

518
00:29:47.319 --> 00:29:51.050
Uh, certain features of the Western civilization, of which,

519
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.770
uh, uh, England was part, namely, he blames, uh,

520
00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:01.530
railways, doctors, lawyers, It's a very strange argument he

521
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:05.000
makes, um, he makes because he is saying that,

522
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:08.489
well, because of those things, India isn't in the

523
00:30:08.489 --> 00:30:10.989
state in which it is, all those things, I

524
00:30:10.989 --> 00:30:14.010
say, yeah, and he, he comes up with very

525
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:18.329
strange arguments and, and, and, and, and odd examples

526
00:30:18.329 --> 00:30:22.250
like I don't know, because of the trains, because

527
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:25.650
of the trains, uh there is hunger and poverty

528
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:29.170
in India. How come? Well, because of the trains,

529
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.589
because we have railways and trains, you know, individual

530
00:30:32.589 --> 00:30:36.380
farmers can ship away their, you know, their crops

531
00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.500
and they can sell them, you know, for a

532
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.140
better price elsewhere, and which means that the local

533
00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.099
community, you know, of that, of those farmers would

534
00:30:45.099 --> 00:30:51.160
remain without enough, enough to eat. Uh, ALSO because

535
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.880
of the, because of the, of the trains, you

536
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.040
know, people, people move around, people travel, right? And

537
00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.839
along with them, travel, you know, you know, bacteria

538
00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:04.180
and, and micro microbes and so on. So they,

539
00:31:04.439 --> 00:31:07.770
they, the, the, basically what, what he's saying, trains

540
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:12.119
and railways spread disease. And the same with doctors.

541
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.689
It's, uh, the doctors are, you can, uh, I

542
00:31:15.689 --> 00:31:17.849
don't remember some of the phrases, I think some

543
00:31:17.849 --> 00:31:22.329
diabolical figures for him because why? Because they do

544
00:31:22.329 --> 00:31:25.119
the desection from Gandhi, there was a, there was

545
00:31:25.119 --> 00:31:28.750
no way, so to, you know, to produce some,

546
00:31:28.849 --> 00:31:31.930
some kind of, you know, medicine, you have to

547
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:34.329
test it first and you will test it on

548
00:31:34.329 --> 00:31:36.449
animals and for him, that was a, that was

549
00:31:36.449 --> 00:31:41.540
an absolute crime. And, um, and, and, and so

550
00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.869
on and so forth, and so on and so

551
00:31:43.869 --> 00:31:47.000
forth. It's a very, very peculiar book. So, to

552
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.800
go back to your original point, he has a

553
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.920
solution for that. So all those eels, you know,

554
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.974
which he identified. IN, in that book could be

555
00:31:56.974 --> 00:32:01.255
removed, could be, uh, you know, uh solved by

556
00:32:01.454 --> 00:32:04.645
kind of resurrecting this India of uh this, this

557
00:32:04.854 --> 00:32:07.814
classical Indian civilizations where of course there are no

558
00:32:07.814 --> 00:32:10.974
trains and no doctors and no lawyers, but somehow

559
00:32:10.974 --> 00:32:14.055
uh is a pure place, a place where people

560
00:32:14.055 --> 00:32:18.175
live spiritually and so forth. So that's, that, that's

561
00:32:18.175 --> 00:32:20.295
kind of to me, that's a, that reads like

562
00:32:20.295 --> 00:32:26.270
an utopia was he was. Being here in utopianism

563
00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:30.209
and What, that was right, as we, as we

564
00:32:30.209 --> 00:32:32.209
discussed earlier, that was first, it was in the

565
00:32:32.209 --> 00:32:35.839
early 20th century. Decades later, when he goes back

566
00:32:35.839 --> 00:32:38.250
to India and in a position to kind of

567
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:42.849
design politically the, the, the, the independent India, he

568
00:32:42.849 --> 00:32:44.849
tries to put that, some of that into practice,

569
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.770
and it was a disaster. I mean, And to,

570
00:32:47.849 --> 00:32:49.810
to, if I am, if I can use, you

571
00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:53.729
know, one word is purity here. We don't, so

572
00:32:53.729 --> 00:32:58.329
he was obsessed with purity, including political purity and,

573
00:32:58.369 --> 00:33:00.969
and, and, and, and perfection, of course. What he

574
00:33:00.969 --> 00:33:04.000
wanted was a perfect country, was a perfect India,

575
00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:08.439
was a perfect pure, perfect community, and that was,

576
00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:13.060
that was a problem because Such things cannot happen,

577
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.439
uh, uh, uh, while, you know, in this world,

578
00:33:16.569 --> 00:33:19.209
we are not pure, we can never be. We

579
00:33:19.209 --> 00:33:21.479
are not perfect, we can never be perfect and,

580
00:33:21.489 --> 00:33:23.989
and so on. So to, to try to, to

581
00:33:23.989 --> 00:33:27.069
kind of, you know, bring them into, into being,

582
00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:31.449
into existence, some kind of utopian project where you

583
00:33:31.449 --> 00:33:35.770
claim that this community, this society is perfect. That's

584
00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.810
a, that's a, that's a very dangerous political project.

585
00:33:39.229 --> 00:33:40.880
And of course, I, I kind of I tell

586
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.900
his story uh alongside with the, the French Revolution

587
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:50.180
and the Russian Revolution where we have similar, similar

588
00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.089
attempts of, of, of, of creating this, this perfect,

589
00:33:53.579 --> 00:33:58.839
perfect society where there's no exploitation, no equality. So

590
00:33:58.839 --> 00:34:02.349
no inequality and so on, but in the process,

591
00:34:02.599 --> 00:34:06.079
they would exploit a lot. They would kill millions,

592
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.330
they would destroy everything. How, how is that possible?

593
00:34:09.438 --> 00:34:12.090
So you have this something at the very core

594
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.560
of the, there is something at the very core

595
00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.879
of the utopian project that that profoundly undermines it.

596
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:19.750
Mhm.

597
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.590
So, and now talking about social failure, the main

598
00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.909
figure you bring into the book is Emil Shuan.

599
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.199
So, could you tell us why you I, I

600
00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:34.899
mean, tell us a little bit about Shiran and

601
00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.550
why you chosen to represent social failure.

602
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:43.030
Because I love him. Uh, HE was, uh, he

603
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.510
was such, I mean, we are, he was a

604
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.550
fellow Romanian, and I, I had this, I, I

605
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:52.429
knew of him long before I, I had my

606
00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:56.350
infatuation with his work. He's a, he's a classic

607
00:34:56.350 --> 00:35:00.149
here. Uh, HE'S such an interesting, so he, he's

608
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:04.729
intrins, his work is, you know, intrinsically interesting and

609
00:35:04.729 --> 00:35:08.389
interesting and valuable. But then his life story was,

610
00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:14.860
you know, likewise, uh, uh, compelling. Um, AND I

611
00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.340
kind of sketch his biography in, in, in my

612
00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.580
book, I had to kind of present some of,

613
00:35:21.699 --> 00:35:25.219
some of the episodes, some of the more memorable

614
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.280
episodes of his life, of his life. He was

615
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:33.959
um very early on, he, he became infatuated with

616
00:35:33.969 --> 00:35:38.760
with the Nazis, for example, a brilliant man, highly

617
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.860
gifted and so on, he goes to Germany to

618
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.479
finish his, you know, to, to finish his uh

619
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.709
uh education, graduate education, and he gets, he gets

620
00:35:47.709 --> 00:35:49.689
um, he, he falls in love in love with

621
00:35:49.689 --> 00:35:53.610
Hitler. He wakes up, uh, that would last for

622
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:57.179
a few years. Uh, HE, he wakes up. Then

623
00:35:57.179 --> 00:36:00.300
he gets infatuated with the Romanian uh iron guard,

624
00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.939
which is the local, the local fascist movement. And

625
00:36:03.939 --> 00:36:06.100
so after a number of failure of political failures

626
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.459
like this. He decides to kind of to stay

627
00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:13.439
away from politics altogether. He moved to France, adopts

628
00:36:13.439 --> 00:36:16.500
French as his language. He had been working before

629
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.780
in Romanian and German, uh, both of which he

630
00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.840
spoke perfectly, but now, now he, he, he feels

631
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.260
he has this need to kind of, uh, choose

632
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:29.580
a third language, a totally new language to him,

633
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.939
in which you become a, a, a, a really

634
00:36:31.939 --> 00:36:36.729
good. Uh, uh, um, PERFORMER because he's, he's French

635
00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.909
as, as, as anyone would, you know, any French

636
00:36:39.909 --> 00:36:42.969
speaker will tell you is, is, is, is, is,

637
00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.699
is splendid and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

638
00:36:45.729 --> 00:36:49.280
and memorable and, and, and his steps that are,

639
00:36:49.419 --> 00:36:53.100
are com complex stylistically and, and, and, uh, and

640
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:56.290
of course philosophical as well. So he comes to

641
00:36:56.290 --> 00:37:01.850
France to technically do his PhD or uh some

642
00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:05.129
PhD. But he, from the very beginning, he has

643
00:37:05.129 --> 00:37:07.439
this idea that he will never finish. He will

644
00:37:07.439 --> 00:37:10.320
never write a dissertation. He said his plan was

645
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.919
to move to Paris and live the life of

646
00:37:12.919 --> 00:37:15.840
a parasite. He would, he would only, he wanted,

647
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
he only wanted access to, you know, to the

648
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.280
student cafeteria and dorms and so on to be,

649
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.080
you know, to live Chile in Paris, that, that

650
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:28.679
was all he was after. Um, SO he, his

651
00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:32.159
life now enters a new phase. He's no longer

652
00:37:32.159 --> 00:37:36.909
political, you know, he's, he has become quite Distinctly

653
00:37:36.909 --> 00:37:42.510
apolitical, and he, his life has a new dimension,

654
00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.270
a new style. He's like a digenist. He's a

655
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:49.389
civic in, in, in Paris. uh uh DOES not

656
00:37:49.389 --> 00:37:52.429
belong, does not have any belongings, does not belong

657
00:37:52.429 --> 00:37:57.129
to any school, any institution. He lives off uh

658
00:37:58.219 --> 00:38:01.860
I don't know, uh um charities, uh he lives

659
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.560
uh uh uh very humbly, but philosophical. He's very

660
00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.860
proud of that kind of life. He writes back,

661
00:38:08.939 --> 00:38:12.729
he writes home, his letters to his parents are,

662
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:16.020
are kind of, you know, uh expressed this, this,

663
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.739
this, this sense of, of accomplishment. I'm, I'm very

664
00:38:18.739 --> 00:38:21.659
happy like, like this. And that's when he writes

665
00:38:21.659 --> 00:38:25.290
those uh French books starting with, in the late

666
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:28.780
40s. When, you know, one after the other, they,

667
00:38:28.959 --> 00:38:32.719
they come out and, and then reveal this, this

668
00:38:32.719 --> 00:38:34.669
new thinker, new kind of thinker. He was, he

669
00:38:34.669 --> 00:38:36.760
was hailed as a, as a, as a, as

670
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.310
a, as a, as a fresh thinker by, by

671
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:43.229
a number of, you know, critics and he got

672
00:38:43.229 --> 00:38:47.199
uses, for example, realized, you know, he, he's transport

673
00:38:47.199 --> 00:38:49.719
and so on. Um, HE would never have a

674
00:38:49.719 --> 00:38:51.879
proper job and toward the end of his life,

675
00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:54.560
there are some interviews which I used. He would,

676
00:38:54.639 --> 00:38:57.439
you know, he would be very proud of, of,

677
00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.879
of never having had a proper job. He would

678
00:39:00.879 --> 00:39:04.639
say at some point, that's my biggest accomplishment. That's

679
00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:06.959
my biggest accomplishment. The fact that they never had

680
00:39:06.959 --> 00:39:09.739
to, to have a job that I haven't, that,

681
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.959
that I didn't have to destroy myself with an

682
00:39:12.959 --> 00:39:17.250
office job, with a career. So he was, uh,

683
00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:20.729
he was an, not an outcast because nobody, nobody

684
00:39:20.979 --> 00:39:24.649
kind of rejected him. He was, he placed himself

685
00:39:25.169 --> 00:39:27.729
at the, at the margins and uh as a,

686
00:39:27.739 --> 00:39:32.320
you know, distant observer, uh um as a contemplator,

687
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.489
he would not have any kind of Uh, commercial,

688
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:39.000
you know, engagement with the world, you would not

689
00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:41.479
make a living, you would not be a good

690
00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:44.489
consumer, a good citizen, and that put him in

691
00:39:44.489 --> 00:39:48.290
a position to observe, to see how, how things

692
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:52.129
happened, how per you know, the French, the Frenchmen.

693
00:39:52.475 --> 00:39:55.854
HIM were leading their lives and, and, and, and

694
00:39:55.854 --> 00:39:59.375
spending and, and, and, and, and, you know, engaging

695
00:39:59.375 --> 00:40:02.935
in, in capitalism, whereas he was, he, all that

696
00:40:02.935 --> 00:40:07.094
time he was an observer, which was again, gave

697
00:40:07.094 --> 00:40:10.935
him plenty of insight. You could tell as you

698
00:40:10.935 --> 00:40:13.854
read those his books from, from the later period.

699
00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:16.909
He was a good observer of, of the, of

700
00:40:16.909 --> 00:40:19.550
the French life and not just the French, but

701
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:24.020
the modern Western civilization. Mhm.

702
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.419
But I, I mean, looking at his life and

703
00:40:27.419 --> 00:40:30.820
his philosophy, do you think that it tell us

704
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.780
and when it comes to raising failure as you

705
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.699
do in your book, what do you think it

706
00:40:36.699 --> 00:40:40.459
tells us about how we think about what it

707
00:40:40.459 --> 00:40:43.139
means to be successful in life?

708
00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.570
Excellent. Yeah. Well, it's, it's kind of, it's, it's

709
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.489
it. It's on an on an alternative viewpoint. It's

710
00:40:50.489 --> 00:40:55.199
a very important, very, um, it's a, it's a

711
00:40:55.199 --> 00:41:00.360
compelling alternative viewpoint. The viewpoint of somebody who chooses

712
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.469
not to get, to get involved, somebody who, who,

713
00:41:03.479 --> 00:41:06.800
who decides not to have a job, not to

714
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.429
be, you know, a productive member of, of, of

715
00:41:09.429 --> 00:41:13.879
society. It's a, it's a very different lifestyle from,

716
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.239
from the mainstream. We all, you know, we aspire

717
00:41:17.239 --> 00:41:20.090
to have career from careers from the very beginning.

718
00:41:20.169 --> 00:41:22.239
We are, we are, we are set up, we

719
00:41:22.239 --> 00:41:25.649
are wired to become, you know, to compete, to,

720
00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:30.080
to acquire, to, to possess, to, to move up,

721
00:41:30.169 --> 00:41:33.879
to, to kind of uh uh out um uh

722
00:41:33.879 --> 00:41:39.550
outwit, outdo, out, out, outspend the others. It's, it's,

723
00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:42.250
it's, it's a, it's a, uh, it's not, it's

724
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.570
a life that, of course, we, we are all

725
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.209
doing, but it's not the, I don't think it's

726
00:41:46.209 --> 00:41:48.810
the best life we can, we can run and

727
00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:51.889
others like him because he may be a singular

728
00:41:51.889 --> 00:41:54.800
figure, he may be a, you know, uh um

729
00:41:55.709 --> 00:41:58.899
A very special case, but he's not unique. There,

730
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.060
there have been others. Uh, THERE have been others

731
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.540
like him, and we have in literature, we have

732
00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:08.780
some examples and, uh, um, for example, in, in,

733
00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:13.540
in, in, in Russian literature, uh, Goncharov has a

734
00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.459
brilliant novel, uh exactly about this kind of, this

735
00:42:17.459 --> 00:42:21.709
kind of uh The life of, of an Adler,

736
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:26.510
idler. Um, SOMEBODY who chooses not to do anything.

737
00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:30.830
It's a, you know, not doing stuff, not, not

738
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:35.629
leading this, you know, profitable life, uh, not being,

739
00:42:35.909 --> 00:42:39.429
choosing not to be a consumer, uh, is, is

740
00:42:39.429 --> 00:42:41.780
a radical choice which very few of us would,

741
00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:45.439
would be able to make, but a very, to

742
00:42:45.439 --> 00:42:50.040
me, uh uh uh. A very telling choice. We,

743
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.959
we, we have a lot to learn from, from

744
00:42:52.959 --> 00:42:57.030
somebody who chooses, chooses to occupy that position. I,

745
00:42:57.159 --> 00:42:59.070
I would say I would, I would, I would

746
00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:02.520
pay attention to anyone who does that precisely because

747
00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.399
I am myself not able to do it. It's,

748
00:43:05.479 --> 00:43:08.399
it's somebody who goes against the strict system, somebody

749
00:43:08.399 --> 00:43:12.530
who, who, who, who, who Who decides to kind

750
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:15.330
of undermine the whole thing. It's really, it's somebody

751
00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:18.689
I really need to understand that, that, that point

752
00:43:18.689 --> 00:43:21.639
of view because that would help understand my own

753
00:43:21.639 --> 00:43:25.439
our own positions when it comes to, you know,

754
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.409
productive lives and so on. Uh, IT'S also more,

755
00:43:28.449 --> 00:43:31.969
more, more important, I would say. That's the life

756
00:43:31.969 --> 00:43:36.360
of contemplation. It's a very important uh lifestyle in

757
00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.239
the sense that you have for centuries, you know,

758
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:42.959
east and west and and and ancient times and

759
00:43:42.959 --> 00:43:45.610
in more recent times, we have this figure of

760
00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:49.870
the contemplator and think of the Buddhist monks, think

761
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:52.449
of the, you know, fathers of the, of the

762
00:43:52.449 --> 00:43:56.050
church of the, you know, the desert fathers. It's

763
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:59.040
It's, it's this life where you choose not to

764
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.439
possess anything, not to, to, uh, not to work,

765
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.959
not to be active, instead, you want to understand,

766
00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:08.959
you want to contemplate. It's a very respectable and

767
00:44:08.959 --> 00:44:12.590
very profound and very serious way of life that

768
00:44:12.919 --> 00:44:16.879
that fewer and fewer of us, uh, this, you

769
00:44:16.879 --> 00:44:19.919
know, choose today but Charan was one of them.

770
00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:22.429
And that's why I, I, it's worth, I think

771
00:44:22.429 --> 00:44:25.590
it's worth following, it's worth paying attention to, it's

772
00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:30.100
worth uh um uh at least considering. Mhm.

773
00:44:30.979 --> 00:44:33.540
And so the last kind of failure and then

774
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:37.270
we'll get into some more general questions about failure

775
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:42.030
and its value is biological failure and you bring

776
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:45.550
up the example of Yukio Mishima. So could you

777
00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:46.560
tell us about it?

778
00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:53.070
Well, uh, he was, um, he was quite, quite

779
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:57.310
somebody. He was a Many of your viewers would

780
00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:04.030
know a Japanese writer and playwright and, and he,

781
00:45:04.149 --> 00:45:06.110
well, he started out as a writer, but he

782
00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:09.050
ended up as being irritated at some point, he,

783
00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:12.689
he was a bodybuilder and, and a performer, he

784
00:45:12.689 --> 00:45:16.129
made movies and he, he acted in movies at

785
00:45:16.129 --> 00:45:19.389
some point, he even was an orchestra conductor. I

786
00:45:19.389 --> 00:45:21.389
mean, it's a, you, you, you wonder what he

787
00:45:21.389 --> 00:45:25.270
was not, it's Uh, but, so you, you could

788
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:27.790
sense as you, as you read his story, as

789
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:30.909
you engage with his life, his biography, you could

790
00:45:30.909 --> 00:45:34.909
sense a sense of this, uh, discontent. He was

791
00:45:34.909 --> 00:45:37.830
not exactly happy. So even if he was, you

792
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:43.469
know, productive, successful, you know, novelist. Uh, YOU could

793
00:45:43.469 --> 00:45:48.110
tell he at some point he becomes dissatisfied, disenchanted

794
00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:51.110
with novel writing, and he wanted something else. He

795
00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:55.149
wanted more, he wanted to experience. So he moves

796
00:45:55.149 --> 00:45:58.310
quite a bit between, you know, genres and genres

797
00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.929
and art forms and so on, but there is,

798
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:04.459
the crisis is growing, the crisis is growing, and

799
00:46:04.459 --> 00:46:07.489
eventually, It's, it's, it's a very complicated story. We,

800
00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:10.729
we cannot cover much here, but eventually he, he

801
00:46:10.729 --> 00:46:15.459
ends up even building this private army, a private,

802
00:46:15.489 --> 00:46:17.929
uh uh uh like a, like a small army

803
00:46:17.929 --> 00:46:22.929
of, of private soldiers where, who are, whom he

804
00:46:22.929 --> 00:46:26.790
indoctrinates and, uh, you know, uh uh feeds and,

805
00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.860
and, and, and, and maintains, you know, out of

806
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:33.090
his own pocket. Um. You would say, I mean,

807
00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:37.310
many, many, many historians and, you know, commentators said,

808
00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.270
well, that's, he was a fascist, and he was,

809
00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.870
uh, this, this, he was, he wanted to have

810
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:46.060
a private army to overthrow the government. Because he,

811
00:46:46.159 --> 00:46:49.000
he ended up in a, he, he, he died,

812
00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.360
he killed himself when he, he failed at overthrowing

813
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.320
the government. He basically staged a coup d'etat and

814
00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.989
he failed and he committed suicide as a result,

815
00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.679
but it's much more complicated. I, I, I tried

816
00:47:01.679 --> 00:47:04.560
to, to explain some of that in, in, in

817
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.439
my book. It's, it's much more complicated. It's Uh,

818
00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:10.209
you, you, you, you, you sense as you, as

819
00:47:10.209 --> 00:47:12.969
you move on, that you really, what he planned

820
00:47:12.969 --> 00:47:16.090
there, what he plotted was not the overthrow the

821
00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:19.770
government plotted his own failure. He, he had this

822
00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:24.330
dream at some point he starts fantasizing about his

823
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:28.010
being a samurai. Of course, samurai in Japan had

824
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:30.760
been outlawed in Japan for more than a century

825
00:47:31.129 --> 00:47:35.120
when, you know, Japan became you know, chose to

826
00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:39.389
be, to become westernized, the, the, the, the, the,

827
00:47:39.409 --> 00:47:42.879
the, the class of the samurai was, was outlawed

828
00:47:42.879 --> 00:47:45.709
and samurai were not in existence at the time.

829
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:48.360
However, he wanted to be one of them. So

830
00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.229
he wanted to behave, he started behaving like like

831
00:47:51.239 --> 00:47:56.510
like a samurai, inventing some kind of genealogical tree

832
00:47:56.510 --> 00:48:00.629
for himself like a samurai genealogy. Uh, uh, YOU

833
00:48:00.629 --> 00:48:06.429
know, picking up, or, you know, swords, um. You

834
00:48:06.429 --> 00:48:10.870
know, picturing himself in the shape in the form

835
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:13.750
of a samurai. And of course, when you, when

836
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:16.149
you're a samurai, you adopt a certain code of

837
00:48:16.149 --> 00:48:20.310
honor and you have everything is, is meaningful, everything

838
00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:22.590
you do. And as part of that kind of

839
00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:26.050
life, if you fail as a samurai, you have

840
00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:29.070
to commit suicide. He wanted to commit suicide, he

841
00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.709
was kind of He was, he was toying with

842
00:48:32.709 --> 00:48:35.669
the idea of dying which he saw in, in

843
00:48:35.669 --> 00:48:39.550
very strongly uh uh erotic terms, but he wanted

844
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.310
to, to, to die as a samurai. That's why

845
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:44.949
he kind of in, in my reading, he plotted

846
00:48:44.949 --> 00:48:48.350
all that kind of, all that coup d'etat. But

847
00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:51.870
he plotted it to fail. He never imagined, he

848
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:54.909
never wanted it to succeed, but he didn't want

849
00:48:54.909 --> 00:48:57.620
to be, he, he never cared about taking, you

850
00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:01.850
know, power or, or, you know, uh ruling Japan,

851
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:05.149
overthrowing the emperor, whatever. What he, all he wanted

852
00:49:05.149 --> 00:49:08.949
was to, to fail spectacularly as a uh uh

853
00:49:08.949 --> 00:49:11.870
in the process and as, as, as a result,

854
00:49:11.909 --> 00:49:14.145
as any good sum. I would do to commit

855
00:49:14.145 --> 00:49:17.185
suicide, to commit more exactly that kind of uh

856
00:49:17.185 --> 00:49:20.584
ritual, ritual sepuu which was part of the, of

857
00:49:20.584 --> 00:49:24.334
the samurai's uh way of life and, and death.

858
00:49:24.705 --> 00:49:26.064
So it's a, it's a long, it's a, it's

859
00:49:26.064 --> 00:49:29.544
a long quite, quite complicated story um of which

860
00:49:29.544 --> 00:49:33.254
I, I could only mention a few moments here,

861
00:49:33.465 --> 00:49:35.814
but it's something I would say it's something worth

862
00:49:35.814 --> 00:49:39.360
uh worth uh exploring. Mhm.

863
00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.600
And in this case, I mean, the ultimate kind

864
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:46.399
of biological failure, I would imagine is death. But

865
00:49:46.719 --> 00:49:51.080
isn't the fact that death is a reality liberating

866
00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.439
in a way? I mean, isn't it liberating to

867
00:49:53.439 --> 00:49:57.629
know that whatever we might do achieve, or all

868
00:49:57.629 --> 00:50:01.580
of our failures will not matter at all in

869
00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:02.149
the end?

870
00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:04.889
It should be, right? The way in which you

871
00:50:04.889 --> 00:50:08.649
frame the question points to a certain understanding of,

872
00:50:08.689 --> 00:50:11.530
of death, right? You say, you said death is

873
00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:17.620
liberating, but uh you know, Not, not everybody sees

874
00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.080
that in the, in those terms. It's uh we,

875
00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.459
we normally, most of, most of us, I would

876
00:50:22.459 --> 00:50:24.830
say, uh, tend to see that as some kind

877
00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:30.030
of uh oppressive, uh, scary thing, event, right? It's

878
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:33.030
a, there's nothing liberating there. We stay, we try

879
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:35.520
to stay away from it, we postpone it, we,

880
00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:38.540
we go to, you know, great lengths uh uh

881
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:41.379
to avoid it. So it's that, that, that time,

882
00:50:41.459 --> 00:50:44.169
the way in which you, you, you frame that

883
00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:47.219
uh is, is coming from a spiritual a certain

884
00:50:47.219 --> 00:50:51.300
spiritual understanding of that, but ordinarily, ordinarily, we don't

885
00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:54.379
do that. Ordinarily, we, we, we, we, we would

886
00:50:54.379 --> 00:50:57.889
do anything. We would do anything not to, not

887
00:50:57.889 --> 00:51:00.949
to be there, not to know that, as if,

888
00:51:00.959 --> 00:51:04.719
of course, showing the process, there's nothing liberating about

889
00:51:04.719 --> 00:51:08.010
it, but if, as you say, and Which, of

890
00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:09.639
course, happens to be my own point of view

891
00:51:09.639 --> 00:51:12.639
in the book. Um, THERE is something liberating because

892
00:51:12.639 --> 00:51:16.350
you, you study, you know, the Western philosophy from,

893
00:51:16.439 --> 00:51:19.439
it's a, the, the whole history of Western philosophy

894
00:51:19.439 --> 00:51:22.679
is kind of, uh, uh, intimately connected to, to

895
00:51:22.679 --> 00:51:28.120
the experience of death to Teaching word, trying, teaching

896
00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:32.239
yourself that death is something to be embraced, that

897
00:51:32.239 --> 00:51:35.800
is something exactly as you said, liberating. We have

898
00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.219
to teach ourselves, you know, but it's a long,

899
00:51:38.439 --> 00:51:41.149
difficult process. It takes a lifetime to do that,

900
00:51:41.439 --> 00:51:44.000
to teach ourselves that, that it's a, there is

901
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.830
something liberating about it. It's a long, that's the,

902
00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.399
that's. And you have that in Plato and in

903
00:51:49.399 --> 00:51:52.639
so it's, it's a, the very moment of when

904
00:51:52.639 --> 00:51:56.239
Western philosophy was born, that very notion was born

905
00:51:56.239 --> 00:51:58.439
as well. So it's a very interesting how this

906
00:51:58.439 --> 00:52:01.479
notion of philosophy as preparation for death, as training

907
00:52:01.479 --> 00:52:04.760
for, for death as, as, as, as an death

908
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.629
as an experience, as a, as a liberating experience,

909
00:52:07.919 --> 00:52:10.520
that very thing was born with the Western philosophy.

910
00:52:12.899 --> 00:52:15.489
So let me read the quote from the book.

911
00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:18.699
At a certain point, you say, quote, failure can

912
00:52:18.699 --> 00:52:24.739
work wonders of self-realization, healing, and enlightenment. Could you

913
00:52:24.739 --> 00:52:25.219
explain that?

914
00:52:27.909 --> 00:52:32.449
Well, um, In the sense that uh uh uh

915
00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:38.679
a mature, you know, a mature intelligent engagement with

916
00:52:38.679 --> 00:52:45.500
failure, for example, admitting, uh, Recognizing your failures and

917
00:52:45.699 --> 00:52:49.800
trying to understand what's behind uh processing them, you

918
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:55.530
know, uh. Working upon yourself, trying to, you know,

919
00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:58.689
see things from a different angle. All of that.

920
00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.979
Of, of course, in the first instance, is a

921
00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:05.179
form of addressing failures, a form of, you know,

922
00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.780
coming to terms with failures and so on. But

923
00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:12.260
in the long run, that amounts, amounts to uh

924
00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:16.350
to a well-lived life, to, to self-realization. It's if

925
00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:18.340
you do that concept, if you manage to do

926
00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.060
that, you know, on a daily basis, if you

927
00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:23.100
manage to, to, to, to over, not just to

928
00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:28.090
overcome your own limitations and your. On your own

929
00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:30.739
imperfections and your own failures, but to kind of

930
00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:34.489
place them into a bigger context and see them

931
00:53:34.489 --> 00:53:37.780
as part of who you are and come, you

932
00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:40.689
come to understand that we are, you are, each

933
00:53:40.689 --> 00:53:44.050
one of us is a failed creature because we

934
00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:46.810
are born imperfect, we are born to die. We

935
00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:50.050
are finite, we are, you know, next to nothing.

936
00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:52.330
Understanding all that in a, in a, in a,

937
00:53:52.469 --> 00:53:56.090
in a, in a serious philosophical way, that's self-realization.

938
00:53:56.479 --> 00:53:59.729
And that's, that comes with a kind of, it

939
00:53:59.729 --> 00:54:05.820
comes with a high degree of, of Well, of

940
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:08.479
understanding, if you, if you manage to get there,

941
00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.360
I, I think you understand quite a bit about

942
00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.560
what it is to be human, about what, what's,

943
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.800
what should there be our expectations be, what should

944
00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.399
we do? It's, it's kind of it, it puts

945
00:54:19.399 --> 00:54:21.840
you in a very different place, a place for,

946
00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.320
from where you can see things differently, not just,

947
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.199
you know, the practical things around you, but see,

948
00:54:27.239 --> 00:54:28.919
you know, the big questions a bit different.

949
00:54:30.389 --> 00:54:32.949
Do you think that it is possible for someone

950
00:54:32.949 --> 00:54:35.260
to live without success?

951
00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:41.570
No, I don't think the success, especially in the

952
00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:44.729
sense in which we use the term before as

953
00:54:44.729 --> 00:54:47.959
succession, that's impossible because, because we, we, we are,

954
00:54:48.409 --> 00:54:52.169
we rely on those successions of events of, of

955
00:54:52.169 --> 00:54:56.250
states, of, of, of, of things, right? So success

956
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:58.969
is, is there all the time, right? It's uh,

957
00:54:59.169 --> 00:55:02.010
we, it's, it's, it's not possible because it's, it's

958
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:04.320
totally, it would be a totally unrealistic. We are

959
00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:08.540
surrounded by success in that sense of succession. Uh

960
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:12.179
But, um, of course, we, we need to talk

961
00:55:12.179 --> 00:55:14.659
about success in the other sense as well of

962
00:55:14.949 --> 00:55:18.550
social success and so on. It would be depressing,

963
00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:20.489
I would say it would be quite depressing. I,

964
00:55:20.629 --> 00:55:24.050
my, my problem was not. Uh, IT'S not that,

965
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:26.250
it's we, we, we have success and we should

966
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:31.260
have, we should have. The problem is What do

967
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:36.919
you do when? You don't know how to. To

968
00:55:36.919 --> 00:55:41.080
see beyond when you kind of, you, you get

969
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:47.000
intoxicated and, you know, um, yeah, intoxicated by because

970
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.340
every Social success and that's not in the mere

971
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:54.439
sense of succession of things, but in the sense,

972
00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:57.929
in the more narrow sense of Um, social success,

973
00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:01.919
career success comes with a high degree of intoxication.

974
00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:04.969
We, when we experience, you know, big success in

975
00:56:04.969 --> 00:56:08.560
our lives, we, so much, so much in our

976
00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.360
lives becomes, you know, a blind spot. We, we,

977
00:56:11.449 --> 00:56:14.239
we, we no longer see ourselves in, in a,

978
00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:16.969
in a realistic light. We, we, everything is out

979
00:56:16.969 --> 00:56:20.870
of proportion. There's so much that's Uh, falls into

980
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:24.709
oblivion. We don't, we are, we are actually those

981
00:56:24.709 --> 00:56:30.350
moments of major social successes are really dangerous in

982
00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:33.709
a sense because it's, it puts us, it places

983
00:56:33.709 --> 00:56:37.030
us on an orbit that may, may lead us

984
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:39.590
in a dangerous space. We are no longer in

985
00:56:39.590 --> 00:56:41.909
touch with who we are. It's kind of, it's

986
00:56:41.909 --> 00:56:44.189
intoxicating and intoxication is not good.

987
00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:48.659
So I have one last question then, in the

988
00:56:48.659 --> 00:56:50.810
book, you, at a certain point, you talk about

989
00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:55.260
the failure-based therapy. Could you tell us about that?

990
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:58.689
I mean, in what ways is it a therapy

991
00:56:58.979 --> 00:57:01.620
and what is it about

992
00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.739
exactly? It comes, uh, yeah, I guess the question

993
00:57:04.739 --> 00:57:07.659
is related to your previous question. It comes with

994
00:57:07.659 --> 00:57:11.560
a success thing, right? Um, FIRST of all, there

995
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:14.739
is a tradition of philosophy as, as therapy is

996
00:57:14.739 --> 00:57:18.239
as old as perhaps philosophy itself, it shows up

997
00:57:18.239 --> 00:57:21.760
in, in, in the Socrates because we just mentioned

998
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:24.800
him in poetus and in Buddhism and in so

999
00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.629
many mountainous, so many in Niezsche, uh there is

1000
00:57:27.629 --> 00:57:32.239
uh this understanding of philosophy, philosophizing as as healing.

1001
00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:36.110
Uh, IT, it, it, uh, you, you, something happens

1002
00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:39.120
to you, you get, uh, really, you, you, you

1003
00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:43.030
get healed. If you engage properly with, with thinking,

1004
00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:47.239
philosophizing, philosophy etc. ON, uh, as a result, you

1005
00:57:47.239 --> 00:57:49.590
come up, you come, you come out, uh, uh,

1006
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:54.379
uh, um, a healed person, uh, uh. But it's

1007
00:57:54.379 --> 00:57:56.620
a, it's, it's not, of course, uh in, in,

1008
00:57:56.739 --> 00:57:59.530
in, in, in this way in which I use

1009
00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:03.229
that phrase in the book is, is more metaphorical,

1010
00:58:03.739 --> 00:58:07.090
uh, failure-based, based therapy in the sense that we,

1011
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:12.090
we should kind of Try to digest those failures

1012
00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:15.250
and turn them into, into health. We should not,

1013
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:18.000
you know, just like I I said earlier, uh,

1014
00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:22.250
that success is intoxicating, inebriating, right? We can, we

1015
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:26.129
can become drunk on success, which is very unhealthy

1016
00:58:26.129 --> 00:58:30.129
state to be. We can become healed if we

1017
00:58:30.129 --> 00:58:34.139
process our failures properly. There is this sense of,

1018
00:58:34.149 --> 00:58:39.050
of realism of, of, of um Yeah, even, even,

1019
00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.459
even sanity in, in, in, in, uh, that comes

1020
00:58:42.459 --> 00:58:46.360
from, from, not so much from failure, but from,

1021
00:58:46.729 --> 00:58:50.929
from what failure leads to, which is humility because

1022
00:58:50.929 --> 00:58:53.610
the point of the book is, is, is failure,

1023
00:58:53.649 --> 00:58:56.889
not failure, not for its own sake, but failure

1024
00:58:56.889 --> 00:59:00.050
as a way of humility. So for me and,

1025
00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:02.320
and, and that's the project of the book, uh.

1026
00:59:03.889 --> 00:59:07.760
The therapy, the healing comes from humility. It's you

1027
00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:11.000
you are brought down to earth, uh, that's, that's

1028
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.090
humility. When you fail, you're brought down, you're brought

1029
00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:17.729
down to earth, you are humbled, and that's a

1030
00:59:17.729 --> 00:59:21.050
place to, to start again. That's uh, to start

1031
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:23.530
better because you are, it's a place, it's a

1032
00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:26.330
place to, to, to, to, to be, to be

1033
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:29.689
healed. All that, you know, flying around, all that,

1034
00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:33.770
you know, intoxication, those, those big dreams, those. Uh,

1035
00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:37.770
um, uh, MOMENTS of, of puberty of, of arrogance

1036
00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:40.770
and so on are not good for, for, for

1037
00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:44.239
your mental sanity, for especially for those around you

1038
00:59:44.550 --> 00:59:47.330
who see you as, as this arrogant, uh this,

1039
00:59:47.409 --> 00:59:50.850
this, this uh sufferable human beings. So that's the

1040
00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:53.580
humanity that comes from failure is, is, I, I,

1041
00:59:53.649 --> 00:59:56.370
I would say a key ingredient to that theory.

1042
00:59:58.379 --> 01:00:01.090
Great. So, the book is again in praise of

1043
01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:04.610
failure for lessons in humility. I'm leaving a link

1044
01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:07.340
to it in the description of the interview. And

1045
01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:10.260
caustic, uh, apart from the book, would you like

1046
01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:13.219
to mention any places on the internet where people

1047
01:00:13.219 --> 01:00:14.449
can find your work?

1048
01:00:16.439 --> 01:00:20.879
They can Google me Uh, they will find it.

1049
01:00:20.929 --> 01:00:24.989
I have no. No specific places to to.
