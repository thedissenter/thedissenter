00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.480
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.440
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes, and

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.970
today I'm joined by a return guest guest, Doctor

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.119
Matty Haru. He's professor of philosophy at Aalto University

5
00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.399
School of Business in Finland. Last time we talked

6
00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:21.680
about his book on antenatalism and today we're talking

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.639
about his latest book, Pure Cloning. So, Mati, welcome

8
00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:28.360
to the show. It's a pleasure to have you

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.879
on again.

10
00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.610
Thank you, thank you very much. Always a pleasure

11
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.168
to be here.

12
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.540
So start by telling us then, what is pure

13
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.470
and in pure cloning?

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.389
Well, cloning as you mean means producing genetic copies

15
00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:49.319
or genetic neo copies, there's some mitochondria, whatever, somewhere

16
00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:52.750
in the often of an organism, so copies. And

17
00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:57.279
when people started to talk about human cloning 50,

18
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.319
60 years ago, uh, they also talked about genetic

19
00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:08.448
enhancements. About making people, people better, either by selection

20
00:01:08.448 --> 00:01:13.399
before the new individual even exists, or by gene

21
00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.940
technology when they do exist. And this is what

22
00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:22.500
Tua Takala and I uh call in our book,

23
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.870
impure cloning. The book's name is pure cloning, but

24
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.339
the impure cloning is cloning mixed with something else.

25
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.510
And most debates about cloning. Have at least an

26
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.169
element of this impurity somehow ingrained in them. Now,

27
00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:43.699
our innovation, so to speak, is to remove this

28
00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:48.220
impurity from the discussion and talk about cloning and

29
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.059
only about cloning, and without any selection or, or

30
00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:57.190
genetic manipulation. Just about producing a genetic copy or

31
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.300
copy of an existing human individual and this is

32
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.540
what we call pure cloning. So, To summarize, pure

33
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.929
cloning is just cloning, impure cloning is cloning plus

34
00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:09.758
something else.

35
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.539
OK. Uh, AND in the book, you go through

36
00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:18.059
different kinds of objections to human cloning because it's

37
00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:22.100
human cloning that we're focusing on mostly here. Start

38
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.500
by telling us about the theological objections. What is

39
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.139
this kind of objection?

40
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.830
Well, different world religions have different attitudes on, on

41
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.190
human clothing and to name a few, there's Buddhism,

42
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.270
there's Islam, and Catholic Christianity and conservative Protestant Christianity.

43
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.990
These are, these have a negative view on, on

44
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.589
human clothing. They are saying, no, no, shouldn't do

45
00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:52.550
that. And then we have Hinduism, Judaism, moderately Protestant

46
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.070
Christianity who I say, um, have a moderately cautious

47
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.570
view and they are saying, well, maybe. If, if

48
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.699
you prove this and that and the other. And

49
00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:07.820
the theological objections typically emphasize the aspect of playing

50
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.979
God in one way or or another. So applying

51
00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:16.729
complicated technology to reproduction and in this case, human

52
00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:22.979
reproduction is too dangerous for fallible, weak, uh, idiotic

53
00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:27.029
human beings to, to handle. Something will go wrong,

54
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.580
they, they say. If not concretely, then at least

55
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.389
humankind will be. Uh, EXPOSED to hubris, the excessive

56
00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.220
pride and a deceptive sense of control. So this

57
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.419
is the argument from playing God. It doesn't really

58
00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.600
need to have anything to do with God except

59
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.729
that God, uh, as a concept is an all-knowing,

60
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.169
all powerful being and fallible human beings are not.

61
00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.809
Now, there's a funny episode early on uh when

62
00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:01.320
in 1997, the Roman Catholic Church seemed to be

63
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.160
saying for a while, for a short while, that

64
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.839
human clones would have no souls, and that's why

65
00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:11.509
we shouldn't uh make them. Uh, THIS was a

66
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.880
view that was publicized, but, and then the church

67
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.880
retracted the view almost immediately. But uh that uh

68
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.589
episode. In the history of the ethics of cloning

69
00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:27.640
inspired to. The main author in, in here and

70
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.559
me to write and produce a rock opera called

71
00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.769
Playing God, uh, which we wrote and produced and

72
00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:38.760
performed all over including in the end in an

73
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.679
off off-Broadway musical theater, the K Playhouse in, in

74
00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:47.920
uh Manhattan in 2015 to a full house, by

75
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.709
the way. So cloning has been good to us.

76
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.239
Uh, SO, apart from the theological objections, what is

77
00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:59.420
the legal status of cloning? I mean, what does

78
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.679
the law have to say about it?

79
00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:06.260
Negatively, uh, the, the cloning of non-human beings was

80
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.010
not, is not particularly restricted. The list of mammals

81
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.980
that have been cloned when I last checked included

82
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.269
at least cows, mice, rats, goats, pigs, rabbits, cats,

83
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.589
horses, and dogs, and then when you go down

84
00:05:21.859 --> 00:05:25.299
the complexity ladder of, of uh beings, and other

85
00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:29.339
animals and organisms are fairly free. Yeah, nobody bats

86
00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:32.859
an eyelid if they are. Uh, COPIED and, and

87
00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:35.540
cloned and produced. It's the cloning of humans that

88
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.459
seems to be the, the problem. And human cloning

89
00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:43.130
by the nuclear transfer method. So the nuclear transfer

90
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.890
method is merging a nucleus from, from one organism

91
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.690
with an egg from which the nucleus has been

92
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.630
removed of another organism, putting them together and um

93
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.500
doing something magical and, and then it comes alive

94
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.589
and starts developing that, that combination. And that has

95
00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:05.750
been uh clo human cloning by nuclear transfer method.

96
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.140
It has been legally prohibited around the world since

97
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.549
1997. There was a flurry of uh legislation saying

98
00:06:13.549 --> 00:06:15.589
that we shouldn't do that. Nobody knew how to

99
00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:18.829
do it, but, uh, exactly with humans, but it

100
00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:21.399
was prohibited all the same. And that, of course,

101
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.750
was the year when Dolly the sheep was cloned

102
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.989
in Scotland and then well give simply just woke

103
00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:30.510
up to the possibility of a similar. Attempt in

104
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.510
humans, but to your question, the legal status of

105
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.670
human cloning, not permitted. No, no.

106
00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:41.170
Mhm. Uh, IN the book, you also go through

107
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:47.049
three main kinds of theoretical moralities, namely, utilitarian, the

108
00:06:47.049 --> 00:06:53.450
ontological, and teleological moralities. Tell us first about utilitarian

109
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.399
moralities.

110
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.230
I'm just thinking about, uh, are we making it

111
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.450
sound like a, a moral philosophy 101 here? Well,

112
00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:06.750
perhaps we are, perhaps that's just, that's OK, a

113
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.029
little repetition for everyone. So the classical utilitarian rule

114
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:14.339
is that we should always aim to maximize good

115
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.640
and it, it's measurable good. I mean, any moral

116
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.350
theory could say good, but this is uh somehow

117
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.619
measurable well-being or pleasure or, or something like that.

118
00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:28.649
And now legislation on social policy and even public

119
00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:32.920
opinion insofar as we can control it should follow

120
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.529
this principle of maximizing good. And this means that

121
00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:39.250
when, when we are doing that in legislation and

122
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.829
social policy in particular, then the excluded alternatives are

123
00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:49.869
Arbitrary dictatorship, authoritarian measures, we shouldn't do something just

124
00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:53.250
because a dictator is saying so, or we shouldn't

125
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.989
be doing them on sentimental responses. So democracy won.

126
00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:02.070
So in, in that end uh with unpredictable consequences

127
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.779
is, is, uh, not allowed within the utilitarian. It's

128
00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:09.149
a very rational thing, just maximize the, the well-being

129
00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:12.750
and, and be done with it. Now, the maximization

130
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.540
of good or well-being should, however, and this is,

131
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.989
this is the second main tenet of utilitarians. It

132
00:08:19.989 --> 00:08:22.989
should be moderated by what is called the harm

133
00:08:22.989 --> 00:08:27.179
principle. It says that we should not interfere with

134
00:08:27.179 --> 00:08:31.890
one another's freedom unless the exercise of that freedom

135
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.260
would be harmful to someone else. I shouldn't hold

136
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.820
your hand from moving unless it is approaching my

137
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.380
nose and, and then I can stop it. I

138
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.940
can interfere with your freedom if you're about to

139
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.460
harm me. Now, if both of these requirements are

140
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.340
taken seriously, then we have a morality or political

141
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.190
ideology that states two things actually, and in this

142
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.619
order. First, don't harm anyone else, including your citizens

143
00:09:00.619 --> 00:09:03.340
if you are a legislator, unless they are harming

144
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:08.659
others. And secondly, and only secondly, promote everybody's good

145
00:09:08.659 --> 00:09:11.460
where it can be done without causing harm. So

146
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.090
that's utilitarianism for you.

147
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:19.320
And among the utilitarians we have specifically the bio

148
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.130
utilitarians, which I think are the ones that would

149
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.010
apply the most in the case of cloning specifically.

150
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:31.330
So what are the bio utilitarians and what kinds

151
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.539
of arguments do they have in favor of cloning?

152
00:09:35.429 --> 00:09:38.390
Well, the name by the utilitarian can be applied

153
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.190
to philosophers who, uh, first of all, reject traditional

154
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.390
and sentimental reactions against new technologies. That would be

155
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.710
the, uh, what the first principle of utilitarianism rules

156
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.150
out, but who also argue that technologies should be

157
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.229
allowed and even encouraged because of the benefits that

158
00:09:57.229 --> 00:10:01.260
they can bring. We'll get back to that can.

159
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.979
Now, genetic manipulation can lead to finding a cure

160
00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:08.979
for cancer. Human cloning can lead to advances in

161
00:10:08.979 --> 00:10:13.299
reproductive autonomy. People who who cannot have children of

162
00:10:13.299 --> 00:10:17.619
their own now could perhaps clone themselves or their

163
00:10:17.619 --> 00:10:21.289
partners or, or, or someone to have these children,

164
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.859
perhaps uh their themselves or their partners if they

165
00:10:24.859 --> 00:10:29.309
wanted to have biological replicas of themselves, whatever. Now,

166
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.000
as long as this is physically dangerous, clones have

167
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.840
health problems or cloning is problematic, uh, technically, it

168
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.760
should not be done according to by your utilitarians.

169
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.799
But as soon as the procedure can be made

170
00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:45.840
safe, then it should be permitted because otherwise it

171
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.039
would just be uh authoritarian or sentimental uh objections

172
00:10:51.239 --> 00:10:56.369
to it. So harm to traditional values or outraged

173
00:10:56.369 --> 00:10:59.450
feelings of the citizens, which some people think are

174
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.250
good legal arguments for bio utilitarians, they, they have

175
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.320
no value. They are not admissible as evidence.

176
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.440
And what are the main challenges then to the

177
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.789
bio utilitarian analysis?

178
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.349
It is mainly the frequent use of the word

179
00:11:17.349 --> 00:11:21.789
can. It's, it's a question of modality. It's not

180
00:11:21.789 --> 00:11:23.409
that it is or it should be, it is

181
00:11:23.409 --> 00:11:26.650
that it, it can be. Technologies can have good

182
00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.940
applications. They can benefit humanity, they can be safe.

183
00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:35.489
What are they? So those who advocate uh a

184
00:11:35.489 --> 00:11:38.179
little bit more caution say that we should know

185
00:11:38.179 --> 00:11:42.770
more before we launch into dangerous experiments. And my

186
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.929
co-authorua Talla has, has given a name for the

187
00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:48.989
bio utilitarian ethos here. It can be called the,

188
00:11:49.169 --> 00:11:53.690
the hopeful principle. Now, from environmental policies, as you

189
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.530
know, we all know, uh it's opposite number, which

190
00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.650
is the precautionary principle, and the precautionary principle is

191
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.380
saying, if in doubt, don't do it. But the

192
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.580
hopeful principle turns this around and says if there

193
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.719
is hope, do it. So, and this is what

194
00:12:10.719 --> 00:12:15.599
bio utilitarians regularly stand by. If it can cure

195
00:12:15.599 --> 00:12:19.359
cancer, then who cares about possible dangers? And the

196
00:12:19.359 --> 00:12:22.440
critics of bio utilitarians, of course, point, point out

197
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.200
that this approach is a little bit uh reckless

198
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.109
for, for that test.

199
00:12:28.809 --> 00:12:31.820
So I asked you, when it comes to utilitarianism,

200
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.299
I asked you about cloning in general, but when

201
00:12:35.299 --> 00:12:39.780
it comes to pure cloning specifically, is there a

202
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.409
positive utilitarian case for it?

203
00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:46.409
There is a positive uh utilitarian case. In the

204
00:12:46.409 --> 00:12:48.799
book, we use uh with Tua, we use, uh,

205
00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:51.869
an example that we invented in the aftermath of

206
00:12:51.869 --> 00:12:56.080
lolly's cloning 30 years ago now, uh, soon. Uh,

207
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.090
A couple loses their child horrible accident or something

208
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.489
like that. They cannot have children of their own

209
00:13:02.489 --> 00:13:05.250
anymore. Something happens to reproductive organs in, in that

210
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.940
same accident. Would it be wrong of them to

211
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.650
clone the lost child and have their child back?

212
00:13:10.859 --> 00:13:15.219
Uh, VERY sentimental, very, uh, appealing. Uh, MANY people

213
00:13:15.219 --> 00:13:17.659
think that the couple now should have the, even

214
00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:21.090
if they, uh, on technical grounds, all the cloning

215
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.219
is wrong, they would say that, oh, it would

216
00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:26.099
be so wonderful if they had this child. And

217
00:13:26.109 --> 00:13:29.429
if it's not wrong, then that's your positive utilitarian

218
00:13:29.429 --> 00:13:33.460
case for pure cloning. There's no genetic enhancement involved,

219
00:13:33.549 --> 00:13:37.619
just the creation of the new or whatever individual.

220
00:13:39.679 --> 00:13:43.640
So we've talked about utilitarianism now to get into

221
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:49.010
the ontology and specifically can and the ontology. Does

222
00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:54.119
it have arguments in favor or and against cloning

223
00:13:54.119 --> 00:13:56.909
or simply arguments against it?

224
00:13:57.789 --> 00:14:01.190
Uh, IT has both. The main Kian Kantian rule

225
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.789
is that you should always respect humanity in yourself

226
00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:08.020
and in others. So treat humanity as an end

227
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.679
in itself and never just as a means. And

228
00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:13.960
that's the rule. And from there on, all hell

229
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.479
breaks loose and, and everything is, is interpretation, you

230
00:14:17.479 --> 00:14:20.150
know, how do you treat humanity as an end

231
00:14:20.599 --> 00:14:23.400
exactly and how do you treat humanity as a

232
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.179
means in yourself and in others. So there are

233
00:14:26.179 --> 00:14:31.270
many, many readings of that. Now, many can ethicists

234
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.909
believe that producing a child by cloning would mean

235
00:14:34.909 --> 00:14:38.659
treating it as a mere means. The child would

236
00:14:38.659 --> 00:14:42.109
just be an instrument for the parents to have

237
00:14:42.109 --> 00:14:47.090
offspring and If it's, uh, particularly if it's impure

238
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:51.289
cloning offspring whose features and characteristics they would know

239
00:14:51.289 --> 00:14:55.690
in, in advance, so that's, that's uh manipulation in

240
00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.770
there too. Some permissive Kians believe that the rules

241
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.289
should be applied a little more leniently and they

242
00:15:03.289 --> 00:15:06.880
say that. But hang on, the interpretation of the

243
00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.330
principal parents do not treat a child only as

244
00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.289
a means to their own ends if they simultaneously

245
00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:17.330
wish and expect and and hope that the child

246
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.409
will come to have a good life of its

247
00:15:19.409 --> 00:15:20.859
own independently.

248
00:15:22.849 --> 00:15:27.250
So before we get into teleological moralities, I have

249
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:31.409
sort of a more general question in regards to

250
00:15:31.409 --> 00:15:37.640
the clash between consequentialists and the ontological philosophers, uh,

251
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.250
is it still visible in today's debates?

252
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.630
I think it is and, and this all started

253
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:49.919
already in the 1960s. So gene science began to

254
00:15:49.919 --> 00:15:54.559
emerge and ethicists. HAD to say something about it.

255
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.799
We always have to say something about everything. Now,

256
00:15:57.849 --> 00:16:02.330
utilitarian or consequentialist philosopher said, good, good, go ahead.

257
00:16:02.809 --> 00:16:06.500
And then Cantiiano the ontological philosopher said back backstop

258
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.419
at once. And this distinction uh is still very

259
00:16:11.419 --> 00:16:17.059
much alive. Utilitarians will, as a rule have unquestioningly

260
00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:20.570
permissive views uh on cloning, and Kantians will have

261
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.940
more restrictive views on it, of course, there is

262
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.780
variation, but that's the general rule. And this difference

263
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.390
is also often linked to the liberal conservative dividing.

264
00:16:31.739 --> 00:16:34.969
ETHICAL and political ideologies.

265
00:16:37.099 --> 00:16:41.929
So when it comes now to teleological moralities, since

266
00:16:41.929 --> 00:16:46.500
people are probably more familiar with utilitarian and the

267
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:52.080
ontological moralities, tell us first what are teleological moralities.

268
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.150
OK, so now we come to the uh moral

269
00:16:55.150 --> 00:17:01.359
philosophy 101, part, part 3. Part one, utilitarians are

270
00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:05.680
concerned about consequences, uh, how much well-being or, or

271
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.510
bad for you, it will, uh, it will produce.

272
00:17:08.969 --> 00:17:12.719
Kantians are concerned about sticking to reason principles like

273
00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:15.598
the humanity principle, always treat humanity as an end.

274
00:17:16.108 --> 00:17:19.949
Now, teleological, um, and this is the oldest moral

275
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:24.660
theory in European moral philosophy. Mostly Aristotelian ethicists are

276
00:17:25.229 --> 00:17:29.790
concerned about what is natural or normal and right

277
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.910
for the, for the species we are talking about.

278
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:38.189
And for humankind, they often say it is natural

279
00:17:38.189 --> 00:17:41.229
and normal and right for the species to try

280
00:17:41.229 --> 00:17:46.530
to survive, find nutrition and shelter. Have children, raise

281
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:50.150
your children to continue the family line. And that

282
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.770
is natural, and it's natural, it's normal. It is

283
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.680
also natural and normal and right to act according

284
00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.589
to your, your reason. But the dictates of reason,

285
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:05.060
um, since Aristotle are basically essentially the same as

286
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:09.459
these dictates of our, our bodily nature. And now

287
00:18:09.459 --> 00:18:13.459
in bioethics, the most popular uh teleological approach is

288
00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:18.140
neo-Tomism. That's the official morality of the, and philosophy

289
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.619
of the Roman Catholic Church, and it is 1/19

290
00:18:21.619 --> 00:18:27.540
century formulation of the philosophies of Aristotle and Thomas

291
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.310
Aquinas.

292
00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:35.010
And and which kinds of theological moralities apply to

293
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.170
debate surrounding cloning then?

294
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.209
An alternative to, to neotomism would be uh virtue

295
00:18:43.209 --> 00:18:47.310
ethics, uh, which would be more directly derived from

296
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:51.170
Aristotle's thinking. This would be the Nico Mark and

297
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:55.010
ethics uh directly read, and this would emphasize the,

298
00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.449
the golden mean doing everything in good proportion, good

299
00:18:59.449 --> 00:19:03.489
proportion, not too much, not too little, just the

300
00:19:03.489 --> 00:19:06.750
right amount would be the golden mean. And this

301
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.630
approach has not to, to our knowledge, been fully

302
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.150
developed in the context of, of cloning because the

303
00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:17.709
debate has been dominated by neotoism man official or

304
00:19:17.709 --> 00:19:23.189
semi-official applications and in this, the verdict is ultimately

305
00:19:23.189 --> 00:19:26.630
made actually by some kind of the council of

306
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.109
the wise. I mean, it's, the logic is that

307
00:19:30.109 --> 00:19:33.869
ordinary people, you and I cannot make considered judgments

308
00:19:33.869 --> 00:19:37.540
in difficult cases. Uh, WE don't know all the

309
00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:41.099
facts, but more importantly, uh, we don't know all

310
00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:43.569
the moral factors that are relevant to the case,

311
00:19:43.579 --> 00:19:46.060
and we don't know how to apply them, and,

312
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.510
and so. I'm trying not to be Impolite or

313
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.229
unfriendly, but, but the, the impression I'm getting is

314
00:19:55.229 --> 00:19:59.010
that, that only, only a fully credited neoimist philosopher

315
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.680
is up to the challenge.

316
00:20:02.439 --> 00:20:06.359
Uh, AND what kinds of arguments do these teleological

317
00:20:06.359 --> 00:20:11.410
moralities produce in favor or against pure cloning?

318
00:20:12.209 --> 00:20:15.089
Well, the ones we know, know of our neotomists

319
00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:18.209
and according to them, cloning humans uh would be

320
00:20:18.209 --> 00:20:20.810
wrong, and this has something to do with playing

321
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:25.579
God again, or trying to exercise too much control

322
00:20:25.579 --> 00:20:29.410
in reproduction or something. We explain all that in,

323
00:20:29.609 --> 00:20:31.650
in detail in, in the book. So that would

324
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.900
be the neoomist thing. The virtue ethical alternative would

325
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.069
be to, to think, and this would be interesting

326
00:20:38.069 --> 00:20:40.349
to develop, it would be to think in terms

327
00:20:40.349 --> 00:20:44.510
of excesses and deficiencies and the golden mean. I

328
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.630
mean, to ask questions like, do we fear cloning

329
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.430
too much? Or are we not being cautious enough

330
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.099
about, about it? Do we fear it too little?

331
00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:56.790
And if either of these is the case, then

332
00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.280
in the original Aristotelia virtue ethical model, those are

333
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.890
vices, yeah. Doing an emotional reaction of the wrong

334
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.520
type and cloning would be uh vicious or wrong.

335
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.250
But then, of course, if you could prove that

336
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.780
cloning is the golden mean between too much fear

337
00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.209
and, and too little fear, then it would be

338
00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:21.849
virtuous and, and right. Well, it has not been

339
00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:24.369
developed and our main objection in the book is

340
00:21:24.369 --> 00:21:27.489
uh to, to both of these approaches is That

341
00:21:27.489 --> 00:21:32.329
they are not transparent or or understandable. The council

342
00:21:32.329 --> 00:21:36.359
may have made this decision or that uh decision,

343
00:21:36.489 --> 00:21:39.050
but why did they make it? If, if I

344
00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:41.160
cannot understand it, it cannot be right.

345
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.810
So we've talked about theoretical moralities and now I

346
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:51.430
would like to get into ideological rationalities and in

347
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.650
the book you talk about two different sets of

348
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:58.329
four principles and I would like to start with

349
00:21:58.329 --> 00:22:06.089
the Georgetown principles that, that include beneficence, non-malleficence, autonomy

350
00:22:06.089 --> 00:22:09.089
and justice. So could you explain each of them?

351
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.609
Yes, in the 1970s, uh, ethicists and, and biomedical

352
00:22:14.609 --> 00:22:18.300
researchers in the United States decided that they, they

353
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.260
want to encapsulate or collect together all moral concerns

354
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.750
into a set of simple rules that researchers and,

355
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:30.640
and medical professionals could then use. And the first

356
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.719
rendition were the Beaumont principles. Originally, there were only

357
00:22:34.719 --> 00:22:38.430
3 of them and then they grew into 4.

358
00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:42.689
And now Georgetown University philosophers Tom Bum, the Canon.

359
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:48.589
And James Childress, a utilitarian, they put their heads

360
00:22:48.589 --> 00:22:51.310
together and they formulated the set, which is now

361
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.030
known as the four principles of bioethics, the ones

362
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:58.939
that you mentioned, beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice. Now,

363
00:22:59.229 --> 00:23:03.170
uh, beneficence and non-mallefience were together as a utilitarian

364
00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:07.609
principle in the Beaumont principle still, but then Um,

365
00:23:07.939 --> 00:23:10.859
B and Childers decided that it makes more sense

366
00:23:10.859 --> 00:23:14.930
to talk about not harming separately and then benefiting

367
00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.579
separately, which I think makes good sense as I

368
00:23:18.579 --> 00:23:23.069
explained, utilitarianism does make sense. And now Bum and

369
00:23:23.069 --> 00:23:26.819
Childres originally argued that these principles can be based

370
00:23:26.819 --> 00:23:30.790
on All valid moral theories by which they meant

371
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.869
the all the the can and and the utilitarian

372
00:23:33.869 --> 00:23:38.810
theories, but they then Perhaps some friends whispered in

373
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:43.640
the ears this Aristotelian approaches, as well. Uh, uh,

374
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:47.449
SO they, they included the Aristotelian approach and then

375
00:23:47.449 --> 00:23:52.010
they diluted, diluted, diluted the theoretical content and ended

376
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:58.339
up saying 20 years ago, uh, and that the

377
00:23:58.339 --> 00:24:01.729
pri the principles that they have formulated, they reflect

378
00:24:01.729 --> 00:24:06.300
a shared universal common morality, which means that every

379
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.979
one of us believes in them. There have been

380
00:24:08.979 --> 00:24:10.099
objections to that one.

381
00:24:11.689 --> 00:24:16.969
And based on these Georgetown principles, how should cloning

382
00:24:16.969 --> 00:24:21.459
be approached and can we derive both arguments in

383
00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:24.420
favor and against it from these principles?

384
00:24:25.209 --> 00:24:28.530
Yes, there would be arguments both for and against.

385
00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:31.979
Now many things here depend on the facts and,

386
00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.640
and on the interpretation. Now, does cloning produce a

387
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:40.660
benefit? Is it important enough? Would it harm those

388
00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.770
creative? Would it harm some others? Would it promote

389
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.619
autonomy? Would it violate autonomy? Would it be equitable

390
00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:50.959
unfair, or would it be unfair? And so on

391
00:24:50.959 --> 00:24:53.750
and so forth. So the background ideology of the

392
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:57.540
Georgetown principles and the Beaumont principles before that, uh,

393
00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.859
that the background is liberal and outcome oriented, now

394
00:25:01.859 --> 00:25:05.469
liberal in the sense of uh promoting freedom, not,

395
00:25:05.569 --> 00:25:08.150
not liberal in the current American sense when it

396
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:12.819
means socialism or something awful like that social responsibility.

397
00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:16.619
Uh, AND this sort of this background guides the,

398
00:25:16.699 --> 00:25:21.800
the application to real life cases. The result for

399
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.199
the decades has been that autonomy, the freedom to

400
00:25:26.199 --> 00:25:29.959
choose will get emphasized in this. Autonomy will be

401
00:25:29.959 --> 00:25:34.000
the first principle, the first among equals, uh, as

402
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.520
long as no one comes to direct and concrete

403
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:42.819
harm, autonomy and freedom to rule and No, still,

404
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.060
uh. 30 years on cloning as a technology is

405
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:51.199
still unsafe. Um, AS far as we know, uh,

406
00:25:51.319 --> 00:25:54.079
so the current verdict still is don't do it,

407
00:25:54.439 --> 00:25:57.599
but with the proviso that once it is not

408
00:25:57.599 --> 00:26:01.359
dangerous anymore, then the situation can be reassessed and

409
00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:05.469
if people's autonomy says We, we'd like to do

410
00:26:05.469 --> 00:26:07.510
it and if there's no clear harm that we

411
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.790
can predict coming out of it, then we should

412
00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:12.910
do it. So the conclusion resembles the one that

413
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:16.349
was fixed by the bio utilitarian. So, so they

414
00:26:16.349 --> 00:26:19.109
go very much hand in hand in, in this

415
00:26:19.109 --> 00:26:19.750
particular case.

416
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:26.250
And then an alternative to the Georgetown for principles

417
00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:29.959
is the Barcelona Declaration. What is that?

418
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.209
Well, already in the 1990s, many of us in,

419
00:26:35.239 --> 00:26:38.599
in Europe and in Latin America and Asia and

420
00:26:38.599 --> 00:26:43.010
Africa were getting frustrated and, and tired and bored

421
00:26:43.319 --> 00:26:47.390
with the Georgetown principles. They were so obviously born

422
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.640
in the United States. They were so obvious liberal

423
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.479
in their. Uh, um, THEN understanding of in the

424
00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:58.810
North American sense and capitalism and consumerism friendly that,

425
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.280
that we said, no, no, no, we want something

426
00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.400
more. And some of us wanted uh more social

427
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:10.280
responsibility, others wanted more respect for traditional values, and

428
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:15.589
still others wanted some deeper philosophical reflection. Um, BY

429
00:27:15.589 --> 00:27:18.390
this time, uh, which Childers were saying that it's

430
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.619
a common morality and you cannot argue with that,

431
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.689
and we said, yes, we are philosophers, we can

432
00:27:22.689 --> 00:27:26.510
argue with anything. So a group of uh European

433
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.630
ethicists at this point managed to get somehow funding

434
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:33.750
from the European Commission to produce an alternative to

435
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:37.540
the Georgetown principle, and the result then of the

436
00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.959
34 years of work. 20 people all together and

437
00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:43.800
all the people they solicited to hell, and the

438
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.829
result was the Barcelona Declaration, uh, published in 2000

439
00:27:48.829 --> 00:27:51.719
and defined a new set of rules and that

440
00:27:51.719 --> 00:27:55.959
was less liberal in, in that sense, less utilitarian,

441
00:27:56.079 --> 00:28:00.079
less individualistic, and it had more emphasis on the

442
00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:05.199
ideals of communality and spirituality and the intrinsic morality

443
00:28:05.199 --> 00:28:06.319
of human actions.

444
00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:10.229
And uh as in the case of the Georgetown

445
00:28:10.229 --> 00:28:15.550
principles, the Barcelona Declaration also includes 4 main principles,

446
00:28:15.589 --> 00:28:20.790
that is autonomy, dignity, integrity, and vulnerability. Could you

447
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:21.189
explain them?

448
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.339
Yes, well, autonomy in this set of rules, it's,

449
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.739
it's not the consumer's freedom to choose anymore. It

450
00:28:28.739 --> 00:28:31.219
is in this set of rules, it's inseparable from

451
00:28:31.219 --> 00:28:34.979
dignity. Now we are working more uh in, in

452
00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:37.900
a Kantian framework in, in line with the Kantian

453
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:42.380
humanity principle, our autonomy as rational beings is the

454
00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.910
basis of our human dignity. And that in turn

455
00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:50.040
is inviolable as a gift from God or nature,

456
00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.930
and we don't have to think about God or

457
00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:55.849
nature literally. It's, it's just a figure of speech.

458
00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:57.930
It's, it's a given. It's something that we, we

459
00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:02.040
haven't made our ourselves. That's the important bit of

460
00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:06.130
the combination of autonomy and dignity now. Now, the

461
00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:09.329
principle of, of integrity, the third one, it posits

462
00:29:09.329 --> 00:29:12.689
that we are not purely intellectual or rational beings.

463
00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.699
So this is going a step. Further from, from

464
00:29:15.699 --> 00:29:19.589
the Kantian thing, uh, the standard cri critique of

465
00:29:19.589 --> 00:29:23.119
Kantian morality is that it's too intellectual, too cerebral,

466
00:29:23.349 --> 00:29:28.099
too brain-oriented or too, too, well, too rational. And

467
00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.619
now integrity is saying that, that we have a

468
00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:35.569
body or to, to say in another way, we

469
00:29:35.569 --> 00:29:38.979
are a body. So we are a body, a

470
00:29:38.979 --> 00:29:44.339
given material essence, a thing. And this thing also

471
00:29:44.339 --> 00:29:46.900
has to be respected and it has to be

472
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.780
respected as diligently as, as our free choices. So

473
00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.500
it's not only about consumer choices. If we are

474
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.060
making the wrong consumer choices, then someone wiser than

475
00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.280
us can in the name of our integrity, say

476
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.459
that we are doing the wrong choice and prevent

477
00:30:02.459 --> 00:30:05.500
us from doing it. So that's respect for our

478
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:10.939
persons transcends our own volition, to put it technically.

479
00:30:11.469 --> 00:30:14.989
Now, vulnerability brings new autotomism into, into the model

480
00:30:14.989 --> 00:30:17.469
in a way that I don't understand, but I

481
00:30:17.469 --> 00:30:22.329
can explain it. People are vulnerable and the Georgetown

482
00:30:22.329 --> 00:30:26.089
reaction would be to remove the vulnerability. Oh, you're

483
00:30:26.089 --> 00:30:28.180
vulnerable. Oh, let me, let me take care of,

484
00:30:28.369 --> 00:30:31.170
let me, let me cure your wounds, so make

485
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:33.810
sure that you don't hurt, hurt yourself anymore, but

486
00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:37.239
not so in the Barcelona Declaration because it, it's

487
00:30:37.449 --> 00:30:40.650
based on the, the neo doistic idea that we

488
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:44.689
must recognize human frailty, human weakness, and we must

489
00:30:44.689 --> 00:30:48.000
embrace it, not try to get rid of it.

490
00:30:49.829 --> 00:30:55.130
So how do these Barcelona Declaration principles apply to

491
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.089
thinking about pure clothing?

492
00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:01.979
I cannot say for sure how exactly the proponents

493
00:31:01.979 --> 00:31:05.540
of the principles would apply them. Uh, I'm not

494
00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.619
one of the council of the wise, but the,

495
00:31:08.739 --> 00:31:12.140
the case against the human cloning often seems to

496
00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.819
be based on the impure dimensions, the assumption that

497
00:31:15.819 --> 00:31:20.180
the new individuals would be improved or enhanced somehow

498
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.910
in the, in the process. Now, in the case

499
00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:26.390
of pure cloning, the problem could be that the

500
00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:31.760
individuals born. WOULD in a sense have pre-lived lives.

501
00:31:31.819 --> 00:31:34.829
They would live in the shadow of, of uh

502
00:31:34.829 --> 00:31:37.989
the, the earlier ones, so to speak. Their futures

503
00:31:37.989 --> 00:31:40.939
would be known to others in a way that,

504
00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:43.979
that their lives shouldn't be, be known. This is

505
00:31:43.979 --> 00:31:46.729
now assuming that a person has already lived a

506
00:31:46.729 --> 00:31:49.540
full life for, for at least some time, and

507
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.680
now we know what Sicknesses they will face and,

508
00:31:52.739 --> 00:31:54.839
and how they will develop and so on. And

509
00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.680
a person's life according to this kind of thinking,

510
00:31:57.939 --> 00:32:02.250
uh should be an unknown mysterious gift, as I

511
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.650
said, uh, and not to build any strawman here,

512
00:32:05.729 --> 00:32:09.209
the, the birth of one clone would not be

513
00:32:09.209 --> 00:32:11.349
the end of the world. I mean, yes, the

514
00:32:11.569 --> 00:32:15.489
Roman Catholic Council, uh, inadvertently said that clones would

515
00:32:15.489 --> 00:32:19.050
not have souls. They, they retracted from, from that

516
00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:21.849
one. It, it's not about one clone. One clone

517
00:32:21.849 --> 00:32:25.770
will not uh uh explode our democratic way of

518
00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:28.540
thinking or, or our religion or, or anything. It,

519
00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:36.599
it is the Increasingly technological reifying instrumentalizing nature of

520
00:32:36.599 --> 00:32:40.680
this kind of reproduction that is uh in court

521
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.670
here that, that is what is blamed. It's a,

522
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.989
it's a critique of modernity, really.

523
00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.979
And one final approach that you talk about in

524
00:32:50.979 --> 00:32:55.339
your book has to do with feminist bioethics. What

525
00:32:55.339 --> 00:32:55.900
is that?

526
00:32:58.699 --> 00:33:02.339
Well, we don't actually go into contemporary feminist thinking

527
00:33:02.339 --> 00:33:04.979
at, at all, not being experts in the, in

528
00:33:04.979 --> 00:33:08.619
the field, our fear. WAS that we make a

529
00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:12.520
horrible mess of, of it. And instead, we cited

530
00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:17.910
some historical examples and used them to Illustrate, throw

531
00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:21.020
light on the, on the case of pure cloning.

532
00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.390
And one example that we used was Mary Mary

533
00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:30.459
Shelley's story of Doctor Frankenstein and his infamous creation.

534
00:33:30.829 --> 00:33:34.140
And as we point out, the monster, monster here

535
00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.900
is not the creature like in all the movies,

536
00:33:38.069 --> 00:33:42.369
but Frankenstein himself because he creates this A child

537
00:33:42.369 --> 00:33:45.479
of his and then uh notices that it's ugly

538
00:33:46.329 --> 00:33:49.650
and then runs away in, in horror and abandons

539
00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:51.530
his child when it turns out to be ugly.

540
00:33:51.609 --> 00:33:55.010
So, on the monster is Frankenstein, uh, not having

541
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.209
a child of, of his liking and then turning

542
00:33:57.209 --> 00:34:00.880
away from it. Now, anyway, the process is, is

543
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.540
faintly analogical to cloning. There's a collection of body

544
00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:08.929
parts like in, uh, we have the, the one

545
00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:14.020
nucleus. And uh for Doctor Frankenstein collects body parts

546
00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:18.649
from morgues and, and medical operation theaters and, and,

547
00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:22.379
and uh graveyards and, and what have you. So

548
00:34:22.379 --> 00:34:24.899
that's one part of the thing. And then there's,

549
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:27.300
there's the other part of body part which uh

550
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.580
in the case of uh nuclear transfer clothing is

551
00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.139
the nucleus which has been removed from, from one

552
00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:35.600
egg, and then they are put together like Dr.

553
00:34:35.649 --> 00:34:41.060
Frankenstein does, then something magical happens. Uh, ELECTRICITY has

554
00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:45.340
been suggested in, in the movies and electricity is

555
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.120
what does the trick in nuclear transfer clothing, so

556
00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.620
boom, and then we have a new, new indi

557
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:56.688
individual there. And now this We are sort of

558
00:34:56.688 --> 00:35:00.368
arguing with Toya in the book, uh, is, could

559
00:35:00.368 --> 00:35:03.489
be the basis of a, of a feminist critique.

560
00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:06.928
You know, the feminist critique could be saying that

561
00:35:06.928 --> 00:35:11.688
women as a creative force are now forgotten totally

562
00:35:11.688 --> 00:35:15.448
in this process, uh, and then the technology that

563
00:35:15.448 --> 00:35:18.698
is used instead of uh letting women do the

564
00:35:19.019 --> 00:35:24.860
thing. Technology can produce only only monsters when the

565
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.969
female uh creative forces or something like that.

566
00:35:29.899 --> 00:35:35.060
Yeah, I understand. So, uh, I have just one

567
00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:39.969
last set of two questions regarding the or the

568
00:35:39.969 --> 00:35:44.409
potential relationship between cloning or pure cloning more specifically

569
00:35:44.409 --> 00:35:49.250
and reproduction in general. So, do the arguments against

570
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:53.639
pure cloning also apply to reproduction in general?

571
00:35:54.979 --> 00:35:57.899
Uh, YES, they do. And, and, and this is

572
00:35:57.899 --> 00:36:01.129
the, this is actually the hidden message of the,

573
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:05.139
of the book. You see all this slay of

574
00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:09.050
hand talk about cloning for all that, this is,

575
00:36:09.139 --> 00:36:11.330
it's real point, the real point of the book

576
00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:15.260
is uh that a rejection of pure cloning is

577
00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:18.620
at the same time, also a rejection of all

578
00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:24.409
reproduction, all childbearing. So the endless debates on, on

579
00:36:24.409 --> 00:36:28.250
the nuclear transfer method and rogue scientists trying to

580
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.050
use it on humans and dignity and autonomy and

581
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:34.889
integrity, they wouldn't have motivated Toyami to, to write

582
00:36:34.889 --> 00:36:37.879
the book. We've been doing this since Dolly, uh

583
00:36:37.879 --> 00:36:41.090
there's nothing new under, under the sun in there,

584
00:36:41.409 --> 00:36:46.590
but our genius master stroke. That um uh was

585
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:51.229
uh confining the discussion to pure cloning and that's

586
00:36:51.229 --> 00:36:54.290
our key and that gave us the strength to,

587
00:36:54.669 --> 00:36:58.459
to try once again. Now, forget about the genetic

588
00:36:58.459 --> 00:37:02.510
enhancements and other extras, just talk about cloning as

589
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:06.389
any reproduction as the image, an image of, well,

590
00:37:06.669 --> 00:37:11.550
I can say the image of all reproduction. Now,

591
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:16.159
the, the best, hardest to refute arguments against pure

592
00:37:16.159 --> 00:37:20.699
cloning, they always center around the ideas of mastery

593
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:24.050
and manipulation. So it would be wrong to put

594
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:27.409
other human beings in a situation where they are

595
00:37:27.409 --> 00:37:32.250
at the mercy of their masters and manipulators. And

596
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.929
in the case of impure cloning, the argument is

597
00:37:34.929 --> 00:37:38.010
that the selection, do, do, do, I'll take this

598
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:41.050
not that, uh, or enhancement, I will mold it

599
00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.729
in my own image. They are the main culprits.

600
00:37:43.969 --> 00:37:46.219
And if you choose your cloned children and change

601
00:37:46.219 --> 00:37:49.290
its genetic uh characteristics for the better, you'll become

602
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:53.959
their. Technological overlord, uh, and you shouldn't do that.

603
00:37:54.219 --> 00:37:57.449
But in the case of pure cloning, the role

604
00:37:57.449 --> 00:38:01.209
of technology in that sense is eliminated. It's just

605
00:38:01.209 --> 00:38:05.889
you and your, your child, whatever the details of

606
00:38:05.889 --> 00:38:10.770
the, of the child's coming to existence. Now, if

607
00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:15.270
the argument then persists, then bringing someone into being

608
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:19.939
without their permission, without their consent is wrong. And

609
00:38:19.939 --> 00:38:22.699
that's then where you have it. The, the case

610
00:38:22.699 --> 00:38:25.820
of pure cloning shows that this is not about

611
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.540
cloning at all. It's about bringing people into this

612
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:34.290
world. The same arguments apply. You should, if you

613
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:37.169
are prepared to reject cloning, your cloning, you should

614
00:38:37.169 --> 00:38:40.600
be prepared to reject all human reproduction. And the

615
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.939
funny thing here is that the arguments against pure

616
00:38:42.939 --> 00:38:46.929
cloning, the ones that survive liberal and moderate objections

617
00:38:46.929 --> 00:38:51.419
are quite conservative and stem from distinctly pro-natalist views.

618
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:54.899
So, neoomism is, is a notable example. So here

619
00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:58.399
we have, we have proven that, that the Catholic

620
00:38:58.399 --> 00:39:03.889
Church is actually against all uh having children's and

621
00:39:03.939 --> 00:39:07.260
the Catholic Church has an antenatalist agenda after all.

622
00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:11.100
Which means that we must have twisted the words

623
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:17.679
somehow to reach this indisputable antenatalist conclusion, but When

624
00:39:17.679 --> 00:39:19.679
you're writing a book like that, you do it

625
00:39:19.679 --> 00:39:23.459
so tightly that I, I cannot honestly see where,

626
00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:25.679
where we went wrong. I, I mean, we, we

627
00:39:25.679 --> 00:39:28.399
must have gone wrong somewhere, but I don't know

628
00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:31.760
where. So I'm waiting eagerly for people to, to

629
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.439
read the book and tell me what, what went

630
00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:36.209
astray.

631
00:39:37.699 --> 00:39:41.570
Yeah, but the, but then I mean, to uh

632
00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.820
try to establish a link. I, I guess that

633
00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.459
to a certain extent you've already established this link

634
00:39:46.459 --> 00:39:49.010
there, but to try to establish a link to

635
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:52.010
the topic that we covered, that was the central

636
00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:55.770
topic of our previous conversation. How does this all

637
00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:58.620
tie to antenatalism then?

638
00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:02.790
Well, this is the connection to antenatalism. Now it,

639
00:40:02.969 --> 00:40:06.239
it, if, if you are arguing against pure cloning

640
00:40:06.239 --> 00:40:09.209
and if you are saying that it doesn't matter

641
00:40:09.209 --> 00:40:12.719
whether there are any enhancements or any selection or

642
00:40:12.719 --> 00:40:15.959
anything, if you are just saying that you shouldn't,

643
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.810
even if it can be made safe, you shouldn't

644
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:23.350
produce children in this way. Then what is the

645
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:25.909
difference from there to, to any other? I mean,

646
00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.489
you can, you can slide down the scale from

647
00:40:28.489 --> 00:40:33.030
cloning to the use of in vitro fertilization to

648
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:36.229
the, to the use of, of an emergency room

649
00:40:36.229 --> 00:40:40.550
for deliveries for this, that, that, that, that, and

650
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:43.649
then when all the technology, the medical technology is

651
00:40:43.649 --> 00:40:47.409
gone, what you have there is the baby, and,

652
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:50.260
and that was the forbidden thing in here.

653
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.590
Right. OK, great. So the book is again, pure

654
00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.989
cloning. I'm leaving a link to it in the

655
00:40:57.989 --> 00:41:00.469
description of the interview as well as a link

656
00:41:00.469 --> 00:41:04.669
to our first talk and Mati, apart from the

657
00:41:04.669 --> 00:41:08.169
book, where can people find your work on the

658
00:41:08.169 --> 00:41:08.620
internet?

659
00:41:09.229 --> 00:41:11.709
I'm, I'm thinking that the best place, uh, these

660
00:41:11.709 --> 00:41:17.639
days is the exploring antenatalism podcast. Mhm.

661
00:41:17.959 --> 00:41:20.360
OK. I will also link to it in the

662
00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.399
description and thank you so much for taking the

663
00:41:23.399 --> 00:41:25.360
