00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.009
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.570
Center. I'm your host, Ricard Lops, and today I'm

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.569
joined by Doctor Michael Levin. He is distinguished professor

4
00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:12.819
in the biology department at Van Vannevar Bush, chair,

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.170
as well as director of the Tuft Center for

6
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.670
Generative and Developmental Biology at Tufts University. And today

7
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.110
we're going to talk about topics like living systems,

8
00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:29.469
the self morphology, collective intelligence, sentience, regenerative medicine, and

9
00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:31.870
more so, Doctor Levin, welcome to the show. It's

10
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.979
a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:34.869
Yeah, thanks for having me. Yeah, nice to meet

12
00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:35.069
you.

13
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.220
So, let me first ask you, what is a

14
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.529
living system?

15
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.540
Well, uh, to be honest, and, and this may

16
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.740
be strange for a biologist to say, uh, I

17
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.340
don't spend much time thinking about the definition of

18
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.700
life, actually. Um, I'm much more interested in the

19
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.819
spectrum of cognition, which I think is actually is

20
00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:57.299
a broader category than, uh, than the set of

21
00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:00.450
living things. But if we wanted to define it,

22
00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.319
I think what we would focus on our Uh,

23
00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:09.129
those cognitive systems that first of all, self-assemble, and

24
00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:12.690
in particular, they self-assemble under metabolic constraints of uh

25
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.919
scarcity of time and energy and things like that,

26
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.209
uh, which demands a coarse graining and, uh, agential

27
00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:21.569
models of the outside world in itself and so

28
00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.760
on. We would talk about, uh, systems that need

29
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.139
to uh interpret their own memories where their own,

30
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.220
uh, the, the Ngrams or the, the traces of

31
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.660
past experience, uh, at any one moment need to

32
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.819
be, need to be interpreted to decide what, what

33
00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.980
to do next. I think we would focus on

34
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.019
the ability of life to, um, scale up the

35
00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:43.660
agency of its components and project them into new

36
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.379
problem spaces, may basically enlarge their, their cognitive life,

37
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.940
uh, like cognitively. I think that life is fundamentally

38
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.779
a kind of, uh, vulnerable system that is fundamentally

39
00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:57.620
oriented forward in time in terms of decision making

40
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.500
and, uh, doing the best they can under the

41
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.150
circumstances that it has. Um, THAT'S, those, those are

42
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.900
the things I focus on. I mean, clearly, uh,

43
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.020
there are many conventional definitions around thermodynamics and evolutionary

44
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.020
change and things like that, but these are the

45
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.979
sorts of things that, um, that I focus on.

46
00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.690
And what is the self in the context of

47
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.550
biology?

48
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.500
Yeah. Uh, I think, I think a useful definition

49
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.460
of a, of a self and I, and, and

50
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.740
for all these definitions, you know, we have to

51
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.619
ask what, what is the use that we get

52
00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:29.259
out of these, right? All, all these terms have

53
00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.259
to provide some sort of, some sort of benefit

54
00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:33.580
in terms of research and discovery. I think that

55
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.520
a useful definition of a self is, um, the,

56
00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:41.220
uh, the owner of specific goals, preferences, and memories

57
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.580
that don't belong to their parts. It's a kind

58
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.059
of emergent hole that is formed by, um, a

59
00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.449
sort of mutually interlocked triad of an option space

60
00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.550
within which it operates. So some kind of problem

61
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.020
space, um, a, a defined cognitive light cone of

62
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.940
goals. So the size of the biggest goals that

63
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.539
it can work towards. So this is very much

64
00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.399
a, a, a definition that relies on. Uh, uh,

65
00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.369
ACTIVE agents having goals and having goal-directed behaviors, so

66
00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.119
the size of the goals and, um, some degree

67
00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:14.130
of, uh, competency to achieve those goals under various,

68
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.009
um, various circumstances. Selves fundamentally live forward in time

69
00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:22.559
their, their decision-making systems that are not well described

70
00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.570
by deterministic backwards-looking models in terms of uh focusing

71
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.470
on the molecular components and why certain things happen.

72
00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:34.720
Um, SELVES arise when Uh, a collection of parts

73
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.559
basically adopts the same, uh, the same way of

74
00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:40.880
understanding the world and functions together to solve problems.

75
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.160
Uh, SORT of related to the topic of self.

76
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.210
Why would you say planaria are such interesting organisms?

77
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.130
Are they really multicellular organisms or not?

78
00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:58.070
Uh, WELL, I do think they're multicellular organisms. Um,

79
00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.679
THERE, there are many fascinating things about planaria. Let

80
00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:02.300
me, let me describe a few. So first of

81
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.309
all just to see what, what planaria are. So

82
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:08.169
these are, um, free living, uh, flat worms that

83
00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.649
are probably about 1 centimeter or so in, in

84
00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.119
length. They have a nervous system, they have a

85
00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:17.760
centralized brain, um, and, uh, they're true bilearians. They're

86
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.070
similar to our ancient ancestor and They have several

87
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.720
amazing properties. 11 remarkable property they have is that

88
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.720
they can regenerate. So if you cut them into

89
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.950
pieces, or in fact, when they reproduce, they tear

90
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.959
themselves in half and then they, and they regenerate

91
00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:33.910
and you can cut them into many pieces. So,

92
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.320
one of the consequences of reproduction where instead of

93
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.239
using a sperm and egg, and, and some types

94
00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:42.920
of plenary certainly do sexual reproduction, but I'm, I'm

95
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.399
referring to the ones that are asexual. So the

96
00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:47.760
asexual strains tear themselves in half and then they

97
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.350
regenerate. And so one consequence of that is that

98
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.649
uh Somatic mutations, mutations that occur in the body,

99
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.609
um, don't disappear into the for the next lineage,

100
00:04:58.619 --> 00:04:59.820
the way they do with us, right? If you

101
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.700
have a mutation, the children don't inherit the mutation

102
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.500
from your body. But in planaria, every mutation that

103
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.579
doesn't kill the stem cell moves forward and is

104
00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:10.540
in fact is amplified as the animal regenerates. So

105
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.459
for 400+ million years, they've been accumulating uh somatic

106
00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:17.179
mutations. They can be mixed upployed, meaning that their

107
00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:19.489
cells can have different numbers of chromosomes, their, their

108
00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:21.679
genes. ARE a mess somatically, they're, they're, they're very

109
00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:27.130
messy. And yet they are incredibly reliable regenerators. They

110
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.029
are highly cancer resistant and they are immortal. There,

111
00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:31.859
there appears to be no such thing as a,

112
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.890
as an old planaria in these um asexual strains.

113
00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:38.049
They don't age. Now, That seems very, very strange.

114
00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:39.950
You would, you would, uh, you would think from,

115
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.239
from, from the standard things you learn in biology

116
00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:44.440
that, that the genome is very important and that

117
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.959
the animal with the messiest genome would not in

118
00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:49.079
fact be the one that's the most regenerative cancer

119
00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:52.440
resistant and, uh, and, and, um, and immortal. And

120
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.440
yet, and yet here we are. So, so I,

121
00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:56.880
I think, uh, there's a very interesting story to

122
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.709
be told about planaria, and it has to do

123
00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:03.529
with the way that Uh, evolution produces problem solving

124
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.880
agents and what's happening, I think, in, in planaria

125
00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:09.970
is that because the material is so unreliable, the

126
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.290
hardware is more than most organisms. So because of

127
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.929
this mutation, uh, mutation accumulation and so on. Uh,

128
00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:19.140
WHAT, and, and we, and we've actually studied this,

129
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.179
this kind of, uh, this kind of feedback loop

130
00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:24.420
and computational studies. What happens is that when you

131
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.299
have a material like this, uh, evolution really spends

132
00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:30.179
a lot of its effort on creating a system

133
00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:33.045
that can get The job done, meaning can, can

134
00:06:33.045 --> 00:06:36.244
achieve specific goals in anatomical space and physiological space

135
00:06:36.244 --> 00:06:39.364
and so on, even under drastically changing circumstances when

136
00:06:39.364 --> 00:06:41.404
your own parts change, right? When your material is

137
00:06:41.404 --> 00:06:44.165
unreliable. And I think in Planary, that algorithm is

138
00:06:44.165 --> 00:06:45.924
so, is so good and it's, it, it had

139
00:06:45.924 --> 00:06:50.250
to be. That basically they're able to, uh, create

140
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.250
a, a normal plenary despite really a very wide

141
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.250
variety of, of, of fun of genetically specified hardware.

142
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.660
Now, 11 interesting, uh, uh, prediction, which is, which

143
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.660
is actually true, turns out to be true of

144
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.459
that, of that model is that it, it should

145
00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:08.750
be very hard to make transgenic planaria. And because,

146
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:12.140
because, because the, the basically the algorithm is, is

147
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.660
designed to ignore um errors in the, in the

148
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.339
genome and just do what it, what it does.

149
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.739
And in fact, that's true. Most other species, you

150
00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:21.220
can call a stock center and you can get

151
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.239
a fruit fly with curly wings or a mouse

152
00:07:23.239 --> 00:07:25.130
with a with a weird tail or weird coat

153
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.480
color or something. Uh, IN planaria, there are no

154
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.160
genetic strains. There are no genetic mutants. There, there

155
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.679
is, there, there, there is one type of unusual

156
00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:35.720
planaria strain that has two heads, and that's one

157
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.040
we made and it's not genetic. And, and, and

158
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.959
this is, you know, this is, um, uh, the,

159
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.880
the, the reason that the planaria, I think, are

160
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.709
so interesting is that they're teaching us something very

161
00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:49.359
profound about, uh, how, how evolution works and how

162
00:07:49.359 --> 00:07:52.350
that relates to the genetically specified hardware of life.

163
00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:56.970
And where does the morphology of different organisms come

164
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.299
from? What determines determines it?

165
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.910
Well, that's, that's an interesting, uh, question, because the

166
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.429
word, uh, comes from, uh, bears some, some analysis.

167
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.709
So what does it mean when outcomes come from

168
00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:13.910
something? Uh, I'll give you a simple, well, 2222

169
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.049
examples. And then, and then I'll, I'll answer about

170
00:08:16.049 --> 00:08:18.429
the biology. One example is, um, uh, I don't

171
00:08:18.429 --> 00:08:19.510
know if you've ever seen this thing called the

172
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.910
Galton board. It's basically, and you can buy a

173
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.089
toy of this on Amazon for $20. It's basically,

174
00:08:24.109 --> 00:08:26.029
just imagine a wooden board and you bang a

175
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:28.269
bunch of nails into it like this, right? And

176
00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:29.890
then you take a bucket of. AND you dump

177
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.420
it dump it on top and the marbles go

178
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.770
boom, boom boom, you know, they bounce off and

179
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.210
they land on the bottom. What what what how

180
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.890
do they land? Well, they land in a beautiful

181
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.409
bell curve. It's a very specific shape every single

182
00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:41.729
time. As long as you have enough marbles, you

183
00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:43.650
get a very beautiful distribution. You get a bell

184
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.289
curve. So you might ask that question, where does

185
00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:48.520
the bell curve, where does that come from? So,

186
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:52.010
if, if, if you're inclined to, uh, look at

187
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.729
the materials of the wood, of the nails, of

188
00:08:54.729 --> 00:08:56.729
the, you know, you're, you're not going to find

189
00:08:56.729 --> 00:08:58.770
it. It doesn't come from any of those things

190
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.010
in the sense of, uh, here is where the

191
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.809
plan is, is, is sort of written down and

192
00:09:02.809 --> 00:09:05.049
then, then there, you know, there it is. So

193
00:09:05.049 --> 00:09:07.250
there's something else, there's something else going on here.

194
00:09:07.669 --> 00:09:10.190
And another, another way to think about it too

195
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.330
is that if you, if you plot um something

196
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.309
called the Halley plot of a very simple formula,

197
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.030
let's say uh Z cubed plus 7 there, that's

198
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.070
just a few characters. There's your formula in complex

199
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.830
numbers, you can plot the Halley plot. You get

200
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.830
this incredibly Beautiful fractal structure. It looks very biological.

201
00:09:24.859 --> 00:09:26.950
It's very beautiful shape. Uh, NOW, now you asked

202
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.309
the question, where does that shape come from? What

203
00:09:29.309 --> 00:09:32.150
aspect of, of, of physics, of the environment, of,

204
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.109
of the past history explains where that shape comes

205
00:09:35.109 --> 00:09:36.630
from. It's none of those things, right? None, none

206
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.549
of those things control it. So, in terms of

207
00:09:38.549 --> 00:09:40.710
biological shape, I'm going to say there are 3

208
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.590
things that really go into it. One is, of

209
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.109
course, uh, the genetically provided hardware, which is basically

210
00:09:47.109 --> 00:09:49.320
what, uh, what the, what the genome provides every

211
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.830
cell with, which is a set of proteins that

212
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.840
the cells have to have. There is the, uh,

213
00:09:53.849 --> 00:09:57.270
the, the, the current environment, which is, uh, the,

214
00:09:57.289 --> 00:09:59.989
the, the situation that the cells find themselves in,

215
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.729
and within that situation, that hardware is usually pretty

216
00:10:02.729 --> 00:10:05.159
good at making something coherent happen. It may be

217
00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:07.510
the standard embryo, it may be one of several

218
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.515
um uh different. Shapes in terms of developmental plasticity.

219
00:10:10.645 --> 00:10:12.405
It might be a Xenabbot or an antherbot or

220
00:10:12.405 --> 00:10:15.924
something else, but, you know, something, something useful will

221
00:10:15.924 --> 00:10:18.724
happen. And the third very important thing that, that

222
00:10:18.724 --> 00:10:20.924
a lot of people don't talk about. So we've

223
00:10:20.924 --> 00:10:22.885
got, we've got the, the heredity, we've got the

224
00:10:22.885 --> 00:10:25.635
environment, and, and the third very important thing is

225
00:10:25.844 --> 00:10:29.719
the input from Uh, wherever it is that the

226
00:10:29.719 --> 00:10:32.159
law of mathematics come from. Some people call it

227
00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:34.320
the, you know, Platonic space or the space of

228
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.880
forms. We don't have a great vocabulary for it

229
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.039
yet, but it's, it's, it's really important. There's, there's

230
00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:44.229
very, uh, fundamentally, functionally important. Information that is not

231
00:10:44.229 --> 00:10:46.750
physical, it's not encoded by any uh aspects of

232
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.549
physics in our world. And, and nevertheless, it has

233
00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:53.049
a huge input into uh shape and behavior of,

234
00:10:53.109 --> 00:10:57.020
of living forms because evolution really exploits the information

235
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:57.989
in that space a lot.

236
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.760
So you're very interested in cognition. What is the

237
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.960
most basic level at, at which cognition arises?

238
00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:11.539
Well, uh, first of all, first of all, let's,

239
00:11:11.599 --> 00:11:16.239
let's try to define terms. So, uh, 11 thing

240
00:11:16.239 --> 00:11:18.520
that I'm very interested in is, is intelligence and

241
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.559
the definition that I use, and I'm not saying

242
00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:23.030
this is the only definition or the best definition,

243
00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:25.400
uh, or even a complete definition, but what I

244
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.549
focus on is problem solving. That doesn't include play

245
00:11:28.549 --> 00:11:30.919
and creativity and, and some other things, but, but

246
00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:35.880
let's, let's just talk about problem solving. So, what

247
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.840
I'm, what I'm interested in is uh first of

248
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.219
all, the origin of the kind of uh intelligence

249
00:11:42.219 --> 00:11:45.450
that that advanced systems have. Where does it come

250
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.559
from, right? Because we know, you, you and I

251
00:11:47.559 --> 00:11:49.630
were both single cells once, right? We were both

252
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.010
on the evolutionary scale and on the developmental scale.

253
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.309
We were in, uh, uh, a little unfertilized oy,

254
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.755
a little blob of chemical. Many people look at

255
00:11:57.755 --> 00:11:59.835
that and say, well, that's just the chemical physical

256
00:11:59.835 --> 00:12:02.794
system. There is no cognition there. And yet, slowly

257
00:12:02.794 --> 00:12:05.234
and gradually through the process of development, here we

258
00:12:05.234 --> 00:12:07.875
are. So, what we need to do is we,

259
00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:10.184
we need to understand how the properties of these,

260
00:12:10.205 --> 00:12:14.395
uh, physical chemical systems scale up to the kind

261
00:12:14.395 --> 00:12:16.515
of problem solving that is obvious for us to

262
00:12:16.515 --> 00:12:20.474
recognize. So we study in problem solving and different

263
00:12:20.474 --> 00:12:23.554
aspects of cognition, meaning memory and, uh, and, uh,

264
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.580
preferences and, and the goal directedness and so on.

265
00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:29.119
We study these things in a very wide range

266
00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:32.289
of model systems in very diverse spaces. So, in

267
00:12:32.289 --> 00:12:35.330
physiological states, based in, in, in the space of

268
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.080
anatomical um states. So we, we look at how

269
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.000
cells and multicellular tissue solve problems in 3. The

270
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.760
anatomical space and so on. Um, SO, so once

271
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.469
we, once we develop the tools to, uh, uh,

272
00:12:49.479 --> 00:12:53.159
detect and, and measure and, uh, quantify those kind

273
00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:56.280
of competencies in different spaces, right? Then, then we

274
00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.479
can really ask how far down does it go?

275
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.840
So what are the simplest, uh, versions of that?

276
00:13:00.919 --> 00:13:03.200
What are the lowest kind of, uh, uh, examples

277
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.400
of that. So, um, I, I, I think that

278
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.929
one of the things that You want to think

279
00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:12.429
about when you're, when you're um trying, trying to

280
00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:15.080
quantify these kinds of, uh, these kind of properties

281
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.770
is autonomy. So, as, and, and I take a

282
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.530
very engineering approach to this, you, you have an

283
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.250
autonomous subsystem based on what can you rely on

284
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.090
it to do when you're not there to micromanage

285
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.609
it. So, that might be a thermostat circuit, it

286
00:13:28.609 --> 00:13:32.169
might be, you know, something more complex. But everything

287
00:13:32.169 --> 00:13:34.049
is built up from, from pieces, and we need

288
00:13:34.049 --> 00:13:36.289
to understand how much autonomy do these pieces have

289
00:13:36.289 --> 00:13:40.890
to solve certain problems without being micromanaged. So, under,

290
00:13:40.929 --> 00:13:44.349
under that kind of definition, It, I, I think

291
00:13:44.349 --> 00:13:46.979
we can argue that at least in this universe,

292
00:13:47.309 --> 00:13:50.429
uh, the spectrum of agency goes all the way

293
00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:53.710
down to the, the, the smallest, uh um uh

294
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:56.380
the smallest particles because what it looks like there

295
00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:01.960
is least action laws. Basically, uh, The, um, the

296
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.200
simplest version of, of goal-directed activity, I think, are

297
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.369
the, are the least action principles. And as a,

298
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.679
as a very simple example, think about, um, uh,

299
00:14:10.799 --> 00:14:12.320
as a, as an engineer, think about building a

300
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.119
roller coaster. You have to do a lot of

301
00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.760
work to get the thing up the, up the

302
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.239
hill, right? But you don't have to do anything

303
00:14:18.239 --> 00:14:20.239
to get it back down the hill. Now, that's

304
00:14:20.239 --> 00:14:23.200
not super intelligent. It's not very intelligent, but it's

305
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.289
something. It's not zero. It is something that you

306
00:14:25.289 --> 00:14:27.510
can rely on the system to do. Without you

307
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.200
having to manage it. So the ability to to,

308
00:14:29.349 --> 00:14:32.989
to fall down gradients is the most primitive kind

309
00:14:32.989 --> 00:14:35.469
of intelligence there is. Obviously, we're interested in bigger,

310
00:14:35.789 --> 00:14:38.669
you know, more, more, more impressive systems, but, but

311
00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:41.150
just following gradients is already something. I think it's

312
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.320
on the spectrum and, and even particles do that.

313
00:14:43.659 --> 00:14:45.059
So I think it goes all the way down.

314
00:14:45.109 --> 00:14:46.590
But then you have, you know, the thing that

315
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.349
life is good at is scaling up those kinds

316
00:14:48.349 --> 00:14:51.429
of properties to show all kinds of more advanced

317
00:14:51.429 --> 00:14:54.630
things that people typically recognize. So following gradients in

318
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.619
a more clever way, delayed gratification, navigation, memory, pathfinding,

319
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.619
uh, uh, maybe eventually forward planning and, and, and,

320
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.030
you know, counterfactual thinking, all, all these things. All

321
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.349
of these things are on the same spectrum, and

322
00:15:06.349 --> 00:15:08.010
they go all the way down to the, to,

323
00:15:08.229 --> 00:15:10.219
to what we currently call inanimate matter.

324
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.940
So, you've mentioned the intelligence there. What is collective

325
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.260
intelligence and how does it apply in the context

326
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.700
of a living system?

327
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.070
Yeah, collective intelligence is basically the property of a

328
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.510
system to be able to solve problems in spaces

329
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.030
that uh are different from what it's parts to.

330
00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.580
So, um, so people typically study collective intelligence in,

331
00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:39.659
uh, colonies of ants and, and termites and, and

332
00:15:39.659 --> 00:15:43.039
bees and then flock bird flocks and actually robot

333
00:15:43.039 --> 00:15:46.000
swarms and, and things like that. But we are

334
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.630
all collective intelligences. You and I are also collective

335
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.039
intelligences because we are made of a collection of

336
00:15:51.039 --> 00:15:54.000
parts, uh, cells, which are by themselves quite competent.

337
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.929
But these cells are by themselves solving problems in

338
00:15:57.929 --> 00:16:01.200
physiological state space, in gene expression space, and so

339
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.020
on. And they, there is a, there are a

340
00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.039
set of uh uh policies which we can talk

341
00:16:06.039 --> 00:16:09.500
about, including bioelectrics and some other things that enable

342
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.820
these cells to come together in a way where

343
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.739
the collective that they make is able to solve

344
00:16:15.739 --> 00:16:18.020
problems in the new space that the parts don't

345
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.590
have access to. And so you can imagine during,

346
00:16:20.609 --> 00:16:24.049
during evolution that originally systems have to deal with

347
00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:26.580
um some kind of metabolic space, and then they

348
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.630
became more complex and they, and they could operate

349
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.000
it. Physiological space and the genes came along and

350
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.559
they could operate in transcriptional space. And then multicellularity

351
00:16:34.559 --> 00:16:37.119
came along, and now the whole thing can, can

352
00:16:37.119 --> 00:16:39.969
operate in anatomical space. Now, when you have a

353
00:16:39.969 --> 00:16:43.039
salamander and it loses a limb, those cells will

354
00:16:43.039 --> 00:16:45.520
very quickly rebuild the correct limb and then they

355
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.710
stop. OK. Uh, SO, so that's, that's, that's an

356
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.200
error minimization scheme. They're able to Find again that

357
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.280
correct uh location in the anatomical space when they're

358
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.840
deviated from it by some kind of injury, and

359
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.280
no individual cell in that collective knows what a

360
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.049
finger is or how many fingers it's supposed to

361
00:17:02.049 --> 00:17:04.358
have, but the collective absolutely knows. And you know

362
00:17:04.358 --> 00:17:06.189
that it knows because if you, if you, if

363
00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:07.880
you cut off the, you know, some number of

364
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.280
fingers, it will build back exactly what's needed, and

365
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.118
then it stops. It stops when it reaches the

366
00:17:12.118 --> 00:17:14.479
goal. So the individual parts don't have that, but

367
00:17:14.479 --> 00:17:17.368
the collective does. And then Eventually, uh, nerve and

368
00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:19.010
muscle came on the scene and then, and then

369
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.489
we could pursue what uh behavioral goals, right? So

370
00:17:21.489 --> 00:17:23.829
moving around in three dimensional space to create behavioral

371
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.770
goals. And now we have linguistic paths through the

372
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.329
linguistic space that that humans can take and, and,

373
00:17:29.369 --> 00:17:30.810
and many other kinds of goals that we can

374
00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:35.199
do. So, Uh, collective intelligence is, is, is simply

375
00:17:35.199 --> 00:17:38.510
this, it's the ability to bind competent subunits together

376
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.670
in a way that the group is able to

377
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.560
solve new problems in a new space.

378
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:47.000
And how does collective intelligence play out in the

379
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.479
morphogenesis of multicellular organisms?

380
00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.130
Well, yeah, that's that one of the, one of

381
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.829
the most interesting kinds of collective intelligence that we

382
00:17:56.829 --> 00:18:00.750
see is problem solving in anatomical space. So, you

383
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.310
have, uh, a bunch of cells, the cells themselves

384
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.869
are able to do all sorts of things, as

385
00:18:04.869 --> 00:18:07.109
we can see from amoebas and from various other

386
00:18:07.109 --> 00:18:13.739
kinds of cells, but together, they're actually, um, Able

387
00:18:13.739 --> 00:18:16.219
to, to solve problems in, in a, in a

388
00:18:16.219 --> 00:18:17.979
very different space, which is the space of three

389
00:18:17.979 --> 00:18:20.900
dimensional shapes. So let me describe, um, let me

390
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.550
describe uh what some of those problems are. So,

391
00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.300
so first of all, we can just start right

392
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.420
with embryonic development, uh, many kinds of embryos, if

393
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.969
you cut them into pieces. You don't get half

394
00:18:32.969 --> 00:18:36.469
bodies, you get perfectly normal monozygotic twins and triplets

395
00:18:36.469 --> 00:18:38.660
and so on. So, so even, even this is

396
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.599
regulative development and even when certain parts are, are

397
00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:44.599
damaged, the system can recognize that that's happened, uh,

398
00:18:44.739 --> 00:18:47.099
make up what it do, take, take steps that

399
00:18:47.099 --> 00:18:48.300
it needs to do and get to where it's

400
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.829
going. Another kind of example is Um, in the,

401
00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:54.670
in the frog tadpole that has to rearrange its

402
00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.140
cranio facial organs to go from tadpole to frog.

403
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.630
If you, you might think that this is a

404
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:03.630
hardwired kind of process where every particular, uh, organ

405
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.349
in the face just moves in the right direction,

406
00:19:05.369 --> 00:19:06.989
the right amount, and then you get a normal

407
00:19:06.989 --> 00:19:09.150
frog. But actually, it turns out that's not true.

408
00:19:09.229 --> 00:19:12.430
What we discovered when we, uh, randomized the position

409
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.270
of the organs, right? So, so the eyes on

410
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.510
the back of the head, the mouth is off

411
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.589
to the side, just scramble everything, you still get

412
00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:19.410
a normal frog. And the reason you get a

413
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.209
normal frog is that these things are not following

414
00:19:21.209 --> 00:19:25.359
predetermined paths. They're trying to minimize error from a,

415
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.969
a configuration that they remember, not the individual cells,

416
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.969
but the collective. And And they will continue to

417
00:19:30.969 --> 00:19:33.050
move and rearrange and deform and whatever until they

418
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.130
get to this, to this pattern. So all of,

419
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.010
all, and there are many, many other examples that

420
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.689
we could talk about, but all of these are

421
00:19:38.689 --> 00:19:42.920
examples of, uh, specific problem solving, including use of,

422
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.810
uh, you know, I could tell you examples where

423
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:49.530
they use, uh, different molecular, um, tools that they

424
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.410
have in their toolkit to solve a problem when

425
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:55.229
things really radically change. And that creative, creative reuse

426
00:19:55.229 --> 00:19:57.010
of the hardware you have, I mean, that's basically

427
00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.209
intelligence. And it's, and, and so the ability to

428
00:20:00.219 --> 00:20:02.339
remember our goal, work hard to get to that

429
00:20:02.339 --> 00:20:05.500
goal, despite changing circumstances, and creatively use the tools

430
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.660
you have to try to get there even in

431
00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.959
cases of, uh, where you've not seen this problem

432
00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:13.689
before. Those are all intelligences, uh, kinds of intelligence,

433
00:20:13.819 --> 00:20:17.050
I should say, and, um, It's a collective intelligence

434
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.729
because it's being carried out by a swarm of

435
00:20:18.729 --> 00:20:22.290
cells that they're all committed to the same uh

436
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.130
traversal of that problem space towards the same goal.

437
00:20:26.579 --> 00:20:29.719
So in your work, when it comes to development,

438
00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:34.079
I read about the concept of multi-scale competency. Could

439
00:20:34.079 --> 00:20:34.959
you explain it?

440
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.849
Yeah, this is, this is, uh, what I mean

441
00:20:38.849 --> 00:20:42.530
by that is that every level of organization has

442
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.219
its own ability to solve problems in different spaces.

443
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.920
So, for example, one talk that I give sometimes

444
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.250
is, is called Why Robots Don't Get Cancer. And

445
00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.359
the reason current robots don't get cancer is because

446
00:20:56.359 --> 00:20:59.010
the collective, the, the, the final thing, the robot

447
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.209
itself might be intelligent and it might be solving

448
00:21:01.209 --> 00:21:03.569
certain problems, but it's typically made of dumb parts.

449
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:06.709
The parts themselves don't have an agenda. Um, IN,

450
00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:09.359
in, in, uh, living forms, that's not the case.

451
00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.160
We're made of an agential material where every part

452
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.655
and every scale has its own. Um, SET of

453
00:21:15.655 --> 00:21:17.655
goals and preferences and agendas that it's trying to

454
00:21:17.655 --> 00:21:20.614
meet. So the molecular networks themselves have a kind

455
00:21:20.614 --> 00:21:23.135
of learning and memory and goal directedness that they're

456
00:21:23.135 --> 00:21:25.895
able to do. The cells can, can solve problems

457
00:21:25.895 --> 00:21:28.444
in various spaces, the tissues, the organs, the whole

458
00:21:28.444 --> 00:21:30.694
organism, and then, of course, swarms and groups and

459
00:21:30.694 --> 00:21:32.805
so on. So at every, at every level of

460
00:21:32.805 --> 00:21:36.469
organization, you don't have uh purely um Uh, passive,

461
00:21:36.689 --> 00:21:39.790
passive materials, you have, you have, uh, any genial

462
00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.829
material that has all these amazing competencies that can

463
00:21:42.829 --> 00:21:45.750
be taken advantage of by the higher levels of

464
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.869
organization. And, and, and it is. That's what, that's,

465
00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:51.060
that's, that's a key principle of life. And, uh,

466
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.270
that's, that's, that's the multi-scale competency architecture. I think

467
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.780
we're built of an architecture where every every level

468
00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.550
is competent in certain cases.

469
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:04.099
And how do cells, tissues and organs adjust to

470
00:22:04.099 --> 00:22:09.500
perturbations such as external injury or internal modifications and

471
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.099
still accomplish adaptive tasks?

472
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.890
Yeah, I mean, that's, that's uh a a a

473
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:19.770
huge question. It's really critical for understanding evolution, development,

474
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:25.170
for developing regenerative medicine, um. You know, there, there's,

475
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.089
there's a few interests. I'll, I'll just, I, I'll

476
00:22:27.089 --> 00:22:30.170
give a few interesting examples. Um, AND, and, and,

477
00:22:30.199 --> 00:22:32.130
and we're starting to understand some of that because,

478
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.369
because what you need to do in order to

479
00:22:34.369 --> 00:22:36.849
understand that is to identify what I call the

480
00:22:36.849 --> 00:22:39.890
cognitive glue, that is the mechanisms that bind individual

481
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.449
cells together towards common purpose. And we've now started

482
00:22:42.449 --> 00:22:44.930
to identify some of those and bioelectrics is, is,

483
00:22:44.939 --> 00:22:46.369
of course, one of them, but, but there's a

484
00:22:46.369 --> 00:22:49.729
few others, uh, including stress sharing and, and memory

485
00:22:49.729 --> 00:22:53.880
anonymization and so on. So, Uh, so, so, so,

486
00:22:53.979 --> 00:22:57.270
so here's a, here's a few examples, um. Uh,

487
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.000
IN, in the, in the newt, there's a, there's

488
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.810
a little tube that goes to the kidney, OK,

489
00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:03.760
this little kidney tubule. And if you take a

490
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.339
cross section of a normal kidney tubule, what you'll

491
00:23:06.339 --> 00:23:09.119
see is 8 to 10 cells making a, you

492
00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:10.770
know, making a little circle, right? That's the cross

493
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.189
section, and, and now you get your tube. So,

494
00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:14.800
one thing you can do is you can make

495
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.729
these polyploid nodes, which have Uh, extra copies of

496
00:23:18.729 --> 00:23:20.810
their, of their genetic material, right? So instead of

497
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:23.290
2nnus, you can make 4 and 5 and 6,

498
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.530
and so on. When you do that, first thing

499
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.369
that happens is the cells get larger to accommodate

500
00:23:28.369 --> 00:23:31.050
additional genetic material. So the cell size adapts to

501
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.209
the amount of DNA. The second thing you notice

502
00:23:33.209 --> 00:23:34.959
is that you still get a perfectly good nut.

503
00:23:35.089 --> 00:23:36.900
So that's interesting. It kind of doesn't matter how

504
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.810
many copies of your genetic material you have, you

505
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.890
can still make it, make a good nut. The

506
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.170
third thing that happens is you notice that because

507
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.260
the cells are bigger, But the node is exactly

508
00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.219
the same size. So when you take a cross

509
00:23:48.219 --> 00:23:50.660
section, you see how that works. Fewer cells are

510
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.619
now making up that same tubule. So now it's

511
00:23:52.619 --> 00:23:56.020
adjusted to the size of the, uh, to the,

512
00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.099
to the, uh, to the new size of the

513
00:23:58.099 --> 00:24:00.660
cells, not just the, right? And so, and then,

514
00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:02.954
and then the The most amazing thing is that

515
00:24:02.954 --> 00:24:04.474
if you make them, if you make the cells

516
00:24:04.474 --> 00:24:08.275
truly gigantic, uh, just one cell will wrap around

517
00:24:08.275 --> 00:24:10.074
itself and leave a hole in the middle and

518
00:24:10.074 --> 00:24:11.994
give you that same tubule. Now, in that case,

519
00:24:12.035 --> 00:24:15.074
that's a completely different molecular mechanism, that's cytoskeletal bending.

520
00:24:15.084 --> 00:24:16.645
The others were some kind of cell to cell

521
00:24:16.645 --> 00:24:20.020
communication. So what you see here, is exactly the

522
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.260
sort of problem solving that I was talking about

523
00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.569
where if you're a nude coming into this world,

524
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.219
what can you count on? Well, you know your

525
00:24:27.219 --> 00:24:28.859
environment is going to change, but you also can't

526
00:24:28.859 --> 00:24:30.859
even count on your own parts. You don't know

527
00:24:30.859 --> 00:24:32.459
how many copies of your genome you're going to

528
00:24:32.459 --> 00:24:34.630
have. You don't know what size or how many

529
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:36.300
cells you're going to have. You have to use

530
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.619
whatever tools you have, in particular, all of these

531
00:24:38.619 --> 00:24:40.989
molecular cascades that that have to do with the

532
00:24:40.989 --> 00:24:43.500
cytoskeletal bending and cell to cell communication and so

533
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.579
on. You have to use them as best as

534
00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:48.160
you can. To complete your journey in anatomical space.

535
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.949
And you have to do this on the fly.

536
00:24:50.209 --> 00:24:52.609
So, so it isn't like you can, you can

537
00:24:52.609 --> 00:24:55.290
do a bunch of computations and then those computations

538
00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.650
impact some other system. You have to do all

539
00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.560
those computations while you are changing your own architecture.

540
00:25:00.689 --> 00:25:03.770
Yeah. And the same, the same thing happens. In,

541
00:25:03.849 --> 00:25:08.040
um, for example, the butterfly caterpillar, uh, transition, where,

542
00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:10.890
where when you have a caterpillar, and it, in

543
00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:13.209
order to become a butterfly, it basically dissolves most

544
00:25:13.209 --> 00:25:15.010
of its brain and then rebuilds a new brain

545
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.319
that's, um, that's, that's much more suitable for, uh,

546
00:25:18.609 --> 00:25:22.209
for living in a three-dimensional world. Um, IT'S been

547
00:25:22.209 --> 00:25:24.209
shown that some of the memories of the caterpillar

548
00:25:24.209 --> 00:25:26.729
actually remain and, and, and, and are actually, they,

549
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.170
they don't just remain, actually remapped into the kind

550
00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.849
of memories that are useful to a butterfly, which

551
00:25:30.849 --> 00:25:33.459
are quite different. So again, you have the scenario

552
00:25:33.459 --> 00:25:35.540
where you not only have to stay alive, but

553
00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.180
you also have to manage your own transformation while

554
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.849
doing the, the relevant computations and holding on to

555
00:25:41.849 --> 00:25:45.250
information and remapping that information onto the new substrate.

556
00:25:45.579 --> 00:25:48.900
So, so all of these transformational processes are very

557
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.619
much, um, recurrent. They're very much, uh, kind of

558
00:25:52.619 --> 00:25:55.780
self, self-referential. It's a, it's a, it's basically a

559
00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.660
machine that changes itself on the fly because it

560
00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.189
is a problem solving agent from, from the very

561
00:26:01.189 --> 00:26:01.380
beginning.

562
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.790
Mhm. So tell us now, to get into the

563
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.069
topic of sentience, uh, tell us now about your

564
00:26:08.069 --> 00:26:13.170
theme or technological approach to mind everywhere framework to

565
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.739
understanding bodies, minds, and intelligences.

566
00:26:17.209 --> 00:26:20.790
Yeah, um, so, so what I'm interested in is

567
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.839
developing ways to think about all different kinds of

568
00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:28.040
agents, regardless of their composition or how they got

569
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.150
here. In other words, I want to be able

570
00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:34.319
to ask, uh, in particular, what is, what is

571
00:26:34.319 --> 00:26:37.520
common to all agents, be they evolved biologicals, like

572
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.829
the familiar animals, or maybe some weird animals like,

573
00:26:40.839 --> 00:26:44.114
like, uh, Um, swarms and things like that, but

574
00:26:44.114 --> 00:26:48.765
also synthetic, uh, synthetic living beings, biobots, um, hybrids

575
00:26:48.765 --> 00:26:53.155
and cyborgs, and, uh, uh, embodied robotics and AI

576
00:26:53.155 --> 00:26:56.594
software agents, someday maybe exobiological, alien life, all of

577
00:26:56.594 --> 00:26:58.515
it. I want to understand what all of these

578
00:26:58.515 --> 00:27:02.234
things have in common. And in particular, this framework

579
00:27:02.234 --> 00:27:06.040
is uh designed to, to do that and Uh,

580
00:27:06.079 --> 00:27:08.239
to do it in a very, uh, practical way.

581
00:27:08.319 --> 00:27:10.280
That is, I'm not just interested in philosophy. I

582
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.599
don't want to, um, have debates about the word

583
00:27:13.599 --> 00:27:16.079
usage and try to prop up ancient categories of

584
00:27:16.079 --> 00:27:18.430
what life is, what machines are, what robots are.

585
00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:21.229
I think the, the, the useful thing for us

586
00:27:21.229 --> 00:27:24.380
to do now. IS to, uh, assume that all

587
00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:28.130
of those kinds of claims about sentience, about intelligence,

588
00:27:28.339 --> 00:27:31.099
about cognition, all of those claims are basically just

589
00:27:31.099 --> 00:27:34.699
interaction protocols, meaning, meaning I want to operationalize all

590
00:27:34.699 --> 00:27:37.300
of these things and say that those terms are

591
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.459
useful to the extent that they help me interact

592
00:27:39.459 --> 00:27:41.364
with the system. So that That means if I

593
00:27:41.364 --> 00:27:44.885
want to understand the collective intelligence of cells, I

594
00:27:44.885 --> 00:27:46.925
may have models of what kind of intelligence they

595
00:27:46.925 --> 00:27:49.364
have, and those models have to help me get

596
00:27:49.364 --> 00:27:51.765
to new therapeutics. They have to make new predictions.

597
00:27:51.844 --> 00:27:54.655
They have to unlock new, uh, capabilities that we

598
00:27:54.655 --> 00:27:57.484
didn't have. Otherwise, otherwise it's useless. So, so that,

599
00:27:57.604 --> 00:28:00.209
so, so the goal of the framework is To

600
00:28:00.209 --> 00:28:04.349
help us to recognize, to, uh, control or collaborate

601
00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:07.599
with very unusual diverse intelligences that I think are

602
00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:09.319
all around us, and, and we just, we're not

603
00:28:09.319 --> 00:28:11.520
very good at recognizing them and do it in

604
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.079
a way that enables us to have more fruitful,

605
00:28:14.199 --> 00:28:16.699
more ethical interactions with them. So this means biomedicine

606
00:28:16.699 --> 00:28:19.680
and has certain environmental implications and so on. And

607
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.079
so, and so this, this framework has a number

608
00:28:22.079 --> 00:28:26.239
of pillars. One is that, uh, We need to

609
00:28:26.239 --> 00:28:30.680
think beyond ancient categories, uh, that were OK in

610
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.839
sort of pre-scientific times, but are really not supported

611
00:28:33.839 --> 00:28:37.119
by, by discoveries of evolution of developmental biology of

612
00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:39.199
bioengineering. I think a lot of these categories are

613
00:28:39.199 --> 00:28:42.040
no good, and we need to develop new, um,

614
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.000
new, new, new frameworks for asking what kind of

615
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.319
relationship can you have with a specific system? What

616
00:28:47.319 --> 00:28:49.689
does it do? Does it learn? Does it have

617
00:28:49.689 --> 00:28:52.680
goals, how much, uh, what kind of, uh, problem

618
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.489
solving it can do, and so on. Um. Uh,

619
00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.209
THERE are also, there are also some other components

620
00:28:57.209 --> 00:28:59.959
such as polycomputing, which is the, uh, the idea

621
00:28:59.959 --> 00:29:02.810
that, that everything is, is described from the perspective

622
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:06.010
of some observer and that multiple observers can be

623
00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:08.969
interpreting the same physical events as very different computations.

624
00:29:09.079 --> 00:29:11.329
So everything is observer relative. I think that's important.

625
00:29:11.709 --> 00:29:14.250
Um, AND, uh, you know, there's, there's some other

626
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.290
components such as being able to use the framework

627
00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.020
of the cognitively cone for any given system to

628
00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.410
be able to say what are the, what are

629
00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:23.770
the scale and, uh, in both in space and

630
00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.199
time of the largest goal that it can pursue,

631
00:29:26.569 --> 00:29:28.250
right? So, so what, what is, what is the

632
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.130
system concerned about? What are the, what are the

633
00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.609
goals that it's actively trying to manage? And I

634
00:29:32.609 --> 00:29:35.410
think those are ways that we can, we can

635
00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.729
start to think about very, very diverse, uh, agential

636
00:29:38.729 --> 00:29:39.209
systems.

637
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.880
But when it comes to sentience specifically, how can

638
00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.989
we infer it in other organisms including animals and

639
00:29:47.989 --> 00:29:50.359
possibly also plants?

640
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.550
What, what do you mean by sentience exactly?

641
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.810
Uh, I, I mean, let me ask you, by

642
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.859
the way, what, what is sentience?

643
00:29:58.609 --> 00:30:00.729
Well, I, I don't use that word much. I

644
00:30:00.729 --> 00:30:02.800
don't know really exactly what it means. I mean,

645
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:05.810
part, part of the issue is that we often

646
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.650
use a lot of terminology that is not clear

647
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.410
to me what, um, practical, practical use it has.

648
00:30:11.449 --> 00:30:12.920
So, so I'm not sure, I'm not sure what

649
00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.599
we can do with, with sentience. I think that,

650
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.609
uh, in general, this, this notion of a system

651
00:30:18.609 --> 00:30:23.660
that is, uh, functionally. Navigating some kind of environment

652
00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.119
to meet goals that it has preferences towards and

653
00:30:26.119 --> 00:30:29.170
away from, from certain goals that is able to

654
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:33.500
solve problems that represents the environment in a, uh,

655
00:30:33.579 --> 00:30:35.619
in a compact, uh, kind of way, the way

656
00:30:35.619 --> 00:30:37.719
that we do when we make models. That, that's,

657
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.780
that, that's what I'm interested in. And in various

658
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.665
spaces, uh, that's a very functional. Um, THAT'S a

659
00:30:44.665 --> 00:30:46.744
very functional kind of thing which you can test

660
00:30:46.744 --> 00:30:48.694
with, with experiments. And the way you do it

661
00:30:48.694 --> 00:30:50.864
both in, in animals and plants, and in lots

662
00:30:50.864 --> 00:30:53.625
of very, I mean we study very minimal systems

663
00:30:53.625 --> 00:30:56.464
that are, that are far, quote unquote below plants

664
00:30:56.464 --> 00:30:58.944
in the standard scheme of things, that also have

665
00:30:58.944 --> 00:31:02.305
these properties, you know, uh, the very simple systems

666
00:31:02.305 --> 00:31:03.744
can have some of these properties, and the way

667
00:31:03.744 --> 00:31:05.905
you do it is with experiments. So that means

668
00:31:05.905 --> 00:31:09.609
that You specify some kind of problem space as

669
00:31:09.609 --> 00:31:12.989
you hypothesize a problem space, you hypothesize what goal

670
00:31:12.989 --> 00:31:16.859
it has, you hypothesize what. Uh, COMPETENCY, it has

671
00:31:16.859 --> 00:31:18.780
to reach those goals, and then you do functional

672
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.979
experiments to test those hypotheses, meaning you put barriers

673
00:31:21.979 --> 00:31:25.609
between it and its goal, or you, um, uh,

674
00:31:25.619 --> 00:31:28.060
just disrupt various things and see, and see what

675
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.300
in fact competencies it has to reach, to reach

676
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:35.900
those goals. And that's, that's an experimental, uh, platform

677
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.780
with which we can get good objective answers to

678
00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.660
these questions, because if you have different hypotheses about

679
00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.400
what the system is or different degrees of, um,

680
00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.000
if you, if you want to Attribute to a

681
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.400
different degrees of, of cognition than I do, we

682
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.119
can both do experiments and show what does, what

683
00:31:52.119 --> 00:31:53.910
does each of our models allow us to do.

684
00:31:54.119 --> 00:31:55.680
And so this is something that, for example, we

685
00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.959
do in regenerative medicine. A lot of people will

686
00:31:58.959 --> 00:32:02.859
automatically assume that that cells and tissues have zero

687
00:32:02.859 --> 00:32:06.469
or very low, uh, kinds of, uh, cognitive capacities,

688
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.229
and that has certain implications. It means that you,

689
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.119
you know, that therapeutics must operate bottom up on

690
00:32:12.119 --> 00:32:15.500
the molecular hardware and very specific techniques. We have

691
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.339
a different approach where, where we've hypothesized that actually

692
00:32:18.339 --> 00:32:20.270
the systems could do these other things, for example,

693
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:22.819
have certain kinds of memory, uh, uh, certain kinds

694
00:32:22.819 --> 00:32:24.859
of preferences, and so on. And that enables us

695
00:32:24.859 --> 00:32:26.859
to use very different set of tools from, uh,

696
00:32:26.939 --> 00:32:29.739
from behavioral science and from cognitive neuroscience. And by

697
00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:31.739
using those tools, we've shown that, hey, look, we

698
00:32:31.739 --> 00:32:33.810
can get to new capabilities that you couldn't get

699
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.140
to with the, with the original framework. So that's

700
00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.939
it. It's, it's an objective, uh, standard scientific way

701
00:32:39.939 --> 00:32:42.420
to judge the quality of the different, uh, sets

702
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.829
of tools that, that we use. Now, That does

703
00:32:45.829 --> 00:32:49.300
not address quote unquote, the hard problem of consciousness.

704
00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:52.140
That is what I'm talking about is publicly observable

705
00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.400
behavior. And so, if that's what you mean by

706
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.750
sentience, then it's, then it's, then, then we know

707
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.430
how to do it. We do, we do experiments

708
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:02.459
and, and we see uh what kind of Models

709
00:33:02.459 --> 00:33:05.089
of, of representation of memory of decision making are

710
00:33:05.089 --> 00:33:07.770
actually useful in, in research and then, and then

711
00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.930
we all find out um how, how you know

712
00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.329
about the first, the first person experience of these

713
00:33:12.329 --> 00:33:14.170
systems, that's a completely different question and that's a

714
00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:15.160
much harder question.

715
00:33:16.359 --> 00:33:19.150
Uh, CAN AI have a mind?

716
00:33:20.939 --> 00:33:23.140
Well, like Turing said, you need to, uh, you

717
00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.790
need to define all the terms here. You need

718
00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:26.780
to define AI, you need to define mind, and

719
00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:29.640
you probably need to define can. Uh, I, I'll

720
00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.369
I'll, I'll, I'll say a few things about it.

721
00:33:31.699 --> 00:33:34.619
First of all, let's be clear that none of

722
00:33:34.619 --> 00:33:38.180
this is about today's AI, right? So, so I'm,

723
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:41.140
I'm thinking much more, much more broadly about various,

724
00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:44.339
um. Official beings that that all either already exist

725
00:33:44.339 --> 00:33:46.979
or are soon going to exist, which include not

726
00:33:46.979 --> 00:33:51.290
only embodied robotics, but also various hybrids and and

727
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:56.219
and combinations of living tissue with engineered artifacts and

728
00:33:56.219 --> 00:33:58.699
software. So if you, you know, we are, we

729
00:33:58.699 --> 00:34:01.020
already do and we will much more so have

730
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:04.920
various cyborgs. YOU know, humans walking around that are

731
00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.520
maybe, you know, 80% human, 20%, uh, some, you

732
00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.520
know, some other kind of engineered implant or vice

733
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.399
versa. And what I really don't like are these

734
00:34:13.399 --> 00:34:15.739
binary framings, you know, can it or can't it?

735
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.478
Because what you're soon going to be in a

736
00:34:18.478 --> 00:34:20.918
position of is, is trying to, when, you know,

737
00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:23.300
when confronted by somebody that says, yes, you know,

738
00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:25.629
about 50% human and the rest of me is,

739
00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:28.060
is engineered. You, you don't want to be in

740
00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.300
a position of trying to say, well, is it

741
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.659
51% or 49%, because that's how we're going to

742
00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:33.360
decide if you're, you know, if you're, if you're

743
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.340
an AI or a human. I mean, this, this

744
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.208
is a, you know, it's a pseudo problem that's,

745
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.040
that's, that's never going to be useful. So, um,

746
00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.978
what I think is that I see absolutely no

747
00:34:43.978 --> 00:34:48.199
reason why the random vagaries of evolution should have

748
00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:51.000
a monopoly on making minds. We, we, we know

749
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.929
that, that, that over billions of years, the cosmic

750
00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:56.760
rays and various other things that, uh, that affect,

751
00:34:56.770 --> 00:35:00.810
um, the materials of life have enabled intelligence and,

752
00:35:00.889 --> 00:35:04.340
and the first person. Experience to, uh, to project

753
00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:07.620
into the physical world. Why should that be the

754
00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:09.979
only way it happens? Why, why can't the same

755
00:35:09.979 --> 00:35:14.199
process occur when the body is, is, is built

756
00:35:14.199 --> 00:35:16.699
not by random chance and selection, but actually by

757
00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:20.100
the forethought of, of intelligent engineers? I see, I

758
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.780
see no reason why, why evolution should have a

759
00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.110
monopoly on this. So to the extent that You

760
00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:27.629
believe that living things made of, made of chemicals,

761
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:30.909
uh, do, do in fact have mines, then some

762
00:35:30.909 --> 00:35:33.580
combination of those things with technology, or in fact,

763
00:35:33.669 --> 00:35:37.149
just purely technological bodies that were carefully designed by

764
00:35:37.149 --> 00:35:40.830
intelligent engineers, not by stray random cosmic rays, should

765
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:44.030
have at least that level of, uh, of capability.

766
00:35:44.379 --> 00:35:47.370
So some, so, so, so some kinds of artificial

767
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.909
beings, I think absolutely will have minds. I'm not

768
00:35:49.909 --> 00:35:52.350
making any claims about today's AI such as language

769
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.709
models and whatnot, but, um, I, I don't, I

770
00:35:54.709 --> 00:35:57.709
don't think there is any useful category, uh, that

771
00:35:57.709 --> 00:35:59.790
we can say does not have a mind purely

772
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.870
because it is in some sense artificial, that, that,

773
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.350
uh, you know, I don't think that exists.

774
00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:09.290
So changing topics now, what is regenerative medicine?

775
00:36:10.389 --> 00:36:14.050
Well, broadly speaking, regenerative medicine is the idea that.

776
00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:19.949
We could be, uh, activating fundamental repair processes in

777
00:36:19.949 --> 00:36:23.270
the body to, to, to have definitive solutions to

778
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:27.149
things like birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, that,

779
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:29.899
that we're not simply providing some kind of a,

780
00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:34.310
uh, uh, uh, a therapeutic that targets symptoms, but

781
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:37.070
actually restoring the tissue to, to a new and

782
00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:40.790
healthy state. So permanent definitive solutions to, uh, problems

783
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:41.659
of embodiment.

784
00:36:43.209 --> 00:36:46.489
And OK, so how can we apply, we talked

785
00:36:46.489 --> 00:36:51.560
about collective intelligence earlier, particularly in living systems. How

786
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.639
can we apply knowledge about it to the development

787
00:36:55.639 --> 00:36:56.969
of a new medicine?

788
00:36:58.449 --> 00:37:01.689
Yeah, uh, well, the first thing to realize is

789
00:37:01.689 --> 00:37:06.010
that if we had the ability to control what

790
00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.969
it is that cells build, right? If we have

791
00:37:07.969 --> 00:37:10.479
the ability to tell them exactly what to build,

792
00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:15.889
we would immediately have the answer to, to birth

793
00:37:15.889 --> 00:37:19.330
defects, to, uh, to injury, to degenerative disease, to

794
00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:21.209
aging, to cancer. All, all of those things would

795
00:37:21.209 --> 00:37:23.729
be solved if we could, uh, tell cells what

796
00:37:23.729 --> 00:37:26.989
to build. Now, One way to think about it,

797
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.879
which is, which is kind of the mainstream approach

798
00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:32.010
is that we should focus on the molecular hardware.

799
00:37:32.159 --> 00:37:35.360
So this is genomic editing, pathway engineering, you know,

800
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.239
pathway rewiring, protein engineering, all those things. And, and

801
00:37:38.239 --> 00:37:40.520
that that's how we're going to do it. That's,

802
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.760
that's one approach. I, I, I don't think that's

803
00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.270
the best approach. Uh, THE other approach is to

804
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:47.800
realize that the, the process by which the cells

805
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.270
build and repair those structures in the first place

806
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:52.520
is a kind of behavior. It's the behavior of

807
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.439
the collective intelligence of cells, and therefore, we should

808
00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:57.840
be able to use some very powerful tools from

809
00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.479
behavioral science, from cognitive neuroscience, and so on, to

810
00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:05.219
manipulate the behavior of that creature to basically communicate

811
00:38:05.219 --> 00:38:07.320
and collaborate with it, not try to micromanage it

812
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.629
bottom up. So, our approach to regenerative medicine and,

813
00:38:10.669 --> 00:38:13.229
and we've had now useful applications in, in, in

814
00:38:13.229 --> 00:38:15.909
birth defects in er in limb regeneration and cancer

815
00:38:15.909 --> 00:38:19.790
and so on, is to uh figure out uh

816
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:24.320
what the interfaces for, for communicating new goals to

817
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:28.330
the cellular collective. Uh, AND then re-specifying those goals.

818
00:38:28.449 --> 00:38:31.209
So not trying to clamp uh specific chemical states,

819
00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:34.679
uh, to deal with symptoms, but actually to re-specify,

820
00:38:34.929 --> 00:38:37.270
uh, new goal states having to do with healthy,

821
00:38:37.409 --> 00:38:40.010
uh, structure and function, and then facilitate the cells

822
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:44.310
to move towards those, those goal states and Um,

823
00:38:44.649 --> 00:38:47.030
to, to do it in a way that, uh,

824
00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.760
takes full advantage of the fact that these are

825
00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.000
not, um, uh kind of uh passive systems that

826
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.949
have to be micromanaged every step of the way,

827
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.360
but in fact, have representations of their goals that

828
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.290
we can access. And so discovering how those goals

829
00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:04.649
are, are encoded, which we have started to do,

830
00:39:04.969 --> 00:39:07.649
and re-specify those goals as a kind of communication

831
00:39:07.649 --> 00:39:10.330
process with the cells, not, not a, not a

832
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:13.889
micromanagement process. So that's, that, that's a different approach

833
00:39:13.889 --> 00:39:14.889
to regenerative medicine.

834
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.689
So you mentioned cancer there very briefly. How would

835
00:39:19.689 --> 00:39:22.899
this knowledge apply to cancer, not only when it

836
00:39:22.899 --> 00:39:26.570
comes to understanding it, but also potentially treating it?

837
00:39:27.459 --> 00:39:29.969
Yeah. So, so cancer, of course, is, is a

838
00:39:29.969 --> 00:39:33.850
very multifaceted and complex disease, but, but I, I'll,

839
00:39:33.929 --> 00:39:36.310
I'll, I'll boil it down to the kind of,

840
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.570
uh, piece of this that we study. 11 way

841
00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:43.370
to understand cancer as basically in a dissociative identity

842
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:46.570
disorder of the collective intelligence. So, normally, what you

843
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.850
have in morphogenesis is a large number of cells

844
00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.020
that have all bought into the same. A vision

845
00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.629
of where they're going in anatomical space. They're maintaining

846
00:39:55.629 --> 00:39:58.030
or building a nice organ, a healthy, you know,

847
00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.469
uh, tissues, whatever. What is it that allows all

848
00:40:01.469 --> 00:40:03.620
of them to share that same vision of what

849
00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.270
they should be doing? Well, it is a connection

850
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:09.389
between them, an information processing connection between them, which

851
00:40:09.389 --> 00:40:13.270
is biochemical, bioelectrical and biomechanical, that allows them to

852
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:16.219
form a network where the network stores a memory

853
00:40:16.219 --> 00:40:19.709
that none of the individual cells can access. And

854
00:40:19.709 --> 00:40:22.790
uh what happens, both during evolution and development is

855
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:25.790
that cells join into these networks and that allows

856
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:30.310
them to radically raise their uh uh the cognitive

857
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.780
capacity to be able to store and, and work

858
00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.469
on these grandiose projects like making an entire organ,

859
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.310
making a, uh, you know, a limb with, with,

860
00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:40.879
with fingers and all of that. So Once you

861
00:40:40.879 --> 00:40:44.560
think about that, that, uh, that process, it's pretty

862
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.389
obvious that there's going to be a failure mode.

863
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.879
The failure mode is that, is, is what happens

864
00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:52.760
when individual cells disconnect from that network. When an

865
00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.419
individual cell disconnects from that network, then What happens

866
00:40:56.419 --> 00:40:58.939
is that it can no longer access the memories

867
00:40:58.939 --> 00:41:01.219
that it that it was working on. The cognitive

868
00:41:01.219 --> 00:41:04.419
light cone shrinks drastically. So whereas before, the size

869
00:41:04.419 --> 00:41:05.860
of the gold that it was working on was

870
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.699
quite large, let's say a liver or something like

871
00:41:07.699 --> 00:41:09.530
that. That was the size of the cognitive lycone.

872
00:41:09.699 --> 00:41:12.770
Single cell disconnects, now it shrinks down to the

873
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.419
size to the, to the kind of uh uh

874
00:41:15.419 --> 00:41:17.514
scale of goals that single cells have. What are,

875
00:41:17.584 --> 00:41:19.614
what do single cells know how to do? Proliferate,

876
00:41:19.784 --> 00:41:22.544
migrate, and, uh, uh, eat as much as it

877
00:41:22.544 --> 00:41:24.745
wants and dump entropy into the environment. And so

878
00:41:24.745 --> 00:41:27.504
that's metastasis. And so what happens then is that

879
00:41:27.504 --> 00:41:32.175
an integrated coherent entity fragments, and its fragments, uh,

880
00:41:32.304 --> 00:41:35.745
roll backwards to a very ancient lifestyle, where, where

881
00:41:35.745 --> 00:41:37.145
as far as they're concerned, the rest of the

882
00:41:37.145 --> 00:41:39.899
body is just outside environment. So what's happened there

883
00:41:39.899 --> 00:41:41.929
is that the boundary between self and world has

884
00:41:41.929 --> 00:41:45.610
shrunk drastically. These cancer cells are not more selfish,

885
00:41:45.739 --> 00:41:49.080
unlike what, um, some, uh, game theory, uh, um,

886
00:41:49.139 --> 00:41:51.979
kind of approaches take. They're, they're not less cooperative.

887
00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:54.729
They're not more selfish. They just have smaller selves.

888
00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.159
And so that boundary between self and world can,

889
00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.379
can shrink, and that's, and that's cancer. So, that

890
00:42:00.379 --> 00:42:02.580
kind of, that kind of unconventional model of cancer

891
00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.659
makes a, makes a very specific prediction. It suggests

892
00:42:05.659 --> 00:42:08.989
that when that happens, You may not necessarily need

893
00:42:08.989 --> 00:42:11.449
to have, you need to kill the cell. You

894
00:42:11.449 --> 00:42:14.379
may not necessarily need to fix the genetic damage

895
00:42:14.379 --> 00:42:15.889
or whatever other kind of and it doesn't have

896
00:42:15.889 --> 00:42:18.090
to be genetic, but whatever other kind of damage

897
00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:21.959
caused that, that problem, it might be fixable by

898
00:42:21.959 --> 00:42:24.540
reconnecting that cell to the rest of, uh, to

899
00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.489
the rest of the network. And we've done this

900
00:42:26.489 --> 00:42:28.709
in animal models. We've actually shown this, that if

901
00:42:28.709 --> 00:42:32.030
you put really nasty human oncogenes into a, uh,

902
00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:34.699
into a tadpole embryo, they Will make tumors. But

903
00:42:34.699 --> 00:42:37.500
if you force those cells to remain connected to

904
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.379
the other neighbors, even and, and have an appropriate

905
00:42:40.379 --> 00:42:44.820
bi electrical state, even though, uh, the, the mutation

906
00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.379
is very strong, you know, it's very strong and

907
00:42:46.379 --> 00:42:48.379
it's present. You don't kill the cells, you don't

908
00:42:48.379 --> 00:42:50.500
fix the mutation, but there's no, there's no tumor.

909
00:42:50.639 --> 00:42:54.070
You, you, you prevent or, or uh reverse tumorgenesis

910
00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.820
because the cells now become part of that network

911
00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.340
and they just start working on the thing they

912
00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.770
were supposed to be working on. So that's, that,

913
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:05.239
that idea of, of rescaling the, uh, the anatomical,

914
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:09.290
um, goals that, that group um groups of cells

915
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:11.570
work on is a different approach to cancer and

916
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:13.290
that's what we're doing now. And, and we've moved

917
00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:15.479
from the frog model into uh into the human

918
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:18.639
uh X vivo tissues and hopefully someday into patients.

919
00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:23.020
Do you think that an understanding of a biological

920
00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.830
system as a dynamic system, how it operates at

921
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:30.510
different scales, and the fact that it has multiple

922
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:34.820
levels of organization would have implications as to how

923
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.510
we understand causation in biology.

924
00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.370
Yeah, I think, I think all of this stuff

925
00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.179
impacts uh how we, how we think about causation

926
00:43:44.179 --> 00:43:49.439
because. Well, first of all, the perennial question of

927
00:43:49.669 --> 00:43:53.379
which level of organization is the most causally potent.

928
00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.530
So the reductionist view would say that it's the

929
00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:59.389
lowest level. And, uh, this has been an argument

930
00:43:59.389 --> 00:44:01.870
for probably thousands of years now. Now, there's been

931
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:04.780
some amazing advances in the last few decades where

932
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.469
uh people have actually developed, um, computational models for

933
00:44:11.469 --> 00:44:13.840
asking that question in a very rigorous way. So,

934
00:44:13.989 --> 00:44:17.110
um, And so, so, uh, there, there's, there are

935
00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:20.260
aspects of, uh, information theory now that can actually,

936
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:23.510
at least for some systems can do the computation

937
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:26.060
and tell you which level does the most work.

938
00:44:26.389 --> 00:44:28.830
And, uh, it's often not that it's in fact,

939
00:44:29.469 --> 00:44:32.199
sometimes not the lowest level. Uh, SO that's, that's,

940
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:34.550
that's kind of amazing that that philosophical question has

941
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:37.629
now been turned into a very, very, uh, very

942
00:44:37.629 --> 00:44:40.750
practical, um, uh, kind of, uh, rigorous calculation that

943
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:44.070
you can do. And The thing about the, the,

944
00:44:44.159 --> 00:44:47.179
the, to me, the interesting thing about causation is

945
00:44:47.669 --> 00:44:51.070
that what we're looking for is the most efficient

946
00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:54.270
way to interact with the system. We're looking for

947
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:58.270
ways to change what the system is doing to

948
00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:00.629
uh to, to control it in, in certain cases

949
00:45:00.629 --> 00:45:03.070
or to collaborate with it or, or whatever. And

950
00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:05.669
that means that we have to really understand the

951
00:45:05.669 --> 00:45:09.350
causal architecture of the, of the system. And so,

952
00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:13.169
Uh, my claim is, and much like with, with

953
00:45:13.169 --> 00:45:15.810
neuroscience, you know, the reason that we were able

954
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:19.169
to train dogs and horses, uh, thousands of years

955
00:45:19.169 --> 00:45:22.050
before we knew any neuroscience is because their causal

956
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.530
architecture has this amazing feature that it enables a

957
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:27.729
learning interface on the outside, meaning that you can

958
00:45:27.729 --> 00:45:29.659
give rewards and punishments, and you don't have to

959
00:45:29.659 --> 00:45:32.500
know anything that's underneath. The system itself will do

960
00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.330
all the other adjustments, meaning adjust all the chemical

961
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:39.379
processes, the synaptic machinery, the neuronal growths, all, all

962
00:45:39.379 --> 00:45:41.020
that stuff will get adjusted. You don't need to

963
00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.689
do it. The system itself will do it all,

964
00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:44.699
all, you can just operate at this, at this

965
00:45:44.699 --> 00:45:48.139
very, very high level. So, um, that's, that's something

966
00:45:48.139 --> 00:45:50.419
that I think is very important to understand about

967
00:45:50.419 --> 00:45:52.770
other aspects of biology that are not about, uh,

968
00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:56.000
conventional behavior and brains and so on, to understand

969
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.820
what kind of interfaces are there that give you

970
00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.540
maximal causal purchase on that system, so that you're

971
00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.510
not always operating bottom up.

972
00:46:05.409 --> 00:46:07.699
So I want to ask you about a very

973
00:46:07.699 --> 00:46:10.959
interesting article that you wrote on life after death,

974
00:46:10.989 --> 00:46:13.790
and I have two questions about it. So, first,

975
00:46:13.909 --> 00:46:18.469
could you tell us about the thanato transcriptum? And

976
00:46:18.469 --> 00:46:21.290
second, could you tell us about the. THAT we

977
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:24.169
could have a life cycle where after the death

978
00:46:24.169 --> 00:46:29.370
of multicellular organisms, individual cells would live on or

979
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:35.330
even reboot multicellularity and aggregate into novel functional anatomical

980
00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:35.850
forms.

981
00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.550
Sure, yeah. I mean, so, so that wasn't just

982
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:40.419
my paper that I was, I was part of

983
00:46:40.419 --> 00:46:42.780
a team that's been working for, for some years

984
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:46.860
now to understand the thanato transcriptome, which is, is

985
00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:50.050
a very interesting discovery. It turns out that, uh,

986
00:46:50.189 --> 00:46:54.100
at the moment of death, both uh in, in

987
00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:58.209
model systems and in human patients, uh, cells turn

988
00:46:58.209 --> 00:47:01.120
on a whole bunch of new genes. And that,

989
00:47:01.159 --> 00:47:03.679
that's, that's kind of odd because, uh, you know,

990
00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.719
why would you be like turning, turning genes off?

991
00:47:06.919 --> 00:47:09.389
Well, genes being turned off at death makes sense

992
00:47:09.389 --> 00:47:11.360
because metabolism is failing and so on, that, that's

993
00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.280
pretty obvious. But why, why would cells actually be

994
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.389
turning on genes and leads to all sorts of

995
00:47:16.389 --> 00:47:19.479
interesting questions about purpose and causation. For example, some,

996
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.679
some philosophers wonder, does it even make sense to

997
00:47:22.679 --> 00:47:24.639
say that there's a purpose for them to turn

998
00:47:24.639 --> 00:47:26.399
it on, since they're dying? What could the purpose

999
00:47:26.399 --> 00:47:29.909
be? Uh, I'm, I'm more interested in the fact

1000
00:47:29.909 --> 00:47:32.929
that What this is really telling us is again

1001
00:47:32.929 --> 00:47:35.889
about this relationship between parts and holes. So, when

1002
00:47:35.889 --> 00:47:38.330
the organism dies, in fact, most of the cells

1003
00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:42.120
are perfectly fine. And that's, that's an interesting question

1004
00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:44.129
as to, uh, first of all, what does it

1005
00:47:44.129 --> 00:47:47.409
actually mean for the collective to, to, to quote

1006
00:47:47.409 --> 00:47:50.169
unquote die? And, you know, it seems a little

1007
00:47:50.169 --> 00:47:53.330
more obvious in, in, um, uh, in. THAN it

1008
00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:55.050
does, for example, you know, when you, when you

1009
00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:56.330
buy a cabbage and you bring it home and

1010
00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:59.330
you put it in your fridge, at what point

1011
00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:01.979
do you think it's actually dead, right? That's, that's

1012
00:48:01.979 --> 00:48:05.610
not clear at all. And even for humans, what's

1013
00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.280
considered perfectly dead, uh, you know, 100 years ago

1014
00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.889
is now a totally solvable problem in, in modern

1015
00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:14.050
trauma, trauma medicine in the, in the, in the

1016
00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:17.010
emergency room. So, and, and lots of people are

1017
00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:19.729
working on different, different types of reanimation and things

1018
00:48:19.729 --> 00:48:22.110
like that. So, So I'm interested in this, in

1019
00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:26.830
this question of where and how does the collective

1020
00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:29.030
uh disband and what, what does that mean for

1021
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:31.060
its individual cells. And I'll tell you a a

1022
00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:34.070
a a very specific experimental approach that we've taken

1023
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:36.919
to this. Which um has to do with something

1024
00:48:36.919 --> 00:48:40.639
we now call anthrobots. So, it turns out that

1025
00:48:40.639 --> 00:48:44.010
uh tracheal epithelial cells from the airway of human

1026
00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:47.659
uh donors can be cultured in a particular, uh,

1027
00:48:47.699 --> 00:48:51.360
uh, protocol that enables them to self-assemble into a

1028
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.709
novel, uh kind of uh configuration. They make this

1029
00:48:54.709 --> 00:48:57.370
round little, little thing that has cilia on the

1030
00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:00.669
outside, so it swims around. And it's a self

1031
00:49:00.669 --> 00:49:03.590
motile little creature that has, uh, you know, uh,

1032
00:49:03.699 --> 00:49:07.060
4 different kinds of behavior patterns and lots of

1033
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.270
interesting capabilities, including the capability to heal neural wounds

1034
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:13.620
in its vicinity and, and probably much more. Um,

1035
00:49:14.149 --> 00:49:16.060
IT'S very, it's a, it's a very interesting little

1036
00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:19.550
creature, but the, the other, the other interesting thing

1037
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:21.600
is that the donor may or may not be

1038
00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:26.250
alive. So, This is, uh, this is a situation

1039
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:29.889
where the original body, uh, may be quote unquote

1040
00:49:29.889 --> 00:49:33.600
dead. The original human owner may be gone, but

1041
00:49:33.969 --> 00:49:36.489
the, the cells, and in fact, not just individual

1042
00:49:36.489 --> 00:49:38.379
cells, the way we have with, with cell culture

1043
00:49:38.379 --> 00:49:40.560
like healer cells and things like that. Not only,

1044
00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.649
not only the individual cells, but actually there's a

1045
00:49:42.649 --> 00:49:44.969
new organism. Um, THERE'S a new kind of creature

1046
00:49:44.969 --> 00:49:47.370
that's going to live for, uh, at least 5

1047
00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:50.350
weeks, and, uh, the, the original donor may or

1048
00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:53.489
may not be alive. So, you know, we can

1049
00:49:53.489 --> 00:49:55.209
think that we can, we can talk about life

1050
00:49:55.209 --> 00:49:58.129
after death of individual cells and why the cells

1051
00:49:58.129 --> 00:50:02.169
are turning on um certain, certain genes. Uh, MY

1052
00:50:02.169 --> 00:50:05.649
hypothesis about all of that is that Uh, the

1053
00:50:05.649 --> 00:50:07.290
cells are getting ready to go out on their

1054
00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:10.050
own. Now, in a, in a mammal, obviously, that's

1055
00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:11.770
not going to work because they're in dry air.

1056
00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:15.370
And unless there's a, uh, a bioengineer, uh, like,

1057
00:50:15.489 --> 00:50:17.649
like, uh, so that's, that's able to take these

1058
00:50:17.649 --> 00:50:19.449
cells and bring them into a new environment and

1059
00:50:19.449 --> 00:50:21.570
let them become anthrobots or cell culture or something

1060
00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:23.689
else, it's not going to work. But I, I

1061
00:50:23.689 --> 00:50:26.649
think, I think that reality just hasn't caught up

1062
00:50:26.649 --> 00:50:28.979
to them yet. And I think they're doing what,

1063
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:32.669
uh, uh, uh, um, a fish and amphibian cells

1064
00:50:32.669 --> 00:50:35.149
could do, which is, you know, if you think

1065
00:50:35.149 --> 00:50:36.639
about, if you think about a frog or a,

1066
00:50:36.659 --> 00:50:39.870
or a fish dying in a pond somewhere, there's

1067
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:42.300
no particular reason that some of the cells couldn't,

1068
00:50:42.429 --> 00:50:45.350
uh, uh, exit the body and live as amoebas,

1069
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:47.389
right? That this is, this is how many different

1070
00:50:47.389 --> 00:50:49.629
unicellular organisms live, and they may or may not

1071
00:50:49.629 --> 00:50:52.270
come together into a, into a Xenabbo or something

1072
00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:55.159
similar later. But at least, at least in principle,

1073
00:50:55.899 --> 00:50:58.459
Uh, this, the death of the body does not

1074
00:50:58.459 --> 00:51:01.580
mean the death of the cells necessarily. And so

1075
00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:04.100
some of that thanat or transcriptome may be cells

1076
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.219
that are getting ready for a new life. And

1077
00:51:06.219 --> 00:51:08.489
in fact, we've, we've looked at the transcriptome of

1078
00:51:08.489 --> 00:51:15.169
the anthrobots, and they transcriptome is radically altered from

1079
00:51:15.459 --> 00:51:18.100
the, uh, from, from that of, of their donor

1080
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:21.500
cells. About 9000 genes are differently transcribed. That's about

1081
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.500
half the genome. So they have massively different uh

1082
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:27.975
gene expression than uh than the original cells. And

1083
00:51:27.985 --> 00:51:29.985
we didn't touch their DNA. We didn't give them

1084
00:51:29.985 --> 00:51:32.504
any synthetic biology circuits. We didn't put in any

1085
00:51:32.504 --> 00:51:36.104
weird drugs or nanomaterials. It's just a different lifestyle

1086
00:51:36.104 --> 00:51:37.824
and the ability to go on when the original

1087
00:51:37.824 --> 00:51:40.544
body is dead. And, uh, yeah, I think, I

1088
00:51:40.544 --> 00:51:42.425
think, I think cells are pretty, pretty willing to

1089
00:51:42.425 --> 00:51:42.745
do that.

1090
00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:48.379
Uh, BUT multicellularity can be rebooted afterwards.

1091
00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:52.449
Apparently, yeah. I mean, no one, no one would

1092
00:51:52.449 --> 00:51:55.169
have, uh, would have known looking at the, at

1093
00:51:55.169 --> 00:51:57.570
the standard human genome. Well, first of all, let's

1094
00:51:57.570 --> 00:52:00.209
be, let's be clear. Look at the human genome,

1095
00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:01.969
if you didn't already know what a human was,

1096
00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:04.739
you couldn't know. What the standard pattern is going

1097
00:52:04.739 --> 00:52:07.260
to be anyway. But certainly, knowing what a human

1098
00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:11.419
is, uh, you would not know that anthrobots would

1099
00:52:11.419 --> 00:52:13.739
be possible or would have these specific properties, you

1100
00:52:13.739 --> 00:52:17.139
know, specific classes of behavior, uh, with specific transition

1101
00:52:17.139 --> 00:52:19.870
probabilities between those behaviors, and then the ability to

1102
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:22.020
heal neural wounds and some other interesting things that

1103
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:26.500
they do. So, so apparently you can reboot multicellularity.

1104
00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.139
We've done the same thing in, uh, in what

1105
00:52:28.139 --> 00:52:32.979
we call Xenabbots. So, these are, um, Uh, these

1106
00:52:32.979 --> 00:52:36.780
are similar types of, uh, uh, autonomous biobot structures

1107
00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:40.020
that are made from a frog, um, epithelial cells.

1108
00:52:40.689 --> 00:52:43.739
And they also, uh, yeah, they also get together

1109
00:52:43.739 --> 00:52:46.139
and, and form a different pattern and have, have

1110
00:52:46.139 --> 00:52:49.300
behaviors that are distinct from, from their original tissues.

1111
00:52:50.429 --> 00:52:54.429
Mhm. And would it be possible for the individual

1112
00:52:54.429 --> 00:52:58.870
cells to retain some information from the organism they

1113
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:59.699
were part of?

1114
00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.379
I, I think it's certainly possible. We haven't shown

1115
00:53:03.379 --> 00:53:07.379
it yet. We are, we are doing, uh, experiments

1116
00:53:07.379 --> 00:53:10.379
on this. You can imagine, you know, I'll just

1117
00:53:10.379 --> 00:53:12.290
give you one version of a very simple one.

1118
00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:16.139
LET'S say that you take these tracheal cells from

1119
00:53:16.139 --> 00:53:18.500
a donor that was a smoker. So you take

1120
00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:22.850
the tracheal cells, they make an anthrobot. Now, you

1121
00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:25.250
could ask a simple question. Does the anthrobot move

1122
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:29.489
preferentially towards nicotine, right? Does the anthrobot have similar

1123
00:53:29.489 --> 00:53:31.770
addictions that the, that the owner had? And if

1124
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:33.810
you were to take that anthrobot and implant it

1125
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.129
into another body, let's say a rat or something

1126
00:53:36.129 --> 00:53:38.459
like that, would there be any evidence of the

1127
00:53:38.459 --> 00:53:40.580
behaviors, right? I have no idea. I'm not claiming

1128
00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:42.800
that this works. We have not shown this yet,

1129
00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:46.770
but because of, uh, all kinds of work going

1130
00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:49.939
back decades and more recently by um Uh, by

1131
00:53:49.939 --> 00:53:54.050
Glanzman and others, uh, showing that, uh, that, that,

1132
00:53:54.179 --> 00:53:57.100
that memories can propagate in very, very unusual media

1133
00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.500
like RNA and things like that. I see, I

1134
00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:02.139
see no reason in principle why certain kinds of

1135
00:54:02.139 --> 00:54:04.139
memories couldn't move along in tissue.

1136
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:09.229
But then that would mean that some information from

1137
00:54:09.229 --> 00:54:13.139
the original organism could be retained after death.

1138
00:54:14.189 --> 00:54:17.149
I, I, I, it seems, it seems perfectly possible

1139
00:54:17.149 --> 00:54:18.429
to me. I don't, I don't think this has

1140
00:54:18.429 --> 00:54:22.030
been, this has been shown yet, but it seems

1141
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:23.110
not impossible.

1142
00:54:24.889 --> 00:54:28.250
Great. So, Doctor Levin, before we go, would you

1143
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:30.610
like to tell people where they can find you

1144
00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:32.550
and your work on the internet?

1145
00:54:33.129 --> 00:54:35.409
Um, SURE, and, and, and maybe, uh, I'll, I'll

1146
00:54:35.409 --> 00:54:36.570
give you the actual links you can put it

1147
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:38.570
in the show notes or whatever, but, uh, all

1148
00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:43.679
my official stuff is that Uh, drlen.org, one word,

1149
00:54:43.919 --> 00:54:47.310
drlen.org. That's my lab website that has all the,

1150
00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:50.000
uh, you know, all the peer-reviewed papers, the data

1151
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.639
sets, the software, everything else. And, um, if you

1152
00:54:52.639 --> 00:54:55.280
want to see my own kind of more personal

1153
00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.439
thoughts on what all of this means, it's at

1154
00:54:57.439 --> 00:55:02.639
a blog called thoughtforms.life, 11 word, thoughtforms.life. And that's,

1155
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.530
that's a, that's a blog where I talk about,

1156
00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.169
uh, what I think these papers mean and some

1157
00:55:06.169 --> 00:55:06.639
other things.

1158
00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.780
Great, I will be leaving links to that in

1159
00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:12.560
the description of the interview, and Doctor Levin, thank
