00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.890
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.719
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.010
joined by Will Starr. He's an author and journalist.

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.789
And today we're talking about his book, The Status

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.039
Game on Human Life and how to play it.

6
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.430
So will welcome to the show. It's a big

7
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.469
pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:20.069
Yeah, it's great to be on. Thank you, God.

9
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.989
Thanks for asking me.

10
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.649
So, my first question, could you tell us perhaps

11
00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.090
about the premise of the book and also a

12
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.479
little bit about some of the story behind it?

13
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.290
I mean, what led you to writing this book?

14
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.759
Yeah, sure. So the, the, the, the premise of

15
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.930
the status game is to um to put the,

16
00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:44.250
the, the pu of status um is a fundamental

17
00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:47.139
part of the human condition. Um Status is a,

18
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.279
is a, is a need, like humans need it.

19
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.580
It's not like a nice thing to have, it's

20
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.880
a need. And so if you accept this premise,

21
00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:59.380
um then status manifests all over the place in

22
00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:02.110
human culture, in human society and human behavior. And

23
00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.450
so what I wanted to do with the Status

24
00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.910
Game was to try and reveal the places where

25
00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:13.069
status is this often invisible force, changing ourselves, changing,

26
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.519
how we feel about life, changing, history, changing society,

27
00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:17.849
changing social media, anywhere I could find it, I

28
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.480
wanted to kind of expose it to, to give

29
00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:21.720
this kind of broad picture of life as a

30
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.470
status game.

31
00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:25.720
Yeah, and we're going to talk about some of

32
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.029
the things you mentioned there, but perhaps what is

33
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.949
status because I mean, maybe some people don't know

34
00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.529
exactly what you would be talking about when you

35
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.569
mentioned the word like status or what is it?

36
00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:41.589
Yeah, so, so, so, so people get upset about

37
00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:44.370
status for reasons which I'm sure we'll get into

38
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.129
for, for some good evolutionary reasons. Um But, but,

39
00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:50.319
but culturally we, when we think of status, we

40
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.059
think of things like Kim Kardashian or um you

41
00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.730
know, Donald Trump or YYYY, you know, reality TV

42
00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:59.319
P pe people who are desperate for attention, desperate

43
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.550
for, to show off people who are interested in

44
00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:04.750
status are kind of shallow and um uh kind

45
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.149
of vulgar. Um And, and that's wrong. Um That,

46
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.250
that's not what status is, sta status is, is

47
00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:13.130
the, is simply the, the sense that we are

48
00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.809
valued by the people around us, you know, separate

49
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.039
from love and belongings and connections, a separate thing.

50
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.059
It's, you're valued, you're respected. So, so, so that's,

51
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.740
that's all that status is, you know, it's a

52
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.529
universal human need that people feel valued and respected.

53
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.800
That's why it's a universal human reality that people

54
00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:31.520
don't like being insulted. If I call you a

55
00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:34.369
dick, it's gonna annoy you. That's because you, you,

56
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.800
you're interested in, in, in your, in your status

57
00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:37.899
and you value your status.

58
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.699
Yeah. And so there are different ways of uh

59
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.710
manifesting status of acquiring status and in different contexts,

60
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.839
perhaps, uh it would manifest in different ways.

61
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.710
Right? That's, that's right. I mean, the, the, you

62
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.919
know, for the, for the, for the kind of

63
00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.770
more simple organisms on earth, like a, like a,

64
00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.839
like a hen hens will peck at each other

65
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.059
until the pecking order is established. And that's the

66
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.110
hen, that's the hen status game. It's as simple

67
00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.630
as that, like who's the best pecker but, but,

68
00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.770
but humans are just extraordinarily imaginative creatures. We live

69
00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.119
in this sort of fantastic kind of story world.

70
00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.389
A a and, and, and, you know, one of

71
00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:17.820
the ways that you could argue that humans are

72
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.240
separate from the rest of the animals and we've

73
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.949
been, we've, we've allowed ourselves to sort of take,

74
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.919
we've been able to take over the world is

75
00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:25.190
because we have this al almost infinite ways of

76
00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.350
playing status games. You know, you could be a,

77
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.130
you could be a chef in a kitchen and

78
00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.779
YYYY you, there are, there are, there are myriad

79
00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:36.029
ways you could, you could unstate us. You know

80
00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:38.259
how, how, how, how, how clean your station is,

81
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.220
how delicious your food is your reviews on various

82
00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.669
websites, how long hours you work? You know, it

83
00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:45.029
just goes on and on and on and on

84
00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:46.339
and on. And, and the way that humans tend

85
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.770
to be is the things that we're particularly good

86
00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:49.500
at are the things that we value and the

87
00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:51.419
things that we think. Yeah, I'm great because of

88
00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:53.410
X and Y, you know, not Y

89
00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.880
yeah. And I mean, you can have status because

90
00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.570
you're a famous person or because you did something

91
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.910
that people consider very important in your society or

92
00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.050
you can have status across different professional occupations, you

93
00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:11.779
can have status because you're a very uh an

94
00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:15.410
extremely kind person and stuff like that.

95
00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.500
That's right. So, so, so, so, so broadly speaking,

96
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.308
there are three thr I mean, there are loads

97
00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:22.759
of status gains but there, there are things like

98
00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:25.549
age um in, in some contexts in, in, in

99
00:04:25.558 --> 00:04:28.028
human cultures, age is, you know, being older is

100
00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.669
higher status. So in Britain, if I'm sure in

101
00:04:30.678 --> 00:04:32.148
most countries if, if you wanna get a seat

102
00:04:32.158 --> 00:04:33.699
on the train and you're a, you're, you're, you're

103
00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:35.998
an old person, they, they let you have the

104
00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.819
seat at least in theory you've got the status.

105
00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:39.630
But if you're on the beach in, in, in

106
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.779
Bondi Beach in Sydney, being old is not high,

107
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.019
it is low status, it's the young hotties that

108
00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:47.589
are high status. So it's so things like age

109
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.989
are, are really important. Beauty is obviously really important.

110
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.369
Um, BUT, but, but they're not that interesting. I

111
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.160
mean, ii, I think that, you know, for me,

112
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.109
there are sort of three big kinds of status

113
00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:59.529
game. The, the, the first one is dominance and

114
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.609
we've been, you know, we've been, we've been playing

115
00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:03.029
dominance games since before. We were a human animals

116
00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:06.750
primarily play dominance games. It's, it's not just about,

117
00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:09.459
um, physical aggression, it's about the threat of physical

118
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.489
aggression. And that's, you know, that, that, that, that's

119
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.880
most dominance games even in the animal kingdom, you

120
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.570
know, the actual violence is a last resort for

121
00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:18.130
most animals. It's the threat of the violence that,

122
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.420
that, that, that how most status games manifest and

123
00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:22.519
that's the same as in humans. But, but uh

124
00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:24.630
but also in humans, we have social, you know,

125
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.500
what you might call social violence or the threat

126
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.649
of ostracization, reputation destruction, all that good stuff we

127
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.209
see on social media. Um So, so, so that's

128
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.390
dominance and then, and then there are also these

129
00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:37.250
games that we play with reputation um with ID,

130
00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:41.529
with our identity um as virtue games. Um So,

131
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.440
so humans compete to be seen as the most

132
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.720
virtuous. So that's not, you know, it's things like

133
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.440
self selflessness and generosity and um but, but, but

134
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.640
it's also things like um courage in battle. So,

135
00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:56.850
so, so a courageous warrior will be seen as

136
00:05:56.859 --> 00:05:59.269
virtuous. Uh uh BUT it's also, and it's also

137
00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.720
things like um people who know the rules of

138
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.989
your group and enforce the rules of your group.

139
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.190
So, so, you know, the witch finder plays a

140
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.290
virtue game. So, so virtue games can quickly become

141
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.309
incredibly dark and violent and horren horrendous as, as

142
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.299
paradoxical as that might seem at first view. And

143
00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:19.739
then of course, there's competence games, success games. Uh

144
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.570
WE, we compete to be, to be who can

145
00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:24.049
be the best at uh whatever endeavors we're pursuing.

146
00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:25.859
Uh uh And, and I, and I, and I

147
00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:28.720
really feel that, you know, competence games, success games

148
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.929
are the, are the best games to play if

149
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.920
you want, they, they, they're actually much better than

150
00:06:32.929 --> 00:06:34.399
virtue games. If you want to make the world

151
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.140
a better place, it, it, it's much better to,

152
00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:38.239
to discover a new vaccine than it is to

153
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.779
be the Pope in my estimation.

154
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.859
Yeah. Uh BUT uh I mean status and the

155
00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:49.040
acquisition of status doesn't always involve necessarily competition, right?

156
00:06:49.049 --> 00:06:51.809
Because when people think about status, they would probably

157
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.609
think immediately about the hierarchy and people competing among

158
00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:59.690
themselves to acquire status. But uh we, you can

159
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.019
acquire status at least in particular contexts through cooper

160
00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.679
operation,

161
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.859
right? Well, you have to co-operate in order to

162
00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:10.390
create a status game. You know, it's a e

163
00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:13.790
every human group is a status game. So, so,

164
00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:16.920
so, so it's a manifestation of cooper operation. Um

165
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.579
YOU know, a a set of humans gets together

166
00:07:19.829 --> 00:07:22.070
and they, they they, they agree rules by which

167
00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:23.359
to play a status game. And that's why it's

168
00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:25.140
a game. It's like monopoly. We agree that these

169
00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:27.589
are the rules and we play by the rules

170
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.579
and whoever does the best at monopoly is the

171
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:31.179
winner and it's the same in the games of

172
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.260
life. So, so you can't separate out Cooper operation

173
00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.239
from s from status games because, because they, they

174
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.470
wouldn't be functional otherwise AAA. And in fact, you

175
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.609
know, status games is kind of how it is,

176
00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:45.160
how we cooper there has to be a hierarchy

177
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.609
uh I in, in a functional Cooper group and

178
00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:52.179
it has to be somebody ideally super competent and

179
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.119
hopefully a bit virtuous at the top who's go,

180
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.940
who's gonna lead us. So, so, so, so, so,

181
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.529
you know, sta status games are the way that

182
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.549
we figure out how we're going to cooper, you

183
00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:02.989
know, how, how this group is gonna gonna act

184
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.250
in its highly coordinate way to get what it

185
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.779
wants.

186
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.839
Mhm But, but, but I mean, perhaps what I

187
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.649
was trying to allude to is that at least

188
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.470
in particular contexts you can acquire status through being

189
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.790
prosocial, right? You don't necessarily have always to be

190
00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.519
uh competitive in a conflict kind of way, let's

191
00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:24.890
say,

192
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.109
yeah, it is, it's not necessarily a conflict thing.

193
00:08:28.119 --> 00:08:33.409
Um Prosocial is moral and moral games are, you

194
00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:37.698
know, they're virtue games. So, so, so um yeah,

195
00:08:37.707 --> 00:08:41.648
YYYY, you know, people compete to, to www when

196
00:08:41.658 --> 00:08:43.989
you go into just giving, uh a and you,

197
00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:45.869
uh, put your donation with your name next to

198
00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:48.158
it, you always look to see how much is

199
00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:50.549
my donation compared to the norm here. You know,

200
00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:52.369
and you feel good if it's above, you know,

201
00:08:52.379 --> 00:08:54.299
so, so, so, yeah, you know, we, we, we,

202
00:08:54.309 --> 00:08:56.429
we, we, we, we compete to have the most

203
00:08:56.439 --> 00:08:59.588
prosocial reputation and that's a good thing, you know,

204
00:08:59.598 --> 00:09:01.948
that I think people, when I talk about this,

205
00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.068
people sometimes feel like you're kind of shitting on

206
00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:06.250
the human condition and, and, and you're, you're, you're

207
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.909
saying altruism, uh, YYYY, you know, is a, is

208
00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:10.340
a con but it, but, but it isn't a

209
00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:12.210
con, you know, it's, it's, uh, the fact that

210
00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:15.849
we've competed to achieve a prosocial reputation. We've, we've

211
00:09:15.859 --> 00:09:17.580
competed to have the reputation as the most cooper

212
00:09:17.669 --> 00:09:20.400
person. It, it is probably the best part of

213
00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:22.679
the human condition. It's amazing. It means that when

214
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.760
we do good for other people, we feel good,

215
00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:26.609
we feel we have a bumping status in our

216
00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:29.239
own minds and we, and other people hopefully also

217
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.299
treat us like, oh, that's a really good thing.

218
00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:32.559
Uh, THAT, that, that, that you've done and you

219
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:33.880
feel good. You have, you feel good in that

220
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.520
moment and that's, that, that, that's a fantastic part

221
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.419
of the human condition.

222
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.710
Uh But I mean, do you believe in, let's

223
00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:45.719
say genuine altruism in the sense that someone is

224
00:09:45.729 --> 00:09:50.969
really actually genuinely interested in helping other people because

225
00:09:50.979 --> 00:09:53.849
in this case, since it is also part of

226
00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:57.619
the status game, someone might think that maybe even

227
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.789
if you are altruistic that it's sort of a

228
00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:04.739
self-interest thing for you to do because you're acquiring,

229
00:10:04.909 --> 00:10:06.580
uh, status through it.

230
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.059
Yeah. But, well, um, nnn nothing comes from a

231
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.000
void. I mean, there, there's a reason for everything,

232
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.229
for every human behavior. There's a reason and for

233
00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:15.770
kind of in the invertical was altruism. There's a

234
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.909
reason for that too. And the reason is that

235
00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:20.640
we've evolved to, we, we, we, we're highly cooper

236
00:10:20.809 --> 00:10:24.059
a, we, we've evolved to exist in these highly

237
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.880
collaborative groups and that, and that's why we're so

238
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.039
successful. We, we, you know, rather than um indi

239
00:10:29.049 --> 00:10:31.559
individual, you know, e even chimpanzees are very close

240
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.469
relatives go, you know, they, they source their food

241
00:10:33.479 --> 00:10:36.700
as individuals whereas humans go as groups. And so

242
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.719
a part of that is, is that we are

243
00:10:38.729 --> 00:10:41.460
wired to feel good when we are of assistance

244
00:10:41.469 --> 00:10:43.429
to other people. And the uh you know, that's

245
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.679
altruism. But the, but the reason that we have,

246
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.700
we, we have, we are have evolved to feel

247
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.840
good about that is because it's good for our

248
00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:51.969
reputation and when we have a reputation for helping

249
00:10:51.979 --> 00:10:54.320
other people, other people will then help us, we're

250
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.679
raising status. So, you know, there's a reason why

251
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.219
we, some why, why, why, why we, why we

252
00:11:00.229 --> 00:11:03.150
engage in altruistic acts. That's not, that's not to

253
00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:05.460
say that Altruism is a conner, as I said.

254
00:11:05.469 --> 00:11:07.020
But, but, but the, but the idea that Altruism

255
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.619
comes out of a void that it's this kind

256
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.380
of God given thing that people are kind of

257
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.000
altruistic from this place with no roots in anything.

258
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.900
It just comes from the heavens. There is this

259
00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:18.780
magical, wonderful thing. I think it's very naive,

260
00:11:19.299 --> 00:11:22.780
right? So, uh tell us then about your evolutionary

261
00:11:22.789 --> 00:11:27.359
approach to status, I mean, uh uh what would

262
00:11:27.369 --> 00:11:31.039
be your evolutionary account of it? And how old

263
00:11:31.049 --> 00:11:34.369
do you think status is in evolutionary history?

264
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.270
Well, you know, most animals compete for status. That,

265
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.809
that, that, that's, that's how it works. So we've

266
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.590
been competing for status since before we were human

267
00:11:42.599 --> 00:11:45.239
since we were up in the trees. It usually

268
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.390
in these kind of dominance ways. Uh But then

269
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.530
when we started living in groups around campfires, we

270
00:11:49.539 --> 00:11:52.549
had to find a new way to compete the

271
00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:54.859
status because you can't do dominance all the time

272
00:11:54.869 --> 00:11:58.669
because it really would be like hell, you know,

273
00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:03.039
you get mostly men beating each other, like beating

274
00:12:03.049 --> 00:12:04.820
each other up constantly. You know, it, it, it's,

275
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.280
it's a nightmare. So in order to become to,

276
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.739
to, to live in communities, we had to evolve

277
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:15.210
nonviolent ways by which we could compete with status.

278
00:12:15.219 --> 00:12:17.460
And so, so you do that with reputation. And

279
00:12:17.469 --> 00:12:20.880
so somewhere between 100,000 and um sort of 50,000

280
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.619
and 100,000 years ago, we started, um you know,

281
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.669
kind of living life as animals that experience our

282
00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:29.929
lives in the form of a story. Uh We're

283
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.340
characters in a story. We have this identity, this

284
00:12:32.349 --> 00:12:35.109
reputation, this kind of version of self, which is

285
00:12:35.119 --> 00:12:38.500
an act of imagination and communal imagination. There's you

286
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.570
that exist in, in, in flesh and blood and

287
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.059
there's the you that exists in your own mind

288
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.229
and in the mind of the people that, that,

289
00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:46.080
that are around you and, and, and, and that

290
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.429
identity that we have is incredibly important to humans.

291
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.900
People will die for their, to, to in defense

292
00:12:50.909 --> 00:12:52.669
of their identity, they will give up their actual

293
00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:55.020
physical lives in defense of their identity. So we

294
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.880
play status games with that identity. That's what we

295
00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.030
started to do. And, and as I said before,

296
00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:01.289
there, you know, there are two principal ways, there's

297
00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:03.729
virtue and there's success and the reason that, that,

298
00:13:03.739 --> 00:13:04.820
that, that, that, that, that we have evolved to

299
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.210
compete for, to be virtuous, have a reputation of

300
00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:09.359
being virtuous and have a, have a reputation of

301
00:13:09.369 --> 00:13:11.489
being successful is because both of those things benefit

302
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.280
the cooper group. So, so, so when we compete

303
00:13:14.289 --> 00:13:18.059
to have this prosocial, selfless altruistic reputation, that's great

304
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.729
for the group cos what that means is that

305
00:13:19.739 --> 00:13:22.719
we're being selfless, we're putting the group's interests before

306
00:13:22.729 --> 00:13:24.950
our own. So, so, so, so of course, that,

307
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.059
that, you know, ee evolution wants us to think

308
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.659
like that, it wants us to play those games

309
00:13:28.669 --> 00:13:30.250
because the more we play those games the, that

310
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.820
if everybody gives to the group, primarily the group

311
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.382
is really successful. It, uh, and so, so, so,

312
00:13:35.393 --> 00:13:36.812
so that, of course, is something that, that, that

313
00:13:36.822 --> 00:13:39.143
evolution is gonna wanna favor because it makes for

314
00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:41.692
more functional groups. And the same is obviously to,

315
00:13:41.763 --> 00:13:44.132
with competence in, in a hunter gatherer group being

316
00:13:44.143 --> 00:13:46.903
the best honey Finder being the best, um, sorcerer

317
00:13:46.913 --> 00:13:49.742
being the best hunter being the best tuber digger

318
00:13:49.752 --> 00:13:52.723
outer. That's great. You know, beca because you're, you're,

319
00:13:52.732 --> 00:13:54.723
you're bringing your talent to, to, for the benefit

320
00:13:54.732 --> 00:13:57.216
of the group. You, you're calories, you're bringing yy,

321
00:13:57.226 --> 00:14:00.276
you know, I don't know, great shelters and you're

322
00:14:00.286 --> 00:14:02.895
teaching other people these things that you're, you're figuring

323
00:14:02.906 --> 00:14:04.875
out. So that's the other thing that, that, that,

324
00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:08.075
that evolution wants us to compete for. So, you

325
00:14:08.085 --> 00:14:10.255
know, to be good and to be excellent. I

326
00:14:10.265 --> 00:14:13.015
mean, I, I, it, that, that, that's how humans

327
00:14:13.026 --> 00:14:15.315
have become so successful. Cos we compete to be

328
00:14:15.325 --> 00:14:16.765
good and we compete to be excellent.

329
00:14:17.599 --> 00:14:20.340
Mhm. Uh And so I would imagine that there

330
00:14:20.349 --> 00:14:22.960
would also be a very big, at least in

331
00:14:22.969 --> 00:14:27.659
humans cultural element to how we play these status

332
00:14:27.669 --> 00:14:31.359
games, right? Because I mean, whatever kind of identity

333
00:14:31.369 --> 00:14:34.210
or social identity you have for, if you are

334
00:14:34.219 --> 00:14:36.530
a shaman or if you are a hunter or

335
00:14:36.539 --> 00:14:40.270
if you are someone like that, uh, that, that

336
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.390
is a culturally constructed identity.

337
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.090
That's right. So, so, so, so there, there are

338
00:14:46.099 --> 00:14:48.770
kind of basic rule that are universal for human

339
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.669
groups is like seven. Um AND um things like

340
00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:55.440
defer to your superiors, protect, protect property rights, the,

341
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.739
the, the, the these are kind of, you know,

342
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.169
in our baked into our DNA, every human is

343
00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:02.390
born and these emerge the, the, the, the, these

344
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.770
basic ways of existing in a Cooper group. But

345
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:12.260
they, they, they leave huge um um uh capacity

346
00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.429
for culture to go on top of them to,

347
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.570
you know, so it's culture is kind of the

348
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.229
software of, you know, o of the oo of

349
00:15:18.239 --> 00:15:20.080
the human mind and, and the DNA is the

350
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.900
hardware. So, so, so of course, there's massive cultural

351
00:15:22.909 --> 00:15:24.880
differences, you know, when you go around the world,

352
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.500
there's massive cultural differences. Um YOU know, when you

353
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.080
go to China, you see lots of people spitting

354
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.710
in the street. If you go to Japan, even

355
00:15:32.719 --> 00:15:35.270
blowing your nose is seen as disgusting. Whereas in

356
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.750
the West, we blow our nose, you know, so

357
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.469
it's so it's so even little things like that.

358
00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:40.510
But, but, but there's huge cultural differences as, as

359
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.270
you go around the world, you know, there's, there's

360
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.539
hu huge cultural differences as you, as you, as

361
00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:46.349
you move around in time as well. You know,

362
00:15:46.359 --> 00:15:48.609
there are, there are some tribes um I, I

363
00:15:48.619 --> 00:15:50.390
think I wrote about them in my previous book,

364
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.109
the science of storytelling. Um WHERE um it, it,

365
00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.869
it's the norm that on, on, on a wedding

366
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.320
night that the men of the village queue up

367
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.669
to have sex with your bride that's seen as

368
00:15:58.679 --> 00:16:01.159
normal, you know, like things that we would find

369
00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:04.169
horrific, you know, in different countries around Europe, there's

370
00:16:04.179 --> 00:16:06.440
the different ages of consent. So, so, so you'll

371
00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.270
be a, you'll be a pedophile in one country

372
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.080
but a normal person in another country, you know,

373
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.570
that's happening right now in Europe, you know, amongst

374
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.669
neighbors. So, so, so there are huge um cultural

375
00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:19.070
differences. Um And of course, the brain fools us

376
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.390
into thinking the norms of our particular status game

377
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.570
are correct and, and, and you know, and if

378
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.530
you break those norms, that's, that's you get a

379
00:16:26.539 --> 00:16:28.719
reduction in status. If you adhere to the norms,

380
00:16:28.729 --> 00:16:31.359
you, you get AAA rag in status.

381
00:16:32.049 --> 00:16:37.270
Mhm. And are there important sex or gender differences

382
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.729
between men and women in, in terms of how

383
00:16:40.739 --> 00:16:42.309
they compete for a status?

384
00:16:42.799 --> 00:16:44.809
Well, I I think one of the most interesting

385
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.369
ones um that I wish that our culture in

386
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.369
general you were more familiar with was the differences

387
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.400
in interests. And, and I, I think probably lots

388
00:16:52.409 --> 00:16:53.849
of your viewers will be well aware of this,

389
00:16:53.859 --> 00:16:57.150
but one of the most well established universal gender

390
00:16:57.159 --> 00:17:02.000
differences is between interest in things and interest in

391
00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.858
people. So women in general tend to be more

392
00:17:04.868 --> 00:17:07.030
interested in people, men in general tend to be

393
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.699
more interested in things, which is why, you know,

394
00:17:09.709 --> 00:17:12.680
there was a big kerfuffle, um maybe 1010 or

395
00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:14.439
more years ago. Now at Google, when, when it,

396
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:17.229
when I think it was revealed that 20% only

397
00:17:17.239 --> 00:17:19.959
20% of their code is a female. And um

398
00:17:19.969 --> 00:17:22.430
there was some poor guy that tried to establish

399
00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:24.459
a scientific well, did establish it. He said this

400
00:17:24.469 --> 00:17:26.310
is, well, this is what you'd expect partly, you

401
00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.520
know, in large part because of the men are

402
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.680
more interested in engineering and, and how things work

403
00:17:30.689 --> 00:17:32.660
and women or women are not. So this is

404
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.699
what you'd expect. And he was kind of fired

405
00:17:34.709 --> 00:17:36.609
from his job and sort of pilloried of being

406
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.689
a sort of misogynist for pointing out this very

407
00:17:38.699 --> 00:17:42.709
well established. Um And really non-controversial should be non-controversial

408
00:17:42.719 --> 00:17:45.439
idea. So what that means is that is, is

409
00:17:45.449 --> 00:17:47.380
that when you go into companies like Google uh

410
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.300
or YYYY, you know, you are likely to find

411
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.079
a big gender difference and it's not because of

412
00:17:52.089 --> 00:17:53.880
sexism or misogyny on the part of the company.

413
00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.520
It's just because, you know, it's just like when

414
00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:57.599
you go to a school, most of the teachers

415
00:17:57.609 --> 00:18:00.239
are gonna be female. Um It's, it, it's just

416
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.069
uh the manifestation of a gender difference. Um The,

417
00:18:03.079 --> 00:18:05.680
the, the there are also other differences I I

418
00:18:05.689 --> 00:18:10.560
believe and um I haven't seen a lot of

419
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.319
scientific evidence, but just life experience makes me uh

420
00:18:14.329 --> 00:18:17.339
this is just a suspicion of mine, I feel

421
00:18:17.349 --> 00:18:21.579
that that women and men compete for status, generally

422
00:18:21.589 --> 00:18:24.069
speaking in different ways, in the sense that women

423
00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:27.709
are, are more communal naturally, women tend to do

424
00:18:27.719 --> 00:18:30.560
things in groups much more easily. Um And men

425
00:18:30.569 --> 00:18:32.660
tend to, men tend to kind of play status

426
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.150
games as individuals, as compete as individuals. Um Sometimes

427
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.709
you hear it said that women socialize side by

428
00:18:38.719 --> 00:18:42.660
side and men socialize face to face. Um Yy,

429
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:46.109
you know, um AAA and I, and I think

430
00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:48.800
that's II, I think that's really interesting and I

431
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.719
think you see that manifesting in, in, in aggression,

432
00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.349
in dominance games, you know, men tend to be

433
00:18:55.359 --> 00:18:58.469
much more straightforward than individual and they'll, they'll take

434
00:18:58.479 --> 00:18:59.989
it to your face if there's a problem with

435
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.500
you. Whereas women, female aggression tends to be much

436
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.750
more communal. It's about reputation destruction, it's about the,

437
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.239
the gang, you know, forming uh and the, and

438
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.400
the sense of consensus forming and rounding on the,

439
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.650
on the, on the poor victim. So, so II,

440
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.270
I think a lot of the, the cancel culture,

441
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.349
the the kind of reputation destruction stuff that you

442
00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:20.300
see in the, in the modern, in, in the

443
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.420
modern world. It, it, it feel, I mean, obviously,

444
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.790
obviously I'm not saying that men don't do this.

445
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.500
Of course, men do this too, but it, but

446
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.469
it, but it feels much more female typical. It's,

447
00:19:27.479 --> 00:19:30.579
you know, if there's toxic masculinity there's also toxic

448
00:19:30.589 --> 00:19:32.199
femininity. And I think a lot of that council

449
00:19:32.209 --> 00:19:35.060
culture stuff is a manifestation of toxic femininity.

450
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.689
Yeah, that, that's very interesting. And of course, we

451
00:19:38.699 --> 00:19:41.050
have to keep in mind that these are average

452
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:45.189
differences and it's not that women compete only one

453
00:19:45.199 --> 00:19:48.219
way and men compete the other way. But I

454
00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:52.334
would imagine that another somewhat big difference would be

455
00:19:52.344 --> 00:19:55.785
that men, when they compete against one another, they

456
00:19:55.795 --> 00:20:00.015
would resort to violence much more often than women.

457
00:20:00.525 --> 00:20:02.415
Absolutely. There's the violence and there's also the threat

458
00:20:02.425 --> 00:20:04.734
of violence, which again is the same with animals.

459
00:20:04.744 --> 00:20:06.844
It is the threat that usually does the job.

460
00:20:07.219 --> 00:20:09.550
Um, SO ss so, yeah, that, that, yeah, II,

461
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.280
I think that's it, it's, it's the dominance games

462
00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.890
where I think that, that the gender differences most

463
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.949
likely play out and, and, and, and again, that

464
00:20:16.959 --> 00:20:19.530
that will go back, um, a long, long time

465
00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.959
in our evolutionary history, you know, women have been

466
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.949
the, the primary caregivers, um, and men have been

467
00:20:24.959 --> 00:20:28.810
the kind of go out and hunt us, um,

468
00:20:28.819 --> 00:20:32.500
primarily for millions of years. So, so, so that,

469
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.250
so that's got to have some effect on our,

470
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.130
you know, if I in our present ways of

471
00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.329
thinking and being,

472
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:44.140
yeah. And, and what are the psychological effects of

473
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:48.439
being low status? I mean, psychologically, what do people

474
00:20:48.449 --> 00:20:50.780
who are low status experience?

475
00:20:51.479 --> 00:20:53.550
Well, I, the, the, the, one of the important

476
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.780
things to kind of know about the status game.

477
00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.199
Kind of the idea that I, that I thrash

478
00:20:58.209 --> 00:20:59.709
out in the book is that life isn't just

479
00:20:59.719 --> 00:21:02.819
one big status game. Human life is almost infinite

480
00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:06.359
status games. So it's not like that you've got

481
00:21:06.369 --> 00:21:08.339
Elon Musk and Taylor Swift at the top and

482
00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.930
some, you know, itinerant peanut seller in y you

483
00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:14.839
know, the I I in the developing world at

484
00:21:14.849 --> 00:21:17.319
the bottom and he's happy and she's happy and

485
00:21:17.329 --> 00:21:19.229
they're miserable. That's not how it is at all.

486
00:21:19.239 --> 00:21:20.750
We we, we tend to compete with status with,

487
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.069
with those closest to us. So the peanut seller

488
00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:25.040
doesn't care about Elon Musk and E, Elon Musk

489
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.500
clearly doesn't care about the peanut seller. They're not

490
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.199
competing with each other. Um Elon Musk is competing

491
00:21:29.209 --> 00:21:31.199
with Jeff Bezos and people like this and Taylor

492
00:21:31.209 --> 00:21:33.239
Swift is competing with Charlie XCX and people like

493
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.869
that. So everybody's playing this very difficult game. So,

494
00:21:38.069 --> 00:21:39.900
so, so, so, so, so, so we all play

495
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.650
these kind of mostly local games with the, with

496
00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.050
the people around us. We're not all competing with

497
00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.770
the whole world isn't competing with each other. Um

498
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.449
That was my caveat, but I've forgotten the question.

499
00:21:49.459 --> 00:21:50.689
What was the uh

500
00:21:50.699 --> 00:21:55.199
basically, what would be the psychological effect of being

501
00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:55.339
low

502
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.670
students? OK. So, so, so, so, so, so, so

503
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.310
even people living what we might, you know, a

504
00:22:01.319 --> 00:22:05.810
very low socio, economic deprived life might not feel

505
00:22:05.819 --> 00:22:08.160
low status if they are relatively high status in

506
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.969
their communities. That that's the first thing. Um But,

507
00:22:10.979 --> 00:22:12.949
but, but if you do feel like you are

508
00:22:12.959 --> 00:22:15.479
chronically suffering from low status is extremely bad for

509
00:22:15.489 --> 00:22:18.359
your, for your mental health because your subconscious is

510
00:22:18.369 --> 00:22:21.359
telling you something's going wrong like in, in the

511
00:22:21.369 --> 00:22:24.540
tribes in which we evolved. Um EARNING status, earning

512
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.079
the reputation of being a valuable member of the

513
00:22:26.089 --> 00:22:28.400
tribe would have got you more food, better food,

514
00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.310
safer sleeping sites. Um BETTER conditions of life for

515
00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:34.020
your Children, better access to your choice of mates.

516
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:37.040
Basically, everything in your life gets better when your

517
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.250
status goes up. And it's always been that way.

518
00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.790
It's that way today. So when you feel chronically

519
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.689
low status, your, your, your brain, your subconscious brain

520
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.780
treats that as a matter of deep alarm and

521
00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.489
we become extremely distressed. We become um depressed, anxious.

522
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.969
Um We, we often become suicidal. Um You, you

523
00:22:55.979 --> 00:23:00.250
know, sss, you know, a sudden, a sudden um

524
00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.770
loss of status or an episode of intense humiliation,

525
00:23:03.939 --> 00:23:07.449
humiliation being the public and sudden withdrawal of status.

526
00:23:07.459 --> 00:23:10.530
Significant resource of status is, is, is, is associated

527
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.010
with um high rates of suicide. So, so it's

528
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.209
extremely um bad for us. And I mean, in

529
00:23:16.219 --> 00:23:19.479
my spare time, I volunteer for um uh the

530
00:23:19.489 --> 00:23:22.709
Samaritans which is a British crisis hotline. So I

531
00:23:22.719 --> 00:23:26.699
speak often to people who are suicidal and the

532
00:23:26.709 --> 00:23:30.819
most um common reason why people are suicidal. They

533
00:23:30.829 --> 00:23:32.910
mean they are people who suffer from chronic pain.

534
00:23:33.099 --> 00:23:35.469
People who are recently bereaved. But, but the most

535
00:23:35.479 --> 00:23:38.020
common one is either people chronic, lacking in status,

536
00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.650
they go, I'm a failure. I'm useless. I've let

537
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.380
everyone down. It's that kind of talk or they're

538
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:45.140
chronic lacking in connection. No one loves me. You

539
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.400
know, I don't, I, I'm lonely. That's the other

540
00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.020
one that's just, you know, connection is just as

541
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.920
important as, as, as status in its way. Um,

542
00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:55.800
So, so, so yeah, it's, it's extremely bad for

543
00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.469
us to, to feel like we're low status.

544
00:23:58.209 --> 00:24:01.760
Mhm You mentioned loneliness there. So I would imagine

545
00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:05.420
that something like social rejection could also be a

546
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:09.199
consequence of being low status, right?

547
00:24:09.319 --> 00:24:11.770
Yeah, I mean, you can't disentangle those two things

548
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:16.119
completely becau because they're both kind of manifestations of

549
00:24:16.819 --> 00:24:19.089
human tribal life. We want to be connected and

550
00:24:19.099 --> 00:24:22.520
respected. We want to be securely fastened into our

551
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.300
group, but also valued by that group. Um uh

552
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.729
But, but, but connection, belongingness is a separate thing

553
00:24:29.739 --> 00:24:34.290
from um status. You know, sometimes scientists, neuroscientists talk

554
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.010
about, we have a soomer in our subconscious which

555
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.420
monitors the, the health of our social life, but

556
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.390
there's also a higher meer that monitors our place

557
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.410
in the hierarchy. Um So connection is obviously isn't

558
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.310
the subject of the status game, but it, but

559
00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:49.390
it is equally important to status. Like we, we,

560
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.229
it's not just that we have to feel valued,

561
00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:52.739
we have to feel loved, we have to feel

562
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.109
securely attached to people who care about us. That's,

563
00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:58.349
that's, that's no less important than feeling valued.

564
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.780
So, but we're talking here mostly about the losers,

565
00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.780
let's say. But what about the winners? Someone with

566
00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:09.430
high status and wants to maintain it, don't they

567
00:25:09.439 --> 00:25:11.930
usually also go through stress?

568
00:25:12.339 --> 00:25:14.130
Yeah, of course. I mean, and, and, and that's

569
00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.719
for the reason I was talking about before where

570
00:25:15.729 --> 00:25:17.660
we all play these local status games. I mean,

571
00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.989
that, that's the kind of evil kind of qualitative

572
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.689
status really. It's like, it's like a drug, it's

573
00:25:22.699 --> 00:25:25.550
like a heroin. It's, you're never gonna, you're, you're,

574
00:25:25.689 --> 00:25:27.290
it kind of robs us of the ability to

575
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.290
be permanently happy status because no matter what we

576
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.829
get, we always want more. Um THAT, that's kind

577
00:25:32.839 --> 00:25:34.400
of how we're set up and it kind of

578
00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.810
ratchets up. It's not like, I mean, of course,

579
00:25:36.819 --> 00:25:39.050
you get, you get a, a AAA few insanely

580
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.140
ambitious young people that dream of being Elon Musk

581
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.099
or Taylor Swift. Um But most people don't, they

582
00:25:43.109 --> 00:25:44.369
just want the next thing and the next thing

583
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.060
and the next thing, but the thing about human

584
00:25:46.069 --> 00:25:47.880
brains is we acclimatized to the next thing. So

585
00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.989
every little achievement we have, we think. Yeah, great.

586
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.310
I've achieved this, I've made this and then two

587
00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:54.670
minutes later you want the next thing and the

588
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.969
next thing and the next thing and the next

589
00:25:55.979 --> 00:25:57.949
thing. And so so, so even people at the

590
00:25:57.959 --> 00:26:00.959
very top of the, of the status game, you

591
00:26:00.969 --> 00:26:02.709
know, the masks and the swiss of this world,

592
00:26:02.969 --> 00:26:05.959
they're not happy about their status because they, well,

593
00:26:05.969 --> 00:26:10.869
partly because, um, they're the targets of immense amounts

594
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.109
of, um, resentment and, and envy. I mean, Elon

595
00:26:14.119 --> 00:26:17.800
Musk, um, and Taylor Swift are both two of

596
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.290
the most famous people in the western world, but

597
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.959
there are also two of the most hated people

598
00:26:20.969 --> 00:26:22.400
in the western world. They've got lots of people

599
00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.469
that, that despise them, you know. Um So that

600
00:26:25.479 --> 00:26:27.890
can't be very nice. But, but, but even aside

601
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.900
from that, the, the their, their place at the

602
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:33.390
top, it's never permanent. They're all, you're always replaced,

603
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.920
you always have um competition and for, and for

604
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.650
me and mortals like us, I mean, you know,

605
00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.709
your competition is podcasters. My competition is other Midle

606
00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.599
authors. I mean, you know, ok, sometimes you feel

607
00:26:44.609 --> 00:26:47.000
that, but, but God imagine if your competition was

608
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.319
Jeff Bezos, you know, like, like, or, or whoever

609
00:26:50.329 --> 00:26:52.839
or whoever it is in Elon Musk's world, these

610
00:26:52.849 --> 00:26:57.760
unbelievably driven, smart, um ruthless individuals are, are, are,

611
00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:00.780
are constantly coming for you. And I mean, that's,

612
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.520
that's not a recipe for happiness but any stretch

613
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:04.319
of the imagination,

614
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.900
right? So tell us then about how status games

615
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.109
play out on social media because that's something that

616
00:27:12.119 --> 00:27:14.310
you alluded to earlier.

617
00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.040
Yeah. So, um in the book and also in

618
00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.010
the book Selfie, which I wrote a few years

619
00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.310
ago about a, which was about, you know, a

620
00:27:22.369 --> 00:27:24.280
lot of that was about the, the, the, the,

621
00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:27.239
the effect of the internet on our western culture.

622
00:27:27.859 --> 00:27:31.160
Um I write a lot about the, um the

623
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.689
very naive utopian vision that people had for the

624
00:27:33.699 --> 00:27:35.420
internet back in the nineties, you know, the Wired

625
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.459
Magazine people and, you know, the people that could

626
00:27:37.469 --> 00:27:40.680
see the internet coming, they, they all believed that

627
00:27:40.689 --> 00:27:44.130
um once um billions and mi millions and billions

628
00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.859
were all kind of all wired together that the

629
00:27:45.869 --> 00:27:48.150
hierarchies of the past would collapse. And we'd be,

630
00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.630
it would bring us into this utopia and future

631
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.270
where nobody would compete and everybody would be happy.

632
00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.979
Um But of course, that's not what happens when

633
00:27:54.989 --> 00:27:57.890
you connect the human beings together, when you connect

634
00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.770
human beings together, they're just gonna play status games.

635
00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.380
That's just what they do. I mean, it really

636
00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.300
is and, and in the status game I am

637
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.829
there, there's a, there's a, there's a bit about

638
00:28:05.839 --> 00:28:08.180
this very early social media website called the Well,

639
00:28:08.189 --> 00:28:09.920
as far as I could find, it's the, probably

640
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.040
the, it's arguably the first proper social media site

641
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.750
because it's, you know, you had to, it was

642
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.939
in the, it was in the mid eighties. So

643
00:28:15.949 --> 00:28:17.250
you had the phones where you put the phone

644
00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.160
in the modem. Um And there was a AAA

645
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.760
and um and it was like Reddit. So, so

646
00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.520
you'd have these um little sub, you could set

647
00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:25.959
up any kind of subject group and sort of

648
00:28:25.969 --> 00:28:29.420
show off about your, about your particular um area

649
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:33.520
of nerdy interest. Um And then even when there

650
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.270
was as small as 500 users of the world,

651
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.989
they started having what they called flame wars people,

652
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.339
they, they would just have massive arguments. Um They,

653
00:28:40.349 --> 00:28:42.800
they, they, they had a whole drama which I

654
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.040
recount briefly in the status game about um pronouns

655
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:49.510
for trans people. You know, like it's unbelievably um

656
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.069
uh uh reminiscent of uh of online drama today

657
00:28:53.079 --> 00:28:55.349
when it's not 500 people that are connected together,

658
00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:57.790
it's more than half the population of the planet.

659
00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:59.949
So, so, so, so, so that's what we do

660
00:28:59.959 --> 00:29:02.449
when we, you know, we, we, when we connect

661
00:29:02.459 --> 00:29:04.189
people together, we compete, uh you know, when we

662
00:29:04.199 --> 00:29:07.790
play status games. Um Unfortunately, and that, that's what

663
00:29:07.969 --> 00:29:10.319
a lot of what social media is today is.

664
00:29:10.329 --> 00:29:12.760
People, you know, like talked about dominance games, virtual

665
00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:16.229
games and success games. Well, that's social media. We,

666
00:29:16.239 --> 00:29:18.280
we play dominance games, we push each other around.

667
00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.550
Um We judge each other for not following our

668
00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.459
particular social norms. So, you know, the woks and

669
00:29:24.469 --> 00:29:26.910
the anti woke constantly go after each other for

670
00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.040
not for not seeing the world exactly as they

671
00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:32.930
do. Um You've got um virtue games, people showing

672
00:29:32.939 --> 00:29:35.300
off about the wonderful things they do for charity

673
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:38.430
and um uh and so on and then of

674
00:29:38.439 --> 00:29:40.250
course, you've got success games people showing off about

675
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.670
this amazing holiday. They've got this achievement they've made

676
00:29:42.719 --> 00:29:45.459
linkedin is, is, is, is mostly, you know, showing

677
00:29:45.469 --> 00:29:47.880
off about success games. So, so, so, so that's,

678
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.089
that's really the, the kind of bread and butter

679
00:29:50.099 --> 00:29:52.050
of social media and it's what makes social media

680
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.890
addictive. Yy, you know, that's why it's so compulsive.

681
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.290
There has to be something about social media, um

682
00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.530
which explains its universal success. As I say, more

683
00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.369
than half the population of the world is on

684
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.314
social media, which is amazing considering that that includes

685
00:30:05.324 --> 00:30:07.964
Children, people who haven't got smartphones, that, that's just,

686
00:30:07.974 --> 00:30:10.505
you know, that's incredible. And so what's it offering?

687
00:30:10.515 --> 00:30:12.415
So, you know, my, my argument is that is

688
00:30:12.425 --> 00:30:13.964
that social media is a, is a brand new

689
00:30:13.974 --> 00:30:17.545
machine for generating status. It's perfectly possible to have

690
00:30:17.555 --> 00:30:20.344
more status for somebody to have more status on

691
00:30:20.354 --> 00:30:22.834
their phone than they do in real life. You

692
00:30:22.844 --> 00:30:24.324
know, when they, when they fire up their Instagram

693
00:30:24.334 --> 00:30:26.385
or their Twitter or their tiktok or whatever, and

694
00:30:26.395 --> 00:30:28.114
they've got all these followers, people that are, you

695
00:30:28.125 --> 00:30:29.114
know, there are people who are interested in what

696
00:30:29.125 --> 00:30:31.060
they've got to say or what they're doing. Um

697
00:30:31.069 --> 00:30:33.599
So, so that makes it an incredibly valuable resource

698
00:30:33.609 --> 00:30:34.689
for human beings.

699
00:30:35.949 --> 00:30:38.479
Uh And I guess that's an interesting thing about

700
00:30:38.489 --> 00:30:42.530
social media is that you can very easily lie

701
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.599
to show yourself as being a little bit higher

702
00:30:45.609 --> 00:30:48.290
status than you really are, right? Like showing off

703
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:52.589
just your positive traits and hiding the negative traits

704
00:30:52.599 --> 00:30:56.849
or presenting your, your life as being just about

705
00:30:56.859 --> 00:31:00.099
positive things happening all the time when it's not

706
00:31:00.109 --> 00:31:01.290
really like that.

707
00:31:01.569 --> 00:31:03.670
Yeah, that's right. Perfectionist presentation. I mean, it's a

708
00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.229
massive issue, especially on, on sites like Instagram and

709
00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:09.829
it's a big issue for um, young people, especially

710
00:31:09.839 --> 00:31:11.900
on, on Instagram. Um, YOU know, they see these

711
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.000
perfect bodies living these perfect lives and they feel

712
00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.130
that they don't measure up. I mean, you know,

713
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.420
we, we human beings look to our social groups

714
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:22.050
to figure out what's acceptable, what's, what's, what's, what,

715
00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.589
what, what's acceptable. And so, you know, we evolved

716
00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:25.810
living side by side and there are more than

717
00:31:25.819 --> 00:31:29.050
50 people. So, so, so, so, so that, so

718
00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:32.729
we've evolved to have this very small live in

719
00:31:32.739 --> 00:31:36.109
this very small social world where um the models

720
00:31:36.119 --> 00:31:39.609
for w what is acceptable to look like weren't

721
00:31:39.619 --> 00:31:42.030
literally models but, but today we're exposed to the

722
00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.739
most talented, beautiful, successful, amazing people in the world

723
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.719
on a daily basis. So that, that's, that's not

724
00:31:47.729 --> 00:31:50.469
a great recipe for mental health,

725
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.400
right? So we've been talking mostly about people competing

726
00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:59.290
with other people that are part of the same

727
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.449
group that is in group competition, but there's also

728
00:32:02.609 --> 00:32:06.459
in group out group dynamics. Do social uh do

729
00:32:06.469 --> 00:32:09.729
status games also play a role there? Yeah,

730
00:32:09.739 --> 00:32:12.270
absolutely. So we, we, we, we play status games

731
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.959
within our group. We compete within our group to

732
00:32:13.969 --> 00:32:16.319
be the best member of the group. But status

733
00:32:16.329 --> 00:32:19.530
games play, play status games against other status games,

734
00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.589
you know, it's tribe against tribe. So Microsoft versus

735
00:32:21.599 --> 00:32:25.380
Apple Arsenal versus Man United, you know, whatever it

736
00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:28.089
might be. So, so, so, so yeah, it's, it's

737
00:32:28.099 --> 00:32:31.640
so, so, so, you know, we WW we have

738
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:35.130
this ability to draw status also from within our

739
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.839
group. When we do well within our group, we

740
00:32:36.849 --> 00:32:40.130
serve our group well, either virtuously or with competence,

741
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.270
we feel good. But also when our group wins,

742
00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.969
we draw status from the group. You know, we

743
00:32:43.979 --> 00:32:46.400
make that group part of our identity. And you

744
00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:49.000
see that most obviously in sports teams, you know,

745
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.589
you get this crazy thing in sports, I mean,

746
00:32:51.599 --> 00:32:52.910
in the UK, of course, it's all, it's a

747
00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.189
football country and you see these people every weekend

748
00:32:56.199 --> 00:32:59.209
going to football and weeping sometimes when their team

749
00:32:59.219 --> 00:33:00.949
loses, got nothing to do with it. It's not

750
00:33:00.959 --> 00:33:04.050
your fault. But, but, but, but, but it's, it's

751
00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.050
genuine emotional pain they go through when their team

752
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:09.270
loses and it's genuine ecstasy when their team, when

753
00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.939
their team wins. So you can see that their

754
00:33:10.949 --> 00:33:13.130
group, the group that they identify with is, is,

755
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.349
is part of their identity. It's actually a part

756
00:33:15.359 --> 00:33:17.209
of them and they feel it's losses and they

757
00:33:17.219 --> 00:33:19.670
feel it's wins as if it's happened directly to

758
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.810
them. So, so so and, and that's again, its

759
00:33:21.819 --> 00:33:27.369
manifestation of our unbelievably co-operative nature. As human beings,

760
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.109
you know, we, we are individuals but we all,

761
00:33:29.119 --> 00:33:31.770
but we are also members of groups.

762
00:33:33.109 --> 00:33:37.530
So even uh through your own group, identity, you

763
00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.280
can experience higher or lower status. So in the

764
00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:43.880
case of football teams, uh right now, if you

765
00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:48.209
are a fan of Manchester United, you probably feel

766
00:33:48.219 --> 00:33:50.489
lower status than someone who is a fan of

767
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.170
Manchester City. Right?

768
00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.250
That's right. That, that, that's exactly it. And that's,

769
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.250
and, and that's, that's the addiction of it. You

770
00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.969
know, like, like, you know, if you identify with

771
00:33:59.979 --> 00:34:03.290
a particular football team, then their wins and losses

772
00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.410
become your win, wins and losses. So you become

773
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.438
deeply interested in, in their wins and losses and

774
00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:12.618
it becomes, you know, a source of great, um

775
00:34:12.809 --> 00:34:16.069
as I say, great ecstasy, but also great um

776
00:34:16.118 --> 00:34:19.069
pain when, when, when the losses keep coming.

777
00:34:19.888 --> 00:34:24.148
Mhm So we've talked about how there are different

778
00:34:24.158 --> 00:34:27.678
uh status games occurring at the same time in

779
00:34:27.688 --> 00:34:31.069
different societies and how in different contexts they might

780
00:34:31.079 --> 00:34:34.059
play out in different way in different ways. But

781
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:37.217
uh is it the case that there are parti,

782
00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:42.800
for example, some societies where status games might be

783
00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.159
less pronounced, like for example, since we know that

784
00:34:46.168 --> 00:34:50.379
particularly in hunter gatherer societies, they seem to be

785
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:54.800
at least a little bit more egalitarian than agricultural

786
00:34:54.810 --> 00:35:01.020
societies, industrialized societies. Does, does egalitarianism equate uh less

787
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:03.100
competition for stables or

788
00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:05.800
not? Yeah. So, so, so wh wh when people

789
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.479
talk about egalitarian hunter gatherer groups. They sometimes imagine

790
00:35:09.489 --> 00:35:11.699
they're this kind of communist utopia. And that's not

791
00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:14.340
the case. The reason that there's not much differential

792
00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.350
between the bottom and the top and the hand

793
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.919
together groups, it's partly cos they're just very small

794
00:35:16.929 --> 00:35:19.610
groups. It's partly because they don't own, they tend,

795
00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.320
don't, don't tend to own property and, and it

796
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:23.850
was really when humans settled down and began to,

797
00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.300
began to own land and property that these big

798
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:29.389
status gains began to manifest itself. Uh, BUT it's

799
00:35:29.399 --> 00:35:32.600
mostly because, um, they're all extremely interested in the

800
00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.360
state of their own status and, and, and in

801
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:38.600
hunter gatherer groups, there are always norms, um, to

802
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:42.739
control other people's grabs for status. You know, pe

803
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.909
we always want to, you know, status is a

804
00:35:44.919 --> 00:35:47.729
resource. It's like food, it's like oxygen, we always

805
00:35:47.739 --> 00:35:50.169
wanna grab it for ourselves. Um, BUT, but it's

806
00:35:50.179 --> 00:35:52.530
also relative, the more you have, the less other

807
00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.459
people have, you know. So, so, so everybody is

808
00:35:55.469 --> 00:35:59.169
hotly policing everybody else's overt claims to status and,

809
00:35:59.179 --> 00:36:00.709
and, and, you know, in, in lots of unga

810
00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:05.489
groups, there are, um, uh, often quite, you know,

811
00:36:06.149 --> 00:36:10.169
savage, deadly, um, punishments for the kind of repeated,

812
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.149
um, unfair kind of overt claims to status. I

813
00:36:13.159 --> 00:36:14.250
mean, there's, some of them are quite funny. There

814
00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.820
was, I wrote about one of them, you know,

815
00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.879
in one Inuit group when, when someone is, you

816
00:36:18.889 --> 00:36:21.860
know, comes in like, you know, the big man.

817
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:24.500
They, they, they, they stand in a circle around

818
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.459
that person and sing a song of derision in

819
00:36:26.469 --> 00:36:28.219
their face in order to kind of put the

820
00:36:28.229 --> 00:36:30.280
buck in their place. So, so, so, so, so,

821
00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.280
so, yeah, that's that, you know, the, the, the,

822
00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.949
the egalitarianism, the hunter gatherer is, is not a,

823
00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:37.100
is not an indication that they are that they

824
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:39.260
don't, they aren't interested in status, that they're all

825
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.679
very interested in status. But it's a, they all

826
00:36:41.689 --> 00:36:44.840
make sure that everybody, nobody gets above their station.

827
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.300
Um Ve very keenly and b they didn't have

828
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.989
property, they didn't have land. There's no way of

829
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.449
manifesting and kind of storing status in the ways

830
00:36:52.459 --> 00:36:53.090
that we have.

831
00:36:53.699 --> 00:36:56.879
So in the book, you go through several different

832
00:36:56.889 --> 00:37:01.889
aspects of human societies that you argue status games

833
00:37:01.899 --> 00:37:04.760
can explain or play a role in like for

834
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:09.290
example, politics, morality, personal preferences, norms. Let's perhaps, uh

835
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.810
talk about two or three of those. Um Do

836
00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:17.709
status dynamics have any, every, any implications for personality

837
00:37:17.719 --> 00:37:21.560
development and our personal preferences?

838
00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.479
Yeah. So, II I think the way it works

839
00:37:24.489 --> 00:37:28.229
is that is that your personality type pushes you

840
00:37:28.239 --> 00:37:31.750
towards, you know, a successful failure in status games.

841
00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.530
But also how much you care about status games

842
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.629
and also the kind of status games you're gonna

843
00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:37.800
be playing. So of course, an in an introvert

844
00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:40.340
probably isn't gonna be wanting to, I don't know,

845
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.699
be a dancer or a stripper or something, you

846
00:37:42.709 --> 00:37:45.860
know, like that, that, that, you know, that that's

847
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:49.679
gonna be, um, manifesting also certain personality types, um,

848
00:37:49.689 --> 00:37:51.899
you know, ll people who are lower in disagree,

849
00:37:51.909 --> 00:37:55.800
who, who are disagreeable, lower in agreeableness. Um, uh,

850
00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:58.850
MORE competitive. Um, SO someone like Steve jobs very

851
00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.010
disagreeable man. Yes, everybody will agree. And, and, but

852
00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.979
that was part of the reason that he, he,

853
00:38:03.989 --> 00:38:06.300
he, that he tended to win. Um, AND, and

854
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:07.669
you, and you hear this all the time about,

855
00:38:07.679 --> 00:38:11.750
about people who, who, who, um, um, do very

856
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.820
well in, in kind of corporate status games is

857
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.709
that they, it's not just that they wanna win,

858
00:38:15.719 --> 00:38:17.340
they wanna crush the enemy into the dust, you

859
00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:20.250
know, they're very disagreeable. Uh, BUT also extroverts, extroverts

860
00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.639
tend to do better in status games because they

861
00:38:22.649 --> 00:38:26.139
are nice to be around, they're friendly, they're chatty.

862
00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.479
Um, PEOPLE wanna be around extroverts so they, they

863
00:38:28.489 --> 00:38:30.340
tend to do better kind of socially in status

864
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:30.820
games.

865
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:35.550
Uh, BUT about our personal preferences, what is the

866
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:40.469
connection there between our sta the status games we

867
00:38:40.479 --> 00:38:43.110
go through and our personal preferences?

868
00:38:43.719 --> 00:38:47.389
Yeah. So, um, II, I think, um, I think

869
00:38:47.399 --> 00:38:49.540
it's true to say that a, lots of, lots

870
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.850
of, of our preferences are genetic, you know, that

871
00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.590
there's a heavy genetic component into what our preferences

872
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.250
tend to be. So that's, of course, gonna steer

873
00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.000
us into, you know, one status game or another,

874
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:04.520
especially in, in the west where we have, um,

875
00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.060
you know, the system of going to school, going

876
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.540
to university and ho hopefully having uh uh uh

877
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:13.070
uh uh uh uh an ability to choose the

878
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.560
particular state game of life that we want to

879
00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.590
play. So, so, so, so we're much more able

880
00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.320
in the West, um, in the wealthy countries to,

881
00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:25.659
um, freely manifest our personalities in the kinds of

882
00:39:25.669 --> 00:39:26.760
status games that we play.

883
00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:31.840
Mhm. And when it comes to norms, that's also

884
00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:34.389
another thing you talk about in the book. At

885
00:39:34.399 --> 00:39:37.919
a certain point, you mentioned uh a survey of

886
00:39:37.929 --> 00:39:43.719
60 preorder societies where they uncovered seven common rules

887
00:39:43.729 --> 00:39:48.260
of play. Like uh for example, help your family,

888
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:51.739
help your group return favors, be brave, defer to

889
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:57.600
superiors, divide resources fairly and respect others property. Uh

890
00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:00.500
Where do these norms come from? When what do

891
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:03.169
they have to do with status games?

892
00:40:03.379 --> 00:40:06.179
Well, these are the kind of DNA basic rules

893
00:40:06.189 --> 00:40:09.760
of human cooper that, that, that, that have um

894
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:13.979
come into being over millions of years. Um And

895
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:18.669
they're really the kind of basic building blocks of

896
00:40:18.679 --> 00:40:22.129
how to be AAA human being. Um As I

897
00:40:22.139 --> 00:40:23.409
said, when we came down from the trees and

898
00:40:23.419 --> 00:40:26.219
we started living around campfires, we had to live

899
00:40:26.229 --> 00:40:30.290
in a community. And so these seven rules, tho

900
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.070
those those are the ways that humans have or

901
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.179
human evolution has figured out that we have to

902
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.179
living community. So, so that's where they've come from.

903
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.870
Um And then, of course, as we said before,

904
00:40:41.459 --> 00:40:43.270
the culture sort of sits on top of that

905
00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.550
as the kind of software that, that, that's the

906
00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.409
hardware, there's seven rules is the hardware and then

907
00:40:47.419 --> 00:40:49.729
there's a software that goes on top that, that,

908
00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.629
you know, if one of the rules is defer

909
00:40:51.639 --> 00:40:54.169
to superiors. Ok, how do we figure out who

910
00:40:54.179 --> 00:40:56.149
is a superior? And so there's like, you know,

911
00:40:56.159 --> 00:40:58.729
there's lots of cultural rules that, that go into

912
00:40:58.739 --> 00:40:59.070
that,

913
00:40:59.649 --> 00:41:03.870
right? And, but those are seven of the common

914
00:41:03.879 --> 00:41:06.610
norms that we can find across human societies. But

915
00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.060
toward the end of the book, you also talk

916
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:12.850
about seven rules of the status game. Would you

917
00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.100
like to tell us about them?

918
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.879
Yeah, sure. So, I mean, I, I wanted to

919
00:41:16.889 --> 00:41:19.270
kind of end the book with some practical stuff.

920
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.159
Um So, you know, some, some things that I

921
00:41:21.169 --> 00:41:24.439
kind of felt like I'd learned by digging in

922
00:41:24.449 --> 00:41:28.620
so deeply to status. Um And there's a few,

923
00:41:28.629 --> 00:41:32.520
like one of them is um just this idea

924
00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:36.229
that um we should be more free with the

925
00:41:36.239 --> 00:41:40.550
status that we give to other people. Um Status

926
00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.989
is this incredible resource, like it's more valuable to

927
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.449
us than gold. Um People die for, for, for,

928
00:41:46.459 --> 00:41:49.050
for their status and yet we, it's free, we

929
00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.399
have it to give to people. Um And, and

930
00:41:51.409 --> 00:41:54.860
we're often not very good at um are doing

931
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:57.290
that being kind of lavish and, and generous with

932
00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:59.500
the with, with, with the praise and the, the

933
00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.610
status that we give other people. So II, I

934
00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.969
think that's one of those things to, to understand

935
00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:06.340
that we have this gift to give others. Um

936
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:09.290
And, and the important thing is it's authentic. We,

937
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.739
we, we, we don't want to live in a

938
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:14.189
kind of horrible Los Angeles kind of type of

939
00:42:14.199 --> 00:42:16.709
society where everybody tells everybody they're awesome and amazing

940
00:42:16.719 --> 00:42:18.929
and then stumps them in the back, you know.

941
00:42:18.979 --> 00:42:20.709
Uh So, so I think that's one of them

942
00:42:20.719 --> 00:42:22.560
is, is, is to, is to, we, we should

943
00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:24.570
be, we should be much more kind of generous

944
00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:27.379
with our um with the status that we're giving

945
00:42:27.389 --> 00:42:33.870
other people. Uh Another one is that um about

946
00:42:33.879 --> 00:42:37.250
reducing our moral sphere. I, I think the easiest

947
00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.969
way of earning status is with virtue that y

948
00:42:40.149 --> 00:42:42.709
you know, you see that on social media, earning

949
00:42:42.719 --> 00:42:45.090
status based on competence and success is hard. You've

950
00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.270
got to become good at something and you've got

951
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.340
to become better than average really at something to

952
00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:50.469
properly earn status in that I I in that

953
00:42:50.479 --> 00:42:53.310
field, but virtue is easy. Virtue is just like

954
00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.590
this is what I believe and if you don't

955
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.129
believe it, you're a scum, you know, that, that,

956
00:42:56.139 --> 00:42:59.020
that's what that is. Um II I it's very

957
00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:02.030
easy to turn into a bully um when you're

958
00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.949
um trying to kind of harvest this kind of

959
00:43:04.959 --> 00:43:07.060
virtue based status. And, and, and so much of

960
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:09.070
social media, the worst parts of social media are

961
00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:13.479
people pushing each other around because they don't follow

962
00:43:13.489 --> 00:43:16.959
their own norms of behavior and what's acceptable. So,

963
00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:19.120
so, so, so i it's this idea of reducing

964
00:43:19.129 --> 00:43:21.669
your moral sphere, you know, like when you're morally

965
00:43:21.679 --> 00:43:24.820
judging, just turn your eyes down to yourself much

966
00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:27.659
more than you're looking at other people because because

967
00:43:27.669 --> 00:43:29.159
the reason you're looking at other people is because

968
00:43:29.169 --> 00:43:30.989
you're playing status games, that that's really what you're

969
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.010
doing. Um So, so, so I think reduc reducing

970
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.919
your moral sphere is a, is another really important

971
00:43:36.929 --> 00:43:39.270
one. I can, what, what I can't remember what

972
00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.000
the others were.

973
00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.030
Uh I, I think that I have, I have

974
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.000
them here. Another one is make small moments of

975
00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:47.889
prestige.

976
00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.040
That's right. Yeah. So, so, and make small moments

977
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.129
of prestige is really about um that kind of

978
00:43:54.139 --> 00:43:56.659
uh Larry David thing that we tend to do,

979
00:43:56.669 --> 00:43:58.790
especially as we get older where we, where we're

980
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:02.719
constantly moaning and bitching. Um And every time we

981
00:44:02.729 --> 00:44:04.600
do that, it's a, it's a little moment of

982
00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:07.590
dominance. You know, every time we, we theatrically s

983
00:44:07.659 --> 00:44:09.540
at somebody because they're taking too long to pay

984
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.879
with their coins in the shop. Um It's a

985
00:44:11.889 --> 00:44:14.330
moment of dominance. We're kind of, we're becoming that

986
00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.590
kind of animalistic self pushing each other around socially.

987
00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.820
Um A and it's much more valuable I think

988
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:23.899
to, to try and make, make these small moments

989
00:44:23.909 --> 00:44:25.989
of prestige where, where you're actually, as I said

990
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.729
before giving status to other uh other people in

991
00:44:28.739 --> 00:44:30.399
a, in a, in a free and generous way.

992
00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.280
And that, and that, that makes ourselves feel better.

993
00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:35.459
But it also rebounds on us because we then

994
00:44:35.469 --> 00:44:38.020
get a reputation as being AAA better person and

995
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:39.820
the person that other people want to be around.

996
00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.580
So it's really a massive win, win in making

997
00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:44.300
these small moments of prestige. You've just got to

998
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:48.050
remember to do it is, it can be difficult

999
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:48.580
sometimes.

1000
00:44:49.899 --> 00:44:52.209
So let's go through some of the other ones

1001
00:44:52.219 --> 00:44:55.719
and another one is play a hierarchy of games,

1002
00:44:55.729 --> 00:44:56.169
what you got.

1003
00:44:57.179 --> 00:45:02.110
So, um I think it's important to hedge your

1004
00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:07.370
bets. Um WITH status games, it's dangerous to just

1005
00:45:07.379 --> 00:45:09.810
play one game relentlessly all of your life because

1006
00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.520
then what happens inevitably when things start to go

1007
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:17.219
wrong with that game, you know, um I think

1008
00:45:17.229 --> 00:45:19.669
there's some natural hedging when you have Children that,

1009
00:45:19.679 --> 00:45:21.840
that something seems to happen when, when, when people

1010
00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:23.750
become parents that they start to play status games

1011
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.959
through their Children. And as long as that doesn't

1012
00:45:25.969 --> 00:45:28.159
get pathological, which it can very easily, you know,

1013
00:45:28.169 --> 00:45:30.429
like you, you've, you've become this kind of nightmare

1014
00:45:30.439 --> 00:45:35.370
parent who uh who um really, really feels every

1015
00:45:35.379 --> 00:45:37.149
win or loss that their child has and, and

1016
00:45:37.159 --> 00:45:40.080
becomes too pushy and unpleasant to them. As long

1017
00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:42.300
as that doesn't happen, it's actually very healthy because,

1018
00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:44.800
you know, you're getting your status from the this

1019
00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:47.139
variety of sources. But if you're like me, you

1020
00:45:47.149 --> 00:45:49.040
don't have Children, you just basically one thing which

1021
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.580
is right. That's really dangerous. Um So, so, so,

1022
00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:53.770
so it's about playing a playing, playing lots of

1023
00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.889
different status games and having lots of different sources

1024
00:45:55.899 --> 00:45:58.659
of status. And I mentioned before that I, you

1025
00:45:58.669 --> 00:46:00.000
know, was a Samaritan and the reason that I

1026
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.739
joined the Samaritans was directly because of this, um

1027
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:03.969
you know, I realized when I was writing the

1028
00:46:03.979 --> 00:46:06.760
book that you just, you're just doing one thing

1029
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:08.429
here with your whole life and, and it's not

1030
00:46:08.439 --> 00:46:10.639
gonna go on forever and it's just not, and

1031
00:46:10.649 --> 00:46:12.580
then what's gonna happen, what's gonna happen is you're

1032
00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.409
gonna have a nervous breakdown, you know, you're gonna

1033
00:46:14.419 --> 00:46:16.449
have a psychological collapse if I, if, if all

1034
00:46:16.459 --> 00:46:18.669
this goes wrong, so joining Sam, I would never

1035
00:46:18.679 --> 00:46:20.830
have been the kind of person to volunteer before.

1036
00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.610
So, so joining the Samaritans was, was a very

1037
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:26.639
conscious way of um playing a different kind of

1038
00:46:26.649 --> 00:46:28.760
status game and, and thinking, oh, well, you know,

1039
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:30.600
you need to have sort of different sources of

1040
00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:32.379
status in your life and different sources of meaning.

1041
00:46:33.649 --> 00:46:36.709
Mhm. Uh And do you think that particularly when

1042
00:46:36.719 --> 00:46:40.830
it comes to volunteering that perhaps learning more about

1043
00:46:40.879 --> 00:46:44.129
these status games that we go through in human

1044
00:46:44.139 --> 00:46:47.969
societies and how they can affect people in different

1045
00:46:47.979 --> 00:46:52.560
ways may be more empathetic towards people who are

1046
00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:56.120
perhaps lower status and that's bec, uh, that's one

1047
00:46:56.129 --> 00:46:58.070
of the main reasons why they are suffering.

1048
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.570
Yeah. Absolutely. Um, YOU know, one of the things

1049
00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.860
that I've, that I've brought with me to the

1050
00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.800
Samarin is this understanding of the importance of status

1051
00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:09.550
and, and when I'm talking to people who are

1052
00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:13.800
very, very depressed and in despair, um, it's amazing

1053
00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:17.250
the effect that, that giving them some compliments has

1054
00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:19.020
on them. Like it, like it, like it's almost

1055
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:22.050
like a magic spell. Um And I, and as

1056
00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.889
I said before, it's important, it's authentic because we're,

1057
00:47:24.899 --> 00:47:27.399
we're very good. Humans are very tuned to inauthentic,

1058
00:47:27.409 --> 00:47:30.100
you know, spotting in authentic stuff. Um We're very

1059
00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:32.290
tuned to bullshit in that way. But, but when

1060
00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.399
you're listening to them talk and you're, you're thinking

1061
00:47:34.409 --> 00:47:36.419
about, ok. Is it, what, what are some things

1062
00:47:36.429 --> 00:47:39.399
that I can say that about this person? You

1063
00:47:39.409 --> 00:47:41.300
sound very like a caring person. This thing that

1064
00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:43.560
you told me about is such a, such an

1065
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:46.100
amazing, courageous thing you did or you're really obviously

1066
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.979
a really smart person, like, you know, whatever it

1067
00:47:47.989 --> 00:47:51.870
is and it has this kind of magical effect

1068
00:47:51.879 --> 00:47:54.199
almost like you, you just, and it's not like

1069
00:47:54.209 --> 00:47:56.500
99% of the time. It's like 100% of the

1070
00:47:56.510 --> 00:48:00.330
time. WW when you give people a genuine compliment

1071
00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.580
that, that you really mean. It, it, it has

1072
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:05.840
it. Yeah, it's, I, I, it's incredibly powerful and

1073
00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:07.320
it's in those moments, you really, see you, you

1074
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:09.939
really, you really feel the power of status like

1075
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:13.689
it, it's like giving somebody who's starving, um, a

1076
00:48:13.699 --> 00:48:16.080
piece of chocolate like it, you just think God,

1077
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:18.030
that is what they need. You know, they, they,

1078
00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.820
they, they, they're, they're living a life which has

1079
00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:21.949
relentlessly told them that they're useless and they have

1080
00:48:21.959 --> 00:48:24.879
no value. Um, AND it's also made me realize,

1081
00:48:24.889 --> 00:48:28.620
um, uh, y you know, uh, why old people,

1082
00:48:28.629 --> 00:48:30.919
they, they, they, they feel that they're a burden.

1083
00:48:30.929 --> 00:48:32.100
You hear that word all the time. I'm a

1084
00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:33.760
burden, I'm a burden. I'm a burden. I'm a

1085
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:35.810
burden. And it seems to be like this very

1086
00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:39.520
common fear of old people and, and, and, and,

1087
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:41.209
and a, and a very common source of anxiety

1088
00:48:41.219 --> 00:48:43.500
and depression to older people. And again, I think

1089
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:46.139
that's, that's about status. It's like we, we have

1090
00:48:46.149 --> 00:48:49.080
evolved to be um valuable members of, to feel

1091
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:51.719
like valuable members of our groups. And uh and

1092
00:48:51.729 --> 00:48:53.350
I think that the, the thing that old people

1093
00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.530
feel when they're in those terrible states is, is

1094
00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.709
that they're not, I'm not valuable anymore. And that's

1095
00:48:57.719 --> 00:48:59.429
what they're saying when they're saying I'm a burden

1096
00:48:59.439 --> 00:49:01.909
like I'm being carried here, I'm not carrying anybody

1097
00:49:01.919 --> 00:49:03.770
else. And that the fact that that is a

1098
00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.750
source of absolute despair to so many people, I

1099
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.469
think, I think tells us an awful lot about

1100
00:49:08.479 --> 00:49:10.729
the importance of status to the human animal.

1101
00:49:12.219 --> 00:49:14.810
Uh And when it comes to younger people. I

1102
00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:19.100
would imagine that uh if they're suffering from depression,

1103
00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:22.350
it could be because they might have lost at

1104
00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:26.649
specific status games. Like, for example, they didn't, they

1105
00:49:26.659 --> 00:49:31.800
weren't able to get uh high status job. For

1106
00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:35.520
example, they might be earning very little and they

1107
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:38.479
might also feel like they are a burden to,

1108
00:49:38.489 --> 00:49:41.699
I don't know their family or people around them

1109
00:49:41.709 --> 00:49:42.320
in general.

1110
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:44.260
That's right. I mean, and I think one of

1111
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:46.239
the important things is, is to underline is that,

1112
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:48.469
is that when we talk about status, it's not

1113
00:49:48.479 --> 00:49:50.600
that most people want to be super successful. Most

1114
00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:52.500
people just wanna be fine, they just want to

1115
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:54.860
be respected, valued. It's not that they want to

1116
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:57.280
be a superstar. Um But, but, but of course

1117
00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:59.949
you get um yeah, young people, it's, well, you

1118
00:49:59.959 --> 00:50:02.310
know, it, it, it, it's a terrible thing. It's,

1119
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.659
it's no, it's no coincidence that when you look

1120
00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:08.729
at school shooters in America, they tend to be

1121
00:50:08.739 --> 00:50:13.090
unattractive, unpopular, bullied and a bit weird. They, they,

1122
00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.060
they've been relentlessly made to feel low status and

1123
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:18.929
then they respond by destroying the source of their

1124
00:50:18.939 --> 00:50:23.649
humiliation. WW, we are um uh one of the

1125
00:50:23.659 --> 00:50:26.239
worst things to be called in our current culture

1126
00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:29.810
is an Incel. Um You know, somebody who's in

1127
00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.860
an involuntary celibate but, but you know, these are

1128
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:36.030
angry, rageful, unpleasant men, but they are also men

1129
00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.590
suffering an enormous amount of pain because they are

1130
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.659
fat, they are ugly, they are unwanted, they are

1131
00:50:41.669 --> 00:50:45.340
despised and, and, and that is a horrendous place

1132
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:47.969
for people to be. But because they're men, we

1133
00:50:47.979 --> 00:50:50.120
don't have any sympathy for them. Uh, YOU know,

1134
00:50:50.129 --> 00:50:51.639
we, we, we, we, we actually, you know, we,

1135
00:50:51.649 --> 00:50:52.840
we do everything we can to actually make them

1136
00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:54.919
feel worse. And of course they're, they're, you know,

1137
00:50:54.929 --> 00:50:58.639
o often, um, their, their rage and despair manifest

1138
00:50:58.649 --> 00:51:01.729
as misogyny. So, so, you know, there, there's every

1139
00:51:01.739 --> 00:51:04.219
reason to, to be, to, to, to be up,

1140
00:51:04.229 --> 00:51:05.989
be upset about that. But, but the core of

1141
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.870
it is this absolute despair and this enormous pain

1142
00:51:08.879 --> 00:51:09.739
that these people are in.

1143
00:51:10.739 --> 00:51:13.600
Mhm When you say that because they are men,

1144
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:17.000
we don't care about them as much. Perhaps you're

1145
00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:21.760
referring to the work by Tanya Reynolds where I

1146
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:25.429
ca I can't remember the exact uh terminology there,

1147
00:51:25.439 --> 00:51:29.840
but she refers to uh so uh phenomenon, psychological

1148
00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:33.719
phenomenon where we tend to be less empathetic toward

1149
00:51:33.729 --> 00:51:35.080
men than women.

1150
00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.270
That's right. That's right. I mean, and it's really,

1151
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.929
there, there's also the, what's known as the women

1152
00:51:39.939 --> 00:51:43.659
are wonderful effect where um when you survey men

1153
00:51:43.669 --> 00:51:45.939
and women, everybody thinks that women are better than

1154
00:51:45.949 --> 00:51:49.060
men, including the men. Like, you know, pe people,

1155
00:51:49.389 --> 00:51:52.500
you know, I think that the very simplistic idea

1156
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:55.290
of the patriarchy is, is, is very cartoonish and

1157
00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:58.260
very shallow. I, I, you know, like, yes, there

1158
00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:00.070
are advantages to being men, but there are also

1159
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.439
lots of advantages to being women. And one of

1160
00:52:01.449 --> 00:52:03.179
the major advantages is that people care about your

1161
00:52:03.189 --> 00:52:06.159
pain, they care about your issues. Um They value

1162
00:52:06.169 --> 00:52:08.649
your life more. Um So, so, so there are

1163
00:52:08.659 --> 00:52:11.850
a whole host of advantages of, of, of um

1164
00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:15.030
yy, you know, being female, ever being male. Uh

1165
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.899
YOU know, some at an extreme. Um WHEN, when

1166
00:52:18.909 --> 00:52:22.899
you hear lots of modern feminists talk about men,

1167
00:52:22.909 --> 00:52:25.699
they just sound like the Incels sound when they're

1168
00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:27.689
talking about women. But if a man, man does

1169
00:52:27.699 --> 00:52:29.100
it, they're called an Incel. But if a woman

1170
00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:31.919
does it, they're, they're celebrated as a feminist. So,

1171
00:52:31.929 --> 00:52:34.389
you know, that's that kind of weird double standard.

1172
00:52:34.399 --> 00:52:37.830
We have, um, um, II I, you know, in

1173
00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.209
our culture and I, and I think one of

1174
00:52:39.219 --> 00:52:42.040
one of them is, is because of this women,

1175
00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:44.280
women, a wonderful effect. We just, we, we just

1176
00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:46.929
prefer women, men and women tend to prefer women

1177
00:52:47.219 --> 00:52:49.050
and care more about what female pain and female

1178
00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:49.540
issues.

1179
00:52:50.729 --> 00:52:53.270
Well, there are also, of course, there are fewer

1180
00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.729
in number, but there are also some fem cells.

1181
00:52:56.739 --> 00:53:00.070
Uh, THAT is female celibates. So there is also

1182
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:00.610
that phenomenon.

1183
00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:04.639
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1184
00:53:04.649 --> 00:53:07.870
Yeah. Yes, undoubtedly. But, but we don't really hear

1185
00:53:07.879 --> 00:53:10.239
about them very much in that, in our, in

1186
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:11.030
our, in our newspapers.

1187
00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:16.070
Yeah. That's right. That's right. So let me ask

1188
00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:20.239
you about one more rule of the status game

1189
00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.879
that you suggest to the end of your book,

1190
00:53:22.889 --> 00:53:26.570
be different. What does it mean to be different

1191
00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:27.800
in this context?

1192
00:53:28.169 --> 00:53:29.909
So, being different, I think, I, I, you know,

1193
00:53:29.919 --> 00:53:33.300
yeah. So I think it's really important um to

1194
00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:35.669
understand that when we're playing competence games, when we're

1195
00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:40.239
playing success games, sometimes, um it isn't just about

1196
00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:44.260
relentlessly competing to be as good as you can

1197
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:46.770
at the thing that you're trying to be. Sometimes

1198
00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.010
it's iyy, you, you can win by being different

1199
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.419
by trying something creative and different as long as

1200
00:53:51.429 --> 00:53:54.459
you're still contributing to the group. And I almost

1201
00:53:54.469 --> 00:53:57.600
think that's the definition of genius really, especially if

1202
00:53:57.610 --> 00:53:59.659
you think about the creative arts, somebody who tries

1203
00:53:59.669 --> 00:54:01.330
to do something a bit different, something like Lars

1204
00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:03.729
Von Trier in the film business. Uh AND the

1205
00:54:03.739 --> 00:54:05.929
Dog May directors when you try to do something

1206
00:54:05.939 --> 00:54:09.729
different and it works like, um that's the, anybody

1207
00:54:09.739 --> 00:54:10.790
can do something different. But if you do something

1208
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:15.020
different and it works, um you know, that's, that's

1209
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:17.810
genius. That, that, that's, that, that's, that, that's brilliant.

1210
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.830
So, so I think that's a, it's like a

1211
00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.639
liberating thought really? That, that, that it isn't just

1212
00:54:23.649 --> 00:54:26.639
about kind of this remorseless treadmill of getting better

1213
00:54:26.649 --> 00:54:29.100
and better and better. It's also why don't you

1214
00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:30.510
try to do something a bit different, do something

1215
00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.989
different to other people and see if you can

1216
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:32.989
make it work that way.

1217
00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:38.530
Yeah, maybe you can even create a new form

1218
00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:41.040
of status game or a different status game. But

1219
00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:43.850
I don't know, perhaps, uh a new sort of

1220
00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:48.060
professional activity where you're the pioneer. And so you

1221
00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:51.429
immediately are of higher students. Something

1222
00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.370
that right. And, and I think that's what geniuses

1223
00:54:53.379 --> 00:54:55.209
do, isn't it? It's like, you know, when, when,

1224
00:54:55.219 --> 00:54:57.850
when I know, I know Steve Jobs didn't invent

1225
00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:59.530
the iphone, but when Apple invented the iphone, they

1226
00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:01.290
created a new category. So there's a new status

1227
00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:03.129
game who can make the best phone and, and,

1228
00:55:03.139 --> 00:55:06.010
and that's generative that gives us Google pixels and

1229
00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.090
Samsung phones and all that other, other sort of

1230
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.389
very competitive and in lots of ways better than

1231
00:55:11.399 --> 00:55:13.830
the iphone phones. And, you know, in the creative

1232
00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.639
arts, it's mentioned last Von Trier and their kind

1233
00:55:15.649 --> 00:55:19.270
of dogma film method of filmmaking with, you know,

1234
00:55:19.419 --> 00:55:22.120
no artificial lights and they had all these rules.

1235
00:55:22.129 --> 00:55:23.399
Uh uh AS I say, how we're going to

1236
00:55:23.409 --> 00:55:25.370
kind of de Hollywood the film business and that

1237
00:55:25.379 --> 00:55:26.790
creates a new status game. You can be the

1238
00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:30.010
best dogma filmmaker. Um WW we which was responsible

1239
00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:32.590
for some amazing art, you know, 1020 years ago.

1240
00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:35.610
So, um so, so yeah, that, that's absolutely right.

1241
00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:38.659
I think you're right about that. It's um it's

1242
00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:40.979
a sign that you're doing something brilliant if you're,

1243
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.879
if you're creating new status games.

1244
00:55:44.239 --> 00:55:48.159
So one last question, then, of course, we talked

1245
00:55:48.169 --> 00:55:52.540
about how status games can also be about some

1246
00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:56.659
prosocial trades. So it's not always about conflict and

1247
00:55:56.669 --> 00:56:01.510
competition, but uh there are people that perhaps are

1248
00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:05.979
dot Don't like competition too much and they would,

1249
00:56:05.989 --> 00:56:09.620
uh like to live in a society perhaps where

1250
00:56:09.629 --> 00:56:14.540
we would move beyond status and not care so

1251
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:17.320
much about it. Do, do you think that that

1252
00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:21.159
would be possible? And if so w should we

1253
00:56:21.169 --> 00:56:22.429
want that or not?

1254
00:56:22.689 --> 00:56:24.520
Yeah, I mean, it's not possible. It's just, it

1255
00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:27.580
is completely impossible because status games are built into

1256
00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:30.270
the, the structure of our brain. You know, there,

1257
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.129
there's something called the visual dominance ratio which is

1258
00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:36.310
um the um the uh uh uh the, the

1259
00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.939
ratio by which the higher status person talking will

1260
00:56:38.949 --> 00:56:41.790
make eye contact with the lowest status person and,

1261
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.030
and you know, ss so there's also something called

1262
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.659
the para herbal frequency band where the high status

1263
00:56:47.669 --> 00:56:53.260
person will, who speak using one sort of tone

1264
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:56.899
which is inaudible to the conscious ear as it

1265
00:56:56.909 --> 00:56:59.389
were and the other person will match. So even

1266
00:56:59.399 --> 00:57:01.449
on these very subconscious levels, the way we're talking,

1267
00:57:01.459 --> 00:57:02.840
the way we, we doing eye content that we're

1268
00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:05.399
not even consciously aware of. We're making status games,

1269
00:57:05.409 --> 00:57:06.959
not just that we're playing them, we're making them

1270
00:57:06.969 --> 00:57:09.129
happen. You know, you put, you put, you put

1271
00:57:09.139 --> 00:57:11.209
three people in a room, let them chat for

1272
00:57:11.219 --> 00:57:13.409
15 minutes. They will establish a status game. You

1273
00:57:13.419 --> 00:57:15.760
can't help it, you cannot eradicate status from the

1274
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:18.590
human condition is partly what we do. And the

1275
00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:19.709
other thing I would say is that why would

1276
00:57:19.719 --> 00:57:21.949
you want to? So, so yeah, you know, the,

1277
00:57:21.959 --> 00:57:23.830
the, the, the kind of remorseless pursuit of status

1278
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.149
can be very damaging, virtue games can be evil.

1279
00:57:27.159 --> 00:57:28.290
I mean, we haven't talked about it but in

1280
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.449
the book, as you know, I write about status

1281
00:57:30.459 --> 00:57:33.459
is um, man, I keep saying manifestation, it's just

1282
00:57:33.469 --> 00:57:37.550
really annoying me how status uh emerges in um

1283
00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:42.020
uh even in um spree killings in honor killings

1284
00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:44.379
in ho in, in um um uh in the

1285
00:57:44.389 --> 00:57:47.620
Holocaust uh in the communist horrors of the Soviet

1286
00:57:47.629 --> 00:57:49.949
Union. Um So, so, so yeah, it can be

1287
00:57:49.959 --> 00:57:53.189
a terrible thing. But ultimately, status is our, I

1288
00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:55.620
I is our instinct to want to feel valued

1289
00:57:55.629 --> 00:57:58.239
by the human family. So why would you want

1290
00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:01.399
to eradicate that status is what is what builds

1291
00:58:01.409 --> 00:58:04.790
civilisations. It's what makes us literally better people. It's

1292
00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.419
what makes us care about other people. And it's

1293
00:58:06.429 --> 00:58:09.040
what makes us put the tribe, tribes interests before

1294
00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:11.989
our own interests. You know, status is we, we

1295
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.429
focus on all the negatives uh which is good

1296
00:58:14.439 --> 00:58:16.679
because it helps us fix the negatives. But, but,

1297
00:58:16.689 --> 00:58:18.780
but we, we should focus more on the positives

1298
00:58:18.879 --> 00:58:21.120
and kind of make status less of a taboo

1299
00:58:21.219 --> 00:58:24.139
thing. You know, it's good that we pursue status.

1300
00:58:24.149 --> 00:58:25.959
It's good that we wanna compete to be who's

1301
00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:28.629
the best uh most virtuous person who can donate

1302
00:58:28.639 --> 00:58:30.679
the most money, who can create the best vaccine?

1303
00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:33.590
It's good that we compete. So who can uh

1304
00:58:33.659 --> 00:58:36.620
yy, you know, build the fastest car, the most

1305
00:58:36.629 --> 00:58:40.629
efficient, the hailing taxi ride system. All of those

1306
00:58:40.639 --> 00:58:43.639
things that we do um are, are kind of

1307
00:58:43.649 --> 00:58:47.639
fueled by this need. We have uh to feel

1308
00:58:47.649 --> 00:58:49.929
valued and respected by other people. And that's one

1309
00:58:49.939 --> 00:58:51.939
of the best things there is about the human

1310
00:58:51.949 --> 00:58:52.360
being.

1311
00:58:54.149 --> 00:58:57.770
So when it comes to status games, is there

1312
00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:01.320
a final message you would have about them or

1313
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:04.449
perhaps something important that I might have missed in

1314
00:59:04.459 --> 00:59:05.620
my questions?

1315
00:59:05.939 --> 00:59:09.229
Well, iii, I think, I, I think there's a

1316
00:59:09.239 --> 00:59:13.479
paradoxical thing about status, which is, I think you

1317
00:59:13.489 --> 00:59:17.149
should take it really seriously because um, it's the

1318
00:59:17.159 --> 00:59:20.169
source of meaning in your life outside your Children

1319
00:59:20.179 --> 00:59:22.659
and your, you know, your dogs or whatever the

1320
00:59:22.669 --> 00:59:24.159
status is, the source of meaning in your life.

1321
00:59:24.169 --> 00:59:25.760
It's gonna give you your greatest pictures. It's gonna

1322
00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:27.760
give you your life rhythm and purpose and a

1323
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:31.989
direction. But also paradoxically, don't take it too seriously.

1324
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.989
Like it, it, it's just a game like it's

1325
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.340
just a game that you're playing to, that, that

1326
00:59:37.350 --> 00:59:39.530
you're programmed to play in order to make you

1327
00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:41.090
feel like you've got to have, you're having this

1328
00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:44.199
meaningful life. So there, there are lots of times

1329
00:59:44.209 --> 00:59:46.260
in your life when you feel in absolute despair

1330
00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:48.500
because something has gone wrong, you feel humiliated, you

1331
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:51.750
feel embarrassed, you've, you've lost in some way. And

1332
00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.179
I think in those moments, it, it, it, it,

1333
00:59:53.189 --> 00:59:55.969
it's worth remembering. It's just a game, it's just

1334
00:59:55.979 --> 00:59:57.600
a game. And then round the corner, there will

1335
00:59:57.610 --> 00:59:59.899
be another moment where you feel valued and respected

1336
00:59:59.909 --> 01:00:00.800
and you get it back again.

1337
01:00:02.159 --> 01:00:05.780
Great. So let's send on that message then and

1338
01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:08.919
the book is again the status game on human

1339
01:00:08.929 --> 01:00:11.110
life and how to play it. I'm leaving a

1340
01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.439
