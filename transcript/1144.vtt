00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:03.279
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:06.250
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes and

3
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.920
today I'm joined by Doctor Nikil Choudhury. He's lecturer

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.800
in in human evolutionary and behavioral ecology in the

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.639
Department of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge. And

6
00:00:17.639 --> 00:00:21.040
today we're going to explore topics like cooperation in

7
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.280
human societies, social learning processes, breathing systems, and evolutionary

8
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.440
psychiatry. So, Doctor Choudary, welcome to the show. It's

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.440
a pleasure to have you on.

10
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.580
Thanks for having me. Look forward to the chow.

11
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.150
So, I would like to start by asking you

12
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.659
a bit about cooperation in human societies. First of

13
00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.669
all, how do you approach it from an evolutionary

14
00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:51.169
perspective? What are its evolutionary basis?

15
00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.290
So, I think the first thing to outline is

16
00:00:57.779 --> 00:01:02.479
why people want to study human cooperation. So. The

17
00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.610
term is actually used in many different ways, uh,

18
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.400
partly because it's such an interesting phenomenon. You have

19
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.400
mathematicians working on this, economists, but in biology, um,

20
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.199
even, even within evolutionary biology, people define it slightly

21
00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:21.739
differently. But I think when we're thinking about the

22
00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:26.120
reason why it's interesting, we could define it in

23
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.370
the same way as we might define altruism. Which

24
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.129
is when an organism incurs a cost to their

25
00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:38.160
evolutionary fitness, to provide a benefit to another organism

26
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.089
or other multiple other organisms. So that immediately creates

27
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.419
a paradox, right? If, if you think that if

28
00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:52.970
by definition behavior which incurs a cost to the

29
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.089
fitness of the individual to uh convey a cost

30
00:01:58.089 --> 00:02:01.849
to another individual, then that behavior should be selected

31
00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:06.419
out by, by definition, uh, which is really. Why

32
00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:10.740
evolutionists are interested in understanding the phenomenon of cooperative

33
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.059
or altruistic behavior. And we see that across the

34
00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:17.979
animal kingdom, even bacteria, we, we see this form

35
00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:23.199
of cooperation going on. But the reason anthropologists are

36
00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:27.729
particularly interested in studying human cooperation. Is that it

37
00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:32.009
has a couple of unique features, um, generally, in

38
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:36.649
the animal kingdom, cooperation tends to be heavily focused

39
00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:41.820
within genetically related individuals. Um, BUT not always, actually,

40
00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.770
not always at all. There are certainly cases where.

41
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.940
It's not exclusive, but the extent and ubiquity of

42
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.740
cooperation between unrelated individuals and humans is unparalleled, and

43
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.889
the other is the scale of it, the fact

44
00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.690
that we cooperate with individuals we don't even know,

45
00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:05.820
and for various theoretical reasons, that's, that's quite surprising.

46
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.649
So, uh, in your work, you've done some work,

47
00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:16.320
uh, when it comes to relational wealth. Tell us

48
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.020
about that concept. Uh, I mean, it's relational wealth

49
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.410
for differential access to cooperation. What is it?

50
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.649
Yeah, so there was a nice. Paper in 2010

51
00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:36.660
or 2012 by Monique Borgerhoff Mulder and colleagues, and

52
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.630
I think they were just trying to make the

53
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.309
point that too often when analyzing wealth, we focus

54
00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:47.190
on material wealth, but if we want to understand.

55
00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:52.979
The effects on fitness or well-being across societies, we

56
00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.979
can conceptualize wealth in multiple domains. So you have

57
00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:58.339
material wealth, which is the wealth we're all familiar

58
00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:02.100
with, then embodied wealth, which is any form of

59
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.580
wealth which is kept in the body, so that

60
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.619
could be physical fitness or strength, but also in

61
00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:12.020
the brain, so skill and knowledge, and then finally

62
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.279
relational wealth, which broadly. Uh, ANY benefits you can

63
00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:21.010
have through your social network and from an evolutionary

64
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.799
perspective we're principally interested in benefits to your evolutionary

65
00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:29.670
fitness that one can derive from, from a social

66
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.720
network and in humans and particularly hunter-gatherers who, who

67
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.170
I've worked with. I, I use relational wealth really

68
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.369
to focus on the fact that individuals vary in

69
00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:47.130
their access to cooperative partnerships, and they're such a

70
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.929
cooperative species, that of course is important for, for

71
00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:51.540
fitness.

72
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.709
And there's interindividual variability in relational wealth. What do

73
00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:03.070
we know about it and what aspects of our

74
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.649
sociality does it play a role in?

75
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.010
Um, WELL, to some degree, the, for our sociality,

76
00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:16.010
you could argue it, it's fundamental, right? When we're

77
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.290
thinking about the evolution of any trait, we're talking

78
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:27.269
about variability. Competitive advantage and heritability. So if you

79
00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:32.390
have inter interindividual variation in relational wealth, if that

80
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.309
does have any effects for fitness and does have

81
00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:39.339
any heritable component, whether that be genetic or cultural,

82
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.649
then a selective process can emerge, and in humans,

83
00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:46.910
as I say, Uh, if we want to understand

84
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.549
the fact that humans are so hyper-social and in

85
00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:54.260
particular this feature of sociality I referred to earlier,

86
00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:59.670
which is that humans, um, the ubiquity to which

87
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.309
we form social and cooperative relationships beyond our kinship

88
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:09.649
group, beyond our genetic relatives. Uh, To understand that

89
00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:13.910
we really need to understand. In, in deep history,

90
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.970
how is it that this variation in relational wealth

91
00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:23.440
has impacted fitness? Um, WHAT does this variability actually

92
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.690
have uh consequences for evolutionary fitness? And we'd expect

93
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.690
in such a hyper cooperative species that that it

94
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.670
probably does. Right.

95
00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:40.890
So getting into another topic, what are social learning

96
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.799
processes and what different kinds are there?

97
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.170
Just, just, uh, if we're moving on, I should

98
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.970
probably perhaps I, I didn't fully answer your question

99
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.579
in terms of what we know, not just theoretically,

100
00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:56.290
but, but the facts of the matter with, with

101
00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.029
relation to wealth, which is that A lot of

102
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:03.269
my previous work was looking at this in hunter-gatherer

103
00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:06.700
societies, and I'm sure many of your listeners already

104
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.350
know that because we lived as hunter-gatherers for the

105
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.549
vast majority of our evolutionary history, to understand the

106
00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:19.829
selective pressures and the, the drivers of our evolutionary

107
00:07:19.829 --> 00:07:23.230
trajectory, we can study contemporary hunter-gatherers. Now there are

108
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.579
a lot of assumptions in that, which I won't

109
00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:29.149
go into here. But I was working a lot

110
00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:34.230
on trying to understand whether the variability between individuals

111
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.109
and relational wealth had actually testing whether it had

112
00:07:37.109 --> 00:07:41.019
consequences for fitness and the hunter-gatherer societies, and indeed

113
00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:45.350
I found it did. So one of the primary

114
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.609
selection pressures on cooperation and social behavior in our

115
00:07:49.609 --> 00:07:55.420
species was the fact that, Unlike, say, chimpanzees who

116
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.369
rely heavily on collected foods which are readily available

117
00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:02.959
from the environment, so generally the hunting and gathering,

118
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:08.170
foraging niche that our species began to occupy is

119
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:12.859
characterized by high unpredictability, right? Leaves are readily abundant,

120
00:08:13.049 --> 00:08:17.010
but getting meat. It's really unpredictable. If you look

121
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:21.250
at success rates in hunter-gatherer societies of getting meat,

122
00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:24.720
they can vary, but in somewhere like the Hadza,

123
00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:28.899
for example, with big game. It's only every 30

124
00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:31.649
hunts that a man might come back with something.

125
00:08:31.899 --> 00:08:35.570
So if you've got that unpredictability, it doesn't matter

126
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.460
how good a hunter you are, you will not

127
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.979
get food frequently enough to provide for yourself and

128
00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:48.010
your family. So developing these. Social networks, if you

129
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.250
think about dealing with nutritional unpredictability, but whenever you've

130
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.770
got high unpredictability, the best, what you want is

131
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.719
breath, so you want to expand your social network

132
00:08:59.719 --> 00:09:02.090
because it gives you more insurance, so if I've

133
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.309
got, You know, 10 really close friends living in

134
00:09:05.309 --> 00:09:07.950
my camp. As long as one of those 10

135
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.450
finds like a solid bit of meat one day,

136
00:09:10.469 --> 00:09:12.390
I'm gonna get to eat and then when I

137
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.789
get food, I'll share with, with the rest of

138
00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:20.400
my friends, so really, It was this unpredictability in

139
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.599
our shift towards hunting and gathering, foraging niche that

140
00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:28.200
drove the evolution of our hypersociality. And what I

141
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.080
was demonstrating, and what I found was indeed people

142
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.320
with larger social networks in hunter-gatherer societies, um, I

143
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.760
found they had higher BMI, which is exactly what

144
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.289
we'd expect, because they have more stable access to

145
00:09:43.289 --> 00:09:48.700
uh to food. And the, the females had higher

146
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.460
fertility for age. They were having more offspring, so

147
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.140
an actual fitness effect. And interestingly, the males, um,

148
00:09:56.419 --> 00:09:59.780
it was in hunter-gatherer societies, there's a lot of

149
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.619
variation, but typically you see serial monogamy, so it's

150
00:10:04.619 --> 00:10:07.900
quite rare for men to have multiple wives simultaneously

151
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.219
or women to have multiple husbands simultaneously. But the

152
00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:14.580
low proportion of men who had had multiple wives

153
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.250
simultaneously in the communities I worked with were the

154
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.309
men with really high levels of relational wealth or

155
00:10:21.309 --> 00:10:25.260
social capital. So they were actually able to afford

156
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.510
having more offspring and supporting these multiple families because

157
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.500
they have this really large social network, so they

158
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.940
could deal with the unpredictability. So that was, I

159
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:42.909
would say quite, Nice evidence that OK, having expansion

160
00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:46.789
of the social networks in a hunter-gatherer context actually

161
00:10:46.789 --> 00:10:49.690
increases the evolutionary fitness. Right.

162
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.830
So what are social learning processes then?

163
00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:02.599
Social learning just, well, from an evolutionary perspective, when

164
00:11:02.599 --> 00:11:07.809
we're thinking about. Uh, BEHAVIORAL outputs. These could either

165
00:11:07.809 --> 00:11:13.679
be purely genetically, uh, programmed, so they're just guaranteed

166
00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:16.159
to happen. It, it's already in the DNA of

167
00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:20.780
the organism, or they could require learning where, uh,

168
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.000
I mean, there are different modes of learning, but

169
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.979
that could be individual learning or social learning. So

170
00:11:26.979 --> 00:11:32.039
social learning just refers to any knowledge or skills

171
00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:38.030
or information I gather. From another individual, and that

172
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.460
can, that can take numerous forms. I mean, the

173
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.309
most common. And most relevant things to think about

174
00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:50.710
here are probably emulation, imitation, and teaching. So these

175
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:57.700
are three modes of social learning. And Imitation, as

176
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.539
you might expect is literally what, as, as we

177
00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:03.500
say colloquially, I observe and I try and do

178
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.729
what the other individual is doing. Emulation is more

179
00:12:07.729 --> 00:12:12.330
goal oriented than process oriented. So with imitation you're

180
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.400
very much copying the process, whereas emulation, OK, I've

181
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.090
seen you've done something, I've seen you've achieved a

182
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.059
particular goal, maybe vaguely seen how you've done it,

183
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.570
but it's about trying to copy achievements of that

184
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:30.090
goal. And teaching refers to cases where the model.

185
00:12:30.669 --> 00:12:34.619
So the person that I'm learning from actively changes

186
00:12:34.869 --> 00:12:39.929
their behavior to facilitate the transmission of the, of

187
00:12:39.929 --> 00:12:42.030
the skill, and that doesn't have to be giving

188
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.130
me verbal instruction. You might, I might be cracking

189
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.859
a nut and I change the angle at which

190
00:12:47.859 --> 00:12:51.130
I'm doing it, which allows the learner to get

191
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.820
a better view. That would already be classified as

192
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.630
teaching, but the degree to which teaching happens in

193
00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:00.400
the animal kingdom and, And how unique it is

194
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.369
to humans is debated.

195
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:07.640
Right. So you've told us about 3 different kinds

196
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:13.919
of social learning processes, imitation, play, and teaching. Uh,

197
00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:17.799
DO we know whether, uh, I, I mean, do

198
00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:22.880
we know which knowledge domains children apply these different

199
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.830
social learning processes in?

200
00:13:26.169 --> 00:13:29.049
Well, I think if you look across human societies,

201
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.849
there's a lot of variation in that, and it

202
00:13:31.849 --> 00:13:35.159
probably relates to the, the sort of variation in

203
00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:38.289
the skill, the knowledge they're picking up. Certainly in

204
00:13:38.289 --> 00:13:42.010
our society, as we all know, we see actually

205
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.650
a lot of enforced teaching, right? We go to

206
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.169
school and we have a teacher model, uh, so

207
00:13:48.169 --> 00:13:51.039
that we can, they can transmit knowledge to us,

208
00:13:51.409 --> 00:13:56.039
um. But you can also see something that seems

209
00:13:56.039 --> 00:14:01.950
to be quite ingrained in the human disposition is

210
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.280
a tendency to imitate. Like anyone who's spent time

211
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.119
with young children, or particularly babies knows that they

212
00:14:09.119 --> 00:14:11.760
just can't help but copy, even if they don't

213
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.640
really know what they're doing, they want to copy

214
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.260
whatever they're saying. Um That's something that's really allowed

215
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.859
to flourish in, you know, we helicopter parents a

216
00:14:23.859 --> 00:14:26.340
lot in our society, but if you look at

217
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:30.619
a lot of small scale subsistence society, they give

218
00:14:30.619 --> 00:14:34.340
more freedom to the infants and others to imitate,

219
00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:37.979
and that really seems to be fundamental to the

220
00:14:37.979 --> 00:14:43.890
human condition and is actually thought to be, um,

221
00:14:44.179 --> 00:14:49.809
a key driver of. What a key driver of

222
00:14:49.809 --> 00:14:56.059
what has allowed us to have such sophisticated. Culture,

223
00:14:56.309 --> 00:14:59.770
um, I could. Explain that if you like, or

224
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.200
we can talk about it later.

225
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.770
So yeah, tell us more about what you were

226
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.409
mentioning there about social learning.

227
00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:13.859
So So culture, I mean, when we think about

228
00:15:13.859 --> 00:15:17.210
what makes humans unique, a lot of people refer

229
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.119
to the concept of cumulative culture. So let me

230
00:15:21.119 --> 00:15:29.140
first define culture. Culture simply is any Behavioral or.

231
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.010
uh OUTPUT or artifact that is the or knowledge

232
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.969
that is the product of social learning, right? So

233
00:15:37.969 --> 00:15:41.719
that's a really broad definition. I think colloquially we,

234
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.650
we tend to limit it to things like, you

235
00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:50.609
know, food, festivals, religion, clothing, but when you think

236
00:15:50.609 --> 00:15:53.210
about it, those are all products of social learning,

237
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:58.119
but they're nice. Objective criteria would be outputs of

238
00:15:58.119 --> 00:16:04.510
socially learned, socially transmitted information, knowledge and skills. So

239
00:16:05.239 --> 00:16:08.840
that's culture and we see culture in lots of

240
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.070
species. We see that social learning plays a role.

241
00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:16.239
Um THERE was a seminal study decades ago now

242
00:16:16.239 --> 00:16:20.520
with chimpanzees where they looked at uh different behaviors

243
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:25.200
across chimpanzee sites and found that There was good

244
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.700
evidence that certain behaviors like certain, that's called, for

245
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.830
example, the grooming hand clasp where two chimps will

246
00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:37.119
hold each other's hands up like this when they're

247
00:16:37.119 --> 00:16:41.520
grooming each other and that's confined to certain populations

248
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.739
and they found a whole host of these. Behaviors

249
00:16:44.739 --> 00:16:47.260
which seemed to be socially transmitted and they were

250
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.460
good. There was good evidence that this was these

251
00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.250
were examples of culture and there are many more

252
00:16:53.539 --> 00:16:57.859
since then in many species. But what makes what

253
00:16:57.859 --> 00:17:01.820
some people, a lot of people claim is unique

254
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.300
to human culture and actually the driving force of

255
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:11.159
our Potentially unique success as a species in colonizing

256
00:17:11.159 --> 00:17:16.608
the globe is that our culture is cumulative, and

257
00:17:16.608 --> 00:17:20.759
one could define that as we have cultural outputs

258
00:17:21.328 --> 00:17:25.968
which are more sophisticated than what one individual could

259
00:17:25.968 --> 00:17:30.530
learn alone. So social learning. Of course, speeds up

260
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.650
the transmission of information, but the question is, are

261
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.050
the skills and knowledge that are passed on socially

262
00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:41.369
in other species, beyond what that individual might or

263
00:17:41.369 --> 00:17:45.699
potentially has the capacity to achieve themselves. And in

264
00:17:45.699 --> 00:17:48.579
humans, of course, you know, if I was a

265
00:17:48.579 --> 00:17:52.369
naive individual, I'm not going to grow up and

266
00:17:52.579 --> 00:17:56.060
just by myself be able to build this computer,

267
00:17:56.099 --> 00:17:59.660
this technological output that we've got, or have this

268
00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.540
conversation because I wouldn't have the knowledge and everything

269
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.180
around us is more sophisticated than what an individual

270
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.689
could produce alone. And And the reason social learning

271
00:18:10.689 --> 00:18:13.609
is thought to be fundamental there are our modes

272
00:18:13.609 --> 00:18:18.859
of social learning is how imitation-based it is. So

273
00:18:18.859 --> 00:18:21.540
if you look, at least this is the traditional

274
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.020
argument, I'm presenting some of the key ideas, but

275
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:29.859
there is debate around these and but. Remember, imitation

276
00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:34.420
is about being process oriented. So humans seem to

277
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.900
be very process oriented and they're paying attention to

278
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.260
all the steps involved in an action rather than

279
00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.459
just thinking about that goal and trying to broadly

280
00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:51.380
achieve and emulate the goal. Um, SO that focus

281
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:59.050
on imitation means. Outputs such as, you know, technologies

282
00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:03.689
or sophisticated knowledge and skills, which have many, many

283
00:19:03.689 --> 00:19:08.189
steps to them. And sometimes those steps on how

284
00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:11.550
they relate to the goal isn't clear. If you're

285
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:16.290
focused on imitation, you can. You can just copy

286
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.489
the individual you're learning from, whereas if you're focused

287
00:19:19.489 --> 00:19:22.489
on emulation and you're not as process oriented, but

288
00:19:22.489 --> 00:19:26.050
you're just goal oriented, you're going to miss steps

289
00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:29.050
in the middle. A really nice demonstration of this

290
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.790
was this study, I think it was at St.

291
00:19:31.869 --> 00:19:38.189
Andrews, amongst the primatologists there. They had This, um,

292
00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:42.880
Dark black box which had some food, so it

293
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.040
wasn't, it was opaque. You couldn't see through it

294
00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.560
and it had some food treats in it and

295
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.180
they did all these random actions like shaking it

296
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.400
and then tapping it hard and there was a

297
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:59.369
whole number of actions and Then both young children

298
00:19:59.369 --> 00:20:03.250
and chimpanzees, they watched the demonstrator do this and

299
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.890
then they had to get the suite themselves, and

300
00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.089
they copied, they shook the box and then they,

301
00:20:08.329 --> 00:20:13.099
they hid it, um. And, and they achieved, they,

302
00:20:13.219 --> 00:20:17.219
they got the suit. Now, then in another condition,

303
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:22.619
they had a transparent box and they did the

304
00:20:22.619 --> 00:20:27.560
same thing except because the box was transparent. The

305
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.739
children and the chimps were able to see that

306
00:20:29.739 --> 00:20:32.479
actually most of what the experimenter was doing, like

307
00:20:32.479 --> 00:20:36.839
the shaking and the tapping, um, was completely irrelevant

308
00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:40.079
to the achievement of the goal, and all you

309
00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:42.199
had to do was pull a draw or something

310
00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:46.040
like that. Now the interesting thing was that the

311
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.010
chimps just pulled the drawer and got the suit,

312
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.599
but even though it was, you know, it would

313
00:20:50.599 --> 00:20:53.119
have been obvious to, to a child of that

314
00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:57.410
age that most of these other behaviors. We probably

315
00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:01.290
irrelevant, they still imitated them, just for the sake

316
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:04.599
they've got this sort of blind tendency to imitate

317
00:21:04.849 --> 00:21:08.479
even seemingly useless actions, but what that means is,

318
00:21:08.489 --> 00:21:14.640
is, as we have. Uh, CULTURAL outputs like building

319
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.750
something where sometimes it's very sophisticated and all the

320
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.349
steps and how that relates to the goal isn't

321
00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:26.109
clear. If you imitate, you can get there, whereas

322
00:21:26.109 --> 00:21:29.030
if you emulate and you're not, you, you don't

323
00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.849
have this disposition towards copying every stage. You might

324
00:21:32.849 --> 00:21:35.609
miss that out, especially if it's not clear how

325
00:21:35.609 --> 00:21:38.150
a step relates to the goal. So what that

326
00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:42.410
leads to is transmission fidelity. All the steps are

327
00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.079
copied and then all the steps are passed on,

328
00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.849
which allows these incremental improvements to be copied and

329
00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:55.359
passed on, whereas with more emulation focused species. They're

330
00:21:55.359 --> 00:21:57.359
not copying all the steps, so there's an element

331
00:21:57.359 --> 00:22:00.160
of reinventing the wheel. Yes, they're saying, oh, I

332
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.439
can go to this box and there's a suite.

333
00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.920
But they may have to, if it's a complex

334
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.839
process, they're having to work it out for themselves

335
00:22:08.839 --> 00:22:12.130
exactly how to achieve that goal. So you're constantly

336
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.890
going back to stage one. You're just getting that

337
00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.170
guiding process of, OK, I need to do something

338
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.089
with this box to get the suite or, or

339
00:22:21.089 --> 00:22:23.079
to build this thing. I need to do something

340
00:22:23.079 --> 00:22:25.790
like that and I saw that guy doing. But

341
00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:28.329
you're having to reinvent the wheel, which slows the

342
00:22:28.329 --> 00:22:32.939
whole process down. It reduces transmission fidelity. So you're

343
00:22:32.939 --> 00:22:36.329
constantly going back as opposed to the ratchet effect

344
00:22:36.329 --> 00:22:40.339
in humans you imitate and you constantly make incremental

345
00:22:40.339 --> 00:22:45.099
improvements. So that's one of a few reasons why

346
00:22:45.099 --> 00:22:49.099
it's thought that this social learning tendency of high

347
00:22:49.099 --> 00:22:53.099
imitation in humans is thought, is thought to be

348
00:22:53.099 --> 00:22:57.979
fundamental to the breadth and And sophistication of our

349
00:22:57.979 --> 00:23:02.400
cultural repertoire of technologies and skills and knowledge.

350
00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:08.770
Right. So about cumulative culture, in what ways is

351
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:14.760
it related to social structure and knowledge sharing networks?

352
00:23:15.369 --> 00:23:17.530
Yeah, so that's the other side of the story.

353
00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:21.729
You've sort of got. How is the social learning

354
00:23:21.729 --> 00:23:26.010
happen and then also what are the dynamics, who's

355
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.510
teaching who who's transmitting to who? And, and of

356
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.810
course the other side of the other part of

357
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.449
the imitation is of course our language allows for

358
00:23:34.449 --> 00:23:39.170
verbal teaching, which is very good for increasing um.

359
00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:46.640
Transmission of complicated uh processes, um. As for social

360
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:53.439
structure. What's, you know, some of the initial experiments.

361
00:23:54.699 --> 00:23:58.689
And data was sort of the obvious first step

362
00:23:58.689 --> 00:24:01.859
was seeing something like population size, you know, if

363
00:24:01.859 --> 00:24:03.979
there are more people in the population, there are

364
00:24:03.979 --> 00:24:07.380
more people to potentially learn from, so that should

365
00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.530
increase the cultural corpus, and that's what you see.

366
00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:15.180
There was a nice study looking at indigenous populations

367
00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.574
in Oceania, Oceania at Contact and looking at the

368
00:24:19.574 --> 00:24:25.165
sophistication of their marine hunting tools and indeed they

369
00:24:25.165 --> 00:24:29.055
found a clear relationships in the larger communities and

370
00:24:29.055 --> 00:24:34.094
the larger subpopulations they had much more sophisticated tools

371
00:24:34.094 --> 00:24:36.604
because there were more models, there was more innovation,

372
00:24:36.854 --> 00:24:41.270
so more people to copy from. But then You

373
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:45.430
know, humans are more complex and there's migration, and

374
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:49.189
there, there are different levels of interactions within groups

375
00:24:49.189 --> 00:24:51.699
and we need to be thinking about these things.

376
00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:56.780
Um, SO there was the idea of connectivity and

377
00:24:57.589 --> 00:25:00.869
If, if you imagine subpopulation, so imagine you've got

378
00:25:00.869 --> 00:25:04.060
this large meta population which is broken down into

379
00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:10.750
subpopulations. Um, Which are somewhat isolated, but then there's

380
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:15.069
migration between them. Well, again, quite intuitive. The more

381
00:25:15.069 --> 00:25:18.630
migration there is between subpopulations, you might think, well,

382
00:25:18.709 --> 00:25:21.359
the more there can be exchange of ideas, and

383
00:25:21.359 --> 00:25:23.750
there was some of this work showing, well, what's

384
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:30.609
really key here is having um connectivity. Between populations

385
00:25:30.609 --> 00:25:32.329
so that you get exchanged by ideas, you know,

386
00:25:32.369 --> 00:25:34.650
the obvious case being think about the internet and

387
00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:39.410
how that's fundamentally shared, the, the, uh, change, the

388
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.880
sharing of knowledge dynamics, and as a result, you

389
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.800
know, the technological and economic outputs have just grown

390
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:52.640
exponentially because of that increased connectivity. Now the interesting

391
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:57.420
part with the social structure and perhaps Less immediately

392
00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:05.229
obvious is that relationship between connectivity and cultural success,

393
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.050
let's say the sophistication of the technologies and knowledge

394
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:12.540
is not actually linear. It is not that more

395
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.420
connectivity is always better. And I really think the

396
00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:20.829
best way, it's not the easiest experiment to describe,

397
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:28.260
but, but I'll, I'll do my best. Effectively There

398
00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.849
was this study where you have two different. Um,

399
00:26:34.569 --> 00:26:36.569
You you've got the task which is to make

400
00:26:36.569 --> 00:26:41.569
potions and different potions are worth different number of

401
00:26:41.569 --> 00:26:45.089
points and you make these potions by mixing ingredients.

402
00:26:45.839 --> 00:26:53.560
And You've got, say, 50 different um starter potions,

403
00:26:53.569 --> 00:26:56.130
and if you, if you mix them you get

404
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.930
different numbers of points, but if you mix out

405
00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:03.050
of that 50, if you mix 3, there are

406
00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:06.329
3 in particular that if you mix, you actually

407
00:27:06.329 --> 00:27:09.640
get a new potion to add to your 50,

408
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.180
um. And there are two sets of 3 like

409
00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.310
that. So with all the potions, you can also

410
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:19.660
make 2 new potions. If you happen to pick,

411
00:27:20.229 --> 00:27:23.140
let's say, A, B, and C, it produces a

412
00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.579
new blue potion and if you happen to predict

413
00:27:25.579 --> 00:27:30.469
X, Y, Z, it produces a red potion. And

414
00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:35.209
Then using the blue potion and red potion in

415
00:27:35.209 --> 00:27:38.010
the next round gives you even more points. And

416
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:40.290
if you use them with the correct, you know,

417
00:27:40.369 --> 00:27:42.439
if you happen to use the blue potion with,

418
00:27:42.689 --> 00:27:46.160
let's say D&E, you're gonna get another potion, uh,

419
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.569
a green potion, and so on. Now, there are

420
00:27:49.569 --> 00:27:52.890
these two streams, because if you remember, the new

421
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.189
potions you can produce, which are worth more points,

422
00:27:56.209 --> 00:27:58.209
uh, there too. There's the blue potion and the

423
00:27:58.209 --> 00:28:01.369
red potion, and there are basically these two trajectories

424
00:28:01.369 --> 00:28:03.489
you can go up. You can start using the

425
00:28:03.489 --> 00:28:06.020
blue potion, or you could start using the red

426
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.209
potion, or maybe you use them both if you

427
00:28:09.209 --> 00:28:12.209
discover them both. And importantly, when you combine the

428
00:28:12.209 --> 00:28:15.209
blue and the red potion. It can, it can

429
00:28:15.209 --> 00:28:21.719
really produce, uh, very sophisticated, uh, outputs. So does

430
00:28:21.719 --> 00:28:24.890
the experiment make sense so far? Have I vaguely

431
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:29.410
outlined it now what they did was you had

432
00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:33.750
groups of say. Pairs, you had pairs working, they

433
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.270
play one round where they get to combine some

434
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:38.829
potions and see how many points they get, or

435
00:28:38.829 --> 00:28:40.790
if they're very lucky, they're going to produce one

436
00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.829
of these new potions, but that's very unlikely because

437
00:28:43.829 --> 00:28:46.369
they'd have to get the perfect combination of three.

438
00:28:47.959 --> 00:28:52.439
And the participants don't really know that new potions

439
00:28:52.439 --> 00:28:55.239
could come or, or anything. They just know they're

440
00:28:55.239 --> 00:28:58.199
mixing potions to get more points, that's the aim

441
00:28:58.199 --> 00:29:01.589
of the game. Now in the full connectivity condition,

442
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.660
you'd play in your pair for, um, no, in

443
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:09.729
the full connectivity condition actually. You, you sort of

444
00:29:09.729 --> 00:29:13.000
play in pairs, but then after each pair had

445
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.290
played after round one, every, each pair speaks together

446
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.810
so everyone knows, OK, you use those potions and

447
00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.119
you've got this number of points, we use these,

448
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.729
we've got this number of points, and they share

449
00:29:24.729 --> 00:29:28.770
that information perfectly. So you've got full connectivity, perfect

450
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:34.569
sharing of information every round. In the partial connectivity

451
00:29:34.569 --> 00:29:38.839
condition it was slightly different. You would play um.

452
00:29:39.599 --> 00:29:43.760
You might play 10 rounds in your pair before.

453
00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:47.359
You move on and there are in round 11,

454
00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:50.260
1 person from each pair moves to another group,

455
00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:54.270
so you're shuffling the pairs every 10 rounds and

456
00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.910
say you play 100 rounds, but whereas in full

457
00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:01.150
connectivity you play 100 rounds, but you're, um, each

458
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.560
round you're sharing the information. And what they found

459
00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:09.750
was that partial connectivity actually uh did better in

460
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:13.119
this experiment, and the reason for this is. Think

461
00:30:13.119 --> 00:30:15.189
how rare it is, because you need to get

462
00:30:15.189 --> 00:30:18.079
the right 3 potions out of like 50, it's

463
00:30:18.079 --> 00:30:20.719
very rare that you're gonna either produce one of

464
00:30:20.719 --> 00:30:24.420
the 2 new potions. So in the full connectivity

465
00:30:24.839 --> 00:30:28.839
um scenario, as soon as one person does that.

466
00:30:29.199 --> 00:30:30.989
They're like, oh, we made this new potion that

467
00:30:30.989 --> 00:30:33.589
makes loads of points. They share that and everyone's

468
00:30:33.589 --> 00:30:36.229
using that. Everyone's tried loads and just been getting

469
00:30:36.229 --> 00:30:39.089
points, but suddenly this pair gets new potion and

470
00:30:39.089 --> 00:30:42.060
everyone does that, and they go up that trajectory.

471
00:30:42.349 --> 00:30:47.550
Whereas in the partial connectivity condition, actually you leave

472
00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:51.380
a bit of time before that information is shared,

473
00:30:51.589 --> 00:30:53.790
and it may be that in those 10 rounds,

474
00:30:53.989 --> 00:30:56.949
someone got the blue potion and someone, another pair

475
00:30:56.949 --> 00:31:00.729
got the red potion. So then once they've shared

476
00:31:00.729 --> 00:31:04.020
the information, they've actually got more of this, these

477
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.209
new ingredients which are super valuable in terms of

478
00:31:07.209 --> 00:31:10.930
points to, to work with. So the idea is

479
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.040
that with full connectivity, as soon as you get

480
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.410
to some good solution, you're going to be stuck

481
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:20.010
in a trajectory where you're always using that good

482
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:23.689
solution, but it may be that there are multiple.

483
00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:28.089
There are multiple directions which are very fruitful, and

484
00:31:28.089 --> 00:31:31.569
by having partial connectivity, you're more likely to actually

485
00:31:31.569 --> 00:31:35.329
explore the space of solutions rather than getting stuck

486
00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:38.949
in one trajectory. And now when we think about

487
00:31:38.949 --> 00:31:42.660
our evolutionary history and why this is relevant, when

488
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:46.170
we think about hunter-gatherers, you're living in these camps,

489
00:31:46.319 --> 00:31:48.380
you know, with say 50 other people, there's a

490
00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.380
little bit variation, but they're highly mobile, and hunter

491
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.219
gatherer camps, I think there's a misconception sometimes that

492
00:31:55.219 --> 00:31:58.900
mobility means the whole camp of 50 people moves

493
00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.219
together. But what it actually is, you've got nuclear

494
00:32:02.219 --> 00:32:05.300
families or something like a nuclear family within these

495
00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.489
camps. And then one nuclear family might move to

496
00:32:09.489 --> 00:32:12.209
another camp. So you've got this constant turnover and

497
00:32:12.209 --> 00:32:15.170
movement, just like in the experiment. You're, it's not

498
00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.930
that everyone moves together, you've got one family then

499
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:21.329
going to a new camp of 50 people and

500
00:32:21.329 --> 00:32:26.130
constant movement, uh, like that, constant fluid composition of

501
00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.640
the camps and exchange of ideas, and that's really

502
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.209
optimal because you, you've got partial connectivity, you've got.

503
00:32:34.849 --> 00:32:38.130
Stable, you know, I might be in my family

504
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.969
and we might stay in a camp for a

505
00:32:39.969 --> 00:32:42.569
couple of months, and then we move on. So

506
00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:46.969
that what they're called something like small world networks

507
00:32:46.969 --> 00:32:50.489
is really ideal because you really get in time

508
00:32:50.489 --> 00:32:54.890
for innovation within groups and then sharing of innovations

509
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.599
between groups at a rate which isn't going to

510
00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:03.329
erode exploration of, of possible uh cultural solutions.

511
00:33:04.569 --> 00:33:07.199
That's very interesting. Uh, LET me ask you now

512
00:33:07.199 --> 00:33:12.680
a little bit about breathing systems. What are cooperative

513
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.439
and communal breathing systems?

514
00:33:16.609 --> 00:33:23.500
Um, SO, in the animal kingdom. You've got variation

515
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:29.800
in. In who looks after offspring. So in mammals,

516
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:33.910
for example. I can't, I think you're looking at

517
00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:42.339
about 90% are, it's mainly just maternal care. Don't

518
00:33:42.339 --> 00:33:44.420
quote me on that, it could be that there's

519
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.449
only 10% where fathers are involved, but generally, um,

520
00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:51.660
the norm is that it's maternal care, but you

521
00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:57.010
do have still plenty of species. Where individuals other

522
00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:59.560
than the mother help raise the offspring, that might

523
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:04.579
be the father, but not always. And there, there

524
00:34:04.579 --> 00:34:07.859
are two broad systems, as you mentioned, cooperative and

525
00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:14.118
communal breeding. So cooperative breeding. REFERS to a system

526
00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:17.559
where individuals, or at least traditionally, this is how

527
00:34:17.559 --> 00:34:21.989
the term is used, individuals who are sexually mature

528
00:34:22.398 --> 00:34:26.878
do not breed themselves, but they help someone else

529
00:34:26.878 --> 00:34:31.478
breed. So my helpers are sexually mature other individuals

530
00:34:31.478 --> 00:34:36.570
who are not breeding themselves. And then communal breeding

531
00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:40.469
is where you have multiple breeding females looking after

532
00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:44.649
children together. So they're all mothers and they're helping

533
00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:48.090
one another. They might take turns looking after children

534
00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:50.728
or some of them might go foraging while others

535
00:34:50.728 --> 00:34:55.589
stay and look after the kids, um. So this

536
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:57.229
is what we see in other species. I mean,

537
00:34:57.349 --> 00:35:01.839
cooperative breeding is particularly interesting because it's sort of.

538
00:35:02.689 --> 00:35:04.679
Uh, YOU know, relates to this problem, well, it

539
00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:07.209
very much does relate to this problem of cooperation

540
00:35:07.209 --> 00:35:11.239
that I mentioned earlier. Which is, well, isn't this

541
00:35:11.239 --> 00:35:16.689
the ultimate Darwinian sacrifice for me to not breed

542
00:35:16.689 --> 00:35:20.649
myself the ultimate cost to my goodness, and help

543
00:35:20.649 --> 00:35:24.689
the breeding of some other individual. So the question

544
00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:28.250
is how on earth could that evolve? And the

545
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.850
answer, as is often the case when we face

546
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:36.250
cooperation problems. Is it's to do with genetic relatedness,

547
00:35:36.419 --> 00:35:39.060
so a really important concept that again I'm sure

548
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.060
many of your listeners may be familiar with is

549
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:46.139
that of inclusive fitness. Selection happens at the level

550
00:35:46.139 --> 00:35:52.139
of the gene, natural selection is shaped behavior. To

551
00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:57.290
maximize the propagation of genes. Now, what's good for

552
00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.770
the individual isn't always identical to what's good for

553
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:05.050
their genes, because there are also identical copies of

554
00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:08.169
my genes in my relatives, right? You know, I

555
00:36:08.169 --> 00:36:10.770
have 50% of genes shared with my mother and

556
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:16.110
siblings and 25% with my nephew and nieces. So

557
00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.070
I can sometimes that sacrifice to my own breeding

558
00:36:22.399 --> 00:36:26.679
to help the breeding of a relative could make

559
00:36:26.679 --> 00:36:31.159
sense. So one hypothesis is ecological constraints. If there's

560
00:36:31.159 --> 00:36:34.780
not much, Uh, there aren't many territories available or

561
00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.439
the environment's really harsh that I'm unlikely to be

562
00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.379
successful in my breeding attempts or there there's a

563
00:36:42.379 --> 00:36:44.620
problem with the sex ratio, so there aren't many

564
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.899
mates available. It may be a better strategy for

565
00:36:47.899 --> 00:36:52.050
me to not risk. Being unsuccessful in my own

566
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:56.540
breeding attempts, and my best strategy would be to

567
00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:01.580
increase my inclusive fitness by increasing the replication of

568
00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:07.219
my genes by helping the production of offspring to

569
00:37:07.219 --> 00:37:10.179
my family members, usually my mom. So what you

570
00:37:10.179 --> 00:37:12.580
see in a lot of bird species is when

571
00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.260
there are these ecological constraints and there's a lack

572
00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:20.100
of available mates or territories. Even after her elder

573
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:25.080
offspring reach sexual maturity, they'll delay dispersal. And not

574
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.760
set up their own nest, but help her to

575
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.159
produce more offspring. So help in the production of

576
00:37:30.159 --> 00:37:34.000
younger siblings, because that's their best strategy. When when

577
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.159
I talk this way, I'm speaking about strategies and

578
00:37:37.159 --> 00:37:40.280
giving a narrative structure. That's just to explain the

579
00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.989
process, of course, evolution has no goal and, and

580
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.919
no organism cares about their inclusive fitness, but there's

581
00:37:47.919 --> 00:37:52.169
been selection on some process, which means that Birds,

582
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:55.459
when they're unlikely to be successful in breeding themselves,

583
00:37:55.669 --> 00:37:59.510
help their, their parents to produce more offspring, and

584
00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:03.250
that. That helps, you know, answer this question of

585
00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:06.209
how on earth could not breeding yourself and helping

586
00:38:06.209 --> 00:38:09.139
another breed, uh, be beneficial, and, and speaks to

587
00:38:09.139 --> 00:38:12.209
the larger problem of cooperation, as I mentioned in

588
00:38:12.209 --> 00:38:16.629
the animal kingdom. It's certainly, but by far the

589
00:38:16.629 --> 00:38:20.449
most common answer is that you're helping um. Uh,

590
00:38:21.469 --> 00:38:25.310
YOU know, helping genetic relatives, and following, uh, it

591
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:28.020
was Hamilton who, I don't know whether, I mean,

592
00:38:28.149 --> 00:38:31.870
this is so fundamental that certainly it'd be of

593
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:35.780
interest to to your readers, uh, to your listeners,

594
00:38:35.989 --> 00:38:39.709
but perhaps it's something that's been discussed loads and

595
00:38:39.709 --> 00:38:45.179
Hamilton's equation and inclusive fitness. Should I outline that,

596
00:38:46.389 --> 00:38:49.149
yes, tell us a little bit about that. Yes,

597
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.780
please.

598
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:54.879
So this problem of cooperation, as I mentioned, is

599
00:38:55.129 --> 00:38:58.270
if we define cooperation or let's, if we define

600
00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:02.129
altruism as me incurring a cost too much and

601
00:39:02.129 --> 00:39:05.689
the currency here is fitness, me carrying out some

602
00:39:05.689 --> 00:39:09.919
behavior that is costly for my fitness, but beneficial

603
00:39:09.919 --> 00:39:14.429
for the fitness of another. Almost by definition, that

604
00:39:14.429 --> 00:39:17.429
should go extinct because that behavior is reducing my

605
00:39:17.429 --> 00:39:20.310
fitness. That's the big question. If it's reducing my

606
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:24.919
ability to produce healthy, successful offspring and aiding someone

607
00:39:24.919 --> 00:39:28.350
else's, that person's at a competitive advantage, and I'm

608
00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:30.949
at a disadvantage. So the question is how could

609
00:39:30.949 --> 00:39:35.550
that behavior be selected, which long ago was a

610
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.510
complete mystery, but in what I would say is

611
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:45.260
the most important. Yeah, the, the most important discovery,

612
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.500
let's say, in the evolutionary social sciences was Hamilton's

613
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:53.580
theory of inclusive fitness, where he, he solved this

614
00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.850
problem, which was that selection happens at the level

615
00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:59.939
of the gene, as I mentioned. So natural selection

616
00:40:00.179 --> 00:40:07.139
does not work to Maximum to, to produce behavioral

617
00:40:07.139 --> 00:40:11.580
strategies that maximize direct fitness, right? It's not just

618
00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:16.020
about maximizing the production of successful offspring that I

619
00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:19.979
have, it's about replicating genes, right? This is what

620
00:40:19.979 --> 00:40:24.120
natural selection works on. So inclusive fitness is my

621
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.040
direct fitness, the replication of my genes through my

622
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.489
own offspring and my indirect fitness, which is the

623
00:40:30.489 --> 00:40:34.719
replication of identical copies of my gene through the

624
00:40:34.719 --> 00:40:39.840
reproduction of my genetic relatives. So Hamilton came up

625
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.040
with this inequality, BR is greater than C. So

626
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.929
if in a given action. The benefit, remember by

627
00:40:47.929 --> 00:40:51.320
definition, I'm incurring a cost to provide a benefit.

628
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:55.840
If the benefit I provide to you. To your

629
00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:01.199
fitness. Times are, which is our coefficient of relatedness,

630
00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.070
so I discount it by how related we are.

631
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.149
So if you're my brother. Our coefficient of relating

632
00:41:08.149 --> 00:41:10.820
this is 0.5%, we share 50% of our genes.

633
00:41:11.649 --> 00:41:14.949
So if BR is greater than C, which is

634
00:41:14.949 --> 00:41:18.800
the cost of my own fitness, my own reproduction,

635
00:41:18.969 --> 00:41:22.489
then my inclusive fitness has actually increased. So this

636
00:41:22.489 --> 00:41:26.850
is nicely demonstrated in a quote by Haldane, which

637
00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:30.754
is, I jump in a rib. AND sacrifice myself

638
00:41:30.754 --> 00:41:33.794
to save 2 brothers or 8 cousins, you know,

639
00:41:34.044 --> 00:41:37.324
if I can carry out some action, if you're

640
00:41:37.324 --> 00:41:39.314
my brother and I can carry out an action

641
00:41:39.314 --> 00:41:41.594
that is going to lead to you having 3

642
00:41:41.594 --> 00:41:46.389
more offspring instead of me having 1. Then you're

643
00:41:46.389 --> 00:41:51.070
having and producing 3 offspring for you discounted by

644
00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.350
the fact that we only share 50% of our

645
00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:58.739
genes, so I'm effectively replicating my genes 1.5 times,

646
00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:02.100
and that is more important than replicating my genes.

647
00:42:02.149 --> 00:42:06.030
That's a higher fitness, inclusive fitness payoff than having

648
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:08.979
one offspring myself, so that, that will clear.

649
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.639
Mhm. Yes, yes, it's all clear. Let me ask

650
00:42:12.639 --> 00:42:17.479
you then, uh, focusing on humans now, which kinds

651
00:42:17.479 --> 00:42:22.790
of women participate in each of these breathing systems,

652
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.360
the cooperative and the communal breeding system? Yeah, and

653
00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.080
does it depend on factors like them being sexually

654
00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:36.389
mature and reproductively active or whether they are related

655
00:42:36.389 --> 00:42:38.830
or unrelated to the children?

656
00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:46.620
Sure. Um, SO, yes, the, uh, uh, typically, and

657
00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.860
it's probably just a matter of looseness in the

658
00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.479
use of the word, humans are referred to as

659
00:42:52.479 --> 00:42:59.100
cooperative breeders. Now actually, that's, I think inappropriate because

660
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:02.979
as I mentioned, cooperative breeding is. Is meant to

661
00:43:02.979 --> 00:43:07.699
be restricted for cases where sexually mature individuals sacrifice

662
00:43:07.699 --> 00:43:11.889
their own breeding to help someone else's breeding efforts.

663
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:17.739
So, but the. Importantly, it was recognized that some

664
00:43:17.739 --> 00:43:21.899
form of either cooperative or communal breeding is going

665
00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:25.899
on, and that allomothering, which is a more generic

666
00:43:25.899 --> 00:43:29.060
term for someone other than the mother helping and

667
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.340
raising the offspring, is a fundamental human adaptation. So

668
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.340
there was a famous review paper which found in

669
00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:42.060
every society that had been looked at. Someone other

670
00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:45.500
than the mother does have an effect. The mother

671
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.209
has an effect in every society that's looked at

672
00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:50.540
in whether the child survives or not, you know,

673
00:43:50.639 --> 00:43:53.100
if a child doesn't have a mother because she

674
00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:57.060
dies or abandons the child, the survival prospects go

675
00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:00.780
down. It's very unsurprising. But in every human society

676
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:05.050
where it's been studied. There is someone in addition

677
00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:07.590
to the mother who has a survival impact for

678
00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.090
the child, you know, maybe the most common is

679
00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:14.169
the maternal grandma. So in many societies, if I'm

680
00:44:14.169 --> 00:44:17.810
born and I don't have a maternal grandmother, but,

681
00:44:17.929 --> 00:44:20.570
and you, you're born and you do because she

682
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.264
lives with you, or because She's still alive and

683
00:44:23.264 --> 00:44:26.344
mine isn't your survival prospects are better than mine.

684
00:44:26.584 --> 00:44:29.385
So because of this pattern, we think of humans

685
00:44:29.385 --> 00:44:34.135
as the reproduction is cooperative. Allan mothering is fundamental,

686
00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:37.185
and it's not just the mother that determines survival

687
00:44:37.185 --> 00:44:41.854
prospects. Now, as for who actually provides that care,

688
00:44:42.264 --> 00:44:48.189
it varies loads between societies. But what I'd say

689
00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.639
is that cooperative breeding in the traditional sense where

690
00:44:52.639 --> 00:44:57.360
you have an individual who is sexually mature, not

691
00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.000
breeding to help another individual breed, that is very

692
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.879
rare. That doesn't really happen when you think about

693
00:45:03.879 --> 00:45:07.909
human societies. Part of the reason that may be

694
00:45:07.909 --> 00:45:13.300
an appropriate term. IS because if grandmothers are really

695
00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.939
important, you can see some parallel here. I don't

696
00:45:16.939 --> 00:45:19.620
know how much your listeners will know about the

697
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:24.000
grandmother hypothesis, but it talks about the evolution of

698
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.489
a post reproductive lifespan. You know, humans are strange

699
00:45:27.489 --> 00:45:30.379
and that we have menopause, which you only see

700
00:45:30.689 --> 00:45:35.120
a couple of other mammals where you actually have.

701
00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:39.899
Uh, POST reproductive women, they can't reproduce themselves, but

702
00:45:39.899 --> 00:45:43.620
they're typically, uh, as I mentioned, very important in

703
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:49.560
helping raise their, their grandchildren. And uh the idea

704
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:53.669
that being that the, the post-reproductive life after menopause

705
00:45:53.669 --> 00:45:58.169
got selected for because grandmothers could be such important

706
00:45:58.169 --> 00:46:02.520
helpers. And you could argue that looks something like

707
00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:08.040
cooperative breeding because um these females have passed sexual

708
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.860
maturity and then have evolved this strategy where they're

709
00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:16.239
not breeding themselves, but they're helping produce grandchildren. Now

710
00:46:16.239 --> 00:46:19.649
there are some nuances in that process, which, which

711
00:46:19.649 --> 00:46:21.560
I won't go into here, why, why I don't

712
00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.280
think it's perfectly analogous, but, but there's something in

713
00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.080
that. But I think in the vast majority of

714
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.139
cases. Um, WHAT you often see in human societies.

715
00:46:33.149 --> 00:46:35.489
Well, you see so much variation, but in, in

716
00:46:35.489 --> 00:46:40.419
many non-industrialized societies, it's very common for young children

717
00:46:40.669 --> 00:46:43.219
to look after other children. So where I work,

718
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:48.270
it with the hunter-gatherers, you see that children from

719
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:50.790
around the age of 4 are playing an important

720
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:54.429
are starting to, they've really got some good caregiving

721
00:46:54.429 --> 00:46:58.149
competency. We had some videos which we showed a

722
00:46:58.149 --> 00:47:03.770
developmental psychologist that my colleague Denise Salali filled. And

723
00:47:04.679 --> 00:47:08.649
The developmental psychologist concluded that this 4 year old

724
00:47:08.649 --> 00:47:12.610
was capable of sensitive caregiving. Sensitive caregiving is when

725
00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:17.090
a caregiver can correctly notice, interpret and respond to

726
00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:22.389
infant signals. So, What we see, what I think

727
00:47:22.389 --> 00:47:25.600
has perhaps been not emphasized enough because there's been

728
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.040
so much debate about the importance of fathers and

729
00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:32.280
grandmothers, is just how much young children who haven't

730
00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:36.239
yet reached sexual maturity play a role in looking

731
00:47:36.239 --> 00:47:39.949
after kids where I work probably starts around 4,

732
00:47:40.169 --> 00:47:43.959
but certainly you see prepubescent girls who offer their

733
00:47:43.959 --> 00:47:49.659
nipple to pacify a baby, um. After children are

734
00:47:49.659 --> 00:47:52.459
less reliant on the infants are less reliant on

735
00:47:52.459 --> 00:47:55.550
their mother's milk, and certainly once they're weaned, they're

736
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:58.489
spending most of the day with other children. It's

737
00:47:58.489 --> 00:48:01.870
not adults looking after them. So they play a

738
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:06.229
big role in looking after kids. Grandmothers do in

739
00:48:06.229 --> 00:48:11.949
lots of societies, as I've mentioned. I'm More skeptical

740
00:48:11.949 --> 00:48:15.429
as to the involvement of grandmothers in hunter-gatherer societies,

741
00:48:15.469 --> 00:48:19.709
which is of course a huge area because understanding

742
00:48:19.709 --> 00:48:23.909
the evolution of the post reproductive lifespan relies a

743
00:48:23.909 --> 00:48:27.300
lot on this importance of grandmothering, but I actually,

744
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:30.070
it varies a lot, but my feeling is that

745
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.669
actually in many cases, Children don't have access to

746
00:48:33.669 --> 00:48:37.070
a grandmother because of life expectancy and the fact

747
00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:40.699
that they're nomadic, so grandmothers are often living elsewhere.

748
00:48:41.149 --> 00:48:45.070
So I'm less convinced of the importance of grandmothers

749
00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:48.699
in many hunter-gatherer societies, at least, but not all.

750
00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:54.500
And fathers, again, highly bearable how involved fathers are

751
00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:59.340
in raising children across societies. I'd say. Usually they

752
00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.340
are involved to a degree, but, but that can

753
00:49:02.659 --> 00:49:07.260
go anywhere from the ACA, for example, who were

754
00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:09.260
considered the best dads in the world, and they

755
00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:14.179
found that 50% of daylight hours, an Acker man

756
00:49:14.179 --> 00:49:18.939
is within an arm's length of their infant, and

757
00:49:18.939 --> 00:49:20.860
then at the other end of the spectrum you

758
00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:25.689
have um. Societies without pair bonding where the, the

759
00:49:25.689 --> 00:49:29.070
males aren't providing anything, but that's, that's quite rare

760
00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:32.639
amongst humans. Uh, SO, yeah, I guess in the

761
00:49:32.639 --> 00:49:35.639
short answer to your question is there's huge diversity

762
00:49:35.919 --> 00:49:39.520
in who provides care, and as such, it's quite

763
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:44.239
difficult to classify the human breeding system. What is

764
00:49:44.239 --> 00:49:48.199
consistent is that it's always cooperative, but as for

765
00:49:48.199 --> 00:49:51.719
whether it fits these formal classifications of cooperative breeding

766
00:49:51.719 --> 00:49:55.040
or communal breeding, I'd say it's it's unique in

767
00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:58.669
that regard. It doesn't neatly fit into either. Right.

768
00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:02.330
So let me ask you now a little bit

769
00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:06.889
about evolutionary psychiatry, psychiatry, which I know is a

770
00:50:06.889 --> 00:50:10.770
topic you're also interested in. So what is it

771
00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:13.850
and in what ways do you think anthropology can

772
00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:18.820
contribute to it more broadly and to understanding the

773
00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.610
etiology of mental illness more specifically?

774
00:50:22.899 --> 00:50:28.060
Um, SO evolutionary psychiatry, it's certainly not an alternative

775
00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:32.989
to other modes of psychiatry, uh, and standard psychiatry.

776
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:37.250
What it is is a compliment to them insofar

777
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:43.030
as Typically, uh, you know, current psychiatry is heavily

778
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:49.209
focused on the biomedical model and. Identifying, especially in

779
00:50:49.209 --> 00:50:56.699
psychiatric treatment. Producing treatments that uh deal with neuroendocrine

780
00:50:56.699 --> 00:50:59.709
processes, right? It's a, it's a heavy emphasis and

781
00:50:59.709 --> 00:51:03.389
what are, what are the neurophysiological processes going on

782
00:51:03.389 --> 00:51:06.459
in psychiatric disorders and how can we treat them.

783
00:51:06.989 --> 00:51:08.989
So it's very much a how question, what we

784
00:51:08.989 --> 00:51:11.669
call a proximate question, what's going on in the

785
00:51:11.669 --> 00:51:16.350
brains of people with mental disorders? Um, WHAT neurotransmitter

786
00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:19.590
differences are there, what hormonal differences are there in

787
00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:25.649
signaling. Um, Whereas the evolutionary approach, as with everything,

788
00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:29.129
as in all domains, answers the why question. Well,

789
00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:33.080
why is it the neurotransmitters behave in that way?

790
00:51:33.679 --> 00:51:36.250
Um, WHY is it in certain contexts they're more

791
00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:38.500
likely to behave in that way? Why is it

792
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:44.810
that genes that predispose um certain neurological processes have

793
00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:48.010
still um are are still around if they lead

794
00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:53.129
to mental disorder. So I think You know, going

795
00:51:53.129 --> 00:51:56.969
back to Devansky's favorite famous quote, nothing in biology

796
00:51:56.969 --> 00:52:00.639
makes sense except in light of evolution to make

797
00:52:00.639 --> 00:52:04.860
sense of the how of the proximate processes, we,

798
00:52:04.929 --> 00:52:08.889
we need the why, um, and I guess at

799
00:52:08.889 --> 00:52:13.969
its most fundamental level, you could say evolutionary psychiatry

800
00:52:13.969 --> 00:52:19.850
investigates. It's not the question of Why do mental

801
00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:24.169
disorders persist and why haven't they been eliminated by

802
00:52:24.169 --> 00:52:29.010
natural selection? And there are many different answers to

803
00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:34.489
that, and that's what evolutionary psychiatry is investigating. And

804
00:52:34.489 --> 00:52:38.459
that's for where anthropology comes in or evolutionary anthropology.

805
00:52:39.179 --> 00:52:44.790
Um, Well, part of it, I guess one, I,

806
00:52:44.919 --> 00:52:49.510
I'll speak to one of several. COMPONENTS that answer,

807
00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:53.419
but Perhaps the most relevant to my work is

808
00:52:53.419 --> 00:52:58.810
this idea of evolutionary mismatch, which uh is that

809
00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:02.350
um an organism or, or at least certain traits

810
00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:07.669
within an organism evolved in a particular environmental context

811
00:53:07.979 --> 00:53:14.090
and when the organism. Faces new environmental conditions. In

812
00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:18.760
many cases those traits may malfunction, leading to maladaptive

813
00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:24.129
or pathological outcomes. The classic example being our genetic

814
00:53:24.129 --> 00:53:28.250
predisposition for preferences for sugary and fatty foods was

815
00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:30.949
great for our ancestors where these foods. WERE scarce

816
00:53:30.949 --> 00:53:34.379
and of high nutritional value. It motivated them to

817
00:53:34.379 --> 00:53:38.189
seek out these important nutritional resources, but now we're

818
00:53:38.189 --> 00:53:41.149
in this other environment where they're abundant rather than

819
00:53:41.149 --> 00:53:45.389
scarce, but we have these mismatched taste preferences, which

820
00:53:45.389 --> 00:53:48.709
lead to all sorts of problems like obesity, heart

821
00:53:48.709 --> 00:53:53.110
disease, and so on. And because humans lived as

822
00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:57.179
hunter-gatherers for the vast majority of our evolutionary history,

823
00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:01.909
The idea is that many of our traits, and

824
00:54:01.909 --> 00:54:04.590
this is, as, as I'm sure most of your

825
00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:07.959
listeners will have heard, this is the fundamental premise

826
00:54:07.959 --> 00:54:11.350
of evolutionary psychology. The idea here is that many

827
00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:13.870
of our traits may be adapted to a hunter

828
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:17.169
gatherer lifestyle, and now that we find ourselves in

829
00:54:17.169 --> 00:54:23.080
these industrialized contexts, which are vastly different, there's This

830
00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:28.020
may explain why certain neurological processes and psychological processes

831
00:54:28.439 --> 00:54:33.810
may manifest in a way which is uh pathological

832
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:39.639
or mala maladaptive. So by working with hunter-gatherers, we

833
00:54:39.639 --> 00:54:43.760
can start to see what is different and what

834
00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:48.129
features of the lifestyle. Might be contributing to our

835
00:54:48.129 --> 00:54:53.120
vulnerability to mental disorder in in the industrialized world.

836
00:54:54.270 --> 00:55:02.010
Right. So, in regards to this mismatch hypothesis, uh,

837
00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:09.139
applied to evolutionary psychiatry, what would be good examples

838
00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:14.620
of uh mental illnesses that could, could be the

839
00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:18.260
result of, um, an evolutionary mismatch?

840
00:55:19.739 --> 00:55:21.739
So I think one thing to say off the

841
00:55:21.739 --> 00:55:25.419
back is that there's to really validate any of

842
00:55:25.419 --> 00:55:29.540
that would be, you would need to demonstrate that

843
00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:33.100
the disorder has a lower prevalence or is non-existent

844
00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:36.179
in the hunter gatherer societies and that sort of

845
00:55:36.179 --> 00:55:39.540
research is more or less non-existent. There are a

846
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:43.100
few studies that have attempted to, you know, literally

847
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.260
2 or 3 that have looked at this, but.

848
00:55:45.574 --> 00:55:48.455
They're still, I would say quite preliminary, very small

849
00:55:48.455 --> 00:55:51.375
sample sizes. You know, it's great that some people

850
00:55:51.375 --> 00:55:53.854
are starting to do this, but I think everyone

851
00:55:53.854 --> 00:55:58.405
recognizes that the methods, sample sizes, and frequency of

852
00:55:58.405 --> 00:56:00.975
these studies would need to increase. So I don't

853
00:56:00.975 --> 00:56:05.975
think there's solid evidence yet, um, that any disorders

854
00:56:05.975 --> 00:56:12.199
are completely mismatched. Uh, BUT I would say. I'm

855
00:56:12.199 --> 00:56:18.310
not so sure that there are any disorders which

856
00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:24.679
would be completely absent in the hunter-gatherer society. I

857
00:56:24.679 --> 00:56:28.010
think many of them may have, well, some of

858
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:31.010
them may have lower prevalence and certainly some of

859
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:34.010
them may have different risk factors. So to give

860
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:37.169
an example, I do a lot of work on

861
00:56:37.169 --> 00:56:40.370
allomothering, and we've spoken about the evolutionary context there

862
00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:46.389
on on maternal support and child rearing. Um, And

863
00:56:46.389 --> 00:56:50.439
if you look in weird societies in weird some

864
00:56:50.439 --> 00:56:57.290
Western educated industrialized rich and democratic societies. Um, SOCIAL,

865
00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:01.939
low social support is. Up there, if not the

866
00:57:01.939 --> 00:57:06.899
most consistently, uh, consistently found as a risk factor

867
00:57:06.899 --> 00:57:12.719
for postnatal depression. Now, in hunter-gatherer communities where allomothering

868
00:57:12.719 --> 00:57:16.000
is normative and, you know, in some of the

869
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.479
work I did, I found that even over just

870
00:57:18.479 --> 00:57:22.669
a 12 hour period, an average infant or toddler

871
00:57:22.919 --> 00:57:27.320
had something like 10 individuals other than the mother

872
00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:32.689
providing hands-on attentive care, and that the mother was

873
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.149
dealing with less than 50% of responses to crying

874
00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:43.060
by herself. Everyone has social support there, right? It's

875
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:46.570
just so normative when you're living in these communities,

876
00:57:46.739 --> 00:57:50.939
you often got kin around, um, but everyone helps,

877
00:57:51.489 --> 00:57:55.500
which has helped with child rearing. So, interestingly, one

878
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:59.060
of the few studies that has been done looked

879
00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:05.520
at postnatal depression. And whilst the results were more

880
00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.030
complex than this, when it came to social support,

881
00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:12.409
it had no predictive effect. Which is unsurprising because

882
00:58:12.409 --> 00:58:14.810
everyone has loads of social support. So I think

883
00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:20.110
that's an example of a mismatch whereby Allomothering and

884
00:58:20.399 --> 00:58:24.879
cooperative child rearing has been so fundamental, one of

885
00:58:24.879 --> 00:58:29.719
the most fundamental components of human evolutionary history, and

886
00:58:29.719 --> 00:58:33.120
there are probably many aspects of both child and

887
00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:40.830
maternal psychology and sort of postpartum neuroendocrine state. Which

888
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:43.429
is adapted to be in that system. So it's,

889
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:46.270
it's no wonder here that a lack of social

890
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:49.070
support is such a large risk factor for postpartum

891
00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:54.270
depression because we're just not well equipped to deal

892
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:56.340
with that, and I'm at an age now where

893
00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:59.540
I have friends and relatives having children, and it

894
00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:03.350
feels like, at least in my experience and what

895
00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:08.060
I hear about the, the default. Is that mothers

896
00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:11.969
maybe not uh are not always experiencing clinical depression,

897
00:59:12.219 --> 00:59:15.939
but they are really struggling, it's really tough and

898
00:59:15.939 --> 00:59:18.540
you've got to wonder when it's normal for something

899
00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:23.219
to be extremely, an extreme struggle and extremely distressing.

900
00:59:23.379 --> 00:59:26.780
Something's not quite right there. So that's an example

901
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:29.429
of a mismatch where I think a new risk

902
00:59:29.429 --> 00:59:33.110
factor has emerged and increased our vulnerability to a

903
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:36.510
certain disorder. But there are many other hypotheses, but

904
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:38.949
they really, all of them really lacked testing at

905
00:59:38.949 --> 00:59:39.510
this point.

906
00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:45.159
OK, so, uh Doctor Choudhury, just before we go,

907
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:47.610
would you like to tell people where they can

908
00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:49.530
find your work on the internet?

909
00:59:50.649 --> 00:59:53.919
Sure, um, so I don't really have social media,

910
00:59:53.969 --> 00:59:58.360
but you can look up my, my website is

911
00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:04.810
nickil Choudhury.co.uk or if you search my name and

912
01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:07.709
research gate, all my papers are open access. So

913
01:00:07.709 --> 01:00:10.290
both on my website or on Research gate, you

914
01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:14.330
can read all of my papers, um, they're available

915
01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:16.290
