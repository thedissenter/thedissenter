00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.819
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.400
Center. I'm your host, Ricard Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.409 --> 00:00:07.929
joined by Doctor Doin Farmer. He is Director of

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.899
the Complexity Economics Program at the Institute for New

5
00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:15.270
Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin Martin School, Bailey

6
00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.590
Gifford, professor in the Mathematical Institute at the University

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.670
of Oxford and an external professor at the Santa

8
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.270
Fe Institute. And today we're talking about his recent

9
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.700
book Making Sense of Chaos, a Better Economics For

10
00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:31.389
a Better World. So, Doctor Farmer, welcome to the

11
00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.049
show. It's an honor to everyone.

12
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.310
Thanks. It's an honor to be here.

13
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.840
So, I mean, uh I was going to ask

14
00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:41.389
you about complexity science, but since I already have

15
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.619
a few interviews on the show where I addressed

16
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.919
that topic with people like Doctor Randall, Beer, Luis

17
00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.840
Favela and others, I think that people can go

18
00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:52.599
and watch those interviews to have a proper introduction

19
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.150
to the topic. So let me start right away

20
00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.840
by asking you in what ways is economics or

21
00:00:58.849 --> 00:01:01.639
the economy itself, a complex system.

22
00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:06.690
Well, complex systems are systems with emergent properties where

23
00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:10.889
the fundamental building blocks, whatever they are, the properties

24
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.209
of their properties are, or the properties of their,

25
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.220
that of what emerges from their interactions are fundamentally

26
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.180
different than the properties of the individual building blocks,

27
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.199
qualitatively different. And in the economy, we as people,

28
00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:29.360
if you imagine you were Robinson Crusoe, you'd have

29
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.069
a certain set of things you could do. But

30
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.110
we as a society can do things that are

31
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.650
vastly beyond what we can do as individuals. And,

32
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.239
and, and that's the sense in which the economy

33
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.800
is an emergent phenomenon.

34
00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:49.150
So tell us specifically about Ks theory, I know

35
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.099
that it is part of complexity theory, but tell

36
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.760
us a little bit about it. And then I

37
00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:57.730
will ask you about the specific phenomenon in economics.

38
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.309
OK. Um Well, chaos is, is something that happens

39
00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.709
in what are called dynamical systems. Like the ones

40
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.488
that come from physics, Newton's laws where um you

41
00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:15.188
get two properties sensitive dependence on initial conditions and

42
00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:19.018
what's called endogenous motion motion from within the system

43
00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:23.339
itself. And so the first property just means that

44
00:02:23.348 --> 00:02:26.569
you can have nearby initial conditions that lead to

45
00:02:26.578 --> 00:02:30.548
very different final states because things on average separate

46
00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:34.309
at an exponential rate. So you can have a,

47
00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.369
a system where uh e even if it's deterministic,

48
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.550
meaning that if you know the state, you know

49
00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.820
exactly where it's gonna go in the future. But,

50
00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.910
but a tiny difference in that initial state can

51
00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:52.070
cause it to go somewhere very different. So that's

52
00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:57.600
underlies what we often call randomness. And, and it

53
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.149
can lead to unpredictability like in the weather where

54
00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:04.899
the weather is fundamentally unpredictable, we just can't predict

55
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.210
it better than a certain amount. The endogenous motion

56
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.039
is means that if you think for example of

57
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.559
standing by a mountain stream, the stream beds fixed

58
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.539
the water coming down, the stream is coming down

59
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.529
at the same rate and yet the stream is

60
00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:27.880
constantly moving. Uh That's because of the inherent chaotic

61
00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.399
dynamics of the water in the stream that, that

62
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.520
generates that movement. So those two properties together are

63
00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:39.350
what we call chaos in, in the technical sense.

64
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.990
So then this is something that you address in

65
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.559
the book. Can we apply chaos theory to understanding

66
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.889
business cycles, for example?

67
00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:51.839
Well, I think we can, we can't prove that

68
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.289
yet. But um but the, the big question in

69
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.020
in about business cycles, which are, you know, variations

70
00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:04.899
in the output of the economy, are they happening

71
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.449
from external causes? As they did say with COVID

72
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.050
that business cycle was very much caused by outside

73
00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:17.238
effects. But in 2008, the 2008 financial crisis, it

74
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.359
came from within the economic system. And uh traditional

75
00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:26.619
models in economics don't have the capacity to generate

76
00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:29.859
endogenous motion that is motion from within the system.

77
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.619
Uh Whereas uh alternative models that I talk about

78
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.079
in the book that can show chaos do. And

79
00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:40.970
so it's a way of at least conceptually thinking

80
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.279
about why we have business cycles that just happen

81
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.299
spontaneously

82
00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:50.609
a and is the economy itself chaotic?

83
00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:54.279
Well, I think it is, I, I mean, again,

84
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.160
we can't prove that yet. But um but the

85
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.880
economies, I think there are many examples where the

86
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:08.079
economy creates its own change and really chaos is

87
00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:10.470
the only possible explanation for that.

88
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.190
Mhm. In the book, you also established at a

89
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.940
certain point, an analogy between the economy and organisms

90
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.679
in biology. Co could you explain that in what

91
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.859
ways can they be analogous?

92
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.970
Well, so sometimes it helps to think of these

93
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.290
analogies to understand why things do what they do.

94
00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:35.649
And the economy, I argue in the book is

95
00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:40.609
The Metabolism of Civilization. Now just to remind people

96
00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:44.200
what a metabolism is, metabolism is a digestive system

97
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.540
uh that takes in um materials from the outside

98
00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:54.059
world and converts them into materials that we need

99
00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.100
either to main to generate energy, to repair ourselves

100
00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:05.700
or to reproduce. And the economy similarly takes in

101
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.769
uh natural resources and combines them with human labor

102
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.869
and generates the goods and services that we people

103
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.899
need. So we're both a part of that process

104
00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:23.470
like cells in the human body. But but but

105
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:30.489
the the economy is collectively our metabolism. And I

106
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.750
also make analogies in the book to between ecologies

107
00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:38.890
and the economy. And I think both are true.

108
00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:44.489
The an ecology, ecology. I argue if you think

109
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.290
if you step back and think about it more

110
00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:50.589
generally is a study of the interactions of specialists

111
00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:55.480
with each other in a holistic way. And why

112
00:06:55.489 --> 00:06:58.519
do I say that? I mean, animal species are

113
00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:03.839
specialists. Grass is a specialist at taking earth and

114
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.489
water and sun and converting it into grass. Zebras

115
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.450
are specialist at taking grass and converting it to

116
00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:15.579
zebras. Lions are specialists at converting zebras into lions

117
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.609
and so uh and ecology and biology is in

118
00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:26.279
the study of ecosystems of interacting specialists and it

119
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.429
teaches certain lessons like even though lions don't interact

120
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.119
directly with grass, other than maybe the roll around

121
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.630
in it once in a while. Uh CHANGING the

122
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.170
population of lions can have a dramatic effect on

123
00:07:39.299 --> 00:07:41.630
the quantity of grass that we have. Because if

124
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.809
you get rid of the lions, the zebras may

125
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:49.059
become overpopulated and they'll eat the grass uh and

126
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.209
cause grass and which then cause erosion and has

127
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.859
all kinds of other side effects in uh in

128
00:07:55.869 --> 00:08:02.679
ecosystems. Um Similarly, in the economy we all occupy,

129
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.309
we take specialized roles as individuals, we take specialized

130
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.250
roles as companies and, and the economy is really

131
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.779
the study of these e eco ecosystems of specialized

132
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.760
actors. And that's actually the key to why the

133
00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:22.829
economy has emergent phenomena and could do things that

134
00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:26.119
are far beyond what individuals can do. Because by

135
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:32.859
specializing, we really um by specializing and trading, we

136
00:08:32.869 --> 00:08:35.840
can do things much more efficiently than we could

137
00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.929
if we all performed all the functions we needed

138
00:08:39.058 --> 00:08:39.780
to survive.

139
00:08:40.558 --> 00:08:44.309
Mhm So in order to understand the economy and

140
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.640
also I think to try to predict certain economic

141
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.479
phenomena, it's important, it's important for us to have

142
00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:55.619
simulations. But how do we set up a proper

143
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.840
simulation in economics?

144
00:08:58.229 --> 00:09:04.789
Uh Well, it requires insight and thought and but

145
00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:08.390
roughly speaking, uh we, we, we create a simulation

146
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.909
by first of all studying the economy asking who

147
00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:16.280
are the essential actors, how do they interact with

148
00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:21.219
each other? What are the institutions that are important

149
00:09:21.539 --> 00:09:26.320
for these interactions like markets? Um And we create

150
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.440
a simulation where we put all these elements together

151
00:09:29.479 --> 00:09:33.700
to try to mimic what the economy does. So

152
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.969
in a typical simulation, you have agents like households

153
00:09:37.979 --> 00:09:43.289
and firms who um receive information about what's happening

154
00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:46.109
in the economy who make decisions that we have

155
00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:50.229
to program into computer code. Those decisions have economic

156
00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:55.109
impact that generates new information as well as other

157
00:09:55.119 --> 00:09:58.989
information may flow in from outside. And so the

158
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.830
actors make another set of decisions and we repeat

159
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.729
the cycle. So in an, in a an economic

160
00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:09.440
simulation which we call agent based models, because the,

161
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.630
the, the key thing that makes it different from

162
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.369
the simulation of the physical system is that there

163
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.859
are agents who make decisions they have agency. And

164
00:10:19.239 --> 00:10:22.150
so, so that's pretty much the prescription we would

165
00:10:22.159 --> 00:10:26.359
follow in creating a simulation of an economic system

166
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.460
just to explore one particular example. Do you think

167
00:10:30.469 --> 00:10:34.590
that the housing bubble crisis that we had back

168
00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:38.099
in the two thousands could have been properly simulated

169
00:10:38.109 --> 00:10:39.010
and predicted.

170
00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:43.049
I think so. Um WE created a simulation of

171
00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.900
the housing crisis. Now we did so after the

172
00:10:45.909 --> 00:10:51.450
fact. But but in that simulation, uh we really

173
00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.489
mimicked all the things that go on when people

174
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.890
participate in housing markets. So we we created a

175
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.969
simulation of housing markets. And in the simulation, we

176
00:11:00.979 --> 00:11:04.760
mimicked everything that happens when people participate in housing

177
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:10.320
markets. So in the simulation, we had households who

178
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.349
could do choose to rent or buy a house,

179
00:11:14.809 --> 00:11:17.760
they could, they had to decide what kind of

180
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.799
house they would buy if they wanted to buy

181
00:11:19.809 --> 00:11:22.989
a house. And in doing that, they would get

182
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.510
together with a real estate agent who would help

183
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.280
them find a house of comparable the right quality

184
00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:33.270
of the house they wanted to buy. Uh They

185
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.590
typically then needed to take out a loan. So

186
00:11:35.599 --> 00:11:37.780
they would go to a bank who would decide

187
00:11:37.789 --> 00:11:40.409
whether or not it would approve the loan. And

188
00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:43.289
then um and then they would search for a

189
00:11:43.299 --> 00:11:45.820
house to buy or if they were a seller,

190
00:11:45.979 --> 00:11:49.169
the real estate agent would find a comparable house

191
00:11:49.179 --> 00:11:53.479
to theirs. Look at what price that house sold

192
00:11:53.489 --> 00:11:57.400
for. And then they would mark their, their first

193
00:11:57.409 --> 00:12:00.559
offer up from that and try and sell their

194
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.250
house. If that didn't work, they would mark it

195
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.179
down and they would do that every month until

196
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.369
either the house sold or they decided they didn't

197
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.859
want to sell it anymore. So we really mimic

198
00:12:10.869 --> 00:12:13.849
what happens in a real housing market. And we

199
00:12:13.859 --> 00:12:17.340
could do that with I, in that case, tens

200
00:12:17.349 --> 00:12:20.330
or hundreds of thousands of different agents, all of

201
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.619
whom were participating in the housing market. Uh And

202
00:12:24.659 --> 00:12:29.049
we saw behavior that closely resemble the behavior we

203
00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:33.890
saw in the housing bubble. We since uh used

204
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.320
a version of that model in interactions with the

205
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.229
bank of England to help them set housing policy.

206
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.530
And, and we were able to mimic the, the

207
00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:46.729
the bubble that at the time that we weren't

208
00:12:46.739 --> 00:12:48.760
supposed to use that word when interacting with the

209
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.619
Bank of England. But the bubble that the um

210
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.780
housing market and the United Kingdom was in and

211
00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.150
we simulated the policy. We, we, we, our, our

212
00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:05.409
housing simulation actually spontaneously generated bubbles endogenously from within

213
00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:08.299
the system. We would let it go up to

214
00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:09.929
the top of the bubble and then we would

215
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.770
impose the policy they wanted. And we were seeking

216
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:18.309
a policy that that wouldn't, would stop the bubble.

217
00:13:18.489 --> 00:13:20.840
But, but at the same time, wouldn't make the

218
00:13:20.849 --> 00:13:25.159
housing market crash in a destructive way. And so

219
00:13:25.169 --> 00:13:28.580
we tested the policy, it did produce roughly the

220
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.599
behavior that was wanted, meaning it flattened the bubble

221
00:13:31.609 --> 00:13:34.940
out and that was the policy that they implemented.

222
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.130
Now, I can't claim that we were um we

223
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.010
certainly weren't the only influence in their decision making.

224
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.580
But um things did work out roughly as we

225
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:49.729
suggested, they enacted the policy, housing market flattened out.

226
00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:54.599
OK. So before we get into other phenomena or

227
00:13:54.609 --> 00:13:58.599
explore other phenomena and examples of them that we

228
00:13:58.609 --> 00:14:03.169
can tackle through a complexity, a complexity systems approach

229
00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:06.400
to economics. Let me just ask you, what do

230
00:14:06.409 --> 00:14:10.960
you think are perhaps the main differences between standard

231
00:14:10.969 --> 00:14:15.559
economic theory and complexity in economics, particularly in the

232
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.869
ways it models our agents reason and make decisions.

233
00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:24.989
Well, they're completely different. Um In the standard economic

234
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.909
model, you start by, OK, you identify the agents

235
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.119
but then you assign them utility functions. So essentially

236
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:37.520
a scorecard of their preferences. What do they like?

237
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.210
What don't they like? And it gives a ranking

238
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.919
so that uh you then make the assumption that

239
00:14:43.929 --> 00:14:47.710
all the agents want to maximize their utility. And

240
00:14:47.719 --> 00:14:53.150
then you, you calculate the decisions those agents should

241
00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:57.450
all make to maximize their utility typically taking into

242
00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.159
account what all the other agents in the system

243
00:15:00.169 --> 00:15:01.909
are doing. So each agent looks at the other

244
00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:05.770
agents thinks about what they're doing and then makes

245
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.409
the decision that given that the other agents are

246
00:15:08.419 --> 00:15:12.099
all maximizing their utility will maximize their own agents

247
00:15:12.109 --> 00:15:16.809
utility. And you then, so you calculate that decision,

248
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.710
all those decisions, you then look at their economic

249
00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:23.429
consequences and that's the model. And you do this

250
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.960
by solving equations um in an agent based model

251
00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:31.309
in contrast, we ask, what are the decisions the

252
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.030
agents typically make? So if say that agent is

253
00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:37.570
a financial investor, we know they want to buy

254
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:42.950
undervalued assets if the agent is a household. Well,

255
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.229
we look at the behavioral data about what uh

256
00:15:46.239 --> 00:15:50.190
what are the patterns of consumption for households in

257
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.530
different categories? Poor households behave very differently than wealthy

258
00:15:54.539 --> 00:15:57.979
households. So we just look to see behaviorally what

259
00:15:57.989 --> 00:16:03.140
do they do. So we program those decisions into

260
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:08.869
computer code and then we run a model which

261
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.469
say to follow on in the example, the wealthy

262
00:16:11.479 --> 00:16:14.200
household will make one kind of decision, the poor

263
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.460
household will make a different kind of decision. And

264
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.340
um and then we simulate as I described before

265
00:16:21.349 --> 00:16:24.650
this process in a dynamic way where at every

266
00:16:24.659 --> 00:16:28.010
time step, the agents all make their decisions using

267
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.739
the algorithms we've given them. And we just let

268
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:33.530
that run to see what happens. So we might

269
00:16:33.539 --> 00:16:39.159
have an emergent phenomenon like an equilibrium where everything

270
00:16:39.169 --> 00:16:43.979
goes into a uh uh uh uh well to

271
00:16:43.989 --> 00:16:48.030
an economist, something like the optimal decision that they

272
00:16:48.039 --> 00:16:51.049
would have made or it may not in the

273
00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:54.219
case of housing markets, for example, is very important

274
00:16:54.549 --> 00:16:59.599
that housing markets actually don't clear meaning in housing

275
00:16:59.609 --> 00:17:02.830
markets typically supply and demand don't match very well

276
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.810
at all. Whereas in a standard model, they, they

277
00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:11.000
assume that supply and demand match condition called equilibrium.

278
00:17:11.469 --> 00:17:14.829
And so um we don't have to make those

279
00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:17.650
kind of assumptions. Mhm.

280
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.260
And is it possible or if it's not possible

281
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.319
yet? Do you think it would be possible to

282
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:27.680
model the entire economy through complexity theory?

283
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:32.790
Yes. Uh, WE'RE, uh, getting closer and closer to

284
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.060
being able to do that. We've built a macro

285
00:17:36.069 --> 00:17:39.750
micro macro model of the economy where we simulate

286
00:17:39.969 --> 00:17:44.849
individuals who are organized in the household and who,

287
00:17:45.109 --> 00:17:50.369
uh, you know, act both as consumers and as

288
00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:55.770
laborers. They work for specific firms, uh who employ

289
00:17:56.319 --> 00:18:00.569
uh individuals to act as labor, but who buy

290
00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:04.770
goods and services from other companies and then produce

291
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.969
a good or a service and, and they do

292
00:18:07.979 --> 00:18:10.060
that in an ongoing way. And so we can

293
00:18:10.069 --> 00:18:15.050
do that now for using millions of households and

294
00:18:15.069 --> 00:18:20.219
um, and hundreds of thousands of firms and we're

295
00:18:20.229 --> 00:18:22.540
in the process of scaling that up at the

296
00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:26.869
moment, we're still simulating typically one country or a

297
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.599
few countries at a time together with the rest

298
00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:32.750
of the world. Um We close the economy and

299
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.109
these kind of models meaning nothing is flowing in

300
00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:38.630
or out of the economy. It's a closed system

301
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.910
and we're working our way towards being able to

302
00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.729
do that for the whole global economy.

303
00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:51.089
Mhm. And what do we know specifically about inequality?

304
00:18:51.099 --> 00:18:52.920
How does it emerge?

305
00:18:53.689 --> 00:18:56.589
Well, one of the things you see in these

306
00:18:56.599 --> 00:19:02.050
models is inequality can emerge spontaneously uh even in

307
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:06.439
very simple models, um just luck can lead one

308
00:19:06.449 --> 00:19:10.369
person to become wealthy and another person to become

309
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.229
poor. Um When you add that in to things

310
00:19:14.239 --> 00:19:19.010
like differences in education, that becomes an even bigger

311
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.709
effect. And so in the kind of models we

312
00:19:22.719 --> 00:19:25.949
have, we can we, we actually start by taking

313
00:19:25.959 --> 00:19:31.199
the individuals and demographically matching them to real populations.

314
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:36.030
So we match things in terms of age education,

315
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:41.449
gender, race. And um and then we simulate the

316
00:19:41.459 --> 00:19:47.189
economy forward, we can explore what kind of policies

317
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:52.219
lead to, to less inequality in the economy and

318
00:19:52.229 --> 00:19:55.699
how do production in the, in the economy and

319
00:19:55.709 --> 00:20:00.479
inequality interact. Um You know, conventional wisdom is that

320
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:05.680
you mm more inequality is associated with higher GDP.

321
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.719
Uh That's not necessarily the case. In fact, you

322
00:20:08.729 --> 00:20:14.689
may have the opposite because economies, economic production can

323
00:20:14.699 --> 00:20:17.699
be limited by investment or it can be limited

324
00:20:17.709 --> 00:20:20.540
by demand. If you don't have people to sell

325
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.329
goods, to who have money to buy those goods,

326
00:20:23.579 --> 00:20:27.670
then that's bad for output. So in our models,

327
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.229
we're seeking to find the right trade off between

328
00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:35.250
the two so that we at least understand what

329
00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:40.750
that interaction is uh without prejudging uh what's good

330
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.849
or bad. We at least want to understand the

331
00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:48.030
cause and effect of inequality and economic uh production

332
00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.400
and that's research in progress right now. I I

333
00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:55.229
can't tell you the answer, but my hypothesis is

334
00:20:55.239 --> 00:20:58.560
that over the last 20 years, the economy has

335
00:20:58.569 --> 00:21:02.560
really been demand limited and GDP would have gone

336
00:21:02.569 --> 00:21:05.040
up if we had less inequality.

337
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.430
Mhm. So, uh now I would like to ask

338
00:21:09.439 --> 00:21:12.069
you a little bit about markets. So what are

339
00:21:12.079 --> 00:21:15.530
some of the main claims made in standard economics

340
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:20.709
about free markets? And in what ways can markets

341
00:21:20.719 --> 00:21:22.109
be inefficient?

342
00:21:22.939 --> 00:21:28.530
Well, um you know, the standard claim and OK,

343
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.040
this, here we have to be a little bit

344
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.189
subtle because there, there's a lot of different views

345
00:21:34.199 --> 00:21:37.979
among mainstream economists about this as well. And I

346
00:21:37.989 --> 00:21:41.800
think uh many of them would agree with what

347
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:45.339
I'm about to say, which is that, um though

348
00:21:45.349 --> 00:21:49.959
some wouldn't, um uh you know, there's many different

349
00:21:49.969 --> 00:21:54.069
flavors of capitalism. Swedish capitalism is very different than

350
00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:59.290
American capitalism. And, and there's a question about how

351
00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.869
much regulation does capitalism take at some, at one

352
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.979
extreme? You have libertarians who say, oh, well, we

353
00:22:05.989 --> 00:22:08.790
should just get rid of all the regulations, then

354
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.290
capitalism will do its job and everything will be

355
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.579
great. Uh Others who would say, well, no, we

356
00:22:16.589 --> 00:22:21.390
need to, we need to control capitalism. Um We

357
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.979
need to make regulations to deal with externalities like

358
00:22:25.989 --> 00:22:32.319
pollution. We need to um to do things to

359
00:22:32.329 --> 00:22:36.770
keep inequality from just running away and becoming extreme.

360
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.459
Uh And uh and so we really have to

361
00:22:41.469 --> 00:22:45.689
manage capitalism in order to have capitalism do what

362
00:22:45.699 --> 00:22:48.109
it, the good things that it can do for

363
00:22:48.119 --> 00:22:53.770
us. And so we're exploring those tradeoffs again. My

364
00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.459
conjecture is that regulating capitalism in the right, kinds

365
00:22:58.469 --> 00:23:03.109
of ways is actually good for capitalism and that

366
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.270
it leads to more output, uh, leads to better

367
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.609
outcomes for people and it's even good for rich

368
00:23:09.619 --> 00:23:13.969
people. So, uh, but, you know, again, that's work

369
00:23:13.979 --> 00:23:14.770
in progress,

370
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.109
right? Uh, BUT I, I mean, can we, how

371
00:23:19.119 --> 00:23:23.270
can we make sense of, for example, market crashes?

372
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.650
Well, we've got to ask why the market crashes

373
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.060
occur. And so now we're slipping over into what

374
00:23:31.069 --> 00:23:34.739
the financial system does because market crashes are part

375
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.599
of the financial system. And in the book, I

376
00:23:37.609 --> 00:23:41.339
make the analogy between financial markets and the enteric

377
00:23:41.349 --> 00:23:45.459
nervous system also called the gut nervous system, which

378
00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.920
many people like I wasn't aware of it until

379
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.180
I started studying this more carefully. But, you know,

380
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:55.420
in a human being, you have the, the enteric

381
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.959
nervous system, your gut nervous system, you have as

382
00:23:57.969 --> 00:24:00.380
many neurons as a cat does in the cat

383
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:04.790
brain. And if that, if that gut nervous system

384
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.089
stops functioning, you'll die unless you're fed intravenously because

385
00:24:09.099 --> 00:24:11.900
you can't digest food without it. We tend to

386
00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:14.119
think, oh, you know, you eat the food, it

387
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:17.339
goes down your esophagus and lands in your stomach

388
00:24:17.349 --> 00:24:19.660
and then it's just like a container with some

389
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.959
chemicals in it and that's it. But actually your

390
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.500
enteric nervous system is doing all kinds of things

391
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.359
to help you digest that food. And if you,

392
00:24:29.369 --> 00:24:33.189
it doesn't do those things, you die. Um, THE

393
00:24:33.199 --> 00:24:36.349
financial systems at least it should be like that

394
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.239
and that the financial system is telling us about

395
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:45.050
things like setting prices properly so that the incentives

396
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.829
are set the right way so that people do

397
00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:50.469
the right things to make us all better off.

398
00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.670
Uh I worry to be honest that it, it's

399
00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.310
often wildly off the mark in the modern financial

400
00:24:57.319 --> 00:25:01.079
system. A lot of the modern financial system is

401
00:25:01.089 --> 00:25:06.040
really like a casino for speculators that has instabilities

402
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.630
that can do quite the opposite. And I think

403
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:16.349
that's what market crashes are often about. Um uh

404
00:25:17.579 --> 00:25:23.540
FINANCIAL speculation leads to overshoots and undershoots that cause

405
00:25:23.569 --> 00:25:28.579
the financial system to do dysfunctional things. And the

406
00:25:28.589 --> 00:25:31.400
2008 crisis was a very good example of that.

407
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:36.199
We had uh new financial instruments that people didn't

408
00:25:36.209 --> 00:25:40.880
understand very well, mortgage backed securities, uh had side

409
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:44.920
effects that people hadn't thought through. So that when

410
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:50.349
the housing market uh dropped uh mortgage backed securities

411
00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:53.989
which were hugely invested in by financial institutions all

412
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.359
over the world became almost worthless. And that caused

413
00:26:00.369 --> 00:26:04.359
the whole credit system globally to cut back, which

414
00:26:04.369 --> 00:26:07.199
then caused things in the real economy to stop

415
00:26:07.209 --> 00:26:12.060
working because businesses do need money to, they need

416
00:26:12.069 --> 00:26:14.910
credit to go about what they're doing. So when

417
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.150
the supply of credit got shut off, the economy

418
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.790
suffered. So, but to even think about things that

419
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.560
way, you have to have a way of looking

420
00:26:24.569 --> 00:26:28.290
at the financial system that admits that it's not

421
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:33.489
perfect. Whereas the standard efficient market hypothesis that most

422
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.170
financial theory is based on doesn't even allow that

423
00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.969
possibility. By definition, the financial system is working perfectly.

424
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:48.040
In contrast, I have um uh a theory of

425
00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:53.030
market ecology that views the economy as an ecosystem

426
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.359
of specialized traders in which things can go wrong.

427
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.260
And where I think, I argue that we have

428
00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:05.969
to actually understand that egos ecosystem to, to understand

429
00:27:05.979 --> 00:27:08.380
why the financial system is working as it is

430
00:27:08.689 --> 00:27:10.239
and why it malfunctions.

431
00:27:11.099 --> 00:27:15.069
Mhm So since you mentioned the 2008 financial crisis,

432
00:27:15.079 --> 00:27:17.880
I have this question saved for later for the

433
00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.069
end of the interview. But let me ask you,

434
00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:24.219
let me ask you now. Uh So even if

435
00:27:24.229 --> 00:27:28.540
we are able to predict any financial crisis, do

436
00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:31.349
you think that we can avoid it or prevent

437
00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:32.000
it in any way?

438
00:27:32.689 --> 00:27:35.739
I think so. But you know, uh the proof

439
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.550
is in the pudding, we haven't done it yet.

440
00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:42.170
Uh Of course, it's always tricky if I predict

441
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.510
there's gonna be a financial crisis and then we

442
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.839
take some actions and we don't have a financial

443
00:27:46.849 --> 00:27:51.790
crisis. Well, was my prediction, right? Uh It's a

444
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.650
deep, deep question. I think we often make predictions

445
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.670
precisely. So those predictions don't come true because we're

446
00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.229
making conditional predictions. If we continue acting as we

447
00:28:02.239 --> 00:28:05.859
are now something bad will happen, so we change

448
00:28:05.869 --> 00:28:09.400
our actions so that bad thing won't happen. And

449
00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.119
to really understand whether those kind of predictions are

450
00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.420
working, you need to make lots of them and

451
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:18.310
gain experience and, and you need to make clear

452
00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:23.430
how each prediction depends on the conditions underlying the

453
00:28:23.439 --> 00:28:27.449
prediction. But, but I very much believe that that's

454
00:28:27.459 --> 00:28:32.050
true. I think, you know, we we in the

455
00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.750
housing market that I mentioned the housing market agent

456
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:41.439
based model, we showed how um how uh that

457
00:28:41.449 --> 00:28:45.520
we could predict the housing crisis. And we showed

458
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:49.760
that um lending policy was the primary cause of

459
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.000
the hou housing crisis. And that if we changed

460
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.790
lending policy in a counterfactual, then we had a

461
00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.819
much less severe housing bubble, it didn't go up

462
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.839
and it didn't go down, it had much steadier

463
00:29:04.849 --> 00:29:10.439
path. And, and we got that behavior by sticking

464
00:29:10.579 --> 00:29:15.359
to the previous lending policies of, you know, tighter

465
00:29:15.369 --> 00:29:20.300
credit and 30 year fixed term loans and rather

466
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.489
than the crazy kinds of loans that were being

467
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.349
given out during the housing bubble and, and lending

468
00:29:26.359 --> 00:29:29.380
to people who really didn't have the capacity to

469
00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:33.310
make the payments on their house in, in our

470
00:29:33.319 --> 00:29:36.150
alternative that didn't happen. And we had a much

471
00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.670
smoother path. So it's at least a proof of

472
00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.310
principle. But until we do it in real life,

473
00:29:41.319 --> 00:29:43.469
we won't know. And as I said, even then

474
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.709
it's gonna take some experience uh because you don't

475
00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:51.180
know that you, when you avoid a bad thing

476
00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:55.300
by making a prediction, uh it takes some experience

477
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.890
like if you can show you avoid these bad

478
00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:00.219
things for many years in a row then, then

479
00:30:00.229 --> 00:30:01.900
you go. Oh, ok. Maybe it's working.

480
00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:06.699
Mhm. So, let me ask you now, changing topics

481
00:30:06.709 --> 00:30:08.780
a little bit. What is it that in your

482
00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.739
book you call Climate Economics?

483
00:30:12.459 --> 00:30:15.949
Well, you know, we are in the midst of

484
00:30:15.959 --> 00:30:21.579
a major economic transition uh targeted at uh stopping

485
00:30:21.589 --> 00:30:25.239
the emission of greenhouse gasses. We need to get

486
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:30.060
to net zero quickly. And so there's a lot

487
00:30:30.069 --> 00:30:32.439
of debate about how we should do that, how

488
00:30:32.449 --> 00:30:35.300
much it's gonna cost us? What is the right

489
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.229
path, how should we invest in order to get

490
00:30:38.239 --> 00:30:43.040
there? And um so I've been studying that in

491
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:47.300
two ways. One is by collecting data on past

492
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:52.469
transitions, past technology transitions to uh see how they

493
00:30:52.479 --> 00:30:56.650
work, what, what are the patterns that are consistent

494
00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:02.119
in those transitions? And, and, and then also by

495
00:31:02.709 --> 00:31:07.949
creating simulations of the transition to understand what uh

496
00:31:07.969 --> 00:31:11.500
how it's likely to happen and, and to give

497
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:14.479
us insight about how to make it happen faster

498
00:31:14.989 --> 00:31:20.310
and better, smoother and so forth. And so we've

499
00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:24.140
learned several different lessons from these studies. One is

500
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:29.630
that technologies behave very differently on one hand, um

501
00:31:30.209 --> 00:31:33.680
uh you know, we have some technologies like fossil

502
00:31:33.689 --> 00:31:37.260
fuels that cost about the same once you adjust

503
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:39.810
for inflation as they did 100 and 40 years

504
00:31:39.819 --> 00:31:45.390
ago. And other technologies like solar energy that's 10,000

505
00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.310
times cheaper than it was when it was first

506
00:31:48.319 --> 00:31:53.339
commercially deployed in a vanguard satellite in 1958. So

507
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:58.469
these technologies are behaving very differently. And we're incredibly

508
00:31:58.479 --> 00:32:01.719
lucky that just when we really need low carbon

509
00:32:01.729 --> 00:32:07.770
or zero carbon technologies, uh renewable technologies like solar

510
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:13.949
energy, wind lithium ion batteries, um green hydrogen are

511
00:32:13.959 --> 00:32:17.290
all entering the stage, are all dropping in price

512
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:20.349
quite quickly so that solar and wind are already

513
00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:25.430
competitive with fossil fuels and we predict will become

514
00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:31.270
significantly cheaper through time. So that in fact, due

515
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.250
to the presence of renewables, energy will become cheaper

516
00:32:34.339 --> 00:32:39.880
than it's ever been. And uh and also help

517
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:44.520
us deal with climate change. Uh In fact, we

518
00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:47.209
argue in one of our papers that a rapid

519
00:32:47.219 --> 00:32:53.339
transition will save us collectively, the order of $12

520
00:32:53.349 --> 00:32:55.810
trillion or very likely save us that we make

521
00:32:55.819 --> 00:32:59.650
probabilistic predictions about that. So in other words, we

522
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.319
should pursue that even if we didn't have uh

523
00:33:03.329 --> 00:33:06.949
climate change to worry about it also, by the

524
00:33:06.959 --> 00:33:10.829
way, has other nice side effects, like less pollution,

525
00:33:11.199 --> 00:33:18.790
more stable energy prices, uh uh energy security, less

526
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:27.209
uh less other polluting effects. Um So, so there

527
00:33:27.219 --> 00:33:30.239
are many other reasons why we should actually pursue

528
00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:34.260
the green energy transition and make it happen as

529
00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:35.180
fast as we can.

530
00:33:35.979 --> 00:33:39.439
Mhm Since we're talking about the climate here, how

531
00:33:39.449 --> 00:33:42.939
do we predict climate and the weather? And are

532
00:33:42.949 --> 00:33:46.959
there similarities between how we go about doing that?

533
00:33:46.969 --> 00:33:51.260
And uh complexity theory? Applied to economics.

534
00:33:51.689 --> 00:33:53.839
Yeah. So the way we predict the weather is

535
00:33:53.849 --> 00:33:56.199
very different than the way we predict. At least

536
00:33:56.209 --> 00:34:00.520
the way mainstream economics predicts the economy. You know,

537
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:05.380
in the weather, we now do um in numerical

538
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.580
weather prediction, we have a model, a physical model

539
00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:13.129
of the weather. And we make measurements throughout the

540
00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:16.978
globe all the time. Through combination of satellites and

541
00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:20.708
weather stations. We put those measurements into a simulation

542
00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:24.228
of the weather that we use supercomputers to make

543
00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:26.510
predictions about what the weather is going to be

544
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.199
tomorrow. And up to roughly next week beyond that,

545
00:34:30.208 --> 00:34:35.060
we can't really do anything very useful. Um And,

546
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:40.580
and that's something we've invested, you know, hundreds of

547
00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:45.320
billions of dollars into doing that has many economic

548
00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:50.600
benefits. And that involved a sustained effort by uh

549
00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:56.159
physical scientists that began in 1950 has been going

550
00:34:56.168 --> 00:34:58.929
ever since and getting bigger and bigger and more

551
00:34:58.939 --> 00:35:01.919
and more important ever since it took them 30

552
00:35:01.929 --> 00:35:05.030
years to break, even with subjective weather forecasters who

553
00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.620
would predict the weather, you know, by just looking

554
00:35:07.629 --> 00:35:11.239
at weather maps and past experience and using rules

555
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:18.040
of thumb. Um BUT it became better in roughly

556
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.919
1980. And since then, we've had, it's continued to

557
00:35:21.929 --> 00:35:25.780
get better and better. In contrast, when we predict

558
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:31.530
the economy, we have relatively small models that don't

559
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:35.209
use any much fine grained information about the economy

560
00:35:35.739 --> 00:35:39.459
uh that try and predict, make economic predictions in

561
00:35:39.469 --> 00:35:44.580
aggregate form these predictions are based on ideas from

562
00:35:44.989 --> 00:35:47.090
uh that I described before and the way the

563
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:52.820
models are built. And um uh and they don't

564
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:57.239
use big data, they don't use serious computing power.

565
00:35:57.909 --> 00:36:01.530
In contrast, in our complexity economics models, like the

566
00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.840
macro model I mentioned, we simulate the behavior of

567
00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:09.020
millions or tens of millions of households and hundreds

568
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:13.229
of thousands or more firms. And we simulate that

569
00:36:13.239 --> 00:36:17.949
interaction in some detail, we crave information on the

570
00:36:17.959 --> 00:36:21.149
finest grain possible because that's the scale at which

571
00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:24.590
the model is built. And so we're really mimicking

572
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.169
the same style of prediction that's used in weather

573
00:36:28.179 --> 00:36:31.909
forecasting. And we think that if if we get

574
00:36:31.919 --> 00:36:34.840
the resources to bring this to completion, we could

575
00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:39.760
have a dramatic improvement in economic forecasting along the

576
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:43.179
lines of the one that happened with weather.

577
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:49.580
So when talking about potential solutions for climate change

578
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:53.709
earlier, you mentioned renewable energy. Are there any other

579
00:36:53.719 --> 00:36:58.639
solutions that particularly from an economic standpoint? You, you

580
00:36:58.649 --> 00:37:00.100
you would suggest,

581
00:37:00.929 --> 00:37:05.120
well, I think actually for the, for the energy

582
00:37:05.129 --> 00:37:08.429
part of the economy, which is, you know, it's

583
00:37:08.439 --> 00:37:12.429
only three or 4% of GDP to produce energy.

584
00:37:12.719 --> 00:37:15.020
But without energy, the whole economy grinds to a

585
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:18.850
halt. So tourism is a comparable part of GDP.

586
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.909
As we saw with COVID, we can live without

587
00:37:20.919 --> 00:37:22.699
tourism for a year or two if we have

588
00:37:22.709 --> 00:37:25.360
to. It's not fun, but we could do it

589
00:37:25.439 --> 00:37:29.850
without energy, we would die So, so energy is

590
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.989
really, really important and it makes 75% of the

591
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.620
emissions that that of greenhouse gas emissions. So I

592
00:37:37.629 --> 00:37:42.389
think renewable energy and and appropriate storage can really

593
00:37:42.399 --> 00:37:46.330
solve the the energy part of emissions. So we

594
00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.489
get rid of 75% that way. And I think

595
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.620
we're on track to do that in about 20

596
00:37:51.629 --> 00:37:57.810
years. Um In contrast, land use and farming, uh

597
00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.719
those are harder problems and we aren't making the

598
00:38:01.729 --> 00:38:06.159
same kind of rapid progress there. So, so we

599
00:38:06.169 --> 00:38:08.199
need to focus more attention on that. There are

600
00:38:08.209 --> 00:38:11.120
a few other things like cement, cement makes a

601
00:38:11.129 --> 00:38:14.310
lot of greenhouse gas emissions. I think that's also

602
00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.929
solvable, but land use is the hard one that

603
00:38:17.939 --> 00:38:22.659
um uh remains to be done. I think there

604
00:38:22.669 --> 00:38:26.699
are solutions but we need to be making that

605
00:38:26.709 --> 00:38:28.340
change faster than we are now.

606
00:38:29.679 --> 00:38:32.399
Um And what about one solution that some people

607
00:38:32.409 --> 00:38:36.189
talk about nuclear energy? What do you think about

608
00:38:36.199 --> 00:38:36.219
it?

609
00:38:36.429 --> 00:38:40.139
Well, you know, I'm I believe we should take

610
00:38:40.149 --> 00:38:44.820
the cheapest and quickest way to make these changes

611
00:38:45.179 --> 00:38:49.290
and nuclear energy is neither cheap nor quick. It

612
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:53.389
um nuclear energy now nuclear energy came into being

613
00:38:53.399 --> 00:38:56.239
as a commercial way to make energy at roughly

614
00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:01.510
the same time as solar photovoltaics. Um WHEREAS solar

615
00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.810
photo tanks have dropped in cost by a factor

616
00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:08.760
of 10,000 nuclear energy if is if anything more

617
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:14.350
expensive now. Um And so there's no trend towards

618
00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:19.229
becoming cheaper. People are talking about small modular reactors

619
00:39:19.239 --> 00:39:22.949
as a way to change that and it might

620
00:39:22.959 --> 00:39:26.830
work to make it cheaper but small modular reactors.

621
00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.149
First of all, nuclear power, inherently, the reason they

622
00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:33.040
built nuclear power plants so big is because of

623
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:36.639
economies of scale. Uh YOU know things like the

624
00:39:36.649 --> 00:39:40.050
ratio of the the cost of the material has

625
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.479
to do with the surface of the vessels, the

626
00:39:42.489 --> 00:39:44.919
then the surface to volume ratio gets bigger as

627
00:39:44.929 --> 00:39:47.330
you build the plant bigger and bigger. And so

628
00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.479
there are various reasons why they make nuclear plants

629
00:39:49.489 --> 00:39:52.360
big. So small modular reactors start out with a

630
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:55.510
handicap. They're gonna be more expensive to start with

631
00:39:55.989 --> 00:39:59.959
than traditional nuclear power, which is already more expensive

632
00:39:59.969 --> 00:40:02.949
than the alternatives and shows no pattern of getting

633
00:40:02.959 --> 00:40:07.219
better, small modular reactors will very likely drop in

634
00:40:07.229 --> 00:40:10.540
costs through time because of mass production, but it's

635
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:13.300
not mass production on the same scale as solar

636
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.000
panels. You know, a solar panel is a pretty

637
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:21.590
cheap thing that you can really mass produce dramatically.

638
00:40:21.729 --> 00:40:24.530
Small modular reactor is not going to be on

639
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.929
the same scale. I don't think the rates at

640
00:40:26.939 --> 00:40:29.699
which the cost will drop will be as dramatic

641
00:40:29.709 --> 00:40:32.139
as they are for solar energy. And I don't

642
00:40:32.149 --> 00:40:35.050
think it's ever gonna catch up with solar energy

643
00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:39.060
plus storage, but we'll see. Uh I just think

644
00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:42.010
it's, it's not an investment that I would bet

645
00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:42.379
on.

646
00:40:43.679 --> 00:40:46.459
OK. So I have one final topic I would

647
00:40:46.469 --> 00:40:48.830
like to explore wi with you today. We've already

648
00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:53.270
talked a little bit about inequality before. So, uh

649
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.770
it's also one of the big issues we have

650
00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:00.189
to tackle nowadays. So how can we tackle it

651
00:41:00.199 --> 00:41:03.459
through the kind of framework that you present in

652
00:41:03.469 --> 00:41:04.100
your book?

653
00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:09.760
Well, I really think we can understand uh you

654
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.909
know, whatever we think of a new policy. The

655
00:41:11.919 --> 00:41:14.399
first question, one of the questions we should ask

656
00:41:14.409 --> 00:41:17.580
right away is what does it do to inequality?

657
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.600
Government agencies that evaluate policies already look at questions

658
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.949
like what does it do to GDP maybe what

659
00:41:24.959 --> 00:41:28.159
does it do to aggregate unemployment? But they don't,

660
00:41:28.239 --> 00:41:30.679
they aren't capable of looking at inequality because the

661
00:41:30.689 --> 00:41:35.419
models can't handle that because traditional mainstream models though

662
00:41:35.429 --> 00:41:37.570
there is a whole branch trying to make uh

663
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:42.360
what are called heterogeneous agent models. Uh That, that

664
00:41:42.459 --> 00:41:44.780
in principle can look at inequality, but they have

665
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.360
to because these models are so hard to solve,

666
00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.219
they have to put it in, in a very

667
00:41:49.229 --> 00:41:55.010
stylized, not fully realistic way. And so at the

668
00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.080
end of the day, the answers are not very

669
00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:02.080
reliable. Um In contrast, we have it automatically in

670
00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:06.620
our models and, and so any policy that we

671
00:42:06.629 --> 00:42:08.469
want to look at, we can ask, we can

672
00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.870
answer the question, what will it do to inequality?

673
00:42:12.219 --> 00:42:14.100
And I think that needs to be a routine

674
00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:18.590
part of our evaluation because you know what I

675
00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:22.209
hope we can do with complexity economics is enter

676
00:42:22.219 --> 00:42:26.510
into a new phase where economic models genuinely provide

677
00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:30.469
useful guidance that is we can answer cause effect

678
00:42:30.479 --> 00:42:34.699
questions. If we implement this policy, what will happen

679
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.780
if we implement this other policy? What will happen?

680
00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.949
Inequality needs to be part of the, what will

681
00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:44.560
happen and we need to get answers that we

682
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:48.969
can trust traditional economic models. Don't have a very

683
00:42:48.979 --> 00:42:52.969
good track record for predicting the effects of policies.

684
00:42:53.399 --> 00:42:56.899
Great. So the book is again Making Sense of

685
00:42:56.909 --> 00:42:59.939
Chaos, a better economics for a better world. I'm

686
00:42:59.949 --> 00:43:02.199
leaving a link to it in the description of

687
00:43:02.209 --> 00:43:05.090
the interview and doctor Farmer. Just before we go,

688
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.620
would you like to mention any places on the

689
00:43:07.629 --> 00:43:10.699
internet where people can find you and your work?

690
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.699
Well, I have a website Joan farmer.com. Uh THE

691
00:43:14.709 --> 00:43:18.219
Institute for New Economic Thinking has a website with

692
00:43:18.409 --> 00:43:21.360
our work. Um You know, I've also started a

693
00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:25.800
company called Macrocosm whose goal is to scale up

694
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.979
these ideas and reduce them to practice and provide

695
00:43:28.989 --> 00:43:33.139
commercial solutions. So this isn't just an academic exercise.

696
00:43:33.629 --> 00:43:37.209
And um so we also have a website and

697
00:43:37.399 --> 00:43:41.929
for anybody who's interested in economic advice, uh we,

698
00:43:41.939 --> 00:43:44.260
we can do it and you know, we're particularly

699
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:48.439
for non commercial. Uh WE try to make our,

700
00:43:48.449 --> 00:43:52.419
our research as open as possible for non-commercial use

701
00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:56.719
because we really want to see things change. Uh

702
00:43:56.729 --> 00:43:58.600
OK, we're trying to make a little money but

703
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:01.649
we really wanna change and, and provide the world

704
00:44:01.659 --> 00:44:05.149
with better economic advice. So all of those sources

705
00:44:05.159 --> 00:44:06.209
um could be useful.
