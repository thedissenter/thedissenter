Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.679
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lob. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.550
joined by Doctor Gail Dines. She is Professor Emerita

4
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.340
of Sociology and women's studies at Willock College. She

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.310
specializes in the study of pornography and she's also

6
00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:19.219
the ceo of culture, reframed and nonprofit built to

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.229
build resilience and resistance in kids to pornography and

8
00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.569
hyper sexualized media. And today we're focusing mostly on

9
00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.098
her book Porn Land. How porn has hijacked our

10
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.450
sexuality. So, Doctor Dimes, welcome to the show. It's

11
00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:36.290
a pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.560
It's a pleasure. Yes.

13
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.659
Ok. So let me start by asking you, is

14
00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:46.909
there any particular definition of pornography? Would you define

15
00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:50.419
pornography in any specific way or is that, or

16
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.060
is it one of those things that we know

17
00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:56.959
when we see it or we can identify it

18
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.709
when we see it? But it's really hard to

19
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.419
define.

20
00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.340
No, it's not. First of all. Um, CONSIDERING you've

21
00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:07.629
got a multibillion dollar industry called pornography, if they

22
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.980
produce por pornography, which is what they're out for,

23
00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:15.019
then I'm happy to go with their definition. It's

24
00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:17.849
like when you're discussing any other industry, like fast

25
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.449
food, you're not asked to define it. You look

26
00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:22.160
at the industry and you see what the product

27
00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:24.919
is. Um But as we get talking, we will

28
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.370
talk about how at the core of pornography is

29
00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:31.699
the debasement and dehumanization of women. That's what makes

30
00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:35.309
porn porn. So, um I don't really get into

31
00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:38.949
definitional issues because it doesn't make any sense. You

32
00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:42.400
wouldn't get into that for any other industry. Um,

33
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.480
BECAUSE, you know, the, uh, car industry, as I

34
00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:50.250
said, makes cars you don't talk about, it has

35
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.279
an engine and a steering wheel and this, you

36
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.959
know, you look at the industry and you see

37
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.809
what they produce,

38
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.230
right? Uh Could you tell us a little bit

39
00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:02.989
about the history of pornography, particularly in the US?

40
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.290
Because there are bits that might be very interesting

41
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.270
here for us to explore, particularly how it's changed

42
00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.949
over the course of the last few decades, particularly

43
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.589
with the introduction of the internet and all of

44
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.619
the different kinds of media we have nowadays.

45
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.619
So I would say that if you want to

46
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.839
look at the modern day pornography industry, you have

47
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.039
to start with Playboy. And the reason for that

48
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.949
is that Playboy really mainstreamed pornography. It took it

49
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.259
out of the back streets and CD corners and

50
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.070
put it on the coffee tables of often middle

51
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.240
class white men. Um, NOW what was interesting about

52
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.160
that was, this was a very conservative time during

53
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.610
the fifties in the US. And so the question

54
00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.520
is how did a man, New Hefner manage to

55
00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.419
build an empire on pornography in what was a

56
00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.220
conservative time? And one of the things he did

57
00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:02.789
that was very clever was he really built a

58
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.425
magazine that spoke to the aspi of the up

59
00:03:07.434 --> 00:03:11.104
and coming white middle class man who had for

60
00:03:11.115 --> 00:03:15.085
the first time, really disposable income. And so you

61
00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:18.404
had this new sort of middle class and remember

62
00:03:18.414 --> 00:03:21.875
a lot of them were born during the depression

63
00:03:21.884 --> 00:03:24.695
and the war and they were very frugal and

64
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.445
I know it sounds ridiculous, but they didn't know

65
00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:28.735
how to spend money at that point because you

66
00:03:28.744 --> 00:03:31.695
saved money. So what he really produced was a

67
00:03:31.705 --> 00:03:39.720
magazine that was based upon, um teaching these men

68
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.830
what consumption looked like. You'd have whole articles on

69
00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:48.929
what clothes to wear, um what uh desk to

70
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.419
buy, what to eat. And of course, what really

71
00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:56.199
attracted these men was the centerfolds and the images,

72
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.850
you know, he said, um people said I excuse

73
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.339
me, um I only read pornography for the articles.

74
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.169
Well, that's ridiculous. You know, I felt like writing

75
00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.889
to them once into pornography and saying, you know,

76
00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.050
no one's looking at the pictures. Of course, it

77
00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:13.210
was the pictures that really made it popular. But

78
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.710
he did it in a way that was sort

79
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.200
of um surrounded by a middle class lifestyle. They

80
00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.559
had very um well known writers in there. And

81
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.250
they once said that if they took um the

82
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.750
pictures out of Playboy. Playboy would die like a

83
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.839
dead dog. And I would say if you took

84
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.679
the articles out of Playboy, it would die because

85
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.390
you wouldn't have a cover, you know, you needed

86
00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:40.089
a cover to say why did you have these

87
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.950
images of women on, you know, out there in

88
00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:47.179
the public? So he sort of really introduced soft

89
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.579
core, made it mainstream. Then in the sixties, Penthouse

90
00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:56.059
came in and the goal was for Penthouse Bob

91
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.940
Guccione, who'd been in it, publishing in England was

92
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.609
to come to the US and to really make

93
00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:05.500
it um sort of really make Penthouse the number

94
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.929
one pornography magazine. However, there was a war between

95
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.950
Playboy and Penthouse of who could produce the most

96
00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:16.750
explicit images. And in the end, Penthouse really lost

97
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.420
the war and the reason is their images were

98
00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:23.109
too explicit for advertisers. Cos remember this is how

99
00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:27.459
you make money in the media. So in those

100
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.630
days, um so what he did was um not

101
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.329
only did he um sexualize, not only did he

102
00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:39.869
can modify sexuality. This is Hugh Hefner, he sexualized

103
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.049
commodities and said if you consume at the level

104
00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:47.750
that we tell you to in Playboy, then you

105
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.480
can get these women who are centerfolds and all

106
00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:54.630
the other images. So he actually understood not to

107
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.730
cross a line. So the because the advertisers with

108
00:05:57.739 --> 00:05:59.640
them and they did start, by the way, at

109
00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:02.309
some point when there was a battle between Playboy

110
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.910
and Penthouse to pull some of the advertisements cos

111
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.420
the images were too explicit in the end. Um

112
00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:13.059
Playboy one because they stopped producing such explicit images

113
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.660
as penthouse and Penthouse never really found its feet.

114
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.820
But watching this from the sidelines was a strip

115
00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:25.649
club owner from Ohio called Larry Flint. And he

116
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.369
came in in the seventies with Hustler and he

117
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.179
became the sort of he established the hardcore end

118
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.070
of pornography. So you had Playboy Penthouse and Hustler

119
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.959
and what they did three, these three men is

120
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.869
they socialized and groomed the American public to accept

121
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.540
more pornography as a kind of mainstream image. So

122
00:06:50.549 --> 00:06:52.730
that really went on for many years. Then you

123
00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:57.140
had uh videos um et cetera. But what really

124
00:06:57.149 --> 00:07:01.549
sort of made Playboy, the sex education of the

125
00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:04.730
present day and the wallpaper of young people's lives

126
00:07:04.739 --> 00:07:08.529
was the internet. And when the internet became domesticated

127
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.329
in 2000, it made pornography. What one scholar has

128
00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:15.950
called affordable Anonymous and accessible. You didn't have to

129
00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:18.230
leave the home, you didn't have to go into

130
00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:20.619
these theaters. You didn't have to go to the

131
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.910
local uh porn CD shop. So really what happened

132
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.850
is the internet and it, it, the internet allowed

133
00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:31.859
to build pornography. But I also want to say

134
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:36.130
that the pornography helped construct the internet. Pornography is

135
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.200
always at the head of technology. It's where a

136
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.989
lot of R and D money comes from. And

137
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.730
So a lot of the things like you see,

138
00:07:43.739 --> 00:07:46.799
like pop ups, pop downs paywalls, all of these

139
00:07:46.809 --> 00:07:50.799
things was actually introduced by the porn industry. So

140
00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:54.100
that's what got us to 2000. And what was

141
00:07:54.109 --> 00:07:56.720
interesting is someone who was watching what was going

142
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:01.410
on was, um, I was pretty astounded by the

143
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.059
degree to which the pornography on the internet became

144
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.760
hardcore so quickly. I mean, it literally went from,

145
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.609
you know, semi soft core to semi hardcore to

146
00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:16.100
absolute hardcore, which is in porn land, I call

147
00:08:16.109 --> 00:08:22.019
gonzo. But I wrote porn land in 2008, 2009.

148
00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:24.109
And that's what the industry was calling it. It's

149
00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:28.299
no longer called Gonzo because mainstream porn is hardcore,

150
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.859
it's very, very hard to find anything on the

151
00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:37.260
internet, especially for free. That's not hardcore. So, um

152
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.960
in the beginning between about 4007, anyone with a

153
00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:46.969
camcorder could get a set of porn site going

154
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.049
make money. And then in 2007, a man called

155
00:08:51.059 --> 00:08:54.400
Baby and Simon who was an it specialist came

156
00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:57.909
in and he developed the p the free porn

157
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.979
tube sites and very much like youtube. And that's

158
00:09:01.989 --> 00:09:04.830
what really, that's when Paul really took off, he

159
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.650
didn't need a, a credit card, most of the

160
00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:12.460
stuff was free and it was hardcore. So if

161
00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:15.859
you think about um your average kid or young

162
00:09:15.869 --> 00:09:19.099
male going to pornography, they're gonna go to a

163
00:09:19.109 --> 00:09:23.299
site that's free and accessible. They're not gonna start

164
00:09:23.309 --> 00:09:26.640
hunting through the millions of sites to find soft

165
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:31.739
core. So, again, um, porn hub Fabian Thon, who

166
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.229
was the head of mind geek, that's the company

167
00:09:34.239 --> 00:09:39.130
that he founded. Um, JUST saturated the internet with

168
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.320
hardcore porn. And I mean, I was, I think

169
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.409
all of us who researched pornography from a critical

170
00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:48.859
stance were shocked by the degree to which it

171
00:09:48.869 --> 00:09:51.619
became so hardcore so quickly. And in fact, if

172
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.119
you would have told me what, 30 odd years

173
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.989
ago that you would have hardcore pornography up there

174
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.890
accessible to anybody for free, I would have said

175
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.690
no, that's not gonna happen. You know, the culture's

176
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.190
not gonna sit back. Politicians aren't gonna sit back

177
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.780
and let that happen. But I would have been

178
00:10:07.789 --> 00:10:08.219
wrong.

179
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.489
So please correct me if I'm wrong. But if

180
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.460
I understand it correctly and the way you presented

181
00:10:15.479 --> 00:10:18.659
how pornography changed over the course of the past

182
00:10:18.669 --> 00:10:21.820
few decades, particularly in the US. But now worldwide,

183
00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:25.169
the two main, the two main changes that occur

184
00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:27.989
and probably the ones that worry you the most

185
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.179
have to do with the fact that over time,

186
00:10:31.325 --> 00:10:34.984
at least in your understanding, it became increasingly hard

187
00:10:34.994 --> 00:10:39.265
core and it's also more easily available and even

188
00:10:39.275 --> 00:10:42.744
more so for Children and adolescents

189
00:10:43.025 --> 00:10:46.815
and mainstream, it's now become the wallpaper of their

190
00:10:46.825 --> 00:10:50.184
lives. It's the mainstream. Not only, you know, if

191
00:10:50.195 --> 00:10:52.945
it was hardcore, only a few people watched it

192
00:10:53.434 --> 00:10:57.155
few men because mainly men who were consumers, um,

193
00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:00.090
it would be a problem but not to the

194
00:11:00.099 --> 00:11:03.049
degree that it is that it's so mainstreamed in

195
00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:05.539
our lives that it's a lot of kids actually

196
00:11:05.549 --> 00:11:07.750
see it as just another social media site, not

197
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.679
even pornography.

198
00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:14.549
And what do you mean by phrases, words or

199
00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:20.219
terms? Like women being demeaned and debased in hardcore

200
00:11:20.229 --> 00:11:22.450
pornography? What does that mean? Exactly. And I want

201
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.229
to ask you that because there are people out

202
00:11:25.239 --> 00:11:27.695
there that when they hear this kinds of words,

203
00:11:27.705 --> 00:11:32.625
they might uh reply with, with something like or

204
00:11:32.635 --> 00:11:36.164
something along the lines of, oh you're just moralizing

205
00:11:36.174 --> 00:11:37.075
things.

206
00:11:37.465 --> 00:11:40.715
This is not a moral issue, right? I am

207
00:11:40.724 --> 00:11:45.854
progressive. Um LEFT wing, I mean on the left.

208
00:11:45.864 --> 00:11:47.505
So this is not about a moral issue. This

209
00:11:47.515 --> 00:11:52.679
is about a harms issue. And um the issue

210
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:58.489
really becomes um what happens in a culture where

211
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.630
those images themselves become the blueprint for all other

212
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.130
forms of media. What happens there? So, and if

213
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.099
you look at porn hub, you porn, ex porn,

214
00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:15.869
um you will see that the acts are based

215
00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:20.669
on cruelty and body punishing acts where she's um

216
00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:24.849
can I speak freely about what's in pornography? Um

217
00:12:24.859 --> 00:12:28.619
You see a lot of gagging where the woman

218
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.619
is gagged with a penis so far down her

219
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.650
throat that she can't breathe. And as she's choking,

220
00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:37.960
the male porn performer is actually grabbing her head

221
00:12:37.969 --> 00:12:40.409
and pulling it closer so she chokes even more.

222
00:12:40.419 --> 00:12:43.369
I've seen scenes where she even vomits and they

223
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.130
keep those in uh something that's become very worrisome

224
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.320
and very popular lately. Strangulation. Um And that we're

225
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.330
finding from studies, there was a recent study that's

226
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.770
asked uh incoming young women into college. When was

227
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.030
about their last sexual experience, not their entire sexual

228
00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:05.849
experience. The last and one in three was strangled.

229
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.219
They said now, where does this come from? And

230
00:13:09.229 --> 00:13:12.460
remember this can be fatal because you're cutting off

231
00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:15.619
the air to the brain, which can cause all

232
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.780
sorts of brain damage. Even if you don't kill

233
00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:21.580
it, you can cause a lot of problems. Um

234
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.869
STROKE, um heart attacks, things like this. So you've

235
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.849
got a lot of strangulation. Um A lot of

236
00:13:28.859 --> 00:13:31.719
very hardcore anal sex where the goal is to

237
00:13:31.729 --> 00:13:36.000
make it hurt to make it really be something

238
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.979
that you can't tolerate. And um if you sometimes

239
00:13:39.989 --> 00:13:43.320
go on the poor discussion boards, you'll get questions

240
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:48.299
like um can a thread like can someone point

241
00:13:48.309 --> 00:13:51.520
me to a porn movie where the bitch can

242
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:55.520
no longer stand it and then you'll get hundreds

243
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.599
of responses on these ball on these sites saying

244
00:13:58.609 --> 00:14:01.789
go to this movie at three minutes, 23 seconds

245
00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:05.090
and you see a breakdown. So the more cruel

246
00:14:05.099 --> 00:14:08.599
it is, the more it's drawing on more it

247
00:14:08.609 --> 00:14:12.729
draws consumers. So it's really based on that. Um

248
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.940
There's a lot of spitting in her face, especially

249
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.780
ejaculation. On the face. I mean, anything from 1

250
00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:22.849
to 34 men are ejaculating on her face. And

251
00:14:22.859 --> 00:14:28.510
um in a documentary called um in the documentary,

252
00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.260
they, they actually interviewed a pornographer and he said

253
00:14:32.809 --> 00:14:36.330
they asked him, why do they actually um ejaculate

254
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.979
on a woman's face. And he said it's like

255
00:14:37.989 --> 00:14:42.250
a dog pissing on a lamppost, it's claiming your

256
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.229
own territory. So, I mean, your average porn movie

257
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:53.489
is anything 12345 guys um basically penetrating a woman

258
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.140
orally, anally, vaginally, sometimes two penises in the mouth,

259
00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.780
two in the anus two in the vagina, which

260
00:14:59.789 --> 00:15:01.789
just imagine what that does to the body cos

261
00:15:01.799 --> 00:15:04.849
this is a real human being and she has

262
00:15:04.859 --> 00:15:08.130
bodily limits and what you see is they take

263
00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.590
her to the extreme and it is that extreme

264
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:14.390
that has become mainstream and that is basically what

265
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.130
has made pornography so popular.

266
00:15:16.609 --> 00:15:18.820
So about that, let me just ask you one

267
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.840
thing you mentioned a lot of extreme acts there.

268
00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:25.400
But uh what if at least some of them,

269
00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:27.280
I'm not saying all of them, but if some

270
00:15:27.289 --> 00:15:31.349
of them are done uh consensually because of course,

271
00:15:31.359 --> 00:15:35.789
for most people, there is something that they wouldn't

272
00:15:35.799 --> 00:15:39.450
engage in sexual because they consider it to be

273
00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.440
extreme. But there are uh a tiny number of

274
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.409
people like people, for example, who practice B DS

275
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.989
M that are into those kinds of acts,

276
00:15:49.059 --> 00:15:51.460
which is linked to pornography by the way, you

277
00:15:51.469 --> 00:15:55.229
can't take B DS M away from pornography. Pornography

278
00:15:55.239 --> 00:15:57.580
is also mainstream B DS M, it doesn't mean

279
00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.340
it invented it, but it mainstreamed. Look, the question

280
00:16:01.349 --> 00:16:03.969
is you can never know if it's consensual. That's

281
00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:07.609
the first thing. Um, WE don't know because we

282
00:16:07.619 --> 00:16:10.030
don't know what contracts they sign the women and

283
00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:12.640
we don't know under what conditions, what we do

284
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:18.229
know is pornography is where sexism, racism, capitalism and

285
00:16:18.239 --> 00:16:21.760
colonialism intersect for the women because most of the

286
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.640
women in pornography are poor and desperate. So you

287
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.869
don't get um the average graduate from Harvard or

288
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.090
Yale or Princeton or whatever, lining up to do

289
00:16:32.099 --> 00:16:36.969
pornography. It's mainly poor women from poor countries. So

290
00:16:36.979 --> 00:16:41.650
anything where there's coercion, it can be economic coercion,

291
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.359
it can be coercion through a pimp, it can

292
00:16:44.369 --> 00:16:50.780
be coercion through being um a um refugee from

293
00:16:50.789 --> 00:16:54.489
wars. Um So we don't know and also the

294
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.510
sites don't check the sites, don't check. They say

295
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.869
they look at the um uh contracts but you,

296
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.020
you don't know under what conditions. So my assumption

297
00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:08.050
is that unless that there's so few women who

298
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.829
really consent and when you consent, you have to

299
00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:14.000
have other options in life. Pornography can't be the

300
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.699
only way to put food on the table. So

301
00:17:16.709 --> 00:17:18.469
I would say given what we know about the

302
00:17:18.479 --> 00:17:20.510
women in pornography, they've also, by the way, are

303
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:25.500
disproportionately victims of child sexual abuse prior to being

304
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:30.040
in pornography. When you know those conditions, then you

305
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:35.250
have to say basically that consent is more complicated

306
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:36.099
than what they're saying.

307
00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.589
And aren't there particular cases? I'm not sure what

308
00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:44.369
percentage of cases this would correspond to, but aren't

309
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.979
there cases of child pornography as well or pornography

310
00:17:48.989 --> 00:17:51.770
than with underage people.

311
00:17:52.089 --> 00:17:54.489
Porn hub is full of it. They're being sued

312
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.989
right now. This case is going forward. Um, AND

313
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.859
I mean, and I spend quite a bit of

314
00:18:00.869 --> 00:18:03.729
time on porn hub. So I mean, I've seen

315
00:18:03.739 --> 00:18:08.180
very ill looking girls. I mean, um they barely

316
00:18:08.189 --> 00:18:11.459
look pubescent. So yes, it's sort of full of

317
00:18:11.469 --> 00:18:13.790
those images as well and it's full of trafficked

318
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.260
women as well, women who've been trafficked into the

319
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:22.020
porn industry by the pimps. So, um the industry

320
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:26.589
is built on, as I said, racism, sexism, colonialism

321
00:18:26.599 --> 00:18:29.369
cap, you know, capitalism all and the more you

322
00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.760
fall into those categories, the more likely you are

323
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.750
to be exploited. So any industry that's built on

324
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.780
the, on the economic exploitation is suspect to begin

325
00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.729
with. And that's true of all industries, but especially

326
00:18:42.739 --> 00:18:45.489
the porn industry where the actual acts of violence

327
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.849
against her are so body punishing and cruel and

328
00:18:49.859 --> 00:18:54.349
also cause post traumatic stress disorder. Um ALL sorts

329
00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:59.540
of bodily injuries, um especially uh anal prolapses where

330
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.859
the anuses drop out through hardcore anal sex. Um

331
00:19:04.449 --> 00:19:07.810
CHLAMYDIA of the eye gonorrhea of throat. I mean,

332
00:19:07.819 --> 00:19:09.680
these are the, you don't hear other people apart

333
00:19:09.689 --> 00:19:13.750
from prostituted women having those kinds of, um, on

334
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.880
the job, uh, diseases or, you know, their body

335
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.630
being treated in such a way. I mean, I

336
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.790
remember once, um, when I was having some blood

337
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.170
drawn, it had a big sign up. If you

338
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.130
come into contact with bodily fluids, this was in

339
00:19:31.369 --> 00:19:36.709
a, uh, healthcare facility, call this number immediately. And

340
00:19:36.719 --> 00:19:38.400
as I sat there, I thought, could you imagine

341
00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.780
if the porn industry had to abide by that,

342
00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:42.869
they'd be on the phone all the time? I

343
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.810
mean, think of all the bodily fluids that are

344
00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:51.880
all over the porn, set urine, blood feces, saliva,

345
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:57.219
um ejaculate. I might just think it's what's actually

346
00:19:57.229 --> 00:20:00.069
there and, you know, we're meant to have where's

347
00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:03.920
OSHA, which is the actual in America responsible for

348
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.420
health and safety in the workplace? Nobody seems to

349
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.089
care about pornography. And I would say it's because

350
00:20:10.099 --> 00:20:11.959
it's mainly women who are victims.

351
00:20:12.869 --> 00:20:16.530
But, but when it comes to ST I specifically,

352
00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.979
I hear lots of um more, I hear lots

353
00:20:20.989 --> 00:20:25.890
of times that in nowadays, particularly the big companies,

354
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.359
they require their actors to do blood work every

355
00:20:30.369 --> 00:20:32.569
15 days or something like that.

356
00:20:32.579 --> 00:20:37.510
I got in a lot of it actually. Um

357
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.569
AND I uh and this is straight from the

358
00:20:39.579 --> 00:20:42.890
porn industry, I can't say who it is, but

359
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.810
I was um in conversation with one of the

360
00:20:45.819 --> 00:20:48.939
people who actually do those tests and he said

361
00:20:48.949 --> 00:20:51.819
a lot of them change their tests because they

362
00:20:51.829 --> 00:20:54.839
want to work and they change their test if

363
00:20:54.849 --> 00:20:57.099
they're HIV positive or they've got some sort of

364
00:20:57.109 --> 00:21:03.229
disease. Um, AND again, where, where there's so many,

365
00:21:03.239 --> 00:21:05.760
hundreds of thousands of women in the porn industry

366
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:07.750
and from all over the world, remember we're not

367
00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.109
talking now just about L A and the Valley

368
00:21:10.119 --> 00:21:12.150
we're talking about all over the world. How are

369
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.300
you gonna check all those women? How are you

370
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.560
going to keep, you know, any documentation about that?

371
00:21:18.689 --> 00:21:20.349
So that's a bit, that's a myth.

372
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.439
And, and what do you make of uh porn

373
00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:27.780
that is labeled as feminist? Like, for example, there's

374
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.890
a director slash producer from Sweden called Erika Lust

375
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.089
and she creates porn that she labels as feminist

376
00:21:36.099 --> 00:21:39.709
that is more targeted toward the female audience and

377
00:21:39.719 --> 00:21:43.709
depict sex in more, I don't know, a romantic

378
00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:45.910
and emotionally involved ways.

379
00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:47.900
That's not, I mean, I've seen a lot of

380
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.260
work and um her stuff looks a lot like

381
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:56.030
mainstream hardcore pornography. Well, Erika Lust is, is an

382
00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:00.329
excellent businesswoman. Uh SHE has created as has some

383
00:22:00.339 --> 00:22:03.060
of those other so called feminist pornographers, a great

384
00:22:03.069 --> 00:22:06.849
niche market. And what you find is more woke

385
00:22:06.859 --> 00:22:09.479
men will go there because they don't want to

386
00:22:09.489 --> 00:22:14.020
think they're actually supporting the mainstream porn industry. So,

387
00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:17.229
I mean, and if pornography works by virtue of

388
00:22:17.239 --> 00:22:20.209
de degradation and debasement of women, you know, the

389
00:22:20.219 --> 00:22:23.010
first rule of feminism is do no harm to

390
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.290
women. So I don't see that as feminist pornography,

391
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.920
I see it as a niche market of the

392
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.400
mainstream porn industry.

393
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.119
And of course, in your work, you talk a

394
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:37.180
lot about some of the supposed psychological effects of

395
00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:39.880
porn. So what are the main ones you would

396
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.060
point to? And what is the evidence to support?

397
00:22:43.069 --> 00:22:44.969
Well, it's not just my work. We're talking now

398
00:22:44.979 --> 00:22:48.920
about 30 to 40 years of empirical research by

399
00:22:49.099 --> 00:22:55.630
psychologists, sociologists and multiple disciplines coming together. And what

400
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.000
they found for boys and men is that the

401
00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:03.329
more pornography they watch, the more they have anxiety

402
00:23:03.589 --> 00:23:07.400
depression, the more likely they are to act out

403
00:23:07.699 --> 00:23:10.530
the violence that they see, the more likely their

404
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.579
sexual scripts are going to be formed by pornography,

405
00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.859
the more likely their sexual templates are going to

406
00:23:16.869 --> 00:23:19.829
be formed by pornography. The less likely they are

407
00:23:19.839 --> 00:23:24.619
to have empathy for uh rape victims. Um They

408
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:29.790
often, if they get into habitual use, they withdraw

409
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.219
from life completely and become totally addicted to their

410
00:23:34.229 --> 00:23:37.050
pornography. Now that's a smaller percentage. I want to

411
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.180
be clear, but it is growing where every time

412
00:23:40.189 --> 00:23:42.430
we speak a culturally frame and we go out

413
00:23:42.439 --> 00:23:45.209
and give lectures and talk about it. We hear

414
00:23:45.219 --> 00:23:49.170
from front line medical experts about the degree to

415
00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.910
which pornography is now becoming a problem even with

416
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.410
kids in terms of addiction and it's a substance

417
00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.979
unlike other forms of addictive substances, you can't really

418
00:24:00.989 --> 00:24:04.329
detox from this because the images are in your

419
00:24:04.339 --> 00:24:08.939
head, you formed your sexual template around this, it

420
00:24:08.949 --> 00:24:11.569
what arouses you. And also one of the things

421
00:24:11.579 --> 00:24:14.050
we found is that men who are deep into

422
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.790
pornography actually prefer pornography over actual sex with real

423
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.229
human beings because, you know, pornography is so hardcore

424
00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.599
that so many, so few women will do those

425
00:24:25.609 --> 00:24:30.069
acts that in fact asking a male whose sexual

426
00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:33.199
template or script has been formed by pornography to

427
00:24:33.209 --> 00:24:35.500
go and have actual sex is like asking a

428
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.109
whiskey drinker to go back to beer. It's boring.

429
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.199
They get very desensitized to the violence. So they're

430
00:24:42.209 --> 00:24:45.280
looking for more and more images of violence.

431
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.770
So at a certain point there, you mentioned porn

432
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.829
addiction. So le let me just ask you because

433
00:24:52.839 --> 00:24:55.780
I have on the show, a neuroscientist who does

434
00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:59.650
work on porn, Doctor Nicole Prosi. And uh and

435
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.989
one of the things that we talked about is

436
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.589
exactly porn addiction. And she told me that according

437
00:25:05.599 --> 00:25:08.405
to her study and the studies of other people,

438
00:25:08.535 --> 00:25:11.824
people who tend to report that they suffer from

439
00:25:11.834 --> 00:25:15.714
porn addiction, the most tend to be religious. People

440
00:25:15.724 --> 00:25:19.165
who have been brought up with moral values against

441
00:25:19.175 --> 00:25:22.765
pornography use. What do you make of that?

442
00:25:23.194 --> 00:25:25.915
I'd say that her studies are against the grain

443
00:25:25.925 --> 00:25:29.760
of the weight of the studies about addiction, right?

444
00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.729
I mean, when you're in any science, you don't

445
00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:35.469
go by one study or two studies, you go

446
00:25:35.479 --> 00:25:38.449
by the weight of the evidence and Nicole Price's

447
00:25:38.459 --> 00:25:41.869
work constantly stands outside the weight of the evidence.

448
00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.550
So I don't really carry, I don't feel they

449
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.969
carry much weight given the enormity of the evidence

450
00:25:47.979 --> 00:25:49.650
that doesn't show that to be true, that in

451
00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.510
fact, becoming addicted to porn is much more likely

452
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.810
to be for, um, men who are on the,

453
00:25:58.819 --> 00:26:04.699
um, spectrum for, uh, people who've gone through the

454
00:26:04.709 --> 00:26:08.819
foster care system. People with men with H DH

455
00:26:08.829 --> 00:26:11.530
D A DH D, I mean, there's other factors

456
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:15.390
that make you more susceptible to becoming um an

457
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.680
addict religion has not been found to be one

458
00:26:17.689 --> 00:26:17.969
of them.

459
00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.280
OK. So uh do you also make claims about

460
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:28.880
uh uh relationship between pornography consumption and increase in

461
00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:31.959
sexual aggression or sexual violence?

462
00:26:31.969 --> 00:26:34.560
Well, not, I do, but I draw it from

463
00:26:34.569 --> 00:26:37.939
the research of course, and what we found in

464
00:26:37.949 --> 00:26:42.770
longitudinal studies which remember that's causation and not correlation

465
00:26:43.089 --> 00:26:48.119
is that um boys who excuse me and men

466
00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.650
who watch pornography are more likely to act out

467
00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.540
the violent acts. Yes, that's what the research is

468
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.650
showing. And again, we have an enormous amount of

469
00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.109
research to show this. It's not gay down saying

470
00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:03.810
this, right? It's looking at what the research says,

471
00:27:04.469 --> 00:27:09.060
but about that. Isn't it also true that over

472
00:27:09.069 --> 00:27:12.310
time, I mean, over the course of the decades,

473
00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:15.930
foreign conception has been increasing. But at the same

474
00:27:15.939 --> 00:27:19.770
time, if you look at sexual violence, it has

475
00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.125
been decreasing. And so at least just looking at

476
00:27:23.135 --> 00:27:26.714
those two factors, it seems that there would be

477
00:27:26.724 --> 00:27:31.354
a negative correlation between porn, conception and sexual.

478
00:27:31.395 --> 00:27:34.625
That's a cathartic effect that if you watch poor,

479
00:27:34.635 --> 00:27:36.564
you won't go out and do violence again. There's

480
00:27:36.574 --> 00:27:40.194
no research to show that. In fact, if I

481
00:27:40.204 --> 00:27:43.064
don't, the statistics do not suggest that violence against

482
00:27:43.074 --> 00:27:45.915
women is decreasing. What we do know is less

483
00:27:45.925 --> 00:27:49.260
women are reporting when we speak again, we work

484
00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.560
a lot in the medical world and when you

485
00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:54.010
listen to those who are on the front lines,

486
00:27:54.359 --> 00:27:57.609
most of the women who have been violated, raped,

487
00:27:57.619 --> 00:28:00.709
hurt in some way, do not report it because

488
00:28:00.719 --> 00:28:02.579
they can't go, they feel that they're going to

489
00:28:02.589 --> 00:28:07.650
get, um, degraded yet again through the uh justice

490
00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.290
system. So, um, no, I mean, it again, that

491
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.630
study one in three girls had been strangled in

492
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.550
their last sexual and young women had been strangled

493
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.369
in their last sexual um, experience that wouldn't get

494
00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.939
noted down as violence. So there's all types of

495
00:28:24.949 --> 00:28:28.150
violence now that are not noted down. So, I

496
00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.910
mean, this is what makes really drawing sort of,

497
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.290
um assumptions about this very difficult is that there's

498
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.829
new types of violence which are not being defined

499
00:28:37.839 --> 00:28:40.790
as violence by the women who and girls who

500
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.430
themselves are being groomed by the porn industry to

501
00:28:43.439 --> 00:28:45.060
expect this. Uh

502
00:28:45.849 --> 00:28:48.500
There's also another thing that came to my mind

503
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.310
now a few years ago, I read on the

504
00:28:51.319 --> 00:28:54.349
news that, uh, but I I think it was

505
00:28:54.359 --> 00:28:58.849
in the UK, there was an increase recently of,

506
00:28:58.859 --> 00:29:03.000
uh, women asked to perform anal sex by their

507
00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:07.109
partners. And I think that it was probably influenced

508
00:29:07.119 --> 00:29:10.540
also by pornography in that specific case. Of course,

509
00:29:10.589 --> 00:29:13.505
I'm not saying that that's necessarily a case of

510
00:29:13.515 --> 00:29:17.125
violence, but the case of changing expectations when it

511
00:29:17.135 --> 00:29:18.584
comes to sex.

512
00:29:18.785 --> 00:29:22.125
Exactly. It is changing expectations of what it is

513
00:29:22.135 --> 00:29:26.285
to do. And also, um, we know a lot

514
00:29:26.295 --> 00:29:28.984
of women report men doing anal sex on them

515
00:29:28.994 --> 00:29:34.199
without asking and being hurt by this. Um, AGAIN,

516
00:29:35.189 --> 00:29:38.250
the medical profession talk about a lot of anal

517
00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.199
ruptures, a lot of, um, harm done to women

518
00:29:41.209 --> 00:29:45.250
anally. And you think about it, you know, again,

519
00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.479
porn didn't invent anal sex. What it did is

520
00:29:49.489 --> 00:29:52.800
it may, is it basically normalized it to the

521
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.439
point that many men do expect ailes as do

522
00:29:55.449 --> 00:29:59.030
women because they too, you know, have been influenced

523
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.199
by the porn industry.

524
00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.949
Yes. And in that specific case, the expectations written,

525
00:30:03.959 --> 00:30:08.579
it's not just that men expect, expect anal sex

526
00:30:08.589 --> 00:30:12.569
to be more available, but also women, uh, have

527
00:30:12.579 --> 00:30:16.390
the expectation that they, they have to perform anal

528
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.469
sex to please their partner plus

529
00:30:18.479 --> 00:30:21.680
everything else. You see, and what we found, there's

530
00:30:21.689 --> 00:30:25.380
not many studies done on how women respond to

531
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.420
pornography, but there's a few and what they find

532
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:31.069
is that, um, a lot of women go to

533
00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:34.660
pornography not to masturbate, but to see what men

534
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:37.339
want of them so that they can then perform

535
00:30:37.349 --> 00:30:41.239
that and actually scaring them, it scares them to

536
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:42.959
see those and it would be scary. I mean,

537
00:30:42.969 --> 00:30:44.729
I think for myself when I was younger, if

538
00:30:44.739 --> 00:30:46.939
I would have seen that, I mean, who wants

539
00:30:46.949 --> 00:30:49.170
to have sex after that when you're watching it?

540
00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:53.250
But they, um, do perform this because they think

541
00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.260
it is expected of them and that, this is

542
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.140
what they should be doing.

543
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:01.079
Mhm So let me also ask you because earlier,

544
00:31:01.089 --> 00:31:04.430
you described some of the most extreme acts that

545
00:31:04.439 --> 00:31:05.329
we can see in

546
00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.689
those were mainstream, those were not, I don't go

547
00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:09.380
into extreme areas now.

548
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.699
O OK. OK. Um OK. So the, the extreme

549
00:31:12.709 --> 00:31:15.959
acts that we see in mainstream porn. But what

550
00:31:15.969 --> 00:31:19.160
about the kinds of stories that we usually see

551
00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:22.319
presented in porn movies? Do you think that that's

552
00:31:22.329 --> 00:31:24.319
also important to explore? There's

553
00:31:24.329 --> 00:31:27.780
no, there's very few porn movies that have stories

554
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.199
to them. Most of them are just clips of

555
00:31:30.209 --> 00:31:33.530
sex act after violent sex act after violent sex

556
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.729
act. The days of, you know, the, I don't

557
00:31:36.739 --> 00:31:38.560
know the piece of delivery man coming to the

558
00:31:38.569 --> 00:31:40.540
door and then they end up having sex. Those

559
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:43.920
those belong in the 19 nineties and earlier they

560
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:46.369
know not there. Now most of it does not

561
00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.810
have a storyline. It's just sex scene after sex

562
00:31:49.819 --> 00:31:50.880
scene after sex scene.

563
00:31:51.099 --> 00:31:54.719
And uh I mean, many times when I hear

564
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.390
you and other people who have the same approach

565
00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.449
to pornography. Talk about pornography. You use words like

566
00:32:01.459 --> 00:32:06.339
sexual exploitation. What does exploitation mean in this particular

567
00:32:06.349 --> 00:32:07.099
context?

568
00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:11.319
Well, it means taking a human being to modifying

569
00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:18.640
them, um destroying the fact their humanity, selling them

570
00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:23.619
out, making them disposable, uh putting them through all

571
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:28.550
kinds of violence, both physically and mental and it's

572
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:33.260
the loss of power over that person. That's what

573
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.719
exploitation is, is when that person loses power and

574
00:32:36.729 --> 00:32:42.219
people come in and either exploit them when they've

575
00:32:42.229 --> 00:32:46.739
lost power through poverty or whatever, or groom them

576
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:52.729
into becoming uh se um performers in the sex

577
00:32:52.739 --> 00:32:55.640
industry. And the sex industry is a revolving door.

578
00:32:55.829 --> 00:32:57.459
You know, you go to pornography, you go to

579
00:32:57.469 --> 00:33:00.280
strip clubs, you end up being prostituted, you go

580
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.140
to brothels very much. The same women are going

581
00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:04.420
through this revolving door.

582
00:33:05.459 --> 00:33:08.640
Mhm. And so those are the different kinds of

583
00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:11.099
ways. And I would imagine that you would also

584
00:33:11.109 --> 00:33:14.939
add things like sex trafficking, the different kinds of

585
00:33:14.949 --> 00:33:17.410
ways that women in the porn industry can be

586
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.189
exploited

587
00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:22.270
the whole sex industry, right? And that includes only

588
00:33:22.329 --> 00:33:27.060
fans where women are being sexually exploited in onlyfans.

589
00:33:27.069 --> 00:33:29.540
I mean, often the media talk about, you know,

590
00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.250
this woman became a millionaire through only fans and

591
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.160
you get those stories. Those are very, very rare.

592
00:33:35.459 --> 00:33:38.160
The average woman on onlyfans makes about 100 and

593
00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:41.839
$80 a month, which is not enough to put

594
00:33:41.849 --> 00:33:43.500
food on the table. A lot of them are

595
00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.040
pimped into it again. A lot of them have

596
00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:49.670
the same background as women in um pornography wanting

597
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.349
to make money cos they can't make it in

598
00:33:51.359 --> 00:33:54.550
other ways. So I'm talking about the entire sex

599
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.189
industry is an exploitation of what it means to

600
00:33:58.199 --> 00:34:03.619
be human. And these women are systematically dehumanized in

601
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.989
the sex industry. And in fact, it's not an

602
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.208
accident because the more you dehumanize her, the more

603
00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:12.100
you destroy her sense of self, the more likely

604
00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.958
she is to be a com compliant. And that's

605
00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.739
taken as misunderstood as consent.

606
00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:21.879
It's interesting that you mentioned platforms like only fans

607
00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:24.409
because I was actually going to ask you because

608
00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:27.219
I had this idea that at least in those

609
00:34:27.228 --> 00:34:30.770
sorts of platforms since it is uh I mean,

610
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:34.340
the users, the creators that create their own content

611
00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:36.989
and put it out there that it would be

612
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.438
more independently done. And so some of the issues

613
00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:44.320
that perhaps we see in the p industry, we

614
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:45.350
wouldn't see there.

615
00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.310
Well, first, we don't know how independently done it

616
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.550
is if these are not women who have pimps

617
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.590
who are putting them on onlyfans. And secondly, you

618
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.139
know, Onlyfans takes 20% of the woman's earnings. So

619
00:34:58.149 --> 00:35:00.689
Onlyfans is actually a pimp site. It pimps out

620
00:35:00.699 --> 00:35:05.399
women and this pimp site is very interesting because

621
00:35:05.409 --> 00:35:09.080
so few women make much money, they offer that

622
00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:11.500
if you bring in your friends to only fans,

623
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:15.260
you get a percentage of what she makes. So

624
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.439
you're taking women, you're pimping them out and then

625
00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:20.989
you're asking them to become pimps by bringing in

626
00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:25.479
other women. So it's a real, you know, sort

627
00:35:25.489 --> 00:35:32.669
of, kind of pimp um platform uh that really

628
00:35:32.679 --> 00:35:36.419
is becoming more encased in the porn industry. And

629
00:35:36.429 --> 00:35:38.889
one of the reasons for that is that there's

630
00:35:38.899 --> 00:35:41.239
a lot of money to be made for the

631
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:45.030
platforms and that some of the men are desensitized

632
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.949
to pornography and want what they think is a

633
00:35:46.959 --> 00:35:50.560
girlfriend experience or some kind of interaction with a

634
00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:53.129
real human being. But of course, it's all about

635
00:35:53.139 --> 00:35:56.429
commodification of the human being and of the woman

636
00:35:56.439 --> 00:35:59.350
and commodification of sex.

637
00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.810
And what do you make of uh women? I'm

638
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.560
focusing mostly on women here. We can also talk

639
00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:08.169
about the men of course, but women who work

640
00:36:08.179 --> 00:36:11.675
in the parliament industry and say or claim that

641
00:36:11.905 --> 00:36:14.794
they like it, they want to do it and

642
00:36:14.804 --> 00:36:18.625
even when it comes to the more extreme scenes,

643
00:36:18.635 --> 00:36:21.754
they, they're doing it consensually, what do you make

644
00:36:21.764 --> 00:36:22.235
of that?

645
00:36:22.574 --> 00:36:24.594
Well, first of all, there might be a few

646
00:36:24.604 --> 00:36:28.074
women like that. I wouldn't say no. But remember

647
00:36:28.084 --> 00:36:31.574
these women work in the industry, right? You're not

648
00:36:31.584 --> 00:36:35.764
going to say I'm exploited. I hate it. This

649
00:36:35.774 --> 00:36:37.465
is terrible because you're never going to work in

650
00:36:37.475 --> 00:36:40.709
the industry again. So don't ask a woman who's

651
00:36:40.719 --> 00:36:43.540
in the industry to talk about what's going on

652
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:47.399
it's like asking someone at a, you know, sweatshop

653
00:36:47.719 --> 00:36:49.760
how they feel about their job with their manager

654
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:51.820
standing next to them. You're not gonna get the

655
00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:57.360
truth. And also psychologically, if she's in the industry,

656
00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:03.270
she's really going to have to psychologically believe that

657
00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.570
because otherwise she would absolutely crash and burn. Having

658
00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:11.330
to do the violence done, having to experience that

659
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:16.310
violence on a daily basis is just too much

660
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.189
to admit what's happening to your body. And we

661
00:37:19.199 --> 00:37:20.800
work and have spoken to a lot of women

662
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.189
who've been out of the industry for many years

663
00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:24.959
and they say the same thing when I was

664
00:37:24.969 --> 00:37:26.830
in it, I would have said the same thing.

665
00:37:26.879 --> 00:37:29.570
It's only now I'm out of it and that

666
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.879
I can sort of process what's happened to me

667
00:37:32.219 --> 00:37:34.239
that I now realize what was going on.

668
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:37.000
So do you think that perhaps to a certain

669
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:40.580
extent they would be rationalizing things as a sort

670
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:42.389
of defense mechanism?

671
00:37:42.909 --> 00:37:46.110
Yes. Partly and partly because if you want to

672
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.669
work in the industry, that's the story you have

673
00:37:48.679 --> 00:37:51.600
to give. Mhm. But I mean,

674
00:37:52.729 --> 00:37:54.750
uh no, I was just going to say that

675
00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:59.610
actually some of those cases of people who only

676
00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:04.199
after they abandoned the foreign industry that they come

677
00:38:04.209 --> 00:38:07.879
out and tell about how they were exploited or

678
00:38:07.889 --> 00:38:11.100
are they felt exploited? There are people out there,

679
00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:14.949
like for example, when the Rhodes Mia Khali that

680
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:20.250
now talk about their experiences and get some backlash

681
00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.409
from people that are part of the porn industry.

682
00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.949
A lot of backlash. I mean, even Jenna Jameson's

683
00:38:25.959 --> 00:38:28.030
book, How To Make Love like a porn star,

684
00:38:28.489 --> 00:38:30.330
I mean, which is a best seller. I mean,

685
00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.790
if you read between the lines, she talks about

686
00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:35.830
what really goes on. I mean, you know, she's

687
00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.139
trying to sell porn on one and, and she's

688
00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:39.949
come out and talked about that as, as have

689
00:38:39.959 --> 00:38:44.550
many women afterwards. But um what's interesting is many

690
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:48.649
women in the porn industry. Once they're out, they

691
00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:51.389
don't become public figures. And the reason for that

692
00:38:51.709 --> 00:38:53.330
is first of all, they're scared of the porn

693
00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:55.669
industry and what they'll do to them. And secondly,

694
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:59.830
they feel so exposed because their images are everywhere.

695
00:39:00.229 --> 00:39:01.780
You know, you put an image up on porn

696
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:05.689
hub and it spreads across the porn sites. So

697
00:39:05.699 --> 00:39:08.449
they feel like they've never left the porn industry

698
00:39:08.459 --> 00:39:12.169
because your images are up there and you, where

699
00:39:12.179 --> 00:39:13.260
are you gonna go? How are you gonna get

700
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.469
them taken down? And even if you do try

701
00:39:15.479 --> 00:39:17.040
to get them taken down, they, they pop up

702
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.919
again somewhere else. So you're talking about a very

703
00:39:19.929 --> 00:39:24.040
vulnerable group of women who um you know, are

704
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:26.679
scared that their kids are going to find it,

705
00:39:26.939 --> 00:39:30.199
their kids friends, their next door neighbor, all of

706
00:39:30.209 --> 00:39:30.479
that.

707
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:35.409
Yes. Something that I find really, I mean, unfortunate

708
00:39:35.419 --> 00:39:38.649
to say the least, probably exploitative as well. Uh

709
00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:41.959
And there's been reported by again. L Rhodes, Mia

710
00:39:42.159 --> 00:39:45.129
Kalli and other people like that is that, um,

711
00:39:45.139 --> 00:39:48.820
it seems that the content they produced or contributed

712
00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.889
to is zoned by the foreign companies. And now,

713
00:39:51.899 --> 00:39:55.469
even after they left the industry and they would

714
00:39:55.479 --> 00:39:58.610
like for that content to be wiped off the

715
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.840
internet. Uh, THEY can't,

716
00:40:01.659 --> 00:40:04.239
no, I mean, you, there's, there's ways you can

717
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:07.239
try but, I mean, very few have success, very

718
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:10.699
few and it's almost impossible given the way in

719
00:40:10.709 --> 00:40:12.520
which they go viral and they end up on

720
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:15.239
different. I mean, you know, you often see is

721
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.159
when you sort of look at porn sites, the

722
00:40:17.169 --> 00:40:21.310
same images across porn sites, everyone's pirating from everybody

723
00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:21.949
else.

724
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:27.159
Yeah. And so what would you say are perhaps

725
00:40:27.169 --> 00:40:31.159
some of the best solutions or potential solutions to

726
00:40:31.169 --> 00:40:34.760
deal with these issues surrounding the porn industry?

727
00:40:35.659 --> 00:40:39.879
Well regulation. It's the most, I would say it's

728
00:40:39.889 --> 00:40:47.030
the um largest multibillion dollar a year above ground

729
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.199
industry that is completely deregulated. And so we need

730
00:40:51.209 --> 00:40:54.219
to start thinking about regulation and they need to

731
00:40:54.229 --> 00:40:58.689
follow work practices. I mean that if, if there

732
00:40:58.699 --> 00:41:00.840
was had to follow the same work practices as

733
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:04.300
other companies that would close them down immediately because

734
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:06.739
of all the, again, the bodily fluids, the harms

735
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:10.520
done. Also, we need regulation to stop kids having

736
00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:14.229
access to it and that's called age verification, which

737
00:41:14.239 --> 00:41:16.739
has taken off in many countries and is also

738
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.189
taking off now in the United States where you

739
00:41:19.199 --> 00:41:23.489
have to have a third party verify um that

740
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.229
that person is that anyone who wants to go

741
00:41:25.239 --> 00:41:28.330
on a porn site is 18 or above and

742
00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.020
porn industry is pushing back, of course, because any

743
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:36.149
regulation, you know, like all capitalist capitalist industries, they

744
00:41:36.159 --> 00:41:40.550
fight regulation. No, no industry wants regulation. They fight

745
00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.699
it, tooth and nail. And so the porn industry

746
00:41:42.709 --> 00:41:44.790
has been fighting that and you know, when you

747
00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.139
think they're fighting the fact that what we're saying

748
00:41:47.149 --> 00:41:50.350
is that anyone under 18 shouldn't have access. You

749
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.820
just see how morally bankrupt they've become because before

750
00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:56.330
pornography went on the internet and you had a

751
00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.850
bricks and mortar shop, anyone under 18 wasn't allowed

752
00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.020
in any way, you had to show ID to

753
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:05.340
get there. So all we're saying there is take

754
00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:07.330
it back to how it used to be before

755
00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:10.899
the internet took over the porn industry. Um, I

756
00:42:10.909 --> 00:42:16.050
think class action suits of women who've been harmed

757
00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:19.879
by the porn industry going after the pornographers because

758
00:42:19.889 --> 00:42:22.209
in the United States where you have civil law

759
00:42:22.219 --> 00:42:26.149
dis distant different to criminal law. Um, THAT would

760
00:42:26.159 --> 00:42:28.050
ban if you kept coming at them with the

761
00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:32.020
suits from parents whose kids had been harmed for

762
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:34.580
men who'd been harmed from women who'd been harmed

763
00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:37.344
in it. Both, um, you know, through the sex

764
00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:39.754
industry and what happened to them afterwards, you could

765
00:42:39.764 --> 00:42:42.544
just slowly chip, you chip away quite heavily at

766
00:42:42.554 --> 00:42:45.254
the profits and that's what this is about. The

767
00:42:45.264 --> 00:42:48.004
porn industry is not there to make us have

768
00:42:48.014 --> 00:42:51.225
more liberated sex lives. The porn industry is there

769
00:42:51.395 --> 00:42:54.165
to make us to make money just like the

770
00:42:54.175 --> 00:42:56.304
fast food industry isn't there to make sure we

771
00:42:56.314 --> 00:43:00.364
improve our diet. And really porn is to, um,

772
00:43:00.375 --> 00:43:05.245
pornography is to sex. What mcdonald's is to food.

773
00:43:05.629 --> 00:43:11.409
It's the industrialization commodification of a real human desire

774
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.989
that he's taken away from you and sold back

775
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.719
at you and looks nothing like the original desire.

776
00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.820
Uh Do you agree that uh another thing that

777
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:25.620
socially perhaps we should do is to not stigmatize

778
00:43:25.629 --> 00:43:28.310
the wrong people that is do not stigmatize the

779
00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:33.419
performers themselves because as happens with people that we

780
00:43:33.429 --> 00:43:37.389
mentioned L Rhodes Mili and others, they are the

781
00:43:37.399 --> 00:43:41.864
ones being stigmatized now. And even when they try

782
00:43:41.875 --> 00:43:46.044
to look for other jobs, I mean, sometimes after

783
00:43:46.054 --> 00:43:49.645
they've been in the porn industry, it's almost impossible

784
00:43:49.655 --> 00:43:51.665
for them to have a normal life

785
00:43:51.675 --> 00:43:55.385
afterwards that the women are stigmatized. Why the men

786
00:43:55.395 --> 00:43:57.804
who make the porn and watch the porn are

787
00:43:58.034 --> 00:44:02.370
basically anonymous. We barely know them and they're certainly

788
00:44:02.379 --> 00:44:06.879
not stigmatized. So I would absolutely say it's crucial

789
00:44:06.889 --> 00:44:10.570
that we understand who the victims are here and,

790
00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.770
and these are women, these are a lot of

791
00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.300
them are strong women to withstand what they withstand

792
00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:17.459
in the I think I would not last a

793
00:44:17.469 --> 00:44:20.669
day given what's done to them. So also to

794
00:44:20.679 --> 00:44:23.899
understand that they need to organize now, I don't

795
00:44:23.909 --> 00:44:26.510
use the term sex work because it's not work.

796
00:44:26.989 --> 00:44:29.969
Right? It's sexual exploitation. And I think using the

797
00:44:29.979 --> 00:44:32.469
term sex work is a real disservice to these

798
00:44:32.479 --> 00:44:35.550
women because it denies the reality of their lives

799
00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.580
and what's happening to them. So I would say

800
00:44:38.649 --> 00:44:41.350
100% you do not stigmatize them. And I think

801
00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.899
by using the word sex work, you are stigmatizing

802
00:44:43.909 --> 00:44:46.139
them even more because you are denying their reality.

803
00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:52.179
So, beyond regulation, would you be willing to consider

804
00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.780
abolishing porn or do you not talk about that

805
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:58.479
much because you think it's not realistic?

806
00:44:59.239 --> 00:45:04.010
I don't think the word abolish or censor really

807
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.830
fit in today's corn world about what we can

808
00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:11.189
do about it. I think, as I said, legislation

809
00:45:11.199 --> 00:45:15.540
regulation also what we need, we need really good

810
00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:18.949
sex education in the schools. You know, uh, the

811
00:45:18.959 --> 00:45:23.409
sex education taught in most countries is terrible. It,

812
00:45:23.419 --> 00:45:31.520
they barely um, um, teach about sex and what

813
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:34.770
it's really like in relationships and they certainly don't

814
00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.770
talk about pornography. And I think we need sex

815
00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:43.340
education that builds resilience and resistance to kids and

816
00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.560
they need to be trained teachers. And it's interesting

817
00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:49.050
studies done on kids and they ask about sex

818
00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:52.199
education. They all say it's out of touch with

819
00:45:52.209 --> 00:45:55.439
the reality of their lives. Doesn't mention pornography, doesn't

820
00:45:55.449 --> 00:45:58.639
mention what's happening to them. And a culture refrained.

821
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.800
We have, um, developed over a year using different

822
00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:06.905
consultants as sex curriculum. That is porn. Critical is

823
00:46:06.915 --> 00:46:09.665
free. Anyone can go on there just go to

824
00:46:09.675 --> 00:46:14.084
culture reframed.org, go on to our courses. And you'll

825
00:46:14.094 --> 00:46:17.014
see, we've got courses for parents and we've got

826
00:46:17.024 --> 00:46:20.195
courses for, um, teachers and anyone else who wants

827
00:46:20.205 --> 00:46:24.024
to teach sex education. And it's very robust. It's

828
00:46:24.034 --> 00:46:26.875
been peer reviewed by people in the field and

829
00:46:26.885 --> 00:46:29.145
I think it's the, one of the first ever,

830
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:33.919
um, robust sex education courses that brings in pornography

831
00:46:33.929 --> 00:46:38.090
and it teaches critical literacy. That's what we do

832
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.830
not teach. When you think that most kids spend

833
00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:45.540
their life on the internet, we should have courses

834
00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:48.979
in digital literacy, how to unders and critical digital

835
00:46:48.989 --> 00:46:51.929
literacy, not how to become better consumers, but how

836
00:46:51.939 --> 00:46:55.260
to become more critical consumers of all the media

837
00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:58.510
that you consume. I mean, the schools have dropped

838
00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:01.590
the ball here totally on what it means to,

839
00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.790
for a kid to grow up surrounded by pornography.

840
00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.149
Yes. And the very unfortunate thing here is that

841
00:47:08.159 --> 00:47:13.830
places countries or particular regions where, uh, sex education

842
00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:17.909
is banned or something along those lines. I mean,

843
00:47:17.919 --> 00:47:21.475
the places where Children and adults will get their

844
00:47:21.485 --> 00:47:24.054
sex education from his pornography,

845
00:47:24.544 --> 00:47:26.875
of course, where else? And it makes sense. You

846
00:47:26.885 --> 00:47:30.864
know, they start getting sexually curious when, you know,

847
00:47:31.274 --> 00:47:35.104
um, early adolescence puberty hits. Where are they going

848
00:47:35.114 --> 00:47:38.919
to go when you've got this multibillion dollar industry

849
00:47:38.929 --> 00:47:43.500
up there? So, um, the, the issue is not,

850
00:47:43.669 --> 00:47:47.260
if your child sees pornography, it's Well, and so

851
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:52.360
you have to start early scaffolding education about what

852
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:55.520
critical literacy looks like. And then as they get

853
00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:59.080
older, you bring in pornography to it so you

854
00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:02.110
can do that. It's possible to be done. People

855
00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.179
do it. It's, but it must not be the

856
00:48:04.189 --> 00:48:07.239
only thing what you need is to have come

857
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:12.399
at this in every which way, the regulation, education,

858
00:48:12.409 --> 00:48:16.459
awareness, all of these ways, you know, and to

859
00:48:16.469 --> 00:48:19.790
be honest with you, it, we're so far behind

860
00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.959
the porn industry in doing this, we are so

861
00:48:21.969 --> 00:48:25.159
far behind because you get slapped with labels like

862
00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:32.850
moralistic, religious um right wing. Um So we've got

863
00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.870
to take this out of the realm of moor

864
00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.629
and into the realm of harm. And that's where

865
00:48:38.639 --> 00:48:41.199
we have the research that supports it and that's

866
00:48:41.209 --> 00:48:44.500
where we have the academic approach to it and

867
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:46.330
also the feminist approach, of course.

868
00:48:47.159 --> 00:48:49.459
OK. So let me just ask you one final

869
00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:52.459
question. Do you think that there's something I mean,

870
00:48:52.469 --> 00:48:56.189
apart from political approaches to all of these, that

871
00:48:56.199 --> 00:49:01.199
there's something that individual people, consumers and so on

872
00:49:01.209 --> 00:49:04.600
can do to try to combat some of the

873
00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:07.340
more harmful effects of pornography,

874
00:49:07.479 --> 00:49:12.530
consuming pornography. Stop, that's there's no way to do

875
00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:16.639
this. You know, you cannot consume images of women

876
00:49:17.419 --> 00:49:22.000
being you know, violated in that way and make

877
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:24.739
it easier. It's like asking can you give me

878
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:28.330
some more friendly images for racism that Racists like

879
00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.270
to look at racist images. So is there any

880
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.510
way we can make better racist images? It's ridiculous.

881
00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:36.409
You can't do it. So I would and for

882
00:49:36.419 --> 00:49:38.129
the men as well, I would say for their

883
00:49:38.139 --> 00:49:40.580
own sense of who they are, is this who

884
00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:44.510
they wanna be masturbating? Jerking off to images of

885
00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.959
sexual cruelty of women who've had few choices in

886
00:49:47.969 --> 00:49:49.939
life? Is this who they really want to look

887
00:49:49.949 --> 00:49:51.330
in the mirror and say this is who I

888
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:54.479
am because when I often ask that question, a

889
00:49:54.489 --> 00:50:00.110
lot of them feel disgusted by themselves for using

890
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.000
those images. So no, there's no way that I

891
00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:05.250
can make this easier by saying, go to this

892
00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.239
place or go to that place. You have to

893
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:10.189
stop consuming it and become part of the battle

894
00:50:10.389 --> 00:50:13.189
against the porn industry and the sex industry in

895
00:50:13.199 --> 00:50:17.209
general. That's what we need. You know, basically, it's

896
00:50:17.219 --> 00:50:19.600
left up to a bunch of impoverished feminists to

897
00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:22.780
fight this and increasingly some other, some lawyers and

898
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:25.340
other groups. But you know, men need to join

899
00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:27.260
this as well. This is not doing them any

900
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:31.739
favors, pornography and as they become fathers and have

901
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:33.389
Children, is this what they want their kids to

902
00:50:33.399 --> 00:50:38.120
grow up on? Right. That would be my final

903
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.290
argument is to stop consuming it cause if you

904
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.860
don't consume it, they won't make it.

905
00:50:44.399 --> 00:50:47.169
Uh And when it comes to resources, apart from

906
00:50:47.179 --> 00:50:49.709
your book, which I mentioned in the introduction and

907
00:50:49.719 --> 00:50:53.889
your nonprofit culture reframed. Uh Are there any other

908
00:50:53.899 --> 00:50:57.330
resources online or elsewhere that uh that you would

909
00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:58.129
like to mention?

910
00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:02.389
Um There's not much to be honest with you.

911
00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:07.500
There's organizations in the UK like CS is very

912
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:13.030
good. The Reward Foundation is good. Um Also, um

913
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.290
if you go on our site, we've got lists

914
00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:18.199
of organizations you can go to, we've got resources.

915
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:20.860
We also have an academic library on the culture,

916
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:23.219
we frame site so you can read the studies.

917
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:25.540
Um So I would say go to our website

918
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.260
and you'll see the other resources and if you're

919
00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:30.770
trying to get off pornography and once you stop,

920
00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.510
there's also an organization called No FAP, which is

921
00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.260
a support group for men trying and boys to

922
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:38.739
try and stop pornography. So yes, go on our

923
00:51:38.879 --> 00:51:41.149
website and you'll find resources.

924
00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:45.110
