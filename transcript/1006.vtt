00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.819
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:05.650
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Loops. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:09.189
joined by Doctor Anna Alexandrova. She's a professor in

4
00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.989
Philosophy of Science at the Department of History and

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.039
Philosophy of Science at the University of Cambridge, and

6
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.809
a Fellow of King's College. And today we're focusing

7
00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:23.209
on her edited book Limits of the numerical, the

8
00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:27.690
abuses and the uses of quantification. So, Doctor Alexandrova,

9
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.010
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:32.598
Thank you for having me Ricardo.

11
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.080
So perhaps let's start with a fundamental question here

12
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.979
and also referring to the subtitle of your book.

13
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.189
What is quantification exactly? What are we referring to,

14
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.360
particularly in the philosophy of science? But in science,

15
00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:54.520
more generally, when we use this term,

16
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.750
um it might, it sounds a simpler question than

17
00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:04.379
it actually is um the simplest introduction. The simplest

18
00:01:04.388 --> 00:01:08.760
definition of quantification is just putting numbers on things.

19
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.519
Uh BUT it's very easy to put arbitrary numbers

20
00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:16.610
on things and it wouldn't be any good. So

21
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.330
when uh um we talk about quantification of phenomena

22
00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:25.410
in science. So, for example, you know, figuring out

23
00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:30.069
measures of uh light of distance of time we're

24
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.550
talking about um putting on warranted and justified numbers

25
00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:41.010
that reflect some uh deeper structures such as the

26
00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:43.989
amount of thing or the quantity of things. And

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.910
in order to do that, you need a very

28
00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:50.885
thorough justification of what numbers you're putting in and

29
00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:54.324
whether those numbers are um you know, have uh

30
00:01:54.495 --> 00:02:00.474
you represent uh just levels or quantities or uh

31
00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:05.055
mere uh a possibility of, of comparisons. So in

32
00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:08.133
the book that uh we've edited, we've used um

33
00:02:08.798 --> 00:02:13.809
uh definition of quantification um as follows. Quantification is

34
00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.268
the deployment of numerical representation where these did not

35
00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:21.688
exist before, to describe reality and to affect change.

36
00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.869
And as you see there, uh there's uh several

37
00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:32.339
ingredients uh deployment of numerical representation or could unpack

38
00:02:32.348 --> 00:02:36.229
that. What exactly does that mean where there was

39
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.389
none before? So, so we defined it as a

40
00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:44.089
process of like bringing in numerical representations to features

41
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.630
that were not represented numerically before that we talked

42
00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.970
about, you know, quality of education well being uh

43
00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:58.759
health and these are all very uh controversial things

44
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.160
to quantify and finally to describe reality or to

45
00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.570
affect change. And that would just also reflects the

46
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.199
fact that quantification plays um uh many different roles.

47
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.639
So this is a long answer to a question

48
00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.279
and probably not long enough because the question you've

49
00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:19.360
asked is so difficult

50
00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.830
and when it comes to quantitative data, of course,

51
00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.369
we tend to have uh I guess among the

52
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.539
scientific community. But also in the culture, m more

53
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.809
generally, we tend to have or attribute this sort

54
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.470
of special or to numbers. If there's a number

55
00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:41.289
associated with such something, we uh assume that we

56
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.500
should take it more seriously. Uh At least in

57
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.399
comparison to when we only have qualitative data, for

58
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:57.210
example, but are quantitative data, really precise value free

59
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.179
and objective or at least are they always like

60
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.479
that?

61
00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:09.869
Um uh VERY much not um the um the,

62
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.730
the, the idea that uh uh quantities reflect um

63
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.359
uh a deeper reality than, than qualities is as

64
00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:26.230
long standing as it is controversial. Lots of philosophers

65
00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:29.459
throughout history did not think that our world is

66
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.730
a world of quantities. Uh BUT rather thought that

67
00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:35.079
our world is a world of qualities on which

68
00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:40.279
we impose quantities for a particular purpose. And then

69
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.750
uh when we impose a quantity on something, um

70
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.160
for example, uh well being uh uh how, how

71
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.190
is it possible to talk about uh precision value,

72
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.839
freedom and objectivity? Well, much harder than when you

73
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.679
think about uh numbers like uh you know, number

74
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.149
of deaths from COVID, even number of deaths from

75
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.260
COVID is uh uh it's very hard to achieve

76
00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:14.480
precision value, freedom and objectivity because values hide in

77
00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:18.049
your decision about what counts as a death that

78
00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:21.140
can be attributed to COVID. How much after a

79
00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:23.579
diagnosis do you have to die in order to

80
00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:27.040
count as uh being a death from COVID. Um

81
00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:30.739
So even with cases like this, uh uh there's

82
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.070
a lot of um uh value judgments uh and

83
00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:37.290
background knowledge that has to come and with uh

84
00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:42.600
things like um well being uh health uh quality

85
00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:48.980
of life, um development, uh sustainability and all the

86
00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:52.799
progress, uh it, it becomes all that much harder

87
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.290
which uh which doesn't mean that um you know,

88
00:05:57.299 --> 00:06:00.489
values of precision, value, freedom and objectivity are not

89
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.299
genuine values. I, I share those values sometimes at

90
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:07.779
least, but we need to um bear in mind

91
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.380
that uh uh some quantities that we care about.

92
00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:14.429
Uh THEY, they, they will be valued and that

93
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.940
would be good. Uh And they will, they will,

94
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.859
they will not be objective in the sense of

95
00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:24.260
reflecting some uh um you know, reality that wouldn't

96
00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:27.059
be there if people weren't there also not true,

97
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.179
but that doesn't make them any less good. So

98
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.809
um both precision value, freedom and objectivity. Those are

99
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.260
the things that need to be unpacked. Uh And

100
00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:40.790
uh yeah, made more precise, so to speak in

101
00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:45.500
order to uh uh to, to, to uh realize

102
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.619
the potential of numbers which is very important. And

103
00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:56.119
numbers a enable uh comparison reasoning, allocation, decision making

104
00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:02.140
uh representation uh uh m mu much better um

105
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:08.410
than uh uh qualities alone, right? You, you, you,

106
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.230
if you, especially if those numbers are um well

107
00:07:12.239 --> 00:07:14.920
justified and combined with other information

108
00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:23.660
and are qualitative data necessarily of inferior value scientifically

109
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.149
speaking.

110
00:07:26.359 --> 00:07:32.410
Um So let's, let's think of an example. Um

111
00:07:33.329 --> 00:07:37.029
um You asked me, uh so something that I've

112
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.589
been working a lot, um is uh well being

113
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.140
I've been thinking about that uh for the last

114
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:49.209
uh 15 years or so. Um So say you

115
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:55.880
and I have a conversation um um uh in

116
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.760
uh I don't know, we're, we're good friends and

117
00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.500
I ask you, Ricardo, how are you doing? Uh

118
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.880
AND you give me a lot of information um

119
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:09.790
uh about your life um that concerns your priorities,

120
00:08:09.799 --> 00:08:15.040
how you're handling challenges that you're meeting. Um What

121
00:08:15.049 --> 00:08:18.640
kind of environment you live in? Right. And uh

122
00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:23.019
um what kind of uh pressures do you feel?

123
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.440
And uh what are your dreams and your priorities

124
00:08:27.619 --> 00:08:31.989
and whether you're flourishing and, you know, uh whether

125
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.219
you are sleeping well at night and things like

126
00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:41.330
that. So let's call that altogether, qualitative information about

127
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.159
your well being. Um And let me, uh and

128
00:08:45.169 --> 00:08:49.950
let me ask you now instead, um uh from

129
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.880
uh uh 0 to 10, how satisfied are you

130
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.710
Ricardo with your life as a whole? And uh

131
00:08:56.719 --> 00:08:58.539
do you have a, a number that you would

132
00:08:58.549 --> 00:08:59.710
give me, for example,

133
00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:00.900
um Seven

134
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.169
seven is a favorite. Everybody loves seven and it's

135
00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:08.190
very hard in science to get past that seven,

136
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.520
you know, and that seven doesn't really budge very

137
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.669
much um uh in response to uh you know,

138
00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:18.969
changes in life. But in any case, you've given

139
00:09:18.979 --> 00:09:21.940
me a seven. WHAT is the difference between the

140
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.049
two kinds of information that um that, that, that,

141
00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:29.030
that you've given me the qualitative and the quantitative?

142
00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:32.409
Like, what's your first uh I impression about in

143
00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:35.919
value richness, importance of one or the other?

144
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.820
Well, actually, at least at first sight and in

145
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.719
my own opinion, I would imagine that the first

146
00:09:43.729 --> 00:09:49.940
kind of information, the qualitative information seems more detailed

147
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.955
and richer than just the number a lot because

148
00:09:53.965 --> 00:09:57.594
at least I have more specific information in terms

149
00:09:57.604 --> 00:10:00.604
of the several different factors that play a role

150
00:10:00.614 --> 00:10:05.984
into uh my uh play uh my manifesting uh

151
00:10:05.994 --> 00:10:10.094
general seven as well being. So

152
00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:13.859
that, that's great. That's my impression too. But can

153
00:10:13.869 --> 00:10:17.229
you think of situations in which the latter uh

154
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:23.119
uh information that the number seven is more appropriate

155
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.989
or more sort of apt and is uh you

156
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.039
know, contains more information than, than the, than the

157
00:10:31.049 --> 00:10:32.049
first kind?

158
00:10:33.619 --> 00:10:36.729
Well, I mean, when it comes to well being,

159
00:10:37.299 --> 00:10:40.640
uh I don't know, perhaps I'm missing something here

160
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.409
or forgetting something. But uh a as I said,

161
00:10:44.419 --> 00:10:47.510
with the other kinds of information you have about

162
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.989
me qualitatively speaking, I would still think that perhaps

163
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.789
uh apart from perhaps uh statistically treating the data,

164
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:03.679
the first kind of information would still be more

165
00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:06.690
informative, at least in my opinion. So,

166
00:11:08.539 --> 00:11:11.090
yeah, yeah. So I, I mean, I, I agree

167
00:11:11.099 --> 00:11:14.200
with you. It's very hard not to see the

168
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.159
the, uh, not, not, not to think that the

169
00:11:17.169 --> 00:11:20.369
first kind is, you know, superior and better reflects

170
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.059
well being. But you can also imagine that if

171
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.000
you had a lot and lot of uh answers

172
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.840
to the, uh life satisfaction, quantitative question and if

173
00:11:30.849 --> 00:11:35.429
you had those answers over time, then, uh they,

174
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.390
you would be able to see the patterns, um,

175
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.159
that you wouldn't be able to see in the

176
00:11:40.169 --> 00:11:44.549
first kind. Uh Right. So let's just start with

177
00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:50.000
that initial obvious observation that there's a richness that's

178
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:55.150
reflected in an answer um uh that you give

179
00:11:55.159 --> 00:11:58.869
to a friend how you're really doing. And that

180
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.099
richness is suddenly completely lost when you uh just

181
00:12:03.109 --> 00:12:06.320
put a single number on it. But then suddenly

182
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.250
if those numbers are combined with other numbers, then

183
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.130
then a certain kind of new richness arises that

184
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.109
wasn't there before. Uh RIGHT, the richness of being

185
00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:19.380
able to see change and be able to see

186
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.960
patterns and being able to see differences and inequalities

187
00:12:23.969 --> 00:12:28.590
between people. So I think it is the first

188
00:12:28.599 --> 00:12:32.320
thing is to recognize that uh qualitative and quantitative

189
00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.609
information carries different kind of uh uh value and

190
00:12:36.619 --> 00:12:40.750
different kind of uh priorities and, and different kind

191
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.080
of information. And uh it's, it's obvious that there

192
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.020
isn't a single answer to the question, which information

193
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.320
is better, well, which information is better for what

194
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:55.369
purpose? Right. Uh So yeah, your question was our

195
00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:00.070
qualitative data of inferior value. Uh Well, Yeah. So

196
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.679
obviously not, but neither is it the case that

197
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:09.400
uh uh qualitative data are always of uh superior

198
00:13:09.409 --> 00:13:10.500
value? Right.

199
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.979
Yeah. So uh do you think that it would

200
00:13:13.989 --> 00:13:18.429
be safe to say that when trying to evaluate

201
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:23.270
if in particular cases it is better to have

202
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.770
qualitative or quantitative information that it also at least

203
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:32.429
to some extent depends on the goals we have?

204
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.030
Definitely. So let's use that with uh let's try

205
00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:40.739
and insert some goals in our example. So you've

206
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.880
got uh you've got two kinds of information. Uh

207
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.619
The first one is the one you give to

208
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:51.090
a friend, the rich narrative. Um Suppose your friend,

209
00:13:51.099 --> 00:13:54.119
suppose it is, it is uh the conversation happens

210
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.929
with your life coach or your therapist or your,

211
00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.280
your rabbi or somebody who is a really important

212
00:14:00.289 --> 00:14:02.059
mentor who is trying to help you with uh

213
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:08.919
difficult important decisions. Um They might ask you um

214
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.140
well, tell me how has your life changed as

215
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.869
a result of something? They, they'll still be, they'll

216
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.109
still want to get some kind of quantitative information

217
00:14:18.119 --> 00:14:21.049
if, if they're gonna want to make comparisons, right?

218
00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:24.340
How has your subjective sense of how you are

219
00:14:24.349 --> 00:14:27.650
doing evolved over time? Right. And are you doing

220
00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:32.890
better than before? So they might uh even even

221
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.750
in situations like this, ask for some kind of

222
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.429
uh um uh quantitative information and in the, in

223
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.349
the sense of uh relation between other values, right?

224
00:14:44.359 --> 00:14:47.409
If that's what we mean by a quantity. Um

225
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.260
AND you think that would be really great. Uh

226
00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:53.809
On the other hand, um you could see uh

227
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.520
like, uh you know, a policy maker, um you

228
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.539
who needs to decide how much money to spend

229
00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:03.450
uh to in a community or in a particular

230
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:08.780
initiative. Um What, what information do do they have

231
00:15:08.789 --> 00:15:11.979
to have? Well, again, if uh if all they

232
00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:17.359
have are life satisfaction judgments uh from um you

233
00:15:17.369 --> 00:15:19.669
know, of the kind that you have given me

234
00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:22.570
seven out of 10 and you know, well, but

235
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.840
from a bunch of people over time, you know,

236
00:15:25.849 --> 00:15:29.010
even then you might think that, you know, that

237
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.710
information, that's much better information for them to have

238
00:15:32.719 --> 00:15:36.150
for, for their decision. But again, in order to

239
00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:40.330
decide whether or not to invest in uh say,

240
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.099
you know, a new playground or a new library

241
00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:48.650
or a new piece of infrastructure, um it's not

242
00:15:48.659 --> 00:15:50.799
enough for them to just have those life satisfaction

243
00:15:50.809 --> 00:15:54.349
judgments because life satisfaction judgments cover so much. They

244
00:15:54.359 --> 00:15:57.359
don't really, you know, they're not very detailed there,

245
00:15:57.369 --> 00:16:00.190
they speak umbrella terms that, that, that, that the

246
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.049
black box, a lot of information. Uh So it

247
00:16:04.059 --> 00:16:06.510
would be much better if they were also able

248
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.260
to have some qualitative information about, you know, how

249
00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:13.309
do people feel about uh a particular resource and

250
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.349
how do, what does it mean for them? Right.

251
00:16:16.489 --> 00:16:18.690
So in, in all of, you know, in every

252
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.950
situation uh we encounter the ideal is to have

253
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.979
some kind of a mix between a qualitative and

254
00:16:25.989 --> 00:16:28.750
quantitative, but exactly what kind of mix it is.

255
00:16:29.159 --> 00:16:33.830
And uh you know, where that, that will definitely

256
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.229
depend on the situation. You might think that a

257
00:16:36.239 --> 00:16:41.469
policy maker who merely relies on uh um you

258
00:16:41.479 --> 00:16:46.070
know, the sort of qualitative reports about what people

259
00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.669
told them, them about uh uh a new piece

260
00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:53.190
of infrastructure, they are making decisions on the basis

261
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.229
of anecdotal data, right? They aren't really uh doing

262
00:16:57.239 --> 00:17:01.400
their homework properly. Um Whereas that kind of an

263
00:17:01.539 --> 00:17:07.040
anecdotal uh data is uh is, is, is perfectly

264
00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:10.709
enough if you are trying to help a friend,

265
00:17:10.719 --> 00:17:14.560
make a difficult decision, right? So these are uh

266
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.530
and there is no situation in science that I

267
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.949
think is one or the other most situations in

268
00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:24.890
which we make judgments of uh well being or

269
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.939
health will be a complex mix and the hard

270
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:31.819
thing will be figure around figuring out um the

271
00:17:31.829 --> 00:17:33.079
the appropriate mix.

272
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.969
And so uh since you mentioned political decisions there,

273
00:17:37.979 --> 00:17:41.530
and because as I mentioned a couple of questions

274
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:46.930
ago that there's this sort of uh stereotype surrounding

275
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:52.520
uh strict division between quantitative and qualitative data. And

276
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.859
there's even perhaps, I think we could say two

277
00:17:55.869 --> 00:17:59.849
different cultures surrounding these two different kinds of data.

278
00:18:00.199 --> 00:18:05.775
What are the potential social and political consequences of

279
00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:10.454
having a framework like that where people think that

280
00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:13.675
there's a strict division and they perhaps should take

281
00:18:13.685 --> 00:18:20.535
more seriously where as a quantitative uh aspect to

282
00:18:20.545 --> 00:18:20.844
it,

283
00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:25.150
right, a very important question. So, the idea of

284
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.479
there being two cultures is um um a very

285
00:18:29.489 --> 00:18:34.099
important idea from uh um uh a British thinker,

286
00:18:34.109 --> 00:18:37.939
writer CP Snow. Um That's a culture of a

287
00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:41.329
humanities thinker and a culture of a science thinker

288
00:18:41.339 --> 00:18:46.229
fundamentally at odds. And um uh how, how, how

289
00:18:46.239 --> 00:18:49.209
good it would be uh if they weren't. Uh

290
00:18:49.219 --> 00:18:52.900
So in that sort of meme of two cultures

291
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.380
uh evolves and uh comes with, comes uh in

292
00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:00.270
our age uh in slightly different ways. And if

293
00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.319
you don't mind again, I will use the example

294
00:19:02.329 --> 00:19:05.030
of, of well being to, to, to focus us.

295
00:19:05.449 --> 00:19:09.569
So, uh in some ways, the um well being

296
00:19:09.579 --> 00:19:16.109
research has uh existed um historically, very much in

297
00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:20.800
the humanities culture. Uh uh It's a, it's a

298
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:25.729
purview of um uh writers of literary scholars of

299
00:19:25.739 --> 00:19:33.089
historians of uh psychoanalysts of um um uh religious

300
00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:36.680
thinkers, right? And because it's about who we are

301
00:19:37.959 --> 00:19:41.329
at the same time, there's a long history um

302
00:19:41.339 --> 00:19:44.989
from in economics and psychology, at least from the

303
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.229
age of enlightenment of uh attempts to quantify it

304
00:19:49.239 --> 00:19:53.000
and impose uh uh a quantity of utility, for

305
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:57.109
example, that's supposed to represent uh uh uh welfare.

306
00:19:57.569 --> 00:20:01.969
So by the time that uh comes uh um

307
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.280
uh uh to, to us in about, you know,

308
00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:09.170
about 3020 years ago, there is the story that

309
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.989
you keep hearing uh um well being can replace

310
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.819
uh um uh gross domestic product, for example, or

311
00:20:19.829 --> 00:20:23.819
gross national product is the, the the the the

312
00:20:23.829 --> 00:20:30.170
really important quantity um for, for decision making, if

313
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.890
only we figure out and we, we collect proper

314
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:39.439
uh data about them, right? So um if only

315
00:20:39.449 --> 00:20:43.849
we turn uh well being from one culture to

316
00:20:43.859 --> 00:20:47.569
the other culture. So the sciences of well being

317
00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:51.849
as I know them, uh um the social sciences

318
00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:57.500
are dominated largely by psychologists and economists arises out

319
00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:02.560
of that idea that um um you know, let's

320
00:21:02.569 --> 00:21:06.439
uh let, let's appropriate well being from the uh

321
00:21:06.449 --> 00:21:09.150
from the humanities culture and let's make it an

322
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.939
object of science so that we can um use

323
00:21:13.949 --> 00:21:18.390
this as a much more appropriate and, and the

324
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.630
justification for that is very idealistic, right? The justification

325
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.979
for that is otherwise we're gonna be stuck evaluating

326
00:21:26.989 --> 00:21:32.290
our societies by wrong yardstick of money. Um So

327
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.630
let's evaluate it with better yardstick with things that

328
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.449
people actually care about if we figure out how

329
00:21:38.459 --> 00:21:43.380
to measure them properly. Uh So, ironically, this very

330
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:48.780
idealistic story isn't is actually um yeah, so has

331
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.130
a darker side in my view and that is

332
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:55.630
because in order to quantify it, it, it, it

333
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.109
something like well being, you have to really cut

334
00:21:59.119 --> 00:22:02.650
a lot of corners, uh uh you have to

335
00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.119
simplify what it is, you have to ignore a

336
00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.810
lot of um problems with, um you know, measurement

337
00:22:10.819 --> 00:22:15.099
doesn't actually allow you to, to average over uh

338
00:22:15.109 --> 00:22:19.199
uh data that is uh nearly original. Um I

339
00:22:19.209 --> 00:22:22.439
think we're coming to that shortly in our conversation.

340
00:22:22.849 --> 00:22:25.500
All this is to say that in order to

341
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.790
turn well being into an object of science, you

342
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.599
have to make a lot of compromises. And the

343
00:22:30.609 --> 00:22:35.400
question is whether these compromises um uh are compatible

344
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:39.310
with that idealistic vision, that's uh that people who

345
00:22:39.319 --> 00:22:43.489
propose uh uh quantity of well being is I

346
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:47.060
don't think it is because if, if you, if

347
00:22:47.069 --> 00:22:50.469
you leave everything else, like as is that means

348
00:22:50.479 --> 00:22:52.819
if you don't change the idea that in order

349
00:22:52.829 --> 00:22:55.750
to make good decisions, you need to justify them

350
00:22:55.910 --> 00:23:00.439
by quantitative measures, then uh turning well being into

351
00:23:00.449 --> 00:23:04.319
quantitative measure isn't progress because you also have to

352
00:23:04.619 --> 00:23:08.579
uh change that perception, you have that the only

353
00:23:08.589 --> 00:23:13.560
evidence based decision is a decision that's justifiable by

354
00:23:13.569 --> 00:23:14.119
numbers.

355
00:23:15.489 --> 00:23:21.040
And so focusing on quantification, are there different types

356
00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:21.569
of it?

357
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.920
Yeah. Um WE probably should have brought that in

358
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:32.010
already. So uh let's just make uh one very

359
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:38.839
familiar um distinction between ordinal and uh interval data.

360
00:23:38.849 --> 00:23:42.329
So, or uh data are data that allow you

361
00:23:42.339 --> 00:23:48.619
to just compare, um say that 11 state is

362
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:52.160
uh uh greater better or has more of it

363
00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:57.550
than another. So if you say um I'm satisfied

364
00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.900
with my life uh as a whole, it you

365
00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:05.810
at uh uh seven me actually at eight and

366
00:24:05.829 --> 00:24:08.739
then all we could infer from ordinal data is

367
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.949
that I'm better off than you. Um Assuming that,

368
00:24:11.959 --> 00:24:13.989
you know, you and I are using the scale

369
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.579
uh in the same way. However, if uh we

370
00:24:18.589 --> 00:24:21.810
thought that we had interval data, that means if

371
00:24:21.819 --> 00:24:25.130
we had uh quantities that in uh that give

372
00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.140
us not just order, but also the distance between

373
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.479
them, then we'd be able to say that, you

374
00:24:31.489 --> 00:24:34.260
know, I am happier. I have a better higher

375
00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:38.619
well being than you buy that much. And uh

376
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:43.420
so, so, and then you could, you could uh

377
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:48.400
make that complicate, further complicate, complicate this further by

378
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:50.199
asking, you know, is there such thing as a

379
00:24:50.209 --> 00:24:54.969
zero point um where you are, you know, neither

380
00:24:54.979 --> 00:24:58.569
uh badly off nor well off. Uh And you

381
00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:03.709
would call that ratio data. Uh So, um there

382
00:25:03.719 --> 00:25:07.199
are very many different types of quantification and because

383
00:25:07.209 --> 00:25:10.500
it's not written in the sky, what quantity is

384
00:25:10.839 --> 00:25:14.619
in some ways people invent uh uh what counts

385
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:21.579
as a numerical representation. Um And uh sometimes those

386
00:25:21.589 --> 00:25:27.160
mix the, the, the different numerical representations mix. So

387
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:32.640
people use merely or replies and then average them

388
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:38.000
in statistics. Um uh uh THEREFORE trying to derive

389
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:42.160
interval answers from ordinal data. And some people say

390
00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.520
you can't do that. Some people say actually you

391
00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:48.170
can um uh uh but all this is to

392
00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.800
say that um you know, just uh when, when

393
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:55.369
people just tell you that I've got quantitative data,

394
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.150
you can still ask a lot of questions about

395
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.390
what kind of data you have and whether um

396
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.729
you know, yeah, it's very easy to put numbers

397
00:26:03.739 --> 00:26:08.790
on something but uh doing it well uh is,

398
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.989
is a, is a, is a whole other um

399
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.410
complications. So, yeah, I don't think there is uh

400
00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:19.510
right now any kind of um uh interval uh

401
00:26:19.599 --> 00:26:23.630
data about well-being. Um That is that is possible

402
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:28.670
to have, I think ordinal quantification about well-being is

403
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:33.099
conceivable, but that's different for other uh objects, right?

404
00:26:33.109 --> 00:26:37.780
So uh you know, interval data about uh length

405
00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:42.479
is fine, interval, data about time is fine. Um

406
00:26:42.579 --> 00:26:46.420
uh HEALTH is more complicated. Um So the story

407
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:49.459
of quantification is the story of trying to figure

408
00:26:49.469 --> 00:26:53.180
out what exactly are the rules for quantities in

409
00:26:53.189 --> 00:26:58.520
different spheres, right? And the, the big philosophical story

410
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.219
there is, you know, we, we want to try

411
00:27:01.229 --> 00:27:04.640
and figure out context free rules for how to

412
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:08.209
quantify things. But that's not really possible because how

413
00:27:08.219 --> 00:27:10.869
to quantify something has to depend on that thing

414
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.680
that you're quantifying and knowledge about that thing is

415
00:27:14.689 --> 00:27:16.849
necessary for you to even begin to have a

416
00:27:16.859 --> 00:27:21.040
conversation about what um yeah, what a quantity is.

417
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.969
So these next two questions, I think that in

418
00:27:24.979 --> 00:27:29.300
a sense we've already been talking about them. Uh

419
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:33.579
But what would you say are the limits of

420
00:27:33.589 --> 00:27:34.660
quantification?

421
00:27:36.199 --> 00:27:42.459
Um uh LIMITS of quantification is uh OK. First,

422
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:49.060
by what kind of quantification. Um uh MINIMALLY quantification

423
00:27:49.069 --> 00:27:54.290
requires uh, setting in um, a level of something,

424
00:27:54.689 --> 00:27:57.969
um, relative to another level and another level and

425
00:27:57.979 --> 00:28:00.739
another level in such a way as you'd be

426
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.839
able to compare different levels, right? And you have

427
00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:08.469
to be able to compare it across, uh, uh

428
00:28:08.489 --> 00:28:13.540
people who you're quantifying or states that you're quantifying

429
00:28:14.099 --> 00:28:18.290
and you across context as well. So, um, you

430
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.869
have to, if you know, if you've taken a

431
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:24.910
questionnaire in uh in uh Porto and I've taken

432
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.310
a questionnaire in Cambridge, England. Uh We need to

433
00:28:28.319 --> 00:28:31.310
be able to say that it means uh it

434
00:28:31.319 --> 00:28:34.880
is comparable. We can, we can derive things from

435
00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:38.510
it or, you know, people who study uh economic

436
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.410
inequality and they've got data about um you know,

437
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.400
the, the um how unequal is distribution of resources

438
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.810
in Porto versus in, in, in Cambridge. Again, we're

439
00:28:49.819 --> 00:28:53.969
gonna have to uh be sure that tho those

440
00:28:53.979 --> 00:28:57.849
things we've got are comparable, right? And if for

441
00:28:57.859 --> 00:29:01.000
them to be comparable, we need, we need to

442
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:04.520
know that certain things remain uh the same, you

443
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.069
know, that that certain level of wealth means the

444
00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:10.689
same in Cambridge as it means in, in, in

445
00:29:10.699 --> 00:29:15.694
Porto, et cetera. So the biggest limit to quantification

446
00:29:15.704 --> 00:29:20.145
is uh uh uh the fact that it is

447
00:29:20.155 --> 00:29:26.045
difficult to justify such comparisons. We want these comparisons.

448
00:29:26.324 --> 00:29:29.045
It is uh you know, we all are very

449
00:29:29.055 --> 00:29:37.089
happily con con consume. Uh A about um uh

450
00:29:37.579 --> 00:29:40.859
yeah, how much more unequal is a uh is

451
00:29:40.869 --> 00:29:44.540
certain country than another, how much more happy is

452
00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:48.260
a certain country than another, how much more developed

453
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:51.310
is a certain country than another. But in order

454
00:29:51.319 --> 00:29:55.339
to make these justifications, uh the, the, these kind

455
00:29:55.349 --> 00:30:00.339
of quantifications, you have to uh be sure that

456
00:30:00.349 --> 00:30:03.060
uh that, that you are not comparing apples with

457
00:30:03.069 --> 00:30:06.300
oranges, that you are turning things into all apples

458
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:10.319
or all oranges. So, um what is the, what's

459
00:30:10.329 --> 00:30:13.619
the, what's the limit? It's the fact that people

460
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:19.989
forget how much uh controversial uh assumption goes into

461
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.750
a single uh uh even even what looks like

462
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.510
a simple ordinal uh quantification.

463
00:30:27.329 --> 00:30:31.630
Mhm And what would you say are then the

464
00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:36.989
biggest strengths or the strongest arguments in favor of

465
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:37.949
quantification?

466
00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.719
Yeah, great. Let's go back to our um our

467
00:30:44.729 --> 00:30:48.560
example of two kinds of information you could give

468
00:30:48.829 --> 00:30:52.869
about uh uh well being of someone. So we've

469
00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:59.310
already discussed how it's true that information about your

470
00:30:59.319 --> 00:31:03.170
life, deep information about your life carries carries a

471
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:08.770
lot of uh really relevant content whereas a single

472
00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:12.380
number doesn't. But when a single number is combined

473
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:15.790
with a lot of other numbers, it might carry

474
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.760
a lot of uh you know, I information that

475
00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:22.849
wasn't there before. So in economics, for example, strongest

476
00:31:22.859 --> 00:31:29.359
arguments, uh um strongest things that quantification has uh

477
00:31:29.369 --> 00:31:33.880
uh enabled. He is um uh yeah, being able

478
00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:39.760
to uh make very transparent, very clear and very

479
00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:47.239
digestible arguments about uh say superiority of one policy

480
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:51.780
over another. Um uh When uh uh there is

481
00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.640
a really important book called Trust In Numbers by

482
00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:58.650
Ted Porter. Um And that uh tells the story

483
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.619
of how cost benefit analysis came to be, which

484
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:05.160
is one of the uh great examples of triumph

485
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:08.079
of quantification in the social sphere. There is no

486
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:14.300
uh there's no big, well, hardly any big decisions

487
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:18.199
uh made without cost benefit analysis in today's democracy.

488
00:32:18.209 --> 00:32:22.420
Well, Brexit was uh uh but that's uh uh

489
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:26.900
but that's another story. Um But why is uh

490
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:31.079
cost benefit analysis? Uh A nice thing to, to,

491
00:32:31.089 --> 00:32:34.020
to do and to have, well, it's because if

492
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.599
you are um if you, if you have rules

493
00:32:37.609 --> 00:32:40.920
about how you quantify all the benefits and all

494
00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:44.719
the costs and then lay them out that enables

495
00:32:44.729 --> 00:32:47.699
other people to check that you have done a

496
00:32:47.709 --> 00:32:54.239
good job. It, it creates a very transparent system

497
00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:59.880
that can uh provide accountability for decisions and it

498
00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:05.000
enables democracy, it enables participation and it enables oversight.

499
00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:10.150
So um sure it will introduce a lot of

500
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.790
simplification because how could you possibly quantify something um

501
00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.280
as big and philosophical as a cost and the

502
00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:23.089
benefit. But if you, if you do it thoroughly

503
00:33:23.369 --> 00:33:28.449
with uh systematic procedures and treat all cases alike

504
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:31.729
and uh um uh put in the work, then

505
00:33:31.739 --> 00:33:34.050
other people will be able to check your work,

506
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:38.199
right? And then we have something to talk about.

507
00:33:38.469 --> 00:33:40.250
Uh ABOUT whether or not you've made a good

508
00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.979
decision, whether you, whether the evidence justifies investment in

509
00:33:43.989 --> 00:33:47.900
a particular piece of infrastructure. So that kind of

510
00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:54.959
enabling of accountability, oversight and then representation as well.

511
00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:58.199
You know, the there is no way if you,

512
00:33:58.209 --> 00:34:02.560
if you really want to expose a certain injustice,

513
00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:06.640
there's nothing like showing the numbers behind it. There's

514
00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:11.610
nothing like showing um uh for example, level of

515
00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:17.179
um uh sexual violence or levels of uh um

516
00:34:17.478 --> 00:34:21.659
um a certain kind of uh uh I don't

517
00:34:21.668 --> 00:34:24.399
know, economic injustice. If you, if you put the

518
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:26.909
numbers in, in front of people, look how ter

519
00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.070
how look how unequal outcomes are for different groups

520
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.219
of people um for, for, for, in a particular

521
00:34:34.228 --> 00:34:39.989
context. Um Numbers are amazing at that. Uh So

522
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.600
and ignoring numbers is uh a very, very big

523
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:47.830
mistake and trying to, to, to, to get away

524
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.590
from them is a, is a very big mistake.

525
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.260
So numbers have uh a power, a power that

526
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:56.370
can be abused. Well, that's the case with everything,

527
00:34:56.379 --> 00:34:59.020
right? Uh So, and which is why I think

528
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.600
it is uh uh a really big mistake to

529
00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.219
sort of um uh speak in a blanket ways

530
00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:11.600
about uh uh Yeah. Good quantification, good or quantification

531
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.020
bad. Mhm

532
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:18.899
So earlier, we've talked about CPS, no idea of

533
00:35:18.909 --> 00:35:23.320
the two cultures in science. And uh the, the,

534
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:26.469
the way that we tend to think about quantitative

535
00:35:26.479 --> 00:35:32.020
and qualitative data as strictly separate but ha have

536
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:37.530
you seen that uh society's relationship to numerical data

537
00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:41.469
has changed over time? And if so, in what

538
00:35:41.479 --> 00:35:42.229
direction

539
00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.530
on the one hand, um we live in a,

540
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:51.959
a more quantified world than ever. Um Many of

541
00:35:51.969 --> 00:35:56.209
us were um uh trackers uh that uh you

542
00:35:56.219 --> 00:35:58.290
know, tell us how many steps we take a

543
00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.169
day and how mu how many hours of sleep

544
00:36:02.179 --> 00:36:06.090
we get, we get um we are more surveyed

545
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:10.649
than ever before. Um uh You know, every time

546
00:36:10.659 --> 00:36:15.409
you uh post a video on youtube, you will

547
00:36:15.419 --> 00:36:20.040
know how many views it got and your impact

548
00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:23.379
and your growth will be often evaluated on the

549
00:36:23.389 --> 00:36:27.360
basis of these numbers. So, on the one hand,

550
00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:31.360
uh um uh we've uh you, you could think

551
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:34.520
that of modern history is a triumph of quantification

552
00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:40.429
at the same time. Uh uh uh uh CON

553
00:36:40.629 --> 00:36:45.100
construction of numbers uh um requires a great deal

554
00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:49.520
of expertise and some uh uh of these numbers

555
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:54.379
will be greatly uh questioned more than others. So,

556
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.659
uh what is known and what, what, what I

557
00:36:57.669 --> 00:36:59.840
think is familiar to many of us as a

558
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:03.179
crisis of expertise or a rise of uh a

559
00:37:03.189 --> 00:37:08.810
special rejection of expertise. Um WHETHER it is about

560
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:14.800
uh pandemic policy or economic policy or, or anything

561
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:18.719
else or, you know, rejection, for example of um

562
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:23.760
uh cer certain uh kind of medical advice uh

563
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:30.149
right, all of that um uh is often comes

564
00:37:30.159 --> 00:37:32.560
out out of skepticism for the numbers that are

565
00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:36.520
being, uh, that are being put forward. So, you

566
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.989
know, you can quantify, uh, uh, a lot of

567
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.500
things, um, astrologically you could measure people's heads. Uh,

568
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:51.129
YOU could measure the number of words they use

569
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:54.120
or, you know, or the, whatever the number of

570
00:37:54.129 --> 00:37:57.219
brain cells, uh, they have, you could have them

571
00:37:57.229 --> 00:38:03.959
have, uh, do, do questionnaires about, uh, IQ and

572
00:38:03.969 --> 00:38:07.750
you could be fantastically skeptical about those numbers, meaning

573
00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.260
anything at all, right? And you could have all

574
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.790
sorts of reasons to ignore them. So which is

575
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.310
why it is that the story of quantification is

576
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.899
not a story necessarily of triumph.

577
00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:26.169
Mhm So before we move beyond our discussion about

578
00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:30.020
quantification, I have uh one more question about it.

579
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:33.699
So uh do you think that it would be

580
00:38:33.709 --> 00:38:41.209
ethical for, for example, politicians, political institutions to manipulate

581
00:38:41.219 --> 00:38:46.870
the public with numbers if that has some sort

582
00:38:46.879 --> 00:38:49.699
of good social effects?

583
00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.189
Well, it's easy to say uh no, it wouldn't

584
00:38:53.199 --> 00:38:57.679
be right because mani manipulation is always wrong, but

585
00:38:57.689 --> 00:39:01.050
you look uh uh closely to it and it

586
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:07.090
begins to look more complicated. So, um if you

587
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.209
know, for example, you know, if you as a

588
00:39:09.219 --> 00:39:15.350
doctor presenting a patient with certain options, um and

589
00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.699
the patient has a lot less information and a

590
00:39:17.709 --> 00:39:22.850
lot less expertise than you do about it. And

591
00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:26.780
uh you have an idea about uh uh what

592
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:32.479
is better for that uh patient, right? Um uh

593
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:35.000
YOU know, what, what is, what will save their

594
00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:39.699
life. Uh For example, you may, well, you, you

595
00:39:39.709 --> 00:39:43.500
wouldn't be mani, would it be manipulating to present

596
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:46.080
uh those data that make it more likely for

597
00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:49.800
the patient to agree to a procedure? Uh I

598
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:55.929
mean, yes and no. Right. Yeah. Um So exactly.

599
00:39:55.939 --> 00:40:00.479
Uh OR for example, as the government that uh

600
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:05.090
um uh you know, has certain data about uh

601
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:09.530
um uh the, the, the effect of smoking on.

602
00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:13.949
Yeah, health and cancer. Um uh Well, are they

603
00:40:13.959 --> 00:40:17.939
manipulating these data if they, if they present them

604
00:40:17.949 --> 00:40:20.409
in such a way as makes it more likely

605
00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:28.510
that people stop smoking? Um uh I think uh

606
00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:34.070
in general, um oh yeah, of course, we've, you

607
00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.800
know, we know how we know how mu how,

608
00:40:37.909 --> 00:40:41.020
how much uh abuse can happen with a certain

609
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:45.760
deployment of statistics, um certain deployment of numbers, but

610
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:49.300
then abuse can happen with deployment of narratives as

611
00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:53.570
well. Uh It's actually, yeah, very easy to uh

612
00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.159
you know, tell a story and, and capture imagination

613
00:40:57.169 --> 00:41:01.040
and uh and destroy uh uh a wealth of

614
00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:05.860
expert knowledge um uh just with a single story.

615
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.889
So um uh I think manipulation, all this is

616
00:41:10.899 --> 00:41:14.120
to say that manipulation will happen either way. Uh

617
00:41:14.129 --> 00:41:18.250
And I don't think uh the manipulation of numerical

618
00:41:18.649 --> 00:41:22.139
is uh any less problematic or any more problematic

619
00:41:22.149 --> 00:41:26.610
than the manipulation of the qualitative. And the only

620
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.080
thing we can do to resist that is to

621
00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:34.080
have uh um yes, to have uh to, to

622
00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:37.790
support people in our democracies who, whose job it

623
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.000
is when they look, when they see something that's

624
00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:48.169
wrong and that's false. Who say so? Right. And

625
00:41:48.179 --> 00:41:52.590
who say so without fear of being attacked? Um,

626
00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.800
SO a class of uh experts that are able

627
00:41:55.810 --> 00:42:00.000
to uh see uh b yes, so to speak.

628
00:42:00.209 --> 00:42:04.479
Um, AND know that it is there and be,

629
00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:07.320
be able to speak up. They are completely essential

630
00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:10.399
to our democracies and our welfare.

631
00:42:11.149 --> 00:42:14.899
Mhm So another topic that I would like to

632
00:42:14.909 --> 00:42:19.840
ask you about today is uh a thick concept.

633
00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:23.090
So what are a thick concepts exactly?

634
00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.439
Uh Thank you for asking a thick concept is

635
00:42:28.239 --> 00:42:34.419
a notion that philosophers have known about um um

636
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:39.100
since mid 20th century, philosophers like Bernard Williams and

637
00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:44.310
Elizabeth Anderson and uh uh uh Hillary Putnam have

638
00:42:44.379 --> 00:42:48.810
uh written on it extensively. Uh Thick concepts are

639
00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:54.620
interesting because they both uh describe and they evaluate.

640
00:42:54.899 --> 00:42:59.399
So for example, a concept like uh uh shame

641
00:42:59.409 --> 00:43:03.060
or courage, it tells you what a person is

642
00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:06.780
like as well as saying that it is a

643
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:10.739
virtuous person and, or, or a, or a vicious

644
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:14.010
one in, in a particular way. And uh the

645
00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.669
reason why they are really tricky and interesting from

646
00:43:16.679 --> 00:43:19.709
philosophical point of view is that sometimes the descriptive

647
00:43:19.719 --> 00:43:23.709
and the evaluative cannot be uh uh separated and

648
00:43:23.719 --> 00:43:26.479
they are entangled in a way. So philosophers of

649
00:43:26.489 --> 00:43:31.810
language Um uh And ethicists often pore over the

650
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:36.580
significance of this uh uh concepts that are, you

651
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:40.300
know, both describe and evaluate and apparently can in

652
00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:43.699
a way that cannot be separated. I however, am

653
00:43:43.709 --> 00:43:46.850
interested in the concept as a philosopher of science

654
00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:50.459
because I think a lot of objects of science

655
00:43:50.469 --> 00:43:55.129
um in the social and biomedical sciences are thick

656
00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:03.810
and they are uh um health um um security,

657
00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:11.739
sustainability, uh well being quality of life, frailty um

658
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:15.419
resilience uh and so on. I can, I can

659
00:44:15.429 --> 00:44:22.010
go on. Um So modern science studies thick concepts

660
00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.020
because otherwise it wouldn't be studying, if it didn't

661
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:28.540
study the concepts, it wouldn't be studying things that

662
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:32.959
are of interest to uh communities that enable them.

663
00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.290
It's a, it's a responsibility of sciences to study

664
00:44:38.729 --> 00:44:43.500
phenomena denoted by thick concepts. And yet they raise

665
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:47.439
a genuine challenge to science because they require making

666
00:44:47.449 --> 00:44:53.669
value judgments and scientists um aren't particularly trained to

667
00:44:53.679 --> 00:44:57.489
make good value judgments and are, aren't particularly trained

668
00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:03.379
to oversee each other's value judgments. Peer review isn't

669
00:45:03.389 --> 00:45:06.179
particularly good at handling, you know, have you made

670
00:45:06.189 --> 00:45:09.780
your thick concepts? Well, and apt so as a

671
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:13.860
result, um when scientists study thick concepts, they're very,

672
00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:16.679
they're often tempted turning them to turn them into

673
00:45:16.689 --> 00:45:20.030
thin thin concepts that are just technical terms. Well,

674
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.300
I don't care what well being is, I'll just

675
00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:25.379
say life satisfaction rating, that's what well being is.

676
00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.239
So that's called operational. And you know, when you,

677
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:31.679
when you say that, you know, the thing that

678
00:45:31.689 --> 00:45:34.879
I study is, is what I can measure and

679
00:45:34.889 --> 00:45:37.020
I'm not interested in what that thing really is.

680
00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:41.560
Um, OR, you know, or, or they, or they

681
00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:45.649
say that, you know, well, uh, you know, I

682
00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:48.510
know what well being is and I know well

683
00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.629
being is amount of pleasure. So I'm just gonna

684
00:45:50.639 --> 00:45:52.879
go ahead and measure the amount of pleasure and

685
00:45:52.889 --> 00:45:56.270
call that well being in both of those cases,

686
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.270
whether you're turning something into a technical term or

687
00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.510
with the way you, you were deciding to make

688
00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.100
the uh well being judgment, the value judgment yourself.

689
00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:10.270
Um You're not doing very good responsible science because

690
00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.290
um about exactly what is responsible science when it

691
00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:17.280
comes to fake concepts uh isn't clear. Uh So

692
00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:19.560
that's what, that's something I've been talking. I've been

693
00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:23.050
writing about with my uh uh co-author uh like

694
00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:27.330
Mark Fabian Diane Coyle, Alexandra Basso is, how would

695
00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:32.080
you um responsibly treat uh things like thick concepts

696
00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:34.699
and whether do they need special rules uh in

697
00:46:34.709 --> 00:46:38.929
scientific method? Um I, I think that's an open

698
00:46:38.939 --> 00:46:41.229
question. I don't have all the answers, but it's

699
00:46:41.239 --> 00:46:43.709
a really urgent question that I think philosophers need

700
00:46:43.719 --> 00:46:46.879
to be uh talking about and scientists too. That's

701
00:46:46.889 --> 00:46:47.580
the hope

702
00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.459
it's an open question. And in your work linking

703
00:46:52.469 --> 00:46:56.379
this to another idea you talk about, for example,

704
00:46:56.389 --> 00:47:01.979
the democratization of measurement. And uh you suggest that

705
00:47:01.989 --> 00:47:05.780
perhaps a way of dealing with issues as you

706
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:09.955
mentioned there, as you described there surrounding thick concepts

707
00:47:09.965 --> 00:47:15.685
would be actually this to democratize measurement. So what

708
00:47:15.695 --> 00:47:20.435
is uh the democratization of measurement exactly? And what

709
00:47:20.445 --> 00:47:23.715
would it entail for science?

710
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:29.149
Suppose you agreed that thick concepts are important to,

711
00:47:29.159 --> 00:47:33.699
to study and thick concepts are inimitable. That means

712
00:47:33.709 --> 00:47:38.239
you agree that scientists need to make value judgments

713
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:42.800
in order to um proceed even with such basic

714
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:48.899
activities as measurement. Um AND then who's gonna be

715
00:47:48.909 --> 00:47:52.810
making those value judgments? So for example, suppose you're

716
00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:58.189
tasked with measuring well being as a um as

717
00:47:58.199 --> 00:48:01.639
a psychologist, is it OK for you to just

718
00:48:01.649 --> 00:48:05.699
say, well, well-being is how people feel. Therefore, I'm

719
00:48:05.709 --> 00:48:10.139
going to measure how people feel. Oh really? Well,

720
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.959
are you sure? Well being is how people feel,

721
00:48:12.969 --> 00:48:17.080
how people feel about what exactly uh you, if

722
00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:19.820
you, if you're doing this all by yourself, you

723
00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.550
or if you're doing it by relying on uh

724
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.250
I don't know what your predecessors have done you

725
00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:29.219
in some ways, monopolizing judgments about well being in

726
00:48:29.229 --> 00:48:31.979
a way that is wrong because you're not actually

727
00:48:31.989 --> 00:48:37.300
qualified to do that. Um If you took seriously

728
00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:42.590
the duty of uh a studying phenomena denoted by

729
00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:46.439
the concept, you would want to involve other types

730
00:48:46.449 --> 00:48:53.000
of expertise in deciding um what the third concept

731
00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:57.510
denotes and how it can be responsibly measured. Maybe

732
00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.600
some people will have lived experience uh of, of,

733
00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:04.840
of this phenomenon. Suppose you want to measure um

734
00:49:05.139 --> 00:49:08.810
uh what it means to thrive under uh uh

735
00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:13.919
financial insecurity. That's a project that I've done recently

736
00:49:13.929 --> 00:49:17.399
with a UK charity called Turn To Us. Um

737
00:49:17.719 --> 00:49:20.540
It would be really wrong. Uh I've had a

738
00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:23.399
lot of different kinds of insecurity in my life.

739
00:49:23.409 --> 00:49:26.310
Um You know, I'm an immigrant uh uh uh

740
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:30.580
from a country with a bad passport. Uh BUT

741
00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:35.320
I have not really known um homelessness, right. But

742
00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:37.750
it, so it would be wrong for me to

743
00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.570
decide what is thriving, having never experienced homelessness and

744
00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.469
having not talked to people who have. So when

745
00:49:45.479 --> 00:49:49.050
we talk about democratization of measurement, we're talking about

746
00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:53.750
involvement of people with different kinds of expertise, including

747
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.870
lived in expertise in the very delineation of the

748
00:49:57.879 --> 00:50:02.090
object of study. And I don't see how it

749
00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:06.290
is possible to be a responsible scientist uh interested

750
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:10.379
in the concept without doing something like that. But

751
00:50:10.389 --> 00:50:13.189
there are different ways of involving uh you know,

752
00:50:13.199 --> 00:50:16.250
it doesn't mean you have to, you know, always

753
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.270
open up your measures to a democratic vote, but

754
00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.949
you definitely do have a responsibility not to monopolize

755
00:50:23.959 --> 00:50:26.129
as a scientist, the value judgment.

756
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.639
Mhm uh Could you tell us a little bit

757
00:50:29.649 --> 00:50:34.419
more about that case study that you did with

758
00:50:34.429 --> 00:50:38.120
uh turn to us to understand perhaps a little

759
00:50:38.129 --> 00:50:43.840
bit better about how uh coal production would work

760
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:48.780
uh within this framework of democratizing measurement.

761
00:50:49.659 --> 00:50:53.120
Thank you. So, coproduction is a word uh that

762
00:50:53.129 --> 00:50:56.169
gets used in very many different ways in philosophy

763
00:50:56.179 --> 00:50:59.379
and science studies. Uh Some people say that uh

764
00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:02.570
um yeah, co production is uh you know, a

765
00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:07.540
co evolution of science and uh uh technology and

766
00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:11.929
society at once. And other people talk about co

767
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:16.800
production as uh you know, creating uh products um

768
00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:21.310
with users in mind. Uh CO production as Mark

769
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:25.800
Fabian and I um uh have explored um because

770
00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:30.280
of our uh uh experience of working with uh

771
00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.820
uh the, the anti poverty charity turned to us

772
00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.040
is uh the following sense, we want to figure

773
00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:44.290
out how to croce definitions and measures of uh

774
00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:49.040
uh uh phenomena denoted by thick concepts in a

775
00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:53.840
way that includes different types of experts. So we

776
00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:57.510
think there are three different sources of expertise. If

777
00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.760
you are interested in ethic concept, like well being

778
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:05.889
or sustainability or resilience, there's your expertise as a,

779
00:52:05.899 --> 00:52:10.010
as a scientist or, or a philosopher where, you

780
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.919
know, you know, relevant theories and you know, how

781
00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:16.239
measures work, you know, psychometrics, you know, metrology, you

782
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:19.340
know, how difficult it is to quantify things. Uh

783
00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:22.429
Then there is the lived expertise of what it's

784
00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:26.600
like, for example, to um gain resilience as a

785
00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:30.419
person or a community uh or what it's like

786
00:52:30.429 --> 00:52:33.739
to live in um uh to, to be able

787
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:38.419
to thrive um uh under financial insecurity. Um So

788
00:52:38.429 --> 00:52:42.500
that's a second kind. And then the third kind

789
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:47.360
is professional expertise, expertise of uh you know, front

790
00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:52.780
level, uh front line bureaucrats um of social workers,

791
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:56.310
of charity workers who try to figure out um

792
00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.580
how to provide certain services, how to uh to

793
00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:03.939
relief. So there probably are other cases. Uh THERE

794
00:53:03.949 --> 00:53:06.489
probably are other sources of expertise, but those are

795
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:09.699
the three that we thought was uh enough for

796
00:53:09.709 --> 00:53:13.229
our case. So if you really want to cope

797
00:53:13.239 --> 00:53:18.280
uh to democratize measurement of uh scientific uh of

798
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:22.129
thick concepts uh to coro you want, you want

799
00:53:22.139 --> 00:53:24.919
to croce them and to croce them, you want

800
00:53:24.929 --> 00:53:28.989
to include all three types of expertise. And then

801
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.520
if you manage to produce, maybe they will maybe,

802
00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:35.919
maybe nothing will ari arouse of maybe maybe no

803
00:53:35.929 --> 00:53:41.449
single concept can uh respond to all three, right?

804
00:53:41.459 --> 00:53:44.360
And can can maybe there will be no agreement

805
00:53:44.679 --> 00:53:47.729
in the end between three types of expertise in

806
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.270
which case, you're not gonna have a measure. But

807
00:53:51.439 --> 00:53:55.229
if you thought, you know, if you, if you

808
00:53:55.239 --> 00:53:58.479
did, then that would be the, the, the co

809
00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.919
production ideal uh that, that we're looking for and

810
00:54:01.929 --> 00:54:03.780
we think it is sometimes possible.

811
00:54:04.419 --> 00:54:08.510
Mhm You know, a a very interesting thing that

812
00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:11.340
I would like to comment on and perhaps ask

813
00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:13.929
you another question about the uh that you mentioned

814
00:54:13.939 --> 00:54:18.879
there is the fact that you also include lived

815
00:54:18.889 --> 00:54:23.899
expertise or lived experts in this endeavor because I

816
00:54:23.909 --> 00:54:28.070
mean, we've already talked here today about how we

817
00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:33.360
tend to put uh quantitative data above qualitative data

818
00:54:33.435 --> 00:54:37.455
in terms of rigorousness, for example, and how seriously

819
00:54:37.465 --> 00:54:42.225
we should take those data scientifically. But i, it's

820
00:54:42.235 --> 00:54:47.235
even more common perhaps for the people, even many

821
00:54:47.245 --> 00:54:53.024
times, scientists themselves to uh dismiss um, the, the

822
00:54:53.034 --> 00:54:58.524
lived experiences of people they are studying and perhaps

823
00:54:58.655 --> 00:55:02.830
when it comes to trying to understand uh their

824
00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:10.409
psychology, for example, imposing certain ways of rationalizing their

825
00:55:10.419 --> 00:55:16.060
own experiences when they themselves perhaps have not experienced

826
00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:16.449
it.

827
00:55:16.879 --> 00:55:24.360
Right. Mhm. Um There'll be a number of biases

828
00:55:24.399 --> 00:55:29.870
that any expert is prone to make. Uh And

829
00:55:29.879 --> 00:55:31.610
that will be true whether or not you're a

830
00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.100
lift expert, whether or not you are an academic

831
00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:38.429
expert or whether or not you are a professional

832
00:55:38.439 --> 00:55:44.070
expert. And uh there is no reason to focus

833
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:50.459
uh more or exclusively on the biases connected to

834
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:55.639
the lived expertise than any other. Uh So my

835
00:55:55.649 --> 00:55:59.770
worry with uh philosophers who uh and scholars who

836
00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:05.610
say, well, we can't include the people um in

837
00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:11.770
our studies because they're biased or they are ideological

838
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:19.669
or they are um misinformed. Um Because uh yeah,

839
00:56:19.679 --> 00:56:24.219
for obvious reason that that's uh um tends to

840
00:56:24.229 --> 00:56:28.969
represent uh you as not being subjected to such

841
00:56:28.979 --> 00:56:34.129
biases. So it's very difficult to do co production.

842
00:56:34.149 --> 00:56:37.290
Uh YOU, it will force uh if we really

843
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:42.239
did that systematically as, as I'm asking scientists to

844
00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:47.000
do, we would uh be forced into many uncomfortable

845
00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:50.250
situation talking to people that, uh you know, with

846
00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:53.939
views that we hate talking to uh people who,

847
00:56:53.949 --> 00:56:56.939
who are uh you know, much more ignorant and

848
00:56:56.949 --> 00:57:03.959
dismissive about each other's work. Um uh So, yeah,

849
00:57:03.969 --> 00:57:07.139
it will be uncomfortable. It will be a time

850
00:57:07.149 --> 00:57:09.750
suck. It will be, it will, it, it will

851
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.500
put us out of our comfort zone. It will

852
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:16.370
jeopardize projects. It will make science much more difficult,

853
00:57:16.379 --> 00:57:21.610
much more ex expensive. But that's the price of

854
00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:23.050
studying the concepts.

855
00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:28.290
Mhm. And perhaps in certain situations, it would force

856
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:32.479
researchers, scientists to go back to the drawing board

857
00:57:32.489 --> 00:57:36.520
when it comes to the way they have conceptualized

858
00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:41.800
or operationalized uh their own objects of study.

859
00:57:42.389 --> 00:57:44.360
That's a great way to put it. Thank you.

860
00:57:45.399 --> 00:57:49.479
So, uh one last uh topic then that I

861
00:57:49.489 --> 00:57:52.020
would like to ask you about what is uh

862
00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:56.659
pluralism from the perspective of philosophy of science and

863
00:57:56.669 --> 00:58:03.540
particularly with this conceptual and methodological pluralism entail

864
00:58:06.629 --> 00:58:11.800
pluralism is um uh a big topic nowadays. And

865
00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:15.199
because um a lot of philosophers of science are

866
00:58:15.209 --> 00:58:19.590
exploring ideas that it would be uh good uh

867
00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:23.469
for science to be more pluralistic about its um

868
00:58:23.719 --> 00:58:26.909
you know, choice of methods and choice of uh

869
00:58:26.919 --> 00:58:31.500
theories. Um It's also a controversial topic because, you

870
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:35.199
know, as soon as you introduce pluralism, uh then

871
00:58:35.209 --> 00:58:37.689
uh uh uh for many people, you're opening the

872
00:58:37.699 --> 00:58:41.169
gates of hell and opening uh um the, the

873
00:58:41.179 --> 00:58:44.669
gates of um you know, well, let's be pluralist

874
00:58:44.679 --> 00:58:46.909
about whether or not vaccines work and let's be

875
00:58:46.919 --> 00:58:51.090
pluralist about whether or not um uh they cause

876
00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:54.479
autism and things like that and uh you won't

877
00:58:54.489 --> 00:58:58.229
always want uh to, to do that. So I,

878
00:58:58.239 --> 00:59:01.080
I don't think it is helpful in general to

879
00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:03.250
talk about whether pluralism is a good thing or

880
00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:05.709
a bad thing uh In, in science. I mean,

881
00:59:05.719 --> 00:59:10.800
I have colleagues who have articulated certain um conceptions

882
00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:15.239
of pluralism. Um BUT, you know, for, for, for

883
00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:17.199
the general case, but I'm not one of them,

884
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:24.510
I'm interested in pluralism in um um uh things

885
00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:28.300
like thick concepts so well being and that um

886
00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:32.500
I have uh studied at length, I think uh

887
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:36.500
the sciences of well being would really benefit from

888
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:41.649
um a certain kind of very principled uh pluralism.

889
00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:46.320
So, and there is a big uh uh temptation

890
00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:51.169
uh to um settle for example, on a single

891
00:59:51.179 --> 00:59:55.340
number, a small number of core metrics of well

892
00:59:55.350 --> 01:00:00.850
being um or mental health. Because if we all

893
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:04.229
collect data on the same thing, we'll be able

894
01:00:04.239 --> 01:00:08.300
to co collate this data and to figure out

895
01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:11.709
the effect sizes of certain in interventions and we'll

896
01:00:11.719 --> 01:00:15.120
be able to uh act on, on, on that

897
01:00:15.129 --> 01:00:18.699
material, right? So a lot of people, there's a

898
01:00:18.709 --> 01:00:21.959
even a hashtag common measures on, on Twitter that

899
01:00:21.969 --> 01:00:25.790
you could look up. Uh PEOPLE advocate um a

900
01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:30.439
recent article says uh measures and are not like

901
01:00:30.449 --> 01:00:35.909
toothbrushes, it's OK to re reuse them. Um Sure.

902
01:00:35.919 --> 01:00:39.429
Yeah, it's OK to reuse them. Um But if

903
01:00:39.439 --> 01:00:42.510
you, if you really are studying a thick concept

904
01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.429
and a thick concept that is grounded in the

905
01:00:44.439 --> 01:00:48.790
context in which it is used, then um uh

906
01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:54.610
uh common measures won't work. Um And common measures

907
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.449
uh are great if you, if you think you

908
01:00:57.459 --> 01:01:00.459
have a phenomenon that is, that has the same

909
01:01:00.469 --> 01:01:04.020
definition across all contexts and means the same to

910
01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:07.120
the same people, to, to, to different people and

911
01:01:07.129 --> 01:01:10.729
doesn't need and, and can easily be transported from

912
01:01:10.739 --> 01:01:14.550
Porto to Cambridge England. But that won't always be

913
01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:20.239
the case. Um So, um I think pluralism about

914
01:01:20.649 --> 01:01:24.580
uh measurement of uh well-being, pluralism about methods to

915
01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:27.530
approach well-being is a recognition of the fact that

916
01:01:27.919 --> 01:01:30.550
uh the concepts that we are interested in are

917
01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.959
often grounded in the, in the little experience of

918
01:01:33.969 --> 01:01:38.070
our uh existence and in the, the, the priorities

919
01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.340
that our communities have. And um I, I do

920
01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:46.419
realize that advocating that kind of uh pluralism, for

921
01:01:46.429 --> 01:01:53.060
example, you know, like, you know, resist uh measurement

922
01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:57.949
of life satisfaction for, for everyone because it doesn't

923
01:01:57.959 --> 01:02:02.510
really carry enough information. Uh I, I realized that

924
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.800
it's controversial because yes, then it, you know, goes

925
01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:09.580
against that idea of, you know, accumulating information and

926
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:13.530
cumulative science and building building on it. But it's

927
01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:15.959
also the right thing to do I think because

928
01:02:15.969 --> 01:02:18.879
uh we are not always studying the same thing.

929
01:02:19.209 --> 01:02:21.010
So the kind of pluralism that I would like

930
01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:25.189
to uh uh put my name under and uh

931
01:02:25.199 --> 01:02:29.060
uh and, and explore and advocate is uh uh

932
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:33.520
a pluralism about measurement that is motivated explicitly uh

933
01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:37.790
by the fact that uh the objects that we

934
01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:42.969
study in science are often not very easily transportable

935
01:02:42.979 --> 01:02:45.870
from one context to another. A lot of work

936
01:02:45.879 --> 01:02:48.580
needs to be done in order to transport them.

937
01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:52.250
Um And when they are transported, they often distort

938
01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:58.310
reality uh and making signs more local and more

939
01:02:58.429 --> 01:03:03.070
uh um yeah, less ambitious in some ways is,

940
01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.290
is not a bad thing in those cases.

941
01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:10.959
And so just to wrap up the interview, um

942
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.429
I mean, in the particular case of well being,

943
01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:19.830
that would imply for example, that we would expect

944
01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.750
that cross culturally, we would probably get a different

945
01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:31.270
understandings of what, what well being is and perhaps

946
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.510
how it should be measured. Would that would that

947
01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.389
be an example?

948
01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:41.030
Definitely the rise of cross cultural measurement of well

949
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.120
being is one of the most interesting and controversial

950
01:03:44.129 --> 01:03:47.340
trends uh in, in, in my view. And that

951
01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:51.169
is because um there's a lot of demand uh

952
01:03:51.179 --> 01:03:53.949
in the media even for these uh kind of

953
01:03:53.959 --> 01:03:59.159
reports. World Happiness Report or, you know, world well

954
01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:03.060
being ranking like is Finland always going to be

955
01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:06.030
on top? What is it that the Finland Finland

956
01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.189
has that other countries don't have that or you

957
01:04:09.199 --> 01:04:11.739
know, Iberian countries in Latin America always comes out

958
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:15.270
quite good uh for on, on those, on those

959
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:20.629
rankings. Um uh AND Eastern Europe uh usually very

960
01:04:20.639 --> 01:04:27.760
poorly. Uh Probably more so even now. Um uh

961
01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:33.399
ARE these meaningful projects, are they? Well, um I

962
01:04:33.409 --> 01:04:36.310
suppose it depends what your goal is, right? If

963
01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.149
your goal is to um I don't know, maximally

964
01:04:40.159 --> 01:04:45.080
compare countries possibly, but if your goal is to

965
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:49.050
really understand what well being means in different contexts

966
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.780
and uh how is it that people flourish in

967
01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:58.110
different contexts? Uh Then um you probably, well, I

968
01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.820
don't want to say that it's that, that it's

969
01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:03.290
a bad idea to compare because compare is how

970
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:07.169
we learn and compare is how we um how

971
01:05:07.179 --> 01:05:10.010
we make progress and how we, you know how

972
01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:13.000
we make sense of each other. But comparison always

973
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.590
comes with a cost. Yes. And I do think

974
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.830
that uh it's important to really take the big

975
01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.250
cross cultural comparisons with a grain of salt. But

976
01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:25.840
it's also really important to figure out how to

977
01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:29.870
do uh signs of well being in a way

978
01:05:29.879 --> 01:05:35.060
that uh communicate the richness across and then in

979
01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:38.840
and in a way that exposes um how many

980
01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:41.949
different conceptions of well being there are across the

981
01:05:41.959 --> 01:05:44.409
world and how they bleed into each other and

982
01:05:44.419 --> 01:05:48.459
change and affect each other. So uh that's the

983
01:05:48.469 --> 01:05:50.320
big circle that I would like to square

984
01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:55.409
Great. So just to mention the book, we've been

985
01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:59.520
focusing mostly on today. Again, limits of the numerical

986
01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:04.179
abuses and uses of quantification. Um I'm leaving a

987
01:06:04.189 --> 01:06:06.030
link to it in the description box of the

988
01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.169
interview. And Doctor Alexandrova, apart from the book, would

989
01:06:10.179 --> 01:06:12.469
you like to tell people where they can find

990
01:06:12.479 --> 01:06:14.770
you and your work on the internet?

991
01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:21.840
Uh Thank you. So I am um um I

992
01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:24.280
teach and do most of my work in uh

993
01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:28.530
Cambridge England and I have a great uh uh

994
01:06:28.929 --> 01:06:32.820
commitment to open access of my work to the

995
01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:36.699
extent that I can. Um I therefore um uh

996
01:06:36.709 --> 01:06:40.479
place uh you know, all of the writings to

997
01:06:40.489 --> 01:06:44.179
the extent that it is legal uh of on

998
01:06:44.189 --> 01:06:49.239
various um uh platforms such as fill papers or

999
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:54.439
my university's open access scheme. Uh I am uh

1000
01:06:54.449 --> 01:06:57.600
um as a, as a, as far as media

1001
01:06:57.610 --> 01:07:01.770
engagement is concerned, I'm on uh blue sky um

1002
01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:05.520
right now uh no longer on Twitter. And I

1003
01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:09.719
really uh welcome uh feedback and I welcome es

1004
01:07:09.729 --> 01:07:17.820
especially uh um scientists and practitioners experience about uh

1005
01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:21.810
uh studying what might look like a thick concept

1006
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:24.739
in doing that uh uh with uh kind of

1007
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:28.939
responsible recognition of the value judgments involved. I, I

1008
01:07:28.949 --> 01:07:34.780
welcome very much uh uh feedback and also sharing

1009
01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:37.780
uh people's experience of how to do that well.

1010
01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:42.110
Mhm Very well. So I will be also leaving

1011
