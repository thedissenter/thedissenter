00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.269
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.389
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes, and

3
00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:09.810
today I'm joined again by Doctor Richard Wolff, and

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.449
we're going to talk about economic inequality from a

5
00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:18.909
Marxist perspective and how and why we should tax

6
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.690
the rich. So, Doctor Wolff, welcome back to the

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.409
show. It's always a pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.319
Very glad to be here and I enjoyed my

9
00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:28.899
conversations with you very much.

10
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.880
Thank you. So, uh, how do you approach the

11
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.409
topic of economic inequality from a Marxist perspective and

12
00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.639
what drives economic inequality?

13
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.979
OK, uh, the Marxist perspective makes this an easy

14
00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:54.180
question to answer. Inequality which has haunted human communities

15
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.279
for a long time, is a problem that has

16
00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:04.680
also always haunted capitalism. Whatever role it played in

17
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.919
feudalism, slavery, or ancient economies, it has always been

18
00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:14.650
a problem of capitalism. Uh, IF you are familiar

19
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.290
with literature, you will know that most of the

20
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.470
greatest literature, Charles Dickens, Emile Zola, Maxim Gorky, uh,

21
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.830
Jack London, I could go on, are magnificent studies

22
00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:35.230
of, among other things, the inequality produced and reproduced

23
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.529
by capitalism. Another way of saying the same thing

24
00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:46.449
is that capitalism itself has recognized its tendency to

25
00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:52.569
inequality because it has tried in every way to

26
00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.370
cope with the inequality because it is fearful that

27
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.849
if you make too many people too poor, they

28
00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:05.120
will turn against the capitalist system. Which has already

29
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.380
happened and I can assure you will happen again.

30
00:02:10.038 --> 00:02:15.279
Indeed, if you look at September 10th, uh, activities

31
00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.800
across the country known as France, or if you

32
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.839
look at the turmoil in Nepal, or you look

33
00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.880
at the turmoil in the United States, much of

34
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.160
it is about inequality and how people feel about

35
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.800
it. Last thing, The home, the dominant country of

36
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.440
capitalism over the last century has been the United

37
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.149
States, as most people know. Mhm. OK, the United

38
00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:53.029
States is a study in the failure of capitalism.

39
00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.660
To end the inequality that even many capitalists recognize

40
00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:05.460
to be a problem. They can't solve it, and

41
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.809
the reason capitalists can't solve the problem of inequality

42
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.990
is because to do so would require to get

43
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.889
rid of the capitalism itself. And to make it

44
00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.649
as dramatic as I know how, last week in

45
00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:28.669
the United States, The Tesla Corporation, one of the

46
00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:34.589
world's large corporations that produces the famous Tesla electric

47
00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:40.669
automobiles and trucks, Offered its own CEO, that is

48
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.330
the board of directors, about 20 people, offered Mr.

49
00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:50.690
Musk, the CEO who's on the board. That board

50
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.429
offered one of its own members a 10-year contract

51
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.580
for $1 trillion. Which is interesting for two reasons.

52
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.839
It is the largest offer of a salary ever

53
00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:12.279
made to any CEO anywhere in the world ever.

54
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.548
And number 2, it is an offer made to

55
00:04:18.548 --> 00:04:24.079
a person who is already the richest person on

56
00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:29.850
this planet. Whose personal wealth is currently estimated at

57
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.489
between 3 and $400 billion. OK, that is an

58
00:04:36.489 --> 00:04:41.649
out of control activity. It is like a bad

59
00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:47.309
joke. It is a demonstration that in capitalism, You

60
00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:54.140
make the rich richer and everybody else poorer. 40

61
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.579
years ago, 50 years ago, in the, in the

62
00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:02.019
decades immediately after World War II, the United States

63
00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:07.100
was less unequal than most of the European countries.

64
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:15.200
Today, the United States is more unequal than the

65
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.230
European countries. Why? Because it has been the home

66
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:29.869
of capitalism, and capitalism produces, reproduces inequality. Only making

67
00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:36.350
it worse decade after decade unless and until there's

68
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.559
an uprising of the people who say no more.

69
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.850
Then you can see it reduced for a while,

70
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.880
but the minute the popular uprising is over, the

71
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:57.579
basic mechanism of capitalism producing inequality resumes. Now, let

72
00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:00.899
me give you, if, if, if I can, uh,

73
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.170
a basic explanation for why this happens. Capitalism is

74
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:12.070
a peculiar economic system. In that it relates to

75
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.549
groups of people in every capitalist workplace, every factory,

76
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.609
every office, every store. In these institutions, if they're

77
00:06:23.609 --> 00:06:29.010
organized in a capitalistic way, a small number of

78
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:37.040
people, the owner of the enterprise, The leading. Executive,

79
00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:41.309
the board of directors, if it's a modern corporation,

80
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.700
which is a tiny group of people. Boards of

81
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.140
directors are usually between 8 and 9 and 20

82
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.790
people. That's it. The vast majority of the people

83
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:59.739
in every workplace are the employees. The people at

84
00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:04.480
the top who run the enterprise are the employer.

85
00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:09.859
According to the United States Census, 3% of our

86
00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:17.670
people are employers, and that includes the self-employed. The

87
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:26.079
other 97% are not. Employers, they are employees. OK.

88
00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:33.320
The employer in capitalism makes the following decisions. And

89
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:39.670
the employees are excluded from these decisions what to

90
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:45.519
produce. What technology to use, where to conduct the

91
00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:50.480
production. And what to do with the output or

92
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.459
if you like the revenue from selling the output,

93
00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.459
which is what the employer does. The employer decides

94
00:08:00.799 --> 00:08:07.679
how to distribute the revenue of the company. And

95
00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:13.779
guess what? The employers, that small group, distribute the

96
00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:21.750
lion's share of the revenue to themselves. As shareholders,

97
00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:26.369
they get dividends, and as top executives, they get

98
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:31.920
stock options and salaries, and all the rest. And

99
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.630
that way of distributing the output we all help

100
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.320
to produce means that the mass of people get

101
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.770
very little and the employer class is the rich

102
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.940
people in our culture. So you have built into

103
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:59.580
the organization of capitalism, the mechanisms whereby some are

104
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.419
rich and most are not.

105
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.090
So let me ask you this question then, because

106
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.440
this is something that very often we hear from

107
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:16.659
capitalists, from people who defend capitalism as an economic

108
00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:23.960
system. Is economic inequality in any way? Quote unquote

109
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.630
natural, should we expect it to occur just naturally,

110
00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:34.070
or is it the result of how the economic

111
00:09:34.289 --> 00:09:37.719
and the political system are structured?

112
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.880
Well, from a Marxian perspective, which is what I'm

113
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.440
offering to you here, it is absolutely a matter

114
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:53.599
of social decision-making, social debate, social conflict, social arrangements.

115
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.880
It has, there's nothing natural about it. Uh, IT

116
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.479
has always, always been the effort of those at

117
00:10:02.479 --> 00:10:07.900
the top. To give a natural explanation or a

118
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.140
natural foundation to their wealth, because that's a way

119
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.880
of persuading people that there's no point in trying

120
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.960
to change this because it's natural. It's as if

121
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.135
you were shaking your fist at the sky. When

122
00:10:23.135 --> 00:10:26.335
it rains, you can shake your fist all you

123
00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:30.135
want. The sky has its own mechanisms. It's a

124
00:10:30.135 --> 00:10:34.375
natural process. The water is evaporated from the oceans,

125
00:10:34.655 --> 00:10:37.715
goes up into the clouds, and then comes down

126
00:10:37.715 --> 00:10:41.315
on us as rain around and around. It's natural.

127
00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:47.119
In the days of slavery, masters told the slaves

128
00:10:47.369 --> 00:10:52.229
that slavery was just natural. Some people were born

129
00:10:52.729 --> 00:10:56.369
to be masters, and others were born to be

130
00:10:56.369 --> 00:11:00.289
slaves. In feudalism, the lords told that to the

131
00:11:00.289 --> 00:11:03.309
serfs, or they had the church tell the serfs.

132
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:07.710
That's what God wanted. That one is to be

133
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.489
a lord, that one is to be a serf.

134
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:16.369
So it is very natural that in capitalism, the

135
00:11:16.369 --> 00:11:22.530
capitalists would try to give a naturalistic explanation for

136
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.299
what they are doing, but I don't believe it.

137
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.489
I don't believe the mass of people believe it.

138
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.369
It is an idea put forward by the capitalists

139
00:11:32.369 --> 00:11:38.090
to justify their situation, but it's outlived its usefulness

140
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.289
if it ever had any.

141
00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.739
And also a very interesting kind of argument that

142
00:11:44.739 --> 00:11:49.340
we commonly hear from capitalists is that capitalism is

143
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.770
a system that is in accordance with human nature,

144
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.340
but I mean it doesn't make much sense to

145
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:02.059
say that an economic system that has only existed

146
00:12:02.059 --> 00:12:08.719
for the past. Around 300 years in 200,000 or

147
00:12:08.719 --> 00:12:12.840
300,000 years that we have existed as Homo sapiens.

148
00:12:14.049 --> 00:12:18.719
As anything to do with something natural or

149
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.900
right. Yeah, it is a very strange argument uh

150
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.719
to make for me, it has exactly the same

151
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.580
nonsense as naturalism. It, it's not in nature that

152
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.479
we have capitalism and it's not in human nature

153
00:12:35.619 --> 00:12:39.239
either. But again, I would tell you that every

154
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:46.030
effort. Every defensive effort by people with privilege is

155
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:51.309
to try desperately to explain their privilege in a

156
00:12:51.309 --> 00:12:56.630
way that will prevent or undermine the effort of

157
00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:01.090
the non-privileged to change the situation. This is an

158
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.909
ideological game. You want, you, you're afraid. Why are

159
00:13:05.909 --> 00:13:11.700
you afraid? Very simple. Because the rich are always

160
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:17.059
few and the poor are always many, so the

161
00:13:17.059 --> 00:13:23.059
rich have always understood that makes them vulnerable if

162
00:13:23.059 --> 00:13:27.250
the mass of people get together. They will be

163
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.369
able to do what they want, and the small

164
00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:33.330
group of the rich will not be able to

165
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.640
stop them, so they have learned long ago, you

166
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.669
must try as best you can. To shape the

167
00:13:42.669 --> 00:13:47.109
thinking of the mass of people so they don't

168
00:13:47.109 --> 00:13:50.830
get together to change the system, and one of

169
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.030
the ways you do that is to explain that

170
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.419
nature makes it this way or that God makes

171
00:13:58.419 --> 00:14:02.190
it this way, or that the human brain is

172
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:07.549
simply made this anything to get people not to

173
00:14:07.549 --> 00:14:10.840
get together. To not try to make a change.

174
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:16.090
I, I want to underscore. When things get unequal

175
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:22.820
enough, the mass of people usually overcome these ideological

176
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.299
programs and get together and make exactly the changes

177
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.520
that they were told they couldn't do. I will

178
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.820
give you an example. In the 1930s we had

179
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:39.419
the worst collapse of capitalism in its history. From

180
00:14:39.419 --> 00:14:47.840
1929 to 1941, we had a 12-year global economic

181
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.979
depression. It's called the Great Depression for that reason.

182
00:14:53.489 --> 00:14:58.950
Here in the United States, the working class Unemployed

183
00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:03.919
by the millions at that time. ROSE up and

184
00:15:03.919 --> 00:15:09.789
moved politically to the left. They joined the CIO,

185
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:14.659
the union movement here. It was a unionization wave.

186
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.840
We've never had it in the United States. We've

187
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.280
never had it before the 1930s. We've never had

188
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.880
it since the 1930s. But in that Great Depression,

189
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:31.390
tens of millions of American workers joined unions. And

190
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:36.349
tens of thousands of American workers joined two socialist

191
00:15:36.349 --> 00:15:40.469
parties and a communist party, and the Communist Party

192
00:15:40.469 --> 00:15:44.549
and the two socialist parties and the CIO unions

193
00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:49.549
worked together. And here's what they did. They radically

194
00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:54.349
reduced the inequality of wealth and income in this

195
00:15:54.349 --> 00:15:59.469
country. Radically. If you look at the inequality chart

196
00:15:59.469 --> 00:16:03.739
of the 20th century, you'll see inequality very high

197
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.200
until the Great Depression, then it drops like a

198
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.640
stone, and then once the war, World War II

199
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.320
is over, it resumes to where we are today.

200
00:16:14.679 --> 00:16:18.320
But what the 1930s proved was that if the

201
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.919
mass of people get together and if they have

202
00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:27.109
in their minds a left-wing Heavily influenced by Marx,

203
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.440
by the way, attitude, they can in fact make

204
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.739
for changes. We have in the United States today,

205
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.760
a pension, a public pension program. If you become

206
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.599
over 65 years of age, you are entitled to

207
00:16:43.599 --> 00:16:48.239
get what we call here Social Security. That was

208
00:16:48.239 --> 00:16:54.070
created by the workers during the 1930s. We also

209
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.950
have, if you lose your job here, you get

210
00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:02.849
unemployment compensation. That was a program never existed before,

211
00:17:03.229 --> 00:17:08.550
created by the radical workers in the 1930s. We

212
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.589
have a minimum wage. We never had that before.

213
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:15.030
That was created in the 19, I could go

214
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:19.089
on, but all of the efforts to do something.

215
00:17:20.128 --> 00:17:26.729
WERE made by opponents of capitalism against capitalism, and

216
00:17:26.729 --> 00:17:33.380
as soon as capitalism overcame that opposition. It resumed

217
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.339
its internal mechanisms, so we are back now to

218
00:17:37.339 --> 00:17:40.459
what, to what the United States is now more

219
00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:43.339
extremely unequal than it has ever been in my

220
00:17:43.339 --> 00:17:46.540
lifetime, and I was born and lived all my

221
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.180
life here in the United States. The level of

222
00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.520
inequality that I see around me every day. IS

223
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.640
the extreme, more so than ever before, and it

224
00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.319
is, in case you haven't noticed, tearing this country

225
00:18:01.319 --> 00:18:03.160
apart internally.

226
00:18:04.579 --> 00:18:08.380
So on what grounds would you make a case

227
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.900
for taxing the rich? Why should we tax the

228
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.959
rich or why should we tax them more?

229
00:18:17.589 --> 00:18:22.989
The answer is we need to tax the rich

230
00:18:22.989 --> 00:18:26.949
because if we're going to have government programs, which

231
00:18:26.949 --> 00:18:30.520
this system needs, There's no other way to pay

232
00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.630
for them. We are now at that point. That's

233
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:37.010
part of the economic crisis of the United States

234
00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:42.839
today. We have a rule. You cannot tax corporations

235
00:18:42.839 --> 00:18:46.290
and the rich. And the reason that rule is

236
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:52.050
observed is that our political system depends on donations

237
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:56.170
of money from the corporations and the rich, and

238
00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.770
they only support candidates in either party who will

239
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:05.885
observe the rule don't tax corporations. And the rich

240
00:19:06.555 --> 00:19:10.875
leave the taxes on them very, very low. So

241
00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:14.925
where has the system gone to raise money? Answer

242
00:19:15.435 --> 00:19:20.994
for a while, 1945 to 1975, you might say,

243
00:19:21.275 --> 00:19:24.594
it pushed the burden of taxes onto the working

244
00:19:24.594 --> 00:19:27.949
class. The way that if you're interested, the way

245
00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:31.910
that was done was you stopped using the income

246
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:36.010
tax, which is a progressive tax, and you shifted

247
00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.469
to what is called a payroll tax in which

248
00:19:39.469 --> 00:19:42.989
everybody is taxed the same percentage. Which means that

249
00:19:42.989 --> 00:19:45.750
the richer you are, the, the less important the

250
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.589
tax is for you, and the poorer you are,

251
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.790
the worse it is for you. After 1975, the

252
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.640
working class said no more taxes. So then the

253
00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.839
government took the next step. Instead of taxing people

254
00:20:00.839 --> 00:20:04.739
to pay for the government, it borrowed the money.

255
00:20:05.119 --> 00:20:08.599
Let me give you an example. In 1970, the

256
00:20:08.599 --> 00:20:13.400
total debt borrowing of the United States government was

257
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:23.800
$300 billion. Today, it's $37 trillion. The borrowing has

258
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.229
gone up faster than anything else. The government borrows,

259
00:20:28.479 --> 00:20:32.040
but here comes the joke. Who does the government

260
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:37.040
borrow from? Answer, corporations and the rich. They're the

261
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.140
only ones who have the money that can lend

262
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.449
to the government. So what the government did is

263
00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:48.290
not tax corporations. And then go to them and

264
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:52.130
say, the money we didn't tax from you, please

265
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.839
lend it to us. Because we will pay you

266
00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:58.479
back in 5 or 10 years, and we will

267
00:20:58.479 --> 00:21:02.290
pay you interest every year. So for corporations and

268
00:21:02.439 --> 00:21:06.599
the rich, this was a funny joke. Instead of

269
00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:10.599
taxes, you have an investment. Of course, they supported

270
00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:14.550
it. But now the government has borrowed so much

271
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.619
money, and by the way, this is the same

272
00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:19.390
in England, this is the same in France, this

273
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.189
is the same in Germany and Italy. This is

274
00:21:22.189 --> 00:21:25.449
not unique to the United States. But at this

275
00:21:25.449 --> 00:21:29.290
point corporations and the rich have told the government.

276
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.390
We won't lend you any more money because you're

277
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:37.069
so deep in debt, it isn't safe to lend

278
00:21:37.069 --> 00:21:41.410
you money anymore. We won't let you tax us.

279
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.670
We won't lend you any money, and the government

280
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:49.949
goes back to the capitalists and says, Then we

281
00:21:49.949 --> 00:21:55.810
can't function. And then comes Mr. Trump and people

282
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.030
like him. And they come up with another few

283
00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.849
years, we can go on. Here's what we will

284
00:22:01.849 --> 00:22:07.400
do. We will tax the people. But we'll do

285
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:12.579
it in a way that fools them. That's called

286
00:22:12.579 --> 00:22:16.300
a tariff. So what Mr. Trump does is he

287
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.260
says, I'm going to go after the companies that

288
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.859
bring goods into the United States from other parts

289
00:22:23.859 --> 00:22:26.420
of the world, and they will have to pay

290
00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.150
a tax. So he gets money from the government.

291
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.020
But he knows what, what those companies will do

292
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.699
is turn around and raise the prices to the

293
00:22:38.699 --> 00:22:42.140
public for what comes in. So the, the bottle

294
00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.489
of French wine will be double in price. And

295
00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:48.180
the cup of latte coffee in the morning will

296
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.819
be double in price. Why? Because French wine comes

297
00:22:51.819 --> 00:22:55.140
from France, and the coffee doesn't grow in the

298
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.819
United States. So Americans drink coffee every day. So

299
00:22:58.819 --> 00:23:02.660
that, for example, the largest importer of coffee brings

300
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:08.390
coffee from Brazil. So, Mr. Trump hits Brazil with

301
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:11.270
a big tariff. Up goes the price of the

302
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:15.949
coffee, but they know that the companies will push

303
00:23:15.949 --> 00:23:19.189
the burden of that tax onto the people, but

304
00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:22.469
it won't look like the government. It will look

305
00:23:22.469 --> 00:23:27.469
like prices, and they can blame the Brazilians, or

306
00:23:27.469 --> 00:23:31.469
they can blame the Chinese, anybody else. It gives

307
00:23:31.469 --> 00:23:34.290
them a few, it won't work very well. It

308
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:38.170
won't work very long, and the American working class

309
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:44.189
is horrified by the inflation. But it gives them

310
00:23:44.189 --> 00:23:47.949
another few years. And let me underscore something for

311
00:23:47.949 --> 00:23:53.660
your audience. The United States is now a desperate

312
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.199
country. The way to understand Mr. Trump and what

313
00:23:58.199 --> 00:24:03.790
you read about him and the United States. We're

314
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:08.869
desperate. The American empire is shrinking. A whole new

315
00:24:08.869 --> 00:24:13.430
empire is arising around China and the BRICS. Everybody

316
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:17.640
with half a brain sees it. There's no future

317
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.979
here. They can't borrow anymore. They dare not tax

318
00:24:21.979 --> 00:24:24.660
the rich, and the working class is on the

319
00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.079
edge of an explosion. They don't know what to

320
00:24:29.079 --> 00:24:32.050
do. And so they have a a a a

321
00:24:32.069 --> 00:24:36.239
a president who acts like a tough guy, who

322
00:24:36.239 --> 00:24:41.400
shoots boats in the ocean near Venezuela because they

323
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.760
might have a drug on the boat and he

324
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.359
kills people over there, and he stands behind the

325
00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:52.920
genocide in Israel on and on and on. These

326
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.000
are the behavior of desperate politicians. They don't know

327
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.699
what to do. And you know, in a certain

328
00:24:59.699 --> 00:25:03.839
way, it's not even their fault. They have been

329
00:25:03.839 --> 00:25:08.780
asked to do an impossible task. They are supposed

330
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:14.420
to rescue American capitalism when it is in a

331
00:25:14.719 --> 00:25:20.770
period of terminal decline. We had the American Empire.

332
00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:25.079
It replaced the British Empire. The British Empire, we

333
00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:29.109
all know, is over. What you don't know, but

334
00:25:29.109 --> 00:25:32.689
you should, is that the American empire is now

335
00:25:32.689 --> 00:25:37.670
in a process of dying. And you're watching the

336
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:42.890
death behavior of a dying empire. Don't be fooled.

337
00:25:43.069 --> 00:25:48.130
It's all bravado, it's all show, it's all public

338
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:52.469
relations, but the reality, radically different.

339
00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:57.430
OK, so let me ask you or let me

340
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.739
confront you with one of the arguments we most

341
00:26:00.739 --> 00:26:07.680
commonly hear from capitalists whenever the left talks about

342
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.800
taxing the rich, and this is something that actually

343
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:15.119
we also heard back in May when we had

344
00:26:15.119 --> 00:26:19.439
our general elections here in Portugal because the one

345
00:26:19.439 --> 00:26:24.444
of the. Leftist parties, the leftist bloc, proposed taxing

346
00:26:24.444 --> 00:26:28.655
the rich a little bit more, and another party,

347
00:26:29.114 --> 00:26:37.165
a neo-liberal party, the Liberal Initiative, immediately brought up

348
00:26:37.165 --> 00:26:40.885
this argument about, oh, if you try taxing the

349
00:26:40.885 --> 00:26:44.244
rich, they will leave the country, they will take

350
00:26:44.244 --> 00:26:49.089
their companies with them. Uh, AND with it the

351
00:26:49.089 --> 00:26:52.810
jobs they have created, and they will be, there

352
00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:58.040
will be massive unemployment and the economy will collapse.

353
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.469
I mean, is any of this true?

354
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:07.420
No. The short answer is no, and these arguments

355
00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.380
have exactly the same force and power as the

356
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.979
notion that it's human nature or nature or God

357
00:27:14.979 --> 00:27:18.010
or something else that makes all these things happen.

358
00:27:18.209 --> 00:27:22.219
Let me explain on several levels. First of all,

359
00:27:22.459 --> 00:27:24.859
there's much evidence, and I could show it to

360
00:27:24.859 --> 00:27:29.079
you if you had the time. Of cities, states,

361
00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.280
and whole countries that have raised taxes on the

362
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.599
rich and have not seen a significant exodus of

363
00:27:36.599 --> 00:27:40.849
wealthy people. Uh, IT, that's just a, a, a,

364
00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:44.099
a, a threat, but it has very little behind

365
00:27:44.099 --> 00:27:47.099
it, and, and you shouldn't be surprised. There are

366
00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:51.339
many reasons human beings live, for example, in Lisbon,

367
00:27:51.579 --> 00:27:55.300
Portugal, or in Paris, France, or in New York

368
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.920
City, where I am, as I speak to you.

369
00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.819
They don't, they're not just here because of the

370
00:28:00.819 --> 00:28:04.979
taxes, that's ridiculous. They're here because the city of

371
00:28:04.979 --> 00:28:09.020
New York offers a quality of life you can't

372
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.859
get anywhere else in the United States. You can't

373
00:28:11.859 --> 00:28:15.520
even get it close. Not even in Chicago or

374
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.260
Los Angeles or or one of the few other

375
00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:23.619
large cities. This is the intellectual, the financial, and

376
00:28:23.619 --> 00:28:28.359
the artistic center of the United States. And the

377
00:28:28.359 --> 00:28:31.959
people who live here want to live here. They

378
00:28:31.959 --> 00:28:35.880
want the restaurants. They want the museums. They want

379
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.839
the movies, the theater, the opera, all of it.

380
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.839
You tax them, and especially they're rich, cause what

381
00:28:43.839 --> 00:28:47.400
do they care? You tax them, they will grumble,

382
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.510
they don't want to, but they won't leave because

383
00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.839
that is for them, not an attractive option at

384
00:28:55.839 --> 00:29:00.089
all. They can take all their money, leave the

385
00:29:00.089 --> 00:29:03.430
United States, leave New York City, and then they

386
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:06.010
won't be able with all the money they've saved

387
00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:09.010
to buy the things they come to New York

388
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.530
to enjoy. That's the first, and there's empirical evidence.

389
00:29:13.829 --> 00:29:16.489
But now, let me give you, uh, the better

390
00:29:16.829 --> 00:29:20.550
response. The the better response that we make here

391
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:23.469
in the United States because we get the same

392
00:29:23.469 --> 00:29:27.969
arguments here that you got in Portugal. We make

393
00:29:27.969 --> 00:29:33.829
two big arguments. The first one is If we

394
00:29:33.829 --> 00:29:38.209
raise taxes on you, And you threatened to take

395
00:29:38.209 --> 00:29:44.739
your business, your factory, your office, your store. Away,

396
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.260
we will seize your business, and you won't have

397
00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:53.310
one anymore. So, before you do anything else, you

398
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:57.170
think carefully about what we know who you are,

399
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.910
we have your records, we know where your factory

400
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:05.510
or your office is located. You leave here within

401
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.800
22 or 4 or 6 years after we raise

402
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.109
taxes, we seize your company and your assets. OK,

403
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:20.750
so, be careful. Now, #2, even more important. The

404
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:25.479
minute you leave. And we seize your assets, we

405
00:30:25.479 --> 00:30:30.619
will convert your business from a capitalist enterprise into

406
00:30:30.619 --> 00:30:35.959
a worker co op. The jobs will be retained.

407
00:30:36.329 --> 00:30:40.560
Nobody will go unemployed because this business will continue.

408
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.930
The only difference is it won't be yours anymore.

409
00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:48.420
It will belong to the collective of workers. By

410
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.140
the way, this happened in Argentina. You may know

411
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.319
the story some years ago when the capitalists left

412
00:30:54.579 --> 00:30:56.819
and the workers took over. Well, here it would

413
00:30:56.819 --> 00:31:00.459
be assisted, and how will the government function? The

414
00:31:00.459 --> 00:31:04.979
government will say, we will help the transition from

415
00:31:04.979 --> 00:31:09.430
a capitalist to a worker co op. And we

416
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.939
will also help finance the worker co op to

417
00:31:12.939 --> 00:31:16.579
get it through the transition from a capitalist to

418
00:31:16.579 --> 00:31:21.459
a worker co op. And finally, and finally, we

419
00:31:21.459 --> 00:31:28.290
will lead a movement across this country. Urging our

420
00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:34.910
citizens. Please buy the products of X, the worker

421
00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:39.869
co op, because that will preserve the jobs of

422
00:31:39.869 --> 00:31:45.729
these people. It will preserve the economic viability of

423
00:31:45.729 --> 00:31:50.260
our community. And it will punish the people who

424
00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:54.219
refused to pay their fair share of taxes and

425
00:31:54.219 --> 00:31:58.459
threatened to shut their industries and hurt all of

426
00:31:58.459 --> 00:32:04.260
us. If you want that publicity about yourself, go

427
00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:10.060
ahead, try it. You will regret the day you

428
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:13.719
thought of this. By the way, I have been,

429
00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.189
just so you know, I have been in a

430
00:32:16.189 --> 00:32:20.199
position to make speeches like what I just told

431
00:32:20.199 --> 00:32:27.319
you. TO groups of workers. Mhm. They began laughing.

432
00:32:28.619 --> 00:32:33.560
Because for the first time instead of feeling frightened

433
00:32:33.859 --> 00:32:37.489
by the threat we can't tax the rich, they

434
00:32:37.489 --> 00:32:44.040
began to understand. That when the employer threatens you.

435
00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:48.349
You have a a threat you can give back

436
00:32:48.349 --> 00:32:53.290
to the employer. You don't have to crawl away

437
00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:58.050
feeling defeated. You make a counterthreat. You threaten us

438
00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.489
by not paying your taxes or closing your business.

439
00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:05.530
We'll take over your business. Keep it open, only

440
00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:08.410
it will now be a worker co op celebrated

441
00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:10.640
by the government, and you will have lost everything.

442
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:15.750
You wanna play games, you wanna make threats, there's

443
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:21.160
the workers began clapping. The idea had never been

444
00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.719
presented to them before, but all I'm doing when

445
00:33:24.719 --> 00:33:28.630
I tell workers that. IS I'm bringing to workers

446
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:33.550
an awareness of the power they always had. They

447
00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.390
just have to know how to use it.

448
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:43.020
So, let me ask you now, is it possible

449
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:49.199
for anyone to become rich without exploiting the labor

450
00:33:49.199 --> 00:33:52.640
of others, at least to some extent,

451
00:33:53.219 --> 00:33:55.780
if we allow it, that's a question for every

452
00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:58.839
society to decide. Let me give you an example.

453
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:06.869
Let's suppose um a person invents something new. Let's

454
00:34:06.869 --> 00:34:10.550
take uh Elon Musk. Let's give him the credit,

455
00:34:10.668 --> 00:34:12.629
by the way, he doesn't deserve it, but let's

456
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:17.188
give him the credit of having invented the electric-powered

457
00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:22.429
automobile, OK? And let's say that we in society

458
00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:27.668
believe that he should be given a nice reward

459
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:31.649
for having invented something that is useful to the

460
00:34:31.649 --> 00:34:35.418
human race. So we don't have to burn oil

461
00:34:35.418 --> 00:34:38.599
and gas, and we can have electricity, and it's,

462
00:34:39.099 --> 00:34:43.188
it, it, it's better for our health. And we

463
00:34:43.188 --> 00:34:45.850
will make a decision. We're going to give him

464
00:34:46.188 --> 00:34:48.830
a big chunk of money. We're going to make

465
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:52.168
him a rich person, so we could give him,

466
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:59.510
let's say, $10 million. Wow, that's really nice. Or

467
00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.510
maybe we have a debate and we decide, let's

468
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.290
be even more generous, we're going to give him

469
00:35:05.629 --> 00:35:13.280
$20 million. OK. Now, we make a factory which

470
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:18.270
makes electric cars. There's no need for him to

471
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:24.120
be the boss of that factory. None Many other

472
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.320
people can do it. You know how I know

473
00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.959
that? Many other people are doing it now. He

474
00:35:28.959 --> 00:35:32.320
doesn't preside in his factory. He hasn't even gone

475
00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.469
into that factory. But 6 times in the last

476
00:35:36.469 --> 00:35:40.110
10 years, and then with photographers because it's a

477
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:45.149
public relations event. There's no need for him to

478
00:35:45.149 --> 00:35:50.169
be owning shares of stock. That's a social invention.

479
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.929
So the answer is, yeah, we could make Mr.

480
00:35:53.709 --> 00:36:00.360
Elon Musk reasonably rich. But then we could have

481
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.610
the benefits of what he has done with the

482
00:36:05.399 --> 00:36:09.820
of shared across the whole society. You know, if

483
00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.020
Mr. Musk were here, and if he were honest,

484
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.300
he's not here, and I, I don't know if

485
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.300
he's honest or not, but if he were honest,

486
00:36:18.419 --> 00:36:22.850
he would admit. That his invention was the last

487
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:27.229
in a long line. People had invented electricity long

488
00:36:27.229 --> 00:36:30.550
before him and batteries long before him, and the

489
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:35.229
automobile long before him, the people whose ingenuity give

490
00:36:35.229 --> 00:36:40.030
us the electric car. ARE not just Elon Musk,

491
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:43.209
he's the latest in a long chain. If you

492
00:36:43.209 --> 00:36:49.090
wanted to really honor all the people responsible for

493
00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:52.090
the electric car, you'd have to go back in

494
00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:57.830
history for 200 years of people who made contributions.

495
00:36:59.149 --> 00:37:01.760
You know, I give an example to my students

496
00:37:01.949 --> 00:37:05.709
that may help you understand this. Suppose there's a

497
00:37:05.709 --> 00:37:09.070
flood in your community, the river rises and the

498
00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:13.469
water, so everybody stops what they're doing and they

499
00:37:13.469 --> 00:37:17.229
make a line with sandbags. And so the first

500
00:37:17.229 --> 00:37:19.709
person gets a sandbag, hands it to the next

501
00:37:19.709 --> 00:37:22.270
person, to the next person, to the next, until

502
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:24.070
they get to the, to the man or the

503
00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:26.810
woman right by the river who puts it there.

504
00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.139
And finally, you put up enough, and the river

505
00:37:30.139 --> 00:37:35.820
is held back, and the grateful community raises $10,000.

506
00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:40.709
Because of the gratitude for the people who stood

507
00:37:40.709 --> 00:37:44.590
there for hours with the sandbags, and they take

508
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:48.070
the $10,000 and they give it to the last

509
00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:52.879
person standing next to the river. But that's crazy.

510
00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.699
All of the people, every one of them did

511
00:37:56.699 --> 00:37:59.610
the same thing. Why are you giving it to

512
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:03.820
the last? Everybody should share in it. And if

513
00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.580
the last person standing there is an honest person,

514
00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.580
that's what they would want too. Imagine what kind

515
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:17.280
of a person snatches the $10,000 the community's gratitude,

516
00:38:17.379 --> 00:38:21.750
and runs away and keeps it for himself. That's

517
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:26.790
immoral. Mr. Musk is immoral to have that kind

518
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:32.409
of wealth. Remember, if Mr. Musk has 3 or

519
00:38:32.409 --> 00:38:37.629
$400 billion that means he decides what to do

520
00:38:37.629 --> 00:38:41.449
with that. Not all the people in the community.

521
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:45.739
Many of whom keep this community going, they don't.

522
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:52.169
He alone. Makes that decision. That's not democratic, and

523
00:38:52.169 --> 00:38:57.389
there's no notion of democracy that could ever justify

524
00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:01.790
that level. Of power in the hands of one

525
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:05.879
person relative to the power in the hands of

526
00:39:05.879 --> 00:39:06.699
everybody else.

527
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.879
OK, so let me then just ask you one

528
00:39:10.879 --> 00:39:14.080
last question because I'm also getting mindful of your

529
00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.080
time here, Doctor Wolf. Thank you. Do you, do

530
00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:22.399
you think that billionaires should exist? I mean, should

531
00:39:22.399 --> 00:39:26.850
we allow billionaires to exist because It is such

532
00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:31.550
an absurd, a ridiculous amount of wealth that even

533
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:34.909
if you do the calculations as to how long

534
00:39:34.909 --> 00:39:37.570
it would take for a person who earns minimum

535
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:42.030
wage or even the the median wage to become

536
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:47.030
a billionaire. I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous. I mean,

537
00:39:47.629 --> 00:39:53.014
should billionaires Exist, uh, does it make any sense

538
00:39:53.014 --> 00:39:55.695
for us to allow that to happen? Also, not

539
00:39:55.695 --> 00:39:57.804
only because of the huge amount of wealth, but

540
00:39:57.804 --> 00:40:02.735
also because of the power they can, uh, use

541
00:40:02.735 --> 00:40:04.485
that wealth to leverage,

542
00:40:04.774 --> 00:40:07.455
right? Well, uh, I, I was just gonna respond

543
00:40:07.455 --> 00:40:10.215
by mentioning that, so I'll make it very brief.

544
00:40:10.655 --> 00:40:15.379
If you allow billionaires. For example, we have about

545
00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:18.479
1000 billionaires, more or less here in the United

546
00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:22.320
States. So we have a population of 330 million

547
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:27.040
people and 1000 people have a billion dollars of

548
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.919
wealth or more, OK? So, it is a tiny,

549
00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:35.040
tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of the people, but with

550
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:41.120
those billions, they can buy the political system. Elon

551
00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:48.199
Musk gave Donald Trump 200+ million dollars for his

552
00:40:48.199 --> 00:40:52.300
campaign, and he wouldn't have won the presidency without

553
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:57.290
it. In other words, when you have billionaires, you

554
00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:00.030
are teaching people, whether you admit it to yourself

555
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.889
or not, that you are part of a tiny

556
00:41:02.889 --> 00:41:06.010
minority, and that the mass of people who don't

557
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.209
have a billion dollars, who don't even have a

558
00:41:09.209 --> 00:41:13.169
million dollars, the vast majority of Americans don't have

559
00:41:13.169 --> 00:41:15.370
anything like that kind of money. I'm talking about

560
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.530
$1 million not $1 billion let alone $1 trillion.

561
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:24.399
You're, you're vulnerable. The billionaires know how vulnerable they

562
00:41:24.399 --> 00:41:28.040
are, and that's why they buy the politicians. That's

563
00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:31.030
why they buy the think tanks. They want the

564
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:38.300
culture full of articles, books, movies, songs, everything imaginable.

565
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:43.709
To protect them against the possibility that the majority

566
00:41:43.709 --> 00:41:48.129
of people will one day say billionaires are not

567
00:41:48.129 --> 00:41:52.500
acceptable. And by the way, that will happen one

568
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.719
day, and then it will be over, and we

569
00:41:54.719 --> 00:41:58.939
will look back on this age. With incredulity, just

570
00:41:58.939 --> 00:42:02.110
like we look back now on ancient village economies,

571
00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:05.060
none of whom had billionaires or anything like it,

572
00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:08.709
so we don't need it. We never did. It's

573
00:42:08.709 --> 00:42:12.550
not necessary. We understand the power of those with

574
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.270
the money to use it to hold on to

575
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:18.310
their money, which they are smart enough to do.

576
00:42:19.979 --> 00:42:21.870
But I don't think we need them, not at

577
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:25.669
all. They are a burden on our society. When

578
00:42:25.669 --> 00:42:28.550
I think of the $1 trillion that are now

579
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:31.649
going to be given to Elon Musk, who's already

580
00:42:32.229 --> 00:42:36.959
got $300 billion. It's really hard not to get

581
00:42:36.959 --> 00:42:41.959
angry. Think how many people could be helped with

582
00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:46.100
$1 trillion over the next 10 years. You could

583
00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.479
do a long way to go back and rebuild

584
00:42:49.479 --> 00:42:53.659
Gaza. You could go back and help the worst

585
00:42:53.659 --> 00:42:57.020
famines in Africa. You could, you could help people

586
00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:01.010
in dramatic ways. $1 trillion is an enormous amount

587
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:06.550
of money, but instead, in this capitalist system, When

588
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:10.129
you know all the good $1 trillion could do,

589
00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:16.469
you're allowing a corporation to give that money to

590
00:43:16.469 --> 00:43:20.429
the person who already has more money than the

591
00:43:20.429 --> 00:43:25.149
rest of us. That's beyond immoral, that is so

592
00:43:25.149 --> 00:43:30.399
outrageous that I feel confident in predicting that when

593
00:43:30.399 --> 00:43:36.169
the social explosions come. One of their targets will

594
00:43:36.169 --> 00:43:38.510
be this situation.

595
00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.429
OK, so Doctor Wolf, let, let's wrap it up

596
00:43:44.429 --> 00:43:46.820
here. I know that you only have uh just

597
00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:49.469
a few, a couple of minutes left, so thank

598
00:43:49.469 --> 00:43:51.629

on the show again. And of course I will

be leaving links to your books and particularly understanding

601
00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:00.310
capitalism, which I think is the latest one, and
