00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:03.410
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.369
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez, and

3
00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:09.449
today I'm joined by a return guest, Doctor Nicole

4
00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:15.000
Prozzi. Last time we talked about so-called porn addiction

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.655
and also topics related to sex, sexual. Relationships and

6
00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:23.454
today we're going to talk just a little bit

7
00:00:23.454 --> 00:00:28.225
more about porn addiction and pornography, arousal in the

8
00:00:28.225 --> 00:00:31.944
brain, the no fab movement or no fab groups

9
00:00:31.944 --> 00:00:35.384
and some other related topics. So, Doctor Prazi, welcome

10
00:00:35.384 --> 00:00:37.465
back to the show. It's always a pleasure to

11
00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:37.764
everyone.

12
00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.104
Oh, thank you for having me back. I've been

13
00:00:40.104 --> 00:00:41.654
following the show. Looks like you've got some great

14
00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:42.224
folks on.

15
00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:46.500
Great, thank you. So, let me start by asking

16
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.250
you because this is something that, that last time

17
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.889
when we talked about pornography, we didn't really address

18
00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:57.150
a very specific question. Would you say that pornography

19
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.270
is a super stimulus because I hear that from

20
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.349
many people.

21
00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:06.699
Super stimulus actually has a really specific scientific meaning

22
00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:11.260
that porn does not meet. So, the, generally, it's

23
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.059
referring to something that has enhanced features beyond uh

24
00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:18.699
naturally occurring stimulus. Yeah, it's often studied in the

25
00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:21.809
animal kingdom and various, it's not just sexual necessarily,

26
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.650
but any, anything that's kind of above and beyond

27
00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.569
uh what normally or naturally occurs with the stimulus.

28
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.980
And porn just doesn't come close to sex or

29
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.989
masturbation for that matter. Uh, THAT is when we

30
00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:39.949
show people pornography in the lab and then have

31
00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:42.870
them direct with the partner, the second there's partner

32
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.790
touch, uh, the responses are much higher. So part

33
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.349
of the argument for a super stimulus is, it's

34
00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:52.910
stimulating beyond, uh, what's already given or what normally

35
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.150
occurs, and that's just clearly not the case with

36
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.190
pornography. It doesn't hold a candle to touch.

37
00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:01.059
Yeah. Oh, by the way, let me ask you

38
00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:04.660
more about that. And since you're a neuroscientist, are

39
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.619
there studies comparing people just watching pornography, just watching

40
00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.660
it with, without doing anything with no masturbation and

41
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.809
uh people masturbating and having sex?

42
00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.229
Almost all of the studies about sexual arousal are

43
00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:27.589
just showing pornography where touching is not allowed, or

44
00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:29.229
at least we instruct them not to do that.

45
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.750
We don't necessarily watch and check, but we tell

46
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.149
them not to. I think we have the only

47
00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:36.830
data where we actually have pornography viewing in the

48
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.350
same study as where people had partnered touch. But

49
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.990
even then, you can imagine like studying sex in

50
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.229
the lab is hard because you can't just say

51
00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.149
go have sex, like what does that mean? It's

52
00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:50.699
very different for every person. So in our case,

53
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.970
when we say sex, it's actually just genital stroking

54
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.300
and just of uh female clitoris. So, uh it's

55
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.740
not sex in the general sense, but that's kind

56
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.899
of the most we have in the lab, and

57
00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.500
that would be our study and that's uh partnered

58
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.899
touch compared to pornography.

59
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.509
But are there enough studies to establish a comparison

60
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:15.300
there, or?

61
00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.020
We need far more in that space, and they're

62
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.339
very, very hard to come by because the constraints,

63
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.869
especially in the US around what we're allowed to

64
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:28.470
do in the laboratory are, uh, I would say

65
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.350
unnecessary. That is the, the barriers to get it

66
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.669
done, um, in part because the protocols don't really

67
00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.149
exist yet, that's part of why we're trying to

68
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:40.610
do the work. Um, SO it's like how do

69
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.320
you argue that you should be allowed to do

70
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.119
something and it's not been done before, um, but

71
00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:49.580
also, uh, some just puritanical constraints. So for example,

72
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.880
labs in the US are sometimes restricted from using

73
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.050
freshmen, but sophomores are OK because somehow there's some

74
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.839
imagined big transition between, you know, being an 18

75
00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.869
year old at college and a nineteen-year-old at college

76
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.520
for viewing consensual adult pornography and some of our

77
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.389
protocols, so. Uh, EXAMPLES like that are abundant in

78
00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.910
the states of just weird constraints on protocols that

79
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.740
don't really make a lot of sense sometimes.

80
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.160
But from the studies we have, what can we

81
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.929
tell? I mean, is pornography really as arousing as

82
00:04:23.929 --> 00:04:26.510
masturbation or sex?

83
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.350
So that's a remarkable shift. The limited studies we

84
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.160
have which are from our lab as far as

85
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.390
I know. The second someone switches from doing pornography

86
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.910
to touching themselves, the response magnitude is not remotely

87
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.059
close. That's, um, to argue that it's a super

88
00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:49.500
stimulus, like it stimulates beyond what's kind of available

89
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.940
from an actual sexual interaction. It's, it's just not

90
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.790
close, it's not comparable. I think that people who

91
00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.489
use super stimulus are Uh, generously uninformed and more

92
00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:03.170
often motivated. They're trying to make claims, they're trying

93
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.929
to create litigation or uh laws against things they

94
00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:07.519
don't like.

95
00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:13.079
So the response is much more pronounced during masturbation

96
00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:16.380
and I would imagine even more pronounced during sex.

97
00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:18.890
Yeah, we don't have a lot of data comparing

98
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.730
all of those in the same protocol, which is

99
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.809
really what you need, but the data we do

100
00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:26.609
have, it's, it's so, uh, the effect sizes are

101
00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:29.920
so large. I feel comfortable saying it's probably replicable.

102
00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:36.910
OK. Does watching more pornography or watching pornography regularly

103
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.779
dampens arousal during arousal response during sex?

104
00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:45.760
There's no evidence that occurs from a scientific standpoint.

105
00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:48.510
If you ask people directly if that occurs, some

106
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.350
people will say they've experienced that. But then when

107
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.880
scientists have gone in and tried to document that

108
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.880
effect, uh, they aren't able to find it. So

109
00:05:57.119 --> 00:05:59.279
even from the people who say they have had

110
00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.480
these negative effects from it, and what that raises

111
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.480
is more likely people who are seeking this kind

112
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.799
of stimulation now probably had some or uh it's

113
00:06:09.799 --> 00:06:12.820
as likely that they had some brain difference beforehand.

114
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.220
So, for example, we see people Who have, uh,

115
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.859
who are more sensitive to impulsive behaviors when they're

116
00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:23.619
younger, uh, ultimately engage in more sexual behaviors as

117
00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:26.649
they get older. I would say, you know, they,

118
00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:30.660
uh, they didn't have, uh, sex interactions that caused

119
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.519
the brain to do this. It's like, no, their

120
00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:35.540
brain was kind of already sensitized that direction and

121
00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:37.899
we see some of those differences at birth. I

122
00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:39.980
mean, these are an infants who couldn't have possibly

123
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.279
had, you know, those experiences yet. People are born

124
00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.440
with predispositions, and that's reflected in brain activity.

125
00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:51.690
Right, but does the brain, I mean, I'm not

126
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.029
sure what would that mean in terms of neuroscience,

127
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.850
but does the brain distinguish between masturbation and actual

128
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.700
intercourse?

129
00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:05.100
Uh, SO it does in some ways, and there

130
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.630
are a lot of ways we probably just don't

131
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.529
know about cause it's not well studied. And the,

132
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.700
the main part that's not well studied is partnered

133
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.470
interaction, but also masturbation hasn't been widely studied either.

134
00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:19.410
Uh, SO what we have, for example, there's a

135
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.769
difference when another hand is touching your body and

136
00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:25.589
rubbing at a certain frequency that activates the afferent

137
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:28.529
fibers that are unique to partner stimulation. You can't

138
00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:32.440
do it to yourself. Uh, THERE'S the psychological aspect

139
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.609
of feeling wanted, that's unique to partnered interactions that

140
00:07:35.609 --> 00:07:39.049
you don't experience when you're interacting with yourself, by

141
00:07:39.049 --> 00:07:42.480
definition. So, I think there are some very unique

142
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.359
features that um make me think uh we're likely

143
00:07:46.359 --> 00:07:48.720
to continue to discover some of the distinctions between

144
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.549
those things.

145
00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:54.519
Mhm. So another question about pornography specifically because this

146
00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:58.799
is something that sometimes we hear from uh pornography,

147
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.959
the tractors. This pornography have any effect in the

148
00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:06.649
kinds of scripts people follow during sex?

149
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.380
Uh, THAT is also kind of a cause effect

150
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.010
issue. Uh, PEOPLE definitely are more likely to view

151
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.049
pornography that is consistent with the behaviors they're engaging

152
00:08:18.049 --> 00:08:21.290
in. And so the question is, again, like, did

153
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.130
they already kind of have a latent interest, um,

154
00:08:24.489 --> 00:08:27.500
or did they already have the behavior uh and

155
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.239
did pornography release it or cause them to discover

156
00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:33.729
it? Like what's the exact role? And those are

157
00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:36.200
really difficult to parse. So it's like if I

158
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.500
was kind of interested in Uh, bondage and domination

159
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.260
con um, issues in general. And then I view

160
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.219
a sexual film that has a specific, uh, bondage

161
00:08:47.219 --> 00:08:49.020
or domination behavior that I was like, oh, that

162
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.659
one, like I really like that one and now

163
00:08:50.659 --> 00:08:53.859
I'm gonna go try it. I'd say, well, OK,

164
00:08:53.909 --> 00:08:56.359
but there was a latent interest, but the porn

165
00:08:56.359 --> 00:08:59.380
actual behavior was novel. So where do we say

166
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.780
in that case? Like, was it the person or

167
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.549
was it the um the actual content they viewed?

168
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.940
So there it is absolutely the case that the

169
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.539
scripts people tend to view in porn tend to

170
00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:12.580
be more likely to reflect the behaviors they do

171
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.929
engage in, but it's not at all clear that

172
00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:18.419
that was causative, that they saw the porn and

173
00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:20.419
for the first time ever in their life, they

174
00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:22.289
start to think about doing this new thing.

175
00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.080
Right. And I mean, another thing that sometimes we

176
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.510
hear from people who detract porn is that If,

177
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.039
if people watch porn or if they watch it

178
00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:38.679
regularly, I mean, the kind of specific accusation varies

179
00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:41.760
from person to person, I guess, but if they

180
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.039
watch porn, then they can no longer or uh

181
00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:48.690
from a. Certain point on where they can no

182
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.309
longer have normal sex. I mean, they, they don't

183
00:09:53.309 --> 00:09:56.789
feel stimulated the same way. They're not able to

184
00:09:56.789 --> 00:09:59.229
get an erection, something like that. I mean, is

185
00:09:59.229 --> 00:10:01.309
there anything to that claim or

186
00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:04.909
not? If you ask people directly, they definitely make

187
00:10:04.909 --> 00:10:07.429
those claims and that is documented like uh there

188
00:10:07.429 --> 00:10:10.280
are surveys where people said, did porn do this

189
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.270
to you and yes, porn did this to me.

190
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.969
Uh, SO people definitely have that belief. I've heard

191
00:10:14.969 --> 00:10:17.520
that as well. Um, HOWEVER, there have now been

192
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.679
a series of studies investigating this, a number of

193
00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:23.489
mine as well, and we don't find evidence to

194
00:10:23.489 --> 00:10:26.429
support that. So, for example, uh, we looked at

195
00:10:26.429 --> 00:10:29.760
people in the laboratory, uh, actually measured their penile

196
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.299
responses to sexual stimuli, so. You know, if they

197
00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:38.450
have this inhibition or if they've been decommissioned uh

198
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.590
by viewing intense stimuli, they should be less responsive

199
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.729
if they viewed more erotica in their day to

200
00:10:43.729 --> 00:10:46.450
day life, uh, we found the opposite. Uh, THAT

201
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.210
is they tend to be more sensitive, that shouldn't

202
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:53.919
happen if it's desensitizing. Uh, SIMILARLY, if we, uh,

203
00:10:53.929 --> 00:10:56.760
follow people. And say, OK, you know, if you've

204
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.359
had this interaction with films in the past, you

205
00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:00.919
know, how do you interact with a partner in

206
00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:03.570
the laboratory, you should say, Um, I'm not as

207
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.450
aroused, I'm not as excited. It's the opposite, that

208
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.489
is people who have more real life experience being

209
00:11:08.489 --> 00:11:11.369
pornography report being more excited to interact with a

210
00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:13.809
real life partner. So we think these are likely

211
00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:17.450
just proxies for sexual interest. Uh, THAT doesn't mean

212
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.289
though that someone who views a lot of erotica

213
00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:21.809
might have a lot of sexual anxiety and anxiety

214
00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:25.919
is a well-known, good predictor of erectile dysfunction. So,

215
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.940
Uh, in general, I say if, you know, someone

216
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.369
thinks that may be linked, it's much, much more

217
00:11:31.369 --> 00:11:35.020
likely that there's an anxiety issue that's not just

218
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.859
pornography related. You know, you had some experience that

219
00:11:37.859 --> 00:11:40.340
made you nervous and it's hard to get out

220
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.460
of your head, you know, to not think about

221
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.179
it the next time.

222
00:11:44.309 --> 00:11:48.429
But that anxiety, does it go attached to, for

223
00:11:48.429 --> 00:11:51.030
example, in the case of men, the fact that

224
00:11:51.469 --> 00:11:54.390
they might be afraid that they will not be

225
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.549
able to perform like the men they see in

226
00:11:57.549 --> 00:12:01.575
pornography or perhaps they don't have. Uh, THE same

227
00:12:01.575 --> 00:12:08.645
kind of, uh, penile length as the muscularity,

228
00:12:09.184 --> 00:12:12.775
yeah, attractive partners. So in general, there seems to

229
00:12:12.775 --> 00:12:14.695
have been a shift over time. There was more

230
00:12:14.695 --> 00:12:19.135
documentation of those kind of, um, fears related to

231
00:12:19.135 --> 00:12:23.539
body presentation. Uh, 20 years ago in science, and

232
00:12:23.539 --> 00:12:26.130
what I think has happened is like we don't

233
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.359
see that documented consistently anymore. Studies sometimes don't find

234
00:12:29.359 --> 00:12:31.729
it, they sometimes find the opposite. Like people who

235
00:12:31.729 --> 00:12:33.770
be more poor and feel better about their bodies,

236
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.849
and like that shouldn't happen. Like, if that's the

237
00:12:36.849 --> 00:12:39.690
case. And what I think has occurred is in

238
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.929
the past, there were a few houses that kind

239
00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.849
of selected the actresses selected the actors. You only

240
00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:49.369
saw a few that were really, you know, recycled

241
00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:53.039
in a lot of films. And now with OnlyFans

242
00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:56.799
and the explosion of access to these erotic online

243
00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:59.239
content, if you have a small penis, you can

244
00:12:59.239 --> 00:13:01.320
go online and you see someone else aroused by

245
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.109
a small penis just like yours. So I think

246
00:13:05.109 --> 00:13:09.150
because the bodies and content have democratized, they really

247
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.809
become very diverse and it allows you now, uh,

248
00:13:12.909 --> 00:13:16.059
I think, to not have necessarily that effect of

249
00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:18.030
like, oh, you know, I'm too big, I'm too

250
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.570
small, I'm too, you know, all these, uh, natural

251
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.070
concerns a lot of folks have to say like,

252
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.900
no, I saw my body on screen and somebody

253
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.630
was very turned on by it. And that wasn't

254
00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.229
happening in pornography 2030 years ago, I think.

255
00:13:33.099 --> 00:13:37.159
So nowadays you get more variety in terms of

256
00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:37.630
body type,

257
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.640
yeah. I don't think there's a lot of debate

258
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.150
about that.

259
00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:45.369
Yeah, and I guess that, that would also work

260
00:13:45.369 --> 00:13:50.760
for anxiety in women, right? Because, I mean, uh,

261
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.809
now you also, we also have more variety for

262
00:13:55.809 --> 00:13:58.619
the women themselves, right, in terms of body type.

263
00:13:58.809 --> 00:13:58.929
Yeah,

264
00:13:59.049 --> 00:14:01.210
and I think we see that in larger media

265
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.929
studies as well. I don't do communications research per

266
00:14:03.929 --> 00:14:06.000
se, but when I read those kind of things,

267
00:14:06.049 --> 00:14:09.049
I'll talk about like the representation and that. It

268
00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:12.789
really spans everything from, you know, swimsuit issues, and

269
00:14:12.789 --> 00:14:16.530
Sports Illustrated, having larger bodies, and, uh, just a

270
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.919
broader representation of like what an attractive body is.

271
00:14:20.169 --> 00:14:23.059
And I think that's useful, you know, it's, uh,

272
00:14:23.289 --> 00:14:25.250
most people when they're viewing pornography, they're viewing it

273
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.500
10 minutes-ish, you know, like it's as far as

274
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.729
what we consume, we see a lot more television,

275
00:14:30.789 --> 00:14:33.859
a lot more. Uh, KIND of print walking around

276
00:14:33.859 --> 00:14:38.570
during our, uh, scrolling efforts, uh, than actual pornographic

277
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.099
content. So I don't think these are necessarily like

278
00:14:41.099 --> 00:14:43.659
unique to pornography, but it may reflect kind of

279
00:14:43.659 --> 00:14:47.020
that broader societal broader representation.

280
00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:51.960
Mhm. Do we know what are the personality traits

281
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.479
of people who watch more porn? I mean, is

282
00:14:55.479 --> 00:14:59.400
there anything in their personality that predisposes them to

283
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.520
watching it more?

284
00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:05.080
And a few folks have done studies of just

285
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.159
viewing, so not like reported problems viewing necessarily, and

286
00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.070
it tends to be exactly what you would think,

287
00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:14.080
that is people who tend to be more rewards

288
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.700
seeking in a variety of areas, so. They don't

289
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.659
just be more porn, they're also more likely to

290
00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:21.979
say, I enjoy swinging. I like an open relationship.

291
00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:25.530
I do cuckolding. I am engaged in BDSM, so,

292
00:15:25.539 --> 00:15:27.619
uh, we call it sexual breath, so that is

293
00:15:27.619 --> 00:15:29.390
they tend to engage in a lot of other,

294
00:15:29.619 --> 00:15:33.530
uh, sexual behaviors, not just the porn viewing, and,

295
00:15:33.619 --> 00:15:36.859
uh, outside of that, like personalologically speaking, uh, they

296
00:15:36.859 --> 00:15:38.820
tend to be more impulsive, so that doesn't mean

297
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.780
if you view porn you are impulsive, but there's

298
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.719
a tendency. So these tend to be pleasure-seeking people,

299
00:15:44.849 --> 00:15:47.090
you know, like this is, uh, I'm gonna go

300
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.820
jump out of an airplane. I'm gonna, you know,

301
00:15:50.409 --> 00:15:52.849
I was gonna say streaking. I don't know any

302
00:15:52.849 --> 00:15:54.729
data to support that, but it's the behavior that

303
00:15:54.729 --> 00:15:57.650
came to mind. Jet skis, you know, these are

304
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.900
folks who like those kind of things who the

305
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.049
Novel, pleasure, excitement, uh, generally is appealing to them

306
00:16:05.049 --> 00:16:06.250
in other aspects of their life.

307
00:16:07.489 --> 00:16:11.140
Right, right. And I would imagine they would, they

308
00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:17.450
would score higher on socio sexuality or

309
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.690
Oh, undoubtedly, yeah, I was like I haven't looked

310
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.289
at those uh studies recently, but I can't imagine

311
00:16:23.289 --> 00:16:24.419
that's not a strong correlate.

312
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.859
Yeah. So, uh, and who are the people who

313
00:16:28.859 --> 00:16:33.140
condemn pornography the most? We, last time we talked

314
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.859
a little bit about the people who identify as

315
00:16:35.859 --> 00:16:38.500
porn addicts, and I will have a couple more

316
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.419
questions about that for you, but who are the

317
00:16:41.419 --> 00:16:44.250
ones who tend to condemn porn the most?

318
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.849
There were some interesting papers written a while back

319
00:16:47.849 --> 00:16:49.609
about two groups that were kind of collaborating to

320
00:16:49.609 --> 00:16:52.289
oppose pornography, at least in the states, that was,

321
00:16:52.739 --> 00:16:55.580
uh, religious groups and anti-porn feminists. So there's a

322
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.219
split within the feminist community. Some see porn as

323
00:16:58.219 --> 00:17:01.820
empowering, uh, useful for women, others think it's degrading

324
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.569
always or, or it is abuse at all times.

325
00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.868
So those feminists actually work with religious groups, which

326
00:17:07.868 --> 00:17:11.479
is very unusual. Usually feminists don't find companions and

327
00:17:11.479 --> 00:17:14.108
uh shared values with religious groups, but they do

328
00:17:14.108 --> 00:17:16.630
in this case. The third group that's come in

329
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.900
that I think is really shifting some of this

330
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.390
is manosphere groups. So these are folks who are

331
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.630
making money off of the claims that pornography is

332
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.500
bad for you. So they say, you know, every

333
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.019
time you view, it hurts your brain. Pay me,

334
00:17:29.098 --> 00:17:31.859
I'll help you stop. Pay me, I'll reduce your

335
00:17:31.859 --> 00:17:35.538
urges. And so they've uh actually started partnering with

336
00:17:35.538 --> 00:17:38.458
these other two groups, uh, creating a weird, cause

337
00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:40.979
now these are clearly for-profit. That's why they're there,

338
00:17:41.098 --> 00:17:43.359
that's why they exist. Uh, THEY make a lot

339
00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:45.818
of other claims, but that these are all for-profit

340
00:17:45.818 --> 00:17:49.178
entities. And so now they've created this group where

341
00:17:49.178 --> 00:17:53.418
there's religious anti-porn feminists and kind of manosphere for-profit

342
00:17:53.418 --> 00:17:56.389
businesses, all kind of opposing pornography.

343
00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.839
Are these the same people who tend to believe

344
00:18:00.839 --> 00:18:05.599
in porn addiction or tend to identify themselves as

345
00:18:05.599 --> 00:18:07.229
porn addicts or not?

346
00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.449
Uh, I don't think in the first two cases

347
00:18:10.449 --> 00:18:13.489
necessarily, but the manosphere groups, absolutely, they tend to

348
00:18:13.489 --> 00:18:15.969
be made up of coaches and their main claim

349
00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:19.410
to expertise is usually personal experience. So they don't

350
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.979
hold any licensure typically, they don't have any training,

351
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.489
relevant training, but they'll say, I personally was harmed

352
00:18:25.489 --> 00:18:28.729
by pornography, pay me and I'll help you stop

353
00:18:28.729 --> 00:18:29.209
viewing too.

354
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.459
Mhm. So last time when we talked about what

355
00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:37.310
predicts identifying as a porn addict, uh, I don't

356
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:41.170
think we touched on the topic of narcissism. Could

357
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.619
you tell us about that?

358
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.010
That's a really interesting one. There was a history

359
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.489
of research on kind of pornography and people who

360
00:18:48.489 --> 00:18:51.880
think they're addicted, uh, suggesting that they often have

361
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.290
a moral conflict, that's they're raised in a conservative

362
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.329
household, possibly due to religion, but, you know, any

363
00:18:57.329 --> 00:19:00.810
conservative household, and so any porn viewing to them

364
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.770
was viewed as horrible and so I must be

365
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.329
addicted. But now there have been a couple of

366
00:19:05.329 --> 00:19:09.250
us, um, scientists in different studies independently, where we

367
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.699
find narcissism was a better predictor than moral conflict.

368
00:19:13.239 --> 00:19:15.760
And so the way that seems to be manifesting

369
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.609
is all these bad things that happened to me

370
00:19:17.609 --> 00:19:19.530
in my life, you know, I'm having trouble in

371
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.439
school, I can't get a girlfriend, I, all these,

372
00:19:22.449 --> 00:19:26.650
uh, negative outcomes. It's all because of porn. Porn

373
00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.800
did this to me. How dare they do this

374
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.599
to me, you know, and that's a very narcissistic

375
00:19:31.599 --> 00:19:33.890
kind of I'm a victim. I do no wrong.

376
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.459
Uh, AND it prohibits, I mean we can get

377
00:19:36.459 --> 00:19:37.760
into this more, but I think in part it

378
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.400
prohibited the self-reflection. It's like, what do I have

379
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.359
control over that I can help myself get a

380
00:19:43.359 --> 00:19:46.000
girlfriend, help myself do better in school cause it's

381
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.239
a very victim mindset, you know, it's like, I,

382
00:19:48.359 --> 00:19:51.390
I clearly didn't do anything wrong cause I'm amazing.

383
00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.400
So, you know, what did, what is porn done

384
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.079
to me, uh, done to my brain?

385
00:19:56.829 --> 00:20:00.900
Yeah, that's very interesting. So another thing that also

386
00:20:01.349 --> 00:20:04.949
links to neuroscience in a way, and sometimes I

387
00:20:04.949 --> 00:20:10.109
also, I've also heard from people who oppose pornography

388
00:20:10.109 --> 00:20:13.750
and even some who are part of the no-fa

389
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.310
movement and we're going to get into that in

390
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:21.219
a bit, is that um The the uh the

391
00:20:21.219 --> 00:20:23.579
big issue has to do with the fact that

392
00:20:23.579 --> 00:20:27.739
pornography induces the release of dopamine and then they

393
00:20:27.739 --> 00:20:32.900
start talking about supposed dopamine addiction or and things

394
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.329
like that. I mean, is dopamine addictive at all?

395
00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.579
Dopamine is long villainized and seems to be a

396
00:20:41.579 --> 00:20:44.819
favorite of these coaches. And not just within the

397
00:20:44.819 --> 00:20:48.260
pornography space, incidentally, like there are now kind of

398
00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:53.459
cheesy books written about demonizing dopamine. Uh, DOPAMINE is

399
00:20:53.459 --> 00:20:56.979
involved in everything in our life, kind of from

400
00:20:56.979 --> 00:20:59.579
moment to moment, it's involved in coordinating smooth muscle

401
00:20:59.579 --> 00:21:02.800
movement. Things have nothing to do with that. Uh,

402
00:21:02.969 --> 00:21:06.260
IT'S often confounded. So, uh, if you see someone,

403
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.609
sometimes they'll refer to dopamine as a pleasure chemical.

404
00:21:08.689 --> 00:21:12.089
It was famously in a Nobel laureate effort shown

405
00:21:12.089 --> 00:21:16.010
not to be related, uh, or not underlying pleasure

406
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:19.930
experiences. It's really about motivation and so any motive

407
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:24.209
behavior has to do with dopamine. So dopamine is

408
00:21:24.209 --> 00:21:27.930
absolutely involved in addictions, but that's not unique. So

409
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.089
if you say like, oh, you know, porn provokes

410
00:21:30.089 --> 00:21:34.750
dopamine is like, Every motivated provokes dopamine, like it's,

411
00:21:35.069 --> 00:21:37.550
yes, if something is addictive, it does have to

412
00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:43.550
be involved, but that's not um A discriminatory element

413
00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.290
of addiction. It, it almost is the weakest argument

414
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.540
you could make. Oh, you know, dopamine's involved, so

415
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.699
it must be addictive like that, that means almost

416
00:21:51.699 --> 00:21:53.900
nothing, you know, it's, it's not a good argument.

417
00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:57.310
But I mean, uh, when we hear people talking

418
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:02.829
about so-called uh dopamine, uh uh so-called dopamine detox,

419
00:22:03.109 --> 00:22:04.660
does that make any sense?

420
00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.150
No, there have been a few uh limited studies

421
00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:10.680
kind of looking at this idea of dopamine detox,

422
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.630
like is that something that happens, uh, and as

423
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.630
best we can tell? Not really, no. So, can

424
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:22.239
you potentially sensitize yourself through anchoring exercises, that is,

425
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.969
Uh, like if you have a super bland environment,

426
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.969
and we can do these with animal studies where

427
00:22:27.969 --> 00:22:31.250
we create environments that are really deprived versus enriched

428
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:36.140
and uh you can absolutely see more reactivity, um.

429
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.930
To enriching environments that seems true for both the

430
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.369
animal models and in humans, but it's kind of

431
00:22:42.369 --> 00:22:44.250
like the degree to which you would need to

432
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.089
do that as a human. I don't think we

433
00:22:46.089 --> 00:22:48.329
can really replicate. This is like sitting in a

434
00:22:48.329 --> 00:22:52.449
room with nothing, you know, for extended periods. And

435
00:22:52.449 --> 00:22:55.520
the the detoxes I often see are like, you

436
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.969
know, put your phone aside for a week. That

437
00:22:57.969 --> 00:22:59.609
may not be a bad idea. I don't think

438
00:22:59.609 --> 00:23:02.859
it's gonna change your dopamine reactivity and, and there's

439
00:23:02.859 --> 00:23:04.050
not good evidence for that.

440
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:08.800
Mhm. So last time we talked about porn addiction,

441
00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:12.050
but what is it that in the scientific literature

442
00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:15.849
is called problematic porn use? What is that?

443
00:23:16.459 --> 00:23:19.989
I think of uh problematic porn uses, sometimes abbreviated

444
00:23:19.989 --> 00:23:24.550
PPU is very similar to television viewing that we

445
00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.790
worked on 40 years ago in science, that is,

446
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.040
uh, you can absolutely view enough television that it

447
00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.520
interferes with your life, it interferes with you accomplishing

448
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.520
other goals that you value in your life, it's

449
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.599
associated with obesity, um, we have a lot of

450
00:23:39.599 --> 00:23:43.439
programs helping youth view less television, um, and in

451
00:23:43.439 --> 00:23:47.390
those cases, we're saying. There's nothing crazy unique about

452
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.040
the TV, you know, it's like, uh, we initially,

453
00:23:51.079 --> 00:23:52.880
of course, had all kinds of crazy theories about

454
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.959
television, most of which have been cast aside. We

455
00:23:55.959 --> 00:23:57.660
see the same kind of thing with pornography now

456
00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.599
where people, oh gosh, you know, pornography has all

457
00:23:59.599 --> 00:24:04.280
these special powers. Probably not, um, but problematic pornography

458
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.199
is just look, you, you can absolutely spend too

459
00:24:06.199 --> 00:24:08.079
much time doing this. You can do it at

460
00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:10.469
the expense of stuff you should be doing instead.

461
00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.170
Uh, AND so, is there a way we can

462
00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.369
help you engage in things you value more? You

463
00:24:16.369 --> 00:24:17.729
know, can we shift the effort?

464
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.000
Yeah, but, uh, but in what ways is that

465
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.199
different from an addiction? I mean, I was just

466
00:24:24.199 --> 00:24:27.239
wondering because since you mentioned that it could get

467
00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:29.589
in the way of us doing what we have

468
00:24:29.589 --> 00:24:32.489
to do like work, for example, wouldn't that be

469
00:24:32.489 --> 00:24:35.280
a criterion for addiction

470
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.410
or? Yeah, so these lines where we're trying to

471
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:41.400
distinguish like, what's a problem behavior versus a pathology.

472
00:24:41.689 --> 00:24:44.569
So like any of us can have problem behaviors,

473
00:24:44.689 --> 00:24:46.369
stuff we should do less in our life, and

474
00:24:46.369 --> 00:24:48.069
that may include, like, if I train for a

475
00:24:48.069 --> 00:24:51.530
triathlon, uh, I may be super healthy, but my

476
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.614
wife is at home like, you're not. Providing for

477
00:24:54.614 --> 00:24:58.244
childcare, like you need to stop bike riding for

478
00:24:58.244 --> 00:25:01.375
5 hours on Saturday and provide care so I

479
00:25:01.375 --> 00:25:04.734
can do something for me too. So, uh, we

480
00:25:04.734 --> 00:25:07.614
wouldn't consider the triathlon training addictive, but we'd say

481
00:25:07.614 --> 00:25:10.454
like, look, it's clearly a problem in your context,

482
00:25:10.535 --> 00:25:13.494
like you need to reduce it. So to actually

483
00:25:13.494 --> 00:25:17.479
call it a pathology. Uh, WHEN you discover, uh,

484
00:25:17.489 --> 00:25:19.680
what kind of model of pathology it fits best,

485
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.520
and addiction was one that was explored early on,

486
00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.390
then you say, OK, for something to be an

487
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:27.010
addiction, what are the criteria for an addiction? And

488
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.609
there are different ideas about that, but there's one

489
00:25:29.609 --> 00:25:33.609
by, um, Bridge that's very popular, called an incentive

490
00:25:33.609 --> 00:25:37.089
salience theory of addiction, and it requires, uh, a

491
00:25:37.089 --> 00:25:39.449
number of different constraints, like all these things must

492
00:25:39.449 --> 00:25:40.910
be met for this thing to be called an

493
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:45.770
addiction. And pornography fails in multiple ways. So, um,

494
00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.550
you know, one is kind of the, uh, escalation

495
00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.819
over time. We see lots of studies failing to

496
00:25:50.819 --> 00:25:54.170
document escalation when they're longitudinal. Uh, THE other is

497
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.489
a shift, uh, from kind of a pleasure experience

498
00:25:57.489 --> 00:26:00.689
to a more compulsive use expense. Uh, AND to

499
00:26:00.689 --> 00:26:02.650
be fair, those are expensive studies. You have to

500
00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:04.890
follow people at the start of use over a

501
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.530
long period. We don't have those data, we don't

502
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:09.930
have any evidence that happens, and people who say

503
00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.010
they're addicted, they still have a pleasure experience and

504
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:15.410
we show them pornography. So, uh, it just fails

505
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.819
in a number of different ways to meet criteria

506
00:26:17.819 --> 00:26:20.630
for addiction, but that doesn't mean You can't do

507
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.099
it in a way that interferes with your life

508
00:26:22.099 --> 00:26:24.660
and somebody could help you like do that less.

509
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:31.030
Right, right. Do people who watch pornography have a

510
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.069
harder time pair bonding with someone?

511
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.890
Uh, SO there have been some associative studies where

512
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.060
they find, for example, people who view more pornography

513
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.099
are less likely to be in marriages, uh, less

514
00:26:44.099 --> 00:26:46.699
likely to have a desired sexual partner, like access

515
00:26:46.699 --> 00:26:50.819
to a partner. But to me, the argument is

516
00:26:50.819 --> 00:26:54.420
much stronger for reverse causality, that is, uh, if

517
00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.060
you don't have a partner and you wish you

518
00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.780
did, well, it's Friday night, you're lonely, like, I

519
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.489
think I'll masturbate, you know, I kind of have

520
00:27:01.489 --> 00:27:03.780
a sexual urge, got no one to spend it

521
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:08.479
on, you know, like. So, uh, to me, there's

522
00:27:08.479 --> 00:27:11.560
not good evidence that it's causative. That is, I

523
00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.329
view pornography. Therefore, I don't have a partner. Therefore,

524
00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.550
I failed to bond with my, uh, marriage partner.

525
00:27:19.959 --> 00:27:22.599
It really seems, uh, if anything, to be more

526
00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:24.359
evidence in the reverse, like in the, the case

527
00:27:24.359 --> 00:27:27.719
of marriage, we see this a lot where, uh,

528
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.040
so I'm also a, a couples therapist, although I

529
00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.790
don't see patients currently. And, uh, when people aren't

530
00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.189
agreeing in their desire, and we call it desire

531
00:27:37.189 --> 00:27:40.869
discrepancy, uh, what do you do? If you're married

532
00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:43.709
and your intention is to be, uh, with that

533
00:27:43.709 --> 00:27:46.030
just that partner, you don't have an open relationship.

534
00:27:46.469 --> 00:27:48.310
And one partner is like, I don't want sex

535
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:50.109
that much, you know, once a month is fine

536
00:27:50.109 --> 00:27:51.229
with me, and the other partner is like, I

537
00:27:51.229 --> 00:27:54.209
would really like sex 3 times a week. You're

538
00:27:54.209 --> 00:27:55.829
gonna masturbate more and you're kind of gonna be

539
00:27:55.829 --> 00:27:58.900
unhappy about it because you're like, I really wish,

540
00:27:58.989 --> 00:28:01.150
you know, my partner would have sex with me

541
00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:04.099
more often. Uh, AND I feel a little rejected

542
00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:06.189
and, uh, you know, a little less secure in

543
00:28:06.189 --> 00:28:08.530
myself. And I'm kind of pissed off because I

544
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:10.109
agreed to just have sex with them and now

545
00:28:10.109 --> 00:28:12.709
they're not having sex with me. So it, it

546
00:28:12.709 --> 00:28:15.619
absolutely makes sense that there's, um, there would be

547
00:28:15.619 --> 00:28:20.599
an apparent relationship between likes satisfaction. And porn viewing

548
00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:23.160
and masturbation, but I think it's really in the

549
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.180
reverse causality in most of those cases, if, if

550
00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:26.829
not all.

551
00:28:28.229 --> 00:28:30.760
Mhm. So, uh, tell us about the research you

552
00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.839
have done on no FA groups. So, I mean,

553
00:28:33.939 --> 00:28:37.040
what got you interested in that and how does

554
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.189
it link to the magnosphere?

555
00:28:40.209 --> 00:28:42.849
We study a lot of topics kind of around

556
00:28:42.849 --> 00:28:44.770
there and I saw a number of studies that

557
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:47.170
were qualitative in nature, that is they were interviewing

558
00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.699
people or they were kind of looking at uh

559
00:28:49.699 --> 00:28:52.530
posts in a general way in their forums for

560
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.810
NoFA. And so we wanted to do something quantitative

561
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.079
and actually talk to people who had experience there.

562
00:28:59.479 --> 00:29:02.050
So we started out doing a pre-registered survey, just

563
00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:05.170
an online survey, kind of a simple start to

564
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:09.000
look at what people's experiences had been. Um, WE

565
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.119
followed up with some systematic analysis, uh, quantifying the

566
00:29:13.119 --> 00:29:16.359
content of their forums, and so there had been

567
00:29:16.359 --> 00:29:18.640
kind of hints before from this qualitative work that

568
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.989
these groups were Uh, you know, claiming to save

569
00:29:21.989 --> 00:29:24.869
women, but then using them as objects to test

570
00:29:24.869 --> 00:29:28.099
their penis out and, uh, saying, you know, uh,

571
00:29:28.189 --> 00:29:29.550
kind of some of the same lines as pickup

572
00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.670
artists. You know, it's like, I need to get

573
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:34.310
laid, I need this, my body needs this. Women

574
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.869
owe me this kind of language. Um, BUT it's

575
00:29:36.869 --> 00:29:39.829
a little different than the pickup artist. So No

576
00:29:39.829 --> 00:29:42.109
FA was co-founded by two different guys. One of

577
00:29:42.109 --> 00:29:44.390
them is a pickup artist and founded a pickup

578
00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:48.949
artist for him separately. Um, SO it makes sense,

579
00:29:48.979 --> 00:29:51.650
like some of that rhetoric is definitely in there.

580
00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.380
And so I can talk more about specific studies

581
00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.739
or the general effects, but yeah, we've had a

582
00:29:56.739 --> 00:29:58.180
series of studies now about NoFA.

583
00:29:59.099 --> 00:30:02.050
Mhm. So tell us about the, the studies then,

584
00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.290
and then I will make, I will probably ask

585
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:05.959
you a few more questions about it.

586
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.130
OK. The first uh registered study, we just asked

587
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:12.449
folks, you know, do you know what noFAP is?

588
00:30:12.459 --> 00:30:14.140
And if you, if you did, we let you

589
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.520
in and then we Uh, looked at their experience,

590
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.400
like if they had tried to do one of

591
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:24.229
these detoxes, um, which they call rebooting, and, uh,

592
00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:26.229
we said, well, what do you consider a relapse?

593
00:30:26.439 --> 00:30:27.880
You know, like, what do you even think that

594
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.839
is? Cause there's a lot of discussion on these

595
00:30:29.839 --> 00:30:32.439
forums where they don't even know. They're like, did

596
00:30:32.439 --> 00:30:35.160
I relapse? Did I not? So, NoFAP was founded

597
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.040
as an anti-masturbation movement. That's very clear. All their

598
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.439
documentation shows that they now say that was never

599
00:30:40.439 --> 00:30:42.520
the case, that was definitely the case, that was

600
00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.270
how they were founded. Since then, they've broadened out,

601
00:30:45.439 --> 00:30:48.199
so their treatment manual that they send out recommends

602
00:30:48.199 --> 00:30:51.520
90 days abstinence from porn masturbation orgasm as a

603
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.599
gold standard. They actually call it the gold standard.

604
00:30:53.719 --> 00:30:54.920
I don't know why. I don't know where that

605
00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:58.130
came from, but that's what they decided on. So,

606
00:30:58.199 --> 00:31:00.410
uh, it was relevant, of course, like, what do

607
00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:02.400
you think is a relapse? And it was really

608
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.160
all over the board and interesting to me, like

609
00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.599
one of the things a lot of people said

610
00:31:06.599 --> 00:31:09.479
was a relapse was cheating on your partner. I

611
00:31:09.479 --> 00:31:12.209
was like, how does that How is that related

612
00:31:12.209 --> 00:31:14.810
to what you're talking about in this group. So

613
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.410
it, there was a lot of diversity in terms

614
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.369
of what they considered problematic, and then we said

615
00:31:19.369 --> 00:31:23.099
OK, thinking about. If you tried this, thinking about

616
00:31:23.099 --> 00:31:25.339
the last time you experienced a relapse, how did

617
00:31:25.339 --> 00:31:28.500
you feel? You asked them about different emotions. And

618
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.540
the two that really stood out as the, the

619
00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.939
most endorsed was shame. So they say it's not

620
00:31:32.939 --> 00:31:35.420
a shaming treatment, but that's exactly what it causes.

621
00:31:35.579 --> 00:31:38.329
People said they experience a lot of uh shame,

622
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.619
uh, so, uh, more so than things like sadness

623
00:31:41.619 --> 00:31:46.660
and anxiety. Uh, THEY also Uh, sometimes reported suicidality.

624
00:31:46.829 --> 00:31:48.510
Now that wasn't endorsed at as high of a

625
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:51.359
rate, but given that this is not an empirically

626
00:31:51.359 --> 00:31:57.540
supported treatment, anything that causes suicidal ideation is problematic.

627
00:31:58.109 --> 00:32:00.060
So we even had 12 folks out of our,

628
00:32:00.189 --> 00:32:02.869
I think 289 sample, uh, that said it was

629
00:32:02.869 --> 00:32:05.109
extremely suicidal. So this was just their most recent

630
00:32:05.109 --> 00:32:09.030
relapse and they had an extraordinarily negative reaction. Which

631
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.750
is not appropriate. I mean, that's, we shouldn't be

632
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.469
offering this, especially, you know, it's offered for youth,

633
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.349
age 13 and up is who's allowed on the

634
00:32:16.349 --> 00:32:19.469
forums. Uh, I don't want youth exposed to that

635
00:32:19.469 --> 00:32:22.270
messaging, that if you masturbate, you know, you ruined

636
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:25.180
your brain, and maybe you should kill yourself. Uh,

637
00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.109
THAT, I think it's a horrible message for young

638
00:32:27.109 --> 00:32:29.670
men. Uh, WE did a study looking at the

639
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:33.640
violent content. And this study is often misunderstood, so

640
00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.839
I got to get ahead of it a little

641
00:32:34.839 --> 00:32:38.719
bit that, uh, we looked at violent content that

642
00:32:38.719 --> 00:32:42.160
contained explicitly violent words. So we did not try

643
00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.790
and quantify all of the potentially violent posts, um,

644
00:32:46.199 --> 00:32:48.680
but we got them off of the Reddit subforums

645
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.640
for NoFA, a comparison forum for stop drinking, and

646
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.319
another, uh, comparison forum, uh, that was porn-free, I

647
00:32:57.319 --> 00:32:58.890
think was the other one. So another kind of

648
00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:02.540
porn related but not their program. And it was,

649
00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:06.449
uh, remarkable how much more violent than no fat

650
00:33:06.449 --> 00:33:10.790
was. And, uh, so sometimes I think, uh, of

651
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.300
all of the posts that we found that were

652
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.160
violent, people say, oh, you know, that was over

653
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.410
11 years, that's really few posts, given that these

654
00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.209
are some of the worst of the worst though.

655
00:33:19.329 --> 00:33:22.010
This is not a survey of all violent posts.

656
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.560
There are many, many more, uh, ones that like,

657
00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:27.050
I personally know of many, many more than that

658
00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.130
didn't that our Uh, the particular search terms that

659
00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:34.079
we use for that systematic review. And interestingly, uh,

660
00:33:34.089 --> 00:33:36.410
some of the most common targets of those violent

661
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.380
posts were other forum users, which I didn't expect.

662
00:33:39.569 --> 00:33:42.869
So, Uh, there were things like, uh, somebody comes

663
00:33:42.869 --> 00:33:44.550
on and says, hey, you know, I'm really fighting

664
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:47.390
my urge. I'm really struggling right now. Someone chimes

665
00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:50.109
in, uh, if you touch yourself, I have your

666
00:33:50.109 --> 00:33:51.910
IP address and I'll come shoot you in the

667
00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:55.910
head. What? You know, I, I don't think they

668
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.109
actually have their IP address, and even if you

669
00:33:58.109 --> 00:34:00.939
did, it wouldn't necessarily show where they were. But,

670
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:03.219
you know, those kind of posts have no place

671
00:34:03.219 --> 00:34:05.670
in a recovery forum. Like, what is that about?

672
00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.530
Um, AND since then, like we've discovered. We missed

673
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:11.639
an important key term. A lot of them were

674
00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:14.790
talking about self-harm and punching themselves in the genitals.

675
00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:17.330
So since then, like I added a punch search

676
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.350
term and I've updated our database, um, cause a

677
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.750
lot of those have that kind of violent content.

678
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:26.149
Um, SO, yeah, we've done a few other, uh,

679
00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.560
studies as well, kind of looking at, um, something

680
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.668
called DOT syndrome that kind of started in India

681
00:34:31.668 --> 00:34:34.159
and has spread into Pakistan and then we have

682
00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.728
a paper in the UK. And it appears noFAP

683
00:34:36.728 --> 00:34:39.239
has kind of brought DOT syndrome into the states.

684
00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:45.280
So dot is uh kind of unreasonable, um, uh,

685
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:49.330
pathological fear of ejaculation. That is, you think you're

686
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:52.840
losing your life force, this is harming me. Uh,

687
00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.409
SO it's a not a semen retention practice in

688
00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:58.129
like a religious sense, but a really like neurotic

689
00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:01.729
fear of one's own normal body responses, and it's,

690
00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:05.300
it is diagnosed with the pathology and Uh, international

691
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:10.209
classification disorders, and so, uh, we see a lot

692
00:35:10.209 --> 00:35:12.489
of evidence for this kind of posts in NoFAP

693
00:35:12.489 --> 00:35:15.090
also, so it really seems like they've brought this

694
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:20.129
neuroses into America. Uh, WE don't need more neuroses.

695
00:35:21.879 --> 00:35:26.620
Yeah. Uh, BUT addressing the main claims made by

696
00:35:27.489 --> 00:35:29.590
noA groups, of course, they have to do with

697
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:33.550
semen retention. What do, what kinds of claims do

698
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.949
they make about that? And are there any real

699
00:35:36.949 --> 00:35:38.949
benefits to semen retention?

700
00:35:40.219 --> 00:35:43.649
Uh, SO they often try and distance themselves from

701
00:35:43.649 --> 00:35:46.449
semen retention communities, which is funny because you can

702
00:35:46.449 --> 00:35:49.689
see they're often fighting people on their forums that

703
00:35:49.689 --> 00:35:53.649
are advocating for that practice, uh, especially if it's

704
00:35:53.649 --> 00:35:56.370
for religious reasons, um, they'll say that's not what

705
00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:58.090
we do, that's not who we are, but then

706
00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:01.179
a lot of the argumentation is the same, so.

707
00:36:01.419 --> 00:36:04.080
I can see, uh, there are many scholars who've

708
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.679
lumped them together like NoFA being the same as

709
00:36:06.679 --> 00:36:09.719
other semen retention groups, uh, and then others who

710
00:36:09.719 --> 00:36:13.080
clearly try and separate them. So, uh, and there's

711
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.479
not a bright line between them in terms of

712
00:36:15.479 --> 00:36:17.760
practice, but I know they try to create a

713
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.229
line.

714
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.909
Mhm. Yeah, but, uh, I mean about the, the

715
00:36:22.909 --> 00:36:26.169
kinds of claims they make, what, what, what do

716
00:36:26.169 --> 00:36:27.620
they tend to say about men,

717
00:36:28.429 --> 00:36:31.350
I mean, the founding, the the way NoFA got

718
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.469
actually started was they got the claim off of

719
00:36:33.469 --> 00:36:37.469
a bodybuilding forum that were abstaining from ejaculation because

720
00:36:37.469 --> 00:36:40.120
they thought it increased their testosterone levels and then

721
00:36:40.429 --> 00:36:43.229
would result in increased muscular gains and the opposite

722
00:36:43.229 --> 00:36:46.060
is true. That is, uh, when you're more sexually

723
00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.050
active, you tend to have higher on average testosterone

724
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.719
titers. I don't think that's enough to affect muscular

725
00:36:51.719 --> 00:36:54.810
gain. It's actually, like it's still within physiological ranges,

726
00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.800
um, doesn't do anything crazy to ejaculate a bunch.

727
00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:01.639
So, uh, as far as we know. So, uh,

728
00:37:01.649 --> 00:37:04.360
the kind of central claim, how they were founded,

729
00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.929
uh, seems not to hold water. Uh, AND there

730
00:37:07.929 --> 00:37:11.810
was some, uh, claims related to a Chinese study

731
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:16.060
that was actually recently retracted. And uh they still

732
00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.629
sometimes try and link to that study and say,

733
00:37:17.669 --> 00:37:21.020
oh, you know, that the core thing still exists

734
00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.429
in this other Chinese journal, but it doesn't. It's

735
00:37:23.429 --> 00:37:26.750
a different study. Uh, YOU know, we explored that

736
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:30.469
and so the claim is just not, not well

737
00:37:30.469 --> 00:37:33.340
supported and then the opposite is probably true.

738
00:37:34.239 --> 00:37:38.909
Right, but are there any real benefits to? Yeah,

739
00:37:41.389 --> 00:37:43.070
I mean, I'm strugg you can hear me struggling

740
00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.780
a little bit because I'm like, not really, um,

741
00:37:46.199 --> 00:37:49.870
so the, I mean you could think if I'm

742
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:54.550
trying to be expansive here, like, uh, part of

743
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:58.620
what NoFA seems to be doing is giving men

744
00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.689
and boys uh feeling of control, so. Uh, I

745
00:38:02.689 --> 00:38:05.010
can control my body. I'm the boss. I tell

746
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.729
it what to do. I control my urges. Uh,

747
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:10.409
AND self-regulation is not a bad thing, you know,

748
00:38:10.489 --> 00:38:12.409
I mean, that's, uh, part of growing up is

749
00:38:12.409 --> 00:38:13.969
we learn not to scream when we feel like

750
00:38:13.969 --> 00:38:18.290
screaming. So it's uh, uh, you could argue that's

751
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:21.169
not, uh, inherently bad, but it's kind of how

752
00:38:21.169 --> 00:38:22.850
you go about it, you know, how do you

753
00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:26.389
develop emotion regulation. Uh, AND I would argue there's,

754
00:38:26.479 --> 00:38:28.149
as far as I know, there's not any evidence

755
00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.320
that gaining that kind of, kind of mastery, as

756
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.629
they often call it, uh, confers any actual advantage

757
00:38:35.629 --> 00:38:38.879
or actually impacts like emotion regulation more broadly or

758
00:38:38.879 --> 00:38:39.510
anything like that.

759
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.600
Is there anything that happens to people physiologically, for

760
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.389
example, when they go for a very long period

761
00:38:49.389 --> 00:38:51.199
of time without sex?

762
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.760
A very, very long time, sure. So, uh, there

763
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.600
are fertility factors and the ejaculate that decrease if

764
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.080
you don't come for a very, very long time.

765
00:39:01.379 --> 00:39:03.419
But this is on the order of like years.

766
00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:06.830
So, uh, so yeah, fair point if you extend

767
00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:11.429
it that far. Uh, AND similarly, like you'll, um,

768
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:16.830
there is uh some degradation of the, uh, tissue

769
00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:19.350
around genital organs that will degrade at a more

770
00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:22.110
rapid rate and people who aren't experiencing any kind

771
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.830
of sexual stimulation. So it's not just not having

772
00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:26.750
a partner, but it's like you're not masturbating. If

773
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:28.669
you do nothing, you know, if you're really hands

774
00:39:28.669 --> 00:39:33.070
off. Uh, FOR years, periods, you can definitely get

775
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:37.070
degradation of tissues in the genitals because there's, it's

776
00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.419
a bit of a use it or lose it

777
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:42.100
situation like the muscles can degrade, the tissues, uh,

778
00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:45.100
aren't as pliable. We see those kind of problems.

779
00:39:45.899 --> 00:39:50.550
Mhm. Um, WHAT distinguishes what happens in the early

780
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:55.310
phases of arousal versus when one reaches orgasm, I

781
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.090
mean, at the level of the brain.

782
00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:00.350
We are working on that. The bottom line is

783
00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.209
we don't know, and there have been only a

784
00:40:03.209 --> 00:40:06.020
few studies that have followed the brain through climax,

785
00:40:06.229 --> 00:40:08.310
and whenever you see a study make claims about

786
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.110
what happens in the brain at climax, you got

787
00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:14.510
to be very, very skeptical. Because, uh, when climax

788
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:18.199
happens, even if the head doesn't move, the face

789
00:40:18.199 --> 00:40:21.610
muscles move, all of that creates artifacts that interfere

790
00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:26.120
with functional magnetic resonance imaging, interfere with electroencephalography, and

791
00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.669
because they're not happening repeatedly, they're very, very difficult

792
00:40:29.669 --> 00:40:32.550
to get out of the signals. So when someone

793
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:35.780
says, oh, the brain does this at climax, maybe.

794
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.000
You know, like there's, there's a lot of noise

795
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.560
to get through. So we got really interested in

796
00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.310
the period preceding it, like what happens leading up

797
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:46.639
to it. And part of why this was happening

798
00:40:46.639 --> 00:40:50.199
is we were studying women initially, and we normally

799
00:40:50.199 --> 00:40:52.679
expect people when they're getting aroused, uh, you know,

800
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.899
getting more and more and more excited until something

801
00:40:54.899 --> 00:40:57.080
happens and you have a climax. That's how Masters

802
00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.590
and Johnson wrote it. And uh one of the

803
00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:02.669
measures we had was sympathetic nervous system activity through

804
00:41:02.669 --> 00:41:05.310
galvanic skin response typically measured in the palms or

805
00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:06.330
the soles of the feet where there are a

806
00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.989
lot of equine glands. And so you would see

807
00:41:08.989 --> 00:41:11.110
these go up and up and up, but then

808
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.530
when we'd say, OK, try to have a climax

809
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:15.100
if you can, it fell off and like what

810
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:19.389
was that? Did our instrument fall off like And

811
00:41:19.389 --> 00:41:20.989
as we got to digging into this, we think

812
00:41:20.989 --> 00:41:23.270
it's a real effect. That is, there seem to

813
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.419
be really distinct phases where trying to get aroused

814
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:29.790
is a real effortful experience where you have to

815
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:33.350
pay attention, think of something as sexual, elaborate on

816
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:35.270
it in your mind, and when you try to

817
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:38.189
get to climax, it's the opposite. You kinda got

818
00:41:38.189 --> 00:41:41.949
to let your brain do its thing and the

819
00:41:41.949 --> 00:41:46.020
broad thing we think is going on. His orgasm

820
00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.770
in the brain, as best we know, looks a

821
00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:50.070
lot like seizure activity. There's a lot of synchronous

822
00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:52.510
firing. You don't want to be in that state

823
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:56.760
unless it's safe to do so. So our suspicion

824
00:41:56.989 --> 00:41:59.750
is there's a reduction in cognitive control and a

825
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:02.550
reduction in neuro control that has to occur to

826
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:05.870
allow the synchronous firing to trigger, and, and that

827
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:08.590
seems like a, a very reasonable kind of safety

828
00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:11.439
mechanism. Where is it like, OK, are we in

829
00:42:11.439 --> 00:42:13.879
a space where this can happen and I'm not

830
00:42:13.879 --> 00:42:15.330
gonna get eaten by a lion if you want

831
00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:18.750
to go evolutionary, uh, or in a space where,

832
00:42:18.879 --> 00:42:20.830
you know, like I'm attracted to this person and

833
00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:22.760
they're not gonna assault me. Everything is as I

834
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.879
want it to be. I feel good. Um, LET'S,

835
00:42:25.959 --> 00:42:28.840
let's go there, brain, you know, so, so there

836
00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.959
really seems to be a shift and we have

837
00:42:31.959 --> 00:42:35.159
reasonable documentation of it in women, and we've just

838
00:42:35.159 --> 00:42:37.500
started a study in men. We have 4 right

839
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.600
now. And we're looking for a similar kind of

840
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.320
signature and guys, we've seen some of it in

841
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.360
a couple of male subjects and piloting, but that's

842
00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.199
what we're, we're really looking to see in part

843
00:42:48.199 --> 00:42:48.959
in this new study.

844
00:42:50.459 --> 00:42:55.260
Great. Uh, THIS pornography activate the same areas of

845
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.379
the brain as sex with a partner, and if

846
00:42:58.379 --> 00:43:01.290
so, what does that mean exactly?

847
00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:04.530
Uh, THERE'S a lot of overlap and also distinction,

848
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:09.139
so they're both mainly activating the salience network areas

849
00:43:09.139 --> 00:43:12.530
of the brain, that is, uh, Areas of the

850
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:14.729
brain that link together to say like, hey, we

851
00:43:14.729 --> 00:43:16.010
need to pay attention to that, we might need

852
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:19.850
to respond to this. Uh, THAT is generally the

853
00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:24.280
network that's involved in emotional experiences. So that's ultimately

854
00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.489
what we think emotions are for. It's like directing

855
00:43:26.489 --> 00:43:28.399
our attention and preparing to act if we need

856
00:43:28.399 --> 00:43:33.620
to. So, uh, both pornography and, uh, partnered sex

857
00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:37.169
activate those brain areas, at least early on, um.

858
00:43:37.679 --> 00:43:41.439
They uh prepare us to act the motor strip

859
00:43:41.439 --> 00:43:43.000
areas of the brain that is the kind of

860
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.639
signify, um, the homunculus if you've ever seen a

861
00:43:46.639 --> 00:43:49.360
mapping because it's, it's very cortical, very much on

862
00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.669
the outside. Um, THERE are areas for the genitals.

863
00:43:52.679 --> 00:43:55.800
Those are activated both by viewing pornography, touching those

864
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.000
spaces as well as some actual touching, which is

865
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.780
kind of interesting and potentially a mirror issue. Um,

866
00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:06.129
BUT there are also distinctions from things like, you

867
00:44:06.129 --> 00:44:08.340
know, I'm having an interaction with a person. I

868
00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:11.239
feel that person desires me, uh, that I don't

869
00:44:11.239 --> 00:44:14.780
get from pornography. Uh, THERE are touch, uh, specific

870
00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.899
sensors that are noticing that someone is stroking me

871
00:44:17.899 --> 00:44:19.860
in a way that is intended to be sexual

872
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.459
or is likely to be sexual. That's a distinct

873
00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:25.800
area of the brain. So, uh, there are some

874
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.560
that is, uh, that may be unique and distinct.

875
00:44:28.639 --> 00:44:31.800
I think it's largely overlap. Uh, THE biggest distinction

876
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.159
is in magnitude, that is someone who's interacting with

877
00:44:35.159 --> 00:44:37.550
a partner, all of those salient areas are gonna

878
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:41.870
be activated much more strongly. It's I think maybe

879
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:42.649
the bottom line.

880
00:44:43.389 --> 00:44:47.739
Right. So, I mean, it's clear, I guess that

881
00:44:47.739 --> 00:44:54.459
psychologically and neurologically, we pretty much distinguish between watching

882
00:44:54.459 --> 00:44:57.110
pornography and having sex, right.

883
00:44:58.189 --> 00:45:00.959
Yeah, there's some clear distinctions, uh, and it's always

884
00:45:00.959 --> 00:45:04.110
kind of a hard answer cause it's, they're not

885
00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.080
totally distinct for sure, but they're also not the

886
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.959
same and just more of. There are some qualitative

887
00:45:09.959 --> 00:45:15.280
differences, but, uh, it's a largely, uh, uh kind

888
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.209
of a magnitude difference for the most active areas

889
00:45:18.209 --> 00:45:18.840
of the brain.

890
00:45:19.469 --> 00:45:25.050
Right. Do women really have multiple orgasms?

891
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:30.750
Oh man, I don't know. So I always say

892
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.120
when people say multiple, I was like, what do

893
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.429
you mean? When you say multiple, what is a

894
00:45:34.429 --> 00:45:37.909
multiple? So if I have a climax, go get

895
00:45:37.909 --> 00:45:39.949
a drink of water, come back and have another

896
00:45:39.949 --> 00:45:43.550
13 minutes later. Was that a multiple? If I

897
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:47.629
have one, and then I lose my erection, and

898
00:45:47.629 --> 00:45:49.149
then it comes back and I have, was that

899
00:45:49.149 --> 00:45:51.909
a multiple if it was 2 minutes later, uh,

900
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:53.919
does it have to be on the same erection?

901
00:45:54.189 --> 00:45:56.899
Does it have to be? So number one is

902
00:45:56.899 --> 00:45:59.340
like, we don't have an agreed on definition of

903
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:04.139
what constitutes multiple. Um, I will say, I don't

904
00:46:04.139 --> 00:46:06.659
think this idea that like women can have multiple

905
00:46:06.659 --> 00:46:09.360
and men don't. I, I don't think it's accurate.

906
00:46:09.459 --> 00:46:13.739
And in large part, uh, it's because when we

907
00:46:13.739 --> 00:46:17.810
were testing women looking at their, uh, orgasmic response,

908
00:46:18.179 --> 00:46:19.820
about half the women, when they said they were

909
00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.620
having a climax, we didn't see physiological evidence for

910
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.780
it. That is, we didn't see the stereotype contractions

911
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.159
that occur in the pel. THIS. So I, I

912
00:46:27.159 --> 00:46:28.800
don't doubt that they're having fun. I don't want

913
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:32.270
to rain on that parade, but uh they are

914
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:37.159
not having the same uh kind of contractions that

915
00:46:37.159 --> 00:46:42.379
also elicit things that pace copulation. So, some of

916
00:46:42.379 --> 00:46:44.939
the things that uh occur in the body when

917
00:46:44.939 --> 00:46:49.020
we have an orgasm cause that refractory period that

918
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.780
may allow us or not to have multiple orgasms

919
00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.979
or have them in close proximity at least. So

920
00:46:55.979 --> 00:47:00.159
if half the women aren't actually having these stop

921
00:47:00.159 --> 00:47:03.219
signals from uh, uh, I'm gonna call it true

922
00:47:03.219 --> 00:47:09.510
climax, uh uh physiological climax, um. You know, then,

923
00:47:09.679 --> 00:47:11.719
then, of course, they're gonna look like they're having

924
00:47:11.719 --> 00:47:13.919
multiple orgasms and the guys will look like they're

925
00:47:13.919 --> 00:47:17.080
not. But if we limited it to just women

926
00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.159
that are having those experiences, I think they're gonna

927
00:47:19.159 --> 00:47:21.159
look a lot like men. That is, there's gonna

928
00:47:21.159 --> 00:47:23.679
be a distribution where some people can have orgasms

929
00:47:23.679 --> 00:47:25.840
pretty close in time because they have a really

930
00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.899
short refractory period. Mhm.

931
00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:32.270
That's yeah. That's very interesting. So let me just

932
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:34.469
ask you about one last topic, and then I

933
00:47:34.469 --> 00:47:38.330
will probably have one other final question. Uh, COULD

934
00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:40.659
you tell us about the work you've been doing?

935
00:47:40.709 --> 00:47:44.179
And I know this is very early in your,

936
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:46.830
in the, in the research you're doing on this

937
00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.840
topic, but the work you've been doing on post

938
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.540
orgasmic syndrome, I mean, what it is, what you

939
00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.100
think is happening there,

940
00:47:55.189 --> 00:47:59.449
etc. Post orgasmic illness syndrome, we think mainly affects

941
00:47:59.449 --> 00:48:02.129
men. It's the experience of having flu-like symptoms for

942
00:48:02.129 --> 00:48:04.620
2 to 7 days after every climax, regardless of

943
00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:08.139
how it's experienced. That is partnered masturbation, doesn't matter

944
00:48:08.139 --> 00:48:11.060
for these guys. There was a history of research

945
00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:14.669
in this space that was typically very small samples.

946
00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.090
One of the leaders in this space, uh, Marcel

947
00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:20.260
Waldinger recently passed, and they had a lot of

948
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:25.790
theories about um an auto-allergen and the ejaculate. That

949
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:28.030
is, they thought maybe when these guys are having

950
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:31.030
a climax, there's something in their semen that's causing

951
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:34.189
them to react. And as a result of that,

952
00:48:34.229 --> 00:48:36.350
they were doing things like auto inoculation, that is

953
00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:39.949
injecting their semen back into themselves. And there were

954
00:48:39.949 --> 00:48:43.110
case reports of these things. Uh, IN general, these

955
00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:46.189
studies tend to be just really tiny, not well

956
00:48:46.189 --> 00:48:50.379
replicated. And the mechanisms weren't strong, so that is,

957
00:48:50.689 --> 00:48:53.870
they were making some guesses, as one does with

958
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:55.989
a rare disorder, you know, you kinda gotta start

959
00:48:55.989 --> 00:49:00.030
somewhere, but they didn't have great promise to my

960
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:02.149
mind as something that was likely to be a

961
00:49:02.149 --> 00:49:04.800
solution for a variety of reasons, but in part

962
00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.750
it's like, well, the ejaculate didn't just come out,

963
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:11.070
it was in your body before. Like, what is

964
00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:13.699
it about it coming out that you think caused

965
00:49:13.699 --> 00:49:16.659
the allergic reaction that So there were details like

966
00:49:16.659 --> 00:49:20.120
that that weren't clear. So our study is uh

967
00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.760
recruiting a large sample of men who struggle with

968
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.719
this issue and also control men who don't have

969
00:49:26.719 --> 00:49:29.560
this issue at all, and we're gonna be comparing

970
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.399
them on a series of inflammatory cytokines, uh, so

971
00:49:33.399 --> 00:49:36.639
we have, uh, we're getting all kinds of data

972
00:49:36.639 --> 00:49:41.100
from these generous guys. Uh, SO we're getting saliva

973
00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:44.860
blood samples, ejaculate samples, and we're looking for differences

974
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.909
in inflammatory response that we think likely underlie this

975
00:49:47.909 --> 00:49:50.419
disorder, but we don't know. I mean, that's why

976
00:49:50.419 --> 00:49:53.010
we're looking, uh, it is considered a rare disorder

977
00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:55.760
that's, um, the funders are from the National Organization

978
00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.530
of Rare Disorders and the Fulton Family Foundation. So,

979
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.340
uh, we're very glad to have the ability to

980
00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.709
do that work. It's very, very rare, especially in

981
00:50:04.709 --> 00:50:06.219
the states to be able to do that.

982
00:50:07.639 --> 00:50:10.060
So let me just ask you one final question

983
00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:13.449
then about your work in general. I mean, is

984
00:50:13.449 --> 00:50:17.300
it easy to do this kind of research? I

985
00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.540
mean, in terms of getting grants for it and

986
00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:26.270
particularly in the US is the cultural context uh

987
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:28.620
ideal for this kind of research or

988
00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:34.199
not? God, no. So we always have a toss

989
00:50:34.199 --> 00:50:36.919
up because our European colleagues are a lot more

990
00:50:36.919 --> 00:50:38.760
free to do this kind of work, but they

991
00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.540
also, their federal grants tend to be much smaller.

992
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.639
So it's, they can ask a lot more of

993
00:50:44.639 --> 00:50:46.600
these questions, but they can't necessarily do it in

994
00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.679
kind of a big science way. But we can't

995
00:50:48.679 --> 00:50:51.320
either because we can't get those giant grants here

996
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.199
that do exist. So, uh, you know, it's a

997
00:50:54.199 --> 00:50:56.590
bit of a, a tossup. Most people who get

998
00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:57.879
trained to do this kind of work in the

999
00:50:57.879 --> 00:50:59.840
states will leave. So a lot of them go

1000
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.989
to Canada. Uh, BECAUSE of some of the challenges,

1001
00:51:03.239 --> 00:51:06.260
we also have, uh, a very serious problem with

1002
00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:09.600
violent threats. So, uh, you know, I've had serious

1003
00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.399
issues around that a number of my colleagues have,

1004
00:51:11.639 --> 00:51:14.199
especially related to the study of pornography, uh, less

1005
00:51:14.199 --> 00:51:17.510
so with some of the other projects, but, uh,

1006
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:21.439
our religious persuasion is quite strong in the states

1007
00:51:21.439 --> 00:51:23.280
and they do not want this work done. If

1008
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.199
it says anything might be OK about sex outside

1009
00:51:26.199 --> 00:51:31.570
of marriage, masturbation in general, and viewing pornography. Uh,

1010
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:34.260
IF you don't stop doing your work, they will

1011
00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.760
try and stop you from doing your work. And,

1012
00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:39.350
uh, that is a tremendous problem in the states

1013
00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:41.770
that I don't think is faced to that extent

1014
00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:42.280
anywhere else.

1015
00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:47.370
Right, so just before we go, would you like

1016
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.939
to tell people where they can find your work

1017
00:51:49.939 --> 00:51:50.870
