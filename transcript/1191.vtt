00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.690
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.329
Dissenter. I'm here today with Keegan, a fellow YouTuber

3
00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:11.619
and podcaster from the YouTube channel Essential Salts, and

4
00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.489
he's also the host of the Nietzsche podcast. And

5
00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.190
today we're going to talk. About N Nietzsche. I

6
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.670
mean, I guess we are two Nietzsche enthusiasts. I've

7
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.309
had many Nietzsche scholars on the show and I've

8
00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:27.750
been following Keegan's work for a while now, so

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.270
I thought we could have a good talk. So

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.490
Keegan, welcome to the show. It's uh very nice

11
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.750
to meet you and to everyone.

12
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.849
Thank you very much. Uh, IT'S my pleasure. Thank

13
00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:37.490
you for having me.

14
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.340
OK, so, look, I, I, I would like to

15
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.419
start, uh, before we get into the topics I

16
00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:49.299
prepared, I, I'm curious, what got you interested in

17
00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.500
Nietzsche and then perhaps, uh, after that I can

18
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.659
also tell my personal story about that, but how

19
00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.939
did you get into his philosophy?

20
00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:02.569
I think the first time that I encountered Nietzsche

21
00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:04.809
was when I was a teenager when I was

22
00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.440
first going to college and I had a very

23
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.709
typical experience, uh. That many people, many young men

24
00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:14.629
have, uh, I picked up Beyond Good and Evil

25
00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:18.430
and opened the first pages and immediately didn't understand

26
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.830
what I was reading and it was sort of

27
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.620
looking for, you know, I had heard Nietzsche was

28
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.819
this radical anti-Christian and I was very much into

29
00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.309
atheism at that time, um, you know, I guess

30
00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:33.819
I still am technically, but you know, it was,

31
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.699
uh, the days of the new atheists. And uh

32
00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:39.260
I was, that was one of the things I

33
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.139
was interested in in the philosophy program was learning

34
00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:47.620
historical, uh, arguments or, or, you know, historical figures

35
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.300
who might give a different perspective, different arguments as

36
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.800
to why they opposed Christianity. And I could immediately

37
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.680
tell that I remember I went to the Antichrist

38
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.080
and you know, both of those books begin in

39
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.410
very strange ways if you're used to like this

40
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.839
sort of like rationalistic form of argument that the

41
00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:06.959
new atheists are very famous for. He's beginning his

42
00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.500
books by saying, suppose that truth were a woman

43
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.720
or let us look one another in the face.

44
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.800
We are hyperboreans, you know, you're immediately in kind

45
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.630
of strange territory, but I knew that there was

46
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.639
something there that I really, uh. You know, Nietzsche

47
00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:24.320
is just such a wonderful writer, and such a

48
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.259
lyrical writer that it was very enjoyable to read

49
00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:32.139
him even when I was confused about the overall

50
00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.009
point he was making. And as I learned over

51
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:38.320
the years, uh, there, Were things that Nietzsche was

52
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.679
addressing, for example, in Beyond Good and Evil that

53
00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.869
speak to the history of philosophy or metaphysics that

54
00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.919
I wasn't yet familiar with and, um, you know,

55
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.639
a whole background in Nietzsche's life and his career

56
00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.240
that I wasn't really familiar with. So it took

57
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.559
me many, many years. I would say probably the

58
00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:57.360
course of a decade before I feel like I

59
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.520
was picking up Nietzsche's books and actually understanding what

60
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.279
I was reading and by that time I had

61
00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:05.300
dropped out of school. Uh, I, or out of

62
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.979
university. I, I've told this story many times, but,

63
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:13.100
uh, essentially, I became a touring musician. Uh, I

64
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.940
decided that was the life for me, uh, which

65
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.779
was, you know, a stupid decision, but, you know,

66
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.179
uh, be willing to perish in pursuit of the

67
00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:24.259
great and impossible, right? So that's what I, I

68
00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:28.470
decided to do, uh, financially perish at least, and,

69
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.850
uh. But touring and being in a band, uh,

70
00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.050
gives you quite a bit of time to read

71
00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:40.729
and do self-directed reading and do self-directed study and

72
00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.080
when we first started touring, you know, I, I've

73
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.699
always been kind of a. A Luddite or a

74
00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:49.419
dinosaur, uh, maybe Luddite's the wrong word, but, you

75
00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.289
know, when my bandmates all had smartphones, I, I

76
00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:55.779
had like a BlackBerry, uh, when they, when we

77
00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:58.059
first started touring, I think I had a, a

78
00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:00.720
pay by minute flip phone back in 2012. So

79
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.699
it wasn't the same kind of, uh, situation that

80
00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.820
we're in today where you could sort of distract

81
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.339
yourself, uh, very easily. Oftentimes the only thing to

82
00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:12.059
do was read, and I think that was like

83
00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.619
really good for me that, uh, At that time,

84
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.070
I was sort of put into a situation where,

85
00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:20.079
OK, we're driving for 8 hours, what do you

86
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.000
have? You have your books. And it also helped

87
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.559
that a few of my bandmates over the years

88
00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:26.880
were also interested in philosophy and we would sort

89
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.119
of trade books and. Um, GET one another interested

90
00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:33.459
in philosophers that we might not have otherwise read.

91
00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:35.279
So that was sort of my, my journey to

92
00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:38.750
Nietzsche, and I remember. Uh, I think Beyond Good

93
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.549
and Evil is still my favorite book by Nietzsche,

94
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.630
but I remember that reading Birth of Tragedy while

95
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.730
on tour and all of the. Statements Nietzsche was

96
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.940
making about music and the Dionysian very much resonated

97
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.140
with me at that time, so that was like

98
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.839
one of the first books where I really felt.

99
00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:58.059
That I understood Nietzsche. I was seeing eye to

100
00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:00.089
eye with what he was saying, which is very

101
00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:02.250
strange to think about in retrospect because there's also

102
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.269
very many references in that book that I still

103
00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:07.070
at that time, 10 years ago, 10 years in

104
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.049
the past from now, I still didn't really understand.

105
00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:11.350
I had to do quite a bit of reading,

106
00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:13.589
so it's been like a 20 year process for

107
00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:18.029
me essentially of trying to understand N Nietzsche.

108
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.600
Yeah, I mean for me it's been like a

109
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.649
seventeen-ish project. I mean, I, I'm uh I'm not,

110
00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:31.309
uh as I was telling you, Before we started

111
00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:34.750
recording, I'm not as, I don't have as a

112
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.029
systematic approach to Nietzsche as you seem to have,

113
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.350
but I mean, basically, uh, in school, I didn't

114
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.470
really like philosophy at all. I mean, I didn't

115
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.649
like philosophy classes also because I have a teacher.

116
00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:52.984
Who was very much religious and so I was

117
00:05:52.984 --> 00:05:55.864
like put off by that. And then it was

118
00:05:55.864 --> 00:05:59.385
only after I finished high school that uh I

119
00:05:59.385 --> 00:06:02.545
read a history book. I mean a book on

120
00:06:02.545 --> 00:06:06.265
the history of Western philosophy, and then I was

121
00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:08.855
like, oh, OK, there's some interesting ideas here and

122
00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:12.720
then I I was a bit arrogant back then

123
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.359
and so I decided to read uh Kent's Critique

124
00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:20.839
of Pure Reason. I, I mean, I, that's absolute

125
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.109
madness, having your first philosophy book being that one,

126
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.779
but I, I read it. Yeah, it took me

127
00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:31.720
like 2 weeks, but I, I finished it and

128
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.325
then, uh, a little bit later, uh. I got

129
00:06:35.325 --> 00:06:38.725
into N Nietzsche and my first book was The

130
00:06:38.725 --> 00:06:42.565
Antichrist, just also because back then I was very

131
00:06:42.565 --> 00:06:45.875
much into atheist stuff and I was like, oh,

132
00:06:46.045 --> 00:06:49.404
Anti-Christ, this must be cool, you know, that sort

133
00:06:49.404 --> 00:06:54.964
of, sort of immature and arrogant kind of way

134
00:06:54.964 --> 00:06:58.165
of thinking that I would be able to understand

135
00:06:58.165 --> 00:07:02.970
such a book. Without reading other Nietzsche books prior

136
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.489
to that one, but anyway, I read it. I

137
00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:10.329
don't think I understood much, much of it, but

138
00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:13.950
later, I mean, that was when I was 18

139
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.959
and then 2 years later when I was 20,

140
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.309
I had a summer break where I just decided

141
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:27.415
to. HEAD first into Nietzsche and started with The

142
00:07:27.415 --> 00:07:31.934
Birth of Tragedy and read all the other books

143
00:07:31.934 --> 00:07:35.714
in the space of two months apart from Dan,

144
00:07:36.114 --> 00:07:39.714
uh, Will to Power and Nietzsche Kontra Wagner. So

145
00:07:40.174 --> 00:07:43.934
I mean that's basically how I exposed myself to

146
00:07:43.934 --> 00:07:47.054
Nietzsche and, and the interesting thing is that since

147
00:07:47.054 --> 00:07:51.170
then. Uh, I read Will to Power and Dan,

148
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:56.190
uh, but I haven't reread, I haven't reread any

149
00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.070
of Nietzsche's books. Basically, I was just exposed to

150
00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:04.480
more Nietzsche through the work of Nietzsche's scholars. So,

151
00:08:04.489 --> 00:08:06.250
I mean, that's also, I guess one of the

152
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.809
reasons why I don't have a very systemat system.

153
00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:12.720
Thematic approach to Nietzsche. I mean, in terms of

154
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.779
my favorite book, I guess that, uh, it's weird

155
00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:23.140
because actually I, I have very nihilistic tendencies and

156
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.459
Nietzsche hasn't cured me of that, but my favorite

157
00:08:27.459 --> 00:08:30.839
book is still uh The Spoke Zarathustra.

158
00:08:32.688 --> 00:08:35.049
Yeah, I mean, that's a good one. It's interesting.

159
00:08:35.087 --> 00:08:37.568
We have kind of a similar, we both started

160
00:08:37.568 --> 00:08:39.609
with like anti-Christis, one of our books, and then

161
00:08:39.609 --> 00:08:41.847
both sort of rediscovered Ntzsche through Birth of Tragedy.

162
00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:45.348
So that's interesting. Um, YEAH, that's cool.

163
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:51.150
Yeah, so, look, uh, I was thinking about topics

164
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.429
while I was preparing for our conversation. I mean,

165
00:08:54.549 --> 00:08:57.229
uh, let's see how this goes, but I thought

166
00:08:57.229 --> 00:09:01.250
first about talking a little bit about Nietzsche's take

167
00:09:01.739 --> 00:09:06.364
on rationality. I mean, most people. I'm, I'm not

168
00:09:06.364 --> 00:09:09.455
sure if most people, but at least most people

169
00:09:09.455 --> 00:09:13.164
who are not that familiar with Nietzsche or are

170
00:09:13.164 --> 00:09:17.325
not Nietzsche's scholars, at least they tend to, uh,

171
00:09:17.684 --> 00:09:21.405
talk about him or label him as an irrationalist.

172
00:09:21.515 --> 00:09:24.125
Do you think that's a good label? Uh, DO

173
00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:27.164
you think that you, I mean, that he deserves

174
00:09:27.164 --> 00:09:28.284
that kind of label?

175
00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:32.419
Uh, NO. Uh, WOULD be the short answer. I,

176
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.679
I don't think irrationalist is the correct label for

177
00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:38.919
Nietzsche, which I've, I've remarked on that in, in

178
00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:41.159
the past on the show. I think what might

179
00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:43.549
be a little confusing is that he's certainly not

180
00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:47.039
a rationalist in the way all of the connotations

181
00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:48.880
that normally go along with that term do not

182
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.280
apply to Nietzsche either, but I think when people

183
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.609
call Nietzsche an irrationalist. What they're saying essentially is

184
00:09:57.609 --> 00:10:02.450
that he advocates for a romantic, uh, rejection of

185
00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:06.570
reason itself, something like that. Irrationalist is also one

186
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.849
of those words that is usually not, uh, people

187
00:10:10.849 --> 00:10:14.059
usually don't apply it to themselves, um, especially in,

188
00:10:14.119 --> 00:10:20.559
in the philosophical, um, in philosophical endeavors, because right

189
00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:22.460
at the start, you have a contradiction, right? Because

190
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.789
the entire thing is the operation of reason. So

191
00:10:25.789 --> 00:10:29.570
what I would say about Nietzsche's position on rationality.

192
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:37.289
Is that he actually reinterprets what rationality is. He

193
00:10:37.309 --> 00:10:43.179
includes an element of irrationality within rationality. But uh

194
00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:45.580
to say he outright rejects it, I think would

195
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.489
be incorrect. And one of the ways that we

196
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.440
could get at this might be looking at, uh,

197
00:10:52.549 --> 00:10:55.750
for example, the Platonic theory of truth, that truth

198
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.200
is in the idea. Uh, THE, the, you know,

199
00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:02.859
the guiding question, the metaphysical question of ancient Greek

200
00:11:02.859 --> 00:11:07.099
philosophy is, what is, what is it that exists?

201
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.900
And there's this enduring notion that what exists is

202
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.739
what endures, what persists, what is fixed, what is

203
00:11:15.739 --> 00:11:18.770
constant, what is eternal, something like that. That's how

204
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.179
you get to these ideas of Parmenides and figures

205
00:11:22.179 --> 00:11:26.020
like this. And Plato, as Nietzsche calls him a

206
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:31.140
systematizer, as a chimerical sort of figure who who

207
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.539
sort of takes from Pythagoras and Heraclitus and Parmenides

208
00:11:34.539 --> 00:11:38.549
and Socrates. And weaves together a philosophy out of

209
00:11:38.549 --> 00:11:41.849
them. He does still seem to hold to this

210
00:11:41.849 --> 00:11:45.340
orientation, as we can see and for example, uh

211
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.099
the Cratetalli, that what is true is what is

212
00:11:49.099 --> 00:11:53.750
and what we say exists must uh. Endure it

213
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:58.280
must not be found in the changeable material physical

214
00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.799
world. Socrates has this dialogue where he's saying, does

215
00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:04.400
true beauty exist? OR, you know, does absolute beauty

216
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.119
exist? His interlocutor says, yes, of course, but Socrates

217
00:12:07.119 --> 00:12:08.840
says, Well, we can't find beauty in a fair

218
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.799
face because beauty always fades. There must be some

219
00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:15.599
sort of idea of beauty, a fixed idea that

220
00:12:15.599 --> 00:12:19.919
is beyond this changeable world, uh, this form of

221
00:12:19.919 --> 00:12:25.489
beauty. And uh N Nietzsche says in his preface

222
00:12:25.489 --> 00:12:28.849
to Beyond Good and Evil that Plato with his

223
00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:31.590
idea of pure spirit and the good as such,

224
00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.770
or the good as such, this fixed idea of

225
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:38.950
the good. Uh, DENIED perspective and therefore flipped truth

226
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.440
on her head. So you can see Nietzsche's view

227
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.210
of rationality is sort of like an inversion of

228
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.090
Platonism, but it's only an inversion because he says

229
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.049
we have things upside down essentially, that we have

230
00:12:53.049 --> 00:12:56.969
this view of truth that denies becoming, it denies

231
00:12:56.969 --> 00:13:00.000
perspective, it wants to again make things fixed, constant,

232
00:13:00.049 --> 00:13:05.650
eternal. Uh One of Nietzsche's really interesting remarks toward

233
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.599
the beginning of Beyond Good and Evil is that.

234
00:13:08.659 --> 00:13:13.190
Even our impulses do philosophy. They've all practiced philosophy

235
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.450
from time to time, and that even the philosopher's,

236
00:13:17.109 --> 00:13:23.030
uh, most abstruse metaphysical activity can be understood through

237
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.270
his impulsive activity, that his logic is forced into

238
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.950
definite channels by, uh, drives, essentially drive is N

239
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.510
Nietzsche's word for, I'm sure you know this, but

240
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.070
just for the audience, it's a general term we

241
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:40.369
can usually. Use it as synonymous for impulse. That

242
00:13:40.369 --> 00:13:42.929
so the philosopher's sort of telling you a story

243
00:13:42.929 --> 00:13:45.090
about his impulses. Now why would Nietzsche come up

244
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.690
with this completely different attitude towards truth and rationality?

245
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.099
And I think what he's doing is he's essentially

246
00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:57.219
saying that there is an element of willing within

247
00:13:57.219 --> 00:14:00.549
thinking and an element of thinking within willing, that

248
00:14:00.549 --> 00:14:04.890
thought does not think by itself. Thought one way

249
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:09.020
to to to conceive of this would be that

250
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.080
the drives or the impulses are like the headwaters

251
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.890
of a river, and the thought is at the

252
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.409
end of the river, the mouth of the river

253
00:14:16.409 --> 00:14:19.549
or something like that. Um, SO, you know, uh.

254
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.469
I, I don't want to take that and essentialize

255
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.929
the drive from the thought because I think Nietzsche

256
00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:28.409
is actually melding them together in a way. That's

257
00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:30.169
why the river, I think is a good analogy

258
00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:32.409
because it sort of speaks to that Heraclian flux

259
00:14:32.409 --> 00:14:34.719
that there's not these individual states that proceed into

260
00:14:34.719 --> 00:14:37.929
one another, they flow into one another, and so

261
00:14:37.929 --> 00:14:41.849
that essentially every drive has its own quantum of

262
00:14:41.849 --> 00:14:46.619
reason that it exercises. And so every act of

263
00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:52.799
reasoning therefore involves willing, it involves valuation. Nietzsche says

264
00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:55.940
valuations are physiological demands for the preservation of a

265
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.309
certain way of life. So essentially. Uh, WE have

266
00:14:59.309 --> 00:15:02.869
an evaluative judgment, which is a necessary part of

267
00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:07.219
thinking, but that judgment itself is pre-rational. Um, AND

268
00:15:07.219 --> 00:15:09.859
so I know that's somewhat long winded, but essentially

269
00:15:09.859 --> 00:15:13.049
what Nietzsche tries to do is bring in that

270
00:15:13.049 --> 00:15:17.659
element of evaluation and therefore drive into the act

271
00:15:17.659 --> 00:15:21.409
of thinking. And then therefore that necessarily means that

272
00:15:21.409 --> 00:15:24.250
perspective is an act or is part of the

273
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.489
act of thinking. And what that results in, and

274
00:15:28.489 --> 00:15:31.880
Nietzsche says, uh, the way that Plato flipped truth

275
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.809
on her head was to deny perspective, what this

276
00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:37.890
results in is that with this like implicit platonic

277
00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.070
view of truth, most people have this idea of

278
00:15:40.489 --> 00:15:44.919
what I like to call immaculate perception. So this

279
00:15:44.919 --> 00:15:48.510
God's eye view of a reality that might tell

280
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.909
us what the objective, what the fact of the

281
00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:54.010
matter is. And Nietzsche essentially doesn't believe that we

282
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.330
can come to any understanding of the fact of

283
00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:01.010
the matter. Independent of perspective, independent of those evaluative

284
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:04.260
judgments that shape even he says our organs of

285
00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.460
perception, our visual organs, our eyes are shaped by

286
00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:13.940
value judgments that every, uh, act of perceiving is.

287
00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:16.599
Part of this evolutionary, it was created by an

288
00:16:16.599 --> 00:16:19.440
evolutionary process that was driven by impulse and impulses.

289
00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:22.859
Make a judgment about what is good and what

290
00:16:22.859 --> 00:16:25.179
is bad essentially for the organism, maybe not in

291
00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:28.659
moral terms but in pre-moral terms and so Nietzsche

292
00:16:28.659 --> 00:16:31.179
rolls all that up into the activity of rationality

293
00:16:31.179 --> 00:16:33.419
and that means we now have a very, very

294
00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:35.700
different picture of what it means to reason, to

295
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.010
think or to do philosophy. But I don't think

296
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.530
that makes him an irrationalist, and in fact, Nietzsche

297
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.469
would say. I, it's my task. He, he says

298
00:16:46.469 --> 00:16:49.270
again, supposing truth were a woman, we've approached her

299
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.750
as these sort of rigid, stuffy dogmatists, and that's

300
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.929
a really inexpert way at winning over a woman.

301
00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.190
And so he, but implicit in this is the

302
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:01.869
idea of I want to be a better suture

303
00:17:01.869 --> 00:17:04.300
of the truth. It's not what I don't want

304
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.339
to say more serious, perhaps more sincere, but part,

305
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.729
part of his approach is precisely not being quite

306
00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:13.489
as serious and rigid and fixed in our ideas,

307
00:17:13.858 --> 00:17:17.380
being a bit more carefree, and so I, I

308
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.060
would say that that's Nietzsche's attitude towards rationality.

309
00:17:20.969 --> 00:17:24.689
Have you ever come across or read about Hugo

310
00:17:24.689 --> 00:17:29.890
Mercier's um argumentative theory of reason that he developed

311
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.359
with Dan Sperber? I mean, there is a psycho,

312
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.849
a French psychologist. Have you ever heard of it?

313
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.869
I think so. Is this the idea that essentially

314
00:17:39.569 --> 00:17:42.170
in when we're arguing with one another, we're trying

315
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.790
to like win or triumph rather than.

316
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.380
Um, YEAH, I, I, I'm, yeah, I mean that's

317
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.060
perhaps a simplistic way of putting it. It's basically

318
00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:57.020
that we've evolved the capacity to reason, not to

319
00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:02.060
arrive at truth or to build knowledge, but basically

320
00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.699
to try to convince other people of our own

321
00:18:05.699 --> 00:18:09.579
position. So it has a social function. And not

322
00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:15.040
really that sort of pure epistemic function that many

323
00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.300
philosophers and thinkers attribute to it. So, I mean,

324
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.930
do you think that uh Nietzsche would be in

325
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.900
line with, with that kind of way of approaching

326
00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:32.699
uh reason or rationality that some psychologists, scientific psychologists

327
00:18:32.699 --> 00:18:36.459
in recent years have, uh, I mean, the way

328
00:18:36.459 --> 00:18:37.699
they've been approaching it.

329
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:41.030
I think so actually, yeah, there might be a

330
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:45.510
few like caveats or asterisks, um, to assign to

331
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.869
Nietzsche's view, but especially if you read what Nietzsche

332
00:18:47.869 --> 00:18:50.349
has to say about the sophists. I mean, so

333
00:18:50.349 --> 00:18:56.060
there's a, there's an excellent, uh. Like passage in

334
00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.939
it's actually in the compiled materials for Nietzsche's lectures

335
00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:03.180
on rhetoric when he is a college professor that

336
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.180
uh I, uh, it was the kind of thing

337
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.060
I wouldn't ever recommend to somebody who is first

338
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.060
starting to read Nietzsche, but for you or anyone

339
00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.739
who's read his corpus, it's a wonderful thing to

340
00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:19.500
go and take a look at because N Nietzsche,

341
00:19:20.219 --> 00:19:21.859
I, I, I mean I just try to imagine

342
00:19:21.859 --> 00:19:30.290
being. An unsuspecting Swiss student in 1873 and walking

343
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:34.380
into Basel into a classroom of probably like. 5

344
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.739
people and the professor's supposed to be teaching you

345
00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:39.459
about rhetoric so you're like, OK, I'm gonna learn

346
00:19:39.459 --> 00:19:43.300
about Aristotle's, uh, politics and poetics, and I'm going

347
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.010
to learn about all these things and then Nietzsche

348
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.579
comes in and, and starts making points, for example,

349
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.209
that, uh, lang uh rhetoric is language and the

350
00:19:53.209 --> 00:19:56.939
very structure of language itself does not desire to

351
00:19:56.939 --> 00:20:01.530
instruct but to convey opinions about things that, uh.

352
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.410
In fact, all we have is, he starts going

353
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.239
into like metaphysical arguments, drawing on the German idealist

354
00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:09.339
tradition and saying, all we have is sensation and

355
00:20:09.339 --> 00:20:13.380
representation, and that therefore, we feel a sensation, then

356
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.260
we try to represent it. So there's already a

357
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.010
degree of removal because we're creating sort of an

358
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.939
image from the nerve stimulus. So those are two

359
00:20:20.939 --> 00:20:24.719
totally unequal things. We're indicating a series of, of,

360
00:20:24.839 --> 00:20:27.939
of stimuli from an image that we've created, and

361
00:20:27.939 --> 00:20:31.329
then we're translating that into a sound. That is

362
00:20:31.329 --> 00:20:33.449
then supposed to produce an image that then leads

363
00:20:33.449 --> 00:20:37.229
somebody to understand like this mutual intelligibility of sensation

364
00:20:37.459 --> 00:20:43.109
and so he essentially says that completely anti-Platonic view

365
00:20:43.729 --> 00:20:51.270
that language conveys doxy opinions, not episte, knowledge, but

366
00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:55.660
that in the ancient world. The rhetoricians knew this,

367
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.770
and this is why he says they're willing to

368
00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.339
make the most outlandish claims about being able to

369
00:21:01.339 --> 00:21:05.339
do anything as rators and stylists because they control

370
00:21:05.339 --> 00:21:07.979
the opinions about things and therefore the effect of

371
00:21:07.979 --> 00:21:10.880
things upon men. Which can make sense of of

372
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.160
the very uh striking claims of people like Gorgius

373
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.189
who tells Socrates, for example, you know, uh. Uh,

374
00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.849
THE art of rhetoric is the highest art because

375
00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:23.209
you, you know, you want to talk about the

376
00:21:23.209 --> 00:21:29.089
art of the money changer or the sculptor or

377
00:21:29.089 --> 00:21:32.170
the gymnast. If I can go and convince him.

378
00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:35.229
If I can convince the money changer to work

379
00:21:35.229 --> 00:21:38.160
for me, then his art now labors in my

380
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.640
service. If I can embarrass the scientist or the

381
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.599
gymnastic teacher, even though he has greater knowledge and

382
00:21:45.599 --> 00:21:47.709
has studied more, but my rhetoric is simply more

383
00:21:47.709 --> 00:21:52.869
impressive. My, they, they saw rhetoric as a dynammi,

384
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.869
a power essentially. To sort of like impose your

385
00:21:56.869 --> 00:21:59.750
view upon the world and so. Nietzsche would actually

386
00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.329
say. Not only would, would he probably find agreement

387
00:22:03.709 --> 00:22:06.630
with uh Mercia's view, but he would probably say

388
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.510
that this is a very, very ancient view of

389
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.589
what language is. It might even be one of

390
00:22:11.589 --> 00:22:13.750
the original views of what language is, and that

391
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.660
it's only when we have this Socratic revaluation that

392
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.670
we begin to believe that language, uh, you know,

393
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.969
that it's, it's dia logos that we are somehow

394
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.780
teaching people the truth through logos, that we're revealing

395
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.790
the truth through, through our words. Um, INSTRUCTING others,

396
00:22:31.819 --> 00:22:33.599
something like that, he would say that's like a,

397
00:22:33.939 --> 00:22:35.859
that was a sort of revolution in thought, that

398
00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:38.540
whole idea, and so I think, yeah, with some

399
00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.160
caveats, Nietzsche would probably agree.

400
00:22:40.969 --> 00:22:43.930
Yeah, you know, it's interesting. I also think about

401
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:48.050
this when I think about morality because I, as

402
00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:52.410
Nietzsche was, or I mean, at least as I

403
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:56.050
understand it and as people like Brian later told

404
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:59.790
me. Um, HE was a moral anti-realist, and I'm

405
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:03.739
also a moral anti-realist, and I, I've had conversations,

406
00:23:03.829 --> 00:23:06.750
uh, not for the show, they're not on the

407
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:10.670
show, but I've had conversations with philosophers, uh, about

408
00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.770
this, particularly moral philosophers, and one of them actually

409
00:23:15.109 --> 00:23:18.650
got, uh, offended by what I told him, but

410
00:23:19.069 --> 00:23:21.910
basically I, I told him, you, you know, I,

411
00:23:21.989 --> 00:23:22.310
I mean,

412
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.510
did

413
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:22.709
he

414
00:23:22.709 --> 00:23:24.819
try the old, uh, so, so that, so it's

415
00:23:24.819 --> 00:23:26.792
OK to eat babies. Huh, and you just said

416
00:23:26.792 --> 00:23:28.493
yes. Uh,

417
00:23:28.833 --> 00:23:31.593
NO, no, I, I think it was even worse

418
00:23:31.593 --> 00:23:34.192
than that because basically what I told him was

419
00:23:34.192 --> 00:23:38.993
that, oh, you know, nowadays, I have conversations about

420
00:23:38.993 --> 00:23:43.072
ethics and morality with philosophers on the show, but

421
00:23:43.072 --> 00:23:47.072
it's mostly for fun because I don't take, I

422
00:23:47.072 --> 00:23:50.873
don't take his their arguments very seriously because I

423
00:23:50.873 --> 00:23:54.512
know that they're basically, uh, most of their reasons.

424
00:23:54.656 --> 00:23:58.595
Reasoning is post hoc rationalization. It's basically they've already

425
00:23:58.595 --> 00:24:03.036
arrived or decided what the truth of the matter,

426
00:24:03.115 --> 00:24:06.306
what the moral truth is, and then they, uh,

427
00:24:06.316 --> 00:24:11.296
move backwards and, uh, reason to try to justify

428
00:24:11.515 --> 00:24:14.196
their moral values, and I mean I guess that's

429
00:24:14.196 --> 00:24:18.186
one thing that offends many moral philosophers.

430
00:24:18.696 --> 00:24:20.995
How dare you have fun or how dare you

431
00:24:20.995 --> 00:24:22.836
listen to people you don't already agree with, I

432
00:24:22.836 --> 00:24:28.209
guess. You know, I mean, I think, uh, yeah,

433
00:24:28.489 --> 00:24:30.880
Nietzsche is definitely a moral anti-realist, but I, I

434
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.569
guess it should be said. That whole, that's like

435
00:24:33.569 --> 00:24:37.449
a very broad category which I think only makes

436
00:24:37.449 --> 00:24:41.650
sense by reference to moral realism, right? Like it,

437
00:24:41.689 --> 00:24:44.810
uh, we can tell who created that category. It

438
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:48.670
was the moral realists essentially, I think, because within

439
00:24:48.689 --> 00:24:53.079
the category of moral anti-realism. N Nietzsche is very

440
00:24:53.079 --> 00:24:58.060
different from, say, a David Hume or from, uh,

441
00:24:58.079 --> 00:25:00.750
perhaps what would be another good example of like

442
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.119
a nihilistic or like Marquis Assad or someone like

443
00:25:03.119 --> 00:25:08.439
that. There's so much variety within, uh, beyond this,

444
00:25:08.479 --> 00:25:12.680
uh, walled garden of there are moral objective facts,

445
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.359
which I think is, I, I would share your

446
00:25:15.359 --> 00:25:19.310
sort of, uh, Lighthearted laugh at that idea because

447
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.390
it's such, to me, it's so obviously a category

448
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:26.319
error. That that that's not, there's no, I mean

449
00:25:26.319 --> 00:25:28.239
this is just, it's one of the most famous

450
00:25:28.239 --> 00:25:30.400
and quotable lines of Nietzsche. There are no moral

451
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.560
facts at all, only interpretations of the facts, but

452
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.000
he says it in a sentence because that's all

453
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.359
it is right there. It's, it's very, very obvious

454
00:25:37.359 --> 00:25:40.000
that a moral statement is, is in a different

455
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.430
category from describing. You know, uh, a, a, a

456
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.410
fact of the matter of a series of events.

457
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.670
Oh, OK, but wait a minute, because I'll probably

458
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.310
take advantage of what you said there to also

459
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:55.630
link it to the next topic. So, uh, when

460
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.989
he says that there's no, uh, moral facts, I

461
00:25:59.989 --> 00:26:05.030
mean, does he necessarily also extend that to all

462
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:09.199
kinds of facts? I mean, he's he. But basically,

463
00:26:09.449 --> 00:26:12.410
I, I, I mean, how does he approach uh

464
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:12.859
truth?

465
00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:18.170
Yeah, uh, so. I would say on the one

466
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.209
hand, so there is a note, there's an unpublished

467
00:26:20.209 --> 00:26:23.400
note. Where Nietzsche does say there are no facts,

468
00:26:23.479 --> 00:26:26.560
only interpretations, he actually takes the word moral out

469
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.640
and it does extend it to everything. But I

470
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.319
think that there is actually a difference, or else

471
00:26:33.319 --> 00:26:37.099
N Nietzsche, there is a difference between. Uh, TRYING

472
00:26:37.099 --> 00:26:41.140
to, uh, what would we say, articulate a state

473
00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:46.910
of affairs. Um, VERSUS articulate a moral interpretation of

474
00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:48.550
the state of affairs. If there wasn't a difference

475
00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.390
there, then Nietzsche wouldn't spend so much time as

476
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.630
he does calling himself an opponent of morality, saying

477
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.709
I am an immoralist, saying that the first task

478
00:26:56.709 --> 00:27:01.619
of Zarathustra is to annihilate the morality that, uh,

479
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:06.890
previously existed, something like that. Part, I think. There

480
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:08.650
are many, many ways to talk about this because

481
00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.650
it's, um, you can throw out all sorts of

482
00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.209
pithy statements about what Nietzsche believed, but it's almost

483
00:27:14.209 --> 00:27:15.959
always behooves you to get down into the weeds

484
00:27:15.959 --> 00:27:19.310
to really understand the nuance of what he's saying

485
00:27:19.969 --> 00:27:24.699
because as regards Zarathustra, for example. The reason why

486
00:27:24.699 --> 00:27:29.810
Zarathustra must attack the conventional morality is because there

487
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:33.530
is a moral element within our current view of

488
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:37.689
truth. Um, WE can see this, for example, in

489
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.589
Twilight of the Idols and The Four Great Arrows.

490
00:27:41.439 --> 00:27:43.199
Where Nietzsche says, like he makes a very, so

491
00:27:43.199 --> 00:27:46.180
we, we talked earlier about platonic view of being.

492
00:27:46.859 --> 00:27:48.459
Uh, THE truth is in the idea. It's fixed.

493
00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:51.949
It's, it's enduring. Why do we have such an

494
00:27:51.949 --> 00:27:54.540
idea? Well, in Twilight of Idols and the Four

495
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.949
Great Errors, Nietzsche says that essentially this view of

496
00:27:59.949 --> 00:28:02.510
the fixed idea of being is part of a

497
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:08.180
reflex that developed. As part of the um desire

498
00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:12.520
to impart moral responsibility onto the individual. Because the

499
00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:17.000
ego or formerly the soul is precisely that fixed

500
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.020
idea of the person, which then becomes a neutral

501
00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.510
substrate. That can sort of, is, is like, it's

502
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.979
like a little, it's like a wall or it's

503
00:28:25.979 --> 00:28:28.579
like a sluice gate between your impulses and the

504
00:28:28.579 --> 00:28:32.390
actions that you do. And uh it's this like

505
00:28:32.619 --> 00:28:37.300
fixed reasoning, uh, person, the self that can act

506
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:43.569
arbitrarily, that is a voluntarily governing force. And essentially

507
00:28:43.569 --> 00:28:47.040
Nietzsche says that is a that all of this

508
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.410
is a reflex of that need to be able

509
00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:53.569
to fix moral responsibility on human beings. Why would

510
00:28:53.569 --> 00:28:56.469
we need to fix moral responsibility on human beings?

511
00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:59.849
Well, because, uh, the, the need to be able

512
00:28:59.849 --> 00:29:03.410
to discipline and punish them, that this essentially is

513
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.650
part of a process of civilizing or culturating human

514
00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:11.689
beings. That requires that they be made responsible for

515
00:29:11.689 --> 00:29:15.589
their deeds. And uh I don't think that's necessarily

516
00:29:15.589 --> 00:29:21.569
the whole story. But there is. There is something

517
00:29:21.569 --> 00:29:23.729
about the fact that there is a moral demand

518
00:29:23.729 --> 00:29:26.010
at the basis of many of our metaphysical claims

519
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:30.130
that makes them. Unchallengeable that makes them actually that

520
00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:35.109
makes people unwilling to subject them to true inquiry,

521
00:29:35.329 --> 00:29:36.810
if I may be so bold as to talk

522
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.089
about like true inquiry versus false. And really what

523
00:29:39.089 --> 00:29:40.369
I mean by that is, and I've brought this

524
00:29:40.369 --> 00:29:42.170
up before when I talked about, for example, free

525
00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.709
will, because that's a core component of this idea.

526
00:29:45.199 --> 00:29:47.170
The self has free will. That's why it can

527
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.229
be held morally responsible. If you listen to figures,

528
00:29:50.349 --> 00:29:53.150
even people I greatly respect like Christopher Hitchens, when

529
00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:55.630
they bring up the free will idea, or Jordan

530
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.989
Peterson had a remark about this. Uh, I think

531
00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.849
to get into more lowbrow political commentary, uh, territory,

532
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:09.209
yeah, because Jordan Peterson is not the most reliable

533
00:30:09.209 --> 00:30:10.989
intellectual out there, I guess.

534
00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.069
No, no, no, no. Well, I was even about

535
00:30:13.069 --> 00:30:14.869
to go lower than that and say like Ben

536
00:30:14.869 --> 00:30:18.229
Shapiro and his debate with Alex O'Connor. They all

537
00:30:18.229 --> 00:30:22.449
make this claim though that. You, you can't question

538
00:30:22.449 --> 00:30:28.170
free will because of the, the moral like bulwark

539
00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.849
that it represents essentially like our whole legal institutions,

540
00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:36.170
our whole, uh, notions of human sovereignty and responsibility

541
00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.329
and duty and obligation are all based on this

542
00:30:38.329 --> 00:30:42.280
free will idea and or they'll just say, well,

543
00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:45.599
people already believe it anyway. And and they're gonna

544
00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:47.160
believe it no matter what, so you just shouldn't

545
00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.280
question it. That's a very strange. Attitude or orientation,

546
00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:54.660
we shouldn't even have the debate. Because either because

547
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.859
it's too dangerous or or people are just gonna

548
00:30:56.859 --> 00:30:58.300
believe it anyway. Is that, do we find that

549
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.750
acceptable in any sort of philosophical realm of debate?

550
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.780
Not generally, no, but Nietzsche would say the reason

551
00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.930
for that is that, so there's a, there's a

552
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:09.699
passage in, uh, I believe Will to Power, where

553
00:31:09.699 --> 00:31:12.660
he says, truth is the kind of error that

554
00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:18.650
we have found indispensable for life. And so he's

555
00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.739
making truth a kind of error, which is like,

556
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:26.150
they're fundamentally in the same category. So there are

557
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.910
truths, but what we call truths are not that

558
00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:32.790
platonic thing that's above the world. What they actually

559
00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:36.969
are, are. The operating assumptions that we have found

560
00:31:36.969 --> 00:31:39.810
that we cannot reason without or that we cannot

561
00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:43.609
function without. And when Nietzsche lists out these things,

562
00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.579
You know, oftentimes people will construe this as Nietzsche

563
00:31:46.579 --> 00:31:49.349
saying this is why we need like. You know,

564
00:31:49.729 --> 00:31:52.650
religious stories or some sort of enchantment of the

565
00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:57.390
world, that element is certainly there. But when he

566
00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.469
says, uh, in the gay science, he, he, he

567
00:32:00.469 --> 00:32:01.790
has a passage where he talks about the shadow

568
00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:05.109
of God. The shadow, when Buddha died, he left

569
00:32:05.109 --> 00:32:08.109
a terrifying shadow in the a monstrous shadow on

570
00:32:08.109 --> 00:32:11.150
the cave wall. So too, when God died, his

571
00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:13.550
shadow will endure for a long time. The very

572
00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:16.939
next passage, he says, He, he, he brings up,

573
00:32:16.959 --> 00:32:18.959
when will we vanquish all of these shadows of

574
00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:22.060
God? When will we de-deify our view of nature

575
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.780
and the world? But the things he lists are

576
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.560
for these indispensable errors, these shadows of God are

577
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:36.250
lines, forms, bodies, substance, cause and effect, duration. Essentially,

578
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.459
these concepts that Schopenhauer and Kant and many other

579
00:32:40.459 --> 00:32:44.339
German idealists had essentially said, These are prerequisites of

580
00:32:44.339 --> 00:32:47.540
even being able to reason at all. So Nietzsche

581
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.250
recognizes these for what they are. They're, they're again,

582
00:32:50.369 --> 00:32:54.439
they're pre-rational demands. They're valuations that in order for

583
00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:56.410
us to have this activity and operation of thinking

584
00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.290
for all the advantages that thinking gives us, that's

585
00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:01.069
another reason why he's not a simple irrationalist because

586
00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.489
N Nietzsche's project is involved with thinking and, and

587
00:33:03.489 --> 00:33:07.060
I would actually argue. The goals to the extent

588
00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.819
Nietzsche has goals of his project do involve sort

589
00:33:09.819 --> 00:33:12.969
of like a a transformation or overcoming of the

590
00:33:12.979 --> 00:33:18.089
current state of consciousness. But, uh, nevertheless. We have

591
00:33:18.089 --> 00:33:19.890
this series of assumptions that we have to make

592
00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:22.040
in order to to engage in conscious thinking that

593
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:27.079
are essentially unquestionable. And so, in a way, uh,

594
00:33:27.099 --> 00:33:30.089
to bring it back to your initial question. That

595
00:33:30.089 --> 00:33:32.530
would put all facts sort of in the category

596
00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.209
of interpretations, you might say, but he would say

597
00:33:35.209 --> 00:33:37.689
that the moral fact as we construe it is

598
00:33:37.689 --> 00:33:41.489
a special category because it actually prevents us from

599
00:33:41.489 --> 00:33:45.369
making, uh, well, it prevents us from, from questioning

600
00:33:45.369 --> 00:33:47.329
or interrogating those things. The other thing is it

601
00:33:47.329 --> 00:33:50.609
prevents us from making new evaluations, and that's the

602
00:33:50.609 --> 00:33:54.170
passage in thus book Zarathustra where he says, and

603
00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:57.569
the camel, the lion, the child passage to summarize.

604
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.829
That every thou shalt was once an I will.

605
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.329
That's the other thing about these things. Nietzsche says

606
00:34:03.329 --> 00:34:08.120
so oftentimes, the origin of like an idea that

607
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.659
we have or a belief is completely different from

608
00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.699
the function it begins to serve, and the whole

609
00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:14.688
reason why we begin to attribute such power and

610
00:34:14.688 --> 00:34:17.449
importance to the belief is precisely because we forgot

611
00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:21.728
the origin over long generations. So we forgot that.

612
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.899
When Jesus or Buddha or Plato or Manu or

613
00:34:26.899 --> 00:34:30.458
Confucius or Muhammad, these are all people, uh, or

614
00:34:30.458 --> 00:34:32.739
Saint Paul, Nietzsche has all listed these people as

615
00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:35.780
legislators of value, people who came in and made

616
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.300
a value judgment and gave us a new worldview.

617
00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:41.350
He said none of them doubted, they tried to

618
00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.179
make men moral, but none of them doubted that

619
00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:45.989
they had an absolute right to immorality. Why would

620
00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:49.228
that be? Well, because in the very act of.

621
00:34:50.388 --> 00:34:54.129
Legislating or imposing a new value on mankind. To

622
00:34:54.129 --> 00:34:58.510
do so consciously, you're aware that you're Uh, imposing

623
00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.659
an I will and turning it into a thou

624
00:35:00.659 --> 00:35:05.070
shalt, whereas, uh, in order to become believed, people

625
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:07.110
have to believe it came from on high or

626
00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.629
that it's an ancient idea or that it's, uh,

627
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:12.540
perhaps in Jungian language like a biological imperative or

628
00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:16.260
something like this. Nietzsche says, uh, essentially no, uh,

629
00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.500
that we, that's what happens when we forget the

630
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.570
origin was simply again, that evaluative judgment about life

631
00:35:23.229 --> 00:35:28.530
that. Was artfully interposed or mediated onto our world

632
00:35:28.669 --> 00:35:30.989
in order to try to improve mankind in some

633
00:35:30.989 --> 00:35:31.409
way,

634
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:35.189
so, you, you know, it's very interesting because actually

635
00:35:35.189 --> 00:35:39.709
with the knowledge we have today from disciplines like

636
00:35:39.709 --> 00:35:45.629
sociology and cognitive science, particularly those two, it's, it's

637
00:35:45.629 --> 00:35:51.250
not that hard to build a scientific case. Against,

638
00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:56.030
uh, objective truth and and even objective reality. I

639
00:35:56.030 --> 00:36:00.189
mean, uh, but, but particularly objective truth because, for

640
00:36:00.189 --> 00:36:05.310
example, in sociology, uh, there's a particular subdiscipline that

641
00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:09.989
is the sociology of of science that uh many

642
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.870
times people also connected to philosophy of science where

643
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:20.489
people have, uh, Studied how uh science is uh

644
00:36:20.489 --> 00:36:24.649
is just another human institution that is part of

645
00:36:24.909 --> 00:36:29.510
human society and that is, uh, permeable to all

646
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:33.909
different sorts of influences as any other insti uh

647
00:36:33.909 --> 00:36:37.959
as any other social institution is and it's, uh,

648
00:36:37.969 --> 00:36:41.189
you know, it, it gets influences from the social

649
00:36:41.189 --> 00:36:45.070
environment, the cultural. Environment and then particularly in the

650
00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:47.709
case of cognitive science, I've have a, I've, I

651
00:36:47.709 --> 00:36:51.580
have an interview on the show with Donald Hoffman.

652
00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:56.110
He's uh an evolutionary biologist and cognitive scientist, and

653
00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:58.629
he also delves a little bit into physics and

654
00:36:58.629 --> 00:37:01.070
he has a very interesting book, The Case Against

655
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:05.699
Reality. I mean, at a certain point, uh, I

656
00:37:05.709 --> 00:37:09.270
can't, I, I can no longer follow his Argument

657
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:14.330
because it gets really extremely abstract, but basically he

658
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:19.310
presents evidence as to how uh humans as other

659
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:23.610
animals, of course we we haven't evolved to uh

660
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:27.870
have an accurate picture or an accurate perception of

661
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:31.669
reality. Actually there are many ways, and he explains

662
00:37:31.669 --> 00:37:37.139
that in the book has um. If we are

663
00:37:37.139 --> 00:37:42.110
more distanced in terms of our perception from reality

664
00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:45.429
itself, it serves us better because we just pay

665
00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:51.590
attention to specific ways that our nervous systems represent

666
00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:56.030
reality that are useful from an evolutionary perspective to

667
00:37:56.030 --> 00:38:00.466
serve the purpose of. Surviving and reproducing. Uh, I'm,

668
00:38:00.545 --> 00:38:04.045
uh, but then, I mean, he gets into, uh,

669
00:38:04.055 --> 00:38:07.645
physics and he, he also starts saying that even

670
00:38:08.105 --> 00:38:12.946
space-time itself is not part of objective reality, it's

671
00:38:12.946 --> 00:38:16.426
also a construct of our minds and then he

672
00:38:16.426 --> 00:38:22.062
starts talking about a geometric. Figures that supposedly are

673
00:38:22.062 --> 00:38:26.382
what constitute objective reality, things that people study in

674
00:38:26.382 --> 00:38:30.822
physics, and that's where he loses me, not because

675
00:38:30.822 --> 00:38:33.862
I, I don't think that he might be, he

676
00:38:33.862 --> 00:38:36.201
might be right about that. It's just that I

677
00:38:36.422 --> 00:38:39.302
don't know enough of physics to really evaluate that

678
00:38:39.302 --> 00:38:43.110
evidence properly. But then, Uh, I've also had, uh,

679
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.600
recently an interview with Marina Dubova. She's a cognitive

680
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.639
scientist from the Santa Fe Institute. I, I haven't

681
00:38:49.639 --> 00:38:53.719
released that interview yet, but, uh, we basically talked

682
00:38:53.719 --> 00:39:00.360
about how through our, basically studying our cognitive limitations,

683
00:39:00.439 --> 00:39:06.199
our cognitive biases, um, I mean, we know that.

684
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:10.280
What we do through science, the kind of knowledge

685
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:15.560
we produce through science, does not correspond to objective

686
00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:19.239
reality, and I even asked her if we could

687
00:39:19.239 --> 00:39:23.520
tie that to the ideas coming from Kent, for

688
00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.040
example, uh, I mean, the idea that we don't

689
00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:31.189
really have direct access to. The objective reality or

690
00:39:31.189 --> 00:39:34.189
what he would call the noumenon, and we just

691
00:39:34.189 --> 00:39:37.629
have access to the phenomenon or the, the world

692
00:39:37.629 --> 00:39:41.260
as representation as Schopenhauer would call it, and she,

693
00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.590
and she said, yes, that, uh, that, that's actually

694
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:50.429
very reasonable, um, and, and basically, I mean, science

695
00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:54.179
or I mean, assuming, and I think it's true

696
00:39:54.179 --> 00:39:58.439
that science is still the best tool that we

697
00:39:58.439 --> 00:40:00.820
have, the best epistemic tool that we have at

698
00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:05.060
our disposal to try step by step to get

699
00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:09.939
closer to wherever objective reality is. I mean, the

700
00:40:09.939 --> 00:40:15.770
knowledge produced by science is not actually about. Objective

701
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:22.649
reality itself because it's circumscribed to our cognitive limitations,

702
00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:26.409
the, the limitations of our perception, uh, the fact

703
00:40:26.409 --> 00:40:30.129
that it's influenced by society and culture in different

704
00:40:30.129 --> 00:40:34.790
ways, and then there's also the incentives that operate

705
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:37.334
within the institution of science and so on. On

706
00:40:37.334 --> 00:40:39.135
and so forth. I mean, there, there are many

707
00:40:39.135 --> 00:40:43.165
different sources of scientific evidence that we can point

708
00:40:43.165 --> 00:40:48.524
to, to actually build a case that would be

709
00:40:48.534 --> 00:40:53.534
more or less in line with um the uh

710
00:40:53.534 --> 00:40:57.534
the perspective uh Nietzsche had or the approach he

711
00:40:57.534 --> 00:41:00.294
had to uh truth, so.

712
00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:03.870
Yeah, it was funny before you mentioned uh Donald

713
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.889
Hoffman. That was actually exactly who I was thinking

714
00:41:05.889 --> 00:41:09.129
of, um, which is interesting because he's, he's an

715
00:41:09.129 --> 00:41:11.909
idealist, isn't he? Like, uh, or, or he's non,

716
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.439
uh,

717
00:41:12.449 --> 00:41:16.689
I mean he, he, he talks about conscious realism.

718
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.195
I, I mean that's one of the. Weirdest ideas

719
00:41:19.195 --> 00:41:21.754
coming from him, at least for me personally, because

720
00:41:21.754 --> 00:41:24.824
he also, he's also friends with Deepak Chopra, and,

721
00:41:24.864 --> 00:41:27.034
and I mean I don't want by saying that

722
00:41:27.034 --> 00:41:31.074
I'm not dismissing his scientific credibility or any of

723
00:41:31.074 --> 00:41:34.735
that. Donald Hoffman is a legit scientist. It's just

724
00:41:34.735 --> 00:41:38.270
that. I mean, I don't know that idea that

725
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:45.860
it's us through our collective consciousness that construct the

726
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:51.110
version of reality we have access to. Uh, I

727
00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:54.350
mean, maybe, but I'm not sure what that means

728
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:57.429
exactly. Well, I think the most compelling way that

729
00:41:57.429 --> 00:42:00.780
I've heard him put it is that. You know,

730
00:42:00.909 --> 00:42:05.219
we could, we can look at the behavior of,

731
00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:07.709
uh, you know, we can study protons and electrons

732
00:42:07.709 --> 00:42:11.110
under a microscope, an incredibly powerful microscope, and then

733
00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:15.629
we can develop the mathematical formula that shows that

734
00:42:15.629 --> 00:42:18.300
will predict their movements, and we can look at,

735
00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.949
you know, you combine these atoms, you get this

736
00:42:19.949 --> 00:42:22.669
molecule, and so on and so forth. But he

737
00:42:22.669 --> 00:42:26.580
says that what essentially we forget. Is that what

738
00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.520
we're looking at is actually a pixel. He uses

739
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.340
that analogy of uh a pixel on, you know,

740
00:42:33.449 --> 00:42:37.580
your computer screen that the pixel is not actually

741
00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:41.760
the thing itself, it's a representation of it and

742
00:42:43.179 --> 00:42:48.100
that. I think N Nietzsche has an interesting position

743
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:52.610
on this because there's a passage in the gay

744
00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:54.699
science, I believe it's right at the beginning of

745
00:42:54.699 --> 00:42:58.370
book two. Where he talks about people who call

746
00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:01.489
themselves realists, he's referring to sort of like scientific

747
00:43:01.489 --> 00:43:05.439
realists or people who call themselves atomists. He goes

748
00:43:05.439 --> 00:43:08.320
at them and beyond good and evil. And he

749
00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.080
says, you know, look at that cloud there, that

750
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.320
tree. What is, what is real in it? If

751
00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.189
you separate out everything about our perception of it,

752
00:43:15.479 --> 00:43:19.520
what would remain over? And this is actually It's

753
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.080
interesting. It shows Nietzsche's roots from the German idealist

754
00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.080
tradition, but we can even go to like pure

755
00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.959
idealism like Bishop Berkeley, um, who essentially makes the

756
00:43:27.959 --> 00:43:32.479
same argument, like, right, like, uh, every quality that

757
00:43:32.479 --> 00:43:34.399
you assign to an object and say that's an

758
00:43:34.399 --> 00:43:36.919
objective fact about it is something that comes to

759
00:43:36.919 --> 00:43:39.959
you through your senses. So it's, it's sort of

760
00:43:39.959 --> 00:43:43.560
almost like a Zen question to ask, like, what

761
00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.669
is, you know, what is this coffee cup. If

762
00:43:47.669 --> 00:43:50.040
I can't see it, touch it, taste the coffee

763
00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.560
in it, uh, you know, feel it with my

764
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.719
hand, if all of those senses were denied to

765
00:43:54.719 --> 00:43:57.120
me, what is the thing in itself? What are

766
00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.040
we even talking about at that point? What is

767
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.520
the objective reality that we are talking about? And

768
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:06.179
I think. The issue with like the the philosophy

769
00:44:06.179 --> 00:44:10.709
behind science today, I think Nietzsche would say, It's

770
00:44:10.709 --> 00:44:13.979
not The fact that they're doing physics, it's that

771
00:44:13.979 --> 00:44:18.229
they have an implicit and unarticulated metaphysics behind what

772
00:44:18.229 --> 00:44:21.469
they're doing, that what they're uncovering is this like

773
00:44:21.469 --> 00:44:24.340
objective truth that the key thing is that it's

774
00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.919
independent of the human mind and. One of the

775
00:44:27.919 --> 00:44:32.399
things that Klein said, the analytic philosopher, is that

776
00:44:32.399 --> 00:44:36.300
essentially, there's like a an implicit commitment to Plato,

777
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:40.540
once again, with this notion of like mathematical laws,

778
00:44:40.879 --> 00:44:46.739
or sort of uh physical constants. That we have,

779
00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:50.169
we're now committed to this idea of immaterial things.

780
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:55.229
That nevertheless endure and persist in all times and

781
00:44:55.229 --> 00:44:58.629
all places, regardless of our perception of them and

782
00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:01.270
that these represent the real like truth of the

783
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.229
world. That's what people say like math is the

784
00:45:03.229 --> 00:45:05.629
language of the universe, something like that. They've cracked

785
00:45:05.629 --> 00:45:08.580
the code, they're seeing the matrix. And I think

786
00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.959
What I would say to the scientific realists is

787
00:45:11.959 --> 00:45:16.070
like, We Nietzscheans or or or Nietzsche himself, we're

788
00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:19.429
not attacking the efficacy of science or the the

789
00:45:19.489 --> 00:45:24.080
the worth of science for us. What we're attacking

790
00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.830
is this notion that you're decoding the matrix by

791
00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:29.840
doing science because you've never left this world of

792
00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:33.639
pixels and therefore all the mathematical constants that you

793
00:45:33.639 --> 00:45:37.899
find in that world. Might just be errors. You,

794
00:45:37.959 --> 00:45:40.580
you have no idea. Like it's essentially, and it

795
00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.320
is the comparison to the Kantian Numenon, I think,

796
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:46.379
is very apt, uh, so that would be my

797
00:45:46.379 --> 00:45:47.280
position on that.

798
00:45:48.139 --> 00:45:50.340
Yeah, and I mean, I guess that to a

799
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.659
certain extent, I don't know if you would agree

800
00:45:52.659 --> 00:45:54.979
with me on this point or not, and I

801
00:45:54.979 --> 00:45:58.820
guess that, I, I remember at least a few

802
00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:05.350
passages in Nietzsche where he talks about. Um, THE

803
00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:11.270
scientists, the artists, uh, um, the aesthetics, and, and

804
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:15.449
basically I think if I remember correctly attribute certain

805
00:46:15.449 --> 00:46:20.070
traits that are common to them, and one of

806
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:22.469
them, uh, or I'm, I'm not sure if I'm

807
00:46:22.469 --> 00:46:25.570
going to talk about the traits, but basically, um,

808
00:46:25.629 --> 00:46:29.949
the idea is that, uh, scientists have sort of

809
00:46:29.949 --> 00:46:35.870
inherited. From, uh, religion, in this particular case, uh,

810
00:46:35.889 --> 00:46:41.409
Judeo-Christian religion, the idea that there's a roof with

811
00:46:41.409 --> 00:46:45.889
a capital T out there to be uncovered and

812
00:46:45.889 --> 00:46:48.729
that, uh, I mean nowadays we no longer have

813
00:46:48.729 --> 00:46:51.610
that sort of perspective, but particularly in the early

814
00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:55.810
days of the Enlightenment, there was this idealistic view

815
00:46:55.810 --> 00:47:01.810
of reason that just threw. uh, JUST by reasoning,

816
00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.989
just through pure reason. I mean, I'm not using

817
00:47:04.989 --> 00:47:08.739
the, necessarily the Kantian term here, but just by

818
00:47:08.739 --> 00:47:12.409
using reason and by applying reason itself, you could

819
00:47:12.409 --> 00:47:16.500
arrive at the, the truth. I mean, now, uh

820
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:20.090
it's not uh it is uh like that, that

821
00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:24.530
science works, of course, we have, uh, empirical studies

822
00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:27.320
and all of that, but I mean, it seems

823
00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:36.590
that it remains in the Epistemology of most scientists,

824
00:47:36.909 --> 00:47:41.270
uh, some, uh, I, I mean, uh, I mean

825
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:45.949
something that comes originally from religion in the sense

826
00:47:45.949 --> 00:47:51.429
that they tend to approach science as uncovering objective

827
00:47:51.429 --> 00:47:55.070
truth or truth with a capital T and not

828
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:59.979
a method or um. A collection of methods that

829
00:47:59.979 --> 00:48:04.659
we have at our disposal to construct um the

830
00:48:04.659 --> 00:48:09.340
truth or construct scientific knowledge because scientific knowledge is

831
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:16.840
a socio-cultural construct. It's not about whatever objective truth

832
00:48:16.979 --> 00:48:19.040
means. I mean, what, what do you think about

833
00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:19.300
that?

834
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.729
Um, THE only thing I would be careful about

835
00:48:22.729 --> 00:48:27.590
would be the sociocultural construct element of it, because

836
00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:31.770
It, I'm not necessarily going to say that that's

837
00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:33.489
not true, but I, I guess I would say

838
00:48:33.489 --> 00:48:35.689
that I think when many people hear that, the

839
00:48:35.689 --> 00:48:39.669
connotation of that is sort of like. You know,

840
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:42.750
perhaps if we were in a different culture with

841
00:48:42.889 --> 00:48:44.000
different perspectives, OK,

842
00:48:44.129 --> 00:48:44.879
I, I know what we

843
00:48:44.879 --> 00:48:47.129
might come to different truths or something like that,

844
00:48:47.209 --> 00:48:50.290
and I, I think Nietzsche might even go more

845
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:53.250
fundamentally and say there might even just be errors

846
00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:56.570
that are proper to human perception as such, without

847
00:48:56.570 --> 00:49:01.639
which we cannot reason. And that essentially uh. Yeah,

848
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.949
he does say there's a passage in the gay

849
00:49:03.949 --> 00:49:08.209
science, uh. Where he says it's still a a

850
00:49:09.229 --> 00:49:12.379
metaphysical faith upon which our faith in science rests,

851
00:49:12.669 --> 00:49:15.229
which was also the faith of Plato that God

852
00:49:15.229 --> 00:49:17.989
is truth and truth is divine. I wouldn't take

853
00:49:17.989 --> 00:49:20.989
that as necessarily saying, you know, like the West

854
00:49:20.989 --> 00:49:23.830
has a particular tradition that's been influenced by Plato.

855
00:49:23.909 --> 00:49:25.379
I, I mean, again, I know people can make

856
00:49:25.379 --> 00:49:27.989
these claims, and there is actually something interesting again

857
00:49:27.989 --> 00:49:30.149
to go back to the idea of like the

858
00:49:30.149 --> 00:49:32.669
original Greek view versus the Platonic view because again

859
00:49:32.669 --> 00:49:34.830
in the Cratal list, one of the things that

860
00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:38.985
Socrates says. Is that actually the Greek language emphasizes

861
00:49:38.985 --> 00:49:43.304
movement and becoming, and that's its mistake from Socrates'

862
00:49:43.304 --> 00:49:46.344
point of view, whereas Nietzsche might say that's exactly

863
00:49:46.344 --> 00:49:48.945
what I like about, uh, you know, the Greek

864
00:49:48.945 --> 00:49:52.185
language. And so when I've studied Chinese philosophy, you

865
00:49:52.185 --> 00:49:59.560
do, uh, perhaps have certain hidden assumptions or Just

866
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.159
operating assumptions contained within the language that are that

867
00:50:03.159 --> 00:50:05.399
artifacts of the culture that might affect how you

868
00:50:05.399 --> 00:50:10.199
how you see reality. But ultimately, I think. I

869
00:50:10.199 --> 00:50:13.800
think there is a sort of pre-rational intelligibility, or

870
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.590
sorry, pre-linguistic intelligibility that human beings can come to,

871
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.889
but that doesn't, people often construe that. Into insofar,

872
00:50:22.929 --> 00:50:25.290
right, it's like somebody from China or, or Greece

873
00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:27.610
or presumably even if we could go with the

874
00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:30.050
time machine and go back to Pythagoras, you could

875
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:31.729
show them the same set of equations and if

876
00:50:31.729 --> 00:50:35.040
they were mathematically sophisticated enough, could communicate that way,

877
00:50:35.129 --> 00:50:36.889
right? That's what people mean when they're saying it's

878
00:50:36.889 --> 00:50:40.120
like the universal language. But I think uh Nietzsche

879
00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.959
would say that there there may be elements of

880
00:50:43.959 --> 00:50:49.879
just human cognition. Uh, THAT simply cannot be again

881
00:50:49.879 --> 00:50:52.320
reduced out or, or, or sifted out of our

882
00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.870
perception that are going to be shared by all

883
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:57.760
and people will then extrapolate this. That was the

884
00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.679
point I was sort of getting to people extrapolate

885
00:50:59.679 --> 00:51:02.320
this into. You know, it's a very common argument

886
00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:05.020
you'll hear in favor of the objectivity of the

887
00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.100
sciences, even if they don't use the truth with

888
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.939
the capital T language anymore, but that there is

889
00:51:10.939 --> 00:51:13.060
a fact of the matter. I can perceive this.

890
00:51:13.179 --> 00:51:15.300
If so and so perceived this, he would come

891
00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.020
to the same thing. They would come to the

892
00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.939
same conclusion if they ran this experiment, um, you

893
00:51:19.939 --> 00:51:22.379
know, the famous, uh, Ricky Gervais, burn all the

894
00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:24.219
holy books, they would all be different when they

895
00:51:24.219 --> 00:51:27.409
get rewritten, burn all the science books, they'd all

896
00:51:27.409 --> 00:51:31.439
be the same. But, you know, again, that doesn't

897
00:51:31.439 --> 00:51:33.790
ever, I think people really need to understand this,

898
00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:37.199
and it's not a trivial point. That doesn't ever

899
00:51:37.199 --> 00:51:41.030
get you over the chasm to the pneumenon to

900
00:51:41.139 --> 00:51:43.719
to glimpsing the true world. All that tells you

901
00:51:43.719 --> 00:51:46.040
is that all humans perceive the world the same

902
00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:51.149
way. That's all it tells you. And uh Nietzsche,

903
00:51:51.229 --> 00:51:53.520
for his part, see that's the thing is. You

904
00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.239
know, I can imagine people saying, so what, there's

905
00:51:55.239 --> 00:51:58.199
no truth? Oh no, that's not Nietzsche's attitude. He

906
00:51:58.199 --> 00:52:01.879
says in the aphorism how the true world finally

907
00:52:01.879 --> 00:52:05.469
became a fable. The true world, this notion of

908
00:52:05.469 --> 00:52:09.929
the true truth beyond human perception. No longer holds

909
00:52:09.929 --> 00:52:13.659
any uh significance to us. It no longer motivates

910
00:52:13.659 --> 00:52:15.770
us, it no longer does anything for us. What

911
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:17.689
does it do for us to believe in, you

912
00:52:17.689 --> 00:52:22.800
know, This sort of ontology that science is discovering

913
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.510
the true world. What does that actually do? It

914
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:26.870
does nothing. It has nothing to do with the

915
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:31.199
actual work of science, which includes continually falsifying and

916
00:52:31.199 --> 00:52:34.560
doubting what you hold to be true. So why

917
00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.120
don't we just do that work? That's why Nietzsche

918
00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.560
says long live physics. And so he also says,

919
00:52:38.719 --> 00:52:41.439
let's abolish the true world. Doesn't, it's not useful

920
00:52:41.439 --> 00:52:44.919
anymore. What, what's left, the illusory world is no,

921
00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:48.969
we abolished this notion. That appearance is illusory, along

922
00:52:48.969 --> 00:52:51.489
with this notion of the true world. So, we

923
00:52:51.489 --> 00:52:55.360
just accept as the world is the world of

924
00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.729
human sensation. And so yeah, if you want to

925
00:52:57.729 --> 00:53:00.689
just say then it's true, fine, but when people

926
00:53:00.689 --> 00:53:03.149
want to fix this like sort of objective notion

927
00:53:03.149 --> 00:53:06.580
to it. They're trying to go beyond human knowledge

928
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:10.800
and. You know, there is You could see how

929
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.439
that's a, it's a religious or it's a mystical

930
00:53:13.439 --> 00:53:15.639
impulse in a way. So yeah.

931
00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:18.699
Uh, YEAH, you know, I, I guess that if

932
00:53:18.699 --> 00:53:21.340
you're not familiar with it, I guess you would

933
00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:26.780
like the Dutch approach to cognitive science and psychology

934
00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:30.139
because, uh, I, I'm not sure why they have

935
00:53:30.139 --> 00:53:33.780
that in the Netherlands, but for some reason in

936
00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:39.820
their universities, they teach dynamical systems theory instead of

937
00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:44.366
the more mainstream approach. To cognitive science and psychology,

938
00:53:44.406 --> 00:53:47.086
and I've even had uh two interviews on the

939
00:53:47.086 --> 00:53:51.447
show with both authors of a book called Toward

940
00:53:51.447 --> 00:53:56.636
the Process Approaching Psychology, Stepping into Eric Leus's River,

941
00:53:56.646 --> 00:53:59.207
and I mean, just the subtitle tells you a

942
00:53:59.207 --> 00:54:03.007
lot because they basically, uh, they talk about the

943
00:54:03.007 --> 00:54:07.166
difference between the substance ontology and the process on.

944
00:54:07.464 --> 00:54:10.833
Ontology in the specific case of cognitive science and

945
00:54:10.833 --> 00:54:15.874
they uh critique basically uh the limitations of a

946
00:54:15.874 --> 00:54:20.313
substance ontology as we have it in mainstream cognitive

947
00:54:20.313 --> 00:54:25.434
science and psychology in the West particularly, and they

948
00:54:25.434 --> 00:54:29.134
suggest that the process ontology that is instead of

949
00:54:29.434 --> 00:54:34.781
uh a thing instead of what Exists being things.

950
00:54:35.141 --> 00:54:37.581
It's uh I mean there are no things, there

951
00:54:37.581 --> 00:54:41.460
are just uh processes and so, uh, I mean

952
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:44.220
the, in the book they talk a lot about

953
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:51.020
that and how um a process ontology via dynamical

954
00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:56.900
systems theory would approach different questions in psychology, for

955
00:54:56.900 --> 00:55:00.659
example, so I, I mean, I guess that's particularly

956
00:55:00.659 --> 00:55:05.340
since they also mentioned Heraclitus, uh, you, you would

957
00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:09.399
be that kind of approach would interest you.

958
00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:12.060
Yeah, no, it, it definitely would, for sure, for

959
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.409
sure. I, I, that's amazing to see Heraclitus, uh,

960
00:55:15.419 --> 00:55:20.100
helping with an understanding of, uh, yeah, and you

961
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:23.169
said that's been like, that's just sort of. Being

962
00:55:23.169 --> 00:55:26.350
taught in in uh the Netherlands, like,

963
00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:29.090
yeah, I mean, I, I don't know why. I

964
00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:34.729
interviewed a, a Portuguese philosopher, um, a compatriot of

965
00:55:34.729 --> 00:55:40.530
mine, uh, Inezipolito. She also has a, um, dynamical

966
00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:45.129
systems theory approach to, uh, the philosophy of cognitive

967
00:55:45.129 --> 00:55:48.399
science, and she told me it was she who

968
00:55:48.399 --> 00:55:52.399
told me that in the Netherlands. I mean, I

969
00:55:52.399 --> 00:55:54.919
don't, I don't know what's the reason. I don't,

970
00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.040
I didn't ask her. I, I should have done

971
00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.760
that, but anyway. Uh, BUT she told me that

972
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:04.439
in the Netherlands, for some reason they teach that

973
00:56:04.439 --> 00:56:08.959
in university instead of the more, uh, traditional or

974
00:56:08.959 --> 00:56:12.760
mainstream approach in cognitive science and psychology, so I,

975
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.639
I don't, I don't know what's the, the cultural

976
00:56:16.639 --> 00:56:18.280
influences there, but anyway,

977
00:56:18.399 --> 00:56:20.800
yeah, I wouldn't have guessed the Dutch, which would

978
00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.110
be the, the, the, the bleeding edge of that,

979
00:56:23.159 --> 00:56:24.760
that field, but yeah.

980
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:28.419
Yeah, OK, so let, let me ask you about

981
00:56:28.429 --> 00:56:31.300
politics. I, I mean, I know that there's that

982
00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:36.590
Hugo Droshon book on Nietzsche's politics. I, I haven't

983
00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:39.510
read it yet, so I'm not sure if he

984
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:43.149
actually tackles this, this kind of subject there or

985
00:56:43.149 --> 00:56:47.659
not, but What do you think, uh, how do

986
00:56:47.659 --> 00:56:52.659
you think Nietzsche would have reacted to particular, uh,

987
00:56:52.739 --> 00:56:57.899
political movements and ideologies that formed during the 20th

988
00:56:57.899 --> 00:57:05.540
century like, uh, communism, fascism, social democracy, and neoliberal

989
00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.379
capitalism. Have, have you thought of that?

990
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:14.100
Yes, I think that, uh, well, This, this, I'll

991
00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:17.100
give a flippant, glib answer and then I will

992
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.739
explain it. Uh, IT'S all the same thing would

993
00:57:19.739 --> 00:57:23.370
be sort of his initial response. These are all

994
00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:27.750
ideologies that are inconceivable outside of the democratic enlightenment,

995
00:57:28.149 --> 00:57:34.250
the notion of, uh, communism or fascism, they both,

996
00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:39.149
uh, depend on this sort of, uh. Fundamentally this

997
00:57:39.149 --> 00:57:41.669
idea for one of partisan politics, we're going to

998
00:57:41.669 --> 00:57:44.510
form a party. Whether it's the vanguard party of

999
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:48.530
the proletarian revolution or uh the party, the nationalist

1000
00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:50.409
party that's going to safeguard the nation of the

1001
00:57:50.409 --> 00:57:55.129
race. Um The same would be true of social

1002
00:57:55.129 --> 00:57:58.659
democracy or or or neoliberal capitalism. Now, are there

1003
00:57:58.659 --> 00:58:02.219
differences between them? Yes. Uh, ARE there very important

1004
00:58:02.219 --> 00:58:06.270
differences from like our moral or political? See, this

1005
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:08.739
is the thing. So oftentimes, uh, the way that

1006
00:58:08.739 --> 00:58:13.300
we understand these like historical forms of, uh. Like

1007
00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:17.060
political movements that they really refer us back to

1008
00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.620
the current day and what our political agenda is

1009
00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:21.469
now and that's going to affect how we interpret

1010
00:58:21.469 --> 00:58:24.350
many of these things that have developed, but essentially,

1011
00:58:24.419 --> 00:58:29.870
so what is Nietzsche's project and Nietzsche, you know,

1012
00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:32.520
to really get down to to almost like a.

1013
00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:40.780
A deep biological, um, like supposition of Nietzsches. WOULD

1014
00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:45.219
be his opposition to Darwin. Uh, N Nietzsche obviously

1015
00:58:45.219 --> 00:58:48.239
believes in evolution. He believes in a naturalistic, uh,

1016
00:58:48.459 --> 00:58:51.149
account of how human beings came to be. But

1017
00:58:51.149 --> 00:58:53.709
he says that everywhere I see prevailing the exact

1018
00:58:53.709 --> 00:58:57.409
opposite of the state of affairs that Darwin says

1019
00:58:57.550 --> 00:59:02.560
would unfold, that the fittest will survive, the strong

1020
00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:06.199
will flourish, that uh the strong will then predominate,

1021
00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:09.530
and they will, because they're stronger and more adept

1022
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:12.820
at surviving, they will then multiply and become the

1023
00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:16.040
dominant species. You have this sort of uh process

1024
00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.840
of the exception becoming the rule, right? The mutation

1025
00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.280
changing the genome and, and, uh, you know, creating

1026
00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:25.090
a new species. Now, Is that possible? Yes, but

1027
00:59:25.090 --> 00:59:27.520
what N Nietzsche says is that's everywhere the exception.

1028
00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:32.129
What he sees is the weak predominating. What he

1029
00:59:32.129 --> 00:59:36.189
sees is, uh, the, the species has a tendency

1030
00:59:36.189 --> 00:59:43.570
to, to proliferate many identical, uh, like individually rather

1031
00:59:43.570 --> 00:59:46.949
unimpressive members. We might think of like colonies of

1032
00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.179
of bees or ants or something like that. They're

1033
00:59:49.179 --> 00:59:54.340
basically interchangeable. They're basically just instruments. Of the social

1034
00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:57.100
unit or of the the species or organism as

1035
00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:01.159
a whole. And whenever a species sort of depends

1036
01:00:01.159 --> 01:00:05.919
on rare, powerful, extraordinary individuals for its advancement, if

1037
01:00:05.919 --> 01:00:07.679
we can even imagine what that would be, Nietzsche

1038
01:00:07.679 --> 01:00:09.620
says that puts them in a precarious and dangerous

1039
01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:12.459
position. And he says the same thing is true

1040
01:00:12.459 --> 01:00:14.479
with humanity. So this is like a very, like,

1041
01:00:14.979 --> 01:00:17.020
it's a very deep claim that Nietzsche's making. It's

1042
01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:20.260
not just about like oftentimes people sort of construe

1043
01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:22.500
Nietzsche as just being in the category of people

1044
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:27.479
like. You know, McIntyre or Carlyle or or these

1045
01:00:27.479 --> 01:00:31.129
like uh stuffy old reactionaries very angry about the

1046
01:00:31.129 --> 01:00:35.100
French Revolution. Um, N Nietzsche would say this is

1047
01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:37.870
an eternal story, and that one of the great

1048
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:41.030
differences with Darwin is that N Nietzsche stands on

1049
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:42.669
the side of the exception, but he doesn't think

1050
01:00:42.669 --> 01:00:45.929
the exception ever becomes the rule. What the rule

1051
01:00:45.929 --> 01:00:51.020
is for human beings. Is herdishness, the herd morality.

1052
01:00:51.899 --> 01:00:54.419
Now there's Nietzsche obviously has this whole genealogy of

1053
01:00:54.419 --> 01:00:56.219
morals where he talks about slave morality, but I

1054
01:00:56.219 --> 01:01:02.090
think it's justified to say. That the herd herdishness

1055
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:07.080
or herd morality actually precedes resentiment and slave morality.

1056
01:01:07.169 --> 01:01:09.649
It exists before and it exists after it. Christianity

1057
01:01:09.649 --> 01:01:12.870
is just like the most particularly like virulent form

1058
01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:17.350
of the herd morality. It's the herd's sort of

1059
01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:20.729
revenge against life and against the world in a

1060
01:01:20.729 --> 01:01:23.250
way. It's a devaluation of the physical world. That's

1061
01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:25.439
how Nietzsche views Christianity. That's really what I'm talking

1062
01:01:25.439 --> 01:01:27.409
about here for people who haven't read the genealogy.

1063
01:01:28.489 --> 01:01:30.409
Uh, AND we can go into that if you

1064
01:01:30.409 --> 01:01:32.810
like, but I would say that especially if you

1065
01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:35.570
read the gay Science, it becomes very, very clear.

1066
01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:40.139
That he thinks it's part of. What we might

1067
01:01:40.139 --> 01:01:44.020
say like the power of the social unit, the

1068
01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:48.580
organism to instrumentalize and turn all of its individuals

1069
01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:56.129
into a function. That Essentially people who violate or

1070
01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:59.969
ignore or represent a challenge to the preexisting moral

1071
01:01:59.969 --> 01:02:05.040
regime. The norm for them is to be crushed.

1072
01:02:05.729 --> 01:02:08.729
There are, there's that Japanese proverb that it's the

1073
01:02:08.729 --> 01:02:12.620
tallest blade of grass that is cut. Perfect, perfect

1074
01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:14.620
example. People will talk about the, the crabs in

1075
01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:17.389
the bucket or something like that. But that's not,

1076
01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:19.659
see, Nietzsche would say, OK, but it's not just,

1077
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:21.729
see, the crabs in the bucket, that's like risottomon,

1078
01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:27.709
that's just like meaningless, uh, or, or totally unproductive,

1079
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:32.550
um. Hatred of the exception and the extraordinary, right?

1080
01:02:32.669 --> 01:02:35.330
Uh, THAT'S the form it eventually begins to take.

1081
01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:37.469
But Nietzsche would say, no, there's actually like a

1082
01:02:37.469 --> 01:02:41.030
very good and we might say productive reason from

1083
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:43.590
the point of view of the average, the lowest

1084
01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:46.629
common denominator, the unremarkable person, the person who follows

1085
01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:49.850
the rule. There, it actually suits their advantage to

1086
01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:53.830
impose this moral regime and try and um fight

1087
01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:56.399
against the people who would represent a rupture to

1088
01:02:56.399 --> 01:03:02.310
it. And so that's how he understands, uh, fundamentally

1089
01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:06.649
something like democracy and he would see the element

1090
01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:10.570
of democracy in fascism as well as in communism.

1091
01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.399
And that what they attempt to do is that

1092
01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:17.639
they propose a sort of ideal. So again, we

1093
01:03:17.639 --> 01:03:20.320
have like a fixed idea. It might be a

1094
01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:25.179
fixed idea, a fixed moral idea of what the

1095
01:03:25.959 --> 01:03:29.479
proper universal destiny of humanity is. It might be

1096
01:03:29.479 --> 01:03:32.070
a fixed idea of the nation or of the,

1097
01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.739
the state itself in the case of say Mussolini

1098
01:03:35.439 --> 01:03:38.120
might be a fixed idea of the race. That's

1099
01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.280
the other interesting thing about Nietzsche is that. He's

1100
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:46.550
totally incompatible with pretty much any like modern day

1101
01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:51.080
racial theory because he's anti-essentialist. So people believe there's

1102
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:56.300
an essential notion of what constitutes a race. Uh,

1103
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:58.300
THAT'S the only, you have to start from that

1104
01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:02.939
sort of like metaphysics of like human biology, if

1105
01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:04.840
you want to get to this notion of preserving

1106
01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.939
a race, right? And that's why, you know, in

1107
01:04:07.939 --> 01:04:11.949
fascism. Uh, THEY had all sorts of occults and

1108
01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:15.949
esoteric theories about the origin of, uh, different human

1109
01:04:15.949 --> 01:04:19.909
groups that was actually very anti-naturalistic that, you know,

1110
01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:22.350
we all came from like different origins and they

1111
01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:25.790
were originally like pure, and then they become deluded

1112
01:04:26.149 --> 01:04:28.320
and that's what leads to this current state of

1113
01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.889
degradation. It's actually very interesting. Uh, IT'S not a

1114
01:04:31.889 --> 01:04:36.239
racialist theory, but it like, Uh, Evela, the man

1115
01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:40.550
for whom the fascists weren't right wing enough. Essentially

1116
01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:43.949
believes that uh he he he has this ideology

1117
01:04:43.949 --> 01:04:45.909
of traditionalism and it's sort of the same idea.

1118
01:04:45.959 --> 01:04:49.689
Like originally there was one tradition that was pure,

1119
01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:52.270
that was like the truth, and then all of

1120
01:04:52.270 --> 01:04:54.669
like the old religious traditions, they sort of like

1121
01:04:54.669 --> 01:04:56.590
break off of it, but they reflect like something

1122
01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:59.229
of that tradition and like what you should do

1123
01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.929
as a modern person is like, Even though you

1124
01:05:01.929 --> 01:05:03.500
might not be able to square the circle of

1125
01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.340
all the superstitions and contradictions, you should just follow

1126
01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.209
your tradition because it is a pathway to truth.

1127
01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.620
You shouldn't try to syncretize and mix them all

1128
01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.379
together, right? It's actually like the commitment and the

1129
01:05:13.379 --> 01:05:16.260
purity to this idea that will lead you to

1130
01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.889
the truth. So N Nietzsche's totally against all that,

1131
01:05:18.949 --> 01:05:22.260
but he sees this activity as like what the

1132
01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:25.629
herd does. And this ties into the overman versus

1133
01:05:25.629 --> 01:05:28.070
the last man idea. He says explicitly in his

1134
01:05:28.070 --> 01:05:30.790
notes for thus book Zarathustra that he sees two

1135
01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:33.750
movements that are possible. One is his movement, the

1136
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:37.590
movement towards the overman. The other is the last

1137
01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:40.419
man movement, and he says he uses the phrase,

1138
01:05:40.439 --> 01:05:43.790
uh, in the translation, I have great ant organizations

1139
01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:47.550
of humankind. Essentially that it's proceeding in that like

1140
01:05:47.550 --> 01:05:50.870
you social direction. Everyone becomes an instrument, everyone becomes

1141
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:53.030
a function of the herd. And one of the

1142
01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:55.469
things he, he says that the language he often

1143
01:05:55.469 --> 01:05:59.030
uses in Zarathustra, they want a herd but no

1144
01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:02.780
shepherd. So, and that's one of the things he

1145
01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:06.979
says about uh capitalism in the modern economy. It's

1146
01:06:06.979 --> 01:06:09.580
turning everyone into a slave, into a cog of

1147
01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:14.320
the machine. Yeah, but with no master, with no

1148
01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.979
visionary or artist of like how to use it,

1149
01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.459
what is it all for? Where is it all

1150
01:06:18.459 --> 01:06:20.820
going? No one really has a, uh, we don't

1151
01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:23.260
have a unified theory of where human society or

1152
01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:28.149
civilization is going other than just to. Reproduce the

1153
01:06:28.149 --> 01:06:31.550
types that we already are, to help preserve us

1154
01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:34.310
so that we continue to eat, and, uh, can

1155
01:06:34.310 --> 01:06:35.209
I curse on your show?

1156
01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.729
Uh, I, I guess it depends on the world.

1157
01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:41.169
I mean, we have to be careful. We have

1158
01:06:41.169 --> 01:06:44.090
to be careful with YouTube. I, I think you're

1159
01:06:44.090 --> 01:06:45.090
aware of that. Yeah,

1160
01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:47.429
so, so people just want to eat and shag

1161
01:06:47.429 --> 01:06:52.610
and continue to, uh, produce their type as it

1162
01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:54.959
already is. That's the last man, the final form,

1163
01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:58.929
the last man. I have already arrived at the

1164
01:06:58.929 --> 01:07:01.770
form that I need to be, uh, and so

1165
01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:05.840
that's why Nietzsche presents this whole idea. I, I

1166
01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.830
think Zarathustra is part of this idea of getting

1167
01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:10.199
us to think in terms of becoming rather than

1168
01:07:10.199 --> 01:07:13.250
being. So we're not like mankind isn't is a

1169
01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:16.399
process, it's not a thing. It's a bridge. So

1170
01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:18.189
even that is using the language of a thing,

1171
01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:20.840
but he's, he's, it's provisional language to try and

1172
01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:24.040
make a point, a bridge between ape and Superman

1173
01:07:24.389 --> 01:07:28.489
that essentially we are not, uh, What's great about

1174
01:07:28.489 --> 01:07:30.750
man is what we can give rise to is

1175
01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:33.949
the potential that exists within us, uh, but what

1176
01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:36.889
every morality hitherto has tried to do is say,

1177
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:39.790
how do we preserve and recapitulate to the type

1178
01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:41.750
just as we are and so that may seem

1179
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:44.070
like kind of a cop out, but I would

1180
01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:48.419
say that essentially. Nietzsche ends up being against basically

1181
01:07:48.419 --> 01:07:52.540
all of these modern movements in politics and it's

1182
01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:53.899
very hard and then people say, well, what is

1183
01:07:53.899 --> 01:07:56.550
Nietzsche's politics because you can't just be against everything.

1184
01:07:56.939 --> 01:08:00.100
The problem is that Nietzsche's politics can't be represented

1185
01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:03.979
in a democratic form. You, you can't ever have

1186
01:08:03.979 --> 01:08:07.320
a party of Nietzscheans. The exception can't ever become

1187
01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:10.820
the rule. That's one of his central points. Like

1188
01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:12.659
we're, we're not, he's like, you know, oh, Nietzsche

1189
01:08:12.659 --> 01:08:17.100
likes Napoleon, he likes, uh, Goethe. Well, you're not

1190
01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.779
going to create a society that produces all Goethe's.

1191
01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:23.020
That also that society wouldn't function, by the way,

1192
01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:24.359
so there's

1193
01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:26.600
that, uh, you know, you know, it's, it's funny,

1194
01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:31.640
it's funny because uh when I finished reading Zarathustra,

1195
01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.580
the first idea that came to my mind is

1196
01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:39.000
that what I should do with that book was

1197
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.640
to burn it. I mean, I, I, I thought

1198
01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:46.270
that the message Nietzsche was sending me. WAS burn

1199
01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:49.589
the book and do with your life, uh, decide

1200
01:08:49.589 --> 01:08:52.270
for yourself what you want to do with your

1201
01:08:52.270 --> 01:08:56.430
life, which actually also, I mean, I've told that

1202
01:08:56.430 --> 01:09:01.069
to two or three people who uh are very

1203
01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:05.109
much into Nietzsche and they didn't like that idea

1204
01:09:05.109 --> 01:09:07.750
of burning the book. I mean, what, what do

1205
01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:09.430
you, how do you react to that?

1206
01:09:10.459 --> 01:09:12.859
Oh, I think it's great. I mean, he, he

1207
01:09:12.859 --> 01:09:14.629
says lose me, and then you can find me

1208
01:09:14.629 --> 01:09:20.209
again. And I think Yeah, so this is sort

1209
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:22.220
of the eternal problem with N Nietzsche, and it's

1210
01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.600
why he's destined to be misunderstood, and he's OK

1211
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.959
with that. He says, I would rather be a

1212
01:09:26.959 --> 01:09:30.720
buffoon than a saint, and that perhaps that is

1213
01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.770
my fate. And he even anticipates it in Zarathustra.

1214
01:09:34.819 --> 01:09:39.580
There's Zarathustra's ape who is misrepresenting his teachings and

1215
01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:43.060
uh claiming to preach the true way of Zarathustra.

1216
01:09:44.029 --> 01:09:47.919
Um, SO he's aware of all this, and the

1217
01:09:47.919 --> 01:09:52.629
fact of the matter is, Many people will read

1218
01:09:52.629 --> 01:09:55.069
N Nietzsche's works and what they want out of

1219
01:09:55.069 --> 01:09:59.189
it is self-help, or they want a series of

1220
01:09:59.189 --> 01:10:03.669
prescriptions. OK, what am I supposed to do? And

1221
01:10:04.129 --> 01:10:05.680
so for on the one hand, it's, it's so

1222
01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.810
funny when people ask me about Nietzsche's like political

1223
01:10:07.810 --> 01:10:09.529
opinions, which he does have, by the way, it's

1224
01:10:09.529 --> 01:10:13.379
not like he doesn't have them. But they're just

1225
01:10:13.379 --> 01:10:17.540
that, his opinions, and I'm not exactly sure why.

1226
01:10:18.779 --> 01:10:22.149
Just strictly because Nietzsche said something that should motivate

1227
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:25.339
you to like adopt a political program, that doesn't

1228
01:10:25.339 --> 01:10:27.339
really follow, like what are his arguments for these

1229
01:10:27.339 --> 01:10:31.520
things, and it's worth noting. N Nietzsche never produces

1230
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:35.740
a work of political philosophy or political theory. If

1231
01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:38.080
so if he really did want to clearly articulate

1232
01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.009
some sort of political program. He certainly would have

1233
01:10:41.009 --> 01:10:43.319
done so. He, he had, he wrote plenty of

1234
01:10:43.319 --> 01:10:45.689
books, but it's like people have to sort of

1235
01:10:45.689 --> 01:10:48.450
like tease it out, sift it out of like

1236
01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:51.370
all these different works. They look through his descriptive

1237
01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:54.930
statements about politics. They look at historical regimes that

1238
01:10:54.930 --> 01:10:58.450
he praised or historical figures that he praised, which

1239
01:10:58.450 --> 01:11:00.399
by the way, already there we're in difficulty, right,

1240
01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:03.290
because Nietzsche praises the Greek state. One of the

1241
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:06.160
most consistent things about Nietzsche is admiration for the

1242
01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.529
ancient Greeks, as from the beginning of his career

1243
01:11:08.529 --> 01:11:10.479
to the end, there are some changes in his

1244
01:11:10.479 --> 01:11:15.089
attitude, but overall the admiration is rather consistent. Well,

1245
01:11:15.209 --> 01:11:18.709
who are the political figures he praises? Napoleon and

1246
01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:22.850
Friedrich the Second Hohenstaufen and Cesare Borgia. Well, right

1247
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:25.490
there, that's a total contradiction because the Greeks, as

1248
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:29.330
Nietzsche says, abominated autocracy. They didn't want one person

1249
01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:31.290
to rule. He says the whole reason for the

1250
01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:33.529
Agon, or, or sorry, for the, the practice of

1251
01:11:33.529 --> 01:11:37.209
ostracism, the social practice, very strange social practice in

1252
01:11:37.209 --> 01:11:39.049
Athens where every year they vote on who's to

1253
01:11:39.049 --> 01:11:41.930
be banished, which I think we should bring that

1254
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:45.629
back, but he essentially says that. You know, people

1255
01:11:45.629 --> 01:11:47.350
interpreted that as like a safety valve to get

1256
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:49.310
dangerous people out of the society, says it only

1257
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:52.069
became that later. Really what it is, is that

1258
01:11:52.069 --> 01:11:54.709
the whole society is based on competition and contest

1259
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:56.390
between one another, and it's boring when the same

1260
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:58.069
person wins over and over again. So they have

1261
01:11:58.069 --> 01:12:00.790
to keep the competition going. You don't want Magnus

1262
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:03.229
Carlsson to win the world championship every year. You

1263
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:05.310
want him to step away so that then when

1264
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:07.830
Ding Li Ren and Jan Nepomnici are playing, hey,

1265
01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:10.430
it's anyone's game. It's actually exciting once again now

1266
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:12.430
that Magnus was not there for that year, whatever

1267
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:14.950
year it was. And Nietzsche says essentially that's the

1268
01:12:14.959 --> 01:12:17.569
the impetus for ostracism. Now, is that true? Is

1269
01:12:17.569 --> 01:12:21.029
that actually historically supported? I think that's very sketchy,

1270
01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:24.490
but that's how Nietzsche sees things. So he basically,

1271
01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.009
and, and all the Greek, I mean what is

1272
01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:28.529
certainly true is that the Greek states were either

1273
01:12:28.529 --> 01:12:32.830
democratic or oligarchic. They, they, and when there was

1274
01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:35.250
autocracy, they called it tyranny. That's where we get

1275
01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:39.129
the word, and, uh, the commentaries of Greeks on

1276
01:12:39.129 --> 01:12:41.450
that state of affairs is all as a degeneration.

1277
01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.339
So then right there, like, Nietzsche's praising the Greek

1278
01:12:45.339 --> 01:12:49.770
state, but also uh Napoleon. The most famous autocrat,

1279
01:12:50.049 --> 01:12:52.890
almost a totally non-political actor in a way, the

1280
01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:57.129
most like, not like, uh, there's no sort of

1281
01:12:57.129 --> 01:13:00.950
like, uh, what would we say like ideological political

1282
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:03.790
motive behind his seizure of power. Again, at least

1283
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:05.689
not from Nietzsche's perspective. He says he does it

1284
01:13:05.689 --> 01:13:10.089
for himself, he crowns himself, um, Cesari Borgia doesn't

1285
01:13:10.089 --> 01:13:15.240
even succeed. He gets killed unceremoniously and brutally, um,

1286
01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:19.290
you know, so. Uh, THIS is all, I guess,

1287
01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:22.660
circling around like your question of like burning Zarathustra,

1288
01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:25.100
like, here is my way, where is yours? The

1289
01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:28.970
way, it does not exist, this perfect way. Um,

1290
01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:33.319
We can see Nietzsche's attitude by reference to politics.

1291
01:13:33.779 --> 01:13:39.569
I, I think that um. Nietzsche is far, far

1292
01:13:39.569 --> 01:13:43.930
more interested, for one, in posing questions than giving

1293
01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:47.169
you an answer, and he's far, far more interested

1294
01:13:47.169 --> 01:13:51.740
in kindling your desire, your inquisitive desire, your curiosity.

1295
01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:54.129
He says this in Eke homo, so sort of

1296
01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:58.950
like. He, he, he really sees, uh, learning and

1297
01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:01.410
teaching. Teaching is like a great gift. He says

1298
01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:05.270
it's, it's a, it's. He experiences it as like

1299
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:08.270
an overflowing in a generosity, uh, to give to

1300
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:11.870
people. I, I guess that's, you know, not really

1301
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:13.790
a direct refutation of the idea that he wants

1302
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:15.430
to give people a morality, but I just, I

1303
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:17.750
guess I would say my sense for Nietzsche is

1304
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:20.029
that it's just totally that's not what he's interested

1305
01:14:20.029 --> 01:14:23.790
in. And furthermore, if, if he was interested in

1306
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:27.390
that, his better sense, his better judgment tells him

1307
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:30.439
it would all be pointless because your ideas aren't

1308
01:14:30.439 --> 01:14:33.669
going to be. Faithfully reproduced when they're put into

1309
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:36.270
a democratic form, uh, there's a great line in

1310
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:39.270
Human All Too Human where he says. Uh, ALL

1311
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:43.500
political parties today. Are tasked with making their ideas

1312
01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:46.660
appealing to the greatest number which requires them to

1313
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:49.720
paint their principles onto the wall in giant frescoes

1314
01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:53.479
of stupidity. That's essentially what happened. It doesn't even

1315
01:14:53.479 --> 01:14:56.009
have to be political, right? Like if, if everyone

1316
01:14:56.009 --> 01:14:58.209
starts taking and adopting Nietzsche's ideas and trying to,

1317
01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:00.129
I'm gonna use Nietzsche to improve my life and

1318
01:15:00.129 --> 01:15:03.850
become a better person, it's inevitable that 99% of

1319
01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:05.810
that is going to be utter nonsense or it's

1320
01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:07.490
going to just be a reflection of what the

1321
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:10.560
person already believes, sort of laundered through Nietzsche's work,

1322
01:15:10.729 --> 01:15:13.370
or it's going to be just something that refers

1323
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:17.250
back to their own pathological, psychological gunk, or, you

1324
01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:19.629
know, maybe some people will get some good self-help,

1325
01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:23.069
you know. Notes from Nietzsche, but that's nothing that

1326
01:15:23.069 --> 01:15:25.069
he, that's not his goal. Yeah,

1327
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:27.830
another thing that I find funny just before we

1328
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:30.290
move on to another topic is the fact that

1329
01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:34.430
er you get lots of people nowadays and you

1330
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:38.149
even see that on social media, uh Twitter, X

1331
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:41.785
or and and other places. Is that there are

1332
01:15:41.785 --> 01:15:48.185
many people who identify as, for example, ethno-nationalists or

1333
01:15:48.185 --> 01:15:52.265
white supremacists or um I mean some something like

1334
01:15:52.265 --> 01:15:54.955
that or uh uh uh uh a version of

1335
01:15:55.290 --> 01:16:01.689
A far right, uh, authoritarianism. So, um, and they

1336
01:16:01.689 --> 01:16:06.049
quote Nietzsche, uh, frequently, and I mean, I, I

1337
01:16:06.049 --> 01:16:12.370
never understood really well why they do that because

1338
01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:17.049
I, I mean even uh just me myself going

1339
01:16:17.049 --> 01:16:21.410
through uh reading of Nietzsche's work and I only

1340
01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:25.540
did it once. Uh, I never got the sense

1341
01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:28.899
that he would support those kinds of ideas and

1342
01:16:28.899 --> 01:16:35.580
even sometimes people, particularly some political leaders presenting themselves

1343
01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:40.339
in the 20th century and perhaps even some of

1344
01:16:40.339 --> 01:16:43.330
them nowadays if you ask them, and if they

1345
01:16:43.339 --> 01:16:48.299
have actually read Nietzsche, maybe they, they would say

1346
01:16:48.299 --> 01:16:51.740
the same or would answer along the same lines.

1347
01:16:52.359 --> 01:16:55.779
I, I mean some of them actually thinking of

1348
01:16:55.779 --> 01:17:00.759
themselves as Ubermensch. I mean, uh, was Hitler really

1349
01:17:00.939 --> 01:17:04.089
a Ubermensch? I mean, is any of our, uh,

1350
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:07.060
is any, uh, are any of our politic current

1351
01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:12.979
political leaders people that Nietzsche would admire and would

1352
01:17:12.979 --> 01:17:17.220
label, uh, um, or you would use a label

1353
01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:20.500
such as Ubermensch, uh, to attach to them.

1354
01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.240
Well, I mean, in Zarathustra, he says, never has

1355
01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:28.359
there yet been an overman. So if, if Napoleon

1356
01:17:28.359 --> 01:17:32.720
wasn't an overman or Ubermensch and Goethe wasn't, and

1357
01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.669
Friedrich the Second wasn't and Alexander the Great wasn't,

1358
01:17:36.109 --> 01:17:38.459
are we really gonna apply that label to like

1359
01:17:38.879 --> 01:17:42.220
Donald Trump or Joe Biden, like our current political,

1360
01:17:42.479 --> 01:17:44.439
you know, like it, it's just, it's, it's so

1361
01:17:44.439 --> 01:17:47.160
farcical and absurd on the face of it, but

1362
01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.339
I would say I, I don't, I'm not terribly

1363
01:17:49.339 --> 01:17:52.129
puzzled over why there are like hard right Nietzscheans.

1364
01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.319
I think, uh, there are a couple of things

1365
01:17:54.319 --> 01:17:59.149
going on. For one, Uh, Nietzsche does have a

1366
01:17:59.149 --> 01:18:03.270
value set that he's trying to promote. That is

1367
01:18:03.839 --> 01:18:09.279
explicitly anti-democratic and anti-egalitarian. Now it's also, as we've

1368
01:18:09.279 --> 01:18:14.600
mentioned, non-essentialist, anti-moralist, it has all these other suite

1369
01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.660
of, of, of, uh, aspects to it that actually

1370
01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.859
if they were. Thoroughly reckoned with would would uh

1371
01:18:23.859 --> 01:18:28.990
deconstruct this hard right Nietzscheanism, uh, as well. But

1372
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:30.620
uh like uh while you were talking, I pulled

1373
01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:32.759
up a quote that I think will help people

1374
01:18:32.759 --> 01:18:36.439
understand. This is from Mussolini. He doesn't specifically mention

1375
01:18:36.439 --> 01:18:39.520
N Nietzsche, but he says, quote, If relativism signifies

1376
01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:42.160
contempt for fixed categories and those who claim to

1377
01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:45.200
be the bearers of objective immortal truth, then there

1378
01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.319
is nothing more relativistic than fascist attitudes and activity.

1379
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.520
From the fact that all ideologies are of equal

1380
01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.479
value, we fascists conclude that we have the right

1381
01:18:52.479 --> 01:18:54.709
to create our own ideology and to enforce it

1382
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:56.490
with all the energy of which we are capable.

1383
01:18:56.919 --> 01:19:02.640
So that's Mussolini. So There is a certain interpretate

1384
01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.680
like, there's an interpretation you can take from Nietzsche

1385
01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:09.080
of like, OK, it's all just relative, it's all

1386
01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:12.490
perspective, so it's all just like. What suits my

1387
01:19:12.490 --> 01:19:15.540
advantage or like what I want, my morality can

1388
01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:18.500
just be what I want, my aesthetic demand for

1389
01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:22.540
the world. Well, this is what I want, right?

1390
01:19:22.859 --> 01:19:25.810
And so it's not Nietzschean per se, right? So,

1391
01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:28.259
so that's the thing. Nietzsche is describing that that's

1392
01:19:28.259 --> 01:19:30.859
what people do when they create their moral ideas

1393
01:19:30.859 --> 01:19:33.339
behind all of logic and its seeming sovereignty of

1394
01:19:33.339 --> 01:19:37.870
movement. There's these pre-rational demands for a physiological demand

1395
01:19:37.979 --> 01:19:40.040
for the preservation of a certain way of life.

1396
01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:44.709
But again, notice he uses the term preservation. So

1397
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:48.049
that's why. That's why he says he, he actually

1398
01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:50.609
makes it explicit in Twilight of Idols. All of

1399
01:19:50.609 --> 01:19:52.669
you who are trying to like preserve an old

1400
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:57.490
order, or like that never works. Anyone who wants

1401
01:19:57.490 --> 01:19:59.089
to fight decadence, so much of the right wing

1402
01:19:59.089 --> 01:20:01.450
now, they want to fight decadence, moral decay. He

1403
01:20:01.450 --> 01:20:03.399
says you're essentially, that's like fighting the symptom and

1404
01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:06.169
not dealing with the problem, cause you can't. So

1405
01:20:06.169 --> 01:20:08.640
you're like, somebody has a a fever, so you're

1406
01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.490
like giving them ice cream, something like that. I

1407
01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:12.290
don't, I don't like, this is like a ridiculous

1408
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:15.120
thing. Uh, HE also makes it explicit. There's a

1409
01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.600
great passage, N Nietzsche's 5 nos. He says, my

1410
01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.830
5 no's, 5 things I reject. He explicitly says,

1411
01:20:20.839 --> 01:20:24.660
I reject Rousseauian romanticism of like man's basically good,

1412
01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:27.560
Garden of Eden, hold hands and sing with the

1413
01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:30.549
animals. Uh, THAT'S nonsense, but he also says, I

1414
01:20:30.549 --> 01:20:35.080
reject. Uh, THE romanticism in the sense of Wagner

1415
01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:39.060
and this like hard right militarism that wants to

1416
01:20:39.069 --> 01:20:41.919
return to, he basically says they want to, they've

1417
01:20:41.919 --> 01:20:45.620
constructed a representation on an idea. Of eras they

1418
01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:48.020
never lived in and they're looking back to that

1419
01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:50.540
they wanna go back to that because they're in

1420
01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:52.419
a state of distress in the modern world and

1421
01:20:52.419 --> 01:20:54.459
they can't deal with it and they're looking, they

1422
01:20:54.459 --> 01:20:56.540
don't have any vision for the future, so they're

1423
01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.939
latching on to something from the past but what

1424
01:20:58.939 --> 01:21:01.470
I would say also is that. There has been

1425
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:05.209
a strain of left Nietzscheans. And I mean their

1426
01:21:05.209 --> 01:21:08.850
activity is is is described equally in these terms

1427
01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:11.129
like they are just following the prejudices of their

1428
01:21:11.129 --> 01:21:14.410
own sentiments. They are just following what their own

1429
01:21:14.410 --> 01:21:17.169
relativistic view of, OK, well this is what we

1430
01:21:17.169 --> 01:21:20.000
want and I've brought this up before, but even

1431
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.049
in the Soviet Union, there was the idea of

1432
01:21:22.049 --> 01:21:26.270
the new Soviet man, which is has a covert

1433
01:21:26.779 --> 01:21:29.729
influence from Nietzsche. This idea that we're literally going

1434
01:21:29.729 --> 01:21:32.209
to change people into new kinds of human beings,

1435
01:21:32.290 --> 01:21:35.410
but it's going to accord with, uh, you know,

1436
01:21:35.529 --> 01:21:39.770
our vision, our values of like this egalitarian post-capitalist

1437
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:44.669
society. Um, I would say both are ultimately falsifications

1438
01:21:44.669 --> 01:21:47.509
of Nietzsche, I guess, but You know, that gets

1439
01:21:47.509 --> 01:21:49.919
into whether or not there's like a true interpretation

1440
01:21:49.919 --> 01:21:52.240
or orthodox interpretation. What's become very clear to me

1441
01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:55.839
from surveying all the interpretations of Nietzsche is that

1442
01:21:55.839 --> 01:21:58.560
from the very beginning, right, from like, even when

1443
01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:02.669
he was still alive, Lusalome writes the first biography

1444
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:05.560
and survey of Nietzsche's work, and then like really

1445
01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:08.509
shortly after his death, you have like York Brandes,

1446
01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:12.790
you have HL Mencken, you have Bertrand Russell. All

1447
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:15.629
interpreting Nietzsche in very different ways and coming to

1448
01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:17.479
very different judgments of whether he's on the left

1449
01:22:17.479 --> 01:22:20.720
or the right, and basically people have concluded throughout

1450
01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:23.439
the last century that Nietzsche is either left wing

1451
01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.439
or right wing, and that's good actually or that's

1452
01:22:25.439 --> 01:22:27.919
bad actually, or that Nietzsche is a does have

1453
01:22:27.919 --> 01:22:30.160
a political project or he doesn't, or he's an

1454
01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:34.319
existential thinker or he's a more psychological thinker. You

1455
01:22:34.319 --> 01:22:37.149
can basically, in a way, N Nietzsche's works are

1456
01:22:37.149 --> 01:22:40.160
like the Bible. You can pull out anything from

1457
01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.209
them if you want to. Um, I guess that

1458
01:22:42.209 --> 01:22:44.879
doesn't really bode well for me claiming to give

1459
01:22:44.879 --> 01:22:47.399
like a helpful interpretation of Nietzsche, but I think

1460
01:22:47.819 --> 01:22:50.680
the best way to proceed is by Nietzsche's own,

1461
01:22:51.259 --> 01:22:54.580
uh, rule of thumb where he says the worst

1462
01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:58.729
readers behave like plundering troops. They come in with

1463
01:22:58.729 --> 01:23:00.520
an idea of what they want to like take

1464
01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:03.700
or appropriate from the work, and then they despoil

1465
01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:06.149
the whole and lay lay waste to it, right?

1466
01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:08.100
That essentially that's what it is to be a

1467
01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:11.759
bad reader, I think. The only thing I can

1468
01:23:11.759 --> 01:23:15.839
say to anyone who's getting these political interpretations out

1469
01:23:15.839 --> 01:23:17.750
of Nietzsche, which I think all of them are

1470
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:22.709
largely unjustified. Is like, no, take a step back,

1471
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:25.629
go back to the texts, read more, read everything

1472
01:23:25.629 --> 01:23:28.950
Nietzsche wrote, don't just repost a quote that sounds

1473
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:32.910
good and validates your idea. Really try to understand.

1474
01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:37.250
Nietzsche the person. Um, AND this is the joy

1475
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:40.330
I think is going way beyond your question. That's

1476
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:43.689
the whole joy for me of philosophy. It's one

1477
01:23:43.689 --> 01:23:47.390
of my favorite passages and probably the favorite episode

1478
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:49.490
of my own podcast that I've done is the

1479
01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:53.370
one on the journey to Hades, where Nietzsche talks

1480
01:23:53.370 --> 01:23:57.750
about 8 figures. He says, there's 4 pairs of

1481
01:23:58.009 --> 01:24:00.009
eyes that have fixed themselves on me when I've

1482
01:24:00.009 --> 01:24:03.100
journeyed to the underworld. And these are figures who

1483
01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:05.060
are in many ways opposed to one another or

1484
01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:09.140
have incommensurate viewpoints, but Nietzsche says, I will give

1485
01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:12.020
them the right of judgment over me and in

1486
01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:15.410
regard to one another. I, I will accept judgment

1487
01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:17.339
alone from them, and he's talking about figures like

1488
01:24:17.339 --> 01:24:22.490
Montagna and Plato and uh Rousseau and Schopenhauer and

1489
01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:26.919
Epicurus and figures that oftentimes in his published work,

1490
01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:31.299
Nietzsche is criticizing. But what they are is they

1491
01:24:31.299 --> 01:24:34.750
represent a certain view of life, a certain way

1492
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:39.560
of living and way of being. That Communing with

1493
01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.799
is like incredibly valuable to him. It's like a

1494
01:24:41.799 --> 01:24:43.919
great joy. And so I would say many of

1495
01:24:43.919 --> 01:24:48.500
these like shallow political readings. What's motivating it psychologically

1496
01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:52.540
is very obvious. They're using each other. They already

1497
01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:55.379
have concluded what they want. They already have a

1498
01:24:55.379 --> 01:24:59.790
certain vibe or aesthetic or like moral regime or

1499
01:24:59.790 --> 01:25:02.560
program that they want to enact. And they see

1500
01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:03.850
some things from Nietzsche, so that can be very

1501
01:25:03.850 --> 01:25:07.970
useful. They're being parasitical on Nietzsche, but that's not,

1502
01:25:08.049 --> 01:25:10.209
I would rather have a conversation with Nietzsche, to

1503
01:25:10.209 --> 01:25:11.450
whatever extent that's possible.

1504
01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:16.410
Yeah, I, I mean, maybe someone in the future

1505
01:25:16.410 --> 01:25:20.399
will create a nicheche chatbot based on

1506
01:25:20.399 --> 01:25:23.379
the books. Don't, don't depress me, brother.

1507
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:27.930
OK, so, uh, let me ask you now, I

1508
01:25:27.930 --> 01:25:31.370
mean, I've been, I've been, I've been thinking about

1509
01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:35.129
this for a while and I mean, maybe I'm

1510
01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:39.169
mixing here uh ideas that shouldn't be mixed when

1511
01:25:39.169 --> 01:25:42.390
it comes to Nietzsche's philosophy and if I'm doing

1512
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:45.529
that, please correct me, but I, I was uh

1513
01:25:45.529 --> 01:25:48.810
thinking about what it means to be of. Authentic

1514
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:52.470
according to Nietzsche and then I also thought, OK,

1515
01:25:52.589 --> 01:25:58.470
so let's imagine that someone has the psychological predispositions

1516
01:25:58.470 --> 01:26:04.270
or impulses to that lead them to embrace slave

1517
01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:07.910
morality and that is something that Nietzsche, I think

1518
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:12.600
it's fair to say, despised, so. Would such a

1519
01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:18.359
person be authentic with those kinds of psychological predispositions

1520
01:26:18.359 --> 01:26:23.799
and if they decided to embrace slave morality? Uh,

1521
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.140
WHAT are your thoughts on, on that kind of,

1522
01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:30.680
I mean, uh, uh, on those kinds of thoughts

1523
01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:34.310
that I've read on this topic? Yeah,

1524
01:26:34.529 --> 01:26:37.589
I The first thing I would say is that

1525
01:26:37.589 --> 01:26:43.589
uh. Authenticity is not usually the language that Nietzsche

1526
01:26:43.589 --> 01:26:47.779
uses. I know what you're, you're asking, but it's,

1527
01:26:47.799 --> 01:26:52.000
uh. I think if there's an indeterminate definition here,

1528
01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.439
it could be, it could lead to some complications.

1529
01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.120
I would say certainly like Sart, who's very much

1530
01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:00.040
influenced by Nietzsche, authenticity is like very much his

1531
01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:05.439
central concern and to the extent that We could

1532
01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:09.500
see something like authenticity in Nietzsche. Perhaps it would

1533
01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:12.259
be something like a unity of words and deeds

1534
01:27:12.259 --> 01:27:16.169
or of feeling and action. So, you know, there

1535
01:27:16.169 --> 01:27:20.759
is this uh This, so, so the answer to

1536
01:27:20.759 --> 01:27:22.399
your question is yes and no as regards slave

1537
01:27:22.399 --> 01:27:27.189
morality, right? The yes answer, they could be authentic,

1538
01:27:27.509 --> 01:27:31.970
would be something like this, um, Nietzsche's not leveling

1539
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:37.299
a moral condemnation against slave morality. That is just

1540
01:27:37.299 --> 01:27:40.950
the reality of what has transpired historically, and in

1541
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:44.970
fact, he says in all higher and complex societies,

1542
01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:47.750
uh, the individuals have both master and slave morality

1543
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:52.910
even contained within the same soul. They're mutually unintelligible

1544
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:57.879
to one another and irreconcilable. There's no uh fictian

1545
01:27:58.259 --> 01:28:01.669
synthesis that's going to be affected between them. There's

1546
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:05.529
no Hegelian sublation. It's just eternal war between master

1547
01:28:05.529 --> 01:28:09.049
and slave morality, and yet we contain both, and

1548
01:28:09.049 --> 01:28:12.169
uh I believe he says like human life would

1549
01:28:12.169 --> 01:28:16.290
be, uh, rather like I'm trying to remember the

1550
01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:18.310
term he uses my terms like fatuous like it

1551
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:20.370
would, it would just, it wouldn't be as interesting

1552
01:28:20.370 --> 01:28:22.529
without the challenge from the slave morality to the

1553
01:28:22.529 --> 01:28:27.149
master morality. Right, uh, and that there are aspects

1554
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:29.640
of the slave morality, for example, the fact that

1555
01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.959
it makes us conscious, self-conscious in a more profound

1556
01:28:32.959 --> 01:28:36.040
way than we were before, because it introduces these

1557
01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.640
ideas of guilt and sin and responsibility and, uh,

1558
01:28:39.759 --> 01:28:42.100
like Nietzsche says, for example, in the gay science,

1559
01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:47.529
that, uh, Our self-knowledge today is so much more

1560
01:28:47.529 --> 01:28:50.169
profound than when we read like Epictetus or like

1561
01:28:50.169 --> 01:28:52.399
the ancients. We would actually laugh at them. They

1562
01:28:52.399 --> 01:28:54.689
actually think it's possible to be a virtuous person

1563
01:28:54.689 --> 01:28:57.069
when you read the ancient stoics and the later

1564
01:28:57.069 --> 01:29:00.359
Stoics, they think, uh, you can actually be a

1565
01:29:00.359 --> 01:29:03.209
good guy, whereas the Christians now we know because

1566
01:29:03.209 --> 01:29:05.600
we've, it's essentially like what Christianity gave us is

1567
01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:09.060
like that. Magnifying glass to really peer into the

1568
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.859
soul and be like you think you're a good

1569
01:29:10.859 --> 01:29:13.689
person, but actually deep down you know that there's

1570
01:29:13.689 --> 01:29:16.899
selfishness that drove that apparently selfless action. Which is

1571
01:29:16.899 --> 01:29:18.540
kind of funny because that's the basis on which

1572
01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:21.500
Nietzsche challenges morality himself. He says it was the

1573
01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:25.459
moral skepticism created by Christianity that will actually undermine

1574
01:29:25.459 --> 01:29:28.060
Christianity itself, but anyway, that takes us off into

1575
01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:30.020
the weeds. So Christianity gave us something. It made

1576
01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:33.299
us more self-conscious, and, and that has a lot

1577
01:29:33.299 --> 01:29:37.640
of bad effects because consciousness is prone to pathologies

1578
01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:42.180
and mistakes. Essentially what resentiment is, he says, is

1579
01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:45.810
the inability to let go of a sensation. So

1580
01:29:45.810 --> 01:29:49.919
you're harmed by someone, someone beats you up. And

1581
01:29:49.919 --> 01:29:53.790
you're holding on to the memory of the pain,

1582
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.200
the humiliation of that event, and that sensation, that

1583
01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.319
feeling stays with you long after the event has

1584
01:30:00.319 --> 01:30:02.779
passed, so you're unable to let go of it,

1585
01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:05.990
essentially. And so this is like a. We can

1586
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:09.029
see it through the language of a pathology, and

1587
01:30:09.029 --> 01:30:11.029
we don't need to sort of moralize it and

1588
01:30:11.029 --> 01:30:12.939
make a prescriptive statement, you shouldn't be a slave

1589
01:30:12.939 --> 01:30:17.770
moralist, you shouldn't have resentment. Because that clearly is

1590
01:30:17.770 --> 01:30:20.609
not the way to dealing with really any psychological

1591
01:30:20.609 --> 01:30:22.290
problem. I mean you've you you've spoken quite a

1592
01:30:22.290 --> 01:30:27.129
bit about. Modern sciences vindicating Nietzsche or showing that

1593
01:30:27.129 --> 01:30:29.609
Nietzsche prefigured his real sort of knowledge. I was

1594
01:30:29.609 --> 01:30:32.689
speaking to, uh, Jimmy Burke on my podcast who

1595
01:30:32.689 --> 01:30:36.450
does research into evidence-based behavior change and cognitive behavioral

1596
01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:39.919
therapy, and he said essentially the field is catching

1597
01:30:39.919 --> 01:30:43.209
up to where Nietzsche was, that it's no longer

1598
01:30:43.209 --> 01:30:47.569
this question of like willpower because that's like. What

1599
01:30:47.569 --> 01:30:50.080
is that exactly? What, what is the story we're

1600
01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.689
telling when we say he just didn't have enough

1601
01:30:51.689 --> 01:30:55.259
willpower? You know, Nietzsche has some very funny comments

1602
01:30:55.259 --> 01:30:57.259
about the will where he says, now we know

1603
01:30:57.259 --> 01:30:59.060
the will is only a word, and it's a

1604
01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:02.660
word behind which a popular prejudice lurks. And so

1605
01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:04.540
this idea that you just need the will to

1606
01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:07.359
quit smoking or to lose weight or do any

1607
01:31:07.359 --> 01:31:11.240
of these things. Is essentially just part of an

1608
01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:14.600
old moral regime that's like a falsification of the

1609
01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:17.770
world and that in fact, modern behavior change is

1610
01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:19.810
based far more on putting people in a better

1611
01:31:19.810 --> 01:31:24.470
environment, trying to create sort of automatic or spontaneous,

1612
01:31:25.009 --> 01:31:30.589
uh, like. Actions, re-triggering thing or decode or what

1613
01:31:30.589 --> 01:31:32.899
would you say, diffusing those old triggers, replacing them

1614
01:31:32.899 --> 01:31:34.180
with new ones that might push you in a

1615
01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:37.930
more positive direction or something like that. And so,

1616
01:31:38.549 --> 01:31:43.629
yeah, I, I would say. The whole moralization of,

1617
01:31:43.890 --> 01:31:47.040
you know, slave morality result in all these things,

1618
01:31:47.089 --> 01:31:48.640
that wouldn't be helpful, and I don't think that

1619
01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:51.890
would be Nietzsche's approach. It might be unsatisfying to

1620
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:54.310
hear, but his attitude is something to the effect

1621
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:57.569
of it is what it is. Again, this is

1622
01:31:57.569 --> 01:32:01.160
the eternal story of the herd sort of smashing

1623
01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:04.609
down the the exception. Like you had these aristocracies

1624
01:32:04.609 --> 01:32:09.450
of master morality, and they generated so much resentiment

1625
01:32:09.450 --> 01:32:12.970
that the herd overthrew them. The issue then is

1626
01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:16.009
that we're still holding on to the resentment. It's,

1627
01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:18.209
he says the real problem is when it turned

1628
01:32:18.209 --> 01:32:21.970
inward and became creative and starts giving birth to

1629
01:32:21.970 --> 01:32:26.520
values, and that's the real issue. Now, so could

1630
01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:31.919
somebody hold those values and be authentic? Well, If

1631
01:32:31.919 --> 01:32:34.779
those values suit who and what they are, I

1632
01:32:34.779 --> 01:32:36.319
mean, it's one of the things Deluz says about

1633
01:32:36.319 --> 01:32:38.959
Nietzsche. We always, things always have the sense and

1634
01:32:38.959 --> 01:32:40.859
value that they have for us based on who

1635
01:32:40.859 --> 01:32:43.000
and what we are. We always have the sense

1636
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.240
and value for things that we deserve, it's the

1637
01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:48.779
way he puts it, something along those lines. Now,

1638
01:32:48.859 --> 01:32:50.720
I did say it was yes and no, right?

1639
01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:54.299
The question of authenticity. There is a technical sense

1640
01:32:54.299 --> 01:32:58.430
in which they're not authentic because. It's the very

1641
01:32:58.430 --> 01:33:02.740
intercession of the neutral substrate of the ego, that's

1642
01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:06.870
autonomously governing force with free will. That Nietzsche would

1643
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:11.640
say creates this experience of not living authentically. That

1644
01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:14.160
there's now a separation between what I want to

1645
01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:17.350
do, what I feel. And what I can do

1646
01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:22.540
In fact, that's what how Deluz defines reactive forces.

1647
01:33:22.779 --> 01:33:25.299
He says they don't triumph, uh, so we might

1648
01:33:25.299 --> 01:33:27.899
say reactive forces, uh, we'll just say sort of

1649
01:33:27.899 --> 01:33:32.020
uh. Slave morality, weakness, herd morality, something like that.

1650
01:33:32.069 --> 01:33:34.669
They don't triumph by comprising a greater force, they

1651
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:37.310
triumph by separating the greater force from what it

1652
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:43.959
can do. And so, uh, we now mediate our

1653
01:33:45.049 --> 01:33:48.770
Like impulses through this whole moral regime of guilt

1654
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:52.569
and sin, not so much sin these days, but

1655
01:33:52.569 --> 01:33:55.080
nevertheless, Nietzsche would say we, we have this whole

1656
01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:58.370
grammatical construction, right? Uh, THIS ties back into like

1657
01:33:58.370 --> 01:34:01.680
substance ontology, talks about separating the lightning from the

1658
01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:05.009
flash, saying the lightning flashes, or you could say

1659
01:34:05.009 --> 01:34:07.359
the flash flashes. What are you, what are you

1660
01:34:07.359 --> 01:34:11.089
actually saying there? You're, you're trying to freeze this

1661
01:34:11.089 --> 01:34:14.270
deed and make it into a thing. Nietzsche says

1662
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:18.520
in in nature. It's the norm for every impulse

1663
01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:22.850
to be gratified immediately, to express itself immediately. There's

1664
01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:25.209
also a great passage that that long precedes the

1665
01:34:25.209 --> 01:34:28.209
genealogy where he talks about this, again, talking about

1666
01:34:28.209 --> 01:34:31.450
the social sort of process of inculcating these values.

1667
01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:34.290
He uses the example of an unchaste woman, a

1668
01:34:34.290 --> 01:34:36.609
woman who wants to cheat on her husband and

1669
01:34:36.609 --> 01:34:39.649
perhaps of an ancient Bronze Age society where they

1670
01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:41.850
might have the death penalty for adultery or something

1671
01:34:41.850 --> 01:34:46.490
like this, and he says, why, how could you

1672
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:49.490
ever develop the kind of animal that would not

1673
01:34:49.490 --> 01:34:51.979
commit adultery, if we are indeed just animals, we're

1674
01:34:51.979 --> 01:34:55.049
clever animals that invented knowledge, how did we create

1675
01:34:55.049 --> 01:34:58.410
these people who would be able to not gratify

1676
01:34:58.410 --> 01:35:01.410
the impulse? And he says, what's required here is

1677
01:35:01.410 --> 01:35:02.990
for a feeling to be suppressed by a thought.

1678
01:35:03.899 --> 01:35:05.500
Well, how could that be the case because we've

1679
01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:07.540
already talked about sort of thought is always appropriated

1680
01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:09.580
by feeling. Well, because he says it's the thought

1681
01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:13.040
of fear. Essentially what happens is the community by

1682
01:35:13.819 --> 01:35:18.740
punishing people over long generations, doing public executions, he

1683
01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:20.419
says, and he does talk about this in the

1684
01:35:20.419 --> 01:35:22.259
genealogy, he talks about how much blood has been

1685
01:35:22.259 --> 01:35:25.220
spilled essentially to give man a memory, essentially to

1686
01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:27.580
make us capable of making promises so that we

1687
01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:30.620
will hold that image in mind when we transgress

1688
01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:34.620
or we're thinking of transgressing. And then experience that

1689
01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:38.439
fear, and that will halt. The pursuit of that

1690
01:35:38.439 --> 01:35:41.830
impulse, essentially something like this. And so I think

1691
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:44.910
when many people describe the feeling of being inauthentic,

1692
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:48.870
it's because they have a thoroughly developed sense of

1693
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:51.939
this neutral substratum of the self that halts and

1694
01:35:51.939 --> 01:35:56.919
intercedes, uh. Between what they really want, what they

1695
01:35:56.919 --> 01:35:59.319
really feel like they want to do, right? They

1696
01:35:59.319 --> 01:36:00.759
really, they really feel about the world, what they

1697
01:36:00.759 --> 01:36:02.399
really want to say, what they really want, the

1698
01:36:02.399 --> 01:36:04.560
life path they really want to pursue, and they

1699
01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.189
don't because they have this, uh, this wall that

1700
01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:11.680
they've put up, and Nietzsche would say. That might

1701
01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:14.330
be the very definition of living inauthentically, is that

1702
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:18.080
you're allowing guilt, fear, shame, sin, whatever it might

1703
01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:22.410
be. To stop you from living your authentic life.

1704
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:24.430
But even see, I, I just slipped up there.

1705
01:36:24.509 --> 01:36:27.100
I used the word allowing, because Nietzsche would say,

1706
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:28.910
it's not a question of free will, it's simply

1707
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:32.069
which force is stronger than the other one. If

1708
01:36:32.069 --> 01:36:35.669
if you have, like, most people don't have, uh,

1709
01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:38.299
strong enough impulses to overcome that sense of the

1710
01:36:38.299 --> 01:36:40.549
community's fear, and that's largely, by the way, I

1711
01:36:40.549 --> 01:36:46.109
think what guilt is. Um, PEOPLE, you know, like

1712
01:36:46.109 --> 01:36:49.129
people might get away with something, a crime, or,

1713
01:36:49.950 --> 01:36:52.339
uh, you know, cheating on their girlfriend or whatever

1714
01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:56.000
it might be. And, you know, there's the fear

1715
01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.339
of getting caught, but When that doesn't manifest, it's

1716
01:37:01.339 --> 01:37:03.890
almost like as a compensation for that, the guilt

1717
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:07.459
is like, it's like the ability of that fear

1718
01:37:07.459 --> 01:37:11.339
to continue punishing you or something like that. Um,

1719
01:37:11.419 --> 01:37:13.899
IT'S it's the community's power, the voice of your

1720
01:37:13.899 --> 01:37:16.740
conscience is the community's voice whispering in your ear

1721
01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:19.589
about what you should or shouldn't do. Again, according

1722
01:37:19.589 --> 01:37:22.589
to this logic of what benefits the community, what

1723
01:37:22.589 --> 01:37:24.220
would make you a good instrument or function of

1724
01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:26.490
the community, so it'd be really bad if you're

1725
01:37:27.279 --> 01:37:30.180
Committing crimes, if everyone is committing crimes and, and

1726
01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:33.399
being, you know, living in infidelity and all of

1727
01:37:33.399 --> 01:37:37.040
these things, at least in especially in early social

1728
01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.180
formations, we don't have the same sexual morality now,

1729
01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.509
but obviously, but. Yeah, so I think that that

1730
01:37:41.509 --> 01:37:42.830
gets the point across. So I would say yes

1731
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:44.419
and no. It's like, it's not as if he

1732
01:37:44.419 --> 01:37:47.350
would say they should live some other way because

1733
01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:49.750
it's immoral to be resentful. That's just sort of

1734
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:51.299
is what it is, and that's what the herd

1735
01:37:51.299 --> 01:37:53.350
is going to do. And that's, uh, he does

1736
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:54.979
hope that we can overcome that, but you're not

1737
01:37:54.979 --> 01:37:57.350
going to overcome it by scolding it and shaking

1738
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:59.370
your finger at it. But on the other hand,

1739
01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:02.069
it is inauthentic. It's almost a definition of what

1740
01:38:02.069 --> 01:38:05.970
people feel. Like what they're trying to articulate when

1741
01:38:05.970 --> 01:38:07.930
they say they're living in authentically.

1742
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:14.350
OK, so, um, this might be, uh, I, I

1743
01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:16.819
mean, actually all of the questions here are, are

1744
01:38:16.819 --> 01:38:21.140
complicated, but this one partic might be particularly complicated,

1745
01:38:21.209 --> 01:38:25.229
but of course, as we've already talked about, Nietzsche

1746
01:38:25.229 --> 01:38:30.180
was very much a moral anti-realist, but of course

1747
01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:33.870
he was also uh a per a human like

1748
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:38.069
all of us are, and I mean, he certainly

1749
01:38:38.069 --> 01:38:41.930
must have had this. Uh, MORAL preferences, but do

1750
01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:45.310
you think that Nietzsche, at the end of the

1751
01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:48.049
day, or there's any, uh, is there anything in

1752
01:38:48.049 --> 01:38:53.750
his work. Where you think that possibly he might

1753
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:57.520
have endorsed a set of moral values.

1754
01:38:59.299 --> 01:39:01.419
Uh, YEAH, the short answer is yes. I mean,

1755
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:03.990
I think so to sort of refer back to

1756
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:08.419
the very first question you asked me, right? Uh,

1757
01:39:08.899 --> 01:39:12.390
Nietzsche doesn't reject reason, but he reinterprets what reason

1758
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:17.509
is. So Nietzsche reinterprets the nature of morality, but

1759
01:39:17.509 --> 01:39:21.600
that doesn't, uh, I don't think That he thinks

1760
01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:24.660
we can live without it in a way, it's

1761
01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:28.799
sort of like. You know, Nietzsche can spend all

1762
01:39:28.799 --> 01:39:31.759
this time criticizing morality, but there's still evaluative judgments

1763
01:39:31.759 --> 01:39:33.589
that he's making, as he says, even at the

1764
01:39:33.589 --> 01:39:36.439
very level of my perceptions of the world and

1765
01:39:36.439 --> 01:39:40.790
that we're all going to have certain. Uh, PRE-RATIONAL

1766
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:43.740
assessments of what is better and what is worse.

1767
01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:47.859
That's essentially like. In a in a way, like

1768
01:39:47.859 --> 01:39:50.660
the function of thinking is to, to rank order

1769
01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:53.700
things and to, uh, that's what valuing is, is

1770
01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:57.140
rank ordering in a way. And, uh, that's also

1771
01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:58.299
a lot of the problem that he has with

1772
01:39:58.299 --> 01:39:59.979
the last man is trying to the and the

1773
01:39:59.979 --> 01:40:01.740
leveling when he speaks about these things is that

1774
01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:06.020
it, it sort of, uh, deconstructs the order of

1775
01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:08.379
rank and makes it impossible, and so it makes

1776
01:40:08.379 --> 01:40:11.229
thinking impossible because valuing is part of thinking. So

1777
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:13.410
yeah, like if valuing is part of thinking, then

1778
01:40:13.419 --> 01:40:16.649
then certainly Nietzsche has some moral ideas. But again,

1779
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:18.870
he reinterprets it. So, so this is what I

1780
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:21.229
would say about Nietzsche's moral ideas. The most important

1781
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:25.700
thing is that he is not a universalist. Uh,

1782
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:28.910
THERE'S the great passage in the gay science where

1783
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:31.390
he says, you know, so he's spoken of in

1784
01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:33.149
the death of God, he talks about God as

1785
01:40:33.149 --> 01:40:36.660
a sun to which the earth is anchored. What

1786
01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:38.379
what gave us the right to unchain the earth

1787
01:40:38.379 --> 01:40:39.819
from its sun. So it's sort of like this

1788
01:40:39.819 --> 01:40:44.259
like metaphysical grounding around which the earth orbits, sort

1789
01:40:44.259 --> 01:40:49.270
of holding us in place. Now, some have interpreted

1790
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:52.620
this as a lament, oh no, woe is me.

1791
01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.660
But N Nietzsche says, no, my, uh, it's actually

1792
01:40:55.759 --> 01:40:59.040
a great opportunity. It's a cause for hope. I

1793
01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:01.359
hope that many new suns are yet to be

1794
01:41:01.359 --> 01:41:04.830
discovered. He says, the earth has its antipodes just

1795
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:07.490
as the moral earth does. There's a lot of

1796
01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:12.209
metaphors and the Science, by the way, about like

1797
01:41:12.209 --> 01:41:15.569
Columbus, if not specifically Columbus, because he was in

1798
01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:17.649
Genoa when he was writing it. So he's on

1799
01:41:17.649 --> 01:41:21.049
his mind, he's constantly using seafaring metaphors and the

1800
01:41:21.049 --> 01:41:23.169
idea of sailing to a new world, discovering some

1801
01:41:23.169 --> 01:41:25.930
new world on the opposite side of the world

1802
01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:28.049
that we currently live in. So the idea that

1803
01:41:28.049 --> 01:41:32.689
there could be like, to speak metaphorically, there's a

1804
01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:34.890
star that shines for you on one side of

1805
01:41:34.890 --> 01:41:37.410
the world some way, he says that explicitly of

1806
01:41:37.410 --> 01:41:40.109
justifying your way of life. He says one thing

1807
01:41:40.109 --> 01:41:42.509
is needful to to be able to justify and

1808
01:41:42.509 --> 01:41:45.529
celebrate the kind of being that you are. So

1809
01:41:45.529 --> 01:41:47.040
you could have your stars shining for you, and

1810
01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.839
on the other side of the the globe, there's

1811
01:41:48.839 --> 01:41:50.689
someone who has another star shining for him that

1812
01:41:50.689 --> 01:41:53.689
might even be antipodal, the completely opposite. Yet he

1813
01:41:53.689 --> 01:41:55.370
says, I hope we discover all sorts of new

1814
01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:59.709
ways of justifying life. So he fundamentally he says,

1815
01:41:59.939 --> 01:42:03.490
my new free spirits, the philosophers of the future

1816
01:42:03.490 --> 01:42:05.609
that I hope for, they'll love their truths, but

1817
01:42:05.609 --> 01:42:09.209
they will not be dogmatists. Dogmatism, it's been the

1818
01:42:09.209 --> 01:42:12.810
source of like the greatest errors, so universalist philosophy,

1819
01:42:12.890 --> 01:42:16.410
eternal fixed truths. N Nietzsche just simply isn't operating

1820
01:42:16.410 --> 01:42:18.669
within that realm of, of thinking. So that's not

1821
01:42:18.669 --> 01:42:21.600
what his the form that his morality takes. That

1822
01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.290
being said, does he have moral ideas? Yes, and

1823
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:26.089
I think the one word that we could use

1824
01:42:26.089 --> 01:42:29.720
to describe it would be Dionysian. He essentially, if

1825
01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:32.160
he has like a moral project, it is to

1826
01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:37.479
reintroduce the Dionysian into the world. What does that

1827
01:42:37.479 --> 01:42:43.379
mean? Well, he thinks that Dionysus is. Well, symbolically

1828
01:42:43.379 --> 01:42:47.020
and historically, Dionysus is a god of life. He's

1829
01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:48.819
a god of in a way of eternal life,

1830
01:42:48.939 --> 01:42:51.000
but not eternal life in the Christian sense that

1831
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.859
you go and live in this fixed form in

1832
01:42:52.859 --> 01:42:58.299
a uh a, you know, superordinate realm. Dionysus continually

1833
01:42:58.299 --> 01:43:01.819
dies and is reborn. He, he appears in many

1834
01:43:01.819 --> 01:43:04.979
different forms. In the Greek tragedies, originally it was

1835
01:43:04.979 --> 01:43:07.220
a sort of religious ritual. It comes from the

1836
01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:14.060
Dionysian Dioram, and these inspired spontaneous poet, poets who

1837
01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:17.600
were under the influence of wine and drunkenness. WOULD

1838
01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:20.140
sing the praises of Dionysus. Eventually they had an

1839
01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:24.410
actor who would represent Dionysus wearing a mask. And

1840
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:26.529
then eventually the Greek tragedies are are created, which

1841
01:43:26.529 --> 01:43:30.350
are stories from the Greek myths and uh histories,

1842
01:43:31.129 --> 01:43:36.549
and A heroic tragic figure replaces Dionysus. So, it's

1843
01:43:36.549 --> 01:43:38.549
interesting, it's almost like Dionysus is appearing in a

1844
01:43:38.549 --> 01:43:40.750
new form, because the fate of these figures is

1845
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:43.580
always, just as Dionysus is torn apart by the

1846
01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:47.390
titans, only to be reborn, there's always a new

1847
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:53.970
tragic hero, Oedipus, or, uh, we might say Agamemnon,

1848
01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:58.759
who, whose fate is to be rent asunder. And

1849
01:43:58.759 --> 01:44:02.149
that's not because he's, it's a morality play, Nietzsche

1850
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:04.669
insists on this. He says the nobleman does not

1851
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:08.660
sin, is the message of the Greek tragedy. Uh,

1852
01:44:08.759 --> 01:44:12.089
THAT'S not any fault of his own. It's just

1853
01:44:12.089 --> 01:44:14.410
the way things go in life, that the life

1854
01:44:14.410 --> 01:44:20.669
is this endless rhythmic cycle of creation and destruction,

1855
01:44:21.370 --> 01:44:23.790
and that there is a sort of a necessary

1856
01:44:24.490 --> 01:44:28.089
prerequisite of destruction in order to be creative. That's

1857
01:44:28.089 --> 01:44:30.850
sort of his vision of life. And what Nietzsche

1858
01:44:30.850 --> 01:44:34.729
thinks happened is that Essentially with the slave morality

1859
01:44:34.729 --> 01:44:39.240
and A number of other social historical developments, we've

1860
01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:42.359
suppressed the Dionysian and tried to forget about it.

1861
01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:45.200
Um, NOW, to the extent that we are alive,

1862
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:48.660
I guess the Dionysian still lives within us. But

1863
01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:51.520
he would say we, we express it in very

1864
01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:57.359
perverse and uh. Deranged ways nowadays in Christianity. There's

1865
01:44:57.359 --> 01:45:01.200
a great line where he says, Christianity gave Eros

1866
01:45:01.399 --> 01:45:05.140
poison to drink. He did not die, but degenerated

1867
01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:08.109
into a vice. So one of the ways of

1868
01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:11.790
looking at that would be. Nietzsche talks a lot

1869
01:45:11.790 --> 01:45:14.399
about the Dionysian as involving this element of the

1870
01:45:14.399 --> 01:45:22.799
orgiastic. He says the Greeks allowed for certain days,

1871
01:45:22.959 --> 01:45:26.910
places, and times for their all too human. So

1872
01:45:26.910 --> 01:45:30.790
the most problematic drives and impulses that are nevertheless

1873
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:33.609
part of life and sometimes in, in a way

1874
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:37.069
the best stuff of life, right? Like when we're

1875
01:45:37.069 --> 01:45:40.029
competing in sports or, or I mentioned chess earlier,

1876
01:45:40.109 --> 01:45:43.950
there's like a real bloodthirstiness, especially in chess, and

1877
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:47.870
a real joy in destroying your opponent, right? And

1878
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:50.500
uh of course sexuality and lust is a very,

1879
01:45:50.509 --> 01:45:53.060
uh, You know, they talk about in French, the

1880
01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:55.970
little death. It's like an ego death experience almost

1881
01:45:56.339 --> 01:46:00.100
can like slake off all of your conscious moral,

1882
01:46:00.370 --> 01:46:04.640
uh, self-conscious bullshit and just, you know, uh, enjoy

1883
01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:09.620
this, this, uh, experience. And so Nietzsche basically says

1884
01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:11.299
in so many words, this is inhuman, all too

1885
01:46:11.299 --> 01:46:14.680
human. They would have a certain day and time,

1886
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:16.839
a ritual where these, these could be given free

1887
01:46:16.839 --> 01:46:20.240
reign. We'd have an orgiastic ritual. And as a

1888
01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:22.680
result, what he says is the impulse is sharpened.

1889
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:28.549
And glorified, it's exalted, but it's also contained. The

1890
01:46:28.549 --> 01:46:31.430
Christianity. So, so another way to look at this,

1891
01:46:31.509 --> 01:46:33.470
there was a book, and I forget the author,

1892
01:46:33.549 --> 01:46:37.069
I forget her name, unfortunately. But I think it

1893
01:46:37.069 --> 01:46:39.750
was the subtitle was from Fasting or from feasting

1894
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:43.660
to Fasting, as showing like the European mindset changes

1895
01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:46.569
with the advent of Christianity, overcoming the pagan world.

1896
01:46:47.259 --> 01:46:49.790
Um, OBVIOUSLY you still do some feasting these days,

1897
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:53.129
but You know, we can see it's very, I

1898
01:46:53.129 --> 01:46:57.109
think, evocative and intuitive to understand that like. The

1899
01:46:57.109 --> 01:47:00.589
Dionysian, the Greek world, let the impulses, let the

1900
01:47:00.589 --> 01:47:05.470
drives have a feast. And They didn't like allow

1901
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:07.649
for, it wasn't like they thought it was OK

1902
01:47:08.029 --> 01:47:10.870
to just be publicly drunk all the time or

1903
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:14.149
to express your sexual impulse all the time. They

1904
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:16.350
would have had just as dim a view of

1905
01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:18.669
a person like that as we would, probably actually

1906
01:47:18.669 --> 01:47:22.910
even more, uh, like, uh, would be opposed to

1907
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:23.470
that kind of thing.

1908
01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:26.700
Oh, by the way, I think is the book

1909
01:47:26.799 --> 01:47:30.100
From Feasting to Fasting The Evolution of a Sin

1910
01:47:30.359 --> 01:47:31.709
by Veronica Grimm?

1911
01:47:31.819 --> 01:47:32.629
Yes, is that, yes.

1912
01:47:32.799 --> 01:47:33.439
Oh, OK,

1913
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:37.220
OK. Um, THANK you, thank you, yes, so it,

1914
01:47:37.229 --> 01:47:40.810
it essentially. What this does is this allows us

1915
01:47:40.810 --> 01:47:44.339
to Give the impulse event in a very specific

1916
01:47:44.339 --> 01:47:46.660
context, and then at the end of that, you

1917
01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:51.750
don't feel as though you're ashamed or guilty. They

1918
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:55.879
have this conception of like. You know, uh, Eros

1919
01:47:55.879 --> 01:47:59.379
again, the god took hold of me. Right, this

1920
01:47:59.379 --> 01:48:02.660
was a divine thing. So anything that like transcends

1921
01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:06.399
the human will. The human will is powerless against

1922
01:48:06.399 --> 01:48:08.359
can be conceived of as a god, some sort

1923
01:48:08.359 --> 01:48:12.160
of external force, and so that's how they conceive

1924
01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:15.180
of it. They can sort of honor the most,

1925
01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:18.040
like we might even say the dirtiest or most

1926
01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:20.600
vicious impulses of life. Now we only say they're

1927
01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:23.040
dirty or vicious because that's what Christianity has done

1928
01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:27.779
to them, because Christianity. It creates this totally different

1929
01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:34.509
regulative regime. That basically says, uh, it uses we've

1930
01:48:34.509 --> 01:48:37.669
already talked about this. It basically establishes this guilt

1931
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:42.240
responsibility regime. And so Nietzsche says like, The whole

1932
01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:45.799
inner life of the Greek versus the Christian, it's

1933
01:48:45.799 --> 01:48:49.600
totally mutually unintelligible because the Greek had this sort

1934
01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:54.600
of uh What would we say? Like he didn't

1935
01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:57.479
have this inner dance of pride and shame that's

1936
01:48:57.479 --> 01:49:01.080
like sort of the defining like emotional landscape, uh,

1937
01:49:01.259 --> 01:49:05.540
as regards morality that we have, um, and so.

1938
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:08.319
To bring it back full circle of like what's

1939
01:49:08.319 --> 01:49:14.509
Nietzsche's moral project. Dionysus is. Like, fundamentally, so he

1940
01:49:14.509 --> 01:49:19.500
describes it by many terms. He calls it excess,

1941
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:23.609
he calls it the orgiastic. He also says uh

1942
01:49:23.609 --> 01:49:25.810
he invokes the idea of Dionysus as a god

1943
01:49:25.810 --> 01:49:30.450
of life. But fundamentally, it's the idea of life

1944
01:49:30.450 --> 01:49:35.899
affirmation. And that's not like a placid, like sort

1945
01:49:35.899 --> 01:49:38.100
of just, oh, life is good, smooth over all

1946
01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:41.290
the tragedy and suffering of life. It's the idea

1947
01:49:41.290 --> 01:49:44.770
that in full confrontation of that tragedy and suffering.

1948
01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:49.450
To say that life is a fundamentally innocent state

1949
01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:53.540
of affairs. That it guilt is something we made

1950
01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:57.109
up. That we created that had a very powerful

1951
01:49:57.109 --> 01:50:01.370
use, very, um, you know, uh, there's there's not,

1952
01:50:01.439 --> 01:50:03.609
it's not trivial. It's not like, oh, we should

1953
01:50:03.609 --> 01:50:05.810
just get rid of that. Like, it might be

1954
01:50:05.810 --> 01:50:07.569
possible we're incapable of getting rid of it at

1955
01:50:07.569 --> 01:50:09.689
this point or that it would in fact bring

1956
01:50:09.689 --> 01:50:11.770
ruin to society if we got rid of it.

1957
01:50:12.490 --> 01:50:19.339
But that's why Nietzsche. Says the fundamental. Uh, Question

1958
01:50:19.339 --> 01:50:22.620
or opposition within his philosophy as Dionysus versus the

1959
01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:29.069
crucified. And That essentially, I think one way to

1960
01:50:29.069 --> 01:50:33.350
put it would be like this. Everyone, basically, in

1961
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:36.470
Nietzsche's view, has been an advocate for the crucified

1962
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:39.430
ever since the time of Christianity. We've all been

1963
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:42.589
advocates for morality and for this platonic view of

1964
01:50:42.589 --> 01:50:45.910
truth and for duties and for reproducing the morality

1965
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:49.390
of the common person. Nietzsche thinks it would be

1966
01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:51.700
a nice counterbalance to be the one person who

1967
01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:54.430
unequivocally comes and stands up and says, I'm for

1968
01:50:54.430 --> 01:50:57.589
Dionysus. I'm for the view that life is innocent.

1969
01:50:57.930 --> 01:51:00.370
That it's good, you should honor your impulses and

1970
01:51:00.370 --> 01:51:03.490
indulge upon them, on them, you know, you should,

1971
01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:05.580
we can have this tragic view of life and

1972
01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:09.220
nevertheless say we love life. I think that is,

1973
01:51:09.259 --> 01:51:14.540
uh, Nietzsche's moral orientation, but again, it's not universalist

1974
01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:17.649
because he doesn't think most people. We'll be able

1975
01:51:17.649 --> 01:51:21.490
to uh on board the Dionysian, if that makes

1976
01:51:21.490 --> 01:51:23.930
sense. That it it will remain uh the kind

1977
01:51:23.930 --> 01:51:26.729
of thing that can be appreciated by a few

1978
01:51:26.729 --> 01:51:31.350
extraordinary exceptions. Um, BUT yeah, I think that's would

1979
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:32.069
be his position.

1980
01:51:33.310 --> 01:51:36.740
Yeah, I mean, there are a, a few philosophers

1981
01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:42.100
out there uh trying to basically build a case

1982
01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:48.259
for abolishing morality and for amoralism. For example, earlier

1983
01:51:48.259 --> 01:51:51.899
this year, I interviewed Steven Morris, he has a

1984
01:51:51.899 --> 01:51:55.339
very interesting book, Moral Damages, The Case for Abolishing

1985
01:51:55.339 --> 01:52:00.830
Morality, and I also interviewed Other philosophers like Joel

1986
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:01.450
Marx is a,

1987
01:52:01.609 --> 01:52:05.419
is also a moral case for abolishing morality. You

1988
01:52:06.319 --> 01:52:06.790
have to be, right?

1989
01:52:09.399 --> 01:52:11.209
I, I mean, I guess, yeah, I mean, I,

1990
01:52:11.330 --> 01:52:16.330
I actually don't buy too much into the possibility

1991
01:52:16.330 --> 01:52:21.169
of us becoming amoral. I mean, I don't buy

1992
01:52:21.169 --> 01:52:24.279
too much into that. I, I, I appreciate, uh,

1993
01:52:24.290 --> 01:52:28.049
their, the arguments made by Steven Morris and Joe.

1994
01:52:28.325 --> 01:52:31.524
Marx and others, but, uh, I don't buy too

1995
01:52:31.524 --> 01:52:33.805
much into them. I, I, in, in terms of

1996
01:52:33.805 --> 01:52:39.645
us being, for example, moral anti-realists in the sense

1997
01:52:39.645 --> 01:52:45.245
that perhaps we can be, uh, relativists, annihilists, I

1998
01:52:45.245 --> 01:52:47.765
mean, probably not so much, but I, I, I

1999
01:52:47.765 --> 01:52:52.509
think that. There's some evidence that people can be

2000
01:52:52.810 --> 01:52:57.250
uh morally uh rela rela uh they can be

2001
01:52:57.250 --> 01:53:01.299
relativists in terms of their Uh, morality, but, anyway,

2002
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:05.209
that, that's just, uh, a comment that I wanted

2003
01:53:05.209 --> 01:53:08.089
to make also to, to refer to the book

2004
01:53:08.089 --> 01:53:11.810
by Steven Morris if anyone is interested in reading

2005
01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:14.870
it. But, uh, I mean, we've already done almost

2006
01:53:14.879 --> 01:53:17.709
2 hours here, so let let me perhaps just,

2007
01:53:17.729 --> 01:53:23.540
uh, bring on, uh, a last topic. So, uh,

2008
01:53:23.979 --> 01:53:27.509
Of course, this is something that Nietzsche did or

2009
01:53:27.509 --> 01:53:32.299
tried to do with uh several philosophers and thinkers,

2010
01:53:32.379 --> 01:53:36.220
that is he psychologized them in the sense of

2011
01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:41.029
he tried to understand and speculate about which aspects

2012
01:53:41.029 --> 01:53:46.049
of their psyche. Ecology led to their ideas, right?

2013
01:53:46.209 --> 01:53:49.729
So do you think that we can do the

2014
01:53:49.729 --> 01:53:55.790
same with Nietzsche and if so, uh, what ideas

2015
01:53:56.049 --> 01:54:00.129
or what aspects of his psychology do you think

2016
01:54:00.129 --> 01:54:04.290
could have led to. Particular ideas that he had.

2017
01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:06.410
I mean, I'm going just to give you one

2018
01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:10.709
example of one thing that I thought of, um,

2019
01:54:11.089 --> 01:54:13.330
so when it comes to the idea of a

2020
01:54:13.330 --> 01:54:17.390
more fatty, uh, in the particular case of Nietzsche,

2021
01:54:18.029 --> 01:54:21.609
uh, I think that there would be a reasonable

2022
01:54:21.609 --> 01:54:26.140
case to be made that. Uh, POSSIBLY one of

2023
01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:29.979
the reasons why he was into the idea of

2024
01:54:29.979 --> 01:54:35.399
a morhati of loving your destiny. Is that, uh,

2025
01:54:35.870 --> 01:54:40.479
basically in many ways, but particularly when it comes

2026
01:54:40.479 --> 01:54:46.759
to his health, uh, he had a very complicated,

2027
01:54:46.779 --> 01:54:48.540
uh, life. I mean, I'm, I'm not sure if

2028
01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:51.180
I would call it miserable, but uh at the

2029
01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:54.060
very least a very complicated life. I mean, the,

2030
01:54:54.379 --> 01:54:58.104
uh, the migraine. That he experienced and all of

2031
01:54:58.104 --> 01:55:00.185
that, and I think, please correct me if I'm

2032
01:55:00.185 --> 01:55:02.444
wrong, but I think that even now we're not

2033
01:55:03.024 --> 01:55:08.185
completely sure about what kind of uh health condition

2034
01:55:08.185 --> 01:55:11.075
he could have had. So, uh, but I mean,

2035
01:55:11.745 --> 01:55:13.484
the point I was going to make is that

2036
01:55:13.825 --> 01:55:18.944
I guess that uh through his own experiences, it

2037
01:55:18.944 --> 01:55:21.665
would make sense that he would endorse an idea

2038
01:55:21.665 --> 01:55:25.759
like a more fatty. Because basically, at least back

2039
01:55:25.759 --> 01:55:30.759
then, there probably wasn't any cure or treatment for

2040
01:55:30.759 --> 01:55:33.040
his condition and so he had to live with

2041
01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:36.319
it. And so maybe you could say that I'm

2042
01:55:36.319 --> 01:55:39.359
making a case that a more farty was a

2043
01:55:39.359 --> 01:55:44.020
way of him for. TO cope with this suffering

2044
01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:46.279
or something along those lines. I, I'm not sure

2045
01:55:46.279 --> 01:55:50.899
if coping is the correct, uh, verb to use

2046
01:55:50.899 --> 01:55:53.459
here, but or to cope, but uh I mean,

2047
01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:54.100
what,

2048
01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:55.859
what do you think? Well, if you have to

2049
01:55:55.859 --> 01:55:59.200
cope, at least don't seethe. At least he didn't

2050
01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:01.310
see it. Yeah, yeah, but,

2051
01:56:01.439 --> 01:56:03.089
but I mean, what, what do you think about

2052
01:56:03.089 --> 01:56:06.959
that idea in particular and uh would you have

2053
01:56:06.959 --> 01:56:11.000
other cases in terms of trying to connect particular

2054
01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.419
aspects of his psychology to his philosophical ideas?

2055
01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:20.160
Yes, so not only do I think it's possible

2056
01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:24.450
to psychologize Nietzsche. I think it's demanded by his

2057
01:56:24.450 --> 01:56:27.660
method. I don't think he would, I don't think

2058
01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:31.220
if you thoroughly read, uh, Nietzsche that you can

2059
01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:35.100
get away with not inquiring as to what his

2060
01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:39.319
psychology is, given everything that he says, he's told

2061
01:56:39.319 --> 01:56:44.729
you, my philosophy, like all philosophy, is an involuntary

2062
01:56:44.729 --> 01:56:49.220
confession, an autobiography. So you have to read him

2063
01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.060
that way. And I think one of the best

2064
01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:54.339
works uh for doing this is Pierre Klozowski's uh

2065
01:56:54.339 --> 01:56:56.680
Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle. Now I will say

2066
01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:00.629
that work is. Difficult, it will be a slow

2067
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:04.729
read, especially if you're not familiar with uh I'll

2068
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:08.049
just say French philosophy in general and the way

2069
01:57:08.049 --> 01:57:10.290
that they like to write. I mean, uh, Klozowski

2070
01:57:10.290 --> 01:57:12.609
was, was Polish, but he lived in France. He

2071
01:57:12.609 --> 01:57:15.770
studied under Batai and, uh, so that's sort of

2072
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:20.169
like his, his origins. And, uh, when I was,

2073
01:57:20.209 --> 01:57:22.330
uh, studying that book in order to produce an

2074
01:57:22.330 --> 01:57:24.200
episode on it, I did 3 episodes on that

2075
01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:27.129
book. I read the second chapter probably like 10

2076
01:57:27.129 --> 01:57:31.540
times because it's just so, uh, He makes some

2077
01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:35.729
very interesting claims about Nietzsche, the whole nature of

2078
01:57:35.729 --> 01:57:39.859
his struggle with like consciousness and conscious thinking and

2079
01:57:39.859 --> 01:57:41.220
all of these things. I think, so I think

2080
01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:43.879
he's a very, and then also going into like

2081
01:57:43.939 --> 01:57:47.979
the impetus for Nietzsche's like moral project or political

2082
01:57:47.979 --> 01:57:50.540
project, again, very provisional. This is his view of

2083
01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:52.850
that what Nietzsche was doing, but uh I would

2084
01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:55.020
recommend that book. Now, as far as like your

2085
01:57:55.020 --> 01:58:00.140
comments on. His illness, which, uh, yeah, could have

2086
01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:05.100
been perhaps catdicil congenital stroke disorder, perhaps a tumor,

2087
01:58:05.259 --> 01:58:07.620
perhaps something we're not even aware of. Perhaps we

2088
01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:08.359
will never know.

2089
01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:11.779
But we're certainly not sure of what, what it

2090
01:58:11.779 --> 01:58:12.580
was, right?

2091
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:15.390
No, I, I don't think there's a way to

2092
01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:18.830
be sure, uh, because, you know, we just don't

2093
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:22.379
have, uh, I mean, like if, if he had

2094
01:58:22.379 --> 01:58:26.100
died recently, you could like open up his brain

2095
01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:28.069
and, and probably glean some things from that, but,

2096
01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:30.459
but we just can't. We were like trying to

2097
01:58:30.459 --> 01:58:35.240
reconstruct what his illness was based on. LIKE medical

2098
01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:39.399
records, things he said to people and uh experiences

2099
01:58:39.399 --> 01:58:41.520
he reported and all of these things. What is

2100
01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:47.200
clear is that N Nietzsche's father died from symptoms

2101
01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:49.439
that seem at least similar to what happened to

2102
01:58:49.439 --> 01:58:51.959
Nietzsche, and then a year later, his younger brother,

2103
01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:54.299
who was only 1 or 2 years old, died.

2104
01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:56.560
Um, THAT was when Nietzsche was like 5 and

2105
01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:00.759
then 6 years old. Uh, SO, they both died

2106
01:59:00.759 --> 01:59:04.029
from like cramps, headaches. Uh, THE attending physician called

2107
01:59:04.029 --> 01:59:06.040
it liquefaction of the brain in the case of

2108
01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:08.240
his father, one of those sort of old-timey ways

2109
01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:10.479
of saying things that I, I take a perverse

2110
01:59:10.479 --> 01:59:15.540
pleasure in. But, um, That plagued him throughout his

2111
01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:17.149
life and it only got worse and worse. That's

2112
01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:19.669
why he retired from the university and the year

2113
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:21.830
that he retired from the university, he explored a

2114
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:24.140
number of like cures for his condition. He would

2115
01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:26.950
go to clinics. He ultimately, in Eke Homo talks

2116
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:29.669
about he would kind of explore the right air

2117
01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:33.629
pressure, altitude, humidity, all of these things, and see

2118
01:59:33.629 --> 01:59:35.629
what made him feel better, what, what, you know,

2119
01:59:35.790 --> 01:59:38.430
because otherwise he could be laid out for days

2120
01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:42.390
with migraines and vomiting and stomach pain. Dizziness, he

2121
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:45.390
went pretty much entirely blind in his right eye.

2122
01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:50.089
Um, AND so yeah, it was a very painful

2123
01:59:50.089 --> 01:59:52.729
existence, and you could interpret it as a morfati

2124
01:59:52.729 --> 01:59:54.290
is sort of him saying I have to live

2125
01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:56.290
with this, it is what it is. This is

2126
01:59:56.290 --> 01:59:57.770
the only way that I'm going to be able

2127
01:59:57.770 --> 02:00:02.410
to continue to, to, uh. Cope with my existence.

2128
02:00:02.919 --> 02:00:06.350
I would say the only complication of that is.

2129
02:00:07.319 --> 02:00:08.629
I mean, like, I think what Nietzsche would say

2130
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:13.740
is like, OK, but Pretty much every philosopher, uh,

2131
02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:18.430
before me came around and said, Uh, yeah, that's

2132
02:00:18.430 --> 02:00:21.870
why this world sucks. That's why, uh, this is

2133
02:00:21.870 --> 02:00:24.790
a world of suffering and impermanence, and why you

2134
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:26.479
shouldn't cling on to this world. We should hope

2135
02:00:26.479 --> 02:00:30.270
for an eternal life in which all the suffering

2136
02:00:30.270 --> 02:00:33.700
is relieved, and all accounts are settled. The lion

2137
02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:36.560
lays down with the lamb. Uh, IT'S the Sabbath

2138
02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:40.399
of Sabbaths, right? The rest of rests, that's what

2139
02:00:40.399 --> 02:00:42.759
awaits me at the end of my life, uh,

2140
02:00:42.879 --> 02:00:46.240
as for example, somebody like Pascal believed. Pascal also

2141
02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:51.879
suffered greatly, greatly throughout his life. Um, HE, I

2142
02:00:51.879 --> 02:00:55.830
believe in his case, May have exposed himself to

2143
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:58.149
mercury, had some sort of mercury poisoning, but he

2144
02:00:58.149 --> 02:01:00.549
also, like with Pascal, it was like a, he

2145
02:01:00.549 --> 02:01:03.060
had, there was something psychologically like wrong with him,

2146
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:06.970
probably manic depressive, and, you know, he would, uh,

2147
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:10.549
like do self-mortification practices and stuff like that, and

2148
02:01:10.549 --> 02:01:13.470
he essentially just sees life as like, you know,

2149
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:15.669
the condition of man, the suffering of man, the

2150
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:17.270
mortality of man, it's a sort of a hell

2151
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:19.740
hole, and if, if this is all there is,

2152
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:23.410
like, I mean, it, there's nothing for us but

2153
02:01:23.410 --> 02:01:26.279
despair. So it is interesting that Nietzsche doesn't take

2154
02:01:26.279 --> 02:01:30.140
that view. So there, so I think you're right

2155
02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:34.069
to see that as Amor Fati is absolutely a

2156
02:01:34.069 --> 02:01:36.950
confession of Nietzsche's, is absolutely a revelation of his

2157
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:39.100
psychology. His method demands that we see it that

2158
02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:44.939
way, but, I think it's we. Even if it

2159
02:01:44.939 --> 02:01:46.899
is a cope, we have to ask, why was

2160
02:01:46.899 --> 02:01:51.100
his method of coping. Sort of like worldly coping,

2161
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:52.490
whereas you have Pascal.

2162
02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:55.919
No, that, that's a, that's a fair point, yeah,

2163
02:01:56.350 --> 02:01:56.479
yeah,

2164
02:01:56.830 --> 02:01:58.990
and, uh, I don't, I don't know if I

2165
02:01:58.990 --> 02:02:03.529
can actually. Tell you what it is about Nietzsche

2166
02:02:03.529 --> 02:02:08.180
that makes him so oriented towards, OK. Uh, THE

2167
02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:11.180
world, the intelligible world is a world of errors.

2168
02:02:11.299 --> 02:02:13.779
The impulses are where the real action is. Like

2169
02:02:13.779 --> 02:02:16.379
our, our consciousness is a commentary on an unknown

2170
02:02:16.379 --> 02:02:19.979
text. I affirm sensation and appearance. I don't affirm

2171
02:02:19.979 --> 02:02:23.950
this other world that devalues ours. Why is Nietzsche

2172
02:02:23.950 --> 02:02:29.160
so invested in this? And I mean, I think

2173
02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:33.310
It might have something to do with his sickness.

2174
02:02:34.459 --> 02:02:36.770
It, again, we, we might have to believe Nietzsche

2175
02:02:36.770 --> 02:02:39.009
to some extent, uh, take his own word for

2176
02:02:39.009 --> 02:02:40.600
it when he says that he's an expert in

2177
02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:44.009
sickness and health because he experiences these things himself,

2178
02:02:44.370 --> 02:02:48.370
contains sickness and recovery within his own body. Maybe.

2179
02:02:49.339 --> 02:02:51.020
To take it a step further, what it really

2180
02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:54.890
is, is that he perceives within himself that his

2181
02:02:54.890 --> 02:02:57.899
physiology is the cause of so many of his

2182
02:02:57.899 --> 02:03:02.569
thoughts. I think he might have had. An insight

2183
02:03:02.569 --> 02:03:06.959
that, especially as far as he was concerned, because

2184
02:03:06.970 --> 02:03:08.609
he would often do this, right? He would, he

2185
02:03:08.609 --> 02:03:12.250
would take notes in his journal. Of when his

2186
02:03:12.250 --> 02:03:16.120
thoughts came. And whether they were associated with high

2187
02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:19.560
feelings or low feelings. Or whether, like there's a

2188
02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:21.799
famous line from Nietzsche, which is a great line

2189
02:03:21.799 --> 02:03:23.439
on words to live by if you're looking for

2190
02:03:23.439 --> 02:03:25.859
some self-help. If there's somebody who came to watch

2191
02:03:25.859 --> 02:03:27.509
this video and they're like, 2 hours, I haven't

2192
02:03:27.509 --> 02:03:29.479
gotten any self-help advice. What the hell's going on?

2193
02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:30.759
I thought this was about Nietzsche.

2194
02:03:31.319 --> 02:03:34.680
Well, actually, if anyone comes to my channel to

2195
02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:37.819
get self-help, you're going to be disappointed.

2196
02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:39.959
Oh, no, I, I, yeah, I'm not saying that.

2197
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.600
I'm just saying so many of the people when

2198
02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:43.680
they find Nietzsche, one of my favorite things I

2199
02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:48.979
saw, uh, it's like a Uh, like a course

2200
02:03:48.979 --> 02:03:51.580
on Nietzsche that was like, learn N Nietzsche to

2201
02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:55.580
unlock your potential seven steps to self-mastery, something like

2202
02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:57.359
that. And that was like posted by like a

2203
02:03:57.660 --> 02:04:00.620
popular like it was like Nietzsche and philosophy Twitter

2204
02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:03.479
account or whatever. That's just, it's so common that

2205
02:04:03.490 --> 02:04:05.500
that's what people want out of Nietzsche. So that's

2206
02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:07.819
why I'm saying that, uh, and I think, yeah,

2207
02:04:07.979 --> 02:04:11.330
but in any case, uh, Great advice from him

2208
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:13.850
is that again, it's something he says about himself,

2209
02:04:13.930 --> 02:04:15.850
but it's something that we could all take uh

2210
02:04:15.850 --> 02:04:18.629
from. He says he trusts no thought that comes

2211
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:21.930
to him while he's sitting still. That he's learned

2212
02:04:21.930 --> 02:04:23.979
that his best thoughts come to him while he's

2213
02:04:23.979 --> 02:04:27.120
walking and hiking and moving. That's when he can

2214
02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:29.370
really trust the thoughts that come to him. And

2215
02:04:29.370 --> 02:04:32.049
so I think perhaps if we were to look

2216
02:04:32.049 --> 02:04:37.089
at maybe specifically his illness as a like psychological

2217
02:04:37.089 --> 02:04:39.430
cause of much of his philosophy, I think it's

2218
02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:42.169
because he, he does have this thing of experimenting

2219
02:04:42.169 --> 02:04:45.009
on himself, experimenting on his body, and then experimenting

2220
02:04:45.009 --> 02:04:46.790
with his thoughts, like, where are my thoughts coming

2221
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:50.520
from? That might be a lot of why, and

2222
02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:53.359
so he learns that there's like this physiological origin.

2223
02:04:54.049 --> 02:04:58.520
Which again, uh, Sciences would probably agree with these

2224
02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:01.240
days that uh a lot of your thinking is

2225
02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:04.390
done by your gut. But I think, you know,

2226
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:06.750
if we want to be critical, which is sort

2227
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:09.379
of often what people are asking for when they

2228
02:05:09.379 --> 02:05:13.339
ask you to psychologize Nietzsche. Perhaps he may have

2229
02:05:13.339 --> 02:05:17.140
gone too far in his convictions that everything is

2230
02:05:17.140 --> 02:05:21.140
rooted in the physiological, that every idea we have

2231
02:05:21.140 --> 02:05:24.620
is simply a question of our constitution or or

2232
02:05:24.629 --> 02:05:28.819
or our impulses, that everything is about uh simply

2233
02:05:28.819 --> 02:05:31.259
sensation and like the world as it appears, and

2234
02:05:31.259 --> 02:05:34.180
we should just like eschew all of these eternal

2235
02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:36.040
ideas of the intelligible world or all of this

2236
02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:38.500
is be suspicious towards it, all morality, all of

2237
02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:42.220
this. Maybe he went a little far because his

2238
02:05:42.220 --> 02:05:45.689
whole world was dominated by physiology. He was sort

2239
02:05:45.689 --> 02:05:50.189
of He knew more than anyone that he was

2240
02:05:50.189 --> 02:05:54.759
sort of. Chained to bound by his physiology. So

2241
02:05:54.759 --> 02:05:57.310
that perhaps would be a way of psychologizing him.

2242
02:05:59.049 --> 02:06:03.370
Yeah, great. So, look, Keegan, uh, let's perhaps wrap

2243
02:06:03.370 --> 02:06:06.120
up the conversation here. We've already done a little

2244
02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:09.649
bit over 2 hours, so, uh, I will be

2245
02:06:09.649 --> 02:06:14.370
leaving links to your YouTube channel and your Twitter

2246
02:06:14.370 --> 02:06:18.850
slash X handle handle. What, what other places on

2247
02:06:18.850 --> 02:06:20.810
the internet can people find you on?

2248
02:06:22.479 --> 02:06:24.899
Well, uh, if you just type in the Nietzsche

2249
02:06:24.899 --> 02:06:29.000
podcast or untimely Reflections into Google, you can find

2250
02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.759
it on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, all these things, um.

2251
02:06:33.549 --> 02:06:36.270
I also, uh, will be another place people can

2252
02:06:36.270 --> 02:06:38.910
find me, uh, this January. I'm not sure when

2253
02:06:38.910 --> 02:06:40.740
this episode will be coming out, but the episodes

2254
02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:41.390
will be archived.

2255
02:06:41.459 --> 02:06:44.549
Uh, IT, it will come out in mid-December, so

2256
02:06:44.549 --> 02:06:47.209
next week, the week after we're recording. So,

2257
02:06:47.549 --> 02:06:51.009
so, uh, this January, I'm going to be teaching

2258
02:06:51.009 --> 02:06:55.629
a course, a series of 4 courses at Acid

2259
02:06:55.629 --> 02:07:01.709
Horizon Research Commons. It's a para-academic, uh, society. Uh,

2260
02:07:01.790 --> 02:07:03.950
I'm going to be one of the first this

2261
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:07.939
year for the spring session. Um, ALONGSIDE, I'm trying

2262
02:07:07.939 --> 02:07:11.339
to remember what the other courses are, there's, there's

2263
02:07:11.339 --> 02:07:13.819
stuff on Kant, there's stuff on philosophy and magic.

2264
02:07:13.899 --> 02:07:15.729
There's all sorts of really cool courses that they're

2265
02:07:15.729 --> 02:07:18.700
teaching there, and Craig, who runs Asset Horizon, is

2266
02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:22.020
a really great guy and really. Really doing it

2267
02:07:22.020 --> 02:07:24.020
for the love of the game and love of

2268
02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:27.160
philosophy. And so, uh, that will be something that

2269
02:07:27.299 --> 02:07:30.140
people have to pay for, but, uh, that's something

2270
02:07:30.140 --> 02:07:32.299
I'm very excited about. I've I've never taught an

2271
02:07:32.299 --> 02:07:34.540
online course before, or you could say I've been

2272
02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:37.339
doing it for 4 years, but, uh, you know,

2273
02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:39.140
however you want to interpret it, so that I

2274
02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:40.700
have that coming up and I'm very excited. That

2275
02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:42.339
will be another place that people can find me

2276
02:07:42.339 --> 02:07:43.399
in the immediate future.

2277
02:07:44.419 --> 02:07:47.339
Great. Uh, LOOKING forward to that and thank you
