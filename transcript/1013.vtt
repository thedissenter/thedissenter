00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.940
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.920
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:09.939
joined by Dr Aaron Lukaszewski. He is associate professor

4
00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:12.420
in the Department of Psychology in the Center for

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.890
the Study of Human Nature at California State University

6
00:00:15.899 --> 00:00:20.299
Fullerton. And today we're talking about personality from an

7
00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:24.600
evolutionary perspective. So, Doctor Kazy, welcome to the show.

8
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.670
It's a pleasure to everyone. Pleasure to be here.

9
00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.490
So, uh tell us first from an evolutionary perspective,

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.099
how do you approach personality? I mean, theoretically speaking,

11
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.389
how do you basically think about personality, personality traits

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.849
and things like that?

13
00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:49.729
Yeah. Well, I mean, there's, there's a uh at

14
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.799
least two kind of distinct questions there um from

15
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.349
my standpoint. And so the, the first question um

16
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.040
would, would be, how do you approach the evolution

17
00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.009
of individual differences? Um And, and to sort of

18
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.739
reconcile that with the existence of a sort of

19
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.400
universal uh you know, species architecture. Um And then

20
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.379
the second question is, um or a second question

21
00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:17.599
could be um you know, the sorts of trait

22
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.720
constructs that are the units of analysis in personality

23
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.519
psychology. Um How do you go about studying uh

24
00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:27.769
those particular kinds of traits, um you know, versus

25
00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:31.459
taking other approaches. Um Now, when it comes to

26
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.410
the first question um about just the existence and

27
00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:38.419
origins of uh of individual differences and variation. Um

28
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.779
I mean, when I came into the field um

29
00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:44.059
in the two thousands, um and, and started uh

30
00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.800
doing my doctoral work in the Center for um

31
00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:51.269
Evolutionary Psychology um at U CS B. Um YOU

32
00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:53.750
know, just, just in the prior decade or so.

33
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.690
Um There had been um several, you know, what

34
00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:59.180
I consider to be seminal papers um that sort

35
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.150
of laid out um the theoretical foundations for how

36
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.489
to um approach the study of personality and individual

37
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.080
differences um by uh to be cosmides. Um And

38
00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.470
uh David Buss and Dan Nettle. Um And then

39
00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.279
in grad school, there was a seminal paper that

40
00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:17.399
came out on the evolutionary genetics of personality um

41
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.490
by uh Lars Pena, uh Jeff Denison and, and

42
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.570
Jeffrey Miller. Um And so all of those um

43
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.570
foundations were kind of my starting point and my,

44
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.679
um you know, my uh uh inspiration that got

45
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.110
me into this um area of study. But um

46
00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:35.869
you know, what they were interested in, I mean,

47
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.289
so, you know, the, the, the puzzle from an

48
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.130
evolutionary um standpoint um regarding the existence of individual

49
00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.070
differences is that natural selection um as it selects

50
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.130
for uh the uh fittest variants um tends to

51
00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.759
reduce um uh phenotypic and genetic variation, right, um

52
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.479
directionally um acting over time, right? So, uh but

53
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.300
nonetheless, um you have a variation abounding in natural

54
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:08.240
populations um with individuals varying in all sorts of

55
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.460
um different parameters. Um And so, you know, uh

56
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.369
the, the, the sort of evolutionary psychological framework overall

57
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.710
entails the assumption that um that humans are uh

58
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.369
character best characterized as a sort of constellation of

59
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.929
um species typical uh evolved um uh systems, right?

60
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.449
Uh EVOLVED behavioral regulation systems. And so, um you

61
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.750
know, the question is, is, you know, what's explaining

62
00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:39.500
um the the the the existence of the variation.

63
00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:41.350
Um AND there are a number of different proximate

64
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.889
and ultimate explanations that these earlier papers um identified,

65
00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.949
right? So, uh you know, um t being cosmides

66
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.889
had emphasized um the role of just sort of

67
00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:56.039
uh genetic noise in creating um personality differences, right?

68
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.860
So, um pathogen host cou uh is going on

69
00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:03.639
um and sort of constantly um you know, the,

70
00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:07.320
the the pathogen host cou arms race are constantly

71
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.110
changing, which genes promote optimal, uh you know, uh

72
00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:16.160
pathogen resistance from generation to generation. Um And those

73
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.950
genes also have uh impacts on all kinds of

74
00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.230
other things, right? Um And so that can result

75
00:04:21.238 --> 00:04:24.350
in psychological and behavioral variation that is, that is

76
00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:27.769
not itself um functionally or adaptively patterned um in

77
00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:30.500
any way. Um And, and then you always have

78
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.720
mutations um being introduced um into, to reproducing populations.

79
00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:36.839
So that's another source of sort of noisy um

80
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.600
genetic variation. Um And so, you know, the argument

81
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.470
uh that they put out is that they put

82
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.640
forth is that, you know, the sort of default

83
00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:47.799
assumption about the existence of variation should be that

84
00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:51.200
it's fundamentally noisy, right? Um And, and not really

85
00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:55.959
um functionally patterned um right, but they also acknowledge

86
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.929
and other people um elaborated the, the, the, the

87
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.459
viewpoint that um natural selection can also um create

88
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.940
and maintain um individual differences um uh through a

89
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.239
variety of, of different um uh ultimate mechanisms, right.

90
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.609
So, um fluctuating and, or balancing uh selection um

91
00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:17.170
on a, on a pit of continuum, for example,

92
00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:21.369
um uh can uh can, you know, create differences

93
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.510
across space or across time um and sort of

94
00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:28.929
average um distributions of uh of, you know, some

95
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.209
behavioral or psychological um dimension or, you know, of

96
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.480
course, morphological as well. Um And, and so you

97
00:05:36.489 --> 00:05:40.380
can have natural selection, actively maintaining um a variation

98
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.250
in a, in a variety of ways. Um And

99
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.470
so, you know, sort of outlining all of those,

100
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.059
you know, possibilities um uh was, was a major

101
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.859
um you know, contribution of this, of this, of

102
00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:56.570
this work in the nineties and two thousands. Um

103
00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:58.309
And so that's where I came into the field

104
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.250
and um you know, and started uh studying personality

105
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.130
now at that time, um you know, the, uh

106
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.170
you know, the, the most sort of tractable starting

107
00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:12.929
point was to say, OK, personality psychologists um have

108
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.380
figured out um uh you know, the, the sort

109
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.079
of main dimensions of personality that exist um by

110
00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:23.850
doing lots of um you know, sophisticated uh psychometric

111
00:06:23.859 --> 00:06:28.359
stuff and um quantitatively rigorous um uh you know,

112
00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:32.739
Multivariate analysis and, and so on. Um And so

113
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.089
I started with the extra version uh continuo um

114
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.670
and, and looking at it um sort of in

115
00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:42.000
a functional framework saying, OK, uh the, the, the

116
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.440
broad assumption um that guiding all of this, this,

117
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.440
this work is that um there can be um

118
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.720
tradeoffs between the costs and benefits um of different

119
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.290
uh trade levels, right? So, looking at the extraversion

120
00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:57.600
continuum, right, individuals who are high in extroversion, um

121
00:06:57.609 --> 00:07:00.470
you know, tend to uh seek status uh and

122
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.470
social attention um form relationships with, with lots of

123
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.579
people. Uh AND um you know, build coalitions, uh

124
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:11.109
draw attention to themselves, et cetera. Um And people

125
00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:14.170
who are lower on the extroversion continuum um you

126
00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:17.059
know, are, are less interested in uh in, in

127
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.940
those aspects of social life um and less interested

128
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.540
um in, in, in status uh and so forth,

129
00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:27.230
right? So, uh looking at the empirical associations that

130
00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:30.730
existed between um you know, the extroversion continuum and

131
00:07:30.739 --> 00:07:33.239
various life outcomes um and how people spend their

132
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.890
time uh then, then you can come to some

133
00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:40.019
ideas about, you know, um what, what um uh

134
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.130
factors in the environment, right? Or elsewhere. In the

135
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.410
phenotype, um might be uh modulating the, the magnitudes

136
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.890
of those costs and benefits along the continuum. Right.

137
00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:52.950
Uh And then you can get some, some traction

138
00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:56.799
on uh hypotheses about what might be, um what

139
00:07:56.809 --> 00:08:00.049
extroversion might be adaptively patterned in relation to. Right.

140
00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:03.190
For example, we found that um physically stronger, um

141
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.549
especially men, um uh tend to be higher in

142
00:08:06.559 --> 00:08:09.589
extroversion because they're more likely to get the benefits

143
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.609
of extroverted strategies and less likely to pay some

144
00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:15.589
of the costs, right? Like uh coming into conflict

145
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.350
with other people. Uh And so on, right? Um

146
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.339
So, uh that was, that was my sort of

147
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.059
uh entry into evolutionary personality science.

148
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.410
So there's lots of things to break down there.

149
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.320
Let me ask you perhaps first this question, uh

150
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.590
how do you approach personality traits? Uh uh I

151
00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:39.429
mean, from an evolutionary perspective, do you think of

152
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.090
them as adaptations or if not, what is exactly

153
00:08:45.099 --> 00:08:47.369
the kind of approach you have to them?

154
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.020
Right. Um So I think the answer to the

155
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:58.849
question is um yes, no. Um uh IT'S um

156
00:08:58.869 --> 00:09:02.380
possibly the wrong question, but it's also possibly the,

157
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.380
the, the right question. Um And uh so what

158
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.780
I mean by that is it, it depends on,

159
00:09:08.789 --> 00:09:13.340
um which uh uh you know, depends on what

160
00:09:13.349 --> 00:09:15.229
you mean by personality and it depends on what

161
00:09:15.239 --> 00:09:18.489
you mean by adaptation um in those contexts, right?

162
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.909
So, um in, uh you know, in the previous

163
00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:26.359
um section we were talking about, you know, there,

164
00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:30.109
there can be non functionally, non adaptively patterned um

165
00:09:30.119 --> 00:09:33.599
individual differences uh and variants. Um And so, in

166
00:09:33.609 --> 00:09:37.359
those cases, you're talking about um psychological and behavioral

167
00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:41.530
variation um that is not adaptively patterned and not

168
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:45.090
therefore generated by sort of an adaptive mechanism. Um

169
00:09:45.299 --> 00:09:48.500
Right, you can also have um uh individual differences

170
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:53.109
whether um you know, based inheritable variation um or

171
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.289
uh or generated through um a sort of a

172
00:09:57.299 --> 00:10:00.369
system of faculty of calibration, um a species typical

173
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.739
mechanism that generates variation contingently, um uh then you

174
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.359
can have individual differences that are um adaptively patterned

175
00:10:09.369 --> 00:10:12.219
um and would qualify as some sort of adaptation.

176
00:10:12.719 --> 00:10:18.090
Um uh RELATEDLY, there's the question of um the

177
00:10:18.099 --> 00:10:22.020
personality traits that, that exist as the units of

178
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:27.270
analysis and um personality psychology um right, are, are

179
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.109
those adaptations? Um And, you know, are they actually

180
00:10:32.119 --> 00:10:36.309
um kind of identifying um you know, unitary dimensions

181
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.849
of phenotypic variation um in the first place. Um

182
00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:43.200
And so I think that uh my answer to

183
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.219
that is that the, the systems that generate the,

184
00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:50.869
the personality concepts um and possibly many of the

185
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.820
personality concepts themselves um are adaptations, right? Um IN,

186
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.109
in the sense that we have uh an evolved

187
00:10:58.119 --> 00:11:03.390
psychology of person perception and prediction, right? Um uh

188
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.130
A personality assessment system, right? So, um the personality

189
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.190
assessment system is designed to uh you know, to,

190
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.070
to represent um dimensions along which people vary in

191
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:20.419
functionally significant ways. Um So, in differences between people

192
00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:23.270
that matter for me and deciding how to interact

193
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:28.299
with them. Um And, you know, uh I importantly,

194
00:11:28.309 --> 00:11:31.960
it's, you know, natural selection can favor a system

195
00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:35.780
that, that creates heuristic personality concepts and uses them

196
00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:39.500
to make decisions about other people. Um Even if

197
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.640
those concepts um are not really accurately mapping on

198
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.979
to um uh you know, the specific ways in

199
00:11:45.989 --> 00:11:47.960
which people differ from each other or the, or

200
00:11:47.969 --> 00:11:51.679
the mechanisms that are generating uh the variation. Right.

201
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.080
So, um so, you know, these heuristic trait concepts

202
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.640
can, can, you know, if they have greater than

203
00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:02.059
chance predictive utility, then natural selection can presumably um

204
00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.299
uh favor them. Right. So, um so yes, I

205
00:12:05.309 --> 00:12:07.479
think uh there, there are many open questions, by

206
00:12:07.489 --> 00:12:11.489
the way, um about our evolved psychology um of

207
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.640
person perception um and prediction. Um uh So we

208
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:20.789
have all these trait concepts, um sociable, conscientious, assertive,

209
00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:24.659
et cetera. Um Right. And now it's, it's, it's

210
00:12:24.669 --> 00:12:28.150
quite possible that many of these things are uh

211
00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:31.570
that many of these concepts are kind of cognitive

212
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.929
universals. Um But then, you know, there are, but

213
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.770
some may not be right. And there, and there

214
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.530
are also questions about uh you know, uh even

215
00:12:40.539 --> 00:12:43.289
if they are cognitive universals, in other words, you

216
00:12:43.299 --> 00:12:47.159
know, everywhere and every human uh population, um there

217
00:12:47.169 --> 00:12:50.429
exists um a concept that can be translated um

218
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.830
you know, into any language and so forth. Um

219
00:12:54.119 --> 00:12:57.119
You know, are, are those really sort of preprogrammed

220
00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:01.630
in some way, um, genomic uh pre specified um

221
00:13:01.669 --> 00:13:04.320
in their content? Right? Um Or are there more

222
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.789
basic conceptual primitives from which those are reliably, you

223
00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:12.659
know, emergently built um across development? Um uh So

224
00:13:12.669 --> 00:13:14.890
anyway, there, there are, there are various open questions.

225
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.520
Um uh But yes, I, I think that we

226
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.500
haven't evolved um psychology of person perception or difference

227
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.659
detection. Um uh YOU know, as uh as David

228
00:13:25.669 --> 00:13:30.219
has called it. Um So II, I don't know

229
00:13:30.229 --> 00:13:31.469
if that answers your question.

230
00:13:32.599 --> 00:13:35.289
Yeah. Uh uh LE let me ask you another

231
00:13:35.299 --> 00:13:38.359
kind of question now. So since we have different

232
00:13:38.369 --> 00:13:41.640
kinds of personality inventories, and I guess that at

233
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:45.409
least in the West, the most common one mo

234
00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:49.405
uh in personality side psychology is the big five.

235
00:13:49.414 --> 00:13:53.215
And then also the ex uh for example, uh

236
00:13:53.224 --> 00:13:57.534
I, I mean, uh uh would, should we expect

237
00:13:57.544 --> 00:14:02.510
for any kind of personality inventory to be at

238
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:07.460
the basis of an evolutionary approach to personality or,

239
00:14:07.469 --> 00:14:11.349
but basically how do you deal with the personality

240
00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.690
inventories that we have? And do you expect that

241
00:14:14.789 --> 00:14:19.130
any of them would be universal or not?

242
00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:23.989
Um I mean, I think, uh I, I think

243
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.369
that there is um pretty good evidence that something

244
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.690
like the big five or big six, you know,

245
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:38.140
uh it tends to replicate across um highly industrialized,

246
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:44.440
um urbanized societies, right? Um uh And um the

247
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:48.400
evidence is, is much less strong that um that

248
00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:52.460
those personality taxonomies generalize in their, in their Multivariate

249
00:14:52.469 --> 00:14:56.299
structure to uh you know, smaller scale populations, um

250
00:14:56.309 --> 00:15:00.219
indigenous uh communities. Uh AND, and, and so on.

251
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.479
Um And uh you know, there, so in, in

252
00:15:04.489 --> 00:15:09.200
thinking about this, um you know what i it's,

253
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.799
it's important to ask the question, what is a

254
00:15:11.809 --> 00:15:15.580
personality taxonomy? Um And where do they come from?

255
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.739
Right? Because the methods by which they're derived are

256
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.729
very important for thinking about the ontological status of

257
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:25.309
the resulting dimensions, right? So, um in personality psychology,

258
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.669
um these, these broad taxonomies that you're referring to

259
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.669
um were created through um the what's called the

260
00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:36.320
lexical approach, right? Which is to um basically start

261
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.320
with a comprehensive um set of uh in this

262
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.289
case, English um personality trait descriptors. So trait descriptive

263
00:15:43.299 --> 00:15:47.099
adjectives, um and then later corresponding, you know, statements

264
00:15:47.109 --> 00:15:50.539
designed to, you know, uh uh you know, capture

265
00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:53.849
the content of those adjectives. Um uh So, to

266
00:15:53.859 --> 00:15:56.219
have, you know, many tens of thousands of uh

267
00:15:56.229 --> 00:15:59.690
trait descriptive adjectives um have people rate themselves on

268
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.809
these rate other people on these. Um And then

269
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.179
um use factor analysis to identify the uh roughly

270
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:12.094
um independent dimensions that are defined by inter correlations

271
00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:15.895
among these trait descriptive adjectives, right? Um And, and

272
00:16:15.905 --> 00:16:18.734
they're, they're sort of designed, they're trained to be

273
00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:22.525
um roughly statistically independent dimensions so that you just

274
00:16:22.534 --> 00:16:26.775
minimize the overlap. Um And you know, among the,

275
00:16:26.784 --> 00:16:29.094
the, the marker dimensions in question. So, for example,

276
00:16:29.104 --> 00:16:33.494
the big 50 you know, um and you know,

277
00:16:33.505 --> 00:16:36.515
so this is um this is how they, they

278
00:16:36.525 --> 00:16:40.500
come to these um these uh taxonomies in the

279
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.919
first place. Um And you know, so the indi

280
00:16:43.929 --> 00:16:48.409
the the individual um personality concepts and corresponding sort

281
00:16:48.419 --> 00:16:52.619
of lexical descriptors um of uh of the, the,

282
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.159
you know, that go on to these dimensions. Um

283
00:16:55.229 --> 00:16:57.669
It could be the case that those exist um

284
00:16:57.679 --> 00:17:02.030
everywhere, right? Um That, that the specific personality concepts

285
00:17:02.039 --> 00:17:04.900
have a lot of universality, right? But what's in

286
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.900
question is whether at the population level um the

287
00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.579
uh you know, the, the big five factor structure

288
00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:15.900
actually winds up mapping onto the co variation patterns

289
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.819
um in, in all kinds of societies. I don't,

290
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.880
I don't see um a good a priori reason

291
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.439
to expect that that would be the case. Um

292
00:17:25.449 --> 00:17:27.939
Just given that, I mean, what's, you know, the,

293
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:31.290
the patterns of co variation reflect patterns of phenotypic

294
00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:35.119
variation? And so if the um if, if the

295
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:39.359
traits that exist on different axes in factor of

296
00:17:39.369 --> 00:17:43.030
factor space, um you know, are caused by different

297
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.109
things, then it, you know, if in different ecologies

298
00:17:46.119 --> 00:17:49.920
with different um ecological configurations and, and so on,

299
00:17:50.109 --> 00:17:51.420
um I think you can get all kinds of

300
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.500
different patterns of, of co variation. Um And um

301
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.579
so this was an idea that was tested by

302
00:17:57.859 --> 00:18:00.449
um you know, Mike Gurin and Chris Von Roden

303
00:18:00.459 --> 00:18:03.530
and their colleagues um uh where they took the

304
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:09.050
most commonly used um big five psychometric instrument, the

305
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.109
BF I. Um And um so Mike um is,

306
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.770
is one of the key figures involved with Theman

307
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:22.229
uh life history project. Um And um uh so

308
00:18:22.239 --> 00:18:24.380
they, they work with a, a group of um

309
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:29.400
indigenous um foreign horticulturalists in Oblivion, Amazon. And um

310
00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.239
so what they did is they went to uh

311
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.680
Timane land and they, they took the BF I

312
00:18:33.689 --> 00:18:36.969
and they translated it from Spanish uh into uh

313
00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.839
the indigenous language and, and back uh and then

314
00:18:39.849 --> 00:18:44.729
they um administered um the 4444 of the um

315
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.829
items in the, in the BF I uh to

316
00:18:47.839 --> 00:18:50.239
hundreds of people, um hundreds of Timane uh uh

317
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:55.420
residents. Um And they did this through kind of

318
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.050
a uh an interview format uh where they, because

319
00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.719
they're not, they're not accustomed to using um you

320
00:19:00.729 --> 00:19:03.010
know, like liquor type scales of 1 to 5

321
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.319
and, you know, circle, circle and number kind of

322
00:19:05.329 --> 00:19:08.160
thing. Um But they, they did a sort of,

323
00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.099
you know, some of that. Um And uh what

324
00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:15.060
they found was that the big five factors solution

325
00:19:15.069 --> 00:19:19.260
uh was nowhere to be found at all. Um

326
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.939
The, the, the factor structure looked very, very different

327
00:19:22.219 --> 00:19:24.619
um in the Timane um than it does in

328
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:29.479
any uh you know, uh weird society. Um And

329
00:19:29.489 --> 00:19:32.359
what they found instead was, you know, provisional evidence

330
00:19:32.369 --> 00:19:35.859
for um a Timane big two as they called

331
00:19:35.869 --> 00:19:37.489
it, right? Which is, I mean, that was a

332
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:42.699
very tentative labeling. Um But uh two broader dimensions

333
00:19:42.709 --> 00:19:45.670
um that were, that were defined by items from,

334
00:19:45.689 --> 00:19:49.819
you know, uh heterogeneous uh big five dimensions. Um

335
00:19:50.109 --> 00:19:52.660
So, no, I mean, I think the, the evidence,

336
00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:55.650
um the evidence from those sort of uh ethic

337
00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:59.099
studies suggest that, you know, the big five does

338
00:19:59.109 --> 00:20:01.280
not replicate everywhere. Um And, and nor do I

339
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.459
think we should expect it to. Um INCREASINGLY there's

340
00:20:05.469 --> 00:20:08.349
a work by, for example, um Amber Thaler and

341
00:20:08.359 --> 00:20:11.000
Gerard Saucier, and they're looking at, they're, they're building

342
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.420
sort of more, more emic um you know, personality

343
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:19.660
taxonomies that are specific to indigenous communities. Um And

344
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:23.270
uh you know, it, you know, it's, it's difficult

345
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.219
to imagine a world where you have just an

346
00:20:26.229 --> 00:20:28.930
emic taxonomy that only applies to uh you know,

347
00:20:28.939 --> 00:20:32.020
a single population. Um But nonetheless, it, you know,

348
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.670
they, it underscores the same conclusion that uh we,

349
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.790
we don't see a ton of universality and like

350
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.709
the, the population level correlation structures. Um So,

351
00:20:43.439 --> 00:20:46.260
yeah. Uh I mean, just to mention also that

352
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.640
if listeners or viewers are interested, I also have

353
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:53.270
on the show, an interview from 2018 with Doctor

354
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.780
Louis Goldberg, one of the big names behind the

355
00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.270
development of the big five personality traits inventory. And

356
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.449
also uh you mentioned there, Michael Gervin and Chris

357
00:21:04.459 --> 00:21:06.489
Van Rood and I also have interviews with them

358
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.130
and also with Gerard Socio. So if people are

359
00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.520
interested in learning more about the kinds of things

360
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.339
and the research you're mentioning there, I also have

361
00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:18.709
interviews on that. So um but when it comes

362
00:21:18.719 --> 00:21:24.426
to what explains interpersonal variation in personality traits from

363
00:21:24.436 --> 00:21:28.105
an evolutionary perspective. So I if I remember correctly,

364
00:21:28.115 --> 00:21:32.706
for example, in your first answer, you mentioned briefly

365
00:21:32.715 --> 00:21:38.696
how physical formidability might contribute to levels of extraversion.

366
00:21:38.706 --> 00:21:41.515
And I would imagine that would be classified as

367
00:21:41.586 --> 00:21:46.612
a contextual factor. And in your previous answer, you

368
00:21:46.621 --> 00:21:51.442
also mentioned things like ecological factors. So, uh of

369
00:21:51.452 --> 00:21:54.082
course, I would imagine that many different kinds of

370
00:21:54.092 --> 00:21:56.842
factors play a role here. But what would you

371
00:21:56.852 --> 00:22:00.562
say are perhaps some of the kind, the main

372
00:22:00.572 --> 00:22:05.661
kinds of factors that explain uh variation in personality

373
00:22:05.671 --> 00:22:06.401
traits?

374
00:22:09.069 --> 00:22:11.760
Yeah, I mean, I think, um you know, there's,

375
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.780
there's been work on, um you know, for example,

376
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:22.550
uh cross cultural, cross societal variation and the homicide

377
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.199
rate, right? Um AS an indicator of kind of,

378
00:22:25.209 --> 00:22:27.839
you know, environmental harshness and specifically, you know, levels

379
00:22:27.849 --> 00:22:30.869
of, of violence and, and uh you know, and

380
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.150
how that tracks, you know, average levels of, you

381
00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.349
know, uh paranoia and trust and uh you know,

382
00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:41.630
behavioral aggression and, you know, things that would be

383
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.739
functionally related to um you know, uh cross cross

384
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.040
societal variation and, and homicide risk. Um uh There's

385
00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:53.099
also been work on um the role of pathogen

386
00:22:53.109 --> 00:22:58.150
prevalence um in uh driving patterns of a variation,

387
00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.890
right, where you have higher um pathogen prevalence, you

388
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.239
have lower, for example, extroversion because it increases the

389
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.160
costs of, you know, interacting with lots of people

390
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.250
um to have a lot of disease risk uh

391
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:15.040
neurology. Um And um you know, we've also done

392
00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:19.430
work on uh the niche diversity uh hypothesis um

393
00:23:19.439 --> 00:23:24.069
which uh which is more about um uh explaining

394
00:23:24.079 --> 00:23:27.430
why we seem to, it, it, it, it may

395
00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:31.770
be the case that there's, there's less uh there's,

396
00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.229
there's more co variation um in societies with a

397
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:39.890
smaller number of social and occupational niches um than

398
00:23:40.069 --> 00:23:44.069
uh than in um uh you know, weird societies

399
00:23:44.079 --> 00:23:46.760
where, and there's a lot of niche diversity, right?

400
00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:50.109
There are many, many different um specializations, social and

401
00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:54.780
occupational specializations um that uh that each have a

402
00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:59.930
different sort of optimal incentivized, Multivariate personality profile. Um

403
00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:02.670
And so, you know, um the, the work we've

404
00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.729
done is pretty provisional and there are alternative explanations

405
00:24:05.739 --> 00:24:09.369
um for the patterns we've documented. But uh you

406
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:14.040
know, when we have nation level, um uh proxies

407
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.979
for societal niche diversity, right? You see uh niche

408
00:24:17.989 --> 00:24:22.410
diversity um across societies being inversely related to uh

409
00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:26.109
the, the, the overall sort of amount of co

410
00:24:26.189 --> 00:24:29.329
variation you, you observe in those um societies. And

411
00:24:29.339 --> 00:24:31.619
that was sort of an explanation that came out

412
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.900
of speculating about what explains the, the Tsimane results

413
00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:38.900
um from Mike Gurban study, right? Um What explains

414
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.459
why we see so much more co variation and

415
00:24:41.469 --> 00:24:44.430
the Shimane. Um AND it's differently configured um on

416
00:24:44.439 --> 00:24:47.280
top of that. Um And so, uh this is

417
00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.790
sort of a general explanation that came out of

418
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.760
uh you know, that that particular uh observation.

419
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.790
So uh earlier, you've also mentioned how it seems

420
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.670
that there's more or, or there seems to be

421
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.819
more uh a variation in personality traits uh across

422
00:25:05.829 --> 00:25:10.540
traditional societies. Let me ask you specifically about word

423
00:25:10.645 --> 00:25:15.015
you've done uh in Colombo Ecuador with a group

424
00:25:15.025 --> 00:25:19.535
of horticultural foragers. Uh What did you study there

425
00:25:19.545 --> 00:25:23.685
and tell us specifically, I guess about calibration and

426
00:25:23.694 --> 00:25:27.064
fitness linked correlates of personality.

427
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.170
Yeah. Um So this is, uh this is work

428
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:37.890
in Kambo Ecuador, um which is a community of,

429
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:43.160
uh, you know, horticultural foragers. Um And um this

430
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.800
is the field site of John Patton and Brenda

431
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.510
Bowser that they've maintained for, you know, three decades

432
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.500
or so, um uh making regular visits um back

433
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.380
to collect data. Um And, uh you know, in

434
00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:00.920
this case, so John um tragically passed away uh

435
00:26:00.939 --> 00:26:03.359
a year and a half or so ago. Um

436
00:26:03.369 --> 00:26:06.180
And so this, these were data we collected, um,

437
00:26:06.209 --> 00:26:10.589
you know, before that, of course. Um And um

438
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.599
this, uh I mean, the idea of the study

439
00:26:13.609 --> 00:26:15.859
was to just actually get sort of pilot data

440
00:26:15.869 --> 00:26:20.729
on, you know, testing, um uh you know, replication

441
00:26:20.739 --> 00:26:24.310
and extension of, um some of my personality findings

442
00:26:24.319 --> 00:26:27.329
um in, in Kambo and, you know, we were,

443
00:26:27.339 --> 00:26:30.189
we were thinking we would, you know, uh build

444
00:26:30.199 --> 00:26:32.819
that out and, you know, do a bunch more

445
00:26:32.829 --> 00:26:35.910
with a sort of more comprehensive personality, um taxonomy,

446
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.050
emic and etic and all that. But, you know,

447
00:26:38.329 --> 00:26:43.569
um unfortunately, uh yeah, uh uh that's not happening

448
00:26:43.579 --> 00:26:45.780
at the moment. Um But yes, so in this

449
00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:49.239
study, we, we, we just had three personality uh

450
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:53.329
concepts, um three dimensions of personality that were sort

451
00:26:53.339 --> 00:26:57.910
of taken from the Hexaco and big five taxonomies.

452
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.660
And our questions were um first, you know, do

453
00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.770
these personality concepts exist um in the minds of

454
00:27:03.939 --> 00:27:09.180
Kambo villagers? Um And um uh you know, and

455
00:27:09.189 --> 00:27:12.270
then also do, you know, can we reliably uh

456
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.989
assess those um you know, individual differences in, in

457
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.170
those personality traits? Um And do they uh do

458
00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.910
they track the things that they theoretically should um

459
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.719
fitness link outcomes in this case? Um uh FERTILITY

460
00:27:25.729 --> 00:27:29.329
and status in the community? Um And uh are

461
00:27:29.339 --> 00:27:33.650
they predicted by um uh physical strength um which,

462
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.689
which John um had a way of collecting in

463
00:27:35.699 --> 00:27:39.839
the field? Um So, uh you know, the, the

464
00:27:39.849 --> 00:27:42.500
basic, the, the provisional answer to the question of

465
00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:48.010
do these personality concepts? Um BASICALLY um uh fearfulness,

466
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:54.160
um extroversion and immodesty. Um YOU know, do they

467
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.550
exist in Kambo? And the answer was yes, because

468
00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.010
there were translations of those into the indigenous languages.

469
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.630
Um A a second test of that was um

470
00:28:04.689 --> 00:28:07.680
uh well, it it came out of the um

471
00:28:07.689 --> 00:28:11.780
reliability um of people's rankings of each other on

472
00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:15.020
those dimensions. So um this was a method that

473
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.479
um that John uh you know, was was involved

474
00:28:18.489 --> 00:28:21.119
in kind of creating but uh he uses a

475
00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:25.109
photo ranking um task that sort of round robin

476
00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:27.359
in the community, right? So all the men uh

477
00:28:27.369 --> 00:28:31.770
will rank each other um on a given personality

478
00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:35.709
concept, let's say extraversion, right? Um INCLUDING themselves. And

479
00:28:35.719 --> 00:28:37.709
they do this by, they have a photo of

480
00:28:37.719 --> 00:28:42.050
each um each, each person in the community and

481
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.849
then they arrange them from highest to lowest um

482
00:28:44.859 --> 00:28:48.589
on a given dimension. Um And everybody does this

483
00:28:48.599 --> 00:28:51.770
uh for everybody else. Um And, and so you

484
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.989
have a lot of data going into each personality

485
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.469
score. Um And you can also assess, do people

486
00:28:56.479 --> 00:29:00.369
agree, right? Um Is there inter ranker agreement? And

487
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.319
so the inter ranker agreement was uh was quite

488
00:29:03.329 --> 00:29:07.189
high for um both um extroversion and um and,

489
00:29:07.199 --> 00:29:12.619
and modesty. Um uh And um among both men

490
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:16.300
and women. Um And then those in turn, were,

491
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:19.939
were predicted by men's physical strength, um physically stronger

492
00:29:19.949 --> 00:29:23.209
men um even controlling for age and other things

493
00:29:23.219 --> 00:29:26.619
um were higher and extroversion. And uh and in

494
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:31.219
immodesty which was highly correlated with extroversion. Um AND

495
00:29:31.229 --> 00:29:34.859
uh and, and men higher in um extroversion and

496
00:29:34.869 --> 00:29:39.680
immodesty had more uh offspring. Um And uh the

497
00:29:39.689 --> 00:29:43.000
same basic patterns. Um ASIDE from the physical strength

498
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:46.599
uh uh correlation um were observed for women. So,

499
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.880
um right, so these are, are, you know, the,

500
00:29:50.199 --> 00:29:53.719
the together the data suggests that um these specific

501
00:29:53.729 --> 00:29:56.119
personality concepts sort of, you know, in this case,

502
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:59.890
imported from the big five and Hexaco taxonomies um

503
00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.579
exist with common meaning in the minds of Kambo

504
00:30:02.589 --> 00:30:07.280
villagers. Um AND individual differences on those dimensions um

505
00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:11.959
appear adaptively patterned um in relation to physical strength,

506
00:30:11.969 --> 00:30:16.030
which is a hypothesized calibrator of those dimensions. Um

507
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.589
And um uh and in terms of fitness linked

508
00:30:19.599 --> 00:30:23.750
outcomes, right, um personality was especially strongly tied to,

509
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.790
to status, right? Extroversion and immodesty correlated with um

510
00:30:27.829 --> 00:30:30.589
with social rank in the community very, very strongly.

511
00:30:32.709 --> 00:30:37.770
So, uh in a more sort of broader question,

512
00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:41.250
do you think that there are broader lessons about

513
00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:45.930
personality traits that we can learn from studying this

514
00:30:45.939 --> 00:30:49.170
sort of more traditional societies?

515
00:30:51.339 --> 00:30:55.089
Uh Yeah, absolutely. Um I, I think that um

516
00:30:55.739 --> 00:31:00.119
uh I mean, there's, there's a lot of value

517
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:04.479
in just um you know, testing the consistency of

518
00:31:04.489 --> 00:31:08.040
both the content of the personality concepts um uh

519
00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:12.449
and the, the correlations with outcomes in people's lives.

520
00:31:12.459 --> 00:31:15.439
Um AND so on um in as many, you

521
00:31:15.449 --> 00:31:19.920
know, diverse ecologies as possible, um uh especially when,

522
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.790
um but, you know, the, the, the hypothesis in

523
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.930
question being tested, um posits, you know, uh you

524
00:31:27.939 --> 00:31:30.609
know, species typicality or, you know, some kind of

525
00:31:30.619 --> 00:31:35.709
universality. Um So that's, that's always inherently valuable. Um

526
00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:38.170
And, you know, I think we can also learn

527
00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:41.310
a lot about the development of personality concepts um

528
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.560
by, uh you know, testing, um you know, the

529
00:31:45.569 --> 00:31:50.260
universality of those. Um And, uh you know, and,

530
00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:53.020
and also looking at, you know, um cases in

531
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:56.819
which a given personality concept doesn't seem to exist

532
00:31:56.829 --> 00:31:59.160
uh in a particular society, then the question is

533
00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:02.119
why, um and you know, why does it seem

534
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.410
to exist in lots of other societies? Um uh

535
00:32:05.939 --> 00:32:08.660
And, and then, um and then there's the question

536
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:13.410
of personality structure um uh which uh you know,

537
00:32:13.849 --> 00:32:16.790
um which is to say, or do the patterns

538
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.670
of, of correlation among different uh aspects of personality

539
00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:25.459
um replicate similarly in, you know, in, in all

540
00:32:25.469 --> 00:32:28.939
societies. Uh OR is there um just too much

541
00:32:28.949 --> 00:32:34.030
variation to uh to even start creating a human

542
00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.790
specific taxonomy of personality dimensions?

543
00:32:39.239 --> 00:32:42.680
So uh in one of your papers, uh I

544
00:32:42.689 --> 00:32:47.219
read you arguing that in personality science, it would

545
00:32:47.229 --> 00:32:50.339
be important for us to distinguish between the three

546
00:32:50.349 --> 00:32:56.979
different key goals, namely, description, prediction and explanation. I,

547
00:32:56.989 --> 00:33:01.180
I mean, could you explain each of those goals

548
00:33:01.189 --> 00:33:04.189
and why do you think it is important for

549
00:33:04.199 --> 00:33:06.339
people to distinguish between them?

550
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.709
Yes. Um So the, the paper you're, you're talking

551
00:33:11.719 --> 00:33:14.300
about was written by a whole bunch of authors.

552
00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:16.119
Um And it came out of kind of a

553
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:18.439
think tank uh workshop. I think it was in

554
00:33:18.449 --> 00:33:24.560
2018. Um And uh it's important to note that

555
00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:27.239
uh the all the authors might not agree with,

556
00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.979
with every statement in the paper uh when, when

557
00:33:29.989 --> 00:33:32.489
you have that kind of a, you know, a,

558
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.819
a mission statement. Um But I, I do agree

559
00:33:35.829 --> 00:33:38.540
in general that, that those are distinct goals, right?

560
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.670
That you have uh you know, the the goal

561
00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.420
of description. Uh So here was my, I'll just

562
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:45.989
start with my problem with, with that. OK. So

563
00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:48.800
um think about like Venn diagram space, you have

564
00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:54.859
description prediction and explanation, right? Um So explanation is

565
00:33:54.869 --> 00:33:57.849
about uh you know, doing really what I'm probably

566
00:33:57.859 --> 00:34:00.660
most interested in, right, which is uh looking at

567
00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:04.260
the uh the, you know, identifying the mechanistic underpinnings

568
00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:08.100
of the variation that gets captured in personality constructs.

569
00:34:08.408 --> 00:34:10.029
Um And that's what a lot of other more

570
00:34:10.039 --> 00:34:13.628
social cognitive um personality scientists are interested in doing

571
00:34:13.638 --> 00:34:17.349
as well and functional functionalists of various kinds. Um

572
00:34:17.358 --> 00:34:19.969
Then you have the people who are interested in

573
00:34:19.978 --> 00:34:23.708
prediction um which is to say, you know, they

574
00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:26.810
might even be skeptical that you can uh infer

575
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:31.330
mechanistic explanations uh uh uh in in some cases

576
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.668
or, or question the value of doing it because

577
00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.250
what they're interested in doing is basically using essentially,

578
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.790
you know, machine learning type models to just sort

579
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.139
of figure out uh you know, what data can

580
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:44.824
we collect about people that allows us to predict

581
00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:47.864
stuff about their behavior and their life outcomes. Um

582
00:34:47.875 --> 00:34:50.293
And you know, and you know that goal, the

583
00:34:50.304 --> 00:34:52.594
prediction goal on its own, you might not care

584
00:34:52.603 --> 00:34:55.074
if you're accurately carving up the human phenotype at

585
00:34:55.083 --> 00:34:57.905
its joints. Um AT all, right. Um As long

586
00:34:57.915 --> 00:35:00.745
as you're able to forecast what's gonna happen um

587
00:35:00.754 --> 00:35:03.745
and increase the sort of incremental uh prediction, right?

588
00:35:04.034 --> 00:35:06.864
Um So, so that's that goal. Um And then

589
00:35:06.875 --> 00:35:09.594
you have description which overlaps with both of those,

590
00:35:09.604 --> 00:35:12.810
right? Um But my question was always the part

591
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.360
of description that doesn't overlap with either prediction or

592
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.639
explanation. What good is it? Um And uh you

593
00:35:19.649 --> 00:35:22.239
know, on its own as an intrinsic uh goal

594
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.290
that's irrelevant to either prediction or to explanation. But

595
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.340
I think really the answer winds up being that

596
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.830
you, you gotta start, you know, in, in some

597
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.520
cases, it's useful to just start with description. Uh

598
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.689
And then maybe later on it, it becomes apparent.

599
00:35:36.699 --> 00:35:39.860
Um YOU know, which, which things that were described,

600
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.790
uh you know, do have some kind of uh

601
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.919
utility in, in describing or explaining or predicting or

602
00:35:46.929 --> 00:35:51.129
explaining uh if that uh if that makes any

603
00:35:51.139 --> 00:35:52.449
sense? Mhm

604
00:35:52.649 --> 00:35:54.860
uh But, but do you think uh I mean

605
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.350
here ju just to be perhaps a little bit

606
00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.479
more concrete, do you think that if people do

607
00:36:00.489 --> 00:36:04.429
not keep in mind the distinction between these three

608
00:36:04.439 --> 00:36:08.590
different kinds of goals, perhaps there would be problems

609
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:13.350
for personality science in terms of how people theorize

610
00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.020
about personality and personality traits and how they approach

611
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:21.719
methodologically, the study of each of these three kinds

612
00:36:21.729 --> 00:36:24.010
of, uh, goals.

613
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.800
Yeah, a, a absolutely. And I mean, I think,

614
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:31.270
um, you know, uh a lot of times a

615
00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.850
parent disagreement comes out of the fact that, um,

616
00:36:34.989 --> 00:36:38.320
that people have different, different, different goals in mind.

617
00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.040
Um AND so therefore disagree about, you know, which

618
00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:44.699
methods are appropriate. Uh And which types of theoretical

619
00:36:44.709 --> 00:36:48.179
frameworks are, are useful. Um And which inferences are

620
00:36:48.189 --> 00:36:52.010
warranted. Um uh So, you know, I mean, I

621
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.469
think, uh you know, to me it's, it's difficult

622
00:36:55.479 --> 00:36:59.590
to imagine um like not caring about explanation, like,

623
00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.080
you know, my uh you know, my professional focus

624
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:06.229
is sort of trying to map the contents of

625
00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:10.159
human nature. Um uh And, you know, um figure

626
00:37:10.169 --> 00:37:13.510
out what kind of ape we are. Um And

627
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.320
um you know, with, with the, with the goal

628
00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:19.290
of pure prediction, um you know, you don't necessarily

629
00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:23.169
uh care about that at all. Um And in

630
00:37:23.179 --> 00:37:26.810
fact, if, you know, you would discard potentially um

631
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.330
a uh a better mechanistic explanation, um that's, that's

632
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.780
more accurate, closer to the truth or whatever um

633
00:37:34.939 --> 00:37:37.669
uh in favor of, you know, a model that

634
00:37:37.679 --> 00:37:41.770
can uh that can predict stuff, you know. Um

635
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.989
So, uh so, yeah, I think people do, you

636
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.060
know, just, just keeping in mind that um a

637
00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:53.030
given research program uh might have goals that are,

638
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:57.439
although within the domain of personality, um, fundamentally kind

639
00:37:57.449 --> 00:38:00.389
of different and in some cases there's non overlapping

640
00:38:00.399 --> 00:38:03.899
parts of, uh, you know, of, of those goals.

641
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.989
Uh, BUT, but, I mean, it's not a problem

642
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.229
if different researchers tend to focus their research and

643
00:38:12.239 --> 00:38:16.989
personality on one of these key goals. Right. It's

644
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.649
just that they probably should keep in mind that

645
00:38:20.909 --> 00:38:24.300
the other two are also important if we want

646
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:28.979
to have and develop a full understanding eventually of

647
00:38:28.989 --> 00:38:31.830
how human personality works.

648
00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.139
Right. Yeah, absolutely. Yes. Um Yeah, I think as

649
00:38:36.149 --> 00:38:38.929
long as people are, you know, are clear about

650
00:38:38.939 --> 00:38:43.060
what their goals are. Um THEN uh then it's

651
00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.830
all great, you know, I mean, I think a

652
00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.379
lot of the work being done by, by people

653
00:38:47.389 --> 00:38:49.949
who don't care about an explanation um is really

654
00:38:49.959 --> 00:38:54.510
impressive and interesting and, you know, uh quantitatively powerful

655
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.270
and uh and all those things and, and also

656
00:38:57.449 --> 00:39:01.439
um has applications in, you know, real world contexts

657
00:39:01.449 --> 00:39:04.590
and organizations, you know, organizations want to know about

658
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.110
these things. Like they don't care if, if you're

659
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.030
like getting the science of the mind right they

660
00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.959
care about. Can you tell me, you know, you

661
00:39:12.969 --> 00:39:14.635
know, which of these of people is gonna be

662
00:39:14.645 --> 00:39:17.675
the best in this role, you know. Um And,

663
00:39:17.685 --> 00:39:19.655
and I'm not saying that everybody doing that is,

664
00:39:19.665 --> 00:39:22.084
is getting it wrong. I'm just saying it's irrelevant,

665
00:39:22.094 --> 00:39:25.435
right? Whether, whether you're accurately identifying the sort of,

666
00:39:25.445 --> 00:39:29.314
you know, uh important personality characteristics, that map on

667
00:39:29.324 --> 00:39:32.114
in a clean way to underlying mechanisms or something.

668
00:39:32.415 --> 00:39:35.864
Um uh They, they, they simply don't care and

669
00:39:35.875 --> 00:39:38.594
nor should they, right. Um They're focused on, on

670
00:39:38.604 --> 00:39:41.264
the bottom line. Um So,

671
00:39:42.699 --> 00:39:45.679
uh so in your work, I've also read about

672
00:39:45.689 --> 00:39:50.699
the general factor of personality. Could you tell us

673
00:39:50.709 --> 00:39:54.750
what it is and if it is useful as

674
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.389
a construct in personality science?

675
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.399
Yeah. So the general factor of personality um refers

676
00:40:03.409 --> 00:40:07.739
to uh the correlations um among the big five

677
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:10.860
dimensions, right? So I mentioned before the big five,

678
00:40:12.199 --> 00:40:14.989
the big five personality traits are designed to be

679
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.060
orthogonal, which is to say uncorrelated with each other.

680
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:23.350
Um But nonetheless, uh you get correlations among them,

681
00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.500
uh no matter how hard you try not to

682
00:40:25.629 --> 00:40:29.989
um basically with, you know, uh psychometric surveys. Um

683
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.030
AND those correlations are all positive um uh positive

684
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.669
correlations directionally except for neuroticism which correlates negatively um

685
00:40:39.679 --> 00:40:42.489
with the rest um or several of the other

686
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.110
ones anyway. Um And so the, the, the general

687
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.760
factor of personality uh is it captures the common

688
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:51.530
variant shared by all of the big five personality

689
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.510
dimensions. Um Now, I don't think it's an unreasonable,

690
00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:00.780
um you know, possibility in a given population that

691
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.870
there would be, you know, uh overlap between, you

692
00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:07.379
know, some, some overlap at the population level uh

693
00:41:07.389 --> 00:41:12.330
between these dimensions. Um uh But, you know, uh

694
00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.449
you know, it's also possible that, that we're looking

695
00:41:15.459 --> 00:41:19.699
at a methodological artifact of, um, of the psychometric

696
00:41:19.709 --> 00:41:23.320
instruments being used to collect, uh, the self ratings

697
00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:27.239
or the ratings of other people. Right. Um, AND,

698
00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:30.439
and so there's, there's a, I haven't tracked the

699
00:41:30.449 --> 00:41:33.739
debate super closely but there's a debate between, uh,

700
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:36.199
people who think the GFP is real and reflects

701
00:41:36.209 --> 00:41:39.760
some kind of, uh, you know, general awesomeness factor

702
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:43.239
of human personality. Um, AND then there, uh, there

703
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.979
are people who, who, who think there's, uh you

704
00:41:45.989 --> 00:41:48.020
know, the evidence, the way that the evidence suggests

705
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:50.739
that it's a methodological artifact um that should not

706
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:55.399
be treated as a, a substantive personality contract. Um

707
00:41:55.729 --> 00:41:58.489
And uh you know, the same would be true

708
00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.949
for uh the um still higher order but lower

709
00:42:02.959 --> 00:42:06.479
order. So for example, there's um alpha and beta

710
00:42:06.739 --> 00:42:08.939
uh which are just below the big the, the,

711
00:42:08.949 --> 00:42:13.060
the the general factor of personality, right? Um And

712
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:17.699
those reflect specific um you know, combinations of correlations

713
00:42:17.879 --> 00:42:21.800
uh beneath the, the, the general factor. Um And

714
00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:25.320
what relations do they correspond to? Exactly.

715
00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:28.159
So if off the top of my head, remember,

716
00:42:28.169 --> 00:42:34.310
I think um uh beta is represents a positive

717
00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:40.129
correlation between extraversion and openness and um and, and

718
00:42:40.179 --> 00:42:43.719
alpha represents a co a correlation the, the inter

719
00:42:43.729 --> 00:42:46.919
correlations among the other three dimensions. Um THE other

720
00:42:46.929 --> 00:42:51.290
three big five dimensions. Um And uh you know,

721
00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.629
and, but then again, they both correlate positively with

722
00:42:54.639 --> 00:42:58.600
each other. Um WHICH that's the, the GFP, the

723
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:01.800
general factor of personality Um, so I don't, I

724
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.820
think my, my true answer to the question is,

725
00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:07.179
I don't know if I care. Um, IF the

726
00:43:07.189 --> 00:43:11.120
general factor of personality is real. Um, uh, AND,

727
00:43:11.129 --> 00:43:13.590
and that's, that's only because I don't, I, I

728
00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.189
don't know if there is an answer to it.

729
00:43:15.199 --> 00:43:19.949
I think, um, there might, those phenotypic dimensions with

730
00:43:19.959 --> 00:43:22.870
whatever be, whatever is being captured by them, might

731
00:43:22.879 --> 00:43:26.110
those things correlate a little bit in some populations

732
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.659
at least. Uh Yeah, sure. Um That's reasonable. Um

733
00:43:29.669 --> 00:43:31.360
uh You know, and, and you might also see

734
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:34.179
populations in which they're totally uncorrelated. Um When you

735
00:43:34.189 --> 00:43:37.959
look at the actual phenotypic variation, um you know,

736
00:43:37.989 --> 00:43:42.360
uh apart from the measurement um measurement error. Um

737
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:45.300
SO I'm not really sure.

738
00:43:46.229 --> 00:43:51.169
Uh BUT if the GFP is real, wouldn't it

739
00:43:51.179 --> 00:43:55.530
be sort of analogous to the G factor when

740
00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.469
it comes to intelligence or not?

741
00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.780
Yes. And that's very much how, uh how the,

742
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:03.750
you know, some of the proponents of the GFP

743
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.790
uh think of it, right? Uh They look at

744
00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:10.469
it as sort of a interpersonal effectiveness factor, right?

745
00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:12.540
Um As I said before, sort of how awesome

746
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:16.639
is your personality. Um uh I mean, all, you

747
00:44:16.649 --> 00:44:20.300
know, the GFP basically captures having AAA socially desirable

748
00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:23.800
personality, right? Uh But that also plays into the

749
00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:28.840
alternative explanation that socially social desirability biases in responding,

750
00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:32.479
for example, uh could create the, the GFP or

751
00:44:32.489 --> 00:44:35.320
other higher order factors as an artifact, right? Um

752
00:44:35.659 --> 00:44:39.250
IT'S, it's harder to argue that uh the Psychometric

753
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.360
G factor, uh you know, the intelligence G factor

754
00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:44.929
um is a, is a, is a method artifact

755
00:44:44.939 --> 00:44:47.449
because many of the tests, you know, uh are,

756
00:44:47.459 --> 00:44:50.239
are, you know, scored in entirely different metrics and

757
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.600
you know, it just to have sort of non

758
00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:57.040
overlapping um task demands and things like that. Um

759
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:59.250
But with, with the GFP, you're always looking at

760
00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:03.709
um correlations on uh you know, scales measured in

761
00:45:03.719 --> 00:45:06.040
a, in a, in a common metric. So method

762
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.070
artifact will always be a sort of alternative explanation.

763
00:45:09.469 --> 00:45:14.290
Um But my sense of people's assessment of the,

764
00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.419
of that debate is that the method artifact, people

765
00:45:17.429 --> 00:45:23.689
have won. Um uh And um uh you know,

766
00:45:23.699 --> 00:45:27.000
but of course, there's still some, some holdouts. So

767
00:45:27.729 --> 00:45:30.389
uh and uh OK, so uh just another question

768
00:45:30.399 --> 00:45:32.830
about it, do you think that if it was

769
00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:37.459
real, the general factor of personality that perhaps uh

770
00:45:37.469 --> 00:45:40.629
people who work on the big five or even,

771
00:45:40.639 --> 00:45:44.750
for example, the EXEC would have to perhaps uh

772
00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:50.649
rethink how they approach uh those personality traits because

773
00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:55.469
usually we hear from them that they vary independently

774
00:45:55.479 --> 00:46:00.310
from one another. But if a GFP was real,

775
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.149
I mean, would that still be the case?

776
00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.370
I don't really think so because the correlations are

777
00:46:07.379 --> 00:46:11.850
pretty weak. Um And uh it, it, I think

778
00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.020
it depends on what you're trying to do with,

779
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:16.459
with the, the, the, with the dimensions in in

780
00:46:16.469 --> 00:46:19.699
the trade taxonomy, right? Um Now, you, you mentioned

781
00:46:19.709 --> 00:46:22.080
you had Lou Goldberg on um uh you know,

782
00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:25.260
I think that the original, you know, goal of,

783
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:27.780
of creating the big five was not to identify

784
00:46:28.189 --> 00:46:32.770
like actual dimensions of phenotypic variation. Um But, but

785
00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.469
to sort of provide what they called marker dimensions

786
00:46:35.479 --> 00:46:38.209
in factor space, right? Just because what, what it

787
00:46:38.219 --> 00:46:40.780
was a solution to was the sort of jingle

788
00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:44.659
jangle problems. Um uh SO called jingle jangle problems,

789
00:46:44.669 --> 00:46:48.209
which means you have all these um personality psychologists

790
00:46:48.219 --> 00:46:51.290
out there each studying their own individual trait contracts

791
00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:53.979
and then it turned in, in their own research

792
00:46:53.989 --> 00:46:56.260
traditions and then it turns out that a bunch

793
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:58.250
of those are pretty much the same thing, right?

794
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.570
Um Just with different names and different groups of

795
00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:03.800
people um studying them, right? And so they said,

796
00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:05.810
well, this is crazy, you know, um we, we

797
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.370
need to have some like, you know, common agreed

798
00:47:08.379 --> 00:47:11.979
upon, um you know, multidimensional space where we can

799
00:47:11.989 --> 00:47:16.129
locate any particular, you know, uh trait construct as

800
00:47:16.139 --> 00:47:21.040
existing on or near uh or perhaps independent from

801
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:24.750
um one of these like higher order marker dimensions,

802
00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.889
right? So, thinking about it like that, you know,

803
00:47:27.899 --> 00:47:30.629
I think um it's not really a problem uh

804
00:47:30.639 --> 00:47:33.610
if, you know, if the, if the marker dimensions

805
00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:37.479
don't wind up being entirely orthogonal to each other.

806
00:47:37.709 --> 00:47:40.969
Um You know, we, we did a paper um

807
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:43.189
uh that also came out of that, that same

808
00:47:43.199 --> 00:47:45.879
think tank I referred to um led by David

809
00:47:45.889 --> 00:47:48.610
Kah and, you know, that had to do with

810
00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:51.949
creating uh personality taxonomies um sort of from the

811
00:47:51.959 --> 00:47:55.060
bottom up. Um AND not trying to impose a

812
00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:58.449
lot of higher order structure um onto them, right?

813
00:47:58.679 --> 00:48:00.729
Um Now it's still, you know, you still want

814
00:48:00.739 --> 00:48:04.169
to avoid um jingle jangle uh type issues, right?

815
00:48:04.439 --> 00:48:07.770
Um And have some sense of, you know, the,

816
00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.090
uh the, the, the content independence, um you know,

817
00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.070
of the different constructs uh in, in the overall

818
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:18.989
taxonomy. Um But it would allow for uh you

819
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.350
know, a more sort of granular view of, of

820
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.189
the units of analysis and also just, you know,

821
00:48:25.199 --> 00:48:28.320
provide more plasticity and thinking about, you know, uh

822
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:32.165
does this aspect of personality to this other aspect

823
00:48:32.175 --> 00:48:35.205
of personality? Um YOU know, and are they, how

824
00:48:35.215 --> 00:48:37.445
overlapping are they and things like that? You know,

825
00:48:37.455 --> 00:48:39.104
you could, you could have it, you could have

826
00:48:39.114 --> 00:48:42.314
that vary, right? Um ACROSS different populations, right? Which

827
00:48:42.324 --> 00:48:45.324
I think is more consistent with the complex reality

828
00:48:45.334 --> 00:48:49.264
um of uh uh you know, of personality space.

829
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:53.679
So I, I think we have time to get

830
00:48:53.689 --> 00:48:57.419
into one last topic here. Uh I mean, on

831
00:48:57.429 --> 00:49:01.469
a different topic, uh you've also done work on

832
00:49:01.689 --> 00:49:06.030
social status in human societies and the sort of

833
00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:10.300
costs and benefits of high social status, of course,

834
00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:14.110
the benefits from an evolutionary perspective uh seem more

835
00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:19.320
or less obvious because it usually translates into fitness

836
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.270
benefits, higher fitness, uh, I mean, all of that

837
00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.300
kind of stuff. But, uh, could you tell us

838
00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:31.020
basically what are the main benefits and also perhaps

839
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:35.919
less intuitively, what are the costs of high social

840
00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:37.860
status in human society?

841
00:49:39.629 --> 00:49:43.139
Yeah. Um, WELL, right. I mean, you, uh, you

842
00:49:43.149 --> 00:49:44.989
hit the nail on the head, identifying the benefits.

843
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.929
I mean, uh, the evidence is, is, um, you

844
00:49:48.939 --> 00:49:52.389
know, is pretty strong that having high status um

845
00:49:52.399 --> 00:49:55.689
in, at the community level um in, in pretty

846
00:49:55.699 --> 00:49:58.639
much any human society is associated with a range

847
00:49:58.649 --> 00:50:01.899
of, you know, privileges and prerogatives. Um And you

848
00:50:01.909 --> 00:50:04.090
know, how many people uh count you as an

849
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:08.449
ally and support you in coalitional, you know, situations.

850
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:12.770
Um AND uh and also with, with your reproductive

851
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.370
success um and, and health and all kinds of

852
00:50:16.379 --> 00:50:21.340
other uh you know, uh correlates. So, um so

853
00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:23.800
yeah, I mean, Chris Vonruden um and Adrian Yei

854
00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:28.899
have um probably the most comprehensive um analysis of

855
00:50:28.909 --> 00:50:31.209
this. And I mean, they're looking just at um

856
00:50:31.219 --> 00:50:34.050
well across primates, but a phylogenetic sort of meta

857
00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:38.050
analysis across uh male primates, including humans in, in,

858
00:50:38.479 --> 00:50:43.669
in uh smaller scale societies. Um And um you

859
00:50:43.679 --> 00:50:47.010
know, in, in general, yes, men uh well across

860
00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.780
primates, male primates, um if you look at the

861
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:53.469
correlation between rank and reproductive success in nonhuman male

862
00:50:53.479 --> 00:50:56.750
primates, like the average correlation is something like 0.7

863
00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.840
or 0.8 right? Um It basically tells a story

864
00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:01.780
of like, you know, for, if you're a male

865
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:04.750
primate, a nonhuman primate, pretty much the only thing

866
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.620
that you, that matters for your reproductive success is

867
00:51:07.629 --> 00:51:11.050
your rank in, in the social hierarchy. Right? Um

868
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.780
Now, you know, for humans, that's, that's watered down

869
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:16.760
quite a bit. Um Right, because uh there are

870
00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:20.489
various mechanisms across human evolution that have created um

871
00:51:20.659 --> 00:51:23.629
you know, what we refer to as leveling. Um

872
00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:28.479
Right, because as uh as humans, um you know,

873
00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:32.889
uh evolved a psychology that allowed them to um

874
00:51:32.899 --> 00:51:35.250
well, first depend on each other through various forms

875
00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.770
of mutual aid. Um And uh and, and also

876
00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:42.679
to reason flexibly and in sophisticated ways about um

877
00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:45.449
you know, uh coalitions. Um AND, you know, with

878
00:51:45.459 --> 00:51:47.270
the, with the aid of the use of grammatical

879
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.649
language and so on, um it, it became um

880
00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:54.919
uh much less viable for uh a high ranking

881
00:51:54.929 --> 00:51:58.459
male um to just take everything for himself, right?

882
00:51:58.469 --> 00:52:00.820
Um TO just take all the matings with fertile

883
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:03.949
females. Uh AND, you know, and keep all the

884
00:52:03.959 --> 00:52:07.189
good stuff and um you know, impose costs on

885
00:52:07.199 --> 00:52:12.310
others, um you know, uh indiscriminately um right, because

886
00:52:12.409 --> 00:52:16.449
uh subordinates could, could, could band together and um

887
00:52:16.459 --> 00:52:20.719
you know, collectively have more formidability than any individual

888
00:52:20.729 --> 00:52:24.419
bully, right? Um And so consequently, uh in human

889
00:52:24.429 --> 00:52:27.530
societies, you see a much weaker correlation between uh

890
00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:33.850
attained social rank and um reproductive success. Um And

891
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:34.989
uh you know, but it's still, I mean, it's

892
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.260
still a valuable thing to have, right? High status

893
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:39.899
is still reproductively valuable for, for human males, which

894
00:52:39.909 --> 00:52:41.590
is kind of one of the take home takeaway

895
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:45.330
messages. Um But uh you know, and we, and

896
00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:48.149
we saw that as well in the Kambo um

897
00:52:48.159 --> 00:52:52.399
data um with, with higher ranking men having more

898
00:52:52.409 --> 00:52:55.719
kids and higher ranking women having more kids. Um

899
00:52:56.169 --> 00:53:02.780
And um uh but anyway, so um what question

900
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:04.669
am I addressing here? What are the benefits? Yes,

901
00:53:04.679 --> 00:53:06.479
but yes, there are costs, right? I mean, if

902
00:53:06.489 --> 00:53:09.820
you are, um you know, uh if you're unlikely

903
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:12.189
to get the benefits of having high status because

904
00:53:12.199 --> 00:53:15.689
you're unlikely to achieve high status, right, then, you

905
00:53:15.699 --> 00:53:17.909
know, investing in the, in the pursuit of status

906
00:53:17.919 --> 00:53:22.300
um is uh it's a misallocation of resources, right?

907
00:53:22.629 --> 00:53:25.169
Uh Right, there are opportunity costs of, you know,

908
00:53:25.179 --> 00:53:28.699
status pursuit activities um because you're doing that and

909
00:53:28.709 --> 00:53:31.310
not other stuff um that might actually generate benefits

910
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.129
for you. Um Right, and so especially costly if

911
00:53:34.139 --> 00:53:38.290
you never, if you never actualize those benefits. Um

912
00:53:38.919 --> 00:53:41.179
And you know what we were talking about a

913
00:53:41.189 --> 00:53:44.639
moment ago, I mean, much of the um you

914
00:53:44.649 --> 00:53:47.070
know, the work I've been involved with in um

915
00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:50.629
in social status um has been about uh the

916
00:53:50.639 --> 00:53:53.639
acquisition of status, right? Um The different pathways there

917
00:53:53.649 --> 00:53:56.909
are to, to, to having to attaining high rank

918
00:53:56.919 --> 00:54:01.129
um in, in human communities. Um And, you know,

919
00:54:01.139 --> 00:54:05.129
so before, uh you know, in the 19 eighties

920
00:54:05.139 --> 00:54:08.330
and nineties, if you were studying human hierarchy, um

921
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.290
you were kind of importing like a primate model,

922
00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:14.020
right? Uh And, and you would tend to refer

923
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:16.679
to, you know, dominance hierarchies, right? And think about

924
00:54:16.969 --> 00:54:20.449
um hierarchy uh just purely in terms of, of

925
00:54:20.459 --> 00:54:24.459
dominance um and, and intimidation and coercion. Um uh

926
00:54:24.469 --> 00:54:26.449
WITH the assumption being that the highest, you know,

927
00:54:26.459 --> 00:54:28.429
the alpha male will be the, you know, the

928
00:54:28.439 --> 00:54:32.760
most badass uh male, right? For example. Um And

929
00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:36.219
then in uh you know, in 2001, um uh

930
00:54:36.229 --> 00:54:40.199
Joe Hendrick and Gil White um wrote a paper

931
00:54:40.229 --> 00:54:43.179
uh that was a major contribution because um it

932
00:54:43.189 --> 00:54:46.209
introduced uh you know, in human groups, the, the,

933
00:54:46.219 --> 00:54:49.750
the concept of prestige based hierarchies, right? Um That

934
00:54:50.084 --> 00:54:52.895
uh in humans, you also have freely conferred um

935
00:54:52.905 --> 00:54:57.405
deference um to prestigious individuals, right, who are perceived

936
00:54:57.415 --> 00:55:00.405
as having value for gene, you know, generating benefits

937
00:55:00.415 --> 00:55:03.445
uh for others in the community or having special

938
00:55:03.455 --> 00:55:06.074
talents that, you know, uh you know, people want

939
00:55:06.084 --> 00:55:08.965
to learn from, for example. Um And so this

940
00:55:08.975 --> 00:55:11.584
was a pathway um to high status in human

941
00:55:11.594 --> 00:55:15.205
groups. Um THAT was sort of phylogenetic um relatively

942
00:55:15.215 --> 00:55:19.459
unique. Um And, you know, so, so introducing the

943
00:55:19.469 --> 00:55:22.669
dominance, what, what became the dominance, prestige model um

944
00:55:22.689 --> 00:55:27.110
of social hierarchy uh was um you know, was

945
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.739
a major advance. Um WHAT we have, you know,

946
00:55:30.879 --> 00:55:34.489
sort of been in some discussions in the literature

947
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:38.389
about is uh the extent to which dominance as

948
00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:42.350
defined in the dominance prestige model um really exists

949
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.129
in any pure form um in human communities at

950
00:55:45.139 --> 00:55:48.709
all. Right. In other words, can an individual, um

951
00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:52.469
uh you know, uh just purely through coercion, um

952
00:55:52.479 --> 00:55:56.169
illicit deference from others that results in some meaningful,

953
00:55:56.179 --> 00:56:00.199
you know, elevated status uh within uh human community.

954
00:56:00.489 --> 00:56:04.129
Um And, you know, uh what we've, um you

955
00:56:04.139 --> 00:56:06.780
know, sort of po uh what, what we've um

956
00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:10.979
argued is that uh when you have behaviors that

957
00:56:10.989 --> 00:56:14.300
look dominant, assertive, aggressive, you know, and things like

958
00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:19.459
physical formidability, um uh uh predicting social status and

959
00:56:19.469 --> 00:56:22.570
how much social status other people think you deserve.

960
00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:25.780
Um It's mediated by the fact that strength can

961
00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:28.750
be used for, for both good and uh and

962
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:33.770
evil, right? Um uh So, you know, um physically,

963
00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:37.350
uh mo more formidable individuals um can use their

964
00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:41.719
formidability to generate benefits for um the community, right?

965
00:56:41.729 --> 00:56:45.370
By uh you know, um you know, for example,

966
00:56:45.379 --> 00:56:49.250
punishing cheaters and free riders. Uh AND, you know,

967
00:56:49.429 --> 00:56:51.629
uh incentivizing other people to do what they're supposed

968
00:56:51.639 --> 00:56:54.399
to do. Uh And uh and so on, right?

969
00:56:54.639 --> 00:56:57.860
Um And so, it's not necessarily the case when

970
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:59.830
you see, uh you know, in the dominance, prestige

971
00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:03.479
literature, um especially as it's applied in other disciplines

972
00:57:03.489 --> 00:57:06.139
and so on, it's very much the assumption that

973
00:57:06.149 --> 00:57:08.080
if you, if, you know, if you're high in

974
00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:11.209
dominance based status, you've got where you are through,

975
00:57:11.389 --> 00:57:14.350
um you know, imposing costs on others or threatening

976
00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.639
to and, and people are backing down to you

977
00:57:16.649 --> 00:57:19.100
out of intimidation, right? But as I said before,

978
00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:22.520
humans have, you know, subordinate leverage uh in, in

979
00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:26.909
virtually every community and organizational context, right, where subordinates

980
00:57:26.919 --> 00:57:31.610
can band together and uh prevent um aggressive individuals

981
00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:35.439
from uh right from taking what they don't deserve.

982
00:57:35.449 --> 00:57:39.169
Um And so, you know, uh the question, you

983
00:57:39.179 --> 00:57:41.689
know, we've been posing in the literature and, and

984
00:57:41.699 --> 00:57:45.800
uh you know, providing analysis to uh sort of

985
00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:49.919
highlight is um you know, this sort of prestige

986
00:57:49.929 --> 00:57:53.550
via dominance model seems to be able to explain

987
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:57.219
a lot of the observed correlations between um dominant

988
00:57:57.229 --> 00:58:01.260
traits and attain status, right? Um Now, we don't

989
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:05.570
necessarily think that that dominance based status is impossible

990
00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:08.659
or that it doesn't exist, right? And, but in

991
00:58:08.669 --> 00:58:10.739
the, I mean, it probably comes down to semantics

992
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:13.929
because it depends on how you define, uh you

993
00:58:13.939 --> 00:58:17.560
know, status, for example, right? Um If status is

994
00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:20.110
something that has to be sort of collectively acknowledged

995
00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:22.929
and sort of given to you, right, then you're

996
00:58:22.939 --> 00:58:25.479
very unlikely to get it through purely dominant and

997
00:58:25.489 --> 00:58:29.560
coercive tactics. Um Right. And uh but, but if,

998
00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:32.560
if status is defined as, for example, just having

999
00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:34.959
a reputation for being a bad ass that you

1000
00:58:34.969 --> 00:58:37.679
don't want to mess with, right, then, uh you

1001
00:58:37.689 --> 00:58:41.310
know, then, yeah, sure. Uh DOMINANCE based status certainly

1002
00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:44.070
would exist Right. Um, YOU can have a reputation

1003
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:47.979
for being, you know, uh, being formidable and someone

1004
00:58:47.989 --> 00:58:49.949
you, you don't want to mess with. Um, BUT

1005
00:58:49.959 --> 00:58:53.350
still, you know, maintain decent, you know, uh, relations

1006
00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:56.280
in the community. Ok. Um, IT doesn't mean you're

1007
00:58:56.290 --> 00:58:58.909
gonna be the highest ranking person at the community

1008
00:58:58.919 --> 00:59:01.780
level politically or whatever. Right. Um, BUT you would

1009
00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:05.239
have a form of dominance based status. Um, SO,

1010
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.090
yeah, the work we've been doing with um yeah,

1011
00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:09.919
uh Patrick Dukey and, and David buss and Jim

1012
00:59:09.929 --> 00:59:12.739
Rooney and Cameron Anderson has been uh just trying

1013
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:16.219
to, you know, uh you know, break the concepts

1014
00:59:16.229 --> 00:59:19.750
of dominance, prestige down into their um sort of,

1015
00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:21.199
you know, constituent components.

1016
00:59:22.719 --> 00:59:24.830
Uh But uh I, I mean, I'm not sure

1017
00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:29.750
if you touched a lot on the cost side

1018
00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:33.340
of the question there. So if someone has high

1019
00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:38.110
social status in human societies, either through dominance or

1020
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:42.340
through prestige, what might be some of the costs

1021
00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:44.260
that they might incur?

1022
00:59:45.399 --> 00:59:47.370
Well, I mean, I think the, the, so the

1023
00:59:47.379 --> 00:59:50.399
costs um it's mostly net benefit, right? So if

1024
00:59:50.409 --> 00:59:53.320
you're, if you're um you know, a high ranking

1025
00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:57.379
person in, in a human community, um uh you

1026
00:59:57.389 --> 01:00:00.050
know, there are costs, right? But uh you know,

1027
01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.879
so for example, um everybody wants stuff from you

1028
01:00:02.889 --> 01:00:05.209
all the time, right? Uh You sort of have

1029
01:00:05.219 --> 01:00:09.100
an obligation to uh you know, perform certain political

1030
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.870
roles usually. Um I mean, it's gonna be obviously

1031
01:00:11.879 --> 01:00:14.814
highly variable whether you're talking about an organization context

1032
01:00:14.824 --> 01:00:18.594
or, you know, a small scale community. Um AND,

1033
01:00:18.604 --> 01:00:21.104
and then across small scale communities. But, you know,

1034
01:00:21.114 --> 01:00:22.715
it's gonna tend to be the case that if

1035
01:00:22.725 --> 01:00:26.274
you have high status, um you have obligations, right?

1036
01:00:26.284 --> 01:00:29.754
Um You know, you have implicit or explicit obligations

1037
01:00:29.764 --> 01:00:33.449
to other people in the community uh to intervene

1038
01:00:33.459 --> 01:00:36.889
in third party conflicts um to uh you know,

1039
01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:41.620
again, provide political leadership um to mediate uh conflicts

1040
01:00:41.629 --> 01:00:45.129
between households, um possibly in some cases to, you

1041
01:00:45.139 --> 01:00:47.760
know, to, to provide right, to give up resources

1042
01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:50.560
when other people are without, right? And, and so

1043
01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:53.399
all kinds of things um uh that, that are

1044
01:00:53.409 --> 01:00:55.679
kind of expected of you. Now, if you're able

1045
01:00:55.689 --> 01:00:58.459
to maintain, you know, the, the the high ranking

1046
01:00:58.469 --> 01:01:01.739
position, however, uh by doing those things that yes,

1047
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:04.530
come at a cost, right? Then the evidence suggests

1048
01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.139
that it's, it's worth it reproductively, right? Because you've

1049
01:01:07.149 --> 01:01:10.169
been able to attain high status and then you've

1050
01:01:10.179 --> 01:01:12.500
uh been able to uh you know, at least

1051
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:16.110
probabilistically on average, um you know, cash in uh

1052
01:01:16.179 --> 01:01:20.260
on, on, on the uh investment, right? Um But

1053
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:22.770
I mean, there, there probably are cases where, you

1054
01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:26.689
know, because of resource scarcity or whatever uh you

1055
01:01:26.699 --> 01:01:29.370
know, having high status just isn't worth it, right?

1056
01:01:29.379 --> 01:01:31.929
The juice isn't worth the squeeze. Um And, and

1057
01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:34.570
maybe some individuals wind up being, having high status

1058
01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:37.629
in the community over time and, you know, because

1059
01:01:37.639 --> 01:01:40.709
of all the obligation and, you know, everything else,

1060
01:01:40.719 --> 01:01:43.209
it just doesn't wind up paying off. Um You

1061
01:01:43.219 --> 01:01:45.719
know, uh so, yeah, I mean, I think, you

1062
01:01:45.729 --> 01:01:47.520
know, I'm, I'm talking about things in the aggregate,

1063
01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:50.600
right on average. Uh The data suggests that, you

1064
01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:53.780
know, uh it's really mostly benefit. Um You know,

1065
01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:55.780
once, once you, once you are in a high

1066
01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:58.560
ranking, you know, sort of position in the minds

1067
01:01:58.570 --> 01:02:01.360
of people in your community, uh this form of

1068
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:04.979
kind of social capital is uh is net beneficial.

1069
01:02:05.149 --> 01:02:07.080
Uh But yes, comes along with various, it's a

1070
01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:11.270
double edged sword, right? Um uh Various obligations to

1071
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.479
other people that you probably often wish you didn't

1072
01:02:13.489 --> 01:02:13.850
have.

1073
01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:16.889
Uh And I would imagine that uh at least

1074
01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:22.709
in some contexts being um high social status would

1075
01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:26.070
induce a lot of stress because of you having

1076
01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.909
to provide and having to intervene and having to

1077
01:02:29.929 --> 01:02:33.810
do stuff for other people to keep also because

1078
01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:37.175
the social that has to be maintained, right? And

1079
01:02:37.185 --> 01:02:39.405
I guess that's another aspect to it. It's not

1080
01:02:39.415 --> 01:02:42.875
just that you acquire it and it's there forever.

1081
01:02:42.885 --> 01:02:45.004
You have to maintain it as well.

1082
01:02:45.014 --> 01:02:47.254
Right. Right. Absolutely. Yes. You, you have to, you

1083
01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.385
have to make sure that you're maintaining your political

1084
01:02:49.395 --> 01:02:52.084
support uh for all the people that have, you

1085
01:02:52.094 --> 01:02:55.965
know, supported you, um you know, previously, uh and

1086
01:02:55.975 --> 01:02:59.479
don't run afoul of those people. Um And, you

1087
01:02:59.489 --> 01:03:02.699
know, uh you know, again, deal with deal with

1088
01:03:02.709 --> 01:03:07.060
the politics of conflict between your allies, you know?

1089
01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:10.479
Uh, FOR example. Right. Um, BECAUSE, you know, I

1090
01:03:10.489 --> 01:03:12.810
mean, whatever, if you lose both allies then that's

1091
01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:16.510
destabilizing. Uh, YOU know, I mean, even, even, uh,

1092
01:03:16.629 --> 01:03:19.379
you know, chimpanzees and, uh, pigtail macaques deal with

1093
01:03:19.389 --> 01:03:22.330
these kind of politics. Right. Um, WHERE, you know,

1094
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.280
the alpha, alpha male needs to, to make sure

1095
01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:26.870
he at least maintains his alliances with the next

1096
01:03:26.879 --> 01:03:30.520
two ranking males or whatever, right? Um And, you

1097
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:33.439
know, because they can decide to depose him, uh

1098
01:03:33.449 --> 01:03:36.689
you know, and, and, and frequently do um and

1099
01:03:36.699 --> 01:03:40.250
even alliances, you know, uh with, with females um

1100
01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.899
who can sometimes form multi individual uh you know,

1101
01:03:44.169 --> 01:03:47.889
uh revolutionary groups as well. Um So, yes, I

1102
01:03:47.899 --> 01:03:50.510
mean, the, the politics of, of, of, of human

1103
01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.219
hierarchy are um you know, are, are complicated and,

1104
01:03:54.229 --> 01:03:57.139
and, you know, it takes a lot of uh

1105
01:03:57.149 --> 01:04:00.750
time and, and energy and judi judiciousness to uh

1106
01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.899
to handle it properly.

1107
01:04:02.949 --> 01:04:04.939
Yeah. And the other aspect to it that I

1108
01:04:04.949 --> 01:04:08.969
was also just about to mention and you touched

1109
01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:12.889
briefly on there is the fact that uh in

1110
01:04:12.899 --> 01:04:17.729
humans and also other species as well. Um There's

1111
01:04:17.739 --> 01:04:22.330
always the risk that other individuals might come together

1112
01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:26.570
and coordinate to depose you, right? If they are

1113
01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.399
fed up with you, basically.

1114
01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:33.030
Yes. Yes, absolutely. Um And so those uh when

1115
01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.080
that happens, um Chris Bum uh referred to that

1116
01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:39.469
as a leveling coalition, right? Um uh BECAUSE what

1117
01:04:39.479 --> 01:04:42.429
it's, it's, it's, you know, function is to reduce

1118
01:04:42.439 --> 01:04:45.679
or eliminate the discrepancy in, you know, resource access

1119
01:04:45.689 --> 01:04:47.820
and, and, and so on to the benefits of,

1120
01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:51.360
of status, right? Um And, you know, in extreme

1121
01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:53.610
cases, you know, uh I mean, Richard Wrangham wrote,

1122
01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:56.840
wrote a book recently, uh you know, uh look

1123
01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:58.370
at, looking at the extreme case of when a

1124
01:04:58.379 --> 01:05:03.449
leveling coalition goes to targeted conspiratorial killing, right? Where,

1125
01:05:03.459 --> 01:05:05.889
you know, where, where the, you know, let's say

1126
01:05:05.899 --> 01:05:10.100
the alpha male is, is so uh uh disruptive

1127
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:13.800
um and generates too few benefits. And therefore everyone

1128
01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:17.300
says, well, this guy has to go. Uh AND

1129
01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:19.219
um uh yeah, and they, they've also talked about

1130
01:05:19.229 --> 01:05:22.550
the role of um uh you know, this is

1131
01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.820
going back to Chris B and colleagues, but the

1132
01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:28.649
the role of projectile weapons too. Um Right, which,

1133
01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:30.860
you know, once, once humans had the ability to

1134
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:35.080
create projectile weapons over harmed evolution. Um Right, then

1135
01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:38.479
this vastly reduces the cost of co-ordinated killing, right?

1136
01:05:38.489 --> 01:05:41.080
Because everybody can stand back at a relatively safe

1137
01:05:41.090 --> 01:05:43.919
distance, you know. Uh AND only one, you know,

1138
01:05:43.929 --> 01:05:47.709
spear needs to actually, you know, uh land on

1139
01:05:47.719 --> 01:05:48.280
target,

1140
01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:50.639
right. Yeah. But basically you no longer have to

1141
01:05:50.649 --> 01:05:54.110
be as physically formidable as the alpha male to

1142
01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.320
actually be able to kill him even alone sometimes.

1143
01:05:57.969 --> 01:06:03.229
Yeah. Absolutely. Yes. Um Yeah, and, and, and you

1144
01:06:03.239 --> 01:06:05.780
no longer have to be the most form, physically

1145
01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:08.489
formidable individual in the community to be the alpha

1146
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.300
either, right? Because the way that you're getting there

1147
01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:14.370
is not necessarily fighting everybody else, right? You're probably

1148
01:06:14.379 --> 01:06:16.699
getting there by generating benefits for others and you

1149
01:06:16.709 --> 01:06:18.939
know, through alliances. I mean, there still is a

1150
01:06:18.949 --> 01:06:23.530
correlation in human, you know, communities between formidability and

1151
01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:26.530
uh attained rank. But it's again, nowhere near what

1152
01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.979
you would see in, in most nonhuman primates um

1153
01:06:28.989 --> 01:06:32.409
where the correlation is extremely strong. And if you

1154
01:06:32.419 --> 01:06:35.219
know, an individual is the alpha male, you, you,

1155
01:06:35.229 --> 01:06:37.570
you could probably say, and you know, with, with

1156
01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:41.280
pretty good uh uh probabilistic certainty that that will

1157
01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:45.090
be the most physically formidable individual, right? Um IN,

1158
01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:45.820
in the community.

1159
01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:50.010
Uh BY, by the way, uh just to, to

1160
01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:53.379
ask you this uh the Richard Rham book you

1161
01:06:53.389 --> 01:06:56.580
were alluding to is the goodness paradox.

1162
01:06:56.969 --> 01:06:58.729
Yes. The goodness paradox. Yes.

1163
01:06:59.469 --> 01:07:02.169
Yeah. I, I also have uh an interview about

1164
01:07:02.179 --> 01:07:04.320
that on the show, by the way. So, from

1165
01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:08.000
2019. So uh just before we go, would you

1166
01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:10.389
like to tell people where they can find you

1167
01:07:10.399 --> 01:07:12.250
when you work on the internet?

1168
01:07:15.229 --> 01:07:19.939
Um Yes. Uh I mean, Aaron lukaszewski.com, um I

1169
01:07:19.949 --> 01:07:22.689
probably shouldn't have used that, that web address because

1170
01:07:22.699 --> 01:07:24.340
you have to spell my name uh in order

1171
01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:27.409
to get it right. Um But, you know, uh

1172
01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:30.189
you know, uh I, I have a um you

1173
01:07:30.199 --> 01:07:33.100
know, both a personal and professional uh web page

1174
01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:36.120
um at Cal State Fullerton's Department of Psychology, there's

1175
01:07:36.129 --> 01:07:38.790
links to all of it. Um AND all my,

1176
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.770
you know, publications are listed there, of course with,

1177
01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.820
with uh access to PDF S. So

1178
01:07:44.659 --> 01:07:47.169
great. So I'm leaving links to that in the

1179
01:07:47.179 --> 01:07:50.699
description of the interview when Doctor Lukaszewski. Thank you

1180
01:07:50.709 --> 01:07:52.570
so much for taking the time to come on

1181
01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:54.760

with you.

1183
01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:57.040
