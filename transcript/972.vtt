00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.559
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.479
joined by Doctor Susan Golden Meadow. She is the

4
00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.460
Beardsley Rummel distinguished service professor in the Department of

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.299
Psychology and Committee on Human Development at the University

6
00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.899
of Chicago. She has made pioneering contributions to the

7
00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:23.260
study of how language is created and learned and

8
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.909
how the gestures that go along with speech, facilitate

9
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.319
learning and communication. And today, we're focusing on her

10
00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.189
book Thinking with your hands, the surprising science behind

11
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.229
our gesture shape our thought. So Doctor Golden Meadow,

12
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.430
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.650
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be

14
00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:44.909
here.

15
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.220
So, just to introduce the topic and your book

16
00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:52.740
here, what is the premise of your book? And

17
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.979
why are you interested in gestures?

18
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.990
So, I, that's a little bit of a long

19
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.900
story. I'm interested in gesture. Um Because of where

20
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.489
I began, I was interested in where language comes

21
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.940
from. Uh And whether it is there is something

22
00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:18.970
about language that we ourselves contribute to or whether

23
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.879
language is just handed down from generation to generation

24
00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:26.589
to generation. So if language disappeared. And if it's

25
00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:29.510
handed down from generation to generation to generation, it,

26
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.800
it might not return and it might not return

27
00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:36.239
in the same way. But if language disappeared and

28
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.160
we contribute to language learning, then um it might

29
00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:43.800
not only re return but return in the same

30
00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:46.319
way. So I wanted to study that question. It's

31
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.110
not an easy question to study, but I wanted

32
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.389
to study it. And so the people I looked

33
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.900
at were deaf Children of hearing parents, so they

34
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.139
couldn't acquire spoken language and they were not exposed

35
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.330
to a sign language. And I found that they

36
00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:05.110
started to use their hands to communicate. So I

37
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.038
spent many years, my first years of my career

38
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.830
studying these Children to try to figure out whether

39
00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.690
what they did with their hands could be called

40
00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:17.250
language. And from there, I got interested in how

41
00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.320
all people use their hands, whether or not they're

42
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.720
creating their language or learning their language.

43
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.970
But is it that these uh Children started using

44
00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:32.229
their hands? I mean, through their own initiative spontaneously

45
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.389
or was it through some sort of uh instruction?

46
00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.669
No, they weren't instructed at all. The instruction they

47
00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:42.979
were getting was in spoken language or their parents

48
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.589
are hearing and their parents really wanted them to

49
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.839
learn how to speak so that they were given

50
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.550
instruction in speech by their parents. Um AND by

51
00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.020
the schools that they went to oral schools, but

52
00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:56.789
in fact what they ended up communicating with was

53
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.389
their hands.

54
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.050
A and so, uh, we'll get more into that

55
00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.470
later on in our conversation. But just to take

56
00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:09.089
a small step back, what can we communicate through

57
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.889
gesture? Exactly.

58
00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.800
Well, I don't think. Ok, so gesture can be

59
00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:18.440
made into a language that's the deaf kids do.

60
00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:20.809
But for the most part, when we gesture, we're

61
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.550
using our gestures to, um, sort of shade our

62
00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.830
language. Um, WE can just add nuance to our

63
00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:31.220
language or we can add ideas that aren't conveyed

64
00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.970
in our language at all. So it, it depends,

65
00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.850
it can contribute quite a lot. Um And whether

66
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.619
or not you pay attention to it, you know,

67
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.610
it depends on the listener. Most people do pay

68
00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:43.330
attention to it.

69
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.149
But here, when we talk about gestures, there are

70
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.429
other, some other nonhuman animals that use gestures, right?

71
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.529
Are you interested in those as well or just

72
00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:57.740
in humans?

73
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.320
Well, I think that it's an interesting question as

74
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.660
to whether or not other uh nonhuman animals use

75
00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:11.869
gesture. Um They do whether they're the same, whether

76
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.419
they're used in the same way. I'm actually collaborating

77
00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:17.450
with some people who study in nonhuman primates to

78
00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.079
figure out whether these animals use gesture, whether the

79
00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:25.730
forms of their gestures look the same as hearing

80
00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:28.899
people's forms, whether the meanings look the same, mostly

81
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.470
what nonhuman primates do is use gesture to make

82
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.890
requests to ask for things, you know, to ask

83
00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:38.029
to be tickled to ask, you know, be chased

84
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.339
or whatever. Um Whereas at least the deaf Children

85
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.040
that I'm studying use gestures to just talk, you

86
00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:47.070
know, just not to talk, to communicate, to just

87
00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:50.989
convey ideas to schmooze to uh have a conversation.

88
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.619
Um And that's a little different from nonhuman primates.

89
00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:59.489
And is there also differences in terms of, uh

90
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.320
I mean, I guess that you've already ended up

91
00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:05.440
mentioning that there, but are there big differences in

92
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.119
terms of the kinds of gestures? Perhaps not really?

93
00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:13.760
Uh I'm not referring exactly to their meaning but

94
00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:16.679
to the kinds of gestures that we tend to

95
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.040
use and the gestures that other nonhuman animals use.

96
00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:24.980
Yeah, ours are much more elaborate than they just,

97
00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:27.720
I mean, you know, they don't do things like

98
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:33.950
that. Um They um I am beginning to study

99
00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:38.029
with uh Kat Hoer who studies not human primates.

100
00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:44.200
Um The forms that these uh creatures make um

101
00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:46.779
And whether they look like the forms of the

102
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.950
gestures, I mean, they have different hands, you know,

103
00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:50.640
so they're not going to be identical, they have

104
00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:54.149
different bodies, they have different. Um But we wanted

105
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.380
to see just how comparable they would be in

106
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.049
the situations in which they use these gestures. So

107
00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:00.549
we're beginning to look at that.

108
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.089
So I guess that an interesting question here to

109
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.059
ask is why do we gesture at all? And

110
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.190
by we, I mean, humans, why do we gesture

111
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.600
at all when we are ready have language. I

112
00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:20.130
mean, is it that gestures add something to language?

113
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.489
What are the functions of gestures?

114
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.769
Exactly. Well, that, that's a great question. Um, NO,

115
00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:31.359
we know that one of the things gesture does

116
00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:34.929
is it does communicate information to listeners, but it

117
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.609
does much more than that because if you're blind,

118
00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:41.570
you will gesture. If you have never ever, ever

119
00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:45.809
seen anybody gesture nonetheless, you will move your hands

120
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.640
when you talk, which feels like it's pretty robust

121
00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:51.410
and pretty res resilient and tied to language in

122
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.890
some way. So I think a gesture has a

123
00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:58.470
function both for the speaker and also for the

124
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.320
listener. Um It does lots of good things for

125
00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:03.619
the speaker. It organizes thoughts and you know, it

126
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.000
helps you attend, it helps you remember, helps you

127
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.339
uh keep things online. Um BUT it also does

128
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.359
many good things for listeners as well.

129
00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:16.549
And I guess that in the case of people

130
00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:19.809
who are blind and use gestures in that specific

131
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.500
case, it is very evident that they are at

132
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:27.450
least also using them for themselves because they cannot

133
00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:31.200
see exactly what they are conveying to other people.

134
00:07:31.429 --> 00:07:34.140
And we've even looked at deaf, blind Children or

135
00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:38.910
blind adolescents talking to other blind uh speakers and

136
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.380
they gesture. So they know they can't be for

137
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.130
their and they know they're talking to a blind

138
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.000
person so they can't be thinking, oh, well, they

139
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.100
could be looking at me. It's not, you know,

140
00:07:48.109 --> 00:07:50.959
really feels like. So when we gesture on the

141
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.529
phone, which everybody does you think? Well, ok, gestures

142
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.619
are, are um not for the listener, but sometimes

143
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.459
that's just habit, you know, you, you just do

144
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.679
it. Um WHEREAS for the blind, it feels more

145
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.480
impressive.

146
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.000
But, but so for the person who's talking or

147
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:14.260
gesturing, what kinds of cognitive effects can it have

148
00:08:14.269 --> 00:08:16.760
uh when it comes to themselves? I mean, do,

149
00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:21.269
does it have any cognitive benefits uh to gesture?

150
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.700
Sure. I mean, we found that it does um

151
00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:28.100
actually lower your cognitive load. So you can remember

152
00:08:28.109 --> 00:08:31.260
more if you gesture, um it will re uh

153
00:08:31.269 --> 00:08:35.580
help you retain the information that you have expressed

154
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.989
if you express it, not only in speech but

155
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.900
also in gesture, um it will guide your own

156
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.450
attention um if you will look in particular places.

157
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.169
So it really does have cognitive and we're, we're

158
00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:51.260
trying to look more at cognitive effects, that gesture

159
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.419
has both. Why do we do it? What are

160
00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:56.010
the cognitive skills that we need to gesture? And

161
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.179
once having gestured, what effect does it have on

162
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.020
our cognition?

163
00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:04.409
And what kinds of uh let's say additional or

164
00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:10.260
different information can other people get from our gestures?

165
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.299
Uh I mean, beyond what we say.

166
00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:17.489
So I think in the past, most and most

167
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.099
people still, I think, think about gesture as conveying

168
00:09:21.109 --> 00:09:25.190
attitude um and emotion, you know that it, it

169
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.640
just, it gives you away in the sense that

170
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.820
it, it expresses how you feel about yourself, about

171
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.729
the other, about the content. But what I've been

172
00:09:34.739 --> 00:09:38.489
focusing on is not just how you feel about

173
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.369
the conversation, but the con com its contribution to

174
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.729
the conversation itself. Um So substantive information that gets

175
00:09:45.739 --> 00:09:48.690
conveyed in gesture that might not be conveyed in

176
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.479
your speech.

177
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.419
And so, uh I mean, because we are using

178
00:09:54.429 --> 00:09:58.200
parts of our bodies, I guess that most of

179
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.409
the part of our hands but also other parts

180
00:10:00.419 --> 00:10:03.169
of our bodies. Does it connect in any way?

181
00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:06.049
Or I mean, does your work on gestures connect

182
00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:09.369
in any way to embodied cognition? Is that a

183
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.419
framework that you also bring into your work?

184
00:10:13.119 --> 00:10:15.880
So yes, I do think that the fact that

185
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.979
gestures use the body is important. I have done

186
00:10:19.989 --> 00:10:23.650
some work comparing if you gesture, you talk about

187
00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:27.299
a math problem and you gesture, pointing to the

188
00:10:27.309 --> 00:10:31.539
numbers um as opposed to moving the numbers around,

189
00:10:31.549 --> 00:10:34.260
literally taking plastic numbers and moving them around. So

190
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.630
in action, which is also embodied, what you find

191
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.510
is that the effects of gesture are different from

192
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.320
the effects of action. So both of them can

193
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.400
help you learn. But what gesture does is it

194
00:10:46.409 --> 00:10:50.820
helps you generalize that knowledge and extend it not

195
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.820
only this problem here but to other problems that

196
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.460
are like it. Um And action is much more

197
00:10:57.469 --> 00:10:59.979
limited in that sense, it ties you down and

198
00:10:59.989 --> 00:11:03.039
both are embodied. So what I'm really saying is

199
00:11:03.049 --> 00:11:06.299
that gesture, yes, is embodied and that's important, but

200
00:11:06.309 --> 00:11:07.309
it's not the whole story.

201
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.450
Mhm. So let's talk a little bit more about

202
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.919
the learning aspect here. So how do speakers use

203
00:11:15.929 --> 00:11:20.530
gestures when learning a new concept, for example?

204
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.929
Um Well, it depends, um I think what can

205
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.460
happen in a classroom is they may express their

206
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:33.469
understanding of the problem and then even slightly different

207
00:11:34.109 --> 00:11:37.489
level of understanding with their gestures. So once having

208
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.619
done that, if the teacher can pick up on

209
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.190
that, she might teach to that, he might teach

210
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.789
to that understanding, that implicit understanding and then the

211
00:11:45.799 --> 00:11:49.349
child can learn more from having gotten that input.

212
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.830
Another way to do it is just when the

213
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.010
kids gesture, I think that improves their understanding, gesturing

214
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.210
itself makes them think differently.

215
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:04.280
Uh So, and can learners also express ideas about

216
00:12:04.289 --> 00:12:07.770
concepts in their gestures that cannot be found in

217
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.729
their speech.

218
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.659
Yes, definitely. Um It could be found. It's not

219
00:12:12.669 --> 00:12:15.729
that it, they're un they're not expressible. It's just

220
00:12:15.739 --> 00:12:20.150
that that person doesn't have articulated knowledge of the

221
00:12:20.159 --> 00:12:22.799
concept. So I can give you an idea, an

222
00:12:22.809 --> 00:12:26.030
example from a study that we've done of Children

223
00:12:26.159 --> 00:12:31.320
learning about number. So, um this is a task

224
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.080
that I took from Jean Piaget. So he had,

225
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.469
he gave Children two rows of checkers, asked the

226
00:12:38.479 --> 00:12:40.580
Children if there was the same number of checkers

227
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.590
in one row and the other. They said yes,

228
00:12:42.599 --> 00:12:45.320
of course, you spread out one row of checkers.

229
00:12:46.239 --> 00:12:48.099
And then he asked the Children, is that, that

230
00:12:48.109 --> 00:12:51.539
the same number of checkers in both rows? And

231
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.619
some kids who are non conservers at a certain

232
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.400
age say no, it's a different number. Uh, SO

233
00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:59.820
that's what we've studied. We've lifted kids who say

234
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.719
no, they all say no, but some kids say

235
00:13:02.729 --> 00:13:06.099
no. And they, uh, when you ask them why

236
00:13:06.109 --> 00:13:08.440
they express the same information in their gestures and

237
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.289
their speech. So they'll say it's different because you

238
00:13:11.299 --> 00:13:14.169
move them and they'll show the moving with their

239
00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:17.969
gestures. Other kids will say it's different because you

240
00:13:17.979 --> 00:13:21.280
moved them and they'll pair up the gestures in

241
00:13:21.289 --> 00:13:25.030
the two rows with their hands. That's not how

242
00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:28.049
you moved it. In fact, it's a pretty clever

243
00:13:28.059 --> 00:13:29.919
thing to have done because what it does is

244
00:13:29.929 --> 00:13:33.030
it shows if you follow that through that there

245
00:13:33.039 --> 00:13:35.070
are the same number of checks in one row

246
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.580
and the other row. So, and it turns out

247
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.599
that the Children who produce those different gestures from

248
00:13:41.609 --> 00:13:44.219
their speech are the ones who are more likely

249
00:13:44.229 --> 00:13:47.109
to learn than the other Children. So that's a

250
00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:50.789
case where they saying something. They're talking about sort

251
00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:54.799
of how the gestures can pair up in their

252
00:13:54.809 --> 00:13:57.280
gestures in their hands. I'm sorry, how the checkers

253
00:13:57.289 --> 00:14:00.280
can pair up um in their hands, but how

254
00:14:00.289 --> 00:14:03.380
the, the checkers were moved in their mouths.

255
00:14:04.619 --> 00:14:07.780
Could you give us just to illustrate what we're

256
00:14:07.789 --> 00:14:12.239
talking about here. Another example. But now about how

257
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:18.159
Children, Children or other older students can uh learn

258
00:14:18.169 --> 00:14:22.119
through gestures in the classroom specifically.

259
00:14:22.849 --> 00:14:26.549
Well, I think what we have done in experiments

260
00:14:26.559 --> 00:14:30.409
is we've told to gesture in a particular way

261
00:14:30.419 --> 00:14:33.630
and when you do that, um they learn, then

262
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.169
they're more likely to learn than if you don't

263
00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:39.739
tell them to gesture. Uh And in those studies,

264
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.909
what we did was it gave them particular gestures

265
00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:44.450
to do. But we've also done today. So we

266
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.469
tell the kids, ok, next time you do this,

267
00:14:46.479 --> 00:14:49.760
move your hands and they do that and they're

268
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.739
more likely to learn. So even if we don't

269
00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.659
tell them exactly what gestures to make, they're still

270
00:14:55.669 --> 00:14:58.140
more likely to take advantage of the instruction that

271
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.659
they're getting.

272
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.929
Mhm.

273
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.570
So it helped

274
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.619
a and do we have any idea about what

275
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:09.130
are the specific, let's say cognitive mechanisms operating there?

276
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.390
I mean, is it that the gestures themselves play

277
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.510
a role in the learning or is it that

278
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.890
by gesturing, they are perhaps paying more attention to

279
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.510
what they're learning?

280
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.219
Well, those are not as different as I would

281
00:15:25.229 --> 00:15:27.500
as I think, you mean, I mean, I think

282
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.890
that what the gestures could do is just reflect

283
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.299
what they know and somebody else can respond back

284
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:35.900
to them. And that's one way in which they

285
00:15:35.909 --> 00:15:38.669
can play a role in learning. But the other

286
00:15:38.679 --> 00:15:41.780
way is that they could actually change the way

287
00:15:41.789 --> 00:15:44.469
the child is thinking. I think we have some

288
00:15:44.479 --> 00:15:46.989
evidence that that's true, but we still don't know

289
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.250
how it's changing the way the child or the

290
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.739
learner. I don't think this is about Children. I

291
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.090
think this is about people. So you too will

292
00:15:56.169 --> 00:15:58.900
just might help you learn so gesture it's good

293
00:15:58.909 --> 00:16:02.460
for you. Um But we don't exactly know what

294
00:16:02.469 --> 00:16:05.989
it's doing. We're trying to do some uh brain

295
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.250
analysis and studies of, of scanning the brain when

296
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.219
you're gesturing and to see if we can figure

297
00:16:11.229 --> 00:16:13.359
out exactly what gesture is doing. It may be

298
00:16:13.369 --> 00:16:15.830
helping you abstract, it may help be helping you

299
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.330
pull away from the concrete details and helping you

300
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:24.000
move, move out away from the particular and therefore

301
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.169
generalize better.

302
00:16:25.789 --> 00:16:29.780
Mhm And so on the other hand, we, we've

303
00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:32.000
been talking about learning, but on the other hand,

304
00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:36.309
can gestures we use have a detrimental effect on

305
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.770
us and others if they convey, for example, incorrect

306
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.359
information, I mean, can they hinder our learning?

307
00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:48.119
Well, it's certainly they can hinder our learning. We've

308
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.219
created studies where, you know, we we make people

309
00:16:52.229 --> 00:16:55.169
pick up gestures that don't help. They actually get

310
00:16:55.179 --> 00:16:57.729
in the way. I think what gestures are is

311
00:16:57.739 --> 00:17:01.200
powerful so that we have an example of a

312
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:07.060
teacher inadvertently pointing out um all of the numbers

313
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.420
in the problem, but he didn't really mean to

314
00:17:09.719 --> 00:17:11.939
and what the child did after that was add

315
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:13.829
up all of the numbers in the problem. He

316
00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:17.280
just got waylaid by the, the person's gestures. I

317
00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.719
think gestures are really powerful. Um And given that

318
00:17:21.729 --> 00:17:26.358
they are powerful, um they will affect you for

319
00:17:26.368 --> 00:17:28.479
good if they're moving in a good direction and

320
00:17:28.489 --> 00:17:30.399
they can affect you for bad if they're, if

321
00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:32.168
they're gonna take you in a bad direction.

322
00:17:33.859 --> 00:17:37.369
And uh I mean, earlier, I've asked you whether

323
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:43.959
gestures add additional information to what we're saying, what,

324
00:17:43.969 --> 00:17:47.890
what we're talking about. But uh then do the

325
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:54.599
nonverbal aspects of communication influence how, how observers interpret

326
00:17:54.609 --> 00:17:56.119
what someone is saying.

327
00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.750
I think they definitely do, but we don't always

328
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:05.349
realize it. In fact, when we were first studying

329
00:18:05.359 --> 00:18:09.270
these gestures, we would write down, you know what

330
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.790
the kid, what we thought the kid was saying

331
00:18:12.689 --> 00:18:15.349
uh and the and gesturing and then we decided,

332
00:18:15.359 --> 00:18:17.250
OK, maybe we should separate these and write down

333
00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.829
what the kid is saying. Look, listening only to

334
00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:21.369
speech and then write down what the kid is

335
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.050
gesturing, looking only at gestures. And when we did

336
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.469
that, that's when we discovered there was different information.

337
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.699
I think when you listen and you look, you

338
00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:35.000
integrate instantly, you just convict you put that information

339
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.420
together in your mind and you don't remember where

340
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.770
the information came from. So we're very good at

341
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.770
taking in, in gestural information and I think it's

342
00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.040
hard not to use it.

343
00:18:48.609 --> 00:18:49.880
No. Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.

344
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.880
Well, I was going to say, there's one of

345
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.199
my students, Angela Chandran is now looking at gestures

346
00:18:55.209 --> 00:18:59.260
in social evaluative situations um where she asked people

347
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:02.569
to evaluate groups that are, you know, either popular

348
00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:05.719
or not popular, competent or not competent, whatever. And

349
00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:08.439
so she found that occasionally what people will do

350
00:19:08.449 --> 00:19:11.719
is say one thing but gesture, something quite different.

351
00:19:11.729 --> 00:19:15.050
So they'll say, uh men and women are equally

352
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.689
good learners or equally good leaders, leaders, you know,

353
00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:22.180
and they'll say, well, men um are just, are

354
00:19:22.189 --> 00:19:26.209
women are just as good learners as men and

355
00:19:26.219 --> 00:19:28.819
they'll set them up where women, they'll start talking

356
00:19:28.829 --> 00:19:32.270
about uh women and place their hand low down

357
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.390
in their face. When they talk about men, they'll

358
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.750
place their, their hand up near their forehead. So

359
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.630
that by situating these two groups on this vertical

360
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.280
plane in different places, they're not talking about equality,

361
00:19:45.479 --> 00:19:48.410
not with their hands, they're talking about equality with

362
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.859
their words, but not with their hands. And that

363
00:19:51.869 --> 00:19:54.579
is gonna influence the listener. We're doing some studies

364
00:19:54.589 --> 00:19:56.739
now to see if it does influence the listener

365
00:19:57.069 --> 00:19:59.729
and it does. Uh

366
00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:04.349
uh SO, uh with that example in mind, does

367
00:20:04.359 --> 00:20:09.010
that reveal any sort of unconscious biases on the

368
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.569
part of the speaker or the gesture?

369
00:20:13.199 --> 00:20:15.410
I think it does. And I think they might

370
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.729
be very unconscious. That is, I'm not sure that

371
00:20:18.739 --> 00:20:22.180
the speaker even knows that he or she did

372
00:20:22.189 --> 00:20:25.430
that, you know, they may really think I believe

373
00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:29.229
in the equality of leadership in males and females.

374
00:20:29.239 --> 00:20:32.050
But by putting your gestures in that way, you

375
00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.010
don't totally believe it. But I'm not sure that

376
00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.910
they're, um, trying to hide it. I think they

377
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.630
don't know it.

378
00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.780
So it might not be done intentionally.

379
00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:46.920
I don't think any of these OK, there are

380
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.569
gestures that are done intentionally if I put my

381
00:20:49.579 --> 00:20:51.420
thumb up and I say it's great or if

382
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.459
I do an OK thing, those are intentional gestures.

383
00:20:54.729 --> 00:20:57.910
All these other ones are not, we just move

384
00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.910
our hands. And I don't think that we really

385
00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.130
think hard about how we're gesturing. Um And it

386
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.569
may be important that we don't think hard about

387
00:21:08.579 --> 00:21:11.510
our gesturing, that it just comes out and that

388
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.699
it's its naturalness and implicitness that is part of

389
00:21:14.709 --> 00:21:16.180
why it's powerful

390
00:21:17.459 --> 00:21:23.489
but can people use their gestures to influence others

391
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.150
and how they interpret what they're saying?

392
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.209
You mean do it explicitly and intentionally? Uh Yes,

393
00:21:31.079 --> 00:21:34.050
I'm sure you can absolutely, you know, I mean,

394
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.540
politicians try to, they're very bad at it because

395
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.640
they're not very good at gesturing. You'd have to

396
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:45.579
be a skilled gesture, I think to use your

397
00:21:45.589 --> 00:21:51.160
gestures. OK. Here's an example. Um uh Amanda Gorman

398
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:59.250
who gave that wonderful speech at Biden's inauguration. Um

399
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.339
She used her hands beautifully and she used them,

400
00:22:03.349 --> 00:22:05.810
she was, she was very intentional, I think about

401
00:22:05.819 --> 00:22:08.550
her gestures because they were used almost as a

402
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.359
choreography. They were just choreographed movements that went along

403
00:22:12.369 --> 00:22:15.359
with her, her uh words. But I think she

404
00:22:15.369 --> 00:22:17.689
thought about them before. I don't know that, but

405
00:22:17.699 --> 00:22:20.479
I think she thought about them beforehand and actually

406
00:22:20.489 --> 00:22:24.250
use them to further elaborate and bring to mind

407
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.310
images, storytellers do that too. When they tell stories,

408
00:22:28.319 --> 00:22:31.199
they use their gestures to sort of make it

409
00:22:31.209 --> 00:22:34.310
more alive and to convey nuances that they don't

410
00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:36.619
convey with their hands. That was the

411
00:22:37.969 --> 00:22:40.069
Yeah, I, I was asking you that because I

412
00:22:40.079 --> 00:22:45.430
was just thinking that if uh gestures can influence

413
00:22:45.439 --> 00:22:49.229
how other people interpret what we are saying and

414
00:22:49.239 --> 00:22:52.619
the kinds of information they get from w what

415
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:57.349
we are communicating. Perhaps if someone was aware of

416
00:22:57.359 --> 00:23:01.790
that and they wanted to actually manipulate people, perhaps

417
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.400
they could add that to what, what they're communicating

418
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:05.989
verbally.

419
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.859
Yeah, they could, you know, I think, uh but

420
00:23:08.869 --> 00:23:11.880
what I'm saying back is that you'd have to

421
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.469
be skilled to do it. OK? Because it's not

422
00:23:15.479 --> 00:23:18.699
trivial to me. I mean, I do think that's

423
00:23:18.709 --> 00:23:20.770
what politicians try to do but they're not good

424
00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.859
at it. And most of them look sort of

425
00:23:22.869 --> 00:23:25.300
silly. Um And you can see what, when their

426
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.719
gestures don't match their speech and when they're trying

427
00:23:27.729 --> 00:23:29.280
to, you know, it just doesn't look so great.

428
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.540
So I think you could um you know, influence

429
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.979
people by gesturing in a particular way, but to

430
00:23:36.989 --> 00:23:39.589
make it look natural so that people wouldn't necessarily

431
00:23:39.599 --> 00:23:41.560
pick up on it, you'd have to be good.

432
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.939
Right. So, yeah, so le let's get back to,

433
00:23:46.949 --> 00:23:50.969
uh, deaf Children and, and how they use home

434
00:23:50.979 --> 00:23:54.000
sign. So, uh, first of all, how do you

435
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.420
study home sign? How do you go about it?

436
00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:02.689
And is it something that Children who they just

437
00:24:02.699 --> 00:24:06.140
invent themselves or how does it work? Exactly.

438
00:24:06.359 --> 00:24:08.699
So, the way we have studied it is, um,

439
00:24:08.709 --> 00:24:12.224
just by going into children's home when they're little.

440
00:24:13.334 --> 00:24:15.954
Um AND you know, asking the parents if we

441
00:24:15.964 --> 00:24:17.824
can videotape the kid and just put down a

442
00:24:17.834 --> 00:24:19.944
bunch of toys and let the kid play with

443
00:24:19.954 --> 00:24:21.494
the parent or with one of us and we

444
00:24:21.505 --> 00:24:24.594
videotaped the child and you know, the kid does

445
00:24:24.604 --> 00:24:26.275
what every kid does sort of play with the

446
00:24:26.285 --> 00:24:29.064
toys and talk about their gesture about the toys.

447
00:24:29.074 --> 00:24:31.694
So in this case, now whether every single deaf

448
00:24:31.704 --> 00:24:33.944
child will do that, I don't know, I don't

449
00:24:33.954 --> 00:24:36.785
think it matters at some level, the fact that

450
00:24:36.805 --> 00:24:41.500
any deaf child can do that given very little.

451
00:24:41.579 --> 00:24:44.949
It, it no sign language input is, is sort

452
00:24:44.959 --> 00:24:47.380
of the point that I wanted to make. Uh

453
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:51.930
IT is doable. It's possible we can as Children

454
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.979
uh construct at least the fundamental aspects of language,

455
00:24:56.199 --> 00:24:59.339
even if we haven't experienced it.

456
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:04.260
Mhm A and, but these home signs that uh

457
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.319
deaf Children or some deaf Children use, do they

458
00:25:08.329 --> 00:25:13.040
have similarities to language in terms of, for example,

459
00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:18.439
the semantics and the structure of the language or

460
00:25:18.729 --> 00:25:18.810
not.

461
00:25:18.819 --> 00:25:21.489
Right. So I think in both ways when they're

462
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.680
little kids, they gesture about the same things that

463
00:25:24.959 --> 00:25:28.040
hearing kids talk about when they're learning spoken language

464
00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.280
and deaf kids sign about when they're learning sign

465
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.645
language. So, you know, it's what they're about. So

466
00:25:32.655 --> 00:25:36.084
they, they, that's the content of their com communications,

467
00:25:36.094 --> 00:25:38.525
but they also have very simple structural rules as

468
00:25:38.535 --> 00:25:42.005
well. So their uh gestures are in a particular

469
00:25:42.015 --> 00:25:44.135
order. If they want to talk about an object

470
00:25:44.145 --> 00:25:47.204
that's being acted upon, they'll point or indicate that

471
00:25:47.214 --> 00:25:50.045
object before they do the gesture for the action.

472
00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:52.239
Um If they want to say that something is

473
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.339
being moved to a place, they'll do the action

474
00:25:55.349 --> 00:25:58.260
for the moving and then they'll indicate the place.

475
00:25:58.439 --> 00:26:00.770
Um And that tends to be true in all

476
00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.520
of the Children we've looked at and in Children

477
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.560
in different cultures. So we've looked at kids in

478
00:26:05.569 --> 00:26:07.900
America and we've looked at kids in Turkey and

479
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:11.170
we've looked at kids in China. Um AND they

480
00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.209
all use the same structures, which is interesting. Yeah.

481
00:26:15.219 --> 00:26:19.969
A a and so the syntactic structure there is

482
00:26:19.979 --> 00:26:25.079
object and then verb instead of verb plus object,

483
00:26:25.089 --> 00:26:25.469
right?

484
00:26:26.239 --> 00:26:26.569
Yeah.

485
00:26:26.609 --> 00:26:29.599
A a as we actually find in some spoken

486
00:26:29.609 --> 00:26:33.290
languages like Japanese, I guess the, the object comes

487
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.359
before the, the verb and

488
00:26:35.369 --> 00:26:38.530
as in Turkish, Turkish is one but the Turkish

489
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.290
kids are no better at it than uh West

490
00:26:42.329 --> 00:26:44.319
kids. It's in OK. So here's here's a AAA

491
00:26:44.329 --> 00:26:48.050
fact that you might know if we tell people,

492
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.579
adult people who use Turkish and Chinese and Spanish

493
00:26:51.589 --> 00:26:55.949
and English to um just be quiet and create

494
00:26:55.959 --> 00:27:02.900
gestures. OK? They will invent gestures, strings that have

495
00:27:03.119 --> 00:27:06.339
the object in front of the verb, even if

496
00:27:06.349 --> 00:27:10.219
they're English speakers, even if they're Spanish speakers. So

497
00:27:10.229 --> 00:27:12.140
when you ask them to describe it in English,

498
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.290
they'll put the verb in front of the object.

499
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.119
Of course, because that we say I eat the

500
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.660
apple or I beat the drum. But when they

501
00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.239
describe it in gestures, they'll indicate the drum first

502
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:24.989
and then do beating will indicate the apple first

503
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.670
and then do eating and all of the groups

504
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.239
are the same.

505
00:27:30.109 --> 00:27:35.359
So do you think that studying gestures can also

506
00:27:35.369 --> 00:27:40.709
tell us something about the, how language works? I

507
00:27:40.719 --> 00:27:45.069
mean, spoke, how spoken language works and perhaps the

508
00:27:45.079 --> 00:27:52.089
how the cognitive apparatus behind language uh processes information.

509
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.130
So OK, that's a question that I'm, I have

510
00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:03.000
studied less, I'm much more interested in the developmental

511
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:07.489
processes that create language than in the processes that

512
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.270
we use when we produce or receive language. What

513
00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.089
I do think is interesting about the deaf Children,

514
00:28:15.099 --> 00:28:18.189
the home signers is that they really don't have

515
00:28:18.199 --> 00:28:22.140
an experience of receiving the language that is comprehended

516
00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:25.750
because they don't see it. So they are in

517
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.099
a way a production machine, you know, they're expressing

518
00:28:29.109 --> 00:28:34.310
their thoughts, but they don't comprehend those same ideas

519
00:28:34.319 --> 00:28:38.920
from somebody else's language. Um, SO I think they

520
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:44.359
can bear on questions of production and comprehension, um,

521
00:28:44.369 --> 00:28:47.920
because of that fact, but I haven't really studied

522
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.160
and don't know so much about processing of these

523
00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:54.599
things. Although, you know, comparison comparing has sign languages

524
00:28:54.609 --> 00:28:58.290
are processed compared to spoken languages can do that

525
00:28:58.329 --> 00:28:59.280
can be very helpful.

526
00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:03.750
Mhm. And, uh, do we know if the gestures

527
00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.250
that deaf Children use are in any way similar

528
00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.270
to the ones used by hearing Children?

529
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.579
Um I've looked at that at the very, very

530
00:29:14.589 --> 00:29:18.920
beginning. Um, HEARING Children also use their gestures very

531
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:23.040
explicitly. They pointed objects. They create some iconic gestures.

532
00:29:23.069 --> 00:29:28.130
They rarely put two gestures together, hearing Children. Um

533
00:29:28.199 --> 00:29:30.589
But the deaf Children do all the time. So

534
00:29:30.599 --> 00:29:33.069
the deaf Children go much farther with their gestures

535
00:29:33.079 --> 00:29:34.849
than hearing kids. Kids do.

536
00:29:36.829 --> 00:29:41.650
Uh But what do these home signs really look

537
00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:45.469
like? I mean, are they similar to mimicry? Do

538
00:29:45.479 --> 00:29:50.849
they replicate actual movements of an event or something

539
00:29:50.859 --> 00:29:51.359
else?

540
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.780
Yeah, they're not mimicry. Uh Much to my surprise.

541
00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.160
Um I mean, they're not a total mind. They're

542
00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:00.589
not, they don't look like Marcel Marceau who's a

543
00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:04.199
wonderful mind. Um You know, it's a to represent

544
00:30:04.209 --> 00:30:06.290
eating an apple, they wouldn't sort of go into

545
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.540
a whole event of picking up the apple and

546
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.400
shining it on their, their shirt and then eating

547
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.699
it. They want to talk about eating an apple,

548
00:30:13.709 --> 00:30:15.680
they'll point at the apple and then do a

549
00:30:15.689 --> 00:30:18.719
little jab toward their mouth. So they break up

550
00:30:18.729 --> 00:30:23.030
these events into small pieces and once having broken

551
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.469
up the events into small pieces, then you gotta

552
00:30:25.479 --> 00:30:27.939
put it back together again. And that's where the

553
00:30:27.949 --> 00:30:28.939
structure comes in.

554
00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.750
And in terms of the functions, because earlier in

555
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.709
our conversation, I asked you about the functions of

556
00:30:36.719 --> 00:30:42.780
gestures more generally. Uh WHAT functions do home sign

557
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:43.790
serve?

558
00:30:44.849 --> 00:30:48.750
Well, home signs serve the function of, of language.

559
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.390
I mean, these kids have no other way of

560
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.619
communicating other than body language and, you know, picking

561
00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:59.969
up acting. Um So this, they, these gestures actually

562
00:30:59.979 --> 00:31:02.540
serve the functions of language. And in fact, for,

563
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.859
for any of the kids, it really serves all

564
00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:08.199
of the functions of language so that um they'll

565
00:31:08.209 --> 00:31:10.650
use it to talk to themselves. So they'll produce

566
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.640
gestures that are conveyed not for you just for

567
00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:16.680
me, the the kid, or they'll use gestures to

568
00:31:16.689 --> 00:31:18.589
point at their other gestures in sort of a

569
00:31:18.599 --> 00:31:21.839
metal linguistic way. You know, kid makes a face

570
00:31:21.849 --> 00:31:24.000
of Donald Duck and my, I'm not watching it.

571
00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.099
So he points at his face to indicate. I

572
00:31:27.109 --> 00:31:29.780
said Donald Duck, you know, by pointing at his

573
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:34.729
own gestures. Um THOSE are pretty sophisticated functions. Um

574
00:31:34.739 --> 00:31:37.770
THEY tell stories with their gestures. Um You know,

575
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.829
they string lots of gestures together and make a

576
00:31:39.839 --> 00:31:43.119
story. Um So there's lots that they, you know,

577
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:45.969
they comment, they request um they use them for

578
00:31:45.979 --> 00:31:48.400
generics. There's all kinds of ways in which these

579
00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:51.089
gestures fulfill the functions of language.

580
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.579
Uh So in hearing people when many times, for

581
00:31:55.589 --> 00:32:00.069
example, we have internal speech or when we think

582
00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:04.949
out loud to ourselves, uh do home signers or

583
00:32:04.959 --> 00:32:09.130
deaf Children use gestures or their home signs the

584
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:09.869
same way.

585
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.479
Yeah, I think that's what um, the kids are

586
00:32:13.489 --> 00:32:15.489
doing when they're talking to themselves. So I have

587
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.180
an instance when that child is trying to create

588
00:32:19.189 --> 00:32:22.780
a block tower. Um AND there's a little sheet

589
00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:24.739
that tells you which blocks to put on the

590
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.069
tower. And so he looks at it and does

591
00:32:27.079 --> 00:32:30.949
an arc gesture with his hand. So I help

592
00:32:31.069 --> 00:32:33.819
went and got a, an arc gesture, an arc

593
00:32:33.829 --> 00:32:37.560
block and he just ignored me. That gesture wasn't

594
00:32:37.569 --> 00:32:40.349
for me, it was really for him to go

595
00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:45.150
and find an arc walk. Um So it was

596
00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.780
in that case, not intended to communicate to anybody

597
00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:49.979
other than himself.

598
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:55.540
Mhm. But if home signs serve uh the same

599
00:32:55.550 --> 00:33:00.939
functions as language are home signers ever able to

600
00:33:00.949 --> 00:33:04.569
entirely recreate language or not

601
00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:08.040
or not as I mean, who, who knows? Really?

602
00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:10.910
Uh I doubt it. I think that what home

603
00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:15.339
sign invents home sign includes many of the really

604
00:33:15.349 --> 00:33:20.060
basic aspects of language simple. Um But we have

605
00:33:20.069 --> 00:33:24.660
been able to explore the um the changes that

606
00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:28.500
home sign undergoes when you bring home signers together

607
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:31.709
into a single place that happened in Nicaragua 40

608
00:33:31.719 --> 00:33:34.709
years ago, years ago, they were brought, deaf people

609
00:33:34.719 --> 00:33:36.959
were brought together for the first time. And what

610
00:33:36.969 --> 00:33:40.829
happened is that they all, then they could see

611
00:33:40.839 --> 00:33:43.890
each other's gestures and produce each other's gestures and

612
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.910
language started to form Nicaraguan sign language. Um And

613
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.609
as new people enter that community, that language is

614
00:33:51.619 --> 00:33:54.890
learned by others and is changed and is changed

615
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.930
and it, and it's still changing. Um You know,

616
00:33:57.939 --> 00:34:00.689
so that's when we're gonna get a full blown

617
00:34:00.699 --> 00:34:05.369
sign language, that's how all sign languages evolve actually

618
00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.208
over time. So I don't think home signers can

619
00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:10.199
invent all the properties of language. And I think

620
00:34:10.208 --> 00:34:13.989
it's very interesting to try to distinguish which properties

621
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.310
they can invent and which properties require this transmission

622
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.250
and other other aspects of the world to be

623
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:21.958
developed.

624
00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:27.179
So, uh another thing that you also talk about

625
00:34:27.188 --> 00:34:31.429
in your book is uh can knowing how the

626
00:34:31.438 --> 00:34:35.550
hands communicate, help us better understand people.

627
00:34:37.899 --> 00:34:40.929
Well, I think it can help us understand what

628
00:34:40.938 --> 00:34:44.800
people are thinking. Um And that's pretty good, you

629
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.889
know, I think there are examples, you know, if

630
00:34:47.899 --> 00:34:51.870
you're a clinician probably, or therapist, probably what you're

631
00:34:51.879 --> 00:34:54.149
doing is making use of what people do with

632
00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:57.639
their hands to make inferences about what they're thinking.

633
00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.310
You may be doing it consciously or you may

634
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.850
be doing it unconsciously. But if you're a good

635
00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.439
therapist, I think you're using those kinds of um

636
00:35:06.729 --> 00:35:11.229
thoughts that are displayed in the air. Um So

637
00:35:11.239 --> 00:35:13.540
in that sense, we can understand people better

638
00:35:14.919 --> 00:35:18.500
and can it connect to parenting in any way?

639
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:22.139
I mean, can gestures have some sort of uh,

640
00:35:22.149 --> 00:35:25.899
I don't know, influence in parenting in and our

641
00:35:25.909 --> 00:35:27.639
parenting practices.

642
00:35:27.949 --> 00:35:29.709
Right. Well, I think that it can, in many

643
00:35:29.719 --> 00:35:32.229
ways, uh one way is in how you respond

644
00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:35.070
to your kid. So for example, if the kid

645
00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:39.419
points at a uh a cup and says mommy,

646
00:35:40.189 --> 00:35:43.399
the obviously doesn't think the mommy is, the cup

647
00:35:43.409 --> 00:35:45.979
is a mommy. I mean that, but probably what

648
00:35:45.989 --> 00:35:49.030
the kid is saying is that's mommy's cup. And

649
00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.489
so if you as an adult say to the

650
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:55.399
child afterwards, oh yeah, that's mommy's cup. What you're

651
00:35:55.409 --> 00:35:59.000
doing is translating what the child produced ingestion speech

652
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:02.540
into speech and you're giving the child an opportunity

653
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.189
a really golden moment in which to learn how

654
00:36:05.199 --> 00:36:07.969
to say that. So that if you attend to

655
00:36:07.979 --> 00:36:11.629
your child's gestures and sort of respond to them

656
00:36:11.639 --> 00:36:15.550
as most parents, I think, do that may improve

657
00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.899
their um learning and they may learn that faster

658
00:36:18.909 --> 00:36:21.469
than they would have without the parent responding in

659
00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:21.949
that way?

660
00:36:23.169 --> 00:36:26.000
And so do you think that and also going

661
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.439
back to something that we talked a little bit

662
00:36:28.449 --> 00:36:31.270
about earlier, do you think that your work can

663
00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:35.439
also apply to education? And if so in what

664
00:36:35.449 --> 00:36:35.949
ways?

665
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.370
So I think it i in all of these

666
00:36:39.379 --> 00:36:41.739
ways it's sort of the same and I think

667
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.439
it definitely can and should be applied to education

668
00:36:44.729 --> 00:36:49.320
when Children or when learners are asked to explain

669
00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:54.699
what they know they gesture. Um And those gestures

670
00:36:54.709 --> 00:36:58.169
may reflect ideas that are not coming out of

671
00:36:58.179 --> 00:37:00.750
their mouths. So a good teacher will look at

672
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.219
that and say, oh, ok, I, I maybe not

673
00:37:04.229 --> 00:37:08.459
consciously but they'll realize that the child understands that.

674
00:37:08.919 --> 00:37:10.820
So one of the things you can do is

675
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.620
ask your kids to gesture, you know, sort of

676
00:37:13.629 --> 00:37:16.020
say when you explain that problem at the board,

677
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.820
I want you to gesture while you're doing it

678
00:37:18.919 --> 00:37:21.639
because that may reveal more. You can use it

679
00:37:21.649 --> 00:37:24.879
for diagnosis in another, in another, in a sense,

680
00:37:24.889 --> 00:37:26.939
you know, use it to, to figure out what

681
00:37:26.949 --> 00:37:30.790
the child knows, right. So, and in addition, it

682
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.449
can be used, um the teacher can gesture and

683
00:37:34.459 --> 00:37:37.810
teach the child things through his hands. So there's

684
00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:41.239
both give and take both the the children's gestures.

685
00:37:41.469 --> 00:37:44.520
Um YOU can encourage them to gesture. Um AND

686
00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.389
you can watch your own gestures and make sure

687
00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:49.209
you don't mislead them with your gestures.

688
00:37:50.239 --> 00:37:52.260
And do you think? And I guess this is

689
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:55.219
also important in the context of education. Do you

690
00:37:55.229 --> 00:37:58.290
think that by studying gestures and having a better

691
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:02.729
understanding of how Children use them and how they

692
00:38:02.739 --> 00:38:08.020
develop over time that we can better identify Children

693
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.919
who have diverged in their development in terms of

694
00:38:11.929 --> 00:38:17.219
communication and perhaps uh potentially helping, helping them get

695
00:38:17.229 --> 00:38:19.300
back on course. So to say,

696
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.879
well, we do have some um I think uh

697
00:38:22.889 --> 00:38:27.550
important analysis of kids, kids who are brain injured.

698
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:32.879
Ok. So they're, they're brain injured. Um They're all

699
00:38:32.889 --> 00:38:35.050
at the very bottom of the heap in terms

700
00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:38.290
of when their ability to produce words at 18

701
00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.870
months. But in fact, the two groups differ very

702
00:38:41.879 --> 00:38:44.500
much. Uh uh SORRY, they differ in how much

703
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:47.389
gesture they produce. So half of them are also

704
00:38:47.399 --> 00:38:49.020
at the bottom of the heap with respect to

705
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:53.739
gesture. And some are at the, you know, they're

706
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.520
just like regular kids with respect to their gestures.

707
00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:59.189
OK. Then we fast forward, you know, a year

708
00:38:59.199 --> 00:39:02.100
or two and we look at their word learning

709
00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:04.820
at that point and the kids who were at

710
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:06.879
the bottom of the heap, remember they were all

711
00:39:06.889 --> 00:39:08.929
at the bottom for word learning to begin with.

712
00:39:08.939 --> 00:39:11.860
But the ones who didn't gesture stayed at the

713
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:15.429
bottom and the ones who did gesture improved. And

714
00:39:15.439 --> 00:39:18.209
so their, their word learning then uh went into

715
00:39:18.219 --> 00:39:21.110
the normal range. So that's a case where we

716
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.649
can use gesture to diagnose who might need intervention.

717
00:39:25.989 --> 00:39:28.399
It's those kids who are not gesturing and not

718
00:39:28.409 --> 00:39:31.860
speaking or speaking very little who really could use

719
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:36.169
more intervention than the kids who are uh gesturing

720
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:37.250
and not speaking.

721
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:42.770
Mhm And so uh in still in regards to

722
00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.459
education and this will probably be my last question

723
00:39:46.469 --> 00:39:51.360
today. Um Can that also apply to students from

724
00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:55.709
less privileged backgrounds? I mean, can we also see

725
00:39:55.719 --> 00:40:01.360
those divergences between uh pre uh uh students who

726
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:06.360
come from less privileged backgrounds in comparison to the

727
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:10.169
other students who come from more privileged backgrounds?

728
00:40:10.649 --> 00:40:12.780
Well, I have one of my former students be

729
00:40:12.879 --> 00:40:16.610
Brey Church has done studies of kids who are

730
00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:22.949
um come from uh lower ses families, you know,

731
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.300
low income families and she has found the gesture

732
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:30.429
is actually even more important for them. So if

733
00:40:30.439 --> 00:40:33.429
you give them gestures in their input in their

734
00:40:33.439 --> 00:40:37.810
instruction, as opposed to, um, you know, kids who

735
00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:41.350
come from higher income families, you can wipe out

736
00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.820
the differences or at least get closer to low

737
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:47.659
le level leveling the playing field if you include

738
00:40:47.669 --> 00:40:51.010
gesture. So without gesture, they look really different. But

739
00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:54.300
with gesture, you begin to equate. So it may

740
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:58.790
be even more important for kids from lower income

741
00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.719
families. And the problem of course is with online

742
00:41:01.729 --> 00:41:05.260
instruction is that gesture isn't always included in it.

743
00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.129
And if it's particularly important for kids who, um,

744
00:41:09.139 --> 00:41:13.560
are not there yet, um, that they're getting sort

745
00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:15.439
of a double whammy by not being able to

746
00:41:15.449 --> 00:41:18.100
see the gestures that the teacher produces.

747
00:41:18.639 --> 00:41:22.899
So that's potentially another way by which during the

748
00:41:22.909 --> 00:41:28.379
pandemic, by having online classes, uh, children's learning might

749
00:41:28.389 --> 00:41:30.899
have been impacted maybe,

750
00:41:30.909 --> 00:41:32.850
I mean, I don't think it's the biggest reason.

751
00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.659
There are plenty of reason. Yeah. Yeah.

752
00:41:34.669 --> 00:41:35.570
Yeah. No, sure.

753
00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.669
But I think it may have contributed in some

754
00:41:37.679 --> 00:41:40.800
ways. I mean, um, you know, the, the fact

755
00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:43.969
that information is being conveyed by hands and the

756
00:41:43.979 --> 00:41:45.969
kids aren't seeing it, but it works in both

757
00:41:45.979 --> 00:41:47.850
ways, you know, when the teacher is sitting in

758
00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.209
her little box and the kid is in his

759
00:41:50.219 --> 00:41:52.850
little box and the teacher can't see the kids

760
00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.040
hands. She's not getting insight into what the kid

761
00:41:56.050 --> 00:42:00.300
is saying. And then conversely, if the kid isn't

762
00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.770
able to see the teacher's gestures, they're not getting

763
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.689
that, that input from the teacher. So,

764
00:42:06.239 --> 00:42:08.780
yeah, so uh just one more question then uh

765
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:12.129
because I was almost forgetting about asking you this

766
00:42:12.139 --> 00:42:18.360
specifically. So, uh and what about neurodivergent Children like

767
00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:22.040
uh autistic Children? Do we see differences in terms

768
00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:26.899
of how they use gestures and how the other

769
00:42:26.909 --> 00:42:32.620
um I mean, more uh regular Children use gestures?

770
00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.919
Yeah. So um I haven't studied this myself but

771
00:42:35.929 --> 00:42:37.790
I have a student, Jen, a former student, Jan

772
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.590
Iverson who has studied autistic kids and Down syndrome.

773
00:42:42.389 --> 00:42:45.389
Um And other people have studied Williams syndrome kids.

774
00:42:45.399 --> 00:42:50.219
Um AND autistic kids are said to gesture less

775
00:42:50.479 --> 00:42:56.270
than um typically developing Children. Um They certainly produce

776
00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.919
fewer of the kinds of gestures that we recognize

777
00:42:58.929 --> 00:43:00.969
as gestures. They may because they do a lot

778
00:43:00.979 --> 00:43:03.689
of non verbal touching and whatever. Maybe some of

779
00:43:03.699 --> 00:43:06.409
those really are gestures and require somebody to really

780
00:43:06.419 --> 00:43:09.030
look hard at them. People have also looked at

781
00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.169
how parents use gestures in relation to these kids.

782
00:43:13.229 --> 00:43:16.540
Um And the parents gestures are pretty comparable across

783
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.959
kids. So it's not like the parents are, but

784
00:43:18.969 --> 00:43:22.159
sometimes, you know, the parents are um changing their

785
00:43:22.169 --> 00:43:24.770
gestures in ways that might not be so helpful.

786
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.729
So I think that kind of work is really

787
00:43:26.739 --> 00:43:28.199
very useful to do.

788
00:43:30.139 --> 00:43:33.780
Great. So Doctor Golden Meadow, I think that this

789
00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:36.100
is a good point for us to wrap up

790
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:38.949
the interview. And the book is again thinking with

791
00:43:38.959 --> 00:43:43.280
your hands, the surprising science behind our gesture, shape

792
00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.530
our thoughts. And I'm leaving a link to it

793
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:48.550
in the description of the interview. And uh just

794
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.060
before we go apart from the book, would you

795
00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:53.679
like to tell people where they can find you

796
00:43:53.689 --> 00:43:55.439
and your work on the internet

797
00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.969
um on my website, but I don't remember its

798
00:44:00.979 --> 00:44:05.449
name and you can put it on.

799
00:44:06.229 --> 00:44:08.860
No look, no problem at all. I will look

800
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:11.060
it up and then look it in the description.

801
00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.540
You know, I'm one of those. I don't know

802
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:16.330
what technology but they can find me, University of

803
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.939
Chicago. That's where I am.

804
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:22.020
OK? Great. So thank you so much again for
