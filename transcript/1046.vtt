00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.639
Center. I'm your host as always, Ricardo Lopes and

3
00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.520
today I'm joined by Doctor Olivia Riley. She's a

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.840
postdoctoral fellow in the ACT lab at Harvard University.

5
00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.479
She studies social cognition in non-human primates. And she

6
00:00:17.479 --> 00:00:20.719
uses a comparative approach to investigate the neural and

7
00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:25.559
hormonal correlates of social cognition and behavior. And today

8
00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.200
we're focusing on social cognition and primates, and we're

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.399
going to talk a little bit about things like

10
00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.840
oxytocin, sex differences in the brain of capuchin monkeys

11
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.639
and comparing them to humans and some other related

12
00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.919
topics. So, Doctor Riley, welcome to the show. It's

13
00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:43.110
a pleasure to everyone.

14
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.479
Thank you so much and thank you for having

15
00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.840
me.

16
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.819
So, uh, to start off with, tell us a

17
00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.860
little bit about how you got interested, how and

18
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.740
why you got interested in studying social cognition and

19
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.069
primates. I mean, why primates specifically, is there something

20
00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:05.419
special about them or is this just a personal

21
00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:06.250
interest of yours?

22
00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:09.559
I guess the best answer for me would be

23
00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:13.959
both, um, primates have always been especially interesting to

24
00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:16.239
me, um, but also one of the reasons I

25
00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:19.760
think that primates, nonhuman primates are particularly important to

26
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.680
study um social cognitive questions is because, um, primates

27
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.559
are, you know, Closely related to humans on a

28
00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:31.440
phylogenetic scale, and so we can learn a lot

29
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.919
about humans by studying non-human primates, um, especially what

30
00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:39.260
it really is that separates humans from other primates,

31
00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:41.879
um, because we're primates too, and so, and we

32
00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:45.589
know that humans are, are. Very different, but the

33
00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:47.559
more you learn about other nonhuman primates, the more

34
00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:50.430
you realize that there are actually quite a lot

35
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.580
of similarities between humans and other primates as well.

36
00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:56.230
Um, SO that was, yeah, I would say that

37
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.709
my best answer is it was a little bit

38
00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:59.870
of both. It was personal interest, but also they're

39
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.980
a great model for answering that sort of question.

40
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.110
And what are the aspects of social cognition in

41
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.270
primates that you are most interested in and you

42
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.100
explore the most in your work?

43
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.970
Yeah, that's a great question because there are a

44
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.289
lot of different directions that people have gone studying

45
00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:20.750
social cognition in general. Um, SO for me, I

46
00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.779
I thought that it was interesting to study these

47
00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:27.860
social questions because there are certain cognitive skills or

48
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.699
abilities that help a social animal to sort of

49
00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:36.460
navigate its social environment, um, and a lot of

50
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.860
primates live in complex social environments, particularly humans, um.

51
00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.750
So there are certain skills that I think can

52
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.979
help aid the primate in this sort of social

53
00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:52.350
experience, um, so some examples of that sort of

54
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.740
question. That people have studied would be like looking

55
00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.660
into how other primate species might be able to

56
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.860
recognize other individuals' faces, so they're conspecifics, their group

57
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.460
members, for instance, um, or how maybe they can

58
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.679
differentiate different facial expressions that are directed towards them

59
00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:18.190
um in a group setting, or maybe they're capable

60
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.429
of following another individuals gaze, um. To gain information

61
00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:24.660
about what that individual may be looking at or

62
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.660
um yeah, I don't know, different ideas like that,

63
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.699
but for me, uh, most recently I investigated attention,

64
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.630
so looking at um attention biases toward socially threatening

65
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.630
facial expressions. So, um, in, in my experience, I

66
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.029
was working primarily with capuchin monkeys, um, and Capuchin

67
00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.964
monkeys are a neotropical primate. About the size of

68
00:03:48.964 --> 00:03:52.104
a house cat, um, so not too big, but

69
00:03:52.104 --> 00:03:55.054
they're very cute, but they are also wild animals,

70
00:03:55.164 --> 00:03:58.404
so they're definitely not pets, um, but they, I

71
00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:02.005
was interested in knowing whether they show an attentional

72
00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:07.235
bias toward faces that have a threatening expression, so

73
00:04:07.485 --> 00:04:10.654
a photo of an uh capuchin face that might

74
00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.380
If they were just interacting with their group mates,

75
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.029
um, and one of their groupmates, you know, threatened

76
00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.920
them or got angry at them, um, would they

77
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.910
pay more attention to a face like that that

78
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.429
was potentially threatening compared to a face that was

79
00:04:25.429 --> 00:04:30.910
neutral, um, posed no threat in theory, um, and

80
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.589
I was interested in that because in humans we

81
00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:37.489
know that We tend to show these biases toward

82
00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:42.299
um negativity, so whether that's um a negative social

83
00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:46.429
expression on another human being's face or, um, you

84
00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:50.670
know, a threatening object, for instance, um. Maybe a

85
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.750
picture of a snake versus a flower. We're a

86
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.459
lot quicker to focus our attention on that negative

87
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.829
item, and so I was curious whether capuchins also

88
00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:03.829
show that kind of bias because if you think

89
00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:08.500
about it, there is actually some evolutionary benefit to

90
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.790
being able to pay rapid attention to something that's

91
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.899
potentially posing as a threat because it allows you

92
00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:21.709
to react appropriately, um. But, uh, surprisingly, we didn't

93
00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:25.070
actually find that capuchins show a robust attentional bias

94
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.040
toward threatening faces in the way that we sometimes

95
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.000
see in other species. So, um, yeah, but that

96
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.600
was one of my most recent examples of uh

97
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.959
cognitive tasks that involves some social stimuli.

98
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.709
So sticking with capuchin monkeys, then I know that

99
00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:45.260
one of the things that you've studied has to

100
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.029
do with their affiliated behaviors and related to that,

101
00:05:50.109 --> 00:05:56.190
uh, how it correlates with oxytocin levels. So, to

102
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.390
start off with in this section, so how does

103
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.450
oxytocin work? What kinds of affiliate Behavior is it

104
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.329
associated with? Because, you know, nowadays, we hear a

105
00:06:07.329 --> 00:06:11.739
lot about hormones on, uh, I mean, everywhere, basically.

106
00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:17.359
And sometimes people have very, uh, very reductive and,

107
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.420
uh, oversimplistic ideas about how, how hormones work, particularly

108
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.450
in the brain. So, in this case, uh, tell

109
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.709
us a little bit about oxytocin.

110
00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:32.100
Yeah, definitely. Um, SO oxytocin is a neuropeptide hormone,

111
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.209
um, so it's a chemical messenger essentially in the

112
00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:40.410
body, and what people typically think of when they

113
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.130
hear about oxytocin is its involvement in social social

114
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:51.100
attachment, social bonding formation, um. Uh, ORIGINALLY we learned

115
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.299
about oxytocin in the context of mother infant bonding,

116
00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:59.850
um, parental bonding, uh, oxytocin is heavily involved in,

117
00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:05.380
um, you know, like pregnancy, birth, um, lactation. Um,

118
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.269
BUT we also know now that oxytocin is also

119
00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:14.339
related to affiliative behaviors and group cohesion maintenance, um,

120
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.790
general cooperation outside of reproductive concept, um, context as

121
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.410
well, um, and so it's a really interesting hormone

122
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.709
because, um, it, it is, it does seem to

123
00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:28.980
be involved in a lot of these other, um,

124
00:07:28.989 --> 00:07:35.100
generally positive like pro-social contexts, um, particularly. For sort

125
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.179
of increasing that type of behavior, though we also

126
00:07:38.179 --> 00:07:41.609
are now realizing that oxytocin, that sounds really great

127
00:07:41.609 --> 00:07:45.260
and awesome, is not just this like wonder hormone

128
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.149
that it can't solve every problem. Um, THERE'S been

129
00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:51.679
evidence that increases in oxytocin are also associated with

130
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:57.109
increases in um Uh, like distrust in an outgroup,

131
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.790
for instance, like, so we might have more in-group

132
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.220
cohesion, but the effects of that would be, um,

133
00:08:03.429 --> 00:08:05.390
sort of like the opposite effects on it, the

134
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.470
outgroup. So there's, it's not this perfect hormone, but

135
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.325
um it is a really interesting. HORMONE and there's

136
00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:13.765
definitely a lot to learn about it, but overall,

137
00:08:13.875 --> 00:08:17.244
um, oxytocin generally when we think of oxytocin, we

138
00:08:17.244 --> 00:08:22.195
think of social affiliation, social attachment, social bonding, um,

139
00:08:22.364 --> 00:08:24.915
general social behaviors, yeah.

140
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:29.489
So when it comes to the in-group, out-group dynamics

141
00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:35.090
aspect, it can uh lead to in-group cohesion, but

142
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.590
that can translate at least in certain contexts into

143
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.340
violence toward uh outgroups, for example.

144
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.030
Yeah, and like you said, it's all very context

145
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.880
specific, so, um, you know, increasing oxytocin in one

146
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.520
circumstance will not have the same effect as in

147
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.799
another circumstance, um, but you're right, there's been some

148
00:08:56.799 --> 00:09:00.770
examples that There have been different effects of oxytocin

149
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.000
in the context of in-group versus outgroup.

150
00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:06.289
Mhm. Yeah, I mean, the, the context here, I

151
00:09:06.289 --> 00:09:10.630
guess it's one of the most important aspects of

152
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:15.049
how hormones or the effects, the specific effects that

153
00:09:15.049 --> 00:09:19.010
hormones have because they vary a lot depending on

154
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.289
the context. And for example, oxytocin, it's one of

155
00:09:22.289 --> 00:09:26.750
those hormones that Uh, popularly he's known at least

156
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:31.349
in certain books, for example, as the love hormone,

157
00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:34.679
but, and what, what people usually mean by love

158
00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:37.349
in that case is romantic love, but I mean,

159
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.510
it's uh very much uh uh I mean, it's

160
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.179
effects are much broader than that.

161
00:09:44.929 --> 00:09:48.340
Yes, absolutely. And that's exactly right. It is not

162
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.500
just this love hormone, even though that's maybe what

163
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.700
we know it best for. Um, THERE'S another side

164
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.890
to oxytocin as well.

165
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.690
So, in the case of capuchin monkeys specifically, uh,

166
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.179
how does it manifest in terms of their affiliated

167
00:10:04.179 --> 00:10:07.200
behaviors? For example, I know that you've studied fur

168
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.859
rubbing behavior and how it relates to oxytocin. So

169
00:10:11.859 --> 00:10:13.460
tell us a little bit about that.

170
00:10:14.289 --> 00:10:18.320
Yeah, um, so my colleagues and I were able

171
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.809
to investigate how this species typical behavior called fur

172
00:10:22.809 --> 00:10:27.559
rubbing impacts urinary oxytocin and capuchin monkeys. So, um,

173
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.289
let me just briefly explain what fur rubbing is,

174
00:10:30.659 --> 00:10:35.289
um. So capuchin monkeys in the wild and also

175
00:10:35.289 --> 00:10:38.760
in captivity, um, when they have access to certain

176
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.809
items, which in our case um was onions, but

177
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.349
anything that's sort of like in the allium family

178
00:10:46.349 --> 00:10:48.650
or um sometimes they've been seen to do it

179
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:54.159
with peppers, uh, insects on occasion, capuchins will essentially

180
00:10:54.369 --> 00:10:57.330
take the item and they'll kind of like break

181
00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.659
it up and rub it like all over their

182
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.659
bodies and And while they're rubbing it on their

183
00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:03.700
bodies, they kind of get up to their partners

184
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.260
and start rubbing all over their partners while their

185
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.460
partners are rubbing the object on their bodies. And

186
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.890
so you kind of just get this frenzied pile

187
00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:16.020
of capuchin monkeys that are all like excitedly rubbing

188
00:11:16.219 --> 00:11:18.460
their fur on each other. Um, SO that's what

189
00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.380
we're talking about when we talk about fur rubbing.

190
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.500
And so, um, what we investigated was whether this

191
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:31.219
fur rubbing behavior, which You know, upon observation brings

192
00:11:31.219 --> 00:11:34.049
a lot of the monkeys together in closer proximity

193
00:11:34.049 --> 00:11:37.299
in contact, um, you know, they are all around

194
00:11:37.299 --> 00:11:40.020
each other. We thought maybe there was a possibility

195
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.460
that this behavior is somehow related to oxytocin. Maybe

196
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.140
oxytocin levels are changing when they engage in this

197
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.580
behavior, um, so we did look at how fur

198
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:56.020
rubbing impacted urinary oxytocin levels in the monkeys, um.

199
00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.289
And we also know for instance that so grooming

200
00:12:00.289 --> 00:12:03.530
behavior, which is another um important social behavior in

201
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:08.630
many primate species, but especially capuchin monkeys, um. Grooming

202
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:12.739
increases urinary oxytocin levels in capuchins, and so um

203
00:12:12.739 --> 00:12:17.900
we were able to evaluate how Grooming behavior compared

204
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.359
to fur rubbing behavior, um compared to control, and

205
00:12:22.359 --> 00:12:25.070
we did find that there were increases in oxytocin

206
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.989
um after fur rubbing bouts, and we found differences

207
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.520
um looking across a 60 minute time frame, we

208
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.340
saw increases starting at the 15 minute time point,

209
00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:41.960
um, and these differences were above baseline and similar

210
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.880
to what we see after bout of grooming.

211
00:12:45.409 --> 00:12:49.250
Mhm. Uh, AND so, let me get now into

212
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.890
another topic, then another one that I mentioned in

213
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:56.049
the introduction. Uh, YOU'VE also studied sex differences in

214
00:12:56.049 --> 00:13:00.789
the brains of capuchin monkeys. So, what did you

215
00:13:00.789 --> 00:13:03.770
find there? And then we can perhaps expand to

216
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.609
see how it might relate at least to a

217
00:13:06.609 --> 00:13:10.520
certain extent to differences in the brains of humans,

218
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.090
but let's start with capuchin monkeys.

219
00:13:13.669 --> 00:13:16.099
Yeah, sure, um, yeah, so we, we did look

220
00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:19.140
at capuchin monkeys, um, and how there are we

221
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.179
did find some sex differences in the capuchin monkey

222
00:13:21.179 --> 00:13:23.330
brain. We thought there might be because we know

223
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.340
that there are certain behavioral differences in capuchin monkeys,

224
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.969
so, um, just for a little bit of background,

225
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:33.580
we capuchin monkeys are um a group living primate,

226
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.380
so they live in these social groups in the

227
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.979
wild, and the ones that were um a part

228
00:13:38.979 --> 00:13:42.090
of this study also lived in social groups, um,

229
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.150
like how they went in the wild. And um,

230
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.289
Females tend to have these strong social relationships with

231
00:13:50.289 --> 00:13:53.809
kin, but they'll also form relationships with non-kin. um,

232
00:13:53.979 --> 00:13:58.520
MALES will too, but females also show. These um

233
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.460
other uh important behaviors for social cognition, which would

234
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.479
be, um, they exhibit all nursing behaviors, they will

235
00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:11.400
cooperate with other group members, um, they will, females

236
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.119
will aid in infant rearing together, um, so they

237
00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:20.210
have this very cooperative. Um, WE could characterize their

238
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.840
social niche as being a very cooperative one. MALES

239
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.799
do have friends too, but they also engage in

240
00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:32.559
more, um, like aggressive territory defense behaviors, and none

241
00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:34.119
of this is like totally black and white. There

242
00:14:34.119 --> 00:14:36.229
are females that will do this too, but males

243
00:14:36.229 --> 00:14:38.280
do so more. They're the primary defenders of their

244
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:43.020
group typically in the wild, um. And males we

245
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.299
know also undergo what we refer to as a

246
00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:49.419
secondary puberty. So during this time period they will

247
00:14:49.419 --> 00:14:51.940
grow like a wider, their faces will widen, their

248
00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.650
body mass increases, they'll show increases in testosterone level.

249
00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.340
Um, MALES, when they reach puberty will leave their

250
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.299
social groups in the wild, whereas females are the

251
00:15:01.299 --> 00:15:03.619
ones that stay in their social groups. So we

252
00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:07.010
do see these sort of differences between the sexes,

253
00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:10.340
um, in general, and so we thought that perhaps

254
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.830
we would see these differences reflected in the brain.

255
00:15:13.219 --> 00:15:17.969
Um, WE also know that capuchins are unique and

256
00:15:17.969 --> 00:15:21.590
interesting because even though they are not an ape,

257
00:15:21.809 --> 00:15:25.349
they share, they converge with humans and other apes

258
00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:28.270
on certain things. So for instance, they have a

259
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.619
large brain to body size ratio. Which basically means

260
00:15:31.619 --> 00:15:34.739
they have big heads for their bodies, um, and

261
00:15:34.739 --> 00:15:37.030
that's something that we typically use as an index

262
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.770
of or a measure of cognitive ability, and so,

263
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.059
um, that's an important feature that they share with

264
00:15:43.059 --> 00:15:46.369
humans and with other ages. They are pretty cooperative.

265
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.659
They're prosocial species that's um unusually tolerant when we

266
00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:53.729
consider that they have social hierarchies in their groups,

267
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.580
so there's typically Um, an alpha male, and alpha

268
00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.270
female, and then several individuals of varying ranks beneath

269
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.460
them, so they're not quite as linear in their

270
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.739
hierarchy as say Rhesus macaques are, but they still

271
00:16:06.739 --> 00:16:09.260
shared, um, they still have this hierarchy in their

272
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.950
social groups. So, um, given all of that. We

273
00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.760
looked for differences in their brains, so, um, for

274
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.659
your viewers who may not be as familiar with

275
00:16:19.909 --> 00:16:23.989
neuroscience in general, we um we're looking at gray

276
00:16:23.989 --> 00:16:26.109
matter, which the brain is made up of gray

277
00:16:26.109 --> 00:16:28.830
matter and white matter. Gray matter is the area

278
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.280
of the brain that actually does look a little

279
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.229
more gray if you're looking at an MRI scan,

280
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:36.604
but That's basically the cell bodies, um, where most

281
00:16:36.604 --> 00:16:38.565
of those are, and then in the white matter

282
00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:42.484
you have um like the axons, um, the myelinated

283
00:16:42.484 --> 00:16:46.044
axons from the cell bodies, and so we looked

284
00:16:46.044 --> 00:16:48.924
at both, so we started looking at gray matter

285
00:16:48.924 --> 00:16:51.724
volume, and we did find that there were differences

286
00:16:51.724 --> 00:16:56.150
between males and females, so. What's interesting is that

287
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.869
males showed expansion in the region of the hypothalamus,

288
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.309
and the hypothalamus is a part of the brain

289
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.430
that is um responsible for a lot of the

290
00:17:07.598 --> 00:17:11.108
more um what we think of as instinctual behaviors,

291
00:17:11.118 --> 00:17:17.040
so like, um. Territory defense, reproduction, that sort of

292
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.729
behavior, and then females we we saw expansion in

293
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.280
areas that are typically considered to be more like

294
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.118
higher order areas. So, um, areas associated with like

295
00:17:28.118 --> 00:17:32.520
visual processing, um, social attention um or social processing

296
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.839
and attention, I should say, um, and then we

297
00:17:35.839 --> 00:17:39.680
also looked at white matter differences in white matter.

298
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.500
Um, SO we looked at specifically, um, differences in

299
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:49.619
fractional anisotropy. So fractional anisotropy refers to, um, differences

300
00:17:49.619 --> 00:17:53.140
in the directionality of water diffusion across white matter

301
00:17:53.579 --> 00:17:59.219
microstructure, um. And so we saw that there were

302
00:17:59.219 --> 00:18:04.150
differences um such that females had higher fractional anisotropy

303
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:08.540
than males in um several regions that sort of

304
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.859
spanned the motor cortex, premotor cortex, and the somatosensory

305
00:18:12.859 --> 00:18:17.020
cortex, um, and these areas also projected to areas

306
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.859
that are similarly involved in some of those higher

307
00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:23.349
order, um, those higher order regions that I mentioned

308
00:18:23.349 --> 00:18:27.560
before, so. You asked how this is different from

309
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.319
what we see in humans, um, so one of

310
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:34.079
the most interesting things that we found in these

311
00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:38.160
sex differences is that the ranges in which they

312
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.420
occurred were completely no overlapping. Um, SO this is

313
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.719
actually pretty similar to what has been found in

314
00:18:43.719 --> 00:18:48.079
rodents. So, um, we know that rodents show these

315
00:18:48.079 --> 00:18:52.310
non-overlapping ranges ranges in sex differences, but In rodents,

316
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.750
these differences typically happen more in the areas that

317
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.900
are associated with that those ancestral um regions that

318
00:19:00.109 --> 00:19:03.229
are responsible for the more instinctual behaviors, so like

319
00:19:03.229 --> 00:19:07.680
they're reproductive in the territory defense, whereas in the

320
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.790
capuchins, we saw these differences in the higher order

321
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:16.689
regions in addition to the hypothalamus, but um. And

322
00:19:16.689 --> 00:19:20.119
they were also completely not overlapping, but in humans,

323
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.829
the difference is that we see much more overlap,

324
00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:28.969
so it's very, um, the human brain sex differences

325
00:19:28.969 --> 00:19:31.410
occur on much more of a continuum. There's not,

326
00:19:31.449 --> 00:19:34.010
you can't look at a human brain scan and

327
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.689
know for sure if that's a male or female

328
00:19:35.689 --> 00:19:38.030
just by looking at it, um, because humans are

329
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.709
are much more um. It's so it's much more

330
00:19:41.709 --> 00:19:45.589
overlap in human sex differences, but the interesting thing

331
00:19:45.589 --> 00:19:48.650
is that we do see sex differences in the

332
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:52.800
capuchin brain in these higher order areas. Where there's

333
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.599
no overlap or um no overlapping ranges where we

334
00:19:56.599 --> 00:19:59.479
do see overlap in humans. um SO that so

335
00:19:59.479 --> 00:20:03.319
that was interesting and we uh you know what

336
00:20:03.319 --> 00:20:06.479
the study was really interesting, but we can't for

337
00:20:06.479 --> 00:20:09.239
sure know why we saw these differences because this

338
00:20:09.239 --> 00:20:12.640
was not we were not able to determine causality

339
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.520
with this study, um, so we can postulate why

340
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.469
we see these differences, but ultimately we're not sure,

341
00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:25.900
um. One thought is that there are um differences

342
00:20:26.069 --> 00:20:30.229
in the socioecology or like the life experiences that

343
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:32.989
capuchin monkeys have. So when you think about capuchin

344
00:20:32.989 --> 00:20:36.670
monkeys in comparison to humans, for instance, um capuchin

345
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:42.540
males and females have much more um differentiated. Social

346
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.260
niches between males and females, sort of like I

347
00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.979
was describing before and so we suspect that there

348
00:20:48.979 --> 00:20:53.459
are different socioecologies in combination, say with their um

349
00:20:53.459 --> 00:20:56.260
they have a prolonged developmental history, so or I'm

350
00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.170
sorry, developmental um period just like humans do, but

351
00:21:00.439 --> 00:21:03.449
um humans actually have even a longer developmental period,

352
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.239
um. So we think that these factors may contribute

353
00:21:07.239 --> 00:21:10.199
to the sex differences that we saw, um, but

354
00:21:10.199 --> 00:21:13.160
again it's, it's, we can't know for sure just

355
00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.989
based on this type of study that we did,

356
00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:18.449
um, we can only postulate, but it's definitely interesting,

357
00:21:18.599 --> 00:21:20.719
um, and I think it's important that we sort

358
00:21:20.719 --> 00:21:22.920
of look more into sex differences and other primate

359
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.880
species to see how these differences that we found

360
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.400
may or may not be reflected in other species

361
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.520
that are more or less closely related to humans

362
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.810
on a phylogenetic scale.

363
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.569
So, I have a few questions, follow-up questions to

364
00:21:38.569 --> 00:21:42.000
ask you about that. So, first of all, uh,

365
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:47.359
in terms of our phylogenetic relationship to capuchin monkeys,

366
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:51.969
how close or far are we from them? I

367
00:21:51.969 --> 00:21:54.290
mean, basically, what I'm trying to ask you is

368
00:21:54.290 --> 00:22:00.270
phylogenetically speaking, how much can we expect to find

369
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:05.209
similarities between us and capuchin monkeys specifically?

370
00:22:06.609 --> 00:22:08.410
That's a good question, and I guess it's all

371
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:12.000
relative, but we of course are most closely related

372
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.130
to the apes because we most recently shared a

373
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:18.560
common ancestor with apes, and then after the apes

374
00:22:18.689 --> 00:22:24.810
we have um The species of monkeys like the

375
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:28.979
rhesus macaque monkeys, for instance, and then the neotropical

376
00:22:28.979 --> 00:22:32.739
primates would come after them, and I should have

377
00:22:32.739 --> 00:22:35.739
an exact year to tell you a range of

378
00:22:35.739 --> 00:22:38.109
how many thousands of years ago that common ancestor

379
00:22:38.109 --> 00:22:39.619
existed, but I don't remember off the top of

380
00:22:39.619 --> 00:22:43.979
my head. Um, SO capuchins are farther back, but

381
00:22:43.979 --> 00:22:48.579
not the most far back, um, when we're talking

382
00:22:48.579 --> 00:22:51.560
about an evolutionary scale. And they don't have the

383
00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.630
exact year for you.

384
00:22:52.839 --> 00:22:54.719
No, no, that's OK. I mean, I know that

385
00:22:54.719 --> 00:22:59.560
evolutionarily speaking, there's lots of different dates and it's

386
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.239
also not extremely precise, so

387
00:23:02.239 --> 00:23:05.900
yeah. Yeah, that's true, but many, many thousands of

388
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:06.729
years ago.

389
00:23:08.349 --> 00:23:11.520
And so, I mean, it's interesting that you mentioned,

390
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:14.569
uh, one of the hypotheses on the table, at

391
00:23:14.569 --> 00:23:18.050
least according to you and your colleagues for to

392
00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:21.599
explaining these differences that we find between male and

393
00:23:21.599 --> 00:23:25.079
female capuchin monkeys in their brains has to do

394
00:23:25.079 --> 00:23:30.954
with, uh, socio-ecological uh factors. The This is very

395
00:23:30.954 --> 00:23:34.604
interesting because many times, and, uh, of course, talking

396
00:23:34.604 --> 00:23:37.724
about sex differences and particularly when we try to

397
00:23:37.724 --> 00:23:42.525
extrapolate to humans is a very contentious topic to

398
00:23:42.525 --> 00:23:45.405
say the least. But, uh, and, uh, at least

399
00:23:45.405 --> 00:23:47.925
to some extent for good reason, because even in

400
00:23:47.925 --> 00:23:52.589
other animals, other primates in this particular case. I

401
00:23:52.589 --> 00:23:57.390
mean, just by finding differences between males and females

402
00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.780
in their brains, that doesn't necessarily imply that they

403
00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:01.959
are innate.

404
00:24:02.469 --> 00:24:07.709
Right. Right, yeah, exactly. Um, YEAH, we just because

405
00:24:07.709 --> 00:24:09.729
we found these differences does not mean they're innate.

406
00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.790
In fact, uh, it could be that there are

407
00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:17.530
differences in the capuchin brain because, um, perhaps they

408
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.959
So there's a couple, there's a couple possibilities. Um,

409
00:24:20.969 --> 00:24:25.810
ONE is that couchins could have these differences because

410
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:30.319
they reside in these different ecological social niches. Um,

411
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:35.390
ANOTHER possibility is that The sex differences may exist

412
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.719
as a way to sort of um we'll say

413
00:24:38.719 --> 00:24:44.000
equalize the differences that may be occurring, um, and

414
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.369
so. To sort of like make these differences less

415
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.500
drastic, um, it's their brains may be it may

416
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.369
be like more of a compensatory effect, um, but,

417
00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.780
but again, yeah, a lot of this it it's

418
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.390
really hard to know for sure because we were

419
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.579
not able to control for. THAT we were not

420
00:25:06.579 --> 00:25:09.540
able to figure out this from like what caused

421
00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.739
these differences. Um, I'm not sure that we ever

422
00:25:12.739 --> 00:25:14.660
will truly be able to figure it out just

423
00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.260
because in order to do that there, I don't

424
00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.660
know how you would be able to ethically do

425
00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:24.219
that in a study, uh, noninvasively whatnot, but um.

426
00:25:24.969 --> 00:25:27.469
Yeah, so it just because we found these differences

427
00:25:27.469 --> 00:25:32.750
does not mean that they were innate, um, or

428
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.790
it could be maybe there's a mix like there

429
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:37.349
could be some areas that are innately different and

430
00:25:37.349 --> 00:25:40.949
then they become less different with uh their lived

431
00:25:40.949 --> 00:25:43.699
experience or they become more different with their lived

432
00:25:43.699 --> 00:25:48.989
experience. I mean, Of course capuchins are a more

433
00:25:49.359 --> 00:25:52.489
extreme example than humans because males and females do

434
00:25:52.719 --> 00:25:56.439
inhabit different niches. I would argue more so than

435
00:25:56.439 --> 00:26:02.439
humans, um, but humans also have more complex social

436
00:26:02.439 --> 00:26:06.800
and cultural experiences than capuchin monkeys do, um, much

437
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.719
more complex, I would argue, and we have much

438
00:26:09.719 --> 00:26:15.780
larger social groups and so. In some ways capuchins

439
00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.060
are more extreme in their differences, but in other

440
00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:22.500
ways, humans are more extreme in our lived experiences

441
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.260
and so that, but, you know, so I, I

442
00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.589
don't want to extrapolate too much to humans because

443
00:26:27.589 --> 00:26:30.979
humans are a far more complex model. Uh, I

444
00:26:30.979 --> 00:26:33.380
don't think this is just a a black and

445
00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.010
white issue for human sex differences. I think there

446
00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:39.020
that's a very complex issue and I think there's

447
00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:44.969
a lot that historically we have. MISATTRIBUTED to um

448
00:26:46.599 --> 00:26:49.680
I think, I think sex differences in humans, it's

449
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.910
just not as simple as as we may think.

450
00:26:53.069 --> 00:26:55.310
I think there's probably a lot more contributing to

451
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.300
that than what we see in the capuchin monkeys.

452
00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.109
No, and that was exactly one of the points

453
00:27:00.109 --> 00:27:02.640
that I was trying to get at that, uh,

454
00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.119
I mean, when I asked you about phylogenetics, how

455
00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:09.000
much we can compare, in this case, capuchin monkeys,

456
00:27:09.079 --> 00:27:12.189
but it could be any other primate to humans,

457
00:27:12.199 --> 00:27:15.239
uh, and also other factors that might play a

458
00:27:15.239 --> 00:27:18.473
role that I would imagine, of course. THAT in

459
00:27:18.473 --> 00:27:22.253
humans, we have a more complex culture and there

460
00:27:22.253 --> 00:27:25.932
are more cultural factors that we have to take

461
00:27:25.932 --> 00:27:30.812
into account to really understand where sex differences in

462
00:27:30.812 --> 00:27:36.042
the brain behaviorally and in some other domains, uh,

463
00:27:36.052 --> 00:27:41.526
where they stem from exactly. So, uh, yeah, basically,

464
00:27:41.706 --> 00:27:46.145
I mean, even in other animals, in other animal

465
00:27:46.145 --> 00:27:51.426
models, it's not just because we find these differences

466
00:27:51.426 --> 00:27:56.586
that many times are statistical differences, average differences between

467
00:27:56.586 --> 00:28:02.579
males and females that They are necessarily inborn differences

468
00:28:02.579 --> 00:28:07.780
and that we can immediately extrapolate from any animal

469
00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:12.099
model to humans because there's lots of uh preps.

470
00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.709
I mean, not only Uh, you have evolved differences

471
00:28:16.709 --> 00:28:21.630
because there's also something separating us even from chimpanzees

472
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:28.260
and bonobos, but also, uh, socio-ecological, cultural differences and,

473
00:28:28.349 --> 00:28:29.130
and so on,

474
00:28:29.349 --> 00:28:34.800
right? Yeah, absolutely, and um. Yeah, there's a lot

475
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:39.439
of factors that I imagine are contributing, and we

476
00:28:39.439 --> 00:28:43.719
also know that um humans have very plastic brains,

477
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.869
so our brains are very uh they have ability

478
00:28:47.869 --> 00:28:51.920
to respond to the environment, but, um, like you

479
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.719
said, We experience we all have very complex lives

480
00:28:56.719 --> 00:29:00.319
as humans, um, and I'm not saying that other

481
00:29:00.319 --> 00:29:03.359
primates don't experience complex lives because actually in my

482
00:29:03.359 --> 00:29:05.079
opinion what makes Capuchin's a great model is that

483
00:29:05.079 --> 00:29:07.800
they do live in these complex social groups. They

484
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.079
do need to keep track of their other social

485
00:29:11.079 --> 00:29:13.479
group members who's higher ranking and who maybe we

486
00:29:13.479 --> 00:29:16.520
want to avoid around food, who's lower ranking, who's

487
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.599
kin, who's non kin, so there's there are these

488
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.770
important social. Pieces of knowledge that capuchins need to

489
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.010
be able to keep track of and similarly with

490
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:28.329
other apes as well, but Like you mentioned, there

491
00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:33.520
are many thousands of years dividing humans from capuchins,

492
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:36.969
um, and and and even with the apes as

493
00:29:36.969 --> 00:29:39.800
well. So it's important to keep in mind that

494
00:29:40.329 --> 00:29:43.449
just because in and this is just in general

495
00:29:43.449 --> 00:29:46.650
in science, when we find a result that exists

496
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.849
in a primate or even a rodent, it doesn't

497
00:29:49.849 --> 00:29:53.410
always mean it will directly translate to humans, um.

498
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:58.209
And uh Yeah, I, I think that's a, that's

499
00:29:58.209 --> 00:30:00.770
a really important point to consider is that, um,

500
00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:04.609
We're we're working on finding answers, but it's not

501
00:30:04.609 --> 00:30:07.650
always an easy simple answer, and we also have

502
00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.369
to keep in mind that in this study we

503
00:30:10.369 --> 00:30:14.849
had um a small sample size and so before

504
00:30:14.849 --> 00:30:19.329
we can go drawing really concrete conclusions, it would

505
00:30:19.329 --> 00:30:21.810
be important for other people to sort of add

506
00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.880
to this body of work, to increase sample size,

507
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:29.369
um. And so that we can see replication in

508
00:30:29.369 --> 00:30:32.449
our results and uh that would that would definitely

509
00:30:32.449 --> 00:30:35.209
help with the conclusions that we can draw about

510
00:30:35.209 --> 00:30:36.479
capuchin monkeys at least.

511
00:30:36.729 --> 00:30:41.239
Mhm. And when it comes to the socio-ecological aspect

512
00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:44.010
of all of these, I guess that another thing

513
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:47.290
to keep in mind is that it also means

514
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:50.859
that if you Uh, picked, uh, the exact, the

515
00:30:50.859 --> 00:30:54.859
exact same males and females and put them in

516
00:30:54.859 --> 00:31:01.699
other, in another socio-ecological context, they would probably behave

517
00:31:01.699 --> 00:31:05.155
very differently, right? I mean, they would. Still be

518
00:31:05.165 --> 00:31:10.185
capuchin monkeys with their capuchin uh biology and physiology,

519
00:31:10.405 --> 00:31:15.685
but being exposed to other socio-ecological factors, the same

520
00:31:15.685 --> 00:31:20.155
females and the same males would uh behave differently,

521
00:31:20.484 --> 00:31:24.525
right? Yeah, um, I think, I think so. I

522
00:31:24.525 --> 00:31:26.364
think it's possible that if you put picked them

523
00:31:26.364 --> 00:31:29.069
up and put them down in a Totally different

524
00:31:29.069 --> 00:31:31.949
environment, um, their behavior may change, but I think

525
00:31:31.949 --> 00:31:33.709
there would be certain things if they were put

526
00:31:33.709 --> 00:31:35.609
down in the environment with the same individuals around

527
00:31:35.609 --> 00:31:38.869
them. I think their social environment would stay a

528
00:31:38.869 --> 00:31:43.239
little bit more constant, uh, but You know, also

529
00:31:43.239 --> 00:31:47.560
capuchin monkeys don't just stay necessarily in one social

530
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.040
position their whole life too, so that can change

531
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.199
about them as well, but there are certain things

532
00:31:52.199 --> 00:31:54.790
that are constant like there will always be an

533
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.699
alpha male and an alpha female and the alpha

534
00:31:57.699 --> 00:32:02.319
male sort of. Has say over even the a

535
00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:04.500
female and there are certain things that would stay

536
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.670
the same, but you're right, um, if they, they,

537
00:32:08.199 --> 00:32:10.800
they also exist in in a fluid environment and

538
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.390
so they're always um There's potential for change, but

539
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.400
um, I think certain things would also maybe stay

540
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.280
the same if I'm understanding your question correctly. Yeah,

541
00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:22.750
yeah, yeah, no, and, and by the way, how

542
00:32:23.199 --> 00:32:29.239
much sexual dimorphism do we find in capuchin monkeys

543
00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:32.599
specifically? I mean, in terms of their anatomy, for

544
00:32:32.599 --> 00:32:35.760
example, because I was wondering if that would also

545
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.839
play a role in perhaps some of these uh

546
00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:41.760
sex differences in the brain or not.

547
00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:45.430
Um, SO yeah, capuchins show a moderate amount of

548
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:48.829
sexual dimorphism. They're not the most extreme example of

549
00:32:48.829 --> 00:32:53.989
that in primates, but males typically have a larger

550
00:32:53.989 --> 00:32:57.989
body size than females. Um, THEY have larger canines

551
00:32:57.989 --> 00:33:00.589
in adulthood, so their teeth are a lot bigger

552
00:33:00.589 --> 00:33:06.989
than females. Um, THEY have higher testosterone levels in

553
00:33:06.989 --> 00:33:13.449
adulthood, um, males do than females, um. So yeah,

554
00:33:13.609 --> 00:33:15.530
there's, I would say they have a moderate amount

555
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:21.439
of dimorphism between males and females, um. Humans have

556
00:33:21.439 --> 00:33:24.359
far less between males and females. Um, THERE'S some

557
00:33:24.359 --> 00:33:27.540
obvious things, of course, but Uh, I would argue

558
00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:31.689
that capuchins are have moderate sexual dimorphism. Mhm.

559
00:33:31.939 --> 00:33:35.770
Yeah, I mean, I mentioned that also because in

560
00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.579
conversations I had on the show with people that

561
00:33:38.579 --> 00:33:43.060
come from different perspectives for uh still from an

562
00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:46.420
evolutionary perspective, but they have different readings of the

563
00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.880
literature. And many times sexual dimorphism comes to the

564
00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.680
table and Um, I mean, I've had conversations with,

565
00:33:54.719 --> 00:33:59.160
for example, Doctor Austin Fuentes, an anthropologist from Princeton,

566
00:33:59.199 --> 00:34:02.790
and they mentioned the fact that Uh, on average,

567
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:10.379
there's only, uh, males in humans are 15% bigger

568
00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.149
than females on average. And so it's a relatively

569
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.239
small sexual dimorphism and uh, that, that also matters

570
00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:22.510
when it comes to really, I mean, coming up

571
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:28.320
with evolutionary accounts of sex differences in humans and

572
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.510
other species.

573
00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.120
Right. Yeah, that's that's interesting. I, I don't know

574
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:36.330
percentage wise what the difference would be, but that

575
00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:39.000
is a good question and would be interesting to

576
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.250
know in relation to other species too, uh, and

577
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:44.969
maybe someone does know out there. I, I just

578
00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:47.929
don't know myself, but I know that there are

579
00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:52.719
enough differences that um. Typically, at least in adulthood,

580
00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:54.810
you can tell when it's a male versus a

581
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.209
female because it's just like things like body size,

582
00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:01.949
um, like face with like that, um. But yeah,

583
00:35:02.149 --> 00:35:06.989
there's there's enough dimorphism that enough to suspect that

584
00:35:06.989 --> 00:35:09.830
there could also be differences in the brain because

585
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:13.070
there may have been selection on those sex differences

586
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:17.520
in body morphology and behavior that may have changed

587
00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:21.379
the evolution of the brain, so, um, but yeah,

588
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:24.110
I, it's less dras or sorry, it's more drastic

589
00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:25.550
than what we see in humans where I think

590
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.459
there's less um on average.

591
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:31.340
Mhm. And just to go back to an earlier

592
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.580
point you made just for me to see if

593
00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:37.540
I get it right. So, in the brains of

594
00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:41.179
humans compared to the brains of capuchin monkeys, for

595
00:35:41.179 --> 00:35:45.290
example, the areas where we tend to find sexual

596
00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:49.649
dimorphism in humans, the, uh, it's, they are more

597
00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.699
overlapping. I mean, the distributions between males and females

598
00:35:53.699 --> 00:35:57.379
overlap more than in capuchin monkeys, correct.

599
00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.979
Yeah, we found effectively no overlap in the areas

600
00:36:01.979 --> 00:36:05.020
that we saw differences. There were no like overlap

601
00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.500
in ranges between males and females, but that's not

602
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.100
the case in humans. In humans we definitely see

603
00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.540
overlap. Mhm.

604
00:36:11.979 --> 00:36:13.989
And I guess that, uh, I mean, this will

605
00:36:13.989 --> 00:36:17.550
be my last point about this, uh, topic, but

606
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.070
I guess that's another thing to keep in mind

607
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:24.189
here is that we are also studying usually the

608
00:36:24.189 --> 00:36:27.530
brains of, uh, adults, right? And the brains of

609
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:31.110
adults are brains that have already gone through development

610
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:36.750
and life experiences and, uh, unique experiences that individuals

611
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:38.989
have and all of that. So they have already

612
00:36:38.989 --> 00:36:43.340
been exposed to lots of different Environmental factors. So

613
00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:47.939
again, uh, picking on those sort of uh imaging

614
00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:51.060
studies, for example, to make a case that if

615
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:55.050
we find average differences between males and females, they

616
00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:58.020
are, it's because they are in a, uh, I

617
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:02.580
mean, there's not much uh a basis to support

618
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:02.949
that,

619
00:37:03.219 --> 00:37:08.530
right? You mean in pre-adulthood, so in, I mean,

620
00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:08.699
I,

621
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.929
I

622
00:37:08.929 --> 00:37:09.010
mean,

623
00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:12.479
I, I, I was mentioning the fact that most

624
00:37:12.479 --> 00:37:16.500
of the time we study, at least in humans,

625
00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:20.209
the brains of adults, right? We, we have already

626
00:37:20.209 --> 00:37:25.304
undergone development and been exposed to lots. Of environmental

627
00:37:25.304 --> 00:37:27.415
factors during their life,

628
00:37:27.574 --> 00:37:30.425
right? Yeah, yeah, and then adults, of course, have

629
00:37:30.425 --> 00:37:33.705
experienced more of the social aspects of being human

630
00:37:33.705 --> 00:37:36.415
and cultural aspects of being human that may have

631
00:37:36.864 --> 00:37:40.155
affected their brain by that point. Um, BUT yeah,

632
00:37:40.225 --> 00:37:42.294
I don't know in, in children, I'm not sure,

633
00:37:42.864 --> 00:37:45.135
I'm not as familiar with that literature about whether

634
00:37:45.304 --> 00:37:48.064
we would see what the sex differences would look

635
00:37:48.064 --> 00:37:50.225
like in kids who have theoretically been exposed to

636
00:37:50.225 --> 00:37:52.544
less of that at that stage in their development.

637
00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:55.120
Uh, YOU know, I also don't know about this.

638
00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.860
I was just commenting on those. So, uh, uh,

639
00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:02.070
so, uh, just before we finish, would you like

640
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:06.389
to tell people, uh, what kinds of things you're

641
00:38:06.389 --> 00:38:09.090
working on at the moment and what you're going

642
00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:11.110
to work on in, in the near future?

643
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:16.260
Oh yeah, sure, um, so actually I have added

644
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.219
a model species to my research repertoire. I'm now

645
00:38:20.219 --> 00:38:24.300
working with dogs and um using um actually the

646
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.810
domestic dogs, so pet dogs as a model of

647
00:38:27.854 --> 00:38:32.135
How selection for behavior could have shaped the brain,

648
00:38:32.485 --> 00:38:35.245
um, and, and one of the projects that I'll

649
00:38:35.245 --> 00:38:38.564
be working on is looking at, um, so I

650
00:38:38.564 --> 00:38:42.485
was talking about earlier how oxytocin is important in

651
00:38:42.485 --> 00:38:45.794
social attachment formation. So I will be looking at

652
00:38:45.794 --> 00:38:50.455
um what social attachment between children and pet dogs

653
00:38:50.455 --> 00:38:52.925
looks like um on a hormonal level but also

654
00:38:52.925 --> 00:38:56.500
in the brains of children. And their pet dogs.

655
00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:00.389
Um, SO that's, that's one of my upcoming research

656
00:39:00.389 --> 00:39:02.909
directions that I'll be working on, and it sort

657
00:39:02.909 --> 00:39:05.229
of relates to some of the work I've done

658
00:39:05.229 --> 00:39:09.350
in the past, um, looking at how, um, in

659
00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:14.679
the capuchin monkeys social support, um, Maybe be related

660
00:39:14.679 --> 00:39:19.760
to stress buffering, so, um, an increase in oxytocin

661
00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.199
or social support, uh, may reduce stress and using

662
00:39:24.199 --> 00:39:26.719
cortisol, which is another hormone, um, sort of as

663
00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:28.760
a metric for that. And so now I'm taking

664
00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.159
that idea and looking at this in kids and

665
00:39:32.159 --> 00:39:35.290
their pet dogs to see if Having a pet

666
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:38.560
dog can sort of reduce stress for a child,

667
00:39:38.669 --> 00:39:41.810
but also we don't know much about the dog

668
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:45.169
side of that partnership. Um, WE know that dogs

669
00:39:45.169 --> 00:39:47.820
can be therapeutic and have a lot of um

670
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.889
beneficial outcomes for kids, and we also know that

671
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:56.000
the Likelihood of these benefits occurring may be contingent

672
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.989
on the level of social attachment, so how strong

673
00:39:58.989 --> 00:40:00.919
their social bond is between the child and the

674
00:40:00.919 --> 00:40:04.280
dog, um, but what we don't know is how

675
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.000
the dog is affected by all of this, so

676
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.639
we're gonna try to look and see um how

677
00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:13.350
the dog's brains may or may not have changed

678
00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:15.760
in response to this sort of bonding and in

679
00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.760
addition to the kids.

680
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:21.510
And so, and do you already have any hypothesis

681
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:24.669
on the table? I mean, do you expect, for

682
00:40:24.669 --> 00:40:28.719
example, for there to be changes in levels of,

683
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:33.179
of hormones like oxytocin, uh across species in this

684
00:40:33.179 --> 00:40:33.500
case?

685
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.199
Yeah, so we're planning to do a sort of

686
00:40:37.199 --> 00:40:41.360
behavioral task that actually started again um in the

687
00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.919
parent infant literature, but has since been modified for

688
00:40:44.919 --> 00:40:47.679
use with dogs, but it's called the strange situation

689
00:40:47.679 --> 00:40:51.929
test, so it's essentially a Test battery of different

690
00:40:51.929 --> 00:40:55.850
um conditions uh that are meant to induce some

691
00:40:55.850 --> 00:41:00.439
sort of stress like a separation from The social

692
00:41:00.439 --> 00:41:03.639
partner for a few minutes and then a reunion

693
00:41:03.639 --> 00:41:07.560
with the social partner and um introduction to a

694
00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:11.360
lesser known individual that might be stressful um and

695
00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.120
then a reunion again and so all of these

696
00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.959
different conditions. And the way that the dogs and

697
00:41:17.959 --> 00:41:20.409
the children respond to them can give us an

698
00:41:20.409 --> 00:41:24.000
idea of what the attachment looks like between the

699
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.149
dog and the child, and we can also Um,

700
00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.959
measure changes in hormone samples during certain conditions, like

701
00:41:31.959 --> 00:41:35.879
you mentioned, oxytocin. So, um, we might expect to

702
00:41:35.879 --> 00:41:40.389
see change elevated oxytocin, uh, after a reunion phase,

703
00:41:40.399 --> 00:41:43.750
for instance, um, and maybe a reduction in stress,

704
00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:47.199
so, uh, less cortisol after that point. So we're

705
00:41:47.199 --> 00:41:49.149
hoping to be able to measure those hormones during

706
00:41:49.149 --> 00:41:51.280
these interactions as well, yeah.

707
00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.850
Well, perhaps we'll learn more and have a better

708
00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:57.820
understanding of what our dogs go through when we

709
00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.419
leave them at home to go to work.

710
00:42:01.629 --> 00:42:02.879
Yes, perhaps.

711
00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.000
OK, so where can people find you and your

712
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.750
work on the internet if they are interested?

713
00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:15.810
Uh, YEAH, so I, I should have a website

714
00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:17.659
that is more formal, and I do not at

715
00:42:17.659 --> 00:42:21.159
the moment, but I'm working on that. But, um,

716
00:42:21.409 --> 00:42:23.729
right now I am a member of the evolutionary

717
00:42:23.729 --> 00:42:27.850
neuroscience lab in the human evolutionary biology department at

718
00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:30.850
Harvard, and so, um, if you check out that

719
00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:34.729
website in Dr. Erin Hecht's lab, um, you can

720
00:42:34.729 --> 00:42:38.010
find more information about my work and also that

721
00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:40.889
study um that we're working on right now, so.

722
00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:45.629
Um, AND I also have a an ex account

723
00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:50.620
Twitter. Um, THAT I, I try to keep updated,

724
00:42:50.699 --> 00:42:53.659
but yeah, so you can check out those spots

725
00:42:53.659 --> 00:42:54.899
for some more information.

726
00:42:55.419 --> 00:42:57.699
OK, so I'm leaving links to that in the

727
00:42:57.699 --> 00:43:00.820
