00:00:00.479 --> 00:00:03.359
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:06.679
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:10.430
today I'm joined by Doctor David Cooper. He's Emeritus

4
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.000
professor of philosophy at Durham University, and today we're

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.280
talking about his book, Pessimism, Quiettism, and Nature as

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.709
Refuge. So, Doctor Cooper, welcome to the show. It's

7
00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:23.799
a pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.780
Right, Paul, thank you very much for, for having

9
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.600
me on your show.

10
00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.810
OK, so let me ask you first, what is

11
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.889
misanthropy?

12
00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:40.000
Well, I think one needs to distinguish vernacular everyday

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.810
senses of misanthropy from, as it were, philosophical misanthropy.

14
00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:47.840
I mean, I take it that in the, Everyday

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.380
sense misanthropy is something like hatred of people or

16
00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:01.340
Scrooge-like meanness. Um, I take philosophical, uh, misanthropy to

17
00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:06.129
essentially be a, a, a, a negative judgment. On

18
00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:11.680
the human condition. Um, THE claim that human life

19
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.959
is, is saturated with failings and vices like hypocrisy,

20
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.550
cruelty, greed, vanity, uh, and so on. And I

21
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.269
think it's perhaps worth adding that I think the

22
00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:33.870
philosophical misanthrope's target is individual people. It's not a

23
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.550
claim about you or me being particularly awful. It's

24
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.660
a claim about something rather more abstract, the human

25
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.010
condition, the human form of life, human existence as

26
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.709
we now know it, something like that.

27
00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:53.889
Um, AND what is a pessimism?

28
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.180
Pessimism. Um, WELL, again, I think one needs to

29
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.180
distinguish sort of everyday senses of the term from

30
00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:06.900
its use in philosophical literature. And I take it

31
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.720
that in everyday discourse, a pessimist is somebody who,

32
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.100
I don't know, feels that things are going to

33
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.759
keep turning out badly. It's, it's gonna rain tomorrow

34
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.300
instead of being sunny, uh, during the, um, garden

35
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.300
party. Um Philosophical, um, um, pessimist, it seems to

36
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.479
me, is again making two judgments. Um, NEGATIVE judgments.

37
00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.039
I mean, first, that the human condition is a,

38
00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:45.759
a, a bad one in that suffering, unhappiness, anxiety,

39
00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:53.220
frustration, and so on, um, greatly outweigh their opposites.

40
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.389
And the second negative judgment is that, um, you

41
00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.470
know, it's just very unlikely that this condition can

42
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.149
be substantially or, or radically improved.

43
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.089
And how does pessimism then combine with misanthropy, and

44
00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:16.369
is there a specific kind of misanthropy that results

45
00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:17.410
from pessimism?

46
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.929
Well, I certainly don't think that pessimism and misanthropy,

47
00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:27.479
um, entail one another. You, you can be a

48
00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:35.020
pessimist without being a misanthrope, for example, um, Um,

49
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.750
you may think that our condition is, is a

50
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.429
very bad one. We suffer a lot, but this

51
00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.990
isn't our fault. I mean, it's, it's just bad

52
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.130
luck or, uh, it's the machinations of the devil

53
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.110
or, or whatever. Again, you could be, um, a

54
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.839
misanthrope without being a pessimist. Um, YOU might think

55
00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:02.800
that we're indeed pretty morally awful, but that salvation

56
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.039
is around the corner. Uh, THE communist revolution or

57
00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:10.679
the second coming of Christ or whatever, and everything

58
00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:14.539
will be fine. But you know, generally, it seems

59
00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:19.980
to me that pessimism and misanthropy are mutually supporting.

60
00:04:21.369 --> 00:04:26.929
Um, I mean, if, if, if the pessimist, um,

61
00:04:27.859 --> 00:04:34.760
Yeah. If the pessimist is right and life is

62
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.750
largely suffering, Um, then this is liable to exacerbate

63
00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:46.130
the very failings and vices that the misanthrope identifies.

64
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.179
And then conversely, if we're so full of failings

65
00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:55.019
and vices as the misanthrope claims, uh then we

66
00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:59.959
don't have the moral resources uh to really improve

67
00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:05.220
the human condition. Um, SO it's plausible, I think,

68
00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:07.670
to think that they're, they're going to go together

69
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.899
in a, a mutually supportive way. Um, AND then,

70
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.709
sorry, the second half of your question was, uh,

71
00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:18.429
I mean, I think that you've ended up already

72
00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:21.630
answering it at least in part, it was if

73
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.010
there's a specific kind of misanthropy that results from

74
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.869
pessimism.

75
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.290
Yes, I mean, I mean, I certainly think that

76
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.809
the, the, the, the, the kind, the basis of

77
00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:40.369
your pessimistic view. Uh, IS going to affect the

78
00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:44.660
form that your misanthropy takes. I mean, for example,

79
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.049
um, a very important example, um, it seems to

80
00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:51.250
me that for the Buddha and for Schopenhauer, for

81
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.250
example, um, our condition of suffering is, is, is

82
00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.410
primarily the product of our being creatures of, as

83
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:07.149
it were, insatiable desires. And it's these desires in

84
00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:12.989
the form of greed, overweening ambition, jealousy, and so

85
00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:15.179
on, uh, that are going to be at the

86
00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:19.149
root of our failings and vices on, on one

87
00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:20.709
version of misanthropy.

88
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.260
Right, and how would you characterize the human condition?

89
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.390
Well, I think in the way that the pessimist

90
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.470
and the misanthrope do. I mean that, um, you

91
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.589
know, on balance, our condition is an unhappy one,

92
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:46.489
that is both fed by and feeds into humankind's

93
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.630
very deeply entrenched failures and vices, um.

94
00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:58.619
Uh, AND do you think it's really impossible to

95
00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:01.220
ameliorate the human condition?

96
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.480
Well, yes, I'm afraid I do in any kind

97
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.279
of really substantial radical way. And that's because as

98
00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:16.519
I see it, the, you know, our failings are

99
00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:21.399
really very deeply entrenched. They're not the product of

100
00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:27.299
passing social, political, or economic conditions that, that might

101
00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:32.420
be reformed. I mean, if the human condition is

102
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.380
radically to improve, it seems to me that in

103
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.250
effect, it will no longer be the human condition

104
00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:43.140
at all. It would be the condition of creatures

105
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.500
like us in some ways, but no longer with

106
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:54.059
our structures of desires, ambitions, and sort of self-obsession.

107
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:55.720
Mhm.

108
00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:58.640
Yes, I was asking you that because there is

109
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.519
a specific kind of misanthrope, that is the activist

110
00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:06.320
misanthrope who at least to a certain extent, believes

111
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.519
that we can ameliorate humankind. Correct.

112
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.339
Yeah, um, well, I, I mean, my reply, I

113
00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:19.540
think is that, you know, the amelioration is going

114
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.420
to be very limited. I mean, of course, one

115
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:30.700
can and indeed should intervene. With modesty, I think,

116
00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:35.590
and usually locally and on a small scale, intervene

117
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:40.669
to improve people's lives, and perhaps to help redress

118
00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.489
some of their failings, but I do think it's

119
00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:48.539
unrealistic. To suppose that can be any grand scale

120
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.280
amelioration of the human condition as dreamt of by

121
00:08:54.099 --> 00:09:00.260
uh communist revolutionaries, various kinds of theocrats, and so

122
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.109
on. I mean, the, the evidence of history is

123
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:08.599
not supportive, I think of such huge large scale,

124
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:13.469
as it were utopian uh ambitions. They seem to

125
00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:17.630
me to lack realism. Uh, THEY also, I think,

126
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:23.270
just ignore, you know, the, the really basic elements

127
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.590
and aspects of human suffering, which I don't think

128
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:31.700
are going to be changed by political, economic revolutions.

129
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.859
I mean, the pains and anxieties and suffering of

130
00:09:35.859 --> 00:09:40.390
old age, of various kinds of addictions, and so

131
00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:45.909
on. No, sorry, no,

132
00:09:45.989 --> 00:09:47.650
yeah, go, go, go ahead, sorry.

133
00:09:48.479 --> 00:09:50.030
No, so, so, so I was just gonna sort

134
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.359
of briefly sum up and say that I think

135
00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:59.599
the prospects for big cause activism, uh, are limited.

136
00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:03.669
There's a lack of realism here. Mhm.

137
00:10:04.099 --> 00:10:09.260
And how should one respond to one's negative assessment

138
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.700
of the human condition? I mean, what should we

139
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:12.979
do?

140
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.659
Well, I think, you know, unless you take to,

141
00:10:19.799 --> 00:10:23.820
to drinking or, or drugs or whatever to blot

142
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.549
out and forget your, your negative assessment of the

143
00:10:28.549 --> 00:10:32.809
human condition. Um, YOU know, this assessment is bound

144
00:10:32.809 --> 00:10:35.530
to produce, I think what I call in the

145
00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:41.890
book disquiet, um, perhaps depression, even despair, frustration, and

146
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.330
so on. And that's an unhappy state to be

147
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.729
in. Uh, SO one should ask oneself, you know,

148
00:10:49.809 --> 00:10:54.390
how one might live. In order to accommodate or

149
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.520
perhaps mitigate such disquiet, whether by say dropping out,

150
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:08.960
through militant activism or, or what, um, Um, And

151
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.880
you know, my answer is that uh one should

152
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.840
respond to one's assessment of the condition through a

153
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.520
certain, as it were, quietistic style of life and

154
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.179
attitude.

155
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.080
OK, but uh, what is quietism then and philosophical

156
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.280
quietism more specifically?

157
00:11:35.469 --> 00:11:38.349
Well, I think, you know, the term quietism has

158
00:11:38.349 --> 00:11:41.289
been used to refer to a number of different

159
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.130
As it were attitudes or or or styles of

160
00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.330
life, um. But I think probably what all of

161
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
these have in common is something like the, the

162
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.210
following features. First, I think a, a kind of

163
00:11:56.210 --> 00:12:03.320
realistic acceptance of things. Accompanied therefore by a kind

164
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:09.280
of humility or modesty, uh concerning your prospects or

165
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:16.280
capacity, uh radically to change things. And this accompanied

166
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:23.700
with a kind of prising of tranquility, equanimity, and

167
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:29.400
various, one might call them quiet virtues like patience

168
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.289
and, and care. I, I think, um, you know,

169
00:12:33.349 --> 00:12:40.469
those features are probably common to, What one Regards

170
00:12:40.469 --> 00:12:47.099
the quietest approach to things. Um, PHILOSOPHICAL quietism, and

171
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.250
I think the term's a bit ambiguous. Um. If

172
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:56.609
you Google philosophical quietism, you get an account of

173
00:12:56.609 --> 00:13:02.539
the philosophy of the later Wittgenstein. Uh, BECAUSE, um,

174
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.729
you know, I think in the 1990s, the term,

175
00:13:05.739 --> 00:13:12.500
um, um, Wittgensteinian quietism was coined to refer to

176
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:17.940
a certain, as it were style of philosophizing associated

177
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.219
allegedly with the later Wittgenstein. So, you know, on,

178
00:13:22.429 --> 00:13:26.270
on, on, on this view, um, the job of

179
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:34.210
philosophy is not to answer questions by producing theories.

180
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.429
Uh, IT'S to recognize that the questions are in

181
00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:42.109
some sense unreal. That they're, you only ask them

182
00:13:42.109 --> 00:13:46.119
because you're confused. And that therefore the philosopher's job

183
00:13:46.119 --> 00:13:51.799
is to dissolve these questions and with that dissolution

184
00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:55.599
comes, as it were, a certain tranquility. It, it

185
00:13:55.599 --> 00:14:01.229
brings peace, as Wittgenstein put it. I think very

186
00:14:01.229 --> 00:14:04.630
important too, while we're on Wittgenstein is, you know,

187
00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:08.710
another strand in his thinking, very apparent in his

188
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:11.869
book on Certainty, um, and this is the idea

189
00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:14.190
that there's a lot of things we just have

190
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.260
to accept. We can't question them because they're the

191
00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.789
very basis for anything that we can question and

192
00:14:22.789 --> 00:14:26.989
think about. So you can't sensibly question, for example,

193
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:31.609
the claim that um, The world's existed for more

194
00:14:31.609 --> 00:14:35.849
than 5 minutes, because you know that the world

195
00:14:35.849 --> 00:14:39.500
has existed for more than 5 minutes, is, is

196
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:44.210
presupposed by just about everything we think and talk

197
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:49.429
about. But I think philosophical quietism, um, you know,

198
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:54.070
can mean things other than, uh, Wittgen Stein, an

199
00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:57.989
approach to philosophy. Um, I mean, for example, um,

200
00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:03.549
You have the idea, say, amongst the Epicureans. That

201
00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:10.510
philosophy is a very important part of. The quietest

202
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:15.909
life. You should live quietistically, very modestly, without too

203
00:15:15.909 --> 00:15:20.929
many ambitions. But part and parcel of that involves

204
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:26.919
philosophical reflection. For example, philosophical reflection will show you

205
00:15:26.919 --> 00:15:32.010
that death is not very important, and that helps

206
00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:38.979
you live um more tranquilly and. Um, SO yeah.

207
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.739
So they they're these senses of, I think, philosophical

208
00:15:44.739 --> 00:15:45.700
quietism.

209
00:15:46.549 --> 00:15:51.460
Right, and tell us about how it draws from

210
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:55.840
Buddhist and Taoist ideas as well as those from

211
00:15:56.179 --> 00:15:57.659
Western philosophy.

212
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.570
Right, I, I mean, I think that the ideas

213
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:07.849
I take or borrow from Buddhism and Taoism are

214
00:16:07.849 --> 00:16:13.190
actually very much shared by many ancient Western philosophers.

215
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:20.119
Epicurus, the Stoics, for example. Um, ALL of them,

216
00:16:20.239 --> 00:16:29.059
for example, emphasize self-restraint, moderation, tranquility, and the like.

217
00:16:30.099 --> 00:16:31.690
But yeah, I, I mean, I think there are

218
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:39.299
some ideas from Buddhism and Taoism respectively that very

219
00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:43.299
characteristic of them that I draw on. And I

220
00:16:43.299 --> 00:16:46.940
think from Buddhism, um, you know, I draw the

221
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:54.739
idea that generally we massively exaggerate the degree to

222
00:16:54.739 --> 00:16:57.890
which we are, as it were masters of our

223
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:04.930
own lives, that we're self-governing. We ignore that is

224
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:15.739
ours, our susceptibility to chance, change, contingency. Um, FACTORS

225
00:17:15.739 --> 00:17:18.579
outside of our control. I mean, I think the

226
00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:22.939
famous Buddhist doctrine of not self, you know, is

227
00:17:22.939 --> 00:17:27.819
really best understood as a denial that we're, as

228
00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:33.050
it were, masters of ourselves. And this idea I

229
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:37.800
think promotes a certain humility and a reluctance to,

230
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.630
as it were, commit oneself too heavily to long-term

231
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:47.410
ambitions, because they're very likely to fail and result

232
00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:53.640
in disappointment and suffering. Um, FROM Taoism, I, you

233
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.770
know, I take the, um, very central Taoist, um,

234
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.880
idea or indeed ideal of, um, you know, what

235
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.040
they call wuwei, which literally means I think not

236
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.400
doing. But of course, you know, Chuanger and other

237
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.160
Taoist sages, um, you know, they're not advocating that

238
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:20.099
we become couch potatoes and never do anything, just

239
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:25.140
sit around. Um, I mean, what they're advocating is

240
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.910
a certain style, I think, of acting. One that's

241
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:38.369
found amongst very skilled craftsmen, adept swimmers, good musicians.

242
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:48.530
And this is a kind of non-contending, non-rigid. Non-impositional

243
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:54.959
style of action, one that's supple, responsive, involves spontaneity,

244
00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.849
maybe, you know, in modern terminology goes with the

245
00:18:58.849 --> 00:19:04.979
flow, and I think this, this idea, we indicates

246
00:19:04.979 --> 00:19:09.859
an important dimension, uh, of the quietest life.

247
00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:15.369
Do you think that quietism can be a form

248
00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:16.630
of egoism?

249
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.449
Well, I think it could be. I mean, you

250
00:19:22.449 --> 00:19:26.150
know, I noted earlier, a rather pejorative sense of

251
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:30.160
quietism, where, you know, the quietest is somebody who's

252
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.969
just indifferent to everything except presumably, um, um, his

253
00:19:34.969 --> 00:19:40.380
own well-being. Um, BUT I think the quietest of

254
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.979
the kind I've been describing, uh, you know, is

255
00:19:43.979 --> 00:19:49.540
not at all an egoist. Um, THE quietest I've

256
00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:54.219
been describing is concerned to avoid the failings and

257
00:19:54.219 --> 00:20:00.060
vices identified by the misanthrope and to exercise various

258
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:09.890
virtues like humility, self-honesty, compassion. And It keen to

259
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:14.650
engage and as it was suitably modest local endeavors

260
00:20:14.969 --> 00:20:18.410
to help other people, perhaps help them redress their

261
00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.130
failings. You know, I mean, you know, the quietest

262
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:26.209
probably won't be found marching on a just stop

263
00:20:26.209 --> 00:20:31.010
oil march. More likely to be cleaning up the

264
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:35.699
local river. And in so doing, it seems to

265
00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:41.739
me contributing to um people's well-being rather more uh

266
00:20:41.739 --> 00:20:46.540
than marching down the street. Um, AFTER all, you

267
00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.739
know, you only have so many hours in the

268
00:20:48.739 --> 00:20:52.219
day, and I think you can contribute more to

269
00:20:52.219 --> 00:20:57.300
human well-being by cleaning up the local river, helping

270
00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:01.349
your neighbor who's in trouble, volunteering for a local

271
00:21:01.349 --> 00:21:05.510
animal charity. You can do considerably more that way

272
00:21:05.859 --> 00:21:12.329
by waving flags on big cause demonstrations. Sorry I,

273
00:21:14.189 --> 00:21:16.349
sorry, can I just say one little thing? I,

274
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:20.000
I do think it's a bad mistake. Uh, TO

275
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.800
think that because the question that the quietest asks.

276
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:32.969
That because that's a personal self-directed question, you know,

277
00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:37.209
how can I best conduct my life? It's a,

278
00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.760
it's a mistake to think that the answer to

279
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.089
that question has to be in terms of one's

280
00:21:44.089 --> 00:21:49.109
personal self advantage at the expense of other people

281
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.500
and other creatures. That's just an error of logic,

282
00:21:52.609 --> 00:21:53.170
I think.

283
00:21:55.449 --> 00:21:59.510
Right, and what does quietism entail in terms of

284
00:21:59.849 --> 00:22:03.560
how we live our lives? How should the quietest

285
00:22:04.209 --> 00:22:06.589
live, uh, his life?

286
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.930
Well, I don't think the quietest advocates, you know,

287
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:16.199
in detail, any particular way you should live. He

288
00:22:16.199 --> 00:22:19.489
doesn't, for example, tell you that you should go

289
00:22:19.489 --> 00:22:22.530
in for this sort of career rather than that,

290
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.689
although there's probably some careers he'd advise you to

291
00:22:26.689 --> 00:22:32.030
avoid. Um, I mean, what's advocated, I think, is

292
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.979
the kind of more general style of living and

293
00:22:35.979 --> 00:22:39.949
attitude that I tried to describe a little earlier.

294
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:46.319
One thing I think that quietest authors sometimes, and

295
00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:50.209
I think it's a good thing. Uh, DO, um,

296
00:22:50.959 --> 00:22:54.380
is to, you know, point to exemplars, if you

297
00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:59.750
like, moral exemplars. The Buddha, say, or the Taoist

298
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:05.150
sage or Montaign perhaps, and say, well, look, you

299
00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:09.170
know, um, that's a pretty good life, it seems

300
00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.810
to me, um, look at it and see what

301
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:15.150
you might be able to take from it and

302
00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.589
incorporate into your own life.

303
00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:24.109
So to refer to the title of your book,

304
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.390
what is a place of refuge?

305
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:35.000
Well, I use the word place here figuratively or,

306
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:43.390
or, or metaphorically, um. You know, Buddhists take refuge,

307
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:47.430
as it said, in the Buddha and his teachings

308
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.949
and the community of monks. Well, clearly that's not

309
00:23:50.949 --> 00:23:59.689
a place. Um Um, AND I think even when

310
00:23:59.689 --> 00:24:05.000
there is a literal physical place, a monastery, for

311
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.569
example, that you take refuge in, it's not the

312
00:24:08.569 --> 00:24:13.489
physical place itself that's the refuge, but so to

313
00:24:13.489 --> 00:24:20.510
speak, the kind of context it provides. And so

314
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:24.630
by a refuge, I mean something like, you know,

315
00:24:24.709 --> 00:24:31.310
a context apart from, aside from the all too

316
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:38.030
human world of busyness, ambitions, prejudices, jealousies, and so

317
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:44.390
on. A context that offers some relief, temporarily at

318
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:49.319
least. Uh, FROM disquiet, as I called it.

319
00:24:52.089 --> 00:24:55.930
About the idea of nature as refuge, why do

320
00:24:55.930 --> 00:25:01.380
you suggest finding places of refuge in natural environments?

321
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.560
Well, I think if you look at the sort

322
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:11.359
of literature on, on refuge, um, there are many

323
00:25:11.359 --> 00:25:16.920
possible places or contexts, uh, that get mentioned, for

324
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:24.109
example, music, art, hermit's cave, monasteries, and so on

325
00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:29.530
can all be regarded as refuges from. The all

326
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.410
too human world, but I think the one that

327
00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:35.170
is most frequently discussed, and that's one reason I

328
00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:40.770
discuss it, is, you know, nature is refuge. And

329
00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.849
it happens to be the one I think that

330
00:25:42.849 --> 00:25:48.430
um. You know, resonates with me personally most, though

331
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.130
I think music probably comes a close second.

332
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:59.640
Why is nature a quote unquote, another place? What

333
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.099
is another place?

334
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.760
I think what I meant by this was something

335
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.859
like the following, um, as it were, the world

336
00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:13.630
of nature is another place from the human world.

337
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:20.869
Because our understanding and experience of it isn't tied.

338
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:27.010
To the utility and functions that things have for

339
00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:30.479
us. Which of course is the case, I think

340
00:26:30.479 --> 00:26:35.040
in the human world of artifacts, buildings, and so

341
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.640
on. I mean, you know, just look around you

342
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.550
now, the laptop in front of you, a coffee

343
00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:45.839
cup, perhaps, a carpet, uh, a window frame, you

344
00:26:45.839 --> 00:26:48.939
know, all of these things are understood in terms

345
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:54.040
of utility and functions in relation to sort of

346
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:59.449
human aims and goals. Whereas it's not like that,

347
00:26:59.709 --> 00:27:04.270
uh, with nature. We don't, when we are in

348
00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:09.829
natural surroundings, experience everything as you know what Heidegger

349
00:27:09.829 --> 00:27:16.550
called um equipment. Um, Um, MAYBE perhaps one could

350
00:27:17.209 --> 00:27:19.650
add this too, I think there's perhaps another sense

351
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.650
in which people speak of nature as being other,

352
00:27:23.849 --> 00:27:29.109
namely that it's, Nature for many people retains a

353
00:27:29.109 --> 00:27:35.109
certain kind of sort of mystery and unfathomableness. It's

354
00:27:35.109 --> 00:27:39.469
a place of wonder for many people. And that

355
00:27:39.469 --> 00:27:42.989
makes it very different from the human world, I

356
00:27:42.989 --> 00:27:49.109
think, which um doesn't attract, uh, uh, such attitudes.

357
00:27:49.189 --> 00:27:51.349
I mean, I don't think. Things in the human

358
00:27:51.349 --> 00:27:53.989
world are full of mystery, I mean I may

359
00:27:53.989 --> 00:27:57.949
not understand how computers work, but, but I could

360
00:27:57.949 --> 00:28:00.829
probably find out if I read up on it

361
00:28:00.829 --> 00:28:04.069
and ask an expert, whereas I think the kind

362
00:28:04.069 --> 00:28:09.479
of mystery that people associate with nature, Isn't of

363
00:28:09.479 --> 00:28:13.020
that kind, you can't, you can't solve it by

364
00:28:13.189 --> 00:28:15.780
uh reading up or asking some expert.

365
00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:22.739
And what do we gain from refuging in nature?

366
00:28:22.859 --> 00:28:25.280
What effects does it have on us?

367
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:33.109
Um, Well, I hope, um, this is the idea

368
00:28:33.109 --> 00:28:37.510
that um that you gain relief. If only temporarily

369
00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:42.510
from, from disquiet, a sense of emancipation or or

370
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:47.680
liberation from the all too human world. As well,

371
00:28:47.709 --> 00:28:51.069
of course, as experiencing a great deal of um

372
00:28:51.079 --> 00:28:55.390
um beauty, and if you like wonder. So, so

373
00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:57.810
that's quite a lot, I think to get, um,

374
00:28:58.229 --> 00:29:02.390
or gain. Um, I mean, I mean, also, it's

375
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:06.209
worth mentioning, um, I haven't thought about this one

376
00:29:06.209 --> 00:29:09.729
too much, but there's now a huge literature on

377
00:29:09.729 --> 00:29:14.560
and a big industry of, you know, nature therapy,

378
00:29:14.689 --> 00:29:21.060
nature cures. Such as forest bathing or wild swimming.

379
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.869
Um, THERAPIES that are intended to promote benefits of,

380
00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.719
um, health and, and wellness, uh, through engagement with

381
00:29:30.719 --> 00:29:34.819
nature and, You know, I'm, I'm sure there are

382
00:29:34.819 --> 00:29:39.800
such physical and mental health benefits, but I think

383
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.560
one's also got to be alert to certain dangers

384
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:49.780
in this therapeutic emphasis on turning to nature. It's

385
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.579
the danger, isn't it, of, as it were, turning

386
00:29:52.579 --> 00:29:56.540
nature into a kind of commodity, um, as a

387
00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:01.880
kind of outdoor gymnasium, and thereby bringing it into,

388
00:30:02.349 --> 00:30:05.829
Uh, the world of equipment, you are as we're

389
00:30:05.829 --> 00:30:10.670
now sucking the natural world into the very human

390
00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:13.699
world, uh, from which you were, as it were,

391
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:17.750
seeking refuge. So I'm a bit ambivalent about at

392
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:21.729
least some forms of sort of nature therapy.

393
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:28.869
Can a refuge in nature only be sought by

394
00:30:28.869 --> 00:30:33.510
individuals, or can society itself do it?

395
00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.650
Well, I think there'd be something a bit strange

396
00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:43.040
in the idea of a Of a society seeking

397
00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.300
refuge in nature. Because I think that'd be sort

398
00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.880
of, as it were, seeking refuge from itself. Um

399
00:30:52.699 --> 00:30:58.329
um. What what I take it is possible, uh,

400
00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:06.969
you know, communal and political. Initiatives to promote the

401
00:31:06.969 --> 00:31:13.329
idea of And to provide opportunities for finding refuge

402
00:31:13.329 --> 00:31:18.449
in nature, for example, protection of wild areas, support

403
00:31:18.449 --> 00:31:24.449
for allotments, garden allotments in in cities, cleaning up

404
00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:27.650
rivers and so on. But I suppose I would

405
00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:31.650
add, being a pessimist, you know, just don't expect

406
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:36.310
too much here, and one fears that economic imperatives

407
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:41.969
are, are liable to prevail over even well-intentioned, uh,

408
00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:46.400
political communal initiatives. Mhm

409
00:31:47.459 --> 00:31:51.459
Do you think that the refuge in nature also

410
00:31:51.459 --> 00:31:55.939
connect to a desire to preserve the natural world

411
00:31:55.939 --> 00:31:57.739
from human activity?

412
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:04.410
Well, I think it'd be strange for someone who,

413
00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:07.170
who, as it were, finds or at any rate

414
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:10.969
looks for refuge in nature, um, you know, to

415
00:32:10.969 --> 00:32:17.209
be indifferent to say deforestation or loss of animal

416
00:32:17.209 --> 00:32:21.780
habitats and so on. But I think it's an

417
00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.739
important point to make here. I mean, I don't

418
00:32:23.739 --> 00:32:30.339
think nature should be equated with wilderness. The natural.

419
00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:35.810
Is around us or pretty close to us, uh

420
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:39.550
most of the time. I mean, even in cities,

421
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:45.089
uh, you know, you've got parks, gardens, allotments and

422
00:32:45.089 --> 00:32:50.349
so on where natural processes, nature if you like,

423
00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:57.790
is, uh, um, at work. And So while I

424
00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:01.569
think, you know, the person seeking refuge in nature

425
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:03.979
is of course going to want to see wildness

426
00:33:05.229 --> 00:33:08.949
preserved as well, um, I think he's also going

427
00:33:08.949 --> 00:33:12.449
to be emphasized, look, you know, you can find

428
00:33:12.449 --> 00:33:16.969
the natural going on all over the place. Uh,

429
00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:20.209
YOU know, in your garden and so on and

430
00:33:20.609 --> 00:33:23.969
focus perhaps on, on that. Not all of us

431
00:33:23.969 --> 00:33:28.609
after all can afford, afford flights to, um, remote

432
00:33:28.609 --> 00:33:32.829
parts of Alaska or somewhere. So, you know, get

433
00:33:32.829 --> 00:33:35.089
as much as you can out of, you know.

434
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.819
Contact with nature in in in your local park.

435
00:33:40.589 --> 00:33:41.219
Um.

436
00:33:43.979 --> 00:33:48.290
Right, so I have one last question then. Do

437
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:54.329
you think that through quietism there's a risk of

438
00:33:54.329 --> 00:33:57.459
falling into the feelings that lead to the very

439
00:33:57.459 --> 00:34:00.770
same condition we are refuging from?

440
00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:06.569
Uh, YES, I mean, I think. You wouldn't be

441
00:34:06.569 --> 00:34:10.050
a good pessimist or misanthropist if you didn't think

442
00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:13.409
there was such a risk, I think. Um, I

443
00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:17.268
mean, there is the danger, I think, that The

444
00:34:17.268 --> 00:34:22.549
ambitions, jealousies, vanities, and so on that permeate the

445
00:34:22.549 --> 00:34:28.029
human world, the everyday world of human existence, that

446
00:34:28.029 --> 00:34:32.268
these can, as it were, get transported uh into

447
00:34:32.268 --> 00:34:36.830
people's dealings with nature. And I think one sees

448
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:41.370
this even in a small way with very competitive

449
00:34:41.688 --> 00:34:44.989
bird watching, um, where one gets the feeling the

450
00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:47.830
important thing is not the birds, but how many

451
00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:51.858
you've seen and whether you win a prize. Or

452
00:34:51.858 --> 00:34:55.839
ecotourism, I think a lot of eco-tourism may be

453
00:34:55.839 --> 00:35:00.218
permeated by these kind of vices. So, you know,

454
00:35:00.539 --> 00:35:04.299
who's seen the most lions on, on, uh, your

455
00:35:04.299 --> 00:35:07.718
safari holiday, and how many hours did it take

456
00:35:07.718 --> 00:35:11.739
you to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and, and so on.

457
00:35:13.199 --> 00:35:16.939
Um, AND, it's just not easy, it seems to

458
00:35:16.939 --> 00:35:20.570
me. Um, HOW could a pessimist or a misanthrope

459
00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:23.570
think it was easy? It's not easy to leave

460
00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:28.870
behind the, the failings that infect our everyday lives

461
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:33.760
when engaging with the natural world, um. After all,

462
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.919
it's worth mentioning, isn't it, that for unfortunately, for

463
00:35:37.919 --> 00:35:41.120
a very large number of people, their favorite way

464
00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:45.120
of engaging with nature is by uh um killing

465
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:50.840
things. Shooting, fishing, trapping, uh, whatever it happens to

466
00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.169
be. Mhm.

467
00:35:53.969 --> 00:35:59.000
OK, great. So the book is again Pessimism, Quietism,

468
00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.719
and Nature as Refuge. I am leaving a link
