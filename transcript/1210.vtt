00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:02.900
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.829
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricard Lops, and

3
00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:09.449
today I'm joined by Doctor Christina Bichierri. She's, she's

4
00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.420
SJ Patterson, Harvey Professor of Social Thought and Comparative

5
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.989
Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania. And today we're

6
00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:20.389
going to talk about social norms from the perspective

7
00:00:20.389 --> 00:00:24.590
of game theory, how to foster social change, and

8
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.110
some other related topics. So, Doctor Bichiri, welcome to

9
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.750
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:31.239
Thank you.

11
00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.729
So, before getting into details here, first of all,

12
00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:41.049
what are social norms? How do you approach them

13
00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.250
in

14
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.569
your

15
00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.849
work?

16
00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:46.959
OK, good question. Uh, IF you look, uh, you

17
00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:51.599
know, at various definition in the social sciences, um,

18
00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.790
which I did when I started getting interested in,

19
00:00:55.959 --> 00:01:01.240
you know, uh, defining social norms, uh, you find

20
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:09.059
a variety of definition from common behavior, OK, to,

21
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.290
uh, Uh, clusters of expectations, etc. And uh, what

22
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.720
I decided to do and is clear in my

23
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.540
2006 book, The Grammar of Society, where I give

24
00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:27.919
what I think is an important and measurable definition

25
00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:32.500
because measurement is very important, is a social norm,

26
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.830
uh, is, uh, basically A behavioral rule, OK, that

27
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:47.230
is supported by a social norm, right? By two

28
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.790
types of social expectation. On the one hand, we

29
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.309
have what I call empirical expectations. I, people believe

30
00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:03.550
that other people that matter to them follow that

31
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.669
particular rule. When I say other people that matter

32
00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:10.149
to them, I say something very important because very

33
00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.970
often is left really in the vague, you know,

34
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.309
you know, uh, expectation about who and it's very

35
00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:27.470
important, especially measurement to define very, very specifically what

36
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.970
I call the reference network, OK, I, the people

37
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.119
that matter to me. Their behavior matter to me.

38
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.820
It's not everybody in the world, but is maybe

39
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.009
specific people, specific populations, specific groups, and so on

40
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.119
and so forth. So the first type of expectation

41
00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.080
is what I call empirical expectation, how do these

42
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.630
people behave in a set of particular circumstances. The

43
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.820
second very important expectation, what I call normative expectation,

44
00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:06.350
that is what we believe are the normative beliefs,

45
00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.350
OK, of the people that matter to us in

46
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.330
this particular circumstance and case. So, it's a second

47
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.589
order belief. What do I believe that they think

48
00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:22.919
is acceptable, that they think is right to do,

49
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.970
that they think is wrong to do, that they

50
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.610
would punish or they would really ostracize us if

51
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.529
we don't do that, etc. ETC. So there are

52
00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.970
these two components in social norm, the empirical and

53
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.729
the normative, and basically the Social expectation that support

54
00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:47.779
the social norm are both empirical and normative. Now,

55
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.449
it is also very important to realize that we

56
00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:52.929
can have all the expectation in the world and

57
00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:58.070
do nothing. You know, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, people,

58
00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.949
people pay their taxes, sure, and people think it's

59
00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:06.389
all right, sure, but I will not, OK. And

60
00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.229
so for a social norm to exist, it's very

61
00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:15.270
important that this expectation have a causal influence on

62
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.289
behavior. I, I, I define it by saying that

63
00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.248
my preference for behaving one way or another is

64
00:04:25.248 --> 00:04:32.450
conditional on this expectation. So there are expectation. And

65
00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:38.299
preference conditional on this expectation. Without all these components,

66
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.250
you don't have a social norm. Now, it's very

67
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.890
important that you may tell me, hey, wait a

68
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.489
moment, but there are norms that don't include normative

69
00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:55.410
expectation. Yes, and I call them descriptive norms, like

70
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.910
convention, you know, how to dress at a party.

71
00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:02.464
YOU know, where to put the fork when you

72
00:05:02.464 --> 00:05:07.505
eat, etc. ETC. ARE all behavior that very much

73
00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:11.464
depend on my expectations by belief of what other

74
00:05:11.464 --> 00:05:15.265
people do, but there is no normative component. Typically,

75
00:05:15.424 --> 00:05:22.804
norms emerge when there is a conflict between my

76
00:05:22.975 --> 00:05:28.100
personal welfare. And the collective welfare. We have social

77
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.339
norms. They emerge exactly to, uh, you know, bring

78
00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:36.239
to a close in some sense this conflict.

79
00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:41.260
Mhm. But then why are social norms important? I

80
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.899
mean, what roles do they play in human societies?

81
00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:51.720
Well, Crucial. Uh, WHEN we think of important things

82
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.119
like coordination, cooperation, uh, you know, having a society

83
00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:04.019
at all, you know, social norms are these coordinating

84
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.779
devices. OK. They are, if you want to use

85
00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:14.399
a game theoretic word, they are equilibria. OK, in

86
00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:17.350
society, what does it mean that they are equilibrium?

87
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:25.390
It means that our expectations, OK, are correct because

88
00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.989
behind the Nash equilibrium there are correct expectations and

89
00:06:27.989 --> 00:06:32.679
our expectations are correct, which means that they are

90
00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:37.880
consistent and they turn out to be right. OK,

91
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.630
this is very, very important. So in society, coordinating

92
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.790
activities, basically knowing what to do in a variety

93
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.670
of situations, knowing what it's OK to do and

94
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.630
what's not OK to do is crucial. It's crucial

95
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.910
to social life. Think of the chaos we would

96
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:05.239
live in if this didn't happen. And think of,

97
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.459
of something else. Think of you being a foreigner

98
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.200
and going in different countries where you don't know

99
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.420
the rules and think of the anxiety and confusion

100
00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:24.859
and difficulty that you encounter. And think of a

101
00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:28.959
place without rules, without norms, you will have, you

102
00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:33.440
know, it will be basically maybe. Uh, uh, HOMO

103
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.220
homini lupus like Hobbes described the state of nature.

104
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.089
It would be like a state of nature. Mhm.

105
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.100
Yeah, yeah, right, I mean, I would imagine that

106
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.260
would be certainly the case. So, I mean, one

107
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.459
thing that, uh, I find really interesting when thinking

108
00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:56.339
about social norms is about how, uh, they seem

109
00:07:56.339 --> 00:08:00.790
to be. STABLE sometimes, other times they change, and

110
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.769
sometimes they even seem to change very quickly. So

111
00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:07.070
how do you approach those aspects of social norms?

112
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:10.269
So for example, tell us first about what is

113
00:08:10.269 --> 00:08:14.910
norm strength and norm stability. Tell us about these

114
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.649
two concepts and how they affect norm change.

115
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.269
Yeah, this is a very important, uh, uh, important

116
00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:29.619
ideas now. Uh, NORM strength typically measured the status

117
00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:33.489
quo. You ask, is this norm that exists strong,

118
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.320
and I can give you a definition of strength,

119
00:08:36.859 --> 00:08:41.780
but before that, I want to separate stability. Stability

120
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.280
is a measure of dynamics. So one is a

121
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.479
static, the other is a dynamic. Often people confuse

122
00:08:49.479 --> 00:08:52.280
the two, they should never be confused. There are

123
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:57.760
lots of common elements but also differences. Now, uh,

124
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.929
what do I mean when I say enormous strong?

125
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.640
There are 3 elements. One is that social expectations

126
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:12.200
are consistent. So our social expectations are not different

127
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.059
from the social expectation of other people. There is

128
00:09:15.059 --> 00:09:22.580
internal consistency. Second, they are accurate. So our expectation

129
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.859
predict behavior. Indeed, OK, so there is accuracy of

130
00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:31.559
expectation, not only behavior, but we all also predict

131
00:09:31.739 --> 00:09:36.559
the normative beliefs of other people. So, We more

132
00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:40.520
or less well understand what people accept or reject,

133
00:09:40.659 --> 00:09:44.719
what people like or dislike, uh, uh, in, in

134
00:09:44.719 --> 00:09:48.359
the normative sense. The third element, so there is

135
00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:53.380
consistency, accuracy, but also specificity. What does it mean?

136
00:09:54.429 --> 00:10:00.030
It means that a norm is not usually just

137
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:04.219
one thing. That is usually a small set of

138
00:10:04.219 --> 00:10:09.780
acceptable behaviors. Think of fairness. Fairness can mean, may

139
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.179
mean different things, but we sort of accept in

140
00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:18.340
different situations what fairness may mean. So give more

141
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.719
to the needy person. Or give more to the

142
00:10:21.719 --> 00:10:28.200
meritorious person or give equally and merit need equality,

143
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.440
you know, have not to be in conflict, but

144
00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:37.950
in certain situation with privilege, fairness. MERIT versus other

145
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.710
fairness as needed, etc. So, specific city, uh, which

146
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.710
is part of our strength, means collective agreement over

147
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:52.239
a set of acceptable behaviors, OK? So, The question

148
00:10:52.239 --> 00:10:56.549
is, how many behaviors instantiate the norm and usually,

149
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:02.760
you know, is a relatively uh minor set, basically,

150
00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:09.599
but is usually collectively accepted. And we see that

151
00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:14.400
when we do experimental work. Think of trust games.

152
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.950
In trust game we measure trust and we measure

153
00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:22.830
reciprocity and trust just means, uh, you know, I

154
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:28.390
give you, let's say $4 and you decide how

155
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:33.789
much of $4 you give to an anonymous responder.

156
00:11:34.349 --> 00:11:38.469
And the interesting thing, whatever the anonymous responder receive

157
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:43.250
is multiplied by me. 3 times, let's say. So

158
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:48.609
if you give 4, the other receives 12. Now,

159
00:11:49.049 --> 00:11:53.049
what is reciprocity? And you see that, you know,

160
00:11:53.169 --> 00:11:57.530
people accept that reciprocity is maybe I give back

161
00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:02.640
the 4. You know, to the investor, or I

162
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.799
give 5, or I give half of what I

163
00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:08.380
receive 6, or maybe I give it a little

164
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:15.460
more, etc. So reciprocity is interpreted as a set

165
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:21.429
of possible actions, basically. But it's all agreed that

166
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.200
that this is reciprocity. Yeah, it may not be

167
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.030
strong, it may be weaker, but it's still reciprocity.

168
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.419
So this is an example basically that there are

169
00:12:31.719 --> 00:12:35.630
many different behaviors that may instantiate the norm, but

170
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.460
it's very important for norm strength that the number

171
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:44.659
is not infinite and that is sort of restricted

172
00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:48.640
and there is agreement about that. There is a

173
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.409
collective agreement. So we have consistency, accurate, specificity. Now,

174
00:12:54.919 --> 00:13:01.479
you asked me about uh norm stability. This is

175
00:13:01.479 --> 00:13:05.440
interesting. Again, stability is dynamics, you know, a norm

176
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.989
may be very strong but become unstable and I

177
00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:12.059
will tell you the recent study I have done.

178
00:13:12.479 --> 00:13:18.119
OK. Now, uh, I have argued in the past

179
00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:22.489
when I was looking at, uh, uh, modeling with

180
00:13:22.489 --> 00:13:26.640
game theory that the social norm is not an

181
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:34.080
evolutionary stable strategy. It's an evolutionarily stable state. What

182
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.460
does it mean? The state is represented by several

183
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.460
conditional strategies, and I did this publish an experiment

184
00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:48.219
with the Trust gates. And, you know, suppose you

185
00:13:48.219 --> 00:13:51.539
are an alien and come and look at our

186
00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:57.440
world and see. You know, that people trust and

187
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.640
reciprocate, trust and reciprocate. That's very interesting. So you

188
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.200
believe what there is clearly, you know, a reciprocity,

189
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.859
norm and people trust, this is the rule. But

190
00:14:08.859 --> 00:14:14.109
what lies behind, and I showed that, is that

191
00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:20.960
there are, you know, this regular behavioral pattern. Under

192
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:27.030
is underlined by many different strategies. So one strategy

193
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:31.969
is always trust, never reciprocate. Don't trust, always reciprocate.

194
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.190
And you have a show, it's interesting because in

195
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.909
this paper, I show that a minority of very

196
00:14:38.909 --> 00:14:42.719
moral people can only exist when there is a

197
00:14:42.719 --> 00:14:46.830
population of punishers because a, a moral minority could

198
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.070
never exist alone. That's, that's an interesting result. But

199
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:54.960
basically, what I say is that the social norm.

200
00:14:55.609 --> 00:14:59.809
Uh, YOU know, to be stable is an evolutionary

201
00:14:59.809 --> 00:15:05.429
stable state, which is represented by several conditional strategies.

202
00:15:05.599 --> 00:15:10.409
OK. Now, uh, I also show in some other

203
00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:13.849
paper that stability is also related to what I

204
00:15:13.849 --> 00:15:17.049
call norm sensitivity. What does I mean norm sensitivity?

205
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.330
Norm sensitivity means it's a parameter you can measure

206
00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:24.130
how much I care about what the norms stands

207
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.719
for. And think of a society in which people

208
00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:33.200
care a lot about fairness, OK? And what does

209
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.200
it mean? It means they have interjected in some

210
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.539
sense, the norm, OK? And this is very important.

211
00:15:42.039 --> 00:15:46.440
So it's still a social norm, but it's become

212
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.320
part of my thinking, who I am. I am

213
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.799
the kind of person that really care about fairness.

214
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:58.590
So it's very important that stability is also related

215
00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.770
to a sort of interjecting of the norm, of

216
00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:05.090
a norm sensitivity. People with, what does it mean

217
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.809
that if we, if a population have a very

218
00:16:07.809 --> 00:16:11.450
high norm sensitivity, they will have a very high

219
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:17.270
threshold for change. OK. It's not enough that like

220
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.710
they see a 30% people changing for them to

221
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.909
change or be invaded by a population like if

222
00:16:24.909 --> 00:16:28.989
we are a majority, a minority invades a minority,

223
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.750
let's say they don't behave fairly, uh, it will

224
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.950
be very difficult, uh, you know, for a population

225
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:40.239
with a very high threshold to change. Now, Uh,

226
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.619
my recent study, my recent study, uh, uh, thinking

227
00:16:44.619 --> 00:16:50.419
about, again, norm stability, I ask a different question.

228
00:16:50.539 --> 00:16:56.090
I say, hey, We think of threshold, we think

229
00:16:56.090 --> 00:17:00.570
of, uh, you know, sens sensitivity, etc. BUT we

230
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:08.050
never study different learning models. We learn differently. And

231
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.890
in a recent study that I'm going to publish

232
00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:16.739
soon, uh, I and a postdoc of mine. Bake

233
00:17:16.739 --> 00:17:22.009
soon. What we look at is 3 different learning

234
00:17:22.009 --> 00:17:27.229
modes. One is a traditional Bayesian. The other is

235
00:17:27.229 --> 00:17:31.469
a limited memory Bayesian, and the third is people

236
00:17:31.469 --> 00:17:36.709
with confirmation bias. Uh, DO I need to explain

237
00:17:36.709 --> 00:17:38.270
what confirmation bias is? No,

238
00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.910
I've already explored that topic several times on the

239
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:42.410
show, so,

240
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.609
uh, OK. And so suppose you have two groups.

241
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.569
A is a majority and B is a minority,

242
00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.869
and what we do is, uh, A may be

243
00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:57.510
traditional Bayesian and B can be confirmation bias, or

244
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:02.660
a limited memory and B. Uh, TYPICAL Bayesians, etc.

245
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.800
ETC. AND the interesting thing. Is the learning mode

246
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:14.140
determines what happens. So a norm in the majority

247
00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:19.119
can be completely stable, but depending on the interaction

248
00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:24.020
of the learning modes of majority and minority, the

249
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:31.449
norm may completely decay. And the threshold for the

250
00:18:31.449 --> 00:18:36.680
minority which is needed to overcome the majority depends

251
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.369
on the combination of learning models. I think it's

252
00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:43.239
a very interesting result and nobody looks at that

253
00:18:43.609 --> 00:18:46.170
because I think the important thing is that, well,

254
00:18:46.569 --> 00:18:49.680
we receive data. How we, how do we process

255
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.729
this data? And uh, uh, you know, what we

256
00:18:53.729 --> 00:18:56.829
do is show that the learning modes and the

257
00:18:56.829 --> 00:19:01.329
combination learning modes. Uh, DETERMINED the threshold needed to

258
00:19:01.329 --> 00:19:04.290
change the social norm, which is crucial.

259
00:19:05.229 --> 00:19:08.550
OK, and so, and how do you study the

260
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:13.589
effects of social norms on individual decision making? I

261
00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:18.030
mean, how, what influences our choice to obey or

262
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.750
disobey a social norm?

263
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:25.920
OK. There are, you know, various, because theoretically I

264
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.680
say in the abstract, I say you have conditional

265
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:34.800
preferences, OK. If I have social expectations and conditional

266
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.550
preference, means social expectation, cause. You know, my behavior.

267
00:19:39.849 --> 00:19:43.589
Now, the, the question you may ask is, oh,

268
00:19:43.859 --> 00:19:48.209
yeah, how do they cause my behavior? What's there?

269
00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:52.170
And on the one hand, there may be fear

270
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:56.790
of punishment. OK. This is one of the reasons

271
00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:01.410
why people obey norms. You know, they fear, uh,

272
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:06.910
being reprimanded. The punishment doesn't mean severe punishment, you

273
00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:09.550
know, you go to jail. It's not a legal

274
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.810
thing, but it may mean you will be ostracized,

275
00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.569
you will be judged negatively, your reputation. You know,

276
00:20:17.709 --> 00:20:22.050
will suffer, etc. ETC. So, we are social animals

277
00:20:22.189 --> 00:20:25.349
and so very often, you know, we obey norm,

278
00:20:25.459 --> 00:20:31.319
even if we're not really Agreeing with the norm

279
00:20:31.739 --> 00:20:35.900
because there are lots of social consequences for not

280
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.890
doing that. So this is one of the many

281
00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.900
reasons, but there are also good reasons. Sometimes we

282
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.550
like what the norm stands for. The important thing

283
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.729
is that This distinguishing my view, the moral and

284
00:20:51.729 --> 00:20:55.729
the social. Even if I like what the norms

285
00:20:55.729 --> 00:20:59.810
stand for, and so, you know, I appreciate the

286
00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:03.069
fact that people support it, I support it too,

287
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:09.130
it's not a moral norm for me as long

288
00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:17.199
as the social expectations matter. OK, I see morality

289
00:21:17.199 --> 00:21:23.680
as basically independent of social expectations. OK, so I

290
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.869
may obey a norm because I think it's right,

291
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.060
I think it's good, but it's still a social

292
00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.189
norm in the sense that it is important to

293
00:21:33.189 --> 00:21:37.319
me. That there are people who obey it, who

294
00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:41.319
support it, etc. I appreciate that. I support that,

295
00:21:41.599 --> 00:21:44.319
but maybe if nobody did that, I wouldn't do

296
00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:44.719
it.

297
00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.589
Yes. So in your work, and now to illustrate

298
00:21:50.589 --> 00:21:54.920
how social norms change, in your work you've explored

299
00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.439
the example of norms surrounding child marriage. So could

300
00:21:59.439 --> 00:22:02.079
you tell us about that example and tell us

301
00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:06.199
about how norms change or changed in that particular

302
00:22:06.199 --> 00:22:06.420
case?

303
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.800
Yeah, that's a, that's a very interesting question. I

304
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.579
did a lot of work in developing world. In

305
00:22:13.579 --> 00:22:17.939
India and Africa, etc. AND, uh, one important, uh,

306
00:22:18.079 --> 00:22:22.420
one important, uh, uh, behavior has always been child

307
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.540
marriage, where, uh, as soon as the girls, uh,

308
00:22:26.589 --> 00:22:30.109
reaches puberty, you know, she gets, uh, she gets

309
00:22:30.109 --> 00:22:32.939
married and so she cannot study, she cannot have

310
00:22:32.939 --> 00:22:35.550
a more fulfilling life and so on and so

311
00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.219
forth. And the, the question for me was at

312
00:22:39.219 --> 00:22:44.829
the beginning to understand. What is it? Why families

313
00:22:44.829 --> 00:22:50.630
do that? OK. That may be, uh, purely economic

314
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.949
reason. In the sense that, uh, in places where

315
00:22:54.949 --> 00:22:59.390
mortality, youth mortality is very high, you know, it

316
00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.739
is important, you know, to, to marry younger. Have

317
00:23:03.739 --> 00:23:07.699
children early, etc. But, you know, when this is

318
00:23:07.699 --> 00:23:11.540
not the case, uh, uh. What are, what are

319
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:16.349
the reasons? Are there moral reason, religious reason, etc.

320
00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:21.199
And in order to understand what the reasons are,

321
00:23:21.699 --> 00:23:27.800
you have to do measurement. OK. And to do

322
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.199
measurement, we do, uh, two different things. On the

323
00:23:32.199 --> 00:23:37.439
one hand, we ask people, you know, uh, what

324
00:23:37.439 --> 00:23:40.920
do you think your neighbor do, you know, in

325
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.199
your village, how many people marry, blah, blah, blah.

326
00:23:44.439 --> 00:23:47.839
What do you think people believe about that? Have

327
00:23:47.839 --> 00:23:50.599
you married your daughters? Do you plan to do

328
00:23:50.599 --> 00:23:55.500
that, etc. ETC. Then, and so we may see

329
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.459
that there is a correlation between the expectations and

330
00:23:59.459 --> 00:24:04.380
the behavior. Correlation is not causation. And so what

331
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:09.739
we do, we present people with vignettes, OK? And

332
00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:15.239
vignettes are these hypothetical stories about somebody very similar

333
00:24:15.239 --> 00:24:20.680
to them. That is Faith that goes to a

334
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.280
different place, a different village, very similar, but, you

335
00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:30.040
know, not the same, and discovers that most people

336
00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.329
do not marry. Their young daughters and most people,

337
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:39.609
you know, uh, dislike marrying them, or many people

338
00:24:39.609 --> 00:24:42.810
do and many people agree, or few do, but

339
00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.250
many agree, or many do a few agree. And

340
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:50.369
each person gets only one cell is a factorial

341
00:24:50.369 --> 00:24:56.280
2 by 2. And what we try to discover

342
00:24:56.739 --> 00:25:04.170
is whether social expectation do matter. I Are we

343
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:12.089
facing a social norm? Or not. And um very

344
00:25:12.089 --> 00:25:16.890
interesting, yes. My answer often is, yes, we're facing

345
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:20.650
the social norm. There are people, among all these

346
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:24.150
people, there's a majority that is a social norm

347
00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:27.170
bound, let's say. There are people who do that

348
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.329
for moral and religious reasons, you see that, but

349
00:25:30.329 --> 00:25:34.280
it's a small minority, usually what you see. I,

350
00:25:34.369 --> 00:25:38.130
uh, is basically, uh, is a social norm. But

351
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:41.329
you have to have these two measures basically. On

352
00:25:41.329 --> 00:25:44.280
the one hand, you measure behavior and expectations, see

353
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.569
if there is a correlation, but then you want

354
00:25:46.569 --> 00:25:51.410
to see, you know, with the hypothetical vignettes, whether

355
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:55.560
this correlation is causally relevant. There is causation. When

356
00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.010
there is, then I conclude that, yes, it is

357
00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:01.369
a social norm. The next question is, how do

358
00:26:01.369 --> 00:26:06.939
you change it? Yes. So, uh,

359
00:26:06.949 --> 00:26:10.719
let me ask you about a few other factors

360
00:26:10.719 --> 00:26:14.589
that might play a role in rule following and

361
00:26:14.589 --> 00:26:17.910
norm compliance. So first of all, what is the

362
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:22.670
influence of group identity and peer effects on rule

363
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:23.229
following?

364
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.329
I think, uh, I think it's, uh, is important.

365
00:26:28.589 --> 00:26:34.780
Uh, IT is important, especially. Uh, YOU know, uh,

366
00:26:34.939 --> 00:26:38.819
let's go back for a moment. Social norms are

367
00:26:38.819 --> 00:26:43.780
often local. What does it mean local? It means

368
00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:50.189
that certain norms define a group. OK. Uh, I,

369
00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.109
I remember I was reading uh a very interesting

370
00:26:53.109 --> 00:26:58.510
book about California jails and in California jails, there

371
00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:06.359
are different groups of, uh, um, Basically criminals, but

372
00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:13.119
each group has different tattoos. And they, their identity

373
00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:17.540
is very much visible and determined by the tattoos,

374
00:27:17.609 --> 00:27:22.540
etc. AND it's very interesting because when they were

375
00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.859
interviewed, somebody said that if, uh, you know, they

376
00:27:25.859 --> 00:27:31.050
do something wrong. We will slash them and take

377
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:36.250
away the food, etc. It's very interesting why, why

378
00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:42.079
I find it interesting because groups have norms. And

379
00:27:42.079 --> 00:27:47.270
these norms are local, and your question is identity

380
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:54.250
linked to norms? Yes. Absolutely. There are norms that

381
00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:59.520
specify my being a member of that particular group.

382
00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:03.609
I mean, of course, uh, we have lived with

383
00:28:03.609 --> 00:28:09.369
women versus men, femininity versus masculinity norms, it's a

384
00:28:09.369 --> 00:28:13.729
sexual behavior norms, etc. ETC. So I'm not saying

385
00:28:13.729 --> 00:28:19.410
something new here, but norms really are very much

386
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:24.079
linked. Uh, TO identity. In more traditional society, they

387
00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:27.880
are very strongly linked to identity. In more modern

388
00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.239
society, they are much less so, and this may

389
00:28:31.239 --> 00:28:35.719
cause problems actually, but, uh, uh, yes, they are

390
00:28:35.719 --> 00:28:40.750
linked to identity. They is a way of saying

391
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.790
I am a woman or I am a member

392
00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:47.229
of this gang and not another gang, etc. ETC.

393
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:51.310
They are identifiers in some sense, yes.

394
00:28:52.819 --> 00:28:55.829
And so that can actually, uh, I, I mean,

395
00:28:55.949 --> 00:28:58.349
of course it's not exactly the same thing, but

396
00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:01.989
uh I imagine that uh other kinds of language

397
00:29:01.989 --> 00:29:04.750
would also play a role in norm perception and

398
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.630
norm compliance, like for example, when we use normative

399
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:13.030
language like you should. You ought to, you must,

400
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:18.979
uh, so how does normative language actually shape norm

401
00:29:18.979 --> 00:29:20.890
perception and norm compliance?

402
00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.900
Uh, IT'S very, thank you. It's a very important

403
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:29.819
question, um, especially in behavioral economics, um, people have

404
00:29:29.819 --> 00:29:35.449
used the language. Without paying much attention to that.

405
00:29:35.949 --> 00:29:39.020
And so I published a, a, a study, uh,

406
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.660
with a graduate student of mine, uh, Jinny Kwang,

407
00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.410
in which uh what we did, we look at

408
00:29:46.869 --> 00:29:56.569
different ways of describing normative expectation, should, right, out,

409
00:29:57.109 --> 00:30:06.300
good, acceptable. Permissible, etc. And what we notice is

410
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.229
that When there is a very strong norm like

411
00:30:10.229 --> 00:30:13.790
reciprocity, you know, in a trust game, it doesn't

412
00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:18.520
matter. You know, you can use interchangeably these words.

413
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.359
Instead, we, we, if we play a game of

414
00:30:22.359 --> 00:30:25.719
charity, you know, and charity is not a strong

415
00:30:25.719 --> 00:30:32.280
norm. Therefore, the charity story. The language matters a

416
00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:40.050
lot. And when you say acceptable, OK. OK. When

417
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:45.530
you say should and right, people get nervous and

418
00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:50.170
upset and say, why should I, etc. So using

419
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:55.729
the language is very important because we give really

420
00:30:55.729 --> 00:31:00.199
different meanings to these expressions and if a norm

421
00:31:00.199 --> 00:31:03.130
is very strong, well established, it doesn't matter. But

422
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:08.500
if it's not, beware. Be a minimalist, I would

423
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.000
say.

424
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.270
Uh, SO I would like to ask you about

425
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:18.050
this idea of norm nudging. What is norm nudging

426
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:20.770
and how, uh, how does it work?

427
00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:25.619
OK, um, nudging, let's start with nudging, uh, you

428
00:31:25.619 --> 00:31:30.180
know, nudging, uh, uh, is, um, idea, you know,

429
00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:35.760
uh, introduced a few years ago, uh, about, uh,

430
00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:40.540
basically how can we change people's behavior, uh, in

431
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.780
a less expensive way, you know, without introducing economic

432
00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:52.390
incentives or legal incentives, etc. And, uh, um, and

433
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:56.869
nudging was very much related to, uh, like, how

434
00:31:56.869 --> 00:31:59.750
I nudge you to take your medicine, how I

435
00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:03.989
nudge you to invest in a 401k, etc. ETC.

436
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:09.369
And uh after that, people started getting really interested

437
00:32:09.369 --> 00:32:13.964
in norm nudging. So How do we nudge people

438
00:32:14.614 --> 00:32:19.375
to change norms or how can we create, uh,

439
00:32:19.464 --> 00:32:24.265
you know, uh, social norms, etc. And, uh, interestingly,

440
00:32:24.305 --> 00:32:27.574
and I've, I've worked on that, of course, and

441
00:32:27.574 --> 00:32:32.375
interestingly enough, uh, first of all, my, my, yes,

442
00:32:32.454 --> 00:32:38.680
OK, my friends, before everything, let's Be clear about

443
00:32:38.859 --> 00:32:42.920
what is a social norm, you know, and uh

444
00:32:43.219 --> 00:32:47.219
if you take my definition, nudging means changing people's

445
00:32:47.219 --> 00:32:52.280
expectations. OK. First of all, you measure people's expectation

446
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.060
and then you say, OK, this is what they

447
00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:59.459
expect. Maybe these expectations are completely wrong. Think of

448
00:32:59.459 --> 00:33:02.579
pluralistic ignorance, then we tell them, no, no, no,

449
00:33:02.699 --> 00:33:06.579
no, no, you know, statistically speaking, people, you know,

450
00:33:06.699 --> 00:33:11.609
uh, support other behavior or, you know, they are

451
00:33:11.609 --> 00:33:17.060
just right in thinking, you know, oh. You know,

452
00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:22.790
uh, most people in this country. ARE corrupt and

453
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.989
is right. OK. And what does it mean no

454
00:33:25.989 --> 00:33:30.170
nudging here? You cannot lie to people saying, oh,

455
00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:35.109
you know, it's false. Most people do. I think

456
00:33:35.109 --> 00:33:39.349
an interesting, uh, and we're still thinking about that

457
00:33:39.349 --> 00:33:42.329
and how to do that, but an interesting way

458
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:49.439
is to show a dynamic. I, to show people

459
00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:54.609
that, OK, up to now, only 5%, you know,

460
00:33:54.969 --> 00:34:01.359
were refusing, rejecting corruption, but after this campaign, now

461
00:34:01.359 --> 00:34:07.180
we are 12% and it's increasing and people seem

462
00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:11.458
to respond to a positive dynamics. Now we have

463
00:34:11.458 --> 00:34:14.530
to verify that. It has to be shown in

464
00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:18.489
different areas, but I think it's very interesting because

465
00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:23.810
norm nudging very often is about, you know, changing

466
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:31.649
really bad and persistent and, you know, uh, observable

467
00:34:31.649 --> 00:34:35.928
sometimes behaviors. And so this is very important. Norm

468
00:34:35.928 --> 00:34:38.678
nudging, I think you have, first of all, to

469
00:34:38.678 --> 00:34:42.378
measure, you know, whether it is a norm and

470
00:34:42.378 --> 00:34:46.858
what, what are the expectation, empirical normative, and then

471
00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:50.478
work mostly on empirical expectation because in other work

472
00:34:50.478 --> 00:34:53.789
I have done, we show that when empirical and

473
00:34:53.789 --> 00:34:58.149
normative diverge, the empirical wins. You know, you may

474
00:34:58.149 --> 00:35:01.070
tell me, yeah, people think that it's wrong too,

475
00:35:01.149 --> 00:35:05.090
but then they do it. I'm sorry. I look

476
00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:05.949
at what they do.

477
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:11.050
Yes, that's totally fair. So let me ask you

478
00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:15.649
then, which, what kinds of strategies can we adopt

479
00:35:15.649 --> 00:35:18.169
to foster social change?

480
00:35:20.459 --> 00:35:26.189
Well, uh, you are asking within the norm environment

481
00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.300
because we can foster social change in many different

482
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:34.870
ways. Uh, BUT norm environment means first of all,

483
00:35:35.459 --> 00:35:38.300
uh, we can do, uh, we can do two

484
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:42.020
things. On the one hand, we may identify norms

485
00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.739
that we want to change, or we may think

486
00:35:45.739 --> 00:35:47.580
there is no norm here, but we want to

487
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.840
create one. So these are two very, very different

488
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:57.510
things. For example, I did, uh, for 5 years,

489
00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.820
I worked in India for the Gates Foundation, studying

490
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.689
sanitation. At the beginning, people thought that open defecation

491
00:36:07.689 --> 00:36:10.489
was a norm. No, it's not a norm. It's

492
00:36:10.489 --> 00:36:14.929
a collective habit, OK? And the question is, can

493
00:36:14.929 --> 00:36:20.879
we create a norm of using proper sanitation? Can

494
00:36:20.879 --> 00:36:24.750
it be done? And we conducted a lot of

495
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.669
studies in two different states in India, one richer,

496
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:33.030
one poorer, and uh we got basically the same

497
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:37.060
answer that uh what we need is, uh, is

498
00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.699
cheaper in a sense, is to create a purely

499
00:36:39.699 --> 00:36:44.639
descriptive norm. OK, that the more people see other

500
00:36:44.639 --> 00:36:49.199
people using proper sanitation, toilets, the more they will

501
00:36:49.199 --> 00:36:53.600
do that. Now, what you can see also is

502
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.760
that You know, there is a really a passage

503
00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.939
when more and more people do something and it

504
00:37:00.939 --> 00:37:06.860
stabilizes, then the normative comes. Then they start thinking,

505
00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.780
oh, it's the right thing to do. But you

506
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.860
don't start trying to put into people's minds this

507
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.860
is the right thing to do because it's not

508
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.310
going to be helpful. In that case, in the

509
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:25.030
case of sanitation, you show basically that there is

510
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:29.770
an increasing number of people using it. People imitate

511
00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:33.620
each other and, uh, you know, a descriptive norm

512
00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.620
will be born and it was successful actually. It,

513
00:37:36.669 --> 00:37:41.360
uh, it was born. And once a descriptive norm

514
00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.379
becomes very stable, then it may become a social

515
00:37:44.379 --> 00:37:47.060
norm. Then people may think, oh, this is the

516
00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.000
right thing to do. This is what we normally,

517
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:55.879
uh, are sort of Uh, I don't know if,

518
00:37:55.959 --> 00:37:59.840
uh, if it's something, uh, natural to humans, but

519
00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.419
what happens, uh, if you look at children, children,

520
00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:08.840
uh, infer normativity from observations. So, we are built.

521
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:16.159
To basically generate normativity from the descriptive. And so

522
00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:18.479
social norm may be born out of creating the

523
00:38:18.479 --> 00:38:20.229
scriptive norm, for example.

524
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.709
So I have one last question then, and of

525
00:38:24.709 --> 00:38:28.550
course this is a much broader global issue that

526
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:31.110
we have to try to tackle, but can we

527
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:35.389
apply this knowledge to fight climate change?

528
00:38:37.199 --> 00:38:38.500
To language change.

529
00:38:39.689 --> 00:38:42.649
Uh, I mean, the, the different kinds of strategies

530
00:38:42.649 --> 00:38:45.570
we've talked about here to, uh, to try to,

531
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:50.810
uh, nudge people's behaviors or change social norms in

532
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:54.649
a way that would help mitigate climate change.

533
00:38:55.689 --> 00:39:00.649
Oh, climate change. Uh. Uh, YEAH, uh, first of

534
00:39:00.649 --> 00:39:03.760
all, this is interesting. I have students that study

535
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.770
climate change, etc. AND the, the question is, uh,

536
00:39:08.169 --> 00:39:13.020
first of all, One thing is thinking in general

537
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:18.689
about climate change, and the second is what are

538
00:39:18.699 --> 00:39:25.669
individual behaviors that can be helpful, that can mitigate.

539
00:39:25.969 --> 00:39:30.780
These are two very different things. So, you know,

540
00:39:31.139 --> 00:39:37.479
individual behavior, uh, can be, for example, um, buying

541
00:39:37.479 --> 00:39:44.120
less meat. OK, because buying less meat, etc. AND

542
00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:49.879
the question is, do people So, suppose that I

543
00:39:49.879 --> 00:39:55.590
realize that uh huge meat production, consumption, etc. IS

544
00:39:55.590 --> 00:40:02.739
damaging to the environment. The question is that What,

545
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:07.189
what sort of effect will this have on my

546
00:40:07.189 --> 00:40:13.429
own meat consumption? OK, I have, in order, suppose

547
00:40:13.429 --> 00:40:15.530
I am a meat eater and I like it,

548
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:20.030
but I also care about climate change. Would I

549
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:25.360
stop eating meat? Even if I believe that people

550
00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:31.389
are still consuming it. Will I stop travel by

551
00:40:31.389 --> 00:40:36.530
air, even if I see, you know, that everybody,

552
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:41.030
uh, you know, is, uh, traveling by air, etc.

553
00:40:41.429 --> 00:40:45.570
So is, is, am I going to restrict myself

554
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:51.429
when I observe very little restriction around me? So

555
00:40:51.429 --> 00:40:54.550
with climate change, I think uh is uh is

556
00:40:54.550 --> 00:41:02.139
very, very important. The government. Intervention I think this

557
00:41:02.139 --> 00:41:07.479
is an area where government have to because we

558
00:41:07.479 --> 00:41:13.219
always think of nudging little things, etc. BUT climate

559
00:41:13.219 --> 00:41:18.260
change is an enormous phenomenon and so I think

560
00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:23.860
it's very important that government are the first inducers.

561
00:41:24.419 --> 00:41:29.459
OK, of, uh, uh, mitigation. Very, very important. It's

562
00:41:29.459 --> 00:41:32.989
very interesting because in American culture, you always think

563
00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:38.679
it's the individual, but it's not just the individual.

564
00:41:38.969 --> 00:41:42.830
In this case, you need a very strong government

565
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:47.689
intervention. This may lead us also to change behavior,

566
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:51.469
but you need that because it's such a massive

567
00:41:51.469 --> 00:41:55.889
major. You know, set of events that, you know,

568
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:59.719
yes, I may consume less electricity, but you know,

569
00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:02.209
and it's very interesting, Ricardo, I have to tell

570
00:42:02.209 --> 00:42:06.969
you something. Speaking of electricity, all these studies about

571
00:42:06.969 --> 00:42:11.169
nudging people to use less, less electricity in California,

572
00:42:11.239 --> 00:42:16.550
etc. YOU know, Uh, they have a good effect,

573
00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.889
but how long does it last? Not long. OK.

574
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.520
OK. So this is another very important thing. We

575
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:30.600
need longitudinal studies to see that norm nudging really

576
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.600
has an effect. It will, I believe, but we

577
00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:39.590
need uh more studies to understand when it declines,

578
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.899
why. Mhm.

579
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.719
Great. So, Doctor Biccierri, just before we go, where

580
00:42:46.719 --> 00:42:49.719
can people find your work on the internet?

581
00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:55.570
Oh, you know, uh, Everywhere you can go on

582
00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:59.879
Google and, uh, and you put the dates, uh,

583
00:42:59.889 --> 00:43:04.760
because Google, um, you know, shows basically uh the

584
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.639
most quoted first, etc. BUT you should put, uh,

585
00:43:08.729 --> 00:43:11.409
I think a better way is to put the

586
00:43:11.409 --> 00:43:15.810
year on. So you put 2026, 2025, and so,

587
00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:18.889
and you see, uh, I wrote more than 200

588
00:43:18.889 --> 00:43:24.879
articles and uh, the books that uh I recommend

589
00:43:24.879 --> 00:43:28.750
on norms, uh, the 2006 book, The Grammar of

590
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:32.909
Society, where I really define social norms. But in

591
00:43:32.909 --> 00:43:39.000
that book, I didn't have any idea of acting

592
00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:43.459
on norms, measuring norms, etc. AND only after that

593
00:43:43.459 --> 00:43:47.709
book, I started doing applied work. And a summary

594
00:43:47.709 --> 00:43:50.590
of my applied work is a book published in

595
00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:57.385
2016 called Norm in the wild, where I discuss

596
00:43:57.385 --> 00:44:00.645
exactly how to change norm and what to do

597
00:44:00.715 --> 00:44:05.814
and uh what sort of economically legal nudging, uh,

598
00:44:05.824 --> 00:44:09.185
the role of transsetters and all that. And now

599
00:44:09.185 --> 00:44:14.885
I'm preparing a new book about poverty and norms

600
00:44:15.495 --> 00:44:20.324
that basically, uh, keep people in a poverty trap.

601
00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:24.280
Uh, IT'S related to America. I didn't do a

602
00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:28.320
study of other countries, but I did a major

603
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.840
study of, um, American rural, urban, and I think

604
00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.399
it's, I get very interesting results. So this is

605
00:44:36.399 --> 00:44:38.419
the next project.

606
00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.899
Very good. So, Doctor Biccierri, thank you so much

607
00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.080

608
00:44:44.149 --> 00:44:45.919
