00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.099
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:05.909
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:05.909 --> 00:00:08.630
today I'm joined by Doctor Kevin La. He is

4
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.939
professor of behavioral and evolutionary biology at the University

5
00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:14.989
of Saint Andrews in Scotland. He's the author of

6
00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.510
several books, and today we're going to focus on

7
00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:22.270
his latest one evolution involving the developmental origins of

8
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.510
adaptation and biodiversity. So, Doctor Lala, welcome to the

9
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.709
show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.500
Thank you very much, Ricardo. I appreciate your interest.

11
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.330
So, just to introduce the topic here, in biology,

12
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.220
when looking for explanations for the existence of particular

13
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.299
kinds of traits, what, what kinds of, what different

14
00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:50.580
kinds of explanations can we find in different subfields

15
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.459
of evolutionary biology?

16
00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.490
Well, um, There are a number of different questions

17
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.569
one can ask about a trait. Um, YOU could

18
00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.129
ask what is its adaptive function. That's the kind

19
00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.839
of question that a um behavioral ecologist might ask,

20
00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:10.889
for instance. We might uh focus in on a

21
00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:13.319
particular trait. We use the example in the book

22
00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.970
of the turtle shell. Where did the turtle get

23
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.830
its shell? How did it get it? Um, AND

24
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.830
to be a ecologist, it'll be asking, well, you

25
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.500
know, what does a shell do for the turtle?

26
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.430
Uh, AND it's, you know, with a little bit

27
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.910
of research, we can establish that it provides the

28
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.010
turtle with protection. So we're focusing on, on the

29
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.629
adaptive function of the trait, and that can be

30
00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.550
put to the test in a number of different

31
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.379
ways. Um, OTHER researchers in other spheres of biology

32
00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:47.089
ask different kinds of questions. Um, DEVELOPMENTAL biologists or

33
00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:51.139
even devo researchers would be more interested in the

34
00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:54.260
developmental origins of the shell in the case of

35
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.300
the, of the turtle. So, so how does the

36
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.069
trait develop over time in the, in the focal

37
00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.230
organism? And in, in this case, you've got the

38
00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:08.000
Um, you know, the, the, the ribs effectively spreading

39
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.619
out through the skin to create this carrot paste,

40
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.750
which, um, you know, provides that protection to the,

41
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.119
to the turtle. Um, uh, AND then, you know,

42
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.639
you've got. Paleontologists, for instance, who might be asking

43
00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.589
much more about the history of the evolutionary history

44
00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.960
of that particular trait, how did it come to

45
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.869
be from what did that um trait evolve, um,

46
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.600
and it, it, in the example we use in

47
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.830
the book, that's quite an interesting question because. In

48
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.750
a way, um, you know, paleontologists initially made a

49
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.149
sort of wrong term. It was perfectly logical to

50
00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.190
think this way, but, uh, they thought because, because

51
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.789
turtles are closely related to crocodiles, and crocodiles have

52
00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:56.399
these sort of scaly, um, covering on their back

53
00:02:56.399 --> 00:03:01.389
or ostoderms, that most likely the turtle shell evolved

54
00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.750
out of osteoderms, and so they anticipated that their

55
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.130
ancestor would have these osteoderms. And as a consequence,

56
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.029
neglected what turned out to be a critical fossil,

57
00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:16.410
um, that lacked these osteoderms, but also actually lacked

58
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.649
a carapace. It lacked a shell on the top

59
00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:21.250
of its body altogether, but had a shell on

60
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.289
the bottom of its body, on its breastplate, a

61
00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:28.119
plastron. And, um, you know, when this subsequently, um,

62
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.000
came to light and, and the, the true evolutionary

63
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.449
history of uh turtles was understood. Then it became

64
00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.800
clear that the initial function of the shell, uh,

65
00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.070
was not protection, as the, you know, the behavioral

66
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.839
ecologists had sort of inferred from its current function,

67
00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:48.850
but as a digging platform for these turtles. And

68
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.250
then only subsequently did this carapace evolve to provide

69
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.169
protection. And what's, what's quite nice about that, I

70
00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.649
think, is it illustrates, firstly, how Um, you know,

71
00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.729
it's, it's healthy to have these different spheres of

72
00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.949
biology that are asking different kinds of questions and

73
00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.880
collectively, they give us a, a, a richer understanding

74
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.460
of the question, and they can correct each other's

75
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.380
errors when those occasionally do occur in the short

76
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.640
term. Um, BUT also they encourage us to ask

77
00:04:19.928 --> 00:04:25.269
questions that might not otherwise be asked. So, um,

78
00:04:25.329 --> 00:04:28.070
you know, we, we, we might think to ourselves,

79
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.739
Why did the turtle solve the problem of predation

80
00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:37.750
with a shell? Why not have big teeth and

81
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.390
fight off predators? Why not run away? And by

82
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.679
taking this broader perspective, we can, we can get

83
00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:48.630
an answer to that kind of question, um, because

84
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.440
it sort of tells us that, well, Uh, initially,

85
00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.799
they had this plastrum, which was, which was really

86
00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:57.470
important for digging, so that kind of prevented growing

87
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.070
long legs to run, run away. And once you

88
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.929
have that, then it's really easy, uh, developmentally speaking,

89
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.720
and, um, in evolutionary terms, to evolve the same

90
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.959
structure in the top half of the body, and

91
00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:12.519
so you get that, that kind of pace evolving.

92
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.970
So, um, you know, multiple perspectives in a science,

93
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.200
I think are extremely healthy.

94
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.510
So at a certain point there, you mentioned developmental

95
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.829
biology. Could you tell us a little, a little

96
00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:29.019
bit more about that subfield? What is developmental biology

97
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.880
and specifically in what ways does it relate to

98
00:05:33.109 --> 00:05:34.750
evolutionary biology?

99
00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:37.690
Yeah, I mean, it's a really good question, because

100
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:44.630
historically, there's been a separation of evolutionary and developmental

101
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.970
research, and that occurred in the middle, around the

102
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.130
middle of the, the, the last century. You go

103
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.529
back to Darwin's day, actually, um, Darwin was very

104
00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:56.609
interested in, in organisms development and, and used things

105
00:05:56.609 --> 00:06:00.440
like the study of embryos to, to provide evidence

106
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.540
for evolution. But, um, you know, around the 1920s,

107
00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:10.260
1930s, the, the, this separation occurred between these two

108
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.179
fields. It, it, it began, I think, with the

109
00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:19.609
rediscovery, discovery of um Mendel's rules for inheritance, um,

110
00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:23.660
and the integration of that Mendelian inheritance with population

111
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.269
genetics thinking, and that led to, uh, a means

112
00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:32.570
for studying evolution. Without really paying much attention to

113
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.730
development. And I, I suppose that was a very

114
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.429
pragmatic line to take at the time. We really

115
00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:41.579
didn't know very much about development, and, and it's

116
00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:45.619
horrendously complicated. So, um, you know, it's not unreasonable

117
00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:49.420
of researchers to have taken that pragmatic line, but

118
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.540
oftentimes what happens in science is, you know, we,

119
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.260
we make assumptions, and, um, you know, they're made

120
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.829
for good, good reasons, but then, you know, as

121
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.119
Um, Erasmus Winter, philosopher of biology says the sort

122
00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:09.079
of the map becomes the territory. We forget that

123
00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:10.640
this is just a model of the world, and

124
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.429
it sort of becomes the world, and it becomes

125
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.920
almost doctrine that we don't need to know about

126
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.559
development. To study evolution. And the argument we make

127
00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:25.130
in our book, Evolution Evolving, is that, well, that's

128
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.089
true, you can, to some extent understand evolution without

129
00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:31.290
taking development into account, but if you do take

130
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.630
development into account, then you get a better understanding,

131
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.410
you get a richer explanation. Now, I, I guess

132
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.739
I've been talking a lot about Development, I should,

133
00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:44.059
I should perhaps make clear what I mean by

134
00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:47.489
that term because, um, you know, in our book,

135
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.380
we, we are, uh, using it in, in quite

136
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.140
a broad way and a lot of people think

137
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.700
about development in different ways and for some, some

138
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.820
people it's, it's all development means, you know, building

139
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.720
skyscrapers or, or, you know, raising money. Um, OBVIOUSLY,

140
00:08:04.799 --> 00:08:08.190
we're talking about biological development here, but we're also

141
00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:12.160
thinking very broad terms from, from conception, everything that

142
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.859
happens from conception all the way through to death,

143
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.119
the whole of ontology, in other words. So when

144
00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:20.359
I use the term development, and when we use

145
00:08:20.359 --> 00:08:22.920
it in the book, we're talking about things like

146
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.359
what happens to an adult, how adults behave, how

147
00:08:26.359 --> 00:08:31.410
they learn, their, their culture, their Developmental plasticity, all

148
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.690
of those kind of things are important in evolution.

149
00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:35.729
That's the argument I make.

150
00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.859
So, uh, at a certain point in the book,

151
00:08:39.898 --> 00:08:44.739
you talk about 5 principles of development. Development is

152
00:08:44.739 --> 00:08:49.299
modular, development is epigenetic, development is constructive. Then you

153
00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:53.179
also talk about the interchangeability of the phenotypic consequences

154
00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:55.629
of a change in DNA and the change in

155
00:08:55.638 --> 00:09:00.098
internal or external environment, and also one that we

156
00:09:00.098 --> 00:09:05.049
could summarize as phenotypic variation being structured and biased.

157
00:09:05.218 --> 00:09:07.458
Could you explain those principles?

158
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.830
Yes, that's right. So um what we try to

159
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.469
do in our book is just in a, in

160
00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:18.239
a single chapter. Sort of summarize, um, and it's

161
00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:20.869
almost an impossible task, but, you know, just, but

162
00:09:20.869 --> 00:09:24.030
we set out to summarize what an evolutionary biologist

163
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.789
or an evolutionary minded researcher needs to know about

164
00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:31.729
development, to, to really do a good job at

165
00:09:31.729 --> 00:09:35.270
understanding evolution. Um, AND of, of course, uh, I

166
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.919
mean, one of our co-authors is a guy called

167
00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:40.229
Scott Gilbert, who writes the developmental biology textbooks, and

168
00:09:40.229 --> 00:09:43.229
his, his textbooks, his undergraduate textbooks are that fact.

169
00:09:43.599 --> 00:09:46.799
Um, YOU know, so there, there's a huge amount

170
00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:49.210
of knowledge that we've kind of condensed down into

171
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.570
this, into this single chapter, and then we put

172
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.799
it in these 5 little sort of bullet points

173
00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:57.890
just to try and bring home these, these key

174
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.650
points that we want to get across. So, firstly,

175
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.890
development is module. That is, um, it's comprised of,

176
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:11.260
of sort of building blocks, circuits that are um

177
00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.179
well integrated and, and, um, you know, have their

178
00:10:14.179 --> 00:10:17.270
own independent structure, and can be used again and

179
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.979
again, a bit like Lego bricks, you know, we

180
00:10:19.979 --> 00:10:23.219
can take this bit of Developmental kit from over

181
00:10:23.219 --> 00:10:26.260
here, from building something, and use it over here

182
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.619
in another part of the body to do something

183
00:10:28.619 --> 00:10:31.940
else for another function. And that's what what evolution

184
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.570
has done repeatedly. A lot of it evolutionary innovations

185
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:41.979
involve taking circuitry or structures that preexisted. And reusing

186
00:10:41.979 --> 00:10:45.549
them in a new context. The instinct insect wing

187
00:10:45.549 --> 00:10:50.460
was built from from um um developmental machinery that

188
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.770
was initially used to produce insect legs, for instance.

189
00:10:54.349 --> 00:10:57.309
So, um, there's this modular structure, which it turns

190
00:10:57.309 --> 00:10:59.830
out is really, really important when it comes to

191
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.880
understanding evolutionary questions and the introduction of new traits.

192
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.809
There's this second feature, which is that development is

193
00:11:07.809 --> 00:11:12.299
epigenetic, and we're using epigenetic in the sense of

194
00:11:12.549 --> 00:11:16.109
above the level of the gene. So the, the

195
00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:18.869
control of development is above the level of the

196
00:11:18.869 --> 00:11:21.510
gene. And that stands in marked contrast, I think,

197
00:11:21.549 --> 00:11:26.919
to how Many people think about um. Development and

198
00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:29.239
how it's often portrayed in the media, like there's

199
00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:32.679
a genetic program where all of the information is

200
00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:35.679
stored, and that's read out, and there's this kind

201
00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:39.130
of unfolding of this instructions for building a body

202
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.840
and, and uh instructions for how that, that organism

203
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.640
should behave and so forth. We take issue with

204
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.159
that characterization of development. It's much more open-ended, it's

205
00:11:50.159 --> 00:11:53.320
much more flexible and the, the control, the regulation

206
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.500
of, of um Uh, uh, of the outputs, the

207
00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.580
phenotypes, the traits of the organism, is at a

208
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.349
higher level than the genes, at the level of

209
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.570
uh a sort of regulatory network of, yes, there's,

210
00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:08.650
there's genes involved, but a whole bunch of other

211
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:15.070
molecular outputs and, and um signals and environmental inputs,

212
00:12:15.219 --> 00:12:19.979
which collectively influence the structure of the trait. And

213
00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:25.700
that That perspective helps us to account for another

214
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.820
one of the characteristics of development that we, we

215
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:34.020
placed emphasis on, which is this interchangeability. Of genetic

216
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:39.270
and environmental inputs, because both genes and environments feed

217
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:43.950
into the regulatory machinery of development, they're all processed

218
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.710
by the same mechanisms. So you can get the

219
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:52.150
same phenotypic outputs arising from a genetic mutation and

220
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:57.429
or an environmental change. We also emphasize how development

221
00:12:57.429 --> 00:13:03.739
is constructive, that is, um, it's, is critically dependent

222
00:13:03.739 --> 00:13:08.150
on the organism itself, the organism an active player

223
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:14.549
in its own development. Um, One of my intellectual

224
00:13:14.549 --> 00:13:19.030
heroes, Richard Wantin describes um both evolution and development

225
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.700
as a bit like walking on a trampoline. As

226
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.859
you move, you deform the surface, and then you

227
00:13:26.859 --> 00:13:30.539
influence your own trajectory subsequently. We give a nice

228
00:13:30.539 --> 00:13:33.580
example in the book, uh, uh, of, of this

229
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:39.640
which um involves these, these um dung beetles. So,

230
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.630
um, the, these, these dung beetles, uh, the, the

231
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.280
mother beetle will, will build a brew ball out

232
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.369
of dung and, um, place an egg inside it

233
00:13:49.369 --> 00:13:52.090
and, and insert also a, a, a, a, a

234
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.409
little package of her symbiances inside, and then bury

235
00:13:55.409 --> 00:14:00.520
that underground. And then the infant, when it hatches,

236
00:14:00.599 --> 00:14:04.640
will consume the pedestal, thereby getting the mother symb.

237
00:14:04.859 --> 00:14:07.640
It will, um, it will then feed on the

238
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.510
brood ball. Um, IT will defecate, it will mix

239
00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.989
the materials, and in the process, it would distribute

240
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.599
all the bacteria, all the symbiots that he got

241
00:14:17.599 --> 00:14:20.440
from its mother throughout the brood ball, and those

242
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.760
bacteria then go to work in processing, um, all

243
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.510
the chitin and ligning and making the, the, um,

244
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:33.570
carbon nutrients available to the offspring to consume. So

245
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.869
it's effectively producing more of its own food. And

246
00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:40.909
experiments which have been carried out, which kind of

247
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.000
where you cancel the effects of the organism's activities

248
00:14:45.369 --> 00:14:48.000
and the mother's activities, show that it really does

249
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.489
make a difference. If you don't have that. Modification

250
00:14:52.489 --> 00:14:54.780
of your environment, but both the mother and the

251
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.679
and the and the larvae are engaging in, then

252
00:14:57.679 --> 00:15:00.460
the, the larvae will engage, will, will, will develop

253
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.909
in a completely different way. It will be much

254
00:15:02.909 --> 00:15:05.909
more, much more likely to, to be non-viable or

255
00:15:06.179 --> 00:15:08.219
grow to a far lesser extent. It won't become

256
00:15:08.219 --> 00:15:11.900
sexually dimorphic. It will be quite different as an

257
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.090
organism. So the form of the phenotype that you

258
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.909
end up with, the suite of traits that you

259
00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:22.309
come to possess, depends very much on what you

260
00:15:22.309 --> 00:15:25.789
do as an organism. You control, you influence your

261
00:15:25.789 --> 00:15:30.130
own development. And then there's this last point, which

262
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:35.530
is that um developmental processes are biased. They're biased

263
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:39.489
in the sense that certain phenotypes, certain traits, certain

264
00:15:39.489 --> 00:15:42.890
combinations of traits are far more likely to be

265
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.289
produced in development than others. And that, as we

266
00:15:46.289 --> 00:15:49.250
see, um, as we emphasize in the book, as,

267
00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:54.489
as a major importance to um To how we

268
00:15:54.489 --> 00:15:57.179
understand the action of natural selection, selection that is

269
00:15:57.179 --> 00:16:00.169
used is biased by the variation that's available to

270
00:16:00.169 --> 00:16:02.669
you. So,

271
00:16:02.919 --> 00:16:06.080
uh, another question then, what do you mean when

272
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.989
you say that the evolutionary process itself evolves?

273
00:16:12.969 --> 00:16:17.400
Yeah, so, um, To understand this, I think we

274
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.679
need to take a closer look at um natural

275
00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:23.479
selection. I mean, what we're trying to understand ultimately

276
00:16:23.479 --> 00:16:28.440
in the book is, is, um, how adaptive evolution

277
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.239
takes place. So how organisms acquire adaptations, how we

278
00:16:32.239 --> 00:16:35.960
get, um, speciation and, and diversity, the diversity of

279
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.909
life that we see. And we of course always

280
00:16:39.909 --> 00:16:45.530
um. Explain that with natural selection. And that's usually

281
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.090
as far as it goes, but one can look

282
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:52.369
a little bit closer at how natural selection works.

283
00:16:52.409 --> 00:16:54.460
We can break it down into its component parts,

284
00:16:54.489 --> 00:16:56.530
if you like. And that, I think, is an

285
00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:02.380
instructive exercise. So, um, biologists and, and philosophers have

286
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.569
recognized for some time that in order to get

287
00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:08.650
evolution by natural selection, you need 3 things. You

288
00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:13.060
need some process which is generating variation. In a

289
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.510
typical variation in the traits that are organism exhibits.

290
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:23.400
You need differences amongst them in their ability to

291
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.199
reproduce, to survive and reproduce fitness differences, and you

292
00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:31.880
need to pass on those qualities from one generation

293
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.319
to the next. You need inheritance in some form.

294
00:17:36.349 --> 00:17:42.300
um PHENOTYPIC variation. Fitness differences Inheritance. If you've got

295
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.099
those three things, natural selection should ensue. But in

296
00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:49.540
principle, you could apply those to the cultural evolution

297
00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.300
of the bicycle, right? It doesn't have to be

298
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.750
about biology. It doesn't have to be um satisfied

299
00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.250
in that way. Anything that has those three properties

300
00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:07.020
could evolve and produce adaptation. However, evolutionary biologists since

301
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:13.030
the 1950s, have had a particular way of interpret

302
00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.880
interpreting that algorithm. And it's a genetic view, a

303
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.760
genetic vision of natural selection. So when we think

304
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.119
about phenotypic variation, we tend to focus in on

305
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.869
the variation that arises from random genetic mutations. Yeah,

306
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.729
mutations that arise that at random with respect to

307
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.619
their functionality. Uh, AND those are the ones which

308
00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:42.109
we think are really, really important in evolution. And

309
00:18:42.109 --> 00:18:45.959
when it comes to fitness differences, well, we envisage

310
00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:49.010
that natural selection is sorting between genes and genotypes,

311
00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.989
and that's what really counts. And when it comes

312
00:18:50.989 --> 00:18:55.030
to inheritance, we focus in on genetic inheritance and

313
00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.849
the passive transmission of genes from parent to offspring.

314
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:06.069
So there's this genetic take on how natural selection

315
00:19:06.069 --> 00:19:12.930
works. But in practice, organisms can satisfy those requirements

316
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:17.359
for natural selection in other ways. Um, SO to

317
00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:19.989
give you just one example, it's a complicated issue.

318
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.780
We can see how many organisms have extra genetic

319
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.699
forms of inheritance. In the case of humans, we

320
00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:31.140
have cultural inheritance, whereas in the case of plants,

321
00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:35.780
they have epigenetic inheritance. Many animals inherit symbols and

322
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:41.010
so forth. So those Forms of inheritance in principle

323
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:45.810
can satisfy natural selection requirements for natural selection. So

324
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.520
when we start to look more closely. We can

325
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.160
actually see how developmental processes are in different ways,

326
00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.959
biasing the variation that's produced, the finitive variation that's

327
00:19:58.959 --> 00:20:03.439
produced, modifying the nature of the fitness differences that

328
00:20:03.439 --> 00:20:06.310
the organisms have through their interactions with their environment,

329
00:20:06.449 --> 00:20:10.839
and modifying the, the nature of inheritance and every

330
00:20:10.839 --> 00:20:14.000
organism does it. In their own particular way because

331
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.359
it depends on their own personal characteristics. Plants don't

332
00:20:17.359 --> 00:20:19.939
have a culture, so they can't do, um, you

333
00:20:19.939 --> 00:20:22.869
know, cultural inheritance, but, you know, killer whales can,

334
00:20:23.079 --> 00:20:29.209
humans can. So the characteristics of natural selection, the

335
00:20:29.209 --> 00:20:31.339
way it works for any given organism, and we

336
00:20:31.339 --> 00:20:34.939
give plenty of examples in the book, depends on

337
00:20:34.939 --> 00:20:39.060
the properties of the organism. Natural selection depends on

338
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.939
the properties of the organism, well then it follows

339
00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:45.459
that as organisms evolve, the evolutionary process evolves.

340
00:20:47.449 --> 00:20:51.089
So you've touched very slightly on this topic in,

341
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:56.079
in just the previous answer, but what is developmental

342
00:20:56.079 --> 00:20:58.959
bias? What does that mean in the context of

343
00:20:58.959 --> 00:21:00.329
developmental biology?

344
00:21:01.329 --> 00:21:07.530
Yeah, so, um Um Developmental bias is a, is

345
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.969
a relatively simple idea. It's the idea that um,

346
00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:17.819
The Variation, the phenotypic variation, the traits that organisms

347
00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:20.770
have or the combinations of traits that arise in

348
00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:23.780
development is biased, so that some traits or some

349
00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.530
combinations of traits are far more likely to arise

350
00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:32.020
in development than others. And the significance of that

351
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.300
is that that bias is the action of natural

352
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:40.239
selection and Influences the patterns of variation that we

353
00:21:40.239 --> 00:21:43.119
see out there in the world. I can explain

354
00:21:43.119 --> 00:21:46.229
it with a uh analogy if you like. So,

355
00:21:46.939 --> 00:21:49.430
um, imagine you're traveling and you stay in a

356
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:53.000
hotel and you go down for breakfast to the,

357
00:21:53.199 --> 00:21:56.479
to the restaurant where they have a buffet, and

358
00:21:56.479 --> 00:21:59.719
they're serving two kinds of eggs, um, fried eggs

359
00:21:59.719 --> 00:22:03.189
and scrambled eggs. But in this restaurant, The chef

360
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.520
is able to produce scrambled eggs at 10 times

361
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.020
the rate he produces fried eggs. And you look

362
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:14.050
around the restaurant. And you see, pretty much everybody

363
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.010
is eating scrambled eggs, right? So there are two

364
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.300
kinds of explanations that might account for that. One

365
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.130
is a selective kind of explanation. It could be

366
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:27.589
that everybody preferred scrambled eggs, and they chose it.

367
00:22:27.849 --> 00:22:30.170
That's kind of equivalent to the traditional way in

368
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.849
which we might explain the variation that we see

369
00:22:32.849 --> 00:22:36.890
in, in nature. But there's another possibility, which is

370
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.939
that the scrambled eggs were just produced so much

371
00:22:38.939 --> 00:22:41.180
more frequently than the fried eggs that people were

372
00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.420
constrained to just eat scrambled eggs, that was what

373
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.589
was available. Uh, AND that's an, that's also a

374
00:22:47.589 --> 00:22:51.020
potential explanation, and more likely, what's going on in

375
00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.869
the, in the restaurant is a combination of those

376
00:22:53.869 --> 00:22:57.390
two things. And that's what we think is more

377
00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.040
likely explanation for the variation that we see in

378
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.310
the world, that it's a combination of um development

379
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.869
bias and selection, which accounts for the patterns that

380
00:23:07.869 --> 00:23:10.209
we see in nature. But in the book, we

381
00:23:10.209 --> 00:23:14.469
do live. Some really quite interesting and compelling examples

382
00:23:14.469 --> 00:23:21.150
of how through studying developmental mechanisms, you can predict

383
00:23:21.709 --> 00:23:24.729
What biases will arise and what patterns of variation

384
00:23:24.729 --> 00:23:26.729
should be observed, and then you go and look

385
00:23:26.729 --> 00:23:30.099
in nature and you see that's exactly the pat.

386
00:23:30.489 --> 00:23:33.890
So you can actually, to some extent, often predict.

387
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:40.930
The variation that arises in nature by What arrives

388
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.489
in development, what arrives in the first place, and

389
00:23:43.489 --> 00:23:44.650
the rate in which it does so.

390
00:23:46.349 --> 00:23:50.469
So, developmental biology, if I understand it correctly, can

391
00:23:50.469 --> 00:23:54.910
help explain why some of the adaptations exist and

392
00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:58.430
others do not, and why some characters are more

393
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.829
evolvable than others, right?

394
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:05.199
Exactly. And you know, the historically, of course, evolutionary

395
00:24:05.199 --> 00:24:09.349
bioies have sort of seen some role, a limited

396
00:24:09.349 --> 00:24:14.020
role for developmental biology and evolutionary explanation. So, um,

397
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.069
more commonly rather than talking of bias, we talk

398
00:24:17.069 --> 00:24:21.520
about developmental constraint. And, um, you know, we take

399
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.849
issue with that as a kind of explanatory tool.

400
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.250
We, we suggest that's probably not the optimal way

401
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:30.890
to think about these issues. And the, the, the

402
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.489
problem is that if you think in terms of

403
00:24:33.489 --> 00:24:39.349
developmental constraints, then The constraints, the developmental aspects can

404
00:24:39.349 --> 00:24:44.319
account for why development does not occur. Uh SORRY,

405
00:24:44.469 --> 00:24:48.270
why evolution does not occur, or why adaptation does,

406
00:24:48.469 --> 00:24:52.550
does not arise. Um, THE, the kind of thinking

407
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:57.339
that we often encounter is that, you know, Traits

408
00:24:57.339 --> 00:25:00.609
are either possible to produce in development or not.

409
00:25:00.859 --> 00:25:02.939
They're not possible to produce. That's because of developmental

410
00:25:02.939 --> 00:25:05.819
constraints, and that explains why we don't have, you

411
00:25:05.819 --> 00:25:08.979
know, humans with wings, for instance. You know, developmental

412
00:25:08.979 --> 00:25:13.030
biology, you know, never throws up humans with wings.

413
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.000
Um, SO because that's kind of impossible to produce

414
00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:18.979
for various reasons, then that's kind of a constraint

415
00:25:18.979 --> 00:25:21.349
that explains why we don't have that. But if

416
00:25:21.349 --> 00:25:23.000
you want to understand all the things we do

417
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.150
have, natural selection is the answer, right? That's the,

418
00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.729
that would be the traditional way of understanding it.

419
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.209
And the problem with that reasoning is it's. It's

420
00:25:34.209 --> 00:25:38.439
all or nothing. It's, it's categorical, you know, rather

421
00:25:38.439 --> 00:25:44.130
than thinking probabilistically about the likelihood of particular variation

422
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.920
being produced, which is actually much more realistic. And

423
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.000
when you think about things in probabilistic terms, that

424
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.040
there's certain patterns of variation that are far more

425
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:59.359
likely to arise than others. Then you can see

426
00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.300
that those developmental processes are not just providing an

427
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.219
explanation for the stuff that we don't have, they're

428
00:26:06.219 --> 00:26:09.060
also contributing to the explanation for the things that

429
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.739
we do have as well, like I explained with

430
00:26:11.739 --> 00:26:15.060
the example of the scrambled egg and uh consumption

431
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.270
in the, in the restaurant. Oh, to come back

432
00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:23.359
to your, you also asked about evolvability. So, um

433
00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:29.439
Evolvability refers to the ability of an organism to

434
00:26:29.439 --> 00:26:32.319
evolve, the capacity to evolve, or, you know, we

435
00:26:32.319 --> 00:26:35.989
can think more fine-grained about the capacity of the

436
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.430
traits of an organism to evolve. And what's been

437
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.869
quite interesting over recent years is the, is the

438
00:26:42.869 --> 00:26:48.469
observation that, that, um, organisms vary in how good

439
00:26:48.469 --> 00:26:52.329
they are evolving. And um Even if we look

440
00:26:52.329 --> 00:26:54.449
in the single organism, we can see a considerable

441
00:26:54.449 --> 00:27:00.119
variation in how, Likely their traits are to evolve,

442
00:27:00.229 --> 00:27:03.449
so. There's been a lot of research into this

443
00:27:03.449 --> 00:27:07.449
in, in recent years, both empirical and theoretical, and

444
00:27:07.449 --> 00:27:10.650
these studies show quite clearly that the capacity to

445
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:15.939
evolve can itself evolve over time. Um, AND that

446
00:27:15.939 --> 00:27:21.489
as organisms, um, you know, as they evolve, um.

447
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.250
They will encounter certain features in their environments, certain

448
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:31.949
patterns of variation, and will produce outputs that either

449
00:27:31.949 --> 00:27:35.680
satisfy those, those requirements for the environment or, or

450
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.670
don't, and this will lead to selection on the

451
00:27:39.109 --> 00:27:44.390
relationships between traits. It will lead to Um, plyotropy,

452
00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.260
it will lead to epistoic interactions such that combinations

453
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.900
of traits that um are usefully produced together and

454
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.020
more readily produced, combinations of traits that are uh

455
00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:00.250
less usefully put together, um, are less reliably produced,

456
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.250
um. And the net result is you end up

457
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.650
with some traits being more evolvable than others. Um

458
00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:10.630
Again, let me try and give you an example

459
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:16.040
to, to make it more concrete. So imagine, imagine

460
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.839
you have a A quadruped, an animal with four

461
00:28:20.839 --> 00:28:25.180
legs. Um, AND mutations could arise in any one

462
00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:30.729
of those, um. Legs which would lengthen it or

463
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:35.530
shorten it. But of course, if you have uh

464
00:28:35.609 --> 00:28:39.329
uh an animal with three legs that are longer

465
00:28:39.329 --> 00:28:42.890
than one, or one leg that's longer than the

466
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:46.510
others, um, you know, that's not particularly useful variation.

467
00:28:47.229 --> 00:28:54.060
And so, um, We can envisage that um. Over

468
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.579
long periods of time, uh, natural selection will favor,

469
00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:02.890
um, mutations that lead to epiststatic interactions that, that

470
00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:07.459
reinforce symmetry between the legs that, uh, that eradicate

471
00:29:07.459 --> 00:29:11.900
the, um, you know, the, the situations where um

472
00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.339
asymmetries arise and, and, and robustly produce symmetry, with

473
00:29:16.339 --> 00:29:19.339
favor plyotropy, so that any change in the, you

474
00:29:19.339 --> 00:29:21.979
know, in the characteristics of a leg will also

475
00:29:21.979 --> 00:29:25.829
affect other legs. And so that gradually over time,

476
00:29:26.189 --> 00:29:31.630
the likelihood of a mutation producing asymmetric asymmetrical length

477
00:29:31.859 --> 00:29:35.839
would be reduced. Now, mutations are still occurring at

478
00:29:35.839 --> 00:29:39.829
random, even after that long period of time. And

479
00:29:39.829 --> 00:29:42.310
they can still increase the length of the legs

480
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:46.109
or decreases the length of the legs, independently of

481
00:29:46.109 --> 00:29:48.229
what would be beneficial for the organism in that

482
00:29:48.229 --> 00:29:51.349
environment. So it's not on demand as such. But

483
00:29:51.349 --> 00:29:55.829
nonetheless, variation that's kind of been useful in the

484
00:29:55.829 --> 00:29:59.469
past, that's got that symmetrical quality, is favored is

485
00:29:59.469 --> 00:30:03.859
much more evolvable. It's much easier to evolve symmetrical

486
00:30:03.859 --> 00:30:07.939
characters over time, that will change more quickly than.

487
00:30:09.459 --> 00:30:15.300
Variation that generates asymmetrical correspondences between the legs. Those

488
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.660
will be far less likely to arise and will

489
00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.849
be less evolvable. So you can see how, you

490
00:30:21.849 --> 00:30:23.719
know, it's a sort of hypothetical example, but it

491
00:30:23.719 --> 00:30:27.869
illustrates how these combinations between traits can arise over

492
00:30:27.869 --> 00:30:31.390
time to produce variation that fits with what was

493
00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:32.729
useful in the past.

494
00:30:34.469 --> 00:30:37.880
Great, but uh uh then there's an important question

495
00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.520
to ask here, I guess. In regards to the

496
00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:45.680
developmental processes themselves, where do they stem from? Are

497
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.229
they the result of natural selection?

498
00:30:50.369 --> 00:30:52.420
Yeah, that's a really, that's a really good question.

499
00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.010
I, I, I think in a way it's a

500
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.750
kind of key hang up for many people um

501
00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:01.390
in, in embracing the kind of developmental perspective that

502
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.109
um that I and my co-authors advocate in the

503
00:31:04.109 --> 00:31:10.890
book. um. The The way of thinking that's um

504
00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:15.000
is very widespread and um Is a kind of

505
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.439
mental block to embracing it is, is that, you

506
00:31:17.439 --> 00:31:23.050
know, we will, we will happily. Explain developmental bias

507
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.369
through earlier natural selection. So if we see that

508
00:31:26.369 --> 00:31:29.209
there's developmental bias taking place, there's a bias in

509
00:31:29.209 --> 00:31:32.420
the production of the phenotypic variation to produce certain

510
00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.390
forms more readily than others, we'll say, oh well,

511
00:31:34.489 --> 00:31:37.209
the reason we have that is because of early

512
00:31:37.209 --> 00:31:41.790
and natural selection. And they'll stop there. That what

513
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:45.310
they won't consider is that that early natural selection

514
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:49.349
was also subject to biased developmental variation. And in

515
00:31:49.349 --> 00:31:51.469
fact, you could trace it back all the way

516
00:31:51.469 --> 00:31:53.829
to the beginning of life, and it always be

517
00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:57.930
biased developmental variation, which would be subject to natural

518
00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:02.939
selection. There's actually a reciprocal causal relationship between these,

519
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:06.670
these characters. There's biased variation being produced in development.

520
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.839
And then natural selection occurs on that bias, sorting

521
00:32:10.839 --> 00:32:13.880
between that bias variation, influencing the bias in the

522
00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.040
next generation. Um, AND so we have to think

523
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.880
about things in this reciprocal causal way, and, um,

524
00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.079
and that means we can account for the patterns

525
00:32:24.079 --> 00:32:26.390
of variation that we see in nature in terms

526
00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:29.930
of these dual processes, natural selection and developmental bias,

527
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.359
rather than tracing everything back to natural selection. And

528
00:32:34.359 --> 00:32:36.599
that that I think is the logical distinction. Now

529
00:32:36.599 --> 00:32:39.199
you're going to a linear causal model as opposed

530
00:32:39.199 --> 00:32:41.439
to a uh a reciprocal causal model.

531
00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:47.589
Could you explain the phenomenon of plasticity lab evolution

532
00:32:47.589 --> 00:32:51.750
or the ways by which developmental responses to environmental

533
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.680
change can direct genetic change?

534
00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.680
Sure, yeah. So this, um, this is an idea

535
00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.229
that's come to prominence in, in recent years through

536
00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:05.199
the important work of Mary Jane West Eberhart, um,

537
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:07.430
who published a, a, a now classic volume in

538
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:12.020
2003, Developmental Plasticity and Evolution, and, and, you know,

539
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.969
It's a very, very rich book indeed, but one

540
00:33:15.969 --> 00:33:17.689
thing that people have sort of latched on to

541
00:33:17.689 --> 00:33:20.770
is her suggestion that genes can be followers rather

542
00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:24.609
than leaders in evolution, that, that, um, organisms can

543
00:33:24.609 --> 00:33:29.209
respond to environmental challenges plastically through changes in their

544
00:33:29.209 --> 00:33:35.400
development, which adjust their behavior, their phenotype, their traits

545
00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:40.209
to the environmental conditions. And then subsequently over many

546
00:33:40.209 --> 00:33:44.050
generations, um, that can be stabilized through genetic change.

547
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.739
So plasticity comes first, subsequently, genetic change occurs. So

548
00:33:48.739 --> 00:33:54.609
that's the The basic idea Um, an example that

549
00:33:54.609 --> 00:33:59.219
we use in the book concerns, um, blind Mexican

550
00:33:59.219 --> 00:34:05.020
cavefish. Astanics uh Mexican. Uh, SO, um, these are

551
00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:11.100
really fascinating. And when, when these fish were first

552
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.938
discovered in the 1930s, um, they looked so strikingly

553
00:34:14.938 --> 00:34:18.540
different from, from all known fishes, that they were,

554
00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:22.659
they were classified as entirely new genes. Only for

555
00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:26.458
subsequent, you know, sites to establish that the sighted

556
00:34:26.458 --> 00:34:30.168
versions of the same species. We're incredibly widespread in

557
00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:33.760
the rivers and streams of, of Mexico and and

558
00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:40.489
Southern USA. And Um, it's since been established that

559
00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.739
there are about 35, um, at the last count.

560
00:34:44.779 --> 00:34:51.299
Independent evolving populations of these blind Mexican cavefish. They

561
00:34:51.299 --> 00:34:55.099
all have a very similar suite of traits. They're

562
00:34:55.099 --> 00:34:58.979
typically, of course, um blind or eyeless, and they

563
00:34:58.979 --> 00:35:02.229
will have um changes in the pigmentation, they'll be

564
00:35:02.229 --> 00:35:05.858
quite white. Um, BUT a whole suite of changes,

565
00:35:05.979 --> 00:35:09.850
changes in In their uh bone structure, in their

566
00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:13.850
metabolism, in their behavior, all kinds of things. And

567
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:18.770
also some really, uh, you know, intriguing features like

568
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:23.850
virtually all the populations have got fragmented bones in

569
00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:28.419
their faces. Literally broken up bones. And, you know,

570
00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.820
the researchers who study this have this sort of

571
00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:35.659
puzzled by, um, you know, why is it that

572
00:35:35.659 --> 00:35:39.149
they should all have this, this feature? It seems

573
00:35:39.699 --> 00:35:44.060
so random and it's hard to understand rifasi, why

574
00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:49.300
they should have this, this, um. You know, not

575
00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.300
obviously beneficial, probably an adaptive characteristic and why it

576
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.810
should repeatedly have evolve. The fact that it repeatedly

577
00:35:55.810 --> 00:36:00.120
evolves suggests that some, some adaptive value. So there

578
00:36:00.129 --> 00:36:02.530
there there's a, there's a suite of, of traits

579
00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:06.729
associated with blind Mexican cavefish, but some are a

580
00:36:06.729 --> 00:36:11.600
little bit sort of odd and um. Light was

581
00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.919
thrown on the issue when um a, a, a

582
00:36:15.919 --> 00:36:20.149
team of researchers took the river fish, the, the,

583
00:36:20.159 --> 00:36:23.719
the, the sighted versions of the same species, and

584
00:36:23.719 --> 00:36:25.600
reared them in the dark and the cold to

585
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.560
simulate sort of cave being thrust into the cave

586
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:34.959
environment. And the offspring of those uh fish. Developed

587
00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:39.149
a suite of characteristics that is strikingly similar to

588
00:36:39.149 --> 00:36:45.419
the blind Mexican cavefish that derived them. And um,

589
00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:51.260
If you look at which traits change in response

590
00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:54.500
to the dark and the cold. They're the same

591
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.209
kind of traits as we see have evolved in

592
00:36:57.209 --> 00:37:00.409
the derived form of the fish, and they respond

593
00:37:00.409 --> 00:37:04.540
to the dark and the cold, often by producing

594
00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.969
increased phenotypic variation. And if as researchers have done,

595
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.530
you select on some of that increased inaction, you

596
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.290
see a response to selection in the same direction.

597
00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:21.040
So, um. That those kind of studies, um, and,

598
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:25.600
you know, various other kinds of experimentation. Present, I

599
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.189
think, a very strong case that what has happened

600
00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:32.379
in, in these fishes is that um they they

601
00:37:32.379 --> 00:37:36.090
respond initially to this, to this challenge of being

602
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:41.699
in a very dark, cold place, um. Classically, through

603
00:37:41.699 --> 00:37:46.020
the, through the developmental change, and then gradually over

604
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.459
time, that becomes stabilized and you get refinements through

605
00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:54.169
through genetic evolution. And some of the odd features

606
00:37:54.169 --> 00:37:57.969
like the um like the broken up bones, it

607
00:37:57.969 --> 00:38:01.010
turns out, you know, that you can then start

608
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:03.770
to understand why they have those features because there's

609
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:07.129
a strong correlation between the, the number of neuromasts

610
00:38:07.129 --> 00:38:10.000
that they have, which are these cells which allow

611
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.209
them to detect water currents, which is really important

612
00:38:12.209 --> 00:38:14.370
if you're foraging in the dark, and you know,

613
00:38:14.409 --> 00:38:17.560
this fragmentation. So, so certain things come to light

614
00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.969
when you take this, this developmental perspective. Mhm.

615
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:25.820
You've done work on niche construction specifically, so could

616
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.580
you tell us about it? What is niche construction?

617
00:38:29.659 --> 00:38:33.979
Each construction is uh the capacity of organisms to

618
00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:38.620
modify their environments and thereby sort of modify the

619
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.060
natural selection that that their population experiences. And it,

620
00:38:42.129 --> 00:38:44.050
and this is a very sort of obvious and

621
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:47.449
prosaic thing that, you know, every kid knows that

622
00:38:47.449 --> 00:38:51.739
birds construct nests, as do, you know, as do

623
00:38:51.739 --> 00:38:54.459
fishes, um, you know, the ants and bees will

624
00:38:54.459 --> 00:38:59.310
construct mounds and um and and that. Not just,

625
00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.739
um, you know, artifacts, you'll see in, everybody knows

626
00:39:02.739 --> 00:39:06.709
that, you know, plants are modifying, um, wind speeds

627
00:39:06.709 --> 00:39:10.969
and, and, um, you know, affecting shade and, and,

628
00:39:10.979 --> 00:39:13.580
um, playing a role in the, in the, in

629
00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:17.020
the hydrological cycle, the cycling of nutrients and so

630
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.389
on and so forth. So. In to a greater

631
00:39:19.389 --> 00:39:22.530
and lesser degree, of course, all organisms will modify

632
00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:26.050
their local environments and sometimes this will feedback to

633
00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:33.530
influence the selection that they experienced. And um, From

634
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:37.209
a traditional perspective, no, no one would kind of

635
00:39:37.209 --> 00:39:39.699
dispute that that goes on, but, but, you know,

636
00:39:39.929 --> 00:39:42.719
people don't really see that niche construction as playing

637
00:39:42.969 --> 00:39:47.250
causal role in evolution. Um, IT'S something that has

638
00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:50.850
evolved, that we can understand as having evolved through

639
00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:54.399
natural selection, an interesting feature of the organisms, but

640
00:39:54.399 --> 00:39:57.449
we don't see it as part of the process.

641
00:39:57.489 --> 00:40:00.330
It's not part of our explanation for how or

642
00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.689
whether or the nature of the evolution that takes

643
00:40:02.689 --> 00:40:06.199
place. But let me go back to an example

644
00:40:06.199 --> 00:40:08.879
to illustrate why it might be better if we

645
00:40:08.879 --> 00:40:11.389
thought about niche construction as playing a causal role.

646
00:40:11.639 --> 00:40:14.360
Um, I'll go back to the example I talked

647
00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.840
about of the dung beetles, because of these dung

648
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.800
beetles are kind of classic niche constructors. When the

649
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.610
mother builds that brood ball out of dung. Um,

650
00:40:23.699 --> 00:40:25.429
AND when she inserts the egg in it and

651
00:40:25.429 --> 00:40:28.469
adds in her little pedestal, which contains her a

652
00:40:28.469 --> 00:40:31.870
symbiance, and when she buries it underground, where it's

653
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:35.550
in a sort of safe, thermally buffered environment, that's

654
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:40.389
niche construction on her part. Um, AND when the

655
00:40:40.389 --> 00:40:44.729
offspring. Consumes the pedestal and mixes the materials and

656
00:40:44.729 --> 00:40:49.209
builds a pupation chamber, and distributes the symbiots in

657
00:40:49.209 --> 00:40:51.770
ways that allow them to process the, um, you

658
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:54.209
know, the carbon nutrients, make them available for its

659
00:40:54.209 --> 00:40:57.709
own growth. That is also niche construction, niche construction

660
00:40:57.709 --> 00:41:03.550
on part of the larvae. And What experimenters were

661
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.760
able to show, who, you know, who have carried

662
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.959
out experiments that either allow that niche construction to

663
00:41:09.959 --> 00:41:12.360
take place or prevent it from taking place and

664
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.479
allow that comparison, is that not only does, does

665
00:41:16.479 --> 00:41:19.399
the niche construction make a critical difference to the

666
00:41:19.399 --> 00:41:24.080
development of individual organisms, which traits evolve. But it

667
00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:30.570
affects which traits become statistically associated with other traits.

668
00:41:30.649 --> 00:41:35.280
So it generates new clusters of traits. For instance,

669
00:41:35.679 --> 00:41:38.929
these constructing traits on both the mother and the,

670
00:41:38.939 --> 00:41:44.409
and the larvi's part, get, gets statistically associated and

671
00:41:44.409 --> 00:41:50.500
subsequently co-evolve with traits that respond plastically to the

672
00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:55.750
constructed environment. Yeah, so things like um horn length,

673
00:41:55.959 --> 00:41:59.219
and it's very contingent on the, on the um

674
00:41:59.219 --> 00:42:03.899
activities of the organ and constructing activities. So the

675
00:42:03.899 --> 00:42:11.360
cluster of traits that's Most significantly associated with biological

676
00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:16.500
fitness. Changes as a result of this niche construction.

677
00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:21.149
What that means is through their niche construction, organisms

678
00:42:21.149 --> 00:42:25.310
are affecting the direction that natural selection takes. Yeah,

679
00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:28.060
so which, what, what the niche construction is doing

680
00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.719
is effectively shifting. The traits that are associated with

681
00:42:31.719 --> 00:42:35.840
biological fitness and therefore modifying the direction of natural

682
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.149
selection. That's something that we need to take account

683
00:42:39.149 --> 00:42:42.709
of if we want to understand how a population

684
00:42:42.709 --> 00:42:45.320
will evolve and and get a better understanding on

685
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.229
why it evolves in the way that it does.

686
00:42:47.479 --> 00:42:48.919
I mean, I think part of the, part of

687
00:42:48.919 --> 00:42:52.669
the problem historically has been that evolutionary biologists, when

688
00:42:52.669 --> 00:42:57.360
we, when we um seek to understand evolution. We'll

689
00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:02.399
kind of start with selection pressures. We'll, um, we'll.

690
00:43:03.229 --> 00:43:06.149
Examine a system in a laboratory or, or in,

691
00:43:06.189 --> 00:43:10.209
in, uh, in nature, and we'll find that uh

692
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:13.110
this genotype has got higher fitness and that genotype,

693
00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.340
and then we'll come up with an evolutionary explanation

694
00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.949
retrospectively for why that should be. But we, our

695
00:43:17.949 --> 00:43:21.629
analysis starts with, with, with fitness differences, and then

696
00:43:21.629 --> 00:43:25.110
when we know there's fitness differences, fitness differences, we

697
00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:27.270
can make predictions about how traits will evolve and

698
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:30.020
what, what the outcomes will be. But we tend

699
00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:33.570
not to ask. Where did those fitness differences come

700
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:37.020
from? And so what a developmental perspective can give

701
00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:40.340
us is an answer to that question. In this

702
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:44.489
case, the niche construction was really critical for creating

703
00:43:44.699 --> 00:43:46.419
those selection pressures.

704
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.469
So, could you tell us about the concept of

705
00:43:50.469 --> 00:43:54.780
dynamic adaptive landscapes and why it is important in

706
00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.330
the context of your book?

707
00:43:57.090 --> 00:44:03.659
Mhm. Yeah, so, um, adaptive landscapes are a kind

708
00:44:03.659 --> 00:44:09.139
of, um, conceptual tool, um, that evolutionary biologists use

709
00:44:09.139 --> 00:44:12.250
to, to think about and sometimes also to sort

710
00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:19.209
of model, um, biological evolution. And often, oftentimes they'll

711
00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:24.219
envisage, um, a, a surface, like a landscape, which,

712
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.000
um, you know, if you think in three dimensions,

713
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.199
you could have two dimensions, the X and Y

714
00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:32.320
axis, if you like, which represent two different traits

715
00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.879
or different, two different genotypes, and then the, the

716
00:44:35.879 --> 00:44:40.060
vertical axis would represent the fitness. And so you

717
00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:43.810
can plot, uh, uh, uh, um, you know, a

718
00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:49.179
population of individuals on that surface. And, um, if

719
00:44:49.179 --> 00:44:51.500
you know the, the values of the traits of

720
00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.879
that individual with respect to those two dimensions, uh,

721
00:44:54.939 --> 00:44:57.219
uh, you can see where they are at any

722
00:44:57.219 --> 00:44:59.820
point in time, and you predict that they would

723
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.850
move up this fitness service to the highest fitness

724
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:05.699
point, or at least that's the, the traditional expectation.

725
00:45:06.979 --> 00:45:11.300
But what's uh recent research, particularly studying sort of

726
00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:15.110
developmental bias, but also um plasticity and niche construction

727
00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:19.159
has shown Um, you know, formal mathematical models has

728
00:45:19.159 --> 00:45:23.479
established that, um, these assumptions that you can always

729
00:45:23.479 --> 00:45:26.399
travel up to the sort of, um, local fitness

730
00:45:26.399 --> 00:45:29.479
peak is, um, there's not always occurred, it's not

731
00:45:29.479 --> 00:45:33.360
always realized because of the developmental bias in the

732
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:38.000
system. And what, what developmental processes are doing is

733
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.760
effectively creating, um, viable pathways across that landscape. So

734
00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.679
what natural section actually does is push populations along

735
00:45:49.679 --> 00:45:55.760
paths created by developmental processes. And what other developmental

736
00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:59.239
processes like plasticity, like niche construction are doing is

737
00:45:59.239 --> 00:46:03.520
deforming the surface so that as the populations evolve,

738
00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.290
that static, that surface is not static. It's, it's

739
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:11.530
dynamic and, um, you know, hills might appear, or,

740
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:14.870
or dips in the surface might appear as a

741
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:18.429
result of the organism's own activities, which will influence

742
00:46:18.429 --> 00:46:22.100
the direction of its evolution. So we need to

743
00:46:22.389 --> 00:46:25.550
take account of these developmental factors again, if we're

744
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:29.010
going to understand the um adaptive evolution of the

745
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:29.459
population.

746
00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:35.120
And in what ways can development contribute to evolutionary

747
00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:35.929
innovation?

748
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:41.129
Well, um, the, the most, uh, there are a

749
00:46:41.129 --> 00:46:44.010
number of ways, um, the, the, the most obvious,

750
00:46:44.169 --> 00:46:47.810
um, way I've, I've already briefly mentioned, which is

751
00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:52.060
that there's this. There's this modular structure to development,

752
00:46:52.139 --> 00:46:57.790
and what that effectively represents is, is pre-established bits

753
00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.949
of useful kit that can be, that can be

754
00:47:00.949 --> 00:47:05.030
reused and repurposed for, for, for new roles in

755
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:08.340
uh in uh uh development and in evolution. So,

756
00:47:08.669 --> 00:47:13.850
um. I mentioned the example of the origins of

757
00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:16.550
insect wings, which are thought to have evolved by

758
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:19.879
reusing some of the circuitry associated with the production

759
00:47:19.879 --> 00:47:22.639
of insect legs. You can then go further and

760
00:47:22.639 --> 00:47:25.379
say, you know, where did beetle horns come from?

761
00:47:25.389 --> 00:47:29.159
Well, beetle horns actually came through the repurposing of

762
00:47:29.159 --> 00:47:31.919
some of the, you know, regulatory circuitry that underlie

763
00:47:31.919 --> 00:47:35.504
the Development of, of, of, of insect wings. So,

764
00:47:35.574 --> 00:47:38.544
you know, all the time, you're sort of reusing

765
00:47:38.544 --> 00:47:43.625
these, these pre-established, um, tools, these circuits, these, um,

766
00:47:43.784 --> 00:47:47.625
you know, networks, which have got, you know, useful

767
00:47:47.625 --> 00:47:50.334
functions. You don't have to do everything from scratch.

768
00:47:50.544 --> 00:47:53.745
Um, AND one consequence of that is it's a

769
00:47:53.745 --> 00:47:58.955
further introduction of developmental bias into the system, because

770
00:47:59.185 --> 00:48:03.050
if you're using the same bit of kit, Again

771
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:06.729
and again, then any mutations that occur, any changes

772
00:48:06.729 --> 00:48:09.649
in the operation of those will affect multiple traits

773
00:48:09.649 --> 00:48:13.679
or multiple functionalities in the organism, and so biases

774
00:48:13.679 --> 00:48:17.010
arise in, in the evolution of the system.

775
00:48:18.639 --> 00:48:21.320
And, uh, I mean, this is an additional question.

776
00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:26.570
Can, adding a developmental perspective to evolutionary biology also

777
00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:31.969
help understand how certain traits vary in different ways

778
00:48:31.969 --> 00:48:33.570
across different lineages.

779
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:40.449
Um, uh, YES, I mean, I, I, I. I

780
00:48:40.449 --> 00:48:43.429
think one has to think about things from a,

781
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:48.649
a, a species specific uh perspective because, as I

782
00:48:48.649 --> 00:48:52.090
mentioned earlier, the characteristics of the individual organism will

783
00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:56.620
determine. Um, YOU know, how this system will evolve

784
00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:02.070
and the nature of the evolutionary dynamic. So. One

785
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:05.350
of the, one of the consequences of the, the

786
00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:07.909
sort of traditional view that natural selection is just

787
00:49:07.909 --> 00:49:13.939
natural selection, you know, if, if um if The

788
00:49:13.939 --> 00:49:18.979
only thing that sort of Affects the production of

789
00:49:18.979 --> 00:49:23.219
phenotypic variation that matters in evolution is genetic mutation,

790
00:49:23.229 --> 00:49:26.169
and that occurs at random with respect to function,

791
00:49:26.459 --> 00:49:32.219
and if traits are inherited, Primarily through the transmission

792
00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:34.260
of genes in a passive way from parent to

793
00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:37.260
offspring without introducing any sort of biases in the

794
00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:42.709
transmission process, then, All the direction in adaptive evolution

795
00:49:42.709 --> 00:49:48.280
comes from. Differences in fitness between individuals in a

796
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:54.239
particular um environmental context. And that applies equally to

797
00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:59.840
fruit flies, yeast, mice, oak trees, and humans. We

798
00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:03.989
all evolve in the same way. Conversely, if you

799
00:50:03.989 --> 00:50:09.800
recognize, as we do. That developmental processes bias the

800
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:15.399
variation that's subject to natural selection. They Influence which

801
00:50:15.399 --> 00:50:18.540
cluster of traits is statistically associated with fitness and

802
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:23.739
therefore the direction of selection, and they, um, Affect

803
00:50:23.739 --> 00:50:27.280
the nature of inheritance. They change how traits are

804
00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:32.520
inherited from one generation to the next. Then Each

805
00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:39.030
trait of each organism involves in its own idiosyncratic

806
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:41.110
way, and you need to take account of that

807
00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:44.060
developmental knowledge in order to be able to understand

808
00:50:44.189 --> 00:50:47.270
the evolutionary dynamics of that system. And, you know,

809
00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:51.729
this is, I think, particular implications for Our understanding

810
00:50:51.729 --> 00:50:55.320
of human evolution because humans don't evolve like fruit

811
00:50:55.320 --> 00:51:00.939
flies and yeast, um, and, you know, For, for

812
00:51:00.939 --> 00:51:03.110
the, for the longest time, of course, there's been

813
00:51:03.699 --> 00:51:07.010
a great deal of conflict, particularly in North America,

814
00:51:07.419 --> 00:51:11.169
between evolutionary biologist and creationist kind of explanations, um,

815
00:51:12.419 --> 00:51:14.989
And, you know, this is a very complicated issue,

816
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.949
and there are multiple reasons for, um, you know,

817
00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:21.399
why people might sometimes be resistant to taking on

818
00:51:21.399 --> 00:51:24.979
board evolutionary explanations. But I think as, as a,

819
00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:27.949
um, you know, as a community of scientists, we

820
00:51:27.949 --> 00:51:31.500
have a responsibility to at least consider the possibility

821
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.939
that sometimes our explanations might appear a little bit

822
00:51:33.939 --> 00:51:37.520
thin. And if we're saying that humans evolve in

823
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.030
exactly the same way that used to evolved, that

824
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.679
might not be credible to many members of the

825
00:51:42.679 --> 00:51:47.709
public. Conversely, I think, if one recognizes that humans.

826
00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:51.419
Don't evolve in the same way as fruit flies

827
00:51:51.419 --> 00:51:54.580
and, and oak trees, because, you know, we develop

828
00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.580
differently because we interact with the world differently and

829
00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:03.979
because we inherit valuable resources differently, then it potentially

830
00:52:03.979 --> 00:52:07.699
leads us to richer explanations for human evolution.

831
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:11.989
So talking about humans, I would like to explore

832
00:52:11.989 --> 00:52:15.750
now an example of our development and extra genetic

833
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:19.179
inheritance applied to humans. So, could you tell us

834
00:52:19.179 --> 00:52:22.949
about the evolution of the human brain and cognition?

835
00:52:24.159 --> 00:52:30.129
Uh, SURE. Um, So, I guess the, uh, you

836
00:52:30.129 --> 00:52:32.050
know, the, the, the thing that's really, really striking

837
00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:35.320
about the human brain compared with other primates is

838
00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:39.570
it's, its sheer size. It's, um, it's 3 times

839
00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:43.649
the size of chimpanzees, 3 times the number of

840
00:52:43.649 --> 00:52:50.010
neurons, roughly speaking. And you know, the relationship between

841
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:56.129
Um, brain size and cognitive capability is a very

842
00:52:56.129 --> 00:53:00.689
complicated one, which, you know, it's probably beyond the

843
00:53:00.689 --> 00:53:04.239
realms of this conversation to sort of go into.

844
00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:06.409
Um, BUT, you know, I think it's fair enough

845
00:53:06.409 --> 00:53:10.409
to say other things being held equal, if we're

846
00:53:10.409 --> 00:53:15.169
not making comparisons across vastly different taxonomic groups where

847
00:53:15.169 --> 00:53:18.449
the brains are organized in very different ways. Um,

848
00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.169
YOU know, by and large, you've got a bigger

849
00:53:21.169 --> 00:53:25.189
brain, it allows you more processing power, more neurons

850
00:53:25.639 --> 00:53:29.850
lead to. Greater processing power, other things being held

851
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:32.689
equal, but there's a catch when it comes to.

852
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:38.429
That, which is the brains are incredibly expensive organs,

853
00:53:38.639 --> 00:53:42.229
um, you know, there's a huge energy budget associated

854
00:53:42.229 --> 00:53:46.179
with, Um, the, the human brain, which humans are

855
00:53:46.179 --> 00:53:49.229
willing to pay, but other apes and other primates,

856
00:53:49.379 --> 00:53:51.620
by and large do not pay, even though they,

857
00:53:51.719 --> 00:53:54.169
they themselves often have very large brains relative to

858
00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:57.520
other mammals. So that raises the question of how,

859
00:53:57.639 --> 00:53:59.280
how have we been possible, how has it been

860
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:04.389
possible for humans to afford this big brain? Well,

861
00:54:04.429 --> 00:54:06.909
where does the energy come from? It comes from

862
00:54:06.909 --> 00:54:13.040
food. We get our food. By foraging and In

863
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:19.379
order to Evolve a larger brain. An organism would

864
00:54:19.379 --> 00:54:26.719
have to either forage more efficiently. Or make savings

865
00:54:26.719 --> 00:54:31.100
in other tissues. That, um, allow it to invest

866
00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:34.770
more of its energy budget in its brain. Now

867
00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:36.610
humans have been able to do both, they've been

868
00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:40.090
able to do both because they have this extraordinary

869
00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:42.610
capacity for extra genetic inheritance in the form of

870
00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:48.899
our culture. Um So, if one looks at um

871
00:54:49.149 --> 00:54:53.469
primates in general, particularly gray apes, but also particularly

872
00:54:53.469 --> 00:54:58.790
humans, we see that the um The the really

873
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:03.629
um. High return foods that are consumed, the high

874
00:55:03.629 --> 00:55:08.229
energy budget foods. Often require a great deal of

875
00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:13.399
um um resource to, to capture, to process in

876
00:55:13.399 --> 00:55:16.000
various ways, and then to consume. So, you know,

877
00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.520
think of, think of nuts they've got protective shells,

878
00:55:19.639 --> 00:55:22.360
think of invertebrates that, you know, need to be

879
00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.070
caught. Think of vertebrates are even more challenging to,

880
00:55:25.199 --> 00:55:29.159
to catch, um think of resources like honey, where

881
00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:30.840
a whole series of steps that you have to

882
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.739
engage in in order to access it in an

883
00:55:32.739 --> 00:55:34.840
effective way without getting stung to death and so

884
00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:39.040
on. Um, SO that What's actually really well established,

885
00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:42.030
I think, and from studies of, um, you know,

886
00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:48.239
um, behavioral development in primates is that these um

887
00:55:48.239 --> 00:55:51.959
more challenging foods to acquire, but which are energy

888
00:55:51.959 --> 00:55:56.919
rich, are typically learned socially. Animals, um, in primates

889
00:55:56.919 --> 00:56:00.310
acquire these skills through imitation and other forms of

890
00:56:00.469 --> 00:56:04.909
observational learning. And, uh, and there's actually legions of

891
00:56:04.909 --> 00:56:07.830
evidence that that supports that claim now across a

892
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:12.590
broad range of species, including humans. And um We

893
00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:16.149
can see, if we take a comparative perspective, uh,

894
00:56:16.159 --> 00:56:19.750
correlations between the breadth of an animal's diet, the

895
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:22.510
richness of an animal's diet, the extent of its

896
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:24.989
reliance on social learning, the extent of which reliance

897
00:56:24.989 --> 00:56:27.270
on tools, because often to acquire these foods, you

898
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:30.389
have to use tools, um, the extent of extractive

899
00:56:30.389 --> 00:56:35.290
foraging. These traits, this cluster of traits. Um, TENDS

900
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:38.850
to have co-evolved again, we see evidence for developmental

901
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:42.169
bias that cluster of traits co-evolving. So you've got

902
00:56:42.169 --> 00:56:45.649
smart primates like chimpanzees and orangutans, of course, humans

903
00:56:45.649 --> 00:56:48.090
fall into that bracket who are good at all

904
00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:50.169
of those things, good at tools, good at social

905
00:56:50.169 --> 00:56:54.179
learning, good at extractive foraging, very broad diets, um,

906
00:56:54.219 --> 00:56:58.689
and other, um, primates, no nocturnal prosimians, for instance,

907
00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:01.050
that are less good at, at all, all of

908
00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:06.250
those things. So, um, what's going on, so that's

909
00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:08.129
a more cognitive side. So what's going on with

910
00:57:08.129 --> 00:57:11.370
the brain? Well, um, actually you can, it turns

911
00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:13.489
out you can make sense of quite a lot

912
00:57:13.489 --> 00:57:18.959
of the variation in brain size across primates. Through

913
00:57:20.439 --> 00:57:23.639
Including, you know, variation in the individual components of

914
00:57:23.639 --> 00:57:27.439
the brain through variation in the, um, in, in

915
00:57:27.439 --> 00:57:30.909
the whole brain size. Yeah. So the whole brain

916
00:57:30.909 --> 00:57:33.530
evolves in a concerted way, either sort of get,

917
00:57:33.679 --> 00:57:36.800
or gets bigger or gets smaller, and that typically

918
00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.080
happens through extending the period of neurogenesis. You just

919
00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.550
kind of cook the brain for longer in development,

920
00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.709
and that means that certain structures like the neo

921
00:57:45.709 --> 00:57:49.820
uh neocortex and the, uh, and various other Um,

922
00:57:50.139 --> 00:57:55.199
um. Teachers get proportion disproportionately large. So, so the

923
00:57:55.199 --> 00:57:57.439
point I was going to make was the, the

924
00:57:57.439 --> 00:58:04.239
um the capacity. To, um, To grow that brain

925
00:58:04.929 --> 00:58:10.030
is critically reliant on culturally acquired knowledge without that

926
00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:13.679
form of extra genetic inheritance. You wouldn't be able

927
00:58:13.679 --> 00:58:16.280
to generate the energy to cook that brain for

928
00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:19.600
longer and support such a large brain, but then

929
00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:22.239
once you have that large brain, it provides you

930
00:58:22.239 --> 00:58:27.290
with the cognitive processing power. To support all of

931
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:31.850
the complex learning and behavior that you're utilizing in

932
00:58:31.850 --> 00:58:35.000
a sort of, uh, you know, dynamical feedback way.

933
00:58:35.729 --> 00:58:38.449
So, um, that's one side. But then there's also

934
00:58:38.449 --> 00:58:41.050
this developmental bias, which is, which is playing a

935
00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:43.770
role and showing how the brain areas are evolve

936
00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:46.850
evolve in a concerted way, and that, that, that

937
00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:50.330
similar kind of um co-evolution of traits is occurring

938
00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:53.389
at the behavioral level. And then when it comes

939
00:58:53.389 --> 00:58:58.399
to um The way we process our foods, we

940
00:58:58.399 --> 00:59:00.760
cook our food, we chop our food, we mash

941
00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:04.199
our food, we pound our foods, and all of

942
00:59:04.199 --> 00:59:09.820
those activities are. Uh, IN various different ways, breaking

943
00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:14.629
down the proteins and making the food, um. Easier

944
00:59:14.629 --> 00:59:19.000
to extract the nutrients and the resources. We're effectively

945
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.820
externalizing part of the digestive process, and because we've

946
00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:28.790
externalized the digestive process, We don't need such large

947
00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:33.030
guts in order to, to, um, you know, to

948
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:36.030
process the foods that we consume internally, and so

949
00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:38.070
we can make energy savings on a gut that

950
00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:40.270
can be invested in our brains. So what has

951
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:44.459
happened is effectively, you know, we, through our culture

952
00:59:44.459 --> 00:59:49.350
and through our developmental bias, have shifted the balance

953
00:59:49.350 --> 00:59:55.320
from a primate that was um Relying on a

954
00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:58.699
relatively large gut and a relatively small brain. To

955
00:59:58.699 --> 01:00:00.939
a primate that is reliant on a relatively large

956
01:00:00.939 --> 01:00:02.179
brain and relatively small gum.

957
01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.860
Great. So I have one last question I would

958
01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.419
like to ask you. I know that you are

959
01:00:08.419 --> 01:00:12.260
a proponent, a proponent of the extended evolutionary synthesis.

960
01:00:12.379 --> 01:00:14.899
So, could you tell us about that and what

961
01:00:14.899 --> 01:00:18.620
are the main differences between the modern evolutionary synthesis

962
01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:22.379
and the extended evolutionary synthesis and in what ways

963
01:00:22.379 --> 01:00:26.300
do you think basically that evolutionary theory needs to

964
01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:27.340
be reframed?

965
01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:34.310
Sure, so, um The extended evolutionary synthesis you can

966
01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:36.750
think of as, as, uh, just another way to

967
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:40.699
think about evolution. It's a conceptual framework. It's um

968
01:00:41.229 --> 01:00:45.590
perhaps best thought of as a, a revised structure

969
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:49.510
or understanding to how, um, how, how we explain

970
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:56.510
evolution, um, as I described earlier, the traditional way

971
01:00:56.510 --> 01:01:00.520
of thinking about evolution, the, the way That's dominated

972
01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.689
evolutionary biology for um at least 100 years, has

973
01:01:04.689 --> 01:01:07.879
been very sort of gene-centric, gene-focused, that's to say,

974
01:01:07.889 --> 01:01:10.090
of course, we, that, you know, what evolutionary biologists

975
01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:12.610
don't study phenotypes, of course, they do, they study

976
01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:14.449
the traits of organisms in a variety of different

977
01:01:14.449 --> 01:01:18.530
ways, but the explanations that they give, um, you

978
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:21.429
know, are heavily reliant on genes and gene frequency

979
01:01:21.429 --> 01:01:25.610
change. Evolution is change in gene frequencies, um, that's

980
01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:31.179
how it's Often defined, um, we track evolution through

981
01:01:31.179 --> 01:01:35.219
population genetic models or quantitative genetic models. So genes,

982
01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:38.510
um, and they change over time or how we

983
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:43.570
make sense of interpret evolution. And the um extended

984
01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:47.239
evolutionary synthesis you can view as one of, I,

985
01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:49.209
I think of it as a kind of umbrella

986
01:01:49.209 --> 01:01:54.969
concept. Um, IT'S in, in many ways, cognitively linked

987
01:01:54.969 --> 01:02:01.110
to, it has cogate links with, with other organism-centered

988
01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:05.939
approaches to evolution like Um, some aspects of Evodevo,

989
01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:09.790
like Ecodevo, like, uh, developmental systems theory or this

990
01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:14.139
construction theory. Um, THERE are, there are a number

991
01:02:14.139 --> 01:02:20.830
of, of, um, movements or subfields, uh, of biology

992
01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:25.409
that place the organism center stage in evolution and,

993
01:02:25.489 --> 01:02:29.409
and Um, place emphasis on the active agency of

994
01:02:29.409 --> 01:02:34.810
the organism and how development matters in evolution. And

995
01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.449
the extent of evolutionary synthesis is really just a

996
01:02:37.449 --> 01:02:39.770
sort of umbrella term for, for all of those

997
01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:42.330
things. And when I, um, you know, when in

998
01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.969
our book we, you know, we talk about evolution

999
01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:49.090
evolving, we don't really, um, characterize it as an

1000
01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:52.800
extended evolutionary synthesis. Um, BOOK, but that's what it

1001
01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.600
is, but it's equally a book for advocates of

1002
01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.479
Evodevo and Eco-devo and, and developmental systems theory. We

1003
01:02:59.479 --> 01:03:05.340
try and champion all of those approaches and um

1004
01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.639
They are distinctive because of their emphasis on things

1005
01:03:09.639 --> 01:03:13.760
like niche construction, emphasizing our niche construction is important,

1006
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.919
the active agency of organisms is important. The plasticity

1007
01:03:16.919 --> 01:03:20.919
led evolution is frequently important that extra genetic inheritance

1008
01:03:20.919 --> 01:03:23.679
is occurring in a variety of different ways, and

1009
01:03:23.679 --> 01:03:27.360
that makes a difference to how populations evolve that

1010
01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.360
developmental bias is a really central concept, and so

1011
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.929
we have this reciprocal causal framework to our understanding.

1012
01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:39.814
OF evolutionary change, and that's the evolutionary process itself

1013
01:03:39.814 --> 01:03:43.784
evolves over time. This is emphasis on evolvability. So

1014
01:03:43.784 --> 01:03:46.024
all of these are ideas that are central to

1015
01:03:46.024 --> 01:03:49.364
the extent of evolutionary synthesis that are central to

1016
01:03:49.364 --> 01:03:53.114
our book, but also central to a variety of

1017
01:03:53.114 --> 01:03:56.465
organism centered approaches, which I think are gaining traction

1018
01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:56.905
currently.

1019
01:03:58.209 --> 01:04:01.209
Great. So, the book is again evolution evolving, the

1020
01:04:01.209 --> 01:04:06.419
developmental origins of adaptation and biodiversity. There it is.

1021
01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.060
I'm leaving a link to it in the description

1022
01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:13.219
box of the interview and Doctor Law, apart from

1023
01:04:13.219 --> 01:04:15.800
the book, just before we go, are there any

1024
01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.659
places on the internet where people can find your

1025
01:04:18.659 --> 01:04:19.090
work?

1026
01:04:19.909 --> 01:04:24.060
Uh, YEAH, we actually have um a website associated

1027
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:29.260
with the book, uh, evolution Evolving.com. Um, AND, um,

1028
01:04:29.659 --> 01:04:32.090
if you go to that website, you can see

1029
01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:34.939
um a number of other resources, not just information

1030
01:04:34.939 --> 01:04:38.290
about the book, but we've produced some animations, um,

1031
01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:42.959
which will In 235 minutes, uh, give you overviews

1032
01:04:42.959 --> 01:04:46.639
of how developmental plasticity works or the nature of

1033
01:04:46.639 --> 01:04:49.439
extra genetic inheritance. Uh, AND I think these are,

1034
01:04:49.639 --> 01:04:53.239
these are really cool, um, educational resources in, in

1035
01:04:53.239 --> 01:04:56.080
their own right. So I encouraging, I encourage you

1036
01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.080
