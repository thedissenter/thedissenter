00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.190
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.269
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes and

3
00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.670
today I'm joined by Doctor Luanna Cooke. She's professor

4
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.510
in pain and translational symptom Science, director of the

5
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.690
Placebo Beyond Opinion Center, empowered professor, and a Professor

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.250
in the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.729
Maryland and she's co-editor of Placebo Effects Through the

8
00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:31.110
lens of Translational Research, and that's the book we're

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.049
talking about today. So, Doctor Kaka, welcome to the

10
00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:35.490
show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.729
Thank you so much, uh, Ricardo, for having me

12
00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:40.080
today.

13
00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:44.439
So uh tell us first before we get into

14
00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:48.520
more detail on the topic of placebos, particularly for

15
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.080
people who might not be familiar with this specific

16
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.400
topic. What is a placebo exactly?

17
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.849
Placebo are inert substances that were introduced in medicine

18
00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:09.139
as comparators with an active drug to validate the

19
00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:14.650
efficacy of new drugs. But historically, placebo have been

20
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.540
bread pills, saline solution, and many other ingredients that

21
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.199
were given to patients to please them when no

22
00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:27.680
other treatment were available. In fact, some people say

23
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.750
that the history of placebo is the history of

24
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.360
medicine because 200 years ago and even earlier, 1000

25
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.360
probably alreadypocrates was mentioning, you know, use of the

26
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.110
treatment that somehow were not necessarily linked to an

27
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.680
action, but yet we were given 12 patients to

28
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.650
feel better. From that Observation that many clinicians were

29
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.500
aware of. Science started to investigate the mechanisms of

30
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.739
the placebo effects. Why do we improve symptoms when

31
00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:08.229
we believe that the treatment is able to work?

32
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.139
And so placebo effects have been studied in the

33
00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:20.699
arena of pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, Parkinson's, motor disorders,

34
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.059
and so on. And the goal is to try

35
00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:28.419
to understand the neurobiology beyond improvement of the symptoms

36
00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:29.940
related to placebos.

37
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.199
And so when it comes to medical research and

38
00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:40.240
health research more broadly, why do we need to

39
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.869
study placebos and understand how they work?

40
00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.419
That is a 1 million question. So why do

41
00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:53.059
we do that? The answer is that thousands of

42
00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:59.210
clinical trials fail because the active drug under investigation

43
00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:05.139
do not outperform placebos. For example, if we want

44
00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.020
to discover a new pain therapeutic, we need to

45
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.139
compare the action of the treatment we are trying

46
00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:18.559
to discover with. Placebo and so often there is

47
00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:23.429
no improvement. So yesterday we were having a wonderful,

48
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.220
uh, you know, presentation on cannabinoids, the marijuana that

49
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.860
is so common for treatment of pain today. And

50
00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.850
despite it is on the market, it has been,

51
00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:40.779
um, you know, advertised as a treatment that can

52
00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:45.250
be an alternative to opioids, yet. When we do

53
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.199
people-based evidence, there is no improvement with a placebo

54
00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:56.009
and the placebo can be CBT, the cannabinoids that

55
00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:01.130
don't create the hallucination. Therefore, we understand that every

56
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.850
time we want to promote, to validate a new

57
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.410
treatment, we need to compare with plas effects. And

58
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.210
the magnitude of a placebo-related improvements are often as

59
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.250
dramatic as the treatment we want to discover and

60
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.928
sometimes even better. So many Products have not been

61
00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:27.528
advanced to the market to clinical practice because there

62
00:04:27.528 --> 00:04:30.838
is not a net difference with place effects. So

63
00:04:30.838 --> 00:04:34.739
definitely we need to learn for drug development, but

64
00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:40.229
also going back to history, if a patient can

65
00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.049
feel better through a placebo mechanism, why don't we

66
00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:49.369
offer that to them? It is cost effective. But

67
00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:54.390
also Low side effects, if not side effects at

68
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.019
all. Eventually can be also helpful to train future

69
00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:05.779
clinicians, I mean pharmacists, psychologists, doctors, to harness pla

70
00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:09.940
effects without, uh, you know, too much concern or

71
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.859
reservations.

72
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:18.420
So placebos are used in clinical trials, drug development,

73
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.149
and so on. But uh can we use uh

74
00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:26.309
placebo science that is studying out placebo work uh

75
00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:30.459
placebos work and so on, to improve the design

76
00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:32.980
of the clinical trials themselves?

77
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.119
That is my goal. That is my dream, I

78
00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:41.040
got to say because uh over the last decades

79
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.359
at the University of Maryland, the target has been

80
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.959
to translate the mechanism and the science of placebo

81
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.149
to better design of clinical trials. One The approach

82
00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:56.730
has been to understand more about the dynamic of

83
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.299
expectations. Can we measure effectively expectation, dynamically study the

84
00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:06.420
change in expectation to predict outcome related to active

85
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.260
treatment in clinical trials? Other approaches that we have

86
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.959
been using. Uh um OMICS brain imaging to have

87
00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:19.000
a biological signature of placebo effects and eventually be

88
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.440
able to predict those participants who may benefit more

89
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.679
or less from placebo effects. And finally, there are

90
00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:31.320
people that even get worse with treatments and placebo

91
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.679
when we call them the nobo responders, although they

92
00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:38.869
tended to be. The small proportion of the participants,

93
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.989
it's still interesting to learn how we can help

94
00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:45.390
those people who are more vulnerable. And in that

95
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.779
sense, we target disparities. We study people who live

96
00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:54.589
in distressed area of Maryland state. Or with such

97
00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:58.950
economic, you know, poverty, to try to understand which

98
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.910
are again the critical factors that influence the predisposition

99
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.239
to respond or not to respond to placebo mechanism.

100
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.339
Eventually we learn The neurobiology, but also the social

101
00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:17.779
demographic realm of uh participant and now this can

102
00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:22.369
affect the ability to harness classic effects. This could

103
00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:24.739
help us to design better trials.

104
00:07:26.269 --> 00:07:29.350
And what would you say are the main goals

105
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.260
that you and your co-authors have with this book?

106
00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:38.029
When we wrote this book, our goal was to

107
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:43.510
make this topic accessible to everyone. We were lucky

108
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:48.910
to be able to secure a fund to make

109
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:56.579
this Oxford University Press accessible to everyone. So, Across

110
00:07:56.579 --> 00:07:59.579
countries we realize that there is an interest, and

111
00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:05.179
often people from underdeveloped countries can't have access to

112
00:08:05.179 --> 00:08:07.779
the paper we write, can't have access to the

113
00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:10.820
book, because even if a book is low cost,

114
00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:13.809
for some of that low cost means a lot.

115
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.320
So I to translate and disseminate. So let me

116
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.760
start, as I mentioned from dissemination. Dissemination for us

117
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.559
was making uh the book accessible to students, to

118
00:08:28.559 --> 00:08:33.159
elderly, to scientists, to clinicians, but also to people

119
00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:37.058
from uh You know, the society who may want

120
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:41.150
to read about what is this phenomenon. And second,

121
00:08:41.359 --> 00:08:45.280
and probably most important, our goal was to translate

122
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.080
the knowledge of placebo. And in order to translate

123
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.760
the science of placebo to other areas, we engage

124
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:58.520
with bioethicists, anthropologists, the clinicians, and the engineer, and

125
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.440
we try to understand this phenomenon through the lens

126
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:08.539
of different interdisciplinary. Um, APPROACHES so that uh there

127
00:09:08.539 --> 00:09:13.780
is someone focusing on cultural difference and uh how

128
00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:18.020
being a shami can influence placebo, how religious thoughts

129
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.559
and spirituality can be linked to placebo. But also

130
00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:24.320
there is the core of the book on the

131
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.049
science, the brain signature, what do we know about

132
00:09:28.479 --> 00:09:33.960
mechanism ofpla effects at the level of omics, proteomics.

133
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.270
So the trend in science as of today seems

134
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:42.200
to be understanding the signature, the predictors, but also

135
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.479
we have sections where we comment about placebo effects

136
00:09:46.479 --> 00:09:51.750
across disease. Something is the coughing, something is suffering

137
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:56.799
from depression or even for athletes, increasing the performance.

138
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.429
And finally, we devote to the last two sections

139
00:10:00.429 --> 00:10:04.500
to disparities. Now we know that even before we

140
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.210
meet our physician, often we can read in the

141
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:12.250
chart all the disease, or uh, you know, everything

142
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.669
about our last consultation with a doctor. That can

143
00:10:16.669 --> 00:10:20.450
be sometime dramatic because we learn about a disease,

144
00:10:20.609 --> 00:10:24.489
patients start googling do we create placebono C effects.

145
00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:28.640
Uh, OR how can we train our family doctor

146
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.299
to use the right communication strategies to convey information

147
00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:38.140
that can maximize in clinical practice effects and minimize

148
00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:42.849
the negative the noive effects. And finally, digital therapeutics.

149
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.840
I mean, we are in the area of app,

150
00:10:45.049 --> 00:10:50.570
virtual reality, extended reality, and the telemedicine, and the

151
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.809
goal was to understand how this could impact the

152
00:10:53.809 --> 00:10:57.409
future of this research and eventually how this can

153
00:10:57.409 --> 00:11:03.429
be employed. To somehow optimize, uh again the management

154
00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:05.450
of symptoms and pla effects.

155
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:11.250
So earlier, we've talked about how placebos are used

156
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.090
in clinical trials and drug development, but you've also

157
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:19.210
mentioned briefly that sometimes they might be used in

158
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:24.210
clinical interventions themselves instead of using a drug, we

159
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.000
use a placebo because it happens to have the

160
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.400
desired effect, the effect that we want, but Since

161
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.030
it is a placebo and not the drug itself,

162
00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.359
in what grounds can those sorts of clinical interventions

163
00:11:40.359 --> 00:11:41.440
be justified?

164
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.900
That is such a critical question and policymakers and

165
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.090
by the way this is to become a very

166
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.659
vocal when we talk about introducing the placebo in

167
00:11:53.659 --> 00:12:01.090
clinical practice. So the American Medical Association, AMA indeed

168
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.969
the state that there is no justification to use

169
00:12:03.969 --> 00:12:08.609
a placebo when we have active treatment available. So

170
00:12:08.609 --> 00:12:12.289
that means that if we are studying uh pain

171
00:12:12.289 --> 00:12:16.409
and we know that an Advil pill and NSAIDs

172
00:12:16.409 --> 00:12:21.289
can be efficacious. According to the AMA directions, we

173
00:12:21.289 --> 00:12:25.770
cannot replace that drug with a placebo. Moreover, for

174
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:29.530
bioethicist, there is another critical issue. The use of

175
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:34.609
deception that has been associated often with placebo becomes

176
00:12:34.609 --> 00:12:39.320
very problematic. So deceptive placebo has ever been banned,

177
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.809
at least from countries where, um, you know, the

178
00:12:42.809 --> 00:12:46.599
principle of autonomy is so important. And using the

179
00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:51.210
deception along with placebo has been deemed as something

180
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:56.330
that can jeopardize trust in medicine. Mhm. So, there

181
00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.169
are several issues and concern and limiting the use

182
00:13:00.169 --> 00:13:03.640
of the placebo in clinical practice. That is why

183
00:13:03.929 --> 00:13:07.130
um we can champion for use of the placebo

184
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:11.409
mechanisms. We still that we take advantage of the

185
00:13:11.409 --> 00:13:17.119
mechanism that is word. Verbal suggestion, the kind of

186
00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:22.280
framing effects, or even placebo along with active treatment

187
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.450
as a giant can justify, you know. The use

188
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.330
of and the introduction of placebo without jeopardizing the

189
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:37.450
AMA recommendation without jeopardize the concern about deception. So

190
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.330
fortunately, we are advancing this line of research where

191
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.809
deception is not needed, for example, the open labor

192
00:13:44.809 --> 00:13:48.690
placebo or the those extending the placebo where we

193
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:53.479
can tell patients. By learning mechanism, the association between

194
00:13:53.479 --> 00:13:57.039
active drug and placebo can help us minimize the

195
00:13:57.039 --> 00:14:02.000
total intake. Or the open label placebo we tell

196
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.500
patients, these are placebos, but we know that. Taking

197
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.809
a pill and the act of taking a pill

198
00:14:08.809 --> 00:14:11.890
can trigger the descending pain modulator system and the

199
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.969
descending fatigue system, and so there is an improvement

200
00:14:15.969 --> 00:14:19.450
of the symptoms. Those patients who agree can take

201
00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:24.299
without being deceived. So definitely we need to work

202
00:14:24.299 --> 00:14:31.840
together with policymakers, bioethicists, advance. The evidence-based knowledge of

203
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:38.080
efficacy by preserving respect of um autonomy and other

204
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.159
principles that become so vital to be able to

205
00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:44.479
translate this science to the bedsides.

206
00:14:46.059 --> 00:14:49.159
So, let's talk here a little bit about some

207
00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:54.599
of the psychological mechanisms that underlie the placebo effect.

208
00:14:54.719 --> 00:14:58.559
So placebos are very much tied to the kinds

209
00:14:58.559 --> 00:15:03.159
of expectations that people have, that patients have. What

210
00:15:03.159 --> 00:15:07.559
are the expectations and how do you define them

211
00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:10.030
particularly in the clinical context?

212
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:19.109
PREDICTION of future outcome but also desire beliefs. An

213
00:15:19.109 --> 00:15:22.390
example can help. Let's assume a patient has phantom

214
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.510
pain, continue to have this terrible pain in the

215
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.119
area where the art is not present anymore. So

216
00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:32.770
of course there are different um desires. First off,

217
00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:35.750
you know, some are not in line with the

218
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:40.070
reality like having uh the and the feet back

219
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:43.590
where they were supposed to be, but also the

220
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:48.059
main problem will be to release this. Amazing pain

221
00:15:48.059 --> 00:15:53.299
that becomes so debilitating and interfering with life. A

222
00:15:53.299 --> 00:15:58.289
possibility will be to try to align expectations with

223
00:15:58.289 --> 00:16:02.530
the outcome we can achieve together with the patient

224
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.960
as providers. So explain that while we don't be

225
00:16:07.289 --> 00:16:11.609
able to bring back the harm, the end, the

226
00:16:11.609 --> 00:16:16.119
food, we can definitely work with, uh, you know,

227
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:23.260
robotics to create, you know. An actual uh your

228
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.799
arm or a hand that will help restore functionality.

229
00:16:28.059 --> 00:16:30.929
But also when it comes to pain and other,

230
00:16:31.219 --> 00:16:34.900
you know, symptoms, it's important to explain there are

231
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:40.010
therapy from mirror therapies through virtual reality, rehab that

232
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:46.820
can retrain the brain to minimize the firing, the

233
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.539
non-sceptive input that becomes so debilitating. So, in other

234
00:16:51.539 --> 00:16:57.630
words, uh we can um Reshape expectation in a

235
00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.030
way that minimize conflict. And when we have this

236
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:05.430
sort of balance between what is achievable and what

237
00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:10.469
is not achievable, this level of uh, you know,

238
00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:16.329
integration of cognitive effective sensorial stimulation can help optimize

239
00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:21.260
the management. Placebo. Needed to be integrated into the

240
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.890
physiology and the pathology of the disease. Despite the

241
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.459
tend to be promoted as a magic pills. In

242
00:17:29.459 --> 00:17:32.530
reality, it's all in our brain. How can we

243
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:39.979
retrain our brain, our mindset to somehow. Favor this

244
00:17:39.979 --> 00:17:45.020
healing processes that is true for cancer patients, it's

245
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.699
true for neuropathic pain, for diabetic neuropathy, and so

246
00:17:49.699 --> 00:17:55.540
on. And often relying only on pharmacological treatment make

247
00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:01.219
patients even more vulnerable. They become uh exposed to

248
00:18:01.219 --> 00:18:05.660
all the side effects. We bypass all the cognitive

249
00:18:06.439 --> 00:18:11.040
influence that our brain can contribute powerfully to make

250
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.839
people feel better. So I hope that this research

251
00:18:14.839 --> 00:18:20.430
will bring us back to this holistic medicine where

252
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:25.270
we understand that our frontal area of the brain

253
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.439
are part of the healing process. And the sort

254
00:18:28.439 --> 00:18:31.500
of inner pharmacy that I have been mentioning in

255
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.959
my You know, dissemination of research and science is

256
00:18:36.959 --> 00:18:39.589
truly a pharmacy in the brain, the ability to

257
00:18:39.589 --> 00:18:44.500
release substances that can facilitate healing process. It's something

258
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.770
that we can switch on. And truly harness to

259
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.209
make people in power that they overall. It's not

260
00:18:52.209 --> 00:18:58.119
only the physician prescribed antidepressant, aniolytics, opioids, and says,

261
00:18:58.689 --> 00:19:03.040
No, this should change. We want something different. We

262
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.890
would like to have a combination andliance back in

263
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:11.569
place where we say, you, your attitude, your behaviors,

264
00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:16.459
your thoughts. Influence the medication that you take, because

265
00:19:16.459 --> 00:19:21.260
the action of the medication that we use pharmacologically

266
00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:27.910
are not independent of the endogenous mechanism that underlying

267
00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.670
expectation and place effects.

268
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.119
And of course, some of these expectations as you

269
00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:37.800
talk about in your book are rooted in cultural

270
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:44.400
beliefs, norms, etc. So, how important is culture in

271
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.969
a clinical context?

272
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.560
It's been somehow dismissed as less relevant, but the

273
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:58.709
literacy, the value, the preference are so different based

274
00:19:58.709 --> 00:20:01.520
on where we grew up, based on where we

275
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.680
are. And this is evident in studies show that,

276
00:20:05.689 --> 00:20:10.839
for example, acupuncture needling is more efficacious in uh

277
00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:16.000
Asian people or injection tended to be more efficacious

278
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.479
in European people and pills in the US, Canada.

279
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.890
But also when we talk about end of life,

280
00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:28.089
you know, for some people is. Depending on the

281
00:20:28.089 --> 00:20:31.849
culture, the difference in managing the end of life

282
00:20:31.849 --> 00:20:34.449
is so clear, and that is also true for

283
00:20:34.449 --> 00:20:39.040
symptom management, pain, anxiety, fatigue. I mean, for some

284
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.099
people, I again refer here, having a pill that

285
00:20:44.099 --> 00:20:48.209
boost the energy is so critical. For some other

286
00:20:48.209 --> 00:20:50.920
people, if you go on a trip to Japan,

287
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.369
even Tai Chi at 6 a.m. with all their

288
00:20:54.369 --> 00:20:58.800
community becomes so relevant. What we are missing is

289
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.660
exactly this appreciation of cultural differences. And what is

290
00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.819
relevant for me may not be relevant for another

291
00:21:06.819 --> 00:21:10.489
person. And once we tend to learn from one

292
00:21:10.489 --> 00:21:14.209
another and resume the relevance of culture, the relevance

293
00:21:14.209 --> 00:21:19.290
of community engagement, and minimize the isolation, this can

294
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:22.530
bring you back again another component that is so

295
00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:27.630
critical in symptom management, but also the formation of

296
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:28.689
plastic effects.

297
00:21:30.349 --> 00:21:35.819
And what explains the variation of the placebo effect

298
00:21:36.229 --> 00:21:41.069
uh between people and in the same person over

299
00:21:41.069 --> 00:21:44.859
time and in different contexts. I mean, basically, what

300
00:21:44.859 --> 00:21:48.430
is the placebo effect moderated by?

301
00:21:50.339 --> 00:21:53.540
I love this question, uh, Ricardo. So we call

302
00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.849
this predictor factors that help us to understand the

303
00:21:57.849 --> 00:22:01.689
heterogeneity. There is a huge heterogeneity. There are people

304
00:22:01.689 --> 00:22:06.640
who are super responders. The pain disappear magically. The

305
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.819
fatigue disappear, and these are very interesting. This extreme,

306
00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:17.640
you know, responsiveness, it's not observing everyone. It's a

307
00:22:17.709 --> 00:22:20.349
minority of the population, but then there is the

308
00:22:20.349 --> 00:22:23.420
core of these people that on average they improve

309
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.510
and they improve substantially. So the goal is to

310
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:31.760
try to understand which are the factors that somehow

311
00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.949
drive people to be super responders or on this

312
00:22:34.949 --> 00:22:40.339
average poll, or even worse in this negative spot

313
00:22:40.339 --> 00:22:43.270
where you give them a treatment to improve and

314
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:47.650
they get worse. So to me and our team

315
00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:52.339
now become very relevant to understand the variability. Why

316
00:22:52.339 --> 00:22:56.609
is this coming and we are tackling this through

317
00:22:56.609 --> 00:23:01.800
different uh approach. Actually, today was accepted our first

318
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:09.040
transcriptomic profiling study where we use genetic expression to

319
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.170
understand that those who are placebo responders and no

320
00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:15.069
responders. And the goal was to learn in the

321
00:23:15.069 --> 00:23:19.989
spectrum. Very little responses, huge la responders or on

322
00:23:19.989 --> 00:23:23.910
the other. And we found actually that there are

323
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:29.420
some uh pathways that become critical. In the brain,

324
00:23:29.479 --> 00:23:34.780
in the body, in generating. This, you know, different

325
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.849
money to the facts. And so, um, the goal,

326
00:23:38.859 --> 00:23:43.949
uh, we, we realize that uh There are at

327
00:23:43.949 --> 00:23:50.170
the molecular level, uh, ribosome involved mitochondria mechanism that

328
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.349
tell us how health is our body and somehow

329
00:23:53.349 --> 00:23:57.900
this translates in larger plastic effects. But also I'm

330
00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.939
lucky to have a lab that is diverse and

331
00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:03.290
they bring a new idea. So one of our

332
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:11.550
um hm. Postdoc was interested in understanding how the

333
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:15.469
area where people live in the Maryland state can

334
00:24:15.469 --> 00:24:23.430
influence placebo effects. So Nandini found that the social.

335
00:24:24.219 --> 00:24:28.949
Demographic position, the zip code where people are located

336
00:24:29.319 --> 00:24:34.349
can influence their pain, but also the placebo reduction

337
00:24:34.349 --> 00:24:37.550
of their pain. So people who tend to live

338
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:42.439
in distressed area, West Baltimore, where they are constantly

339
00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:47.229
exposed to criminality, shooting, tend to have lower placebo

340
00:24:47.229 --> 00:24:51.160
effects, higher pain interference, and the two things are

341
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:57.130
connected. So again, we champion health lifestyle safety will

342
00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:01.750
begin and somehow the placebo responders are those who

343
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:06.609
live in a prosperous area who are somehow benefit

344
00:25:06.609 --> 00:25:11.609
from well being and social demographic status. Another way

345
00:25:11.609 --> 00:25:15.250
we are approaching this is to try to understand

346
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:21.079
how expectation can dynamically change. And you mentioned pla

347
00:25:21.079 --> 00:25:24.630
effects over time, you know. So what we are

348
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:28.630
doing is giving actually open label placebo, that means

349
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:34.790
non-deceptive placebo for 45 days as adjust to their

350
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:40.180
pain treatment. Either pharmacological or nonpharmacological pain treatment the

351
00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:45.140
orofacial pain patients are taking. So we said you

352
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:49.969
continue to do your treatment. Pharmacological and pharmacological board

353
00:25:49.969 --> 00:25:53.380
and on top, you take, if you wish, every

354
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.209
day a placebo. So we first allow them to

355
00:25:56.209 --> 00:26:00.250
choose. And then we provide the placebo and every

356
00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:05.800
day we measure their uh Clinical pain, clinical interferences,

357
00:26:05.959 --> 00:26:11.079
ability to sleep, but also weekly, we we ask

358
00:26:11.079 --> 00:26:15.319
them, is this working? What do you expect? And

359
00:26:15.319 --> 00:26:22.030
actually, the way their expectation fluctuate justify the response

360
00:26:22.439 --> 00:26:28.430
to placebo, suggesting that placebo effects, expectation effects are

361
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:35.560
dynamically modulated by our mindset. So, We aim to

362
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:41.550
learn more about reproducibility and is a placebo responder

363
00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:46.800
always a responder across different domain, but also how

364
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:52.560
we can shape expectation to endorse longer lasting effects.

365
00:26:53.949 --> 00:26:58.209
Do we have a good understanding of the neurobiological

366
00:26:58.209 --> 00:27:02.500
basis of the placebo effect? Do we know exactly

367
00:27:02.869 --> 00:27:06.430
what happens in the brain that then produces the

368
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.219
placebo effect or not?

369
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:15.589
I'm confident that the science is exploding and this

370
00:27:15.589 --> 00:27:19.709
is becoming a proxy to study brain functions. The

371
00:27:19.709 --> 00:27:24.349
brain is still a magical, wonderful machinery that compared

372
00:27:24.349 --> 00:27:29.060
to other organs, a kidney, liver, heart, we know

373
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:34.250
much less as scientists, as physicians. So the placebo

374
00:27:35.109 --> 00:27:40.729
has been uh somehow a sort of um. Trigger

375
00:27:40.729 --> 00:27:43.849
to learn more, to learn more about all we

376
00:27:43.849 --> 00:27:48.890
call descending pathway, modulatory systems in the brain. And

377
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:52.530
the fact that we can model placebo effects through

378
00:27:52.530 --> 00:28:01.359
different um mechanisms, conditioning, learning, observation, verbal suggestion, that

379
00:28:01.609 --> 00:28:07.339
is opened up. Of research in basic science with

380
00:28:07.339 --> 00:28:11.329
rats, with mice, and I expect that this will

381
00:28:11.329 --> 00:28:17.699
revolutionize our understanding of the mechanisms underlying placebo effects.

382
00:28:18.209 --> 00:28:21.349
Because we can slice the brain of humans, but

383
00:28:21.349 --> 00:28:25.369
we, we do that in animal research or in

384
00:28:25.369 --> 00:28:29.900
animal research, we can do chemogenetics, optogenetics, turn off

385
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.489
and on receptors. I think all this manipulation of

386
00:28:33.489 --> 00:28:37.959
the mechanism in animals will be very critical to

387
00:28:37.959 --> 00:28:41.319
understand the mechanism of placebo effects at the level

388
00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:47.670
of circuits, molecules, receptors. But the human research, despite

389
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:52.390
the limitation, is continued to reveal new brain and

390
00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:58.180
neuronal signature of placebo responses. The omics I mentioned

391
00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:03.550
transcriptomic profiles are coming along to understand how placebo

392
00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:08.430
can change proteins can somehow be associated to different

393
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:12.380
gene expression. And another area of research that hopefully

394
00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:17.030
will be very helpful is machine learning and computational

395
00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:21.400
modeling. All this engineer AI actually will be applied

396
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.920
to placebo, you know, it's becoming popular, this line

397
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.270
of research where we have a different machine learning

398
00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:33.150
approach, a different, um, you know, AI approach to

399
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:37.510
understand more about placebo and how they can know

400
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:38.260
cool and poor.

401
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.699
So let me ask you here about a specific

402
00:29:42.699 --> 00:29:45.550
example of a condition that you explore in the

403
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.650
book where the placebo effect might play a role.

404
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:53.180
So you have a chapter on how the regulation

405
00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:57.900
of genes plays a role in placebo responsiveness in

406
00:29:58.189 --> 00:30:03.229
alcohol use disorder and co-occurring pain. Could you tell

407
00:30:03.229 --> 00:30:03.949
us about that?

408
00:30:06.569 --> 00:30:09.810
One area of research that is still very, you

409
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:18.420
know, uh. Relevant and always timely. The opioids, uh,

410
00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:29.969
mm. Disorders, the OUD but also COD, alcohol-related disorders.

411
00:30:30.849 --> 00:30:33.920
And the reason why this line of research is

412
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.640
so critical is because we have been not really

413
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.560
successful in minimizing and helping these people affect from

414
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:46.119
different drug disorders. And so the goal is to

415
00:30:46.119 --> 00:30:49.359
try to again apply what we discovered in pain

416
00:30:49.719 --> 00:30:52.479
in terms of predictors, who are the people who

417
00:30:52.839 --> 00:30:56.199
drink a glass of wine and are at risk.

418
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:59.810
To want a glass of wine every day and

419
00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:03.930
then escalate until become a misuse and abuse. So

420
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.500
the goal there has been to try to predict.

421
00:31:06.969 --> 00:31:10.520
So can we some about knowing that this person

422
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:14.819
is vulnerable because of the genetic asset, the area

423
00:31:14.819 --> 00:31:18.829
where he lives or she lives, and so. We

424
00:31:18.829 --> 00:31:21.189
don't have an answer yet, but the goal is

425
00:31:21.189 --> 00:31:25.069
to try to expand and see to the brain

426
00:31:25.069 --> 00:31:28.550
signature that we have already addiction related the brain

427
00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:33.349
signature to gene expression, proteomics again to say that

428
00:31:33.349 --> 00:31:37.020
person is vulnerable and so this can help us

429
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.430
to say. You might need to be careful with

430
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:45.910
recreational drinking, with recreational use of the drug, because

431
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:48.760
other people can afford because they use it once,

432
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.099
and that is in a part for other people,

433
00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:53.739
we use it once and we start, you know,

434
00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:58.910
this terrible journey that end up with dramatic lives.

435
00:31:59.069 --> 00:32:01.750
So that will be the goal. Unfortunately, we have

436
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.930
so little research in this area and we added

437
00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:08.530
this chapter mostly as some. With the hope to

438
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:13.000
stimulate interest and to raise awareness, we need more

439
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.160
research in that area.

440
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.660
So let me ask you now, and I probably

441
00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.369
could have asked you this question earlier in our

442
00:32:21.369 --> 00:32:26.780
conversation, but when exactly does the placebo effect become

443
00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.339
simply a treatment effect?

444
00:32:29.579 --> 00:32:33.699
We define a treatment effects when uh we see

445
00:32:33.699 --> 00:32:36.390
a response to the treatment we give. So the

446
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:41.540
placebo effects. Turn into a treatment effects when by

447
00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.619
means of using a placebo or even a suggestion

448
00:32:44.619 --> 00:32:47.500
of improvement, we see a net improvement of a

449
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:52.459
symptom and reduction and interference disappear and people are

450
00:32:52.459 --> 00:32:56.540
back to bike again to work, to socialize or

451
00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.150
sleep problems, they start sleeping again. So when eventually

452
00:33:01.449 --> 00:33:07.609
we provide the treatment that can be. Pharmacological, non-pharmacological,

453
00:33:07.839 --> 00:33:11.160
purely placebo, and we see an improvement of the

454
00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.750
outcome that become meaningful to have the right, sorry,

455
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.800
the right design to claim that when we needed

456
00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:25.250
to have uh uh evidence-based approach where we study

457
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.719
this with the right design, and that is something

458
00:33:28.719 --> 00:33:34.359
that is missed often in non-pharmacological based research. Where

459
00:33:34.359 --> 00:33:37.770
for example, they study the effects of uh lemon

460
00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:41.160
juice and go without using the right control or

461
00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:46.010
without uh design carpo study and that can make

462
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:47.079
wrong claims.

463
00:33:49.709 --> 00:33:54.810
So, uh, can placebo effects also be exploited in

464
00:33:54.810 --> 00:34:01.199
clinical practice to optimize patient, clinician, communication and the

465
00:34:01.199 --> 00:34:02.920
relationship more broadly?

466
00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.250
This is one of the goal of our um

467
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:11.239
center, we create a center of school of nursing,

468
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.610
the University of Maryland and one of the goal

469
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:18.618
is the educational effort. Learning about the neurobiology of

470
00:34:18.618 --> 00:34:22.018
placebo, teaching about the words that we use is

471
00:34:22.018 --> 00:34:26.259
not merely a matter of good practice and endorsing

472
00:34:26.259 --> 00:34:30.549
ethics. That can somehow change the way we inform

473
00:34:30.549 --> 00:34:34.138
a patient, we consent patient, we send the patient

474
00:34:34.138 --> 00:34:38.360
home with a prescription. This uh knowledge and uh

475
00:34:38.708 --> 00:34:43.600
uh awareness about the neurobiology of plastic effects can

476
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:50.618
make people truly endorsing the right uh. Patient doctor

477
00:34:50.618 --> 00:34:55.217
communication. That is the immediate approach and the relevance

478
00:34:55.217 --> 00:34:58.739
of this research, but I hope that also we

479
00:34:58.739 --> 00:35:02.529
will be able one day in an ethical way

480
00:35:02.529 --> 00:35:07.579
in line with AMA to add this treatment to

481
00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:13.209
Conventional treatments to minimize side effects and also to

482
00:35:13.209 --> 00:35:18.010
open up more opportunity for uh integrative medicine, where

483
00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:23.120
the pharmacological approach can be combined with non-pharmacological approach.

484
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.250
And when we see again, go back who are

485
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.530
those who benefit, if a patient can deal with

486
00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:33.090
primarily non-pharmacological approach, there is no reason to create

487
00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:38.389
side effects and harm to the body. And provide

488
00:35:38.389 --> 00:35:42.469
the treatments that are pharmacological based when in reality

489
00:35:42.469 --> 00:35:45.919
they may benefit from non-pharmacological approach.

490
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.189
So, I would like to ask you now about

491
00:35:50.189 --> 00:35:53.350
the particular chapter that you have in the book,

492
00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:59.320
uh, about the placebo effects in mental health. Uh,

493
00:35:59.719 --> 00:36:02.520
BEFORE we get into the placebo effects themselves and

494
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:06.000
the main argument made there, what do we know

495
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.399
about the efficacy of mental health, therapeutics, and antidepressants

496
00:36:12.399 --> 00:36:14.080
specifically across the globe?

497
00:36:17.239 --> 00:36:20.270
Well, um This is a critical question, and I

498
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.770
want to be cautious with the answer because um.

499
00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:28.439
Some people have thought that we don't need press

500
00:36:28.439 --> 00:36:32.750
because they work as well as placebo and so

501
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.550
that was also a family relative at some point

502
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:39.830
that told me every time, uh, you know, you

503
00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:43.629
thought that I was taking uh SSRI in reality

504
00:36:43.629 --> 00:36:46.750
I throw in the toilet thinking that it's only

505
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:51.229
a placebo. And I was shocked and I learned

506
00:36:51.229 --> 00:36:55.469
this after the facts, even when we had the

507
00:36:55.469 --> 00:36:59.590
meeting with the psychiatrist complimenting you truly improved, you

508
00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:03.750
know, your, your, the treatment I prescribed was efficacious

509
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:08.419
and later on the patient revealed to the psychiatrist

510
00:37:08.419 --> 00:37:12.939
that in reality didn't take the medication. So this

511
00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:18.610
kind of attitude, mistrust, mistrust in, you know, some

512
00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:25.629
antidepressants or other treatment olytics uh sometimes is related

513
00:37:25.629 --> 00:37:28.620
also to news, you know, like, uh, there has

514
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.780
been research show that antidepressants are primarily working through

515
00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.229
place effects. So we need to be cautious because

516
00:37:36.229 --> 00:37:40.439
some patients can really benefit from pharmacological therapy. So

517
00:37:40.439 --> 00:37:43.870
to generalize and say that any antidepressant is a

518
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:47.899
placebo is really wrong. There are circumstances where mood

519
00:37:47.899 --> 00:37:53.639
disorders can benefit from pharmacological treatment. On the other

520
00:37:53.639 --> 00:37:57.969
hand, The same way and the present and pain

521
00:37:57.969 --> 00:38:02.479
therapeutic benefit from the mindset can be helpful, you

522
00:38:02.479 --> 00:38:06.399
know, to truly educate patients about the mechanism of

523
00:38:06.399 --> 00:38:11.889
expectation, the mechanism of um. Placebo and see how

524
00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:16.449
mood and expectation can play a role in the

525
00:38:16.449 --> 00:38:22.760
action of the um antidepressant or even more antipsychotics.

526
00:38:23.209 --> 00:38:25.889
So again, it's an interesting line of research that

527
00:38:25.889 --> 00:38:29.729
is evolving where um I see two trends. One

528
00:38:29.729 --> 00:38:35.090
is to understand how computational modeling of expectation can

529
00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:40.810
predict the response to Active antidepressant, but also our

530
00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:45.270
shaping expectation, a sort of CBT cognitive behavioral therapy

531
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:49.649
of expectation can help optimize treatment and dealing.

532
00:38:51.909 --> 00:38:54.729
Uh, BUT, uh, I, I mean, there's an argument

533
00:38:54.729 --> 00:38:59.070
made by Doctor Jensa in one of the chapters

534
00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:03.649
in your book, uh, uh, uh, about. I, I

535
00:39:03.649 --> 00:39:07.479
mean, basically, he, he argues that psychotherapy is an

536
00:39:07.479 --> 00:39:12.729
open label placebo, and open label placebos are psychotherapy.

537
00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.770
So, uh, I mean, what is the argument there

538
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:20.489
exactly and related to that, can we really tell

539
00:39:20.929 --> 00:39:26.260
whether psychotherapy works or if it all boils down

540
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.290
to placebo effects?

541
00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:33.689
Good question. Uh, I mentioned the CBT of expectation.

542
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:38.840
So psychotherapy somehow can be direct to expectation, and

543
00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.330
that can be wonderful. And in that sense, the

544
00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:46.649
difference between psychotherapy and the sort of a placebo

545
00:39:46.649 --> 00:39:50.850
is not different. I agree with um our author

546
00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:55.449
because indeed, uh, you know, if we shape expectation

547
00:39:55.449 --> 00:40:00.439
in an optimal way, that can be Therapeutic. And

548
00:40:00.439 --> 00:40:06.439
so CBT per se or psychotherapy does that and

549
00:40:06.439 --> 00:40:09.790
has been doing that. So in a challenging way

550
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:13.110
he suggested that all our psychotherapists are very good

551
00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.800
in endorsing plasmbo effects, and I agree totally, and

552
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:21.629
there is nothing wrong about that. And uh They

553
00:40:21.629 --> 00:40:25.189
feel is even evolving, you may hear about psychedelics,

554
00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:29.439
you know, somehow if we even combine the psychotherapy

555
00:40:29.439 --> 00:40:32.709
with psychedelic, we can change the expectation in a

556
00:40:32.709 --> 00:40:36.350
more powerful way. So, will this be the future

557
00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:39.129
where we go to the the therapist, we get

558
00:40:39.129 --> 00:40:42.550
psychedelics and our expectation change and we boost this

559
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:46.370
powerful pla effects, maybe. We'll see.

560
00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.439
So I have one last question then and also

561
00:40:51.439 --> 00:40:56.560
basically to sum things up here. So why do

562
00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:02.479
placebos matter for research quality, generally speaking?

563
00:41:04.129 --> 00:41:07.330
So one of the first needs was to create

564
00:41:07.639 --> 00:41:13.229
a sort of less um chaotic uh evidence-based research

565
00:41:13.229 --> 00:41:16.709
and this goes back to clinical trials. I mean,

566
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.439
often we deem as a treatment is cacious when

567
00:41:20.439 --> 00:41:24.590
in reality it's not, if it's compared to uh

568
00:41:24.719 --> 00:41:30.860
equal um functional drug or a placebo. So. The

569
00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:35.429
need was to create evidence based on efficacy. From

570
00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:40.409
there, I mean, we move beyond and beyond with

571
00:41:40.409 --> 00:41:43.729
studying the brain functions through the lens of a

572
00:41:43.729 --> 00:41:48.830
placebo where we modulate uh a mindset which change

573
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:54.689
expectation, we introduce observation again to shape expectation or

574
00:41:54.689 --> 00:41:58.449
this uh fruitful research as changing the way we

575
00:41:58.449 --> 00:42:04.510
frame science and neuroscience around the placebo. And finally,

576
00:42:04.639 --> 00:42:06.760
they need, you know, the need of a clinician

577
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.479
that has to do something with a difficult patient

578
00:42:09.479 --> 00:42:13.229
or even if a compliant and easy to treat

579
00:42:13.229 --> 00:42:18.560
situation where um going back to be observation during

580
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.479
World War II, that morphine ran out, it was

581
00:42:22.479 --> 00:42:26.959
selling soldiers will show a benefit. From a very

582
00:42:26.959 --> 00:42:31.370
clinical basic observation of this line of research, and

583
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:34.989
an explosion because we start to think maybe they

584
00:42:34.989 --> 00:42:38.560
responded because they activate the new opioid receptors. And

585
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.040
in fact, we start to study with naloxone blocking

586
00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:46.840
placebo analgesia. So this suggests, uh, you know, that

587
00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.629
we can go back and forth what we call

588
00:42:49.919 --> 00:42:54.719
a reverse translational science, and observation on the battlefields.

589
00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:02.100
Become an idea for some researcher to do trials

590
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:07.300
of morphine and antagonist of morphine like naloxone. So

591
00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.060
it is very beautiful and I think the power

592
00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:13.060
of this line of research is this ability to

593
00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.949
translate, you know, you don't have to wait many,

594
00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.899
many years to be able to go from the

595
00:43:17.899 --> 00:43:22.219
lab to the bed sides. Can happen immediately. And

596
00:43:22.219 --> 00:43:25.300
this is something that has been very rewarding for

597
00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.179
me as a physician scientist because you can see

598
00:43:28.179 --> 00:43:31.729
a tangible implication straight away.

599
00:43:32.179 --> 00:43:36.219
Great. So the book is again placebo effects through

600
00:43:36.219 --> 00:43:39.860
the lens of translational research. I am leaving a

601
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.350
link to it in the description of the interview.

602
00:43:42.639 --> 00:43:45.639
And Doctor Koloka, would you like to tell people

603
00:43:45.639 --> 00:43:49.129
apart from the book where they can find you

604
00:43:49.129 --> 00:43:51.229
and your work on the internet?

605
00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.679
Of course, thank you very much. We are on

606
00:43:55.679 --> 00:43:59.439
the social media to Lily, but most important, I

607
00:43:59.439 --> 00:44:02.899
encourage you to become a member of our center,

608
00:44:03.159 --> 00:44:07.199
the Placebo Beyond Opinion Center, PBO. And the reason

609
00:44:07.199 --> 00:44:10.120
why we name our center PBO is because we

610
00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:15.199
want to To do placebo evidence-based research beyond any

611
00:44:15.199 --> 00:44:20.280
opinions, any mistrust, any misconceptions. You can become a

612
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:24.879
member, attend our lecture for free, and eventually contribute

613
00:44:24.879 --> 00:44:30.750
to our science through. Collaboration, thoughts, ideas. We are

614
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:35.070
open to listen and welcoming and integrate our science

615
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:38.229
with thoughts from people like Richard did they come

616
00:44:38.229 --> 00:44:41.550
back from Sicily with an idea, so you can

617
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.340
inspire us, be with us.

618
00:44:44.899 --> 00:44:48.139
Great. So, Doctor Cooke, thank you so much again

619
00:44:48.139 --> 00:44:49.870
for taking the time to come on the show.

620
00:44:49.909 --> 00:44:51.669
It's been a pleasure to talk with you.

621
00:44:52.939 --> 00:44:55.530
Thank you so much, Ricardo for reaching out and
