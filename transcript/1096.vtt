00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.009
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.820
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricard Lops and

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.140
today I'm Jabaakler Cajal Moran. He's a visiting fellow

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.739
at the, at the London School of Economics and

5
00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:14.939
Political Science, and he runs the popular YouTube channel

6
00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.415
on learning economics. And today we're talking about his

7
00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:22.215
book Why We're Getting Poor Realist's Guide to the

8
00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:25.375
Economy and how we can fix it. So, Doctor

9
00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:27.575
Moran, welcome to the show. I've been a very

10
00:00:27.575 --> 00:00:29.915
big fan of your channel, so it's an honor

11
00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:30.375
to everyone.

12
00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:32.604
Thanks so much. It's an honor to be here.

13
00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:36.830
OK, so, I mean, we're going to get into

14
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.950
what you mean by getting poorer in the title

15
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.880
of your book through the course of our conversation

16
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.840
today. But you start the book by talking about

17
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.880
the 2007, 2009 financial crisis and sort of its

18
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.279
aftermath. So why was it such an important historical

19
00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.860
event?

20
00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.159
I'd grown up during a period of relative prosperity

21
00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.319
in the UK. We, it was the new Labour

22
00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.480
era and you know, it's not like there were

23
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.720
no problems, but there was a boom, right, and

24
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.830
uh Gordon Brown, the Chancellor and then Prime Minister,

25
00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:13.389
was always saying there's no return to boom and

26
00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:16.440
bust. So there was just this feeling that, you

27
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.680
know, things were getting better, they were getting better

28
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.080
for the average person, and there was inequality and

29
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.639
there were, you know, concerns like climate change and

30
00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:25.120
so on, and there was the Iraq war, of

31
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.120
course, but. I think there was a general optimism,

32
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.489
um, and there were, there were things like investment

33
00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:33.650
in social services that New Labour made. So it

34
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.760
just felt like I hadn't thought about the economy

35
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.419
at all, and that's partly because I was like

36
00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:40.930
12, so fair enough. But also, it just wasn't

37
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.800
a problem, right, and then all of a sudden

38
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.690
in 2007 when I was 16 and I first

39
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.239
started studying economics coincidentally, it was a big problem.

40
00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:52.209
It was a massive problem. All of a sudden

41
00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.250
the economy was collapsing, people were talking about, you

42
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.540
know. Uh, CASH machines are gonna stop, stop spitting

43
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.059
cash out, and uh there was just this real

44
00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:08.250
sense of dread and. That was, that was, um.

45
00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.910
It it was it it came as a surprise

46
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.309
to everybody, right? It, it was, nobody really saw

47
00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:17.789
it coming. The politicians didn't see it coming, but

48
00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.619
it seemed like economists hadn't seen it coming either.

49
00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:23.309
And so I was thinking, well, OK, it seemed

50
00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.660
like things were going relatively well, then all of

51
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.470
a sudden we have this massive crash. Nobody really

52
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.630
understands what happened, nobody foresaw it. Uh, IT seems

53
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.710
like economics might be a pretty important subject, right?

54
00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:37.869
It might be a good thing that I've just

55
00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:40.520
started to study this subject at high school. So

56
00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:42.850
that was extremely formative for me. It convinced me

57
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.649
not just cos I had reasons for studying economics

58
00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:47.369
just that I found it interesting. I thought there

59
00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:50.210
was, you know, er, it was a fascinating subject

60
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.880
in itself, but this added like a sort of

61
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.570
a a political reason to study it really, like

62
00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.289
it gave um renewed validation for my decision to

63
00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.729
study it.

64
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.389
And of course, talking about its aftermath, many governments

65
00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.990
across the world in response to it implemented austerity

66
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.169
measures. I mean, what do you make of austerity?

67
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.899
Does it work in any way?

68
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.270
I think it's a terrible idea. I think that

69
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.059
it's almost never works. I can imagine a situation

70
00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:24.330
where the state is too bloated in certain countries

71
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.589
and if you're going through an economic boom, then

72
00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:28.149
you might have some room to trim the fat,

73
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.779
but that's certainly not the situation. I mean. If

74
00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.300
you're talking about Keynesian economics, where you've got like

75
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.240
countercyclical fiscal policy, right, where you invest in a,

76
00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.449
in a downturn and you you push the economy

77
00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.619
out of that slump, um, and then you look

78
00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.779
at maybe making some cuts when you're back in

79
00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.300
the boom. Uh, AND this was kind of what

80
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.300
Labour, uh, were doing. I don't want to sound

81
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.339
like a Labour stan, um, but that's what they

82
00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:52.800
were doing before the coalition took office and, and

83
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.300
the economy was growing and public and the deficit

84
00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.029
was shrinking. And uh then, then we decided on

85
00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:05.669
this extremely harsh set of austerity measures. Now, ostensibly

86
00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.869
the idea was that it would shrink the deficit.

87
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.240
It turns out it actually didn't really do that

88
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.800
because it's kind of self-defeating, right? It's a false

89
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.559
economy. You take money out of the economy, you

90
00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:18.480
stop investing in the things that really matter to

91
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.450
people, public services, er, local services, health and education.

92
00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:25.190
That's, that's not good for anyone, that's not a

93
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.670
solid foundation for a, for a thriving economy. So

94
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.380
this is why they missed their, their deficit targets.

95
00:04:31.549 --> 00:04:33.910
So they thought that they'd, uh, we'd be in

96
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.549
the black by 2015. When that rolled around, I

97
00:04:37.549 --> 00:04:40.269
think the deficit was still like over 4% of

98
00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:43.829
GDP and it took until 2019 to get, to

99
00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:47.380
get to like a balanced budget. So. In the

100
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.660
meantime, we had much lower growth, uh, you know,

101
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.630
you expect to recover in a sort of V

102
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.980
shape, typically after a recession. That wasn't, it was,

103
00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:56.380
you know, it was more of a sort of

104
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.480
L shape. It was a really slow recovery. You

105
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.619
had the hollowing out of public services of a

106
00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:05.609
lot of physical and social infrastructure across the country.

107
00:05:05.859 --> 00:05:08.649
You had things like Wages stagnating, especially for the

108
00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:11.290
poorest, for public sector workers, they had a pay

109
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.730
freeze for like a decade or more. It's only

110
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.440
recently that they've actually had a substantial raise some,

111
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.529
you know, doctors and nurses and teachers and so

112
00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.489
on. So you really just had this economic stagnation

113
00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:25.010
since then and it's really interesting cos the financial

114
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.630
crisis was. Clearly always going to be a terrible

115
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.589
thing, and you know, there was no avoiding it

116
00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:33.790
once the once the sort of uh the seeds

117
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.390
were sown for for things to collapse. But the

118
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.670
way we reacted to it is really what I

119
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.170
think has caused um our current malaise, it's what's

120
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.510
caused the problems that we have now, and that

121
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.350
was primarily. Austerity, um, and even, I mean we

122
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.750
can get into this, I don't want to skip

123
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.630
ahead too much, but even things like Brexit, right,

124
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.589
there's evidence that the areas that were more exposed

125
00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.670
to austerity were more likely to vote leave, right,

126
00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:02.339
and then Brexit added further to our cost of,

127
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.709
uh, cost of living, it, you know, was even

128
00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:06.910
worse for the economy, and we've just been in

129
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.390
this downward spiral, right, just lurching from thing to

130
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.109
thing, and this is before I even mentioned the

131
00:06:11.109 --> 00:06:11.660
pandemic.

132
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.640
Yeah, and we're certainly get, uh, going to get

133
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.519
into some of the consequences that that we are

134
00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:24.119
still experiencing right now, uh, some of the consequences

135
00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:28.670
of, of the economic crisis back in 2007, 2009.

136
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.109
But, uh, I mean, we talk a lot about

137
00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:34.279
the economy, the economy, the economy, uh, and we're

138
00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.880
going to do that also today a lot. So

139
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.320
what is the economy?

140
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.079
It's a really good question. What, what is the

141
00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:47.799
economy? I think the economy is. Fundamentally it's not,

142
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.250
it's not tangible, right, it's an idea, but I

143
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.059
think when people talk about the economy, um, they're

144
00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:58.059
talking about a kind of sphere that is separated

145
00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:01.540
from politics and society, right? They're talking about this

146
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.220
sphere where money rules, where there's, you know, competition,

147
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.700
where things um sort of sustain in a, in

148
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:16.940
a spiral and. Through through competition, through private enterprise,

149
00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:20.450
it creates kind of overall productivity gains, overall growth,

150
00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:22.859
and it just seems to be to have a

151
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:25.660
mind of its own, the economy, right, so people

152
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.179
say like, oh this will be good for the

153
00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:30.179
economy, this will be bad for the economy, and

154
00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:32.100
there's this idea that there are like rules to

155
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.609
how the economy functions. If you pass this regulation,

156
00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:37.179
this is gonna, you know, uh be good for

157
00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:39.019
the economy if you pass that regulation, it's gonna

158
00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:42.299
be bad for the economy, and it's something which

159
00:07:42.299 --> 00:07:46.019
is. Relatively modern. Now I think when most people

160
00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:48.980
say the economy they probably mean GDP. They probably

161
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.820
mean like GDP growth, right, that, that is, that

162
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.980
is generally what people have in mind, so they're

163
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.899
talking about whether growth is going to be higher

164
00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:57.779
or lower, and that's something that like the current

165
00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:01.179
government has committed to. But I also think that

166
00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:03.380
it's a little bit more complicated than that because.

167
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.839
You know, the Tories, they, they were talking about

168
00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:08.959
the deficit, they were talking about the public debt

169
00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:12.239
and deficit as the economy, right, and sometimes in

170
00:08:12.239 --> 00:08:14.000
the cost of living crisis, people would be like,

171
00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:16.589
you know, oh, the economy, the economy's gone wrong,

172
00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:19.920
right, uh because we've got inflation. So there's, there's

173
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.200
lots of different metrics, but above all, I think

174
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.279
it's something that is, people perceive as separate and

175
00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:29.799
people perceive as quite hard to understand, uh, operating

176
00:08:29.799 --> 00:08:32.840
with rules that we, you know, can't necessarily fathom.

177
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.330
And that's, yeah, that, that, that's basically something which

178
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.049
I think is relatively recent. I think we only

179
00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:42.840
really started to talk about it in the 20th

180
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.849
century. And then there's this question of whether, you

181
00:08:45.849 --> 00:08:48.770
know, is how separate is the economy, um, is

182
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.650
it defined by GDP? Is there another way to

183
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:51.479
think about all this?

184
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.419
Mhm. Yes, and we're going to get into the

185
00:08:54.419 --> 00:08:57.380
topic of GDP later on, but I, I mean,

186
00:08:57.619 --> 00:09:01.460
talking about wealth, how is wealth created? Where does

187
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.429
wealth come from?

188
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.869
00 God, yeah, I mean, where does wealth come

189
00:09:05.869 --> 00:09:08.780
from, right? I think, look, I don't think anybody

190
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.179
has a really good answer to this question. I

191
00:09:11.179 --> 00:09:14.140
think all you can say is that. It's some

192
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:19.450
very complicated combination of um nature, you know, uh,

193
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.059
natural resources, even, you know, the sun um you

194
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.780
you can say that it's labor, for sure, labor,

195
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.780
you know, you have to work to produce output

196
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:34.020
or goods and services and um also, you know,

197
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:40.650
capital like machines, um that increase productivity and. Much

198
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.780
more ethereal things like, you know, um, knowledge and

199
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.580
skills, arguably that they could be considered one of

200
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.299
the most important things for wealth creation. I don't

201
00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:52.809
think anybody has a, a really, really good answer

202
00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:55.179
to this question. I think almost every explanation that

203
00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:57.700
you get ends up saying, well, you know, we,

204
00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.859
we say, we say it's these measurable things and

205
00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:02.909
then there's like a huge unmeasurable bit. There's just

206
00:10:02.909 --> 00:10:05.270
like the gap between the measurable things and like

207
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.950
usually GDP right, it's like, where does, where does

208
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.869
that come from? I think we, we do struggle

209
00:10:09.869 --> 00:10:15.039
to truly truly know, but. What the, what, what's

210
00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:20.219
for sure, I think, is that the um. The

211
00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:23.979
process of the economy becoming a separate sphere that

212
00:10:23.979 --> 00:10:26.979
we just, we just spoke about, that is what

213
00:10:26.979 --> 00:10:30.140
has given rise to the massive material standard of

214
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.690
living we have today, one way or another, right,

215
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.169
and through that process of like increased, increased productivity,

216
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:42.030
you get. Massive wealth creation and modern living standards

217
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.909
on average. I, I wish I had, if I

218
00:10:44.909 --> 00:10:46.630
had the answer to what creates wealth, you know,

219
00:10:46.789 --> 00:10:49.429
I, I'd be, I might be rich, but like

220
00:10:49.429 --> 00:10:51.380
I, I, I don't really, it's, it's still quite

221
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.549
mysterious, but I think really you have to look

222
00:10:54.549 --> 00:10:56.510
at like the birth of the economy and the

223
00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.349
birth of capitalism to, to try and understand what

224
00:11:00.349 --> 00:11:02.030
gives rise to modern living standards.

225
00:11:02.659 --> 00:11:05.739
Mhm. Yes, and I mean, in a bit, we're

226
00:11:05.739 --> 00:11:09.169
going to get into billionaires. It's something that you

227
00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:11.659
also talk about in your book, but do you

228
00:11:11.659 --> 00:11:15.260
think that we need the capitalist class in general?

229
00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:17.020
I mean, are those who were in a lot

230
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:22.059
of money necessary engines of investment and wealth creation

231
00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:25.179
as some people would argue, or are they just

232
00:11:25.179 --> 00:11:27.729
extracting wealth from the rest of us?

233
00:11:30.299 --> 00:11:34.780
That is the question, isn't it? And certainly the

234
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.750
capitalist class, the emergence of capitalism does see what

235
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.780
Marx famously called the MCM prime circuit, where you

236
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.179
know you invest money in, you get commodities C

237
00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:47.809
for sale on the market, and then you get

238
00:11:48.059 --> 00:11:51.539
M which is hopefully higher, higher than M, right,

239
00:11:51.619 --> 00:11:53.369
and then you can reinvest that and you get,

240
00:11:53.419 --> 00:11:57.030
that's exactly the self-sustaining cycle we're talking about. So

241
00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:01.650
that forces up material living standards over the long

242
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.869
term and on average, of course that glosses over

243
00:12:03.869 --> 00:12:05.669
a lot of what goes on under the surface

244
00:12:05.669 --> 00:12:08.780
there, it's not all good, uh, for sure. Um,

245
00:12:08.789 --> 00:12:12.229
SO that's, that's the role of capitalism historically, right?

246
00:12:12.369 --> 00:12:14.619
That, that's the role of the capitalist class historically,

247
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.830
and it's something that we, we only really saw

248
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.390
emerge in the English countryside in, in like, you

249
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:27.239
know, 16th, 17th century. It's historically unique. Whether it

250
00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:32.770
was necessary um for industrialization, I'm not sure. My

251
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.340
bottom line is that it's happened and I think

252
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.219
that. For better or for worse, it's left us

253
00:12:39.219 --> 00:12:44.059
the globe. As a capitalist economy with a very

254
00:12:44.059 --> 00:12:47.570
high average material standard of living, what I would

255
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.130
argue is that now increasingly it seems that the

256
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.849
the capitalist class are extracting wealth more and more,

257
00:12:55.059 --> 00:12:58.150
and you see things like, you know, tech billionaires,

258
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.219
you just mentioned, right, you see their platforms where

259
00:13:01.219 --> 00:13:04.260
people have to pay their platforms basically to have

260
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.729
a presence online. Yanis Varoufakis has talked about this.

261
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.640
Um, YOU see things like the, the overt corruption

262
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.929
of politics, right, by, by this class, and I

263
00:13:14.929 --> 00:13:18.289
think clearly once you get to a certain material

264
00:13:18.289 --> 00:13:20.520
standard of living and also a standard of like

265
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.950
education. And awareness, I think you want, you want

266
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.390
to be looking at systems where you can, you

267
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.549
can move away from capitalism as we know it

268
00:13:28.549 --> 00:13:32.229
and where people like the workers, er consumers, er

269
00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:35.580
local communities can have more control over the production

270
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.960
process and. Pursue other aims than just, you know,

271
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.039
profit and and growth and efficiency.

272
00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:45.169
But do you, do you think we can say

273
00:13:45.169 --> 00:13:49.650
that the, the economy has been organized to favor

274
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:50.729
the capitalists?

275
00:13:51.619 --> 00:13:53.510
I think so, yeah, I think you've seen a

276
00:13:53.510 --> 00:14:00.030
number of policy changes recently. I mean, there's. Probably

277
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.640
the, the primary example which sticks in my mind

278
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.919
for obvious reasons now is like how we've dealt

279
00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:08.840
with monopolies and these tech monopolies, because antitrust law,

280
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.159
which is supposed to address monopolies, has just not

281
00:14:11.159 --> 00:14:14.719
been concerned with what these people have been doing

282
00:14:14.719 --> 00:14:18.200
really. The antitrust has been saying if the prices

283
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.719
are low, then there's no problem, there's no monopoly,

284
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.719
right, because monopolies raise prices. So if they're not

285
00:14:23.719 --> 00:14:29.969
raising prices, why complain? What that misses is that

286
00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:34.450
these people generally build what amount to economic empires,

287
00:14:34.489 --> 00:14:37.960
right, so take Amazon. Amazon, like very low prices,

288
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.760
everyone can agree that Amazon provides a wide variety

289
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.840
of products at very low prices and the astonishing

290
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.000
level of convenience. What they don't see is quite

291
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.559
how much control Amazon has over the industry, over,

292
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.950
you know, online, um, and marketing services, you have

293
00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.119
to use them for that. If you're gonna sell

294
00:14:59.119 --> 00:15:01.710
anything online, you'll probably encounter Amazon at some point.

295
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:06.640
Their logistics network, their incredible global logistics network, right,

296
00:15:07.109 --> 00:15:09.710
even things like credit facilities, and they can just

297
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.950
squeeze out any competitors, and really there are no

298
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.669
competitors to Amazon, right, and they have, they have

299
00:15:14.669 --> 00:15:17.450
a long history of, of squeezing out competitors. Anyone

300
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.710
who sort of rears their, their ugly head will

301
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.909
be, will be cut down and and er pushed

302
00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:25.900
out. So. That for me is like a policy

303
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.950
failure, and it's allowing these companies to grow way

304
00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.429
too big uh in their own industries and then

305
00:15:31.429 --> 00:15:33.450
allowing as well, on top of everything I just

306
00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.349
said, someone like Jeff Bezos, right, can start to

307
00:15:36.349 --> 00:15:39.590
invest in other industries entirely. So his enormous wealth

308
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.190
gives him power over the media. He bought the

309
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.190
Washington Post and he sends Katy Perry to space

310
00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.469
for no reason, you know what I mean, it's

311
00:15:45.469 --> 00:15:48.630
just like. If they can do everything, right, or

312
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.390
anything I should say, and then it seems like

313
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:54.000
increasing areas of not just our economy but like

314
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.799
our lives, right? You're talking about the media, you're

315
00:15:56.799 --> 00:15:58.969
talking about space exploration, you know, you're talking about

316
00:15:58.969 --> 00:16:02.880
all these things, they're just dominated by billionaires and

317
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.640
I just don't think that's a good thing in

318
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.799
any way, shape or form.

319
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.390
So in exploring the topic of how we could

320
00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.830
organize our economy in different ways in your book,

321
00:16:14.109 --> 00:16:17.429
you talk about the example of football clubs in

322
00:16:17.429 --> 00:16:20.830
Germany. So tell us about that and how they

323
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.539
illustrate the ways we could do things differently.

324
00:16:24.849 --> 00:16:27.469
Germany's a really interesting case study because I, I

325
00:16:27.469 --> 00:16:32.419
really like Germany because it's real. It exists and

326
00:16:32.789 --> 00:16:34.869
it's really interesting because in some of the reviews

327
00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:37.619
of my book I've seen. In places like maybe

328
00:16:37.619 --> 00:16:39.770
the Financial Times, which were obviously a bit more,

329
00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.690
you know, orthodox, um, I, I get the, oh,

330
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.059
you know, you're you're unrealistic, a bit optimistic, a

331
00:16:47.059 --> 00:16:50.070
bit utopian with your solutions. And I'm just thinking

332
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.400
like Germany, it's just like, it's just across, it's

333
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.659
just across like the way, it's just over in

334
00:16:55.659 --> 00:16:58.219
Europe. It's ridiculous like for people to say that's

335
00:16:58.219 --> 00:17:01.919
utopian and what they do. Right, is that they,

336
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:06.608
they just have much more control over their industries,

337
00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.829
right, and that can come in numerous forms. So

338
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.618
with football, which you mentioned, they have the 50+1

339
00:17:11.618 --> 00:17:13.790
rule, which means that the fans own the football

340
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.098
clubs, uh, a major, a majority stake in the

341
00:17:16.098 --> 00:17:19.300
football clubs, and they're not thought of really as

342
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.939
consumers as we are. And the result is that

343
00:17:21.939 --> 00:17:26.029
German football. You know, it's very high quality, uh,

344
00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:30.239
it's ticket prices are lower, it's much more in

345
00:17:30.239 --> 00:17:33.159
touch with local communities. Uh, THERE'S a really good

346
00:17:33.159 --> 00:17:36.918
atmosphere at these, these German games, right? And yeah,

347
00:17:37.038 --> 00:17:41.119
it, it's just much more holistically run, you know,

348
00:17:41.198 --> 00:17:44.399
in the interests of, of the population, in the

349
00:17:44.399 --> 00:17:46.958
interests of Germans. Now you contrast that with the

350
00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:50.399
premier Premiership, right? Now the Premiership is is amazing.

351
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.869
In the UK it is, it is probably the

352
00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:54.390
best football in the world, maybe I'm just saying

353
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.109
that because I'm, I'm English, but uh, but it's

354
00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:59.869
probably true, it's it is probably true, right, and

355
00:17:59.869 --> 00:18:02.069
that and that's, look, this is, this is, this

356
00:18:02.069 --> 00:18:04.709
is capitalism, right, like there's so much investment, there's

357
00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.829
so much money in it, yeah, you've got incredible

358
00:18:06.829 --> 00:18:09.630
teams there, absolutely, and the standard of football I

359
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.709
think is better than than Germany, but then you

360
00:18:12.709 --> 00:18:15.829
have to ask at what cost, right, because now.

361
00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.579
Communities who live close to stadiums have been priced

362
00:18:19.579 --> 00:18:22.099
out, you've got an increasing use of like executive

363
00:18:22.099 --> 00:18:25.900
boxes, clubs are just much less connected to, to

364
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.099
their communities, and this is, and this is the

365
00:18:28.099 --> 00:18:32.410
thing, right? Football's gone from being somewhere where, you

366
00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:35.060
know, people could gather and congregate and even people,

367
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.010
you know, there were political gatherings after football matches

368
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.930
in the past. It's just not really, it's just

369
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.969
not really possible anymore. So I think we've kind

370
00:18:42.969 --> 00:18:45.729
of sacrificed that on, on the altar of efficiency

371
00:18:45.729 --> 00:18:47.729
because the, the Premier League is a very, very

372
00:18:47.729 --> 00:18:51.280
capitalist league. And it's great for the, for the

373
00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.390
football at times, but there are, there are I

374
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.869
think long term costs to the country that aren't

375
00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:59.949
considered, and Germany just manages those different things much

376
00:18:59.949 --> 00:19:02.400
better while still boasting excellent football.

377
00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:05.880
Yeah. By the way, for people who do not

378
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.680
follow the Bundesliga, Bayern Munich just got, uh, a

379
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.160
new title yesterday. They are champions of Germany and

380
00:19:14.439 --> 00:19:17.560
Harry Kane finally got his, the first title ever

381
00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.280
in his career. So,

382
00:19:19.599 --> 00:19:22.680
yeah, yeah, he deserves that. Yeah. I mean, Bayern

383
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.655
Munich do win almost every season. I do have

384
00:19:24.655 --> 00:19:26.775
that's that's why I was saying, but they didn't

385
00:19:26.775 --> 00:19:27.685
win last season,

386
00:19:28.015 --> 00:19:30.334
so yeah, yeah, yeah, it was, yeah, yeah, yeah.

387
00:19:32.354 --> 00:19:35.454
So, but I mean, this is something that we

388
00:19:35.454 --> 00:19:39.015
were confronted with during the pande during the COVID-19

389
00:19:39.015 --> 00:19:42.974
pandemic. Who really makes the economy? I mean, who

390
00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:45.494
is essential for the economy.

391
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.349
The mystery of wealth creation, I think is, like

392
00:19:49.349 --> 00:19:51.469
I said, still a mystery, right? I, I don't

393
00:19:51.469 --> 00:19:56.060
know if energy creates wealth, if labor creates wealth,

394
00:19:56.189 --> 00:19:59.770
if human capital and skills and knowledge create wealth,

395
00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.790
or if it's just some messy combination of all

396
00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.119
of them. What we can say, I like to

397
00:20:05.119 --> 00:20:09.209
stick to what we can say, right? In the

398
00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:12.530
pandemic, it became very clear who we truly depend

399
00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.459
on. And I think that that is, those are

400
00:20:16.459 --> 00:20:19.739
the workers who produce things that we need that

401
00:20:19.739 --> 00:20:21.739
are fundamental to our standard of living. Now you

402
00:20:21.739 --> 00:20:23.729
can talk about obvious things like food and water,

403
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.140
shelter and clothing. I do think there are things

404
00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.579
like health and education, obviously health especially in the

405
00:20:28.579 --> 00:20:32.979
pandemic, even things like entertainment, you know, um, people

406
00:20:32.979 --> 00:20:36.969
wanted streaming services to continue during the pandemic, obviously.

407
00:20:37.709 --> 00:20:40.030
You know, 100,000 years ago we didn't have those,

408
00:20:40.109 --> 00:20:42.140
and, uh, you know, even, even 20 years ago

409
00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.750
really, we didn't have them. So, but with the

410
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.430
need for entertainment is, is fundamental as well, and

411
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.229
that's, that's how we deliver that now. So there

412
00:20:51.229 --> 00:20:53.989
are all these needs and what really struck me

413
00:20:53.989 --> 00:20:57.829
during the pandemic was how quickly everybody, the politicians,

414
00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:02.109
The population, right, and you know, economists and analysts,

415
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.630
they were like, oh yeah, the essential workers, right,

416
00:21:04.709 --> 00:21:08.060
we'll just keep the essential workers on. Not, not

417
00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.510
like, not like hedge fund managers, not people who

418
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.010
work in marketing, not academics or YouTubers, right? Like

419
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:17.780
we're talking about like the bus drivers, the farmers,

420
00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:22.069
the nurses, and everybody just knew like who it

421
00:21:22.069 --> 00:21:24.189
was. And it just really struck me everyone, it

422
00:21:24.189 --> 00:21:26.219
wasn't. Like it wasn't like, oh no, who are

423
00:21:26.219 --> 00:21:28.020
the essential workers, we're gonna have to do loads

424
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.369
of detailed analysis and try and figure that out.

425
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.660
No, everybody fucking knows like who, who keeps, who

426
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.140
keeps us uh you know, living and thriving. Everybody

427
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.619
knew that. Um AND it was just really funny

428
00:21:39.619 --> 00:21:42.939
to me because that really cut through these sometimes

429
00:21:42.939 --> 00:21:46.329
abstract debates about wealth creation and things like, you

430
00:21:46.329 --> 00:21:48.310
know, who gets paid more, who deserves to get

431
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:52.010
paid more. What's really concerning to me. As well,

432
00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.260
is that, you know, essential workers on the whole

433
00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.339
tend to get paid less. I think there was

434
00:21:57.339 --> 00:21:58.780
this review in the US that looked at the

435
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.410
pay of essential workers and it's about 15% less

436
00:22:01.699 --> 00:22:03.140
than the average worker, and I think if you

437
00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.500
take doctors out of that, doctors are in the

438
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.900
rare position of being an essential worker and being

439
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.339
paid quite well. If you take doctors out of

440
00:22:09.339 --> 00:22:11.579
that, the gap's even bigger. You know, how much

441
00:22:11.579 --> 00:22:14.099
do bus drivers get paid compared to investment bankers,

442
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.180
the gap's massive. Uh, AND that just really worries

443
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.510
me because one thing. Again, you know, I saw

444
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.189
a review of my book. I, I'm using this

445
00:22:22.189 --> 00:22:23.949
as a platform to vent about reviews of my

446
00:22:23.949 --> 00:22:26.390
book I didn't like, uh, but I, I saw

447
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.109
a review of my book that was say that

448
00:22:28.109 --> 00:22:30.959
was. Acted like I was arguing that everything other

449
00:22:30.959 --> 00:22:34.119
than essential workers is completely unnecessary and you know,

450
00:22:34.199 --> 00:22:36.760
we shouldn't have any banking sector or anything. No,

451
00:22:36.849 --> 00:22:39.079
I wasn't saying that. What I'm saying is, why

452
00:22:39.079 --> 00:22:41.520
do we know who the essential workers are, and

453
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.680
they're worst paid, worst treated, work longer hours than

454
00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.160
everybody else? How can we recognize that, that those

455
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.229
are the people who are fundamental for human society

456
00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:53.640
and then treat, basically treat them like shit and

457
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.550
pay them nothing and and do that. You know,

458
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.229
during the pandemic, and then go and then um

459
00:22:59.229 --> 00:23:01.349
what, recognize them during the pandemic, and then just

460
00:23:01.349 --> 00:23:03.660
go back to the way it was before. It

461
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.699
it's just completely outrageous, and for me that's really,

462
00:23:07.589 --> 00:23:10.660
that's just really telling and it. Is a much

463
00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.500
more simple idea than, you know, these debates about

464
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.219
wealth creation which I think are really unsolved, because

465
00:23:17.219 --> 00:23:20.699
I think almost anybody would find it hard to

466
00:23:20.699 --> 00:23:24.349
justify, you know, why we can do that one

467
00:23:24.349 --> 00:23:26.609
minute, say those are the essential workers, it's simple,

468
00:23:26.699 --> 00:23:28.689
we know who they are, we depend on them,

469
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.819
and then the next minute just. Pay them absolutely

470
00:23:32.819 --> 00:23:33.410
nothing.

471
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.810
Yeah, so going back to the topic of billionaires

472
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.939
just for a minute, what should we make of

473
00:23:40.939 --> 00:23:43.449
them? I mean, are they bad for the economy?

474
00:23:43.479 --> 00:23:46.219
What kinds of impact do they have on the

475
00:23:46.219 --> 00:23:49.420
economy, politics, and society?

476
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.089
The way I think about billionaires is less as

477
00:23:55.089 --> 00:23:58.130
really rich people who have nice things, although they

478
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:02.689
are that too. It's more as people who have

479
00:24:02.689 --> 00:24:06.250
a lot of power and control over the economy,

480
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.890
people who are able to exert control over their

481
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.020
own industries, and you can see this. From how

482
00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.180
they operate in their own industries, right, from, from

483
00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.619
the start, someone like Jeff Bezos, he wanted to

484
00:24:17.619 --> 00:24:20.339
corner the market. He has always exerted a lot

485
00:24:20.339 --> 00:24:23.140
of control over his workers. Amazon workers are monitored

486
00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:27.060
like like nobody's business. It's a quite a dystopian

487
00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.800
uh picture in in any, any Amazon warehouse. Um,

488
00:24:30.859 --> 00:24:33.180
SO they exert control over their own industries, but

489
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.739
then they reach, reach out into other areas, and

490
00:24:36.739 --> 00:24:40.579
they just want to have influence and power and

491
00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:43.699
control. And their money enables them to do that

492
00:24:43.699 --> 00:24:45.979
and their money in combination with, you know, current

493
00:24:45.979 --> 00:24:49.459
competition laws where mergers and acquisitions are often uh

494
00:24:49.459 --> 00:24:54.099
allowed and and justified. This just makes them economic

495
00:24:54.099 --> 00:24:58.140
kings, right? It gives them so much power, and

496
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.339
I contrast millionaires with billionaires, right, so um well

497
00:25:01.339 --> 00:25:03.699
I contrast billionaires with millionaires I should say. Uh

498
00:25:03.699 --> 00:25:07.050
SO millionaires, you know, being a millionaire is great.

499
00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.819
I'd love to be a millionaire, you know, you,

500
00:25:08.839 --> 00:25:11.300
you'd have a nice house, um, you'd have plenty

501
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.869
of nice things, you'd be comfortable, but. You don't

502
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.400
really influence politics, you don't you influence your own

503
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.040
world, that's great for your own world, but at

504
00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.199
this stage you're nowhere near the level of power

505
00:25:23.199 --> 00:25:26.390
that a billionaire's gonna have, right? And this is,

506
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.920
this is the difference, because a billionaire can just

507
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.109
summon a whole army of people, a whole bunch

508
00:25:32.109 --> 00:25:35.540
of resources, and just be like, I'm going to

509
00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.829
engage in this massive project. It could be anything,

510
00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:40.109
it could be buying Twitter like Elon Musk did,

511
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.150
or it could be, uh, you know, going to

512
00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.869
space, or it could be, um, you know, trying

513
00:25:44.869 --> 00:25:48.209
to build a. Uh, NETWORK of tunnels under Las

514
00:25:48.209 --> 00:25:50.569
Vegas, which ends up not really working, but it

515
00:25:50.569 --> 00:25:54.089
could be anything, right, they just have almost unlimited

516
00:25:54.089 --> 00:25:58.160
influence, and that is really what distinguishes like a,

517
00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.569
a millionaire from a billionaire in in my head.

518
00:26:01.939 --> 00:26:06.290
And why have billionaires grown so much in number

519
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:09.689
over the past few decades? Maybe that also speaks

520
00:26:09.689 --> 00:26:13.650
to the rising levels of inequality that we've seen

521
00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.290
not only in particular countries but also on a

522
00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.530
more global scale. I mean, why has that happened?

523
00:26:22.329 --> 00:26:26.699
We've certainly reduced taxes on, on the very richest.

524
00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.329
I mean that, that much is clear, right, they

525
00:26:29.329 --> 00:26:34.010
were reduced from about 80%, top marginal tax rate

526
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.410
in the 80s, and now they're down to somewhere

527
00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.250
between 40 and 50%, um, depending on where you

528
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.010
are. So that, that's a pretty straightforward way that

529
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:45.920
the richest have increased their, their um their lot.

530
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.329
But the thing again with billionaires, it's funny, isn't

531
00:26:48.329 --> 00:26:52.380
it, because it's wealth, um not income. And I

532
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.839
think, you know, I've spoken to some of the,

533
00:26:54.849 --> 00:26:58.219
the changes in competition policy and antitrust policy, how

534
00:26:58.219 --> 00:27:02.140
big companies are allowed to become, uh, I think

535
00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.540
that's fed into it as well. Um I also

536
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:11.140
think that especially Anglo-American economies are very financialized, so

537
00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.000
a lot of things run through the stock market

538
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.280
now. I think a lot of things are, you

539
00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.599
know, the, the financing is done largely through the

540
00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:21.699
stock market and through like venture capital, and so

541
00:27:21.699 --> 00:27:24.869
you get this balance sheet wealth, right, you get

542
00:27:24.869 --> 00:27:27.680
that and you can use that as like collateral

543
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.709
if you want to do something like by Twitter.

544
00:27:30.079 --> 00:27:32.239
So I think there is like the fact that

545
00:27:32.239 --> 00:27:34.800
we don't tax them is probably front and center,

546
00:27:34.839 --> 00:27:37.650
that's like the number one thing I would say,

547
00:27:37.719 --> 00:27:39.530
we need to tax them, but I do think

548
00:27:39.839 --> 00:27:44.030
the amount of leeway that. They have in running

549
00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.229
their industries and also the role of like an

550
00:27:47.229 --> 00:27:50.709
increasingly financialized economy, those things also come into it.

551
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:55.329
Do you think it is possible for anyone to

552
00:27:55.329 --> 00:28:00.369
become a billionaire without exploiting other people and the

553
00:28:00.369 --> 00:28:01.400
system itself?

554
00:28:02.739 --> 00:28:05.290
I mean, I'm a big Taylor Swift fan, so

555
00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:10.209
I do. I do feel obliged to defend her

556
00:28:10.209 --> 00:28:13.099
as someone who, I mean she she's the first.

557
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.359
Uh, MUSICIAN to make, uh, to become a billionaire

558
00:28:17.359 --> 00:28:19.479
solely from like music, she doesn't sell any merchandise,

559
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.959
but you, and, and yeah, I don't wanna stand

560
00:28:22.959 --> 00:28:25.959
for her too much. Uh, GENERALLY speaking, her employees

561
00:28:25.959 --> 00:28:27.560
don't complain about her as well, they say she's

562
00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.079
actually a really good boss, but can you, I

563
00:28:30.079 --> 00:28:32.800
mean, I don't know, even then you've got things

564
00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.270
like intellectual property right, and, and intellectual property. Um,

565
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.520
IS something which I completely understand the rationale for

566
00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.000
it. It's like, you know, I'm a creator, creators

567
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.319
should have rights over what they do, they should

568
00:28:45.319 --> 00:28:46.949
be able to make money from what they do,

569
00:28:47.089 --> 00:28:48.959
but it is very much a winner take all

570
00:28:48.959 --> 00:28:51.800
system and once you get big enough, you have

571
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.439
a lot of money accruing to the biggest. You

572
00:28:54.439 --> 00:28:58.260
can see this in any creative endeavor, music. It's

573
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.579
winner take all, Taylor Swift's a billionaire, most musicians

574
00:29:00.579 --> 00:29:03.619
don't make anything. Uh, IT'S like Twitch, Twitch streamers,

575
00:29:03.699 --> 00:29:07.180
the biggest Twitch streamers like Hassan, make millions. Most

576
00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.069
Twitch, I I stream on Twitch. I, I get

577
00:29:09.069 --> 00:29:11.380
paid like 100 pounds a year, uh, from my

578
00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.890
Twitch streams, right? It's like, I don't get anything

579
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.780
from it. So I do think we've got this

580
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.849
dynamic of this winner take all market, um. And

581
00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:23.859
we need to really rethink how that works so

582
00:29:23.859 --> 00:29:28.699
that there's more democratic payment, uh a democratic distribution

583
00:29:28.699 --> 00:29:32.780
of payments to people. And I, to answer your

584
00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:37.560
question, I think exploited is a contentious word, but

585
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.140
I, I basically, I do think that every billionaire

586
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.979
is a policy failure, and if someone is a

587
00:29:42.979 --> 00:29:44.739
billionaire, we need to be looking at a way

588
00:29:44.739 --> 00:29:48.329
that to design our systems to. Benefit the average

589
00:29:48.329 --> 00:29:51.130
person more and you know take resources from the

590
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.130
billionaire and and and give them to the, you

591
00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:55.760
know, the average musician. The average musician should make

592
00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.010
more money and Taylor Swift should make less. And

593
00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:00.050
she's like the best possible example. This is before

594
00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.119
I even get into like, you know, the really

595
00:30:02.119 --> 00:30:03.449
truly horrible billionaires.

596
00:30:04.449 --> 00:30:08.569
Yeah, uh, another thing that we can associate with

597
00:30:08.569 --> 00:30:12.000
billionaires is billionaire philanthropy. I mean, do you think

598
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.770
it really helps people? What kinds of impact does

599
00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:17.089
it have on society?

600
00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.060
You know, it's, it's a really tough argument to

601
00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.280
make. I think someone like Mr. Beast is a

602
00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.459
really good example. So I don't talk about him

603
00:30:26.459 --> 00:30:28.380
in the book, but he is a good example

604
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.500
because most people, when they see a Mr. Beast

605
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.020
thumbnail that's like, I, you know, cured blindness for

606
00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:40.599
1000 children, uh, they're like, that looks good. And

607
00:30:40.599 --> 00:30:43.719
you're like, yeah, it does, that's kind of difficult

608
00:30:43.719 --> 00:30:47.250
to argue with, right? So uh but there's a

609
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:52.969
really there's a complexity underneath that. Now the question

610
00:30:52.969 --> 00:30:56.670
is really not whether we should be curing blindness

611
00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.719
in children, which we obviously should, it's whether that

612
00:30:59.719 --> 00:31:03.479
should be channeled through people like Mr. Beast and

613
00:31:03.479 --> 00:31:05.239
through people like Bill Gates, who's made a lot

614
00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:08.709
of philanthropic efforts. And I think the problem here.

615
00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.160
Right, is that OK, they will do plenty of

616
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.000
good things, but the moment that clashes with their

617
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.800
bottom line, the moment that clashes with their image

618
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.319
that they want to project, right, then what's gonna

619
00:31:21.319 --> 00:31:23.520
come first? Of course it's gonna be their bottom

620
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.199
line. Now Mr. Beast has been the subject of

621
00:31:25.199 --> 00:31:28.199
a lot of controversy. Uh, A number of things,

622
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.959
how he treats his employees, how he makes his

623
00:31:30.959 --> 00:31:33.890
videos, whether they're really truthful, does, did he actually

624
00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:37.390
cure blindness for 1000 children? Sometimes when you get

625
00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.229
into the nitty gritty, it's a little bit murky,

626
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.709
nobody's really holding him accountable because it's a private

627
00:31:41.709 --> 00:31:44.790
business. Same with the Gates Foundation, you know, they've

628
00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:48.150
done things like made vaccines widely available, uh, like

629
00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:51.199
for things like polio, great. That's great, right, but

630
00:31:51.199 --> 00:31:54.520
then they do shy away from things which are

631
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.449
less measurable. So the thing about, uh, curing polio

632
00:31:57.449 --> 00:31:59.760
with vaccines is that you can be like, OK,

633
00:31:59.839 --> 00:32:02.750
we've done, you know, a million people this year,

634
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.280
and that's like, that looks good, that's like, you

635
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.640
know, KPI that's like a metric, right? But I,

636
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.079
they had this kind of clash with some researchers

637
00:32:10.079 --> 00:32:11.959
and with the Indian government. The Indian government was

638
00:32:11.959 --> 00:32:14.829
saying we need better water systems, better sewage systems,

639
00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:18.099
because diarrhea's a bigger problem than polio. And the

640
00:32:18.099 --> 00:32:20.270
Gates Foundation were like, oh, that seems a bit,

641
00:32:20.459 --> 00:32:22.660
you know, a bit too amorphous, I don't think,

642
00:32:22.709 --> 00:32:25.250
you know, it's not as good a a deliverable

643
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:27.420
for, for our sort of image. And so it

644
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.739
ended up, they ended up neglecting that, right? So

645
00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:33.180
these decisions that should be fundamentally democratic, yes, we

646
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.494
should be putting resources. Into these things, as Bill

647
00:32:35.494 --> 00:32:38.165
Gates and Mr. Beast both do to some extent,

648
00:32:38.444 --> 00:32:40.724
maybe we should be putting more resources in, but

649
00:32:40.724 --> 00:32:43.805
they should be more democratic decisions, and that that's

650
00:32:43.805 --> 00:32:46.354
really the problem, but again, I want to underscore,

651
00:32:46.564 --> 00:32:48.685
I find this argument very hard to make to

652
00:32:48.685 --> 00:32:52.640
ordinary people because they are just like. 1000 blind

653
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.319
children, what are you, you know, what's your problem?

654
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.800
That sounds good, so yeah, I'd like, I'd like

655
00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.680
to think I'd like to. Discuss with people and

656
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.739
think about how best to make that argument in

657
00:33:02.739 --> 00:33:03.800
a concise form.

658
00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.150
Yeah, isn't it also the case that when we're

659
00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:11.430
talking about philanthropy, one thing that it usually does

660
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:14.989
not address is systemic change because, for example, of

661
00:33:14.989 --> 00:33:18.239
course, we could give out money for uh uh

662
00:33:18.239 --> 00:33:21.910
nets in Africa to fight back against malaria transmission

663
00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.150
and stuff like that. But at the end of

664
00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:27.069
the day, we're not doing something that will ever

665
00:33:27.069 --> 00:33:31.265
see. Systemic impact on the politics or the economy

666
00:33:31.265 --> 00:33:34.864
of, I don't know, Angola, Mozambique and other places

667
00:33:34.864 --> 00:33:37.584
like that. So, and perhaps in the long term,

668
00:33:37.864 --> 00:33:41.535
it doesn't it doesn't have that big of an

669
00:33:41.535 --> 00:33:44.984
impact as it could have if we had more

670
00:33:44.984 --> 00:33:50.295
of a systemic approach to uh change, I guess.

671
00:33:50.625 --> 00:33:55.359
Absolutely and you know they're not gonna. Bill Gates

672
00:33:55.359 --> 00:33:58.790
might want to uh deliver malaria nets, right, in,

673
00:33:58.839 --> 00:34:02.119
in Angola. um WHAT he's not gonna say is

674
00:34:02.119 --> 00:34:05.640
I'm going to relax my intellectual property claims in

675
00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.679
Angola, right, which would not only potentially open up

676
00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:13.389
the space for, for um. Health gains, but also

677
00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:16.429
more generally might release the grip that like Microsoft

678
00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.989
has on like local companies, right, and and the

679
00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:21.458
ability for Angola to grow and and and you

680
00:34:21.458 --> 00:34:23.070
know, create its own solutions and things like that,

681
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:25.389
so absolutely, yeah, it does come at the expense

682
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:26.418
of systemic change.

683
00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:29.168
So I want to ask you now a little

684
00:34:29.168 --> 00:34:32.850
bit about social mobility. Of course, I guess that

685
00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.830
uh for us to be more precise, we would

686
00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.370
have to go on a country by country basis,

687
00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:41.770
but you, you are from the UK. Talk, tell

688
00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:45.330
us about the UK in particular, perhaps the US

689
00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:48.929
as well. What do we know about social mobility

690
00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:51.820
nowadays? Is it good? Is it bad?

691
00:34:54.879 --> 00:34:58.479
The thing about social mobility in the UK is

692
00:34:58.479 --> 00:35:03.790
that the there there is some churn, I think,

693
00:35:03.879 --> 00:35:05.760
in the middle class. I think if you're born

694
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.649
lower middle class, you can probably end up upper

695
00:35:07.649 --> 00:35:11.719
middle class and vice versa. But I think if

696
00:35:11.719 --> 00:35:15.199
you're born poor and or very poor, your chances

697
00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:18.310
of getting out are are pretty low. They're pretty

698
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:22.949
low, and similarly, if you're born rich. Your chances

699
00:35:22.949 --> 00:35:27.189
of falling, falling from grace are almost zero, right?

700
00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:29.939
So we do have a very entrenched class system

701
00:35:30.189 --> 00:35:34.489
in the UK and although there's some income mobility,

702
00:35:34.929 --> 00:35:38.189
I, it never really truly changes and there's this

703
00:35:38.189 --> 00:35:41.550
PhD thesis by um. Um, I forget his name,

704
00:35:41.629 --> 00:35:43.629
I'm sorry, but there was, uh, he was looking

705
00:35:43.629 --> 00:35:46.750
at long run social mobility in the UK. So

706
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:50.110
what he means by long run is not, um,

707
00:35:50.189 --> 00:35:53.229
generation to generation. COS what's really interesting is that

708
00:35:53.229 --> 00:35:54.909
sometimes you get a bit of movement from generation

709
00:35:54.909 --> 00:35:56.350
to generation, you know, I might do better than

710
00:35:56.350 --> 00:36:00.270
my dad or the, but from, from across a

711
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.750
long, a lot of generations, people almost always snap

712
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.830
back to their long term position. Right, so yeah,

713
00:36:06.909 --> 00:36:09.094
I. I might like, uh, if I'm like relatively

714
00:36:09.094 --> 00:36:12.455
rich, maybe I'm, you know, uh, a wealthy heir,

715
00:36:12.574 --> 00:36:15.125
a careless heir, and I spend all my money.

716
00:36:15.415 --> 00:36:17.014
But then the chances are my kids are gonna

717
00:36:17.014 --> 00:36:19.375
be back up, back up in that top class,

718
00:36:19.455 --> 00:36:22.054
right? And this is really interesting cos I just

719
00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:25.330
think that. The class system, yeah, it's, it's not,

720
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:26.850
I mean we still have the royal family, right,

721
00:36:26.919 --> 00:36:28.810
I think of it, they're like the apex of

722
00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:30.840
it, right, we still have the royal family here.

723
00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:33.409
I don't think the class system in the UK

724
00:36:33.729 --> 00:36:37.409
is in danger of disappearing anytime soon. I think

725
00:36:37.409 --> 00:36:40.489
that, you know, social mobility over the long term,

726
00:36:40.649 --> 00:36:43.889
especially and with wealth is pre is pretty limited.

727
00:36:45.199 --> 00:36:48.979
But what is behind the lack uh or low

728
00:36:48.979 --> 00:36:52.540
social mobility? What causes it? What are the main

729
00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.979
barriers to social mobility?

730
00:36:56.229 --> 00:37:00.429
I think there are a lot of factors that

731
00:37:00.429 --> 00:37:04.270
um feed into this. So you've got like starting

732
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.229
wealth, right, like your starting wealth stat. THAT'S like,

733
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:09.550
that's pretty big. If you've got, if you inherit

734
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:12.429
like a house outright, and that's not even to

735
00:37:12.429 --> 00:37:14.149
say that you're super rich, like I just mean

736
00:37:14.149 --> 00:37:18.409
a house, a normal house, right, then. Then you're

737
00:37:18.409 --> 00:37:21.639
just, your chances of doing well are so much

738
00:37:21.639 --> 00:37:24.719
higher, right, you've got that base, you've reduced your

739
00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:28.479
outgoings, right, you've just got like safety to experiment

740
00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:31.010
and try different things, start a business, start a

741
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:33.560
risky job, get education, all of those types of

742
00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.489
things, right? If you've got that support network or

743
00:37:36.489 --> 00:37:39.080
just a strong family that like can can um

744
00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.080
give you money if you need it or allow

745
00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.959
you to stay with them. THOSE things can make

746
00:37:43.959 --> 00:37:46.409
a a really, really big difference. And again, you

747
00:37:46.409 --> 00:37:48.600
take it to extremes. The amount of wealth that

748
00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.489
that you know, people who go to boarding schools

749
00:37:50.489 --> 00:37:51.969
and and all of that in the UK have,

750
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.810
it's just unfathomable, the amount of wealth they have,

751
00:37:54.889 --> 00:37:57.090
right? And there's just no chance that they can

752
00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:00.530
fail, they fail upwards. Um, NOW there's also the

753
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:03.449
question of like social connections, right, I think this

754
00:38:03.449 --> 00:38:06.320
is really, really big in the UK. Um, THE

755
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.989
journalist Simon Cooper wrote this book called Choms, um,

756
00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.959
which is like the sort of the group of

757
00:38:11.959 --> 00:38:15.429
friends who run Bri run Britain, and he said,

758
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.360
you know, he said to me that it's astonishing

759
00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.520
who these people can get on the phone. They

760
00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.919
can have politicians on the phone, they can have

761
00:38:21.919 --> 00:38:24.560
CEOs on the phone, right, they can have policymakers

762
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.840
on the phone, they can have diplomats from different

763
00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.040
countries on the phone, right? And the opportunities that

764
00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.239
you have when you can do that, on top

765
00:38:32.239 --> 00:38:35.159
of the fact that you're already really wealthy. You'll

766
00:38:35.159 --> 00:38:37.600
just always have job offers, and not just job

767
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.719
offers, but lucrative job offers, right? VERSUS if you

768
00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:43.560
look at the other end, what are sometimes called

769
00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.439
the precariat, people with basically no assets, but no

770
00:38:46.439 --> 00:38:48.600
social connections, they can't, you know, people who are

771
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.959
working maybe as cleaners, they don't have anyone they

772
00:38:50.959 --> 00:38:52.479
can phone and be like, you know, can you,

773
00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.050
can you give me a job, let alone can

774
00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:55.560
you give me a job that pays a million

775
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.719
pounds a year. So I think you've got, yeah,

776
00:38:57.879 --> 00:39:00.800
things like the starting wealth and you've got social

777
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.639
connections, you've also got discrimination. Which is a really

778
00:39:03.639 --> 00:39:05.719
big one. Now discrimination operates on a number of

779
00:39:05.719 --> 00:39:10.280
different dimensions, including class, but essentially, if you're, you

780
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.649
know, the posher you are, the whiter you are,

781
00:39:12.719 --> 00:39:15.320
the more male you are, the more able-bodied you

782
00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.560
are and the straighter you are, I think the

783
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.320
more likely you are to get that call back

784
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.280
from a, from a job interview that you attend,

785
00:39:21.429 --> 00:39:23.600
the more likely you are to get to be

786
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.229
selected as a tenant for housing. There's so much

787
00:39:26.229 --> 00:39:28.719
evidence for this that discrimination takes place on all

788
00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:32.219
these fronts, so. It is, it's a very complex

789
00:39:32.219 --> 00:39:35.699
picture, but the bottom line is that. People are

790
00:39:35.699 --> 00:39:38.699
playing on different difficulty settings, right? Like if you're

791
00:39:38.699 --> 00:39:41.290
born, if you go to Eton, you're playing on,

792
00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.580
on very easy mode, right, and if you're born,

793
00:39:43.739 --> 00:39:46.679
you know, into a, a working class family with,

794
00:39:46.699 --> 00:39:50.739
with short term, um, poorly paid jobs, maybe working

795
00:39:50.739 --> 00:39:53.010
two jobs, then you're playing on a very difficult

796
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.419
difficulty setting and and everything is just harder.

797
00:39:56.939 --> 00:39:59.229
But uh but let's say that we have a

798
00:39:59.229 --> 00:40:02.909
country with high social mobility, which is good, but

799
00:40:02.909 --> 00:40:07.510
also high inequality. Isn't that a problem? Isn't that

800
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.179
combination a problem?

801
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.870
Have you got high social mobility but still high

802
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:15.320
inequality? I think, I think so, yeah, I think

803
00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.919
there are, um, I mean. I will say that

804
00:40:19.919 --> 00:40:22.600
usually higher inequality means lower social mobility cos it

805
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.850
just, there's more barriers created by the rich, but

806
00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:28.850
I, I'll take your question as given. um, THERE

807
00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:32.040
are problems created by inequality, right? And there's this

808
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:36.580
research uh done on like socioeconomic status and health

809
00:40:36.879 --> 00:40:40.209
and on crime. Uh, THIS is pretty well known

810
00:40:40.209 --> 00:40:43.129
by researchers in the kind of epidemiology, public health

811
00:40:43.129 --> 00:40:46.850
space, and by crime researchers, inequality leads to these

812
00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:49.090
worst social outcomes. And there's a bunch of famous

813
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.729
studies done. Um, ONE of my favorite ones was

814
00:40:51.729 --> 00:40:54.850
they studied nuns. So if you imagine becoming a

815
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:58.850
nun, you go, you all, um. Go and live

816
00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:01.850
at this nunnery, you live the most homogenous lifestyle

817
00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:03.780
you can imagine, right? You're literally all in the

818
00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.969
same place doing the same thing, eating the same

819
00:41:06.969 --> 00:41:09.729
thing, acting the same way among the same people,

820
00:41:09.929 --> 00:41:14.969
right? But the nuns socioeconomic status going in was

821
00:41:14.969 --> 00:41:18.290
a predictor of their mortality, of their eventual life

822
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:22.169
expectancy. So that it just, that kind of gradient.

823
00:41:22.639 --> 00:41:25.080
Makes a big impact on everybody and there's some

824
00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.239
evidence as well, so Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson

825
00:41:27.239 --> 00:41:29.489
have talked about this in the inner level. There's

826
00:41:29.489 --> 00:41:32.149
some evidence that it hurts everybody, right? So like,

827
00:41:32.199 --> 00:41:35.399
even if you're rich, um, but you're in a

828
00:41:35.399 --> 00:41:38.760
less equal country, your life expectancy is lower than

829
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.699
if you're rich in a more equal country. Right,

830
00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:45.110
so there's, there's, there's just, uh, inequality gets under

831
00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.709
everybody's skin, it leads to a divided society, it

832
00:41:47.709 --> 00:41:50.580
leads to more status anxiety. That's like the crucial

833
00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.330
measure that they look at in the inner level,

834
00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.780
uh, just anxiety about where I stand in the

835
00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.100
pecking order, that kind of thing. So I think

836
00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.139
there are lots of reasons for us to want

837
00:41:59.139 --> 00:42:01.540
more equality in general, even if we have high

838
00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:05.100
social mobility, even if other outcomes are going relatively

839
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.570
well. It's something that's worth pursuing in itself.

840
00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:11.899
Since we're talking about inequality now, what are the

841
00:42:11.899 --> 00:42:16.290
social consequences of inequality because we hear from certain

842
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:19.419
people like, for example, Steven Pinker, he argues in

843
00:42:19.419 --> 00:42:23.020
the in the Enlightenment now that he, he has

844
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:26.300
a sort of a chapter on inequality and he

845
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:31.459
argues that if people have a positive perception of

846
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.610
Quality that is, if they think that people who

847
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:38.580
earn more or have more money deserve it because

848
00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.899
they might work more or they might do more

849
00:42:41.899 --> 00:42:45.939
things than other people, then inequality is not a

850
00:42:45.939 --> 00:42:49.179
problem. But even if people have a positive perception

851
00:42:49.179 --> 00:42:53.060
of inequality, uh, can't it still have, uh, bad

852
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.459
social consequences?

853
00:42:55.459 --> 00:42:57.580
There's definitely a truth in what Pinker is saying,

854
00:42:57.679 --> 00:43:01.659
right? I mean, we all understand that the 2008

855
00:43:01.659 --> 00:43:05.459
financial crisis, people were really angry at bankers, right?

856
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.689
And why? Was it just because they were earning

857
00:43:07.689 --> 00:43:10.290
more? No, because people were less angry at them

858
00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:13.020
before the crisis, right, where when the financial sector

859
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.820
hadn't imploded, they were more angry with them. After

860
00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.939
they imploded the financial sector and the economy, and

861
00:43:18.939 --> 00:43:21.419
then continued to get paid loads, after being bailed

862
00:43:21.419 --> 00:43:23.620
out directly by the government and the central banks,

863
00:43:23.659 --> 00:43:25.159
and it's like people are like, well you're just,

864
00:43:25.219 --> 00:43:27.129
you know, this is socialism for the rich. It's

865
00:43:27.129 --> 00:43:30.250
ridiculous, it's unjust, it's unfair. So I do understand

866
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:32.419
that, but I don't know why, I mean I

867
00:43:32.419 --> 00:43:34.459
do know why Steven Pinker argues this because he

868
00:43:34.459 --> 00:43:38.189
has to spin everything as improving, and he knows

869
00:43:38.189 --> 00:43:40.419
that inequality has been getting worse, so he has

870
00:43:40.419 --> 00:43:42.260
to say it's not a problem. Now this contradicts

871
00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.850
some of his earlier work, it must be said,

872
00:43:43.939 --> 00:43:47.949
but anyway. There's a lot of evidence, and Pinker's

873
00:43:47.949 --> 00:43:50.139
argument there is based on lab experiments, by the

874
00:43:50.139 --> 00:43:51.820
way, there's a lot of evidence from like actual

875
00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.139
data. If you look at subjective well-being and happiness

876
00:43:54.139 --> 00:43:59.540
data, inequality just impacts people's happiness. Regard everywhere, across

877
00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.699
the world, um, the level of inequality in a

878
00:44:02.699 --> 00:44:05.260
country, the level of inequality in a local area.

879
00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:08.239
There's a lot of evidence that they impact subjective

880
00:44:08.239 --> 00:44:13.189
happiness. And so he says specifically, you know, inequality

881
00:44:13.189 --> 00:44:16.030
is not a fundamental component of human well-being. Well,

882
00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.419
this is data on well-being and it contradicts him,

883
00:44:18.469 --> 00:44:20.000
so I just, I don't see how he can

884
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.949
sustain that argument. On top of everything else I

885
00:44:21.949 --> 00:44:24.510
just said about health and crime and the socioeconomic

886
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.949
gradient, I think there are so many negative effects

887
00:44:26.949 --> 00:44:28.219
of inequality on people.

888
00:44:29.649 --> 00:44:33.209
Uh, DO you think that higher taxes, particularly on

889
00:44:33.209 --> 00:44:36.929
the rich, could contribute to fixing inequality?

890
00:44:37.689 --> 00:44:40.439
Yeah, definitely, I, I'm, I'm in favor of uh

891
00:44:40.439 --> 00:44:44.080
taxing income, I'm in favor of taxing capital gains

892
00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.360
as well, particularly I think that the fact that

893
00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.800
capital gains tax is much lower than income tax

894
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.709
is something I don't support. I think if you,

895
00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.790
you know, you gain from an er an increase

896
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.540
in the value of an asset, you, you and,

897
00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.919
and you realize that you should, you should be

898
00:44:56.919 --> 00:44:58.649
paying tax on it as if it's as if

899
00:44:58.649 --> 00:45:01.120
it's income. And I'm in favor of some kind

900
00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.989
of wealth tax. I'm, I'm undecided on, on what

901
00:45:04.989 --> 00:45:06.679
exactly that would look like. I know wealth can

902
00:45:06.679 --> 00:45:08.800
be quite hard to estimate and to tax, but

903
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.439
one suggestion I've seen is that because like I

904
00:45:11.439 --> 00:45:13.320
said earlier, a lot of the rich's wealth these

905
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:18.030
days is in stocks. Um, AND that's. It's hard

906
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:19.750
to tax because it's not money, right, it's not

907
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:22.629
money, but what I've seen is, you know, take

908
00:45:22.629 --> 00:45:25.629
the stocks. You take the stocks and you create

909
00:45:25.629 --> 00:45:28.110
something like a social wealth fund, like Norway, like

910
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:31.429
Alaska, that pays out to the population every, every

911
00:45:31.429 --> 00:45:33.780
month, every year or whatever, some kind of dividend,

912
00:45:33.989 --> 00:45:37.129
and so you just appropriate the stocks for the

913
00:45:37.129 --> 00:45:39.580
general public. Um, SO yeah, there are, there are,

914
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.989
I, there are countless ways I'd like to tax

915
00:45:41.989 --> 00:45:44.550
the rich more and I think it, it has

916
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.929
two benefits, right? So firstly, it reduces the power

917
00:45:46.929 --> 00:45:49.719
and control that we've been talking about. But secondly,

918
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.000
the money that you get can be used to

919
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.639
help people, right, so you've got a kind of

920
00:45:53.639 --> 00:45:54.399
double whammy there.

921
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.300
Uh, AND what do you think about universal basic

922
00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.939
income? I mean, from the experiments that have been

923
00:46:02.939 --> 00:46:06.560
done in several different places across the world, uh,

924
00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.899
looking at their results, what do you make of

925
00:46:09.899 --> 00:46:12.060
it? Do you think it has a positive or

926
00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.300
it could have a positive impact on people's lives?

927
00:46:16.409 --> 00:46:19.120
I was initially a skeptic of universal basic income,

928
00:46:19.169 --> 00:46:22.209
and that that was mostly because I was worried

929
00:46:22.209 --> 00:46:24.770
that it would be used to replace all public

930
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.770
services, and I think there are people who that's

931
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:29.370
more, if you go on the more right wing

932
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.530
advocacy, going back to maybe Milton Friedman, uh but

933
00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:36.080
also maybe people like Andrew Yang. Um, AND who,

934
00:46:36.169 --> 00:46:37.969
who I think was pitching it to the right

935
00:46:37.969 --> 00:46:41.360
as like a replacement for, for the state basically

936
00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.159
for public services. Uh, I, I don't like that

937
00:46:44.159 --> 00:46:46.310
argument. I don't think it's a replacement for public

938
00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:48.969
education, public health. Those sectors have their own reasons

939
00:46:48.969 --> 00:46:51.439
that you would want to provide them publicly. However,

940
00:46:51.689 --> 00:46:55.030
I think it's a supplement. And I think that

941
00:46:55.419 --> 00:47:00.120
the thing is, right. Before the emergence of capitalism

942
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.090
that we spoke about, before the emergence of the

943
00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:05.000
economy as a separate sphere, people were generally more

944
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.080
connected to the land and to their means of

945
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.399
subsistence. People used to work, but they used to

946
00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:13.419
provide for themselves. So they'd have this like baseline

947
00:47:13.419 --> 00:47:15.879
standard of living, they wouldn't necessarily have to work

948
00:47:15.879 --> 00:47:18.350
for wages in order to earn money to survive.

949
00:47:18.679 --> 00:47:22.120
That was how capitalism established itself in the English

950
00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.340
countryside. And so we've been disconnected from our means

951
00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:28.139
of subsistence, and this is when you see people

952
00:47:28.139 --> 00:47:30.060
unable to survive if they, if they can't, if

953
00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.179
they can't work in a job. And there are

954
00:47:32.179 --> 00:47:35.010
lots of problems with that. Jobs aren't always available

955
00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:38.620
to people, um. You know, they can be extremely

956
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:43.879
soul destroying and alienating, right? And it's just a

957
00:47:43.879 --> 00:47:47.479
fundamental human urge, I think, to, to be, to

958
00:47:47.479 --> 00:47:50.919
have like subsistence and to have that baseline insurance.

959
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.500
I think it leaves us all in a state

960
00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:56.600
of like permanent anxiety and uncertainty. So UBI, I

961
00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.669
think, now that we have. Capitalism, now that we

962
00:47:58.669 --> 00:48:01.110
have a market economy, now that everything's exchangeable for

963
00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:04.270
money, UBI is, is, is giving, giving that back

964
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:06.669
to us, right? It's giving that baseline. No, you

965
00:48:06.669 --> 00:48:09.719
will never fall below this standard of living. And

966
00:48:09.719 --> 00:48:11.110
it doesn't have to be a high standard of

967
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:13.030
living, I would say like, for me, I would

968
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:15.300
start with like 10 a month in the UK.

969
00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:17.699
That's not loads. 120 a year is not like

970
00:48:17.699 --> 00:48:20.739
that expensive, it's. Completely affordable and it's not like

971
00:48:20.739 --> 00:48:23.379
some luxurious standard of living, but it is just

972
00:48:23.379 --> 00:48:27.649
saying, nobody, nobody is allowed to fall below this,

973
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:31.229
right, and that level of security, I think, is

974
00:48:31.229 --> 00:48:34.219
absolutely vital as a human need. Now you mentioned

975
00:48:34.219 --> 00:48:36.500
the trials. What has really surprised me about these

976
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.219
trials, cos we've we've experimented with UBI across so

977
00:48:40.219 --> 00:48:44.919
many countries, more in in poorer countries. Uh, I'm,

978
00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:47.649
I believe in, in humanity, and I don't believe

979
00:48:47.649 --> 00:48:50.300
that everybody's just gonna slack if they get UBI.

980
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:52.610
I think people have an urge to contribute to

981
00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:56.530
society, to better themselves, to invent and create and,

982
00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.419
and, and so on. But I have been surprised

983
00:48:59.419 --> 00:49:02.229
by how successful these trials have been. It's incredible

984
00:49:02.229 --> 00:49:07.580
people really don't take time off work, working unless

985
00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.580
they're maybe um raising children, mostly mothers, which is,

986
00:49:10.659 --> 00:49:13.189
you know, that is work obviously in itself. There's

987
00:49:13.189 --> 00:49:15.939
there's effects on the local economy, there's no like

988
00:49:15.939 --> 00:49:19.620
inflation, they seem to boost the local economy. People

989
00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:22.139
don't spend all their money on, you know, sin

990
00:49:22.139 --> 00:49:25.000
goods like like cigarettes and so on, which by

991
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.500
the way, they have a right to, but I've

992
00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:30.290
just been surprised like, it really, really works. Uh,

993
00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:33.659
IT doesn't have almost any of the negative effects

994
00:49:33.659 --> 00:49:35.699
that people were worried about. It has a lot

995
00:49:35.699 --> 00:49:39.179
of positive effects, and I think. As well as

996
00:49:39.179 --> 00:49:41.179
being a kind of moral obligation, as I just

997
00:49:41.179 --> 00:49:43.409
outlined, I think it's an economic obligation as well,

998
00:49:43.459 --> 00:49:47.139
I think it's good for the economy. So, there's

999
00:49:47.139 --> 00:49:49.580
no excuse now, especially in poorer countries as well,

1000
00:49:49.659 --> 00:49:52.260
like we could solve poverty. Like that, we really

1001
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.979
could, right? Like I appreciate there are logistical problems,

1002
00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.209
but like we, we could solve it just by

1003
00:49:57.209 --> 00:50:00.459
rolling out these programs across the world. Nobody in

1004
00:50:00.459 --> 00:50:02.179
the world, we have so much wealth in the

1005
00:50:02.179 --> 00:50:05.179
world, nobody is allowed to drop below a certain

1006
00:50:05.179 --> 00:50:08.419
standard of living. That is one of the policies

1007
00:50:08.419 --> 00:50:11.129
I would like to see tomorrow. I, I, again,

1008
00:50:11.179 --> 00:50:12.899
there is no excuse for us not doing it.

1009
00:50:13.969 --> 00:50:17.129
Uh, BUT in terms of its affordability, because this

1010
00:50:17.129 --> 00:50:21.570
is something that many or at least some people

1011
00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:25.120
would worry about. I mean, uh, uh, would it

1012
00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:29.929
entail any changes to our, for example, taxation system

1013
00:50:29.929 --> 00:50:32.530
or something like that? Because, uh, I mean, when

1014
00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:37.030
it comes to, you mentioned public services, let's say,

1015
00:50:37.169 --> 00:50:41.364
let's Talk for example about disability benefits and employment

1016
00:50:41.364 --> 00:50:45.705
benefits. I mean, would those still be there and

1017
00:50:45.705 --> 00:50:49.314
would they add to universal basic income or would

1018
00:50:49.314 --> 00:50:54.145
universal basic income substitute those sorts of public benefits?

1019
00:50:54.314 --> 00:50:56.465
So yeah, that's a really good question. I'm glad

1020
00:50:56.465 --> 00:50:59.155
you asked it because it could UBI is a

1021
00:50:59.155 --> 00:51:01.820
is a cash payment rights a money payment. It

1022
00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:04.139
could feasibly, I don't think it should replace public

1023
00:51:04.139 --> 00:51:07.179
services, it could feasibly replace some of the cash

1024
00:51:07.179 --> 00:51:09.520
payments out there, right? So I don't think you'd

1025
00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.060
need unemployment benefits if you have UBI, for instance,

1026
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:14.780
because it is basically that just for everyone all

1027
00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.620
the time. Disability benefits maybe, you know, people with

1028
00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:20.405
disabilities have different needs, um. But I think we

1029
00:51:20.405 --> 00:51:23.205
think even like, you know, pensions as a baseline

1030
00:51:23.205 --> 00:51:26.895
pension scheme, public pension scheme, right, things like um

1031
00:51:26.895 --> 00:51:29.725
grants for students, I think like living money for

1032
00:51:29.725 --> 00:51:31.725
students, I think it could replace that. So there

1033
00:51:31.725 --> 00:51:33.885
are, you are saving on, on some metrics, you're

1034
00:51:33.885 --> 00:51:37.004
replacing them with UBI, which is also less administratively

1035
00:51:37.004 --> 00:51:40.469
costly. But you, you'd need to raise taxes. Right,

1036
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:44.229
you'd need, you'd need further progressive taxation. um, AND

1037
00:51:44.229 --> 00:51:45.949
I, I haven't done the maths on this in

1038
00:51:45.949 --> 00:51:49.070
a while, but like Scott Santenss is, um, have

1039
00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:51.320
you, have you ever interviewed Scott Santans on your,

1040
00:51:51.439 --> 00:51:54.479
on your, you heard of him? OK, he's he

1041
00:51:54.489 --> 00:51:57.030
he's he's really cool, he's like a UBI. He's

1042
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:58.669
on a mission, he's on a mission to get

1043
00:51:58.669 --> 00:52:01.270
UBI established. He's really good, but he, he's done

1044
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:03.540
all the calculations and you know, it really is.

1045
00:52:03.919 --> 00:52:07.459
It really is completely affordable with some modest tax

1046
00:52:07.459 --> 00:52:11.070
increases and replacing a few programs, um, yeah, it

1047
00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.050
it's, I think it's completely feasible.

1048
00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.320
OK, so I asked you earlier about Steven Pinker's

1049
00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.399
views on inequality, and we know that he also

1050
00:52:21.399 --> 00:52:27.040
has these more broader view of improvement over the

1051
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.639
course of the past few centuries. He also talks

1052
00:52:29.639 --> 00:52:32.030
about that in the Better Angels of Our Nature

1053
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:34.820
and other books. Uh, WHAT do you make of

1054
00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:40.169
the many ways life has improved for most people,

1055
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.610
I guess that would be fair to say, over

1056
00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:44.250
the past two centuries.

1057
00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:49.340
These are the new optimists, and I think it's

1058
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.379
really interesting for me because I made a video

1059
00:52:51.379 --> 00:52:53.939
on my channel critiquing Steven Pinker on inequality and

1060
00:52:53.939 --> 00:52:56.739
poverty, and I've covered some of that already. So

1061
00:52:56.739 --> 00:52:58.979
the new Optimist, there's also Hans Rosling, uh, his

1062
00:52:58.979 --> 00:53:01.060
book Factfulness. There are other ones, I think Charles

1063
00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:04.260
Kenny Get Better, Matt Ridley, The Rational Optimist. There

1064
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:05.969
are quite a few of these books out there.

1065
00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:08.500
Um, I've not read all of them. Uh, BUT

1066
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.810
I really think that there, there are a number

1067
00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:15.679
of issues with this narrative now. The first thing

1068
00:53:15.679 --> 00:53:19.189
to say is that there is this massive growth

1069
00:53:19.189 --> 00:53:21.439
in our material standard of living over the past

1070
00:53:21.439 --> 00:53:24.000
two centuries, the past few centuries, right? I, I

1071
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.949
mean, I started by talking about that. Furthermore, there

1072
00:53:27.949 --> 00:53:33.120
are recent gains um in economic gains, you've got

1073
00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.409
the rise of China, for instance, the most. The

1074
00:53:35.409 --> 00:53:37.669
most salient example is the rise of China. Nobody

1075
00:53:37.669 --> 00:53:40.590
can deny that the Chinese standard of living has

1076
00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:44.469
gone up. Other countries, mostly East Asian, have achieved

1077
00:53:44.469 --> 00:53:46.830
similar things. Um, AND there are also, you know,

1078
00:53:46.909 --> 00:53:49.110
there are plenty of growing countries, uh, that, that

1079
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:51.590
are doing doing really well now like Rwanda's doing

1080
00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:54.669
relatively well, for example, and like Nigeria's grown a

1081
00:53:54.669 --> 00:53:57.310
lot. So there are, there are some economic success

1082
00:53:57.310 --> 00:54:01.649
stories. In addition, there are success stories along like

1083
00:54:01.649 --> 00:54:04.959
the matrix of health and education, things like literacy,

1084
00:54:05.129 --> 00:54:08.010
things like vaccines, things like nutrition, I think things

1085
00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:13.290
like malnutrition have been combated hugely, right? Now, I

1086
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:17.199
don't really wish to deny any of this, uh,

1087
00:54:17.209 --> 00:54:22.040
but my issue is. The narrative attached to it,

1088
00:54:22.199 --> 00:54:25.679
right? Um, AND I think Steven Pinker in particular,

1089
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:28.199
Rosling's a bit more nuanced on this, but Steven

1090
00:54:28.199 --> 00:54:31.120
Pinker in particular, his idea seems to be, things

1091
00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:34.050
are getting better, why is everyone complaining? It must

1092
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:36.959
just be because they don't understand these graphs. Let

1093
00:54:36.959 --> 00:54:39.439
me show you 70 graphs. Now, do you feel

1094
00:54:39.439 --> 00:54:42.159
better? Uh, AND the answer is no, and he

1095
00:54:42.159 --> 00:54:44.600
has to do things like blame cognitive bias and

1096
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.159
media bias, which is very weak, is, is very

1097
00:54:47.159 --> 00:54:48.479
weak, that stuff, we can talk about it if

1098
00:54:48.479 --> 00:54:52.669
you like, but um. I think the fundamental question

1099
00:54:52.669 --> 00:54:55.350
for me that I'm asking in in the book

1100
00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:58.110
why we're getting poorer, why is it that despite

1101
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:00.989
many of these gains, despite the massive growth of

1102
00:55:00.989 --> 00:55:03.149
GDP and some of the great technologies we enjoy,

1103
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:04.790
look at what we're doing this interview on, you

1104
00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:07.149
know, despite some of these gains in health and

1105
00:55:07.149 --> 00:55:09.229
stuff. Why is it that so many people are

1106
00:55:09.229 --> 00:55:11.350
struggling? Why do so many people feel the pinch?

1107
00:55:11.409 --> 00:55:13.790
Why is there so much political backlash? And I

1108
00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:19.370
think the answer is. For me Yes, we have

1109
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:22.889
a lot of material wealth, but a lot of

1110
00:55:22.889 --> 00:55:26.010
our much more fundamental needs, I think have been

1111
00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:29.189
sidelined. And a big example here would be housing.

1112
00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:34.000
Like, yeah, my grandparents, right, my grandparents couldn't order,

1113
00:55:34.129 --> 00:55:37.290
you know, Brazilian, Korean fusion to their door in

1114
00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:39.729
half an hour. OK, they couldn't do that, they

1115
00:55:39.729 --> 00:55:44.090
couldn't have a a a video call online. Right,

1116
00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:47.209
OK. They didn't have access to like all of

1117
00:55:47.209 --> 00:55:50.459
the world's information at their fingertips. But what they

1118
00:55:50.459 --> 00:55:53.340
could do was afford a house. Um, AND what

1119
00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:57.780
they did have was far better local services, far

1120
00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.699
more access to er sort of social and physical

1121
00:56:00.699 --> 00:56:03.780
infrastructure that's declined across England over the past decade

1122
00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:08.479
or so. And They, they didn't have to pay

1123
00:56:08.479 --> 00:56:12.800
for university, right, so I think there are all

1124
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.600
of these things which are very fundamental to people,

1125
00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:19.649
seem to have become less available or more costly

1126
00:56:19.649 --> 00:56:22.879
or worse run. And we, that's because we haven't

1127
00:56:22.879 --> 00:56:24.959
focused on them. We've allowed the economy to grow

1128
00:56:24.959 --> 00:56:27.800
as a whole without focusing on these fundamental human

1129
00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.159
needs. And this goes back to what I was

1130
00:56:29.159 --> 00:56:31.520
saying about essential workers because those are the people

1131
00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:34.320
who provide these things, right, and yet we don't.

1132
00:56:35.189 --> 00:56:37.689
Honor them in in in any sort of way.

1133
00:56:37.889 --> 00:56:39.889
We're just happy to say, you know, let the

1134
00:56:39.889 --> 00:56:43.129
economy run, let the private sector grow, whoever gets

1135
00:56:43.129 --> 00:56:46.000
paid in the private sector, you know, deserves it,

1136
00:56:46.159 --> 00:56:48.770
and we're not going to focus on how we

1137
00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:53.530
provide for uh human and social needs. That's what's

1138
00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:55.169
fallen by the wayside, and I feel like that's

1139
00:56:55.169 --> 00:56:57.090
why a lot of people are so dissatisfied because

1140
00:56:57.090 --> 00:56:59.189
they don't feel like they're getting richer. You know,

1141
00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:01.429
we've had housing costs, we've had the cost of

1142
00:57:01.429 --> 00:57:04.350
living crisis, we've had the supply chain crisis, we

1143
00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:06.149
have all these things that are hitting people in

1144
00:57:06.149 --> 00:57:08.780
their pockets. I mean the the Resolution Foundation in

1145
00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:14.030
um earlier this year. They um released a report

1146
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:17.949
showing that in the UK the bottom 40% of

1147
00:57:17.949 --> 00:57:20.949
earners have lost out since the pandemic. They're earning

1148
00:57:20.949 --> 00:57:23.379
less than they did before the pandemic, and that,

1149
00:57:23.449 --> 00:57:27.000
that's gonna go down by 2029, they're gonna be

1150
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.040
earning even less than that. Right, so it's like,

1151
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:33.360
yeah, overall GDP is going up and some metrics

1152
00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.719
are improving, but so many people are struggling and

1153
00:57:36.719 --> 00:57:39.320
Pinker and Rosin, neither of them look at things

1154
00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.520
in enough depth to really capture that in my

1155
00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:41.870
opinion.

1156
00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:47.110
Right. And let me ask you specifically about poverty.

1157
00:57:47.149 --> 00:57:50.510
I mean, usually people, when they talk about poverty

1158
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:54.669
and how capitalism supposedly has been lifting people across

1159
00:57:54.669 --> 00:57:57.750
the globe out of poverty. Usually they are referring

1160
00:57:57.750 --> 00:58:02.354
to extreme poverty, but uh I mean, as Has

1161
00:58:02.354 --> 00:58:06.314
capitalism really been lifting people out of poverty? Has

1162
00:58:06.314 --> 00:58:08.715
that really been happening? Because it seems to me

1163
00:58:08.715 --> 00:58:13.554
that at least in recent years, a higher number

1164
00:58:13.554 --> 00:58:17.314
of people and even in the most developed countries

1165
00:58:17.314 --> 00:58:20.715
have been living in poverty, right?

1166
00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:24.929
It's a really good question. So it gets, what

1167
00:58:24.929 --> 00:58:27.570
is poverty? You get to this fundamental question and

1168
00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:30.370
and uh there's no easy answer to that question

1169
00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:32.409
because on the one hand you could say, you

1170
00:58:32.409 --> 00:58:36.620
know, simply you're starving, right, if you're if you're

1171
00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:38.290
starving, you're in poverty. But that but that doesn't

1172
00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:40.149
seem like enough because then you've got people who

1173
00:58:40.149 --> 00:58:42.689
are maybe not starving, but clearly living in in

1174
00:58:42.689 --> 00:58:45.649
really unacceptable conditions. And then you've got things like

1175
00:58:45.649 --> 00:58:48.689
social exclusion, some people think of that as, as

1176
00:58:48.689 --> 00:58:51.399
like poverty if you're just excluded from participating in

1177
00:58:51.399 --> 00:58:55.550
society. Um, SOMEONE who's like homeless might actually, you

1178
00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:57.790
know, in London, their, their, their money income would

1179
00:58:57.790 --> 00:59:00.830
put them way above the international poverty line, right,

1180
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:03.620
but they're completely cut out of society. So, so

1181
00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:05.909
there, there's lots of different ways of, of estimating

1182
00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:07.629
poverty. I don't think any of them are entirely

1183
00:59:07.629 --> 00:59:11.659
satisfactory. But what Pinker and Rosling and the New

1184
00:59:11.659 --> 00:59:13.629
Optimists and our world in data do is they

1185
00:59:13.629 --> 00:59:16.229
have this international poverty line, right, and it's like

1186
00:59:16.229 --> 00:59:18.919
$2 150 cents a day. Uh, NOW that's very

1187
00:59:18.919 --> 00:59:20.840
little. It is worth underscoring how little that is,

1188
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:25.399
it's like, um, less than $1000 a year. Um,

1189
00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.000
AND I think this is fundamentally flawed. Now there

1190
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.439
are a few reasons for that, but one of

1191
00:59:32.439 --> 00:59:34.040
them is that it, it creates a lot of

1192
00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:38.080
false certainty. Around the data that we have, like

1193
00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:41.199
we don't, we don't have that good data on

1194
00:59:41.199 --> 00:59:44.550
poverty in poor countries and especially among the poorest

1195
00:59:44.550 --> 00:59:46.659
people in poor countries. There's a guy called Morton

1196
00:59:46.659 --> 00:59:49.000
Jervin, a poverty researcher has looked at this and

1197
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.760
that sometimes the data they're just missing, right? And

1198
00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.719
then you get this kind of pristine graph that's

1199
00:59:53.719 --> 00:59:56.159
like poverty's declined, it's like well how many, for

1200
00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:58.479
how many countries is that, is that data actually

1201
00:59:58.479 --> 01:00:01.330
not there? I do think it's false certainty, right?

1202
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.520
But there is also this question of like, um.

1203
01:00:05.149 --> 01:00:09.350
How context dependent poverty is. So I think the

1204
01:00:09.350 --> 01:00:12.949
international poverty line puts poverty in um Egypt and

1205
01:00:12.949 --> 01:00:17.629
also Turkey at like 1%, right? And scholars from

1206
01:00:17.629 --> 01:00:19.429
those countries who work on their countries, they're just

1207
01:00:19.429 --> 01:00:21.909
like that's, that's ridiculous. 1% of the, basically none

1208
01:00:21.909 --> 01:00:24.229
of the population are in poverty. There are people

1209
01:00:24.229 --> 01:00:27.149
scraping by, you know, in Cairo, there are people

1210
01:00:27.149 --> 01:00:29.070
who are just like living on the streets. There

1211
01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:31.149
are so many people and the, the government puts

1212
01:00:31.149 --> 01:00:34.530
their poverty rate at like 30%. For that reason,

1213
01:00:34.699 --> 01:00:36.169
and I think this does get to the point

1214
01:00:36.169 --> 01:00:38.340
that really, yeah, poverty does just depend on the

1215
01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.459
society you're in, and I think we need relative

1216
01:00:41.459 --> 01:00:44.879
poverty lines that are like defined as a. As

1217
01:00:44.879 --> 01:00:48.000
a percentage of the national income, uh because uh

1218
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.760
the the bottom line is this, the idea of

1219
01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.199
needs and the idea of social exclusion, they interact,

1220
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.409
right, if you can't think about it like this,

1221
01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:59.469
right, you know, imagine going to a job interview

1222
01:00:59.469 --> 01:01:04.110
in the UK without clothing that's kind of. Nice

1223
01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:06.540
and acceptable to the people in in the UK,

1224
01:01:06.629 --> 01:01:09.050
right? You might even need a suit, right, at

1225
01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:10.510
least a shirt or something, and you need to

1226
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:12.189
be clean and well kept, you know what I

1227
01:01:12.189 --> 01:01:14.389
mean, all of these things. And that's like, yeah,

1228
01:01:14.469 --> 01:01:17.459
you have to be at this level, otherwise you're,

1229
01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:19.600
there's a, it's like a threshold, right, otherwise. YOU'RE

1230
01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.360
below it, then you're not, you can't get a

1231
01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.120
job, you can't get a house, you can't participate

1232
01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.719
in society. So that threshold is how we should

1233
01:01:25.719 --> 01:01:28.560
define poverty, in my opinion. Again, no easy way

1234
01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.179
to do it, but most governments and and er

1235
01:01:31.179 --> 01:01:33.239
researchers have settled on this kind of percentage of

1236
01:01:33.239 --> 01:01:35.479
median income or something like that. And if you

1237
01:01:35.479 --> 01:01:38.159
look at that country by country, you will find

1238
01:01:38.159 --> 01:01:41.360
that poverty, the picture with poverty isn't as rosy

1239
01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.520
as that, you know, precipitous decline with the international

1240
01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.629
poverty line, um. And people even in richer countries

1241
01:01:48.629 --> 01:01:51.429
like the USA there's poverty, right, whereas the international

1242
01:01:51.429 --> 01:01:53.669
poverty line would say there's basically none. No, there

1243
01:01:53.669 --> 01:01:55.219
is, of course there is, there's loads of homelessness

1244
01:01:55.219 --> 01:01:57.350
in the USA. Don't tell me there's no poverty

1245
01:01:57.350 --> 01:02:01.459
there, right? So I think that for me is,

1246
01:02:01.469 --> 01:02:03.510
is the fundamental problem here. Now I do want

1247
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:07.270
to underscore this by saying due to such impressive

1248
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:10.310
growth in places like China. There is still a

1249
01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:12.469
poverty reduction even using this line, if you use

1250
01:02:12.469 --> 01:02:15.550
the Chinese um poverty line, right, you still get

1251
01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:17.629
a lot of poverty reduction, right? So it's not

1252
01:02:17.629 --> 01:02:19.429
that it's completely invisible, but I just think we're

1253
01:02:19.429 --> 01:02:21.750
looking at the the wrong metrics here. And to

1254
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:24.030
understand poverty, you know, you need to go country

1255
01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:26.379
by country and even region by region. You know,

1256
01:02:26.389 --> 01:02:28.750
it differs based on whether what counting, you know.

1257
01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:30.419
If, if you're in a very hot country, you

1258
01:02:30.419 --> 01:02:32.739
don't actually need like a house as we would

1259
01:02:32.739 --> 01:02:35.020
have one in, in a colder country, right? You

1260
01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:36.820
know what I mean it just, it just changes,

1261
01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:39.179
it changes over time, it changes across space. And

1262
01:02:39.179 --> 01:02:42.580
I just think you need much more depth than

1263
01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:45.100
someone like Steven Pinker or or Hans Rosling is

1264
01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.379
going into with their, with their one graph that

1265
01:02:47.379 --> 01:02:48.169
solves everything.

1266
01:02:48.989 --> 01:02:52.629
Yeah, and I mean, the $2.15 a day, it,

1267
01:02:52.719 --> 01:02:55.800
it sounds really ridiculous to me. I mean, it's

1268
01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.760
not just that even for people in poorer countries

1269
01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.719
where maybe, I mean, the cost of living is

1270
01:03:01.719 --> 01:03:04.760
not as high as in other more developed countries.

1271
01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:10.729
I mean, $2.15 a day is, is still ridiculously

1272
01:03:10.729 --> 01:03:14.600
low, but, and I've heard some criticisms from, for

1273
01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:19.419
example, some Uh, socialist critics who say that it

1274
01:03:19.419 --> 01:03:22.580
should be $5 a day or it should be

1275
01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:25.340
even $10 a day and even that is, even

1276
01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:28.540
$10 a day, it's just $300 a month, so

1277
01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:31.889
it's not really that high. But I, I mean,

1278
01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:38.050
it's, isn't this amount uh ridiculous even for poor.

1279
01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:38.659
You

1280
01:03:38.659 --> 01:03:41.060
know, there was a guy who I think worked

1281
01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:46.090
at the statistics office for uh in Kenya. And

1282
01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:48.570
the, at the time, this was maybe a couple

1283
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:52.610
of decades ago, the official uh statistics put I

1284
01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:57.689
think half of the population below $2.15 right? And

1285
01:03:57.689 --> 01:04:01.090
he said, if that's true, half of my half

1286
01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:04.800
of my people are dead, right, because actually it

1287
01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:06.770
it there's these huge problems with like how we

1288
01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:09.969
estimate this, and I actually think that. You're talking

1289
01:04:09.969 --> 01:04:12.449
about a process of marketization, right, and again this

1290
01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:14.889
goes back to what we've been discussing all, all

1291
01:04:14.889 --> 01:04:17.840
through uh this talk, right, of capitalism establishing itself,

1292
01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:20.780
things being brought into the market, into the official

1293
01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:24.760
economy and. Researchers work hard at this, I don't

1294
01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.639
want to denigrate anybody who works on this. They

1295
01:04:26.639 --> 01:04:30.439
know that there's a problem here, but non-market forms

1296
01:04:30.439 --> 01:04:35.560
of subsistence are generally underestimated by this, right? And

1297
01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.229
so this gets to your point, because it's like,

1298
01:04:37.239 --> 01:04:39.560
actually I think the it's not like everybody's been

1299
01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.500
living on $1 a day or the equivalent for

1300
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.760
the whole of human history. Like the guy in

1301
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.864
Kenya said, that's ridiculous, they'd be dead. Right, people

1302
01:04:47.864 --> 01:04:49.985
need much more than that to subsist, and I

1303
01:04:49.985 --> 01:04:53.024
think our measures kind of overestimate the gains from

1304
01:04:53.024 --> 01:04:57.784
marketization. So, yeah, I mean $10 a day, Lance

1305
01:04:57.784 --> 01:05:01.024
Pritchard, I think said $15 a day. Even then

1306
01:05:01.024 --> 01:05:02.945
it's, it's really, it's really not that much money,

1307
01:05:02.985 --> 01:05:06.104
right? Um, SO I, I do think it's too

1308
01:05:06.104 --> 01:05:09.024
low, uh, but again, I think it, it, it

1309
01:05:09.024 --> 01:05:12.300
should be, it's too low. There's your headline, it's

1310
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.899
too low, but also it needs to be context

1311
01:05:14.899 --> 01:05:17.610
dependent and vary based on country and location and

1312
01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.060
and other needs as well. You know, if you've

1313
01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:21.219
got, like we mentioned disability earlier, if you've got

1314
01:05:21.219 --> 01:05:24.659
a disability, your needs are different, right? It's, it

1315
01:05:24.659 --> 01:05:26.429
might cost more money, you know, for you to,

1316
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.570
I don't know, just have a wheelchair or something,

1317
01:05:28.739 --> 01:05:31.219
right, so like, then that's a fundamental need. So

1318
01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:34.060
there's so much context dependence here, um, and I

1319
01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.979
don't think it's easy to say what is happening

1320
01:05:36.979 --> 01:05:39.790
to global poverty from a graph.

1321
01:05:40.639 --> 01:05:43.699
Right. And the other thing as well is that

1322
01:05:44.379 --> 01:05:47.610
even though many times people do not even consider

1323
01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:51.469
this is that it is very expensive to be

1324
01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:52.790
poor, right?

1325
01:05:53.310 --> 01:05:56.620
Yes, yeah, I mean this is, it's, it's uh.

1326
01:05:57.399 --> 01:06:00.129
It's a a vicious cycle, right? It's a vicious

1327
01:06:00.129 --> 01:06:02.669
cycle being in poverty because we were talking about

1328
01:06:02.669 --> 01:06:06.189
mobility, you know, and and this is the, you

1329
01:06:06.189 --> 01:06:08.669
know, the sharp end of that, because when you're

1330
01:06:08.669 --> 01:06:10.629
in poverty, OK, firstly, let's take a bet, you

1331
01:06:10.629 --> 01:06:13.469
can't eat, you you can't eat enough, right? That's

1332
01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:15.550
not good for you, that's not good for your

1333
01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:19.110
life chances, that's not good for your economic productivity

1334
01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:21.419
or anything, it's not good for your health, right?

1335
01:06:21.709 --> 01:06:24.510
And that kind of dynamic creates a lot of,

1336
01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:27.300
a lot of costs and there's this. There's a

1337
01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:30.040
lot of um. There are a lot of researchers

1338
01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.639
studying the effects of poverty now and the effect

1339
01:06:32.639 --> 01:06:34.679
it has on people, it can, you know, everything

1340
01:06:34.679 --> 01:06:38.229
from. It can reduce your IQ, right, there's some

1341
01:06:38.229 --> 01:06:40.310
famous research on that that shows when people are

1342
01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:43.149
impoverished, the same person, when they're poor versus when

1343
01:06:43.149 --> 01:06:45.909
they're rich, they're like, they score worse on intelligence

1344
01:06:45.909 --> 01:06:48.879
tests, it reduces your time horizon. There's no point

1345
01:06:48.879 --> 01:06:50.800
in planning for the future when there may not

1346
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.399
be a future, right? You need to work on

1347
01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:54.169
them now. Can I pay rent this year, uh,

1348
01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.000
this, this month, not, you know, what am I,

1349
01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.239
you know, am I going to invest in a,

1350
01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.270
in a house, in a mortgage over the next

1351
01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:02.719
5 years? You can't think about that, uh, you

1352
01:07:02.719 --> 01:07:05.520
don't have the mental bandwidth. And also there's, you

1353
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:08.959
know, directly to what you said, just the richer

1354
01:07:08.959 --> 01:07:12.439
you are, the cheaper things are, quite simply, because

1355
01:07:12.439 --> 01:07:14.439
a, a good example would be like a, a

1356
01:07:14.439 --> 01:07:16.830
phone contract, right? You you would have noticed that

1357
01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:19.350
if you get a mobile phone, if you pay

1358
01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:23.070
upfront for the handset, it's cheaper overall. Now you,

1359
01:07:23.189 --> 01:07:25.300
I, uh, you know, I, I can't afford that,

1360
01:07:25.389 --> 01:07:28.500
so I'm paying more over 18 months or whatever,

1361
01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:30.290
but there's a lot of things like that and

1362
01:07:30.290 --> 01:07:32.510
you know, as you, as you get richer, you

1363
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:35.949
can just invest in nicer things, right, which last

1364
01:07:35.949 --> 01:07:39.739
much longer, and then you reduce your expenses and.

1365
01:07:40.439 --> 01:07:42.120
There are things like, you know, even as you

1366
01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.959
get as you get as you get richer, you're

1367
01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:46.000
more likely to be given things as well, right,

1368
01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.199
you're just more likely to have things given to

1369
01:07:48.199 --> 01:07:52.030
you for no money at all. So poverty is,

1370
01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.919
it's a trap, right? It is a trap, it's

1371
01:07:53.919 --> 01:07:57.139
a vicious cycle, and lots of people, I feel

1372
01:07:57.139 --> 01:08:00.209
in our current analysis believe that the poor are

1373
01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:03.590
poor because they're, you know, they're, they're not productive,

1374
01:08:03.919 --> 01:08:07.080
um, because they, they don't plan for the future

1375
01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.909
and all things like that, it's like, no. For

1376
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.699
anyone, being in poverty creates that situation, right, being

1377
01:08:14.699 --> 01:08:19.529
it's, it's reverse causality, poverty causes those things, right,

1378
01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.649
it's not that those things cause poverty.

1379
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:25.500
Yeah, and a very interesting example I read once,

1380
01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:27.899
I think it was on Red. It was someone

1381
01:08:27.899 --> 01:08:31.020
saying that he had a very old car and

1382
01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.500
he didn't have lots of money. So he had

1383
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:36.060
to keep his old car, but then the car

1384
01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:39.770
kept breaking down and every time it broke down,

1385
01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:42.580
he had to take it to, uh, the garage

1386
01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:45.035
to get fixed and every. Thing like that. So

1387
01:08:45.035 --> 01:08:48.754
he was always spending more and more money on

1388
01:08:48.754 --> 01:08:52.015
this car just to be able to drive around.

1389
01:08:52.035 --> 01:08:54.875
And someone who has more money, who's rich or

1390
01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:57.825
even not even that rich, but with a little

1391
01:08:57.825 --> 01:09:00.995
bit more money, can just ditch the old car

1392
01:09:00.995 --> 01:09:03.404
and buy a new one and avoid all those

1393
01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:04.145
expenses.

1394
01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:05.354
100%, yeah.

1395
01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:09.979
So let me ask you now about the gender

1396
01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.569
pay gap. I know that you, uh, that you've

1397
01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:15.379
done an entire video on the gender pay gap

1398
01:09:15.379 --> 01:09:18.049
for your channel and you also write about it

1399
01:09:18.049 --> 01:09:20.620
in your book. It's a very interesting topic, not

1400
01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:24.379
only because there's, I, I mean, it's interesting in

1401
01:09:24.379 --> 01:09:27.450
itself talking about these things, but also because people

1402
01:09:27.859 --> 01:09:32.009
from uh both uh from both sides have uh

1403
01:09:32.009 --> 01:09:36.370
some compelling arguments, let's say, but What do you

1404
01:09:36.370 --> 01:09:38.939
make of it? I mean, first of all, is

1405
01:09:38.939 --> 01:09:42.419
it real? And if so, what causes it?

1406
01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:49.430
It's a fact that women have, on average, um

1407
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:53.620
lower access to resources than men, right? Women earn

1408
01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.470
less than men. If you take an average man

1409
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:58.149
and an average woman, right, the woman will earn

1410
01:09:58.149 --> 01:10:00.270
less, and I think Matt Breedig did the calculations

1411
01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:02.830
where that's like 60%. The average woman earns about

1412
01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:05.149
60% of what the average man does as of

1413
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:08.620
maybe 5 years ago, maybe it's pre-pandemic, right? Now,

1414
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:11.990
then there's there's these more nuanced questions. Um, WHAT

1415
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:14.509
about if they're both employed, right, then OK, yeah,

1416
01:10:14.589 --> 01:10:17.189
it drops and it's more like 80%. Then there's

1417
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:19.310
like, what if they're both employed in the same

1418
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:22.229
job, then I think it's more like 10%, right?

1419
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:24.080
So I think there is a gender pay gap,

1420
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:27.549
you know, uh uh at all levels. It reduces

1421
01:10:27.549 --> 01:10:30.930
once you start controlling for things. Once you start

1422
01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:34.529
adjusting for, OK, men and women are working differentially,

1423
01:10:34.569 --> 01:10:37.350
they're working different hours, they're working in different jobs,

1424
01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:41.049
that's, that's true. Now what you get with this

1425
01:10:41.049 --> 01:10:45.609
debate is, I think, quite a fundamental misunderstanding uh

1426
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:48.729
perpetuated by people like Jordan Peterson in his like

1427
01:10:48.729 --> 01:10:51.569
infamous debate with Cathy Newman on on Channel 4

1428
01:10:51.569 --> 01:10:54.359
where, you know, he, he knew more about it

1429
01:10:54.359 --> 01:10:55.970
and so, you know, it seemed like he was

1430
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:58.850
right, but actually. What he was saying basically is

1431
01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:01.930
that you should unambiguously control for all these things,

1432
01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:04.450
control for as many things as possible. Whether you're

1433
01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:06.290
working full time, how many hours you're working, what

1434
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:09.569
your occupation is, um, your personality traits even, are

1435
01:11:09.569 --> 01:11:13.069
you, uh, more agreeable, are men less agreeable than

1436
01:11:13.069 --> 01:11:14.529
women, that's why they get a pay rise and

1437
01:11:14.529 --> 01:11:18.359
so on. I think this really misses that those

1438
01:11:18.359 --> 01:11:22.029
very things can be the uh mechanism through which

1439
01:11:22.029 --> 01:11:25.430
women are discriminated against, right? So if you have

1440
01:11:25.879 --> 01:11:29.709
women are pushed out of jobs that pay better,

1441
01:11:29.959 --> 01:11:33.000
lawyers, bankers, what have you, and into jobs that

1442
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.600
pay worse, right, like secretarial roles or administrative roles,

1443
01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:38.759
or, you know, women being nurses as opposed to

1444
01:11:38.759 --> 01:11:41.189
doctors, right? If if you think about those kinds

1445
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:45.589
of things, then discrimination unambiguously does take place along

1446
01:11:45.589 --> 01:11:47.870
these metrics. There's a lot of experimental evidence on

1447
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:51.470
it or close to field experiments, um, on this,

1448
01:11:51.509 --> 01:11:54.049
as well as lab experiments too. There's so much

1449
01:11:54.049 --> 01:11:56.589
evidence that like women are just more likely to

1450
01:11:56.589 --> 01:12:00.529
be um. To to be rejected for for these

1451
01:12:00.529 --> 01:12:04.370
roles, right? And so then you have to ask,

1452
01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:07.160
well, OK, that that's how discrimination is taking place,

1453
01:12:07.209 --> 01:12:09.810
so yeah, women work different jobs than men, but

1454
01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:13.140
they. Um, AND that's why they earn less, but

1455
01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:16.140
that's not their decision. That's the decision of the

1456
01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.109
people who are who are who are not employing

1457
01:12:18.109 --> 01:12:20.339
them, right, who are rejecting them from these areas.

1458
01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:22.140
And on top of that, you've got more general

1459
01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:24.970
social pressures and, and gender expectations and things like

1460
01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:28.700
that. But I think just purely on employment, discrimination

1461
01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:32.330
against women is substantial, and that contributes to the,

1462
01:12:32.339 --> 01:12:33.259
to the gender pay gap.

1463
01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:36.910
And even in the book, when, uh, at a

1464
01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:40.189
certain point, if I remember correctly, when you talk

1465
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:44.580
about or address uh differences in personality, even if

1466
01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:48.709
it's true that women are on average more agreeable

1467
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:52.990
than men, I mean, uh, and but that apparently

1468
01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:57.509
would have some influence in terms of Uh, income,

1469
01:12:57.729 --> 01:13:00.250
but, but I mean, you, I, I think that

1470
01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:03.250
at a certain point you mentioned that in cases

1471
01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:06.890
where women are disagreeable or a little bit more

1472
01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:10.439
disagreeable than people are expecting them to be, then

1473
01:13:10.439 --> 01:13:13.459
they are penalized for that.

1474
01:13:13.729 --> 01:13:16.390
Right. Yeah, so being disagreeable I think leads. To

1475
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:18.819
pay rises on average, cos you're like, no, you

1476
01:13:18.819 --> 01:13:21.390
know, give me more money, um, I don't have

1477
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:23.509
any experience with that. I'm quite agreeable, so I,

1478
01:13:23.589 --> 01:13:25.549
I don't, I've never asked anyone for more money.

1479
01:13:25.589 --> 01:13:28.020
I'm always too scared, but, but if I did,

1480
01:13:28.109 --> 01:13:30.620
as a man, I'd probably be rewarded for it,

1481
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:33.470
whereas for women, they're they're less likely to be

1482
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:36.189
rewarded and that's exactly what this paper shows, right?

1483
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:40.410
It's like. They have agreeableness for men and agreeableness

1484
01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:42.009
for women, and it shows, yeah, there is a

1485
01:13:42.009 --> 01:13:44.569
gain for men, but there isn't one for women,

1486
01:13:44.649 --> 01:13:47.629
right, and that speaks to this kind of, this,

1487
01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:50.250
this bind that women are in, right, because it's

1488
01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:54.339
like. Men do better, men are treated better, and

1489
01:13:54.339 --> 01:13:56.660
men behave a certain way. But if you try

1490
01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:59.339
to behave like men, you won't necessarily be rewarded

1491
01:13:59.339 --> 01:14:00.700
for it, and in fact you might be punished

1492
01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:02.259
for it. I mean, there's other things like this,

1493
01:14:02.339 --> 01:14:05.959
there's like the competence likability trade-off, right, so men

1494
01:14:05.959 --> 01:14:09.620
are allowed to be competent and likable, right? You

1495
01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:11.660
could be like a really successful man and everyone's

1496
01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:13.220
like, oh yeah, you know, I respect him, he's

1497
01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:16.649
a good guy. If you're a really successful woman.

1498
01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:20.560
People, people are likely, people are less likely to,

1499
01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:22.790
to like you, right? They, they think that you're

1500
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:24.660
not very likable. You get all these sayings like,

1501
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.859
oh, you know, she's um I don't know if

1502
01:14:26.859 --> 01:14:28.819
you in the UK we say like a battle

1503
01:14:28.819 --> 01:14:31.379
ax or something, you say like uh or like

1504
01:14:31.379 --> 01:14:32.700
girl boss or I don't know, you just get

1505
01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.819
all of these sayings for like, you're, you know,

1506
01:14:34.979 --> 01:14:39.169
you're you're just because you're harsh for a woman.

1507
01:14:39.919 --> 01:14:42.600
To be successful, nobody likes you anymore, and and

1508
01:14:42.609 --> 01:14:45.000
and and you know that all of these binds,

1509
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.180
there are so many binds for women in the

1510
01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:49.830
workplace, so many things they have to deal with,

1511
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
and it's not enough for Jordan Peterson to say,

1512
01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.509
oh, you know, be more disagreeable, you'll get a,

1513
01:14:54.839 --> 01:14:57.830
you'll get a um a pay rise. I mean,

1514
01:14:57.919 --> 01:15:01.399
case in point, that interview, Cathy Newman was being

1515
01:15:01.399 --> 01:15:04.359
pretty disagreeable and uh I'm pretty sure that later

1516
01:15:04.359 --> 01:15:07.310
on he called her a possessed witch or something.

1517
01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.720
It's like. Would you say that about a man,

1518
01:15:09.799 --> 01:15:11.720
Jordan? I don't think so. So, you know, he's

1519
01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.189
just demonstrating that point succinctly.

1520
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.609
Yeah, right. So I, I want to ask you

1521
01:15:17.609 --> 01:15:20.939
now about some of the crises that people have

1522
01:15:20.939 --> 01:15:24.850
been experiencing in experiencing in the, in recent years,

1523
01:15:24.939 --> 01:15:27.899
like the housing crisis, inflation, the cost of living

1524
01:15:27.899 --> 01:15:31.009
crisis. But, uh, I mean, before we talk about

1525
01:15:31.009 --> 01:15:35.220
housing itself in the book, you tell us about

1526
01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:39.080
the importance of land. I mean, why is land

1527
01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:42.060
important and in what ways does that link them

1528
01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:43.609
to housing?

1529
01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:48.689
That's It it's the worst kept secret of the

1530
01:15:48.689 --> 01:15:52.680
housing debate that it's actually about land, right, and

1531
01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:56.560
I think land has, Land is, is, is fun

1532
01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:02.669
it's almost unimaginably fundamental because it's, it's probably the,

1533
01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:05.359
the clearest need we have in that you actually

1534
01:16:05.359 --> 01:16:07.680
can't exist if you're not on land, right, we

1535
01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.910
have to, we have to be on land somewhere.

1536
01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.799
So it really matters who owns that land, what

1537
01:16:12.799 --> 01:16:15.279
right what rights we have to it, how we're

1538
01:16:15.279 --> 01:16:17.959
allowed to interact with it, how it's balanced with

1539
01:16:17.959 --> 01:16:21.040
the needs of others and so on. And so

1540
01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:25.399
you've got that fact that, you know, we absolutely

1541
01:16:25.399 --> 01:16:28.040
fundamentally cannot do without land. We can do without

1542
01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.279
food more than we can do without land, right?

1543
01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.399
Plus you've got the fact that it's supply is

1544
01:16:32.399 --> 01:16:35.200
basically fixed, you can't really create land like that.

1545
01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:38.640
I mean there's some attempts, but um it really.

1546
01:16:38.939 --> 01:16:40.990
There is a certain amount of land on the

1547
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:44.310
world and there's not gonna be any more. And

1548
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:47.069
especially if you're talking about specific locations, each location

1549
01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:49.830
is unique. So whoever owns that land is gonna

1550
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:52.970
have like some kind of monopoly power. Uh, WE

1551
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:55.990
really need them and we can't create more, right?

1552
01:16:56.109 --> 01:16:58.270
So this is, this is what makes land what

1553
01:16:58.270 --> 01:17:00.509
I call the ultimate monopoly, right, the mother, the

1554
01:17:00.509 --> 01:17:03.149
mother of all monopolies, I think Winston Churchill called

1555
01:17:03.149 --> 01:17:07.379
it. And we've chosen to pursue this private model

1556
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:11.430
in most capitalist countries one way or another. I

1557
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:14.390
think even more in in English speaking countries, we've

1558
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:17.709
chosen this kind of private model and people privately,

1559
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:20.549
privately own the land and you have to buy

1560
01:17:20.549 --> 01:17:24.149
it uh to get access to it, and often

1561
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:26.549
it's not really, it's not really counterbalanced with the

1562
01:17:26.549 --> 01:17:30.390
needs of the community, and that has led to

1563
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:33.270
a lot, a lot of problems.

1564
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:37.870
Uh, SO, and in the book you also talk

1565
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:41.819
about land taxes. I mean, what are land taxes

1566
01:17:41.819 --> 01:17:45.459
and what benefits uh could we get from them?

1567
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:52.399
So, With things like house prices, right, when you

1568
01:17:52.399 --> 01:17:54.290
estimate the value of the land and the value

1569
01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:57.609
of of the housing separately, it's clear that when

1570
01:17:57.609 --> 01:18:00.000
house prices rise year on year, as they do

1571
01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:02.569
relentlessly in the UK as well as, as well

1572
01:18:02.569 --> 01:18:06.279
as across the globe, really, um. It's actually the

1573
01:18:06.279 --> 01:18:08.879
value of the land rising, and the reason for

1574
01:18:08.879 --> 01:18:10.799
that is that basically if you think about a

1575
01:18:10.799 --> 01:18:15.020
house. The actual physical house, if anything, it's depreciating,

1576
01:18:15.029 --> 01:18:17.509
right? It's, it's, you know, it's gonna need work

1577
01:18:17.509 --> 01:18:20.379
done over the years, um, it's gonna become older

1578
01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:24.709
and it might need stru like proper structural, uh,

1579
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:28.549
not reforms, um, but anyway, structural changes at some

1580
01:18:28.549 --> 01:18:33.279
point, right? So the house is, is. Deteriorating and

1581
01:18:33.279 --> 01:18:35.080
you can see that it's the value of the

1582
01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:39.040
land that matters because suppose, you know, something happens,

1583
01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:42.520
a new employer opens up nearby. What happens to

1584
01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.640
house prices in that area, they go up, a

1585
01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:48.080
new transport link opens. House prices in that area

1586
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.680
go up. I don't know, someone important, someone famous

1587
01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.720
moves in nearby, house prices go up, nothing's changed

1588
01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.959
about the house, it's the land or another way

1589
01:18:55.959 --> 01:18:58.080
of thinking about it is the location, right? It's

1590
01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:00.709
like where you are, what's available to you, right,

1591
01:19:00.879 --> 01:19:04.759
and that. And that just increases, right? And Winston

1592
01:19:04.759 --> 01:19:06.839
Churchill again, um, I don't like the man, but

1593
01:19:06.839 --> 01:19:08.549
he could turn a phrase, but he said, look,

1594
01:19:08.959 --> 01:19:11.680
every single one of these improvements to utilities, to

1595
01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.950
transport, to the broader economy, the landlord doesn't affect

1596
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:19.000
any of them. He sleeps and yet he yields

1597
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.799
the benefits as rents go up, right? And so

1598
01:19:22.799 --> 01:19:24.879
therefore what land tax does is it tries to

1599
01:19:24.879 --> 01:19:27.919
capture these economic rents, and economic rents are generally

1600
01:19:27.919 --> 01:19:30.399
thought of as something which is like unearned, it's

1601
01:19:30.399 --> 01:19:33.509
an unearned increment, it's not. It's not created by

1602
01:19:33.509 --> 01:19:36.069
the person who receives it, right? And that's just,

1603
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:37.990
you know, your landlord just happily sitting on all

1604
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:40.540
this land while the area's up and coming and,

1605
01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:42.669
and everything's going well and his rents, rents go

1606
01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:44.589
up, he hasn't done anything. He hasn't done anything,

1607
01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:46.589
he hasn't necessarily invested, it could be the same

1608
01:19:46.589 --> 01:19:49.500
house with with no investment, right? So, so that,

1609
01:19:49.709 --> 01:19:52.029
try to capture that just by taxing the value

1610
01:19:52.029 --> 01:19:54.589
of the land. Uh, THIS is what land tax

1611
01:19:54.589 --> 01:19:55.870
tries to do, and I think it has a

1612
01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:59.919
number of benefits. Number one. Generally speaking, you can

1613
01:19:59.919 --> 01:20:03.600
say that landlords are richer than non-landlords. I think

1614
01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.839
uh that's a pretty safe statement to make. So

1615
01:20:05.839 --> 01:20:07.839
it's redistributive if you tax land and give it

1616
01:20:07.839 --> 01:20:10.290
back to to the people. Uh, SO there's a,

1617
01:20:10.359 --> 01:20:12.399
you know, there's a basic political case for it,

1618
01:20:12.509 --> 01:20:14.589
uh, you know, redistributing the wealth and all that.

1619
01:20:14.879 --> 01:20:17.279
But there's also some more interesting effects of land

1620
01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:21.299
taxes because it's pretty much the only tax, I

1621
01:20:21.299 --> 01:20:25.669
think that may encourage rather than discourage economic activity.

1622
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:29.779
So because you are taxing land, no matter what

1623
01:20:29.779 --> 01:20:32.790
they do with it, the land is pre-existing, right?

1624
01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.470
Um, AND they're sitting on it. If you tax

1625
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:37.410
it, you kind of light a fire under their

1626
01:20:37.410 --> 01:20:40.470
feet and you make them invest because they need

1627
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:42.790
to make the money back, right? Or sell it

1628
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:45.470
to somebody who, who will. And so there are

1629
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:47.669
these really interesting studies of land tax that show

1630
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:50.750
actually it can kind of bring investment forward, right?

1631
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:53.430
Unlike other taxes which tend to discourage investment, it

1632
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:56.529
can bring investment forward. Right, and then you just,

1633
01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:59.180
uh, you actually end up with more with more

1634
01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:02.279
growth, more investment in buildings and, you know, less

1635
01:21:02.279 --> 01:21:04.560
land banking, you know, nobody just can just sit

1636
01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.310
on their land and not do anything with it.

1637
01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.720
So I think it's a really interesting tax cos

1638
01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:11.200
it it has the rare benefit of being kind

1639
01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:16.839
of morally just, um. And raising revenue, but also

1640
01:21:16.839 --> 01:21:19.450
probably being good on a pure on a purely,

1641
01:21:19.759 --> 01:21:22.669
you know, purely economic basis, on an efficiency basis,

1642
01:21:22.839 --> 01:21:26.200
and most economists from across traditions have agreed on

1643
01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.640
that. I think Milton Friedman said it, I think

1644
01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:29.919
Robert Solo said it, I think uh and obviously

1645
01:21:29.919 --> 01:21:32.080
Henry George and the Georgist uh love love to.

1646
01:21:33.149 --> 01:21:35.589
Love to sound this, this alarm about land value

1647
01:21:35.589 --> 01:21:36.040
taxes.

1648
01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:39.899
Yeah, uh, but I mean, what is then the

1649
01:21:39.899 --> 01:21:43.430
housing crisis and what led to it? I, I,

1650
01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:46.740
for example, I live in Portugal and people have

1651
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:50.419
talked a lot about the government having allowed many

1652
01:21:50.419 --> 01:21:54.899
rich foreign people to buy, um, uh, to buy

1653
01:21:54.899 --> 01:21:59.169
houses here to, to. Uh, AND, and then also,

1654
01:21:59.299 --> 01:22:04.970
I mean, many, uh, accommodations being used for tourism

1655
01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:07.259
and stuff like that. So, I mean, people have

1656
01:22:07.259 --> 01:22:10.629
been talking a lot about that here and in

1657
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:14.140
rent prices and house prices have been going up

1658
01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:16.700
and up and up and here in Portugal, for

1659
01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:20.419
example, rent prices are still going up and uh

1660
01:22:20.419 --> 01:22:25.765
we have a minimum wage of €870 a month.

1661
01:22:25.854 --> 01:22:30.415
And in Lisbon, for example, the capital, you can't

1662
01:22:30.415 --> 01:22:34.694
really rent a one bedroom apartment right now with

1663
01:22:34.694 --> 01:22:40.564
less than 1000 something euros. So it's basically impossible

1664
01:22:40.564 --> 01:22:43.064
to live in, in Lisbon for people who were

1665
01:22:43.064 --> 01:22:47.134
minimum minimum wage. So, I mean, but what led

1666
01:22:47.134 --> 01:22:50.609
to all of this? Really.

1667
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.879
I think there are, there are so many factors.

1668
01:22:53.919 --> 01:22:56.149
I mean, you mentioned the the super rich, right,

1669
01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:00.189
I do think that there's this problem. With pursuing

1670
01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:03.459
this private ownership model, that housing becomes an asset,

1671
01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:07.109
right, um, housing is an investment, it's a speculative

1672
01:23:07.109 --> 01:23:10.830
investment. It's also quite a sure thing because house

1673
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:14.149
prices just do seem to rise relentlessly. So compared

1674
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:16.629
to even the stock market, right, it's quite a

1675
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:18.540
good investment to make if you're a rich person,

1676
01:23:18.589 --> 01:23:21.390
if you're looking for some kind of return. And

1677
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:23.709
so you just get people buying up houses, you

1678
01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:25.990
get people buying up houses, people with more money

1679
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:29.270
than you, people who have collateral of various kinds

1680
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:31.270
who can, who can take on more debt than

1681
01:23:31.509 --> 01:23:35.290
the average potential buyer, especially someone like a, a,

1682
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:37.149
you know, a first time buyer, let alone somebody

1683
01:23:37.149 --> 01:23:39.549
who's on minimum wage. So you get that kind

1684
01:23:39.549 --> 01:23:41.990
of spiral, and you also get the banks buying

1685
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:45.540
into this because they're willing to make these mortgages,

1686
01:23:45.549 --> 01:23:48.310
er lend out these mortgages, and the rules around

1687
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:51.669
that have been relaxed over, over the decades. And

1688
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:54.750
they, they make these, uh, they, they lend this

1689
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:57.470
money and then the, the price of the house

1690
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:59.470
goes up, and that appears on their asset sheet,

1691
01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:01.229
so it's good for them as well. And you

1692
01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:03.629
just get this cycle, right, of like people with

1693
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:06.229
the money, people who can borrow the money, investing

1694
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:08.879
in in housing, using it purely as an asset,

1695
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:12.285
making a return, hoping the price increases. Um, AND

1696
01:24:12.285 --> 01:24:13.404
then, you know, they sell it and they move

1697
01:24:13.404 --> 01:24:15.165
on to their next one. So you have this

1698
01:24:15.165 --> 01:24:19.205
massive schism opening up between the relatively, you know,

1699
01:24:19.334 --> 01:24:22.845
wealthy and those who have access to capital, right?

1700
01:24:22.884 --> 01:24:24.805
And, and the rest of us who actually might

1701
01:24:24.805 --> 01:24:27.404
need to use the house as a house. So

1702
01:24:27.404 --> 01:24:29.685
that that's one thing, right? Um, I also think

1703
01:24:29.685 --> 01:24:32.714
you've got this issue as well, which we have,

1704
01:24:32.884 --> 01:24:34.084
I think, you know, you guys have got it

1705
01:24:34.084 --> 01:24:36.765
in Portugal with Lisbon. um WE have it in

1706
01:24:36.765 --> 01:24:40.080
the UK arguably even worse, but. There there's not

1707
01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:42.629
much economic opportunity outside of some of the major

1708
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:45.580
cities. Um, AND this is something that Germany does

1709
01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:50.259
relatively better, but again, but like, you know, yeah,

1710
01:24:50.339 --> 01:24:51.899
you can move out of London, you could, I

1711
01:24:51.899 --> 01:24:53.859
could go and buy a house for like 100,000

1712
01:24:53.859 --> 01:24:56.009
pounds somewhere in the UK, right, which is not

1713
01:24:56.009 --> 01:24:59.310
that much, right? But there wouldn't be anything there,

1714
01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:02.350
there wouldn't be any employment. Right, there wouldn't be

1715
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:04.950
any transport links, there wouldn't be any sort of

1716
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:08.310
cul culture, entertainment, etc. YOU know, and there wouldn't

1717
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:11.379
be any other people, let alone people I know.

1718
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:14.470
So we've got this very, I think we just

1719
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:17.709
allowed um our economies to become too concentrated on

1720
01:25:17.709 --> 01:25:19.919
the cities, which means there are too. People moving

1721
01:25:19.919 --> 01:25:23.870
there, right, relative to other, other areas and housing,

1722
01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:27.160
can't keep up. um, BUT the other areas are

1723
01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.319
actually very cheap, but the problem is nobody wants

1724
01:25:29.319 --> 01:25:30.919
to live there. So I think we need a

1725
01:25:30.919 --> 01:25:33.520
more fundamental rebalancing, as well as tackling the very

1726
01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.549
wealthy, we need to tackle kind of regional inequality.

1727
01:25:37.589 --> 01:25:39.549
As well, so, um, and then there's, I mean,

1728
01:25:39.629 --> 01:25:41.470
I don't know, there's 100 things that contribute to

1729
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:43.370
this. I could go on about them for ages.

1730
01:25:44.490 --> 01:25:46.709
OK, so let me ask you a different kind

1731
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:51.830
of question. What what alternatives are there to privately

1732
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:55.830
owned housing because this is something that people, particularly

1733
01:25:56.069 --> 01:25:59.589
in the west, I think, cannot get, uh, out

1734
01:25:59.589 --> 01:26:02.629
of their minds that the housing has to be

1735
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:04.390
privately owned, so.

1736
01:26:05.649 --> 01:26:09.049
In the UK in, in the 70s, I think

1737
01:26:09.049 --> 01:26:13.040
that um 1 in 5 people in the top

1738
01:26:13.049 --> 01:26:17.450
income quintile lived in social housing, right? Uh SOMETHING

1739
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:19.740
like that. Quite a few quite a few people

1740
01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:22.129
who were pretty well off were living in social

1741
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:25.319
housing. It was much more commonly accepted, it was

1742
01:26:25.319 --> 01:26:27.359
much more widely available. There was less of a

1743
01:26:27.359 --> 01:26:29.560
social stigma, and I do think we need to

1744
01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:31.919
bring that back. There are lots of countries which

1745
01:26:31.919 --> 01:26:34.120
do invest more in social housing, and they could

1746
01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.540
do it in different ways. In Finland, it's like,

1747
01:26:36.959 --> 01:26:39.279
uh, we will give you a house, right? It's

1748
01:26:39.279 --> 01:26:41.080
literally like that, it's like that straightforward, we'll give

1749
01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.229
you a house. In France, there's more um it's,

1750
01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:49.200
it's still private developers often, but they're required to

1751
01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:54.319
provide 20, 25% of um. Of their housing that

1752
01:26:54.319 --> 01:26:56.240
they build is supposed to be affordable, sorry, that's

1753
01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.520
specifically in in Paris, I think, not, not the

1754
01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:00.819
whole of France, right, and that's been really successful.

1755
01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:03.689
Um, ANOTHER approach entirely is these kind of more

1756
01:27:03.689 --> 01:27:08.839
communal ones like community land trusts, housing co-ops, those

1757
01:27:08.839 --> 01:27:11.129
are growing and I think they're they're present in

1758
01:27:11.129 --> 01:27:13.720
the USA in some states in the USA have

1759
01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.870
more communal approaches to housing. Switzerland has a lot

1760
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:19.200
of housing co-ops. I think the stat is 11

1761
01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.640
in 10. Uh, PEOPLE lives in a housing co

1762
01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:24.930
op in Switzerland, Geneva, sorry, in Geneva specifically. So,

1763
01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.919
you know, there are, there are all of these

1764
01:27:26.919 --> 01:27:30.399
different approaches, which one works, you know, which one

1765
01:27:30.399 --> 01:27:33.250
works in, in is is a country by country

1766
01:27:33.250 --> 01:27:36.720
or even a city by city matter, but my

1767
01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.720
number one policy would just be to provide more

1768
01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.479
social housing because I think publicly provide more social

1769
01:27:41.479 --> 01:27:45.060
housing and housing, you know, giving. Well, not, not

1770
01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:47.859
giving, but uh, you know, providing housing to to

1771
01:27:47.859 --> 01:27:50.339
people who are homeless as well. I think that's

1772
01:27:50.339 --> 01:27:53.700
absolutely fundamental. So that, again, it's similar with UBI

1773
01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:56.720
it's like everybody has this baseline, right? It's like,

1774
01:27:56.819 --> 01:27:58.459
it's there if you need it, you've got this

1775
01:27:58.459 --> 01:28:02.060
baseline, this public option, you know, your, your needs

1776
01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:03.740
are taken care of. If you want to buy

1777
01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:06.540
a massive private house, fine, whatever, but like there's

1778
01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:09.060
nobody's gonna fall below this line. This is the

1779
01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:11.020
fundamental thing that I think we need with our

1780
01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:13.459
economy, like nobody can fall below a certain standard

1781
01:28:13.459 --> 01:28:16.209
of living. Ever, no matter what happens.

1782
01:28:17.009 --> 01:28:21.220
Yeah. So another thing that people all over the

1783
01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:24.979
world have been experiencing recently has to do with

1784
01:28:24.979 --> 01:28:29.259
inflation. So what causes inflation, really?

1785
01:28:30.939 --> 01:28:33.379
That's a really good. I think there's there's, there's

1786
01:28:33.379 --> 01:28:35.500
no one thing that causes inflation, right? And I

1787
01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:38.140
think there are different types of inflation. So, you

1788
01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:41.600
know, in, in economics 101 class, you'll get the

1789
01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:45.660
cost push uh and demand pool, right? And uh

1790
01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:48.100
so you know, if costs increase in prices increase,

1791
01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:51.339
kind of, obviously almost tautologically, right? But also, if

1792
01:28:51.339 --> 01:28:54.379
there's high demand for certain things, then prices will

1793
01:28:54.379 --> 01:28:56.810
increase. Um AND I think. With the, with the

1794
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:59.189
recent cost of living crisis, it was mostly cost

1795
01:28:59.189 --> 01:29:02.750
push. We had this like clearly supply chains weren't

1796
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:06.819
working. We had um the Russia invading Ukraine, energy

1797
01:29:06.819 --> 01:29:09.350
prices went way up. We had all of these

1798
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:13.700
specific industries which were where costs uh rose massively

1799
01:29:14.069 --> 01:29:16.100
and that just led to a to an increase

1800
01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:19.330
in in prices as the global economy struggled to,

1801
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:22.500
to, you know, to sort itself out. Uh, NOW.

1802
01:29:23.259 --> 01:29:29.419
What's interesting I think is that inflation can. Shift

1803
01:29:29.419 --> 01:29:32.220
from being a sort of, you know, this price

1804
01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:35.859
is increasing, this price is falling, uh to a

1805
01:29:35.859 --> 01:29:39.680
sort of generalized. Wage price spiral, right, and that

1806
01:29:39.689 --> 01:29:42.140
that's the danger, that's what people were worried about

1807
01:29:42.509 --> 01:29:47.390
in 2022, 23. And um people were worried about,

1808
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:50.629
yeah, so like uh workers and and unions in

1809
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:54.310
particular might demand higher wages, then corporations increase their

1810
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:58.149
prices to maintain profits, and then workers say, wait

1811
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:59.990
a minute, our wages aren't worth as much anymore

1812
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:02.310
cos you've increased prices. Let's go again and again

1813
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:06.000
and again into this spiral, right? And that's something

1814
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.560
that I think is the worry with with um

1815
01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.879
inflation when there are periods of inflation, is it

1816
01:30:12.879 --> 01:30:15.200
going to spiral, is it going to become endemic

1817
01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.950
to the economy? And that's the thing that we,

1818
01:30:18.399 --> 01:30:20.240
I don't think we really know how to manage

1819
01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.839
that, and I, I hate to keep referencing Germany,

1820
01:30:22.879 --> 01:30:26.040
but they do have a situation where uh unions

1821
01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:29.970
are on the boards of centrally set um. That

1822
01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:32.109
that set wages centrally, right, and the unions are

1823
01:30:32.109 --> 01:30:33.589
there and the businesses there and the governments are

1824
01:30:33.589 --> 01:30:35.939
there and other representatives of civil society are there,

1825
01:30:36.109 --> 01:30:37.470
and they all sort of come to an agreement.

1826
01:30:37.549 --> 01:30:38.910
I think that's the kind of model we want

1827
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:43.140
to pursue to stop a wage price spiral, um,

1828
01:30:43.149 --> 01:30:46.979
but we also need, you know, really big changes

1829
01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:51.439
to the global economy, I think. Post-K Keynesians have

1830
01:30:51.439 --> 01:30:56.149
long emphasized the. There, there, there are things which

1831
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:58.169
are really fundamental right, we saw this with energy

1832
01:30:58.169 --> 01:30:59.910
and and Russia, Ukraine, there are things which are

1833
01:30:59.910 --> 01:31:03.299
really fundamental. We need to have ways to monitor

1834
01:31:03.299 --> 01:31:07.189
and manage these key sectors which if they go

1835
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:10.149
wrong, can threaten to bring everything down with them

1836
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:13.569
and can be passed through. To other prices as

1837
01:31:13.569 --> 01:31:16.569
well, right? Energy is probably the the best example

1838
01:31:16.569 --> 01:31:18.890
of this you can think of. So I think

1839
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:24.609
we need far, far more um active institutions that

1840
01:31:24.609 --> 01:31:28.330
are monitoring and managing inflation, wage price spirals, uh,

1841
01:31:28.339 --> 01:31:33.009
as well as like specific uh key sectors. And

1842
01:31:33.009 --> 01:31:35.209
just really so, so that we know what's going

1843
01:31:35.209 --> 01:31:37.129
on with prices because right now we've just got

1844
01:31:37.129 --> 01:31:39.529
this kind of interest rate management by central banks,

1845
01:31:39.569 --> 01:31:42.129
which is, it's a very blunt tool. What you're

1846
01:31:42.129 --> 01:31:45.609
doing basically is you're reducing demand by increasing mortgage

1847
01:31:45.609 --> 01:31:47.500
costs for people at the at the at the.

1848
01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:49.790
Base of it, that's actually what you're doing. So

1849
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:53.069
you're kind of treating inflation like it's demand pool,

1850
01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:55.830
when actually I think it's recently it's been cost

1851
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:59.189
push and potentially wage price spiral, but um, anyway,

1852
01:31:59.270 --> 01:32:02.029
that was a long and big rambling answer to

1853
01:32:02.029 --> 01:32:02.779
what you said.

1854
01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:06.770
No, and also related to something that you mentioned

1855
01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:09.520
there in the book, you talk about the movement

1856
01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:13.520
of goods, supply chains, and how the global economy

1857
01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:17.490
can break. So what are the things that make

1858
01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:23.410
our global economy vulnerable in particular kinds of circumstances?

1859
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:29.870
We didn't realize how fragile our supply chains were

1860
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:31.669
before the pandemic, and I, you know, I didn't

1861
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:35.509
realize. Nobody realized it was like 2008, right, no

1862
01:32:35.509 --> 01:32:37.589
economists saw it coming. I don't think most economists

1863
01:32:37.589 --> 01:32:39.390
even study the supply chain, I don't think they

1864
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:42.069
really understood it. There was one guy called Barry

1865
01:32:42.069 --> 01:32:46.669
C. Lynn, um, who warned in 2007. And he

1866
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:49.109
made a really prescient quote where he said, look,

1867
01:32:49.149 --> 01:32:51.470
it's great, yeah, we've got like trade now, we've

1868
01:32:51.470 --> 01:32:54.020
got all this stuff, all this amazing, you know,

1869
01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:57.689
uh, cheap stuff and technologies, blah blah blah. But

1870
01:32:57.990 --> 01:33:00.709
it's pretty fragile, you know, there are, there are

1871
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:03.509
companies, there there are cases where there's only one

1872
01:33:03.509 --> 01:33:05.589
company in the world that produces something, so there

1873
01:33:05.589 --> 01:33:09.109
was um the um the Japanese company, I think

1874
01:33:09.109 --> 01:33:11.779
they're called Merck, they produce Zirillik, which is like

1875
01:33:11.779 --> 01:33:15.160
a kind of. Uh, PAINT for cars, it's, it

1876
01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:18.200
gives it a kind of blackish tint, um, there

1877
01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.759
are a lot of cars that have that they

1878
01:33:19.759 --> 01:33:22.229
kind of shimmer, right, um, but it was only

1879
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:25.319
them, it's this one company in Japan that produces

1880
01:33:25.319 --> 01:33:27.049
it, and I think, I think it was the

1881
01:33:27.379 --> 01:33:30.189
um. God, what was it? I think was there

1882
01:33:30.189 --> 01:33:34.029
with the uh with the earthquake in 2011 when

1883
01:33:34.029 --> 01:33:36.950
suddenly they had to halt production, and then there

1884
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:41.149
was no irrelik anywhere, right, just because that one

1885
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:43.750
company had gone into crisis. Now of course it's

1886
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:45.830
a pain, it doesn't matter that much, but it

1887
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:48.589
does matter, and it did matter when it was

1888
01:33:48.589 --> 01:33:50.709
things like oil and gas, which we depended on

1889
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:52.509
Russia too much for, when it was things like

1890
01:33:52.509 --> 01:33:56.069
microchips, where we depend on Taiwan and particularly uh

1891
01:33:56.069 --> 01:34:00.990
one Taiwanese company for um. The TMSC um and.

1892
01:34:02.049 --> 01:34:06.640
And um you know, and. PPE equipment which had

1893
01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:09.450
to be um which had to be funneled through

1894
01:34:09.450 --> 01:34:12.180
a port in China, uh Jinghoo, I can't I'm

1895
01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:14.529
probably pronouncing it wrong but they the you know,

1896
01:34:14.819 --> 01:34:17.060
all of these things that are so crucial to

1897
01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:18.779
our way of way of life, one way or

1898
01:34:18.779 --> 01:34:21.959
another. They're really either they're only produced really in

1899
01:34:21.959 --> 01:34:23.879
one place or they have to pass through one

1900
01:34:23.879 --> 01:34:26.000
place. And what we don't have in the economy

1901
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.930
is this resilience, right? We don't have resilience. And,

1902
01:34:28.939 --> 01:34:30.879
and 11 point I make in the book, I,

1903
01:34:30.959 --> 01:34:33.560
I compare it to the human body, cause we've

1904
01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:37.640
got like 2 kidneys, right? Now that's probably a

1905
01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.399
bit too much in the sense that we don't

1906
01:34:39.399 --> 01:34:41.140
really need to use all of them all of

1907
01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:44.649
the time. But if you only had one kidney

1908
01:34:44.959 --> 01:34:48.890
and it got an infection or you know, um,

1909
01:34:48.919 --> 01:34:50.879
you had to have it removed or something, well

1910
01:34:50.879 --> 01:34:53.839
then you'd die, right? So we have to as

1911
01:34:53.839 --> 01:34:56.640
partly as insurance and this is, this notion of

1912
01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:58.799
resilience, it's kind of like insurance. We don't have

1913
01:34:58.799 --> 01:35:01.479
any insurance in the global economy. It's like we

1914
01:35:01.479 --> 01:35:04.890
just depended on everything. To keep running the way

1915
01:35:04.890 --> 01:35:09.569
it was with, you know, key industries expected to

1916
01:35:09.569 --> 01:35:11.580
do all of the heavy lifting. And another point

1917
01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.359
I want to make about this is the workers,

1918
01:35:13.529 --> 01:35:15.370
again, and these are, these are a type of

1919
01:35:15.370 --> 01:35:20.410
essential worker. You've got drivers, things like um truck

1920
01:35:20.410 --> 01:35:27.069
drivers, right, who are just literally. Waiting in queues

1921
01:35:27.069 --> 01:35:31.180
for hours, and the, because the deliveries aren't properly

1922
01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:34.020
coordinated, and so you're not sure if the ship's

1923
01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:35.700
gonna come, if if there's gonna be, you know,

1924
01:35:35.779 --> 01:35:37.859
if they're gonna be any goods for you to

1925
01:35:37.859 --> 01:35:40.419
deliver, and so you're just waiting and you're being

1926
01:35:40.419 --> 01:35:43.859
flexible where the rest of the system is is

1927
01:35:43.859 --> 01:35:47.089
basically quite unpredictable, right, and they're, they're kind of

1928
01:35:47.089 --> 01:35:49.930
the buffer. The these drivers waiting in the queues,

1929
01:35:49.970 --> 01:35:52.600
they're literally the buffer, and we're just depending on

1930
01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:55.930
them and they're obviously, as you might expect, poorly

1931
01:35:55.930 --> 01:35:59.450
paid, um, you know, don't have healthcare, and it's

1932
01:35:59.450 --> 01:36:01.129
like, you know, you can't, you know, you might

1933
01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:02.729
like wet yourself in the queue. We're talking about

1934
01:36:02.729 --> 01:36:07.410
hours, hours, hours in the queue, unpaid, might not

1935
01:36:07.410 --> 01:36:12.000
get work and that kind of, you know. Put

1936
01:36:13.009 --> 01:36:16.450
pushing all of the flexibility we need onto these

1937
01:36:16.450 --> 01:36:20.529
workers is to me fundamentally unacceptable, you know, from

1938
01:36:20.529 --> 01:36:23.009
a, from an obvious human standpoint, but also it's

1939
01:36:23.009 --> 01:36:25.450
just bad, it's just bad for for the system.

1940
01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:27.370
You need a system that actually works, that is

1941
01:36:27.370 --> 01:36:30.819
properly coordinated where. There are, there is resilience and

1942
01:36:30.819 --> 01:36:33.319
robustness in the supply chains. Things don't just come

1943
01:36:33.319 --> 01:36:36.180
from one area. Everybody in the logistics chain knows

1944
01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:38.379
what's going to happen. Everybody in the logistics chain

1945
01:36:38.379 --> 01:36:41.779
is properly remunerated, has a stable job, right? And

1946
01:36:41.779 --> 01:36:43.750
that's just going to produce a system that is

1947
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:46.379
itself much more stable and isn't dependent on, you

1948
01:36:46.379 --> 01:36:50.229
know, exploitation and pushing efficiency to the max at

1949
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:52.049
the expense of every other goal.

1950
01:36:53.209 --> 01:36:55.839
So for us to have a more resilient system

1951
01:36:55.839 --> 01:37:00.589
in the book, you talk about redundancy and compartmentalization.

1952
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:03.430
So tell us about that. What does each of

1953
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:04.750
those things mean?

1954
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:10.990
So redundancy um is is about having nodes in

1955
01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:13.100
a network that you don't need at any one

1956
01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:16.509
time. So uh your second kidney is partially redundant,

1957
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:22.310
right? That's that's that example. Um, COMPARTMENTALIZATION is like

1958
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:25.910
if one part fails, then the next one. That

1959
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:28.830
then other parts don't. Now again, with kidneys, showing

1960
01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:30.390
up my lack of medical knowledge here, but with

1961
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:32.310
kidney, if one, if you get one removed, you

1962
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:33.950
don't necessarily need to get the other one removed,

1963
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:37.629
right? So that's, we've got compartmentalization and redundancy in

1964
01:37:37.629 --> 01:37:40.149
our kidneys, right, you can see it there. Um,

1965
01:37:40.589 --> 01:37:43.910
YEAH, another example is the internet. Right, so the

1966
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:46.470
internet, there's no like internet, right, there's not like

1967
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:49.149
a building that's like this is the internet. The

1968
01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:51.390
internet's everywhere, it's all of our routers, my router

1969
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:55.029
goes down. My neighbour's router doesn't go down, right?

1970
01:37:55.399 --> 01:37:57.870
We've got, and there's, you know, there are different

1971
01:37:57.870 --> 01:38:00.279
ways to connect up the internet if some wires

1972
01:38:00.279 --> 01:38:02.879
over there go down, uh, it's not like the

1973
01:38:02.879 --> 01:38:05.160
entire area goes out, there are ways to reroute.

1974
01:38:05.399 --> 01:38:08.560
So again, we have compartmentalization and redundancy in the

1975
01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:10.919
internet. Every engineer knows that you need these things,

1976
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
right? You need like resilience because parts of the

1977
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.540
system will fail. And that's just, well they might

1978
01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:20.339
need to be repaired, you know, temporarily uh taken

1979
01:38:20.339 --> 01:38:23.379
down and so on. That's just what happens with

1980
01:38:23.379 --> 01:38:25.870
any system, but we've been pretending that that's not

1981
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:29.740
gonna happen with the uh global economic system. And

1982
01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:32.490
I think what we've seen recently, I mean let's

1983
01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:34.939
talk, let's pretend we're still in October when I

1984
01:38:34.939 --> 01:38:37.660
finish writing the book. What we've seen is um.

1985
01:38:39.149 --> 01:38:43.100
A lot of investment from countries from the USA

1986
01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:46.589
to China to India to the EU er into

1987
01:38:47.009 --> 01:38:50.229
this kind of redundancy and compartmentalization to say, yeah,

1988
01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:53.470
look, we're gonna have microchip factories in the USA

1989
01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:56.819
right? Uh, NOW, they may not be as good

1990
01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.680
as the ones in Taiwan or in the Netherlands

1991
01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:01.580
because those are at the absolute top of the

1992
01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:03.839
game, you know, they're like going for 2 nanometer

1993
01:39:03.839 --> 01:39:07.160
chips or whatever. They're, they're really, really highly efficient,

1994
01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:10.560
highly technologically advanced. No, it's not the case that

1995
01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:12.290
you need to compete with them on a level

1996
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:14.080
footing. What you need is to be able to

1997
01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.919
say, OK, suppose something like the supply chain crisis

1998
01:39:16.919 --> 01:39:18.600
happens again, which by the way, now it's looking

1999
01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:21.839
like it might because of Trump, um, you have.

2000
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:25.509
Access to, they're not quite as good, they're not

2001
01:39:25.509 --> 01:39:27.589
quite as efficient, but they're there, you still have

2002
01:39:27.589 --> 01:39:30.229
microchips, right? And so you can survive, you can

2003
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:32.830
get by, right, and just cos Taiwan goes down,

2004
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:35.390
it doesn't mean microchip production in the US goes

2005
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:38.509
down, right? So, so that's something that I think,

2006
01:39:38.549 --> 01:39:42.479
I think we have pursued across, across the globe,

2007
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:44.629
based on the lessons of the supply chain crisis,

2008
01:39:44.729 --> 01:39:47.459
whether we've pursued it enough, whether it will be.

2009
01:39:47.899 --> 01:39:51.020
Established yet, uh, when it's subjected to the next

2010
01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:53.009
test, which seems to be sooner rather than later,

2011
01:39:53.259 --> 01:39:54.229
that remains to be seen.

2012
01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:58.589
OK, so let me get into the last topic

2013
01:39:58.589 --> 01:40:01.220
that I want to cover with you today. Um,

2014
01:40:01.390 --> 01:40:04.479
I mean, let's talk a little bit more about

2015
01:40:04.479 --> 01:40:07.379
solutions. Of course, you've already mentioned some of them

2016
01:40:07.379 --> 01:40:09.470
and we went through some of them when it

2017
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:14.629
comes to housing, for example. But what would be

2018
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:19.549
general solutions to the problems that we covered here

2019
01:40:19.549 --> 01:40:22.750
today? I mean, in what ways should the economic

2020
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:24.549
systems be fixed?

2021
01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:27.850
We started by talking about the separation of the

2022
01:40:27.850 --> 01:40:30.970
economy from the rest of society and from politics

2023
01:40:30.970 --> 01:40:33.240
and from thinking about it as a separate sphere.

2024
01:40:34.009 --> 01:40:38.370
I would say that the overarching argument in this

2025
01:40:38.370 --> 01:40:40.810
book is that we shouldn't think about it that

2026
01:40:40.810 --> 01:40:44.419
way. Um, IT'S that we should actually bring it

2027
01:40:44.419 --> 01:40:48.939
under more democratic control, right? And so there's this

2028
01:40:48.939 --> 01:40:51.779
idea of demos, um, from ancient Greece, where like

2029
01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:55.459
people participate much more in the decisions that affect

2030
01:40:55.459 --> 01:40:57.859
them, where they're not subject to the tyranny of

2031
01:40:57.859 --> 01:41:00.180
the state, but also not subject to the tyranny

2032
01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:02.709
of the market. And so you're kind of freeing

2033
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:04.509
people up. UBI is one way of doing this,

2034
01:41:04.589 --> 01:41:06.509
like freeing them from the tyranny of the market,

2035
01:41:06.589 --> 01:41:10.680
right? Also things like worker democracy, uh, the kinds

2036
01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:13.279
of systems they have in Germany, that direct control,

2037
01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:16.390
uh, things like community land trusts, which we discussed.

2038
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:19.189
There are people pursuing these kind of land back

2039
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:22.620
movements, you know, taking land in B. THERE'S these

2040
01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:25.509
organizations that take land and take housing, um, that

2041
01:41:25.509 --> 01:41:28.870
isn't being used under the Brazilian constitution, which says

2042
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:31.350
that land should have a social purpose. All of

2043
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:34.589
these efforts for me and as again, also reining

2044
01:41:34.589 --> 01:41:38.270
in billionaires, right? They're all about bringing things fundamentally

2045
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:43.040
under our control, right? And not allowing the market

2046
01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:44.720
to dominate, not allowing the state to dominate, and

2047
01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:47.560
not allowing any one individual to dominate whether they're

2048
01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:50.000
a politician or a billionaire or both, as the

2049
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.279
case may be. Uh, SO I, I really think

2050
01:41:53.279 --> 01:41:56.200
that this idea of demos and just bringing the

2051
01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.399
economy back under the control of the people is

2052
01:41:59.399 --> 01:42:05.029
the fundamental. Solution to, to, to these problems because

2053
01:42:05.029 --> 01:42:07.540
we don't need to like appease the economy. We

2054
01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:09.189
don't need to treat it as something that we

2055
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:11.669
like can't control, that can't work for us. We

2056
01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:13.790
don't need to sacrifice ourselves on the altar of

2057
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:16.629
the economy, you know, pursue austerity because it's good

2058
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:18.620
for the economy, even though it's bad for people.

2059
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:21.350
No, that doesn't work. Um, WHAT'S good for people

2060
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:24.180
is often good for the economy, but really we're,

2061
01:42:24.459 --> 01:42:25.549
you know it sounds a bit cheesy, but we

2062
01:42:25.549 --> 01:42:27.669
need to put people first, right? And I think

2063
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:28.870
Demos is the route to do that.

2064
01:42:30.279 --> 01:42:32.680
So tell us just a little bit more and

2065
01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:34.859
I think this will be my last question about

2066
01:42:35.439 --> 01:42:39.919
possible democratic forms of ownership because particularly when it

2067
01:42:39.919 --> 01:42:43.879
comes to, for example, companies, people uh have been

2068
01:42:43.879 --> 01:42:47.149
used for a long time to this sort of

2069
01:42:47.439 --> 01:42:52.580
hierarchical for. OF ownership where, I mean, common workers

2070
01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:55.259
don't really have much of a saying in how

2071
01:42:55.259 --> 01:42:59.040
the companies are run. Uh, BUT, uh, what, in

2072
01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:03.930
what ways can we sort of organize our labor,

2073
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.140
our companies in more democratic ways?

2074
01:43:09.450 --> 01:43:12.689
It's, it's really incredible to me, um, I think,

2075
01:43:12.729 --> 01:43:14.549
I think this is a good selling point for,

2076
01:43:14.729 --> 01:43:17.160
for people who are more progressive as well, because

2077
01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:20.490
most people who work, um, in a sort of

2078
01:43:20.490 --> 01:43:23.810
standard job feel that, you know, they know their

2079
01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:25.569
job really well, they know what goes on, and

2080
01:43:25.569 --> 01:43:27.529
they probably know it better than their boss, and

2081
01:43:27.529 --> 01:43:30.209
they probably feel like they aren't remunerated enough and

2082
01:43:30.209 --> 01:43:32.009
all the rest of it. And yet they won't

2083
01:43:32.009 --> 01:43:34.240
have a say in the decisions about, about their

2084
01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:35.959
job, about what they do. They get told what

2085
01:43:35.959 --> 01:43:37.520
to do, they can probably think of a better

2086
01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:39.560
way to do it. They can probably think of,

2087
01:43:39.759 --> 01:43:41.279
you know, decisions that they'd like to be a

2088
01:43:41.279 --> 01:43:43.680
part of in the company. And so, yeah, this

2089
01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:45.830
idea of like worker democracy for me is really

2090
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:49.080
fundamental. I think that workers know the most about

2091
01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:51.720
their situation. I think that they have access to

2092
01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:55.160
better information, more on the ground information. Uh WHAT

2093
01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:57.970
James C. Scott, the anarchist called Metis. Which is

2094
01:43:57.970 --> 01:44:01.129
like just knowledge of the job, right, like the,

2095
01:44:01.169 --> 01:44:03.250
like can't be put into a contract that can't

2096
01:44:03.250 --> 01:44:05.410
be written down. So like one of the good

2097
01:44:05.410 --> 01:44:07.359
examples of Metis is the work to rule strike,

2098
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:10.319
which I think is French, um, but yeah, the,

2099
01:44:10.410 --> 01:44:12.370
the work to rule strike where you like, what

2100
01:44:12.370 --> 01:44:14.200
they. DO is just follow the rulebook. I think

2101
01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:16.879
taxi drivers in France pioneered it. Uh, THEY just

2102
01:44:16.879 --> 01:44:19.240
follow the rules, and obviously everything grinds to a

2103
01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.279
screeching halt because there are so many little things

2104
01:44:21.279 --> 01:44:23.439
that they do that are outside the rules that

2105
01:44:23.439 --> 01:44:25.799
the top down rules can't know about, that the

2106
01:44:25.799 --> 01:44:30.049
boss can't necessarily know about um the. That actually

2107
01:44:30.049 --> 01:44:32.290
make things tick over. And that's kind of what's

2108
01:44:32.290 --> 01:44:33.890
happening with the supply chain as well, when I

2109
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:36.250
talked about these exploited workers, right, they're making it

2110
01:44:36.250 --> 01:44:38.330
work on the ground. And those should be the

2111
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:40.850
people that are running the businesses that are running

2112
01:44:40.850 --> 01:44:43.370
the corporations, right, that have a say in other

2113
01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:46.290
political decisions. So I really think it's, it's something

2114
01:44:46.290 --> 01:44:49.024
which will be very intrinsically good. I think people

2115
01:44:49.024 --> 01:44:53.015
who, you know, participating in the decisions that affect

2116
01:44:53.015 --> 01:44:54.544
you, I think is very good for people. I

2117
01:44:54.544 --> 01:44:56.384
think people like to do it. People like to

2118
01:44:56.384 --> 01:44:58.174
have a say, they don't like to be sidelined.

2119
01:44:58.345 --> 01:45:00.265
So it's a good in itself, but I just

2120
01:45:00.265 --> 01:45:01.975
think it will lead to better outcomes as well.

2121
01:45:02.035 --> 01:45:03.984
I think if people have a say, you're going

2122
01:45:03.984 --> 01:45:07.024
to look at companies being, being run, run much

2123
01:45:07.024 --> 01:45:10.544
better. Um AND so that's, that's, you know, worker

2124
01:45:10.544 --> 01:45:12.984
democracy is really fundamental to me. I think it's

2125
01:45:12.984 --> 01:45:15.384
a really good thing. And as far as I

2126
01:45:15.384 --> 01:45:17.185
can see, and I've reviewed all of the literature

2127
01:45:17.185 --> 01:45:20.910
on this. There is basically no evidence for it

2128
01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:24.509
producing worse outcomes on almost any metric. It's good

2129
01:45:24.509 --> 01:45:27.149
for equality within the firm, um, it's good for

2130
01:45:27.149 --> 01:45:31.689
like productivity, it's good for firm survival rates. It

2131
01:45:31.689 --> 01:45:35.350
it really is just a win-win, except for the

2132
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:36.620
bosses, of course.

2133
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:41.560
Yeah, sure. So, I mean, is there any other

2134
01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.310
message that you would have coming from your book?

2135
01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:47.279
Anything else you would like to tell us,

2136
01:45:47.319 --> 01:45:49.709
or? Uh, IF I may, I'd like to reflect

2137
01:45:49.709 --> 01:45:52.439
on what's happened since uh he's finished writing it

2138
01:45:52.439 --> 01:45:55.189
because it's like I said, it was October, right?

2139
01:45:55.319 --> 01:45:57.629
So obviously a lot has changed since then. Now,

2140
01:45:57.879 --> 01:45:59.439
one thing that's really interesting, so we didn't actually

2141
01:45:59.439 --> 01:46:01.160
mention this, but I, I talked to, I talk

2142
01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:03.770
about two things. The books split into two parts,

2143
01:46:03.810 --> 01:46:06.370
right? The economy is uneven and the economy is

2144
01:46:06.370 --> 01:46:09.370
dysfunctional. So the first stuff we discussed with um

2145
01:46:09.370 --> 01:46:12.370
billionaires, social mobility, essential workers, that's about the economy

2146
01:46:12.370 --> 01:46:15.850
being uneven, the inequalities that manifest in various ways

2147
01:46:15.850 --> 01:46:17.970
and have a negative impact on, on most of

2148
01:46:17.970 --> 01:46:21.290
us. Um, THEN you've got the dysfunctions, the housing

2149
01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:24.370
sector, the way we manage inflation, um, the supply

2150
01:46:24.370 --> 01:46:26.410
chain crisis, parts of the economy that just don't

2151
01:46:26.410 --> 01:46:29.189
work. And you've also got this debate surrounding the

2152
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:31.790
new optimists and whether there are gains in certain

2153
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:35.149
metrics versus others, right? Now what didn't occur to

2154
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:37.470
me when writing the book, and I wish I'd

2155
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:39.470
put this in because I would have seemed like

2156
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:43.669
prescient, um, but evidently I'm not that prescient. The,

2157
01:46:43.919 --> 01:46:46.870
the parts of the economy that uh sorry, an

2158
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:51.359
uneven economy leads to a dysfunctional economy, right? So

2159
01:46:51.359 --> 01:46:55.120
having these inequalities, right, that leave communities left behind

2160
01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:58.720
that lead to political backlash, which um and which

2161
01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:01.799
allow billionaires to take advantage of this backlash, they

2162
01:47:01.799 --> 01:47:04.680
endanger some of the good parts of the the

2163
01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:07.879
economy and they make the economy more dysfunctional. So

2164
01:47:07.879 --> 01:47:10.160
if you see something like Trump and Musk, right?

2165
01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:12.540
You see, I, I talk about Musk at length

2166
01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:14.899
in the billionaires chapter, I say he's taken control

2167
01:47:14.899 --> 01:47:18.330
of so many different areas of life from, Uh,

2168
01:47:18.339 --> 01:47:21.700
from Tesla to the boring company, to media, to

2169
01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:25.299
Starlink and SpaceX, he's he's taken control. Now what

2170
01:47:25.299 --> 01:47:28.100
he's literally done now is insert himself into the

2171
01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:30.950
US government, and he's tried to cut a lot

2172
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:33.379
of these programs that have benefited people across the

2173
01:47:33.379 --> 01:47:35.220
world. They tried to cut off like a special

2174
01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:38.759
type of peanut butter. That is given to impoverished

2175
01:47:38.759 --> 01:47:41.830
children, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. There were warehouses full

2176
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:43.350
of it, I think in in New York and

2177
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:45.589
they weren't allowing them to send them. Eventually I

2178
01:47:45.589 --> 01:47:47.740
think a court order made them do it, thankfully,

2179
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:49.669
but they've been trying to cut this off, they're

2180
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:52.589
targeting Social Security, they're targeting the Department of Education,

2181
01:47:52.709 --> 01:47:57.990
right? So this uneven economy, it, it endangers. Uh,

2182
01:47:58.410 --> 01:48:00.169
THE rest of the economy, it makes the rest

2183
01:48:00.169 --> 01:48:03.160
of the economy dysfunctional. The bad parts of our

2184
01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:07.359
economy endanger the gains that we have made over

2185
01:48:07.359 --> 01:48:10.209
the past few decades, and that for me is

2186
01:48:10.209 --> 01:48:11.810
a real, real risk, and I think we're seeing

2187
01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:16.180
it played out just so explicitly and vividly, and

2188
01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:18.250
I think it is, we have no choice but

2189
01:48:18.250 --> 01:48:22.290
to rein in, um, these, these inequalities, otherwise everything

2190
01:48:22.290 --> 01:48:23.649
else will be endangered as well.

2191
01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:28.450
Great. So the book is again why we're Getting

2192
01:48:28.450 --> 01:48:31.129
Poorer A Realist's Guide to the Economy and how

2193
01:48:31.129 --> 01:48:33.410
we can fix it. Of course, I'm leaving a

2194
01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:35.970
link to it in the description box down below

2195
01:48:35.970 --> 01:48:40.250
and also to your amazing channel and learning economics

2196
01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:42.959
anywhere else, people can find you on the internet.

2197
01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:45.569
Uh, I'm now on TikTok and Instagram. I've been

2198
01:48:45.569 --> 01:48:48.169
doing some shorts, so you can find me, find

2199
01:48:48.169 --> 01:48:49.970
me on there. I've got a few videos and

2200
01:48:49.970 --> 01:48:50.569
more to come.

2201
01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:55.319
OK, great. So, look, it's been really fun to

2202
01:48:55.319 --> 01:48:57.160
talk with you. It's been an honor to have

2203
01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.839
you on the show. As I said, I've been

2204
01:48:58.839 --> 01:49:00.959
a big fan of your channel for a long

2205
01:49:00.959 --> 01:49:03.879
time. And if you would be open to it,

2206
01:49:03.959 --> 01:49:07.879
it would also be a great pleasure to potentially

2207
01:49:07.879 --> 01:49:10.680
somewhere in the future have you back. To talk

2208
01:49:11.129 --> 01:49:13.850
perhaps some of the topics we left out here

2209
01:49:13.850 --> 01:49:16.569
today. And from, uh, it would also be nice

2210
01:49:16.569 --> 01:49:20.169
to talk about Trump's tariffs and those sorts of

2211
01:49:20.169 --> 01:49:21.080
things. So,

2212
01:49:21.250 --> 01:49:23.450
yeah, yeah, yeah, we, we, we covered a lot.

2213
01:49:23.569 --> 01:49:25.529
We did cover a lot. It was impressive, but

2214
01:49:25.529 --> 01:49:27.089
we didn't do everything, so I'd I'd love to

2215
01:49:27.089 --> 01:49:27.520
come back.
