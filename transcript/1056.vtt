00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:03.089
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:05.809
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes and

3
00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.770
today I'm joined by Doctor Elena Zilioti. He's an

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.130
she is an assistant professor of ethics and political

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.569
philosophy at the Delft University of Technology, and she

6
00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:16.170
is the author of the book we're going to

7
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.409
talk about today, Meritocratic democracy Across Cultural Political Theory.

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.729
So, Doctor Zilliotti, welcome to the show. It's a

9
00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:24.649
pleasure to have you on.

10
00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:27.700
Hi, Ricardo, thanks for having me here.

11
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.370
So, let me start by asking you perhaps a

12
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.729
general question. So, could you start, uh, could you

13
00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:36.610
start by telling us maybe what is the premise

14
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.650
of your book and what are some of the

15
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.049
main questions that you set out to tackle there?

16
00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:46.950
Yeah, um, so the premises of the book are,

17
00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:50.000
um, primarily the fact that, uh, we live in

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.240
a global world, uh, is much more, uh, well

19
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.459
connected than before, and democracy is a global phenomenon,

20
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.319
and at the moment we have a significant data

21
00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:04.199
that democracy that tells us that democracy is in

22
00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.750
crisis, so there is a, a huge demand to

23
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.319
rethink and to discuss about democracy. And this is

24
00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:14.279
a little bit the background, the premises of uh

25
00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:17.440
the book, and then the book uh uh tries

26
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.040
to tackle uh some uh key fundamental questions both

27
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.569
at the methodological level and also the content level.

28
00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:28.519
Um, WHEN it comes to math, the, partly because,

29
00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:30.639
as I say, that one of the background assumption

30
00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:32.879
is that we live in a, in a global

31
00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:35.970
world, globalized world and democracy is a global phenomenon.

32
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.959
Uh, ONE key question is, uh, how can cross-cultural

33
00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.099
debate help us to understand and even develop, uh,

34
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.410
uh, theories of government for contemporary times? Um, AND

35
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.160
so how we can use different sites from different,

36
00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.239
uh, uh, intellectual traditions to think or rethink democracy.

37
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.610
At the content level then, uh, the book deals

38
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.250
with the, uh, three main fundamental questions. One is

39
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.130
the justification for democracy. Um, IS democracy, um, a

40
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.070
justifiable form of government today and if it's so,

41
00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.149
why? And second, uh, what is the role or

42
00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:18.539
the functions of uh uh democratic leaders in uh

43
00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:23.190
uh democratic society. So, mm, political leaders in the

44
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.509
democratic system are one of the key, um, topics

45
00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.809
of the book. And the third point is uh

46
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.710
concerning um whether democracy or how can democracy ensure

47
00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.419
that political leaders work for democracy, not against it.

48
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.149
Mhm. And we're going to tackle all of those

49
00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.660
questions here today, but before we get into that,

50
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.389
generally speaking, how is democracy approached in political science

51
00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:56.100
and political philosophy? What does democracy mean exactly?

52
00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:00.789
Yeah. So democracy means, as you expect by academic,

53
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.389
but scholars debate, democracy means different things to different

54
00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:09.389
people and to complicate the story even more, that

55
00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.350
situation is, is true even if you consider different

56
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.279
philosophers in different times. Um, BUT so there are

57
00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:21.110
people who thinks of democracy in a way as

58
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.250
one person, one vote. Um, OTHER propose a more

59
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.940
um elaborated, I would say conception of democracy. They

60
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.899
emphasize, for example, uh, the, the importance of public

61
00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:39.410
participation and political equality, uh, has key principle of

62
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.979
uh uh democratic government together also with the individual

63
00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:47.460
rights. There are also contemporary debates that uh um

64
00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:51.130
consider not so much the procedural element of democracy,

65
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.710
how democratic system work from a a procedural perspective

66
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.529
has a process of decision making, but rather has

67
00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:02.050
a kind of uh um more instrumental approach to

68
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.149
democracy. So what we can. Uh, GET out of

69
00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:09.380
democracy, what kinds of political output, uh, democracy can,

70
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.830
uh, develop. And uh here different scholars have elaborated

71
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.070
on the um the epistemic value of democracy. So

72
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.500
epistemic means knowledge primarily. So the, the possibility that

73
00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:28.420
democratic system of governments, we are able to collect

74
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.500
the different insights on what political problems are in

75
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.970
our society and also different insights on how we

76
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.059
can develop better perspective on possible solutions to them.

77
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.940
So some people at the moment are emphasizing the

78
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.459
epistemic equality of democracies. DEMOCRACY is also a specific

79
00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:54.779
kinds of government that is able to gather different

80
00:04:54.779 --> 00:05:00.304
knowledge, different experience that is scattered around society. And

81
00:05:00.304 --> 00:05:02.825
because it has these kinds of open or much

82
00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:05.904
more open decision making process that alternative form of

83
00:05:05.904 --> 00:05:11.605
governments is able under specific circumstances to define and

84
00:05:11.605 --> 00:05:14.424
have higher chances to better define political issues and

85
00:05:14.424 --> 00:05:18.665
also um provide a possible solutions to them.

86
00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:24.190
So in the book, in order to tackle some

87
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.470
of the issues that we're going to talk about

88
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.750
that have to do with democracies and how they

89
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.940
work, some of their aspects, and then to bring

90
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.390
about meritocratic democracy. You bring to the table and

91
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.700
draw from both Western political theory and Confucian or

92
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.019
East Asian political theory. So, uh, just to introduce

93
00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:47.100
them to the audience, what would you say are

94
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.940
some of the main aspects, the more important aspects

95
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.579
of each of them that you would say people

96
00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:57.040
need to understand to then tackle the issues you

97
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.269
address

98
00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:01.170
in the group. Yeah, um, so I would define

99
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.450
uh Confucian political theory and Western political theory has

100
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:11.369
two subfields of one academic field that is named

101
00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:17.880
political theory. So this field offers um reflection on

102
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.489
key political concept and key political issues and attempts

103
00:06:22.489 --> 00:06:25.459
to generate some action guidance so how we can

104
00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:28.679
Better defined and also better deal with certain political

105
00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:30.959
uh problems, but also what is the right thing

106
00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:33.989
to do when it comes to certain political situations.

107
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.649
Now, uh Confucian political theories that's that subfield of

108
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:42.910
political theory that uh uh is connected to Confucianism,

109
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.369
that is one of the most ancient um tradition

110
00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:50.739
in that or in the East Asian continent. It,

111
00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:53.480
it started in, in China, it spread all around

112
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.829
East Asia and around the world. Um, AND so

113
00:06:56.829 --> 00:07:00.790
you have, uh, uh, scholars, so political theories interested

114
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.989
in political questions that, uh, uh, are at the

115
00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:08.149
same time connected uh and committed to, uh, Confucian

116
00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:13.899
fundamental principles and values. And uh uh Western political

117
00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:17.570
theory is a subfield of political theory, uh, primarily

118
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.299
I would say that uh is the biggest uh

119
00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:24.739
subfield in political theory, and there are a lot

120
00:07:24.739 --> 00:07:29.019
of discussions also that our field is too Western-centric,

121
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.420
so, uh, we tend to associate Western political theory

122
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.369
with political theory, but that's uh it's a mistake.

123
00:07:35.609 --> 00:07:38.010
The political theory is much broader than just Western

124
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.779
political theory. But Western political theory is the political

125
00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:44.769
theory that uh um is associated with the Western

126
00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:48.690
intellectual traditions. So here we have philosophers that are

127
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.290
more, more connected with certain kinds of concepts and

128
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.500
ideas that have developed in the uh in Western

129
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.390
philosophy. And at the moment, uh, uh, I, uh,

130
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.619
you can see a very interesting debates uh happening

131
00:08:01.619 --> 00:08:05.040
uh in Confucian political theory and the Western political

132
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.559
theory. So the book is uh focusing and connecting

133
00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:12.279
on contemporary debates uh in uh Confucian and Western

134
00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:16.399
political theories about democracy, so debates about democracy, because

135
00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:19.109
at the moment you have each a discussion, uh,

136
00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:22.279
on, in both these uh subfields of political theory,

137
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:27.000
primarily on uh uh democracy. In Confucian political theory,

138
00:08:27.369 --> 00:08:30.399
um, you have a background of the so-called renaissance

139
00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:33.169
of the East Asia. So East Asia has grown

140
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:38.169
significantly economically and uh um had this created a

141
00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.570
very strong impact at the, at the social level,

142
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.090
cultural level. So there is a lot of discussions

143
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.989
among uh Confucian scholars on how we can Rethink

144
00:08:46.989 --> 00:08:50.900
and whether we should rethink our political uh structures

145
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.520
and ideas given contemporary East Asian situation, given how

146
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.109
pluralistic, even how different we are from what uh

147
00:08:59.469 --> 00:09:02.549
uh East Asian society were in the past. And

148
00:09:02.549 --> 00:09:05.789
so you have uh uh a very interesting debate

149
00:09:05.789 --> 00:09:09.849
in Confucian political theory between two groups, the so-called

150
00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:15.570
Confucian political meritocrats and Confucian uh Democrats. So the

151
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:20.599
Confucian Democrats um are more inclined to a democratic

152
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.929
uh political uh future for East Asian society, so

153
00:09:24.929 --> 00:09:28.450
they think that if Confucianism has to evolve and

154
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.280
should be uh should evolve, then it has to

155
00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:34.229
um align and to find that we we have

156
00:09:34.229 --> 00:09:39.489
to rethink Confucianism in a more democratic way. Uh,

157
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:44.239
THE Confucian political meritocrats are partly also endorsing, uh,

158
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.320
democracy, but they are also think that, uh, uh,

159
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.119
democracy has to be connected with a second principle

160
00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:54.049
of governance, the idea of political meritocracy, and maybe

161
00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:57.440
we can talk about it later. Um, THE Western

162
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.159
political theory is a very rich debate, but here

163
00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:03.369
we also have two factions that are discussing about

164
00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:05.609
democracy at the moment. There are some that are

165
00:10:05.609 --> 00:10:08.770
quite skeptic about democracy. They are thinking that we

166
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.719
should, uh, uh, perhaps limit uh certain uh democratic

167
00:10:12.719 --> 00:10:17.270
elements in our. Current political systems and and these

168
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.619
are the so-called epistocrats, so they think that from

169
00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:24.669
an epistemic point of view, the quality of the

170
00:10:24.669 --> 00:10:29.770
uh political outcome of democracy on average is too

171
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.549
low and so we have to rethink democracy. Well,

172
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:37.429
the so-called epistemic democrats are defending democracy on the

173
00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:41.150
epistemic grounds, so they think that. Um, THERE are

174
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.429
good reasons to be disappointed with contemporary democratic, uh,

175
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.109
politics, and so they are not endorsing, uh, they

176
00:10:48.109 --> 00:10:52.270
are not defending, uh, uh, contemporary democratic system. They

177
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.710
are equally disappointed with them, but they think that

178
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.590
the issue has, is that they are not sufficiently

179
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:03.400
democratic, so they are defending a democratic model, um,

180
00:11:03.409 --> 00:11:05.510
in order to provide the kinds of new idea

181
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.489
for democratic innovations. So, uh, there was this synergy,

182
00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:13.609
this connection between these two different debates, and, uh,

183
00:11:13.619 --> 00:11:17.200
uh, the book tries to bring insights and ideas

184
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.700
into, uh, from these two different debates together in

185
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.380
order to generate a new theory of democracy.

186
00:11:25.349 --> 00:11:28.500
Mhm. And so let's get into some of the

187
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.380
shortcomings of democracy that you tackle in the book

188
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.619
and then the, some of the potential solutions to

189
00:11:34.619 --> 00:11:38.739
them. So, starting with political parties, what are some

190
00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:41.880
of the main shortcomings that some people have pointed

191
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.565
to when, when it comes to How political parties

192
00:11:44.565 --> 00:11:46.684
work in democratic systems.

193
00:11:46.984 --> 00:11:52.434
Yeah, so there is a um interesting discussion on

194
00:11:52.434 --> 00:11:55.294
the, the, the, the, the role and the shortcoming

195
00:11:55.294 --> 00:11:58.614
of political parties in democracy and also the shortcomings

196
00:11:58.614 --> 00:12:03.294
of this political agency primarily because political parties are

197
00:12:03.294 --> 00:12:07.400
a crucial agency in a democratic system. Um, IT'S

198
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.119
not their, their function is not well, uh, captured

199
00:12:10.119 --> 00:12:12.359
if you think of democracy as one person, one

200
00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:15.429
vote, but, uh, mm, consider the fact that, uh,

201
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.000
um, um, most of the time, uh, it's impossible

202
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.030
for political leaders to be elected without a sort,

203
00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:27.440
sort of political party that uh um give them

204
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.559
access to elections. So they play a kinds of

205
00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:34.150
important uh bridging role between uh uh citizens and

206
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.219
government. But there are important shortcomings, as you say.

207
00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:42.020
For example, the increasing influence of political leaders in

208
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:46.780
democratic politics that leads basically to the, the, the,

209
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.330
a much more limited power for political parties in

210
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.890
contemporary democratic society because if political leaders as they

211
00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:00.090
have done, have gained unprecedented influence and power in

212
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:04.570
democratic politics. That means that the political party is

213
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.369
subjected to the will and the wishes of the

214
00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:11.530
political leader because the political leader is basically calling

215
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.479
the shots is actually as much more influence on

216
00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:17.250
the political party because the very existence of the

217
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:21.710
political party depends on the political leader. Um, AND

218
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.169
that creates a problem for the, the political party

219
00:13:25.169 --> 00:13:27.909
because the, the space of maneuver, the, the, the

220
00:13:27.909 --> 00:13:30.830
influence of the political party is, uh, is less.

221
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:36.950
Um, THE second point that is discussed, uh, um,

222
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.330
quite, uh, um, uh, prominently I will say that

223
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.960
in academic debates is the, um, so-called idea of

224
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.400
the cri the crisis of the so-called traditional political

225
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:52.760
ideologies. Um, AND this I think it's much more

226
00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.200
relevant uh when it comes to uh political parties

227
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.390
on the left side of the political spectrum than

228
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.289
the right. Um, AND the discussion is the fact

229
00:14:04.289 --> 00:14:07.849
that it concerns the fact that, uh, most parties

230
00:14:07.849 --> 00:14:11.890
on the left, uh, um. HAVE lost appeal to

231
00:14:11.979 --> 00:14:15.099
uh many uh voters primarily because they don't have

232
00:14:15.099 --> 00:14:20.580
uh any more comprehensive and intriguing uh uh political

233
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:26.010
vision to sell to the voters. Um, Marxism, socialism.

234
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.479
Uh, THERE are still people who defend this, uh,

235
00:14:30.489 --> 00:14:33.520
these views, obviously, but most of the pope, uh,

236
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.750
most of the voters, uh, are, um, not, uh,

237
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.169
um, endorsing these uh political visions that had a

238
00:14:40.169 --> 00:14:44.780
huge influence decades ago. Um, AND so the question

239
00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.010
is, what is the, the appeal? What is the,

240
00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:50.859
the, the, the, the, the, how can, uh, political

241
00:14:50.859 --> 00:14:53.460
parties, especially on the left, uh, really reach out,

242
00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:59.739
uh, um, and motivate uh uh voters? Um, The

243
00:14:59.789 --> 00:15:03.340
third point I would say is the discussions about

244
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.070
the loss of a stable electoral base, and I

245
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.510
think it's connected to the two points I mentioned,

246
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:12.239
the political leaders and also the crisis of traditional

247
00:15:12.239 --> 00:15:17.070
political ideology. So now, as, as I think most

248
00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:21.669
of us have experienced, um. Elections have become much

249
00:15:21.669 --> 00:15:26.190
more dramatic because uh uh sometimes we are unable

250
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.869
to um make a correct hypothesis of where the

251
00:15:30.869 --> 00:15:34.549
votes will go. So we can see that the

252
00:15:34.549 --> 00:15:39.469
voters are much more inclined to, to change from

253
00:15:39.469 --> 00:15:42.070
left to right or the other way around than

254
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.719
before, and this maybe it's also because we don't

255
00:15:44.719 --> 00:15:48.469
have again strong traditional political ideologies that keep them

256
00:15:48.469 --> 00:15:51.369
on one side. But that means also that uh

257
00:15:51.369 --> 00:15:54.250
the um the electoral base is not as stable

258
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.090
as before and, and so that creates a lot

259
00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:01.929
of instability um and undermines indirectly also the uh

260
00:16:01.929 --> 00:16:04.349
the power and the influence of political parties.

261
00:16:05.349 --> 00:16:08.539
Mhm. And so, uh, earlier when I asked you

262
00:16:08.539 --> 00:16:12.159
about Confucian political theory and Western political theory, you

263
00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:16.270
mentioned meritocracy. So, could you tell us now what

264
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:21.380
political meritocracy is, particularly in the context of Confucian

265
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.270
political theory?

266
00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:27.119
Yes, sure. So, mm, me, what does, first we

267
00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:31.750
can start with the concept of meritocracy. Meritocracy is,

268
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.119
um, usually considered a, a distributive principles, especially in

269
00:16:36.119 --> 00:16:39.650
the Western, uh, tradition, right? It means that there

270
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.969
are certain kinds of goods. It can be, for

271
00:16:41.969 --> 00:16:46.929
example, job positions that have to be distributed to

272
00:16:46.929 --> 00:16:51.000
uh among multiple people, and we need a principle

273
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.210
that allows us to uh to distribute the certain

274
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:59.905
goals. So meritocracy is usually considered. One possible options

275
00:16:59.905 --> 00:17:02.854
to do. How do we distribute job positions? What

276
00:17:02.854 --> 00:17:07.604
is our criteria for example, individual skills or gender?

277
00:17:07.614 --> 00:17:11.255
What is it? Meritocracy says, well, it's the merit,

278
00:17:11.454 --> 00:17:15.614
so it's the uh um it's how, whether and

279
00:17:15.614 --> 00:17:21.699
how people deserve that good. Uh, POLITICAL meritocracy is,

280
00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:24.530
uh, you can consider it has the the application

281
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:30.030
of the meritocratic principle, uh, to, uh, politics, and

282
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.229
when I, I mean politics, uh, I mean the

283
00:17:33.229 --> 00:17:38.670
uh legislature positions, positions in the legislative uh uh

284
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.640
chamber or um uh branch of government. So political

285
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:50.469
meritocracy argues that distributions of political power should be

286
00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:54.280
done according to the merits, according to the qualities

287
00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.800
of the persons. So if we have people that

288
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.079
are more competent, for example, more politically knowledgeable than

289
00:18:03.079 --> 00:18:07.000
others, then maybe they should have more of that

290
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.280
kinds of good that we call political power. In

291
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.959
the Confucian debate, uh, um, political meritocracy, uh, is

292
00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:19.319
considered to be an extension of, uh, one of,

293
00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:21.959
uh, uh, or at least the, the, the defenders

294
00:18:21.959 --> 00:18:26.880
of Confucian political meritocracy, argue that, uh, um, political

295
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.729
meritocracy is an extension um of the Confucian idea

296
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.199
that uh a virtuous persons uh have to be

297
00:18:35.199 --> 00:18:39.069
um allowed, they have to be allowed to govern.

298
00:18:39.479 --> 00:18:44.339
So elevating the world is one key fundamental principle

299
00:18:44.339 --> 00:18:49.310
in Confucian political thought. And so the defenders of

300
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.969
political meritocracy see the idea of political meristocracy has

301
00:18:52.969 --> 00:18:58.290
a contemporary way of rethinking the the ancient Confucian

302
00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:02.390
idea of elevating the world. And so their approach

303
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.910
to political meritocracy is quite confusing. They say what

304
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:09.989
who is worth it of a superior political power?

305
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.069
Well, those first of all who are virtuous, so

306
00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:16.589
and this is a fundamental element in Confucian political

307
00:19:16.589 --> 00:19:19.989
thought. So it's not just about competence, political competence.

308
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.670
They also think it's also about character. It's about

309
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:27.069
virtue, so we need good people in government. But

310
00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:31.829
the way it's set up then upsets those who

311
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.839
defend the full democracy because obviously um political meritocracy

312
00:19:37.839 --> 00:19:41.150
ends up giving an unequal distribution of political power

313
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.790
and so that clashes with the very principle of

314
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.000
political equality, a fundamental principle in the democratic systems.

315
00:19:50.609 --> 00:19:53.229
But I, I mean, you mentioned virtues there are

316
00:19:53.229 --> 00:19:55.790
that a particular person has to be virtuous in

317
00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:59.030
order for, for them to hold political power, for

318
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:03.469
example, according to Confucianism, but what kinds of virtues

319
00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:04.989
are we talking about here?

320
00:20:05.699 --> 00:20:09.839
Yeah, uh, so in the, in the Confucian tradition,

321
00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:14.560
uh, there were multiple virtues that have been considered,

322
00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:19.319
um, fundamental for good government, and, but the, the,

323
00:20:19.329 --> 00:20:23.489
uh, the contemporary approaches to political meritocracy in, in

324
00:20:23.489 --> 00:20:28.209
my perspective emphasize the fundamental uh Confucian virtue of

325
00:20:28.209 --> 00:20:31.160
friend. Um, THEY may be not going to deter

326
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.630
to really defend the rand, but I think that

327
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.000
the essence of most of this theory is that

328
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.829
we need to find um political leaders that care

329
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.920
for the people, so uh that use their power

330
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.479
and influence for doing something that is good and

331
00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:51.160
maybe we discuss whether. They can know, so there

332
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.069
is a, a group of uh uh leaders that

333
00:20:54.069 --> 00:20:55.810
uh just know what is good for the people.

334
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.500
But the, the, the idea is that we need

335
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.760
some uh leaders that uh um what I argue

336
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.199
in the book that are public spirited. Um, SO

337
00:21:05.199 --> 00:21:08.349
that they, they are using their influence and empower,

338
00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:13.089
uh, to ensure that some collective project is realized

339
00:21:13.089 --> 00:21:15.920
is pursued, so they are not using. Their influence

340
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.459
and power to um improve the conditions of their

341
00:21:20.459 --> 00:21:23.589
family or their circle, for instance. So I think

342
00:21:23.589 --> 00:21:27.390
this also shows some connections to the, the uh

343
00:21:27.729 --> 00:21:30.680
tradition in Confucian political thought, but there is also

344
00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.239
a bit of an element of novelty. So it's

345
00:21:33.239 --> 00:21:37.599
a reconstruction of what virtue might mean today in

346
00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:39.839
uh when it comes to political leaders.

347
00:21:41.619 --> 00:21:44.619
So, uh, what do you think would be perhaps

348
00:21:44.619 --> 00:21:49.290
the main shortcomings of political meritocracy, particularly of the

349
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.849
Confucian kind because we have to have uh the

350
00:21:52.859 --> 00:21:56.489
the democratic element here. So what would you say

351
00:21:56.489 --> 00:21:59.359
are the shortcomings of this approach?

352
00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:06.369
Yeah, uh. There are usually 3 arguments that are

353
00:22:06.949 --> 00:22:13.300
proposed against the Confucian political meritocracy. My argument in

354
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.569
the book is that even if we assume a

355
00:22:17.099 --> 00:22:21.939
and that's how the book basically defends full democracy

356
00:22:21.939 --> 00:22:24.699
versus Confucian political meritocracy is that even if we

357
00:22:24.699 --> 00:22:28.130
assume an epistemic perspective, even if you assume. As

358
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.770
a uh Confucian political meritocrats that we need to

359
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:35.949
find a form of government that is able to

360
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:39.050
create something for the people, so, um, it's instrumentally

361
00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.520
valuable and so that's where our focus is. Uh,

362
00:22:42.619 --> 00:22:45.300
WE have a lot of discussion in the Western

363
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.020
debate that shows us that from an epistemic perspective,

364
00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.579
uh, uh, democratic open decision making system can perform

365
00:22:52.579 --> 00:22:55.819
better than a, a closer system. So a system

366
00:22:55.819 --> 00:23:00.579
that gives a, a, a superior political power only

367
00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:04.660
to a small group of virtuous people. So the,

368
00:23:04.699 --> 00:23:07.459
the argument that is offered in, in the book

369
00:23:07.459 --> 00:23:09.939
is that uh even if you care for the

370
00:23:09.939 --> 00:23:13.260
well-being of the people, then there are higher chances

371
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.140
perhaps that a democratic open system can allow us

372
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.579
to identify much better the problems and the solutions

373
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.369
to achieve that goal. But this is not, uh,

374
00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.640
I have to say it's not the only argument

375
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:31.050
on the table because Confucian Democrats before me have

376
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.530
offered other very interesting arguments. I just want to

377
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:40.170
mention uh 21, is the, uh, it's connected with

378
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:44.920
the idea of moral self-cultivation. Uh, SO in Confucianism.

379
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.040
Uh, MM, it's a very long, uh, it's a

380
00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:52.069
very ancient, and complex tradition, so probably we should

381
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.599
talk about Confucianisms rather than just one Confucianism. But

382
00:23:56.599 --> 00:24:00.119
uh there are key fundamental principles, uh, that the

383
00:24:00.119 --> 00:24:03.920
most Confucian scholars, um, agree with, and one of

384
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.880
these is that the ultimate aim of life is

385
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:11.890
uh uh moral self-cultivation. And the, the ultimate aim

386
00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:15.130
of government is also to allow people to achieve

387
00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:19.869
this moral self-cultivation. Um, SO there have been some

388
00:24:19.869 --> 00:24:24.209
confusion. Democrats like Toro and Stephen Engel that argued

389
00:24:24.209 --> 00:24:30.760
that ultimately uh democratic system, um, is more valuable

390
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.489
for achieving moral for allowing people to achieve moral

391
00:24:34.489 --> 00:24:40.050
self-cultivation than a a form of political meritocracy because

392
00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:43.609
in their opinion, political participation is a way through

393
00:24:43.609 --> 00:24:47.410
which we can uh improve as individual, as person.

394
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.189
We, uh, we are allowed to participate in political

395
00:24:51.189 --> 00:24:55.959
discussions and therefore to, uh, grow, um, um, intellectually

396
00:24:55.959 --> 00:25:01.369
and, uh, uh, possibly also morally. The second, uh,

397
00:25:01.489 --> 00:25:03.810
uh argument that has been already put on the

398
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:07.890
table by Sugmund Kim uh concern, um, the problem

399
00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:12.729
of pluralism. Uh, SO some, uh, uh, Confucian scholars

400
00:25:12.729 --> 00:25:15.280
are concerned with the fact that, uh, East Asia

401
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.380
have changed quite a bit significantly in the past

402
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.959
decades. So they, uh, and if, uh, if we

403
00:25:21.959 --> 00:25:26.079
consider South Korea, uh, uh, China, uh, for instance,

404
00:25:26.199 --> 00:25:30.525
they, they cannot be considered the, the confusion. Societies

405
00:25:30.525 --> 00:25:34.364
anymore. They are much more uh heterogenic um much

406
00:25:34.364 --> 00:25:37.685
more uh pluralistic than what we can see from

407
00:25:37.685 --> 00:25:41.244
outside, for example. Um, SO there is a uh

408
00:25:41.765 --> 00:25:45.484
even Confucian political theorist, uh Kim argues have to

409
00:25:45.484 --> 00:25:47.525
deal with the fact that, uh, uh, East Asia

410
00:25:47.525 --> 00:25:51.285
is, uh, um, societies are pluralistic and so we

411
00:25:51.285 --> 00:25:52.925
have to also to deal with the fact that

412
00:25:52.925 --> 00:25:56.285
uh, um, nobody knows better than other what is

413
00:25:56.285 --> 00:25:59.880
the. Uh, THE good, the, what is good for

414
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.439
the well-being of the people and perhaps. The final

415
00:26:04.439 --> 00:26:06.869
word has to be given to the people themselves,

416
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.920
uh, even in an East Asian context. So these

417
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.280
I think are the three major uh arguments that

418
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.479
have been discussed, uh, against the political meristocracy in

419
00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:21.780
the Confucian political theory debates.

420
00:26:22.239 --> 00:26:25.750
Mhm. So tell us then about your theory of

421
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:30.739
meritocratic democracy and when it comes to democracy itself,

422
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.790
what are perhaps the merits of it that you

423
00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.900
think are still worth defending?

424
00:26:36.839 --> 00:26:40.250
Yeah, uh, one merit I think, uh, is the,

425
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.359
uh, is that, as I mentioned before, um, there

426
00:26:44.359 --> 00:26:46.680
are good reasons to think that democracy does a

427
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.040
better job when it comes to pluralism than um

428
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.780
than a political meritocracy. And the second point that

429
00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.150
I make in the, in the book is about

430
00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:03.209
uh epistemic diversity. So I draw um from uh

431
00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:07.189
uh the rich discussions in Western democratic theory about

432
00:27:07.189 --> 00:27:11.900
epistemic democracy, um, to argue that an uh opening

433
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.500
the decision-making system to citizen participation can be actually

434
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:22.040
more instrumentally valuable than limiting uh political participation. Uh,

435
00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.699
THIS is what, this is because knowledge and understandings,

436
00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.849
uh, multiple forms of knowledge, sorry, and multiple formal

437
00:27:29.849 --> 00:27:32.770
understanding are needed to identify and solve, uh, uh,

438
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.979
political problems that are very complex, um in a

439
00:27:36.979 --> 00:27:41.719
contemporary democratic societies. And of course I think that

440
00:27:41.719 --> 00:27:48.079
if somebody's reading the news about uh about democracy

441
00:27:48.079 --> 00:27:51.150
in North America and in Europe that might sounds

442
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.560
not a very appealing argument to make nowadays. So

443
00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.329
there might be some skeptic of democracy that might

444
00:27:57.329 --> 00:28:00.400
smile and say, well, look at the situation, look

445
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.589
outside of your books around. How can you think

446
00:28:03.589 --> 00:28:09.849
that democracy is a superior epistemic value. But uh

447
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:15.160
I would I would invite um my critics to

448
00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.800
think how political discussion happen in democratic societies. So

449
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.040
most of the shortcomings and the issues that we

450
00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:28.150
identify. With political uh agendas, proposals or political uh

451
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:32.589
uh or or possible policies is actually through open

452
00:28:32.589 --> 00:28:37.219
discussions with the different, uh, even civic leaders, um,

453
00:28:37.479 --> 00:28:41.439
participating in the discussion, uh protest by uh uh

454
00:28:41.439 --> 00:28:44.959
by students. So there is much more, uh, shared

455
00:28:44.959 --> 00:28:48.959
uh um there is much more, I would say,

456
00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:53.670
uh, political knowledge dispersed around societies that are Yeah,

457
00:28:53.829 --> 00:28:55.949
come to the fore I would say, and that

458
00:28:55.949 --> 00:28:58.859
allows us to really understand what is going on

459
00:28:58.859 --> 00:29:01.430
and where, where are the problems and how we

460
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.310
can solve them. The second thing that I would

461
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:10.030
like to stress is that uh um You, you

462
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.229
can defend the, the epistemic value of democracy, but

463
00:29:13.229 --> 00:29:16.630
at the same time being very disappointed with real

464
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:22.109
world democratic institutions. Um, YOU can argue that these

465
00:29:22.109 --> 00:29:25.810
democratic institution uh fell short of achieving your aims.

466
00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:29.750
So the discussion is not whether, for example, defending

467
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.939
uh US democracy or not because we already have

468
00:29:32.939 --> 00:29:37.089
since one decade. Um, POLITICAL scientists telling that uh

469
00:29:37.089 --> 00:29:39.880
the US for instance is transiting more towards an

470
00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.280
oligarchy than a democracy and actually some scientists say

471
00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.469
that the US is an oligarchy. So the, uh,

472
00:29:46.479 --> 00:29:50.439
the, uh, I think that we should, yeah, consider

473
00:29:50.439 --> 00:29:55.000
that there are philosophical defense of democracy and that

474
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.699
um that are not necessarily connected to defenses of

475
00:29:59.699 --> 00:30:02.959
uh real world democratic institutions, but they are more

476
00:30:02.959 --> 00:30:07.520
interested in finding. Um, DEMOCRATIC, uh, solutions to, uh,

477
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:10.839
to improve, uh, real, uh, world democratic institutions.

478
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.650
Mhm. And I mean, when it comes to political

479
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.810
leaders, what are the functions of political leaders in

480
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:22.209
democratic systems and do you think that democratic theorists

481
00:30:22.209 --> 00:30:25.000
should reframe the way we think about them and

482
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.239
their role in the political system?

483
00:30:28.439 --> 00:30:34.689
Yeah, so the, the, the book argues that we,

484
00:30:34.959 --> 00:30:37.640
we need full democracy, but at the same time

485
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.819
it would be stupid on my side to say

486
00:30:40.819 --> 00:30:44.040
that everything looks good, so we need to also

487
00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.750
consider and think hard to understand how we can

488
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:53.219
improve democracy. And the Confucian approach, the Confucian perspective

489
00:30:53.219 --> 00:30:58.030
is used to point to one gap in contemporary

490
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:01.979
Western democratic theory about the function of political leaders

491
00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:05.709
in a democracy. So it's quite surprising that in

492
00:31:05.709 --> 00:31:11.630
my opinion that contemporary democratic societies are dominated by

493
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:16.439
political leaders. I think and that this is quite

494
00:31:16.439 --> 00:31:18.689
obvious if you think that how much do we

495
00:31:18.689 --> 00:31:22.489
know about democratic societies around the world we are

496
00:31:22.489 --> 00:31:27.849
perfectly able to name the main political leaders in

497
00:31:27.849 --> 00:31:30.160
India, in Argentina, and so on and so forth,

498
00:31:30.209 --> 00:31:32.089
but we don't know the name of their political

499
00:31:32.089 --> 00:31:35.729
parties, so it's really leader-centered democracy that we are

500
00:31:36.089 --> 00:31:39.270
experiencing around the world. But that means also that

501
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:43.459
we need a political theory that deals with this

502
00:31:43.459 --> 00:31:48.260
problem. So this, the uh the um uh significant

503
00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:54.670
um power that political leaders have um achieved um

504
00:31:54.670 --> 00:32:00.079
in contemporary democratic societies. And Confucianism traditionally had paid

505
00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:03.750
a lot of attention about the role of political

506
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:07.349
leaders in politics. So this is the connection that

507
00:32:07.349 --> 00:32:10.439
the books makes between Western democratic theory and the

508
00:32:10.439 --> 00:32:14.750
Confucian political theories that uh there is so much

509
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:17.869
that we can, so much we can learn um

510
00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:21.229
uh from uh Confucian political theory when it comes

511
00:32:21.229 --> 00:32:25.869
to political leaders and so the, the, um, and,

512
00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:29.790
and that can be actually very beneficial for those

513
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.969
working on democracy in Western political theory. And in

514
00:32:32.969 --> 00:32:38.239
the book, I make uh two identify three fundamental

515
00:32:38.849 --> 00:32:43.839
functions of political leaders in democracy. So, um, first,

516
00:32:43.849 --> 00:32:47.010
I argue that uh um even from an epistemic

517
00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:51.930
perspective, um, uh, political leaders play a key fundamental

518
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:55.689
role in a democratic system. First, they are a

519
00:32:55.689 --> 00:32:59.459
motivational force. So some people argue that uh the

520
00:32:59.459 --> 00:33:03.699
average voter uh is uh um is not so

521
00:33:03.699 --> 00:33:07.859
much interested in politics um but actually this is

522
00:33:07.859 --> 00:33:11.540
not true because the political leaders has, has, I

523
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.619
think, uh, recent elections in In the uh in

524
00:33:14.619 --> 00:33:17.390
the US have shown are able to mobilize uh

525
00:33:18.859 --> 00:33:22.699
different kinds of voters, so they play a motivational

526
00:33:22.699 --> 00:33:24.770
function that can be good, it can be worst,

527
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.979
uh, it can be and can be bad, I

528
00:33:26.979 --> 00:33:29.660
would say, but it, it, we have to accept

529
00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.010
that this is also a very important element for

530
00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:36.300
a democratic system that is based on public participation.

531
00:33:36.579 --> 00:33:40.410
So political leaders are able to inspire. Uh, THEIR

532
00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:43.530
followers and also bring maybe to the to to

533
00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:45.800
votes and to protest those who disagree with them.

534
00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:48.050
So are a very key engine when it comes

535
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:52.839
to political motivation. The second element is that they

536
00:33:52.839 --> 00:33:59.449
are um uh. Also important when it comes to

537
00:33:59.449 --> 00:34:05.250
political imagination. They are able to develop political visions

538
00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:08.320
and because they are also most of the time

539
00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.438
successful political leaders also extremely charismatic, they are able

540
00:34:12.438 --> 00:34:17.530
to mobilize first function people behind their uh their

541
00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:21.489
political vision. It can be bad and worse. Good

542
00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:26.360
example, Nelson Mandela, for example. Um, THE third point

543
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:31.770
is uh is about political leaders that occupy. Uh,

544
00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:36.530
SPECIFIC, uh, um, official positions in, uh, democratic institutions.

545
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:41.429
Um, THE political leaders, uh, have the possibility to,

546
00:34:41.438 --> 00:34:44.780
um, to choose what kinds of expert opinion has

547
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:51.090
to be prioritized, um, when, uh, experts disagree. And

548
00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.090
this is something that we saw, uh, I think

549
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.739
in multiple parts of the world uh during COVID,

550
00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:01.649
where scientists and experts really had the, uh, strong

551
00:35:01.649 --> 00:35:04.129
disagreements on what was the right thing to do

552
00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:07.649
concerning uh social distances and masks and wearing of

553
00:35:07.649 --> 00:35:10.780
mask. So we, we could see really that the

554
00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:16.820
political leaders chose to prefer 11 options uh among

555
00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.699
all those that were offered by the experts and

556
00:35:19.699 --> 00:35:23.939
that led to very different kinds of consequences implications

557
00:35:23.939 --> 00:35:27.469
around the world. So, uh, even this uh third

558
00:35:27.469 --> 00:35:30.899
function, especially when it comes to emergency situation, is

559
00:35:30.899 --> 00:35:35.610
fundamental in political leaders. Um, SO the book identifies

560
00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:39.639
three fundamental functions that the, that political leaders, uh,

561
00:35:39.649 --> 00:35:43.290
play in democracy and then reflects on how we

562
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:47.969
can ensure that political leaders, uh, use these functions

563
00:35:47.969 --> 00:35:50.760
well, so that you, uh, that, uh, use this,

564
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:54.300
uh, that uh play these roles uh to ensure

565
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.340
a better democratic society rather than make it worse.

566
00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.459
OK, and how would that work? How can we

567
00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:04.540
ensure the quality of our political leaders and that

568
00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:08.840
they really do work toward those goals and toward

569
00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.510
democratic goals more generally? Yeah,

570
00:36:12.419 --> 00:36:15.659
so here, again, I, I think uh at the

571
00:36:15.659 --> 00:36:19.050
uh Confucian traditions and the debates that uh my,

572
00:36:19.139 --> 00:36:22.179
my colleague in the con in working in Confucian

573
00:36:22.179 --> 00:36:25.790
political theory are having at the moment. Um, I

574
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:28.429
go back to the fundamental idea that I mentioned

575
00:36:28.429 --> 00:36:33.250
before, so, uh, that, that, uh, mm. In the

576
00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:37.919
in the Confucian tradition, uh, the fundamental virtue for

577
00:36:37.919 --> 00:36:42.280
good leaders is called Ren, often translated as benevolence

578
00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:46.510
or humanities, is the, um, is the virtue of

579
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:49.560
that is the ability to care for others, for

580
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:53.520
the ability to care for others self moral self-cultivation.

581
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.969
And in the, in the book, I argue that

582
00:36:56.969 --> 00:37:00.929
this is a very important leader virtue in Confucianism,

583
00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:04.570
but it might be too, too thick for contemporary

584
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:09.860
pluralistic society because not all citizens agree that the

585
00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.770
Confucian moral self-cultivation path is the right one. So

586
00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:16.600
I say, well, this doesn't mean that we have

587
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.889
to discard completely the Confucian lesson, but there must,

588
00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.919
there can be something interesting. So why Confucian scholars

589
00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:28.250
believe that people with RAND are worth occupy, should

590
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:33.030
occupy leadership positions. And the answer to this question

591
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:36.120
in my book is twofold. On one hand, I

592
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:40.320
think that a Confucian scholar believes that a person

593
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:45.560
with RAND is a person that wants to direct

594
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:50.760
that use their influence and power to realize a

595
00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.409
collective project. And the second part of the answer

596
00:37:54.409 --> 00:37:57.290
is that among all the collective projects, the Confucians

597
00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.330
might choose a Confucian project. Uh, SO the moral

598
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:04.850
self-cultivation of the people has the Confucian, uh, think

599
00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:08.120
self-cultivation. So the book say, well, the second part

600
00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.770
of the answer, the Confucian answer is problematic. But

601
00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:15.090
the first one is not, so it would be

602
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:18.449
very difficult, even a polarized democratic society to find

603
00:38:18.449 --> 00:38:22.399
somebody that says no political leaders shouldn't pursue a

604
00:38:22.399 --> 00:38:25.360
collective project. They should use their power and influence

605
00:38:25.929 --> 00:38:29.639
for their own family and circles. So I say,

606
00:38:29.649 --> 00:38:32.370
Well, maybe then RAND is too thick, but the

607
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:34.610
first part is connected to the idea of public

608
00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:38.489
spiritedness. So we need and public spirit seems to

609
00:38:38.489 --> 00:38:41.729
be a neutral virtue. So whether you are leaning

610
00:38:41.729 --> 00:38:46.330
on the left or right side of the political

611
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:50.739
spectrum, we both, we all want to have public

612
00:38:50.739 --> 00:38:54.300
spirited leaders. We just disagree on who public, who

613
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:58.689
is public spirited. Yeah. So short example, I think

614
00:38:58.689 --> 00:39:01.610
there is, for example, a very controversial political leader,

615
00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:04.919
Donald Trump. I, I think that the, the, the

616
00:39:04.919 --> 00:39:08.080
supporter of Donald Trump believes that he's one of

617
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.320
the few public-spirited uh leaders. So, and obviously the,

618
00:39:12.399 --> 00:39:15.629
the, the critics think otherwise, but that means that

619
00:39:15.629 --> 00:39:17.879
we agree at the very least that we need

620
00:39:17.879 --> 00:39:22.739
public-spirited leaders. Uh, THERE, this huge disagreement who is

621
00:39:22.739 --> 00:39:25.889
and whether Donald Trump is public spirited. But so

622
00:39:25.889 --> 00:39:29.739
pub uh, public spirit becomes the basically foundation, uh,

623
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:34.830
fundamental virtue, uh, to reconceptualize a good political leaders,

624
00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:37.540
leadership for a contemporary society.

625
00:39:39.449 --> 00:39:41.310
And uh I mean in the book you also

626
00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:46.199
talk about meritocratic screening. So what, what would, what

627
00:39:46.199 --> 00:39:49.110
would that be and how would they work

628
00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:53.510
exactly? Yeah. So, if, if you agree with the

629
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:56.870
idea that we need political leaders that are public

630
00:39:56.870 --> 00:40:01.070
spirited, and this is a basic fundamental virtue for

631
00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:04.820
any sorts of political leaders in, in uh uh

632
00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.320
that has to enter politics. And then the question

633
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.520
is how do you make it possible, so how

634
00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:15.629
can we ensure that you have a More public

635
00:40:15.629 --> 00:40:18.590
spirited leaders than before, or at least how can

636
00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.270
we ensure that we can really avoid it not

637
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:25.590
very public spirited uh or the bad toxic political

638
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:30.030
leaders and so the book engages with this more

639
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:33.590
practical question because I thought that without trying to

640
00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:36.370
attempt to answer it's a very difficult question, but

641
00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:38.080
I thought I should give it a try. I

642
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.149
should try at least to propose one option and

643
00:40:41.149 --> 00:40:43.770
hopefully. The debate will pick it up and we

644
00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:48.479
can find a solution together. But um, so the,

645
00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:51.729
the, the idea of screening comes from the bit

646
00:40:51.729 --> 00:40:54.610
of public spirited how we can ensure more public

647
00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:57.129
spirited leaders and also to the idea that we

648
00:40:57.129 --> 00:41:02.840
can rethink political meritocracy. So political meritocracy is criticized

649
00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.050
in the first part of the book has a

650
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:10.159
kind of a principle of governance versus democracy. But

651
00:41:10.159 --> 00:41:13.239
um this doesn't mean that we cannot rethink political

652
00:41:13.239 --> 00:41:15.879
meritocracy, so the very idea that we need to

653
00:41:15.879 --> 00:41:19.679
select uh virtuous political leaders in a way that

654
00:41:19.679 --> 00:41:24.280
uh um uh strengthen democracy. So the, mm, so

655
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:29.159
I rethink the idea of uh um mm political

656
00:41:29.159 --> 00:41:32.479
leaders selection in a way that can be uh

657
00:41:32.479 --> 00:41:36.310
used uh and implemented in a democratic uh decision

658
00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:40.620
uh making system. And this is how I come,

659
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.540
uh, I came up with the idea of a

660
00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.870
pre-selection of political leaders. um, SO we can think

661
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:51.830
of ensuring more public spirited leader at the, uh,

662
00:41:51.919 --> 00:41:55.600
by developing a pre-selection of political leaders at the

663
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.899
party level. Um, IF you think of, uh, uh,

664
00:41:58.909 --> 00:42:02.510
the selection of political leaders in contemporary democracies, yes,

665
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.620
you have, uh, uh, the national level elections, um,

666
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:09.639
but these political leaders are put forward by, uh,

667
00:42:09.649 --> 00:42:13.209
political parties and at political parties level you have

668
00:42:13.209 --> 00:42:16.459
most of the time primaries, uh, uh, or, uh,

669
00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:21.510
so internal decision, uh, mm uh internal selection system,

670
00:42:21.629 --> 00:42:26.810
sorry. But what if you uh include the meritocratic

671
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:30.889
screenings of political leaders even before the primaries start?

672
00:42:31.489 --> 00:42:34.879
So I mean, who selects who chooses the political

673
00:42:34.879 --> 00:42:38.719
leaders that are going to run in the primaries.

674
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.239
Most of the time are the political party leads.

675
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.830
ARE not the partisans. Um, AND the partisans have

676
00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.669
a say in the primaries. There are a lot

677
00:42:48.669 --> 00:42:51.750
of also academics at the moment that are thinking

678
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:53.989
that primaries are not enough. We, we need more

679
00:42:53.989 --> 00:42:58.179
deliberative uh decision process inside the parties and I'm

680
00:42:58.179 --> 00:43:00.949
uh supporting that in the book. But I say,

681
00:43:00.959 --> 00:43:03.860
hey, maybe we can also include that that uh

682
00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:07.350
before primary start, before the liberation starts in the

683
00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:11.879
political parties, a meritocratic screening that ensures that uh

684
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.919
A check, uh, a check on the uh public

685
00:43:15.919 --> 00:43:18.989
spirits of the political leaders, and you don't have

686
00:43:18.989 --> 00:43:22.040
to do it, uh, uh, through exams so for

687
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:26.800
example, or recommendation system has a Confucian political meritocrats

688
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.199
have proposed when it comes to their models, but

689
00:43:29.449 --> 00:43:31.979
you can think of, uh, uh, for example, setting

690
00:43:31.979 --> 00:43:35.320
up, setting up the, the argument argues, the book

691
00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.610
argues that um uh party juries. So you can

692
00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:42.699
select the, uh, you can create a party juries

693
00:43:42.699 --> 00:43:47.780
within the political parties that have the um um

694
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:52.129
objective of uh um check the public spiritedness, uh

695
00:43:52.179 --> 00:43:55.340
uh the quality or the public spiritedness of the

696
00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.219
political leaders that wants to run, uh, in the

697
00:43:58.219 --> 00:44:01.570
primaries. And so, uh, in this way, I think

698
00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:05.290
uh you have an interesting way of combining meritocracy,

699
00:44:05.699 --> 00:44:09.389
um, within a democratic uh system. And hence the

700
00:44:09.389 --> 00:44:11.909
title uh meritocratic democracy.

701
00:44:13.169 --> 00:44:16.090
Right, but I mean, in practice, of course, we've

702
00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.810
already talked a little bit about that here, but

703
00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:23.209
what would characterize meritocratic democracy and how would it

704
00:44:23.209 --> 00:44:25.409
work? Uh, I mean, what are the main ways

705
00:44:25.409 --> 00:44:28.300
by which, for example, just for people to, to

706
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.919
gather better understanding of how it would work? What

707
00:44:31.919 --> 00:44:34.159
are the main ways by which it would differ

708
00:44:34.159 --> 00:44:37.050
from current democratic systems?

709
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:40.159
Yeah, I think the, the main way that I

710
00:44:40.159 --> 00:44:43.280
propose in the book is what um what we're

711
00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:48.800
just mentioning is a meritocratic preselection system of political

712
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.429
leaders at the party level. I think this would

713
00:44:51.429 --> 00:44:56.320
be the key element to have some meritocracy, meritocracy

714
00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:03.360
injected in democracy well without limiting uh political equality.

715
00:45:03.959 --> 00:45:06.639
So this, uh, and that, that's why I, uh,

716
00:45:06.679 --> 00:45:09.760
the book is a form of meritocratic democracy, but

717
00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.479
not a form of uh democratic meritocracy. And this

718
00:45:13.479 --> 00:45:16.479
was the definition that Daniel Bell gave uh to

719
00:45:16.479 --> 00:45:19.000
his uh uh very important and famous book, the

720
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
China Model. Uh, SO he, he argues that it's

721
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.159
a democratic meritocracy, um. Well, uh, in, in practice,

722
00:45:27.199 --> 00:45:30.389
I think that we have a meritocratic democracy when

723
00:45:30.389 --> 00:45:35.310
uh um meritocracy has a political merito meritocrats argue

724
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.790
is used uh uh to uh influence uh the,

725
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.520
the, the, the, the, the, the, the results of

726
00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.889
who is gonna be the future leaders, political leaders,

727
00:45:44.959 --> 00:45:47.399
but at the same time it does that without

728
00:45:47.399 --> 00:45:52.229
undermining political equality, without undermining democratic institutions. So I

729
00:45:52.229 --> 00:45:55.719
think the advantage is to use uh that meritocratic

730
00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:59.129
democracy has is that it, it, it rethinks uh

731
00:45:59.129 --> 00:46:02.469
political meritocracy in a way that it can strengthen

732
00:46:02.469 --> 00:46:06.360
or it aims to strengthen, uh democracy. Of course,

733
00:46:06.399 --> 00:46:10.350
this is, uh, becomes uh a Mm, my proposal

734
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:14.020
is, uh, is a practical proposal and, uh, uh,

735
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:16.709
has, uh, and I'm, I'm I'm a philosopher, so

736
00:46:16.709 --> 00:46:18.989
I'm going a little bit beyond my comfort zone,

737
00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:22.899
but, uh, in the book, I invite political scientists

738
00:46:22.899 --> 00:46:25.590
to, uh, to tell us more whether this can

739
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:28.629
work, whether it can be tested primarily because the

740
00:46:28.629 --> 00:46:31.620
book is a philosophy book, so it does, uh,

741
00:46:31.629 --> 00:46:36.300
the, the job of, uh, of justify, justifying. Uh,

742
00:46:36.399 --> 00:46:40.199
THIS proposal from a philosophical perspective, but if it's

743
00:46:40.199 --> 00:46:43.760
uh philosophically sound, that means that we need also

744
00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.790
more, uh, testing, more empirical analysis that help us

745
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:51.000
to understand how this proposal can be put into

746
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.260
place and how and what under what condition can

747
00:46:54.479 --> 00:46:55.469
work or not.

748
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:59.340
Mhm. So, I have one final question then, and

749
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.100
it is more of a general question. So, of

750
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.379
course, as we talked about here in the book,

751
00:47:04.459 --> 00:47:07.929
you bring together two different poli uh two different

752
00:47:07.929 --> 00:47:11.989
traditions in political theory, namely Western political theory and

753
00:47:11.989 --> 00:47:16.010
Confucian political theory or East Asian political theory. So,

754
00:47:16.139 --> 00:47:18.580
how do you look at the value of cross

755
00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:21.060
cultural political debates?

756
00:47:21.739 --> 00:47:25.370
Yeah, I, I think the value is, uh, is,

757
00:47:25.379 --> 00:47:29.060
uh, um, is immense. It, it has a great

758
00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:33.699
value and I think, um, it would be very

759
00:47:33.699 --> 00:47:38.850
difficult to reflect on politics uh without it. So

760
00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:43.090
I think cross-cultural debates and engagement that need to

761
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:46.850
be more um in order to understand that this

762
00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:50.770
global and complex uh world. So, um, my hope

763
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:54.280
is uh also to, to give an example on

764
00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:58.050
how cross-cultural debates can also go beyond the methodological

765
00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:02.370
discussions and also To give an example of a

766
00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:05.729
cross-cultural theory. So not a theory of, uh, a

767
00:48:05.729 --> 00:48:10.209
cross-cultural methodology, but a cross-cultural, uh, political theory, so

768
00:48:10.209 --> 00:48:12.800
that uh um we can see more of these

769
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.610
uh kinds of uh uh hybrid theories um in

770
00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:19.489
the, in the, in the debate. And I think

771
00:48:19.489 --> 00:48:23.129
that, that's quite a um. That would be great

772
00:48:23.129 --> 00:48:25.060
to see because at the moment I think there

773
00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:29.760
is much more uh Awareness of uh the importance

774
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.709
of cross-cultural debates. There are a lot of discussions,

775
00:48:32.719 --> 00:48:35.909
uh um in academia, for example, or how we

776
00:48:35.909 --> 00:48:39.070
uh to decolonize our curriculum and how we can

777
00:48:39.439 --> 00:48:43.399
um make academia, um, especially the humanities uh uh

778
00:48:43.399 --> 00:48:47.159
less Western-centric. Um, SO I think there is a

779
00:48:47.159 --> 00:48:51.510
um a, a large group of academics that uh

780
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.139
wants uh things to change. Um, WE are still

781
00:48:55.139 --> 00:49:00.770
discussing, uh, in, uh, in, in philosophy department how

782
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:03.810
this can be done. Uh, SO academia is a

783
00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:08.020
bit of a conservative, uh, um, space, and so

784
00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.689
it takes a lot, a little bit of time

785
00:49:09.689 --> 00:49:12.320
for things to change, but I think there is

786
00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:16.129
uh. Um, THERE are many people who are looking

787
00:49:16.129 --> 00:49:19.199
around and think, OK, what, how we can change

788
00:49:19.199 --> 00:49:23.050
things, and especially students are, I would say most

789
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:26.489
of the time behind uh these uh these reasons

790
00:49:26.489 --> 00:49:28.959
to change so that we have students that are

791
00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:34.409
much more open to cross-cultural debates, um, and so

792
00:49:34.409 --> 00:49:37.850
that I think, um, I hope that uh this

793
00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:40.489
book will resonate with some of the interest of

794
00:49:40.489 --> 00:49:41.610
some of, some of them.

795
00:49:42.939 --> 00:49:46.550
Great. So the book is again meritocratic democracy Across

796
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.550
Cultural Political Theory, and of course, I'm leaving a

797
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:51.820
link to it in the description of the interview.

798
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:55.340
And Doctor Resiliotti, just before we go, apart from

799
00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.949
the book, uh, would you like to mention any

800
00:49:57.949 --> 00:50:00.669
places on the internet where people can find your

801
00:50:00.669 --> 00:50:01.060
work?

802
00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:07.409
Yeah, um, I have a website, um, Elenazilioti.com, and,

803
00:50:07.489 --> 00:50:11.330
uh, and there, uh, I try to keep it

804
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:15.770
updated with all my new publications and the news

805
00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:19.139
about conferences and talks, so that I think that

806
00:50:19.139 --> 00:50:21.409
would be a good place to go if you're

807
00:50:21.409 --> 00:50:23.810
interested in hearing more about this.

808
00:50:24.969 --> 00:50:27.899
