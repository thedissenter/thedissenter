00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.299
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:06.280
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.920
today I'm joined by Dr. Aubrey de Grey. He's

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.479
a biomedical gerontologist, and today we're going to talk

5
00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.959
about the science of aging and longevity. So Doctor

6
00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:18.840
De Grey, welcome to the show. It's a huge

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.469
pleasure to everyone. Well,

8
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.299
thank you for having me.

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.979
So let me start by asking you first, what

10
00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:29.590
got you interested in the topic of aging and

11
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.909
in approaching it scientifically?

12
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.229
The main thing that got me interested when I

13
00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:40.430
was in my late twenties was uh the discovery

14
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.310
that hardly, hardly anybody else was interested. This was

15
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.330
something that I had never considered until that time.

16
00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:50.650
I had always known and that it was obvious

17
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.509
to me that aging is the world's most important

18
00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:58.250
problem and that it could in principle, be overcome

19
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.020
medically. Um, BUT it was so obvious to me

20
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.540
that I never discussed it with anybody and therefore

21
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.739
I never discovered that other people thought differently. Until

22
00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:13.809
I met and married a biologist who accidentally taught

23
00:01:13.809 --> 00:01:15.480
me a lot of biology over the dinner table,

24
00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:18.769
but who also eventually, you know, I began to

25
00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:20.510
realize she wasn't interested in aging, and I thought

26
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.470
that's crazy. Um, AND eventually I I found out

27
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.239
that. Almost all the other people I was meeting

28
00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:29.139
had the same view, so I decided to stop

29
00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:31.400
doing what I had been doing for the previous

30
00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:34.980
decade or so, which was working in computer science

31
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.459
and artificial intelligence, and to switch fields and become

32
00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:39.900
a biologist working on aging.

33
00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:44.569
And what is aging? I mean, how do you

34
00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.930
define it and how do you approach it from

35
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.809
a scientific perspective? Yeah,

36
00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:52.160
aging can be defined very simply, but not too

37
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.610
simply. Some people try to define it as a

38
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.930
process that as some kind of unitary process that

39
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.410
just like happens. Um, THE right way to describe

40
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.209
it is the combination of two processes. Um, THE

41
00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.970
first process goes on throughout life, even starting before

42
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.669
we're born. And it is a process of creation

43
00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:17.949
of damage in the body. So essentially, the body,

44
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.350
of course, is a very, very complicated machine that

45
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.270
has many, many processes going on all the time

46
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.830
to keep us alive from one day to the

47
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.350
next, and that network creates changes to the molecular

48
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.910
and cellular composition and structure of the body, and

49
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.509
those changes, the critical thing is that those changes

50
00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:41.110
accumulate over time. Which is fine for a long

51
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.990
time because the body is built to um to

52
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.550
tolerate a certain amount of those changes without a

53
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.860
significant decline in function. But eventually there's more of

54
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.470
the more of the changes than that, and that's

55
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.119
why it makes sense to call those changes damage.

56
00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:01.820
Because eventually when you've got too much, the second

57
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.649
process kicks off, and that is the process where

58
00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:08.570
the damage creates the decline in function, both mental

59
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.669
function and physical function, the pathologies of late life.

60
00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.759
So that's all that aging is. Our metabolism creates

61
00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.809
damage throughout life and eventually the damage starts to

62
00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:21.210
create pathologies, and that eventually kills us.

63
00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:25.059
Yes, and I'm going to ask you also about

64
00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:28.860
the 7 deadly things or the 7 different types

65
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.100
of damage behind aging in a second, but before

66
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.380
that, why do we age? What are the evolutionary

67
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.779
origins of aging?

68
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.419
People got this wrong for a long time. Uh,

69
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.020
PEOPLE, when, when they started thinking about this, not

70
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.600
long after Darwin, they started to think, well, OK,

71
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.960
aging must exist for some kind of evolutionary reason.

72
00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:56.779
Um, YOU know, there must be some advantage to

73
00:03:56.779 --> 00:04:00.220
the species, even though there is clearly a disadvantage

74
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.240
to the individual. Um, BUT eventually in the middle

75
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.759
of the 20th century, people realized that that wasn't

76
00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.639
correct. And, uh, one of my friends put it

77
00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.490
very, very well, a long time ago. He said,

78
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.320
evolution is not a product of evolutionary intent, it

79
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.760
is a product of evolutionary neglect. In other words,

80
00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:23.760
it's not that evolution wants us to age, it's

81
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.390
just that. Evolution is pretty much ambivalent about it.

82
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.470
It doesn't want us to age, but it only

83
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.589
slightly doesn't want us to, so it hasn't taken

84
00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:35.950
the trouble to develop machinery to make us not

85
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.369
age.

86
00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:41.299
How is biological age calculated?

87
00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:46.660
Oh, so that's actually a really controversial, um, situation

88
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.640
right now. A lot of experts would say that

89
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.640
in fact, we shouldn't be using the term biological

90
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.230
age at all because aging is, you know, a

91
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.959
lot of different types of damage accumulating through different

92
00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:05.359
mechanisms at different rates and therefore an individual's biological

93
00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:09.000
age should not be expressed as one number. Um,

94
00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.989
BUT of course in theory one could regard it

95
00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:15.549
as one number if one had complete information. One

96
00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:20.540
could say, well, It is somehow the um the

97
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.559
risk that one has of developing chronic conditions within

98
00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.339
the next year, or one could define it in

99
00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:33.640
terms of how long it's likely to be in

100
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.459
the context of current medicine before one starts to

101
00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:40.420
exhibit chronic conditions of late life. Those kinds of

102
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.260
things. In terms of measuring it though, the technologies

103
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.959
that we have really are not up to it.

104
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.700
There are old fashioned ways to do it in

105
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.820
terms of basically function, you know, you measure how

106
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.859
strong somebody is, how good their memory is, things

107
00:05:53.859 --> 00:05:57.399
like that, and those are pretty good. And then

108
00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.839
there are measures that are based on omics, so

109
00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:04.380
looking at the epigenetics of the blood, for example,

110
00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:07.040
and me and and getting correlations from that, things

111
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.459
that change with age. Um, AND they're getting better.

112
00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:14.679
At the moment, the single best measure of biological

113
00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:17.640
age, if you insist on having one, is actually

114
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.959
still, uh, you know, sophisticated analysis of these functional

115
00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:25.519
measures that I just mentioned. Um, THERE'S a clock

116
00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:28.160
that's, um, there's a measure of biological age that's

117
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.239
been recently developed by a group in Singapore that

118
00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:35.350
I think is, you know, pretty clearly outperforming everything

119
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.079
else right now.

120
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.500
Tell us about this concept of longevity escape velocity.

121
00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:43.640
What is that?

122
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.859
OK, so that's a term that I coined about

123
00:06:45.859 --> 00:06:49.109
20 odd years ago now, and it's quite simple.

124
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.940
The way in which we are going to bring

125
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.480
aging under medical control is going to be through

126
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.859
damage repair, not through slowing down the rate at

127
00:06:59.859 --> 00:07:05.899
which damage, um. Is generated and also not through

128
00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:10.769
making the body capable of withstanding more damage. Rather,

129
00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:14.140
it's by removing damage every so often so that

130
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.619
even though it's being generated in the at the

131
00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:20.140
natural rate, it never reaches the amount that the

132
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.309
body is unable to tolerate. And in that in

133
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:28.839
that scenario, um, you know, you are basically turning

134
00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:31.309
back the clock, you're effectively reversing aging every so

135
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:36.760
often. So if we have a uh a a

136
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.799
portfolio, a panel of interventions of medicines that repair

137
00:07:40.799 --> 00:07:42.959
a lot of the different types of damage in

138
00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:45.910
the body, then we can keep someone healthy for

139
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:51.010
longer and alive for longer. However, What we have

140
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.320
to consider is the fact that some types of

141
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.299
damage are a lot easier to repair than others.

142
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.559
And the particularly difficult ones will still be accumulating

143
00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:04.700
until we get ways to repair them, even if

144
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.970
we can repair the other ones. So, um, essentially

145
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.410
what I have put forward is that once we

146
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:17.640
have a panel of interventions that is fairly comprehensive,

147
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.079
that can give us perhaps 20 additional years of

148
00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:25.649
extra life, then we will functionally be done. We

149
00:08:25.649 --> 00:08:27.690
will have essentially done all we need to do,

150
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.929
because in those 20 years, we will be able

151
00:08:31.929 --> 00:08:35.669
to develop. Repair strategies for some of the really

152
00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.508
difficult damage so that we can give the same

153
00:08:38.508 --> 00:08:42.320
people another 20 years, and so on. So basically

154
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.190
I defined this term longevity escape velocity as the

155
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:51.479
minimum rate at which scientists will have to improve

156
00:08:51.479 --> 00:08:55.679
these interventions, the comprehensiveness of them, in order to

157
00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:58.059
stay one step ahead of the problem, such that

158
00:08:58.359 --> 00:09:01.390
people who are receiving state of the art medicines

159
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:05.039
at any time will not get biologically older.

160
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.109
Tell us now about the 7 different types of

161
00:09:10.109 --> 00:09:15.469
damage behind aging, including cell loss and cell atrophy,

162
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:21.630
division, obsessed cells, death resistant cells, mitochondrial mutations, intracellular

163
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:28.669
waste products, extracellular waste products. And extracellular matrix stiffening.

164
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.429
Tell us about each of them.

165
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.010
So these are the seven categories of damage that

166
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.450
I put forward again more than 20 years ago

167
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.349
now, and I'm very pleased to say that this

168
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.530
classification has stood the test of time. There has

169
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.570
not been any bad new discovery in the past

170
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.289
25 years that. Has required me to add an

171
00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:52.799
8th category, but I do want to emphasize that

172
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.830
within each category, there are lots of examples. So,

173
00:09:57.369 --> 00:10:01.330
cell loss, for example, you know, it's simply when

174
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.469
cells die and they are not automatically replaced by

175
00:10:06.049 --> 00:10:11.320
the division of other cells, right now. Um, You

176
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.520
know, uh, that's a pretty straightforward concept, but of

177
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.179
course it happens in different places in the body,

178
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.640
and the cells that are affected are different types

179
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.200
of cells. So in Parkinson's disease, for example, you

180
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.960
have, it's driven by the loss of a particular

181
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.909
type of neuron called a dopaminergic neuron, which is

182
00:10:28.909 --> 00:10:30.599
in a particular small part of the brain called

183
00:10:30.599 --> 00:10:34.099
the substantia nigra. Um, BUT it also happens in

184
00:10:34.099 --> 00:10:37.900
the thymus, which is, uh, a place that's responsible

185
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.400
for a very important part of the immune system.

186
00:10:40.739 --> 00:10:42.460
It also happens in the heart where you have

187
00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.359
these things called pacemaker cells that are gradually lost.

188
00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:48.280
Um, AND each of these cell types are different,

189
00:10:48.619 --> 00:10:51.729
so you need to develop different treatments to repair

190
00:10:51.729 --> 00:10:55.059
this damage, to restore the number of cells. But

191
00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:57.219
in all cases, you should be able to use

192
00:10:57.219 --> 00:11:00.580
stem cell therapy for that. Now that we have

193
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:05.960
things like. INDUCED pluripotent stem cells and so on,

194
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.400
we have the capacity to generate pretty much any

195
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.229
type of cell that we might like and inject

196
00:11:12.229 --> 00:11:14.679
it into the right place so that it will

197
00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:19.479
divide and transform into replacements for the cells that

198
00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:22.280
the body is not replacing on its own. So

199
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.830
that's all great, uh, but of course these cell

200
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.280
therapies have a lot of diff have some differences

201
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.659
in detail, however, they do have a lot in

202
00:11:29.659 --> 00:11:31.500
common. All stem cell therapies have a lot in

203
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.820
common as well. So that's why the classification is

204
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.890
useful. Even though there are lots and lots and

205
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.539
lots of different types of damage, they can be

206
00:11:39.539 --> 00:11:42.859
grouped into this manageable number of categories for each

207
00:11:42.859 --> 00:11:45.359
of which there is a generic repair approach.

208
00:11:47.539 --> 00:11:52.010
What about uh telomeres and telomerase? Is it a

209
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.500
problem or is there anything we can do about

210
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:54.799
it?

211
00:11:55.859 --> 00:12:01.719
So the popular um uh rendition of the role

212
00:12:01.719 --> 00:12:05.820
of telomeres and telomerase in aging has always been

213
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:11.390
quite problematic. When people first discovered that telomeres get

214
00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:15.969
shorter with cell division, there was a huge like

215
00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:18.390
hype about the idea that this might be the

216
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.950
driver of aging, that cell division could only go

217
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.469
on for a finite amount of time, but that

218
00:12:25.469 --> 00:12:30.010
was. Overlooking the fact that most of the cells

219
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.989
in our body, either they don't divide at all,

220
00:12:33.409 --> 00:12:36.049
or if they do, it's very, very rare, they

221
00:12:36.049 --> 00:12:38.010
divide like, you know, once a year if you're

222
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.840
lucky, kind of thing. And um that means that

223
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.880
it's OK for the telomeres to get shorter. They

224
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.679
don't get into a state where they are too

225
00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:49.400
short for anything to for for the cell to

226
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:55.250
operate correctly. Um, AND furthermore. There was quite rapidly

227
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.809
a discovery. I mean, we knew that this thing

228
00:12:57.809 --> 00:13:00.359
must exist, but it was discovered, um, of this

229
00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:04.539
enzyme telomerase that compensates for the telomere shortening that

230
00:13:04.539 --> 00:13:08.400
happens during cell division. And sure enough, it turns

231
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.080
out that the cells that do divide quite a

232
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.580
lot during life actually make some of this enzyme,

233
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.780
and therefore they don't have this problem of the

234
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.320
telomeres getting short, getting too short for the cell

235
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.809
to survive. Now, there may be some exceptions to

236
00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:28.210
what I just said. There may be some cases

237
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.770
in the body where shortening of telomeres actually does

238
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.770
contribute to dysfunction. In the immune system especially, there

239
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.890
is some evidence for that. But generally it seems

240
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.400
not to be a big player in aging. Whereas

241
00:13:42.599 --> 00:13:45.789
the opposite thing really is. So of course there's

242
00:13:45.789 --> 00:13:48.320
one type of of one category of my seven

243
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.159
categories, which is called division obsessed cells, that's more

244
00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:56.429
or less synonymous with cancer. And cancer is a

245
00:13:56.429 --> 00:13:59.960
bad thing, obviously. So we'd like the cells in

246
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.719
a cancer not to be able to divide indefinitely.

247
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.880
We'd like them to kill themselves through telomere shortening

248
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.979
if possible. And I put forward an idea in,

249
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.820
I think 2002, uh, for how we might do

250
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.590
that. It was a very, very ambitious and you

251
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.710
know, some would say far-fetched idea, and a lot

252
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.750
of people said it could never work and certainly

253
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:27.710
right now it doesn't work, but what's fantastic is

254
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.469
that in the meantime people have developed a kind

255
00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:34.239
of improved version of my idea. In which um

256
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.979
you can just use a small drug, a simple

257
00:14:35.979 --> 00:14:39.739
molecule that achieves the same thing. It essentially takes

258
00:14:39.739 --> 00:14:43.340
cell, if it gets into a cell that is

259
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.900
making a lot of telomerase, which is 90% of

260
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.059
all cancers, then the the cell will kill itself

261
00:14:49.059 --> 00:14:53.219
very quickly. So, um, the, the idea of controlling

262
00:14:53.219 --> 00:14:57.099
telomere elongation is very much alive and kicking and

263
00:14:57.099 --> 00:14:59.260
a very important part of how we're going to

264
00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.239
bring aging under control.

265
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.409
And how can aging be combat combated actually and

266
00:15:06.409 --> 00:15:11.429
tell us specifically also about sense or engineered negligible

267
00:15:11.429 --> 00:15:12.390
senescence.

268
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.929
Right, so, um, as I've been saying, there are

269
00:15:15.929 --> 00:15:19.429
these various types of damage that accumulate. And if

270
00:15:19.429 --> 00:15:22.520
we can repair these various types of damage in

271
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.030
various ways, stem cell therapy to repair loss of

272
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.190
cells or you know this drug I just mentioned

273
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.750
to get rid of cancer cells, or other drugs

274
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.989
called synolytics which get rid of zombie cells that

275
00:15:33.989 --> 00:15:36.549
are death resistant, as I call them, and so

276
00:15:36.549 --> 00:15:40.250
on. If we can do all these things, then

277
00:15:40.609 --> 00:15:44.349
we will be combating aging. We will be turning

278
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.770
a biologically old person into a biologically young person,

279
00:15:48.219 --> 00:15:50.409
and we can do that as often as we

280
00:15:50.409 --> 00:15:52.609
like. As I mentioned earlier when you asked about

281
00:15:52.609 --> 00:15:56.570
longevity escape velocity, the problem will get harder over

282
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.909
time because of the particularly difficult types of damage

283
00:15:59.909 --> 00:16:03.609
that we can't yet repair, but if we are

284
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.719
rapid enough in improving our ability to do this

285
00:16:07.719 --> 00:16:10.500
or that type of damage repair, then that's OK.

286
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.070
So that will essentially be the medical control of

287
00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:17.919
aging and you know that's why I coined the

288
00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:22.840
term sense, strategies for engineered negligible senescence. Senescence is

289
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.799
the word that biologists use when they want to

290
00:16:24.799 --> 00:16:28.000
talk, you know, rigorously about aging because they want

291
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.830
to talk about the bad, the bad aspects of

292
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.760
getting old. Negligible senescence therefore means, um, you know,

293
00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:41.150
uh, essentially bringing the rate of aging down so

294
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.599
low that you can't detect it. And that term

295
00:16:43.599 --> 00:16:47.200
was coined actually negligible senescence uh at least 10

296
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.440
years before I came along. Um, TO describe the

297
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.359
natural phenomenon where some species appear not to age

298
00:16:54.359 --> 00:16:57.799
in the wild. Um, AND then of course engineered

299
00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:01.539
negligible escence means taking an organism like human beings

300
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.160
that does age and turning it into an organism

301
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.520
that doesn't using medicine.

302
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.880
And what would exactly be the goals of combating

303
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.810
aging? What goals do you have in mind?

304
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.260
It's perfectly simple. I don't want to get sick.

305
00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.920
I don't want anyone else to get sick. You

306
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.900
know, people often focus on the radical life extension

307
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.098
aspect, but that's, that's incorrect. I don't think about

308
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.109
length of life very much. I just think about,

309
00:17:29.199 --> 00:17:31.199
I don't wanna get sick. I don't, I don't

310
00:17:31.199 --> 00:17:34.079
suppose you want to get sick. And it just

311
00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:36.680
so happens that a side effect of staying healthy

312
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.630
is you stay alive with high probability. Most people

313
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.750
die from being sick these days. And of course,

314
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.280
most people get sick from having been born a

315
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.040
long time ago.

316
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.489
And what kinds of technologies and medical approaches do

317
00:17:51.489 --> 00:17:55.829
we already have at our disposal to combat aging?

318
00:17:57.449 --> 00:18:01.829
Basically nothing, but it's close. So at the moment,

319
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.410
of course, there's a huge industry selling, you know,

320
00:18:04.489 --> 00:18:10.369
supplements and other kinds of devices that theoretically postpone

321
00:18:10.369 --> 00:18:14.880
aging, but everybody knows that even if they work,

322
00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:17.250
they only work a little bit, and of course

323
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:20.810
different things work for different people. So I wouldn't

324
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.609
call them really anti-aging medicine in the way that

325
00:18:24.609 --> 00:18:28.119
we would like to have. However, A number of

326
00:18:28.119 --> 00:18:32.040
the damage repair approaches that I um have described

327
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.239
over these years are now in clinical trials, so

328
00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.880
they're pretty close to being available. There are clinical

329
00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.800
trials for stem the stem cell therapies against Parkinson's,

330
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:43.040
for example. There are clinical trials of this drug.

331
00:18:43.224 --> 00:18:46.984
Mention that kills off 90% of cancers. There are

332
00:18:46.984 --> 00:18:50.145
clinical trials for synolytics, the drugs that kill off

333
00:18:50.145 --> 00:18:54.025
senescent cells. It's moving very rapidly in the right

334
00:18:54.025 --> 00:18:56.525
direction now. So I think within only a few

335
00:18:56.525 --> 00:18:59.954
years we're going to see these things widely available,

336
00:19:00.025 --> 00:19:02.185
and the benefits to health will be very large

337
00:19:02.185 --> 00:19:02.704
indeed.

338
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.699
So I would like to ask you now about

339
00:19:05.699 --> 00:19:08.619
two different kinds of drugs. The first one, I

340
00:19:08.619 --> 00:19:11.900
don't know exactly about its current status, but at

341
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.459
least a few years ago people were talking about

342
00:19:14.459 --> 00:19:18.459
it a lot. What do you make of metformin?

343
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:23.119
OK, so metformin is a very old drug that

344
00:19:23.119 --> 00:19:29.849
was um originally developed to treat diabetes and. Maybe

345
00:19:29.849 --> 00:19:32.849
10 or 15 years ago, people started to think

346
00:19:32.849 --> 00:19:35.650
about whether it might have a much more general

347
00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.109
effect on aging overall. And there was some evidence

348
00:19:40.109 --> 00:19:43.810
that suggested that it did. People have actually since

349
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.030
then they have questioned whether that evidence is quite

350
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.630
as persuasive as it was originally thought to be,

351
00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.369
but there's still pretty good evidence that metformin may

352
00:19:52.369 --> 00:19:55.369
very well have general anti-aging effects. So first of

353
00:19:55.369 --> 00:19:57.790
all, we would like to understand how, you know,

354
00:19:57.959 --> 00:20:00.109
what does it do, and we kind of understand

355
00:20:00.109 --> 00:20:02.989
that metformin gets in the way of what's called

356
00:20:02.989 --> 00:20:06.689
the electron transport chain in mitochondria, so it basically

357
00:20:06.689 --> 00:20:10.729
slows down the rate at which cells can make

358
00:20:10.729 --> 00:20:16.390
ATP, the energy currency of the cell. That Is

359
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:19.069
something that's very similar to what happens if you're

360
00:20:19.069 --> 00:20:21.750
in a famine, if you, you know, like, are

361
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.670
not eating as much as you would like. You

362
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.420
obviously, the way that um mitochondria make ATP is

363
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.750
by taking energy from nutrients, and if you're not

364
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.530
eating enough, then you'd have got fewer nutrients. Now.

365
00:20:34.739 --> 00:20:37.530
Over the years, oh well, over the millennia, um,

366
00:20:37.609 --> 00:20:43.329
evolution has developed ways to, um, respond to famine,

367
00:20:43.739 --> 00:20:45.349
because of course famines happen in the real world.

368
00:20:46.069 --> 00:20:51.089
And it turns out that it's evolutionarily beneficial to

369
00:20:51.609 --> 00:20:54.859
reprioritize one's, what, what one, what, what the body

370
00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:58.510
is doing in a famine relative to when food

371
00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:02.189
is abundant. Essentially it comes down to when food

372
00:21:02.189 --> 00:21:06.189
is abundant, it makes sense to grow really fast

373
00:21:06.189 --> 00:21:10.150
and reproduce really fast so that you can reproduce

374
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.869
and pass on your genes before you get eaten

375
00:21:12.949 --> 00:21:16.760
or whatever, um. But in a famine, there's not

376
00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.560
much point in doing that because if you have

377
00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.920
offspring, then those offspring will die of starvation before

378
00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.119
they have their own offspring. So, um, it's best

379
00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:29.560
to, you know, hunker down and and conserve energy

380
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.319
and so on and, and try to outlive the

381
00:21:32.319 --> 00:21:35.359
famine. And of course, maybe you will, maybe you

382
00:21:35.359 --> 00:21:38.680
won't, but, but evolution is all about a numbers

383
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.280
game, so it still makes sense. All right, so

384
00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.689
pretty much all animals seem to do this. They

385
00:21:44.689 --> 00:21:48.410
respond to famine, and that means they also respond

386
00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:53.010
in the exact same way to situations within the

387
00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:57.810
cell that resemble famine. So metformin is one of

388
00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:59.770
those things. It's what's called, what's called a calorie

389
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.869
restriction mimetic. And some of the other most, um,

390
00:22:04.209 --> 00:22:07.280
you know, high profile drugs that are believed to

391
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.010
have general effects on aging. Are also calorie restriction

392
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.729
mimetics. Generally they work by different mechanisms. For example,

393
00:22:14.839 --> 00:22:18.329
there's a very famous drug called rapamycin, which works

394
00:22:18.329 --> 00:22:22.359
by slowing down the synthesis of proteins. Um, YOU

395
00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:24.270
know, essentially anything that gets in the way of

396
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.400
what the cell likes to do with energy, either

397
00:22:26.959 --> 00:22:29.560
extracting it and making ATP or using the ATP

398
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.199
in this or that way, you know, it's tic

399
00:22:32.199 --> 00:22:35.800
one way or another, um. So the question then

400
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.790
is, you know, is this the holy grail, and

401
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:43.619
unfortunately the answer is no. Long-lived species do not

402
00:22:43.619 --> 00:22:46.949
get very much benefit from calorie restriction, from, from

403
00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:50.199
eating too little, um, and therefore they also don't

404
00:22:50.199 --> 00:22:53.510
get very much benefit from these calorie restriction mimetics.

405
00:22:53.849 --> 00:22:55.930
The reason for this is very straightforward. It's simply

406
00:22:55.930 --> 00:23:00.229
that in nature, long famines don't happen very often.

407
00:23:00.329 --> 00:23:03.050
They happen less often than short famines, and that

408
00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:07.689
means there is less evolutionary selective pressure. To develop

409
00:23:07.689 --> 00:23:12.229
and maintain machinery to do this, you know, reprioritization

410
00:23:12.229 --> 00:23:13.079
I was talking about.

411
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.739
How about rapamycin?

412
00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.410
Well, right, I was just mentioning that for precisely

413
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.780
for that reason. Same deal. Everything I just said

414
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.060
about metformin, the exact same thing applies to rapamycin.

415
00:23:25.949 --> 00:23:30.790
Mhm. OK. Uh, TELL us about methylation clocks. What

416
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.750
are they and can we use them to find

417
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.569
anti-aging treatments?

418
00:23:36.229 --> 00:23:40.609
Right, so I mentioned the um Types of types

419
00:23:40.609 --> 00:23:42.489
of clocks that there are right now, right? There

420
00:23:42.489 --> 00:23:45.040
are clocks, there, there are measures of biological age

421
00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.750
based on function, and there are measures of biological

422
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.229
age based on omics. So the epigenetic clocks are

423
00:23:51.609 --> 00:23:53.969
a a subset of the omic clocks. They are

424
00:23:53.969 --> 00:23:56.839
in fact the biggest subset. There are also transcriptomic

425
00:23:56.839 --> 00:23:59.770
clocks and proteomic clocks and such like. But yeah,

426
00:23:59.849 --> 00:24:02.569
I mean, these are quite fashionable right now because

427
00:24:02.569 --> 00:24:05.089
they are new and they have improved a lot

428
00:24:05.089 --> 00:24:08.719
over the past decade. Um, ESSENTIALLY what they do

429
00:24:08.719 --> 00:24:13.839
is they look at changes to the, to, to

430
00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:17.810
particular molecular modifications that cells make to their DNA,

431
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.760
um, and that these modifications sometimes change with age.

432
00:24:22.569 --> 00:24:26.250
They see, you know, um, so you can look

433
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.880
at, you know, a lot of people of a

434
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.449
given age and you can say, well, OK, what

435
00:24:29.449 --> 00:24:33.369
is the methylation state of these people, and you

436
00:24:33.369 --> 00:24:35.170
can look at a higher age and you can

437
00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:37.449
see whether there are differences in the methylation state

438
00:24:37.449 --> 00:24:39.770
on average across a population of a given age.

439
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:43.069
And then, of course, you can, you can ask

440
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.979
for any other person. You can say, well, OK,

441
00:24:46.109 --> 00:24:50.930
what is their actual age and what. Is their

442
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:54.739
methylation age, in other words, what is the age

443
00:24:54.739 --> 00:24:59.020
that is typical of someone who who has that

444
00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:03.290
methylation state? And that's their biological age by methylation.

445
00:25:03.839 --> 00:25:06.040
These things are still not very accurate, but they're

446
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:06.599
getting better.

447
00:25:08.739 --> 00:25:12.699
How close would you say is biomedical technology to

448
00:25:12.699 --> 00:25:15.739
significantly postponing aging?

449
00:25:16.729 --> 00:25:20.489
Well, the, um, current prediction that I make is

450
00:25:20.489 --> 00:25:23.489
that we have a 50% chance of reaching longevity

451
00:25:23.489 --> 00:25:28.770
escape velocity before the end of, before 2040. So

452
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.890
in other words, in 12 to 15 years towards

453
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:35.109
the end of the 2030s. Um, NOW, of course.

454
00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.239
As I mentioned, some of the technologies that are

455
00:25:38.239 --> 00:25:41.270
going to be relevant to this are already in

456
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:45.719
clinical trials and therefore they will be around and

457
00:25:45.719 --> 00:25:50.359
available quite a lot sooner. And it's possible that

458
00:25:50.369 --> 00:25:52.339
that will be enough to get us to longevity

459
00:25:52.339 --> 00:25:56.060
escape velocity. But I, I, I, I'm more cautious

460
00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.900
than that. I think that some of the things

461
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.859
that we're going to need to give us that

462
00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:05.469
initial 20 years of postponement of aging are among

463
00:26:05.469 --> 00:26:08.020
the difficult things that are not in clinical trials

464
00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.060
yet and probably won't be in clinical trials for

465
00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.119
several more years.

466
00:26:13.219 --> 00:26:17.829
Do you think it would be possible to postpone

467
00:26:17.829 --> 00:26:23.229
aging indefinitely, and would it be possible to not

468
00:26:23.489 --> 00:26:23.890
die?

469
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.920
So first of all, yes, I think we can

470
00:26:28.219 --> 00:26:30.900
postpone aging indefinitely, but the way we will do

471
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.020
it is by this longevity escape velocity thing. First,

472
00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.459
we will postpone it by 20 years and then

473
00:26:36.459 --> 00:26:39.459
during those 20 years, we will figure out how

474
00:26:39.459 --> 00:26:41.380
to postpone it another 20 years and so on.

475
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.680
If you think about the mathematics of that, it

476
00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.520
gets progressively easier to get the next 20 years

477
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.060
than it was for the previous 20 years. So,

478
00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.520
I'm completely certain that once we get those 1st

479
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.560
20 years, we will never slip below longevity escape

480
00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:02.699
velocity again. We will definitely proceed easily, rapidly enough

481
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
to um to to keep one step ahead of

482
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.670
the problem. So in other words, we will not

483
00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.810
actually have at any point the actual technology that

484
00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.550
completely eliminates aging, but we won't need to have

485
00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:20.349
it. The actual impact on us will be equivalent

486
00:27:20.349 --> 00:27:21.670
to what it would be if we did have

487
00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:27.150
that. Um, AS regards death, um, you know, I,

488
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.790
one of the things that I constantly complain about

489
00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.709
is that the media are very fond of saying

490
00:27:32.709 --> 00:27:34.989
death when they mean aging. And the reason that's

491
00:27:34.989 --> 00:27:40.400
a huge problem is because everybody knows that. We

492
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.760
can't prevent death with technology, you know, there are

493
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.560
just too many ways to um to die that

494
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.040
have nothing to do with how long ago you

495
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.199
were born. Whether it's being hit by a truck

496
00:27:49.199 --> 00:27:51.150
or the planet being hit by an asteroid or

497
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:57.839
whatever. And so You know, basically what That confusion

498
00:27:57.839 --> 00:28:05.140
of words creates is a kind of subliminal belief

499
00:28:05.439 --> 00:28:08.040
that aging is the same, that aging can also

500
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.719
not be defeated by technology, which is incorrect, it's

501
00:28:12.719 --> 00:28:16.280
untrue, but it kind of makes people feel comfortable.

502
00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:17.920
It helps them to put it, put aging out

503
00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.560
of their minds. So I'm quite sure that journalists

504
00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.839
do this on purpose, that they say death when

505
00:28:22.839 --> 00:28:27.229
they mean aging just to get readership. And it's

506
00:28:27.229 --> 00:28:27.969
very damaging.

507
00:28:28.979 --> 00:28:32.380
Yeah, that's also the reason why I separated the

508
00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:35.180
question into two different questions, because I wanted you

509
00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:40.060
to address aging and death separately here. Do you

510
00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:44.859
think that most doctors apply this framework or this

511
00:28:44.859 --> 00:28:48.660
approach you have to aging to their practice in

512
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.209
any way?

513
00:28:49.459 --> 00:28:53.560
Oh, certainly not, not yet. And that's because doctors

514
00:28:53.819 --> 00:28:57.390
are only able to do things that already exist.

515
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.140
They are only able to give people medicines that

516
00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.300
have already been approved. Now, as I mentioned, none

517
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.900
of this is approved yet. Some of these things

518
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.635
are close. They're in clinical trials and so they

519
00:29:08.635 --> 00:29:11.275
may be approved in the next few years and

520
00:29:11.275 --> 00:29:13.964
then absolutely that's going to happen. But I do

521
00:29:13.964 --> 00:29:18.354
not blame doctors for focusing only on what they

522
00:29:18.354 --> 00:29:21.194
can currently do, because that's a that's a big

523
00:29:21.194 --> 00:29:24.675
job. Um, YOU know, if they try to spend

524
00:29:24.675 --> 00:29:28.114
their time trying to anticipate things that they can't

525
00:29:28.114 --> 00:29:30.435
yet do because they haven't been developed yet or

526
00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:33.395
haven't been approved yet, then, you know, that would

527
00:29:33.395 --> 00:29:35.314
make them less effective. So that's fine.

528
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.449
So let me ask you now just a couple

529
00:29:39.449 --> 00:29:45.329
of questions about the possible implications that solving aging

530
00:29:45.329 --> 00:29:50.569
could have for women physiologically. Would women still have

531
00:29:50.569 --> 00:29:53.469
menopause if we solved aging?

532
00:29:54.209 --> 00:29:56.829
Not if they don't want to. So the ovary

533
00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:00.010
is just another organ. It can be regenerated and

534
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:04.829
rejuvenated just like any other. And in fact, people

535
00:30:04.829 --> 00:30:08.329
are already making good progress in this, in creating

536
00:30:08.329 --> 00:30:14.170
ways to regenerate follicles and regenerate ocytes. Normally the

537
00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:18.390
egg cells in a woman's ovary are all created

538
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:22.880
before the woman had even been born. But there's

539
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.380
no inherent reason why that should be the case.

540
00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.400
We may be able to regenerate an ovary and

541
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.790
give it more follicles and more oocytes in situ.

542
00:30:33.439 --> 00:30:36.880
Another possibility is to is to grow an ovary

543
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.880
outside of the body and then transplant it surgically.

544
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.140
Um, AND these are, these things are already being

545
00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:46.839
explored. Now, of course, the question is, do you

546
00:30:46.839 --> 00:30:50.050
want that as a woman? Uh, AND some, some

547
00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:53.119
women are looking forward to menopause. They don't enjoy,

548
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:57.180
you know, having periods. Um, BUT of course, there's

549
00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.280
also no reason why one would not be able

550
00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.380
to turn it on and off and have all

551
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.660
the, you know, benefits without the, um, side effects.

552
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.939
And do you think that if women did not

553
00:31:08.939 --> 00:31:13.300
have menopause anymore, it would influence birth rates?

554
00:31:13.619 --> 00:31:15.819
Yes, but not in the way that you're probably

555
00:31:15.819 --> 00:31:22.569
thinking. They Um, The world we have seen, you

556
00:31:22.569 --> 00:31:25.810
know, has each society goes through this thing called

557
00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:30.369
the demographic transition where women reach a certain level

558
00:31:30.369 --> 00:31:34.810
of prosperity and education and emancipation, and they have

559
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:38.050
choices and they suddenly have far fewer children than

560
00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:41.479
they than they used to. Mhm. And that's interesting,

561
00:31:41.709 --> 00:31:44.910
but the thing is, they also have those children

562
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.589
later. Only a bit later because, of course, we

563
00:31:47.589 --> 00:31:50.150
have menopause right now, so if you want children

564
00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:54.150
at all, then there's a deadline. But the point

565
00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:56.589
is they have them a bit later. Why? Of

566
00:31:56.589 --> 00:32:00.069
course, different women have different reasons, but, you know,

567
00:32:00.229 --> 00:32:01.790
just the other things they want to do with

568
00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.479
their lives before they do this terribly time consuming

569
00:32:04.479 --> 00:32:08.150
thing, right? Um, SO if they didn't have the

570
00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:11.829
deadline, if they didn't have menopause, then it stands,

571
00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:15.689
it, it seems very likely that most women who

572
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:20.160
are postponing having kids a little bit will just

573
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.750
postpone having kids a lot instead, you know, by

574
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:27.069
another decade and another decade because they can. And

575
00:32:27.069 --> 00:32:31.459
therefore, what I actually think is likely is that.

576
00:32:32.099 --> 00:32:36.540
The number of Um, babies that are born in

577
00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:40.550
any given calendar year worldwide, um, would actually go

578
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:44.109
down as a result of the opportunity to have

579
00:32:44.109 --> 00:32:47.180
more, which is quite counterintuitive, but I'm pretty sure

580
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:47.469
of it.

581
00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:52.949
Yeah, that's a very interesting take on this issue

582
00:32:52.949 --> 00:32:56.530
because another question that I have here is, wouldn't

583
00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:01.630
solving aging lead to massive overpopulation, because I mean

584
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:05.989
people would be living much, much longer. So

585
00:33:05.989 --> 00:33:09.270
right, so if you I mean, so if you

586
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.469
look at what people are projecting now, they, uh,

587
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.180
the United Nations, for example, they say that world

588
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.920
population will come to a maximum in like the

589
00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.839
2060 or 2070 or something like that. But of

590
00:33:20.839 --> 00:33:23.839
course that only, that's only true if people continue

591
00:33:23.839 --> 00:33:27.119
to die. And the UN has not taken my

592
00:33:27.119 --> 00:33:31.469
kinds of predictions into account yet. So, um. We

593
00:33:31.469 --> 00:33:33.630
would certainly expect that there will be almost no

594
00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.150
death, because, you know, we will not have death

595
00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:38.310
from aging and we'll probably also get quite a

596
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.989
lot better at not having death from road accidents

597
00:33:40.989 --> 00:33:44.510
and so on either, right? Um, SO hardly any

598
00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.849
death, and there will be some birth. I mean,

599
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:51.189
we don't know whether having kids will go out

600
00:33:51.189 --> 00:33:54.020
of fashion, but the chances are it probably won't.

601
00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.390
So, um, we'll have more, more kids. But then

602
00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.430
we have to actually do the arithmetic. We have

603
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:04.130
to quantify this and say, OK, even taking a

604
00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:09.610
pessimistic scenario where. What I said about menopause just

605
00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.510
now does not happen and women carry on having,

606
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:14.958
let's say 1 kid every 10 years on average,

607
00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.810
something like that, then, um, you know, what's going

608
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:21.590
to happen? Turns out that it's gonna take a

609
00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.870
really, really long time before we have an overpopulation

610
00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.958
problem. At the moment, we have 8 billion people

611
00:34:27.958 --> 00:34:31.810
on the planet, but we also have well over

612
00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:35.090
8 billion acres of land, even if you don't

613
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:38.929
include land that's unpleasant to live in, right? So

614
00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:40.929
that means every single person on the planet could

615
00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:44.370
have their own acre as of today, and we

616
00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:49.100
still wouldn't have to live anywhere unpleasant. Now. Um,

617
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.280
Of course, people say, OK, we've got an overpopulation

618
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.560
problem today, you know, and it's true, we do,

619
00:34:55.708 --> 00:34:58.709
but it's not because there's not enough space. It's

620
00:34:58.709 --> 00:35:02.800
because. People are making too much pollution, you know,

621
00:35:02.959 --> 00:35:05.520
pumping too much carbon into the atmosphere or, you

622
00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.360
know, plastics that, that build up in the oceans,

623
00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:12.000
things like that. And hello, uh, you know, people

624
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.320
forget that we're actually also, at the same time

625
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.159
as we're developing technology to control aging, we're also

626
00:35:18.159 --> 00:35:23.389
developing technology to, Address those problems, you know, capturing

627
00:35:23.389 --> 00:35:26.479
carbon from the atmosphere and, you know, developing bacteria

628
00:35:26.479 --> 00:35:30.120
that eat plastics, things like that. And that no.

629
00:35:32.179 --> 00:35:34.739
Excuse me, those technologies are going to be completely

630
00:35:34.739 --> 00:35:39.479
happening way before we have any kind of demographic

631
00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:43.340
impact on the pop on the world arising from

632
00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.459
bringing aging under control, way before. So the whole

633
00:35:47.459 --> 00:35:52.959
idea of overpopulation is definitely, you know, described wrongly.

634
00:35:53.179 --> 00:35:57.260
We will have a diminishing overpopulation problem over the

635
00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.979
next century, whatever happens to aging, and it will

636
00:36:00.979 --> 00:36:04.429
be. At least a few centuries before we actually

637
00:36:04.429 --> 00:36:08.209
get A genuine problem of not having enough space,

638
00:36:08.639 --> 00:36:12.020
um, even in a pessimistic scenario with regard to

639
00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.149
fertility rates, and it's a very bad idea to

640
00:36:15.149 --> 00:36:17.229
try to predict or to try to, you know,

641
00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:20.169
to make decisions about what we should do today

642
00:36:20.469 --> 00:36:22.310
on the basis of what we think might happen

643
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:23.750
a few 100 years in the future.

644
00:36:25.209 --> 00:36:28.340
I understand. What about, and this is more of

645
00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.500
an economics question I guess, but one that I

646
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.820
would imagine many people would worry about. What about

647
00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.850
retirement? Do you think that people would be forced

648
00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:42.379
to work much longer and would people really want

649
00:36:42.379 --> 00:36:43.520
to work longer?

650
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.959
So this is another case where people look at

651
00:36:46.959 --> 00:36:51.239
a post-aging world and they forget that it's going

652
00:36:51.239 --> 00:36:53.159
to be a different world in other ways as

653
00:36:53.159 --> 00:36:55.110
well. So just in the same way that we

654
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:58.879
will have technology that that maintains that removes carbon

655
00:36:58.879 --> 00:37:02.699
from the atmosphere or whatever, similarly, We will have

656
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.000
automation. Automation is coming really fast. You know, again,

657
00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.060
let's talk about the United Nations. Pretty conservative organization,

658
00:37:10.919 --> 00:37:15.040
but they say clearly that by 2050, most of

659
00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:20.080
the jobs that people currently have won't exist. And

660
00:37:20.479 --> 00:37:22.030
of course when that happened the last time, a

661
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:25.080
couple of 100 years ago in the industrial revolution,

662
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:33.399
We maintained the economy of essentially full employment because

663
00:37:33.409 --> 00:37:36.199
the jobs that went away in manufacturing and in

664
00:37:36.199 --> 00:37:39.669
agriculture. Were replaced by this new thing called the

665
00:37:39.669 --> 00:37:43.290
service industry. That's not gonna happen this time around,

666
00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:45.110
uh, you know, how many people do you need

667
00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:48.330
in the entertainment industry, right? It's not gonna happen.

668
00:37:48.669 --> 00:37:52.449
So, that means that the economy will be redesigned

669
00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:57.909
around ideas like universal basic income to mean that.

670
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.699
You, the, the retirement age will not have to

671
00:38:00.699 --> 00:38:02.729
go up. In fact, it will do the opposite,

672
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.939
it will come down. You know, hardly anybody will

673
00:38:05.939 --> 00:38:08.229
end up working because we just won't need very

674
00:38:08.229 --> 00:38:10.620
many people. It will be more, we'll have more

675
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.060
prosperity as a result of having machines do all

676
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.790
the things that we have to do today. Now,

677
00:38:15.979 --> 00:38:18.300
of course, there are plenty of other changes to

678
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:22.479
society that will happen in, in relation to that.

679
00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.540
In particular, you know, we have to, we have

680
00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:29.830
to think about, um, Self-esteem, you know, why do

681
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:32.560
people value themselves? At the moment, a lot of

682
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.030
people get their value in life from the work

683
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.239
that they do, from the fact that they receive

684
00:38:36.239 --> 00:38:38.040
a paycheck and they know that they are benefiting

685
00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.959
humanity even though they don't see, they don't actually

686
00:38:40.959 --> 00:38:44.100
interact with the people they are benefiting. So we

687
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:48.939
may see a shift into a more um natural

688
00:38:48.939 --> 00:38:52.540
society where people get most of their self-esteem and

689
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:56.419
self-worth from actual direct personal interactions with people rather

690
00:38:56.419 --> 00:38:59.939
than this rather second class indirect interaction.

691
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:04.590
OK, so I have just one last question. What

692
00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:09.500
do you think of the anti-aging industry as it

693
00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:14.239
is currently? I mean, with all the Things that

694
00:39:14.239 --> 00:39:18.810
we see online and elsewhere of people making claims

695
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:23.969
about nutrition, about supplements, and so on. I mean,

696
00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:26.790
with the things that we have access to right

697
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:31.530
now when it comes to aging, what do you

698
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:32.250
think about it?

699
00:39:32.659 --> 00:39:35.739
Yeah, so, I mean, the anti-aging industry has of

700
00:39:35.739 --> 00:39:38.340
course existed since the dawn of time. You know,

701
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.699
uh, people have been trying to sell stuff that

702
00:39:40.699 --> 00:39:43.419
doesn't work in order to, you know, on the

703
00:39:43.419 --> 00:39:45.060
basis that it will make people live longer, and

704
00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.919
it, it's, you know, it's, it's existed since forever.

705
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.540
In fact, when I started to get going in

706
00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:53.209
my career, um, and started to give public speech,

707
00:39:53.419 --> 00:39:55.699
talks and so on, it was very useful that

708
00:39:55.699 --> 00:39:58.219
I look the way I do because nobody can

709
00:39:58.219 --> 00:39:59.979
look at me and think that I could possibly

710
00:39:59.979 --> 00:40:03.969
be in this for personal financial gain. Um, YOU

711
00:40:03.969 --> 00:40:05.689
know, it, it, I, so I was able to

712
00:40:05.689 --> 00:40:08.689
distance myself from all of that, which was important

713
00:40:08.689 --> 00:40:12.610
because of course I was making very eye-catching predictions

714
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:15.530
about how much we would be able to keep

715
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:20.409
people healthy, um. But now things are rather different

716
00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:25.090
because side by side with that industry, the anti-aging

717
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:27.510
industry, there is another thing which is normally called

718
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.010
the longevity industry, and that consists, that didn't exist

719
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:34.110
at all until 10 years ago. Um, IT consists

720
00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:38.149
of companies that are typically quite small still, though

721
00:40:38.149 --> 00:40:40.030
some of them have have become quite big now.

722
00:40:40.889 --> 00:40:44.290
Um, AND, um, that are developing these new medicines

723
00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:48.129
I'm talking about that are much more powerful and

724
00:40:48.129 --> 00:40:51.889
effective than anything that's existed in the past. And

725
00:40:51.889 --> 00:40:54.020
a lot of money is going into those companies,

726
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.530
and rightly so, and those are the people that

727
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:59.915
are spearheaded. These clinical trials that we're talking about

728
00:40:59.915 --> 00:41:02.935
and the um other work that have not yet

729
00:41:02.935 --> 00:41:04.935
got to clinical trials, but we'll do so soon.

730
00:41:05.294 --> 00:41:06.885
So I think that's a very important distinction to

731
00:41:06.885 --> 00:41:09.175
make. The longevity industry is not snake oil at

732
00:41:09.175 --> 00:41:11.814
all. It is definitely focusing on the real problem

733
00:41:11.814 --> 00:41:12.834
and the real solutions.

734
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.639
Right. Great. So just before we go, Doctor De

735
00:41:17.639 --> 00:41:20.159
Grey, would you like to tell people where they

736
00:41:20.159 --> 00:41:22.909
can find your work on the internet?

737
00:41:23.399 --> 00:41:25.040
Sure, yeah, we haven't talked about my work at

738
00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.590
all. Um, I, I should emphasize that I don't

739
00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.479
have a company. I have a nonprofit, a charity

740
00:41:30.479 --> 00:41:34.669
based in California. It's called Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation.

741
00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:37.479
The website is LEVF.org. I'm sure you will put

742
00:41:37.479 --> 00:41:40.280
it in the show notes. And of course there,

743
00:41:40.399 --> 00:41:42.800
there's plenty of information about what we do and

744
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.600
what we want to do. There's also a nice

745
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.239
big friendly donate button because everything we do costs

746
00:41:47.239 --> 00:41:51.159
money. And um and of course it, it's easy

747
00:41:51.159 --> 00:41:52.760
to get hold of me on LinkedIn or Twitter

748
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.879
or whatever. So, um, yeah, I mean, I encourage

749
00:41:55.879 --> 00:41:58.320
people to contact me if they want to. And

750
00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.560
also if anyone wants to support this work, we

751
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.750
will be eternally grateful because it's really life saving

752
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:06.379
work. It's the most important work that anyone's doing

753
00:42:06.379 --> 00:42:08.020
worldwide. That's our sincere belief.

754
00:42:09.379 --> 00:42:11.610
Great, I will leave links to that in the

755
00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:14.500
